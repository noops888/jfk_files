7789 656]

Reference is made to your request dated 4 January 1966

for y Covert Security Approval to permit Subject's use as a First

Officer in the Far East under Project HBILKA/JBGREED.

Concurrent

with issuance of the approval, the following is offered for your

information.

2. Investigation has recently been completed with generally

favorable results. However, Subject's military file indicated that

he had been found unfit for duty due to excessive drinking, and

had been allowed to retire in the best interests of the Navy.

His

Navy record stated that this drinking problem adversely affected

his judgement, rellability, and personal behavior.

This weakness

had been discussed to no avail with Subject on several occasions.

It should be noted that domestic inquiries developed no indica-:

tion of over-indulgence since his departure from the military on

October 1964.

3. Additionally, it was developed that Subject's brother

, was the Subject of an FBI investi-

gation in 1941, which was conducted to resolve allegations regarding

the loyalty of Subject's brother.

Subject's brother was determined

to have been associated with known Communists and was active in

Communist matters in the Los Angeles, California area during this

period of time. However, it was noted that these activities had

caused a break with this individual and his family, who were not

in sympathy with his viewpoints and activities.

There was no
