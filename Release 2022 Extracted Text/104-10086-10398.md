SUBJECT: Review of Mexico City Station Files
at the Warrenton Record's Center

1. On 2 May 1977 Chris Hopkins and Annie Goodpasture
visited the (Warrenton) Record's Center to review old Mexico
City files in search of additional photographs of the
“unidentified man". We were unable to locate any such
photographs. It appears that earlier photographs may have
been destroyed in a purge of Mexico City Station files and
that the folders for the destroyed material were re-used to
forward more recent photographic material to Headquarters
for retention. Following are the Job numbers of boxes reviewed
and pertinent notations re re-use of the old folders:

REPRODUCTION PROHIBITED

Soviet compound and the LIMITED site was diagonally across a double laned
street on the southeast corner of that block. (see attached diagram) .
LIMITED was the first photo base and operated strictly on an experimental
basis in the early stages. ‘This base, however, was closed when the Sta-
tion received word that the photograph of the “unidelitified man" was

being released by the Warren Commission. LILYRIC was an alternate photo-

“ graphic base. It was located in an upper story of an apartment building

on the same side of the street as the LIMITED site but in-the middle of |
the block south. It hada Planted view of the front gate of the Soviet
Embassy. LICALLA, the third photographic site, was located in one of a
row of four houses on the south side of the Soviet Embassy compound.
This site overlooked the back garden of the Soviet Embassy compound. The

Purpose of this operation was to get good identification photographs of

Soviet personnel. The three photographic sites were managed by.a re-

cruited agent who was a Mexican citizen, the son of an American mother

and Mexican father (deceased). This agent collected the film from the

‘LIMITED and LILYRIC sites three times a week. The film was. then de-

veloped and printed into 8 x 10 contact print strips: LICALLA film was
originally processed in the Station but in early (1959) due to the resig-
nation of a technician, this film like that of LIMITED and LILYRIC was

Processed on the outside by a recruited agent.

~ REPRODUCTION PROWBITED.

Mobile surveillance was conducted by two American staff officers.
These two officers organized a surveillance team of six recruited agents
which used late model cars and a panel truck for surveillance. The team
could be activated by radio from the LIMITED site whenever. someone of
interest left the gate of the Soviet Embassy. These agents were aware of
the LIMITED site since they had been issued LIMITED photographs for
identification purposes.

The Station also conducted afunijatera)) mail intercept operation,
LIBIGHT, which was handled by an American case officer. \ A recruited)

agent, who had a semiofficial status, obtained selected letters

from a subagent employed by the Mexican postal system;

2. (Liaison) Coverage:

iaison coverage was unreliable and insecure as characterized by

the nature of the Mexican service? at that time. The Mexican Direction
of Federal Security (OFS), @ith which we conducted Tiatson, was a hip-
pocket group run out of the Mexican Ministry of Government. This-Ministry
was principally occupied with political investigations and control of
foreigners. Their agents were sansbhectal and corrupt.

CLIENVOY, was. run by a Mexican officer. The listening post had 30 lines

connected at one time. The transcription room was staffed by Hexican
Army officers In 1961, (because of mismanagement by the Mexican prin=)
Ccipats)) the Station chief, himself, became the project case officer. A

Station officer assisted him in the daily supervision of the listening
post, and in picking up the transcripts and the tapes. There was also
an American technician inside the listening post

> comecoens: —-AEPRODUCTION. PROHIBITEL

In mid-1962, the Mexican officer in charge of LIENVOY (tha

Yoint_tap_operation) asked the American officer at the LIENVOY listening

post for the telephone numbers of the Soviet, Cuban and Satellite Em-

bassies in anticipation of possible coverags). The Station immediately

@isconnected all of the unilateral telephone taps on these Embassies so)

cthat they would not be discovered when the Mexicans hooked up their)

(taps. The Mexicansjsoon thereafter connected five Cuban lines, five

Soviet lines, three Czech lines, two Polish lines, and one Yugoslav

line. At the listening post, a live monitor made short summaries of
conversations of interest which were then included in a daily resume
for the Chief of Station. Later, when a reel was completely recorded,
full transcripts were typed and passed to the Station; however, there

was usually a time lag of a day or two. Reels which contained Russian

CCOU161



eg

‘ry a language other than Spanish or English were taken to another Jocation
for translation and typing. Mr. Boris Tarasoff did the Russian transla-
tions but because of the volume of Russian conversations, the translations

usually ran about a week behind the date ‘of the conversation.

As soon as the Station learned that an American identifying him-

self as Lee Oswald phoned the Soviét Embassy, Miss Ann Goodpasture of the
Station started screening al] photographs. However, here again, there
was a backlog because the photographs were picked up three times a week
but those picked up were usually for dates a few days before since the
technician who was processing the film, did so on a night-time basis.
Further, photographs were not made initial ly until a complete ro] of
film was used. Later this was changed and the operator cleared the camera
at the end of each day regardless of amount of unused film remaining.

The instructions were to cover the entire work day (office hours) and to
“photograph all Soviets, their families, all foreigners, and cars with

| foreign license plates. Human error did occur but generally the agents
were conscientious. The Cuban Embassy coverage had more sophisticated

equipment using a pulse camera which frequently developed niechanical dif-

DURAN if the american has been there.

DURAN: Yes, he is still here.

SOVIET: According ‘to the letters that he showed them from the (Soviet)
Consulate in Washington, he wants’ to go to the USSR to stay
a long time with his wife who is Russian, but also the
answer had not been received (by him) regarding his problem.
That accordingly these transactions take 4 or 5 months but
without prior approval from the USSR, they have to Tequest

An unidentified man (speaking Spanish) calls the Soviet Embassy
Consulate’ at 1037 hours and asks for the Consul. He is told that
the Consul is not there. The unidentified man asked what is needed
to get visas.to go to Odessa.- He is told to call back at.1130 hours.

Item 137, page 2

At 1235 hours a man named ALATRISTE (not a Soviet) from inside: the
Soviet Embassy Consulate calls out to number 45-37-72 (Colonial
America, probably a pension or hotel but number not listed in the

+ Item 395, pages 7 -and 8 : i =

Just after 1600 hours, the Soviet Consulate received a call from the
Cuban Consulate (Sylvia DURAN) who said she had there a U.S. citizen
who had requested a transit visa to Cuba because he is going to the
USSR. DURAN wants to know with whom he: spoke at. the Soviet Embassy
because she‘ sent him over to.them. telling him that if the Soviets

approved the visa then the Cubans would give him one without anything

more, advising the (Department of) Iitmigration in Cuba. She wants
to know with whom he spoke because he says that he doesn't know
either with what person and who told him that certainly there would
be no problem.’ The Soviet asks DURAN to wait a minute. After a
short wait DURAN explains the same thing to another Soviet. ‘his
Soviet tells her to leave her telephone (number) and her name and
someone will return the call. DURAN gives her name and telephone
number 11-28-47 then says as a personal thing, she has moved and
has not advised them of a-change of “address so will not receive their
Bulletin and can give it to them now. The Soviet asks her to call
KOUKHARENKO in order to change that address and asks for the name
of the (Cuban) Cultural Attache. DURAN says it is Teresa PROENZA
whose number is 14-13-26. The Soviet thanks her.

CIA Withheld Vital Intelligence From War:

By ROBERT. S. ALLEN.

WASHINGTON, Oct. 20.
~The Central intelli:
gence Agency withheld
Vital intelligence | infor-
mation from the Warren
Commission during its in-
vestigation. of the assa
sination. of Presi deni
Kennedy.

Despite the commis
sion’s written request for.
all documents that might
shed light on the asso
sination, CIA authorities
failed to turn over a na-
tional intelligence esti-
mate warning that It is
Kremlin policy to remove
from public office by as:
sassination Western offl-

‘cials who actively oppose
“Soviet policies.

Titled “Soviet Strategic
Executive “Action,” the
suppressed CIA’ docu-
ment went into the shock.
ing details of how agents
of KGB, the Soviet secret
police, are trained to do
away ‘with Western lead-
ers, including officials in
the U.S. and to make
their deaths appear due
