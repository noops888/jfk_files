CRIMINAL INFORMANT COVERAGE

The Baltimore Office advised that the indices of

the

Baltimore Division disclosed the following Information

regarding MAX L. GOLDBERG, an accountant for the subject,

which is considered pertinent to this investigation:

By memorandum of January 4, 1958, to the Agent In Charge,

GOLDBERG was listed as a confidential informant of

Baltimore.

"At that time, it was reported that MAX !.

GOLDBERG had resided in Baltimore for many years and

resided with his wife and children at 3701 Clarinth Road.

He was described as a certified public accountant who operates

not only in Baltimore, but throughout the eastern United States.

He was further identified as an informant for the Baltimore

Office since October 3, 1946, and it was stated that since

that time, he had furnished valuable information relative

to slot machine operators, distributors and various

Individuals which the Baltimore Office desired to interview,

and no payment of money was necessary for these services.

It was stated that the informant had furnished reliable

background information regarding slot machine operators

and had given considerable Information in an investigation

of the reactivation of the CAPONE gang.

In connection

with this investigation, he obtained a

copy of the

Wurlitzer Company franchise in Pittsburgh, Pa., for the

Baltimore Office when it was being sought throughout the

country.*

In 1950, it was reported that GOLDBERG is extremely

cautious and desires thorough discreetness in divulging

information.

He was found to have been highly reliable

and trustworthy as long as he was approached cautiously.

It was reported at that time that there was no question

regarding his loyalty and in April, 1950, he was

designated as a confidential source. No record was found

in the indices of the Baltimore Office indicating that

GOLDBERG had been

contacted since 1950.

During August, 1951, in the course of a survey regarding

Interstate transportation of gambling devices, inquiry

made Of numerous local law enforcement agencies.

that time MERVIN BOYD, United States Treasury Department,

advised that MAX GOLDBERG handled

the accounting work

1n

the eastern portion of the United States:

He stated that

made to interview:

GOLDBERG, but it was learned that he was away from his

Baltimore residence

Attempts. are being made by the

Baltimore Office to

obtain the full cooperation of 2

GOLDBERG in furnishing all details available to him

regarding Individuals connected with the Top Hoodlwm

Frogram and consideration is being given to developing

him as a current potential criminal informant of the

3104

020

Baltimore Office.

Oh April 8, 1958,

GOLDBERG advised telephonically.in

a long distance call to the Baltimore Office that he

was at that time receiving treatment at Citizens General

Hospitaly New Kensington, Pao, for an acute condition

attributed to his selatie nerve.:

He stated that he

had been advised by his physician that he mist be in

the hospital until at least April 1o, 1958, and w11l

therearter return to his home in Baltimore for an extended

stay. GOLDBERG advised that he will cooperate fully

In any way possible with Bureau agents on a confidential

basis

The following individuals are presently being utilized

by the Pittsburgh Office in this investigation:
