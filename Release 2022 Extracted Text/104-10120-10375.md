(Proposal to Cover Field Assessment of © t

Potential HEDSKIN Agent Candidates) i

#90682 i

1. Reference is made to the attached SR memorandum dated Hy
3 February 1961. Hf

2.. The original of this memorandum was concurred in by
ne Robert L. BANNERMAN, Acting Director of Security, on 6 February
: 1961 and forwarded to Central Cover Group. A memorandum had

been previously concurred in by Mr, Thomas CARROLL, cr/oa.

As indicated therein, a new procedure is proposed for the initial : |
contact and A & E screening of potential REDSKIN agents. This
would considerably reduce the number of persons who are briefed

on Agency interest in thé REDSKIN Program inasmuch as those persons
who are rejected as a result of the A & E testing would never be i
briefed on the CIA interest in same, as is currently the case. :

3. This matter was immediately brought to Mr. BANNERIAN's
attention in view of his previous interest in reducing the number
of contacts with CIA @iiay! redentials. He concurred in the pro-
posal as is indicated above, with the verbal recommendation
to the SR representative that,after the plan has been found :
feasible, possibly two or three junior personnel be assigned to i]
conduct this testing on a full-time basis, rather than utilize
such staff personnel as Dr. GOLDER and pi (au), who are openly
associated with CIA. These junior psychologists would then be
represented with the cover concern, PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSESSMENTS 24 !
ASSOCIATES) 4n@ would not ‘become associated with GIA, thereby :
obviating the possibility of embarrassment to the Agency and/or i
possible compromise of the cover asset involved. 5

4. This memorandum is being written in order that it may ‘
be brought to the attenticn of appropriate components within |
TOS, including the Investigations Branch, inasmuch as the procedure i
will have an effect on IB, i.e., the number of REDSKIN cases ie
will be reduced since clearances will not be secured on poten- 1

HG tial candidates util they have been favorably screened by the i
Tee A & E Staff (see paragraphs 3(c) and h(c})e is



5. No further action is conterplated in this matter by the
writer. :
