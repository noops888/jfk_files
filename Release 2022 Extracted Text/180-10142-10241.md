York, Chicago, Venezuela and Cuba. (Ibid) The clandestine
faction operating in Cuba was lead by Pepin Fernandez Badue
who used the alias "Lucas". (Ibid) When Fernandez arrived in
the U.S. in October 1961, he presented his credentials to the
Cuban Revolutionary Council (CRC), claiming he was the rep-
resentative of the MDC movement in Cuba, and Council president,
Dr. Miro Cardona, accepted him into the CRC. (Ibid) The
"Lucas" faction remained with the council but declined in
importance because Fernandez failed to consult with the
Executive Committee of his faciton nor did he make any effort
to hold the group together. (HSCA Security File 092, Senstudy

the repressive measures of the Castro regime after the

invasion caused members of the Cuban undergound to live in

fear of discovery and made intergroup liaison extremely risky.

It was the year 1963, however, that found the Batista
faction of the MDC involved in a large number of anti-Castro

activities.

The MDC made a unity pact with the Commandos L in which @

the latter group was to provide training and assistance in |
military intelligence and the MDC was to provide 3 small boats
and a team of men to infiltrate Cuba. The MDC also made iY yo!

In April 1963, Frank Sturgis, Miami-based soldier of
fortune, supplied information that Batista, Orlando Bosch Avila,
Manuel Artime and Alexander Rorke were jointly planning an air
strike over Havana on April 25. (HSCA #009303, page 1, FBI #97-4623,
Section I) According to Sturgis, the strike was to originate from an
airstrip in Puerto Rico and the target a sugar reiting (Ibid) ~

Richard Rudolph Davis, A Cuban alien, WZ¢U/An/Anexiddn
widéKdx (HSCA 012981) had a peripheral association with the
MDC through his contact with Batista in the summer of 1963.
(Ibid) Davis was residing in New Orleans and, although not

at an earlier time

an MDC member, claimed/to have been a "coordinator" for the
group and the New York Police Deparmtent. (Ibid) He was
a friend of Batista and contacted him because he knew Batista
was in a position to recommend men in the Miami area who
needed work. (Ibid) Davis claimed he could provide employ-
ment for a small group of Cuban emigres.

Davis had entered into a business deal with geologist
David L. Raggio and a wealthy, right-wing New Orelanian, Gus
de LaBarre, forming the Guatemalax Lumber and Mineral Corpora-
tion. (Ibid) It was their intention to train the Cubans on
some land in Lacombe, Louisiana to which de LaBarre had access
through his nephew, Frank de LaBarre. (Ibid) After the train-
ing period, they were to be sent to Guatemala to cut mahogany.

A group of about 18 Cubans did arrive, under the leader-
ship of a well-known Cuban exile, Victor Paneque (Ibid), who 7

used the military code name of Commadante Diego. (eikayt eri. # ®
According to Davis, the men arrived dressed in khakis (HSCA 006716,
p. 4) with the idea they were to receive military training.
(HSCA 006716, p. 2, FBI, Richard Rudolph DAvis, Volume I,
Report from New Orleans, 7/3/64)

In the latter part of July 1963, the FBI conducted a
raid on property near that of the lumber company training camp,
where they seized a cache of dynamite and other explosives.

(Ibid). This raid, according to Davis, unnerved his trainees,

and they elected to return to Miami. (Ibid)

A somewhat different version of this episode comes
from Gus de LaBarre's nephew and attorney, Frank, who first
related his story in 1966 to his former law school classmate,
Jim Garrison. (HSCA 012981, Fonzi memo 9/6/78)

de LaBarre said his Uncle Gus had introduced him to
Davis, whom deLaBarre described as a "floater". They came to
see de LaBarre about drawing up Articles of Incorporation for
the Guatemalan Lumber Company and that is when he learned of
their plans to bring unemployed Cubans from Miami to train as
loggers. Uncle Gus sent provisions to the exiles on a daily
basis and solicited money for food and clothing from friends
and relatives.

de LaBarre said he didn't pay much attention to the
activities of the group but, when he heard on his car radio that
the FBI had seized a cache of ammunition at a house in Lacombe,
he immediately called his uncle. Although receiving assurances
that the lumber group was not involved, de LaBarre called the
officers of the corporation together and insisted that the
Cubans be taken out of there. Davis claimed, according to
de LaBarre's version, that the Cubans did not want to leave,
whereupon de LaBarre had to some some real "brainstorming'.
He rented a Hertz ton-and-a-half truck and instructed Davis to
take it to the camp and tell the Cubans "that the invasion is

on."

Davis complied, and the Cubans loaded their gear, jumped
in the truck and were brought to the Greyhound bus terminal
in New Orleans. Each Cuban was given.a one-way ticket to Miami

plus a small amount of cash and told they would get their orders

when they reached Miami. Looking as though ready for war, with
knapsacks and guns bulging from under their clothes, they
boarded the bus and de LaBarre had no more contact with them.
The last he heard of Davis was in 1964 when one of de LaBarre's

friends reported he had gone into business with Davis and was

left with a lot of bills. (Ibid)
