SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC)

Investigation of the Assassination of President John F. Kennedy:

: Referring to Book V, "Performance of the Intelligence
Agencies With Respect to the Assassination of President Kennedy,"
in the Summary, page 2, Findings, page 6, and at several other
-points, comment is made that the SSC discussion of investigative
deficiencies and failure of intelligence agencies to inform the
Warren Commission of certain information does not lead to.a con-
clusion that there was a conspiracy to assassinate President Ken-
nedy, The majority of the report deals with speculation that other
information which may have been pertinent as an indication of a
conspiracy was not furnished to the Warren Commission. The state-
ment is made on page 4 that the FBI investigation focused narrowly
on Lee Harvey Oswald.

Observations: It is true that the initial investigation
focused on Oswald. There were compellii indications from the
inception of the investigation that Oswald had assassinated the
President. As the SSC report states on page 32, the FBI investi-
gation was a massive effort. This investigation logically focused .
on Oswald and thoroughly covered all aspects of his life. By his
Order of November 29, 1963, establishing the Warren Commission, :
President Lyndon.B. Johnson sought to avoid parallel investigation
and to concentrate fact-findings in a body having the broadest
national mandate, The FBI furnished the Warren Commission volu-
minous information in the early weéks of the investigation,
including information regarding Oswald's contacts with the Cuban
commmity. The Warren Commission used this FBI information and
reports from other agencies as a starting point for its inquiry.
Based on these initial reports, the Warren Commission thereafter
requested additional investigation by the FBI in numerous areas.
The seed was present for the Commission to request jinvestigation. in
the areas now alleged by theiSSC to have’ been overlooked. The FBI
was, by virtue of the original procedures set up, not in a position
of actually directing the course of the investigation, a matter
which was the responsibility of the Warren Commission. The old
adage of “hindsight is better than foresight," would appear appli-
cable in this instance. At-the time of the Warren Commission
inquiry, the areas now alleged to have been unexplored apparently
did not seem worth pursuing due to the compelling evidence that
Oswald had acted alone. There have been no indications found that
there was an attempt to cover up any of the new areas suggested by
the SSC. .Had the Warren Commission requested the FBI to conduct
investigation and furnish information in those areas, it most
certainly would have been done. w

‘would include security informants.

SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE.ON INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC)

Pages 39 and 102 set forth information concerning two
teletypes dispatched by FBI Headquarters. The first, on Novem-
ber: 22, 1963, instructed all field offices to immediately contact
all informants, security, racial, and criminal, as well as other
sources, for information bearing on the assassination of President
Kennedy. The second teletype, on November 23, 1963, also dis-
patched to all field offices, stated that all offices should
resume normal contacts with informants and other sources with
respect to bombing suspects, hate group members, and known racial
extremists. From these two teletypés the SSC draws the conclusion
that instructions to interview security informants were "rescinded."

Observations: A careful review of the wording of the
teletypes reveals that the first teletype instructed all offices
to immediately contact all informants, including security.
informants. The second teletype does not rescind any of the
instructions. It merely lowers the time priorities for contacts
with respect to designated types of individuals; namely, bombing
suspects, hate group members, and known racial extremists, For
these types of individuals, the instructions were modified to call-~
for normal contacts with them rather than immediate contacts. As
Oswald was not believed associated with such types of people, it _-
would be logical to modify the instructions. Most significantly, /”
the second teletype does not comment in any way concerning the oA
required immediate contacts with the other types of sources which

On page 17 it is indicated that the FBI learned that
Rolando Cubela, in October, 1963, was in contact with the Central
intelligence Agency (CIA). The SSC claims that the FBI should
have told CIA and that the CIA would then have aborted its plot to
assassinate Cuban Premier Fidel Castro through the use of Cubela
because the plot was insecure. However, the SSC further indicates
from testimony of CIA officials that at the time CIA already had
grave doubts about the security of this plot (commonly referred to
as the AMLASH plot) and reasonably could have aborted it without
having benefit of the FBI information. (AMLASH was the code name
used by CIA for Cubéla).

Observations: The reason that the FBI did not advise CIA:
when it learned that Cubela was in contact with CIA is that the a
source for the information made a specific request that the FBI
not disseminate the information in order to protect the physical

well-being of the source and possibly of others. The SSC is
aware of this factor. The SSC, therefore, put undue stress upon
the FBI's declining to advise CIA of its information when,
according to CIA testimony, the security of the plot had long
since been doubted by CIA.

On page 38 it is stated that the FBI had sources in
the Cuban field who might have been able to provide relevant
information on possible Cuban involvement in the assassination
but that these sources were never utilized.

Observations:

SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC)

On page 96 appears a statement attributed to FBI
Special Agent James Hosty.. The information is attributed to an
affidavit of Hosty of July 17, 1975.

Observations: The affidavit date is incorrect. The
correct date Is September 22, 1975. é

Footnote number 15 on page 97 refers to a Staff inter-
view of William C. Sullivan (former FBI Assistant to the Director)
on April 21, 1975. -

: Observations: As the date of the interview appeared to
the FBI to be Incorrect, SSC Staff Member James Johnston was
contacted by an FBI representative on June 24, 1976, concerning
the accuracy of this date. Johnston advised, after checking
SSC records, that the correct date for the interview should have
been, shown as April 21, 1976.

On page 40 there is stated the claim of the SSC that it
“found that FBI Headquarters never instructed field agents to
contact informants or sources familiar with Cuban matters to
determine whether they had any information concerning Cuban
involvement in the assassination.”

wees Qbservations: The above is not a completely accuraté,
“statement as revealed through information earlier set out in this
memorandum concerning the FBI's contacts with its informants.

On page 40, under a heading entitled The FBI investiga-
tion in Mexico City, it is stated that the FBI Legal Attache in
Mexico stated that while conducting the investigation he
proceeded under the "impression" conveyed to him by Bureau Head-
quarters that Oswald was the lone assassin. The Legal Attache is
then quoted as stating, “Our investigation was dedicated or
directed toward establishing Oswald's activities in Mexico and
looking toward trying to establish whether he had been accompanied
by anyone while he was in Mexico." -

Observations: In quoting directly from the Legal Attache
it is clear that the FBI was concerned with establishing whether
or not Oswald may have had some confederate or confederates.

Thus, it is not accurate to, imply that the FBI was concerned only
with determining that Oswald was a "lone assassin."

SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC

On page 36 information is’ attributed to a Soviet
Section supervisor at FBI Headquarters who was extensively
involved in the investigation. It is reported that in late
1963, this supervisor had been assigned the “responsibility
of going through every file in the FBI to see whether lined
lead had been overlooked in the case.

obse:3 ati ons: On its face, the claim that an FBI
supervisor was: ged with going through every file in the
FBI is ludicrous. Consequently, this supervisor, now retired,
was consulted by a representative of the FBI. It is his
‘contention that the information attributed to him in the above
quotation is out of context. He observed’ that it would have
been ridiculous to have been assigned to review every file in
the FBI. He recalls, and he’so told the SSC upon interview of
i April 27, 1976, that at some date considerably after the assas-
7 whe had béen charged with going through all relevant
files on the matter, but that he had never been charged with a
responsibility for reviewing all FBI files; nor ‘did he perform
such a function. Significantly, this former supervisor also
advised that he had never- been given the opportunity by the
ssc to review his testimony for accuracy, although same was
-recorded by the SSC. at the time of the interview,
