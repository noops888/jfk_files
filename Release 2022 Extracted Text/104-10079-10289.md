4, SECURITY AND PROBLEMS,

a) During the period under review, there have been no known incidents
which adversely effected the security of Project LIMPTY. However, as a pre~
cautionary measure, the LIENTRAP photogr writ was repainted (a basic color
change) in January 1965, It is this action will increase the
security of the LIENTRAP unit an agein operate in various arses
where it had been used

b) There have been no major op
problems in this Project during the reporting p

onal, personnel, or administrative
Fank

PLANS.

a) During the past project year, many of the operational assignments,
levied on Oliver G.-SCANTLING, vhile within the realm of the Station's RMD,
have fallen outside the scope of Project LIBPTY. Consequently, a new Project
Outline is being prepared at the Station to cover the relationship with, and
the present and anticipated operational activities of SCANTLING,

b) Anticipated changes in the LIMITED installation/activities were out-
lined in paragraph 2, Section c above. Other then noted above, there are no
asic opzrational.or administrative changes contemplated for Project LIEMPTY,
