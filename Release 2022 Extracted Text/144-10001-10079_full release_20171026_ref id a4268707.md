15. Section III/2-smerican Consul General Hong Non Comments On Peiping Reaction

To President Kenr-sdy's Death;

Comment; There ig a distinctive defensive note underlying Chinese Communist
comrentary, which the im ConGen believes can be attributed to Peiping's
realization that except for Corrunist China and a scattering of adherents,
the vhole world(including the USSR) has joined topether in mourning the loss
of President Kennedy ind in wishing President Johnson wall. as so often 13
the cise when Peiping fcels itself isolited and on the Jefensive, og | .
regarding Soviet charges that the Chinese Communists advocate war a8 4 meuns
of world revolution, Peiping in this instance feels oblired to vilify its
chosen enemies inordinately in order to justify its extreme stand. Insofar
at lceal Chinese reaction is concerned in Hong Kong, the ConGen contacts
think this line will prov oke adverse effect even among Communist adherents.
What effect such treatment will have on China mainland remiins to be ene.
Meanwhile, we surmise that Peiping senses it will have considerible difficult
in shifting its proparanda attacks away from President Kenedy to his
successor, who is unknown quantity due to regime's technique of using hte
Presidnet as the personification of all that it hates in us.
