CIA's Performance on the Inquiries

Book V of the SSC Final Report challenges the performance of the
intelligence agencies during the Warren Commission inquiry, empha-
sizing things that it feels should have been done but which it asserts

were not.

It is correct to say that CIA has not produced evidence or
analysis that addresses every theory that has been advanced over the
years. A record of the volume of CIA reporting to the FBI and the
Warren Commission is at Tab E. As a practical consideration, every
theoretical question that can be conceived cannot be answered con-
clusively; there simply may be no evidence at all, or if there is
evidence somewhere it may not be accessible. The issue is what the
intelligence agencies did -- in the present instance, what was the
performance of CIA -- with Book V of the SSC Final Report portraying
a patternof neglect or avoidance that is not supported by the record.

The SSC Final Report offers a number of separate subjects in

support of its case:

a. It refers to an allegation by a person identified as
"D" (pages 28-30, 41-42 and 102-103) that he overheard and
saw Oswald being handed money in Mexico City for the purpose
of assassinating President Kennedy; this was proven false, both
by polygraph and by determining that Oswald was in New Orleans
instead of Mexico City at the time the incident was supposed to
have occurred. This subject is treated in a confusing and in-

conclusive manner in the SSC Final Report.

: b. A considerable portion of the Report is given to the

ae 4 AMLASH operation. The operation is described inaccurately.

The Report assigns it characteristics that it did not have during

| the period preceding the assassination of President Kennedy, in
order to support the SSC view that it should have been reported
to the Warren Commission. This is treated in some detail at Tab D
of this report.

c. Space is devoted to two aircraft flights from Mexico
City to Havana, on 22 November and 27 November (see pages, 60-
63).. The first of these flights, as described in the SSC Report,
is based on an inaccurate report about a delay of the 22 November
flight to meet a mysterious private aircraft; the correct story
removes the basis for the inferences of the SSC version. The
second of these flights had to do with a man whose significance
arises from a patently erroneous report; the FBI investigated him
thoroughly, as is apparent from the condensed summary in the SSC
Final Report.
Hy These examples illustrate the problem of commenting on the SSC Final
Report, the question becoming that of how to deal with Congressional
criticism presented on the basis of inaccurate factual perceptions.
To treat the problem it was felt necessary to review the record in-depth

and to report the findings, whatever they are.

Recognizing the possibility of error or oversight in 1964--both
on the part of CIA and the Warren Commission--consideration was given

to courses of action CIA might have taken to throw some light on the

2

questions as understood at the time, as well as considering those
questions that have developed since then. What would be the areas of
inquiry? Oswald was an obvious subject of investigation.

Oswald was known to have been out of the country twice subsequent
to his return to private life from the Marine Corps in September 1959.
These overseas adventures were appropriate for CIA attention. The
first of these overseas trips was when he went to the Soviet Union in
October 1959 from which he returned in June 1962. The second of these
trips was when he went to Mexico City in late September 1963, from
which he returned in early October 1963. :

In addition to these two areas of obvious specific inquiry for CIA,
there is the problem of general foreign intelligence collection that
might in some way produce information on the subject. The SSC Final
Report adds to these considerations operations being conducted by CIA
as. part of a general U.S. program against the Castro regime. These
four general areas of inquiry are covered below.

I. Travel to and from the USSR 1959-1962

ia e 26 Novenber 1968 a cable was sent to Paris, Rome, Madrid,
Gérontages) (psie) Goersinxs Brussels, The Hague, London, and Ottawa
giving biographic information on Lee Harvey Oswald. It noted his
discharge from the Marine Corps in September 1959 and his travel to
the Soviet Union in October 1959, including sketchy details as to his
employment and marriage while in the USSR. The cable requested:
“any scrap information which bears on President's

assassination...."



CONFIDERTHL

F On 27 November the various addressee stations replied, with
(het sini) and London providing additional details on the travel of
Oswald to the USSR. Additionally, London reported that a.British
journalist claimed that during his own imprisonment in Cuba in 1959
there was a U.S. gangster there by the name of Santos, who was living
in luxury in jail because he could not return to the U.S.; the source
stated that Santos was "visited frequently by another American
gangster named 'Ruby'." (See pages 24-28, Tab C.)

Also on 27 November Ottawa reported the "delight" of the Cuban
Embassy staff over the assassination of President Kennedy although
the staff was instructed to "cease looking happy in public," in
conformance with instructions from Cuba to "govern their, actions by
official attitude of Govt to which they accredited." bs19} on the
same date, reported that the Soviets were shocked, blaming the
assassination on extreme right-wing elements. Otherwise, the initial
responses produced no other information. :

On 29 November The Hague and Frankfurt were queried about Oswald's
travel back from the USSR. This query was followed on 2 December by
a similar cable to Berlin, Frankfurt, Bonn and The Hague. Various
reporting produced details about the travel of Oswald and his wife
from the USSR through Germany and the Netherlands enroute to the
United States in June 1962.

The other stations involved in these inquiries had no traces or

information on Oswald; liaison services were also queried without



detailed results although there were some @QR5R=ME> operations that
produced peripheral information about the reactions of various groups

under intelligence surveillance. Considerable exchanges were held
with the Warren Commission on Oswald's Soviet record and its possible
significance. No evidence was found tying the Soviet Union to Oswald's
assassination of President Kennedy. Book V of the SSC Final Report,
in not criticising the Agency's performance in.this aspect of the
investigation, seems to have accepted it as adequate, and it will
not be detailed here.
II. Oswald Mexico Visit -- September-October 1963
The visit by Oswald to Mexico City, in his attempt to get
visas for travel to the Soviet Union and Cuba, has received extensive
attention. The details concerning the coverage of Oswald's visit to
Mexico is treated in another annex to this paper (Tab F). The concern
felt by all initially for the possible significance of Oswald's visit,
and his contacts with the Cuban and Soviet embassies, was obvious at
i the time. The following statement is in a cable to Mexico City on
: 28 November 1963:
"We have by no means excluded the possibility
that other as yet unknown persons may have
been involved or even that other powers. may

have played a role. @22ueEEoirwumhhege

statement to the Mexico City Station on 1 December 1963:

on his own has still not been finally resolved."

gain, on 13 December 1963 the Mexico City Station was cabled as

“Plse continue watch for Soviet or Cuban reaction

propaganda about case.  Sijaamasesieeaneeaeeey>1

17 December 1963 Headquarters forwarded a dispatch to the Mexico
‘ty Station stated as follows:

"...Mexico City has been the only major

overseas reporter in the case. While this

life, we have not overlooked the really out-
standing performance of Mexico City's major
assets and the speed, precision, and perception
with which the data was forwarded. Here it was
relayed within minutes to the White House,
(Department of State] and [the FBI].
GRRMRPEMA, the statements of Silvia
“DURAN, ‘ind your analyses were major factors in
the quick clarification of the case, blanking
out the really ominous spectre of foreign backing."

Essentially, Oswald's visit to Mexico City was investigated as
thoroughly as possible, producing no evidence there of Soviet or
Cuban complicity in the assassination of President Kennedy. If anything,
events during Oswald's visit there are more subject to being seen as
counter to such a possibility, given his troubles with both Cubans
and Soviets. We do not offer this thought as the final word, but more
simply that if it bears on the subject at all it is inconsistent with
speculation that he had some special relationship with either nation.

It is noted that various allegations have been made in the press
in connection with the House Select Committee on Assassinations
inquiry concerning CIA information regarding Oswald's Mexico visit;
these are commented on at Tab G.

III. General Collection Requirements
On 22 November 1963 all CIA stations abroad received a cable

from Headquarters with the following statement:



“Tragic death of President Kennedy requires all

of us to look sharp for any unusual intelligence

developments. Although we have no reason to

expect anything of a particular military nature,

all hands should be on the quick alert at least
for the next few days while the new President
takes over the reins."

It is appropriate at this point to observe the general reaction
to be expected from such a communication. Without any leads, other
than those arising from Oswald's identification, the requirements to
field stations were necessarily general. General reporting can be
i ‘stimulated by general requests, if there is something to report, and
this is what was undertaken. In addition, in any event, intelligence

assets and liaison services overseas are quick to realize the signifi-
cance of important information and will report it on their own initiative.
It is significant, in the light of these considerations, that there has
i been the most ‘Limi ted reporting on the subject. Were there relevant
i or significant information on the subject it would have been reported
either in responses to the expression of general interest, or
spontaneously, if such information was known to Agency sources.
_If one believes that there was a conspiracy, with Oswald involved,

one must accept the likelihood that his fellow conspirators would not

have shared their knowledge beyond the narrow circle of thase directly

involved. Conversely, if there were no conspiracy, there obviously



ATi iaak

would be nothing to report in the first place. The absence of concrete
reporting seems to serve, regardless of which is the case, as the basis
for the apparent SSC view that no collection effort was undertaken.

As has been noted above, there were initial CIA collection re-
quirements to the field. What they could be realistically expected to
produce must be related to whether there was any information to collect
at all, and if so whether it was accessible. The requirements were issued,
but in retrospect it is doubtful that they could produce much of the who-
what-where-when-how information that typifies intelligence collection

reporting. A reflection of the basic nature of the problem is found in

‘the Headquarters cable to Mexico City on 17 December 1963 (note above)

which contains the following comment about the limited reporting from
other stations:

". . . this partly dictated by the facts of Lee

Oswald's life. . ."

The SSC Final Report speaks in rather unqualified terms at page 10
about the resources of the intelligence agencies, including a description
of "an extensive intelligence network in Cuba," suggesting that it was
only necessary to ask to get. It is correct to say that there were
sources in Cuba able to report on events, such as troop movements, but
there were no penetrations of Castro's inner circle, where any infor-
mation on the subject in question would exist. The distinction apparently
was missed --‘or ignored -- by the authors of the SSC Final Report. As
stated by the Miami Chief of Station, quoted at page 58 of the SSC Report:

"Now if you are referring to our capability to conduct
an investigation in Cuba, I would have to say it was
limited."

This does not mean that such assets as there were did not have reporting


“iV HAG

requirements levied on them, in fact, there was considerable activity
in this respect. In the course of the present review a number of case
officers at the Station during that period have described the frenetic
activity in this respect. The characterization by the Chief of Station
as to passive collection by CIA inside the United States should not be
extended to apply to what was done with reporting assets outside the
United States, as the SSC Final Report attempts to do at the bottom of
page 58. :

The SSC Final Report has undertaken to paint this din very different
terms than the record supports. The extensive reporting to the FBI
and the Warren Commission provides a truer reflection of the level of
activity by CIA (see Tab E), even if its sources did not bear on every
question that has been concerved since then.

IV "Unpursued Leads”

At pages 60-67, in Book V of the SSC Final Report, there is a section
that addresses leads that were felt to not have been followed by the
intelligence agencies. This follows the section on CIA's Performance
on the Inquiries. This section first addresses two Cubana flights to
Havana from Mexico City on 22 November (the date of President Kennedy's
murder) and 27 November 1963, raising questions about passengers reported
to be aboard those flights.

ay way of background it is noted that during that period Cubana
flights traveled on a round trip basis between Havana and Mexico
City every other day. More specifically, there were flights at this

time on 22 November, 25 November and 27 November. The flights on

10

OWiriDeNTIAL

22 and 25 November to Havana were passenger flights, while the one

on 27 November appears to have been essentially a cargo flight, with
one passenger, the man referred to in the SSC discussion. All flights

to Havana apparently carried some freight.-

CIA conducted regular surveillance of Sr ea flights, filing cable

z
reports to Headquarters. There was one (inil

reporting any unusual incidents and providing copies of flight manifests.

The 22 November 1963 Flight

At pages 30, 60, 61 and 103 of Book V of the SSC Final Report,
reference is made to a reported five-hour delay of a Cubana flight from
Mexico City to Havana the evening of President Kennedy's assassination,
22 November 1963. The SSC Report describes the delay as being from
6:00 P.M. EST to 11:00 P.M. EST. The especially intriguing aspect
of the report was that the reported delay was to await arrival at
10:30 P.M. EST of a private twin-engined aircraft, which deposited
an unidentified passenger who boarded the Cubana aircraft without customs
Clearance and traveled to Havana in the pilot's cabin. The SSC Final
Report emphasized CIA's apparent failure to follow up by inquiring

further into the matter.

Book V of the SSC Final Report states that CIA could not explain,
ht the time of the writing of the SSC Report, why there was no record
bf a follow-up. In fact, the SSC was advised that the Mexican authori-
ties were asked about the reported flight delay, although there was no
corded response. The current review revealed additional information
from the surveillance noted above, which bears directly on the subject.
fn reviewing that information below, it is noted that the conversion

bf Mexico City time to Eastern Standard Time (EST) in the SSC Final
Report tends to distort the time perspective somewhat. Mexico City

imes are used in the following discussion.

The following facts stand out, in contrast to the presentation in

1. The Cubana flight was on the ground in Mexico City

delayed five hours, as alleged.
2. The Cubana flight took off at 2035 hours Mexico City

time, 55 minutes ahead of the alleged arrival at 2130 of a
i private flight with a secret passenger. This also contrasts
further with the alleged departure time of the Cubana flight.
which the report stated to be 2200. Actual departure preceded
substantially the reported arrival of the aircraft for which it
allegedly was_delayed. U

In view of the surveillance coverage of.the Cubana flight, it is

: very doubtful that the alleged activity involving the private twin-
‘engined aircraft and passenger would have gone unnoticed or unreported
fad it occurred. Personnel in Mexico City at the time were aware of
‘these sources and probabiy knew the above facts, feeling no need to
follow further. d
: The report in question was in error, and misled the SSC in its
summary of the matter.

i The Passenger on the 27 November 1963 Flight
i At pages 61-63 and 104, the SSC Final Report describes in con-

: siderable detail information concerning a Cuban-American who came to
the attention of the CIA and the FBI in the period following the
Assassination of President Kennedy. The introductory comments of the
sc Final Report state that:

"-. .. one source alleged that the Cuban-American

was ‘involved’ in the assassination."



~ CONFIDEN {lab

The SSC Report states that the CIA reported the case to the FBI “almost
immediately," but that the Bureau did not conduct a follow-up investi-
gation “as part of (its) work for the Warren Commission." Further

down the same page the SSC Report states that "(t)he FBI did investi-

‘ gate this individual after receiving the CIA report of his unusual

travel." At page 63 the SSC Report observes that "...the suspicious
travel of this individual coupled with the possibility that Oswald had
contacted the Tampa chapter (of the Fair Play for Cuba Committee~-FPCC)
certainly should have prompted a far more thorough and timely investi-
gation than the FBI conducted..." We do not know just what the Bureau
did in this respect, nor have we tried to resolve the apparent incon-
sistencies in the SSC Report noted above, but the SSC Final Report
contains considerable detail about the man, presumably reflecting the
results of FBI inquiries.
While this section of the SSC Report is directed primarily at the
FBI, we reviewed the reporting because of CIA's initial role in reporting
about the man. There is also one implicit criticism of CIA, which will
be noted.
Book V of the SSC Final Report has the following summary statement
at page 104, in the chronology section:
“December 5 - Mexico Station cables that someone who
saw the Cuban-American board the aircraft to Havana
on November 27 reported that he ‘looked suspicious'..."
At page 61 it states that there "is no indication that CIA followed-

up on this report (that the man was “involved in the assassination"),

14

14-00000

except to ask a Cuban defector about his knowledge of the Cuban-
American's activities."

The presentation of this matter in the SSC Report contains some
inaccuracies. First, the Mexico City Station did not cable Washington
that the man "looked suspicious." There was a cable, dated 5 December
1963, but it reported that the man had "crossed at Laredo, Texas on
23 November," that he registered at a certain hotel in Mexico City at
a certain time on 25 November, that he chetked out of the hotel at a
certain time and departed for Havana "as only passenger on Cubana
flight on night 27 November ," scampeccoemguigaceyi meagan mummy sss
eID This was followed by a dispatch the same
date, repeating. the basic information in the cable, <q

atin, and containing the following cryptic statement:
"Source states the timing and circumstances surrounding
Subject's travel through Mexico and departure for Havana
are suspicious."
This comment is cryptic, at least, and--given that dramatic moment in
history--doubtless reflects a preliminary comment of a person who
was on the alert at that time for anything that might be construed as
possibly unusual. The above quotation was the Station's actual report
of the observation by the source, and is what was reported to the FBI;
it differs from the quotation in the SSC Report. There was an internal
memo in the Station that was even more cryptic, but which was in the

nature of an informal reminder, which stated that the man was reported



14-00000

to have “looked suspicious"; but this formulation never found its way
into the more careful statements that usually characterize official
reporting. The point is that the observation was cryptic and impres-
sionistic, rather than constituting a tangible basis for dramatic
activity or final conclusions.

There is one piece of reporting that could confuse those reviewing
the record, but which is essentially resolved when considered in the
context of known facts. On 19 March 1964, Monterrey Base cabled
that a source ¢dQelSSisiN:iiiii% ilies it ieee a etn sanys|
Ma had information on a man; the description seems to have the
same Cuban-American in mind. The following should be noted about the
report: it misspelled the man's name; it offered a bare statement
that. he “was involved in Kennedy assassination"; it states that he —
entered Mexico “on foot" from Laredo, Texas (according to the SSC Final
Report, the FBI concluded that he entered by automobile); it asserts
that he stayed at the Cuban Embassy in Mexico City (while the dates and
times of his registration and check-out at a specific hotel in Mexico
City, where he stayed, were known); it gave an incorrect number for his
Passport; and, it stated that his Mexican tourist card was issued
in Nuevo Laredo (when it was known to have been issued in Tampa,
Florida). The report, on its face, was factually incorrect on a number
of known points. The source patently was extensively misinformed, the
hard facts of his report being in error. The Chief of Base at the time,
when queried about the report in the course of the present review, could
not recall it.

There is one additional aspect of the matter, in which the
record is confused. .If we are to comment negatively on the pre-
sentation by the SSC in its emphasis on report, we must point out
that the Mexico City Station's response to the Monterrey report
contributes to such confusion as may exist on the matter. When
Mexico City received the Monterrey cable the Deputy Chief of
Station replied that the information in the report "jibes fully
with that provided Station by (Mexico City source) 4 December 63."
It did not jibe in most respects, other than the date and place of
entry into Mexico. The mistake of that cable cannot be explained
today, but wrong it obviously was. It does, however, serve to
highlight the basic unreliability of the report and indicate how
it should be considered responsibly.

Implicit criticism of CIA's not collecting more information
on the man is not well founded. It had no real sources with access
to information concerning him; when a defector from Cuba became
available with such information he was queried and the results

were provided the authorities.
