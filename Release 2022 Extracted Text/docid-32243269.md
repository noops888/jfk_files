AGENCY FILE

NUMBER

December 8, 1995

Status of Document:

Postponed in Part

Number of releases of previously postponed information: 10

Reason for Board Action: The Review Board's decision was premised on several factors

including: (a) the significant historical interest in the document in question; (b) the

absence of evidence that the release of the information would cause harm to the United

States or to any individual.

Number of Postponements: 5

Postponements: All the postponements in this document represent Social Security numbers.

Reason for Board Action: The text is redacted because the public disclosure of the redaction could

reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, and that invasion of

privacy would be so substantial that it outweighs the public interest.

Substitute Language: SSN

RESUME

Giulia Pat Mainieri - Barrow-Ma.

509 Kentucky Avenue, S. E.

Washington, D. C.

202-546-4912

CAPITOL HILL EXPERIENCE:

January - July, 1971--Glenn M. Anderson of California

Joined

staff

as secretary to the administrative assistant, Harry

Anderson.

Stayed here only six months because I did not find the

work challenging and was losing my skills because I was not using

them enough. Salary was approximately $6,800 to $7,400.

September, 1971 - September, 1975--Office of the Legislative Counsel

Was member of the secretarial pool taking a great deal of shorthand

and typing from 25-30 attorneys. This job was extremely demanding

but was also excellent experience. I left a bit reluctantly to go

to school.

December, 1975 - November, 1976--Richard F. Vander Veen of Michigan

Became member of this staff on a part-time basis. My duties involved

typing letters composed by entire staff except administrative assistant.

Here again, as in the Counsel, I had responsibility for a great deal of

typing, but less shorthand than before. I learned how to work two kinds

of automatic typewriters and was responsible for using them for large-

volume mailings.

Left staff after this seat turned over after election.

Salary approximately $6,500 for a twenty hour week.

PRIOR TO HILL: EXPERIENCE:

March, 1970 - January, 1971--Shering Pharmaceutical Company

Secretary for two product managers, John Moser and Toby Madison. Had

many different responsibilities: filing, typing, shorthand, telephone

calling and answering, making reservations for overseas trips and in-

country trips, and greating business clients. Enjoyed this job greatly.

Salary approximately $6,400.

Personal Information:

Date of birth--October 26, 1950--Houston, Texas

Marital Status--Married, no children

Health--Excellent
