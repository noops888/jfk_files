Late Friday afternoon and through the night a large movement
of troops began here, They were sent to take ip positions

and reinforce strategi¢ positions around Havana and the northern
coast of the island because of the assassingtion of President
KENNEDY. Saturday evening FIDEL CASTRO appeared on television
and spoke about the death of KENNEDY and .tried to: refute charges
which had already appeared inthe United’ States that the assassin
was a Marxist and a Communist Castroite. Although it was only
the third time that I had witnessed a speech by FIDEL, I got the
immediate impression that on this occasion he was: frightened, if
not terrified. Other chiefs of mission, however,-confirmed that
impression and indicated surprise’at this hasty jump into

the arena to denouce insinuations which were merely from

news and nongovernmental agencies. In fact, it is the general
opinion in diplomatic circles: that CASTRO feared that the
assassination would be the spring which would unleash passions
and violent and blind hysteria of the American people against
Cuba and Russia and provide the excuse which up te now was
lacking to justify internationally an invasion of:Cuba. There
is talk again abut the’ coincidence of rumors concerning a
erisis at the end of the year (my letter Nr. 224);

FIDEL, emotional and uneasy, tried through the same
telegrams, of the American news agencies to refute :the accusa-
tions .which were. ‘then appearing and to twist them'so that the
assassination ;would appear as the work of the Ultra Reaction,
of the’extreme' racists of the Pentagon,, who are fanatical
¢ supporters of war against Cuba and the Soviet Union. -

Be that as it may, CASTRO tried-to bring forward any
possible formal accusations against Cuba, clamoring that all
people should demand that the death of KENNEDY should be
clarified and harping on the theme that™ KENNEDY was being
ferociously attacked because of his weak policy against Cuba
and Russia and therefore, his death could not be the work
of Leftists, since it would only benefit the inténtions of the
Ultra Reaction and the Rightists.

I must inform you that the assassination did-not cause
a great deal of consternation in counterrevolutimmary circles
in the interior, disillusioned as they were with the
"weakness" of KENNEDY, especially after his speech in Miami,
from which they expected measures or decisiéns to intervene
in Cuba which would presage the forthcoming end of the
Communist regime of FIDEL CASTRO. on
