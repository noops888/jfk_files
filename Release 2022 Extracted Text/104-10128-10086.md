1. Pursuant to conversation this date, it is requested that
subject be granted permission to take two training courses, namely,
Operational Security Course (15 - 26 November) and Clandestine
Political Warfare Course (29 November — 17 December). These
courses are held in Building T-30.

a broad picture of the activities of this staff. It is believed
