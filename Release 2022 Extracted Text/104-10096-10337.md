2022 RELEASE UNDER THE PRESIDENT JOHN F. KENNEDY ASSASSINATION RECORDS ACT OF 1992

TASK FURCE FILR

MEMORANDUM FOR:

JEW

Shep phoned to say that Janes Wilcott, Jie, a finance

clerk with the Agency from 1957 (50D as GS 1), who served

in lokyo 1960 to October 1964, has told HSCA people that

CIA hired Lee. Harvey Oswald

When Oswald served in Atsugi.

Wilcott, after returning from Tokyo was assigned to MAVE

in 1965, and resigne/retired in 1966.

I noted that Oswald retired from the Marine Corps in

September 1959. and went to the USsR in october that year

returning tote US in June 1902. He was gone from Japar

by the time Shep told me Wilcott got there.

Anything that

Wilcott thinks he knew had to be second hand.. I said that

Russ Holmes inherited the so-called Oswald files, but that

he has assured me the Agency had no contact with Oswald. If

there are contrary records they would have to be in EA files

at TC, and EA should be on it right away to identify what

is involved.

When anything turns up to be checked, O/Fin

should then get at it tight avay. He is after it.
