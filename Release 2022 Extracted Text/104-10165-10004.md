Robin Moore

;

5 a. Moore has just returned frow Viet Nox where ke partici-
pated in the combat operations of the Americau Special Forces iu Viet Naa. after
he had gone throush about eight munths of trainiuz at the Special Forces xchool
at Fort Caupbell, kentucky. Soe understandine of Voore's personality
ontaited frou reading au interview hetween bin aud the mazazine | c
Korld Report. which was published recent]
Yaria, Further understandings and ixpressions of Yoore may te chtained from
reading his previously publistied took about Jack Youngblood. ap American who
participated iu the events leading to Castro's overthrow of Hattista.

b. In my opinion. Moore has a burning desire to be known ;
asa tough, two-fisted. rip roaring soldier of fortune. He has participated
in real war in Viet Naa, and has received what is probably the best traiuing
in the world for guerilla fighters. uanely. the C. S. Special Forces. Tais
includes training as a parachutist. ie is inclired to brax. and is probably
inclined to intecperate use of aleobul and wuren. and his judzenent of in-
portant matters is probably irmature. However. be definitely understands
and is experienced in yuerilla fizating, is experienced in nilitary operations,
and eust surely understand ailitary security.

c. He is definitely willing to help, but cannot contribute

cash directly; is willing to furnish the use of the cuest house on bis property
for liaited periods of ‘time. is willing to participate
to land people on the scuth coast of Cuba, tut is cot
of his property acd facilities as a stagiug area for resupply in the future.

d. Is willing to cone to Miasi, for coufereuces if his
expenses are paid.

2. Site B

uation

a. Blue Hole is an excellent bartor; protected against
all weather. and with six feet of water at tae bar. Is surrounded by very
steep slopes, heavily woded. Dock facilities are presently very neager,
But could be quickly and easily improved. \o iuei for a boat iisbie
at Blue Hole, aud at Fort Antonio (the closest source). the fuel available
is diese} fuel or automotive gasoline; uo warice white gasoline is available
auywhere ia the area. This is a most significant factor in selecting a
suitable boat.

bl The nearest source of food aud other supplies is Port |
Autonio; Fred Barrett. manager of the Blue Lazoon Club. orders and hauls i
supplies frou Port Autouio coustantly, and could deliver whatever supplies
were desired, Firearms and explosives are not obtainable on the island. =;
They would have to be smuggled in illegally.

ce. A small statiou wagon i's available for transportation,

provided expenses are paid by users. Hani

bh. The S.S. Frangeliue sails every tvo weeks from ‘Vieni /

even a toat to Hobiu ore.

c. Fred Rarreti, manager of ‘the bar-restaur nt. sees to
be a very capable mau. and for an additional 310 per week added to iz regular
pay. would be quite willing to assist any operation, i

4. Aur. Anthony Gason. a retired British aray colonel, |
is the Jamaica representative 1 TROJAN boats, at a place called Turtle Cove,
between Port Antonio aud Blue dole.

e. The immigration chief for Jacuica is a nan ty the nane-
of George Eubcuks. wio is the former chief of police at Port Antonio: ‘ore
claims that they are very close pereoual friends.

a. Moore is acquainted with a ran by the name of “ike Hedges,
who is a nephew of Burke Hedges. the t:erican who becurs Cuba's actassador to
Chile scme years ago. ‘ike lives in Kingston, and. if he is nat 9 battista
sympathizer. might prove to be a very valuable connection, The fazily is re-
ported io be quite wealthy, and vould establish an excellent cover.

4. Operational Considerations 3

a. In order to avoid the use of sicnificant names. T
Tustracted Moore to refer to Manolo as George Linz. and the operatias of
Janding him in Cuba would be referred to as Gperatiouking. The vest likely
acheme seems to be to establish a suitable boat aul Blue liole. sith ike cover _
story to be that it telongs to \serican friewds of Robin Moore. Housnz is
available locally for a limited ember of Cutans, with Moore being able to
accomodate up to six on his own property. The local boat captain, Georme
Munroe. could be employed as captain initially. to, train the Cuban crew in
the local warine conditions, as weli as serviug a5 au effective cover. In
ny opinion, it will tot be too difficult for persons to enter Jamaica without,
difficults, provided ihey know a certain ninivum amount of English. i

“

Y think a suitable locatisn could te found for redio i
transaission and reception facilities on the aills surrounding Blue ‘ols. bud
this would have to be examined by someone skilled in radio techniques. ‘ated

would be excellent. |

In summary, I wuld that Robin Moore aud his property and!
buildinzs et Blue Hole would servé as an excellent tase of operations. but tat
the boat necessary for the operation wuld have to be acquired and equipped
in the states and shipped down there, except for the renote pussibility that;
as Le boat could be found in khincston. T think a headquarters could be;

tablished at small cost through Moore's good offices, and I think that Rud:
would be a good choice to coordinate the initial operations there,
