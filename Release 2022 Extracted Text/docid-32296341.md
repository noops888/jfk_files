On July 27, 1962, AARON M. KOHN, Managing
Director, Metropolitan Crime Commission of New Orleans,
Inc., advised that he had developed information that
within the past several weeks JOSEPH MARCELLO and NICK
MOSCA had taken over the operation of the Elmwood Planta-
tion, 5400 River Road, Jefferson Parish.

It is the personal knowledge of Agents of the
New Orleans Office that the Elmwood Plantation has, for
the past eight years, been a moderately-priced restaurant
of good reputation, catering particularly to ladies’ bridge
groups and ladies' club luncheons.

It has been previously reported that NOLA
Printing Company, 530 Iris Avenue, Jefferson Parish,
Louisiana, ceased operating as a race wire service on
September 13, 1961. This company still publishes the
Daily Sports Bulletin, which contains scratch information
on horses running at various tracks throughout the United
States,

In 1948, CARLOS MARCELLO was interviewed by
Agents of the FBI. At that time, he advised he purchased
the New Southport Club in Jefferson Parish in the Summer
of 1948 for $160,000.00 and that this club was a gambling
establishment.

This office has under investigation the activities
of a. gambling casino in Jefferson Parish in the case captioned,
"ALBERT J, SALZER, ET AL; THE CHESTERFIELD CLUB, ITAR-GAMBLING,"
Investigation has revealed that The Chesterfield Club located
in Jefferson Parish operates casino-type gambling consisting
of roulette, dice and blackjack.
