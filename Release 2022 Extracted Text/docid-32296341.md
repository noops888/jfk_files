on July 27, 1962, AARON M. KOHN, Managing

Director, Metropolitan Crime Commission of New Orleans,

Inc., advised that he had developed information that

within the past several weeks JOSEPH MARCELLO and NICK

MOSCA had taken over the operation of the Elmwood Planta-

tion,

5400 River Road, Jefferson Parish.

It is the personal knowledge of Agents of the

New Orleans Office that the Elwood Plantation has, for

the past eight years, been a moderately-priced restaurant

of good reputation, catering particularly to ladies' bridge

to 4 dosa nate

groups and ladies'

club luncheons.

It has been previously reported that NOLA

Printing Company, 530 Iris Avenue, Jefferson Parish,

Louisiana, ceased operating as a race wire service

September

on

This company still publishes the

Daily Sports Bulletin, which contains scratch information

on horses running at various tracks throughout the United

States.

In 1948, CARLOS MARCELLO was interviewed by

Agents of the FBI.

At that time, he advised he purchased

the New Southport Club in Jefferson Parish in the Summer

of 1948 for $160,000.00 and that this club was a gambling

establishment.
