Mr. BERNARD POSS, 503 South Fourth Street, Aurora, :
operator of the Valley Music Company, 164 North Farnsworth,
Aurora, advised SAs PAUL B. FRANKFURT and HOWARD A,

CARLSON on August 12, 1958, that he has been in the jukebox
business for approximately twenty years. He commented that
he operates about 250:;jukéboxes at the present time. Mr.
POSS furnished the following information regarding efforts
by the crime syndicate to "muscle" into Kane. County:

Shortly before Labor Day, 1956, ROCKY PRANO YW
called on him in person at his office, and said that
his "boss" wanted to see him at his office. PRANO did
not say who his boss was or why he wanted to see him,
Thereafter on the Thursday before Labor Day, 1956, he
drove to the Moose Lodge in Naperville (where he has a
jukebox), and met ROCKY PRANO and drove in PRANO's car
to the Lilac Lodge on Wolf and Cermak Roads.

He said they went into the Lilac Lodge and had
a drink but noted there were scarcely any customers at
the bar, and the parking lot was empty. POSS said that
. PRANO felt sure his boss would be along shortly; however,
- POSS stated he became uneasy because this did not appear
to be an office to him, and after their drink went out
and sat in PRANO's car.

POSS stated that suddenly three men appeared
_ alongside the car, two obviously bodyguards for the third
individual, who was a little man wearing dark glasses,
smooth face, and in the middle forties or early fifties.
POSS stated he did not hear any order to drive, but PRANO
started to drive the car away and when POSS asked about
driving away he said that was an order from the boss,

POSS stated they drove around various roads
including York Road where he had heard gangsters had been
"taken for a ride". POSS stated this made him still more
uneasy, and he decided to give the appearance of "going
along" with any suggestions they would make. He said the
"boss" asked him how many jukeboxes he had, and POSS told
him and then was told by the boss, "We're going to make
you a lot of money with books and slots." He said in
order to stall them off he told them he could not give
them a definite answer then as he was going to the lakes
for three days and for them to see him upon his return
next Tuesday to discuss the matter further. He said that
he was not harmed on the ride and was returned to his
automobile.

Upon returning to Aurora, he immediately called
Sheriff HOWARD KELLETT and told him of his recent ride,
and asked advice as to how to cope with the situation.
Between them it was decided to tell the "musclemen" that
he had a silent partner who would not go for’ their deal
and that, therefore, it was all off. At this point, Mr.
POSS was shown several photographs and he picked out the i
Photograph of SAM GIANCANA as closely resembling the
"boss" when he was taken on a ride. He said PRANO
did return to his office and was advised as stated above.
He stated that after this he was visited by RALPH KELLY
of Elgin, Illinois, who told him he hated to'do this but
it was an order that he, POSS, get out of business.

Shortly thereafter CLARENCE LAMBERT, 75 South
Chestnut, Aurora, came to his home with a similar type
message. POSS stated he had made no effort to go out
of business and had no further trouble until several \
weeks later when he began receiving anonymous phone calls. 7
POSS stated that although he could not prove who the i
caller was he felt sure it’ was ROCKY PRANO, as he recognized
his voice. In these phone calls he was told they had
found out that he did not have a silent partner, and that |
ler if he did not go out of business they would break both of =
his legs with a baseball bat, and if he lived he would be
a cripple for life. One of these threatening calls was
received by his wife after which she became hysterical i
and it was necassary for him to send her to Florida for
three or four weeks to recuperate.

Mr. POSS stated that he continued in business
despite these threats. The next step against him was
the destruction of some of his equipment at the following
locations:

Half Moon Tavern, Route 64, second tavern
west of city limits of St. Charles;

Club Moderne, Alternate 30, two miles
east of. Geneva;

Peter De King, Jr., Route 25, Aurora Avenue,
North of Aurora. é

At these locations two men entered with one
wielding a gun and one an ax. While the location owners
were menaced with the gun their equipment was demolished
with an ax, resulting in a. total loss of one pool game,
one shuffle alley, and three pin ballmachines. He
said at the Half Moon Tavern this incident was witnessed

“by the: wife of BERNARD BAILEY, who owned the tavern at

that time, and by BAILEY's partner, HARRY, last name
unknown, and his wife. _ At the Club Moderne only the
wife of STANLEY PATEK was a witness to the axing. At
Peter De King's tavern, he was not certain as to the
witnesses. . He was of the opinion that the. damage

done to these machines was over a period of about ten
days during early 1957. He specifically recalled that
the damage to PETER DE KING was done on a Sunday night.

POSS stated he knew PRANO under the name of
ROCKY. MARTEL until the time of his arrest, when he used
the name of PRANO, He stated he had also used the
name of ROCKY BARTEL,

POSS further added that at the time of his
ride, frequent references were made to the fact that
"they" had invésted heavily in the county and he has
told this to the State's Attorney, the local judge, and
the Kane County Grand Jury, but no action has been taken.

POSS stated that he has been subpoenaed by
the Senate Select Committee, and while he is not happy
about appearing before it, especially on television,
he will testify reluctantly to the events as related
above, : :

POSS further stated that he does not purchase
any of his jukeboxes or records from out of the state.
