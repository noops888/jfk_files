Nr:

Representatives' from all states: to President KENNEDY's

funeral, scheduled for Monday noon, lnclude Heags of State,

Prime Ministers or Foreign Ministers!

• In view of this and

protocol involved, • I consider

delegation inadequate

and would humbly advise that consideting your own personal

friendship with the KENNEDY's, that you send the Foreign

Minister of Speaker of the National Assembly or Minister

Chief of Protocol, to give prestige and political

importance to your representation.

President KENNEDY's interest

in

and his personal regard for you was such, that I feel

a ministerial representation at his burial weuld be greatly

appreciated by Mrs. KENNEDY and the administration and further

strengthen good relations between

and the United States.

I should be most relieved if you would graciously and

favorably consider my

suggestion.

Representatives should catch

Sunday's Pan American flight due here same night.
