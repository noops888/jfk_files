CSIHRG, JFK Project Officer
SUBJECT: Records Briefing for ARRB Staff
REFERENCE: ARRB letter to DCI, dtd. 27 November, 1997, RE CIA Compliance

with the JFK Assassination Records Collection Act.

1. The JFK Board (ARRB) has requested briefings by records “specialists” on the Agency's records systems as part of the
compliance with the JFK Act process (see reference) for its staff. The first DO briefing took place on 12 February. The DA briefing and
a follow-up DO briefing is planed for early March. | would like to set up the remaining briefings as soon as possible.

2. The ARRB:staffers are very familar with agency documents and have had several general breifings on Agency records; one
member of the staff is a former Agency employee (CTC). These “compliance” briefings should focus on what files would have existed in
the 1958-63 time period and how we search, or account for, thosa records today. The ARRB requests you have been working on give
you sorte sense of the type of information they are interested in. In addition | am faxing a copy of the “talking points” prepared for the
DO briefing. hava also ask Jeremy Gunn, ARRB General Counsel, to provide a list.of Directorate specific topics.

3. Tha briefing can take place at HO or at IP. The ARRB attendees will include Mr. Gunn and 4 or 5 members of the Board's
CIA team; all are fully cleared (SCI)_
