4. Bill Kent reported from Miami that Rojas is working with

Manuel Brana and in New York with Jose Antonio Mestre, alias Joso

Agustine Mendez. Rojas talked to Mr.. White and Mr. Hopkins of the

White House Staff in Pennsylvania recently.

5. AMCLATTER-1 also reported that Tony Varona said he was

dealing with Eduardo Gonzalez, a Rescate man in New York, who was

bringing down 300 people from New York in addition to the unspecified

number of people coming from Miami.

6. AMCLATTER-I commented that when Rasco found out about

the proposed trip he called the MDE representative, name unknown,

In New York and told him to are that the movement was stopped since

it was not FRD-sponsored. Eduardo Gonzalez called Varona to try to

get the MDC representative to lay off, which Tony did, assuring. Rasco

Mr. Stanulle suggested that Mr. Barnes should make it quite

clear in any conversationa at the White Mouss that we seriously dowbt

that at this stage Varona or anyone else can exerl very much control

if the delegation comes to Washington. This seems obvioua since by

now not only does it seem that several groups in addition to Varona'g

were initiaily involved in the organisation of the cavalcade but others

may well try to get into the act.

We have been promined through the Bender channel more

precise Information on whon the cavalcade will arrive but given the

somewhat confusud picture one cannot count on receiving advarco

word.
