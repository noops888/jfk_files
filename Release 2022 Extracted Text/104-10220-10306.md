MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT: Cuban Delegation Planning to Come to Washington
SM At 1730 hours 12 January Mr. Barnes was given 4 summary

of our present information concorning subject, which consisted of the
following items: /,. 7Z<. forges Of Chee Cov WEED ee

a. To thank Presidont Eisenhower for the $1,000,000
roliéf fund made available for Cuban rofugeos,

: b, To thank the Peruvian Ambassador for the break
i in relations between Peru and Cuba,

: c, To try to get an audience with the OAS in order
: to influence other Latin American countrien to break
relations with Guba,

2. According to a Bender source (AMCLATTER-1) who tatked
with Tony Varona, Varona considers this a completely unilaterat
operation, i.e,, an Autentico Party operation, Jt was arranged by
Tony through one Ernesté Rojas who contacted White House officiale
Hopkins and White, Also involved are Manolo Bratia, Jose Antonto

| Mgestre and.an MRR mat’ namod Jose Antonio Mendez, (AMCLATTER-1
also mentioned a (fnu) Manolin Hernandez, a wealthy sugar man
connected with the Reforma Central;) AMCLATTER-1 had no
information concerning the size of the group although catimates seem
to run from a few hundred to about a thousand,

3, From Mr. Jacobs we hear that Rojas is an unofficial delegate
of AMBIDDY and lives at 6711 Glencarlyn Drive, Lake Barcroft, Falla
Church, J&fferaon 2-5598, A call to this aumber was answered by
Rojas' wife who said yea, he iy connected with the matter of 1,000
signatures for presentation to Eisenhower,



4, Bill Kent reported from Miami that Rojas is working with
Manuel Brana and in New York with Jose Antonio Mestre, alias Jos
Agustine Mendez, Rojas talked to Mr. White and Mr. Hopkins of the
White House Staff in Pennaylvania recently.

5. AMCLATTER-1 also reported that Tony Varona said he was
dealing with Eduardo Gonzalez, a Rescate man in New York, who was
bringing down 300 people from New York in addition to the unspecified
number of people coming from Miami,

6, AMCLATTER-1 commented that when Rasco found out about
the proposed trip he called the MDC representative, name unknown,
in New York and told him to see that the movement was stopped since
it waa not FRD-sponsored. Eduardo Gonzalez called Varona to try to
get the MDC representative to lay off, which Tony did, assuring, Rasco
that this was hia own personal operation.

: 7. Mr, Stanulie suggested.that Mr, Barnes should make it quite
‘clear tn any conversationa at the White House that we seriously doubt
that at thie stage Varona or anyone else can exert very much control
if the, delegation ecmes to Washington, This seems obvious since by
now not only does it avem that several groups in addition to Varona's
were initially involved in tho organization of the cavalcade but others
may well try to get into the act,

8. We have been promised through the Bender channel more
precise information on when the cavalcade will arrive but given the
somewhat confused picture one cannot count on receiving advance

word,
