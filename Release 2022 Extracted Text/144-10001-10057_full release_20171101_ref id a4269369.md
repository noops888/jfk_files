Dear Mr. Rankin; °

Skilled eryptologists at NSA: ee examined the imateriale
relating to the Lee Harvey Oswald case provided by the Warren Com-.
mission, ‘The results:are as follows:

a. A detailed examination of the two dictionaries jeveale
no indication of thelr use for aryptographic Purposes,

b.. In the ees the Oswald Diary, and the o
documest 8 examined-thero- were no evidences of: the use of any type
of cryptography, to ‘include the use of. an 1 open code, 8 5

position to one of the letters removed from page 152, It was con~
cluded that this letter had been accidently removed by the cutting

.process applied to page 152 and that its removal resulted from the

application of excessive pressure on the cutting tool-when the letter
on page 152 wag taken out.

The sample is considered too small for any valid conclusions to
be reached as to the purposes for which the above noted letters were
removed. It ig considered most unlikely that this process of letter
removal has any cryptographic implication. .

d. The Russian “Tourtst” portable radio was examined for
eryptologic evidence. The radio appears to be @ normal receiver and
there was no evidence of its use for any cther purpose.

e. The names appearing in Lee's and Marina's address
books were checked. .No evidence of cryptologic implication was
found. : : , : et aedaae

Although the results of the examination of the matertals provided
by the Commission are essentially negative, further study of thesa
materials will be made. If any results are obtained, the Commission
will ba advised. However, it-is considered most unlikely that any~
thing beyond what is reported above will be discovered.
