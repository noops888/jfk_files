4. Subject related the events. of 20 May in his small beach
resort’ village as follows:

“At about 10:00 P.M. on Sunday, 20 May, he and his family had
returned to their house, which is. located about three blocks from the
Parque Infantil INIT where the townfolk were dancing and celebrating
this-traditional date. Shortly after arriving, they heard gunfire.
in the general direction of the beach, © This was described as mixed -
automatic fire and single shots. © “There was much shouting and coutuete
in the streets of the town near the park,’ tnd itt just about _. :

“Prior to departure Varadero, however, had to visit the
Militia Post to turnover the keys to his hdUsé and process his de-
parture. During a forty-minute wait there, he overheard conversations
among the officers. From these conversations, it was apparent that
the Militia patrol encountering the beach operation reported the clash
as “escapees”: that two or mor> were Killed and the bodies taken with
the other escapees: that there were no.militia casaulties; that there
was no inkling that an infiltration operation had taken place prior

to the patrol encounter."

“When queried as to militia casualties since the DRE had reported
that at least two had been "dropped" on the beach, subject commented
that ‘one does not shoot a militiaman down that easy. That they
just dropping to the ground at the slightest sign of action’,
was certain that if as much as one man had been scratched the
‘wholé town would have known about it by «orning.”

5. as very vague and lacked details concerning his knowledg|
of propaganda”in Cuba, He recalled that the radio program with Juan

AMADOR: Rodriguez on longwave at midday was popular and heard by many
of the townfolk. He remarked that they listen to a 5:00 AM and 12:00
noon shortwave program coming from Key West, and finally, that the
Voice of America shortwave broadcasts were very effective in his
region. He never tuned in to Radio Las Americas and instantly associatpd

it with the former “Radio Swan” repeating the usual hearsay that "it

was discredited".

6. Although subject wag obvicusly not a good source for military
OB or other intelligence observations, he did provide sore fragmentary f. 5:
Information on his arva, He described a place known as’ Lomas Finns, *
located between Cardenas and Coliseo (10 miles South) pointed out on
the map tg be about 2256N-81188, “There is a Nilitin Post there with E
about 500land 600 stationed there for short periods... He observed some
tank movement, about six to eight tanks t cling in and out of this fe
area at a time, but could not describe them as to type or size. - He‘
described-the militia personnel in this region as a "Very low type"
_ef Cuban which was disgusting to the Toca] country people and there
was continyous friction, He commented that it was just such camps or
post ae. this that. turned the general population into oppositionists.

7. About 17 or 18 May, subject observed a large freighter unload
ing cargo in Matanzas harbor. The local people described it as Russ 18:
and subject could not confirm or deny this. The shipment was large,

however, and in various size crates that were trucked out of the dock
areca in large convoys. s

8, Near a village known as Palmillas (2238N-8045W) about 10 mile
Southeast of Colon, Province of Matanzas, subject reports that there
are: two ‘guerrilla Bands of twelve to twenty met each, During 15 to 17
May, these bands attagted farms occupied -by militia, killing one
militiaman and running the others off the farm. They burned the house,|
barns and destroyed the farm equipment.

9, Again on the 18th of Way, one of these bands attacked another
militia post and killed one militia, This particular incident came fre

10. Subject concluded the interview with some of his opinions
and observations concerning the state of public morale in Cuba today.
He pointed out that much of the population, the “better people” of
the country, understood the United States position on Cuba, (The
implication being the reason for United States fnilure to take direct
action or intervention in Cuba.) He said the people understand that
CASTRO is their own doing. and that the United States cannot be held
responsible for his presence. He described the greater part of the
populace as sick ‘and tired, undernourished, disgusted with blatant
propaganda lies, terrorized by repression but ultimately disposed to
resist at all costs. That if avms-were generally available among the
populace, especially rifles and ammunition for them, CASTRO would have
Poet overthrown by now, without a bit of outside help. That the farme
and some city folk, in desperation, leave their homes to join the
guerrilla bands with no hope for supply and many times turned down by
guerrilla leaders who cannot supply their own band as it is. Subject
departed with the reminder that the "Cubans traditionally prefer to
live good or not live at all.”
