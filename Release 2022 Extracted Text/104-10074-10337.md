SUBJECT: Signund EISENSCHER (NL) /

1.

A sensitive source has reported that one

EISENCHER of the

Communist Party of the United States

of America (CPUSA) , his wife, and one Leon LNU were

vacationing in Sochi, U.S.S.R., during August-September

1970. (Comment: EISENCHER/is probably identical with

EISENSCHER) •" Leon LNU. is probably identical with Leon

LOVE (Bureau file number 101-5112).

2:

According to EISENSCHER the CPUSA has close to

14,000

members, the majority of whom are laborers.

Over 25 percent of the members are blacks who function

basically in the North American black movenent.

The

Party has recently organized a young Communist movement.

(Comment: This is probably the Young Workers Liberation

League.). The CPUSA participates heavily in the labor

movement. At a recent (unnamed) labor meeting of repre-

sentatives from various regions of the United States, the

CPUSA had direct influence in 26 of the 50 unions repre-

sented.

The magazine Labor Party plays an important role

in coordinating movements within the labor ranks. Despite

nunerous barriers (sic), the CPUSA is concentrating its

efforts in Chicago, Los

Angeles, and New York, as well as

other fegions of importance.

The CPUSA has recently

adopted a common strategy towards the peace movement.

(Comment: The indication here is that the Party did not

previously have a unified approach.)

3. EISENSCHER stated that criticisms of the Soviet

Union by the radical left Maoists, Fidelists, and Trot-

skyites cause problems, but they appear to have abated

somewhat.

There has been a warming in the relations

between

the CPUSA and the Comnunist Party of Cuba as
