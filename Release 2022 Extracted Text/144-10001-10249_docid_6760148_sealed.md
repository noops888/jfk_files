MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD fie 28 November 1978 1

SUBJECT: Visit to House Select Committtee on Assassinations

1. On 21 November I visited House Select Committee on Assassinations
Spaces to review for classificatioy purposes the report Messrs Cornwell
and Klein wrote following the 17 November interview with Sgt Nicholas B.
Stevenson, USAF. .

2. The report, about one,tand a half pages long, listed the participants
in the interview and described generally the substance of the discussions.
Although it did not mention the specific site to which Sgt Stevenson and
Mr. Christensen were assigngd, it did say that the facility was able to
collect the tiebor ne hink. The report further mentioned "intercept"
and "NSA" in several places.

3. I told Mr. Cornwell that as written, portions of the report should
be classified "CONFIDENTIAL, HANDLE VIA COMINT CHANNELS ONLY." He agreed
to classify it and asked me to mark it which I did. JI suggested that with
a few changes we could make it unclassified. Mr. Cornwell stated that he
would prefer to retain the original language of the report at this time
but that if it was to be used in any unclassified report by the Committee,
he would then ask us to review the wording so that classified information
would not be disclosed.

4. Mr. Cornwell asked if NSA had determined whether the conversation
Mr. Christensen referenced had been published and disseminated in product
channels.- I told him that we had not yet determined the answer to that
question and that we would be back in touch.
