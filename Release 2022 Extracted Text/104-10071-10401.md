Researtso:

Our files on Martin Luther King reveal

that after King's killing that an attenot was made

locata the siller, initially suspected to be one

GALI but later louai to be ones Earl Pay, in varions

countries mere it vas suspected he night hava fled

There is no written request from the FBI to do this

but i lber had a nunser of comersations with ir.

Panich of the FaT unich are reterred to in our files.

It would be reasonable to assaur conclude that our

eliort to locate Bay was done in close coordination

with the PEt and probably at the iRl's spacific reghest

i check ci our files afber the killing revealed

nothing on Pay prior to the killing of King.

JR

FOLD HERE TO RETURN TO SENDER.
