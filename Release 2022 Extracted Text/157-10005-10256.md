PURPOSE

To collect intelligence required for the
Operations, to identify and earmark in-
telligence assets as refugees arrive,
and to provide security against Com-
munist agent operation: oe

To up-date NIE 85-62, so that current
estimates can be considered at national
policy levels.

To cripple Cuba's rail transportation.

CONSIDERATIONS

This operation, in response to early recommendation
as essential by the Chief of Operations, is moving at
utmost speed to become fully active by 15 March, with
a new building completed and occupied, ane with a

.staff of 43 at work, Operations commenced 15 February

and, as of 9 March, 33 people were active at the Center,
(CIA responsibility, with support by Defense, Justice,
State, USIA.}

As the operations develop, there will be both increased
intelligence collection and a need for as current an In-
telligence Estimate as the U.S. can produce meaningfully.
It is likely that a more informal method of producing an
Intelligence Estimate for use at the national level (than
now governing the issuance of NIE's} may have to be
followed. CLA is now publishing daily intelligence sum-
maries on Cuba and is planning a bi-monthly or weekly
Teport summing up intelligence for this purpose. (CIA
responsibility, with support of others as required, }
ssistance is required to undertake a successful
Sabotage of Cuban locomotives, throigh contaminating
It is expected that a minimum of 3 months
is required before lpcomotives in Cuba start breaking
down, once the contaminant is introduced.

PURPOSE

To collect intelligence.

To ready agent operations
edt

To exploit the intelligence possi-
bilities of former residents of
Cuba (including U.S. citizens} now
in the United States.

To collect intelligence in a Latin
atmosphere, at different levels thar
now seem possible in the continental
U.S,, to spot additional inteNigence
assets and to provide security

against Communist agent operations.

(
CONSIDERATIONS

‘Possible future use in communications and support.

Effectiveness and numbers are dependent upon purpose
of recruitment, nature of training, and policy decisions
controlling these factors. Mf the recruitment and train-
ing are for resistance activities, the task of recruit-
ment and training will be much less difficult than if
they are limited to intelligence -collection purposes
only,

There are "colonies"! in Washington, D.C,, and other
U.S. cities which are "little Cubas." Family, Church,
and business interests provoke unusual personal ties
inside Cuba for some of these residents; a teal potential
exists for collection of intelligence net otherwise avail-+
able. (FBI support and coordination is basic in this
effort.)

As Opa-Locka becomes fully activated, CEA will activate
other interrogation centers as Promptly as feasible. A
center is being activated in Spain. Negotiations with
‘local authorities are being undertaken to activate centers,
if possible, in Mexico City, Caracas, and Aruba. San
Juan, Puerto Rieg, and Santiago, Chile, are being sur-
veyed for possible centers. (C1A responsibility with sup-
port by others as necessary.)
