tivated by 15 March 1962.

TOP SECRET SENSITIVE

PURPOSE

To collect intelligence required for the

operations, to identify and earmark in-

telligence assets as refugees arrive,

and to provide security against Com-

munist agent operations.

Periodic intelligence estid

ates, as required by progress

operations.

To up-date NIE 85-62, so that current

estimates can be considered at national

policy levels.

CONSIDERATIONS

This operation, in response to early recommendation

as essential by the Chief of Operations, is moving at

utmost speed to become fully active by 15 March, with

a new building completed and occupied, and with a

staff of 43 at work. Operations commenced 15 February

and, as of 9 March, 33 people were active at the Center.

(CIA responsibility, with support by Defense, Justice,

State, USIA.)

As the operations develop, there will be both increased

intelligence collection and a need for as current an in-

telligence Estimate as the U.S. can produce meningfully.

It is likely that a more informal method of producing an

Intelligence Estimate for use at the national level (than

TATIARD

PROPERTY Of

THE WHITE HOUSE DEFICI

Effectiveness and numbers are dependent upon purpose

of recruitment, nature of training, and policy decisions

controlling these factors.

If the recruitment and train-

ing are for resistance activities, the task of recruit-

ment and training will be much less difficult than if

they are limited to intelligence-collection purposes

* Develop intelligence potential

a√≠ Cuban "colonies" in U.S.

to exploit the intelligence possi -

bilities of former residents of

Cuba (including U.S. citizens) now

in the United States.

* Develop additional interroga-

ion centers in other areas by

31 March 1962.

To collect intelligence in a Latin

atmosphere, at different levels that:

now seem possible in the continental

U.S., to spot additional intelligence

assets and to provide security

against Communist agent operations.

There are "colonies" in Washington, D.C., and other

U.S. cities which are

"little Cubas," Family, Church,

and business interests provoke unusual personal ties

inside Cuba for some of these residents; a real potential

exists for collection of intelligence not otherwise avail-

able.

(FBI support and coordination is basic in this

effort.)

As Opa-Locka becomes fully activated, CLA will activate

other interrogation centers as promptly as feasible. A

center is being activated in Spain. Negotiations with

local authorities are being undertaken to activate centers,

if possible, in Mexico City, Caracas, and Aruba. San

port by others as necessary.)
