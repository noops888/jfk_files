for training, and also had ordered Lis falier to inform on his friends;
when Ris fether refossd, ths Party expelled hin. Later, in an auto
Diography, subject stated that his father had lert the Party because

FRgHANDSZ Martinez. ‘this "treason" was not further detailed. subject

Results of this review of Subject's file do not support the
allegations made by DIAZ Lanz. Although the two major areas of doubt
reagin somewhat unresolved, the weight of eridence would seen to be
in the Subject's favor.

ve

4,

Agency and Bureau files contain no identifiable record
of Subject's father.

AXTDIMG himself volunteered inforration concerning beth
the cited areas open to possible question. ihe Subject
had every reazon to believe that the information he
volunteared (i.e. that. hin father's @eminion from the
Party was reported in Roy, and that the IiaA meeting
was covered by a reporter from cevolucion) could be
easily verified.) —

The record of AXTDS's polygraph examination stated
that strong polygraph evidence had been obtained that’
Subject was a bong fide anti-castro and anti-Comemist
defector; that Ilia had held a neeting around the
middle of October at which subject was present; aad
that the letter of resignation addressed to Fidel was
written by hin and that it was generally accurate in
reporting the INsA mosting.

There has been no evidence in FI/D that ANTIHE is
other than what he clains to be.

S. Comment.

Dave Morales, JMWAVE/CI, has additionally comented that there

4s no love lost between AX7IMS and DIAZ Lans and that the latter's
allegations against; the former are provably ‘alse. In view of DMZ

Lans' feelings against ARTINE, it is not unlixely that he is endcearor-
ing to buila himself up in the eyes of his case officer by discrediting
