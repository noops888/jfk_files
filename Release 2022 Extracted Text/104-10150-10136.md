Summary of Case

The -NOSENKO case opened.on 5 June 1962:°in the corridors
of the Palais des Nations in Geneva during the United Nations
Disarmament Conference. A Soviet official approached an
American diplomat with the suggestion. that they get together
fora 'talk the following day. The diplomat advised CIA of
the appointment, explaining that he thought the approach: so

a'member of the Soviet. Disarmament Delegation.”

: Later meeting with the American diplomat, the Soviet
*» official identified himself -as NOSENKO. and stated he was a
KGB counterintelligence officer sent to Geneva to ensure the:
security of the Soviet delegation. He knew that the American
» had: previously’ served in Moscow and erroneously believed that
she was the “American Rezident" in Geneva. NOSENKO stated
that. he needed approximately 900. Swiss francs immediately “to
cover. KGB operational funds which he had squandered on
liquor and a prostitute: in Geneva. He offered for this amount
to sell’ two items of information to American Intelligence.
These were the identity ‘of ‘a former American Embassy. employee
in: Moscow who was:a KGB agent "near ciphers" in the Washington
area, and the identity of .a Soviet in Moscow who, although
ostensibly a CIA agent, was actually controlled by, the KGB...
In reply, the American explained that: he was not an intelli-
gence officer, but that he could place NOSENKO in contact
with. an appropriate U.S. official in Geneva later that, same
day. i ‘ : =

travellers to the Soviet Union, NOSENKO.told the CIA officer
of ‘his: financial difficulties and repeated his offér to sell

(Summary of Case)

the two items of‘information. He said that the need tor money
was his immediate mocive for contacting Cla, although in the
ensuing discussion he aiso expressed dissatisfaction with the
Communist regime in the Soviet Union-

NOSENKO met CIA‘ representatives four more times in Geneva
in June 1962. With the second meeting on 11 June, his earlier
expressed reservations disappeared almost entirely. He
answered most questions put to him on KGB organization and
operations. His knowledgeability was almost exciusively
limited to the KGB Second Chief Directorate (responsible for
counterintelligence and security within che USSR). NOSENKO
seemed to be what he claimed to be: a KGB officer ina
sensitive position with knowledge of important KGB operations.

NOSENKO returned to Moscow on 15 June, having promised
to do everything within certain limits to collect information
on matters indicated to be of interest to CIA. The only
restrictions he placed on his cooperation were his absolute
refusal to permit operational contact with him inside the
USSR and his request that no mention of his coilaboration be
communicated to the American Embassy in Moscow. He promised
to notify CIA via an accommodation address when he came to
the West again. ,

NOSENKO again accompanied the Soviet delegation to the
Disarmament Conference in Geneva in January 1964. Since last
meeting with CIA he had been promoted to the rank of lieu-
tenant colonel and had become the Deputy Chief of the largest
department in the Second Chief Directorate. At the first
of the new series of meetings on 23 January he announced
that he had decided to defect to the United States. He
cited as reasons his continuing dissatisfaction with the
Soviet regime and the fact. that he probably would have no
further opportunities to travel to the West in the foresee-
able future. Although he implied that he wanted to defect
as soon as possible, he agreed to remain in place in Geneva
while arrangements for his reception were being made in
Washington. NOSENKO had brought a large amount of new
information, much of it in scribbled notes, on KGB opera-
tional activity which he had collected in the 18 months
since his last meeting with CIA-

On'4 February, four days before the date tentatively
selected for NOSENKO's: defection, he reported that he had
received a cable from KGB Headquarters ordering his immediate

return to Moscow to. participate in’ a KGB conference on - :
foreign tourism to the Soviet. Union. -That night exfiltration |

Top Secret

(Summary of Case)

During NOSENKO's absence from Washington, consultations
were held with the FBI regarding steps to be taken to restrict
his movements and activities. This’ Agency was concerned
that his behavior would attract undesirable attention and
publicity, perhaps police arrest, and that doubts about his
bona fides, which were becoming known to a widening group
in the U.S. Government, might be inadvertently revealed to
NOSENKO himself. The FBI on 1 April indicated ic would
"not interpose objection" to the CIA plan to limit NOSENKO's
.freedom of movement, and the Acting Attorney General, the
Department of State, and the White House were advised.

On 4 April NOSENKO was driven to a new safehouse in a
Washington suburb, and told that this safehouse thenceforward
would be his regular place of residence. Since that time
NOSENKO has had contacts with CIA personnel only, has been
under full-time guard, and has not been permitted access to
news media.

Intensive interrogation of NOSENKO, including a polygraphic
examination, was begun on 4 April 1964 in order to obtain
“information which he had been reluctant to divulge earlier,
and to clarify contradictions in what he had already reported.
The polygraph examination results were inconclusive. This
phase of the interrogations was terminated on 24 April 1964.

Despite the searching nature of the questions and the
implicitly and explicitly expressed doubts of his veracity,
NOSENKO asserted that he was willing to answer, or to try to
answer all questions put to him. Because more information
pertinent to the question of his bona fides was needed, a
new series of interrogations was begun in mid-May 1964.
Different interrogators were introduced and questioning was
resumed in a neutral, non~hostile manner. The period of
neutral questioning continued until mid-November 1964.

After further consultations with the FBI, a round of
hostile interrogations began on 26 January 1965. Between
then and 5 March, NOSENKO was questioned for a total of
about 140 hours by individual interrogators and interrogation
teams, and he was directly challenged on many of his previous
assertions. He admitted that certain of his earlier statements
had been incorrect, and that he could not explain contradictions

(Summary of Case)

in his testimony. Nevertheless, NOSENKO maintained he had
been.basically truthful, and that he-had come to. the United
States solely for the reasons he had originally given.
These interrogations.were suspended on 5 March 1965-

Questioning of. NOSENKO during the summer and autumn of
1964 and the interrogations. of January and February 1965
concentrated on the period of his claimed service in the
American Embassy Section of the American Department; KGB
Second Chief Directorate, from January, 1960 to “January 1962: -
“Among the reasons -for selecting this particular period were. :
the comparatively large amount of collateral information a
available against which NOSENKO's statements could be checked;.”
“the importancé of- the Embassy and its personnel as critical
KGB Second.Chief Directorate targets; their importance from
the standpoint of “American security; and the extent of
NOSENKO's claimed knowledge of the activities of the Embassy
Section, of which he claimed to. have been Deputy Chief. 4

In keeping:with a Soviet practice with which NOSENKO was
familiar, CIA: asked NOSENKO in February 1965 to sign a series.
of interrogation reports, so-called "protocols", most of
which concerned the period: of his claimed. service: in ‘the *
American Department.’*. These were written by the CIA interro-
gators, and they:were designed to, set forth NOSENKO's’ exact: *

“statements and meaning on. various specific subjects. The :
Protocols were in no way presented to NOSENKO ‘as documentary
portions of a."confession", but rather. as distilled and. final
Statements. of what he did and did not know concerning...’ aly

; particular topics. . NOSENKO- was asked to read each page of *
each protocol carefully and:to-sign his name at: the bottom:
to ‘indicate that he understood and agreed with its contents;
he was allowed the use: of a dictionary and was permitted to
ask any questions and make ‘any changes that he wished. ‘A
(Amendments. were: entered by the interrogators ‘and were
initialed. by NOSENKO.) \NOSENKO™-was asked, after reading-
each page and after completing the. entire protocol, whether
he understood what was written there and whether there were
any more changes. he wished to make. ..He was then asked to
sign and date the statement, "I have read and understood
this report and certify it as correct", at’ the end of the

“final page. . With one exception, he -did.so calmly and without -
objections. In one or two instances he remarked that his

Statements were presented in such a manner as to make them

Anything I have signed is absolutely correct. I absolutely

Further questioning was conducted from 26 July until
14 August 1965 with the Participation of Petr DERYABIN, a
former KGB officer. These interrogations, held in Russian,
were for the Purpose of using DERYABIN's KGB experience to
obtain a clearer understanding of NOSENKO's claimed Personal
and professional background.

During the period 19-25 October 1966, NOSENKO was
questioned for seven days on specific aspects of selected
tepics ranging from his identity to his involvement in and
knowledge of specific KGB operations. Questioning was in
both Russian and English. Although the interrogations
identified topics and time periods in NOSENKO's accounts
which contained the greatest number of contradictions and
discrepancies, neither the contradictions nor the discrep-
ancies could be resolved.

Because of the incidence of deranged persons CIA has
encountered among would~be defectors, the question of
NOSENKO'’s mental Stability was a matter considered early
after his defection in Geneva. From his arrival in the
United States in 1964 NOSENKO has been under psychiatric
observation. A CIA Psychiatrist and a CIA psychologist,
both with extensive experience with Soviet Bloc defectors,
monitored many of NOSENKO's interrogations. In May 1965
the Psychologist for three weeks questioned NOSENKO on his
life from birth until 1953, when NOSENKO claimed he joined
the KGB, in an attempt to identify psychological factors
which might underlie NOSENKO's contradictory and inconsistent

observations of NOSENKO to the present time. The psychiatrist
and the psychologist concluded independently, on the basis
of their observations, that NOSENKO was mentally stable.

CHAPTER L

FOUNDATIONS OF NOSENKO'S CLAIMS

Evidence of NOSENKO's bona fides is comprised of his own
statements, the corroborating statements of Soviet officials,
and the counterintelligence information he has provided.

NOSENKO's Statements About Himself

In his meetings in 1962 and 1964 with CIA abroad and in
the course of the interrogations since, NOSENKO has: made
numerous statements about himself. More than any other,
however, a statement written in July 1964 (after the initial
hostile interrogation was concluded) is a thoughtful and
well-expressed exposition of how he wished CIA to regard
him. It is quoted here in its entirety.

My life, my childhood and youth passed in very
comfortable circumstances since the position of
my father gave us. the opportunity to live without
lacking for anything. And the only difficult
periods of my life before the death of my father
were at the naval schools attended in Kuybyshev,
Baku and Leningrad, and at the beginning of my
working life, when I was in the Far East in 1950-
1952, The opportunity. to be always well-dressed,
to have a sufficient amount of money, to have my
own car, to be able to use the car given me by my
family and also my father's car, the opportunity
to travel to the South and to vacation-in the best
sanitariums, dachas, and so forth; all this
unquestionably Iéft its mark on me and became
something of a habit. After the death of my father,
my successful progress in my work gave me a higher
salary, and although I did not have all that which
I had while my father was alive, still I did not
experience any serious difficulties. But already
I wanted to live still better.

Up to 1953,:over the course of my entire life--at

“Stalin was a great genius, that he was good, keen,

successes, when in fact they didn't exist, the
figures about how the USSR had passed the USA in
the production of butter and milk, when in the
stores they were available only infrequently. The
endless promises of a better life when in fact
nothing of the sort is taking place. All this
similarly forced me to re-evaluate not only the
events which were taking place in the country, but
already the entire ideology of the Party, its
external and internal course.

The events in Novocherkassk where 20,000 to
25,000 people rose up and the way in which this
popular indignation was suppressed by troops with
many casualties, This also made a deep impression
on me. When I was resting in the summer of 1961
in Nikolayev, from my relatives--my father's
brothers--I understood well the real relation of
the workers both to the leadership and to the.
Party as a whole. At the same time I saw how the
workers really lived, how they eat, what they have
and what they can buy with their wages.

I heard a great deal from my father about the
domestic policies of Khrushchev in regard to the
development and the course of construction in
industry, about his complete illiteracy in
engineering technology and industrial economics,
about incorrect decisions in regard to many
industries, and this was not only the opinion of
my father, but also of other important leaders in
various fields of industry. But no one dared to
open his mouth and when in December 1955 my father
tried, as an engineer, to prove that a certain
decision would be incorrect, he received such a
rebuff from Khrushchev that he was profoundly
shaken and in the opinion of my mother this brought
him to his illness and death in August 1956.

The events in Germany and especially in Hungary
showed with absolute clarity the bankruptcy of
communist ideology. What was especially important
for me was the fact that in these countries it was a
protest not of individuals or groups, but of the

I entered the Komsomol completely without thinking

about it. The time came, the right age, and I
became a Komsomol member like all the others. It
was different in regards to the Party: I joined
7 the Party in- 1956 after the death of Stalin and

| while I was working in the KGB and already at that

H time there was a lack of faith and indecisiveness

in me. My father continually insisted on this,

pte saying that without the Party I would never move
|| ahead and would not have success in life. But I
myself understood and saw that I would not be able
to work in the KGB unless I was a member of the
Party. And if I worked somewhere else, I would
truly never move ahead in my career unless I entered
paiaaes the Party. But from the very beginning of my entry
q : into the Party, I deeply hated all the Party talmudism

1

and dogmatism. All the Party meetings were literally
a torture. Especially when I became the Deputy’
‘ Chief and then Chief of a section, and then Deputy
gf Chief of a department, because then I had to speak
at these meetings. Because this meant to lie, to
| twist my soul, and to attempt to show myself as
t deeply dedicated to the Party and its course.

In 1960 my oldest girl's asthmatic attacks became
worse. The question of a change of climate was
raised. At that time the Second Chief Directorate
needed to send an officer to Ethiopia for two to
three years to conduct counterintelligence work
among the Soviet specialists there. It cost me a
great deal of effort to personally talk Second Chief
Directorate Chief General GRIBANOV into letting me
go. The Party and work references had been confirmed,
all the questionnaires were already filled out, the
photos had been submitted; that is, all the formal-
ities had been accomplished. But at the very last
moment the Central Personnel Office of the KGB began
to protest against my going with my family to
Ethiopia. The reason for this was that from the
house check made at my place of residence they
received information that I sometimes came home in
a drunken condition and on this ground had quarrels
with my wife. A tour abroad with my family was
necessary because of the health of my daughter

If the defections of [former KGB officers] PETROV,
RASTVOROV and DERYABIN passed without evoking any
particular thoughts, the defection to the United
States of GOLITSYN, whom I had heard of as an
intelligent person and a capable officer, undoubtedly
caused me to think very deeply. Because to act thus,
it is necessary to have not only boldness and
decisiveness, but also great strength of will. And
already I put to myself the question, will I be able
to act thus in view of the dissatisfactions and
disillusionments which had accumulated inside of me?

Being in Geneva in 1962, not long before my
departure I myself of my own desire entered into
contact with you. The reason for this was the loss
of money received by me for operational expenses.

I would have been unable to accumulate such a sum

of money before my departure and there was nobody

: to borrow from. To tell the truth about the loss

B of the money would have meant that it would be
necessary to explain where and in what circumstances

it had been lost. This would have risked expulsion

from the KGB and a serious reprimand from the Party.

Not to tell the truth, to think up some sort of a

story--they wouldn't believe, and worst of all, they

might think that I had appropriated the money, that

is, stolen it. And this would be for me the worst

of all and I would, of course, in such event have

told the truth.

} To tell the truth, it was only after my return
home from Geneva in 1962 that I gradually, not

¥ immediately, began full to realize all'the seriousness

of my contact with you and its full meaning. And

i : although I-did not give you any promises or assurances

about our continued contact in the future, I under-

stood that you sooner or later would set yourself

the task of continuing our contact. And here it was

that weighing up all the reasons and causes which I

Hl have indicated above that in 1962 I took for myself
the decision to leave the USSR at the first opportunity
and that I started to work towards being sent on a

learn of my contact with you. This article deeply
‘interested’ the KGB.

During ‘the closed trial of PENKOVSKIY I got a
pass from the Second Department and went, in order
to look at him myself. For sometimes it is enough
to simply look at a man, to see how he holds himself
and to hear how he speaks in order to form some sort
of an initial opinion of him. Personally, I liked
how PENKOVSKIY held himself at the trial; I liked
his appearance and I understood that everything
which had been said in the KGB about him and the
sort of person they were trying to make him out to
be (that he was morally degraded, that he had
descended and sunk into a swamp) that all this was
nonsense, bluff, and.chatter. And PENKOVSKIY, the
same as GOLITSYN, gave me a feeling of greater
confidence in the correctness of the decision taken
by me to leave the Soviet Union.

The Product of NOSENKO's Debriefing
v

Positive Intelligence Information

At his first meeting with CIA in 1962 NOSENKO asserted
that he was acquainted with Ministers of the Soviet Govern-
ment, who were friends of his father, and he heard what
was said in their circles. His debriefing and interroga-
tions did not bear out his assertion that he was informed
of the attitudes and aims of the Soviet leaders. His
responses to questions about the viability -of the then
Soviet Government, for example, were couched in vague and
general terms and did not reflect any specific knowledge.
From his debriefing it emerged that NOSENKO had spent his
entire adult life either as a student or as a state security
official, and he stressed that since the early 1950's he
had had few interests and "no real contacts" outside of the
KGB itself. Questioned on a wide range of topics, including
various aspects of nuclear weaponry, missiles, electronics,
communications, unconventional weapons, military industry,
military units and equipment, and research and development,
NOSENKO repeatedly said that he had no knowledge of such
matters and that his responses reflected only personal
opinions. Because of his two assignments to Geneva with
the Soviet Delegation to the Disarmament Conference, questions
were put to NOSENKO about Soviet underground testing, Soviet
efforts in the fields of chemical and biological warfare,
Soviet disarmament aims and Soviet views of the corresponding
attitudes and intentions of the United States. Becaueé
his assignments ‘to the Soviet Disarmament Delegation were
for cover purposes only, NOSENKO disclaimed any special
knowledge. He explained that he took no part in the
substantive work of the Delegation nor did he have any
connection in the USSR with officials or organizations
concerned with arms control or disarmament policies.

NOSENKO's failure to provide any useful positive
intelligence information was not unique, although previous
KGB defectors did not have NOSENKO's claimed access, either
on the basis of his family ties or on the basis of his KGB
counterintelligence position within the Soviet Union. KGB

shown to Premier Khrushchev personally. Although still
active, the agent had lost access to classified documents
some months earlier, in 1963. NOSENKO characterized the
lead as the most important single counterintelligence item
that he acquired during the year and a half he was a CIA
collaborator at KGB Headquarters in Moscow.

NOSENKO's Information

Shortly after returning to Moscow from Geneva in 1962,
NOSENKO first learned of a KGB agent's successful penetra-—
tion of a classified documents vault at an "important
American military installation" in the Paris area. Because
the documents included information on strategic targets in
France as well as in the Soviet Union, he assumed that it
was a "strategic planning installation". The installation
had its own airfield and that there were "procedures for
bringing Top Secret documents in and for taking them out".

There had been six successful entries of the vault, four
in 1962 and two in 1963, On each occasion Special Section
technicians travelled TDY to Paris under diplomatic courier
cover to assist the local KGB case officer in the technical
details of the operation. Their function was to advise the
case officer concerning the entry’ to the vault and later
surreptitiously to unwrap and re-seal the documents. The
case officer, on this basis, would give appropriate instruc-
tions to his agent, and the technicians probably never met
the American.

Although this was a First Chief Directorate operation,
officers of the Special Section of the Second Chief
Directorate were used. . The.Special Section was comprised
of technicians transferred from the KGB Operational-
Technical Directorate, and usually it handled surreptitious
entries to Western embassies in Moscow. Among these officers
were S.A. IONOV, L.A. LEBEDEV, S.D. ILYIN, V.V. SINITSYN,
V.Z. KARETNIKOV, M.I. PREOBRAZHENSKIY and Fedor FOFANOV.
IONOV, LEBEDEV and ILYIN took part in this operation, and
FOFANOV was later involved.

The specialists were not the ones that carried out the
operation. It was carried out by the case officers of the
Paris Legal Residency. The specialists just opened and then

The last time the vault was entered was in the fall of
1963. At about that time the agent, a military man,
received a promotion and was relieved of his night watch
duties. (The agent was scheduled for rotation to the
United States but, with his promotion, he had obtained an
extension until May 1964.) Although the agent was still
active in January 1964 and was still assigned to the same
military post, he had lost access to the classified
documents. The information obtained from the agent's vault
was highly sensitive and so valuable to the KGB that the
Paris Legal Rezident as well as several case officers there
had been rewarded for their part in the operation.

Before leaving Moscow for Geneva in January 1964,
NOSENKO had been told that the technician FOFANOV had been
sent to Paris in the KGB hope that the agent would be able
to re-enter the vault again before his transfer to the
United States in May. When NOSENKO visited the Soviet
Embassy in-Paris on 19 January 1964 while‘en route to
Geneva, FOFANOV was on duty at the entrance and NOSENKO

“chatted with him. FOFANOV said he “was not doing good"

and he "would probably be sitting there until May", but
he had hopes "that something might happen".

The American agént was getting paid by the KGB and he
was recruited with the promise of a substantial sum of
money. NOSENKO didn't know if he was recruited in Paris
or if it was even a formal recruitment, nor what plans the
KGB had for him after he left Paris.

NOSENKO learned of the case “in little pieces" at
separate times from various members of the Second Chief
Directorate Special Section who participated in it,
principally LEBEDEV or KARETNIKOV in Moscow, and FOFANOV
later in Paris. | [Under intensive questioning, NOSENKO has

also alleged he learned of the case from IONOV, the Chief

of the Special Section.] NOSENKO explained that he knew
LEBEDEV and KARETNIKOV from their visit to his office to
discuss technical installations at new tourist hotels, when
NOSENKO was Deputy Chief of the Seventh Department.

relevant intelligence of any significance. NOSENKO thought
that "SASHA" served as a department chief in intelligence
when he was re~assigned to Germany in November 1962 -— early
1963.

NOSENKO met SHALYAPIN for the first time in September or
October 1962 [after NOSENKO's first visit to Geneva and
initial contact with CIA] through his friend, Yu. I. GUK.
GUK had known SHALYAPIN when they had served together in
the First Chief Directorate in Moscow. SHALYAPIN had
served in the United States, Uruguay, Berlin, and Cuba. In
1962 he had been assigned to the Latin American Department
of the First Chief Directorate, as a case officer. He
retired from the KGB and through NOSENKO's intervention with
Second Chief Directorate Seventh Department Chief CHELNOKOV,
SHALYAPIN obtained a position with Inturist. Presumably
out of gratitude to NOSENKO, SHALYAPIN felt free to talk,
and over drinks he expressed his bitterness at his treat-
ment by the First Chief Directorate which, without him,
would not have had the agent "SASHA" in Germany "at that
time". [1963]. NOSENKO heard such details as-he knew. of
"SASHA" in.the course of several such talks with. SHALYAPIN.

Under intensive quéstioning on the "SASHA" case NOSENKO
retracted his statement that he had first heard of the case
from SHALYAPIN, though maintaining that he was sure he had
discussed the case with-SHALYAPIN "at some time". Pressed
to identify his first source, NOSENKO then cited several
officers-~-some First Chief Directorate, some Second-who
could have told him about it. because they were likely to
know of it though none of, them was actually involved in the
operation. Ultimately NOSENKO refused to commit himself
on this point, saying he did not remember from whom he first
learned of "SASHA". : F i:

"ANDREY" (Dayle W. SMITH)

When ,contacting CIA in 1962 NOSENKO offered to sell
information about two KGB operations, one of which he knew
only under the KGB cryptonym "ANDREY", a KGB agent recruited
in Moscow in 1949 or 1950 who in 1962 was working in
Washington “near ciphers".

NOSENKO's Information~1962

“ANDREY" was a U.S. Army sergeant who was spotted for the
KGB by "QUEBEC" (Roy RHODES). [RHODES served in Moscow
from April 1951 to July 1953. He dated his own recruitment
by the KGB as January 1952.] RHODES was still in Moscow
when "ANDREY" was recruited by the Second Chief Directorate,
although RHODES was not aware of "ANDREY's" recruitment.

The KGB approach to "ANDREY" was based on “women and money".

“ANDREY" worked satisfactorily in Moscow for the KGB,
providing “materials" and information on ciphers. He
promised that he would ‘cooperate with the- KGB in future
assignments abroad, but would not work with them in the

_ United States as he did not want to "sit in the electric

chair". He was paid well for his cooperation in Moscow.

The KGB wanted to pay him more but he refused; he said he
could not plausibly explain the possession of ‘too much
money. When the KGB offéred him diamonds and other gems for
later sale, he did not take them, telling his case officers
that possession could arouse the attention of the American
police. In 1950 the agent left Moscow for the United
States. The KGB waited for him to reappear in some other
country, but he did not. Finally, in 1955, the KGB sent
V.M. KOVSHUK, the then-Chief of the American Embassy Section
of the Second Chief Directorate, and a participant in.
"ANDREY's" recruitment in Moscow, to the United States to
find the agent. KOVSHUK travelled under the alias "KOMAROV",
under the cover of either Second or Third Secretary of the
Soviet Embassy in Washington.

KOVSHUK, with the’ help of the KGB Legal Residency in

“the beginning of 1956. .KOVSHUK’ had looked’ for hima. long

RHODES. Little by little, however, "ANDREY" resumed his
meetings with the KGB, "having little other choice".

KOVSHUK turned "ANDREY" over to a member of the Washington
Legal Residency and returned to Moscow. NOSENKO did not
know who succeéded KOVSHUK as the handler, but KOVSHUK's
successor eventually turned the case over to N.G. BAGRICHEV,
who concluded his tour in Washington in 1961. NOSENKO. did
not know BAGRICHEV's successor, but asserted that there
must have been one since. “ANDREY" was still working with
the KGB in 1962.

NOSENKO's Information-1964

While continuing to associate "ANDREY's" recruitment
with RHODES' presence in Moscow, NOSENKO in different
discussions of the case asserted that. "ANDREY" was recruited
in "1948-1949", “in'1952 or earlier", or "in 1953".

“ANDREY" had been recruited by KOVSHUK and N.M. BORODIN.
After returning to the United States, "ANDREY" worked at
the Pentagon, "in codes", but by the time KOVSHUK recontacted
him in the United States he was néaring the end of his
enlistment, and he was working.in an Army recruiting office.
He was still working in the recruiting office when BAGRICHEV
took over the case from KOVSHUK. ~

It was not RHODES' trial at which “ANDREY" appeared, but
he was among persons called during the pre-trial investigation.
“ANDREY" was called just once, and he was scared to death.
“ANDREY" did not testify at the RHODES trial.

In Moscow, "ANDREY" had explained to the KGB how the code
machines in the Embassy-worked and may have given the KGB
parts of code machines such as "dises" [sic, meaning rotors].
Aleksandr SELEZNEV, a deputy department chief-in the
Communications Directorate of the KGB, had been involved in
the “ANDREY" case: ‘NOSENKO first saw him in 1953 during the
period that "ANDREY" was working for the KGB in Moscow.
SELEZNEV came to meetings in the American Department to
discuss and plan KGB meetings with "ANDREY". The reason for
SELEZNEV's presence was that the case officers were not
technical specialists, and SELEZNEV would supply them with

questions to be asked of “ANDREY". -Since SELEZNEV came to
these meetings’.in civilian clothes, whereas NOSENKO later
saw him in.uniform in his visits to the, American Department,
NOSENKO speculated that’ SELEZNEV may have attended some of
the meetings with .‘ANDREY". | Although NOSENKO did not know

how the KGB exploited him, he repeatedly emphasized "ANDREY's"

great. importance to the KGB during the. time he worked for
them in Moscow.,.."Thanks' to his help. they were able to read

1957, where he met KGB officers regularly
until September 1962. He identified by photo-

NOSENKO as having taken part in the operation.
NOSENKO "cannot be certain" that he did not
know about "ANDREY" while he served in the
Embassy Section in 1953-1955, and when pressed
to describe specifically the source of his
information, he invariably indicated that he
learned of the American agent later, informally
from KGB colleagues. !

Edward Ellis SMITH
NOSENKO's Information

In. the context of a-1962 discussion of KGB operations
against the American Embassy in Moscow, NOSENKO was askéd
whether he knew "about SMITH". “He answered: "SMITH?. The
red-head.° Listen, he headed the FBI, he.was a colonel and
headed counterintelligence." NOSENKO went on to describe
the mounting of a blackmail operation, of which he was
the. case officer, against SMITH (whose KGB cryptonym was
"RYZHIY", or "REDHEAD").

SMITH had been sleeping with his Russian housemaid, who
was an agent planted on him by the KGB. When the KGB was
unable to obtain actual incriminating photographs, she was
instructed to take photographs of herself on SMITH's bed.
These were then combined with photographs of SMITH to
produce photomontages, copies of which were delivered to
SMITH together with a letter inviting him'to a meeting with
the KGB. SMITH came. The KGB was represented at. the
meeting. by GRIBANOV, NOSENKO and one other officer. At
this initial meeting SMITH was not interrogated nor asked
for classified information. SMITH agreed to come to further

meetings.

Top Secret

(FOUNDATION OF NOSENKO'S CLAIMS)

When SMITH did not come to the next scheduled meeting
with GRIBANOV, NOSENKO sought out the maid to find out what
had happened. She reported that SMITH was in a state of
desperate indecision; he had paced his room all night as
if his mood was alternating between despair and defiance.

To increase the pressure on him, the KGB sent him threatening
letters on each of the succeeding three days. Finally, on
the third day, instead of meeting the KGB, SMITH went to
Ambassador BOHLEN and reported the blackmail attempt. SMITH
was immediately withdrawn from Moscow and (as of 1962) he

was "still in intelligence work".

In 1964 and afterwards NOSENKO denied that he had played
any personal role in the case. He explained that as a
junior officer in the American Embassy Section at the time,
working on correspondents, he would not have taken part in e
so important an operation. He said that he had heard about
the operation from V. M. KOVSHUK, SMITH's case officer.
(On a later occasion NOSENKO said that his only personal
role was being assigned to a phone-watch to receive
surveillance reports connected with the initial KGB approach
to SMITH.)

? GOLITSYN's Information

In February 1962 GOLITSYN reported that in 1957 he had
read a two-volume KGB study which gave examples of successful
operations against the Embassy in Moscow. One case concerned
an American, probably single, who was either the Security
Officer or the counterintelligence representative in‘the
Embassy. He had a dog, .and lived in an apartment in the
city or a country house outside Moscow. His Russian maid
or cleaning. woman was his mistress. The KGB concluded that
the American would not, succumb’ to ordinary blackmail and
consequently the maid, a KGB agent, was instructed to confess
to him that she had been recruited by the KGB against her
will and would be arrested if she did not fulfill her KGB
tasks. The American agreed to help her, and GOLITSYN believed
that he did not report this to his Washington headquarters.
GOLITSYN also recalled that the American first supplied .
only misinformation to the KGB, but when the KGB complained,
he provided a mixture of truth and misinformation. GOLITSYN
said the case study he read was based on a true incident

which took place between 1953 and 1957, but he was not sure
that the operation actually resulted in a successful recruit-—
ment, as was alleged in the study.

Comment:

Edward Ellis SMITH (a redhead), Embassy
Security Officer (and CIA employee) from
July 1954 to June 1956, reported to the
Ambassador on 5 June 1956 that he had received
four letters from the KGB. The first,
received on 2 June 1956, enclosed incriminating
photographs of himself and his Russian maid and
requested him to come to a personal meeting
with KGB representatives outside the Embassy.
When he did not do so, SMITH subsequently had
received three threatening letters. In
reporting the matter to the Ambassador, SMITH
admitted having been intimate with his Russian
maid. SMITH was recalled from Moscow on
8 June 1956, and he left CIA employment a year
later. When interviewed in March 1962 on the
basis of the GOLITSYN information, SMITH
admitted that he had maintained his affair
with the Russian maid during most of the time
of his Moscow assignment, 20 July 1954 to
8 June 1956, and confirmed that to help her
he had in fact passed unclassified information
through her to the KGB for many months.
NOSENKO clearly ascribed the SMITH operation
to the period when NOSENKO was in the American
Embassy Section, in 1953-1955. SMITH's state-
ment that he reported the blackmail attempt to
the Ambassador in June 1956 is confirmed. If
NOSENKO was, as he says, transferred to the
Seventh Department in 1955, he could not have
played any role in the KGB approach to SMITH.
If he played such a role, he was in the Embassy
Section in 1956, not in the Seventh Department
as he claims. If he played a role in ‘the SMITH
case as well as_in the Seventh Department
recruitment of [BURGI (see p. 115), it remains OG
possible that he was neither an officer in the
Embassy Section nor Seventh Department and was
acting in some other KGB capacity.

CHAPTER IL

EXAMINATION OF NOSENKO'S BONA FIDES

What NOSENKO has said about himself, the information
about the KGB which he has provided, and the apparently
corroborative statements which Soviet officials have made
since his defection represent prima facie evidence that
NOSENKO is a former senior KGB officer. To permit a
conclusive judgment that he is a bona fide defector, the
information NOSENKO provides about his life and related a
persons and events must be coherent, and his accounts of
important events must be consistent. Allowing for personal
vagaries such as lapses of memory and so forth, as well
as for factors of accident and coincidence, the information
he relates must conform within reasonable limits with that
which is known from independent and reliable sources to
the United States Government about Soviet realities and
about the events, topics and individuals NOSENKO describes.
Lastly, the information NOSENKO provides must plausibly
relate primarily to the KGB positions he held, and his
account of how he functioned in these positions must be
substantiated by verisimilar detail.

The following portions of this paper, organized in
chronological fashion insofar as possible, summarize this
examination of the significant aspects of NOSENKO's claims.

Notes for the Reader

In order to follow the examination as presented the
reader should note the following:

The examination tests the validity of the presumptive
evidence favoring NOSENKO in terms of coherence, consistency,
and compatdbility with fact and plausibility.

(EXAMINATION OF NOSENKO'S BONA FIDES)

Notes for the Reader (Continued)

NOSENKO's claims are judged in the light of his own
assertions and in comparison with collateral information.
It is not the function of the examination to speculate
about possibly. credible alternative explanations for the
paradoxes reflected in NOSENKO's statements, except when
such explanations are advanced by NOSENKO himself.

If there is no immediate explanatory note pointing out
the relevance or significance of some item in the text, the
reader may expect that the item's relevance or significance
usually will be developed in the immediately-following text.
Otherwise seemingly minor points are included because of
their aggregative significance: they will be a matter of
comment in the Summary and Conclusions section following
each major portion of the examination.

Direct questions and NOSENKO's replies about his
contradictions, inconsistencies, ambiguities, retractions,
omissions and the like, are reflected in the text. Where,
during his interrogations, it was not possible to pose
direct questions without furnishing NOSENKO information or
insight into the interrogators! purposes, the topic was
covered exhaustively if indirectly, and NOSENKO was
provided every opportunity to comment on the matter in
question. When the text indicates that NOSENKO apparently

_ Was not asked about a particular matter, or that "hé didn't

say", or "didn't comment" or “didn't indicate awareness"
and so. forth, the reader Properly may assume that the
Matter was covered extensively.

In instances in which NOSENKO contradicts or retracts
earlier assertions, no more weight is necessarily given
to his final assertion as opposed to earlier contrary claims.

To assist the reader in following what are sometimes
lengthy and complex accounts of events, NOSENKO's narrative
is broken from time to time by a clearly identified
editorial comment which seeks to draw the reader's attention
to the relevance or significance of NOSENKO's assertions,
or to what conclusion is drawn.

CHAPTER III

PRE-KGB BIOGRAPHY

NOSENKO's biography from birth to entry into the KGB is
relevant to his bona fides insofar as it is material to
establishing his true Identity, his general veracity, and
his eventual eligibility for KGB service. Below are
summarized pertinent events in his early life, his study
at the Moscow Institute of International Relations, and
his RU service, as reconstructed from statements he
volunteered as well as from the accounts obtained in
repeated interrogations.

Birth to 1945 - NOSENKO's Account

NOSENKO was born on,30 October 1927 in Nikolayev, in the
Ukraine. At,the time of his birth, his father, Ivan
Isidorovich NOSENKO, was a shipyard mechanic and an evening
student at the Nikolayey Shipbuilding Institute. Shortly
after NOSENKO began kindergarten in Nikolayev, in September
1934, his father graduated from the Shipbuilding Institute
and the family moved to Leningrad, where NOSENKO started
the First Class of school in September 1935. From 1935 to
1937 NOSENKO lived in Leningrad where his father was director
of a shipyard. In 1938 the elder NOSENKO became Deputy
People's Commissar of the Shipbuilding Industry and the
family moved to Moscow, where NOSENKO completed the Sixth
Class in June 1941 just as the war broke out.

NOSENKO has given two versions of his whereabouts for
the next two years. In one, he said that on the outbreak
of hostilities he was enrolled in the Moscow Special Naval
School which was evacuated to Kuybyshev where he finished
the Seventh Class; thereafter he transferred to the Lenin-
grad Naval Preparatory School (which had been evacuated to

Yep Secret
(PRE-KGB. BIOGRAPHY)

Baku), where he finished the Fighth Class in spring, 1943.
In a second version [more probable since entry to the Moscow
Special Naval School required prior completion of the
Seventh Class] NOSENKO said that when the war broke out he
and his mother were.evacuated to Chelyabinsk, where he
completed’ the Seventh Class in summer of 1942. They returned
to Moscow afterwards, and NOSENKO was then enrolled in the
Moscow Special Naval School (then in Kuybyshev) where he
completed the Eighth Class in 1943; in the fall of 1943
NOSENKO was enrolled in the Leningrad Naval Preparatory
School (then in Baku).

After just six months in Baku, without completing the
Ninth Class, NOSENKO ran away from school and returned to
Moscow. . .

Comment: . NOSENKO has asserted variously that he ran
away and fought on the front at Tuapse, and
that he had finished the Tenth Class in Baku
and then spent the period 1943-1945 at the
Frunze Higher Naval School, the equivalent of
Annapolis. He has retracted both assertions.

?

NOSENKO completed the Ninth Class in June 1944 at the
Moscow Mining Institute, and when the Leningrad Naval
Preparatory School returned to Leningrad from Baku, he

resumed his studies there. Early in 1945, however, NOSENKO
received a gunshot wound in the hand, and after being
hospitalized for a month, he left the Naval school.

NOSENKO has said at various times that the Institute
course was of four years' duration and that he entered the
Naval RU on graduation in 1949; that it was four years'
duration and that because he failed a state examination he
was graduated later, in 1950; that it was of five years'
duration and he graduated In 1950, on scheduYe; and that it
was of five. years' duration but he failed an examination
which delayed his graduation for three months.

Comment: See p.367for report that NOSENKO joined the KGB
upon graduation from the Institute in 1947.
The duration of the Institute course and the
date of NOSENKO's completion are materiai to
the plausibility of his claimed Naval RU service,
which he said followed almost immediately upon
his departure from the Institute.

Naval RU Service (ca. 1951 - ca. 1953)

.NOSENKO claims that upon completion of his studies at
the Institute of International Relations he entered the
Naval RU, serving in the Far East and then in a Baltic post,
finally successfully. “transferring" to the KGB through the
intervention of his father's friend, KGB General KOBULOV.

Korea. In spring 1952 NOSENKO suddenly fell ill. Returned
to Moscow and given a medical examination, he was diagnosed
to have “a small spot on a blood vessel under his collarbone"
and he was confined to the Hertzen Sanitorium outside Moscow
for two months. In summer 1952, again eligible for duty,
NOSENKO was offered an assignment to the Military-Diplomatic
Academy, but he rejected the opportunity because the
curriculum was almost identical to that of the Institute
from which he was graduated.

In summer 1952 NOSENKO was ordered to the Baltic city of
Primorsk, "the former German city of Pillau". ([Baltiysk, a
larger city close by Primorsk, is the former German city of
Pillau.] There NOSENKO was involved in the formation of
"agent-observation posts", in which candidates from among
Soviet seamen were formed into three-man teams and trained
as stay-behind agents in the event of war. In early 1953,
after less than six months in the Baltic assignment, NOSENKO
returned on leave to Moscow where he met at his father's
dacha KGB General KOBULOV, First Deputy to then~MGB (kGB]
@hairman Beria. KOBULOV, on finding that NOSENKO did not
care for his RU assignment, invited him to consider joining
the KGB.

NOSENKO's Information-1964

Prior to NOSENKO's graduation he had been tentatively
assigned by the Institute's military commission to the RU,
and on the instructions of the Institute's "secret unit", he
was interviewed by a’ RU Colonel -KALOSHIN at the RU Personnel
Department. After passing the state examination on the
Second try, NOSENKO entered the Navy in. September 1950, when
he received orders calling him to active duty as a junior
lieutenant. He also received orders assigning him to the
Intelligence Staff of the Seventh (Far East) Fleet. He
left Moscow approximately 1 October 1950, travelling for
ten days by train to his unit, which was stationed near
Sovetskaya Gavan'. He was there assigned to a Reports
Section with duties which included translating American
naval publications and making summaries of Order of Battle
information of American naval forces in the Far East. A
radio signals intercept unit was connected with NOSENKO's
unit, but [contrary to what he asserted in 1962 and 1965] he
was not personally concerned with that unit's activities.

In spring 1951 NOSENKO was promoted to. the rank of
lieutenant. At the end of .1951°NOSENKO was assigned as. an
“apprentice”. in the Agent-Intelligence Section near
Sovetskaya Gavan', an assignment which involved subchaser
delivery and pickup:of agents from Hokkaido and Sakhalin.’

In early, 1952 NOSENKO filed by mail for divorce from
TELEGINA in a Moscow court. In April 1952 he returned to
Moscow on leave, where he visited the Naval RU Headquarters
personnel officer, Col. KALOSHIN,. and. requested a transfer
from the Far East. .During May and June 1952 he-was on
leave accrued. during His two years' service in the Far
East. Following his. leave, in summer 1952, NOSENKO was”

in East Germany, before going to Baltiysk. In
retracting that claim, he explained that he
knew his CIA interrogators would not believe
that he had successfully refused the assignment
in Germany.

In August or September 1952 NOSENKO returned to Moscow
for 7 to 10 days to complete the divorce proceedings which
he had initiated in the Far East. This was not regarded
as leave, but official business. He afterwards returned
to Sovetsk, but he did not like his work there, and in late
1952. he requested leave to return to Moscow to seek a transfer.
When his unit: commander refused him leave, NOSENKO appealed
to. Admiral GOLOVKO in Baltiysk, and because of the elder
NOSENKO's influence, was able to return to Moscow for a month's
leave in January. 1953. At the end of January NOSENKO visited
the RU Personnel Officer, KALOSHIN, and stated his distaste
for his work. KALOSHIN told him to "look around", and
NOSENKO spent February 1953 “at the disposal of the Personnel
Department", not doing anything. Since he wasn't working,
he didn't receive his pay, and he lived with his parents.

Comment: Just before giving this account of his January
1953 leave, NOSENKO claimed that he spent
January and a. part of February at the Kubinka
Sanitorium. He has never reconciled these two
statements.

NOSENKO's Information-1965

Prior to his graduation-from the Institute, a military
commission tentatively assigned NOSENKO to the Navy, after
which he visited a special section at the Naval Ministry
to file special forms for a security check. Although nothing
was said at the time, NOSENKO believed then that he was slated

he reported to the Naval Ministry and was told to return

for reassignment at the end of his leave. NOSENKO was on
leave in May and June 1952, and he remained “at the disposal
of the Naval Ministry". [According to his 1962 and 1966
versions, he was hospitalized during this period.]

In the summer of 1952 NOSENKO was offered assignments to
the RU Military-Diplomatic Academy, to a special Naval
espionage. school, and to a post in Germany, but he turned
them all down. He rejected the opportunity to attend the
academy, because he had had almost all of the courses
earlier at the Institute of International Relations.

"gometime after his return to Moscow from Sovetskaya
Gavan'," NOSENKO completed the formalities to secure his
divorce from TELEGINA. [According to his 1964 account,
NOSENKO visited Moscow later, from his Baltic assignment,
to complete divorce proceedings.]

In August 1952 NOSENKO received an assignment to Sovetsk,
in the Baltic, where he arrived in early September 1952.
His assignment there was’ as a political officer, in which
capacity he was involved with sailors being trained for
wartime sabotage missions. His main task was to prepare the
training plan for. the agents, to instruct them in such
subjects as “The Foreign Policy of the USSR", and generally
to see to their needs. NOSENKO did not care for his
assignment in Sovetsk and in December 1952 he obtained leave
to spend the holidays-with his parents in Moscow.. In January
1953 NOSENKO and his parents visited KGB General KOBULOV
at the latter's dacha and KOBULOV, learning of NOSENKO's
dissatisfaction with the RU, suggested he consider working.
for. the. KGB...

After New Years in 1953 NOSENKO went “to rest for several
days" at the Hertzen “House of Rest", located 65-70 kilo-
meters from Moscow near Kubinka. There he met his second
wife, Lyudmila Yulianovna KOZHEVNIKOVA. {In 1964 and 1966

hospitalized with tuberculosis for several weeks in January
and February.]

At an ‘intérview with the military. placement commission
at the Institute before graduation, NOSENKO indicated that
he wanted to work in "some sort. of a military organization".
Sonn thereafter the chief of the Institute's special, section
gave him a telephone number to cali. NOSENKO recognized the
number as one belonging to the MGB {the predecessor of, and
hereafter referred to,as; the KGB]. NOSENKO was invited to
an interview with KGB-officials who queried him about his
background and his’ knowledge of English. Later, however, ©

“the chief of the Institute's special -section informed :
NOSENKO that his qualifications were unsuitable for assign-

At the end of April 1952 NOSENKO left Sovetskaya Gavan'
on leave, arriving in Moscow on 28 April. [Note earlier
versions in which he was transferred because of illness,
and that he was permitted to return to Moscow because of
his father's birthday.] While on leave he became ill with
tuberculosis ani spent almost two months in May and June.
1952 in a sanitorium near Moscow.

During the month of July 1952 NOSENKO was ordered to
the Naval Intelligence Point of the Fourth (Baltic) Fleet
in Sovetsk, in Kaliningradskaya Oblast (at the head of the
Bay of Gdansk}. Sovetsk was a small village located on
the spit of land between Kaliningrad and Baltiysk. [The
only Sovetsk in Kaliningradskaya Oblast is located many
miles inland from Kaliningrad, in the opposite direction
from Baltiysk. When NOSENKO was shown their locations on
contemporary Soviet maps, he insisted that he was correct,
although Primorsk, where NOSENKO had said in 1962 that he
was assigned while in the Baltic, is located on a‘spit of
land between Kaliningrad and Baltiysk.] NOSENKO remained
in "Sovetsk". but a short time, and he returned to Moscow
at the end of 1952 to seek another assignment. Before
his departure he was promoted to the rank of lieutenant
of the Administrative Service. [In previous versions he
claimed to have become eligible for promotion and was
promoted while in the Far East, after less then a year's
service.]

NOSENKO s ‘Information-1966 (October)

In his most xecent account, in October "1966, “NOSENKO
‘Said. that before graduation from the Institute the military.
placement commission sent him to the’ KGB, but there he was
told that he was not qualified as a candidate because of -
mediocre-academic record and drinking habits... NOSENKO said
he .did not mention this rejection, earlier, because his
interrogators. would not have. believed. that he ever became
a, KGB. officer after once being rejected. an

NOSENKO also volunteered’ that he had "liea"™ ‘when he *
claimed: to have enteréd’the Naval RU in 1950. In fact,.
whe said, he entered the. RU. in March 1951. and was, on active:
pose in’ the Far East £xom 1951 until 1953.

Comment: » This latest assertion discredits almost all

active Naval service and assigned to the RU. With neither
training nor indoctrination he was assigned initially to
the Far East for nine months or three years; there he
participated in agents' operational training, or reports
work. In the-latter capacity he was or was not involved
in RU radio signals intercept operations. He either never
served in the Baltic or, if he did, it was for three
months or six months, during which he either participated
in agent training or was an administrative or political
officer. He was promoted to lieutenant in the Far East
or in the Baltic, after either seven momths' or thirteen
months' RU service.

Despite his claimed active commissioned service in the
Navy, NOSENKO knows nothing of Soviet Navy tradition,
doctrine, organization, or procedures. . He disctaims know-
ledge of RU organization other than at the posts where he
served, "because of his junior rank". However, even at
those posts he describes neither the staff, the functions
nor the personnel intelligibly nor does he describe the
posts’ actual locations.

The sole Headquarters RU officer NOSENKO identified was

‘the personnel chief, Colonel KALOSHIN.. .He identified.no

ranking officers in either the Baltic or Far East intelli-
gence staffs. Some thirty GRU officers he did identify,
by his own admission, NOSENKO knew not from his Naval RU
service, but through social acquaintance, later, in Moscow,
er through his visits to Geneva.

Conclusion.'

NOSENKO did not serve in the Naval RU in any of the
capacities at the places and times he claimed.

in the Naval RU and of his date of graduation from the
Institute of International Relations). To the extent to
which he has been consistent at all, he has cited March 1953
as the time of his entry to the KGB.

Date of Entry

NOSENKO at his: first meeting with CIA in Geneva in 1962,
volunteered how and when he joined the KGB. NOSENKO had
just returned from his Naval RU assignment in the Baltic,
he said, when he met KGB General KOBULOV and KOBULOV urged
him to join the KGB. NOSENKO stated that after completing
his processing, he reported for duty in the Embassy Section
of the Second Chief Directorate's American Department in
March 1953, “just after Stalin died". (Stalin died on
5 March 1953.)

Comment: According to KGB defectors, the precise date
of entry to the KGB would not likely to be
forgotten by a KGB officer. The date is the
basis for computing length of service and is
a common entry. on KGB administrative forms
periodically filled out by KGB officers in the
course of. their service.

According to NOSENKO in January 1964, he transferred to
the KGB from the Naval RU “in something like 1952", "just

after Yu. I. GUK transferred from the Second Chief Directo-
rate".

Comment: _GOLITSYN had reported that GUK was transferred
out. of the Second Chief Directorate in January
1952.

was confronted with his contradictory claims. . In response,
NOSENKO stated that he returned to Moscow from: the Baltic. in
August 1952: {by most of his other accounts, NOSENKO returned
in January 1953] and entered the KGB on 5-7 September 1952.

By March 1953, NOSENKO stated, he had already worked in the
Embassy “Section for some months against American correspon=
dents, and it was “just after Stalin's death, after the :
reorganization" that' he assumed ‘responsibility. for. operations
against American Army Attache personnel. [NOSENKO ultimately

Challenged’ in April 1964 to resolve the. contradictions of

‘his earlier claims. that:he joined the KGB variously vin’:

January 1952, September. 1952,’ or March'1953, NOSENKO
asserted that the truth was ‘that his service dated from March
1953, after Stalin's’ death. He went on to explain that, he
finished his Institute studies in 1949 (sic), “defended his
diploma" and.then failed one of the four required State

‘examinations. All four examinations, he said, he had to‘

take over again, and as a result he didn't-receive his diploma

then-MVD. NOSENKO' said that when KOBULOV learned of NOSENKO's
dissatisfaction with the Naval RU, KOBULOV encouraged him

‘to enter. counterintelligence and invited him to visit the
‘General's office. ¢ NOSENKO said he did not, but nevertheless
received a wéek later a telephone call from the KGB Personnel
Office asking him to appear at the secretariat, of General
KOBULOV and informing him that’ General KOBULOV. had already
arranged for a building:pass. :

NOSENKO gave a different, somewhat more detailed account
in April 1964. In this’ version, he first met KOBULOV, a
friend of the NOSENKO family, in February 1953. NOSENKO said
KOBULOV had visited. his.father in the latter's office, and
that evening ‘the elder NOSENKO brought him to the. NOSENKO
dacha to spend the weekend... {NOSENKO had..just before been
informed. by his interrogators that. KOBULOV was at that time
posted in Germany, not in: Moscow.]. According to NOSENKO,,
KOBULOV was in’ Moscow on a short visit from Germany. ° "My
father: invited.him to spend Saturday night and Sunday...On
Sunday’ we were playingbilliards and KOBULOV asked me.what
I. was doing, and I told him I was at the disposal of the
,: (Naval RU)..Personnel. Department ‘and: that’ I didn't.want. to
“. return. to the Baltic." . NOSENKO..said that -KOBULOV. offered:
to. call the KGB Personnel Office and have them "look “«
NOSENKO. over", and NOSENKO assented, after which he twice
visited the: Personnel Office where he filed completed forms.
NOSENKO asserted. that.:KOBULOV. did not forget, because "just
as soon as STALIN died, KOBULOV immediately returned from
Germany" after being "summoned by Beriya or someone", and
.on "maybe the 10th .of:March" NOSENKO received a call from
KOBULOV'sS assistant. _NOSENKO: claimed he reported to’ KOBULOV's
office, and although he waited two hours to see the. General,
the latter was busy elsewhere... Instead of seeing KOBULOV, -:
however, NOSENKO said he was finally taken to the office
of Second Chief Directorate. Deputy Chief: SHUBNYAKOV,.who
assigned him forthwith. to’ ‘the Embassy Section of the american
Department.: :

In April 1964 NOSENKO introduced a new variant. He said
that he met KOBULOV while. accompanying his parents on a
visit in. January to KOBULOV's dacha [NOSENKO had previously:
graphically described .KOBULOV'S weekend visit at the elder
NOSENKO's], KOBULOV intervened in his behalf, and he was
called to the KGB Personnel Office to be interviewed and.to

receive necessary forms. NOSENKO stated that he heard
nothing further until after Stalin's funeral, wnen he was
summoned to KOBULOV's office and afterwards assigned to
the Second Chief Directorate.

During the July 1965 interrogations NOSENKO retracted
his earlier claim that KOBULOV and his father had been close
persofal friends. He stated that his father's relationship
with KOBULOV was not personal, and that KOBULOV had never
visited the NOSENKOs.

In a biographic: statement written in April 1966, NOSENKO
said that he had met KOBULOV but twice, once on 1 January
1953 at the latter's dacha, and the second and last time in
the elder NOSENKO's office as NOSENKO's father and KOBULOV
were departing to attend Stalin's funeral. On that latter
occasion, NOSENKO claimed, KOBULOV promised to concern him-

self witn NOSENKO's entry into the KGB and it was several

days later that NOSENKO was summoned to KOBULOV's office’
and told ne was appointed to the KGB.

Comment: General. Bogdan Zakharovich KOBULOV was a career
security official, but from the immediate post-
war period until after Stalin's death he was
not assigned to KGB Headquarters. As of 1952,
he was posted to Germany with the Chief
Directorate of Soviet Properties Abroad, then

~ directly subordinate not to the MVD but to the
Council of Ministers and latterly to the
Ministry of Foreign Trade. Until he returned
from Germany in March 1953 to assume the
position of Beriya's deputy, he had no office
in KGB Headquarters. KOBULOV was arrested
with Beriya in June 1953, and also later executed.

In light of the foregoing, it is improbable

that KOBULOV was instrumental in NOSENKO's
appointment to the KGB at the times NOSENKO
claimed. If KOBULOV ever interceded in
NOSENKO's behalf, it is probable that NOSENKO
would later have been purged after KOBULOV's

NOSENKO states that in March 1953 he was already twenty—
five and a half years old, a member of only the Komsomol,
and that he had not been recommended for Party membership.
He further claimed that.on entry to the KGB he became
secretary of the Second Chief Directorate Komsomol organi-
zation.

Comment: Eligibility for Party membership, if not
membership itself, is a requisite for KGB
appointment. By Komsomol statutes,of that time,
twenty-five was at that time the maximum age.
Thus, at the time of NOSENKO's claimed KGB
appointment, he was within six months of being
dropped by the Komsomol as well as still
‘unqualified for Party membership. He could
not have been. secretary of the Second Chief
Directorate Komsomol organization, as discussed
on p. 338.

three copies of a four to six-page biographic form to complete

KGB Entry: Summary and Conclusion

NOSENKO's assertiohs regarding the KGB in the 1953-1954
period throw no more light on the actual date of his KGB
entry than did his claims of when he transferred from the
Naval RU; the contradictions and inconsistencies are
interrelated.

It is possible that a former KGB officer, relating the
truth as he recalls it about events occurring ten years
earlier, could be inconsistent; that he could forget his
date of entry, not remember what administrative procedures
were, fail to recall the circumstances of the organization
he joined were, be inaccurate about what his pay was, and
be vague on what his KGB identification document looked
like. Recognizing that administrative regulations and
procedures are on occasion honored in the breach, it is
also possible that NOSENKO was accepted by the KGB despite
the fact that he was the son of a senior official, that he
had tuberculosis, that he was unqualified for Party member-
ed _ ship, that he had been previously rejected and all at a

, time when the KGB was not accepting new recruits.

The probability of these events being coincident, however,
is remote. On examination, NOSENKO's latest admission, that
he “actually" entered the KGB in March 1953, is no better
substantiated: than earlier accounts: citing other dates.

Conclusion

NOSENKO did not enter the KGB in the manner nor at the
time he claimed.

Operations against American Correspondents

NOSENKO exempted Himself. from reporting details of KGB
work against any specific American correspondent in’ Moscow
in 1953-1954 by saying that, as a new, very. junior employée
he had no access to operational files and did not partici-
pate personally in the handling of any of the correspondents.

Although able to identify correspondents in Moscow who were
then recruited KGB agents, NOSENKO learned this information
either in conversations with his superior [V.A.] KOZLOV or

at some point and in some undefined way after he no longer

was working against these targets. NOSENKO made clear that

he was not the case officer responsible for the more important
correspondents? "KOZLOV himself was working with_them, the
chief of the section himself--with GuAPIROPowi th [SHAPIRO s 06
wife. I also know that KOZLOV was Corking with (WHITNEY) 04

and with (Andrew J.) STEIGER. 9% For each of these persons
there was an operational fife which I did not see." According

to NOSENKO, -he was. in no way involved with [STEIGER) andO&
{Edmund STEVENS} American correspondents who he alleged were

yecruited agents of the KGB.

Operations Against u. S. Army Attache Personnel

NOSENKO claimed specific vesponsibility for work against
American Army Attaches during twenty months ‘of 1954-55, a

“period in: which: NOSENKO claimed no supervisory responsibility
_to divert his attention from personal operational duties.

(NOSENKO,. explaining why he did not know more details about

-the Embassy Section's targets. while ‘he:was its deputy chief

in 1960-1961, said that as a supervisor he was too busy -
overseeing subordinates. — Hence, NOSFNKO continued, he could
not: be. expected: to. remember as many such details as would
be possible had he been .a.case officer working.daily on only

“four or five targets. Elsewhere;-he.. contrasted. operations

against tourists, who often came and went in a matter of a
few days, with the work against the ‘sérvice attaches and
diplomats permanently stationed. in Moscow, who could ‘be! Se

NOSENKO ‘has:.said in different contexts ‘that as the

“against: Army Attaches he? received and was responsible for

assimilating the. product ‘of a wide. variety. of sources ‘on. the

gence) Directorate; the Archives of the MGB/MVD/KGB;~ and

“o£ -1954-1955;" that’ he knew nothing of these

Information was also received according to NOSENKO from the
network of Soviet chauffeurs, cooks, language instructors,
and other agents in the Embassy; permanent and roving
surveillance patrols outside the Embassy; fixed observation
posts next to, acros$ from and near the Embassy; advance
notification of intent to travel by the attaches and their
itineraries; and reports from outside Moscow, including
surveillance, agent networks, the Militia, and the military.
The point of collecting and assimilating this information,
NOSENKO said, was to be able to know what the military
attaches were doing in Moscow and thereby to control their
intelligence collection activities. Far less important was
the goal of recruiting military attaches; NOSENKO knew of
only a. few instances when this was attempted, and all of
these efforts allegedly failed.

“an The KGB's principal interest in control rather than
recruitment has been NOSENKO's explanation for knowing .little
about the backgrounds and personal lives of his targets--such
information, he stated, simply was not pertinent to the
primary mission of control. He has also used this explana-
: tion to support his assertion that.there were no recruitments
Pe] | 9f American military, personnel during this. period.

Comment: NOSENKO's assertion that the KGB's mission was
to control rather than to recruit American
military attaches is contradicted by the
emphasis KGB tradition and doctrine place on
conducting operations against the United
‘States, thée-"main enemy", in the KGB” parlance,
in this case American officials with access to
classified information, who were residing in
the’ Soviet Union. eee :

In the USSR, especially in the early 1950's
prior to the U-2 reconnaissance, the Service
Attache travel program was the primary means -
by which the U.S. Armed Forces acquired intelli-
gence information on the Soviet Union's
military~industrial complex. The prevention
ox inhibition of this collection activity fell
consequently to KGB components concerned with
the security of military-industrial installations,

accepted the cases from KHRENOV.... I accepted the cases
from Pavel Fedorovich PANKRATOV. This was in the beginning
of 1954." .

-15 April 1964: NOSENKO said that he thought he turned
over the correspondent files to F.V. KISLITSYN (who returned
to the USSR from Australia in May 1954). WOSENKO asked
when the PETROVs defected in Australia; he explained that
he was not sure about KISLITSYN and could have given them
to another officer. “If KISLITSYN came [back from Australia]
in 1953, then it was to KISLITSYN. Otherwise, it was some-
one else."

~18.June 1964: "KISLITSYN-came into the. Embassy Section
in 1954 and‘I gave him the files on American correspondents.
BUDYLDIN also joined the section this year and took the
files on the Army Attache and. his assistants from PANKRATOV.

responsibilities for the Attaches. As noted above, he said
on 10 April 1964 that he received the files in the beginning
of 1954... Ile had earlier said that he. worked on the corres=
pondents “only. about six months". If the date of March. 1953,
which-he most. often gave for his entry into the KGB, is
correct, this would place the turnover in the fall of 1953.
On other.occasionshe has said specifically that he turned

“ over’ the correspondent cases and began work against the E
Attaches in January 1954, on- still others that this occurred
in May 1954. In February 1965, NOSENKO said that he could
not remember when he changed assignments.

Agents. Reporting on Army Attaches

‘Asked in April 1964 to describe the agent network
(agentura) at his disposal in operations against Army
Attaches during this period which began in 1954, NOSENKO
replied: "There were two maids, a cook, drivers...about ten
persons, plus the agent 'SERVIZNIY' and the one with the
cryptonym ‘'DMITRIYEV'.... These additional two agents,
about 12 or 13 agents altogether." “With one exception, this

network remained constant until NOSENKO transferred from

the’ American Embassy Section in mid-1955.. He met each agent
about once a week, except. for the chauffeurs who were met
three ‘times a month in a safehouse or on the street. The

Of the KGB agents among the chauffeurs, NOSENKO named
Nikolay SHNYRYEV, who was used by various attaches. "He
reported where they went, what they said, whether they took
notes or photographs, whether they had unusual packages
with them, and so on."

when viewing photographs (see below) in September 1964,
NOSENKO identified Vladislav VOROBYEV as his former agent
"SERVIZNIY". He had been working in the Embassy since its
establishment, starting first as a messenger boy and, in
NOSENKO's time, performing clerical tasks. VOROBYFV had no
direct connection with the Army Attaches, and NOSENKO said
he himself did not know why he had been given VOROBYFV to
handle in 1954. ‘The main function of this agent was
delivering to NOSENKO copies of the unclassified telephone
listings of the Embassy, issued monthly.

"“DMITRIYEV's" true name may have been Dmitriy KUKOLEV;
NOSENKO saw this name on a 1962 phone list and thought, but
was not sure, that this was his agent. An electrician who
worked on the Embassy's electrical wiring systems and
elevator, "DMITRIYEV", reported to NOSENKO on antenna wires
and other wires he had observed on the top floors. Like
VOROBYEV, "DMITRIYEY" had no direct connection with the
Army Attaches. : 7

Comment:.. Elsewhere NOSENKO described an electrician who
provided ‘some technical information on the
Embassy, but he related him to his second tour
in the American Ettbassy Section in 1960-1962
and did not. then claim that the electrician was
his agent. ' =| :

In September 1964 NOSENKO was’ shown a series of 260
biographic cards on Soviet citizens employed by the American
Embassy in Moscow. Each card contained a photograph of the
person involved and short biographic notes, including his
name and job in the Embassy. The first time he went through
these cards, NOSENKO was permitted to see only the photo-
graphs; NOSENKO did not identify the photographs of SHNYRYEV

adding that he thought his name was VOROBYEV. “hen shown
the Embassy biographic cards on SHNYRYEV and KUKOLEV, he
identified each of them as his agents during the 1954-1955
period in the American Department and equated them to the
cryptonyms given previously. In the case of SHNYRYEV, when
shown’ the biogtaphic information, which listed SHNYRYEV as

Additional Reporting

Knowledge of another KGB operation involving Americans
was said by NOSENKO to stem from his 1953-1955 service in
the American Embassy Section, against CIA officer and
Embassy Security Officer Edward Ellis SMITH (see p. 37).
NOSENKO claimed to have personally participated in the
operations against E.E. SMITH in 1954-1955. The incidents
which NOSENKO described, however, occurred in June 1956,
by which time NOSENKO, by his own account, had been out of
the American Embassy Section for a year and when he was
involved in the Seventh Department recruitment of Richara(%
BURGI} His involvement in the [BURGI|case has been confirmed. ,

NOSENKO has also described the KGB recruitment of military
cipher machine mechanic “ANDREY" (Dayle SMITH, see p. 33),
whose true name he claimed not to have known. He dated the
recruitment as occurring "in 1949-1950" and "before he
joined the KGB", although he said that he knew of the
existence of the agent during his first tour in the Embassy
Section in 1953-1955. However, NOSENKO also related that
“ANDREY" was recruited while Roy RHODES was in Moscow, that
RHODES "had spotted 'ANDREY'". “ANDREY" and RHODES Ver-
lapped in Moscow from April 1952 to July 1953. "ANDREY"
fixes his own recruitment. as occurring in December 1953,
and until his departure in April 1954 he was responsible
for the entire Embassy code room. In that capacity "ANDREY"
was a direct subordinate of the Army Attache eryptographic
security officer, NOSENKO's target [Army Captain Walter MULE} os
If NOSENKO served in the‘Embassy Section during 1953-1955
as he claimed, it is difficult to perceive how he could have
remained unaware of "“ANDREY's" identity.

American Embassy Section - ca. 1953-June 1955:
Summary and Conclusion :

According to NOSENKO, immediately upon entering on duty
with the KGB he was assigned without training to what he
describes as the most sensitive and important section of
the Second Chief Directorate. There, after first handling
agents covering American correspondents resident in Moscow,

99 is
13 WHR
Top Secret Copy __10_

SIER



Top Secret

(AMERICAN EMBASSY SECTION ~ ca. 1953-June 1955)

he was made the case officer solely responsible for opera-
tions against the commissioned officers of the Embassy's
Army Attache office, until his transfer to the Seventh

Department. Alleging complete knowledge of all service

attache operations, NOSENKO flatly asserts that there were

no KGB recruitments of American military personnel during

the period of his assignment to the Embassy Section.

Pertinent to the consideration of .NOSENKO's statements |
is his reluctance to discuss the 1953-1955 period, and his
inconsistent accounts of the dating and circumstances of

his entry into the Embassy ‘Section, of his assumption of
responsibility as sole case officer for Army Attache tar- ]
gets, and of his transfer to the Seventh Department. :.Al-

though NOSENKO could plausibly claim failing memory to ex-

plain some areas of ignorance, he does not do so. Instead, |
he is positive and insistent that his statements about his

targets are a factual and complete account of what was then

known to the KGB. His assertion that the KGB was not in-
terested in his targets' vulnerability to recruitment is

belied by his own statements as well as by the [MULE) case ,06

as he himself related it. He is uninformed about both At-

tache personnel and agent-informants who, by-his own ac-

count, were his targets and his agents.

Conclusion

NOSENKO did not serve in the American Embassy Section
throughout the March 1953-June 1955 period as he claimed.
Specifically, he neither entered the Section in March 1953
nor transferred from the Section in June 1955. In whatever
period he may have served, he was not the sole case officer
responsible for commissioned officers in the office of the
Army Attache. Unaware of many aspects of KGB activities
involving Army personnel and by his own account not involved
with either Air or Naval Attache personnel or diplomats,
NOSENKO has no valid claim to certainty that the KGB re—
cruited no American Embassy personnel during this period.

then a substantial number of similar missions
had also been launched by American m:
intelligence organizations and by the
and allied services.

It is a matter of fact, not of conjecture,
that as early as 1957 a large number of these
agents were coming to the attention of the KGB
within the Soviet Union. Few were arrested.
Instead, all were surveilled, and some pro-
voked or entrapped, as the Second Chief
Directorate and its provincial KGB counter-
intelligence elements sought to identify the »
Soviet citizens with whom the American agents
were in contact, as well as the agents'
specific clandestine tasks. By the summer
of 1959 the KGB had obtained from its British

i agent, George BLAKF, complete details of: the
objectives and methods of CIA and {
Intelligence tourist programs, together with
a number of case examples.
It is within this context that one must
uuu examine NOSENKO's claims to KGB service in
and consequent knowledge of Second Chief
Directorate counterintelligence operations
against American and British tourists in 1955-
1960.

NOSENKO claimed he served with the Seventh Department
from June 1955 until January 1960. According to him, the
Seventh Department exercised counterintelligence functions
involving foreigners then visiting the Soviet Union,
including businessmen, seamen, foreign delegations and some
ists, as well as the hotels and restaurants utilized by
visitors. He said that by 1958, however, the number
reign tourists visiting the Soviet Union had grown
appreciably, and in June 1958 the Seventh Department
Tourist Section was split, and two new sections were created.
NOSENKO explained that one of the new sections became

responsible for counterintelligence operations conducted
against American and British Commonwealth nationals, the
other ‘section was charged with all other nationalities,

It is convenient to divide the. examination of NOSENKO's
Claims -to service in the Seventh Department into ‘two
periods. The first of these covers the years from June
1955 until June 1958,.during which. NOSENKO said he was a

~1958, when-he claimed to have become Deputy Chief of the:

NOSENKO's Soviet Agents

The Seventh Department Tourist Section, just established
when NOSENKO was transferred to it in mid-1955, had no agent
network for operations against American and British tourists.
Consequently, HOSENKO said, he and the other case officers
had to "start from the beginning".

As a first step NOSENKO was introduced by a fellow
officer to a number of "trusted persons" in Inturist. These
were not agents, he explained, but "just persons a KGB man
could approach with questions about somebody or something".
NOSENKO collected information on these and others with the
aim of formalizing their recruitments. By the end of 1955,
he estimated, he had a network of about eight agents, all
of them Inturist interpreters. During the following four
years, the number of agents whom NOSENKO handled varied.
Agents would be transferred from one case officer to another,
some would leave Inturist, and "things were sort of changing
all the time, back and forth". In 1956, NOSENKO said, he
had about ten agents, in 1957 there were about twelve, in
1958 about eight, and at the end of 1959 (when he was
preparing to return to the American Department) he had
approximately twelve. The substance of NOSFMNKO's descrip-
tion of his agents is as follows:

Larissa SOBOROVA

An Inturist English-language interpreter, SOBOROVA was
one of the first agents recruited in ‘1955 by NOSENKO within
Inturist. She reported to him on all foreigners with whom
she worked as an interpreter. She worked with _NOSENKO when
he served as a guide for British subjects [BIRSE) and[ LANE in OL
the summer of 1957. During 1957-1959 she Was involved and
possibly sexually intimate with american(travel writer OF 06
Horace SUTTON) SOBOROVA was NOSENKO's agént until 1959, “/
when she marfied and “retired".

SHULGINA was an Inturist interpreter recruited by NOSENKO
in 1955. NOSENKO knew that double agent Boris BELITSKIY
[see p.282] “reported to the KGB that CIA had warned BELITSKIY
against SHULGINA".

Comment: KGB-controlled CIA.source BELITSKIY reported
to CIA that SHULGINA was a KGB agent: CIA did
not warn him. SHULGINA was for two years the
secretary-interpreter of NBC correspondent
Irving R. LEVINE after his arrival in Moscow
in July 1955. She served as a guide for an
American musical troupe's visit in the USSR
in 1956 and in 1956 and 1957 she served as a
guide for American tourists in Moscow. According

recognize it. ‘hen he was then given her name,

Soviet Homosexual A ents
Saeeee Somosexual Agents

The KGB operations which NOSENKO described commonly

! involved sexual entrapment, Many of the operations in
which he claimed a personal role involved the use of homo-
sexual agents, KGB agents whose homosexuality was exploited
against susceptible male targets. ‘thile NOSENKO was never
their official case officer, in specific recruitment-—
entrapment operations he worked with "LUCH", "NIKOLAYEV",
"SIBEYAK", “KOSHIKIN" and “STROYEV" (Victor BELANOVSKIY, b,
used in the compromise of Richard BuRG , VASSALL, and the
Canadian Ambassador WATKINS). He provided virtually no
personality information on them and usually could not recall
their true names. Two such homosexuals, however, VOLKOV
and YEFREMOV, NOSENKO claimed were his own agents.

NOSENKO claimed to have re-recruited VOLKOV, a former
agent (cryptonym "SHMELEV") and recruited YEFREMOV
(cryptonym “GRIGORIY") and to have been their sole case
officer from the beginning of their KGB careers in 1957-

become too well known, He said he met them frequently,

ae and directed them in’ at least a dozen entrapment operations
or other homosexual encounters, NOSENKO Claimed he took
them with him when he transferred to the American Department
in 1960 and back again in early 1962 to the Seventh
Department.

YEFREMOV and VorKov

Because he had been seen meeting a foreigner in a

at public toilet in Moscow, NOSENKO said, the KGB concluded
that A.I. VOLKOV'might be a homosexual and hence of some
Operational value. To verify this possibility in 1957, a
homosexual agent of the Moscow Criminal Investigations
Department provoked VOLKOV into a compromising situation.
Then VOLKOV, who had previously been a KGB agent but was
at this time inactive, was summoned by the KGB and, after
NOSENKO interrogated him, he admitted his homosexuality and
agreed to NOSENKO's Proposal to. work for the KGB among

homosexuals. VOLKOV helped NOSENKO the following year to
recruit a homosexual acquaintance, Aleksey (patronymic not
recalled) YEFREMOV. The two agents subsequently worked

as a team against foreigners under NOSENKO's direction; in
addition to specific targets, they had the general assign-
ment of associating with foreign visitors in Moscow for the
purpose of spotting possible homosexuals. NOSENKO described
on 12 June 1962 his use of these agents:

“Although I am a chief of section there I
have all sorts of agents. I have a good agent
apparatus. I have beautiful girls, whom I can
use as I like. I have homosexuals, in particu-
lar, one special pair. I am afraid they are
known to both you and the British... I permitted
this pair to work [without specific assignments]
on their own. I give them money and tell them
to go look around, but only Americans. Look for
American pederasts. They call me at night:
‘Yuriy Ivanovich. There is a mister so-and-so
here.' I say: 'Well, let him [do what he
wants]. We'll talk about it tomorrow.' So the
next day they go’ to a special hotel room. We
make photographs. Then we think about what he
represents. Is he worth it? Then, as Chief, I
recommend that he be recruited or not--depending:‘
on his position, what he can give, what he can
tell. If he can give something, I say: ‘Well,
let's have a go [igrat].' After this, I speak
to these boys: ‘Well, go with him again. Do
whatever is wanted.' All-‘this is observed by
the KGB. The [hotel] administrator enters.
‘What are you doing?' The administrator calls
the Militia. An akt is drawn up. ‘Well, you
are a foreigner. “This is not our business. . We
don't know what to do.with you.' Then the Chief
arrives and a conversation ensues: ‘Listen,
what shall we do? Pederasty is punishable by
three to five years and now, on the basis of
recent legislation, by up to eight. Understand,
if your friends find out that you are a pederast--
and how can they help but find out'..."

-(SEVENTH DEPARTMENT - June 1955-January 1960)

When NOSENKO moved from the Seventh Department to
the Second Chief Directorate's American Department in
January 1960, he took VOLKOV and YEFREMOV with him. They
were never used against targets in the American Embassy
but, NOSENKO said, the Seventh Department “used to call
me on homosexual prospects", VOLKOV and YEFREMOV continued
as active KGB agents until some time in 1960_or 1961.
After they were employed once more lagainst [¥.E. JOHNSON| in Ob
January 1962] it was decided that they were oo well
Known". NOSENKO claimed that the agents were retired and
that he himself sent their files to KGB Archives in 1962
or 1963.

NOSENKO's Soviet Agents: Summary

NOSENKO claims to have been these agents' case officer
for two to five years, during which he met each regularly,
assigned them operational tasks, and received their reports.
With the exception of YEFREMOV and VOLKOV, however, NOSENKO
can cite few instances of their operational use, and he has
but superficial knowledge of their personal backgrounds.

It is unlikely that this is merely the result of failing
recollection. He knows no more about the three whom he
claimed he took with him to the Embassy Section, where he
continued to be their case officer for two more years, than
he does about the others. In the two instances where his
agents were involved in KGB operational activity, NOSENKO ,,
is unaware of SHULGINA's work with LEVINE and \DRIBERG, and
was not involved when KUNGAROVA_was targetted against and
married CIA agent Philip NIELSEN. NOSENKO's familiarity

ith the nine agents he named appears to be that which
would be acquired secoand-hand, not through personal contact
as he claimed.

With respect to YEFREMOV and VOLKOV, the evidence does
not sustain NOSENKO's claim that he was their case officer
in every operation from their recruitment in 1957 until
their retirement in 1962-1963. He is unfamiliar with either
agent's background, He cannot say where either of them
lived or, indeed, how he got in touch with them when he
required their services. With the exception of thel Wz. 08

NOSENKO's Information 0b |

NOSENKO stated that at the time of|BURG arrival in
the USSR, his file contained a copy of his visa application |
(anketa), "maybe" an excerpt from a cable sent by the
ie Soviet Embassy in the United States saying that a visa had
i been granted, a routine note from Inturist giving BURGI} s fol |
i anticipated date of arrival and his itinerary inside the
[i Soviet Union, and the results of file checks of the KGB
Hl main Archives and of the First Chief Directorate Archives.

: NOSENKO himself ran the file checks, which proved to be |
H negative; there was no information on record concerning

H 0b {BURGI, and since no other_names were mentioned in the i
Ob Material available [BURGH no other checks were made. |
ob The KGB interest in |B GI\ derived exclusively from the fact

6x that he was [a professor of Slavic studie3]and therefore

had contact With students who might eventually work for the ]
ay U.S. State Department, American Intelligence, and for other
target organizations. NOSENKO did not recall who first
suggested ap attempt to recruit him.

When BURGI| arrived in the Soviet Union, he came in
contact with a number of KGB.agents, and their reports were
placed in an informal file maintained by NOSENKO. NOSENKO
could not recall how many such agents there may have been,
their names, or what they might have reported concerning

OL (Buren (6(BURGI] had an Inturist interpreter but NOSENKO did
fot Know whether he was a KGB agent.) From some source,
name forgotten by NOSENKO, the KGB obtained indications that
BURGI\was a homosexual, and it was’ decided to try to obtain
grounds for recruitment by homosexual compromise. NOSENKO |
therefore approached Yu. A. LOPUKHOV, an officer of the
British Department who handled the homosexual agent Viktor |

BELANOVSKIY, and- asked permission to use BELANOVSKIY in
setting up the compromise. “After permission had been .
received to mount an operation on this basis, LOPUKHOV and
L NOSENKO met with BELANOVSKIY and instructed him to make {
0) [BURGI" s acquaintance in a hotel dining room. The compromise
proceeded according to plan: BELANOVSKIY met {BuRcT, the
fact of common homosexuality was recognized, and [BURGI)was 06
invited to BELANOVSKIY's hotel room where homosexual acts |
took place and photographs were made. NOSENKO was in the

not meet (BuRer} at this time. |

"All right, I agree to help’... We showed him the

During the first conversation everything was made
completely clear... He was not at all willing to
help or work for Soviet Intelligence. He was told |
that he must understand that in this case "helping
Soviet Intelligence' was a very broad term. TI
remember that I told him: ‘Understand, nobody is
going to ask you that you help our friends. over .
there, or me, if I should be there, or that you do
anything bad or conduct any kind of subversive

agreed "to assist the organs of Soviet Intelligence".

Comment: In a_22 November 1957 interview with the FBI,
Ob {BuRGI) had recounted how he was compromised
and recruited by the KGBvhile in the USSR in
June 1956. His version substantially confirmed
. that.provided eight years later by NOSENKO.
Ob (Burer asserted (contrary to NOSENKO's account)
that “the KGB officers knew a good deal more
about him than what might have been acquired
06 during [BURG]]'s visit to the USSR, including
details of [BURGI]'s close relatives, his work
og fo with the [Russicum| in(Rome], his earlier travel
to Brazil, his military service in Korea, and
his acquaintance with Alexander KERENSRY.
een 25 May 1964 (BuRGr positively identified
SENKO (from a photograph) as being the
junior of the two KGB officers who recruited
him. The other KGB officer (KOZLOV) was ‘the
controlling figure and was in command".

instance of NOSENKO's participation in a KGB
operation. See Bits for comment on the

a relevance of the[BURGI}case to the period of
NOSENKO's claimed service. in the Seventh
Department.

NOSENKO's claim that |[BURGI’s compromise
and recruitment was based only on information .
routinely acquired from Bure 's visa applica-06
tion and from apparently chafce meetings with
KGB agents on his arrival in Moscow, is
contradicted by (BURGI|'s description of the 06
KGB's familiarity with his personal life.
NOSENKO cannot sustain his claim of having
personally traced| BURGI) through First chief 06
{Foreign Intelligénce]~Directorate files (the
probable repository of information on {BuRcr) 06
which the KGB recruiting officers used).

using the alias. Yuriy Ivanovich NIKOLAYEV and posing*as
"the deputy chief" of thé delegation. “Hé was specifically
instructed to observe, one member of the .delegation, a woman
named MYARIMYAYE, whose father had been killed in a Soviet

Additionally, he had the-general task of watching all

with foreigners. The delegation consisted: of approximately
60 persons and to help him in ‘carrying out.these duties,
NOSENKO was assigned three or four agents and’ several
operational contacts’ among the delegation members. He was
the only KGB security officer which. accompanied the group.

went back to England, they would tell who they were

would probably question BIRSE \especially, as one 06
who used to work in intelligence... [BIRSE) would O6
say: ‘There was this man from the Ministry of

even went to Lehingrad with us.' So they would
say: ‘How does he look [what does he look like]?!
He would say: 'He looked so-and-so.' I'd go there,
and they would look at me and say: - 'How come this
man-~his name is NOSENKO, and yet he is very
similar to the one described by [BIRSE}, ' That was O&
why it was decided I have to go again under the
name NIKOLAYEV. Just a matter of conspiracy.

Since I already became known as NIKOLAYEV to the
Britishers, this would be noticeable."

Comment: That NOSENKO (as_NIKOLAYEV) took the trips is
corroborated by|British records, according to\|
which, a Yuriy IVanovich NIKOLAVEV, born 30
October 1927, arrived at London from Brussels
on 20 August 1957. His visa application
described him as a member of a group invited
by the Light Athletics Association to partici-
pate in contests in London. He left on 27
August 1957. With the same name and date of
birth, NIKOLAYEV arrived again at London on
12 October 1958 with seventeen others, all
described as boxers. His visa application
described him as an "office worker", but.on
his landing card, NIKOLAYEV was listed as a
boxer. He left London on 19 October 1958.

On neither visit did NIKOLAYEV attract the
attention of any(British security service} 09
While these trips are corroborated, they
are not material to NOSENKO's claims to have

NOSENKO's Information

NOSENKO personally and alone recruited the Moscow
representative of [British European Airways}, whose nameC 4
NOSENKO did not recall, at the Hotel Metrépol in Moscow
during the summer of 1959, possibly in August. The approach
was based on homosexual compromise involving NOSENKO's
agents VOLKOV and YEFREMOV.

NOSENKO explained that the Seventh Department in 1959
had a section dealing with commercial representatives, which
was responsible for the(BEA| man. That section had asked
NOSENKO's section for help.'29

“They said they didn't have any agents or any-
thing and didn't know what to do. So somebody said,
‘Well look, why don't you ask the chief of the
section? He's a specialist on homosexuals and can
arrange everything for you.' So I wound up handling
the case, and TARABRIN (of the First Chief Direct-
orate) said I should report to him."

(In this passage NOSENKO was referring to himself, although
he has always claimed he was Deputy chief of the section.]

Operational Activities - 1955-1960: Summary

According to NOSENKO, after an uneventful assignment in
the American Department's Embassy Section, in 1955 he was
transferred to the newly-organized Seventh Department
Tourist Section as a case officer. Between 1955 and 1957
he assembled.a network of agents and: was involved in four
KGB attempts to recryuit_foreign tourists. One of these
attempts, that against/Richard BURG], was the first recruit-06
ment of the Tourist Section; it won NOSENKO.a commendation,
brought him to the attention of General GRIBANOV, and turned
NOSENKO into an effective and successful KGB officer. In
1958 NOSENKO was promoted to the position of Deputy Chief
of the American-British Commonwealth Section. He then
recruited the second member of his two-man homosexual team
and, in 1958 and 1959, participated in ten KGB attempts to

7 recruit American and British visitors to the USSR and one
American resident of Moscow. NOSENKO's success in the
Seventh Department prompted GRIBANOV to transfer him back

Q the American Embassy Section as Deputy Chief with the
sey ical priority task of reviving KGB operations against

‘cican Embassy code clerks. :

It is worthy of note that of the fifteen cases in which
he personally participated, by his own admission, NOSENKO
became involved in nine not because they were operations of
his section, but because the targets were the victims of
homosexual or other entrapment. In addition, three of the
fifteen operations were not directed by his section, but
by senior Seventh Department officers. According to his
own statements, four others were specifically the responsi-
bility of other Seventh Department sections of KGB elements,
including the Foreign Seamen Section (GEHRCKENS) , Delega- 7S

Of Obtions Section [LANE angOTRS®) Commercial Representatives

Seventh Department operation: by NOSENKO's other statements,
she was not a "tourist" and she would have been the target -
of. the Moscow Oblast KGB because of her intention to sees

a Soviet citizen.

While NOSENKO' s participa on in. the attempted recruit-
ment of the targets he describes, even where not confirmed,
is not disputed, the evidence suggest that he was an
English-speaking specialist in sexual entrapment, not a
counterintelligence officer responsible for the identifi-.-

Comment: NOSENKO has never resolved why these cases,
which predated the records he claimed he
reviewed, were included in his notes. More

+ important, he never could explain why he was
unfamiliar with American tourist cases which
occurred at a time. when he claimed that he
was Deputy Chief of the American-British
Commonwealth Section and was knowledgeable
of all such cases.

KGB Counterintelligence Operations
Among Foreign Tourists, 1955-1960 ]

Besides those operations in which NOSENKO claimed personal
involvement or about which he learned in his capacity of
Deputy Chief of the American-British Commonwealth Section,
NOSENKO claimed awareness of what the KGB. knew of the use
of tourists in the USSR.by foreign intelligence services

“throughout the 1955-1960 period. Information from other
Sources. serves as'a basis for judging the validity of
NOSENKO's claim.

NOSENKO's Information

NOSENKO's Tourist Study

Sometime between May and October 1959, during the

5 tourist season, NOSENKO was ordered. to gather facts for

i Second Chief Directorate Chief GRIBANOV concerning the use
of tourist cover by foreign intelligence services during
the. period 1955 through 1958. NOSENKO said he assembled
this material from the Seventh Department's annual reports
of the years 1955-1958, supplemented by information he
obtained from discussions with knowledgeable Seventh

. Department case officers. NOSENKO recalled only that the
study incorporated statistical data on the growth of
foreign tourism; he did not remember the content of the
study, any examples included in it, or what the study
concluded about American or British Intelligence tourist

“Extent of KGB Knowledge

According ‘to NOSENKO,° operations against foreign tourists
were developing slowly during this period and very little
was known by the’ KGB about the American Intelligence use
of. tourism atthe time:he wrote the study in 1959.» No
agents were definitely identified among American tourists,

June 1959 a three-day conference was held in London between
CIA and MI-6 representatives, at the conclusion of which a
nineteen-page document was drawn up which described opera-
tional doctrine on tourist operations, including agent

SEVENTH DEPARTMENT ~ 1955-1960: Summary and Conclusion

NOSENKO's description of the activities of the Second
Chief Directorate Seventh Department in this period is
almost solely restricted to his account of these fifteen
KGB operations. Other than to allege that certain KGB
officers he named were his subordinates, he provided no
information to substantiate his claim that he had any
supervisory or. administrative responsibilities. The common
feature of the operations do not relate to NOSENKO's own
description of the function of the Seventh Department's
Tourist Section or later, to the American-British Common-
wealth Section. Most were sexual or other entrapment
Operations, and he acknowledges that several were operations
conducted by KGB elements other than his own section, In
short, NOSENKO need not have been in the Seventh Department
sections, as he claims, to have learned of or participated
in the activities he describes, Although NOSENKO gives a
graphic account of the Second Chief Directorate's (and his i...
own) counterintelligence mission, his knowledge is not of
counterintelligence operations among tourists; in the only
three such operatiions he describes, the counterintelligence
aspects were incidental. Contrary to his claims, NOSENKO
is aware neither of all important KGB operations conducted
against American tourists during the period, nor what was
known to the KGB about American Intelligence and British
tourist operations.

‘ ¢NOSENKO claims to have served as Deputy Chief of the’ -
“American Embassy Section of the American Department, KGB
» Second Chief Directorate, from sometime in. January: 1960.

2 untilthe first days of January: 1962... This:section,:in
~°his words, was working against "the most important counter-=

The’ functions of the American Embassy Section were:
« G@escribed. by NOSENKO. as béing to’ monitor’all contacts: by

“information possible on American Embassy employees, and

‘p to use. this, information asa basis for planning ‘and imple=

! personal relationships, weaknesses, daily routines, security
F ves" preeautions, contacts with Soviet eitizens, and the major

and minor. scandals in their Moscow lives formed the basis

f for this work. ‘To gather such information, the: section's
.officers employed large numbers of agents and informants
among the indigenous employeés. of the Embassy, Soviet .
-e¢itizens moving in Embassy social circles, and third-country
-nationals ‘with American contacts.. The officers also
benefitted from the reports of numerous surveillance teams
at their disposal, as well.as information obtained from
telephone taps and microphones. in Americans’ offices and
homes. Each officer had a limited number ‘of. American
targets with whom he attempted to become thoroughly familiar.
Annually, they submitted detailed operational plans, for é

(AMERICAN EMBASSY SECTION ~ January 1960-January 1962)

exploiting the knowledge they had gained of their targets.

During 1960 and 1961, NOSENKO said, within the section |
special emphasis was placed on “identifying intelligence

officers in the Embassy and actively developing them,

acquiring ciphers, and painstakingly studying code clerks, E:
creating the basis on which they can be recruited". {.

As Deputy Chief of this section, NOSENKO said, he had
access to all information concerning its activities:
"Nothing was hidden" from him. On this basis, he expressed
certainty that in 1960 and 1961 the KGB recruited no
Americans associated with the Embassy, there were no KGB
agents among americans assigned to the Embassy in this
period and, in fact, the KGB had recruited no American
Embassy personnel since “ANDREY" (Dayle SMITH, recruited
ca. 1953, see p. 33). From continuing friendships with
his fellow-officers of 1960-and 1961, who remained in the
section when NOSENKO transferred, NOSENKO has also claimed
certainty that there were no KGB recruitments from the
time he left the section in January 1962 until his January
1964 departure in Geneva.

Transfer to. the American Embassy Section i =

In December 1959, while serving as Deputy Chief of the
American Section of the Seventh Department, NOSENKO learned
from the Department Chief DUBAS of plans to transfer him
back to the American Department's American Embassy Section, ae
as Deputy Chief. NOSENKO said he was opposed to the move
and wanted to remain in the Seventh Department:

"J was used to it there and wanted to continue.
I wanted to stay in the Seventh Department. This
{the transfer] was no promotion. Here I was the
Deputy Chief of section and would be the same
there. The American Department is, of course, the
most important. But here I was working against
American tourists. This is also important.
Furthermore, I showed [had proven] myself there in
'55, '56, ‘57, '58, and '59 and was considered to
be not a bad case officer. And there, in the
American Department, I must prove myself with new

people."

NOSENKO therefore asked DUBAS to try to retain*him.. DUBAS
later told NOSENKO that he had twice spoken to Second Chief

‘Directorate’ Chief 0. M..GRIBANOV on his behalf; but. to no’

avail..-In January 1960 the official orders transferring

NOSENKO' were issued, :.

On the..day NOSENKO reported to V.A.. KLYPIN, Chief of
the American Department, to begin his new. job, he was. told
to report to GRIBANOV's office... NOSENKO expressed his
misgivings about the change of assignment. to GRIBANOV.
GRIBANOV replied that DUBAS had spoken to him but that’he,’.

“;GRIBANOV; "had -his own plans and that was all"... GRIBANOV.:
“told NOSENKO that he thought NOSENKO could bring "fresh air"
“to ‘the. American. Embassy Section's operations and that he
‘was to’pay particular attention to operations against

American code clerks, the."number one target".

Predecessor as Deputy Chief

Asked on 17 April.1964 whom he ‘had: relieved upon reporting:
for duty in the American Embassy Section, NOSENKO replied:
"No one." Hé assumed responsibility for thé Embassy ‘security
file. from KOVSHUK.- Various case officers éarlier had been

.-xesponsible for Embassy Security Officer Russell LANGELLE,

including MALYUGIN, then KUSKOV,, KOVSHUK, ‘and KLYPIN;. but
LANGELLE. had been. expelled from the Soviet. Union in October —

On several occasions. between” January ‘and: June 1964 NOSENKO:

“had referred to.a KGB officer named Mikhail Fedorovich

BAKHVALOV-~but. never in connection with the American satin :

.Section...Thus,'-in January he first: identified him.as. .

Colonel Mikhail BAKHVALOV,, the Deputy ‘Chief of the Fifth
(Eastern Countries)’ Department. ~.In February he identified
a V.A. ALEKSEYEV..as..the alias. of a Mikhail-Fedorovich,. last

name not recalled, ‘who was Deputy Chief of the Fifth

Department. In‘June, in“listing KGB officers who had
received various awards for their service, NOSENKO included

on 18 June 1964 NOSENKO was asked to list the names of
all officers who had either joined or departed the American
Embassy Section from the time NOSENKO was transferred to

the Seventh Department in 1955 to his return to the American
Embassy Section in 1960. NOSENKO listed fourteen officers
as having joined the section, and five who had been trans~
ferred out. In neither list did NOSENKO mention BAKHVALOV.

A week ‘later, however, on 24 June 1964 NOSENKO stated
that "in 1959 and possibly in 1958 Mikhail Fedorovich
BAKHVALOV was the Deputy Chief of the American Embassy
Section. I replaced him in his position in 1960 and he

went to the Fifth Department as Deputy Chief". In September
1964 NOSENKO asserted that BAKHVALOV, as Deputy Chief, [not
the others he had identified earlier] had been LANGELLE's
case officer. In 1965 NOSENKO first mentioned that
BAKHVALOV, not KOVSHUK, had been responsible for maintaining
the Embassy security file and stated that BAKHVALOV had
shared with KOVSHUK responsibility for supervising code
clerk operations. :

Comment: Interrogation has never resolved contradictions
between NOSENKO'S earlier accounts of what
functions he assumed from. whom when he entered

the Section, and his belated assertions that
BAKHVALOV: was his predecessor as Deputy. Chief.

Hl Responsibilities

H Shortly after reporting. for duty in the American Embassy
Section and following his short discussion with GRIBANOV,
NOSENKO said he met with American Department Chief KLYPIN
and Embassy Section Chief KOVSHUK to discuss his responsi-~
pilities and functions in the section. Repeating what
GRIBANOV had said, KLYPIN stressed that NOSENKO's most
important single responsibility in the section would be
supervision of all KGB operational activity against American
military and State Department code clerks stationed in
Moscow. As for the other Americans at the Embassy, KLYPIN

Since his defection NOSENKO has maintained under repeated
interrogation that as general ‘deputy to KOVSHUK, with the
responsibility of taking over in KOVSHUK's absence, he had
access to and was obliged to keep current on all information
relating to the section's activities. On this basis he
has assured his questioners that the KGB was ‘completely
unsuccessful in its attempts to recruit Americans assigned
to the Embassy in these two years. NOSENKO has also said
at various times that his access to section files and his

In the two years of NOSENKO's service in the section
there were a total of-over three months when he said KOVSHUK
was 111 or on leave, NOSENKO recalled that he was Acting
Chief during KOVSHUK's two 30-day leave periods in 1960 ana
1961, although he did not remember precisely in which months.
He also served as Acting Chief for about a month in the
summer of 1960 when KOVSHUK was in the KGB hospital with
heart trouble and for a week or two some time in 1961, again
when KOVSHUK was ill, .He recalled that KOVSHUK was also
absent for several days in connection with preparations for
President Eisenhower's planned visit to the Soviet Union in
1960.

As Acting Chief in KOVSHUK's absence, NOSENKO stated that
he was responsible for supervising the administrative work
and operational activity of the entire section and, in
particular, for assuming KOVSHUK's work in directing
operations against diplomatic personnel assigned to the
American Embassy.

NOSENKO could recall no operational decisions that he
made as acting chief, nor any specific or unusual occurrences
during these times. NOSENKO said that the only specific
responsibility of KOVSHUK's which he handled in the Chief's
absence was repotting to the Chief of the First Department
about all correspondence going out of the Embassy Section.
NOSENKO Stated he met none of KOVSHUK's agents during his
absences, nor could he remember any of them except- GLAZUNOV
[whom NOSENKO said in April 1964 was his own agent and later
said was. "KOVSHUK's and FEDYANIN's"] and the American
correspondent STEVENS |{about whom NOSENKO had reported in
connection: wi his activities in 1953-55].

According to NOSENKO, KOVSHUK had personal contact, under
Ministry of Foreign Affairs cover, with "some" American a
Embassy officers, but the only such Embassy officer he could
identify was WINTERS, and he knew of no details about
KOVSHUK's relations with hin. .

Ob
Supervisor of All Code Clerk Operations

NOSENKO said that, upon assuming responsibility for
supervising operations against American code clerks, he
found a very “difficult situation", Prior to the assignment
of KOSOLAPOV to the American Embassy Section in late 1959,
all operations against code clerks had been handled by
MALYUGIN, but during MALYUGIN's two years of effort there
had been no operational approaches and no successes. When
NOSENKO took over there were no active developmental
operations against code clerks under way, he stated, and
the only agents or operational contacts being used against
them were poorly educated maids and waitresses none of
whom had accomplished anything of importance. No non-Soviet
citizen agents were being used in operations against code-
room personnel,

According to NOSENKO, in January or February of 1960
GRYAZNOV was assigned to the American Embassy Section as a
Second assistant to NOSENKO in his code clerk activities.
From this point on, NOSENKO; KOSOLAPOV, and GRYAZNOV shared
the same KGB Headquarters office. There, all KGB files on
American code clerks as well as the files on all agents
available for work against them, were stored in one large
safe accessible to all three officers. NOSENKO supervised
all of the section's. work along these: lines, and no provo-
cations, compromises, recruitment attempts, or recruitments
could have been planned or carried out without his prior
knowledge and agreement when he was in Moscow. If NOSENKO
was absent on a trip, he would have been told about any such
activity upon his return,

NOSENKO said that he carefully directed the work of
GRYAZNOV and KOSOLAPOV during these two years, discussing
their cases with them, taking part in operational planning,
and approving or disapproving all operational measures.

GOLITSYN's Information About KGn Operations Against Embassy
Code Clerks in 1960-1961

The most significant collateral information about KGB
Operations against American code clerks in this period,
with which to compare NOSENKO's assertions fon this topic],
is that provided by GOLITSYN after his defection in 1961.

GOLITSYN identified KOSOLAPOV and GRYAZNOV by name and
from photograph as being two veteran KGB officers, personally
known to him, who were in 1960 “working against code clerks
in the American Embassy in Moscow." With respect to the
priority attached to the recruitment of American code clerks
in 1960, GOLITSYN commented in 1961 that: "The task of
strengthening of work against Americans had been a standing
requirement, both in the past and most particularly fin
1960]. This work was particularly intensified after the
appointment of SHELEPIN.to the KGB... In 1960, it was
recommended in the KGB to intensify the work against the
Americans at the Embassy in Moscow, and against American
colonies in other, countries... This question of intensifying
work against the Americans was up before the Collegium of
the KGB. Thereafter there was a directive from SIIFLEPIN
regarding the intensification of work against the American
cipher-clerks."

GOLITSYN said that NOSENKO was not assigned to the Embassy
Section in 1960-1961, since if he had been GOLITSYN would
have known about it.

Preparing for his assignment to Welsinki, GOLITSYN. in
the spring of 1960 visited the Embassy Section and learned
from GRYAZNOV that the latter had as an agent an Fmbassy
code clerk who was scheduled to be transferred to Helsinki.
The code clerk had already provided the KGB with some infor-
mation and he was considered by the KGB to be a “real”
agent. GOLITSYN was told by GRYAZNOV that, if the code clerk's
transfer materialized, GOLITSYN might have him in Helsinki
as his agent.

GOLITSYN also. learned from GRYAZNOV in spring of 1960
that the latter had developed an operation against an
. Embassy military code clerk in which the KGB was. "99 per
cent, sure" that, the target would be recruited,

GRYAZNOV informed GOLITSYN in April or May ‘1960-that an
American’ employee ‘of the ‘Embassy in-Moscow, possibly:a code
clerk, was either recruited or prepared for recruitment on
the basis. of homosexual. compromise’ beginning in 1959. and
concluding in 1960. The KGB had photographed the American
in various homosexual: acts but. SHELEPIN, who had -jJust become
Chairman of the KGB, at the time was’stressing ideological
rather than blackmail recruitments. “SHELEPIN said that the
“homosexual ‘blackmail ‘was in-this instance “too dirty", and
the KGB. should find another basis for. recruitment... SHELEPIN
did not exclude future use of the Photographs, which: the _KGB
would hold. in reserve. i

“casé. . GOLITSYN. reasoned that there would be no reluctance
to discuss the case if it had been unsuccessful, and that
therefore KOSOLAPOV must have been ‘successful ‘in developing

According to official U.S. Government records,

Service Attaches of the Embassy in Moscow as

of 1960 shared a single cryptographic center

and a single military code clerk (except when

two code clerks overlapped ‘during periods of

turnover). The military code clerk was respan-

sible for enciphering and deciphering the

traffic of all three military services. In

practice, at least one other member of the

Service Attaches' ‘offices. in Moscow held a

cryptographic clearance and was trained to

replace the- regular military code clerk when

the_latter was absent. >

Recruiting a military code clerk from the Embassy was the
American Embassy Section's “number one assignment", and for
a year NOSENKO was involved in-an operation against such a
target almost ‘to the exclusion of all‘other ‘duties. The
. case was considered to be the “number ‘one" case, and KGB
Chairman SHELEPIN as well as ‘Second Chief ‘Directorate Chief
GRIBANOV impatiently inquired ‘as to its progress. The fee tey
was ‘an American [Army sergeant with about 20 years' service 0

at Of developing le target, NOSENKO recruited a foreigner who
visited the USSR frequently. The "third-national" agent was
placed in contact with the American; and they ‘had several
drinking bouts together. After about ‘two months, NOSENKO
instructed his agent to take the American to the agent's
hotel room and introduce him there to a KGB female agent.

the State Department, The American was adamant in his
refusal, although he was held in ‘the hotel room all night
jong. At about six o'clock in the morning the KGB officers

needed at the Embassy because an enciphered telegram had
arrived. The American was ‘then released.

The KGB "knew" that the American did not report the
recruitment attempt. Using that circumstance for blackmail
rather than the incriminating Photographs, the KGB planned
another attempt to recruit him if he ever returned abroad.

When the non-Soviet agent used in the first year of
developing the American target had come to the attention of
GOLITSYN, GOLITSYN visited the Embassy ‘Section :to'see if he
could use him in First Chief Directorate operations abroad.
NOSENKO was on leave at the time, but GOLITSYN talked with
another Embassy Section officer. GOLITSYN was told "Don't
touch him, he's ours". [The relevance of this incident is
discussed below.]

(@ingI In repeating the suhsftance of his 1962 account of
the KGB recruitment attempt, NOSENKO emphasized his personal
xole in directing both [PREISFREUND] and the KGB officer

GRIBANOV and KOVSHUK, not NOSENKO, actually made: the
recruitment attempt. NOSENKO was not present; he waited
gutside the room with GRYAZNOV. Neither did NOSENKO recruit

On 15 June he had been called to the office of Army Attache

id not recognize him.
According to NOSENKO, the KGB "sensed at
DdSonce" that (KEYSERS\was a homosexual. He is
unaware of cértain information relating to
06 KEYSERS|! homosexual activities, drinking, and
difficulties with his superiors, although that
information was available through KGB agents in
America House and had been widely discussed in

A proposal for the operation was prepared for the approvai
of the KGB Chairman which explained that code clerks were
assigned to Moscow usually only for one year [thus limiting
their accessibility to the KGB for development] and that it
was necessary to attempt to place an agent near them even
before they arrived in Moscow. When the Chairman's approval
was granted, NOSENKO prepared the kharakteristika (official
form) on KOSOLAPOV for the trip and gave it to the Personnel
Office. KOSOLAPOV wrote a cable for Helsinki explaining that
he was coming for two or three days. NOSENKO didn't sign the
cable, but read it, and it was taken to KLYPIN for his signa-
ture and thereafter KOSOLAPOV took it tothe Second (Furopean)
Department of the First ‘Chief Directorate for release. There
was no other correspondence with the Helsinki rezidentura
concerning the operation before KOSOLAPOV departed Moscow.

NOSENKO read KOSOLAPOV's otchet (official account) of
his trip, and the report of the female agent, “SOLISTKA".
According to those reports, KOSOLAPOV became acquainted on

NOSENKO's Information

NOSENKO on 28 January 1964 identified twenty Americans
employed by the American Embassy in Moscow who were of
interest for various reasons to the KGB. He gave a short

tatement concerning each of the twenty, among which was
[GARLAND, about whom NOSENKO said, "Code clerk, but nothing
doing"S Later asked to review the list: and supply any
additional information he might have, NOSENKO stated that
the KGB was studying (GARLAND) like the other code clerks, to
gather enough incriminating material to make a recruitment.
The case officer was KOSOLAPOV. NOSENKO did not recall any
agents working against (GARLAND! hor could he recall whether
he had read the KGB file on GARLAND, ut he thought he must
have read reports concerning-him aS they came into the
Embassy Section. There Was no Operational plan drawn up
for (GARLAND) because the KGB developed no derogatory infor-
mation concerning him;-no recruitment thus was ever planned
or attempted. NOSENKO could recall no background informa-
tion concerning Garand, 0 uch as his travels and acquain-
tances whiie stationed” in Moscow. é

Wine they, or not GARLAND) was aware, and contrary to NOSENKO's

assertior?|GARLAND(clearly was the target of a KGB operation

entailing KOSOLAPOV's travel to Helsinki. NOSENKO denies

(with a vehemence which the foregoing summary cannot accurately

reflect) that KQSOLAPOV, travelled to Helsinki except in

connection with|JENNER))"and his assertion thus cannot be
ysmissed as the product of fault recollecgion in which he
onfuses the casescof JENNER} and GARLAND, ©

NOSENKO's denial of the facts of the(GARLAND\case is fatal
to his claims that he was KOSOLAPOV's supervisor, and that
he supervised all KGB operations against American code clerks.
Moreover, the KGB action in the(GARLAND case impugns NOSENKO' sO)
claim that, as one time Deputy C ef of the Section, he would
necessarily know of any operations mounted against Embassy
code clerks.

KGB/Polish UB Operations Against, -
At his first meeting with CIA on 9 June 1962 NOSENKO
made a passing reference to an operation in which he had
placed a female Potisn UB: agent in contact with an unnamed
American from the Embassy while the latter was visiting
Warsaw and later brought the agent to Moscow to further
compromise the American. On 11 June 1962 NOSENKO was asked
whether he had foreign (non-Russian) agents working against
the American Embassy, and he replied that he himself
introduced the idea of using such agents to develop
Americans afraid of becoming involved with Russian girls.
He had several such agents, he said, and he sometimes asked
the East German and Polish security services to supply him
with such agents. As an example, NOSENKO cited the case
of a Marine guard and a code clerk from the Embassy who
] travelled to Warsaw. The code clerk was intimate with a
Polish female agent, whom NOSENKO had planted in their
train compartment, on the train ‘to Warsaw, and later in

i Moscow.

SARWAT EL SHAZLY, an Egyptian employed at the Egyptian

value that NOSENKO recalled. (4

Pietro CECCHI, an Italian cook at the American Embassy
and KOSOLAPOV's agent, reported everything he heard or saw
about Americans to KOSOLAPOV, but NOSENKO recalled nothing
specific that CECCHI had reported puerta

In early 1960 GRYAZNOV went to East Berlin to obtain two
German women who could be used against the residents of
America House.. One of these, Hanna, a blonde, was documented
as a West German. NOSENKO never met her but instructed
PREISFREUND) (see the [STORSBERG)€ase) to take her to America

louse and Teave her of her own. Hanna went several times to
America House in 1961, but NOSENKO can recall nothing that
she may. have reported on (HORONE} Uo The ‘second East German
girl was documented as an Austrian; NOSENKO never met her
but he recalled that she was asked for her documents at
America House on her first or second visit there. She
replied that she had left them at her hotel, left America
House, and never returned. (NOSENKO did not remember the
time when this incident occurred, beyond the fact that he
was still in the Embassy Section and that ABIDIAN was the
Embassy security officer at the time.)

From one of these agents ,0 x possibly in some other
manner, the KGB learned that [Moron was planning to go on
leave in Warsaw. NOSENKO, KOSOLAPOV, and GRYAZNOV thereupon
decided to employ a Polish female agent in an attempt to
compromise him. KOSOLAPOV wrote the draft of the operational
plan for the attempt, which was approved by GRIBANOV after

Because the KGB still lacked compromising materials,
KOSOLAPOV prepared a paper requesting that the girl again

the apartment. of a Soviet woman, to catch him-in something
that was definitely prohibited. For this. purpose, Svetlana
IVANOVA (see above) was supposed to lure MORONE? out. of 0
America House to somewhere in Moscow, but before an: thing,
further could be done, the Americans ordered |MORONE|out of

Supervisor of all Code Clerk Operations: |
Summary and Conclusion

According to'NOSENKO, on transfer to the Embassy Section, |
operations against the American code clerks were the Section's
priority task and thus his most ‘important single responsibility
as Deputy Chief. He asserts to be complete his awareness of |
what was known to the KGB on this topic at the time, because
of his senior position, his personal review of relevant files
and correspondence, his personal direction of KOSOLAPOV and
GRYAZNOV, and his personal participation in their operations. |
Without exception, in every one of the cases NOSENKO describes
there are facts substantially at variance with his account,
in direct proportion to the amount of collateral information |
available.

Conclusion

From the foregoing it is concluded that he was neither
Deputy Chief of the Embassy Section nor supervisor of all
operations against American code clerks. Consequently,
he would not necessarily have known of recruitments among
other Embassy personnel.

first time explicitly claimed to have been the KGB case
officer responsible for ABIDIAN in Moscow and for the first
time described ABIDIAN's alleged servicing of a deaddrop in
\! 1960. NOSENKO has described ABIDIAN since 1964 as the sole
Hi American for whom NOSENKO was personally accountable during
j his 1960-1961 Embassy Section service, and one of the most
important counterintelligence targets of the Embassy Section
i and therefore of the entire Second Directorate.

Duties as. a Case Officer
When he reported for duty in the Embassy Section NOSENKO

was told by KLYPIN and KOVSHUK that one of his duties would

be case officer for ABIDIAN, whose arrival in Moscow was

then expected in the near future. ABIDIAN was to be. the

only American target for whom NOSENKO personally was officially

accountable while he served in this section. KOVSHUK gave

NOSENKO such information as the section had on ABIDIAN.

-Included was ABIDIAN's visa application, the negative results

of checks of KGB Headquarters files, and a report prepared

by the American Department of the First Chief Directorate.

According to that report, which was based on correspondence

from the KGB Legal Residencies in the United States, ABIDIAN

had served as a Department of State Security Officer concerned
with ‘the safety of Premier Khrushchev when he visited the
United States in 1959; from ABIDIAN's behavior at that: time,
the Legal Residencies concluded. he was an intelligence officer,
‘probably’ with CIA. That report. and the fact that ABIDIAN was
replacing the *known CIA officer Russell. LANGELLE as Security
Officer, made ABIDIAN one of the most important counter- :
intelligence ‘targets of the Embassy Section and therefore
of the. entire Second’ Chief Directorate. : :

““.NOSENKO personally ‘opened the KGB file on ABIDIAN ana
later ‘adopted for him: the cryptonym "ARSEN" used earlier by

. personnel of. the. Seventh (Surveillance) Directorate. of the:
Second: Chief Directorate.

“<NOSENKO was unsuccessful in his attempts to. learn more
“about. the life and career’ of ABIDIAN. He visited the -Chief
of the American’ Department of’ thé KGB First Chief Directorate,
. but that°unit had no‘ information not included in its original

report. NOSENKO requested that ‘the KGB Legal Residencies in

the United States’ be asked for further details, but none were
ever received... NOSENKO thus never’ learned of ABIDIAN's
education. and study abroad, date of entry-into the Department

of State, promotions, personal rank, previous assignments,
“military service, or foreign. service status::. .

Prior. to. ABIDIAN's arrival,in Moscow, .the: KGB decided not
to work. aggressively against him with agent contacts or
provocateurs:unless he first demonstrated some personal
vulnerability. ~It was considered better to concentrate on
Surveillance ‘coverage “in the. hope..that,. as LANGELLE"s

successor,.he might lead "to another POPOV". - [POPOV, a
GRU. Lieutenant Colonel‘ and CIA agent, according to KGB
Sources... was apprehended in’ 1959.]

‘Was made a “special target"’of surveillance from ‘the date of
Ais arrival. He was always. under 24-hour surveillance by”
at least. two: and often three, KGB teams, so that .at. any. hour -
a team was available’ to cover him if he left. the Embassy.
‘The only time this intensity-of coverage might have been
reduced ,. NOSENKO said, was during a period of about one and
cne~half months in 1961, when surveillance of the Embassy

was generally reduced in order to allow increased coverage
of British targets in connection with the PENKOVSKIY case.
As the responsible -case officer, NOSENKO directed the
surveillance of ABIDIAN and evaluated the operational
possibilities offered by information from surveillance
reports,

In line with the emphasis on surveillance, the opera-
tional plan for ABIDIAN written by NOSENKO in October 1960
called for no direct action but specified that:

~ABIDIAN's maid Tatyana FEDOROVICH, an “operational
contact" of the Embassy Section, was to continue to apply
metka to ABIDIAN's clothing and "NEPTUNE-80" to his shoes.
(According to NOSENKO, these are surveillance aids. Metka
is a "thief powder" applied to clothing pockets, leaving a
trace on anything with which it comes into contact. Its
primary purpose is to.aid in the detection of operational
letters mailed by suspected foreign intelligence officers
and agents. NEPTUNE-80, applied to a target's shoes,
leaves a trace on the ground which the KGB even long after-
wards can follow with a dog.) The only item of information
received from FEDOROVICH was that ABIDIAN was having an
affair with an Embassy female employee. FEDOROVICH was
unable to find personal mail or personal papers in ABIDIAN's
ppartment.

Pietro CECCHI, Embassy employee and KOSOLAPOV's
agent, was to try to cultivate ABIDIAN and report whatever
he learned concerning him. CECCHI never obtained any
significant information on ABIDIAN's personal life.
"ABIDIAN was developing CECCHI as an informant on American
personnel at the Embassy", but NOSENKO did not recall any
specific report CECCHI gave to ABIDIAN that was of interest
to the Embassy Section, : .

~Two Embassy chauffeurs were to apply NEPTUNE~80 to
the floorboards and foot pedals of ABIDIAN's car if

no further action was taken. [See below for ABIDIAN's

account of a similar incident, but one which Occurred in
Armenia.]

NOSENKO did not know the room number of ABIDIAN's office
in the Embassy or on what floor it was located, but he could

phone list published monthly, since it contained the office
room number of each American employee. [The Embassy telephone
list contained apartment, but not office room numbers.]

office areas). NOSENKO said that a report from an agent

ABIDIAN's office door which said "Security Office". [there
was no. such sign.] -NOSENKO was unable to determine if
ABIDIAN had a secretary. No dictation was monitored in

times while stationed in Moscow, NOSENKO did not know to
which countries he went or the time of year when the trips
were made. Such information would have been of interest to

~Receiving, reading, and filing all reports of
surveillance and other Operational activity carried
out by various KGB units.

NOSENKO was certain that he took none of these steps. Even
if he were absent when such a request for travel was made,
he would have seen all documents upon his return; he did
not recall seeing any such documents in ABIDIAN's file.

Comment :

ABIDIAN who is of Armenian origin and speaks
the Armenian language with a high degree of
proficiency, made a trip to Armenia between 5
and 9 October 1960. While in Armenia ABIDIAN
visited with various churchmen, their parish-
ioners and an Armenian who. had repatriated from
Greece in 1946. ABIDIAN attended a service in
Echmiadzin celebrating the anniversary of the
accession ‘of the Katolikos VAZGEN I, and also
visited some relatives of his in or near the
city of Yerevan. After returning to Moscow,
an Armenian whom ABIDIAN met on that trip
tried to contact ABIDIAN at the Embassy, but
ABIDIAN refused to see him.

After being told ABIDIAN had attended a
service celebrating the fifth anniversary of
the Armenian Katolikos, VAZGEN I, NOSENKO
recalled that ABIDIAN had gone. to Echmiadzin
and that an agent: had reported a contact with
him there. This agent, NOSENKO recalled, was
a priest or a monk, and the report concerned
only his conversation with ABIDIAN; the agent
had ‘no further contact with him.- NOSENKO said
that this was his sole recollection concerning
ABIDIAN's trip.

With reference to ABIDIAN's travel to
Armenia in October 1960, NOSENKO recalled
having. been on- leave at the time. However,
NOSENKO's reconstruction of the timing of his
alleged leave still placed him in Moscow at
the time of ABIDIAN's trip. In 1966, NOSENKO

stated that he had lied, that his 1960 leave

was taken in January, not October.

Except, for the American woman with whom ABIDIAN was’
thought,.to have .been. intimate, -NOSENKO knew none of
j ABIDIAN's close American friends in Moscow nor his close
4 friends and professional: contacts'among foreigners there,

: NOSENKO received and read transcripts of all telephone
calls that ABIDIAN made or received at his office and
apartment via the Moscow city telephone system, but he

recalled none of their names nor nationalities, because

[ there was nothing of:interest in' the conversations.

At the end of the January-February 1965 interrogations
concerning ABIDIAN NOSENKO acknowledged that he knew little
‘about this important KGB target. He was "working badly" as
ABIDIAN's case:officer, he said, because he had had to

ABIDIAN's Léttér Mailings

| e During. the 1962 meetings with .NOSENKO. in Geneva, -he
sie reported KGB knowledge of ABIDIAN's mailing of at least
_ i “three clandestine letters, in each case to KGB-controlled
| agents. ‘According to NOSENKO, the KGB.detected, all. the
“>. letters mailed.by. ABIDIAN through..the use of metka. He
cautioned the CIA representatives: from further use of Embass
} ‘employees for'mailing letters to agents in the Soviet :
j -Union.:', He noted that after LANGELLE,; no such letters were
mailed for a year anda half, until ABIDIAN mailed several:
“He-expiained that"Embassy employeés': servants applied an
dorless substance (metka) to clothing pockets, and. traces
of the substance rubbed off on any.thing it contacted, such
as.a letter. All“the letters mailed in Moscow were passed
; through a machine which’ ‘identified letters bearing. tracing
of metka, he said, and this was. how ‘letters ABIDIAN mailed
were intercepted. ©.[NOSENKO said the machine was a fotoapparat, |
literally a camera, ‘but presumably he. meant some sort of
/ light-sensitive’ device.]° NOSENKO recalled that ABIDIAN had
mailed.a letter to someone in Odessa, and two to. the Baltic
“area, ‘probably -to Riga, and all were detected by metka, not
. by ABIDIAN's) surveillants. According to NOSENKO, no new
agents were discovered, however, since all of the agents to

KGB. : =

(AMERICAN EMBASSY SECTION - January 1960-January 1962)

Comment: NOSENKO's information is substantially correct,
that no letters were mailed for one and a half
years after LANGELLE's expulsion, and that
ABIDIAN mailed two or three letters, including
ones to the Baltic area and to Odessa. No
letters were mailed from February 1960 until
ABIDIAN mailed one on 1 April 1961, and of the
three letters ABIDIAN mailed, one was to Odessa
and one each to Latvia and Estonia.

CIA has conducted tests to determine whether
a substance such as metka was being used as a
KGB control device. Ultra-violet, chemical
and microscopic analyses developed one possible
use of a metka like substance. Analysis of an
article of clothing of a foreign diplomat in
Moscow who served as a CIA support agent
produced a sharply positive reaction.

NOSENKO later described how metka was applied to ABIDIAN's
clothing by his maid and how, in particular, this led to

the discovery 6f the letters ABIDIAN mailed to the agent in
_Odessa and to his parents in the United States.

“ABIDIAN's maid in Moscow was Tatyana FEDOROVICH.
She was an operational contact reporting to ARTEMOV.
She started to work. for ABIDIAN a few months after
his arrival, perhaps three months but no longer than
six months after his arrival. I met: her shortly
after she began to work for ARIDIAN in order to get
acquainted with her, in order to evaluate her and
give her general instructions about her work for
ABIDIAN. I do not know the exact date of this
meeting but it was before the fall of 1960. I
wrote the operational plan on ABIDIAN in circa
: October 1960. At this time FEDOROVICH was already
working for ABIDIAN. This operational plan stated
that FEDOROVICH would continue to put metka reguiarly
on ABIDIAN's clothing.

“FEDOROVICH put metka on ABIDIAN's. clothing during
the entire period that she worked for him. -She did
“this. every two.or three weeks except for a few. times
when she was;sick-or on leave. No one else had
access to ABIDIAN's apartment. and therefore noother
“person had the possibility c of putting metka on his
‘clothing.

-~ "I have said that ABIDIAN mailed an operational
letter. to the KGB. double: agent 'ARKHANGELSKIY': (in
‘Odessa). He mailed it at the mailbox on. Tverskaya
Yamskaya where he had gone several times earlier.
“Surveillance did not see ABIDIAN mail the. letter

“ARKHANGELSKIY' ‘was found, along with a letter to

ABIDIAN had no maid! in Moscow until ‘sixteen
‘months.after his. arrival; FEDOROVICH worked for

‘Moscow.:’ ‘Thus FEDOROVICH could not have applied

1-April 1961, and ‘probably was ‘not yet employed
by ABIDIAN even-at..the timé. the letter to-
'“ARKHANGELSKIY": was mailed on 2. July 1961.

fold that FEDOROVICH could not have been applying metka
regularly to ABIDIAN's clothing at the time of the
“ARKHANGELSKIY" Letter mailing, NOSENKO insisted that no
one but FEDOROVICH had access to ABIDIAN's apartment, that
he himself briefed her on the use of metka, that the letters
were intercepted‘ by use of metka, and that FEDOROVICH was
responsible.

ABIDIAN's Servicing of the Pushkin Street Deaddrop Site

In 1964 NOSENKO reported for the first time that in 1960
or in early 1961 the KGB had surveilled ABIDIAN visiting
what was believed to be a deaddrop site on Pushkin Street
in Moscow. He provided additional details when questioned
again in 1965.

NOSENKO's Information

In 1960 or early 1961, while NOSENKO was his responsible
case officer, ABIDIAN was surveilled from the Embassy to a
residential building on Pushkin Street in Moscow. A KGB
stationary surveillance post at the Embassy saw ABIDIAN leave
with the Publications Procurement Officer of the Embassy in
a chauffeured ‘automobile, rather than in the car he normally
used. ABIDIAN's surveillance team followed the car to a
bookstore.» Both Americans. entered the bookstore, but
shortly thereafter ABIDIAN left alone and walked around the
corner, where he entered a residential building next to a
meat market on Pushkin Street. The surveillance team saw
him go in but did not follow him. ABIDIAN emerged after a
few seconds. This unusual incident was reported by the
surveillance team té the KGB Seventh (Surveillance) Direct-
orate, and the building was inspected that same day by KOZLOV,
the Chief of the First Department of the Surveillance
Directorate, and MATVEYEV, the Deputy Chief of the Second
Chief Directorate's American Department. Taking into account
the character of the building and its inhabitants, the
duration and circumstances of ABIDIAN's visit, and the
suitability of the hallway - particularly the radiator in
it -'for use as a deaddrop site, it was decided by the leader-
ship of the Second Chief Directorate and the Surveillance

Directorate that a stationary surveillance post should
immediately be set up’to cover this location. ‘ Because. of
the short time available, it was not possible to place: this
post inside the building, so it was set up across the street.
In addition, the radiator was checked daily to see if. any-
thing,. such as a magnetic container, had been concealed behind
ite’ The post was’ manned around the: clock for 30 days, after
which it was maintained from. 0800 until midnight for another
two months. .If-a package or magnetic. container had ‘been
found behind the radiator, which was: checked every morning,
it was planned to attach to it very thin wires to trigger a
’ signal should someone.remove ‘the package. ‘At the’ same time
a member of the surveillance team would be stationed’ on the
landing of the staircase in this building, out.of sight from
‘the hallway below. During the three months that the post
.was.maintained, nothing. was found concealed behind.the radiator;
nor were any suspicious persons seen entering or leaving the
building.) Thepost was then discontinued, but the address
was. placed on a list.of suspicious places inspected daily
by the Surveillance Directorate. The true significance of
this’ location became ‘known to the KGB only later, after the
arrest of PENKOVSKIY in 1962.00.00. : ‘

NOSENKO. first heard of. ABIDIAN's: visit to. the: suspected
,deaddrop' site.on:the day .it occurred... He was sitting, in
KOVSHUK's ‘office whén he réceived a telephone call from
“MATVEYEV telling him of the incident. «Although NOSENKO was
ABIDIAN's case officer and KOVSHUK was Chief of the Embassy
Section, the. decision .to.place.the stationary surveillance
post at the site was made at a higher level; neither of them
was involved in it or inthe later decision to discontinue
the post.’ NOSENKO himself visited the building on Pushkin

oi Street the following day. or the day after, but he remained

oniy a few minutes and did not. recall any details of. the
hallway, except that theré was a radiator there,

"AS ABIDIAN's case. officer, NOSENKO recalled receiving the
surveillance report of his visit to the Pushkin Street building
andplacing: this report in ABIDIAN's file; (This case file *
NOSENKO turned over to his successor, GRYAZNOV, about
28 December 1961, just befére he transferred to the Seventh
Department.) : : i a :

NOSENKO received no written reports on the results of the
stationary surveillance post, but he did discuss this matter
with KOZLOV on an almost daily basis during the first month
of surveillance, and periodically after that. These discus-
sions took place either by telephone, when KOZLOV was
visiting NOSENKO's office, or when NOSENKO visited KOZLOV's
office in KGB Headquarters. From KOZLOV or perhaps someone
else, NOSENKO learned that the post had been discontinued
after 90 days. On the basis of these conversations with
KOZLOV, NOSENKO knew that nothing of interest occurred
during the period of the stationary surveillance.

NOSENKO was in the Embassy Section during all the period
that the stationary surveillance post was watching the
Pushkin Street site and was there when he heard from KOZLOV
that the post had been replaced by periodic inspections.

NOSENKO did not report this incident of surveillance on
the Pushkin Street deaddrop site to his CIA contacts in
| Geneva in June 1962 because by that time the post had
| already been discontinued without anything unusual or
suspicious having been noted, and he thought that this
incident would be of no particular interest to CIA.

When last asked whether he had visited the Pushkin Street
address several days after ABIDIAN had been seen there, as
he had earlier said, NOSENKO replied:

“I dontt remember. I do not want to say that I
visited the deaddrop. I don't remember now whether
I'visited it or not. It seems to me that I visited
it, but I don't remember. It seems that I visited
it. with KOZLOV, but I cannot say ‘yes', and I cannot
say 'no'." A :

nor filed the initial surveillance report of
ABIDIAN's visit to the Pushkin Street site. If
he transferred to the Seventh Department two
days after ABIDIAN's visit, as he claimed (and
NOSENKO's participation in the(Tl.E. JOHNSON] case 0¢
indicates that he was working against tourists
by 5 January 1962), he could neither have visited
the site as he described nor could he have
veceived thereafter the daily surveillance
reports. He could not, of his own knowledge,
assert that the surveillance was terminated
after three months, since well before the: three
months' surveillance ended he was abroad in
Geneva. Lastly, it cannot be for the reason
NOSENKO claimed (that the surveillance was
unsuccessful) that NOSENKO did not mention
ABIDIAN's activities to CIA in Geneva in 1962.

Case Officer for John ABIDIAN: Summary and Conclusion

If for no other reason than ABIDIAN's security functions

with the Khrushchev entourage, files of the First Chief

Directorate would record his name: If NOSENKO states to

the contrary, that traces were negative, NOSENKO did not run

the traces himself nor know the results. According to

NOSENKO, ABIDIAN was “one of the most important targets of

the Second Chief Directorate"; all KGB resources were

employed for two years, including 24-hour surveillance, the

exploitation of all agents with access to him, audio sur-

veillance, and technical aids, with amost absolutely negative

results. The results could not have been negative: for

NOSENKO to so assert can only mean that NOSENKO was not

informed of the results. In the two instances NOSENKO cited

of Embassy agents' activities against ABIDIAN, he made

fundamental errors: ABIDIAN's maid was not employed by

ABIDIAN-~at the time NOSENKO insists she was applying the

metka, and GROMAKOVA taught APIDIAN Russian throughout his

stay in Moscow, not just "several times". NOSENKO acknowledges

and for the first time claimed case officer responsibilities
against American targets other than ABIDIAN. He related how,
at his meeting with KLYPIN and KOVSHUK on entering the section
in January 1960, KOVSHUK suggested that NOSENKO assume super-
visory responsibility for the service attaches while KOVSHUK
supervised operations against the civilian diplomatic staff
of the Embassy. NOSENKO stated “supervising" meant that the
case officers for the service attaches referred their ques-
tions to him, not to KOVSHUK. These included case officers
GAVRILENKO, responsible for Air Attaches, KURILENKO, for

Army Attaches, and DEMKIN, for enlisted personnel of all
services. "While he was getting acquainted with the section
on DRANOV's retirement", NOSENKO himself took case officer
responsibility for the Naval Attache personnel. This res-—
ponsibility was subsequently assumed by DRANOV's former
assistant, BELOGLAZOV. NOSENKO could not initially recall
how long he supervised service attache operations; he later
said “several months" and finally "five or six months".
Nejther could NOSENKO recall what other pressing duty or
duties caused him to be relieved of this function. He said
this resulted from KOVSHUK's proposal that supervision of

the service attaches be assumed by ALESHIN who was Deputy
Chief of the Second Directorate's American Department and
coordinator for Second Directorate operations against
military intelligence officers of all nationalities.

Supervisor of Service Attache Operations:
Summary and Conclusion

Because of the tardiness of NOSENKO's claim to have been
responsible for operations against service attaches and
because he was not able, when challenged, to substantiate
his claims by providitig any details of KGB activities against
these targets, it is concluded that this. aspect of his
claimed KGB service’ is a fiction.

Custodian of KGB File on Embassy Security
noes 7 : :

As former Deputy Chief..and éccasional Acting Chief of the
American Embassy Section, NOSENKO' claimed awareness of KGB
knowledge of its American Embassy target. Specifically, .
‘NOSENKO claimed to have been custodian of the Second’ Chief
Directorate's file on Embassy: security. , :

NOSENKO's Information

NOSENKO's knowledge of the’ physical layout of the Embassy
-derived both from his general supervisory functions during
1960-1961 ‘and from his. responsibilities as the officially”
registered custodian of the KGB file on the Embassy security.
He received the file from:the Section Chief, KOVSHUK, when
he arrived in January 1960.. As. was permissible under KGB
procedures, as long as the custodian was: still in the same
directorate, the’ file was charged to BAKHVALOV. [See p./153-
for NOSENKO's various assertions with respect to BAKHVALOV.}
".NOSENKO -had custody of the file charged to. himself, and -from
.. January 1960 until NOSENKO-was leaving the section on 25-28.
December 1961,. only KOVSHUK, NOSENKO, and GRYAZNOV anda’
~ KOSOLAPOV'(both of whom shared NOSENKO's office and: safe) had
“access: to the file. : : aed

The file’ consisted. of: two volumes, one for thé ‘old
building on Mokhovaya Street ‘and the second (about-an inch:
hick) on the new Embassy building occupied in 1953 on
-Chaykovskiy Street. The file contained detailed floor plans
and photographs ‘of both: buildings. i 7 s 5
‘No operational’ analysis or, planning by NOSENKO or others
was done on. the" basis.-of this*file during NOSENKO"s two ‘years
in the Embassy Section: It was used only for reference 7
purposes, since the KGB had concluded that it was impossible
for a ‘Soviet citizen to penetrate the secure areas of the
Embassy because of the American security precautions in
effect, ' * .

All Soviet employees of the Embassy who entered the
restricted areas, "the seventh through the tenth floors",
were carefully questioned because of the special KGB interest
in these offices, [The secure area barred to unescorted
local employees is comprised of the eighth through tenth
floors.] i

NOSENKO personally placed some reports by KGB agents in
the Embassy security file, while he was custodian. None of
the information was of interest or important or useful
enough for him to remember, and he recalled none of the KGB
agent sources. [In another context NOSENKO cited an instance
in which an unrecalled KGB agent had reported [erroneously]
that ABIDIAN's office had a sign on the door reading “Security
Office".]

Nothing could be recovered from the Embassy classified
trash, which was always burned at an unrecalled location by
a non-commissioned officer or Marine guard accompanied by
an officer. [At the Moscow Embassy the Marine guard detailed
for the purpose has always burned the classified trash alone.
NOSENKO may be unwittingly referring to a U.S. military
security procedure requiring a commissioned officer to witness
and to certify ,the destruction of classified documents. If
NOSENKO is aware of any such procedure, he has never indicated
it in any context.] :

In 1960-1961, when NOSENKO was Deputy Chief, he either
knew the location of all offices and personnel within. the
Embassy or he could obtain them from the monthly Embassy
telephone lists which the KGB received regularly from agents.
The lists gave office numbers. [The Embassy telephone lists
contain names, apartment numbers and telephone numbers, but
omits office room numbers.] :

In 1960 a "metallic chamber" (acoustical room) arrived
at the Embassy for President Eisenhower's use and for secret
conversations. None of the technical specifications of the
room were known, nor was its location. An unrecalled source
reported only that meetings were held in the room, which was
in the restricted area.

Handling. of Monitor Reports

According to NOSENKO, only a limited number of KGB

personnel, all in the American Department of the Second
pal Chief Directorate, had access to the monitor reports. These

| included Department Chief KLYPIN (but not his deputies),
KOVSHUK, NOSENKO himself, and GRIBANOV, to whom important
items were shown. The existence of the audio operation and
its product were concealed from personnel in other KGB
Departments. The reports were produced by the Second Special
Department of the Operational Technical Directorate (OTU).
The OTU Second Special Department has several sections, one |
of which was the English Section under Colonel N. Ya. KUZMIN.
KUZMIN's monitors, fluent in English, listened to and
transcribed the tape recordings. Their reports of the. |
preceding: day's product were brought daily by Tatyana
GRISHNYAT (of the Second Special Department) to the American
. Department. (In some accounts NOSENKO has said that he |

| received the reports first, at other times that they went
first to KLYPIN.) NOSENKO reviewed the reports, marked
significant portions and usually within twenty-four hours
returned the reports to the Second Special Department. |
In. NOSENKO's absence either KOVSHUK.or GRYAZNOV reviewed the
reports. The Second Special .Departmerit. prepared sterile
abstracts of the portions NOSENKO had marked, abstracts |
which disguised the source of the information contained:
the abstracts were returned to the American Department for
the reference of individual case officers in the Embassy |
Section and for filing in the delo-formulyar (developmental
file) kept on each American employee in the Embassy.

Location of the:Microphones * :

In the 1962 Geneva meetings with CIA, NOSENKO emphasized
that the KGB was listening to all conversations of the

service attaches and particularly, to conversations held in
the office of the Minister Counsellor. In addition, he
referred to "points" [microphones] in the office of an
unnamed State Department employee, in the Agricultural
Attache office shared by BROWN and HORBALY, and in the
Embassy code room.

In 1964, at the second meeting with CIA, NOSENKO produced
a handwritten note which he asserted listed all the micro-
phones in the Embassy which were operative. in the years
1960-1961. NOSENKO. explained that at the.end of 1960 or
the beginning of 1961, he and KOVSHUK met with Department
Chief. KLYPIN. The purpose ofthe meeting.was to discuss
the possibility: of releasing monitors from some of the
Embassy microphones so: they could be ‘assigned to Vladimir
PETROV, Chief of the American Department's Second Section
for use against non-Embassy targets. (PETROV had earlier
requested English~language monitors from the Second Special
Section, but-had been told that English linguists were *
engaged on priority targets.) . At the meeting, KOVSHUK’ and
KLYPIN reviewed the microphone coverage of the Embassy

-chancery to decide which rooms offered information of little

value, so that. the monitors for. those microphones. could be
released to PETROV'S Second Section. KOVSHUK used NOSENKO's
notebook in .which to list Embassy apartments’ and offices
then. being covered ‘on a full-time basis and to note those of
lesser..importance. KOVSHUK decided to relinquish, tempor-
arily, monitoring of Embassy apartments. He continued the
monitoring-of the ‘code room, despite the limited value of
the information obtained, ‘At. the end of the meeting KOVSHUK

NOSENKO said that "many" microphones were installed in
the chancery building before the Americans occupied it, but
he did not know how many were installed in all, how many
were in any particular room on KOVSHUK's list, or where they
were located in specific rooms. He did recall that most of
the microphones were emplaced in the outside wall, the wall
nearest Chaykovskiy Street, as most of the offices faced
this street and microphones emplaced there were less vulner-
able to technical search and discovery.

According to NOSENKO, there were no fixed microphones in
America House, the Embassy quarters of enlisted military
personnel. In 1960-1961 there had been a discussion of using
KGB agents employed there to emplace temporary audio devices
for one or two days at a time in the rooms of the Americans,
as well as in the Embassy garage- These plans were vetoed;
however, because of the risk of discovery. For the same
reason there was no attempt made in this period to emplace
ser | a device temporarily in Spasso House, the Ambassador's

Ba etce residence, or in the apartments of Embassy officers. The
nM KGB was afraid that they would be detected and there would
be a scandal.

Performance Characteristics of the Microphones

According to NOSENKO in 1962, the audibility of the
microphones in’ 1960-1961 ranged from very clear to zero,
put the microphone system was deteriorating. The KGB could
ao nothing about it because they could not gain access to
the inside of ‘the Embassy. Referring to the. microphone in
the Minister Counsellor's office, NOSENKO said that it was
becoming increasingly difficult tovwork with its product.
The microphone was fading, and the recording tape sounded
as if “somewhere far away, Somewhere in the cellar, someone
is speaking ina whisper". _ KUZMIN, the KGB officer respon-
sible for the monitors, said that soon the KGB could recover
nothing. Of the microphones then (in 1962) in place, about
twenty no longer were operative.

In 1964 NOSENKO referred again to the microphone in the
Minister Counsellor's office. NOSENKO learned from
DMITRIYEV [Deputy Chief of the English-language Section of
OTU.Second Special Department] how difficult it was to

monitor conversations in. that office. ‘Only very experienced
linguists were used, but even they had to listen “ten, -
fifteen, even twenty times" in order to. understand portions
of the recording. After NOSINKO left the Embassy Section,

they would be completely inoperative.” As a result, -GRYAZNOV

Amount, Type, and Value of Audio Surveillance Production

In 1962 while citing examples of the kind of information
the KGB obtained from monitoring, NOSENKO referred only to
the offices of the Minister Counsellor and of the service
attaches. According to NOSENKO, Counsellor FREERS dictated
Top Secret and Secret cables. If the content justified,
GRIBANOV was informed and he notified the KGB Chairman
immediately. FREERS also dictated fitness reports on Embassy
personnel from which the KGB learned of various American
officers' personal weaknesses. With respect to the service
attaches, NOSENKO said that the KGB learned from microphones
where they intended to travel, and what they wanted to find
out.

In 1964 NOSENKO provided some additional details. He
said that audio reception was good from the military code
room, but that the occupants rarely spoke, When one of them
was monitored, the monitor report was sent immediately to
the Eighth Directorate which was concerned with ciphers.
Nothing was obtained from the State Department code room and
teletype room because of the interference from the noise of
the teletype machines. The microphones in the apartments
produced rarely anything of interest. An exception was
advance information obtained of a social affair, for which
the English-language Section of the OTU Second Special
Department would be asked to pay particular attention. There
was a microphone with good reception in GLEYSTEEN's (a
political officer) office, but no secret information was
obtained, Similarly, the conversations were overheard in
the Agricultural Attache office, but nothing significant
was obtained except "something" which made the KGB suspect
HORBALY was connected with American Intelligence.

In a protocol signed on 26 October 1965 NOSENKO summarized
his knowledge of the value of the information obtained by
the KGB via microphones in the Embassy:

Parallel to thé audio cable running ‘from the.chancery to the

knowledge as to the effectiveness of United States operations
within the Soviet Union, particularly the military attache
collection program. Soviet knowledge of U-S. emphasis upon
certain intelligence collection areas has made it possible
for them to identify priority intelligence and probably
Soviet targets and thereby permitted them to implement
specific counteractions. The Soviets over the years must
have amassed considerable information concerning the personal
habits, problems, attitudes and weaknesses of personnel
assigned to the Embassy which can be used by them for purposes
of exploitation at any time of their choosing in the future."

Col. Theodore F. HOFFMAN, Army Attache in Moscow from
May 1959 to May 1961 (a period coinciding with some eighteen
months of NOSENKO's claimed two years' service in the Embassy
Section), has been more specific. Interviewed by CIA, Col.
HOFFMAN recalled instances which the KGB, by monitoring just
the conversations held in his.office, could have become aware
of the vulnerability of service attache personnel. As
examples, he cited the two occasions on which military code
pe clerk (SroRsBERG| was reprimanded for absenteeism (unavailable
for cipher duties because he was elsewhere with "girl
; friends"); HOFFMAN's conversations with America House manager
 Beter BINDER (the personality probiéms, drinking ‘habits and
other incidents relating to America House residents and
visitors to the America Club), and the detailed circumstances
prompting the decision to remove substitute code clerk|KEYSERS) )6
from Moscow (homosexuality)... [Besides his general duties as
Chief of the Embassy Section, NOSENKO claims special: responsi-
bilities for each of the persons mentioned. He supervised
the KGB.officers operating against code clerks and residents
of America House, and asserts he was personally involved in
the KGB attempts to recruit JSTORSBERG| and (KEYSERS\o/(The KGB
attempted later to recruit BINDER’as well.) } In summing up
his views, Col. HOFFMAN said: "To be perfectly frank, I
would assume that ... some of our modus operandi, some of

States relations (and hence of priority interest to the KGB),
as the U-2 and President Eisenhower's visit. Of the micro-
phones which produced useful information, NOSENKO describes
those in the Minister Counsellor's office, the office of

the Army Attache, and in the code room; when challenged to
cite examples of information obtained, heasserts that none
produced any information of interest to the Embassy Section-
Lastly, although he stresses the value of the chancery
microphones as sources of information on which he rdied to
direct operations against code clerks and other Embassy
personnel, he again can describe no actual instance. In

the single case in which he asserted that he relied on
information procured from microphones. (KEYSERS! failure to0b
report receipt of the defection invitation), he was in error.

Conclusion

From the foregoing it is concluded that, NOSENKO's claims
to the contrary, his information on the chancery microphones
does not sustain his claim either to have been Deputy Chief
of the Embassy Section, or his claim that he personally
reviewed the KGB microphone monitoring reports.

Cryptologic Attack on Embassy Communications

As former Deputy Chief of the Embassy Section of the
American Department NOSENKO claimed to be knowledgeable of
the extent of KGB success in its cryptologic-attack on
Embassy communications. He has consistently asserted that
the KGB had never succeeded in reading enciphered communica~
tions of the service attaches [for which reason he claimed

in the information as it did not relate to agents or agent
activities. NOSENKO noted, however, that the material
concerned messages from the Secretary of State to the American
Ambassador, Moscow. All of this material was highly sensi-
tive, and few people were permitted to see it or even to

know of its existence. NOSENKO stated that it was treated
more carefully than Top Secret information.

Unable to describe the techniques of the KGB Eighth
Directorate in breaking U.S. Department of State crypto-
graphic systems, NOSENKO nevertheless did indicate methods
as known to him. One method, mentioned by NOSENKO on
12 June 1962, stemmed from the habit of certain Embassy
officials (notably Ministers Counsellor FREERS and McSWEENEY)
dictating the text of outgoing cables aloud. When the texts
were picked up on the KGB microphones, the Eighth Directorate
compared them against enciphered traffic intercepted by
other means.

NOSENKO has referred to the Eighth Directorate's interest
in equipment sounds and snatches of technical conversations
picked up by the microphones in the State Department and
military code rooms.

"Now, we also listened to the code room and the
teletype office, but we could never get anything out
of the teletype office because of interference

on occasion, and then he would méntion a group of
numbers. This was, of course, all recorded and we
turned it over at once to the Eighth Directorate,
dealing with coding and decoding. Of course, all
other intercepts were turned over to them also."

With respect to the use of code clerks by the American
Department , NOSENKO recalled that in 1948 or 1949 the KGB
was helped a great deal by [James H.] McMILLAN la military
code clerk of the Embassy staff who defected in 1948], and
by “ANDREY" [Dayle SMITH, see p. 33]. It was thanks to

code-clerk brought to the USSR from-India" -[unidentified,

Cryptologic Attack on Embassy Communications:
Summary and Conclusion

From USIB and’ NSA damage assessments following the
discovery of the microphones in the chancery, it has been
concluded that it was equally feasible for the Soviets to
have recovered plain text (by analysis of cipher machine
emissions) from enciphered service attache traffic of the
period 1952-1962, and from enciphered State Department
traffic during 1952-1959. “ANDREY" (see Pp- 33), the code
machine mechanic the KGB allegedly recruited in 1953,
serviced the cipher machines in a common State-service
attache code room; his access was not limited, as NOSENKO
indicates, to State Department traffic. On the basis of
these fundamental errors, it is concluded that NOSENKO
was not knowledgeable of the extent of KGB cryptologié
attack on Embassy communications, and that such information
as he provided can not be related to his claim to have
been Deputy Chief of the Embassy Section,

Knowledge of CIA Personnel within Embassy

As Deputy Chief and occasional Acting Chief of the
American Embassy Section,’ NOSENKO claimed that he would
“necessarily know whom the KGB knew or suspected to be a
CIA officer" under diplomatic cover within the Embassy.
Within the section, “special emphasis" was placed on the

‘identification and development ‘of American Intelligence.

personnel, with the objective of an eventual recruitment.
The KGB believed that the Ambassador, code clerks, ‘and
Marine guards would not be used to perform intelligence
missions: any diplomat, however, was noted as “suspect

Paul GARBLER

GARBLER was a naval officer in the office of the Naval
Attache and the target of BELOGLAZOV. NOSENKO knew the
names of no agents working against GARBLER. The KGB obtained
no interesting information concerning GARBLER from microphones,
telephone taps, or surveillance. NOSENKO "did not know"
whether or not he had read GARBLER's file. (It will be

Knowledge of CIA Personnel in Embassy:
ummary and Conclusion

With the exception of ABIDIAN, there is a paradox
connected with each of NOSENKO's identifications, as is
most evident in the cases of (MOREL } and GARBLER. It is a 06
fact that both these individdals wére known to the KGB as
CIA officers, a fact of which NOSENKO apparently is unaware.
His claim is thus false, that he would necessarily know
whom the KGB believed was a CIA officer, and to the extent
he related it to his claim that he was Deputy Chief of the
Embassy Section, that latter claim is unsubstantiated.

Personal Handler of KGB Agents

NOSENKO has named seven agents which he claimed to have
handled while Deputy Chief of the American Section during
1960-1961. 7

YEFREMOV and VOLKOV

NOSENKO continued to manage these two. homosexual agents
whom he had recruited and managed during his assignment in
the Seventh Department, and brought with him when he trans-
ferred to the American Department (see p.1l1l). They were
used in no operations during the period 1960-1961. [NOSENKO
described the compromise of Robert BARRETT) in 1959 and knew (6
of his later recruitment in T961, (See p. 134.) NOSENKO
does not know of (BARRETT|'s contacts with YEFREMOV and vorKov 0b

Personal Handler of KGB Agents: Summary and Conclusion

Of the five agents NOSENKO claims to have brought with
him to the American Embassy Section from his previous Seventh
Department assignment, none was used operationally during
1960-1961. If NOSENKO handled LEVINA as he claimed, he
would presumably know that his single agent in the Embassy
served throughout his Embassy.Section assignment and was
not fired earlier, as he asserted .(b/PREISFREUND] and{ WEISS] ()(

the KGB operations agains#’(STORSBERG] and (ZUJUS).4 NOSENKO's
claims regarding the agents he handled during the 1960-1961
period do not sustain his assertions that he was Deputy
Chief of the American Section, responsible for code clerk
operations, or provide conclusive evidence that he did or
did not serve in the Embassy Section.

Travel to Cuba (November-December 1960)

When NOSENKO first mentioned his travel to Cuba (in
1962, in Geneva), he claimed that he travelled under the
NIKOLAYEV alias, and he provided colorful details of his
activities in Havana in surveying the American Embassy
there for operational possibilities. In subsequent versions
NOSENKO asserted that he travelled in true name, and that
his was a routine assignment to accompany a Soviet delegation
as a security officer.

NOSENKO's Information

In the latter part of 1960, at the same time as he was
preparing for his intended trip to the United States, a
special delegation of nickel industry experts from Gosptan,
the Soviet State Planning Commission, was preparing for
departure for Cuba. The delegation was a routine one,
consisting mostly of engineers from various sections of
the Soviet Uninn. Since there was no one under any sort of
suspicion, the Eleventh (Soviet Travellers Abroad) Depart-
ment of the Second Chiéf Directorate decided it was unnec-
essary to include a security officer. two days prior to
the departure of the group, ‘however, the Central Committee j
of the Communist Party ordered that a Second Chief Direct-
orate officer accompany the group. Because of the short
time remaining before the delegation's scheduled departure,
the Eleventh Department protested that it would be impossible |
to find a suitable officer who could get his necessary
travel documents ready in time. At this point, A.I. KUZNETSOV
of the Eleventh Department suggested NOSENKO, who had been
supposed to go to the United: States and who had ‘a valid
passport (in true name). The Cubans issued NOSENKO a visa
immediately as did The Netherlands a transit visa. |

NOSENKO's functions with the delegation were purely of
a security nature. He flew with the delegation to Cuba in
October or November and spent about a month and a half |
there. During this time he accompanied the delegation

Comment: NOSENKO doesn't know why he was selected to
consult with the MVR in Bulgaria. As far
as is known to CIA, such consultation was a
function of the KGB advisors in Sofia whom
NOSENKO himself described. The American
Legation (after a ten-year absence) reopened
ide in February 1960. By 1961 the MVR had demon-
strated that it had lost none of its earlier
demonstrated efficiency in controlling the
activities of resident foreigners and in
establishing the basis for mounting operations
against American diplomats. There was no
apparent necessity for NOSENKO's Sofia assign-
ment, and therefore his account is judged to
be untrue.

ation of (LUND In his subsequent accounts he had stated
that while he never saw LUNT\ personally, he supervised the

About two weeks after arriving in Bulgaria, around the
end of April 1961, NOSENKO was reviewing MVR lists of
foreigners scheduled to visit Bulgaria, when he came across
the name of\Horace G. LUNT).\, NOSENKO recalled that a Slavic
linguist of at: name had7~been reported to him in Moscow by
VOLKOV or YEFREMOV-as a possible homosexual. When MVR /
officers confirmed that this[LuNT] was a Slavic specialist, Uo
i NOSENKO decided to check his’ Fecdllection against KGB
records, for which purpose he telephoned Moscow. _ An almost
d immediate reply confirmed that this was the same {LUNT]who 0

sexual activities and the MVR had not known that, LUNT [was OG

Comment:

NOSENKO dates his transfer as occurring “before
GOLITSYN's defection", which he insists
occurred in mid-January 1962 even after. learning
from CIA that the correct date is 15 December
1961. Obliged to take the latter date into
account, NOSENKO reconstructed the foregoing
chronology of his departure from the Embassy
Section and his assumption of duties in the
Embassy Section and his assumption of duties
in the Seventh Department. Repeated interro-~
gation has never resolved the reason NOSENKO
attached so much significance to the date on
which he believes GOLITSYN defected.

In claiming to have transferred from the
Embassy Section just prior to 5 January 1962
(when his participation in the Seventh Depart-
ment compromise of [W.E. JOHNSON jis confirmed) yb
NOSENKO's account makes it impossible for him
to have played the role he claimed in the events
connected with ABIDIAN's visit to the Pushkin
Street deaddrop. (See P+ 216-)

NOSENKO's assertion that he was GRIBANOV's
candidate over KOVSHUK for Deputy Chief of the
American Department is implausible. . In contrast
to NOSENKO's self-admitted undistinguished
performance, KOVSHUK was a former Deputy Chief

of the American Department who had been personally

invotved: in such American Department operations
of the previous decade as recruitments of Roy
RHODES and Dayle SMITH, and the development of

CIA officers WINTERS and [MORELL and the interro- ()f

gation of CIA officer ELLE, and the more

CHAPTER VIII

SEVENTH DEPARTMENT {January 1962 to January 1964,

Comment: By late 1959 or early 1960 the KGB had the
complete substance of the CIA and MI-6 tourist
| agent program in the USSR. The information eb-
seuerueree” tained from the KGB agent in MI-6, BLAKE, in-
cluded accurate details of the objectives and
4 targets of those operations, as well as the
| practices employed for the selection, recruit-
ment, training and briefing of the agents in-
volved. As a probable consequence of reports
received from BLAKE as well as by the indepen-
dent confirmation of tourist agents identified
in the USSR, the KGB by 1961 was mobilizing all
] of its resources to counter the threat. The

KGB's tasks were made no easier by the increase
in bona fide tourists to the Soviet Union, the
numbers of which were increasing by thousands
annually. Evidently uncertain of the success
of domestic measures it was taking, the KGB
See . extended responsibility for countermeasures to
| KGB elements outside of the Second Chief Direc-
torate. To that end, selected First Chief
Directorate residencies abroad were instructed
| to exploit all of its facilities in developing
tourist agent countermeasures. In describing
the magnitude of its tourist agent problem,
KGB Headquarters cited the scores of American
tourist agents who had been identified in just
one year in the Soviet Union.

In fact, by the time NOSENKO returned to
the Seventh Department in January 1962, the
threat against which the KGB was deploying had
passed. By early 1961 the tourist agent pro-
gram was suspended when technical collection
programs and other agent operations made the
use of tourists unnecessary.

tourists during this period must be examined

in light ‘of the foregoing facts. Since NOSENKO
claims to have held key KGB positions from
which vantage he asserts he was particularly
well informed about KGB operations against
American tourists, it is appropriate to hold
him closely accountable for his statements..

NOSENKO's claimed assignment to the Seventh Department,
first as Chief of the American-British Commonwealth Section
and then as a Deputy and then First Deputy Chief of the
entire Department, extended from January 1962 until his de-
fection in Geneva in January 1964. By the time NOSENKO re-
turned to the Seventh Department for this assignment, the
KGB reorganization of 1959 had been completed, and according
to NOSENKO, the Department was divested of all of its former
functions unrelated to tourists. A newly-created Service
‘sluzhba), NOSENKO explained, assumed responsibility for
foreign religious figures, emigres visiting the Soviet Union,
and persons: travelling to the USSR to visit relatives. The
Seventh Department's former responsibilities for operations
against foreign seamen, commercial delegations, and so forth
were similarly transferred elsewhere.

In addition to performing supervisory and administrative
duties, NOSENKO asserted that in this period he personally
was involved with KGB operations launched against six Ameri-
can tourists and participated in investigations of Lee Harvey
OSWALD and of a disaffectéd KGB colleague from the American
Embassy Section, A.N. CHEREPANOV. In this period, also, he
travelled on two occasions to Geneva on missions unrelated to
his Seventh Department. duties.

Because of the senior position NOSENKO said he occupied
during his period of service in the Seventh Department, NOSENKO
claimed full awareness of all significant KGB operations
against American tourists.

all KGB activities against American ‘and British. and. .Canadian
tourists in the‘USSR ‘aswell, as for supervising the operation-
al work of fifteen subordinate case officers. . He had no.
deputy; -and-he. did not. indicate who assumed his duties in his

Comment: From their modus operandi the "doctor from

YEFREMOV. NOSENKO frequently used the opera-~
tional pseudonym Yuriy Ivanovich NIKOLAYEV
and was called Georgiy. ia
* Although [JoHNSOM appiently confirmed
NOSENKO's rote, NOSENKO's version of the case
is incompatible with what must have been the
actual time frame. According to NOSENKO's
version, within five days of ‘OHNSON}' s arriva1 (6
in Moscow the KGB had discoveréd that he was
a homosexual, concluded from "two or three"
censored letters that he was a threat, and ar-
ranged his entrapment. The rapid pace of
events suggests that JOHNSON}! s homosexuality O06
was already known to the KGB (if not to NOSENKOi

before [JouNsoN}'s arrival in Moscow. NOSENKO's

ob ignoranGe of OHNSON|'s preaching i(probably the
actual cause of KGB concern) is further evi-
dence that NOSENKO did not know the complete
background of the KGB operation, and that his
role was merely that of Playing the ‘"Police

tradicts his assertions about the timing of

“ NOSENKO arrivedin Geneva on 10 March 1962 ‘listed offi-
‘cially-as an "expert" of the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Af-
“fairs attached to the Soviet delegation to the Disarmament

y Conference. NOSENKO explained that after GOLITSYN's defec-
., tion in Finland [in December 1961] an order was issued that-
*."no delegation was to be permitted to depart. the Soviet ‘Union
without an accompanying KGB security officer... [NOSENKO has
since stated that, he can recall no such: order.]

Explaining in-1962 how he came. to be designated, as the
sectrity. escort, NOSENKO said he argued that he was. needed

to direct the fifteen case officers in. his section, but
GRIBANOV. stated that Foreign Minister Gromyko was leading

the: delegation ‘and that someone of an appropriate senior rank
should accompany. the delegation, not just a senior case offi-
cer, but a section chief or a deputy chief ora chief of a
department. NOSENKO was the most junior section chief. His

rip.on the basis that ‘it would last only a month.

(SEVENTH DEPARTMENT - January 1962-January 1964)

In addition to his general security duties with the
delegation, NOSENKO said in 1962 that he was given a
special assignment to check on a senior delegation advisor,
Pavel Fedorovich SHAKHOV (see below).

During the 1965 interrogations, NOSENKO provided somewhat
varying accounts of the background of his 1962 trip to Geneve.
He said that GRIBANOV had nothing to do with his assignment,
but that [S.G.] BANNIKOV, the Deputy Chief of the Second
Directorate who supervised the Soviet Delegations Abroad
Department, made the selection. The. latter department was
investigating SHAKHOV, and BANNIKOV was concerned with the
selection of a security officer because SHAKHOV, who was
suspected of being a Western agent, was to be in the delega-
tion. Because of the seriousness attached to the case, the
Delegations Department wanted a chief of section as case
officer, and when a request was made to the Seventh Depart—
ment Chief, CHELNOKOV, the latter agreed to NOSENKO's as-
signment. NOSENKO stated that CHELNOKOV, his superior and
friend, let him go to Geneva as “a treat", even though he
had just assumed his duties as Chief ‘of the American—
British Commonwealth Section, he had no deputy, .ard.the trip
was occurring on the eve of the tourist season.

Investigation of SHAKHOV

According to NOSENKO, M.G. SITNIKOV, representing the
Soviet Delegations Department, conducted investigations of
SHAKHOV in Geneva in 1961, but had been unable to resolve the
KGB suspicions about him. Because of the failure of these
early efforts, the KGB decided to send a "senior guy" to the
Disarmament talks in 1962, and NOSENKO was chosen "to finish
things up". Before leaving Moscow in March 1962, NOSENKO
discussed the SHAKHOV case with SITNIKOV and with. LYALIN, the
Soviet Delegations Department. case officer in charge of the
SHAKHOV case. He also read various materials on the case,
including an investigative plan drawn up by LYALIN.

NOSENKO has said that SHAKHOV was under suspicion in 1962
because he was working with different delegations at different
conferences, and there was some evidence that in Geneva ear-
lier he was somehow connected with American diplomat (David MARH,

. who was [erroneously] considered to b CIA officer.
SHAKHOV "maybe" had some contact with Jin. 12960 or 1961, 06
but NOSENKO did not know ‘the .substance7of it... A counter~

, intelligence officer of ‘the First Chief Directorate, S.M.

_ GOLUBEV,, had once been on’a delegation with SHAKHOV and: he

“had. noted. "little details"... while SHAKHOV was in. the United

“:. States, earlier, he had been terminated..[as an agent] ‘by
- KGB officers. who had submitted a report stating’ that’ SHAKHOV.

“liked life -in’the Unites States, American products, and

. money... In that. KGB. report. he Was depicted as "not good"

. and “not wanting: to work as. an agent".

NOSENKO stated ‘that SHAKHOV' had served with the Ministry
of. Foreign Affairs in the. United States and that during that
service he acted as an agent-récruiter: for the KGB... SHAKHOV
was permitted to. travel abroad eventhough suspected of being
an American agent, because he. belonged to the Ministry of
Foreign Affairs, and "the KGB: could do nothing about his

“trips abroad". "There: was no proof, only suspicions, and
furthermore, SHAKHOV was a member of the personal staff of
_ the head -of the Soviet delegation, S.K. Tsarapkin." - According

ito NOSENKO, SHAKEOV was.not.and never.had been a KGB officer.

"Comment: SHAKHOV has-served in and visited the United

Soviet. Consulate General in New York.. He at-
ténded the 1945. Conference: on International

Virtually every day, NOSENKO told CIA in 1962, he went to
the KGB Legal Residency in Geneva, and if he stayed away for
more than a day or two, Legal Rezident S.I. GAVRICHEV would
invariably ask NOSENKO where he had been keeping himself.
GAVRICHEV, according to NOSENKO, treated him with deference,
and shortly after his arrival in Geneva in March 1962,
NOSENKO gave a lecture on counterintelligence to the assembled
members of the Legal Residency. This lecture was given at
GAVRICHEV's request, although it was only after some hesita-
tion on the part of the Legal Rezident that all of his subor-
dinates were brought together to hear NOSENKO. In return
for helping the Legal Residency to perform countersurveillance
on several occasions, NOSENKO said, he was sometimes allowed
by GAVRICHEV to have the use of an operational car and driver
to go shopping and carry out other private errands. [NOSENKO
was not under CIA surveillance at any time in 1962 in Geneva
and his claims as to his activities there, aside from his
meetings with CIA, can be neither confirmed nor refuted.]

NOSENKO claimed that he would know of any others, and he
was the sole KGB officer within the Soviet Disarmament Dele-
gation in 1962. Among delegates he identified only Oleg
GRINEVSKIY as having any connection with the KGB. GRINEVSKIY
was one of NOSENKO's own agents within the delegation: in
Moscow he was handled by KGB officers of the Intelligentsia
and Correspondents Department of the Second Chief Directorate.
Among other delegates NOSENKO described A.K. KISLOV and V.G.
FILATOV. According to NOSENKO, KISLOV was head of the Ameri-
can Section of TASS and was "a genuine correspondent"; "de-
finitely not an intelligence officer".

Comment: CIA had tentatively identified all three of
the delegates as KGB officers. ‘KISLOV was ob-
served in apparent KGB operational activity in
both Washington and Moscow. FILATOV served as
an alternate contact with the KGB agent in NATO,

a double agent. NOSENKO was in Geneva
at the time.

Association with Other Soviets

According to NOSENKO, the Soviets he saw most often in
Geneva in 1962 were A.K. KISLOV (see above), Yu.I. GUK, and
M.S. TSYMBAL. (Both KISLOV and GUK were involved in the

“ANDREY" case: see p. 33 .)

A.K. KISLOV

TASS correspondent KISLOV was one of the three other -dele-
gates besides NOSENKO staying at the Hotel Ariane in Geneva.
NOSENKO said he arranged for KISLOV's name to. be given as a
notional source of information on Soviet disarmament policy
to KGB ‘double agent BELITSKIY (see below). NOSENKO drank
and caroused with KISLOV while in Geneva, and KISLOV was
NOSENKO's companion in early June, when NOSENKO either
squandered or was robbed of KGB operatdonal funds. [the loss
he asked CIA to make good], and on the night of 10 June, when
he squandered the 2000 Swiss francs CIA provided on wine and
women, With reference to the threat posed his security by
KISLOV's knowledge of his profligacy, NOSENKO said that KISLOV
was “too drunk to know what was going on", and in any event
constituted no threat.

In 1964 NOSENKO reported for the first time that KISLOV
had been a KGB operational contact while stationed in the :
United States and that NOSENKO had been introduced to-KISLOV
by a KGB officer in Moscow prior to departing for Geneva in
1962, so that he. could use KISLOV at the conference. On the

‘basis of NOSENKO's favorable report afterwards, he said,

KISLOV had been recruited as a KGB agent on his return.

In 1966 NOSENKO named the Soviets living with him at the
Ariane Hotel in 1962, but did not name KISLOV.

Yu.I. GUK

Implying that their’ friendship was of .long standing;
NOSENKO related in 1962 that he and GUK were together near'y
every day in Geneva, where they went out’ to chat’ and have e
“few drinks. As:‘a consequence, NOSENKO, was.-granted access to
the residency. and was ablé to elicit information abovt some
of GUK's operations in Geneva. He described his “big. big
friend" GUK as the Deputy Legal Rezident in Geneva and the
only. “strong officer" in-the residency.

Comment: . In 1964 NOSENKO ‘attributed his gaining access
to the residency in paced to TSYMBAL not to

M.S. TSYMBAL 9.

In 1962 NOSENKO reported TSYMBAL's presence in Geneva and
identified him as-Chief of the Illegals Directorate:of. the
KGB First. Chief Directorate. He alluded to having spoken with
him,, but placed no particular: emphasis on their relationship. ©

In 1964 NOSENKO’ claimed that he had been dealing with
TSYMBAL since 1960 ‘or 1961,.when he was looking for some
candidates for recruitment and.came across some whose’ back-

- ground would have made them suitable for the Special] [Illegalsi
Directorate. -NOSENKO met TSYMBAL in Moscow:in the KGB. Head-
quarters’ and TSYMBAL had ‘asked him several times to transfer
to the First Chief-Directorate and suggested that he might be
assigned to the United States... In Geneva, he and TSYMBAL: had
dinner together’-several. times’ a week, sometimes accompanied
by -KISLOV and .sometimés alone.” It was TSYMBAL's influence,
NOSENKO said, which secured NOSENKO access: to the residency
in 1962 and established the precedent from which -he was
granted access in 1964. c :

Association with [British| Female Secretary

NOSENKO has described his association with a[British]
secretary whom he met at a diplomatic reception in Geneva as

-one of an amorous pursuit: he disclaimed any operational

interest in the girl. After several dates, NOSENKO could no
longer reach her at her apartment, and he concluded that she

” had told her superiors that he was a Russian and had pro-

bably believea@ him to be an intelligence officer.

bL
Comment: According to anf report, when
NOSENKO became t60 persistent in his attentions

and the secretary reported the contact to her
superiors she was withdrawn immediately from
Switzerland and she later resigned from the

' Foreign offica. ey

This ‘s. nt came to the attention of
tel ea tmten later reported it to
_CIA, without detai S, as an attempt by NOSENKO

to recruit the girl. According to this report,
“after a time it became evident that ‘NOSENKO's
interest in her was not only sexual, but: also

in information to which shi in the
course of her duties". A in \¢
Geneva told CIA that NOSE a efinitely tried

to recruit the secretary and that he attempted
to obtain "disarmament secrets" from her.

Supervising Case Officer for KGB-Controlled CIA Agent
BELITSKIY

NOSENKO's Information

Among his other activities in Geneva NOSENKO supervised
@ younger and less experienced KGB case officer's handling of
KGB double agent BELITSKIY. He first heard cof the BELITSKIY
case under the code name "BELKIN", when he was working in the
American Embassy Section of the American Department. He

learned of the case through his friendship with the chief
of-the Second ("Active Line") Section of the American Depart:
ment, V.I: PETROV. BELITSKIY wasia KGB agent whom American
Intelligence had-recruited in London: he had never been met.
by ‘the Americans in the Soviet Union.. NOSENKO did not: know
the’ dateof recruitment but knew the case was, already in pro=
gress during his. second ‘assignment ‘with. the Embassy Section
(January, 1960-January 1962).  BELITSKIY had been a KGB agent
fora’ "long,;: long" time and was a KGB agent when. he first
went abroad’ (prior to his’ recruitment by American Intelli-
gence). :

The KGB's purpose in running. the BELITSKIY “operation was
to lure American Intelligence into meeting the agent inside
“isthe Soviet -Union,;,.to learn the channels and means through
which American Intelligence. communicated with. agents inside
the Soviet Union. This was the "most important task" of the
Second Chief Directorate: Although BELITSKIY, in meeting
with his American’ case officers, continually pleaded fear of
contacts with American Intelligence in Moscow, this was’a
ruse; the real. KGB-intent .was to: use BELITSKIY' to lure Ameri-
tan Intelligence. into contacting him.in the Soviet Union.
After BELITSKIY was recruited in London, CIA "did not go on
with him... didn't: hold any meetings with: him". . Nevertheless,
/- hevsaid, the KGB’ "cherished. the hope...to lead him in some-
“what -deeper". The ‘KGB. First Chief Directorate, with its-own
responsibilities ‘and objectives, was. unaware of Second Chief
Directorate objectives in the BELITSKIY case. The First
Chief Directorate, ‘through Department. D, provided dezinformat-
siya” [disinformation] at the Second: Chief Directorate's re-
quest, but in this case, as in other,"games",.it.did not know
for what ultimate purpose ‘the disinformation would be used.
(In, such cases I.I.°AGAYANTS, Chief of Department. D, did not
even know, in what country the disinformation was to be used;
let alone the identity of the agent.) :

Comment: According’ to GOLITSYN,. Department: D runs its
operations alone or in conjunction with (never
- Subordinate to) other KGB departments. :

NOSENKO. did not actively participate in the case until he
received in Geneva a cable from Moscow directing him to give
advice to the young and inexperienced case officer V.L. ARTE-
MOV. ARTEMOV had not worked on the BELITSKIY case in Moscow
either; he also had been sent to Geneva to work on counter-
intelligence matters and only to direct BELITSKIY df the Ameri-
cans should. contact the agent. BELITSKIY had been “inserted"
in a World Health Organization Delegation in the hope that CIA
would "find him".

As a result of that KGB instruction, NOSENKO jcined with
ARTEMOV in directing BELITSKIY's meetings with the latter's
American case officers. BELITSKIY Was first: met™in Geneva by
the American case officer "Bob", and later by "Henry", who
was “called out from the States". BELITSKIY noted that the
name on the door of the apartment where he met his American
case officers was not the same as that of the person whose
apartment it was alleged to be, and that the apartment itself
had an "“un-lived-in" look.

When the American case officers asked BELITSKIY whether he
could establish contact with a Russian on the Disarmament
Delegation, NOSENKO advised ARTEMOV not to use anyone from
the Soviet Foreign Ministry. NOSENKO proposed instead that
BELITSKLY claim to get information from the head of the
American Department of TASS, A.K. KISLOV. The information,
of course, would be (disinformation) furnished by the KGB.

In case the Americans would check, NOSENKO and ARTEMOV ar-
ranged for BELITSKLY to be introduced to KISLOV.

The KGB believed that CIA had accepted BELITSKIY's bona
fides. From the KGB viewpoint, however, while BELITSKIY was
not a bad agent, he was apt to go too far sometimes, and "add
things on his own". For this reason, the KGB limited BELIT-
SKIY's time spent with CIA, to lessen the chance that the
agent might say something which would cause CIA to sense that
he was a plant.

Comment: NOSENKO's information ‘about the BELITSKIY-CIA
: relationship is substantially correct, except
for some inaccuracies about the origin of the
:,¢ase. BELITSKIY, a commentator. for Radio. Mos-
cow, as NOSENKO described, in Geneva did. meet
CIA. officers using the aliases "Bob" and "Henry"
in a safe apartment.

.NOSENKO's version of his role in the case,
however, is implausible. He asserts that BELIT-
SKIY, a prominent Russian with acquaintances
among influential officials of the Soviet Govern—
ment, an.agent ostensibly. undér-the control of

“CIA for several years, was sent by the KGB to
Geneva: to*resume contact with CIA. The KGB, ac-
cording to NOSENKO, sent neither the responsible
case officer nor an officer of the KGB section
responsible for the operation. NOSENKO states

. that the KGB instead detailed a “young and in-
experienced" KGB officer who happened to be in
Geneva at. the time, an officer who had no prior
connection with the BELITSKIY. case nor even.
knowledge.of operating conditions in Geneva.
NOSENKO further states that the KGB then instruc-
‘ted. NOSENKO, who had learned of the case unoffi+
delly, who had no. experience: or training in
double agent operations, and.who was similarly
in Geneva ‘for other. reasons, to guide the other
"inexperienced" KGB officer.- NOSENKO can cite
no guidancé provided by KGB Headquarters, .al-~
though he claims he exchanged messages with

involvement with American tourist agents in
1958 and 1959, during a period when NOSENKO
claims to have been Deputy Chief of the Seventh
Départment's American Section.

Under interrogation NOSENKO did not know
how, when, or where the BELITSKIY operation
started, did not know the nature of British||
involvement, did not know the operational -
tails and contact arrangements BELITSKIY had
with CIA, did not know BELITSKIY's pattern of
activity in Moscow or in Geneva, and did not
know the alleged objective of the KGB opera-
tion, e.g., the substance of the "disinformation"
which BELITSKIY was to provide CIA.

From the foregoing it is concluded that
NOSENKO did not exercise any supervisory func-
tion in the BELITSKIY case.

Contact with CIA :
ee oes o8
On 5 June 1962 U.S. Foreign Service Officer [David MARK]

reported to CIA in Geneva that he had been approached by a
Soviet citizen whom he believed to be Yuriy Ivanovich NOSENKO,
a member of the Soviet Disarmament Delegation. NOSENKO had
merely suggested that they get together for a talk on the
following day.. In late afternoon on 6 June, NOSENKO told

(MARR| privately that he would like to talk to (MaRR] as soon as Ut

possible. He was "not going to pump him for information", but
"simply wanted to tell him some things". A luncheon meeting
was arranged for 9 June, although NOSENO indicated that he
preferred an éarlier date .0t (MaRK] advised CIA of* the appoint-
ment and commented that the approach seemed so unusual that
it might be an offer of cooperation or defection.

be an American intelligence officer. NOSENKO said he needed
approximately 900 Swiss francs immediately to cover KGB opera-
tional funds which he had squandered on liquor and a prosti-
tute in Geneva, and offéred for this amount to'sell.two items
of information to American Intelligence. The first item was ©
the identity ofan American, a former employee of the Embassy
in Moscow,'who’was a KGB agent. “near ciphers". in the Washing-
‘ton area. The second item was. the identity of a Soviet. citi-
zen.in.Moscow who, although ostensibly a CIA agent, had been
planted’ on CIA by the KGB. Although NOSENKO proposed’ a one-
time. transaction, he acknowledged to[MARK|that he might. be
‘unable’ to avoid déeper, involvement with American Intelligence.

‘[MARK|introduced NOSENKO ‘to a CIA officer the evening of
9. June “and NOSENKO was taken to the first of five lengthy
meetings held in a CIA safehouse. At the initial meeting
» NOSENKO described himself as a. KGB major: experienced in opera-
/tions. against the American.Embassy. in Moscow, and against
American.tourists and other travellers to the Soviet Union.
He: told of his financial difficulties and. repeated his offer

CIA, although in.the ensuing discussion he asserted also that
he ‘was dissatisfied with the Communist régime in.the ‘Soviet

action, he would have no further contact with CIA. . Despite
this “assertion,.after describing the cases .of -““ANDREY" ae

audio surveillance operation against the Embassy in Moscow.
Among foreign agents of the KGB NOSENKO identified Canadian
Ambassador WATKINS ‘see p. 23 ) and described a British Ad-
mixalty employee (William VASSALL, see p. 30 ). He talked
freely of his activities in Geneva, including his association
with KGB officers there, his visits to the KGB residency
and his security duties with respect to the Soviet delega-
tion. NOSENKO seemed to CIA to be what he claimed: a KGB
officer with personal knowledge of important and sensitive
KGB operations. ‘He described his education, his service in
the Naval GRU, his entry into the KGB and the general func~
tions and operating techniques of the various components of
the Second Chief Directorate in which he had served, along
with the approximate dates of his service.

Ultimately the only restriction which NOSENKO placed on
his cooperation with CIA was his refusal to permit communica-
tion with him in the Soviet Union. He was willing to meet
with CIA representatives during future trips outside the
Soviet Union, which he estimated would occur about once every other
year. He said he would not consider defecting except in cir-
cumstances in which his personal security was endangered,
citing as reasons his devotion to his wife and children (and
fear of KGB reprisal against them if he fled), his widowed
mother's dependence on him, and his love of Russia:.and the
Russian people.’

NOSENKO promised to contact CIA and arrangements were
made for him to do so, when he came to the West again.
Meanwhile, he expressed the intention to do everything within
limits imposed by concern for his own security to obtain in-
formation which he was informed was of interest to CIA.

First Deputy Chief, and thus second-in-command to CHELNOKOV
and general supervisor of all Second Chief Directorate tourist
operations. The Seventh Department, which had a strength of
about. 100 KGB officers, was responsible for all operations
against tourists in the Soviet Union. From this period NOSENKO
Claimed to have learned, either by virtue of his position as
Deputy Chief of otherwise, of a number of KGB operations
against Americans, including two arrests, one recruitment, and
investigations of a suspected FBI agent and of Lee Harvey
OSWALD. NOSENKO as well attributes to his senior KGB posi-
tion during this period his knowledge of an American GRU agent
and of the KGB investigation of a disaffected American Embassy
Section officer, the latter occurring just before NOSENKO re-
turned to Geneva for the second time, and defected.

(SLESINGER| came under suspicion by the KGB First

with a number of Soviets who visited his store and in

. Whom he seemed to show more than casual interest. The

First Chief Directorate was of the Opinion that

some Soviets, to.study them. (GLESINGER had visited the
Soviet Union several times. Léarning SLESINGER] plannedOh
another trip to the USSR, the KGB suspected that "he
might make some contacts or do something interesting"
while visiting the Soviet Union.o6 The KGB wanted to
resolve its suspicions that [SLESINGER] was possibly an
agent or [ersstvce? contact of the FBI. The KGB had

Arrest of BARGHOORN

At the first of the 1964 meetings in Geneva NOSENKO
described the provocation and arrest of Yale University
Professor Frederick BARGHOORN in late 1963. NOSENKO's
most comprehensive statement, from which the following
Paragraphs were largely drawn, was made on 9 June 1964,
NOSENKO said that the purpose of the KGB operation
against BARGHOORN was to retaliate for persona non grata
action taken against three Soviets in New York City in
the case of John W. BUTENKO {in November 1963] and to
secure a hostage in exchange for a fourth Soviet (Igor
IVANOV) in the BUTENKO case who was jailed. (NOSENKO
had asserted in Geneva, earlier, that the operation
against BARGHOORN "was to discourage future arrests
such as that of IVANOV, not because of any special im-
portance of IVANOV himself.")

NOSENKO's Information

In 1963 four KGB First Chief Directorate officers
assigned to the New York Legal Residency were caught in
operational activity in the United States. Of the four,
three had diplomatic immunity, but one was a chauffeur
and had only a service passport. The three Soviet
diplomats were held three or four hours by the American
authorities and then released. IVANOV, the chauffeur,
was arrested since he did not have diplomatic immunity.
GRIBANOV, Chief of the KGB Second Chief Directorate,
learned of this arrest probably the next day and was
directed’ by KGB. Chairman Semichastnyy to take “necessary
measures." GRIBANOV thereupon called to his office
NOSENKO; A.G. KOVALENKO, Chief of the Seventh Department;
and G.I. GRYAZNOV and Ye. M. RASHCHEPOV from the
American. Department. After describing the arrest,
GRIBANOV asked what information the Second Chief
Directorate Departments had on any American, Embassy
employee or tourist, that could serve as the victim of
an [retaliatory] arrest. RASHCHEPOV and GRYAZNOV said
that at that very moment there were three or four
American Service Attaches in Rostov and that, in the
opinion of the American Department, these officers might
be carrying electronic apparatus. It was known that they
had cameras, that they had been taking photographs, and
they had been-observed taking notes, They could be
arrested in Rostov before they took the return Plane to

Moscow. 298

GRIBANOV instructed the two representatives. of the
American Department to write a report on what other
possibilities existed. He ‘also told. them to request
permission | to. arrest and search ‘the Service Attaches.

_GRIBANOV- ‘then asked what. pertinent information was
held by the Sevenfh Department. He was told that there
were relatively few. American tourists in:the Soviet,
‘Union at:.that time. These included BARGHOORN, who was
mentioned ‘to GRIBANOV:,along.with one other (name not’

“that the KGB had no. “strong" materials to use against

It was GRIBANOV who raised the possibility of giving
"materials" to BARGHOORN in Moscow. NOSENKO said that
this would be a provocation, but GRIBANOV replied that
this made no difference. He instructed NOSENKO and
KOVALENKO to locate an agent who could be used to pass
the compromi‘sing material to BARGHOORN and told them
to write a summary of BARGHOORN's background with a
proposal that the Second Chief Directorate arrest him
“when he obtains materials which are of interest to
american Intelligence." This was to be sent in letter
form to Semichastnyy over GRIBANOV's signature; the
letter was not to indicate how BARGHOORN was to receive
the materials. (That the evidence was to be planted
was not to be mentioned.)

GRIBANOV took a one-page letter on BARGHOORN, along
with a similar letter from GRYAZNOV and RASHCHEPOV
concerning the Service Attaches, to Semichastnyy. While
the four -~- NOSENKO,. KOVALENKO, GRYAZNOV and RASHCHEPOV ~~
were waiting in GRIBANOV's office for his return,
GRYAZNOV received a telephone call from the Rostov KGB
organization informing. him that the Service Attaches
were in the air on their. way back to Moscow. Shortly
thereafter, GRIBANOV returned with the news that the
Chairman of the KGB had approved the arrests of the
Service Attaches as well as BARGHOORN. Khrushchev was
absent. from Moscow at the time, but Semichastnyy had
called BREZHNEV and secured his approval.

When. GRIBANOV. learned from GRYAZNOV that the Service
Attaches were already. on their way back to Moscow, he
became furious and.sent. GRYAZNOV out "to do the job or
die." Meanwhile, arrangements were made with the
“Department D" (the ‘KGB. element responsible for .dis-
information, subordinate. to the First Chief Directorate)
to provide materials on missiles which could be passed
to BARGHOORN. While these were being picked up, NOSENKO
and KOVALENKO returned to their office to plan the arrest.

BARGHOORN was placed under immediate surveillance
upon his arrival in Moscow. At 1810 hours a radio
message was received from one of the surveillance cars
that BARGHOORN had gone to the American Embassy, and it
was decided that the agent (name not recalled, aged 25
to 30 years) would be placed in contact with him as soon
as he came_out. The KGB knew BARGHOORN had an appoint-
ment with |ORCHARD of the British Embassy| at 1900 hours ,04 21

the missile documents.) The first sessions
i concentrated on general matters, such as
BARGHOORN's life history.

After one and one half hours of questioning
BARGHOORN agreed that the materials were on him
when he was arrested, but he maintained that they had
been placed on his person. He said that he thought
they were “newspapers Or something," that he did not
know what they were. The package was then opened and
shown to BARGHOORN; it contained about 20 to 25 pages
of information on missiles. "BARGHOORN was not, of
course, given a close look" at ‘the materials.

Following BARGHOORN's admission, another declaration
was drawn up by KRUPNOV and signed by KRUPNOV,
KOVALENKO, and GRIBANOV. NOSENKO and KRUPNOV then
took it to the office of the Chief Prosecutor where
the incident report, the first interrogation, and
the first and second declarations were reported to
MISHUTIN, the First Deputy Chief Prosecutor. ,GRIBANOV
directed that all materials on BARGHOORN, including
information from KGB Archives, be given to the KGB
Department of Prosecution so that they could begin
legal proceedings against BARGHOORN. After this, all
interrogations were conducted by that department;
KRUPNOV was dropped from the case; although YEFREMOV.
continued to act as interpreter.

Comment: . BARGHOORN’s version of his. entrapment,
arrest, and interrogation coincide fairly
precisely. with. the version provided by
NOSENKO. He identified NOSENKO from a
photograph as a KGB officer present at
one stage of the interrogation on the
second day of his arrest and said
NOSENKO took some part in the pro-
ceedings. He recalled NOSENKO as being
“clever and quick~witted" and as "giving
the impression that he was not a dedicated
careerist, but opportunistic and adaptive:
he seemed not to care about what he was
doing, but doing a good job nevertheless."

did he come to the attention of NOSENKO, who was, at

Although the KGB considered it possible that OSWALD

might be an American agent, the KGB did nothing to
investigate this possibility because "this would be

done after the person is allowed to stay in the Soviet
Union." Surveillance of OSWALD was not increased after
his request, and OSWALD was not interviewed by the KGB

in an attempt to establish his intentions. KRUPNOV

sent NOSENKO, his chief, a memorandum on information

which had been received concerning OSWALD. The memorandum
cited reports by KGB informants at the Hotel Berlin, where
OSWALD was staying in accordance with an Inturist itinerary
and a two-page report by the Inturist interpreter to whom
OSWALD made his initial request to remain in the Soviet
Union. A file incorporating all information which KRUPNOV
had collected was thereupon opened in NOSENKO's section.

From this information NOSENKO and KRUPNOV concluded
that OSWALD was of no interest to the KGB, and both agreed
that OSWALD appeared somewhat "abnormal." For this reason
NOSENKO. instructed KRUPNOV to advise OSWALD through the
Inturist interpreter that he would not be permitted to
Yemain permanently in the USSR and that he-must depart on
the expiration of his visa, then seek re-entry. as a’
permanent resident. through normal. channels. at the Soviet
Embassy in Washington. KRUPNOV followed NOSENKO.'s orders,
and either that day or thé next NOSENKO learned that OSWALD
failed to appear for a scheduled tour. arranged by his
Inturist' guide. This prompted a search, and.after several
hours, OSWALD was found in his hotel room, bleeding heavily
from self-inflicted wounds. After hearing of this incident
from KRUPNOV, NOSENKO then reported it to K.N. DUBAS, Chief
of the Seventh Department. NOSENKO believed that DUBAS in
turn reported it to GRIBANOV, head of the KGB Second Chief
Directorate. GRIBANOV upheld NOSENKO's. original decision
that the KGB.should not become involved with. OSWALD and
that OSWALD should not be permitted to remain in the USSR.

There was no attempt to. debrief OSWALD because "he was
not an interesting person and wasn't normal." OSWALD was
never questioned on his past nor asked to write an  auto-
biography.

NOSENKO did not know who eventually granted
OSWALD permission to reside temporarily in the. USSR
or who approved issuance of his temporary residence permit.
The KGB gave instructions: that he not be allowed to live
-in the Moscow. area. Either. the Soviet Red Cross or the
Ministry of Foreign. Affairs may: have made this decision

his file, and it. was sent; along with a cover letter pre--
pared by KRUPNOV, to the local KGB organization in Minsk.”
KRUPNOV's letter summarized the case and specifically in-
-.Structed local authorities there to take no action. con-
cerning OSWALD ‘except to observe his activities “passively"
_to make sure that he was: not an “American Intelligence agent

--and it.was signed by DUBAS...On the basis of the instructions
contained in. the letter, NOSENKO said, no active steps.could
be taken in Minsk..without. KGB Headquarters approval.: It was
‘.NOSENKO's opinion that. the only coverage of OSWALD during
his stay in Minsk consisted of periodic checks at -his
.Place of employment, .questioning. of his neighbors and
associates, .and coverage of his ‘mail. After, OSWALD's
-threatened second suicide attempt, the KGB "washed its

NOSENKO thought he himself was present at the time. ALEKSEYEV
was given OSWALD's background, including his suicide attempt
and the fact that he was not considered normal, and was

told to advise the First Chief Directorate that OSWALD should
not be permitted to return to the Soviet Union. ALEKSEYEV
relayed this information to the First Chief Directorate,

NOSENKO did not know to whom OSWALD had spoken at the
Soviet Embassy in Mexico City, and he knew of no contacts
between OSWALD and Cubans or representatives of the Cuban
Government there or elsewhere.

Comment: Independent sources, however, reported on
visits by OSWALD to the Cuban. as well as
Soviet Embassies in Mexico City between 29
September. and 3. October 1963 and on his
(apparently overt) contact with a KGB officer
under Consular cover at the Soviet Embassy
there. _ NOSENKO originally said he knew
nothing of: any such contact. In October 1966
he ‘revised this to say that OSWALD did not
have contact with the KGB in Mexico City.
NOSENKO explained that he had been sitting in
the office of Seventh Department Chief, K.N.
DUBAS, when a cable arrived at Moscow Head-
quarters from the KGB Legal Residency in
Mexico. The cable, which NOSENKO said he did
not personally see, reported that OSWALD had
visited the Soviet. Embassy in Mexico City
requesting permission to return to the USSR
and that the cable specified that OSWALD had
dealt with Soviet Foreign Ministry personnel
only. i :

of President Kennedy's assassination. About two-hours after
President. Kennedy was shot, NOSENKO was advised of this.-fact
in a telephone -call.to his home from.KGB Headquarters. -A

. short while ‘later he was told, again by telephone, that the

President had died. . About two hours later,  NOSENKO was told

. that OSWALD ‘had been arrested, and‘ he and the other ‘officers

of the American Tourist Section were called in to determine
whether. the KGB. had any information concerning him. After“
establishing" OSWALD's identity from*KGB) files and learning
that his file was still in Minsk, NOSENKO ‘phoned the.KGB
office in Minsk ,on GRIBANOV"s orders. The local KGB: dictated
over the telephone a summary of its file on OSWALD. This ~
summary. concluded with the statement that the KGB in Minsk
had attempted: "to influence OSWALD in the. right direction".
GRIBANOV..had been greatly disturbed: about the local: KGB's
efforts because. it had been -given specific «instructions to
carry out nothing ‘other® than passive measures against OSWALD
there. He ordered that: all’ records in Minsk pertaining to.
OSWALD's stay..theré, “as well. as an explanation of the

OSWALD never received any KGB training or KGB assign~
ments. If any other department of the KGB or the GRU had
wanted to use OSWALD in any way, it would have had to secure
permission from the Seventh Department, which originally
opened his case file. In view of OS"MALD's apparent mental
instability, no Sdviet intelligence organization, particu-
larly not the Thirteenth (Assassination and Sabotage)
Department, would have considered using him. KGB Head-
quarters did not maintain a control file on him following
his settlement in Minsk, as it would have done had OS'ALD
been of any operational interest. The only KGB record on
OSWALD maintained in Moscow was an index card giving his
name and the fact the Seventh Department had originated a
file concerning him.

The KGB maintained no separate file on Marina OSWALD;

E all information about her was kept in OSWALD's file. There
| was no indication in OSWALD's file that the KGB had had any
“ey interest in Marina either while she was in the Soviet Union
or after she left for the United States.

Comment: NOSENKO later told CIA on one occasion that he
“only skimmed the file" and on another that he
had it in his possession about 20 minutes. In
October 1966 he again said that he read the
file and that while doing so he saw a picture
of OSWALD for the first time. NOSENKO added
that he never met OSWALD personally.

NOSENKO's assertion that the KGB First Chief
Directorate first learned of OSWALD when he
applied for a re-entry visa in Mexico City in
September 1963 is probably incorrect. The
consular file turned over to the U.S. Govern-
ment by the Soviet Embassy in Washington
after the assassination indicated that the KGB
First Chief Directorate would have known of
OSWALD as early as February 1963 if not earlier.
That file contained Marina OSWALD's letter of
February 1963 and a letter of July 1963 from
OS'IALD, both of which indicated that OSWALD had

At his first meeting with CIA in January 1964 NOSENKO
related how a disaffected former KGB colleague, A.N.
CHEREPANOV, had stolen documents from the American Embassy
Section and in November 1963 sent them through an inter-
mediary to the American Embassy. CHEREPANOV's treason was
discovered, NOSENKO said, when the Embassy returned the
documents to Soviet authorities. CHEREPANOV fled Moscow,
and NOSENKO claimed to have taken part in the KGB search
for him. NOSENKO brought with him to Geneva the official
KGB document which authorized his travel in the search for
CHEREPANOV.

The significance of the CIEREPANOV incident is twofold.
The KGB documents which CHEREPANOV allegedly sent to the
Embassy appear to have originated in the American Depart~-
ment's Embassy Section,. and the documents relate to KGB
modus operandi, personnel,.targets, and technical devices
employed in operations during 1958-1960, during part of
which time NOSENKO claimed he was Deputy Chief of the
Embassy Section. The KGB document, the “temporary duty
authorization", is an item of physical evidence NOSENKO
has offered to substantiate his claim to personal parti-
cipation in the CHEREPANOV case and to having held the rank
of KGB lieutenant colonel. [The document does not itself
refer to CHEREPANOV in any manner. ]

NOSENKO's Information

The KGB officer, A.N. CHEREPANOV was born about 1920 or
1921, During World War II he was a KGB officer working
with partisan groups behind the lines. Later he was in
Yugoslavia for four or. five years, and was probably Deputy
Chief of the KGB Legal Residency in Belgrade.

Comment: CIA records contain references to an Aleksandr -
Nikolayevich CHEREPANOV, a Soviet diplomat and
suspected intelligence officer in Belgrade in
1953. CHEREPANOV left Belgrade in 1956. A
Yugoslav intelligence officer who defected in
1957 confirmed that CHEREPANOV had been an
intelligence officer.

_ When CHEREPANOV. returned to Moscow, he had: some (unspecified)
problem getting a job, but finally the KGB Second Chief

poor, and as it: grew.worse, the KGB decided: to' retire him. -

Because .of his. service in World ‘War II, for which he :

When the American Embassy saw the CHEREPANOV documents,
they were afraid that the documents were part of a KGB
provocation, and they wondered what the Russians were
trying to do. The Embassy officials photographed the
documents and on the next day returned them to the Ministry
of Foreign Affairs. When the Americans gave the documents
to the Ministry, .the KGB wondered why the Americans gave
them back.

The whole matter was held very tightly in the KGB during
its investigation for 20 or 25 days. When the KGB examined
the documents, some were found to be in CHEREPANOV's hand-
writing, but no documents were found which pertained to
CHEREPANOV's own case work, or that of the American Embassy I
Section. The KGB found no documents dated later than
1961--none for 1962 or 1963--only 1959, 1960 and 1961. Thus
there were a number of indications pointing towards i
CHEREPANOV, who had left the section in 1961. The KGB did
not dare alert him by putting full-time surveillance on him,
but instead mounted fixed surveillance posts at his home and |
office. In order to provoke CHEREPANOV into some precipitous
action, a former KGB colleague was sent to visit him who, in
Is the course of. conversation, mentioned the great disturbance
in the KGB caused by someone passing stolen KGB documents |
to the Americans. CHEREPANOV manifested no reaction to the
news and was quite cool about the matter. The next day the
: surveillance post observed him leaving his house in the |
_— morning at his usual time, apparently on his way to work,
q but the surveillance post at his office soon reported that

q he had’ not arrived at work. He had “simply dropped out of |
i sight".
An intensive search “all over the city of Moscow" ensued,
then spread throughout the Soviet Union: Border controls |

were tightened, photographs of CHEREPANOV were sent out to

F Republic.and local. KGB and militia offices, and all.means

I . of transport were covered. Reports began coming in from |
various places that someone who seemed to fit CHEREPANOV's

i description had been seen acting suspiciously here and there.
Reports which came into KGB Headquarters from Gorkiy Oblast |

strongly indicated the possibility of CHEREPANOV's presence

there, so NOSENKO was dispatched to the area to check.

woods, “where a person could low-himsélf for life". - On the

.séventh day CHEREPANOV was located and arrested‘ in Baku,

where he was on. his way to the Iranian ‘border.

A special plane was immediately sent to Baku, carrying
‘S.M. FEDOSEYEV and several other American. Department: offi-
cers. They brought CIEREPANOV immediately back to Moscow;
interrogating. him on the plane. ; He immediately confessed
to having given the documents to the Americans. When asked
why, he said he was’ “angry at the kKGR, very angry", and
besides, he thought he might ask the Americans for’ some’
money in ‘return” for the documents. He confessed that on
4 November he’ had. passed the documents ‘to’ ‘an American tourist.

had given the. documents ‘to the American in the entrance

Contents of the CHERFPANOV Package

The KGB documents in the CHEREPANOV package totalled
103 pages in the original Russian version, divided almost
equally between typewritten reports in final form and hand-
written draft reports or notes, plus two copies of letters
written by Soviet citizens to the American Embassy. The
longest single document was a 33-page Top Secret report,
dated 18 April 1959, entitled “Operational Conditions in
the U.S.A. and the Activities of American Counterinteliligence
Organs against Soviet Installations and Soviet Citizens in
the U.S.A. in 1957-1958". The report was signed by Colonel
A. FEKLISOV, [alias FOMIN, the former KGB rezident in
Washington]. whose title is given as "Chief, Pirst [American]
Department, First Chief Directorate". The rest of the
documents refer to KGB coverage of various American Embassy
and American diplomats in Moscow during the period August
1958 to 15 October 1960. Most of the documents were prepared
by or for one senior case officer of the Embassy Section,
First Department, Second Chief Directorate, Major V. KUSKOV.
(NOSENKO has identified V.A. KUSKOV as an officer of the
Second Chief Directorate who shared an office with CHEREPANOV
from about 1958 to 1961.) Two reports were on Americans who
had left the Soviet Union, Edward L. KILLHAM, Second Secretary
from July 1957 to July 1959, and Wallace L. LITTELL, Attache
from June 1956 to July 1958. There were operational plans
for agent work against four American diplomats once stationed
in Moscow, Richard HARMSTONE, Lewis W. BOWDEN, James A.
RAMSEY, and George. WINTERS. Other documents included were
an agent's report of her relationship with WINTERS, a summary
of LANGELLE's activities while in the USSR, a list of Soviet
citizens whose letters to the Embassy had been intercepted
by the KGB, a handwritten:summary (signed by CHEREPANOV). of
derogatory information on a Soviet youth who had been in
touch with American Consul Richard SNYDER, and various hand-
written drafts and notes on the foregoing Americans.

The operational plan on WINTERS, as an example, indicated
that WINTERS had already been identified as an intelligence
officer, and to ascertain the nature of his intelligence
activities, the KGB was to employ round-the-clock surveil-
lance, technical aids metka and: "NEPTUNE-80", audio surveil-
lance, and investigation of his contacts among Soviet
citizens. The plan “reflected that while the KGB judgment
was that WINTERS "had:a hostile-attitude toward the USSR"
and. that there “was no basis for recruitment", care should
be‘taken not to alarm him and cause him to leave the country
prematurely, since there still might.arise an opportunity
to attempt to recruit him.

NOSENKO said that he had never seen the documents i
CHEREPANOV passed -to -the Embassy, although-he was familiar

with their. substance.

Comment: NOSENKO has never provided a satisfactory

explanation for his retention of the document

nor for bringing it to Geneva. According to

an earlier KGB defector, the bearer of a
| temporary duty authorization is held strictly

accountable for the document which has to be

turned in with the financial voucher. What-
ever NOSENKO's purpose, the effect of presenting
the dacument to CIA was to corroborate his
statements about CHEREPANOV and substantiate
his claim that he was a KGB lieutenant colonel.
NOSENKO was not a lieutenant colonel (see p.350).
When he eventually said in 1966 that he was
only a captain, NOSENKO was challenged to
explain how he came to possess an official KGB
document signed by General GRIBANOV and
identifying him as a lieutenant colonel.
NOSENKO asserted that it came about "by mistake".

Return to Geneva (January-February 1964)

NOSENKO was detailed a second time to perform security
escort duties with the Soviet delegation to the Disarmament
Conference, and he returned to Geneva in January 1964 where
he resumed contact with CIA and announced his intention to
defect. He brought with him a considerable number of hand-
written notes to which he referred when describing to CIA
officers KGB. operations of which he claimed he learned at
KGB Headquarters during 1962 and-1963. His delegation
security duties were not onerous. He visited the Geneva
i Legal Residency daily and met with CIA almost as frequently
t while awaiting approval of his defection and exfiltration
from Switzerland, tentatively scheduled for some three

- weeks later. -A little. more than a week after his arrival,
however, NOSENKO declared that he had to defect at once,
because he had received cabled instructions to return to the
USSR immediately. On 4 February 1964 NOSENKO was taken from
Switzerland to Germany, and on 12 February he was brought
to the United States.

Purpose of Geneva Trip

NOSENKO explained that it was his personal wish that
had brought him to‘Geneva, that he was allowed to travel as
“a treat" when it appeared to be the last occasion he might
have to travel to the West. [NOSENKO said in 1962 that when
he became Deputy Chief of the Seventh Department, as he
expected to become, he would travel to the West every two
or three years.] He had discussed the possibility of the
trip in 1963 with then-Seventh Department Chief CHELNOKOV,
and secured his agreement. He also talked with officers
of the Soviet Delegations Department, but after it had been
decided that he should go, the Chief of that Department,
{N.T.] ZHARIKOV, suggested that it might be unnecessary for
a security officer to accompany this particular delegation.
[A.G.] KOVALENKO, the new Chief of the Seventh Department,
supported NOSENKO's assignment as a personal favor. ‘Although
at one time NOSENKO said that GRIBANOV approved the trip, he
has later asserted ‘that GRIBANOV.was. not involved and that
if GRIBANOV had learned of NOSENKO's plans, he would:not
have permitted NOSENKO to go.

i NOSENKO's. only mission was to concern. himseif with the
general security of the delegation, as he had done in 1962.
He had no specific tasks such as on his earlier assignment
(e.g., investigating GIAKIDV or supervising the BELITSKIY
operation). :

Comment: . NOSENKO has never, satisfactorily explained why
a Deputy Chief of the Seventh Department would
draw an unrelated assignment abroad which
would last many weeks if not months. In
another context, NOSENKO had described a KGB

Visits to Legal Residency

As in 1962, NOSENKO said he visited the Legal Resi-
dency daily. According to strict rules, he explained, an
officer in his status (temporary duty assignment which was
independent of Residency] should not do so, but his case
was exceptional because he was a Deputy Chief of Department
and because of the relationship he established in 1962
through the intervention of M.S. TSYMBAL. Illegals Direct-
orate Chief TSYMBAL, NOSENKO related in 1964, was an old
friend; they had become acquainted in Moscow before meeting
again in Geneva in 1962, when they dined together frequently.
TSYMBAL's wife once had taught NOSENKO in school, and
TSYMBAL had once offered NOSENKO a job in the Illegals
Directorate. NOSENKO asserted that TSYMBAL's introduction
of NOSENKO to Rezident GAVRICHEV in 1962 permitted NOSENKO
to frequent the Legal Residency in 1964.

Comment: In 1962 NOSENKO attributed his access to the
Residency to his "old friend Yury GUK", not
TSYMBAL, . He mentioned TSYMBAL's presence in
Geneva but claimed no close acquaintance.

Availability for Meetings with CIA

In 1964 NOSENKO behaved as if he had no official
responsibilities or any demands on his time, and he was
willing to spend all of his ‘time in meetings with CIA... He
said that his absence from the Disarmament Delegation could
be explained as “security duties" since everyone on the
Delegation knew or suspected that he was a KGB officer.
From the first meeting on 24 January until 4 February,
NSOENKO met CIA officers thirteen times for meetings usually
lasting for five or six hours. By mutual agreement, most
of the meetings started in the afternoon. On two occasions
NOSENKO arrived as early as 0930 hours and several meetings
continued until past midnight.

NOSENKO's Written Notes

After returning to KGB Headquarters from Geneva in
1962, NOSENKO said, he had availed himself of various
opportunities to record what he learned of KGB operations
‘<-in order-to inform CIA, and to pilfer appropriate ‘KGB

which to keep the notes was just: fortuitous,
since neither all offices had such safes, nor
even all offices of Deputy Chiefs.

NOSENKO's Defection

On arrival for his first meeting with CIA during the
second Geneva. phase, on 24 January 1964, NOSENKO said that
after long and careful consideration since the 1962 meeting
series, he had decided to defect. He explained that he had
recently been promoted to the position of First Deputy Chief
of the Seventh Department, and that because of the stature
and responsibilities of his new job, there would be few if
any opportunities for him to visit the Nest in the future.
Therefore, he had decided to seize the opportunity at hand
and to flee to the United States at once, leaving his family
behind. He foresaw no possibility of his wife and children
being permitted to leave the USSR for the "next twenty
years". NOSENKO told CIA that. "the hardest thing is. to part
with my family". He had, however, carefully considered their
fate as the close relatives of a defector, and he felt that,
because of his mother's position in Soviet society, no harm
would come to them,

NOSENKO was told that CIA accepted in principle his
decision to defect. NOSENKO felt that it would be best for
him to disappear from Geneva without a trace, leaving all
his personal possessions hehind; he assumed that CIA would
exfiltrate him from Switzerland to the United States. He
wanted to carry out this plan as soon as possible, but the
CIA officers encouraged “him--and NOSENKO agreed--to remain
in place for at least three weeks more. The reasons given
NOSENKO for this request were:

~The desire ‘to obtain further information on the
local KGB Legal Residency and the Soviet delegation to
the Disarmament Conference while he still had access;

Gb4 503 320
TS No. 197124

Top Secret Copy —____



Top Secret

(SEVENTH DEPARTMENT - January 1962-January 1964)

~The value of having NOSENKO present when. GRIBANOV
made a visit to Geneva about 7 February, a visit known ©
to CIA only. through NOSENKO;

~The ‘potential’ value to be derived from NOSENKO's
in-place spotting of CIA recruitment targets. among the
Soviet representation in Geneva; 7

~The necessity of making arrangements, acceptable to
NOSENKO,. for his defection and resettlement.

In a three~and-a-half hour meeting on 26 January
" NOSENKO ‘emphasized that although -he agreed that it was
-necessary..and useful for him to remain in- place until
GRIBANOV visited Geneva, he wanted to. defect as soon as
possible thereafter. fee

On.28° January NOSENKO reported that GRIBANOV might not
be. coming ‘to Geneva’ after all, for. KGB Chairman Semichastnyy
was apparently reluctant to permit. him to travel beyond
Vienna. NOSENKO ‘said that he would probably have definite
information .on’ GRIBANOV's trip by the end of. the week.

: On 30°-January NOSENKO said that there appeared to be
little likelihood. that GRIBANOV would visit. Geneva or Paris.
(From. 7 -to 10. .February..1964- GRIBANOV was in Paris, where he
was''seen on the street with. a Soviet identified by NOSENKO

. as ‘a KGB counterintelligence officer.] Therefore, he wanted

to defect right away. He cited as reasons the emotional
strain of any. further: delay. and. the fact that he“and his
case officers ‘were wasting.-their time working against the
local KGB Legal. Residency, which had: no worthwhile or
“promising targets. .He also felt that nothing-of.value could
“be obtained from the Soviet delegation because ."Tsarapkitr
himself doesn't know. what. he will say until he is-told: by
.Moscow.-the day before"..° CIA handlers,:.however, delayed the
defection for one week by obtaining NOSENKO's agreement
to assist in an. audio operation: CIA proposed to install
listening devices in the offices of the KGB Legal Residency,
and NOSENKO said he would check .certain physical aspects
of the delegation buildings. As.the best time for the
defection, he suggested Saturday inorning, ‘8 February,
because he.probably would not be missed until the following

Monday. This date was tentatively scheduled, ard NnosriIKo
again repeated his desire simply to “disappear without a
trace". He also asked about exfiltration plans. :

On 31 January NOSENKO reported the results of his
reconnaissance bf the KG2 Legal Residency in connection with
the proposed audio operation, which would involve ‘microphone
transmitters operating on a carrier current. He told CIA he
had accidentally overheard in tie Residency that the building
used its own batteries and generator, and therefore the
scheme would not work. He repeated his willingness to remain
in place until the arrival of the CHERFPANOV Papers, (see
p-309) which he was told were en route from Washington. - He
explained that he had been alarmed at the previous meeting
because the delegation was supposed to move from its hotel
to a Soviet villa outside Geneva; at the villa his disappea-
rance would be noticed more quickly. This move, as he had
now learned has been postponed pending the arrival of a
housekeeping officer from Moscow.

At NOSENKO's request on 1 February, it was firmly
agreed that the defection would take place on the morning of
8 February. NOSENKO assumed that exfiltration would Le by
automobile to West Germany and thence by plane to the United
States, and his case officers confirmed his assumption.

On 3 February NOSENKO reviewed the CHERFPANOV materials.
The defection was still scheduled for Saturday, 8 February.

NOSENKO: telephoned the Geneva safehouse from his hotel
room in the early afternoon of 4 February and said: "I want
to come now and not go back." After arriving at the CIA
safehouse he explained that when he dropped by the KGB Legal
Residency following the morning session of the Disarmament
Conférence, he read a-cabile ordering him to return to Moscow
immediately to prepare for a KGE conference on foreian tourism
in the Soviet Union. The residency was arranging for a
ticket for NOSENKO to fly to Moscow via Paris: the following
day and a replacement was being readied to assume NOSENKO'S
duties as security officer for the Soviet delegation in
Geneva. Before he had left for Geneva.in January, NOSENKO
then related, the Soviet Government had Leen deliberating
the question of expanding foreign tourism in the USSR and had

(see p.319) included brief reference to thirteen other KGB
Operations conducted against what NOSENKO described as
tourists during the 1962-1963 period. For reasons cited

tourist operations, and, specifically, awareness of all
significant KGB operations against American tourists.

Information Furnished the KGB by George BLAKE

The KGB agent’ in MI-6, George BLAKE, in 1959 furnished
the KGB with a documentary account of the joint CIA-MI-6
meeting in June of that year, (see p.148) and he was to
furnish other information by which the KGB could keep
current on such hostile operations. Another CIA-MI-6 meeting
was held in Washington in April 1960, of which a twenty~one
page summary was made. BLAKE also passed this document as
soon as it came-into his’ possession to the KGB.

KGB Study of American Intelligence Tourist Operations
AGB Study of American Intelliges Op

The lengthy 1961 KGB Top Secret study referred to earlier
(see p.149) reflects the detailed and accurate information
in possession of the KGB during the period of NOSENKO's
alleged service in the Seventh Department in 1962-1963.
Pertinent portions are quoted--as follows:

"It has been established that the Intelligence
organs of the. USA are displaying special activity
in the utilization of legal channels, specifically,
in tourism, for the purpose of conducting subversive
work against the USSR. Numerous facts indicate that
American tourists and members of various US delega-
tions, in the USSR strive to visit areas and instal-
lations to which employees of the Embassy and mili-
tary attaches have no access, establish oontact with
Soviet citizens, and collect intelligence informa-
tion. In this regard, the channels of tourism to
the USSR are used to dispatch experienced intelligence
agents to develop individual Soviet citizens with
the objective of their eventual recruitment. In
line with the preparation and dispatch of such
agents, among the tourists the Americans also make
extensive use of persons not directly connected
with American Intelligence organs. These latter
agents are given one-time assignments such as
collecting information leading to the ideological
development of Soviet citizens.

of his social status or his personal access to important
information, is of interest, because of his ability to
travel to regions of the USSR which are of interest to
American Intelligence.

“American Intelligence tourist agents suspect as KGB
agents Soviet citizens who too openly express anti-
government sentiments, who volunteer information about
friends or relatives who work in secret establishments,
who accept an invitation for a clandestine meeting but
display an awareness of security principles, who quickly
request aid or assistance in defecting, or who have a

“to utilize all its resources to expose among American
tourists persons suspected of belonging to the enemy in-

Legal Residency

: “to inform*KGB Headquarters of foreigners temporarily

the Legal Résidency should intensify its work against local

Among American Tourists: Summary

BLAKE's confession and evidence obtained from internal
KGB documents establish the KGB concern for the threat of
American tourist agent operations and the scope of KGB
actions to thwart that threat. The effect of NOSENKO's
statements is that the KGB did not know of the American
tourist agent program. He averred that the Operations he
described accurately depicted the nature of KGB counter-
intelligence operations during the period.

CHAPTER IX

OTHER ASPECTS OF NOSE!KO'S KGB SERVICE

Most of NOSENKO's assertions can be examined in a chrono-
logical fashion, as has been done in the proceding sections.
Some can most easily be examined separately, since they
relate not to any particular period of his KGB service nor
to any specific position he claimed he occupied, but to his
entire KGB career. The principal aspects in this category
of claims are those he made about his relationship with
Second Chief Directorate General GRIBANOV, his Party status,
his knowledge of certain KGB forms and procedures, his
sourcing of KGB operations, awards he earned for KGB service,
and his KGB rank.

Relationship with General GRIBANOV

From his first meeting with CIA in 1962, NOSENKO main-
tained that he had a close personal and professional rela-
tionship with Major General GRIBANOV, Chief of the Second
Chief Directorate. NOSENKO described recruitment approaches
in which he and GRIBANOV took part together, conversations
they had on operational matters, the role which GRIBANOV
played in his promotions, awards and assignments, and their
after hours carrousing. According to NOSENKO, GRIBANOV was
wholly responsible, against NOSEINKO's wishes, for his
appointment to the position of Deputy Chief of the American
Department Embassy Section in 1960, and when NOSENKO later
rejected GRIBANOV's offer to make him Chief of the entire
American Department, it was GRIBANOV who arranged his return
to the Seventh Department as Chief of the American-British
Commonwealth Section and who shortly thereafter appointed
him a Deputy Chief and thereafter First Deputy Chief of the
Seventh Department.

NOSENKO's contradictions and retractions with respect to
his claimed relationship with GRIBANOV discredit his single
and most important unretracted claim, that NOSENKO, on
GRIBANOV's appointment was Deputy Chief of the Seventh

consistent with NOSENKO's ‘account of his KGB career,

NOSENKO said his formal ‘participation in Communist Party

in the Naval RU, and when he "transferred" to the KGB in:
spring 1953, he transferred routinely to: the KGB Komsomol

Comment: The Komsomol membership elects only the

NOSENKO cannot describe the duties of a Komsomol secre-
tary in any specific manner. He does not know who was the
secretary of the KGB Komsomol organization, nor could he
describe his dealings with that official's office.

Comment: The secretary of the Second Chief Directorate

to the KGB Komsomol secretary and would have

occasion to deal with the latter frequently.

NOSENKO stated that he did not know whether there was a

rh Second Chief Directorate, but that the Congresses were
aa ordinarily held yearly.

| work by every Komsomol member and especially
by the unit secretaries.

a As Komsomol secretary, NOSENKO collected the dues of the

Comment: NOSENKO is the only Soviet official known to
CIA who claims to fave occupied a position of
trust and who claims he was not a Party member
at the time.

In the period following, "to show his eagerness" and’ "to
improve himself", NOSENKO asked for Party assignments. For
more than a year he ran errands and collected newspapers and
performed other such tasks. He stated that he applied for
Party membership in January 1956, was accepted as a candidate
member. in 1956, and that he was accepted as a full Party
member in 1957.

Conclusion

NOSENKO's claims about his Party activity do not ‘sustain
his claims to KGB service, and they suffer from identical
discrepancies with respect to chronology, plausibility,
and contradiction by independent sources. It is concluded
that NOSENKO was never a Komsomol secretary and, if a member
at all, was no longer a member after reaching his twenty-
sixth birthday in October 1953. The period in which he had
no Party status was twenty-eight months, not the fifteen he
claimed, and it covers the period of his first tour in the
Embassy Section as well as a portion of his initial Seventh
Department assignment. An officer unqualified for Party
membership is ineligible: for ‘KGB service. Consequently, the
evidence provided by examination of NOSENKO's Party status
indicates that he was not serving in the KGB through at
least a portion of the 1953-1956 period.

KGB personnel files.

NOSENKO was unfamiliar with the name of the KGB personnel

its content.

Comment: A senior KGB officer would be familiar with the

NOSENKO was familiar with the Employment and Service
Record (Posluzhnoy Spisok), but he claimed he filled it out
only in "1958 or. 1957".

Comment: The Employment and Service Record is completed
on entry on duty with the KGB. In citing 1957

it only four or five years after entering the

Conclusion

NOSENKO's ignorance of the foregoing forms and procedures
is evidence that he did not occupy the position nor perform
the functions he claimed during his alleged KGB service.

Awards and Decorations

Since 1964 NOSENKO has claimed to have received various
awards, commendations, and decorations for his KGB service.
His assertions are material to any judgment of his general
credibility and, as well of the validity of his claims to
having occupied various KGB positions.

In January 1964 NOSENKO mentionea that in 1962, shortly
after meeting with CIA in Geneva, he received the Order of
Lenin for ideas which he developed to “enlarge the experience
and improve the quality" of Second Chief Directorate per-
sonnel in Moscow.

In the April 1964 interrogations NOSENKO was asked about
his awards, and he first said he received the Order of the
Red Banner,.then corrected himself to say he received first
the Order of the Red Star. He confirmed that he received
the Order of Lenin, in 1963. [Earlier he had said 1962,
“just. following visiting Geneva".] He ciadimed he received
the Order of Lenin for his performance in his Seventh
Department assignment, but when he was asked what recruit-
ments justified his receipt of the award, he said the main
task of the Seventh Department was not to make recruitments,
but to counter the hostile intelligence service operations.
(For his contradictory statements regarding the Seventh
Department's mission, see pages i03 and 326.] The Order
of Lenin was the highest decoration for which a KGB officer
is eligible, NOSENKO said, and besides himself, the Chief
and former Chief of the Seventh Department received it.
NOSENKO said he received in 1962 the Order of the Red Star,
he "thought" for his service in the Embassy Section in 1960-
1961, not for Seventh Department service; no explanation
accompanied that decoration.

The *question of NOSENKO's awards, orders and decorations
were of,some interest to the interrogators since. they might .
reflect the importance. the KGB attached to. particular i:
‘operational activities in which NOSENKO engaged. However,
before the April 1964 interrogations were suspended, NOSENKO
retracted his claim. that he received the Order of Lenin,
saying that it was just an idle boast. GRIBANOV; NOSENKO

_ explained, had promised in .1963 that NOSENKO, CHELNOKOV,

and KOVALENKO would receive the. Order of Lenin "for creating
the Central Operational Communications System of the Second
Chief Directorate" within-the Seventh Department, but the
award. had not materialized before NOSENKO left for Geneva in
January 1964, saiazniat :

Comment: - Earlier NOSENKO.claimed he received the Order
> for ideas he developed "to enlarge the experi-
ence. and improve the quality of Second Chiéf
/Directorate personnel". Questioned, NOSENKO
reverted to the earlier claim.

Inithe April 1964 interrogations NOSENKO was asked to:

‘list the dates, reasons,. and types of awards, decorations,

and bonuses he had received*in his KGB career. He replied
that he received .nothing: from 1953 until 1956, when he
received.a- commendation and one month's pay for the recruit-.
feoxcit see p-115]. by order of the KGB Chairman Serov.
GRIBANOV_infdérmed him of the commendation, NOSENKO said, and
NOSENKO:saw his name onthe list of recipients which was
circulated. ‘No written certificate accompanied the commen-
dation, according to NOSENKO, but personnel recorded the
event in'each KGB. recipient's. personnel file.. Almost every
year.after 1956,.NOSENKO ‘stated, he received something, |
“perhaps -on. the KGB anniversary, or May Day, or Army Day".

Comment: A week later, NOSENKO said that he received this
award in December 1962. He said he recalled
that the presentation was Planned for the KGB
Anniversary on 20 December, but the presentation
was delayed and not made until the end of the
month.

In 1962, NOSENKO claimed, he received another :commendation
from GRIBANOV for “general good work", and he also received
the Unblemished Service Award for ten years' service,

Comment: At this juncture his interrogators reminded
NOSENKO that his most recently claimed date
of entry to the KGB was March 1953, and that
in 1962 he would only have had nine years'
service. NOSENKO said that he could not under-
stand why, but he was certain he recéived the
service award after his return from Geneva in
1962.: (The date is consistent with NOSENKO's
earlier retracted claim that he entered the
KGB in 1952.) The following day NOSENKO
announced that he recalled why he received the
medal in 1962 rather than in 1963; the medal
was awarded to servicemen as well as to KGB
officers, and prior military service is taken
into account in computing KGB officers' time

Conclusion

NOSENKO's claims to having been the recipient of various
awards for KGB service are inextricably linked with his
claimed operational successes, his rank, and GRIBANOV's
patronage, on all of which topics he had made virtually
categoric retractions.

NOSENKO's Sourcing

E)

NOSENKO cited four general sources for KGB operations he
has related, and in all four there have been inconsistencies,
contradictions, and retractions. Three of these categories,
each with an example typifying the difficulty of judging the
validity of his sourcing, are personal participation Weg.

06 sounson Pp. 268) cases learned in the course of specific
Obofficial duties GHUBIN), Pp- 296), and information obtained
informally from KGB colleagues (Sgt. Robert Lee JOHNSON,
p-24). The fourth category of sourcing relates to the

notes of KGB operations which he brought to CIA in Geneva
in 1964. :

FA

A.

Regarding the notes, NOSFNKO said he collected them at
various opportunities in order.to bring them to CIA. He
kept them in a wall safe in’ the: office which he occupied as
Deputy Chief of the Seventh Department. [In this connection,
NOSENKO admitted that not all offices had such wall safes,
and not all offices of Deputy Chiefs of Departments, but
asserted that his did.] Most of the notes are in NOSENKO's
handwriting. Those that are not include the only copy of a
typed top secret. summary report’ from one*of the’ Seventh
Department section chiefs, a similar handwritten report by
another Seventh Department officer, and a carbon co of a
KGB document which summarized the recruitment of an[ Austrian tt
businessman. NOSENKO said he- copied the date for the
remaining notes from such sources as- the: "Special File",
which was held ordinarily by the Seventh Department Chief.

NOSENKO's’ KGB Rank —

When. he first: met with CIA in Geneva in 1962, NOSENKO
identified himself as.a KGB officer holding the rank of
major,.He said at that time that he ‘had served ‘the requisite. :

“time -in’ grade and expected to be promoted shortly to the _*'
rank of ‘lieutenant colonel. On defecting in 1964 .NOSENKO”
said that he was’ a. lieutenant colonel. In thé. course of his

(OTHER ASPECTS OF NOSENKO'S KGB CAREER)

In June 1962 NOSENKO volunteered that he was then a major,
but that he would soon be promoted to lieutenant colonel.

In 1964, in Frankfurt awaiting transportation to the
United States, NOSENKO reviewed and approved a biographic
statement which included the claim that he had been a senior
lieutenant in the American Embassy Section from 1952 (sic)
until 1955, that he was Promoted to captain in 1956, to major
in 1959, and to lieutenant colonel in November 1963.

In the April 1964 interrogations NOSENKO claimed that
at the end of 1953 or the beginning of 1954 [not in 1952]
he was promoted to the rank of senior lieutenant. When it
was pointed out to him that that was less than a year after
he entered the KGB, he asserted that his Naval RU service
was taken into consideration.

Asked in June 1964 to list his promotions, chronologically,
NOSENKO asserted that he became a senior lieutenant in 1953,
in 1956 a captain, in 1959 a major and, in October [in
Geneva, just afterwards, he said November] 1963, he.was
advised by Personnel that he had been promoted to lieutenant
colonel and afterwards was personally congratulated by
General GRIBANOV. NOSENKO did not recall the month of his
earlier promotions.

Comment: KGB defectors have commented that it would be
: unusual for a KGB officer not to recall. his
date of rank, from which he computes. his
seniority and time in grade towards his next
promotion.

In January 1965, while discussing his role as case officer
for Embassy Security Officer John ABIDIAN, NOSENKO volun-
teered out of context that he had never been a major nor was
he promoted to captain in 1956, as he had claimed earlier.

He explained that he became eligible for captain in 1956,
but his promotion was withheld as punishment because he had
obtained treatment for a venereal disease under an alias,

(OTHER ASPECTS OF NOSENKO'S KGB CAREER)

NOSENKO said in October 1966 interrogations that he had
lied when he had claimed in 1964 to be a lieutenant colonel,
that actually he had been but a captain. Asked why he had
claimed in 1962 that he had been a major, NOSENKO denied
that he had ever even mentioned his rank to CIA in 1962.

Conclusion

NOSENKO has stated that he became a senior lieutenant in
the KGB in 1952, April 1953, 1954, or, 1956. He was promoted
to the rank of captain in 1956 or September/October/December
1959; a major in December 1958 or 1959; and a lieutenant
colonel in October/November 1963. He brought to Geneva in
1964, an official KGB document dated“November 1963 identifying
him as a KGB lieutenant colonel. In retracting his claim
that he was ever a major or lieutenant colonel, NOSENKO
asserts that nevertheless as a captain, he held the position
of First Deputy Chief of the. Seventh Department.

NOSENKO's contradictions and retractions with respect to
his KGB rank parallel and are apparently related to his
contradicted and retracted.claims regarding Naval RU

‘service, date of entry to the KGB, KGB assignments. and

positions held, and in short, to the totality of his claims
regarding KGB service, few of which are credible.

Because ‘of the incidence of deranged persons CIA has

in’ the United States he has been under psychiatric observa-

(PSYCHOLOGICAL AND PSYCHIATRIC ASSESSMENT)

Psychiatric Examination

Since April 1964 NOSENKO has been under the observation
of the CIA psychiatrist. Besides monitoring many of the
interrogation sessions, the psychiatrist has visited NOSENKO
weekly for the first year, monthly until 1967, and at some-
what less frequent intervals since,

Findings
NOSENKO is neither psychotic nor neurotic. Of above

average intelligence, he is shrewd, perceptive, and highly
adaptable. His memory is not defective. Besides suffering
from ordinary lapses of memory, however, he sometimes
falsely. claims lack of recall, NOSENKO's thought processes
are unimpaired; he is rational and fully capable of distin-
guishing fact from fiction.

PSYCHOLOGICAL AND PSYCHIATRIC ASSESSMENT: Conclusion

The findings of the psychologist and psychiatrist dispel
the notion that NOSENKO's behavior and his statements are
other than willful.

SUMMARY OF CONCLUSIONS
CONCERNING NOSENKO'S BONA FIDES

NOSENKO claims. that he served for a decade in the KGB in
successively senior positions of authority from which he
derived extensive knowledge of the scope, character, and
results of KGB,operations against Americans in the Soviet
Union in the period. 1953-1963. To substantiate his claim,
he: provides an impressive array of information about KGB
personnel,. organization and operations which, to the extent
that it has been confirmed, is presumptive evidence of ‘his
bona fides. Various Soviet officials, including .intelli-

‘gence officers, have generally corroborated NOSENKO's
> claims x z st z g wae a

The examination has compared each element.of NOSENKO"Ss
biography relevant to his claimed KGB service with known
/facts and reasonable surmise. The examination reflects
. the test. to which his accounts were put: whether his
accounts are internally coherent ‘and consistent with known.
fact, and whether he actually gained the .information he has
“from occupying the KGB positions he claims to have held.
In short, is he what he. says he.is, according to his. own
> accounts? ‘ : : :

(SUMMARY OF CONCLUSIONS) ©

This examination had led to the following findings,
arrived at independently:

-NOSENKO did not serve in the Naval RU in any of the
capacities or at the places and times he claimed.

~NOSENKO did not enter the KGB in the manner or at
the time he claimed.

“-NOSENKO did not serve in the American Embassy Section
throughout the 1953-1955 period as he claimed.

~During the period 1955-1960, he was neither a senior
case officer in, nor Deputy Chief of, the Seventh Depart-
ment American-British Commonwealth Section.

~NOSENKO was neither Deputy Chief of the American
Embassy Section nor a senior officer or supervisor in
the Section during the period 1961-1962.

“NOSENKO's claims, that in 1962 he was Chief of the
American-British Commonwealth Section and was thereafter
a Deputy Chief of the Seventh Department, are not credible,

-NOSENKO has no. valid.claim to certainty that the KGB
recruited no American Embassy personnel between 1953 and
his defection in 1964,

These findings differ somewhat with respect to degree of
probability or certitude, but they reflect the preponderance
of available evidence in each instance.

The above judgments, if correct, rebut presumptive
evidence of NOSENKO's bona fides. The contradictions in
NOSENKO's accounts of his life and KGB service are so
extensive as to make his claims asa whole unacceptable.
While truth and fact in this case frequently cannot be
established with certainty, it is evident that truth and
fact are not what NOSENKO relates. By almost any test,
virtually any of NOSENKO's above claims are impugned by
fact or probability, or contradicted or retracted in his own
statements. NOSENKO is not what he claims to be, and thus
he is not a bona fide defector.

(SUMMARY OF concLustoNs)

- Given the conclusion’ that NOSENKO is not a bona fide
defector, itis necessary to attempt to determine his. true
“ motives for contacting American Intelligence and for:
providing -the information he has given. Here, it must be
‘recognized that the evidence, largely consisting: of NOSENKO's
own assertions, does’ not permit unequivocal conclusions.
Nevertheless, “the question cannot be ignored. The character
of the’ information NOSENKO has conveyed, the. fact. that ‘some
of: his false claims have been corroborated by Soviet offi-
» + Cials,-and' the necessity to. make decisions about: NOSENKO's :.
“'future all require that at least a provisional ’judgment. be
made. =.

Of the reasonable explanations advanced for: NOSENKO's
misrepresentations, the chief ones. are that he is‘a
swindler posing asa former KGB officer for: reasons of
personal advantage; that. he suffers from a deranged person-.. -
ality.or unbalanced mind; that he has -greatly exaggerated
“his’ actual rank, status and. access in the KGB, for simply
personal reasons;: or, finally, that he is a dispatched KGB
agent. . : tet : :

The first two possibilities are easily dismissed. -That
NOSENKO is not simply..a swind&#er who falsely claims for
personal advantage. to have been a KGB'officer is evident, °
we believe, from the confirmed details of KGB organization,
personnel ‘and operations which. he has -provided and. which
could only derive from within the KGB itself.

Second, as-noted in. the text, extensive psychiatric and. \
psychological examination by qualified specialists rule out
the possibility that NOSENKO's actions and testimony are the
product.“of a deranged personality or unbalanced mind.: 2

It. is somewhat more plausible that NOSENKO is a KGB.
officer who served in ‘at; least some of the components for.
some or.all ofthe time periods that ‘he claims, but who

» greatly exaggerated his positions, rank’ and access to infor-
mation, and invented. some matters-outright, to achieve
greater status with American Intelligence.: - This explanation,
however, fails to accommodate the fact that, several KGB
officers. have asserted that NOSENKO did in: fact hold senior

positions in the KGB. Also, NOSENKO's assertions with
respect to his rank, GRIBANOV's patronage, the recall
telegram, and the like, cannot be just a product of his own
invention, since these were the subject of comment by other
sources.

the KGB. While this explanation does not reconcile all the
anomalies, none of them renders it untenable,

In the absence of further revelations by NOSENKO, or
other persuasive evidence to the contrary, CIA finds that
the evidence establishes a presumption that NOSENKO was
dispatched by the KGB, and believes that prudence requires
that he be regarded as still responsive to KGB control, and
that his information should be assessed accordingly.
