Reference is made to the memorandum l. C. Sullivan

to C. D. DeLoach dated 3/5/70; captionedi as above. At that

analysis of each situation cited in the memorandum of

Special Agent Sam J. Papich relative to grievances which CIA

might hold in connection with relations with the FBl.

Enclosed will be found an analysis of 38 items

(2 are contained in one memorandum, making a total of 37

memoranda), In substance our analysis does not show any

real reason why CIA would raise any isse in connection with

37 out of the 38 items.

The recommended action in each of

these cases would logicaily close the mutter.

In one memorandum

.

the 37th itemesses, it is recommended that a careluly worded

letter to CIA outlining policy and the basic elements of

intelligence and counterintelligence wok affecting the

United States be sent to that Agency. The purpose of this is

to protect

the Bureau by giving CIA a diance to make any

comments, if it has any, in regard to the current utilization

•pf sources and facilities affecting both CIA and the Bureau.

BACKGROUND OF CASE JK OriS MorTOS] a Hollywood motion picture

producer,

was recruited by Soviet intelligence in 1935.

1947 to 1957 he was operated as a double agent by the FBI. This

was an extremely sensitive counterintelligence operation involving

Soviet intelligence

activities in the United states in which

Morros traveled behind the Iron Curtain for meetings with his

Soviet principals.

Information obtained by borrosfrom his Soviet contacts

was disseminated to interested

including the Central

and Jacob Albam were arrested in New York on charges of conspiracy

to commit espionage against the United States.

PROBLEM WITH CIA SERIAN

On march 16, 1954, the Bureau disseminated

Information received from Boris Morros to heads of the various

intelligence agencies, including, CIA. By letter of March 27, 1954,

Lieutenant General C. P. Cabell, Acting Director of CIA,

criticized the information and, in effect, characterized it as

"fabrication or the product of a paper mill," which conclusion

Cabell stated had been applied to many similar disseminations ir

the past from apparently the same source.

By letter of April

5,

1954,

the Bureau informed CIA that it was believed that no useful

purpose would be served in making any future dissemination to

CIA of information received from this source.

On April 9, 1954, Mr. Allen Dulles,

then Director of

CIA, advised Liaison Agent Papich that he had been looking into the

matter and there was no question in his mind but that his agency

had acted sturgly in

transmitting such a letter

RE: RELATIONSHIPS WITH CIA

By letter of April 21, 1954, Mr. Dulles stated that

CIA would appreciate it if the Bureau would kindly continu

to send reports from the

source (Morros) which relat

JFK(P)(A)

to matters of foreign intelligence.

By letter of April 29, 1954,

the Director expressed the opinion that no useful purpose

would be served by disseminating to CIA information received

from the source in the future.

Nevertheless, memorandum Branigan to Belmont dated

April 28, 1954, pointed out that when and if the Bureau receives

JFK(IC) information in the Mocase, in the future of a type required

by National Security Council Directivto be furnished to ClA,

it should be carefully evaluated and a decision made at that time

as to the officials and agencies of the Government to whom it

should be disseminated.

The Director noted "OK but before anything

goes to CIA from this source I want to pass on it.

This

restriction does not apply to dissemination to other agencies. H''

Subsequent to the foregoing three disseminations were

based on information

and December, 1954, and appropriate

dissemination was made thereafter with the Director's approval.

(1) CIA feels it should have been advised much

earlier concerning those aspects of the case relating to

CIA employees.

(2) Leads were given to CIA at the same time the

case was

publicized and, therefore, CIA was handicapped.

(3) The failure to coordinate the French aspects

of the case with CIA permitted the French intelligence

agencies to play a dominant role in the European

investigation.

(4) CIA fears the Bureau had not told it all there-

was to know about the case that CIA should have known.

DISPOSAL OF PROBLEM WITH CIA

The Bureau took the position

that any

necessary investigation looking toward prosecution

in countries where Bureau had a Legal Attache would be

referred by the Legal Attache to the appropriate investigative

agency of that country.

In those countries where the Bureau

did not have a legal Attache, request for investigation would

be channelled through CIA,

Because the Zlatovskis were in

JFK(D(A)

France,

the interrogation

of the Zlatovskis was handled by

request from the legal Attache to the French: JFK(LA)

JFK() Jane Zlatovski during World War II had been with the

Office of Strategic Services and had contacts later with CIA

personnel.

Prior to decision on prosecution we did not

disseminate information regarding the (Zlatovskis]because we FK(JA)

feared

the effects of compromise from possible leaks would

endanger the life of our source.

This was particularly true

in view of CIA's expressed attitude in 1954.

Some leads had

been given to CIA over two weeks before the

arrests of the

subjects in the United States. •Leads were not given earlier

because of the fear of possible compromise. As far as

coordinating the French aspects of the case were concerned,

it is doubted that CIA could have exerted any control over

the

French investigation after the French had the information.

There was a distinct difference in this case between

intelligence information and evidence in support of prosecutive

action.

Item number two in the material submitted to the

Director by SA Sam Papich in his memorandum dated 3/5/70 states

that during the 1950's, CIA periodically complained that the

operations of our office in Mexico and specifically those

involving the operating of informants and the penetration of

the Communist Party of Mexico violated the understanding that

this office was to act only as a liaison post.

He also states

questions on our running informants

in Mexico and still being able to comply with Directives requiring

coordination of overseas clandestine counterintelligence

operations under CIA.

He states comments by CIA officials

along above lines have been casual and informal and indicate

the situation has been a potential issue rather than an actual

conflict or disagreement.

at the assnee

The essence of his remarks in this

item is that the Bureau is vulnerable to criticism by CIA

because of our operations in mexico.

Review of our files fail to reveal receipt of any

formal protest by CIA concerning these matters.

We have been

operating alongside CIA in Mexico City since 1947. In 195k,

Inspector V. P. Keay, after visiting Mexico City, reported

that CIA was not adequately investigating matters in Mexico

JFK(I)(B)

affecting the internal security of the U.S. and recommended

that after properly advising CIA, Legat, Mexico, be instructed

to undertake such investigations.

The Executive Conference

considered this problem on 4/19/51 and decided we should extend

ur coverage in mexico but should not reach any, understanding

with CIA regarding these increased activities.

• It was decided,

however,

to advise CIA in writing of this problem in Mexico

in order to fix responsibility on that Agency and such a letter

was sent on 5/1/51. A copy is attached.

BUREAU OPERATIONS IN MEXICO

SEYRET

In 10/51, almost simultaneously, our Legats in

Mexico City, Madrid, and Paris, reported instances of ClA

fieldofficials openly challenging our operations, generally

on the grounds that we were violating CIA overseas

jurisdiction.

Inspectors V. P. Keay and DeLoach personally

and forcefully brought these instances to the attention of

General Walter B. Smith, Director of CIA, in a heated exchange

on 10/24/51. Out of this meeting developed a luncheon on 11/7/51

attended by the Director, Bureau officials and General Smith,

who was accompanied by several officers of his Agency.

According to a memorandum, D. M. Ladato the Director, dated

11/7/51, CIA recognized our presence abroad and both agencies

pledged

cooperation and coordination through greater liaison

so as to prevent conflict and competition in these closely

associated operations. During the ensuing 19 years, the

Bureau continued to operate in Mexico and on occasions

moderately expanded its activities in order to meet its

needs.

During this lengthy period, there were no serious

problems with CIA, with reference to our Mexico City office.

RECOMMENDED ACTION:

None. We do not believe, in light of the facts set

forth, that CIA will make an issue of this matter.

The FBI

of course, fully realizes the difficult problems

involved in surveilling American Communists in foreign countries.

At the same time,

however, it must

be pointed out that in the present

energency each individual

Communist investigation, routine or

otherwise, should receive proper attention when the subject concerned

travels to foreign countries. As you no doubt realize, the Communist

Party, U.S.A., represents a potential force as far as espionage

and sabotage

operations are concerned.

Therefore, even minor

members of the Party could become involved in delicate operations.

As pointed out in the discussions between Mi. DeLoach and representa

tives of your agency, the travels of Comnunists fron the United

States to Mexico are

very likely to become much greater, thereby

proposing a more serious problem than is now faced.

The FBI has for some time utilized the Immigration and

Naturalization Service

Watch List as a source of information concorning

the travel of Communists. Although representing an excellent method

of ascertaining this type of information, at the same time the FBI

is not affordad any advance warning from

this source as to the return

of the Connunist. Party member to the United States.

Therefore, the

investigation of that member becones delinquent in view of the

active investigation 1s not initlated at the time of his re-entry.

It is, therefore, believed that this particular source of intormation

would

not be satisfactory in lieu of information Iron your agency

which would notify us in advance of the return to the United states

of the Communist Party member in question.

With respect to the FBI advising your agency when the

services of the Mexican Police may, be utilized in Individual cases,

this Bureau will be most happy to

advise you of those "sensitive

cases" which are considered too delicate for referral to the lexican

Police, or foreign factions. With regard to the remainder of

investigations, however, we shall defer to your judgment as to

whether you wish to utilize the Mexican Police or not.

jurisdiction of the Qifice of Special Operations in foreign

intelligence matters allows for a more over-all knowledge of the

Mexican Police than

this Bureau presently possesses. Therefore, we

suggest that you weigh the facts in each individual case and consider

whether the Mexican Police should be called in or not.

Concorning the ranking Importance of cases, it is the

opinion of this Bureau that the facts provided your agency in each

RELATIONSHIPS WITH CIA

THE ABEL CASE

Item #3 in the material submitted to the Director by

SA Sam Papich in his memorandum of March 5, 1970, discusses the

Abel case.

According to Papich, CIA felt it was not given proper

recognition for its contribution in the case, in that it took the

risk and responsibility of transporting Hayhanen from Paris to the

U. S. in 1957 after the Bureau declined to become involved in this

transportation; that after a short handling period in the U. S. the

I Hayhanen, an alcoholic, because he became a problem

and CIA took the responsibility of safeguarding him, giving the

Bureau free access to him and time to develop leads leading to the

apprehension of Abel; that CIA vas responsible for making Hayhanen

mentally and physically capable to testify at the Abel trial; also,

CIA incurred heavy expenses, all for the benefit of the Bureau;

further, the Bureau never thanked ClA for its cooperation nor did It

see fit

to inform the Attorney General or the White House of the

role played by CIA.

BACKGROUND OF THE SITUATION:

Abel is the Soviet intelligence officer who was uncovered

in the U. S. in 1957 through the defection of Reino Hayhanen,

Abel's assistant®

On the night of May

7, 1957, James Angleton of CIA advised

Mr. Belmont that Hayhanen had

walked into the American Embassy in

Paris about three days ago and was referred to fIA. He claimed he

was a Soviet agent in New York since 1952 and gave certain details

to back up his

story. He claimed he was ordered back to Moscow

got "cold feet" in Paris and wanted to cooperate with American

officials.

He was in a highly emotional state which led CIA to

question his mental stability. It was the opinion of Mr. Belmont

that no steps should be taken to return Hayhanen to the U. s. until

the story was substantiated or demolished to reflect his actual

status.

Our New York Office inmediately instituted investigation,

based on Hayhänen's disclosures

and was not able to prove or

disprove his story. On May 3, 1957, CIA was informed of the

facts developed by our investigation and asked what action it

intended to take regarding Hayhanen's return to the U.s.

May 9, 1957, Angleton advised of a report received from ClA,

Paris,

revealing that Hayhanen had suffered almost a complete mental

breakdown and that in view of his condition,

arrangements were

made by CIA for him to be returned to the U.S. by plane.

May 10, 1957, Hayhanen was returned to the U.s, in the company of

a CIA agent.

On arrival our New York Agents were at the airport

to take him over, but because of his emotional state, he was

confined at the U.S. Marine Hospital in Staten Island until

Ilay 15,

1957, when he was released to the custody of our Agents.

conferred with an INS

official who had stated that if Hayhanen's

condition warranted confinement upon his arrival in the U.S.,

an order would have to be issued by the U.S. Public Health

Service).

Hayhanen and his wife were placed in a midtown hotel

by New York Agents and were under bureau control from May 15, 1957,

until June 20, 1957, when they were taken to their residence

Peekskill, New York,.

at their request. All expenses for their

maintenance vere paid by the Bureau.

During this period Hayhanen

and his wife were becoming a problem because of heavy drinking

and irrational behavior.

on June 1o,

1957, Abel was located by Bureau Agents when

visiting his studio in Brooklyn, New YOrk,

Efforts by Bureau

Agents and the Department to have Hayhanen testify against Abel in a

criminal prosecution were unavailing.

With the Department's

concurrence, we arranged for INS authorities to arrest Abel on

took the position that any efforts to induce layhanen io testify

should be made by the Department, as we realized that Hayhanen

would undoubtedly want assurances, such as remaining' in this

country and financial assistance,

and the Department was so

advised.

The Department was

also advised that the Bureau

would no longer pay Hayhanen's subsistence and that other

arrangements would have to be made. In an effort to solicit

Dulles of CIA to determine if CIA would be willing to sponsor

the entry of Hayhanen into the U.S. under the authority grantedi

On July 21, 1957 a CIA representative was placed

Subsequently, Hayhanen agreed to testify and appeared

he was taken into custody by INS on June 21, 1957. On July 21,

DECLASSIFIDD BYSP-LALI 11G

ON 1-10-01

Item No. 4 in the material submitted to the Director

by SA Sam Papich in his memorandum dated 3/5/70 discusses

belief by CIA officials that damaging publicity regarding

William P. Bundy emanated from a Bureau report. Bundy

was a CIA official at the time and the publicity was felt to

be damaging to CIA. CIA apparently was of the belief that

the Bureau leaked the information to Senator Joseph McCarthy

who then released the information to the press.

Bureau files reveal that in a discussion between

SA Papich and Allen W. Dulles, then head of CIA, on 7/10/53

Dulles inquired of Papich as

to where McCarthy could get infor-

mation such as that released concerning Bundy. Papich

immediately informed Dulles that if Dulles was under any

suspicion that the Bureau might be disseminating such infor-

mation to Senator McCarthy he was definitely wrong and off base.

Papich also told Dulles that the results of the Bureau

investigation concerning Bundy had also been made available

to the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) as well as other

interested agencies. Dulles told Papich that he definitely

did not feel that the Bureau was involved in the McCarthy

releases to the press and that he was sorry if there had been

an impression he suspected the Bureau.

There is nothing in Bureau files concerning Bundy

which would indicate that the Bureau did, in fact, supply any

information concerning Bundy to Senator McCarthy or the news

media. There was considerable publicity concerning Bundy

at the time and it is noted that due to the fact that Bundy

was the son-in-law of former Secretary of State Dean Acheson

there was possibly an element of potential embarrassment to

matter by Republican Senator McCarthy. It is also noted

that copies of reports of Bureau investigation concerning

Bundy had been disseminated, in addition to CIA, to Civil

Commission, Army and the Attorney General.

publicly quoted from a document, not identified, which spelled

out Bundy's contribution to the Alger Hiss fund. The files

BUREAU DISSEMINATION OF INFORMATION

#MORIG

CONCERNING JAY LOVESTONE

DECIASSIFIED BYSPEAR

0x 1-10-07

Item number five in the material submitted to the Director by

SA Sam Papich with his memorandum 3/5/70 discusses a question raised by

former CIA Director Allen Dulles concerning the propriety of FBI

dissemination of information concerning Jay Lovestone, who in the late

1920's headed the U. S. Communist Party, thereafter became completely

disillusioned with the Party, and subsequently occupied an executive position

with American Federation of Labor.

The particular information referred to by Mr. Dulles had been

furnished FBI by Spencer Miller, Jr., former Assistant Secretary of Labor.

Miller made several accusations against CIA. Mr. Dulles took the position

that dissemination of the allegations to the White House, Attorney General

and Department of State had placed Dulles on the spot because the Miller

data was not a complete story.

BACKGROUND:

CIA advised that on 12/4/53 Miller had informed CIA representa-

tives abroad that he had evidence pointing toward Jay Lovestone's being a

communist and active agent, and that Lovestone might shortly be exposed

by the McCarthy Subcommittee of the Senate as the chief of the third great .

Soviet ring after Alger Hiss and Harry Dexter White. When interviewed by

Bureau 1/7/54 he furnished no information indicating that Lovestone was

engaged in espionage activity and appeared to have an axe to grind insofar as

Lovestone was concerned. He acknowledged everything he?had ceme to him

secondhand. Results of interview were furnished ClA by letter.

On 1/22/54 Attorney General advised the Director that Dr. Milton

Eisenhower had told him of a conversation he had with Spencer Miller. The

Attorney General said he told Dr. Eisenhower he would have Miller inter-

viewed to get the whole story and asked that we conduct the interview.

On 1/25/54 we wrote the Attorney General about the previous

interview with Miller and advised we would have him interviewed again to

RE:

RELATIONSHIPS WITH CIA

secure any additional data he might have. Miller was reinterviewed

the same day and results were sent to Attorney General 1/27/54.

Subsequently, on 2/19/54, Governor Sherman Adams called

the Director from White House about the Miller situation.

The

Director advised Governor

Adams that he had personally talked to

Miller for two hours the

previous day and had concluded that Miller

was obsessed with the charges he was making and while he appeared

to be a brilliant and well educated man he did not appear to have

specific details.

On the day the Director spoke with Miller, 2/18/54, he

referred Miller to Domestic Intelligence Division where a detailed

interview was conducted and results incorporated in a 20-page memo-

randum, copies of which were furnished Attorney General, Governor

Adams, CIA and State Department.

We intervieved Miller at the specific instructions of the

Attorney General based upon a White House request and dissemination

of interview results to Attorney General and White House was not

only proper but required under the circumstances.

CIA and State

Department received results since allegations concerned officials

and operations of those agencies.

Miller furnished names of

persons who he said could support his allegations and we interviewed

them and disseminated results. Mr. James Angleton of CIA commented

on 3/13/54 that when the Miller information was first received at

that Agency some officials gained the impression FBI was deliberately

collecting and disseminating data solely for the purpose of "hurting"

CIA. Angleton said results of interviews and investigation conducted

by Bureau had clearly demonstrated to CIA officials that FBI was

living by its well-known tradition and reputation of developing

facts and reporting information in an impartial manner.

He said

on the previous day all officials, including Dulles, commented the

following the Lovestone case in conformity with its

well established reputation of getting all the façts. In view of

this, there is no basis for believing that at this time CIA would

raise any charges of unfair conduct on the part of Bureau in its

handling of the Miller matter.

RECOMMENDED ACTION:

None. We do not believe, in light of the facts set

forth, that CIA will make an issue of this matter.

Item six in material submitted to the Director by Sam

Papich in his memorandum 3/5/70 mentions occasions in the 1950's

when CIA complained that officials visiting the United States

under CIA sponsorship were disappointed because they had no

contact with Bureau officials.

CIA felt contact with Bureau

officials had significant benefits, left lasting favorable

impressions because of the FBI's world-wide reputation, and

when foreign visitors had no contact with Bureau officials

they were left with suspicions there was friction between the

FBI and CIA.

In 1956, we had a clear-cut policy to the effect

that tours for

such visitors would be of a restrictive nature

and they would be afforded the same treatment as the public

and nothing more.

Memorandum 5/31/56 from Mr. Roach to Mr. Belmont,

captioned

"Visit at Bureau by Foreign Police and Intelligence

Officials," (Bureau file 94-2-32781) recommended for Director's

approval that Liaison would (1) inform CIA tours afforded to

foreign police officials and security officials would continue

to be of a restricted'nature and the visitors will only view

facilities normally seen by the public, and (2) that such

foreign officials would not be interviewed unless it appeared

to the Bureau's advantage.

In regard to 1, the Director noted,

"I thoroughly agree.

I am not too keen anyway about such tours.

We were 'burned' in the Johns matter."

The Director noted in

regard to 2, "I see no need of interviews."

Doctor Otto John was an official of the West German

security service who was closely associated with CIA and who

was alleged to have defected to the East Germans.

In his memorandum, Papich emphasized that for the past

several years there was no basis for complaints with regara to

Bureau treatment of foreign officials coming to U.S. under CIA

sponsorship.

Walter Krivitsky, who operated an espionage network in Europe prior

to his defection in 1937. The Dutch representative said CIA had

interviewed her, but the results were unsatisfactoryoishe was told

to submit his request through dipsomatic channels.

In June, a CIA

representative advised SA Papich they were receiving pressure Irom

the Dutch to have a Dutch representative bring all the material

COL. JOHN GROMBACH (PAT O'BRIEN)

Background: Item number eight in the material submitted to the

Director by SA Sam Papich in his: memorandum 3/5/70 discusses

SA sam

relations between Bureau and CIA with Grombach, head of private

intelligence network (O'Brien was Grombach's aide who had liaisor

with Bureau).

Problem: Papich states we never informed CIA we were receiving

Information from Grombach which was also of interest to CIA;

and that while it is possible Grombach had given same data to

CIA, we do not know.

JFK(D(B) Analysis: Grombach was financed by CIA during early 1950s (e•%•,

CIA budgeted $650,000 for Grombach in 1952) • (62-77306-60) There

is ample evidence CIA knew we were receiving information from

Grombach. We do know some information was given by Grombach to

CIA

and Bureau jointly.

O'Brien, for example, told us of

conference in early 1951 between CIA officials and Grombach when

it was agreed information might be furnished directly to FBI by

Grombach, provided CIA was advised by Grombach of what was given.

(62-77306-23) Moreover, on 5/7/52 a CIA official requested

Bureau's views regarding validity of information we were receiving

from Grombach and

asked for our views regarding method to be

employed in channeling information from Grombach to Bureau.

Significantly, under procedure then, Grombach directed communica-

mending any method of dissemination and it was up to CIA to handle

In the ensuing period, dispute arose between CIA and

Grombach over channeling of information and Bureau made every

effort to stay out of dispute.

In late 1952, for example, Helms

inquired if Bureau's views regarding dissemination had changed.

He was told they certainly had not and again informed that Bureau's

desire was to receive all information of interest no matter how

received. (62-77306-27)

(SECKE

On the other hand, there were instances where we

received information from Grombach which was of either an

administrative or intelligence interest to CIA and we did

not inform CIA.

These instances covered period both prior

and subsequent to the contractural relationship between CIA

and Grombach which was from 4/51 to 7/54 (62-77306, unrecorded

memo 11/29/55, Belmont to Boardman re Grombach).

For example,

Grombach wrote a confidential letter dated 7/30/48 to former

Assistant to the Director D. M. Ladd which contained infor-

notation:

"This info, not to be given to CIA. per DML--OHB"

(62-77306-7) •

Memorandum 10/11/50 from A. H. Belmont to

Mr. Ladd

contains information from O'Brien concerning

Grombach's intentions to plant microphones in Finland to

cover meetings attended by Russian high staff.

It was

observed in the. memorandum that at that time O'Brien

and

Grombach had no relations-with CIA and that Grombach's

intended operation was under primary responsibility of CIA.

No indication this information given to CIA by Bureau

(65-58725-10).

O Brien furnished Bureau a memorandum dated

6/29/54 entitled "Termination Memorandum to FBI" which

informed of the termination of contract between Grombach

and CIA.

In the memorandum it is pointed out that Grombach

will continue to receive raw material from the field and

that while he will no longer be in a position to translate,

evaluate, publish, etc., Grombach desires to forward such

material

to Bureau as Grombach would not trust any other

agency. The memorandum also states that Grombach has continued

the flow to the Bureau of all reports he felt Bureau would

be interested in even though Grombach received a written

order specifically directing him to not give Bureau any

thing. (62-77306-70).

the Hoover Commission survey of CIA operations in 1954.

According

to Papich, there was talk within CIA that the Bureau had furnished

the names of subversives within CIA to Senator McCarthy.

Senator Joseph R. McCarthy (R-Wisc) was Chairman of the

Senate

Investigations Subcommittee.

General Mark Clark headed the Task Force which

surveyed CIA operations between 9/54 and 6/55. In 10/54, CIA

alleged that the McCarthy Committee was attempting to develop

He said

he would give his data relative to this matter to Clark's Task

Force.

According to the Washington Star, 1/15/55, McCarthy

said he had given Clark information relative to alleged communist

infiltration of CIA.' As of 1/17/55, CIA had not received from

Clark the names of those considered security risks but CIA

believed it had done a good job of removing security risks and

believed that it was in good shape.

On 1/21/55, the Task Force requested name checks on

security risks named

by McCarthy.

Memoranda containing the

results of those checks were given to the Task Force on 2/8/55.

On 5/13/55, the Bureau received a letter from Clark asking for

investigations relative to character, reputation, and loyalty

of individuals mentioned as security risks. CIA

was aware of

the names as me asked it for identifying data concerning them.

Clark was later advised that

the investigations would entail

interviews at CIA, review of its programs, inquiries in foreign

countries, and the like and he withdrew his request.

The observations of Special Agent Papich in this

Item number (13) in the material submitted to the

Director by SA Sam Papich in his memorandum 3/5/70 discusses

a problem presented by the Phoenix Office in June, 1957;

concerning the

Mexican border Bureau's handling of informants on

These informants were operated inside Nexico.

The problem was predicated on situations which might arise

the result of CIA endeavoring to develop informants who were

already being handled by the Bureau.

BACKGROUND:

The Director initiated BOCOV in 1948 to fill a void

in the lack of coverage in the 25-mile zone south of the U.s.-

Mexican border on the part of CIA and Immigration and Natural-

ization Service (INS).

The program, which at first involved

3 and subsequently 5 of our border offices including Phoenix,

was designed to detect and neutralize anti-U.S. activities by

subversives in that zone.

JFK (i)(B)

In June, 1956, CIA assigned a representative to the

American Consulate, Nogales, Sonora, Mexico, which is in the

border zone then covered by

Phoenix.

PROBLEM:

By airtel 6/8/57, Phoenix advised that the CIA

representative had endeavored to develop 3 Bureau sources in

Mexico and stated that it was discontinuing these sources unless

advised to the contrary by the Bureau.

SOLUTION:

This situation was analyzed in Bureau memorandum dated

CIA REQUEST FOR BUREAU LECTURE

itia tie at to 1665584-48

ON COMMUNISM IN THE U. S.

Item Number 15 in the material submitted to the Director

by SA San Papich in his memorandum 3/5/70 discusses the Director's

refusal of a 1958 CIA request for Mr. W. C. Sullivan to lecture

on communism before a CIA group. Papich stated that CIA accepted

this as an affront and a blatant refusal to cooperate on a most

important subject of interest to both agencies.

The files disclose that by letter 9/25/58 signed by

James Angleton, CIA requested Mr. Sullivan to address a selected

group of CIA personnel on the communist movement in the U. S.

CIA suggested dates of 12/9,10,or 11/58.

The Director by routing

slip attached to Angleton's letter commented, "It seems strange

that CIA should seek this when its top representative in Japan

considers FBI as a bunch of mere 'flat-feet' and the dangers

of communism as something conjured up in the minds of the r'BI.

But then again I note request doesn't come from the Director.

nor even the Deputy Director of CIA."

Memorandum W. C. Sullivan to A. Belmont dated 10/1/58

made reference to CIA's request ard the Director's comments. It

recommended that the best interests of the Bureau would be served

by giving this lecture, not because of the information which

could be conveyed to CIA on communism in the U. S., but because

it would give Sullivan an opportunity to raise a number of

questions himself of the group concerning CIA's own activities

It was pointed out that it could be

considered a bit of a challenge to see how much the FBI could

learn about the operation of CIA during the course of the lecture

and discussion rather than the converse. •Mi. Tolson recommended

that the request be declined and the Director concurred commenting,

"We cannot make Sullivan available to this outfit."

CASE OF EDWARD ELLIS SMITH] JFK (1)(8)

Item Number 16 in the material submitted to the Director

by Special Agent (SA) Sam Papich in his memorandum 3/5/70 discusses

the case of Edward Ellis Smith, that CIA

might criticize our not

identifying our source.

JFK(I)(B)

JFK(I)(B)

BACKGROUND OF CASE

Smith was the CIA employee assigned to

the American Embassy, Moscow, in 1956, under State Department cover.

He became involved with a Russian girl, and the Committee for

State Security (KGB) approached him for recruitment, using the

affair with the girl and

compromising photographs as leverage to

carry out the approach. (Smithreported the approach to his

JFK(I(B)

superiors and was returned to U. S. and ultimately removed from

CIA.

JFK(I)(B)

PROBLEM WITH CIA

We first learned of this case on 7/9/56

from David Teeple, a consultant to Scott McLeod of State

department,. Who, turnished the intormation in confidence and who

indicated Smith might have been involved in espionage.

7/16/56 Robert Bannerman, Office of Security, CIA, advised

SA Papich that CIA was considering requesting in writing that

by Director of Security, CIA, that Allen Dulles had instructed

that the request not be

made.

DISPOSAL OF PROBLEM WITH CIA

This problem never officially

arose in view of the instructions of Mr. Dulles. Bureau files

contain no indication as to whether or not CIA documented this.

RECOMMENDED ACTION:

None. We do not believe, in light of the facts set

forth, that CIA will make an issue of this matter.

RELATIONSHIPS WITH CIA - TRAVEL OF

BUREAU INFORMANTS TO CUBA

Item Number 19 in the material submitted to the

Director by SA Sam Papich in his memorandum 3/5/70 discusses

the possible travel of one of our Mexican border informants

to Cuba and whether our not advising CIA of this made us

potentially vulnerable to charges we were operating outside

the U.S. without coordinating

with CIA.

BACKGROUND:

This involved our plans to send a Border Coverage

Program (BOCOV) informant to a guerrilla training camp in

Cuba.

The trip never materialized.

In October, 1965,

we were vitally interested

in

determining the location and extent of Cuban guerrilla training

sites being used

to prepare Latin American subversives to carry

out revolutions in their home countries.

EP 572-S, a Mexican

national residing in Juarez, Mexico, which is within the area

covered by the BOCOV Program, had infiltrated Cuban and Chinese

intelligence operations in Mexico City and had made himself

attractive to Mexican communist leaders who were planning to

pay expenses of sending guerrilla trainees to Cuba.

CIA CONSIDERATIONS:

EP 572-S was an integral part of our top secret

BOCOV Program which is

handled on a need-to-know basis.

We

had previously obtained material from CIA showing its primary

targets inside Cuba which allowed us to fully brief the informant

as to overall U.S. Government objectives and a procedure was

established for

use in disseminating data to CIA if the trip

materialized which would fully protect our informant and not

jeopardize the BOCOV operation.

OUTCOME:

During period informant was striving to arrange the

trip to Cuba his wife became mentally ill, extremely emotional

and temporarily deserted the informant.

This strained family

relationship

caused us to order El Paso to have informant cancel

efforts to make the trip to Cuba and thus no trip was ever made.

ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS:

After EP 572-S had moved to Guadalajara, Mexico,

which is outside our BOCOV area, in November, 1966, wE

advised CIA of his past cooperation with us and interposed

no objection to his use by CIA in areas outside our

jurisdiction.

On 11/22/66 CIA stated it would consult us

should it initiate contacts with the informant.

There is

no indication that CIA did use the informant and on 6/24/68

we discontinued EP 572-S as he was of no further value to us.

RECOMMENDED ACTION:

None. We do not believe, in light of the facts set

forth, that CIA will make an issue of this matter.

Item 20 submitted to the Director by Sam Papich in his

memorandum 3/5/70 mentions the dissemination of a Bureau monograph

dated 5/5/65 and entitled "Communism in the Dominican Republic."

Special Agent (SA) Papich stated that due to the urgency of the

document Bureau did not obtain CIA clearance to include CIA

information in the monograph which was disseminated to interested

agencies, including CIA..

According to SA Papich, CIA never

made any

protest although it considered our action a violation

of the

"third agency rule."

Although the monograph referred to by SA Papich did

contain CIA data, it also set forth highly significant data

obtained by Bureau through our own informants. The CIA data

was biographical in nature and was used in the monograph to

characterize the past, including communist contacts, of key

figures in the Dominican Republic. It was taken from the 1963

CIA Biographical Handbook and CIA telegrams dating back to

• 1961,

all of which were previously disseminated to the U. S. intelligence

community by CIA. No attempt was made in the monograph to

characterize CIA data as Bureau information and, in fact,

information was attributed to "another Government agency," in.

accordance with established

procedures.

agency rule" provides that

classified information originating in a department or agency

will not be disseminated outside the receiving agency without

the permission of the originating agency. However, an exception

to this rule provides that the receiving

agency may. disseminate

such data to other members of the U.S. Intelligence

Board (USIB),

of which Bureau is a member, unless the originating agency

uses appropriate control markings limiting its data

to the

use of the receiving agency only.

The CIA data used in the

Bureau monograph had no such control markings and our monograph

was disseminated to the President, the Attorney General and

USIB members only.

In April, 1965, MEX-65 returned to Guatemala

and

by memorandum 6/7165 it was approved that contacts with him

be continued in Guatemala by our Central American road trip

Agent.

He proved to be an extremely valuable informant on

criminal matters as well as those of interest to U... security

in Guatemala. (S)

Upon MEX-65's designation as a highly placed police

official in Guatemala in 1967, we promptly advised CIA

headquarters through liaison channels of informant's identity.

We advised CIA that we had utilized MEX-65 for handling

criminal leads and that he periodically volunteered information

concerning political developments in (Guatemala. At that time,

10/6/67, it was agreed that Bureau would continue control of

informant and that after each contact with informant by our

road trip Agent, the latter would confer with Lestor Sanchez, JFK UB)

further indications of difficulty

in our handling of MEX-65 as we were assured it would in the

the excellent quality of the information obtained by MEX-65.

" This arrangemen't has worked snoothly for two and one-half years

Item (22), SOLO, in the material submitted to the

Director by Special

Agent Sam Papich in his memorandum 3/5/70

mentions that the Bureau could be vulnerable and charged with

failure to identify the source and coordinate with them on

this matter if they were to become cognizant of the high-level

foreign ramifications of this operation.

SOLo is the code word used to refer to the liaison

operation performed by our informants between the Communist

Party, USA, (CPUSA), and other communist parties of the world.

This operation basically is performed to gain

high-level intelligence concerning the Soviet Union's

financial support, domination and control of the CPUSA.

Attendant to this objective, our informants have met with and

discussed mutual problems with leaders of the various inter-

national departments within the Soviet Government.

They have

also held discussions with CP leaders fron other nations.

All information received as a result of this operation

which has foreign ramifications has been promptly disseminated

to CIA at the highest level.

It has not been considered desirable to identify our

sources in this case

in view of. the sensitivity of the case

and the physical danger to the informants.

Considerable security precautions have been carefully

built into the SOLO operation both in the field and at the

Seat of Government to insure the fullest protection to its

security and to the safety of the informants involved.

Exposure

of the identity of these sources might jeopardize the

entire

operation.

HARASSMENT OF CIA

DECTASSIPIED BY SP-2'ALM I

_1~11-01

Item #23 in the material submitted to the Director by

SA Sam Papich in his memorandum of March 5, 1970, discusses a letter

dated November 15, 1967,

from CIA which requested that the Bureau

check telephone toll calls from the home of one Robert Kenneth BrOw

ho was allegedly harassing CIA in the Miami area. Brown was JFK(C

supposedly seeking information concerning CIA's covert operations.

SA Papich states that we told CIA that we would not check the toll

calls on the basis that the information received was not sufficient

to justify investigation within the Bureau's jurisdiction. SA Papich

also states that "CIA accepted our response but there is no doubt

that the Agency characterized our position as a concrete example of

refusal to help a sister agency with a problem relating to the

security of U.s. intelligence operations."

A review of Bureau files disclosed that a memorandum,

D. J. Brennan, Jr., to Mr. W. C. Sullivan, dated November 17, 1967,

was prepared.

This memorandum encompassed the above facts and

recommended that CIA Llaison Agent advise CIA that we would not

check the toll calls as requested. This memorandum and recommendation

was prepared by SA Papich. The

Director noted "OK H."

In addition

to the above, on December 9, 1967, Brown

contacted our Miami Office and stated that he was writing a book

about CIA and offered to make the material available to the Miami

Office.

Our Miami Office was advised that this information was of

• interest to CIA headquarters and instructions were furnished that

:1I Brown did furnish Miami with the information, it would be given

to CIA. Brown did not follow through with his offer.

RECOMMENDED ACTION:

None. We do not believe, in light of the fäcts set

forth, that CIA will make an issue of this matter.

01-1-0.

Item number 24 in the material submitted to the

Director by SA Sam Papich in his memorandum dated 3/5/70

discusses the restriction of dissemination of the Current

Intelligence Analysis (CINAL) to Central Intelligence Agency

(CIA) •

Prior to 10/67, some of the Government agencies on

the distribution list for CINAL received multiple copies.

The Director of CIA was then receiving 19 copies of CINAL

as a result of requests from CIA on 3/30/62 and 10/83/62 for

additional copies to expedite reading by key CIA officials

and to facilitate rapid utilization of the information

within CIA.

The Director made a notation on the 10/4/67 CINAL:

"Please look over list of distribution. I have marked with

a dot those I question as to why they should recieve copies

and I do not think more than 1 copy should be sent anyone.

Let me have your views. H." By memorandum R. W. Smith to

W. C. Sullivan 10/6/67, it

was stated that although security

of the classified document CINA, had been maintained, it the

Director so desired, we would tell recipients that they would

recieve only one copy each in the luture.

Mr. Tolson noted

on this memorandum, "Yes.

T 10/9." Mr. Tolson also noted,

"We could never run down a leak."

The Director noted, "Send

only 1 copy & 1f any inquiry, then indicate we have had to

cut costs. H."

Since 10/67 the Director's instructions have been

followed and only one copy of CINAL has been furnished to

those, including CIA, on the CINAL distribution list.

RECOMMENDED ACTION:

None. He do not believe, in light of the facts set forth,

that CIA will make an issue of this

matter.

When Papich challenged them to cite any Bureau failure to comply

In answer to specific invitation by Papich to air any complaints

Item No. 26 in the material submitted to the Director

by SA Sam Papich in his memorandum 3-5-70 states that CIA by

letter 11-7-62 raised questions concerning the propriety of our

dissemination of information through our Legal Attache to the

(5) Greek Intelligence Service.

This concerned certain Committee

for State Security (KGB) technical equipment which was obtained

from our sensitive Soviet defector in place, Bureau code name

Fedora.

CIA letter 11-7-62 stated that a representative of

5) Greek Intelligence Service informed ClA it received alore-

mentioned information from our Legal Attache. ClA claimed

such dissemination abroad should have been coordinated with

CIA because of Director of Central Intelligence Directive (DCID)

5/2 which indicates that CIA shall be responsible for all U.S.

liaison concerning clandestine intelligence activities abroad or

involving foreign clandestine services.

CIA claimed that pursuant

above we were obligated to coordinate

with CIA prior to dissemination.

Memorandun Branigan to Sullivan 11-9-62 under Fedora

caption reviewed this situation and indicates that on 7-13 and

8-1-62 Fedora provided information concerning several types of

technical paraphernalia used by KGB.

Dissemination of above was

made to State Department, CIA and military intelligence agencies

by letter on 7-24 and 8-16-62. Information was also furnished to

Item 27 of the material submitted to the Director by

SA Sam Papich in his memorandum 3/5/70 indicates that Wise and

Ross had visited the Bureau in 1963 to gather material for a

book regarding U. S. intelligence agencies.

It was suggested

that CIA be advised

of this, and the Director noted, "I see no

reason for doing so."

Mr. Jones' memorandum to Mr. DeLoach, 8/28/63, reports

this visit

and notes that Wise had asked for data concerning

the Bureau's internal security procedures and had asked concerning

other FBI operations, making no reference to CIA, with one

exception.

He did inquire as to whether there was friction between

the two agencies and was told that we cooperated closely and

maintained daily liaison with CIA.

It was on this memorandum

that the Director said he saw no reason for informing CIA con-

cerning the visit of Wise and Ross.

We later learned that their book, "The Invisible

CIA prior to its publication. We also received such proofs

from CIA through Liaison.

Item number 28 in memorandum of 3/5/70 from SA Sam

Papich to the Director, captioned "Cases and/or Situations

Involving Conflict With CIA," states that in April, 1960,

CIA inquired if the Bureau would give any consideration to

assisting that agency toward developing coverage in Africa by

providing a Negro informant or placing a Negro in the Communist

Party, USA for the purpose of eventually using him in Africa.

His memorandum added that we told that agency the FBI had no

informants available because they were necessary for our own

operations.

He claims we took the position since we saw no

benefit to be gained by loaning an informant on a short or

long term basis.

He states that CIA could argue that as early

as 1960 it had foresight to recognize the need for additional

coverage and when it appealed to the Bureau for assistance,

we did

not cooperate.

He refers to his memorandum dated 4/7/60

concerning this matter captioned "Communist Activities in Africa."

memorandum referred to discloses that on 4/5/60

that communist organizations were rapidly increasing in strength

on the continent of Africa and that his agency found it most

difficult to establish effective penetration.

Horton noted that

in this connection it was almost impossible for a white man to.

move about Africa and establish a relationship which would enable

him to develop worthwhile sources.

He asked if the Bureau would

consider furnishing one of its

Negro informants or developing an

informant in the Communist Party, USA for eventyal use by CIA in

Africa.

Papich told Horton that

if the Bureau had a good Negro

informant, we certainly were not interested in having his future

jeopardized nor did we want to lose his production.

Papich

added that it undoubtedly would be most difficult to take a Bureau

informant, have him'travel to Africa under some cover and still

be able to satisfactorily explain such activities to his communist

colleagues without becoming a target of suspicion. Horton said

he recognized all this but asked if the Bureau would give

consideration.

SA Sam Papich in memorandum of 3/5/70, states that by Bureau

letter dated 10/23/64 we provided the

White House information

received by our Legat from U.S. Ambassador to Luxembourg wherein

the latter was critical of intelligence operations, particularly

the overstaffing of personnel.

SA Papich comments

that we do

not know if CIA became knowledgeable regarding this letter but

could construe same as relating to its operations.

Our Legat, Paris, in a letter to the Director dated

10/19/64, set forth

the results of a conversation with Ambassador

State one eate Borote ne

William R. Rivkin at Luxembourg.

The latter was assigned by the

State Department to conduct a survey of the U.S. intelligence

operations in six Luropean countries, assisted by representative:

of Defense, State Department, and Bureau of the Budget.

Rivkin

remarked that the results of

the survey were appalling,

there

being 23, 000 military personnel in the six countries engaged in

intelligence operations and numerous CIA personnel.

He described

the lack of coordination between the military and

"scandalous." He stated the Offices of the Military Attaches

were grossly overstaffed

and he was recommending drastic cuts

and that duplicate administrative services be combined with those

of the embassies.

He made no mention of specific intelligence

operations nor did he elaborate on the lack of coordination.

Rivkin commented that on his return to the U.s., he intended to

see the President personally to bring this matter forcefully to

his attention.

Rivkin's comments were incorporated in a letter to

William D. Moyers,

Special Assistant to the President, dated

10/23/64, in accordance with the Director's noted instructions.

Our files disclose

no indication that CIA cognizant of Bureau

letter.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: None.

We do not believe, in light of the

facts set forth, that CIA will make

an issue of this matter.

Item number 30 in the material submitted to the

Director by SA Sam Papich in his memorandum of March 5, 1970,

liscusses a dispute we had with CIA in May, 1963, as a result

of a communication the Bureau sent to the President's Foreign

Intelligence Advisory Board (PFIAB).

It was pointed out that

in our communication to PFIAB we attributed certain information

to McCone, then Director of CIA, concerning the matter of

increasing wire taps on diplomatic establishments.

McCone

charged that the information attributed to him was not so

because he had never made any such statement and he could

prove it.

The fact was that the information relating to

McCone had been given us by one of his subordinates who had

indicated the information originated with McCone.

McCone

maintained that we should have checked with him before going

on record that any information had originated with him.

A review of the file in this matter discloses that

In April, 1963, Mr. Belmont along with Papich had discussed

with Richard Helms and James Angleton of CIA McCone's alleged

position with the PFIAB; that he was in favor of across the

board telephone taps on diplomatic establishments. The

Bureau, of course,

wasopposed to this and advised Helms that

we would request to make our position known before the board.

At the conclusion of the meeting in April, 1963, Helms

specifically asked what he should tell McCone and Mr. Belmont

told him he should tell McCone exactly what had occurred at

the meeting; that the Bureau was opposed to across the board

wire taps and the Bureau intended to so advise PrIAB.

RECOMMENDED ACTION:'

None. We do not believe, in light of the facts set

forth, that CIA will make an issue

of

this matter.

SUBJECT RELATIONSHIPS WITH CIA

ALLEGED PENETRATIONS OF CIA

Item number 31, "alleged penetration of CIA," in the

material submitted to the Director by SA Sam Papich in his

memorandum of 3/5/70 discusses allegations made by

Anatoliy Mikhailovich Golitzyn regarding recruitment of tour

CIA employees by the Soviet Committee for State Security (KGB),

that CIA requested full investigation which we declined.

BACKGROUND OF CASE

Golitzyn, an intelligence officer of the

KGB who defected to CIA in 1961, alleged that the KGB had

penetrated CIA through an individual having the code name "Sasha."

In an effort to identify this penetration CIA provided Golitzyn

with information regarding many individuals who had worked for

CIA in Germany.

Golitzyn identified two individuals at various times

as "Sasha" and in each instance investigation "washed out" the

identification.

Golitzyn finally identified "Sasha" as one

Igor Orlov, a former employee of ClAy During the course of

extensive document reviews Golitzyn became acquainted with

backgrougd of yarious individuals who had worked in Germany at

the time orlov did. Golitzyn identified four present employees

of CIA with unknown subjects who had come to his attention while

he was active in the KGB.

PROBLEM WITH CIA

CIA wanted the Bureau to undertake full-

scale investigation of its four employees based solely on

Golitzyn's allegations.

DISPOSAL OF PROBLEM WITH CIA

By letter of February 26, 1965, CIA

was informed there appeared to be no basis at that time for a

full-scale investigation of these men by the FBI on the basis of

allegations by Golitzyn. With regard to any investigation in the

mentions Bureau letter 5/16/58 sent to the then Vice

President Nixon and containing a summary of CIA informa-

tion concerning events in Latin America relating to

Mr. Nixon's trip there during 5/58.

According to SA Papich, most of the information

quality of CIA's coverage in Latin America. Papich noted

it is not known if CIA ever became aware of the letter.

Papich stated that General Robert Cushman, currently Deputy

Director of CIA, was attached to the then Vice President

Nixon's staff.

SA Papich pointed out that CIA, if aware of

paragraph of this letter includes a statement that the

impression gained

from a review of CIA reports indicates that

CIA had some coverage reflecting there were to be troubles

concerning Mr. Nixon's Latin American travels. This letter

also stated as follows:

"It is significant that information in the indi-

vidual countries came to CIA's attention shortly before your

arrival in a particular country.

Therefore, there is a

question as to whether or not CIA had coverage in communist

organizations which would have led to the development of

information concerning communist plans days or weeks ahead of

your visit."

There is no indication in this file regarding

instructions given to prepare our letter of May 16, 1958.

The first paragraph of this letter indicates that the Director

had a discussion with Mr. Nixon on May 16, 1958, inasmuch as

the first sentence of the above letter reads as

follows:

"Apropos of our discussion today, there is set

forth information contained in Central Intelligence Agency

reports received from them on May 14, 1958."

The data set forth in our May 16, 1958, letter to

Mr. Nixon is contained in a memorandum Mr. R. R.

Mr. A. H. Belmont dated May 15, 1958, which was prepared for

of Mr. Nixon to determine if the contents of a letter from

the Director to Mr. Nixon dated May 16, 1958, regarding

Mr. Nixon's trip to South America could be leaked to the

press.

Colonel Cushman's request was set forth in memorandum

G. A. Nease to Mr. Tolson June 9, 1958, with the recommenda-

tion that Colonel Cushman be advised that if the iniormation

were to be given to the press, it would undoubtedly create a

serious problem as the FBI would then have violated CIA's

confidence since CIA was aware that SA Papich had reviewed

CIA's classified reports and, therefore, this information

should not be given to the press.

Both Mr. Tolson and the

Director agreed with the recommendation, and Colonel Cushman

was advised of our decision.

It is noted that Colonel Cushman

is identical with the individual who is now Deputy Director

of CIA.

Comments on Remarks in SA Papich Memo 3/5/70

1. That most of the information in our letter to

Mr. Nixon dated May 16, 1958, came frOm CIA and that this

letter could be interpreted as raising the question concerning

the quality of CIA's coverage in Latin America.

There is no dispute

as to the source of the informa-

tion which was summarized in our letter to Mr. Nixon, and we

clearly indicated in our letter that the source was CIA. With

regard

regard to any question being raised as to the quality of

CIA's coverage in Latin America, we merely pointed out to

Mr. Nixon something that was readily discernible to any reader

of the CIA reports - - that 15,.

that the information from CIA

popped up rather suddenly as related to the country and

Mr. Nixon's arrival.

Certainly Mr. Nixon himself, since

he

was personally involved in demonstrations directed against

him during his Latin American trip, must have been aware that

advance information from our responsible intelligence agency.

(CIA) may have been lacking.

We are not aware if CIA became knowledgeable of

our letter to Mr. Nixon dated May 16, 1958. Under ordinary

conditions, we are not aware nor do we seek to identify any CIA

personnel who might be assigned to the White House staff.

As indicated above, Colonel Cushman, who was a member of

Mr. Nixon's staff in 1958 and who is now a Deputy Director

of CIA, was aware of our 5/16/58 letter and its contents.

We have no information that CIA ever registered any type of

protest in this matter.

That CIA technically could raise a question

as to violation of the Third Agency Rule as regards our

5/16/58 letter to Mr. Nixon.

The Third Agency Rule is intended to prohibit a

Government agency from disseminating information originating

with another Government agency in the absence of specific

authority to do so, and we follow this rule unless there

are overriding reasons. With regard to our letter to

Mr. Nixon dated 5/16/58, we set forth information clearly

identified as having originated with CIA. This letter

was apparently prepared at the specific request of then

Vice President Nixon after conferring with the Director.

RECOMMENDED ACTION:

None. We do not believe, in light of the facts

set forth, that CIA will make •an issue

of this matter.

Item number 33 in the material submitted to the

Director by Special Agent (SA) Sam J. Papich in his memorandum

3/5/70 discusses Herbert Itkin as an individual who was operated

as a criminal informant by the Bureau who furnished valuable

information and who has been a key witness in the prosecution

of cases being handled by the Bureau.

Mr. Papich states that

the Bureau acquired access to Itkin through the CIA and that

although the CIA has never officially made any statements to the

Bureau, it has been bitterly disappointed

that the Bureau never

acknowledged CIA's assistance which the agency considered

extremely valuable.

Memorandum dated 2/20/63 from W. C. Sullivan to

Mr. Belmont captioned "James Hoffa" set out that James Angleton

of CIA advised SA Papich that CIA had briefed the Attorney General

concerning a source whom Mr. Angleton had used since World War II

and who subsequently has developed a close association with a

lawyer who does considerable work for the Teamsters Unions.

Angleton's source was confident that the lawyer could be developed

as a penetration which could "sink' Hoffa and all of his cohorts.

The Attorney General agreed with the CIA representatives that the

matter should be referred to the Bureau for handling.

Mr. Angleton set up the first contact! with the individual

who had the contact with the attorney

and at that time Angleton

stated that he did not want to get involved in any. investigative

aspects and wanted to step out of the matter as soon as possible.

As a result, eventual contact was made with Herbert Itkin who

developed into a very productive source. Itkin has been publicly

identified as both a source of the FBI and CIA as a result of his

testimony.

Memorandum to Mr. C. D. DeLoach

RE:

RELATIONSHIPS WITH CIA

HERBERT ITKIN

SECRET

The Bureau's success in handling Itkin can be

attributed to the know-how of the SAs of the New York

Office because Itkin is a highly emotional individual

and he had aggravated marital problems, severe pressures

from his many business associates; therefore, it took

a high degree of skill in dealing

with this

source in

order to achieve the success that we did.

While it is acknowledged that CIA put us

originally in touch with this source, it was not

believed that it is essential that we go back to CIA

and explain to them our success or to thank them for

giving us this original lead. It is also noted that

there is an obligation upon Government agencies to

cooperate in the fullest and CIA's cooperation in this

matter was in accordance with the long standing policy

among all Government agencies.

Review of Itkin's file does not reflect any

instance where CIA indicated a displeasure in the Bureau

(not acknowledging CIA's

assistance in placing us in touch

with Itkin. This is in line with Mr. Angleton's statement

in 1963 that he did not want to get involved in any

investigative aspects of this matter and wanted to step.

out as soon as possible.

In view of the above, it is not

believed that CIA would have any basis to complain that the

Bureau never acknowledged CIA's assistance.

RECOMMENDED ACTION:

None. We do not believe, in light of the facts set

forth, that CIA will make an issue of this matter.

SUBJECT: RELATIONSHIPS WITH CIA

EXCHANGE OF TECHNICAL INFORMATION

Item number 34 in the material submitted to the

Director by SA Sam Papich in his memorandum 3/5/70 concerns

exchange of technical information with CIA, particularly as

it related to the technical surveillance field. Papich states

CIA exhibited its equipment to us, but for many years we declined

to show any of our devices, with some exceptons. •He states

that CIA never made an official protest but informally indicated

from time to time that the lack of exchange was prejudicial to

overall intelligence and internal security interests and implied

we were more open with the British in this area than with CIA.

Papich states this situation does not exist today as there is

the tread and

a good exchange by the Bureau and CIA.

Our files reveal that through the years CIA has

furnished the Bureau a number of technical devices for our use

or inspection.

They have also furnished technical manuals obtained

abroad and briefed us on operational and technical aspects of

some

of their operations abroad. Laboratory personnel have been

afforded tours and briefings concerning CIA facilities and

equipment and in two instances Bureau personnel have been afforded

training at CIA schools. As recently as October, 1969, CIA

afforded a briefing to Bureau personnel concerring a Clandestine

Transmitter Activator, developed by their technical people and

offered to loan us one of these units as well as afford our

personnel training in the operation of the equipment.

COMMENTS OF THE LABORATORY

Similarly, Bureau records show substantial reciprocity

on the part of the FBI in developing and furnishing important

technical information to CIA over a period of many years..

Representative examples are cited below:

Prior to 1955 an important unsolved technical

intelligence problem involved desired access to

enemy intelligence and other security information

protected by combination-type locks (safe doors, and

the like,.

Scientists in the FBI Laboratory were

able to solve this problem by

using X-rays from

radioactive materials to "see" into the interior of

a combination lock and

thus recover the combination;

without trace of tampering or other indication that

the lock had been compromised. This was a scientific

breakthrough of tremendous intelligence potential and,

with Bureau approval, our results and techniques were

made known to the appropriate CIA representatives..

CIA advised that they had theretofore spent thousands

of dollars in an intensive, but unsuccessful effort to

solve the same problem.

The impact of this scientific

discovery in permitting access to previously unavailable

intelligence had tremendous value for both the FBI and

CIA.

In approxinately the late 50's and early 60's, both CIA

and iBl encountered a new, highly sophisticated type

of secret writing placed

into use by the russians for

communicating with espionage agents. In spite of a

massive technical effort mounted by CIA, scientists

of the FBI Laboratory were successful in first unraveling

the basic principles and techniques underlying this new

russian system.

This important breakthrough thus permitted

for the first time a successful attack against the new

Russian secret ink communication system. Because of its

extreme intelligence potential, with prior Bureau approval,

this development was made known to CIA, and its importance

to CIA is reflected in part by a letter addressed to the

Director of FBI by Allen W. Dulles, then Director of CIA,

under date of August 19, 1961, in which Dulles said, in

i August even a 2,arg

part, "For the past several years there has been

increasingly effective technical liaison between the

Technical Services Division of this Agency and correspond

ing components of your Bureau. . ."

Dulles further

commented that Bureau technical personnel had "

• made

an outstanding

technical contribution for which they are to

be highly .commended.

Their work not only has an important

impact in one sensitive area, but also has revealed a

chemical mechanism from which may well stem new high-level

secret writing systems. The discovery will have an

on the discharge of responsibilities

assigned both to this Agency and the FBI. I consider

access to these findingsto be further evidence of the

value of close technical liaison between our two

organizations..."

Subsequently, again with prior Bureau approval, whenever

it could be done without jeopardizing FBI operational

interests, the FBI on a continuing basis made available

to CIA actual Soviet secret writing chemicals and methods

of development which had come into the possession of the

Bureau through investigative activity and through high-

level informants. A recent example involved the Russian.

espionage case of Herbert William Boeckenhaupt wherein

on 2/12/69 a sample of secret writing material used by

Boeckenhaupt to communicate with the Russians was

furnished to CIA by a representative of the FBI Laboratory.

The above items are representative outstanding examples

of FBI cooperation in developing and sharing highly important

technical information, and certainly the letter from CIa reflects

the satisfaction and importance which CIA attached to such

information received

from the Bureau. Within general Bureau

policy guidelines, there were, of course, on a continuing basis

numerous other items of technical information shared with CIA

over the years, including briefings and exchange of visits.

RECOMMENDED ACTION:

None. We do not believe, in light of the facts set

forth, that CIA will make an issue of this matter.

EXCHANGE IN THE TRAINING FIELD

DICTASSTFIED BEER 2ALM 16

Items number 35 and 36 in the material submitted to the

Director by SA Sam Papich in his memorandum March 5, 1970, indicated

CIA has never understood why Bureau will not permit CIA personnel to

lecture at our schools and CIA was unhappy regarding our attitude

concerning exchange of information in the training field.

CIA by letter May 19, 1950, requested

it be permitted to

discuss training problems with

FBI training staff in view of

necessity of its maintaining relations with foreign police and

security agencies.

Following recommendations by the Executives

Conference, Bureau advised CIA by letter May 25, 1950, that we did

not believe FBI training staff could intelligently discuss training

methods with CIA since our staff was not knowledgeable concerning

conditions encountered by CIA in various foreign countries.

Since 1962, we have taken foreign police officers into the

National Academy through the Agency for International Development

(AID). These officers spent two weeks of orientation with AlD and

atter

graduation certain selective officers have been in touch with

CIA through AID. We are aware that CIA has used many of these

graduates as sources of information.

In 1966, the Director approved a request of CIA to have one

of its men

attend

the National Academy for purpose "to improve

capabilities of CIA personnel engaged in overseas police training

programs." As a result, a CIA Security Officer graduated from the

77th Session of the FBI

National Academy (March 7 - May 25, 1966).

At the specific request of CIA, Bureau representatives have

addressed CIA intelligence personnel attending refresher-type

training courses on 31 occasions between June, 1962, and December,

1969.

SYNOPSIS:

Mentioned Item by Papich points out CIA belief

that

more aggressive action should have been taken in field of

collecting positive intelligence in the United States.

Papich

notes Bureau's action in this field, for the most part, has been

restricted to compliance with requests by State Department when

political crises occur in some country.

He points out CIA belief

that acquiring needed data would mean increased technical surveil-

Iance coverage, developmenapichintormants and collection of

cryptographic material.

cites two specific cases occurring

in 1969 where Bureau declined CIA's request for technical coverage,

suggesting to Agency that it make its request directly to the :

Attorney General.

Review of

specific cases mentioned set forth

with Director's comments relative thereto being noted.

Our

policy of cooperation with CIA most recently delinated to field

RE:

RELATIONSHIPS WITH

CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY

SECRET

CIA has repeatedly raised the issue in the past of

our coverage in the positive intelligence collection area and

we can reasonably expect similar issues to be raised in the

future.

RECOMMENDED ACTION:

That we prepare a carefully worded letter to CIA

outlining policy and the basic elements of intelligence and

counterintelligence work affecting the United States and

forthrightly ask CIA if it is satisfied with the status quo

and if not what do they have to suggest as changes.

RE:

DETAILS:

SECRET

Papich points out CIA feels there is unexplored

field for acquiring positive intelligence in the United States

but he notes that there has been no law, directive, or executive

order which fixes responsibility for clandestine collection of

such information.

He notes we investigate subversives, spies,

and develop penetrations of foreign intelligence services and

that facets of these investigations of violations of United States

laws serve

to tulfill a counterintelligence objective referred

to by us as investigations of internal security matters.

notes, however, that most of our work in the positive intelligence

field

has been

restricted to the compliance with requests by

State Department prompted usually by a political crisis occurring

in some foreign country.

Papich points

out CIA feels there is unexplored

field for acquiring positive intelligence requiring use of

vastly increased technical surveillances, informant development

and collection of cryptographic material.

According to Papich,

CIA does not feel Bureau has moved aggressively in this area

and CIA has been thwarted in attempts to do much about the

problem.

Papich cites two cases Alfred S. Gonsalves, 10/69 and

(S) (Zalman Shapiro] 10/69) where CIA requests for technical surveil-

Iance were declined by us with the suggestion to ClA that these

matters should be taken up by that Agency directly with the

Attorney General.

the

Attorney General directly with his thoughts regarding the

need for additional investigation. Attorney General contacted

Bureau requesting it discuss matter with CIA and determine

advisibility of additional investigation.

prompted CIA's original request but noted he felt reinstituted

information.

He therefore requested reinstitution of this

coverage.

The Director's letter to Helms 10/17/69 noted that

after careful review it was felt that CIA should take this

matter to the Attorney General. $

On October 21, 1969, a CIA official was told by

Special Agent Papich that inthe future CIA should transmit its

requests for technical surveillance coverage in the United States

to the Attorney General.

This specifically covered the cases

of Consalves and Shapiro The Director commented "Right."

Bureau Policy of Cooperation

In 1965 and 1966, recognizing overlapping interests,

changes inherent in faster communication, hysteria to facilitate

international travel and in response to requests from CIA, the

Director approved Bureau attendance at conferences with CIA

regarding that Agency's operational activities in the United states.

On a memorandum reporting the

results of the conferences with

CIA, the Director commented "I hope we still don't let our

guard down as CIA has always outsmarted us because of our

gullibility."

SAC Letter 66-10 (B) dated 2/15/66 furnished to the

field and Bureau offiçials results of the conferences with CIA

and emphasized necessity for protecting Bureau jurisdiction in

the counterintelligence field.

This SAC letter (copy attached)

emphasized there is to be no interference with or infringement

upon our jurisdiction but clearly shows our willingness to

cooperate

with CIA in developing positive intelligence in the

United States.

In approving this SAC letter, the Director

noted "I hope

there is no sneaker' in this.

Time will tell."

There has been no renewed request from CIA for

technical coverage in the cases mentioned above, nor has there

been any indication that such requests have been sent. by CIA

to the Attorney General

as we suggested. Due to CIA interest

in the past in these matters, we cannot rule out the possibility

the Agency may approach Attorney General for the desired

coverage at some time in the future.
