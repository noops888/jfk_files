(OCASE (THE BORIS MORROS. CASE. :
Item number one in the material submitted to the
Director by Special Agent (SA) Sam Papich in his memorandum
3/5/70 discusses the case of(Boris. Morros.(Mocase) JE CIY)

seu?
BACKGROUND OF CASE (ris Morros,]) a Hollywood motion picture

producer, was recruited by Soviet intelligence in 1935, From
1947 to 1957 he was operated as a double agent by the FBI, This
was an extremely sensitive counterintelligence operation involving
Soviet intelligence activities in the United States in which
Morros traveled behind the Iron Curtain for meetings with his
Soviet principals, :

ee OE)

Information obtained by(Morrod from his Soviet contacts
was disseminated to interested agéncies, including the Central
Intelligence Agency, On January 25, 1957, Jack Soble, Myra Soble,
and Jacob Albam were arrested in New York on charges of conspiracy
to commit espionage against the United States,

AY
PROBLEM wiTs crA Gy March 16, 1954, the Bureau disseminated

information received from|Boris Morros}to heads of the various
intelligence agencies, including,CIA, By letter of March 27, 1954,
Lieutenant General C. P, Cabell, Acting Director of CIA,

criticized the information and, in effect, characterized it as.
"faprication or the product of a paper mill," which conclusion
Cabell stated had been applied to many similar disseminations in
the past from apparently the same source. By letter of April 5,
1954, the Bureau informed CIA that it was believed that no useful
purpose would be served in making any future dissemination to

- CIA of information received from this source.

On April 9, 1954, Mr. Allen Dulles, then Director of
CIA, advised Liaison Agent Papich that he had been looking into the
matter and there was no question in his mind but that his agency
had acted stupidly in transmitting such a letter to the Bureau,

By letter of April 21, 1954, Mr. Dulles stated that
CIA would appreciate it if the reau would kindly continue
to send reports from the Pe (Cee es relate JFROYAYD
to matters of foreign intelligence, By letter of April 29, 1954,
the Director expressed the opinion that no useful purpose
would be served by disseminating to CIA information received
from the source in the future,

Nevertheless, memorandum Branigan to Belmont dated

April 28, 1954, pointed t that when and if the Bureau receives
[iocase in the future of a type required

by National Security Council Directixeto be furnished to CIA,
it should be carefully evaluated and a decision made at that time
as to the officials and agencies of the Government to whom it
should be disseminated, The Director noted "OK but before anything
goes to CIA from this souree I want to pass on it. This
restriction does not apply to dissemination to other agencies. H"

Subsequent to the foregoing three disseminations were
made -to’ interested agencies, including CIA, based on information
from[Morros |during October and December, 1954, and appropriate
dissemination was made thereafter with the Director's approval.

As the time grew near for prosecutive action, the
Department requested the Bureau to check with CIA to see if
Department attorneys could interview a Soviet intelligence
defector then in custody of CIA named|Peter Derjabin. JFLQVA)
Accordingly, the Director authowized an oral briefing of Mr. Dulles

(1) CIA feels it should have been advised much
earlier concerning those aspects of the case relating to
CIA employees.

(2) Leads were given to CIA at the same time the
case was publicized and,’ therefore, CIA was handicapped.

(3) The failure to coordinate the French aspects
of the case with CIA permitted the French intelligence
agencies to play a dominant role in the Ruropean
investigation.

(4) CIA fears the Bureau had not told it all there~
was to know about the case that CIA should have known.

DISPOSAL OF PROBLEM WITH CIA The Bureau took the position

that any necessary investigation looking toward prosecution

in countries where Bureau had a Legal Attache would be

referred by the Legal Attache to the appropriate investigative
agency of that country. In those countries where the Bureau

did not have a Legal Attache, request for investigation would

be channelled through CIA, Because the Zlatovskis were in JPR)
France, the interrogation of the Zlatovskis was handled by

request from the Legal Attache to the French, JFkt)uU)

JFEOND Jane Zlatovski during World War II had been with the
Office of Strategic Services and had contacts later with CIA
personnel, Prior to decision on prosecution we did not
disseminate information regarding the (Zlatovskis|because we
feared the effects of ‘compromise from possible leaks would
endanger the life of our source. This was particularly true
in view of CIA's expressed attitude in 1954, Some leads had
been given to CIA over two weeks before the arrests of the
subjects in the United States, .Leads were not given earlier

. because of the fear of possible compromise. As far as
coordinating the French aspects of the case were fconcerned,
it is doubted that CIA could have exerted any control over the
French investigation after the French had the information.
There was a distinct difference in this case between
intelligence information and evidence in support of prosecutive
action. ee eeeeee

BUREAU OPERATIONS IN MEXICO an aera Cr
Ee ‘armen  Salanaatsreinentes

Item number two in the material submitted to the
Director by SA Sam Papich in his memorandum dated 3/5/70 states
that during the 1950's, CIA periodically complained that the
operations of our office in Mexico and specifically those
involving the operating of informants and the penetration of
the Communist Party of Mexico violated the understanding that
this office was to act only as a liaison post, He also states
CIA has informally raised questions on our running informants
in Mexico and. still being’able to comply. with Directives requiring
coordination of overseas clandestine counterintelligence
operations under CIA. He states comments by CIA officials
along above lines have been casual and informal and indicate
the situation has been a potential issue rather than an actual
conflict or disagreement, The essence of his remarks in this
item is that the Bureau is vulnerable to criticism by CIA
because of our operations in Mexico,

Review of our files fail to reveal receipt of any
formal protest by CIA concerning these matters, We have been
operating /|alongside cra fin Mexico City since 1947, In 1951,
Inspector V. P, Keay, after visiting Mexico City, reported
that CIA was not adequately investigating matters in Mexico JF«(')(8)
affecting the internal security of the U.S, and recommended
that after properly advising CIA, Legat, Mexico, be instructed
to undertake such investigations. The Executive Conference
considered this problem on 4/19/51 and decided we should extend
our coverage in Mexico but should not reach any, understanding
with CIA regarding these increased activities. ‘It was decided,
however, to advise CIA in writing of this problem in Mexico
in order to fix responsibility on that Agency and such a letter
was sent on 5/1/51, A copy is attached.

RE: RELATIONSHIPS WITH CIA
BUREAU OPERATIONS IN Mexico - SENET

In 10/51, almost simultaneously, our Legats in

lexica City, Madrid, and Paris, reported instances of CIA
FHI] Fe

ieldjofficials openly challenging our operations, generally
on the grounds that we were violating CIA overseas
jurisdiction. Inspectors V. P. Keay and DeLoach personally
and forcefully brought these instances: to the attention of
General Walter B. Smith, Director of CIA, in a heated exchange
on 10/24/51, Out of this meeting developed a luncheon on 11/7/51
attended by the Director, Bureau officials and General Smith,
who was accompanied by several officers of his Agency.
According to a memorandum, D. M. Laddto the Director, dated
11/7/51, CIA recognized our presence abroad and both agencies
pledged cooperation and coordination through greater liaison
so as to prevent conflict and competition in these closely
associated operations, During the ensuing 19 years, the
Bureau continued to operate in Mexico and on occasions
moderately expanded its activities in order to meet its
needs, During this lengthy period, there were no serious
problems with CIA, with reference to our Mexico City office.

RECOMMENDED ACTION:

None. We do not believe, in light of the facts set
forth, that CIA will make an issue of this matter.

a Deloach of the Federal eau of Investigation regarding the captioned
matter, it is understood that your representatives pointed out that
the [Mexico City station of CIA] with its limited personnel, attempted

(1) Utilization of the Immigration and Naturalization

SECRET

The FBI, of course, fully realizes the difficult problems
involved in surveilling American Communists in foreign countries,
At the same time, however, it must be pointed out that in the present
emergency each individual Communist investigation, routine or
otherwise, should receive proper attention when the subject concerned
travels to foreign countries, As you no doubt realize, the Communist
Party, U.S.A,, represents a potential force as far as espionage
and sabotage operations are: concerned. Therefore, even minor
members of the Party could become involved in delicate operations.
As pointed out in the discussions between Mr, DeLoach and representa~
tives of your agency, the travels of Communists from the United
States to Mexico are very likely to become much greater, thereby
proposing a more serious problem than is now faced,

The FBI has for some time utilized the Immigration and
Naturalization Service Watch List as a source of information concerning
the travel of Communists, Although representing an excellent method
of ascertaining this type of {nformation, at the same time the FBI
ig not afforded any advance warning from this: source as to the return
of the Communist. Party member to the United States, Therefore, the
investigation of that member becomes. delinquent in view of the fact
active investigation is not initiated at the time of his re-entry.

It is, therefore, believed that this particular source of information
would not’ be satisfactory in lieu of information from your agency
which would notify us in advance of the return to the United States
of the Communist Party memher in question.

With respect to the FBI advising your agency when the
services of the Mexican Police may,be utilized in individual cases,
this Bureau will be most-happy to advise you of those "sensitive
cases" which are considered too delicate for referral to the Mexican
Police, or foreign factions. With regard to the remainder of
investigations, however, we shall defer to your judgment as to
whether you wish to utilize the Mexican Police or not, The
jurisdiction of the Office of Special Operations in foreign
intelligence matters allows for a more over-all knowledge of the
Mexican Police than this Bureau presently possesses, Therefore, we.
suggest that you weigh the facts in each individual case and consider
whether the Mexican Police showld be called in or not. -

Concerning the ‘ranking importance of cases, it is’ the
opinion of this Bureau that the facta provided your agency in each
individual case will determine the methods of investigation you

. wish to apply. It is not, therefore, considered necessary for the

PBI to point out the importance of each matter referred to your

agency, i

I SECRET

As suggested by your representatives, we will be most
happy to hold a conference with your Mexican supervisory personnel
at any time concerning discussions. of investigations in Mexico.

It is additionally suggested, however, that you advise your field
representatives in Mexico City to contact the FBI's Legal Attache
regarding coordination of the same matters in that locality.

RELATIONSHIPS WITH CIA
THE ABEL CASE

Item #3 in the material submitted to the Director by
SA Sam Papich in his memorandum of March 5, 1970, discusses the
Abel case,

According to Papich, CIA felt it was not given proper
recognition for its contribution in the case, in that it took the
risk and responsibility of transporting Hayhanen from Paris to the
U. S. in 1957 after the Bureau declined to become involved in this
transportation; that after a short handling period in the U., S, the
Bureau dropped Hayhanen, dn alcoholic, because he became a problem
and CIA took the responsibility of safeguarding him, giving the
Bureau free access to him and time to develop leads leading to the
apprehension of Abel; that CIA was responsible for making Hayhanen
mentally and physically capable to testify at the Abel trial; also,
CIA incurred heavy expenses, all for the benefit of the Bureau;
further, the Bureau never thanked CIA for its cooperation nor did it
see fit to inform the Attorney General or the White House of the
role played by CIA.

BACKGROUND OF THE SITUATION:

Abel is the Soviet intelligence officer who was uncovered
in the U. S. in 1957 through the defection of Reino Hayhanen,
Abel's assistant.

On the night of May 7, 1957, James Angleton of CIA advised
Mr. Belmont that Hayhanen had walked into the American Embassy in
Paris about three days ago and was referred to CIA, He claimed he
was a Soviet-agent in New York since 1952 and gave certain details
to back up his story, He claimed he was ordered back to Moscow and
got "cold feet" in Paris and wanted to cooperate with American
officials, He was in a highly emotional state which led CIA to
question his mental’ stability. It was the opinion of Mr. Belmont
that no steps should be taken to return Hayhanen-to the U, S, until
the story was substantiated or demolished to reflect his actual
status. Our New York Office immediately instituted investigation,

based on Hayhanen's disclosures ahd was not able to prove or
disprove his story, On May 8, 1957, CIA was informed of the

facts developed by our investigation and asked what action it
intended to take regarding Hayhanen's return to the U.S. On

May 9, 1957, Angleton advised of a report received from CIA, Paris,
revealing that Hayhanen had suffered almost a complete mental
breakdown and that in view of his condition, arrangements were
made by CIA for him to be returned to the U.S, by plane, On

May 10, 1957, Hayhanen was returned to the U.S, in the company of
a CIA agent, On arrival our Wew York Agents were at the airport
to take him over, but because of his emotional state, he was
confined at the U.S, Marine Hospital in Staten Island until

May 15, 1957, when he was released to the custody of our Agents.
Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) authorities

arranged for his confinement in the U.S, Marine Hospital,

Staten Islam, for psychiatric examination through the U.S.

Public Healtn Service, (Liaison Agent Papich had previously
conferred with an INS official who had stated that if Hayhanen's
condition warranted confinement upon his arrival in the U.S.,

an order would have to be issued by the U.S, Public Health
Service),

Hayhanen and his wife were placed in a midtown hotel
by New York Agents and were under Bureau control from May 15, 1957,
until June 20, 1957, when they were taken to their residence in
Peekskill, New York, at their request. All expenses for their
maintenance were paid by the Bureau. During this period Hayhanen
and his wife were becoming a problem because of heavy drinking
and irrational behavior, i

On June 13, 1957, Abel was located by Bureau Agents when
visiting his studio in Brooklyn, New York, Efforts by Bureau
Agents and the Department to have Hayhanen testify against Abel in a
eviminal prosecution were unavailing. With the Department's
concurrence, we arranged for INS authorities to arrest Abel on
June 21, 1957, on an alien warrant, After Abel's arrest, the
Department continued to raise questions concerning Hayhanen's
willingness to testify in an espionage prosecution against Abel
and requested the Bureai to press Hayhanen in that regard, We
took the position that any efforts to induce Mayhanen to testify
should be made by the Department, as we realized that Hayhanen
would undoubtedly want assurances, such as remaining’in this
country and financial assistance, and the Department was so
advised, The Department was also advised that the Bureau
would no longer pay Hayhanen's subsistence and that other
arrangements would have to be made. In an effort to solicit
Hayhanen's cooperation, the Department conferred with Allen
Dulles of CIA to determine if CIA would be willing to sponsor
the entry of Hayhanen into the U.S, under the authority granted; ”
the Director of CIA by law. Dulles indicated a willingness b
not only to sponsor Hayhanen but also to asSist in his rehabilitation

in the U.8., such as assi Seu t. in obtaining a job

and furnishing financial assistance for an extended period

of time. On July 21, 1957 a CIA representative was placed

in touch with Hayhanen by New York Agents for this purposed

Our Agents also arranged for FBI's access to Hayhanen whenever neces~
sary. Subsequently, Hayhanen agreed to testify and appeared

before a Federal grand jury on August 5 and August 6, 1957,

As indicated above, we located Abei on June 13 and
he was taken into custody by INS on June 21, 1957, On July 21,
1957, over a month later, CIA instituted arrangements for
Hayhanen's rehabilitation,

While CIA undoubtedly incurred heavy expenses on
behalf of Hayhanen, it was not at the request of, the Bureau
but at the request of the Department.

Regarding CIA's ‘complaint that the Bureau never thanked
it for its cooperation, it is pointed out that a letter from :
the Birector was sent to Mr, Dulles on November 19, 1957,
shortly after Abel's conviction, It pointed out the excellent
cooperation of James Angleton and his staff with the Bureau
since the inception of this case and that the Director wished
to express his personal appreciation to Angleton and his staff
Zov their valuable assistance,

LECOMMENDED ACTION:

None, we do not believe, in light of the facts set
forth, that CIA will make an issue of, this matter.

CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY (CIA) DECLASSIFIED BY pspannlele
WILLIAM P. BUNDY CASE on_ 10-8

Item No. 4 in the material submitted to the Director
by SA Sam Papich in his memorandum dated 3/5/70 discusses
belief by CIA officials that damaging publicity regarding
William P. Bundy emanated from a Bureau report. ° Bundy
was a CIA official at the time and the publicity was felt to
be damaging to CIA. CIA apparently was of the belief that
the Bureau leaked the information to Senator Joseph McCarthy
who then released the information to the press.

Bureau files reveal that in a discussion between
SA Papich and Allen W. Dulles, then head of CIA, on 7/10/53
Dulles inquired of Papich as to where McCarthy could get infor-
mation such as that released concerning Bundy. Papich
immediately informed Dulles that if Dulles was under any
suspicion that the Bureau might be disseminating such infor-
mation to Senator McCarthy he was definitely wrong and off base,
Papich also told Dulles that the results of the Bureau
investigation concerning Bundy had also been made available _
to the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) as well as other
interested agencies, Dulles told Papich that he definitely
did not feel that the Bureau was involved in the McCarthy
releases to the press and that he was sorry if there had been
an impression he suspected the Bureau,

There is nothing in Bureau files concerning Bundy
which would indicate that the Bureau did, in fact, supply any
information concerning Bundy to Senator McCarthy or the news
media, There was considerable publicity concerning Bundy
at the time and it is noted that due to the fact that Bundy
was the son-in-law of former Secretary of State Dean Acheson

RE: RELATIONSHIP WITH THE SENRET
CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY
WILLIAM P, BUNDY CASE : :

there was possibly an element of potential embarrassment to
the Democratic Party attendant to publicity afforded the
matter by Republican Senator McCarthy. It is also noted
that copies of reports of Bureau investigation concerning
Bundy had been disseminated, in addition to CIA, to Civil
Service Commission, National Security Agency, Atomic Energy
Commission, Army and the Attorney General. A conflict broke
out between CIA and Senator Joseph McCarthy after McCarthy
publicly quoted frm a document, not identified, which’ spelled
out Bundy's contribution to the Alger Hiss fund. The files
indicate that CIA alleged that the AEC had leaked the
information in question to Senator McCarthy. :

BUREAU DISSEMINATION OF INFORMATION DEOLASSTPTID Bx 6 “|
CONCERNING JAY LOVESTONE 7 7 a ieer

Item number five in the material submitted to the Director by
SA Sam Papich with his memorandum 3/5/70 discusses a question raised by
former CIA Director Allen Dulles concerning the propriety of FBI
dissemination of information concerning Jay Lovestone, who in the late
1920's headed the U. S. Communist Party, thereafter became completely
disillusioned with the Party, and subsequently occupied an executive position
with American Federation of Labor.

The particular information referred to by Mr. Dulles had been
furnished FBI by Spencer Miller, Jr., former Assistant Secretary of Labor,
Miller made several accusations against CIA. Mr. Dulles took the position
that dissemination of the allegations to the White House, Attorney General
and Department of State had placed Dulles on the spot because the Miller
data was not a complete story.

BACKGROUND:
“CIA advised that on 12/4/53 Miller had informed CIA representa-
tives abroad that he had evidence pointing toward Jay Lovestone's being a
communist and active agent, and that Lovestone might shortly be exposed
by the McCarthy Subcommittee of the Senate as the chief of the third great
Soviet ring after Alger Hiss and Harry Dexter White. When interviewed by
' Bureau 1/7/54 he furnished no information indicating that Lovestone was

secure any additional data he might have. Miller was reinterviewed
the same day and results were sent to Attorney General 1/27/54.

Subsequently, on 2/19/54, Governor Sherman Adams called
the Director from White House about the Miller situation. The
Director advised Governor Adams that he had personally talked to
Miller for two hours the previous day and had concluded that Miller
was obsessed with the charges he was making and while he appeared
to be a brilliant and well educated man he did not appear to have
specific details.

On the day the Director spoke with Miller, 2/18/54, he
referred Miller to Domestic Intelligence Division where a detailed |
interview was conducted and results incorporated in a 20-page memo~
randum, copies of which were furnished Attorney General, Governor
Adams, CIA and State Department.

We interviewed Miller at the specific instructions of the
Attorney General based upon a White House request and dissemination
of interview results to Attorney General and White House was not
only proper but required under the circumstances. CIA and State
Department received results since allegations concerned officials
and operations of those agencies. Miller furnished names of
persons who he said could support his allegations and we interviewed
them and disseminated results. Mr. James Angleton of CIA commented
on 3/13/54 that when the Miller information was first received at
that Agency some officials gained the impression FBI was deliberately
collecting and disseminating data solely for the purpose of "hurting"
CIA. Angleton said results of interviews and investigation conducted
by Bureau had clearly demonstrated to CIA officials that FBI was
living by its well-known tradition and reputation of developing
Htacts and reporting information in an impartial manner, He said
on the previous day all officials, including Dulles, commented. the
Bureau was following the Lovestone case in conformity with its

- well established reputation of getting all the faets. In view of

this, there is no basis for believing that at this time CIA would
raise any charges of unfair conduct on the part of Bureau in its
handling of the Miller matter.

RECOMMENDED ACTION:

None. We do not believe, in light of the facts set
forth, that CIA will make an issue of this matter. 7

Item six in material submitted to the Director by Sam
Papich in his memorandum 3/5/70 mentions occasions in the 1950's
when CIA complained that officials visiting the United States
under CIA sponsorship were disappointed because they had no
contact with Bureau officials. CIA felt contact with Bureau
officials had significant benefits, left lasting favorable
impressions because of the .FBI's world-wide reputation, and
when foreign visitors had no contact with Bureau officials
they were left with suspicions there was friction between the
FBI and CIA, In 1956, we had a clear-cut policy to the effect
that tours for such visitors would be of a restrictive nature
and they would be afforded the same treatment as the public
and nothing more.

Memorandum 5/31/56 from Mr. Roach to Mr, Belmont,
captioned "Visit at Bureau by Foreign Police and Intelligence
Officials," (Bureau file 94-2~-32781) recommended for Director's
approval that Liaison would (1) inform CIA tours afforded to
foreign police officials and seeurity officials would continue
to be of a restricted’nature and the visitors will only view
facilities normally seen by the public, and (2). that such
foreign officials would not be interviewed unless it appeared if
to the Bureau's advantage. In regard to 1, the Director noted,
"Y thoroughly agree. I am not too keen anyway about such tours,
We were ‘burned’ in the Johns matter." The Director noted in
regard to 2, "I see no need of interviews." ft

Doctor Otto John was an official of the West German
security service who was ‘closely associated with CIA and who
was alleged to have defected to the East Germans. oe

In his memorandum, Papich emphasized that for the past
several years there was no basis for complaints with regard to

Bureau treatment of foreign officials coming to U.S. under CIA
sponsorship. >

SUBJECT: RELATIONS WITH CIA
COL, JOHN GROMBACH (PAT O'BRIEN)

Background: Item number eight in the material submitted to the
Director by SA Sam Papich in his. memorandum 3/5/70 discusses
relations between Bureau and CIA with Grombach, head of private
intelligence network (O'Brien was Grombach's aide who had liaison
with Bureau).

Problem: Papich states we never informed CIA we were receiving
informa tion from Grombach which was also of interest to CIA;
and that while it is possible Grombach had given same data to
CIA, we do not know.

(8) Analysis: Grombach was financed by CIA during early 1950s (e.g.,
ye udgeted $650,000 for Grombach in 1952) ,(62-77306-60) There
is ample evidence CIA knew we were receiving information from
Grombach. We do know some information was given by Grombach to
CIA and Bureau jointly. O'Brien, for example, told us of
conference in early 1951 between CIA officials and Grombach when

| it was agreed information might be furnished directly to FBI by

| Grombach,- provided CIA was advised by Grombach of what was given.
(62~77306~23) Moreover, on 5/7/52 a CIA official requested
Bureau's views regarding validity of information we were receiving
| from Grombach and asKed for our views regarding method to be
employed in channeling information from Grombach to Bureau.
Significantly, under procedure then, Grombach directed .communica—
i -) tions to CIA with copies to Bureau. CIA was told that as it

! ene appeared Grombach was an appendage of CIA, Bureau was not recom~

¥ mending any method of dissemination and it was up to CIA to handie
problem, (62-77306=25) Fa

In the ensuing period, dispute arose between CIA and
Grombach over channeling of information and Bureau-made every
effort to stay out of dispute, In late 1952, for example, Helms
inquired if Bureau's views regarding dissemination had changed.
He was told they certainly had not and again informed that Bureau's
desire was to receive all information of interest no matter how
received, (62-77306~27) Our position of not becoming involved in
Grombach-CIA: dispute reiterdted:on-other occasions. (62~-77306-36, 69,

( SEChic

On the other hand, there were instances where we
received information from Grombach which was of either an
administrative or intelligence interest to CIA and we did
not inform CIA, These instances covered period both prior
and subsequent to the contractural relationship between CIA
and Grombach which was from 4/51 to 7/54 (62-77306, unrecorded
memo 11/29/55, Belmont to Boardman re Grombach). For example,
Grombach wrote a confidential letter dated 7/30/48 to former
Assistant to the Director D. M. Ladd which contained infor-
mation of interest to CIA. This letter contains a penciled
notation: "This info. not to be given to CIA. per DML--OHB"
(62-77306-7). Memorandum 10/11/50 from A. H. Belmont to
Mr. Ladd contains information from O'Brien concerning
Grombach's intentions to plant microphones in Finland to
cover meetings attended by Russian high staff. ‘It was
observed in the. memorandum that at that time O'Brien and
Grombach had no relations- with CIA and that Grombach's
intended operation was under primary responsibility of CIA.
No indication this information given to CIA by Bureau
(65-58725-10). '

O‘Brien furnished Bureau a memorandum dated
6/29/54 entitled "Termination Memorandum to FBI" which
informed of the termination of contract between Grombach
and CIA, In the memorandum it is pointed out that Grombach
will continue to receive raw material from the field and
that while he will no longer be in a position to translate,
evaluate, publish, etc., Grombach desires to forward such
material to Bureau as Grombacht would not trust any other
agency. The memorandum also states that Grombach has continued
the flow to the Bureau of all reports he felt Bureau would
be interested in even though Grombach received a written
order specifically directing him to not give Bureau any-
thing. (62-77306-70).

(HERBERT HOOVER COMMISSION - 1954)

Item number nine in the material submitted to the
Director by SA Sam Papich in his memorandum 3/5/70 discusses
the Hoover Commission survey of CIA operations in 1954. According
to Papich, there was talk within CIA that the Bureau had furnished
the names of subversives within CIA to Senator McCarthy.
Senator Joseph R. McCarthy (R-Wisc) was Chairman of the Senate
Investigations Subcommittee.

General Mark Clark headed the Task Force which .
surveyed CIA operations between 9/54 and 6/55, In 10/54, CIA
alleged that the McCarthy Committee was attempting to develop’
information regarding CIA operations. According to the Washington
Star, 10/1/54, McCarthy said CIA was "one of the worst situations
we have as far as communist infiltration is concerned." He said
he would give his data relative to this matter to Clark's Task
Force. According to the Washington Star, 1/15/55, McCarthy
said he had given Clark information relative to alleged communist
infiltration of CIA.’ As of 1/17/55, CIA had not received from
Clark the names of those considered security risks but CIA
believed it had done a good job of removing security risks and
believed that it was in good shape.

On 1/21/55, the Task Force requested name checks on
security risks named by McCarthy, Memoranda containing the
results of those checks were given to the Task Force on 2/8/55.
On 5/13/55, the Bureau received a letter from Clark asking for
investigations relative to character, reputation, and loyalty
of individuals mentioned as security risks. CIA was aware of
the names as we asked it for identifying data concerning them.
Clark was later advised that the investigations would entail
interviews at CIA, review of its programs, inquiries in foreign
countries, and the like and he withdrew his request,

RELATIONSHIPS WITH CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY
INTERNAL SECURITY LEADS IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES

Item number 10 in the material submitted to the
Director by Special Agent Sam Papich in his memorandum of
3/5/70 discussed our furnishing leads to our Legal Attaches
(Legats) without advising Central Intelligence Agency (CIA)
or requesting the Agency to handle the lead,

The observations of Special Agent Papich in ths
matter are broad and general in nature. His presentation is
hinged upon the premise advanced by the Agency that "internal
security" cannot be separated from "counterintelligence,"
thereby necessitating our advising CIA of requests to our
Legats to have leads covered in foreign countries. The Manual
of Instructions, Section 102, page 23, states CIA's responsibilities
include collection, collation, evaluation, coordination and
dissemination of intelligence information. CIA does not have,
among other things, responsibility for "internal security
functions."

In the absence of unusual situations,. we forward
investigative leads pertaining to our cases in countries where
we have liaison coverage to.the particular Legal Attache
concerned, Through his contacts the Legat arranges for tle
necessary investigation and submits the desired information
according to our reporting needs. The Legat coordinates.
this activity on a local level.

It is more desirable to have our representatives
request investigation abroad in order to achieve’ maximum coverage,
and to maintain tight control so we can insure il we fulfill
our responsibilities,

Director by SA Sam Papich in his memorandum 3/5/70 discusses
a problem presented by the Phoenix Office in June, 1957, JEK AED
lexican border. These informants were operated inside(texico. |
The problem was predicated on situations which might arise as
the result of CIA endeavoring to develop informants who were
already being handled by the Bureau,

BACKGROUND: {

The Director initiated BOCOV in 1948 to fill a void
in the lack of coverage in the 25-mile zone south of the U,S.-
Mexican border on the part of CIA and Immigration and Natural-
ization Service (INS), The program, which at first involved
3 and subsequently 5 of our border offices including Phoenix,
was designed to detect and neutralize anti-U.S, activities by
subversives in that zone,

In June, 1956, CIA assigned a representative to the
American Consulate, Nogales, Sdnora, Mexico, which is in the
border zone then covered by Phoenix,

PROBLEM: :

————~__ By airtel 6/8/57, Phoenix advised that the CIA
representative had endeavored to develop 3 Bureau sources in
Mexico and stated that it was discontinuing these sources unless
advised to the contrary by the Bureau,

A review of our files since June 14, 1957, fails
to reveal that this problem has been raised subseauently by
CIA activity in the Phoenix BOCOV area. In addition, the
CIA representative was transferred from Nogales on 7/6/59.

He was not replaced by CIA and the border territory he had
covered was subsequently handled by CIA on a road trip basis
out of [exico City.| Furthermore, the participation of the
Phoenix Office in COV was discontinued with the Director's
approval by letter dated 12/10/69. :

SUBJECT: RELATIONSHIPS WITH CENTRAL
INTELLIGENCE AGENCY (CIA)
CIA REQUEST FOR BUREAU.LECTURE -
ON COMMUNISM IN THE U. S.

Item Number 15 in the material submitted - to the Director
by SA Sam Papich in his memorandum 3/5/70 discusses the Director's
refusal of a 1958 CIA request for Mr. W. C, Sullivan to lecture
on communism before a CIA group. Papich stated that CIA accepted
this as an affront and a blatant refusal to cooperate on a most
important subject of interest to both agencies,

The files disclose that by letter 9/25/58 signed by
James Angleton, CIA requested Mr, Sullivan to address a selected
group of CIA personnel on the communist movement in the U. S.
CIA suggested dates of 12/9,10,or 11/58, The Director by routing
slip attached to Angleton's letter commented, "It seems strange
that CIA should seek this when its top representative in Japan
considers FBI as a bunch of mere 'flat-feet' and the dangers
of communism as something conjured up in the minds of the FBI.
But then again I note request doesn't come from the Director:
nor even the Deputy Director of CIA."

Memorandum W, C. Sullivan to A, Belmont dated 10/1/58
made reference to CIA's request ard the Director's comments. It
recommended that the best interests of the Bureau would be served
by giving this lecture, not because of the information which
could be conveyed to CIA on communism in the U, S., but because
it would give Sullivan an opportunity to raise a number of
“questions himself of the group cohcerning CIA's own activities
in the field of communism, It was pointed out that it could be
‘considered a bit of a challenge to see how much thé FBI could
learn about the operation of CIA during the course of the lecture
and discussion rather than the converse. - Mr. Tolson recommended
that the request be declined and the Director concurred commenting,
"We cannot make Sullivan available to this outfit." 7

RELATIONSHIPS WITH CIA
CASE orLEDtARD ELLIS surta] JFK oy)

Item Number 16 in the material submitted to the Director
by Special Agent (SA) Sam Papich in his memorandum 3/5/70 discusses
the case of [Edward Ellis Smith} that CIA might criticize our not

identifying our source, Jeka

ying our s ce C8) JFK ANB)
BACKGROUND OF CASE Smith was the CIA employee assigned to
the American Embassy, Moscow, in 1956, under State Department cover.
He became involved with a Russian girl, and the Committee for
State Security (KGB) approached him for recruitment, using the
affair with the girl and_compromising photographs as leverage to
carry out the approach. Csmith) reported the approach to his Jeane)
superiors and was returned to U. S. and ultimately removed from
CIA.

PROBLEM WITH CIA We first learned of this case on 7/9/56
from David Téeple, a consultant to Scott McLeod of State
recreate veal furnished the information in confidence and who
indicat: mit. hmight h been involved in espionage. On
7/16/56 |Robert Banhernan,) Office of Security, CIA, advised

SA Papich that CIA was considering requesting in writing that
the Bureau identify our source. On 7/17/56 SA Papich was advised

\by Director of Security, CIA, that Allen Dulles had instructed
that the request not be made.

DISPOSAL OF PROBLEM WITH CIA . This problem-never officially
arose in view 0 @ instructions of Mr. Dulles, Bureau files
contain no indication as to whether or not CIA documented this.

RECOMMENDED ACTION:

None. We do not believe, in light of the , facts set
forth, that CIA will make an issue of this matter,

CIA never has been satisfied with the efforts made by the
Bureau in this case. Our review indicates our efforts in the
matter were as full and complete as possible under circumstances
where CIA refused to grant us access to the source, did not
respond to request for clarifying data and declined to remove
restrictions making it impossible to take necessary investigative
steps. Should any question be raised in the future, we are in
a position to document our difficulties experienced with CIA.

RELATIONSHIPS WITH CIA - TRAVEL OF
BUREAU INFORMANTS TO CUBA

wW.C. Sullivan

Item Number 19 in the material. submitted to the
Director by SA Sam Papich in his memorandum 3/5/70 discusses
the possible. travel of one of our Mexican border informants
to Cuba and whether our not advising CIA of this made us
potentially vulnerable to charges we were operating outside
the U.S, without coordinating with CIA.

BACKGROUND:

This involved our plans to send a Border Coverage
Program (BOCOV) informant to a guerrilla training camp in
Cuba. The trip never materialized.

In October, 1965, we were vitally interested in
determining the location and extent of Cuban guerrilla training
sites being used to prepare Latin American subversives to carry
‘out revolutions in their home. countries. EP 572-S, a Mexican
national residing in Juarez, Mexico, which is within the area
covered by the BOCOV Program, had infiltrated Cuban and Chinese
intelligence operations in Mexico City and had made himself
attractive to Mexican communist leaders who were planning to
pay expenses of sending guerrilla trainees to Cuba.'

CIA CONSIDERATIONS ;,

EP 572-S was an integral part of our top secret
BOCOV Program which is handled on a need-to-know basis. We
had previously obtained material from CIA showing its primary
targets inside Cuba which allowed us to fully brief the informant
as to overall U.S. Government objectives and a procedure was
established for use in disseminating data to CIA if the trip
materialized which would fully protect our informant and not
jeopardize the BOCOV operation. .

OUTCOME: : :
During period informant was striving to arrange the
trip to Cuba his wife became mentally i11, extremely emotional
and temporarily deserted the informant. This strained family
relationship caused us to order El Paso to have informant cancel
efforts to make the trip to Cuba and thus no trip was ever made.

RECOMMENDED ACTION:

Memorandum to Mr. C. D. DeLoach
RE: RELATIONSHIPS WITH CIA - TRAVEL OF
BUREAU INFORMANTS TO CUBA

ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS:

After EP 572-S had moved to Guadalajara, Mexico,
which is outside our BOCOV area, in November, 1966, we
advised CIA of his past cooperation with us and interposed
no objection to his use by CIA in areas outside our
jurisdiction, On 11/22/66 CIA stated it would consult us

should it initiate contacts with the informant.

There is

no indication that CIA did use the informant and on 6/24/68
we discontinued EP 572-S as he was of no further value to us.

The trip never materialized,

None. We do not, believe, in light of the facts set
forth, that CIA will make an issue of this matter.

DISSEMINATION OF CIA INFORMATION pecuaSSTyTED Tenens
IN A BUREAU MONOGRAPH Ol eel al OL

Item 20 submitted to the Director by Sam Papich in his
memorandum 3/5/70 mentions the dissemination of a Bureau monograph
dated 5/5/65 and entitled "Communism in the Dominican Republic."
Special Agent (SA) Papich stated that due to the urgency of the
document Bureau did not obtain CIA clearance to include CIA
information in the monograph which was disseminated to interested
agencies, including CIA. According to SA Papich, CIA never
made any protest although it considered our action a violation
of the "third agency rule."

Although the monograph referred to by SA Papich did
contain CIA data, it also set forth highly significant data
obtained by Bureau through our own informants. The CIA data
was biographical in nature and was used in the monograph to
characterize the past, including communist contacts, of key
figures in the Dominican Republic, It was taken from the 1963
CIA Biographical Handbook and CIA telegrams dating back to 1961,
all of which were previously disseminated to the U. S, intelligence
community by CIA. Nosattempt was made in the monograph to
characterize CIA data as Bureau information and, in fact, this
information was attributed to "another Government agency," in.
accordance with established procedures,

The so-called "third agency rule" provides that
classified information originating in a department or agency
will not be disseminated outside the receiving agency without
the permission of the originating agency. However, an exception
to this rule provides that the receiving agency may- disseminate
such data to other members of the U, S. Intelligence Board (USIB) ,
of which Bureau is a’ member, unless the originating agency
uses appropriate control markings limiting its data to the
use of the receiving agency only. The CIA data used in the
Bureau monograph had no such control markings and our monograph
was disseminated to the President, the Attorney General and
USIB members only.

| Item Number 21 in the material submitted to the
Director by SA Sam Papich in his memorandum 3/5/70 discusses
Bureau operation of informants in Guatenaia)and comments on és)
our potential vulnerability for not having” informed CIA at

the inception of the operation of these informants.

! : SA Papich has cited two situations. The first
i concerns Roberto Francisco Cestaneda Felice, an attorney
' residing in Guatemala cityys Our Legat, Mexico, in the Fall
of 1966, identified Castaneda as a potential source of intelligence

& information of importance to U.S. security; conducted

& appropriate background inquiry regarding him and determined
gh a his excellent potential and willingness to furnish intelligence
ae information to U.S. Government. By memorandum 11/23/66 it was
Bee approved that we contact CIA headquarters through liaison
Cae channels to inform CIA that we planned to maintain contact with
Ba Castaneda; that CIA would be furnished the information obtained
gee and that we would service CIA requests provided they c d
258 handled with complete security. SA Papich so informedffjake JY™KC,
ea (5)Ester1ine of) CIA on 11/25/66, *Gsterling) stated he saw no reason Oe)
BE g why FBI could not proceed as we desired and that CIA ees
4 8 would so inform its representatives infGuatemala and Mexico;

4 = instructing them to give FBI all necessary support inthis feZeya)

operation. Since that date we have operated Castaneda as a
valuable and productive unpaid confidential source. Since this
\ matter was coordinated with CIA at the outset, there appears to
‘ be no problem. t

The second situation cited by SA Papich concerned
Legat, Mexico, informant MEX-65. This individual has cooperated
with the Bureau for some 25 years. As a (fusions lepppoticn >)
official in 1945-47, he was most helpful “to our répresentative
assigned in uatenala, e had no contact with him- thereafter
until 1954 when he appeared in Mexico City as a political refugee

Party, USA, (CPUSA), and other communist parties of the world.

This operation basically is performed to gain
high-level intelligence concerning the Soviet. Union's
financial support, domination and control of the CPUSA.
Attendant to this objective, our informants have met with and
discussed mutual problems with leaders of the various inter-
national departments within the Soviet Government. They have
also held discussions with CP leaders from other nations.

All information receiyed as a result of this operation
which has foreign ram¥fications has been promptly disseminated
to CIA at the highest level.

It has not been considered desirable to identify our
sources in this case in view of. the sensitivity of the case
and the physical danger to the informants.

t
Considerable security precautions have been carefully
built into the SOLO operation both in the field and at the
Seat of Government to insure the fullest protection-to its
security and to the safety of the informants involved. Exposure
of the identity of these sources might jeopardize the entire
operation,

RE: RELATIONSHIPS WITH CIA
ITEM (22) SOLO

While former Bureau Agents have gone to work for CIA,
there is no information available indicating they have com-
promised this operation. Of course, they could have done this
unknown to us.

The prompt dissemination, to CIA, of information
developed through SOLO, which is of interest to that agency,
{completely fulfills this Bureau's responsibility without
needless jeopardy. The mechanics of the operation itself
are of no essential significance to CIA.

ACTION RECOMMENDED:

None.

Item #23 in the material submitted to the Director by
SA Sam Papich in his memorandum of March 5, 1970, discusses a letter
dated November 15, 1967, from CIA which requested that the Bureau
check telephone toll calls from the home of one bert Kenneth Brown
who was allegedly harassing CIA|in the Miami area| Brown was SPKOB)
supposedly seeking information concerning CIA's covert operations, ~
SA Papich states that we told CIA that we would not check the toll
calls on the basis that the information received was not sufficient
to justify investigation within the Bureau's jurisdiction, SA Papich
also states that "CIA accepted our response but there is no doubt
that the Agency characterized our position as a concrete example of
refusal to help a sister agency with a problem relating to the
security of U.S, intelligence operations."

A review of Bureau files disclosed that a memorandun,
D. J. Brennan, Jr., to Mr. W. C, Sullivan, dated November 17, 1967,
was prepared, This memorandum encompassed the above facts and
recommended. that CIA Liaison Agent advise CIA that we would not
check the toll calls as requested. This memorandum and recommendation
was prepared by SA Papich. The Pirector noted "OK H.”

In addition to the above, on December 9, 1967, Brown 2
contacted our Miami Office and stated that he was writing a book
about CIA and offered to make the material available to the Miami
Office. Our Miami Office was advised that this information was of
+interest to CIA headquarters and instructions were furnished that

_+if Brown did furnish Miami with the information, ,it would be given

to CIA. Brown did not follow through with his offer.

Item number 24 in the material submitted to the
Director by SA Sam Papich in his memorandum dated 3/5/70
discusses the restriction of dissemination of the Current
Intelligence Analysis (CINAL) to Central Intelligence Agency
(CIA). Prior to 10/67, some of the Government agencies on
the distribution list for CINAL received multiple copies.
The Director of CIA was then receiving 19 copies of CINAL
as a result of requests from CIA on 3/30/62 and 10/23/62 for
additional copies to expedite reading by key CIA officials
and to facilitate rapid utilization of the information
within CIA.

The Director made a notation on the 10/4/67 CINAL:
"Please look over list of distribution. I have marked with
a dot those I question as to why they should recieve copies
and I do not think more than 1 copy should be sent anyone.
Let me have your views. H." By memorandum R. W. Smith to
W. C. Sullivan 10/6/67, it was stated that although security
of the classified document CINAL had been maintained, if the
Director so desired, we would tell recipients that they would
recieve only one copy each in the future. Mr. Tolson noted
on this memorandum, "Yes. T 10/9," Mr. Tolson also noted,
“We could never run down a leak." The Director noted, "Send
only 1 copy & if any inquiry, then indicate we have had to
cut costs. H."

t
Since 10/67 the Director's instructions have been
\ go110wed and only one copy of CINAL has been furnished to

BUREAU DISSEMINATION OF COUNTERINTELLIGENCE INFORMATION
TO FOREIGN SERVICE - 1962 :

Item No, 26 in the material submitted to the Director
by SA Sam Papich in his memorandum 3-5-70 states that CIA by
letter 11-7-62 raised questions concerning the propriety of our
dissemination of information through our Legal Attache to the

6) (Greek)intelligence Service, This concerned certain Committee

for State Security (KGB) technical equipment which was obtained
from our sensitive Soviet defector in place, Bureau code name
Fedora. CIA letter 11-7-62 stated that a representative of

(HfGreek Intelligence Service informed CIA it received afore-

mentioned information from our Legal Attache,- CIA claimed

such dissemination abroad should have been coordinated with

CIA because of Director of Central Intelligence Directive (DCID)

5/2 which indicates that CIA shall be responsible for all U.S,

liaison concerning clandestine intelligence activities abroad or
involving foreign clandestine services, CIA claimed that pursuant
above we were obligated to coordinate with CIA prior to dissemination.

Memorandum Branigan to Sullivan 11-9-62 under Fedora
caption reviewed this situation and indicates that on 7-13 and
8-1-62 Fedora provided information concerning several types of
technical paraphernalia used by KGB. Dissemination of above was
made to State Department, CIA and military intelligence agencies

Ross had visited the Bureau in 1963 to gather material for a

reason for doing so."

Mr. Jones! memorandum to Mr, DeLoach, 8/28/63, reports
this visit and notes that Wise had asked for data concerning
the Bureau's internal security procedures and had asked concerning
other FBI operations, making no reference to CIA, with one
exception, He did inquire as to whether there was friction between
the two agencies and was told that we cooperated closely and

‘maintained daily liaison with CIA, It was on this memorandum

that the Director said he saw no reason for informing CIA con-
cerning the visit of Wise and Ross.

We later learned that their book,""The Invisible
Government," was furnished in the form of advance proofs to

from CIA through Liaison,

Item number 28 in memorandum of 3/5/70 from SA Sain
Papich to the Director, captioned "Cases and/or Situations
Involving Conflict With CIA," states that in April, 1960,
CIA inquired if the Bureau would give any consideration to
assisting that agency toward developing coverage in Africa by
providing a Negro informant or placing a Negro in the Communist
Party, USA for the purpose of eventually using him in Africa.
His memorandum added that we told that agency the FBI had no
informants available because they were necessary for our own
operations. He claims we took the position since we saw no
benefit to be gained by loaning an informant on a short or
long term basis. He states that CIA could argue that as early
as 1960 it had foresight to recognize the need for additional
coverage and when it appealed to the Bureau for assistance,
we did not cooperate. He refers to his memorandum dated 4/7/60
concerning this matter captioned "Communist Activities in Africa."

The memorandum referred to discloses that on 4/5/60
Herman Horton, Deputy Chief, Counterintelligence, CIA, stated
that communist organizations were rapidly increasing in strength
on the continent of Africa and that his agency found it most
difficult to establish effective penetration. Horton noted that
in this connection it was almost impossible for a white man to.
move about Africa and establish a relationship which would enable
him to develop worthwhile sources. He asked if the Bureau would
consider furnishing one of its Negro informants or developing an
informant in the Communist Party, USA for eventyal use by CIA in
Africa, Papich told Horton that if the Bureau had a good Negro
informant, we certainly were not interested in having his future
jeopardized nor did we want to lose his production, Papich
added that it undoubtedly would be most difficult to take a Bureau
informant, have him‘travel to Africa under some cover and still
be able to satisfactorily explain such activities to his communist
colleagues without becoming a target of suspicion, “Horton said
he recognized all this but asked if the Bureau would give
consideration,

Addendum to Papich's memorandum dated 4/8/60 by
the Internal Security Section pointed out that all of our
informants were necessary for our own operations, particularly
in the communist field, and it recommended and was approved
that CIA be orally informed that it is not possible to provide
an informant on a loan basis to be used in Africa.

Regrettably, the Bureau was not in a position to
assist CIA, CIA's problem was an administrative one within
that Agency.

letter dated 10/23/64 we provided the White House information
received by our Legat from U.S. Ambassador to Luxembourg wherein
the latter was critical of intelligence operations, particularly
the overstaffing of personnel, SA Papich comments that we do

Our Legat, Paris, in a letter to the Director dated
10/19/64, set forth the results of a conversation with Ambassador
William R, Rivkin at Luxembourg. The latter. was assigned by the
State Department to conduct a survey of the U.S. intelligence
operations in six European countries, assisted by representative:
of Defense, State Department, and Bureau of the Budget. Rivkin
remarked that the results of the survey were appalling, there
being 23,000 military personnel in the six countries engaged in
intelligence operations and. numerous CIA personnel, He described
the lack of coordination between the military and CIA as
"scandalous." He stated the Offices of the Military Attaches
were grossly overstaffed and he was recommending drastic cuts
and that duplicate administrative services be combined with those
of the embassies. He made no mention of specific intelligence
operations nor did he elaborate on the lack of coordination.
Rivkin commented that on his return to the U.S., he intended to
see the President personally to bring this matter forcefully to
his attention. '

Rivkin's comments were incorporated in a letter to
William D, Moyers, Special Assistant to the President, dated

Item number 30 in the material submitted to the
Director by SA Sam Papich in his memorandum of March 5, 1970,
discusses a dispute we had with CIA in May, 1963, as a result
of:a communication the Bureau sent to the President's Foreign
Intelligence Advisory Board (PFIAB), It was pointed out that
in our communication to PFIAB we attributed certain information

~ to McCone, then Director of CIA, concerning the matter of

increasing wire taps on diplomatic establishments, McCone
charged that the information attributed to him was not so
because he had never made any such statement and he could
prove it. The fact was that the information relating to
McCone had been given us by one of his subordinates who had
indicated the information originated with McCone. McCone
maintained that we should have checked with him before going
on record that any information had originated with him,

A review of the file in this matter discloses that
in April, 1963, Mr. Belmont along with Papich had discussed
with Richard Helms and James Aigleton of CIA McCone's alleged
position with the PFIAB; that he was in favor of across the
board telephone taps on diplomatic establishments. The
Bureau, of course, wasopposed to this and advised Helms that
we would request to make our positon known before the board.
At the conclusion of the meeting in April, 1963, Helms
specifically asked what he should tell McCone apd Mr. Belmont
told him he should tell McCone exactly what had‘ occurred at
the meeting; that the Bureau was opposed to across the board
wire taps and the Bureau intended to so advise PFIAB,

ALLEGED PENETRATIONS OF CIA

Item number 31, "alleged penetration of CIA," in the
‘material submitted to the Director by SA Sam Papich in his
memorandum of 3/5/70 discusses allegations made by
Anatoliy Mikhailovich Golitzyn regarding recruitment of four
CIA employees by the Soviet Committee for State Security (KGB),
that CIA requested full investigation which we declined.

BACKGROUND OF CASE Golitzyn, an intelligence officer of the
KGB who defected to CIA in 1961, alleged that the KGB had
penetrated CIA through an individual having the code name "Sasha."
In an effort to identify this penetration CIA provided Golitzyn
with information regarding many individuals who had worked for
CIA in Germany.

Golitzyn identified two individuals at various times
as "Sasha" and in each instance investigation "washed out" the
identification. Golitzyn finally identified "Sasha" as one
seo Igor Orlov, a former employee of CIA During the course of

‘extensive document reviews Golitzyn became acquainted with
background of various individuals who had worked in Germany at

he was active in the KGB.

Scale investigation of its four-employees based solely on
Golitzyn's allegations.

DISPOSAL OF PROBLEM WITH CIA By letter of February 26, 1965, CIA
Was informed there appeared to be no basis at that time for a

source of the information set forth in our letter. The last
paragraph of this letter includes a statement that the
impression gained from a review of CIA reports indicates that
CIA had some coverage reflecting there were to be troubles
concerning Mr, Nixon's Latin American travels, This letter
also stated as follows:

"It is significant that information in the indi-
vidual countries came to CIA's attention shortly before your
arrival in a particular country. Therefore, there is a
question as to whether or not CIA had coverage in communist
organizations which would -have led to the development of
information concerning communist plans days or weeks ahead of
your visit."

There is no indication in this file regarding
‘instructions given to prepare our letter of May 16, 1958.
The first paragraph of this letter indicates that the Director
had a discussion with Mr, Nixon on May 16, 1958, inasmuch as
the first sentence of the above letter reads as follows:

"Apropos of our discussion today, there is set
forth information contained in Central Intelligence Agency
reports received from them on May 14, 1958,"

The data set forth in our May 16, 1958, letter to
Mr. Nixon is contained in a memorandum Mr. R. R. Roach. to
Mr. A, H, Belmont dated May 15, 1958, which was prepared for
the Director's information, ‘The Director noted on this memo-
randum, "Send summary to A, G. H." In accordance with
instructions, a letter was sent to the then Attprney General
under date of May 16, 1958, and this letter contained a summary

Mr. Nixon on May 16, 1958. Our letter to the Attorney General,
however, did not contain any observations regarding .CIA

of Mr. Nixon to determine if the contents of a letter from
the Director to Mr. Nixon dated May 16, 1958, regarding

Mr. Nixon's trip to South America could be leaked to the
press. Colonel Cushman's request was set forth in memorandum
G. A. Nease to Mr. Tolson June 9, 1958, with the recommenda-
tion that Colonel Cushman be advised that if the information
were to be given to the press, it would undoubtedly create a
serious problem as the FBI would then have violated CIA's
confidence since CIA was aware that SA Papich had reviewed
CIA's classified reports and, therefore, this information
should not be given to the press. Both Mr. Tolson and the
Director agreed with the recommendation, and Colonel Cushman
was advised of our decision. It is noted that Colonel Cushman
is identical with the individual who is now Deputy Director
of CIA.

Comments on Remarks in SA Papich Memo 3/5/70

1, That most of the information in our letter to
Mr. Nixon dated May 16, 1958, came from CIA and that this
letter could be interpreted as raising the question concerning
the quality of CIA's coverage in Latin America. _

There is no dispute as to the source of the informa~
tion which was summarized in our letter to Mr. Nixon, and we
clearly indicated in our letter that the source was CIA. With
regard to any question being raised as to the quality of
CIA's coverage in Latin America, we merely pointed out to
Mr. Nixon something that was readily discernible to any reader
of the CIA reports - ~ that is, that the information from CIA
popped up rather suddenly as related to the country and
Mr. Nixon's arrival. Certainly Mr. Nixon himself, since he
was personally involved in demonstrations directed against
him during his Latin American trip, must have been aware that
advance information from our responsible intelligence agency
(CIA) may have been lacking.

2, Weare not aware if CIA became knowledgeable of
our letter to Mr. Nixon dated May 16, 1958. Under ordinary
conditions, we are not aware nor do we seek to identify any CIA

personnel who might be assigned to the White House staff.
As indicated above, Colonel Cushman, who was a member of
Mr, Nixon's staff in 1958 and who is now a Deputy Director
of CIA, was aware of our 5/16/58 letter and its contents.
We have no information that CIA ever registered any type of
protest in this matter.

3. That CIA technically could raise a question
as to violation of the Third Agency Rule as regards our
5/16/58 Letter to Mr, Nixon.

The Third Agency Rule is intended to prohibit a
Government agency from disseminating information originating
with another. Government agency in the absence of specific
authority to do so, and we follow this rule unless there
are overriding reasons, With regard to our letter to
Mr. Nixon dated 5/16/58, we set forth information clearly
identified as having originated with CIA. This letter
was apparently prepared at the specific request of then
Vice President Nixon after conferring with the Director.

HERBERT ITKIN

Item number 33 in the material submitted to the
Director by Special Agent (SA) Sam J. Papich in his memorandum
3/5/70 discusses Herbert Itkin as an individual who was operated
as a criminal informant by the Bureau who furnished valuable
information and who has been a key witness. in the prosecution
of cases being handled by the Bureau. Mr. Papich states that
the Bureau acquired access to Itkin through the CIA and that
although the CIA has never officially made any statements to the
Bureau, it has been bitterly disappointed that the Bureau never
acknowledged CIA's assistance which the agency considered
extremely valuable.

Memorandum dated 2/20/63 from W. C. Sullivan to
Mr. Belmont captioned "James Hoffa"! set out that James Angleton
of CIA advised SA Papich that CIA had briefed the Attorney General
concerning a source whom Mr. Angleton had used since World War II
and who subsequently has developed a close association with a
lawyer who does considerable wirk for the Teamsters Unions.
Angleton's source was confident that the lawyer could be developed
as a penetration which could "sink" Hoffa and all of his cohorts.
The Attorney General agreed with the CIA representatives that the
matter should be referred to the Bureau for handling.

Mr. Angleton set up the first contact! with the individual
who had the contact with the attorney and at that time Angleton
stated that he did not want to get involved in any. investigative
aspects and wanted to step out of the matter as soon as possible.
As a result, eventual contact was made with Herbert Itkin who
developed into a very productive source. Itkin has been publicly
identified as both a source of the FBI and CIA as a result of his
testimony.

RE: RELATIONSHIPS WITH CIA

(SECRET

The Bureau's success in handling Itkin can be
attributed to the know-how of the SAs of the New York
Office because Itkin is a highly emotional individual
and he had aggravated marital problems, severe pressures
from his many business associates; therefore, it took
a high degree of skill in dealing with this source in
order to achieve the success that we did.

While it is acknowledged that CIA put us
originally in touch with this source, it was not
believed that it is essential that we go back to’CIA
and explain to them our success or to thank them for
giving us this original léad. It is also noted that
there is an obligation upon Government agencies to
cooperate in the fullest and CIA's cooperation in this
matter was in accordance with. the long standing policy
among all Government agencies, .

Review of Itkin's file does not reflect any
instance where CIA indicated a displeasure in the Bureau
{not acknowledging CIA's assistance in placing us in touch
with Itkin. This is in line with Mr, Angleton's statement
in 1963 that he did not want te get involved in any
investigative aspectS of this matter and wanted to step
out as soon as possible. In view of the above, it is not
believed that CIA would have any basis to complain that the
Bureau never acknowledged CIA's assistance.

RELATIONSHIPs WITH, CIA
EXCHANGE OF TECHNICAL INFORMATION

Item number 34 in the material submitted to the
Director by SA Sam Papich in his memorandum 3/5/70 concerns
exchange of technical information with CIA, particularly as
it related to the technical surveillance field. Papich states
CIA exhibited its equipment to us, but for many years we declined
to show any of our devices, with some exceptions, .He states
that CIA never made an official protest but informally indicated
from time to time that the lack of exchange was prejudicial to
overall intelligence and internal security interests and implied
we were more open with the British in this area than with CIA,
Papich states this situation does not exist today as there is
a good exchange by the Bureau and CIA.

Our files reveal that through the years CIA has
furnished the Bureau a number of technical devices for our use
or inspection. They have also furnished technical manuals obtained
abroad and briefed us on operational and technical aspects of
some of ther operations abroad. Laboratory personnel have been
afforded tours and briefings concerning CIA facilities and
equipment and in two instances Bureau personnel have been afforded
training at CIA schoois, As recently as October, 1969} CIA
afforded a briefing to Bureau personnel concerning aClandestine
Transmitter Activator, developed by their technical people and
offered to loan us one of these units as well as afford our
personnel training in the operation of the equipment.

COMMENTS OF THE LABORATORY t

Similarly, Bureau records show substantial reciprocity
on the part of the FBI in developing and furnishing important
technical information to CIA over a period of many years. .
Representative examples are cited below:

Prior to 1955 an important unsolved technical

intelligence problem involved desired access to
enemy intelligence and other security information

protected by combination-type locks (safe doors, and
the like). Scientists in the FBI Laboratory were
able to solve this problem by using X-rays from
radioactive materials to "see" into the interior of

a combination lock and thus recover the combination,
without trace of tampering or other indication that
the lock had been compromised. This was a scientific
breakthrough of tremendous intelligence potential and,
with Bureau approval, our results and techniques were
made known to the appropriate CIA representatives,

- CIA advised that they had theretofore spent thousands
of dollars in an intensive, but unsuccessful effort to
solve the same problem. The impact of this scientific
discovery in permitting access to previously unavailable
intelligence had tremendous value for both the FBI and
CIA, 5

In approxmately the late 50's and early 60's, both CIA

and FBI encountered a new, highly sophisticated type

of secret writing placed into use by the Russians for
communicating with espionage agents. In spite of a
massive technical effort mounted by CIA, scientists

of the FBI Laboratory were successful in first unraveling
the basic principles and techniques underlying this new
Russian system. This important breakthrough thus permitted
for the first time a successful attack against the new
Russian secret ink communication system. Because of its
extreme intelligence potential, with prior Bureau approval,
this development was made known to CIA, and its importance
to CIA is reflected in part by a letter addressed to the
Director of FBI by Allen W. Dulles, then Director of CIA,
under date of August 19, 1961, in which Dulles said, in
part, "For the past several years there has been
increasingly effective technical liaison between the
Technical Services Division of this Agency and correspond-
ing components of your Bureau. . ." Dulles further
commented that Bureau technical personnel had " .'. . made
an outstanding technical contribution for which they are to
be highly commended. Their work not only has an important
impact in one sensitive area, but also has revealed a
chemical mechanism from which may well stem new high-level
secret writing systems. The discovery will have an

assigned both to this Agency and the FBI. I consider
access to these findingsto be further evidence of the
value of close technical liaison between our two
organizations, . ."

Subsequently, again with prior Bureau approval, whenever

i it could be done without jeopardizing FBI operational
interests, the FBI on a continuing basis made available

i Bureau through investigative activity and through high-

espionage case of Herbert William Boeckenhaupt wherein

on 2/12/69 a sample of secret writing material used by
Boeckenhaupt to communicate with the Russians was
furnished to CIA by a representative of the FBI Laboratory.

The above items are representative outstanding examples
of FBI cooperation in developing and sharing highly important
{technical information, and certainly the letter from CIA reflects
the satisfaction and importance which CIA attached to such
information received from the Bureau. Within general Bureau
policy guidelines, there were, of course, on a continuing basis
numerous other items of technical information shared with CIA
over the years, including briefings and exchange of visits.

Items number 35 and 36 in the material submitted to the
Director by SA Sam Papich in his memorandum March 5, 1970, indicated
CIA has never understood why Bureau will not permit "CIA personnel to
lecture. at our schools and CIA was unhappy regarding our attitude
concerning exchange of information in the training field.

CIA by letter May 19, 1950, requested it be permitted to
discuss training problems with FBI training staff in view of
necessity of its maintaining relations with foreign police and
security agencies. Following recommendations by the Executives
Conference, Bureau advised CIA by letter May 25, 1950, that we did
not believe FBI training staff could intelligently discuss training
methods with CIA since our staff was not knowledgeable concerning
conditions encountered’ by CIA in various foreign countries,

Since 1962, we have taken foreign police officers into the
i National Academy through the Agency for International Development
(AID). These officers spent two weeks of orientation with AID and
after graduation certain selective officers have been in touch with
CIA through AID. We 4re aware that CIA has used many of these
graduates as sources of information.

In 1966, the Director approved a request of CIA to have one
of its men attend the National -Academy for purpose "to improve
capabilities of CIA personnel engaged in overseas police training
programs." As a result, a CIA Security Officer graduated from the
77th Session of the FBI ’ National Academy (March 7 - May 25, 1966),

discusses CIA criticism which could generate from Agency belief
that Bureau has failed to cooperate and offer necessary assistance

to evidence lack of cooperation and to briefly comment on policy
- of cooperation we have adopted with CIA.

SYNOPSIS:

GRHATTON CONTA TWD

Mentioned Item by Papich points out CIA belief that

more aggressive action should have been taken in field of
collecting positive intelligence in the United States. Papich
notes Bureau's action in this field, for the most part, has been
restricted to compliance with requests by State Department when
political crises occur in some country. He points out CIA belief
that acquiring needed data would mean increased technical surveil-
lance coverage, development of informants and collection of
cryptographic material. Papich cites two specific cases occurring
in 1969 where Bureau declined CIA's request for technical coverage,
suggesting to Agency that it make its request directly to the .
Attorney General. Review of specific cases mentioned set forth
with Director's comments relatiye thereto being noted. Our

Memorandum to Mr. C. D. DeLoach
RE: RELATIONSHIPS WITH
CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY

a SECREI

Papich points out CIA feels there is unexplored
field for acquiring positive intelligence in the United States
but he notes that there has been no law, directive, or executive
order which fixes responsibility for clandestine collection of
such information. He notes we investigate subversives, spies,
and develop penetrations of foreign intelligence services and
that facets of these investigations of violations of United States
laws serve to fulfill a counterintelligence objective referred
to by us as investigations of internal security matters. Papich
notes, however, that most of ‘our work in the positive intelligence
field has been restricted to the compliance with requests by
State Department prompted usually by a political crisis occurring
in some foreign country.

Papich points out CIA feels there is unexplored a

field for acquiring positive intelligence requiring use of
vastly increased technical surveillances, informant development
and collection of cryptographic material, According to Papich,
CIA does not feel Bureau has moved aggressively in this area
and CIA has been thwarted in attempts to do much about the (>
problem. Papich cites two cases (Alfred S. Gonsalves,J10/69 and

6) Gaiman ShapiroyJ10/69) where CIA requests for techni ‘al surveil-
ance were declined by us with the suggestion to CIA that these
matters should be taken up by that Agency directly with the
Attorney General.

On October 21, 1969, a CIA official was told by
Special Agent Papich that in the future CIA should transmit its
requests for technical surveillance coverage in the United States
to the Attorney General. This specifically covered the cases
of Eonsaives and ShapirG}/athe Director commented “Right.

Bureau Policy of Cooperation

In 1965 and 1966, recognizing overlapping interests,
changes inherent in faster communication, hysteria to facilitate
international travel and in response to requests from CIA, the
Director approved Bureau attendance at conferences with CIA
regarding that Agency's operational activities in the United States.
On a memorandum reporting the results of the conferences with
CIA, the Director commented "I hope we still don't let our
guard down as CIA has always outsmarted us because of our
gullibility."

SAC Letter 66-10 (B) dated 2/15/66 furnished to the
field and Bureau offigials results of the conferences with CIA
and emphasized necessity for protecting Bureau jurisdiction in
the counterintelligence field. This SAC letter (copy attached)
emphasized there is to be no interference with or infringement
upon our jurisdiction but clearly shows our willingness to
cooperate with CIA in developing positive intelligence in the
United States. In approving this SAC letter, the Director
noted "I hope there is no 'sneaker' in this. Tife will tell."

There has been no renewed request from CIA for
technical coverage in the cases mentioned above, nor has there
been any indication that such requests have been sent. by CIA
to the Attorney General as we suggested. Due to CIA interest
in the past in these matters, we cannot rule out the possibility
the Agency may approach Attorney General for the desired
coverage at some time in the future.
