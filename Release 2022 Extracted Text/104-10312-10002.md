This request concerns two individuals who are involved in
offshore banking and who claim CIA connections. They are:
_Gordon Noval, possibly from New Orleans, who owns a bank in
the Caribbean; and Owen Silvious, from Luray, Va, who owns
the Atlantic Security 4 Trust Co in the Turks and Caicos
Islands in the Rritish West Indies. Silvious claims to
have provided information to the CIA.
The information is for the SSCI and they need to know
whether there is anything to the claims of these two indivi-
duals re their connection with the Agency. You might check
with DCD on them. An answer is needed by 28 January 1983.
