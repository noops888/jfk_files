WASHINGTON - The House Assassi-

nations Commiltee is focusing on a small •

group of southySt. Louis segregationists'

- most off them now dead - in its

investigation of the murder of the Rev.

Dr. Martin/ Luther King, committee

sources say.

Committee investigators say the group

may have been the link. between James

Earl Ray, who pleaded guilty of the

murder, and a St. Louis lawyer who may

have wanted King killed.

Crimittee sources, say they consider

this avenue of investigation the most

prymising explanation of a conspiracy

theory in the assassination of the civil

rights leader in Memphis in April 1968:

But they. acknowledge that thus.far they

have little hard evidence to prove it.

The theory revolves around St. Louis

members of the Citizens Council and the

George Wallace for President campaign

of 1968. Investigators have learned that

members of those groups lived and

worked in the vicinity of the former

Grapevine Tavern in the 1900 block of

Arsenal Street. The tavern; which went

out of business in December 1968, was

operated: by. John Larry Ray, a-brother

of James Earl Ray.

Investigators believe that John H.

Sutherland, a St. Louis patent lawyer

William Freivogel, Gerald M. Boyd

and Louis J. Rose of the 'Post-Dis-

patch Staff.

and segregationist, contacted a south St.

Louis man involved with him in several

right-wing groups conveying a money

offer for King's murder..At the time the

man was canvassing businesses in the

neighborhood.of the Grapevine for the

wallace campaign.

The committee's theory is that the

man could have mentioned the offer to

John Larry Ray, who could have passed

it on to his brother. John Larry Ray

denied to the Post-Dispatch that any

such proposal was-made. Sutherland and

the other man are dead.

Gordon Baum, of St. Louis, field

director of the Citizens:Council, has been

subpoenaed to testify before the commit

tee, and sources said other subpoena.

are likely.

Baum, who was active in the work of

the council and the Wallace campaign in

1968, confirmed in an interview that the

committee appears to be scrutinizing

persons who were connected with both

groups in that period

He accused the committee of

"a

systematic purge of right-wing groups in

St. Louis."

The committee has held hearings on

the King assassination and plans to

continue them. in November. The panel

has heard testimony from Russell G.

Byers of Rock Hill that Sutherland and

another man offered him $50,000 in 1967

to arrange for King's murder. Byers said

he turned down the offer.

Investigators believe that Sutherland

then contacted his acquaintance with the

Wallace campaign, who was canvassing

around the Grapevine.

The committee also has learned that a,

woman who was a top official of the

Citizens Council and the Wallace cam-

paign lived in the 2100 block of Arsenal

Street, within 100 yards of the Grape-

vine.

The woman, who also is dead, often

had planning meetings of the twa groups

at her home. The Wallace canvasser was

a good friend of hers and together the

two shouldered most of the responsibili-

ties of the Wallace state headquarters.

The woman generally ran the office

near Gravois Avenue and Morganford

organization opposing civil rights laws.

He was its first president. In 1968 he was

Staff Attorney, House Select Committee on Assassinations,

Former Agent BIDEWELL had previously been advised

in late July, 1978, by SA JAY ALDHIZER, FBIHQ, that

former Agent BIDEWELL might be contacted telephonically

by Mr. EBERHARDT of the House Select Committee on

Assassinations.

Former Agent BIDEWELL, on 8/31/78, received a

telephone call at his home, 1116 Culverhill Drive,

Webster Groves, Mo.

resulting from his escape from the Missouri State

Penitentiary, Jetferson City, Missouri, was assigned to

Special Agent (SA) Bidewell in the St. Louis Division.

At this time, no information had been developed indicat-

ing that James Earl Pay was a suspect in the murder of

Doctor Ring.

The interview with Carol Pepper was most

frustrating since it appeared she was completely un-

cooperative in furnishing any information concerning the

possible whereabouts of James Earl Ray.

To the best

of his rccollection, SA Bidewell advisod that no other

Agent accompanied him on this interview and two or three young

children, presumably children of Carol Pepper, were in the

homc at the time of the interview.

With respect as to how the lead to interview

Carol, Pepper was obtained, it was recalled by SA Bidewell

that the lead was developed as a result of background

information furnished by the Kansas City Division,

office of origin in the unlavful flight to avoid confinement

case.

that no information was obtained through the interview of

indicating that James Earl Ray had been in the St.. Louis

SA. Bidewell further recalled that shortly

after his interview with Carol Pepper, James Earl Ray

became the prime suspect in the Doctor ring murder and.

the case on James Earl Ray was reassigned to an Agent

who could give full time to this matter and no further

investigation was conducted in this matter by SA Bidewell,

the House Select Committee on Assassinations might

lead you to think thät Lare really considers his client,

James Earl Ray, to be the greatest victim of political

oppression since Anatoly Shcharansky:

But don't be misled by Lane's frequent cries of

"McCarthyism" or his assertions that House members

were heaping onto the confessed killer of Dr. Martin

Luther King Jr. the worst abuses "in

hope of convincing the American public, if not the

Congress, that Ray was coerced into confessing, that he

murdered

fing and into accepting a 99-year term in

person, and that Ray was a pawn in an FBI plot to kill

the noted Black civil rights leader.

There was a stormy suspension of Ray's testimony

partly because,

for all of Lane's voluble interruptions;

he and his client were faring badly.

Lane arrived at the hearings surely feeling that

millions of Americans, especially the Blacks in

Congress, were predisposed to believe that former

FBI director J. Edgar Hoover was somehow behind

King's killing. After all, hadn't the Rev. Jesse Jackson

just stated publicly that he didn't think Ray pulled the

trigger?

But under intense questioning from Stokes, 'Ray

and his testimony dealt a blow to any notion that he

was an innocent patsy in a government conspiracy tó

kill King.

Ray said he had lied deliberately to newspaper

reporters, TV interviews, book writers and even his

own lawyers. But now he wanted the committee and

the world to believe him when he

testimony that there is no "Raoul."

Yet, there is the ragging. documented fact that at

the behest of Hoover' the FBI launched at least 25

separate campaigns to destroy Dr. King as a nationa

force. The FBI tried, with futility, to prove him

fináncial crook, a tax cheat; a tool, of the Communists.

The FBI bugged his hotel rooms, his office, tapped his

telephone, cooked up dirty schemes to alienate him

from other Black-leaders,. or to break up his marriage.

The FBI even tried tô induce Dr. King to commit

suicide,"

This, and.a lot more, will surely come out when the

Assassinations Committee gets around to probing the

FBI's work in finding, the killer of Dr. King. We may

get answers as to why, with Ray's fingerprints all over

the gun and other things found near the scene of

the murder, it took

so long for the FBI to establish

the involvement of Ray.

WASHINGTON - An abili witness

for James Earl Ray admitted under

oath Friday that he had lied when

. he said he saw Ray at a Memphis

¿ service station at the time Dr.

Martin Luther King Jr. was Shot to

An

death.

Coy Dean Cowden testified before

the House assassinations committee

that. he was actually in Beaumont,

400 miles from Memphis,

wlien Dr. King was slain April 4,

¿* RAY, WHO IS serving a 99-year

. sentence for Dr. King's murder, has

-said that at the time of the shooting

he was at a Texaco station in

Memphis to liave a tire repaired on

his white Mustang.

Mark Lane, the attorney for Ray

at the committee hearings, had said

in a 1977 book titled "Code Mark

. Zorro" that Cowden claimed to have

seen Ray at the station at the time

of the assassination.

"This is completely false," Cow-

den testified during questioning by

: Cowden said his part of the alibi

story was rehearsed with Renfro

Hays, a private investigator, who

i gave the same story to the National

Enquirer newspaper last year.

ON THE WITNESS stand, Cow-

den; who testified that he was a

former mental patient, said Hays

had hoped to

"make' a million

dollars" out of the Dr. King case.

"I let Renfro lead me into this,"

* -Cowden-said. "I-didn't-have-to-go-

along with it, but I did."

Cowden was asked'by a commit-

later, "I don't know when Cowden is

talking about the matter. Now he

says he's telling the truth."

Cowden's testimony dealt another

later. For years he has sought a new

committee that he had made such a

confession while awaiting, extradi-

"That's probably the most damag-

ing statement that's been made

against me ... admitting guilt on a

declared.

His attorney contended that the

allegations by former Inspector Al:

retired, are unreliable.

read aloud a report on a recent

interview of Eist by the committee's

"Oh, no, no, no," Eist replied. "He

it was there in the conversation that

At one point, Eist was asked, "Did

he express hatred for blacks?"

Eist replied., "There

wasn't any doubt at all ... He said

he was trying to get to Africa to

EIST SAID Ray's ego was such

that he began describing the assassi

ABOUT THAT TIME, Lane re-

instances, false.

Ray's possible involvement in the

1. Alton bank robbery, raised by Fithian,

# drew a heated objection from Lane, and

a quick no from Ray about having a role

in the crime.

Through questioning, Fithian estab-

lished that Ray had been in Alton on July

14, 1967, the day the holdup occurred.

The bank was robbed of $27,000 by two

men, and the case has gone unsolved,.

Fithian said

Fithian said clothing and several items

used in the robbery were found by

• authorities about a block from the house

of a Ray relative living in Alton at the

"time. In addition, he said, one of Ray's

_brothers, Jerry, who was then working in

•Chicago, had been off work on the day of

the holdup.

Fithian noted that Jerry Ray ana

another brother, John, had been arrested

in 1970 for the robbery of another banli.

• Helsaid John Ray had been involved in

fout other bank robberies during 1969

and 1970.

Fithian's implication is that the bank

robbery could have given Ray money to

live on for several months. Fsllowing

that line of thought, he then iniroduced

evidence that showed that Ray might

"•It they had something, why didn'";

dited to the United States to stand trial

for the King killings. And after his guilty

• Stokes submitted evidence that showed

Lengthy questioning by Stokes attempted

to challenge accounts that Ray has given

newspaper and television interviews

about his visits to those sites.

Stokes, at one point, asked Ray wheth-

er he had planned to go to Atlanta when

seemed shaken as Stokes introduced into

evidence a change-of-address form filled

that his mail should be forwarded to

and finally to Atlanta. His statement

says that after leaving Los Angeles he

went to New Orleans, to meet the person

• named Raoul.

Ray said that he arrived late and was

instructed to go to Birmingham. After

meeting Raoul, the pair went to Atlanta,

Ray said.

Stokes, however, pointed out that on

the automobile trip from New Orleans to

Birmingham Ray had spent the night in

a hotel in Selma, Ala. A map offered into

that pointed out King had been in

about the same time that Ray was in

• Selina.

Ray said, in response,

that he had

• taken a wrong road after leaving New

Orleans and had decided to spend the

night in Camden because it was dark.

In perhaps the most damaging evi-

dence offered, Stokes offered testimony

and a cleaner's receipt that indicated

that Ray was in Atlanta at leas until

April 3. The evidence contradicted Ray's

swom statement that he left Atlanta on

March 28 to drive to Memphis.

One document that Stokes offered was

a statement from the owner of a rooming

house in Atlanta that Ray had given him

a week's rent in advance on March 31. In

addition, Stokes showed the cleaner's

receipt indicating that articles of clothe

ing had been left by an Eric Galt or

April 1.

Ray has admitted picking up the

clothes the day after King was assassi-

nated and has said that he iled then to

Canada.

I rying to emphasize the significance of

Ray being in Atlanta in early April,

Stokes read from the transcript of a

television interivew with Ray in which

Ray said that such evidence would be

damaging.

"If I left Los Angeles planning to

return to the Deep South, then I will take

responsibility for the King assassination

right now," Ray said, in a "60 Minutes"

television interview. Ray told the com-

mittee that he could not recall why he

had made that assessment.

Stokes assailed Ray's statement to the

committee that-Raoul had never handled

the 30.06 rifle that is believed to haven

been the weapon used to kill King.

Ray said he had bought the weapon for

Raoul in Birmingham, Ala., for what hey

thought was a gun-running scheme.

Previously, the committee had pro-

Before 'fle could respond to Stokes'

questions about the Atlanta-related evi-

dence, the committee recessed for

Junch.

Trying to emphasisize the signifi-

cance of Ray being in Atlanta in early

april, Stokes read from the transcript of

a television interview with Ray in which

Ray said that such evidence would be

damaging.

"If I left Los Angeles planning to

• return to the Deep South, then I will take

• responsibility for the King assassination

right now," Ray said, in a "60 Minutes"

television interview. Ray told the com-

mittee that he could not recall why he

Ray, who pleaded guilty to the mur-

ter of King in March 1969, has contended

since then that he did not commit the

crime.

Wednesday's testimony was the first

• time that he had given statements under

oath about the assassination. During

: that appearance, he said that he had not

* killed King and had been the victim of a

complicated plot that involved the mys-

terious Raoul. He said that Raoul had

steered him to Memphis under the guise

of smuggling guns and that he had left

King is believed to have been killed

¡shortly betore the shots were fired. Dur-

never fubly identified accomplice had

never handled the .30-06 rifle that is be-

lieved to have been the weapon used t

sill the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr

on April 4, 1968.

Ray said he had bought the weapon

for a man named Raoul in Birmingham,

Ala., for what he thought was a gun-

running scheme. Ray said he and Raoul

had worked together for months, from

Canada to Mexico, in various smuggling

deals.

Ray said that if he had killed King,

his fingerprints never would have been

found on the murder weapon.

"I would have wiped my fingerprints

off the rifle if I knew it was going to be

used in a serious crime," Ray said. He

insisted that even as a petty criminal he

was too smart to leave his prints behind.

It was suggested that he did not have

time to wipe his prints off the rifle be- ;

cause he was-in-a hurry to flee the scene

jof the shooting.

"Usually you do that (remove the

prints) beforehand - before the crime,"

JRay said. "There are several things you

Ray's fingerprints were found on the

"It doesn't to me," Ray replied.

Ray said in his opening testimony

Wednesday that he never shot King and

was several blocks away from the mur-

der scene having his car serviced at a

Agas station at the time King was killed.

that he returned the first rifle to a sport;

testimony Wednesday, Ray said Raoul

"Where I had the problem was that: I

"When I saw government documents

Ray conceded that he had said this.

'At first, at the stall interview,el

I thaught it was exchanged the same day,

said.

Ray's faulty - if not selective

memory was attacked over, and over.

Why had Raoul never been found? Who

• could have seen them together? Why

couldn't Ray furnish more descriptive

information about Raoul, such as his

real name?

Ray had no hard answers. "Possibly

a barmaid in Birmingham.

Possibly a

waitress in Jim's Grill in Memphis" had

seen him in Raoul's company, he said.

•But.he couldn't be sure. And he men-

tioned no one in Montreal, where he al-

leged he had met the man. •

"Mr. Ray, ! say to you, this com

inttee has reviewed every FBl docu

« mient relative to this case, every other

investigative document, and nowhere ly

• there a reference to a man named

Raoul," Stokes said.

To that, Ray replied only that per-

hays not all documents had been fourid

, in the matter.

Stokes: "If we can't find Raoul, we

can't help you very much, can we?"

Ray:

"I think the only thing that

• could help me is a judge."

Q: Don't you think if we had more

information about Raoul, we might be

able to locate him?

A: If 1 had gone to trial in 1968, he

most likely would have testified against

me anyhow.

The proceedings were interrupted

and delayed over and over when Ray's

attor'hey, Mark Lane, a longtime postu-

lator of conspiracy theories in the King

and "John F. Kennedy assassinations,

objected to the course of the questioning.

Lane repeatedly complained of not

having transcripts and other documents

related to the interrogation. "This is not

an investigation by (the late) Sen. Jo-

How Roy escaped

Missouri prison

By DENNIS J. MCCARTHY

Globe-Democrat Staff Writer

WASHINGTON - James Eary Ray I

gave details Wednesday about his

1967

escape from the Missouri State Peniten-

tiary and told how he obtained a pistol

from a South St. Louisan known as the

"Cat Man" after the breakout.

In a statement which he read to the

House assassinations committee, Ray

identified the man first as "Jack Gor-

win" but later referred to him as "Jack.

Gowrin."

He said Gorwin got the pistol for $200

from "a fence in East St. Louis."

Ray, the star witness in the commit.

tee's hearings.on the April'4, 1968,

assassination of the Rev. Dr. Martin

Luther King Jr., gave this account of his

escape from the penitentiary in Jefferson i

City:

G.

•§'SEVERAL DAYS prior to the escape,

I fashioned a board approximately 3x4

feet which would fit inside a box usel to

tränsport bread outside the príson."

He said that earlier he had used a

hammer and nails to punch holes in the

box.

"On April 23, 1967, I entered the prison

kitchen early - I worked afternoons —

at approximately 8 a.m."

Later, he said, he got into the box and

• covered himself with the board he had

prepared. Then another prisoner filled

the box with bread and the box was

placed on a truck, he said.

Ray said the truck was stopped at the

prison security gate and a guard looked

in the box but "all he would see was

bread."

"AFTER PASSING through the prison

sate, got out of the box. After the truck

crossed the Missouri River bridge near

the prison farm, it stopped before

tuning into a road leading to the farm.

When the truck stopped, Idisembarked."

Ray said he spent the night in a jink

car he found on a rural road.

At this time, he said, he had with him

several candy bars, some bread he lad

taken from the truck,

$250 in cash, a

radio and a Social Security car in the

name of John L. Rayns.

He said he began walking the next

night. His shoes finally fell off and he

"had to make a forcible entry into a

store to obtain another pair," he said.

Ray said he was heading in the general

direction of Kansas City, but on the sixth

diy after his escape, he hopped a freight

triin to St. Louis.

I made my way to South St. Louig, to

the residence of an individual who called

(himself 'Cat Man' (Jack Gorwin)," Ray

continued.

HE SAID GORWIN wasn't at home, so

ye took taxis to East St. Louis anj

Edwardsville and then a bus to Chicago

He arrived in Chicago April 30 and

worked there for two months as a

dishwasher, Ray said.

He said he bought a car and wound up

• on June 21 in East St. Louis where he

stayed in a rundown hotel.

Judge issues order

to protect Ray

From Giobe-Democrat

• WASHINGTON - A court order to

protect James Earl Ray, the convicted

killer of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.,

from prison abuse while he is waiting to

testify at sessions of the House assassi-

nations committee was issued Wednes-

day, his attorney said.

Earlier the attorney, Mark Lane, had

accused guards at the Federal Correc-

beating Ray Monday night and putting

him• in a tiny punishment cell where

lights burned 24 hours a day.

"The lights will be out in Ray's cell

tonight so he can sleep," Lane said after

"to be taken out of the hands of prison

Ray blames guilly plea

on pressure from lawyer

By DENNIS J. McCARTHY

•Globe Democrat Staff Writer

WASHINGTON - Convicted assassin

James Earl Ray swore Wednesday that

if he had been given a trial, he would

have testified that "I

did not shoot

Martin Luther King Jr."

Ray told the House assassinations

committee that he "could have offered

conclusive proot in support of the deni-

al."

He is serving a 99 year prison sentence

in Tennessee for the slaying of Dr. King

Ray's Missouri escape. . .13A

April 4, 1968, in Memphis. Three days

after entering a guilty plea in 1909, Ray

recanted - but his statement before the

committee was the first time he had

gutlined his case publicly under oath.

"In respect to the guilty plea... it is

not a difficult matter for an attorney to

maneuver his client into a guilty plea

• . . especially when the attorney has the

active cooperation of the judge and

prosecutor,

" Ray testified as eight feder-

al marshals stood around him.

The 50-year-old Ray, in a soft Southern

staccato, spent more than an hour

reading a 38 page prepared statement in

which he declared his innocence in the

shooting of Dr. King, but admitted his

guilt in a series of other crimes including

• robberies and smuggling.

HE OFFERED AS conclusive proof of

innecence his oft-repeated declaration

that he was at a service station in

Memphis, having a tire repaired, at the

time Dr. King was gunned down on a

balcony in front of Room 306 at the

Lorraine Motel.

Ray hinted in his statement that a mari

he identited as "Raoul" may have been

the killer of Dr. King, an allegation hey

has made before.

He said he and Raoul met in a tavern

in Montreal in July 1967, about three

WASHINGTON - Convicted assassin

James Earl Ray

has.told a House

committee that he did not kill the Rev.

Dr. Martin Luther King and that he was

the victim of a complicated web involv-

ing a mysterious man who apparently

i tramed Ray.

In his first public statement on the

case, Ray today recanted his March 11169

guilty plea at a public hearing of the

Fouse Select Committee on Assassina-

fions.

He said he had been pressed inti

tepresented him, including one who said

that he would not present an adequate

defense if Ray pleaded not guilty.

Following closely a prepared state-

ment for more than an hour, Ray care-

that began when he escaped from the

Missouri Penitentiary in Jefferson City

in April 1967 and ended with his guilty

plea 2 years later.

Ray had been seen leaving the boarding

house after the shot was fired.

Foreman argued also, Ray said, that

unless he pleaded guilty, Ray's brother,

Jerry, would be arrested on a conspira-

cy charge, and his father, George, would

have to return to prison. Ray's father,

who Ray said was 70 at the time, had

escaped from an lowa prison in 1930.

The testimony began in a verbal

exchange between Ray's lawyer, Lane,

and several committee members. Lane

has accused the committee of trying to

present evidence that would show Ray

guilty of the crime in an effort to cover

up involvement by the Federal Bureau

ff Investigation.

Lane said that Ray had been beaten

py federal marshals before leaving

Memphis for Washington yesterday. A

committee member, however, said such

charges were out of order and were not

related to Ray's testimony.

During his testimony, Ray said sever-

al times that he thought the FBI had

arranged

King's assassination. He of-

fered no evidence, however.

in another development, Lane, con-

tinued his attacks Tuesday on the HOuse

committee, calling for the disbarment of

its general counsel, G. Robert Blakey,

and of its deputy counsel, Michael

Oberhardt.

Lane told reporters that Blakey,

Eberhardt and Conrad Baetz, a staff

investigator who is based in Madison.

County,

Ill., had "suborned perjury,

criminally

received

stolen

property,

monitored and tape-recorded telephone

-conversations and violated their own

rules

The charges were similar to those

Lane made recently in St. Louis at a

news conference with Oliver Patterson,

a Black Jack, Mo., man who says that he

intormed on Jerry Ray, a brother of

Kay, for the committee. Patterson alleg. *

is that he secretly tape-recorded tele-

stole some letters sent to Jerry Ray by

James Earl Ray, and even stole strands

of Jerry Ray's hair — all at the behest of

Baetz.

The allegations prompted Blakey 1o•

- begin an investigation. Last week, he

announced that the preliminary finding

was that committee staff had done noth-

ing illegal.

But Lane said Tuesday that the

committee had not checked with the

[ersons making the allegations - Pat-

verson, himself or Susan Wadsworth, a

Florissant woman who says she partici-

pated with Patterson in some of his ac-

tivities. Therefore, Lane said he was

mystified by the clean bill of health. In

addition, Patterson said Tuesday he had

taken — and passed — a polygraph teb

ation.

Will James Earl Ray

From Globe-Democrat

News Services

WASHINGTON - How much does

James Earl Ray really know about the

events leading up to and away from a

moment of violence in Memphis April 4,

1968? And will he talk?

Those are the most tantalizing ques

tions among many that will be on the

minds of

congressional investigaters

Wednesday when Ray is scheduled to

testify in public for the first time about

the 10-year-old murder of the Rev. Dr.

Martin Luther King Jr.

IN 1869, RAY pleaded guilty to the

murder and is serving a 99-year term at

the Brushy Mountain Penitentiary in

Tennessee. But he was brought to Wash-

ington under heavy guard for his public

appearance before

the House Select

Committee on Assassinations.

It is possible, however, that Ray's

testimony, which is scheduled for three

days, will be cut short. Since his plea of

guilty, Ray has been insisting on his

innocence and has been struggling des-

perately to reopen his case and obtain a

new trial.

Denies Illegal Methods

Were Used In King Inquiry

By GERALD M. BOYD

A Washington Correspondent

• of the Post-Dispatch

WASHINGTON - The stalf director of the House

Select Committee on Assassinations has denied a charge

that a committee investigator used illegal methods in

attempting to gain information for the committee's

inquiry into the assassination of the 'Rev. Dr. Martin

Luther King Jr.

But director G. Robert Blakey confirmed that Oliver

Patterson of St. Louis, who made the charge, had

testified to the committee.

"On the strength of a preliminary investigation, the

committee categorically denies each and every allega-

tion of wrongdoing," said Blakey, who is directing the

committee's s.5 million inquiry into the murders of

King and President John F. Kennedy, at a news

conference Thursday.

Facing criticism from members of Congress con-

cerned about Patterson's charge, Blakey broke a news

blackout that had been in existence since he became the

committee's chief counsel in June 1977. But after issuing

a-four-paragraph- statement, he refused further com-

ment and declined to answer questions.

At a news conference in St. Louis on Monday,

Patterson accused an investigator of attempting to gain

information about King's assassination by using Patter-

son's friendship with Jerry Ray, brother of James Earl

May, in prison for King's death. The charges generated

unusual attention, because Patterson said he had

worked for the committee for the last. few months.and

had once been an informant for the Federal Bureau of

Investigation.

"Blakey said Patterson had never been an employee of

the committee. He implied that Patterson and Rays

atiorney, Mark Lane,

who was also at the news

two-year inquonday, were attempting to discredit the

two year inquiry.

"The committee is determined that the American

people will not be misled by attempts to discredit the

committee and its investigation," he said.

Patterson, who had not been publicly linked to the

assassination investigation before Monday's news

conference, cited a series of questionable and possible

illegal actions that he said he had performed for the

committee. He said an investigator, Conrad Baetz, had

requested the acts.

Baetz, he said, asked that he illegally record Jerry

Ray's telephone conversations and sift through his

delongings for letters from his jailed brothe:. On

another occasion, be contended, Baetz attempted to

have him arrange a news conference to discredit Lane

sand to offer further evidence of Kay's guilt.

De. King Seemed To Expect

Assassination, Abernathy Says

unite.)

By GERALD M. BOYD

A Washington Correspondent

of the Post-Dispatch

WASHINGTON - The Rev. Dr.

Martin Luther King was probably aware

that he would be assassinated and un-

derwent severe periods of depression in

the months preceding his murder, the

Rev. Ralph D. Abernathy, his chief lieu-

tenant in the civil rights movement, has

testified.

Abernathy said that, over the last

four months of his life, King showed a

marked change in his mental state,

which seemed to indicate that he knew

that he would be killed.

He said that King had been harassed,

constantly by the Federal Bureau of

Investigation and that neither-the FBI

nor other police authorities provided

adequate security for King, even though

they had been told that King was con-

stantly receiving death threats.

The charges against the FBI and the

description

of

King's

last

months

emerged as the key elements of Aberna-

thy's remarks today at a public hearing

of the House Select Committee on Assas-

sinations.

Under continuous questioning from

the 1l-member committee, Abernathy

said he had no evidence to substantiate

his belief that King knew that he would

be killed. But he said that he was certain

that King did know.

the testimony of Abernathy, which

included a moving description of King's

last hours, came at the start of five days

of hearings on the civil rights leader's

death. King was assassinated in Mem-

phis on April 4, 1963. James Earl Ray

was later arrested and confessed to the ?

assassination.

Since his confession, Ray has denied:

committing the murder. He has sought ar

new trid and said that he would tell the

"real" story if a new trial ever was held.

Abernathy is the current head of the

Southern Christian Icadership

Confer-

ence - the group King founded. He had

been a constant companion and friend of

King since 1955 and was with King when

he was fatally shot.

Todaara yestimony represented lin

attempt by several committee members

to determine King's relationship with

the FBI and to determine whether the

agency knew about the assassination

plan in advance or failed to adequately

pursue leads in the case.

One committee member, Rep. Sa-

muel L. Devine, R-Ohio, said he hoped

the committee was not attempting to

dwell on the FBi at the expense of pursu-

ing other angles of the assassination.

Abernathy said that King was reluc-

tant to report death threats to the FBI.

He said that the slain civil rights leader

was aware, as early as 1955, that he was

a target of telephone tapping, electronic

bugging and other surveillance methods

of the FBI and other government agen-

cies.

"The FBI was aware of some of the

- threats," Abernathy said. "We did not

report all of them, because we believed

that are to He Bag son and :

were quite racist.

"Just because you take a person and'

put a badge on him doesn't change his

heart."

7

Abernathy said that King was aware

that then FBI director, J. Edgar Hoover,

had called him "the most notorious liar

in America."

On the day before the assassination,

Abernathy said, a plane King was riding

on was delayed for about an hour while

it was searched. Abernathy said he had

no idea who had ordered the precaution,

but that no special security had been

available after King's party reached

Mempnis, either from the FBI or frcm

local police.

Several committee members also

questioned Abernathy about a group of

Memphis blacks called the "Invaders.

Abermathy said they had been paid FBI

King had originally gone to Memphis

ended in violence, but King and other

Southern Christian Leadership Confer-

ence officers returned to Memphis a

week later to conduct a secord march.

He was killed on the return trip.

Abernathy Said that King had learned

on April 3, when he returned to Mem-

phis, that the Invaders were paid FBI

informants. Efforts were made, he said,

to shield King from them because of

concem for his safety.

"We were aware that they might

impose a threat to Dr. King's safety, and

that is why we insisted that he not see

he was aware that they were FBI infor-

The committee is apparently examin-

ipg the Invaders in an attempt to deter-

mine their relationship with the FBI.

One committee member said, for exan:-

ple, that some persons in the group nai

rented a room at the Lorraine Motel,

where King had been staying.

Abernathy's most dramatic testimo-

ny dealt with his relationship with King

and King's mental-condition during the

last four months of life. When asked how

he knew that King believed he would be

assassinated, Abernathy said that he

had no direct knowledge, but that after

January 1968 the civil

rights leader

seemed more concerned about his death.

"His attitude was altogether differ-

ent," Abernathy said. "He seemed more

troubled, more nervous and a more

worried person."

At one point, he said, the two took a

trip to Acapulco, Mexico, in an attempt

to get King to relax. But all the time,

Abernathy said, King seemed to be con-

cerned about problems.

During that period, Abernathy said,

King turned over to him more duties as

vice president of the Southern Christian

Leadership Conference than ever before.

And King authorized the organization's

pyraws to say that Abernathy should

replace him in the event of his death.

"Before 1968, he wasn't talking Ike

Lane was in St. Louis on Monday for

something of a three-ring circus of dis-

closures and allegations. In addition to

the charges about spying, Lane:

- Accused the committee staff of

using illegal means to gain evidence,

including wiretapping and thefts, all as

part of a "conspiracy" to prevent a fair

investigation into King's death.

- Engaged in a mild shoving match

with a New York Times reporter and

accused the Times of being an unwitting

"transmission belt" for false disclosures

about the, King murder. Lane main-

tained that committee investigators had

intentionally leaked the information to

the Times to discredit Ray's contention

that, despite his guilty piea, he is inno

cent.

Lane said he decided to make his alle-

gations public because,

"Members of

they are being betrayed by their own

into Byers after he had become a prime :

The second document quoted an in-

that a Missouri businessman was "the

individual who

made

the payoff to

James Earl Ray after the killing" on

April 4, 1968.

Webster said that the second docu-

ment constituted "heresay three times

American Bar Association's national

convention, Webster said that although

'Broker named

as conspirator

in FBI memo

WASHINGTON (AP) - An FBI agent was given a

second-hand account by an informant several years

after the 1968 assassination of Dr. Martin Luther. King

Jr. that a St. Louis stockbroker was "the individual who

made the payoff of James Earl Ray," according to the

agent's report released Thursday.

The stockbroker and a lawyer who also was impli-

cated in the claimed conspiracy have died. Their wives

deny their husbands had any such involvement.

• THE FBI AGENT, whose name has not been re-

leased, wrote a memo for his own files in March, 1974,

after a wide-ranging interview with an unnamed infor-

mant. Among the criminal matters they discussed was

the informant's claim that he had been told the previous

year by Russell G. Byers, a former St. Louis auto parts,

dealer, of a conspiracy by the lawyer and the stockbro.

was the man who later paid Ray an unspecified amount

for the actuaf'killing.

Ray is serving a 99-year sentence for King's killing:

He pleaded guilty,-but now says he had no part in the

shooting.

The agent did not forward his report of the interview

to FBI headquarters and it was not discovered until last'

March, during a review of St. Louis bureau files on an

unrelated matter.

THE AGENT'S report was dated March 19, 1974.

Kauffmann died less than three weeks before, on March

1, 1974.

Particular attention is directed to the interview with

KENNEDY on 8/4/78 as it pertains to dissemination of

information by him, which information is reflected in

serial 5 of St. Louis file 137-16185.

In this interview

Of 8/4/78, KENNEDY stated that he recalls with reasonable

certainty that certain information was disseminated by him

to the St. Louis Police Department.

In order to document such dissemination, this is to

record that I personally searched our dissemination control

file, 66-2340, for the months of April through July of 1974

and found no record of such dissemination having been made.

It should be noted that the volume of 66-2340 for the

month of March, 1974, and prior months are no longer maintained

as they have been destroyed under the file destruction program.

There is no FD-159 (dissemination form) concerning this

earlier reply thät in his recollection this cömment pertained

information in keeping with the above-cited handwritten

He related that he recalls with reasonable certainty

that he did disseminate the information appearing on page 2

to someone in the St. Louis Police Department whose identity

he does not now recall.

Mr. KENNEDY called further attention to the last paragraph

of page 3 of the memorandum in question which refers to another

killing, unrelated to the MARTIN LUTHER KING matter. He

volunteered that this additional unrelated information was also

disseminated, to the best of his recollection, to the st. Louis

Police Department; however, he similarly does not recall to

whom this information was given.

Byers Knew Of Payoff,

FBI Was Told

WASHINGTON - The Federal Bureau

f Investigation received information in

1973 that Russell G. Byers, a former auto

sarts dealer and police character from

Rock Hill, knew who "made the payoff of

ames Earl Ray" after the assassination

uf the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.

Byers' accusation, reported by an

informant, is contained in an internal St.

Louis FBI office memorandum made

•ivailable Wednesday to the Post-Dis-

patch under the Freedom of Information

Act.

The memorandum, which went un-

noticed for four years in the wrong file in

St. Louis, does not give the name of the

man identified by Byers. But it describes

the man as "a short, stocky man who

walked with a limp."

This description, several sources have

told the Post-Dispatch, fits John R.

Kauffmann, a one-time stockbroker of

Imperial, Mo. Byers has reportedly told

investigators for the House Assassina-

tions Committee that Kauffmann and

John H. Sutherland, both now dead,

asked Byers to arrange King's murder.

However, one source said that at least

one other man fitting the description

could not be ruled out as the person

described in the memorandum. The

second man was described by St. Louis

police sources as an avowed segregation-

ist and an acquaintance of Sutherland's.

Byers refused to comment on the FBI

memo when reached at his Rock Hill

home Wednesday night. He said the

House committee had asked him not to

make public statements.

Byers was keenly interested, however,

in the new disclosures. He carefully

analyzed the copy of the FBI memo

released Wedresday. And, while hum-

ming a tune, he read through a New

York Times story about the memo.

Byers' allegations are currently under

scrutiny by the House Committee on

Assassinations. A committee source told

the Post-Dispatch Wednesday night that

the committee was still trying to assess

the significance of Byers' story.

All names but that of Byers were

deleted from the FBI memorandum by

NW 68268 Deedom 2989formation Privacy

989797 Page 90

Acts Branch. But the memorandum

liscussed a meeting among Byers anc

wo men in which Byers said he "hac

been offered either $10,000 or $20,000 to

kill King."

Sources have told the Post-Dispatch

that Byers told House investigators that

auftmann and Sutherland, a paten

awyer, also from Imperial, asked him t

arrange King's murder.

The memorandum, dated March 19,

1974, was written by a St. Louis agent of

the FBI on the basis of information

supplied by an informant.

"In the fall of 1973," the memorandum

reads, "Beyers)(the name is consistently

misspelled in the memo) talked freely

about himself and his business, and they

later went to (short deletion by FBI)

where Beyers told a story about visiting •

a lawyer in St. Louis County, now

deceased, not further identified, who had

offered to give him a contract to kill

Martin Luther King. He said that also

present was a short, stock man, who

walked with a limp."

The memorandum then continues with

this sentence, enclosed in parentheses:

"Later,

with regard to the latter

individual, Beyers commented that this

man was actually the individual who

made the payoff of James Earl Ray after

the killing.)

Several sources have told the Post-

Dispatch that Kaufmann was short,

overweight and walked with a marked

limp after being injured in an automobile

accident several years prior to the

events described by Byers.

The other man fitting that description,

however, is known to have testified

before the subcommittee in April. Roy A.

Walther III, an attorney for Byers,

refused to say whether the other man

was implicated in Byers' testimony.

Walther said he had never heard of the

other man until the time of Byers'

testimony before the House committee.

said the man was an avowed segrega-

tionist, and had appeared in St. Louis

frequently to speak at segregationist

rallies during the late 1960s. He was also

known to have been acquainted with

Sutherland.

The man is further known to be closely

associated with Ray, who pleaded guilty

'of King's murder in 1969 and is serving a

99-yéar prison sentence in Petros, Tenn.

Since pleading guilty, however, Ray has

denied full responsibility for the shooting

and has sought a new trial.

Kauffmann, a one-time stockbroker

63017, residence telephone number (314) 391-6518.

Mr. BENDER is presently unemployed, having retired from FBI

service on 2/28/77•

Prior to his retirement he was assigned to

the St. Louis Field Division of the FBI from 1953 to the date of

his retirement. Additionally, he served in the capacity of

Field Supervisor in the St. Louis Division of the FBI for apprOx-

imately nine years prior to and until the date of his retirement.

He supervised general criminal matters.

MK. BENDER was interviewed at the St. Louis FBI Office, at

which place he voluntarily appeared.

Mr. BENDER was exhibited sufficient portions of a closed

St. Louis file 137-16185 to enable him to identify it as a matter

which was at one time under his supervision and assigned

to an

Agent under his supervision by the name of HOWARD C. KENNEDY.

The file in this instance pertains to one RICHARD F. O'HARA,

a former informant of the St. Louis Division of the FBI.

The attention of Mr. BENDER was directed to a memorandum in

this file dated 3/19/74 to the SAC, St. Louis,

from Special Agent

HOWARD C. KENNEDY. This memorandum is identified as serial 5 of

the file. Mr.. BENDER was 'permitted to read this memorandum in

order to refresh his memory concerning its contents. Although

he had no independent recollection of the memorandum or its contents,

after reading it he concluded that the memorandum had crossed his

desk on or about 3/19/74, as attested to by the appearance of his

handwriting on the memorandum. BENDER's attention was further

disseminated beyond the file in which the memorandum is located.

He did note that there is a handwritten notation in his hand-

writing on page 1 of the memorandum which states, "Notify locals

of info re killing." Upon reading the memorandum in detail,

it was BENDER's conclusion that this handwritten notation did

not apply to the above-cited paragraph but, instead, applied to

an unrelated matter of interest to local authorities appearing

on page 2 of the memorandum.

Mr. BENDER stated that he has

absolutely no recollection

as to why the information contained in the above-cited paragraph

on page 3 of the memorandum in question was not disseminated

or acted upon. He can only assume that such failure was through

inadvertence

He can make no judgment whatsoever concerning

the credibility of the information as a possible reason for

not acting on it.

BENDER related, however, that because of

his long association with the FBI

• in St. Louis, he does recall

an individual by the name of RUSSELL BYERS as

a well-known

thief and fence.

At the conclusion of interview, Mr. BENDER stated that in

retrospect and in light of today's climate, the information

concerning MARTIN LUTHER KING in the memorandum of 3/19/74

should have been acted upon.

Mr. KENNEDY was unable to provide an evaluation of the

information and he is sure that no other information concerning

KING was furnished to him by O'HARA. He can make no comment

with regard to the credibility of the information at this late

date. He does not believe, however, that credibility of either

O'HARA Or BYERS entered into any decision or lack of decision

with regard to dissemination of the information concerning KING.

KENNEDY recalls, however, from his many years of service

in the FBI at St. Louis that RUSSELL BYERS was a well-known

fence.

KENNEDY

reiterated that he has

no idea or reason for the

failure to disseminate the information contained in paragraph

2 of page 3 of the cited memorandum as it relates to MARTIN

LUTHER KING.

He noted that there is nothing written on the

memorandum to indicate such dissemination was made or action

taken otherwise.

Mr. KENNEDY's attention was further directed to a hand-

states, "Notify locals of info re killing." He identifies

this notation as being in the handwriting of his former Supervisor,

ROBERT I.. BENDER.

Area Man Allegedly

By J, PULITZER

Of the Post-Dispatch Staff

A 46-year-old Rock Hill man has told

the House Select Committee on Assassi-

nations that he was once offered $50,000

to kill the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King

*Jr., the New York Times reported today.

Russell G. Byers, a former auto parts

dealer who was implicated last January,

in the theft of several statues trom the

St. Louis Art Museum, said he turned

down the offer in late 1966 or early 195%,

according to the Times. King was shot to

(death on April 4, 1968, in Memphis, Tenn.

The Times story said Byers told the

committee that two men from Imperial,

Mo., had offered him the money in

behalf of a group of conservative busi-

Endssmen to kill King. Both are now dead.

Sources said Byers' testimony has

An FBI spokesman in-Vashington told

last March.

The spokesman took pains to

suggest the information may not have

been considered reliable.

A Post-Dispatch reporter who attempt-

ed to interview Byers at his residence in

the 9300 block of Fredric Court was told

that Byers was out of town and was not

cavallable for comment.

The Times account of a three-month

investigation by the House committes

ndicated that investigators suspected

that word of a contract offer on King's

life had reached the prison through

Spica. But Byers said he had told Spica

of the offer only recently, according; to

the Times.

Records from the State -Penitentiary

indicate that Spica and James Earl Ray

shared the same cell block, and for. a

Byers also told the House committee

that he had told an informer for the

Federal Bureau of Investigation about

the $50,000 offer to kill King, the Times

said.

had been given details of the offer, but

had never investigated, according to the

Confirms Byers Told Of King Offer

By WILLIAM FREIVOGEL

and CARTER STITI

Of the Post-Dispatch Staff

A reputable. St. Louisan confirms that

Russell G. Byers told him that he had,

been offered $50,000 by two Imperial,

Mo., men to arrange the death of the

Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King.

Byers twice mentioned the plot, first in

generalities shortly after the assassina-

tion in 1968 and later in more detail in

about 1974, the St. Louisan told the Post-

Dispatch. He said that in the latter

conversation Byers told uf a stockbroker

taking him to the Imperial farm of a

patent lawyer to discuss the plot.

• Byers did not use naines, the promi-

nent citizen said, but he apparently yas

relerring to stockoroker John k. naull-

Emann and lawyer John H. Sutherland,

whom he has accused of the plot in

recent testimony to the House Assassina-

tions Committee.

Previous accounts of the alleged assas!!

sination plot have said that Byers haf

said that he told two lawyers and other

unidentified persons about it some years

ago. But this is the first direct confirma-

tion from one of those persons.

In another development, a Clayten

lawyer, who has been questioned by the

House Assassinations Committee staff,

bi revealed. One insisted that is dens

piper not even identify his . "uption,

apparently because he feared reprisis

itom Byers or other.

The House Assassinations Committee

is conducting an intensive investigation

into Byers' allegations. It held ciosed

hearings on them last week. Byers was

reported to have told the committee that

he turned down the offer from Suther-

land and Kauffmann, which he says was

made in late 1956 or early 1967. Suther-

land died in 1970, and Kauffman died in

1973.

The St. Louisan said that Byers told

him shortly after the King assassination

i 1968 that he might know somethin

about it, and that the Ku Klux Klan o1

some organization was behind it.

"That's all he said. I thought it was

just street talk," the St. Louisan said.

Later, in about 1974, Byers mentioned

the plot again. The St. Louisan gave this

account of what he said: A stockbroker

who had lost his license, apparently

Kauffmann, approached Byers with the

$50,000 offer. Byers asked him whom he

had to kill. Kauffmann took Byers i0 a

St. Louis patent attorney who lived on a

nearby farm in Imperial who said King

was the target. Byers said he never had

byers was particulariy close to Kauff-

in his recent statements reportedly told

lated whether he could have transmitted

word of the $50,000 offer to Ray.

1. The St. Louisan said he believed Byers

ther lied," he said. But in the. wake of

Byers' arrest in connection with thefts of

winter, he said he wondered whether

get the Federal Bureau of Investigation i'

or the police to ease off him. Byers was!

not prosecuted for the museum thefts.

The St. Louisan refused to say whether

the House committee has questioned

him.

The Clayton lawyer knew Kauffmann

quite well in the late 1950s and early,

1960s when Kauffmann was a stockbrok-

er in Clayton and a client. Kauffmann

galso entertained the lawyer at his Jeffer-

¡son County home.

The lawyer said tht Kauffmann, long

yactive on the periphery of Democratic

politics in Si. Louis and Jefferson coun-

ties, had been involved in the presiden-

tial campaign of Alabama Gov. George

C. Wallace in 1968. Sutherland also was a

leader of the Wallace campaign here.

The lawyer said he thought only money

promise of it

"John was not a racist." he said

""He was growing old and a little;

member of the St. Louis Stock Ex-

change. But when he died his estate was

worth only $10,000.

Kauffmann made his living in the 1960s

by selling so-called "penny stocks," the

lawyer recalled. For example, Kauff.

mann would start a company with

capital of about one-cent per share and

then sell stock for $1 per share.

There was nothing illegal about that

when Kauffmann was involved, the law-

yer said, but changes in the securities

laws in later years put an end to penny

stocks and to Kauffman's main source of

income.

The lawyer said he always found Byers

to be truthful and could see no advantage

to Byers in telling about the alleged plot.

The lawyer said he thought the plot was

plausible. He represented Byers in a.

civil case about five years ago.

So far, there has been no corroboration

of Byers' allegation or any credible link

to lay. The wives of both Sutherland and

Kauffmann have told the House commit-

lecithat they knew nothing about suchia

plot and branded as incredible the idya

ahst their hussands could be involved in

a scheme to assassinate Dr. King.

said.

In his testimony, Byers speculated

that he was offered the $50,000 to ar-

"fall guy"

who would not actually

commit the murder, but who could be

blamed for it later because of the al-

Spica said.

"The investigators in Washington know

all about Byers' story and they have

checked it out and they know there's no

truth in it," Spica said.

He said that an investigator had talked

to him but had informed him that he

would not be called before the House

Spica, who was paroled in 1973, ap-

peared nervous and shaken and said he

' feared news stories about Byers' allega-

tions would destroy his present life:

"You know I'm out on a life parole on

a'murder case, and this'll blow it," Spica

said. "I've been working in this stand 12

nice girl who doesn't

"I guess I'll just to close up because I

won't have any business any more,"

Spica said.

Byers also told the House committee

that he had told an informer for the

Federal Bureau of Investigation about

the $50,000 offer to kill Ring, the Times

said.

Byers said the FBI office in St. Louis

had been given details of the offer, but

had never investigated, according to the

Times report.

A source close to the St. Louis FBI

office told the Post-Dispatch that he had

never heard of the information on the

alleged approach to Byers

In. Washington, FBI spokesman Homer

Boynton told the Post-Dispatch that

"certain information relating to the Mar-

tin Luther King assassination" was

furnished to the St. Louis FBI office in

"We're not saying that it was reliable

information," he said. "We're just say-

ing certain information was furnished."

He declined to say whether the informa-

Boynton said the information was

never investigated by the St. Louis

office. He said it was not cross-indexed

under the Martin Luther King file, as it

should have been.

Last March, Boynton said, St. Louis

FBI agents discovered the material

more or less by accident.

"They were reviewing a file in connec

tion with another matter,

as a result of that,

they found the

information and realized that it had

never been properly indexed. And they

immediately advised FBI headquar-

* Boynton said the St. Louis field office

then sent the information to FBI head-

quarters in Washington. FBl headquar

ters in turn gave it to the Department o

of the FBI agent in St. Louis who

handied it.

"It's kind.of hard to tell what judg

ment the agent and the supervisor madet

about the reliability" of the information;

Boynton said, "In the Kennedy investiga-

tion, we checked out thousands and

thousands of these. Some of them were

very bizarre. And many of them ended inj

absolutely nothing. And it could have

been the judgment of the agents that this

was not worthy of following through on:"

Boynton said he could not discuss the!

specifics of the allegations as reported ini

the Times.

He said the FBI is not currentlyl

investigating the information. that was!

furnished in 1973. He said the agency had

-an agreement with the House committee

that the committee would investigate

such leads unless the panel asked the

FBI for help.

A member of the House committee's

staff in Washington,said it was commit-

tee policy not to confirm or deny reports

about matters related to the King and

Kennedy assassinations, He said the

committee's findings would be contained

J in its final report to Congress, which is

due by the end of the year.

"I just can't comment," the staff

BEYERS inquired is to whether he knew anyone by the name

O2 EUGENG ZIGZIR who lives sonewhere in West st. Louis

County.

Bless reierred to him as an old men, believed

by him to nave stolen some paintings in florida.

BEYERS

said he intended to lind out whether the man had the paint

•inga and ii so, he intended to have them stolen fon hin.

About one nonth prior to the date of the reported

buxgiary of the Jefferson Memorial, St. Louis, in which sev

eral items of Lindbergh trophies were inken, exact dete not

recalled, BEVERS came to his shop asking him il he was in

cerested in buying uny articles from the jellerson Memorial,

commenting specilically that he had in mind some "commemore.

tive pieces" that were included in the Lindbergh trophies.

Informant said he told him this would be "too hot to handle"

WhereuDon BEYERS said they could be used to "get up enemies"

by "gtashing them in the trunk of somebody's car".

Informant

said he told BEYERS he was not interested in that kind of

job since he had been in trouble once (robbery of rour Seasong

Antique Shop) and did not care to get in that kind of trouble

again. Within several days, informant heard the news of the

breakin of the Jefferson Menorial and the theft of several

¿tens there.

A day or two alter that publicity, BEXERS came

¿o informant's shop, advising that "now live got my hands

full - l've got a lot of problens". intormant recalled that

Li appeared BEYERS had not shaven for several days. Ordin

RAXILY, BEYERS i9 & very conservatir, well-dressed person.

BEYERS never again nentioned the Jefferson Memorial

..Ltems, and he never mentioned same to BEYERS, despite the

recent publicity.

He Lirmly believes that BEYERS at one time had

both these tens and the Norman Rockwell painting &nd may

st11] have same.

He does not believe that BEYERS would ever

coness to anything, BEYERS having told him on one occasion

that the police would never get anywhere with him since he

absolutely would never talk, even if confronted with informa-

tion Iron other sources attributed to him.

BEYERS is curther described as follows:

Enclosed herewith are 4 copies of an IHM in which

the results of an interview of former SA HAROLD R. DOBSON

(1941 - 1972), who was case agent in captioned matter, by

staff employees of the House Select Committee on Assassinations

in Washington, D. C. on 6/28/78, are set out. The interview

was voluntary on the part of Mr. DOBSON, in accordance with

current cooperative Bureau policy and was conducted by MICHAEL

EBERHARDT, Assistant Deputy Chief Counsel to the Committee. An

unknown female in her mid to late 20s was in the room during

the interview. She was originally introduced by EBERHARDT but

no mental note as to her name was made as it was assumed she

was a stenographer.

She was later observed to be taking notes

in longhand, from which it was presumed she was another staff

attorney.

The interview was preceded by a conference with SA

JAY ALDHIZER, and a legal briefing by SA RON HELLER, at the

Bureau.

SA ALDHIZER was telephonically given a summary of

the interview immediately upon its completion.

No indication was given that Mr. DOBSON would be

requested to appear before the Committee in executive or

public session.

July 24, 1978

HOUSE SELECT COMMITTEE ON ASSASSINATIONS

Former Special Agent Harold R. Dobson (1941 - 1972),

residence: 8831 Bracken Circle, St. Louis, Missouri

63123 ,

who was St. Louis case Agent on the M. L. King - James Earl Ray

case in 1968, was interviewed, not under oath, by Mr. Michael

Eberharat, Assistant Deputy Chief Counsel to the House Select

Committee

on Assassinations, at the offices of that committee,

Room 3386, Second and "D" Streets, Southwest, Washington, D. C.,

from 2:00 P.M. to 2:45 P.M. on the afternoon of June 28, 1978.g.

at which time he furnished the following information in response

to direct questions:

Dobson served as a Special Agent of the Federal Bureau

of Investigation from October 20, 1941 to retirement on June 30:

1972, being

assigned to the Boston, Newark, St. Paul, and St.

Louis Divisions.

He was in St. Louis from 1947 until retirement.

He was assigned to the Security Squad from 1948 to retirement,

concerned primarily with investigation of the Communist Party

and

its members, nationalistic tendency, espionage, sabotage, and

He had comparatively

little knowledge or experience regarding New Left, racial ana hate

group cases.

He was an alternate supervisor but declined

authorization as supervisor for personal reasons.

Dobson was generally aware of the existence of the

Cointel Program in St. Louis, but was unable to recall any

specific activities, objectives, or accomplishments of same.

Dobson was unable to suggest why the case was assigned

to him, except that he had the first st. Louis lead in the case,

to trace the weapon used through officials of Browning Arms

Company, with whom he had continuing liaison, and for the further

reason he had been utilized in an administrative capacity on

virtually every major case of national importance in the St.

Louis Division beginning with the surveillance and apprehension

of St. Louis Communist Party leaders in 1952. Another Special

Agent since retired handled the Ray penitentiary escape-case

prior to the assassination.

Special Agent in Charge Thomas Gearty supervised the

King case in St. Louis.

It was Dobson's responsibility to

coordinate the investigation, handle the resulting "mountain of

paper"

, see that obvious, logical, reasonable, or merely

desirable leads or avenues of investigation were appropriately

assigned (with Special Agent in Charge approval), promptly and

adequately covered, and properly reported, and to keep the

Special Agent in Charge, Bureau, Memphis, and other interested

offices promptly advised of pertinent developments.

Until the true identity of Ray was established, every

Special Agent in the St. Louis Division was assigned exclusively

to the case.

Twenty-four hour coverage of all leads was

mandatory.

Developments of the day were discussed, and "brain

busting"

sessions were held at nightly conferences

of all

Special Agents, at which most new assignments were made. All

employees clearly gave of their best efforts.

Dobson was unable to recall specifically what efforts

were made to determine the whereabouts of John Ray on the day

of the assassination. He suggested the file would be the best

evidence in this regard. He believed the possibility of John

Ray's involvement was unãoubtedly recognized and that appropriate

steps were taken to resolve.

Dobson was unable to recall any surreptitious entries

to Ray's relatives' premises.

St. Louis had no technical

surveillances on relatives.

Requests for authorization for

same may have been made, but if so, were without his knowleage.

To the extent of his knowledge, the 'St. Louis Division

had never placed a technical surveillance on king..

Toll call records of relatives were obtained in

accordance with a then current Bureau policy subpoena process.

Relative bank accounts were monitored and results set forth in

reports with a statement that the information would only be

available after issuance of a subpoena duces tecum. Coverage of

relatives consisted of this, plus personal interviews and contacts

:.

HOUSE SELECT COMMITTEE ON ASSASSINATIONS

with informants, sources, neighbors, and associates, and

available public records.

Relatives were initially uncooperative in varying

degrees, but subsequently became generally cooperative,

although Dobson never fully trusted any of them. He was unable

to recall any evidence developed that Ray was ever in St. Louis

territory, or in contact with any relatives there,

subsequent to

his penitentiary escape. He doubted financial contributions to

Ray by them, as their combined incomes and assets, in nis

estimation, were insufficient to support the life

style Ray

apparently enjoyed following his escape.

Dobson had no knowledge or any information as to the

source of Ray's income following his escape.

He conjectured

the same would have logically had to result

• from successful

criminal activity or be contributed by an unknown person or

He recognized Ray's record stamped him as a "loser",

but opined it was not beyond the realm of possibility access

less unsuccessful than himself could have enhanced the quality

of Ray's thought processes to a point where he could have

conceived and carried out a successful supermarket or other

similar robbery.

At least his escape was successful.

He

considered Ray's technically proper preparation and filing of a

motion for a new trial, which was pending at the time of his

escape, as evidence of

as a Missouri prosecutor prior to entering the Bureau, he had

uniformly recommended alternative punishment for non-habitual

criminals, as the Missouri Penitentiary, even then, was generally

considered a "finishing school for criminals".

offered the possibility of being almost as lucrative as banks,

without the disadvantage of incurring Federal jurisdiction. He

feels sure major police departments in the St. Louis territory

had been contacted to determine if Ray could be a logical

suspect in unsolved supermarket robberies.

He recalled some

indication Ray might have been involved in a bank robbery in

Alton, Illinois and that the Springfield, Illinois Division had

been so advised, but he had no knowledge as to the outcome of

investigation there.

Dobson was generally aware of the existence of white

hate organizations, but was of the opinion members of such

organizations in St. Louis territory lack sufficient organization,

intelligence, and financial capability for significant

involvement in the king killing.

such organizatIons, In nis

estimation, should have been

able to reasonably forësee,

King's death would elevate him to the status of a martyr,

which would have been counterproductive to their aims and

purposes.

He was of the further opinion that any intelligent

co-conspirator would undoubtedly have eliminate Ray as a

security measure.

He suggested that, if then current rumors

that King had become a liability to the Southern Christian

Leadership Conference were true, that organization had the most

to gain from King's demise.

All St. Louis informants, potential informants and

sources regarding criminal, security, racial, hate group, or

other matters, were under continuing instructions to immediately

report even the slightest information which they could obtain

or which might come to their attention regarding the King case.

Dobson recalled John Gawron as an elderly, self-

confessed habitual criminal, who had lived with Ray's mother

several years until her death. He never met, saw, or talked

to

Gawron.

If Gawron was initially carried as a PCI, but later

appeared openly, Dobson was unable to recall why, but suggested

Gawron may have initially indicated some potential for

furnishing information regarding current criminal matters and

was later found incapable of doing so.

Having lived with Ray's

mother, Gawron was undoubtedly able to furnish some factual

personal history and background information as to the family

in the past, but it was Dobson's impression that Gawron was not

fully trusted by them and was capable of furnishing only

conjectural information as to their then current activities.

according to Agents handling Gawron, he would start with a half-

truth or conjecture, and embroider upon it, and therefore was

considered generally to be unreliable.

St. Louis Agents contacting released fellow inmates

were instructed to not only obtain all possible information as

to Ray's whereabouts, but all possible information as to their

degree of association with him, his sentiments, his plans, the

identities of any associates or friends either in or out of

prison, and the manner of his escape.

Dobson was unable to recall any telephonic contacts

with the Memphis case agent, although there may have been one

or two. He was in frequent telephonic contact with the

Chicago Assistant Special Agent in Charge, who was handling

the case there, as Jerry Ray made at least one trip to visit

St. Louis relatives.

Dobson never met, saw, or spoke with any Ray relatives,

with the exception of Jerry Ray who contacted him telephonically

on two or three occasions during a visit to St. Louis pursuant

to instructions from the Chicago Division.

Dobson had no idea as to the basis for any friction

which may have existed between Director Hoover and King.

Mr.

Hoover never confided in Dobson and never sought his advice.

letters which he claimed were from JAMES EARL RAY and were

addressed to a Mississippi attorney. These letters

were

purportedly given to HUIE by the attorney.

HUIE told them

this he has agreed to underwrite the costs of RAY's

detense in the forthcoming murder trial in Memphis, Tennessee.

The aforementioned letters were writted on half sheets of

Both of the KLINGEMANs characterized JAMES EARL

believe that they would recognize this person's voice if they

heard it again.

In conversation with Mr. HUIE, the KLINGEMANS

received the following information on a confidential basis and

advised that they were rather reluctant to divulge it,

but felt that it was their duty as citizens.

that this information bemintained on a confidential basis within

the FBI.

They advised that they contacted Chief DERNING

because of his reputation and are now following his advice in

furnishing this information to the FBI:

Mr. HUIE sowed the KLINGEMANs letters from RAY in

which RAY listed employment at the Indian Trail Restaurant.

(It should be noted that this restaurant is an old, large,

upper class restaurant, of excellent reputation. Chief

DERNING advised that the KLINGEMANs themselves have an

excellent reputation within the community and that he holds

them in very high regard). HUIE told them that RAY had

which one.

12 hersey bars in anticipation that he would have to go

without food for, some time.

RAY also had $300 in his shoe.

He escaped in abed truck and walked to Chicago, Illinois,

from Jerterson City,

; Missouri, which took him about eight

days. (The KLINGEMANs do recall that when the subject first

appered at the restaurant, his feet were swollen and that

their sister-in-law gave him two Ace bandages to use which he

returried three or four days later... This supposedly was

mentioned in the letter in HUIE's possession).

Thereafter, RAY read the advertisement in the

Tribune wherein the KLINGEMANs had advertised for help in the

restaurant.

HUIE said that the subject in the letter

NW 68262 Docld:32989797 Page 159

---

## Page 160

CG 44-1114

mentioned that the employment at the Indian Trail Restaurant

was the "high point of his life".

HUIE mentioned that RAY had had only three jobs

in his life, one of which was in a shoe factory outside of

East St. Louis, Illinois, which is prior to his going to

prison the last time.

was employed at the restaurant, he was "tapped on the shoulder"

by an individual who recognized him and who threatened to

reveal his identity to the policè and cause RAY's return to

Prison if he, RAY, did not work for this person. HUIE said

that RAY was given $1,200 during the initial contacts, by the

alleged conspirators, and was ultimately paid $15,000, but

was due to receive more.

Again, according to HUIE, RAY was told to go to

Canada to investigate the difficulty of crossing the border.

Supposedly RAY made two trips through the Detroit Tunnel into

Canada. He also made a

third trip to Canada, date and

sequence not given, and "was instructed' to obtain a 40-year-

old newspaper, get

the names of the males born that dte,

and search the current phone directory for similar names.

He was then to surveil the individuals with similar names to

determine whether or not his physical description was

similar to theirs.

Thereafter he telephoned persons of his

like description,

utilizing a pretext, and thereby found a mai

who had never applied for a passport. RAY then applied for a

passport in this name.

The KLINGEMANs advised that they were not sure that

they were furnishing this information in its proper

sequence, but that to the best of their recollection, the

information preceding and following was given to them in this

order by HUll.

Thereafter, RAY was given more money to

purchase a Mustang which was to be driven to Acapulco, mexico,

for the purpose of obtaining a tourist

sticker.

le then.

drove through Mexico to the West Coast and hid out there to

receive further instructions from the other individuals in

the alleged conspiracy. HUIE stated that RAY was flown to

ts no atin the let sen bat the came or not tents theo

told to be in Mississippi at a certain time and plaçe.

Supposedly Reverend MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR. was at a. Holiday

Inn Motel in Atlanta, Georgia, when RAY was flown there.

TW 68262 Docld:32989797 Page 160

CG 44-1114

subsequently, RaY was given money to obtain binoculars

and a shotgun and was to go to Memphis to be somewhere at

3 p.m. in room 312 or 313.

Sapposedly there were other

individuals who also came to this room and there was a

Negro male who purportedly called KING out to the balcony.

According to HUIE, the actual murderer of KING was not RAY,

although RAY was present and at a later time (probably the trial)

RAY will identify the murderer. RAY did pick up the rifle, ran

to his car, and sped to a rendezvous in Atlanta, Georgia.

He was supposed to pick up a "bundle of money", however,

the

conspirators did not appear. RAY allegedly spent several days

or hours at this apartment in Atlanta, Georgia, awaiting the

arrival of his "fellow conspirators"

According to HULE, the plan was for RAY to go to

Mexico, but immediately fly north to throw off pursuit and

to steer all investigation to Mexico.

However,

since

the conspirators did not appear in Atlanta, RAY fled to. Calda

thereater utilizing his knowledge to obtain a passport and

fled to England.

The KLINGEMANs advised that the rest of HUIE's story

substantially follows the newspaper accounts which appeared

after subject RAY's arrest in England. They did note that

HUlE stated that RAY did rob a bank in London because he

HUTE at no time identified the

alleged fellow conspirators of RAY. He did swear the KLINGEMANS

to secrecy and told then that he would nail. the "Look"

November 10,1900,

Both Mr. and Mrs.

KLINGEMAN advised that they would

make these proofs available to

te interviewing Agents for review.

The KLINGEMANs advised that RAY began working for

them as a dishwasher and because of his excellent attitute

was advanced to cook's helper.

During the time ha was in

their employ, they did not observe him in a car, nor did they

know him to own, an autonobile. He had no visitors, he did

not wear glasses, he had no women friends, nor did he make

any advances toward the female personnel employed at the

restaurang and they noted that his hair was "less bushy" during

the time he was at the restaurant than shown in the

photographs.

They are not sure how he came to work from his

apartment, but believe hemight have beenimet at the Eden's

Expressway by WILLIE PERRY and FRED BURNS, who were also

employees at the restaurant.

His conduct was excellent and they cannot recall

him making any comments ona way or another about members of

the Negro race and specifically no comments whatsoever con-

cerning MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR. RAY made no referénce to his

previous employent, but did mention that he

was in.

Brimerhaven, Germany, during World War II.

They advised that

when RAY received the phone call's during his last week of

employment he seened to be disturbed and that his

concentration on his work was not as good as it usually was.

They then recalled that according to HUIE, that when

JAMES BAR' RAY left England, he was going to Lisbon to get to

Africa, however, he was unable. to do so which is when he returned

to England and held up a bank receiving about $200 in loot.

They again stated that the information furnished to them by

HUTE came from letters which RAY had written to his attorney, who

in turn turned them over to the author.

Also Mr. KLINGEMAN

i stated that in one of the letters which he

believed was to

the attorney from RAY, while he was in London, England, there

Diversey Street and sheffield avenue in chicago, ritinois.

At the conclusion of the interview, the Klingemans

again requested that this information be maintained in

In the couse of a file review in an unrelated

137-36945. 315 evere iS lee tale a contrite

This file contained a contact

memorandum dated March 19, 1974, which contained information

relating to several criminal matters and also contained the

following paragraph:

"During the Fall of 1973, five or six months ago,

date not recalled, Beyers came to the shop inquiring as

to whether they could get together to talk, and they later

did so at Pizza and Cream, Clayton, Mo., in the area of a

Broad-Dugan Paint Store, where informant had traveled on

business.

Beyers talked freely about himself and his

business, and they later went to informant's house where

Beyers told a story about visiting a lawyer in St. Louis

County, now deceased, not further identified, who had

offered to give him a contract to kill Martin Luther King.

He said that also present was a short, stocky man, who

walked with a limp. (Later, with regard to the latter

individual, Beyers

commented that this man was actually

the individual who made the payoff of James Earl Ray after

the killing.) Beyers said he had declined to accept this

contract.

He did remark that this lawyer had confederate

flags and other items about the house that might indicate

that he was 'a real rebel'. Beyers also commented that

he had been offered either $10,000 or $20,000 to kill King."

Extensive further research in the St. Louis indices

and files failed to reveal this information was

If any way

most of this period.

The allegation involved an incident which allegedly

took place at a roll-call time in the First District Office

sonetime in the fall of 1965. Reportedly making the allega-

tion was Clifton Baird, white male, 50, a retired Louisville

police officer who retired in 1975 after 27 years of service.

Also present was Chief of Dotcctives, Major Robert Gregory,

Captain Priest !1. Fry, formerly Chief of Detectives and possiblY

the Captain of the First District; Lieutenant James Bibb, a

uniformed First District Lieutenant; Sergeant Brent Hardin, a

Third District Sergeant; possibly Herman Mitchell, Homicide

Squad; Licutenant Vernon Austin;

and possibly Robert E. Peters

(SA), formerly of the Louisville Division of the FBI.

in the FBI mail an Associated Press clipping about a Clifton

an offer to kill Dr. Martin Luther King.

The clipping came

in the regular FBi mail and Duncan stated he did not know who

sent it to him.

A few days later, while on the phone to ex-FBI Supervisor

Robert E. Peters in Louisville regarding a social engagement,

Duncan asked him about the clipping and who Clifton Baird was

and what the clipping referred to.

Peters said Baird was a

tall, heavy-set man who was in the Vice Squad for a while and

that Duncan should have known him from seeing him in the Vice

Squad while Duncan worked with the Detective Bureau in Louis-

ville.

Approximately April 25, 1977, FBI Headquarters sent a

communication to Louisville and St. Louis FBI Offices request-

ing the present locations of former Special Agent in Charge of

Louisville, Bernard C. Brown; Supervisor Robert E, Peters;

and SA William R. Duncan as they were named by former Police

Officer Clifton Baird alleging improprieties in the Martin

Luther King assassination case.

SA Duncan initially had no recollection of the incident

and he called former SA Peters at Louisville and asked him if

he knew anything about this.

Peters replied that he haû no

idea.

Duncan later called

retired Police Captain John Hampton

of Louisville, a close personal friend, to determine it he

Knew anything about this.

Hampton advised he did not know

but would ask and find out what he could and call Duncan.

later called back and gave the namos. of some police officers

who had been interviewed and named former Major Priest M. Fryi

former Major Robert Gregory; Lieutenant James Bibb; Sergeant

Brent Hardin and Lieutenant Vernon Austin. Hampton apparently

talked to Austin and advised that he had learned that the event

was supposed to have taken place in the First District Offices

sometime in 1964 or 1965. Duncan called Lieutenant Vernon

Austin, whom he had known for 25 years, and asked him about the

matter. Austin related to Duncan who the Committee had asked

about and generally who was supposed to be present when the

alleged offer took place.

Duncan told the investigators that he had no recollection

concerning this matter and that he had in fact not slept and

walked the floor a number of nights for approximately ten days

to two weeks. At this time he recalled one night that Sergeant

William Baker of the first District Vice Squad met him in the

Duncan to help him, with a joke with a couple of officers

at the First District. Duncan was told to go to the roll-call

at roll-aall time and say that he had heard that there was a

$250,000 or $500,000 reward for the death of Di, Martin Iuther

King and was to add to or verify something that had already

Duncan recalled going down to the area and making

the general statenent that he had heard that there was a

$250,000 or $500,000-price on DI. Martin Iuther Fing from

either the Ku Klux Klan or the Connunist Party.

Duncan added

if verification was wanted, one should contact Bob Peters or

B. C. Brown of the FBI.

Duncan did not Iccall who was there except several

uniformed officers who were coming and going and that there

were several in the area.

There were a number of questions

regarding whether It was a big 10ll call area or the Captain's,

Sergeant's, Lleutenant's offices or a hallway. Duncan was

asked whether or not there were three or a dozen people present

and Duncan replied that there could have been between three

and twelve people, exact number unrecalled.

Duncan was asked whether Eob Peters was there. Duncan

said he did not rocall his being there, otherwise he would

not have made the statement that "if you want to verify the

price on Dr. Martin luther King contact Bob Peters or B. C.

BrOWn.*

Duncan identified one person he thought was there as

Arlie Blaire (because Duncan had heard that he was supposed

to

have been there from the questions asked). Duncan recalled a

younger, red-haired officer with a crew-cut or brush-cut.

Duncan said he had talked to Bluite and possibly his partner

in connection with a fugitive nuider case that duncan was

working.

Duncan was asked about his relationship with Robert Peters

and also with Fry, Hardin, Gregory, Bibb, Austin, Herman

Mitchell, John Mitchell and B. C. Brown of the FBI.

The Committee Investigators apparently could not under-

stand why Duncan could not remember who was at the meeting.

They asked Duncan about an attempted bombing of Sergeant Brent

Hardin's car and if Duncan worked on the case.

buncan recalled

a bomb being placed on Hardin's car but that it apparently did

not go off.

On November 29, 1977, Duncan again contacted Committee

Staff Members Mrs. Sheila

Lee, Mir. Michael Everhart and Mr.

Hilliam Hebb.

Duncan told them that he had recalled that he might have

knoin Aaron Duke, Arlic Blaire's partner.

Duncan recalled a

person described as a white male, in his

late 30's or early

10's as of 1965 or 1966, stocky, not fat, with gray cropped

hair, approximately 5' 10" and 180-185-190 pounds.

Duncan advised that he had no first-hand knowledge of

DI. King and Mr. Hoover's difficulty but that he had heard

runors about it and had a faint collection that he may have

mentioned this at the time he told of the fu flux Rlan and/or

the Comunist Party rumor in the First District Police area.

Dincan told them that he did not tell soneone of his

recollection as a joke earlier because when the communication

was received fron the Burcau, it was pointed out that he would

be contacted regarding the matter by the Committee Investiga

tors and that he would at that time be briefed by legal personnel

fIon FBIHQ.

Duncan was asked if

he had discussed this matter with

anyone outside the Bureau and his family. Duncan told them

he had talked one time with Lieutenant Vernon Austin by phone

and he did not discuss the joke other than ask if it coula

have been a joke.

Duncan told then he had discussed it with

Robert Peters at

lcast on three occasions. Once when it came

to his attention fron a newspaper clipping, once when he re-.

ceived a communication from FBI Headquarters, and one time after

he realizod that it was & joke, at which time he told Peters

(Peters) and B. C. Brown had nothing to do with it.

Duncan was asked about their get-together for the football

gamc on Lovember 11-12, 1977. Duncan told them that Duncan

and Peters seriously considered not getting together for this

year's football game but decided

since they had known each

other for 25 years and had plans to attcud this football gaue

for over a year, that they would go ahead and get together.

They agreed not to discuss the matter, however.

Duncan also told them that when he realized that it was

a joke and that he was involved, he contacted a long-time

personal friend and lawyer to assist in the analysis and action

regarding the entire matter.

HOUSE SELECT COMMITTEE ON ASSASSINATIONS,

U. S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,

INTERVIEW OF SPECIAL AGENT WILLIAM R. DUNCAN

The Investigators asked if Duncan would be represented

by Counsel before the Committee and Duncan replied he would

not.

On the night of November 29, 1977, Duncan went back to

the Washington Mational Airport to pick up his luggage.

While there, a flight from Louisville came in and he saw

his long-time friend, P.M. Fry, with whom he shook hands.

Accompanying Fry was Ileutenant James Bibb whom Duncan did

not recall for a minute, and former Police Officer Arlie

Blaire came up to Duncan and at this time was

recognized as being a former Louisville Police Officer. At

this time SA DUNCAN realized BIAIRE was not the red-headed

person he thought that he had remembered at the First District

office.

Blaire volunteered to Duncan that he knew Duncan only

professionally and that he had been discharged

for being an

alcoholic, that he had cured himself without going to Alço-

holics Anonymous and he was there at the request of the

Committee. He was asked by Duncan if he ever recalled working

on the Nashan Lane murder case.

He did recall this.

He was

asked what his partner, Aaron

Duke, looked like and he gave

a description meeting the one Duncan had recalled. He also

advised that they rode in car 102 rather than car 101.

On November 30, 1977, Duncan brought the atorementioned

airport meeting to the attention of Mr. Michael Everhart and

Mr. Edward Evans of the Committee staff.

Duncan appeared before the House Sub-Committee on

Növember 30, 1977. The Committee members present part or

full time were Mr. Louis Stokes; Mr. Walter E. Fauntroy;

Brathwaite Burke; and possibly Harold I. Ford.

Mr. Michael Everhart of the Committee staff questioned

Duncan.

At this time Duncan asked Mr. Fauntroy if he would be

out of order if he asked when this incident was supposed to

have taken place and who was present. Mr. Fauntroy advised

that he would be out of order.

Duncan was asked how long he had been in Louisville,

Kentucky, and if he knew P. M. Fry, Robert Gregoryr James BiDD,

Dancan was asked if he thought that the incident was

an offer by the FBI to kill DI. King.

Duncan replied that

it definitely was not. However, it vas in poor taste and

something that should not have occurred.

He was asked his

definition of a joke and duncan gave his definition of a joke

as sonathing nade in fun. He was asked several times regard-

ing the anonymous muspaper clipping suddenly appearing in the

FBI mail, and was this not a crack-pot way of doing things.

He added that Congressmen frequently receive anonymous itens

in the mail also.

Mr. Stokes asked if SA DUNCAN knew that Di. King had won

the lobel Peace Prize and that he preached peace wherever he

went. Duncan replic he did know, but did not know the date.

NI. Stokes stated that he thought the American public should

hear and judge this matter.

Duncan was asked where he was assigned and where he was

physically the date that Dr. King was killed. He replied he

was assigned to the St. Louis Division and at the Mexica,

Missouri, Residont Agency.

Mr. Everhart of the staff summed up the questioning by

asking if it was possible that P.M. Fry, Vernon Austin,

Robert Gregory, Brent Hardin, Herman Mitchell, Arlie Blaire,

and Robert Peters could have been present when the matter was

discussed regarding DI. King.

Duncan replied that it was pos-

sible, but he had no recollection of any of them, especially

Peters.

SA Duncan acknowledged linited participation as described

in instant incident, but stated this was done on his own ini-

tiative spontaneously and wanted it known the IBI as an organi-

zation had no involvement whatsoever.

Further, that he would

cooperate fully in resolving this matter satisfactorily.

Ar. Lehner requested Duncan not to contact any of the

never been made public befora,

including the contention that James

But some of the information sup-

King's murder:

Jerry Ray was praylowed ust

as saying that "Racal"' was

Ilographer, And Jerry Ray. has

provtously been quoted as saying,

"The whole thing about Raoul and

ruining drugs from Canada was a ®

-The quorations are contained In a

now book on the King assassination

written by George MeMilan. BRe

assumed he was delivering dope or some

"James is a crook," said Jerry Ray.

"He's been one since he got out of the

Army, to make money without working.

He thinks being a thief is an honorable

profession, but he never wanted to be

known as a murderer."

Post-Dispatch of how James Earl Ray

" found himself in Memphis at the time the

Rev. Dr. King was killed:

"After he escaped from the Missouri

Pénitentiary in 1967, he came to Chicago

and called me," said Jerry Ray. "He

Raoul told him to establish residence in

Birmingham and gave him $2000 to buy a

* "Raoul operated out of New Orleans.

From there he started sending James out

,across the country and into Mexico to

deliver cars. All over — Puerta Villarta,

Acapulco, the West Coast, New Orleans.

He was getting paid $1000 or $2000 a trip.

He figured the cars might be full of dope

but he didn't ask any questions. All he

cared about was that he had a job and

was getting paid good. It was better than

being in Jeff City, he told me. James told

me Raoul never talked politics, either."

•James Earl Ray has said that a gun he

purchased was probably the one used to

kill Dr. King. This is his brother's

explanation:

"James tells me that one day Raoul

asked him to buy a gun in Alabama and

bring it to Memphis. At this point James

thought Raoul might also be in the gun-

running business. He brought the gun to ai

Raoul. He said it wasn't the right kind.

So James went back and bought another

ine: Raoul said that was the right kind.

He picked it up from James at the new

Rebel Motel just across the Mississippi

Ene from Memphis.

"Then Raoul told James to move into a

boarding house in Memphis. In this job

James was always doing what he was

told. The money was good. James had

only been to Memphis once before in his

life. He kept getting lost there. He rented

the room in the name of Willard.

"Raoul came to the boardinghouse and

sent James out on several other errands

- to buy some binoculars and other

things. The afternoon Dr. King was shot,

Raoul told James he wanted to use the

Mustang that night.

"There were three keys to it. James

Kay Conspiracy Theories Tenuous,

BY WILLIAM FREIVOGEI

Of the Post-Dispatch Staff

PETROS, Tenn., June 16 - Little evi-

dence supports the notion so popular last

Saturday that James Dark Hay's escape

from Brushy Mountain Penitentiary in

Tennessee was the resuit of an elaborate

conspiracy aimed at allencing him,

Rather the escape Eriday evening

Dispatch earned yesterday that the 5290

But prison officials believe that fri

has tried to escape from authorities pat

least seven times in the last 20 years.

The evidence supporting the conspir

theory was considerably more com

pelling just after the break Friday

evening.

It was well known that Ray had spoken

five times-in recent weeks to investiga-

tors of the House Select Committee on

Assassinations, which is investigating

whether others were involved in the

assassination.

* Int addition, the escape itself was

ingenious, some aspects of it initially

defying explanation. How did the con-

victs construct and conceal the make-

shift ladder. used to scale the wall? And

how could Ray and the others have

scaled the 14-foot prison wall, avoided

two lengths of electrified barbed wire

and jumped to the other side before ever

drawing a shot from prison guards.

Five of the seven men who tried to

escape already were in the woods put of

sight of guards when the first shots were

fired, wounding the last man trying to

escape. That man was returned to the

prison with minor wounds.

or relatives could have got the money to

: Ray through the mail, which is uncen-

sored, or during visiting periods.

The officials note also that little else

about the prison break supports the

theory of an elaborate conspiracy. They

note that:

(1) There was nothing elaborate about

Ray's desperate 53-hour attempt to es-

cape by foot from the densely wooded

Tennessee mountains that surround the

i prison. Clever conspirators could have

extricated Ray from the woods, they say,

(2) The curlous occurences that coin-

cided with the escape, such as the loss of

site if

telephone service in the prison town of

Petros, have been explained satisfactor?

or the central intelligence Agency wa

been suspicion that one or both of those

agencies was involved in the assassina-

tion of the Rev: Dr. Martin Luther King

tactic the FBI or the CIA would use:

perative explained it this way:

Immediately after the escape a huge

steam whistle at the prison sounded the

warning that there had been an escape.

• A large number of the town's inhabitants

picked up their telephones to see what

had happened. The circuits were imme-

diately overloaded and the main breaker

in the telephone office opened just as a

circuit breaker opens in a house with an

overload.

The Petros office of the telephone

Ássassinations committee |)

to check on Ray's activities

escaped until he was identified as Dr. King's assassin a

By EDWARD W. O'BRIEN

Globe Democrat Washington Bureau Chiet

WASHINGTON - The House assassinations commit-

tee plans to investigate whether anyone helped James

Earl Ray escape from Missourt State Penitentiary or

elude recapture before he killed Dr. Martin Luther King:

The committee also told the House it must ascertain

the source of the money for Ray's spending from the

time of his escape from the Jefferson City prison until

his arrest in Europe 13 months later. s

MYSTERY STILL engulfs severat such key questions

despite previous investigations by federal, state, and

local agencies, the committee said in a 14-page report to

the House eted

The embattled committee, seeking a renewed House

charter and a $2.8 million appropriation, promised a

"horough, professional investigation" of the assassina-

tilns of Dr. King, the civil rights leader, in Memphis on

April 4, 1968, and of President John F. Kennedy in

Dallas on Nov. 22, 2963.

In the report summarizing its findings so far, the

committee claimed to have "new information" in both

investigations. It said it has made contact with

witnesses who were never interviewed or did not testify

previous y

In the King case, the committee recalled tliat Ray in

his escape from the Missouri prison on April 23, 1967,

"allegedly concealed himself in a large bread box which

was carried onto a truck from the prison bakery and

driven out of the prison."

«THE COMMITTEE intends to investigate whether

anyone aided Ray in his escape and whether this

assistance was connected to the assassination of Dr.

King," the report went on.

"It should be noted that a fellow Missouri inmate

related that Ray allegedly said while in prison that he

would kill Dr. King 'it the price was right and that Ray

intended to find a 'businessmen's association* which

allegedly had offered $100,000 for Dr. King's murder.

"Whether Ray ever made contact with such a group,

either during or after his imprisonment in Missourt, is a

question which has never been resolved.

*The committee intends to resolve it.

"The committee must investigate how Ray, who

fllegedly had made unsuccessful escape attempts in the

past, was able to escape, remain at large more that a

Year, and travel thraughout the United States and four

preign countries.

*The committed also will investigate what officgal

actions were made to apprehend Ray from the time he

year later, and. whether any official agencies deviated

(Indicate page, name of

newspaper, city and state.)

from their normal practices for pursuing a fugitive."

A RECENT JUSTICE Department task force report;

• the House committee said, "relied heavily on state-

ments by Ray's former prison cellmates (at Jefferson.

P4A, St. Louis

City) and acquaintances that he hated blacks generally,

Globe-Democrat,

Dr. King in particular, and intended to collect a bounty

for killing him."

""The department report, however, fails to note that

almost every one of these statements points at the same

time to the existence of a conspiracy," the committee

said.

Another "significant" mystery, the committee said, is

the source of the money — estimated at between $5,500

and 59,500 - which Ray spent as a fugitive from the

Missouri prison.

The only known source of cash was the $664 which Ray

earned as a dishwasher in a Chicago suburb during the

first eight weeks after his escape, the committee said.

The committee "has uncovered evidence that suggests

that Ray, between April 1967 and June 1968 "received

assistance from a person or persons presently un-

known," the House was told.

THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT report said. Ray was

helped as a fugitive by "at least one family member."

Within 15 days of the King murder, the committee

said, the FBl made up its mind that Ray was the kille

Thereafter, the committee said, the FBl failed to check

out every allegation of conspiracy "to the ultimale

degree."

A special report from the

Department of Justice to the

media this week reads in

part:

The purpose of the study

was to examine FBI activities

and to

evaluate the effectiveness of

tion. ""The report concluded

assassination in Memphis,

However, the report further

stated,

"The

Dr. King's widow, his

the

Rev.

Martin

members and civil rights

leaders have called the latest

report from the house com-

mittee "unacceptable'' to

them,

Shortly after this re-inves-

tigation into the King slaying

officially opened, it

was re-

ported by the media that

numerous documents perti-

nent to the King slaying case

were missing

from

government's file.

Last week human rights

activist

Dick

Gregory,

announced that he will

resume his hunger fast until a

"thorough and true" investi-

gation into Dr. King's slaying

is initiated - which should

include the necessary FBI and

other legal government and

official documents on the

King case.

• In addition to this, the U.S.

District Judge John Lewis has

ordered the FBI to file with

the National Archives all of

its tapes and documents

growing out of buggings and

wiretaps of Dr. King. Accord-

ing to the judge's previous

records, these materials could

not be made available to the

public for at least 50 years,

except by court order.

A couple of months ago, Ed

Redditt,

ex-police

detective in Memphis told the

National Inquirer Magazine in

s: interview that he and

another Black officer,

W.E.

demons, signed to police

delail on April 4, 1968. Fle

stated that when police

officials in Memphis learned

of the many threats against

Dr. King's life they "slashed

security from 10 men to two

men, instead of beefing it up.

"When Dr. King

was

murdered I was miles away -

and another officer on duty

with me that day (W.B.

Richmond) was missing from

the scene," Redditt said.

Redditt said despite his

protests that he had •a job to

do, he was ordered home and

Holloman (then the director

of the Memphis Police and

Fire Department) called in

two burly police officers ti

escort him there and standi

guard over him.

Redditt further stated that

it appeared, "as if the guards

were trying to keep me in the

house, rather than protect

me."

Attorney General Bell said

at a recent news conference,

although the report found no

evidence of FBI involvement

in the 1968 inurder case of

Di. King, the case was not

closed for the Justice Depart-

ment.

He said a final decision wi

be made when the House

Select Committee completes

its investigation of the killings

of both Dr. King and Pre-

sident John F. Kennedy.

Of a possible meeting with

Ray, Bell stated: "I'd either

go or send someone in whon!

I have absolute confidence."

Restrain FBI,

Kelley Says

Compiled From News Services

WASHINGTON, Feb. 19 - Federal Bureau of Investi

gation Director Clarence M. Kelly Jr. said Friday that

!!

Kelley expressed great satisfaction that a Justice

Department task force found the FBI had made a cred-

"table and thorough investigation of the King assassina-A

tion in 1S68.

"There are portions of the report which described |/

objectionable.actions on the part of the FBI," Kelley

said, referring to the task force's criticism of the FBI's

'tempt to "neutralize" the, Rev. Dr. King's role as a

civil rights leader.

A Justice Department task force investigating the

death of the Rev. Dr. King says evidence that James

Earl Ray was a lone assassin is convincing, although

his motive remains elusive.

In the report made public Friday, the task force

praised the FBI's original investigation of the Rev. Dr.

King's death in 1968, but said the Justice Department

failed to exercise proper supervision over the agency's

work.

The report said also that former FBI Director J.

Edgar Hoover inspired an improper and at times illegal

harassment campaign against the Rev. Dr. King in the

Hast five years of his life. But it recommended against

prosecutions in the campaign because Hoover and his

top aids are dead or retired.

Ray was acting alone on April 4, 1968 when he

gunned King down on a motel balcony in Memphis, the

report concluded. It said that FBI agents checked out I

conspiracy theories but found them groundless.

"The task force is satisfied that the FBI did a credi-

ble and thorough job in attempting to identify any possi-

ble conspiracy. In all the years following the assassina-

tion, the investigation has failed to reveal any connec-!

-tion. between any alleged conspirator and James Earl

But the report's authors list two loose ends, lack of a

clear motive for the shooting and an inabilty to learn

how Ray supported himself for a year before the Reva

Dr. King's death.

"Ray's apparent hatred for the civil rights move.

"ment, his possible yearning for recognition and a desire!

•for a potential quick proft may have, as a whole, pro

vided sufficient impetus for him to act and act alone,'

the report said.

Imprisoned in the Missouri State prison until his

escape in 1967, Ray took part in inmate speculation

jabout a bounty on the Rev. Dr. King's head. But the

report found no evidence proving that a bounty pay-

ment was actually offered.

Meanwhile, an attorney for Ray accused the Justice

Department of attempting to whitewash the investiga-

tion-of the killing. Robert I. Livingson of Memphis,

• Tenn., also charged the Justice Department with trying

to thwart a planned investigation of the assassination

by a House committee.

Livingston said he knew of two persons willing to

estify before the panel, but that they could not because

the committee was having iniernal problems. Robert I

¡Kennedy, while serving as attorney general, failed

badly by mantaining FBI surveillance on the Rev. Dj-

King, the task force said.

The report found that during Ray's imprisonment in

Missouri he told inmates he "hated Negroes." It said he

vowed on several occasions to kill the Rev. Dr. "if the

price was right.".

Livingston said he never had placed any faith'in the

investigation.

"Since that investigation started, I felt they would

approve everything the FBI has said and done in con-

Anection with the Dr. King murder. I knew they would

find:no fault whatever with (late FBI director). Mr.

John' Edgar Hoover, I knew they would find no fault

with anyone remotely connected to it.

"The only thing I'm surprised at is that they haven't

recommended Hoover for sainthood."

"The forces behind the assassinations are working

full time to see that nobody anywhere investigates these

¡assassinations," he said. "There are forces at worl!

trying to destroy the select committee of Congress t

investigate the assassinations.

"There are people in this world who don't want any

Tip from Missouri inmare

led to Ray's arrest

(Indicate page, name of

newspaper, city and statc.)

ВАРТОЇ

By EDWARD W. O'BRIEN

Globe-Democrat Washington Bureau

Chief

WASHINGTON - A tip from a former

Missouri Penitentiary cellmate of James

Earl Ray provided the crucial clue that

led to Ray's arrest for the assassination

. of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., a

Justice Department report has disclosed.

The cellmate remembered that Ray, as

a prisoner at Jefferson City, had talked

" about "the ease with which a person

living in Canada could obtain a false

passport," the report said.

• UNTIL THE interview with the uniden-

;tified prisoner, the FBI had been able to

• follow Ray's trail only as far as Atlanta,

*where he had driven immediately after

• the Memphis murder April 4, 1968.

- As then-FBI Dírector J. Edgar Hoover

admitted in a memorandum for then

Attorney General Ramsey Clark, the

trail was cold beyond Atlanta, despite a

massive manhunt.

By then, the FBI had zeroed in on Ray

as the probable killer and had obtained

photographs of him. But their man had

vanished.

The

Missouri tip triggered. a new

search. At the FBi's request, the Royal

Canadian Mounted Police in Ottawa

began searching passport application

files since Ray's escape from the prison

April 23, 1907.

"THOUGH THE search went through

a staggering number of applications and

was based on comparison of Ray's

photograph to those submitted with the

application, it proved to be the necessary

* break in picking up Ray's trail," the

report said,

"At 9:30 p.m. on June 1, 1968, the Filt

attache in Ottawa called Washington to

advise that after reviewing some 175,000

applications, the mounted police located

a passport issued April 24, 1968, under

the name Ramon George Sneyd which

contained a photograph very definitely

similar to Ray.

The passport application was traced

back to a Toronto travel agency. From

there, Ray leit a trail of ticket purchases

to London, Lisbon, and back to London;

where he was. apprehended June 8 as lie

The disclosure about' the Missouri tip,

as well as many other inside details, •

came in a 149-page report by a Justide

Department task force of five attorneys

and two analysis on their study of they

King case.

AFTER REVIEWING more than 200,-

000 documents from FBI headquarters

and field offices in St. Louis, Springfield, -

Il., and other cities, and interviewing 40..

witnesses, the team concluded:

—Ray, who had served seven years of

a 20-year sentence for armed robbery

• when he escaped from the Missouri

prison, acted alone in assassinating Dr.

King, the civil rights leader.

-There is no evidence of a conspiralis

between Ray and anybody else. "Inderd"
