‘by Mr. EBERHARDT of the House Select Committee on

September 7, 1978

HOUSE SELECT COMMITIER ow ASSASSINATIONS.

Former Agent Cletis B. Bidewell advised on
Questioning that he had on at least one occasion inter-
viewed Carol Pepper, sister of Jamés Earl Ray, suspect
an the assassination of Doctor Martin Luther King in
Memphis, Tennessee. At that. time, Carol Pepper was_
residing in Maplewood, Missouri, and the unlawful flight
to avoid confinement case against James Earl Ray,
resulting from his escape from the Missouri State
Penitentiary, Jefferson City, Missouri, was assigned to
Special Agent (SA) Bidewell in the St. Louis Division.
At this time, no information had been developed indicat-
ing that James Earl Ray was a suspect in the murder of
Dector King.

The interview with Carol Pepper was. most
frustrating since it appeared she was completely un~
cooperative in furnishing any information concerning the
possible whereabouts of James Earl Ray. ‘To the best
of his recollection, SA Bidewell advised that no other
Agent accompanied him on this interview and two or three young
children, presumably children of Carol Pepper, were in the
home at the time of the interview.

With respect as to how the lead to interview
Carol Pepper was obtained, it was recalled by SA Bidewell
that the lead was developed as a result of background
information furnished by the Kansas City Division,
office of origin in the unlawful flight to avoid confinement
case. To the best of his recollection, SA Bidewéll advised
that no information was obtained through the interview of

the casé on Jaines Earl Ray was reassigned to an Agent

WASHINGTON (UPI) — James Earl Ray was back
behind bars Saturday and, barring an abrupt tumnabot
wh his congressional “trial” resumes in Novembet,

appears destined to serve his full 99-year sentence for

killing the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King.

“ The House Assassinations Committee took Ray dut

of his Tennessee prison and gave him the public forum
$ he has sought for years to plead his innocence despite a
{ formal confession of guilt. But it also disclosed new
{ evidence that Ray and his attorney, Mark Lane, found
+ “most damaging.”
Two surprise developments Friday dealt severe
} blows to Ray's contentions — a retired British police-

man’s statement that Ray boasted of killing King short-
ly alter his arrest in London in 1968, and the adraission

of another witness that his support of Ray's alibi was
fabricated.

Lane responded angrily to the written statement

{ from the policeman, saying he understood the officer

had been charged with corruption and fired in disgriice.

Scotland Yard later said the officer — AlextInder
Anthony Eist, now a pub owner — was found innocént of

é
* | When Ray reappears before the committee in No-
+ Nember, questioning is expected to focus on whether he

vas part of a conspiracy rather than a lone killer. The
committee holds hearings in September on conspiracy
theories about the killing of President John F. Kennedy.

‘The three days of hearings produced:

— Testimony that Ray left Los Angeles in 1968 and,
paralleling King’s movements, went to Selma, Ala.,
Atlanta, and finally to Memphis, Tenn., where the civil
rights leader was killed by a bullet from the rifle Ray
admits he bought.

— Evidence that Ray was in Atlanta on April 1, 1968.

In an outburst that made his attorney wince, Ray
told the committee that if anyone could show that he
was in Atlanta on April 1, “I'll just take responsibility
for the King case right here on TV.” The committee
produced a woman, now 75, who said from a wheelchair
that she had made out laundry and dry-cleaning re-

“by Ray, in Atlanta on that day.

— An admission of lying from the only living sup-
porter of Ray's alibi that Ray was at a Memphis serv-
ice station when King was killed.

who had first corroborated Ray's alibi. Cowden, a
commodity dealer, said he was more than 400 miles

r James Earl Ray admitted under

= oath Friday that he had lied when
., he said he saw Ray at a Memphis
. service station at the time Dr.

¢ Martin Luther King Jr. was shot to

{ death. .

% Coy Dean Cowden testified before
\ the House assassinations committee
: that. he was actually in Beaumont,
Texas, 400 miles from Memphis,
when Dr. King was slain April 4,

1968, .
te RAY, WHO IS serving a 99-year
sentence for Dr. King’s murder, has
‘aid that at the time of the shooting
che was at a Texaco station in
Memphis to have a tire repaired on
his white Mustang.

Mark Lane, the attorney for Ray
at the committee hearings, had said
in a 1977 book titled ‘Code Mark
Zorro” that Cowden claimed to have
+ seen Ray at the station at the time
1 of the assassination.

4 “This is completely false," Cow-
£, den testified during questioning by
‘ep. Robert Edgar, D-Pa.

; Cowden’ said his part-of the alibi
,/story was rehearsed with Renfro
Y4qHays, a private investigator, who
W-gave the same story to the National
Enquirer newspaper last year.

ON THE WITNESS stand, Cow-
\. den; who testified that he was a
z former mental patient, said Hays
> had hoped to “'make' a million
zz dollars” out of the’Dr. King case.

* “He bought it hook, line and

“That seems like appropriate
‘equipment for Mr. Lane,” comment-
ed Rep. Harold Sawyer, R-Mich,
* — LANE TOLD The Globe-Democrat
later, “I don’t know when Cowden is
telling the truth . .. He lied before in
talking about the matter. Now he
says he’s telling the truth.”
Cowden’s testimony dealt another
+ blow to the 50-yéar-old Ray's claim
that he did not kill Dr. King. He
pleaded guilty to ihe shooting in 1969
- but repudiated the plea several days
. later. For years he has sought a new
trial.
Ray insists that he was framed by
a mystery: man known only as
Raoul.

y alleged that Ray had indicated

denied to the
committee that he had made such a
confession while awaiting extradi-
tion to the United States. Ei
“That's probably the most damag-
ing statement that’s been made
against me. . . admitting guilt on a
murder charge . . . It is false,” Ray
declared. . . ,

His attorney contended that the,
allegations by former Inspector Al-
exander Anthony Eist, who is now
- retired, are unreliable. .

Rep. Samuel L. Devine, R-Ohio,
read aloud a report on a recent
interview of Eist by the committee's
staff.

DEVINE QUOTED Eist as saying
that he was one of Ray’s guards
during the weeks of his incarcera-
tion in London and that Ray often
confided in him.

Committee investigators asked
Eist, who now,has a pub in Cam-
bridge, England, whether. Ray had
admitted killing Dr. King. :
“Oh, no, no, no,” Eist replied. “He
didn’t actually-come out with it, but
it was there in the conversation that *-
he had done it.” - ae

At one point, Eist was asked, “Did
he express hatred for blacks?”

“Yes,"" Eist replied. “There ,
wasn’t any doubt at all... Hesaid *
he was trying to get to Africa to
-shoot some more.”” genet

EIST SAID Ray's ego was suc ,
that he began describing the a :

Gras

nation of Dr. King. {
“He told me about a gun. He saill
he threw it away. He told me he had
left this place (where the shooting of
Dr. Kingoccurred), saw a police=
man, panicked and threw away the *

Eist also said Ray boasted that he *
could only be convicted of conspira-
cy — that authorities couldn't prove
that he had fired the weapon that .

‘killed Dr. King.

The former inspector quoted Ray ~
as saying that he thought he would
be sentenced to one to 10 years in
prison on a conspiracy charge. Eist
said Ray was happy about this
prospect, and hoped that it would be
concurrent with a 20-year sentence
he had been serving in Missouri.

RAY ESCAPED from the Missouri
State Penitentiary April 23, 1967. He
had been-convicted of robbing a St.
Louis supermarkt of $191 in 1959. el

p Eist-also quoted Ray as saying
‘Ahat “For him to have shot a black
jman of note in.certain parts of +
4 American would make him a natiol-

al hero . . . He seemed absolutely

mad about publicity. He reqlly

wanted it.” 7

Ray predicted, according to Eist,
that he would receive $250,000 to -
$500,000-for killing Dr. King because

would explore the issue of Eist’s

Walter Fauntroy, the District of

Persisting, Stokes then asked Ray to

diated his guilty plea shortly after
making it and for years has been seeking

IN PREVIOUS testimony before the
committee, Ray said he supported him-
4 self by part-time jobs, by the $1,700
z Tobbery of a pimp in Montreal and on
* money paid to him by Raoul for the
; smuggling of contraband.
*. Ray has contended that he was framed”
for Dr. King’s slaying by Raoul.
. Fithian and committee staff members
also produced evidence that Ray was
* involved in a London area bank robbery
June 4, 1968, a few days before his |

pture.

Es, CONGRESSMAN said a right
fhumbprint found on a paper bag after

e robbery matched Ray’s, according to |

cotland Yard, the FBI and an independ-
ent.firm hired by the assassinations

+ committee.
°~-Ray's attorney Mark Lane objected
that such evidence was irrelevant.

Referring to the allegation about ‘the

* Bank of Alton robbery, Lane told Fithian
“I would add that you shed your

* congressional immunity for five minutes
so we might later settle this in court...
that was an outrageous statement.”

AT THIS POINT, acting committee
chairman Rep. Richardson Preyer, D-
N.C., asked Fithian, “How is this
relevaNt?”” .

- Fithian replied, “In the course of this
investigation, this committee will pro-
vide substantial evidence of what I just

in Alton, Capt. John Light, assistant
police chief, said that after Ray wast
implicated in Dr. King's slaying, police:
and FBI agents were tipped by informa
arts that Ray was involved in the bank

is still carried on the records as

time as the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King
Jr. in the months prior to the killing.of
King.

Ray appeared nervous at several

+ points in the questioning and his attor-
ney, Mark ‘Lane, repeatedly objected to
the way some of the questions were
phrased.,

Committee chairman Louis Stokes,
D-Ohio, who did all of the questioning,
submitted evidence that showed that
Ray had been in Los Angeles, Selma,

Trying to emphasisize the signifi-
cance of Ray being in Atlanta in early
April, Stokes read from the transcript of
~a television interview with Ray in which
Ray said that such evidence would be

4 damaging.

“If I left Los Angeles planning to
-return to the Deep South, then I will take

together. rad s
‘Stokes assailed Ray’s statement’ to
the committee that his unfound and
never fuily identified accomplice had
never handled the .30-06 rifle that is be-
lieved to have been the weapon used to
kill the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.
on April 4, 1968. eorenriaes
Ray said he had bought the weapon
for a man named Raoul in Birmingham,
Ala., for what he thought was a gun-
running scheme. Ray said he and Raoul
had worked together for months, from
Canada to Mexico, in various smuggling

deals. .,

Ray said that if he had killed King,
his fingerprints never would have been
found on the murder weapon.

“ft would have wiped my fingerprints

off the rifle if 1 knew it was going to be
used in a serious crime,” Ray said. He
insisted that even as a petty criminal he
‘was too smart to leaye his prints behind.

It was suggested that he did not have

time to wipe his prints off the rifle be-

cause he was-in-a-hurry to-flee-the scene
of the shooting. .

i “Usually you do that (remove the
‘prints) beforehand — before the crime,”
Ray said. “There are several things you
can use to prevent your fingerprints
trom getting on the rifle. Every novi
knows enough to keep your fingerprints
off a weapon if it’s going to be used for a_

‘Ray's fingerprints were found on the

new only as “Raoul.”* 7

. | “When we think about the fact that

Raoul’s fingerprints don't exist on that
* tifle at all, doesn’t that indicate that

Raoul doesn’t exist at all?” Ray was
+ asked.

“It doesn’t to me,” Ray replied.

«,, Ray admitted earlier today that he
had given conflicting stories to House
investigators, but said these ‘small
errors" do not dispute his denial that he .
shot King,

Ray said the initial testimony he gave
to-committee staff members at Brushy
Mountain Prisonin Tennessee was not
based on a thorough review of the case.

“It was my intention to tell the
truth,” Ray said. “I wanted to be as
factual as possible because of the prob-

‘. lem of (my) credibility. There have been

Y some.small errors in details, Some con-

. fusion in dates.” 7

Ray said in his opening testimony
Wednesday that he never shot King and

was several blocks away from the mur-
der scene having his car serviced at a
as station at the time King was killed,
4 Ray told investigators in Tennessee
hat he returned the first rifle to a sport;

testimony Wednesday, Ray said Raoul

“When I saw government documents
that I bought the second rifle the next
day, I realized I had made an error.””

- Ray conceded that he iad said this.
At first, at the staff. interviews,

anc, Raoul would have been there,” y

said. :
Ray's faulty — if not selective
memory was attacked over, and over.
Why had Raoul never been found? Who
‘could have seen them together? Why
couldn't Ray furnish more descriptive
information about Raoul, such as his |
real name? ‘ 7
Ray had no hard answers. “Possibly
a barmaid in Birmingkam. Possibly a .
waitress in Jim's Grill in Memphis” had ~
seen him in Raoul’s company, he said.

‘| “But he couldn’t be sure. And he men-

tioned no one in Montreal, where he al-
"legedhehad mettheman.-

\ “Mr, Ray, I say to you, this cor
inttee has reviewed every FBI d
«Ment relative to this case, every otht
“investigative document, and nowhere ij ;

; théye a reference to a man named *
Raoul,” Stokes said. 4

‘To that, Ray replied only that pers

hapis not all documents had been found
, inthe matter. a)

Stokes: “If we can’t find Raoul, we
can’t help you very much, can we?”

Ray: “I think the only thing that

* could help me is a judge.”
Q: Don’t you think if we had more
' information about Raoul, we might be

1 A: If Thad gone to trial in 1968, he

The proceedings were- interrupted.
and delayed over and over when Ray's
attoraey, Mark Lane, a longtime postu-
lator of conspiracy theories in the King
and “John F. Kennedy assassinations,
objasted to the course of the questioning.

Lane repeatedly complained of not
having transcripts and other documents +
related to the interrogation. “This is not
an investigation by (the late) Sen, Jo-
seph R.) McCarthy's hearing,” he cried.
“We demand the common courtesies due
any defendant in a court of law.”

The panel accorded Lane the papers -
he asked for, but Rep. Richardson Prey- !
er, D-N.C., the acting chairman, ap-
peared to be losing patience with Lane's
tactics. “This is not a court of law,” he
said.j‘Your role as counsel is simply to

day, his attorney said.

Earlier the attorney, Mark Lane, had
accused guards at the Federal Correc-
tional Institution at Petersburg, Va., of
beating Ray Monday night and putting
him-in a tiny punishment cell where
lights burned 24 hours a day.

“The lights will be out in Ray’s cell
tonight so he can sleep,” Lane said after
he won an order from U.S. District
Judge William B. Bryant here for Ray

charge of holding Ray for the, House
committee testimony, said his under-

standing was that three marshals will

er than leave him under the care of pris-

* on officials.
Bullock said this did not necessarily
mean that Ray would have to be trans-
ferred from the Petetsburg prison —

only that marshals must watch him di-.

rectly whether he is kept there or some-
where else.

« Ray was taken to the federal prison
from Brushy Mountain State Prison in
Petros, Tenn., where he is serving a 99-
year sentence for the slaying of Dr. King
of April 4, 1958, plus an additional one-
to two-year term for escape.

LANE SAID RAY told him that he

‘months after Ray escaped from ‘the
+ Missouri State Penitentiary in Jefferson

City, where he was serving a 20-year
* sentence for first-degree robbery,

Ray said Raoul indicated he could
obtain papers for Ray to leave Canada

. for Europe or Africa. But first, Ray said,

Raoul asked for his help in smuggling

“certain items” of contraband which

Ray did not specify.

He said that he and Raoul smuggled
contraband from Canada into the United
States, and from the United States into

> Mexico.

RAY SAID THAT early in 1968, Raoul
told him to buy a rifle as a sample for a
gua-running operation into Mexico, and
that he bought a rifle in Birmingham,

la. .

+ This rifle, Ray testified, was later

exchanged by him for a 30.06 Remington

rifle identified by authorities as the

Purder weapon,

dl Ray said he and Raoul met in Mem-
his the day before the assassination,

id that Raoul took the rifle— saying he:.

« “wanted to show it to possible Mexican
customers,

That was the last time he saw the rifle,
Ray testified.

He said Raoul instructed him to rent a
room at 422'% S. Main St., the rooming
house from which Ray is accused of

Shooting Dr. King.

Raoul was to meet him there at 3 or 4
‘p.m. April 4, Ray said.

RAY SAID HE RENTED the room and
‘Raoul arrived sometime after 4 p.m.
April 4.

He said Raoul sent him to buy a pair of

. binoculars the possible customers want-
~ ed to see and that he had a sandwich ina
restaurant, leaving for the service sta-

.. tion about 5:40 p.m. for the tire repair.
Dr.-King was assassinated at 6:03 p.m.
Nby a shot from the rifle fired from a
“bathroom window about 20 feet from the
m which Ray had rented, according

+ to hid FBI and Memphis police.

an ae Cand
Ray said his first lawyer, Arthur J. +
Hanes Sr., “had me enter into a series of
literary contracts with him and William
Briord Huie ... in order, MerHtanesy
said, to finance a Jury trial...” i

In November 1968, Ray" said, his;
brother, Jerry W. Ray, visited him in’
prison and told him that Huie had“
offered $12,000 “if 1 would not take the? 3
witness stand.”

Ray quoted Huie’as saying any trial”
testimony (by Ray) would “destroy the
literary value of the book"’ on the King
staying which Huie was writing at the
time,

“Consequently,” Ray said, “when Per-
cy Foreman, a member of the Texas bar,
appeared at the Memphis jail a few days
later and visited me, 1 agreed with Mr.
Foreman’s suggestion that I fire "
Hanes and hire Foreman.”

} Ray said Foreman “then promised _

jand later the trial judge, that if I

iretained him in the case, he (Foreman)

would not become involved with Huie."”
This promise, Ray said, was of

-xs'short duration.” q

IN JANUARY 1969, Ray continued, q
Foreman gave him a $5,000 check from?
Huie for endorsement and told Ray he
needed in money to hire a lawyer to
assist hi fl

Ray said that in February 1969, Fore-
man got another $5,000 check from Huie.

“This time,” Ray said, ‘he did -not
bother to have me endorse it. He just
forged my name to it and cashed it in
complicity with Planter’s Bank of Mem-
phis.””

Ray said that “after collecting all the
money that was available from Huie (the
$10,000), attorney Foreman then com-
menced on Feb. 13, 1969, maneuvering
me into a guilty plea.”

He said that among Foreman’s argu:
ments was one that “it would in som:
manner be in my financial interest tq-
plead guilty as charged.”

Another argument used by Foreman,
Ray said, was that “the trial judge (W.

because he was concerned that blacks

RAY SAID FOREMAN‘also told him
that Ray's brother Jerry might be”

- Ray also said Foreman told him the

Was Beaten

Compiled From News Services

WASHINGTON — James Earl Ray’s lawyer charged
today that federal prison officials and guards beat his
client and put him in a hot, tiny punishment cell with
the lights on 24 hours a day.

Attorney Mark Lane said the incident occurred
Monday night at a federal penitentiary some distance
from Washington. A spokesman for the U.S. Bureau of
Prisons acknowledged a struggle had taken place and
said the lighting problem had been solved, but denied
that Ray had been injured. ’

Ray, who is serving a 99-year state prison term in
Tennessee for the slaying of civil rights leader Martin
Luther King Jr. in 1968 and an additional 1- to 2-year
term for escape, testified today before the House assas-
sinations committce under high security.

Lane said in an interview that he visited Ray at the
prison Tuesday night and that he was “pale and shak-
ing and looked haggard, as if he had not slept at all.””

: & Lane said Ray told him that prison officials and’
guards had punched him in the back of the neck,

objected to being photographed, then put him in the
cel

hours because he fearéd that officials would put some-
thing in his food “‘to deter the function of his mind” at
the hearing. He said Ray told him he could not sleep
because of the lights and suffered a headache from
being punched.

Lane said that a Memphis attorney would file a writ
of habeus corpus today to have Ray removed from the
federal prison cell where he is being held.

‘The writ, he said, will charge that Ray “is being held
in a punitive, solitary confinement celi with lights on
him 24 hours a day. Lane said the writ ‘would also con-
tend that “the temperature in the cell seemed to be
excess of 90 degrees.” .

Lane said U.S. marshals had told Ray he would not
have te be photographed but prison officials did so
anyway and Ray objected.

Michael Aun, a spokesman for the Bureau of Pris-
oas, denied that Ray was injured. He said that one offi-
cer had been kicked and another elbowed in the mouth
during the struggle. Fy

‘The identity of the prison where Ray is being hell!
has not been disclosed. That prison has a policy of pht-
tographing and fingerprinting all inmates with a hist<-
ry of escape, but the processing of Ray was halted aftér
the scuffle, Aun said.

WASHINGTON — Convicted assassin

committee that he did not kill the Rev,
Dr. Martin Luther King and that he was
the victim of a complicated web involy-
ing a mysterious man who apparently

framed Ray. a

case, Ray today recanted his March 1169

that he would not present an adequate
defense if Ray pleaded not guilty,
Following closely a prepared state-

fully laid open a complicated scenatio

~ held a quick meeting and decided’ to
adjourn,

“We didn’t want it to be said that he
(Ray) was not fresh and able to testify,”
said Rep. Walter E. Fauntroy, D.-Dis-
trict of Columbia. -

“mony tomorrow and Friday.
Among the statements made by Ray
iis morning in his prepared text were:

— That he had escaped from the
Missouri prison alone and without the
help of anyone outside. Ray said he had
hidden in a bread box and had left the
prison in a truck that was making a de-
i livery. +

— That he had $250 in cash when he

in St. Louis he had gone to Chicago

where he worked as a dishwasher for

severalmonths. + =~ ;

— That he purchased a car and drove
to Canada from Chicago, staying in
Montreal, It was in Montreal that he
first met Raoul, who indicated that he
could obtain for Ray illegal passport
documments in return for Ray engaging
~ ‘in smuggling activities for him.

“+ — That thé subsequent association
with Raoul included meetings in several
U.S. cities including Atlanta, Birming,

* ham and New Orleans. The final meet-

ing, Ray said, took place in Memphis the

day before King was killed.

:, Ray, who-read-rapidly from-the-pre-
pared statement, seemed to embrace a
conspiracy theory behind King’s assassi-

. fation, in which he said he had no part.

- He said that Raoul had paid him to pur-

“chase a high-powered rifle in Birming-

ham, supposedly to show some “par-

ties” in New Orleans who were intérest-

* ed in gun smuggling.

> Ray said after buying the rifle, he

Gave it to Raoul and never saw it again.

* Ray's fingerprints were found on a high-

+ powered rifle, which is believed to have
© a the murder weapon.

-

: ay offered explanations ‘for several
- other elements that seemed to implicate

ae re er nr

Ray is scheduled to continue his testi- .

: .escaped, and that after stopping briefly”

him in the assassination. He said, Tr |
example, that Raoul had asked him to
buy a pair of binoculars on the day as-
sassination, and also had him register
under a fictitious name at the rundown _

> boarding house. na

A Ray fingerprint was also found on
the binoculars, and a man at the board.
ing house identified Ray as having fled
from the house shortly after King was
shot. Ray said he had left several per-
sonal items, including a blanket, in the
rooming house with Raoul when he left .
fordinner, = - .

Several black civil rights leaders and
persons close to Ray who have sought a
new trial have contended that Ray could

< not have fled from Memphis and jour-
neyed to Canada, England and Lisbon
without outside help. His escape has
given rise to the possibility of a conspir-

x

acy. * 1
Sat during his testimony, Ray denied
having any assistance in his escape. He
said after leaving Memphis he went to
Atlante, where he boarded a bus for
Detroit. He then took another bus to «
Toronto, where on his own and using
false identity, he managed to obtain jt .
Canadian passport. iz
‘The passport, he said, enabled him
fly to London and later to Lisbon. He.
unsuccessfully sought to journey to.
Rhodesia, but could not obtain the neces-
sary visa. ,
At that point, Ray said, he returned
toLondon, wherehe wasarrested. .
Ray, during the 90 minutes of his tes-
timony, attempted to explain why he
had pleaded guilty by harshly criticizing
his first two lawyers. 7
After his arrest in London, he had
retained Arthur Haynes of Birmingham,

* but before his scheduled trial date he
dismissed Haynes and retained Percy
Foreman of Houston, Texas. Haynes and
Foreman, Ray said, were involved in a
contract with a writer who was doing a
book on the King assassination. Ray said
both lawyers had told him that a guilt);
plea was desirable for the book. !

Ray said that Foreman had told hina

moe,

—_ .

that the press already had convicted
him/and that the government had a wit-
- Ness it had bribed who would say that
Ray had been seen leaving the boarding
house after the shot was fired.
‘Foreman argued also, Ray said, that
* unless he pleaded guilty, Ray’s brother,
Jerry, would be arrested on a conspira-
cy charge, and his father, George, would
have to return to prison. Ray’s father,
who Ray said was 70 at the time, had
escaped from an Iowa prison in 1930.
The testimony began in a verbal
exchange between Ray’s lawyer, Lane,
~ and several committee members. Lane
has accused the committee of trying to
Present evidence that would show Ray
guilty of the crime in an effort to cover
up involvement by the Federal Bureau
{ Investigation.
. || Lane said that Ray had been beaten
iy federal marshals before leaving

" ‘Memphis for Washington yesterday. A . head of the american Polygraph Associ-

Committee member, however, said such

_ charges were out of order and were not

+ related to Ray’s testimony.

. ' _ During his testimony, Ray said sever-
al times that he thought the FBI had
arranged King’s assassination. He of-
fered no evidence, however. qi

in another development, Lane, con-
tinued his attacks Tuesday on the HOuse
committee, calling for the disbarment of _
its general counsel, G. Robert Blakey,
and of its deputy counsel, Michael
Eberhardt.

Lane told reporters that Blakey,
Eberhardt and Conrad Baetz, a staff
investigator who is based in Madison.
County, Il, had “suborned perjury,
criminally received stolen property,

_ Monitored and tape-recorded telephone

“conversations and violated their own

rules...” :

The charges were similar to those
Lane made recently in St. Louis at a
news conference with Oliver Patterson, *
a Black Jack, Mo., man who says that he

. jaformed on Jerry Ray, a brother of

fey, for the committee. Patterson alleg- >

‘s that he secretly tape-recorded tele-
i Fhone conversations with Jerry Ray,

INW 68262 Docld:32989797 Page 60

Stole some letters sent to Jerry Ray by
James Earl Ray, and even stole strands
of Jerry Ray's hair — all at the behest of
Baetz.

The allegations prompted Blakey to.

. begin an investigation. Last week, he

announced that the preliminary finding
was that committee staff had done noth-
ing illegal.

But Lane said Tuesday that the
Committee had not checked with the
fersons making the allegations — Pat-
terson, himself or Susan Wadsworth, a

‘lorissant woman who says she parti
pated with Patterson in some of his ac-
tivities. Therefore, Lane said he was
mystified by the clean bill of health. In
addition, Patterson said Tuesday he hi
taken — and passed — a polygraph te3t

* on all his statements, He said he hiid

requested the test last week of Chjis |
Gugas, whom he identified as for

ation.

WASHINGTON — How much does
James Earl Ray really know about the
events leading up to and away from a
moment of violence in Memphis April 4,

+ * 19682 And will he talk?

‘Those are the most tantalizing ques- »

tions among many that will be on the

minds of congressional investigaters
Wednesday when Ray is scheduled to -
: testify in public for the first time about

the 10-year-old murder of the Rev. Dr.

Martin Luther King Jr,

~ IN 189, RAY pleaded guilty to the
‘murder and is serving a 99-year term at
the Brushy Mountain Penitentiary in
‘Tennessee, But he was brought to Wash-

dngton-under heavy guard for his public
‘appearance before the House Select

Committee on Assassinations.

It is possible, however, that Ray's
testimony, which is scheduled for three
days, will be cut short. Since his plea of
guilty, Ray has been insisting on his
‘innocence and has been struggling des-
‘perately to reopen his case and obtain a

new trial,

3 If Ray chooses only to make a state.

By PAUL WAGMAN
. Of the Post-Dispatch Staff

WASHINGTON — The shot that killed
the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King could
‘have been fired from a bathroom win-
dow of a rcoming house across the street
from King’s motel or from a bushy area
ina yard behind the house, a pathologist
told the House Select Committee on

5 Assassinations today.

Ds. Michael M. Baden, the patholo-
gist, said there were no medical tests
which would be precise enough to rule
out either site.

The bathroom window has been cited
by prosecutors of James Earl Ray,”
King’s convicted assassin, as the site
from which Ray was alleged to have
‘shot King as he stood on the second-floor
balcony of the Lorraine Motel in Mem-
phis, Tenn., on April 4, 1968, F

However, according to some other
theories that have arisen about the
* , murder, the fatal shot was fired by
Someone other than Ray from the back
yard of the rooming house.

In another development, Mark Lane,
Ray’s attomey, raised new questions
about the Assassination Committee’s
investigatory techniques. Lane said he
had evidence that a St. Louis-area man
had been paid by two committee investi- i
 ggators to lie to Jerry Ray, James Earl |

| Ray's brother, and to another man in an
effort to leam how they would respond \
, ¢ to. subpoena from the committee.
.” Lane said the St. Louis-area man had

. been instructed by investigators Conrad |
Baetz, a former Madison County, Ul,
sheriff's deputy, and Melvin Waxman to
tell Ray and the other man that he had
been subpoenaed and that they would
probably be subpoenaed, too. Lane said
the man flew to Atlanta to meet with the
pair and to learn whether they would
plead the Fifth Amendment, who their
lawyers were, and other information.

Lane, also an author, showed a re- 7
porter a copy of a check written to the !
St. Louis man which carried the identifi-
cation “U.S. House of Representatives.”
Lane showed the reporter the check only +
on the condition that the man’s name not ;
be disclosed, He said that the man did‘,
not want publicity.

The check was for $69. Lane said the
man was paid $50 plus $19 expenses, H

Earlier this month, Lane created a
small uproar when at a St. Louis press
conference he and Oliver Patterson of
Black Jack accused the committee of
commissioning Patterson to spy on Jer-
ty Ray. The alleged spying included

- valleged illegal taping of telephone con-
versations. f

The allegations led to an investiga. ,
tion by the Assassinations Committee. R
Last week, chief counsel G. Robert Bla. j
key reported that “on the strength of a
preliminary investigation the committee #
categorically denies each and every
allegation of wrongdoing.”

Today, Lane said he was mystified by, t

Tlakey's statement, because, he said,

Jesse Jackson Doubts Ray Killed King aoe aa

: : >
«,” PETROS, Tenn. (UPI) — The Rev. Jesse’ Jackson
“has emerged from a face-to-face talk with James Earl
Ray with a “profound doubt” that Ray is the killer of
the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.

* Jackson, who was with King when he was killed by a
i * sniper in Memphis in 1968, said he called the Justice
| Department on Thursday before he left Brushy Moun-
I fain Penitentiary to back Ray’s demands dor a new tri-
| al.
i Ray, who confessed to the killing and is serving a 99-
| , Year sentence, now maintains that he is innocent.
| Jackson, a civil rights leader from Chicago, said he
“told Deputy Attorney General Benjamin R. Civiletti
that a new trial for Ray would be “in the national inter-
est?’ because there are still strong doubts about the
-Fetleral Bureau of Investigation’s true role in King’s

ination.
"We're seeking to meet with Attorney General Grif-

NW 68262 Docld:32989797 Page 68 -

fin Bell on Tuesday of next week in a real effort to chal-
lenge the Justice Department to take a few look at the
evidence,” Jackson said. a

Pointing to years of FBI harassment of King and
Ray’s contention that he was part of a conspiracy,
Jackson accused the agency of complicity in King's
death. -

“The very thought of a conspiracy is what compels
me to file for a new trial,” he said. “The FBI followed
Dr. King 24 hours a day. The motives of the FBI are far
greater than this man’s (Ray's) motives.” -

Jackson, president of Operation PUSH and one of

. America’s most prominent black leaders, said he came

away from the unprecedented three-hour meetis
doubting that Ray fired the bullet that killed King. I .
“I am convinced that he was involved but was nbt
alone. It may very well be that Mr. Ray was a diversign

iz “By GERALD M. BOYD
A Washington Correspondent
‘of the Post-Dispatch

WASHINGTON — The Rev. Dr.
Martin Luther King was probably aware
that he would be assassinated and un-
derwent severe periods of depression in

+ the months preceding his murder, the

bad Ralph D. Abernathy, his chief lieu-
in the civil Tights movement, has
tested,

Abernathy said that, over the last
four months of his life, King showed a
marked change in his mental state,
which seemed to indicate that he knew
that he would be killed.

He said that King had been harassed
constantly by the Federal Bureau of
Investigation and that neither -the FBI
nor other police authorities provided
adequate security for King, even though
they had been told that King was con-
stantly receiving death threats.

‘The charges against the FBI and the
description of King’s last months
emerged as the key elements of Aberna-
thy's remarks today at a public hearing
of the House Select Committee on Assas-

+ sinations.

‘Under continuous questioning from
the Il-member committee, Abernathy
said he had no evidence to substantiate
his belief that King knew that he would

be killed. But he said that he was certain
that King did know.

The testimony of Abernathy, which
included a moving description of King's
Jast hours, came at the start of five days
of hearings on the civil rights leader's
death. King was assassinated in Mem-
phis on April 4, 1968. James Earl Ray
was later arrested and confessed to the j
assassination,

Since his confession, Ray has denied:

mmmitting the murder, He has sought 22

ew trial and said that he would tell the

‘real” story if a new trial ever was held.

Abernathy is the current head of the

Southern Christian Leadership Confer-
ence — the group King founded. He had

68262 Docld:32989797 Page 69

(Mount Clipping in Space Below)

been a constant companion and friend of *
King since 1955 and was with King when
he was fatally shot.

Today’s testimony represented in
attempt by several committee members
to determine King’s relationship with
the FBI and to determine whether the
agency knew about the assassination
plan in advance or failed to adequately
pursue leads in the case.

One committee member, Rep. Sa-
muel L. Devine, R-Ohio, said he hoped
the committee was not attempting to
dwell on the FBI at the expense of pursu-
ing other angles of the assassination.

‘Abernathy said that King was reluc-
tant to report death threats to the FBI.
He said that the slain civil rights leader
was aware, as early as 1955, that he was
a target of telephone tapping, electronic
bugging and other surveillance methods
of the FBI and other government agen-

“The FBI was aware of some of the

~ threats,” Abernathy said. “We did not

report all of them, because we believed

that the FBI was not interested in doing

anything about them. Some of the FBI,

agents were from the Deep Soath andj
were quite racist.

“Just because you take a person “ist
put a badge on him doesn’t change his
heart.”

Abernathy said that King was aware
that then FBI director, J. Edgar Hoover,
had called him “the most notorious liar
in America.”

On the day before the assassination, :

Abernathy said, a plane King was riding
on was delayed for about an hour while
it was searched. Abernathy said he had
no idea who had ordered the precaution,

* but that no special security had been
available after King’s party reached
Mempiis, either from the FBI or shay
local police.

Several committee members alo
questioned Abernathy about a group “ot
Memphis blacks called the “Invaders.”

had no direct knowledge, but that after
January 1968 the civil rights leader
seemed more concerned about his death,

“His attitude was altogether differ-
ent,” Abernathy said. “He seemed more
troubled, more nervous and a more
worried person.”

‘At one point, he said, the two took a,
trip to Acapulco, Mexico, in an attempt
to get King to relax. But all the time,
Abernathy said, King seemed to be con-

that the assassinations panel has enough

“The subCommittee wants | to know if

Citarges House Panel Hired

By J0 MANNIES
Of the Post-Dispatch Staff

J The attorney for James Earl Ray,

convicted assassin of the Rev. Marti
Luther King Jy., says House investiga-
tors hired a Black Jack man to spy on
Ray's brother.

And, said attorney Mark Lane, inves-
tigators for the House Select Committee
‘on AsseSsination then gave the “spy”
answers — some false — for his official
testimo'y.

Lane Was in St. Louis on Monday for
something of a three-ring circus of dis-

closures and allegations. In addition to

the charges about spying, Lane:

— Accused the committee staff of
using illegal means to gain evidence,
including wiretapping and thefts, all as
part of a “conspiracy” to prevent a fair
investigation into King’s death.

— Engaged in a mild shoving match
with a New York Times reporter and
accused the Times of being an unwitting
“transmission belt” for false disclosures
about ths, King murder. Lane main-
tained that committee investigators had
intentionally leaked the information to
the Times ¢o discredit Ray’s contention
that, despite his guilty piea, he is inno-
cent,

Lane said he decided to make his alle-
gations public because, “Members of
Congress have not the faintest idea that
they are being betrayed by their own
staff.” ‘

A spokesman for the committee gait
Monday night only that the staff is
aware bf Lane’s contentions and that

——

{we consider them serious. We will be
investigating.” Ray is expected to testis

publicly before the committee lat

this month, the spokesman said. .

USS. Rep. Harold Sawyer, D-Mich., \ \

nlember of the committee, denied
Lane's contention that Ray was offered

his freedom in exchange for an admis-
Sion of guitt,
‘But he said Ray had been told zhat
i authorities in Missouri and Tennessee

4} would be asked to consider a redt
in Ray’s sentence if Sawyer was given
“hard evidence that others were in-

{Sawyer defended the proposal. “Ev; .

at times to gain information,” he said. +
4 Such a deal is now almost impossible,
Sawyer said, because Lane “has just”

fleliberately blown it” by discussing it
publicly.
+ +4 The news conference was held in St.
© fouis at the Hilton Inn near Lambert
Field, Its primary aim, Lane said, was

In April, Patterson said, he appeared

that the 1974 FBI report containing an

néyer tumed over to federal investiga-
to7’s because of “simple inadvertance.”
This document came to light lajjt
March, along with an earlier documert,
which was an FBI report that Byers had
told two lawyers that he had turned
down a-$50,000-offer-to arrange King’s
* death. The FBI here had been checking

into Byers after he had become a prime ,

suspect in the two break-ins at the St.
Louis Art Museum, Charges against
Byers weresubsequently dropped.

The second document quoted an in-
former as saying he was told by Byers
that a Missouri businessman was “the
individual who made the payoff to
James Earl Ray after the killing” on
April 4, 1968.

Webster said that the second docu-
ment constituted “heresay three times
removed.” In New York to address the
American Bar Association's national
convention, Webster said that although

- an investigation by his office concluded
that the report’s misplacement was a
mistake, it was not overly significant

Attention is directed to two FD-302s in this file,
reflecting interviews conducted on 7/28/78 and 8/4/78,
respectively, by me, of former SA HOWARD C. KENNEDY.

_ Particular attention is directed to the interview with
KENNEDY on 8/4/78 as it pertains to dissemination of
information by him, which information is reflected in
serial 5 of St. Louis. file 137-16185. In this interview
of 8/4/78, KENNEDY stated that he recalls with reasonable
certainty that certain information was disseminated by him
to the St. Louis Police Department.

In order to document such dissemination, this is to
record that I personally searched our dissemination control
file, 66-2340, for the months of April through July of 1974
and found no record of such dissemination having been made.

It should be noted that the volume of 66-2340 for the
month of March, 1974, and prior months are no longer maintained
as they have been destroyed under the file destruction program.

There is no FD-159 (dissemination form) concerning this
matter contained in 137-16185 or the related file 87~21859.

Mr. HOWARD C: KENNEDY resides at 55 Harneywold Drivé,
Ferguson, Missouri 63136, residence telephone number (314)
521-8221,

Mr. KENNEDY is presently self-employed as a private
investigator and polygraph examiner. He retired from FBI
service on February 28, 1977. Prior to his retirement he
was assigned to the St. Louis Division of the FBI from 1954
to the date of his retirement. During 1974 he was assigned
to general criminal matters and worked as a Special Agent
under the supervision of Field Supervisor ROBERT L. BENDER.

Mr. KENNEDY's recollection was refreshed regarding an
interview with him at the FBI Office in St. Louis, Missouri,
on July 28, 1978, by SAC ROY B. KLAGER, JR., concerning a
closed St. Louis file 137-16185; more specifically, serial 5
of that file. Mr. KENNEDY recalled having read this serial
in detail. He further recalled earlier discussion on July 28,
1978, concerning a notation appearing on the above serial
which states, "Notify locals of info re killing", and his
earlier reply that in hiS recollection this cémment pertained
to a matter appearing on page 2 of the memorandum and unrelated
to the MARTIN LUTHER KING information.

Mr. KENNEDY was asked if he did in fact disseminate the
information in keeping with the above-cited handwritten
notation. He related that he recalls with reasonable certainty
that he did disseminate thé information appearing on page 2
to someone:in the St. Louis Police Departiment whose identity
he does not now recall.

Mr. KENNEDY called further attention to the last paragraph
of page 3 of the memorandum in question which refers to another
killing, unrelated to the MARTIN LUTHER KING matter. He
volunteered that this additional unrelated information was also
disseminated, to the best of his recollection, to the St. Louis
Police Department; however, he similarly does not recall to
whom this information was given.

FPD-350 (Rev. 11-11-75)

(Mount Clipping in Space Below)

WASHINGTON — The Federal Bureau
' wf Investigation received information in
| 1973 that Russell G. Byers, a former auto
i varts dealer and police character from

Rock Hill, knew who “made the payoff of
» ‘ames Earl Ray” after the assassination
| uf the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.

Byers’ accusation, reported by an
informant, is contained in an internal St.

Louis FBI office memorandum made

uvailable Wednesday to the Post-Dis-

patch under the Freedom of Information

Act.

The memorandum, which went un-
noticed for four years in the wrong file in
‘St. Louis, does not give the name of the
man identified by Byers. But it describes
the man as “a short, stocky man who

walked with a limp.”

This description, several sources have
told the Post-Dispatch, fits John R.
Kauffmann, a one-time stockbroker of
Imperial, Mo. Byers has reportedly told

* investigators for the House Assassina-
tions Committee that Kauffmann and
John H. Sutherland, both now dead,
asked Byers to arrange King’s murder.

However, one source said that at least
one other man fitting the description
could not be ruled out as the person
described in the memorandum. The
second man was described by St. Louis
police sources as an avowed segregation-
ist and an acquaintance of Sutherland’s.

Byers refused to comment on the FBI
memo when reached at his Rock Hill

home Wednesday night. He said the
House committee had asked him not to
make public statements.

Byers was keenly interested, however,
in the new disclosures. He carefully
analyzed the copy of the FBI memo
released Wedr.zsday. And, while hum-
ming a tune, he read through a New
York Times story about the memo.

Byers’ allegations are currently under
scrutiny by the House Committee on
‘Assassinations. A committee source told
the Post-Dispatch Wednesday night that
the committee was still trying to assess
the significance of Byers’ story.

All names but that of Byers were
deleted from the FBI memorandum by

Nw 6828 Bieta Sh date Pen coo

Acts Branch. But the memorandum
discussed a meeting among Byers and
two men in which Byers said he “‘had
been offered either $10,000 or $20,000 to

Sources have told the Post-Dispatch
that Byers told House investigators that
Kauffmann and Sutherland, a patent
lawyer, also from Imperial, asked him to
arrange King’s murder.

The memorandum, dated March 19,
1974, was written by a St. Louis agent of
the FBI on the basis of information
supplied by an informant.

“Tn the fall of 1973,” the memorandum
reads, “‘Beyers)(the name is consistently
misspelled in the memo) talked freely

about himself and his business, and they

later went to (short deletion by FBI)

where Beyers told a story about visiting +
a lawyer in St. Louis County, now

deceased, not further identified, who had

offered to give him a contract to kill

Martin Luther King. He said that also

Present was a short, stock man, who

walked with a limp.”

‘The memorandum then continues with
this sentence, enclosed in parentheses:

“Later, with regard to the latter
individual, Beyers commented that this
man was actually the individual who
made the payoff of James Ear! Ray after
the killing.)

Several sources have told the Post-
Dispatch that Kauffmann was short,
overweight and walked with a marked
limp after being injured in an automobile
accident several years prior to the
events described by Byers,

The other man fitting that description,
however, is known to have testified
before the subcommittee in April. Roy A.
Walther II, an attorney for Byers,
refused to say whether the other man
was implicated in Byers’ testimony.
Walther said he had never heard of the
other man until the time of Byers’
testimony before the House committee.

said the man was an avowed segrega-

Select Committee:

The committee did not ask her about
the allegation that a “short, stocky man,
who walked with a limp,” had paid off
Ray, the Post-Dispatch was told by a
source familiar with her interrogation.
Mrs. Kauffmann refused to-discuss the
matter, hanging “up on a reporter
Wednesday night.

The miemorandum’s account of Byers’
story jibes.in all but one detail — the
amount of money involved — with an
account Byers gave at about the same
time to a reputablé Sf. Louisan.

Mr. ROBERT L. BENDER resides at Route 1, Box 388, Chesterfield,
Missouri 63017, residence telephone number (314) (391-6518.

. Mr. BENDER is presently unemployed, having retired from FBI
service on 2/28/77. Prior to his retirement he was assigned to
the St. Louis Field Division of the FBI from 1953 to the date of
his retirement. Additionally, he served in the capacity of
Field Supervisor in the St. Louis Division o£ the FBI for approx-
imately nine years prior to and until thé date of his retirement.
He supervised general criminal matters.

Mr. BENDER was intérviewed at the St. Louis FBI Office, at
which place he voluntarily appeared.

Mr. BENDER was exhibited sufficient portions of a closed
St. Louis file 137-16185 to enable him to identify it as a matter
which was at one time under his supervision and assigned to an
Agent under his supervision by the name of HOWARD C. KENNEDY.

The file in this instance pertains to one RICHARD F. O'HARA,
a former informant of the St. Louis Division of the FBI.

The attention of Mr. BENDER was directed to a memorandum in
this file dated 3/19/74 to the SAC, St. Louis, from Special Agent
HOWARD C. KENNEDY. This memorandum is identified as serial 5 of
the file. Mx. BENDER was ‘permitted to read this memorandum in
order to réfresh his memory concerning its. contents. Although
he had no independent recollection of the memorandum or its contents,
after réading it he concluded that the memorandum had crossed his
desk on or about 3/19/74, as attested to by the appearance of his
handwriting on the memorandum. BENDER's attention was further
directed to paragraph 2, page 3 of the memorandum, which paragraph
begins, "During the fall of 1973...," and ending with "... $20,000
to kill KING."

Mr. BENDER related that he had no independent recollection of
the paragraph in question; however, upon reviewing the éntire
memorandum dated. 3/19/74, he found no evidence that the information
contained in the above-cited paragraph was either acted upon or

disseminated beyond the file in which the memorandum is located.
He did note that there is a handwritten notation in his hand-
writing on page 1 of the memorandum which states, "Notify locals
-of info re killing." Upon reading the memorandum in detail,

it was BENDER's conclusion that this handwritten notation did
not apply to the above-cited paragraph but, instead, applied to
an unrelated matter of interest to local authorities appearing
on page 2 of the memorandum.

Mr. BENDER stated that he has absolutely no recollection
as to why the information contained in the above+cited paragraph
on page 3 of the memorandum in question was not disseminated
or acted upon. He can only assume that such failure was through
inadvertence. He can make no judgment whatsoever concerning
the credibility of the information as a possible reason for
not acting on it. BENDER related, however, that because of
his long association with the FBI in St. Louis, he does recall
an individual by the name of RUSSELL BYERS as a well-known
thief and fence. .

At the conclusion of interview, Mr. BENDER stated that in
retrospect and in light of today's climate, the information
concerning MARTIN LUTHER KING in the memorandum of 3/19/74
should have been acted upon.

Mr. HOWARD C. KENNEDY resides at 55 Harneywold Drive;
Ferguson, Missouri 63136, residence telephone number (314)
521-8221.

Mr. KENNEDY is presently self-employed as a private
investigator and polygraph examiner. He retired from FBI service
on 2/28/77. Prior to his retirement he was assigned to the
St. Louis Division of the FBI from 1954 to the date of his
retirement.. During 1974 he was assigned to general criminal _
matters and worked as a Special Agent under the supervision of
Field Supervisor ROBERT L. BENDER:

Mr. KENNEDY was interviewed at the St. Louis FBI Office,
at which place he voluntarily appeared.

Mr. KENNEDY was exhibited sufficient portions of a é¢losed
St. Louis file 137-16185 to enable him to idéntify it as a matter
which was at one time assigned to him while hé was an FBI Agent.

the file in this instance pertains to one RICHARD F. OHARA,
a forrier informant. of the St. Louis Division of the FBI. The
attention of Mr. KENNEDY was directed to a memorandum. in this
file dated 3/19/74 from him to the SAC, St. Louis. This memorandum
is identified as serial 5 of the file. He was permitted to read
this memorandum in order to refresh his memory concerning its
contents. KENNEDY related that from his review of this memorandum
it reflects the results of a contact by him with O'HARA at which
time O'HARA furnished him several pieces of information. .
-KENNEDY's attention. was further directed to paragraph 2, page 3
of the ihemorandum, which paragraph begins,"During the fall of

by reading the abové mémorandum, he vaguely recalls receiving,
the information. He has no recollection, however, of having
disséminated the information contained in. the above-cited ~

He can cite no reason for such failure other than inadvertence.

in the memorandum, and he shared this information with no
other personnel in the office.

Mr. KENNEDY was unable to provide an evaluation of the
information and he is sure that no other information concerning
KING was furnished to him by O'HARA. He can make no comment
with regard to the credibility of the information at this late
date. . He does not believe, however, that credibility of either
O'HARA or BYERS entered into any decision or lack of decision
with regard to dissemination of the information concerning KING.

KENNEDY recalls, however, from his many years of service
in the FBI at St. Louis that RUSSELL BYERS was a well-known
fence.

KENNEDY reiterated that he has no idea or reason for the
failure to disseminate the information contained in paragraph
2 of page 3 of the cited memorandum as it relates to MARTIN
LUTHER KING. He noted that there is nothing written on the
memorandum to indicate such dissemination was made or action
taken otherwise.

Mr. KENNEDY's attention was further directed to a hand-
written notation on the first page of the memorandum which
states, "Notify locals of info re killing." He identifies
this notation as being in the handwriting of his former Supervisor,
ROBERT L. BENDER. Upon reading the memorandum in detail, it
was KENNEDY's conclusion that this handwritten notation did
not apply to the above-cited paragraph but, instead, applied
to an unrelated matter of interest to local authorities
appearing on page 2 of the memorandum.

At the conclusion of interview, Mr. KENNEDY stated that

in retrospect, the information Concerning MARTIN LUTHER KING

in the memorandum of 3/19/74 should have been acted upon.

Of the Post-Dispatch Staff

A 46-year-old Rock Hill ian has:tolé
1e House Select Committee on Assassi-
ations that he was once offered $50,000
to kill the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King
r., te New York Times reported today.

Pussell G. Byers, a former auto parts
lealer who was implicated last January
in the theft of several statues from: the
St. Louis Art Museum, said he-turned

| flown tire offer in late 1966 or early 1967,
iccording to the Times. King was shot to

ideath on April 4, 1968, in Memphis, Tenn.
i} The Times story said Byers told the
-Fcommitteé that two men from Imperial,
'Mo., had offered him the money in
half of a group of conservative busi-
ndssmen to kill King. Both are now dead.
Sources said Byers’ testimony ;has ;
‘spurred an inquiry by committee investi. |
gators because his brother-in-law, John
Paul ‘Spica, was then serving a life
sentence for murder at the Missouri
State Penitentiary with James Earl Ray,

the Post-Dispatch that the toe
office of the FBI had received “certain
information’ about-the King assassifia-
tion in 1973, but would not confirnt-it
came from Byers.

file, arid then was turned up by accident.

A-Post-Dispatcl reporter who attempt-
led to-interview Byers at his residence in

‘the 9300 block of Fredric, Court was told
that Byers was out of town and was.nct
available for comment.

| The Times account of a three-month
investigation by the House committe:
indicated that investigators suspected
that word of a contract offer on King’s
life had reached the prison through
Spica, But Byers said he had told Spica
‘ofthe offer only recently, according: to
the Times,

The ‘Times said investigators are’now

and CARTER STITH
: Gf the Post-Dispatch Staff

A reputable. St. Louisan confirms that”
Russell G. Byers told him that he had ,
been offered $50,000 by two Imperial,
Mo., men to arrange the death of the

|. Rev. Dr, Martin Luther King.

Byers twice mentioned the plot, first in
generalities shortly after the assassina-
tion in 1968 and later in more detail in
about 1974, the St. Louisan told the Post-
Dispatch. He said that in the latter
conversation Byers told of a stockbroker |
taking him to the Imperial farm of a
patent lawyer to discuss the plot.
£ Byers did not use names, the promi-
BE citizen said, but he apparently tas

N.

‘eférring to stockbroker Jehin R. Kayff-
nann and lawyer John H. Sutherland,

awhom he has accused of the plot in:
recent testimony to the House annie

tions Committee.

Previous accounts of the alleged assas/ ;
sination plot have said that Byers hag
* said that he told two lawyers and other *
unidentified persons about it some years 4
ago. But this is the first direct confirma- |
tion from one of those persons. |

In another development, a Clayton !
lawyer, who has been questioned by the .'
House Assassinations Committee staff, *
told a reporter he had seen Byers and
Kauffmann meeting several times in the
late 1960s. The lawyer represented both
Kauffmann and Byers on separate legal

atters, a

The lawyers said Kauffmann hid * :

introduced him to Byers during a lunth
in about 1966..He got the impression tit
Byers and Kauffmann knew each other ‘

grom growing up in the same partjot ~
fsouth St. Louis and that they had scine ,
‘kind of business dealings in the 1960s.

Byers was panticulariy close to Kauff-
‘mana’s late brother Gil Kauffmann, who
was a deputy St. Louis County coroner
before his death in 1962, the lawyer said,

Asked whether Byers had told him
about the alleged assassination offer, the
lawyer said he could not respend be-
cause the confide relationship be- «
tween ari attorney and his client. He said
he had give the same answer to the
House committee's staff,

The lawyer's account adds new detail
‘about Byers’ relationship with Kazft-
mann. 7

assurances that their names would Rot

tf revealed. One insisted that sr news
Piper not even identify his . ups
apparently because he feared repr’
fom Byers or other. 7
The House Assassinations Committee
is conducting an intensive investigation
into Byers’ allegations. {t held ciosed
hearings on them last week, Byers was ~
reported to have told the committee that
he turned down the offer from Suther-
land and Kauffmann, which he says was
made in late 1956 or early 1967. Suther-
Jand dicd in 1970, and Kauffman died in
1973.

The St. Louisan said that Byers told
fim shortly after the King assassination
fin 1963 that he might know somethin;
spoout it, and that the Ku Klux Klan of
“some organization was behind it. q

“That's all he said. I thought it was
just street talk,” the St. Louisan said.

Later, in about 1974, Byers mentioned
the plot again. The St. Louisan gave this
account of what he said: A stockbroker -
who had Jost his license, apparently
Kauffmann, approached-Byers with the
$50,000 offer. Byers asked him whom he
had to kill. Kauffmann took Byers to a
St. Louis patent attorney who lived on 2
nearby farm in Imperial who said King
as the target. Byers said he never had
tended to follow through on the plot bu
gone along out of curiosity.
“Sutherland, the patent lawyer owned aj,
farm in Imperial near Kauffmann’s®
sper home. Sutherland was a segre-

gazionist and the organizer of the Citi-
zens Council in St. Louis, a states righ!s
giloup formed in 1964 that distributyd
ajiti-black Irerature. i
The St. Louisan said his recollectior of
+ the conversation with Byers differed in
one way from the yecently published
accounts of Byers’ testimony to the
House committee. :
“From what 1 read, Byers seems to be
saying now that he thinks Ray (James

- Earl Ray, who pleaded guilty to the King *

assfissination) is a fall guy. But that's
not2he impression I got then. 1 thougat
Russell thought they probably ap-
praiched Ray through some friendJof

prison” 2 fe pot

1. Hugh W. Maxey, the former chief, *

physician at the Missouri State Peniten-

tigry, was a friend of Kauffmann,
fhe St. Louisan said Byers had not

mentioned his brother-in-law, John Faul

, Spica, who was serving a murder <en.-
tence in the Penitentiary at the time Ray
escaped from the institution. Byers too,
in his receht statements reportedly told
the House committee that Spica was not
involved. But press accounts have specu-
Jated whether he could have transmitted
word of the $50,000 offer to Ray.

1, The St, Louisan said he believed Byera
in 1974. “I mean you do believe someon}
if You don’t have, any reason to thin
“thet lied,” he said. But in the.wake
Byers’ arrest in connection with thefts of
Statues from St. Louis Art Museum last -

+ winter, he said he wondered whether -

.| Byers might then have been in trouble
‘\too and put out the assassination story to
get the Federal Bureau of Investigation’

IF the police to ease off him. Byers was!
not prosecuted for the museum thefts.

The St. Louisan refused to say whether

quite well in the late 1950s and early,
1960s when Kauffmann was a stockbrok-
er in Clayton and a client. Kauffmann

Aalso entertained the lawyer at his Jeffer-
Fr County home.

The lawyer Said tht Kauffmann, long

Gjactive on the periphery of Democratic
“politics in St. Louis and Jefferson coun-
ties, had been involved in the presiden-
tial campaign of Alabama Gov. George
C, Wallace in 1988. Sutherland also was a
leader of the Wallace campaign here,
The lawyer said he thought only money

motivated Kauffmann to get involved ing
Wallace’s campaign or the King plot;

avohn was not a racist,” hé said. J
‘He was growing old and a httig,
ared, maybe, and he wanted money,’

¢ lawyer said. He said the same fears

diay have led to Kauffmann’s federal

onviction in 1967 for iNegally selling -

500,000 araphetamine pills. In the 1950s,

by hontrast, Kauffmann had been (in
airgraft executive, stock broker ajd
member of the St. Louis Stock Ex-
charge, But when he died his estate was
worth only $40,000. f

Kauffmann made his living in the 1960s
by selling so-called “‘penny stocks,” the
lawyer recalled. For example, Kauff-
mann would start a company with
capital of about one-cent per share and
then sell stock for $1 per share,

There was nothing illegai about that
when Kauffmann was involved, the law-
yer said, but changes in the securities
laws in later years put an end to penny
stocks and to Kauffman’s main source of
income. : sana

The lawyer said he always found Byers
to be truthful and could see no advantage
to Byers in telling about the alleged plot.
The lawyer said he thought the plot was
plausible. He represented Byers in a.
civil case about five years ago.

So far, there has been no corroboration
of Byers" allegation or any credible link
to Ray. The wives of both Sutherland and
Kauffmann have told the House commit-
tecithat they knew nothing about suciia

that their husbands could be involved|in

Byers told the New York Times in an

commit the murder, but who could be

scribed him as a “‘middle man” in crim-

The Times said investigators are now
concentrating on a theory of conspiracy.

4°" Spica, 40, interviewed by a Post-
Dispatch reporter this morning, said,
“Byers is a liar.” i

Interviewed at the fruit stand he
operates at Shaw and Vandeventer ave-
nues, Spica Said, "At no time did I ever
convey an offer of $60,000.to James Earl
Ray to kill Martin Luther King Jr. Byers
never told me about that.”

Spica said he and Ray were prisoners
in the Missouri Penitentiary at the same
time, “but we never worked together in
the same section.

“T did see him (Ray) from. time to

time but I didn’t know anything about .

any contract to'kill Martin Luther King,”
Spica said.
“The investigators in Washington know

+ all about Byers’ story and, they have

eerie

it out and they know there's no

truth in it,” Spica said,
He said that an investigator had talked
to him but had informed him that he
would not be called before the House

committee,
‘Spica, who was paroled in 1973, ap-
red nervous and shaken and said he
* feared news stories about Byers’ allega-
tions would destroy his present life:

“You know I'm out on a life parole on |

amurder case, and this‘! blow it,” Spica
said, “I've been working in this stand 12
to 15 hours a day for two years without a
vacation, Y'ye-been going-with a
nice girl who doesn’t

«background, and it'll blow that, too.

“F guess I'll just to close up because I
won't have any business any more,”
Spica said.

Byers also told the House committee
that he had told an informer for the
Federal Bureau, of Investigation about

‘very .
now all ‘my

“(hE $50,000-offer {6 Kill Ring; the ‘Times
id.

Byers said the FBI office in St, Louis
had been given details of the offer, but
had never investigated, according to the

. Times report,

‘A source close.to the St. Louis FBI
office told the Post-Dispatch that he had
nevér heard of the information cn: the

alleged approach to Byers.

In Washington, FBI jan Homer
Boynton told the Post-Dispatch that
“certain information relating to the Mar-

tin Luther King assassination” was
farnsted tothe St. Louis FBI office in
973.

“We're not saying that it was reliable
information,” he said. “We're just say-
ing certain information was furnished.””
He declined to say whether the informa-
tion eame from Byers.

Boynton said the information was
never investigated by the St. Louis

office. He said it was not cross-indexed

under the Martin Luther King file, as it
should have been, :

Last March, Boynton said, St. Louis
FBI agents discovered the material

. More or less by accident.

“They were reviewing a file in connec-
tion with another matter," he sai
as a result of that, they
information and realized that it had
never been properly indexed, And they
immediately advised FBI headquar-
ters.” :

*+ Boynton said the St, Louis field office
then sent the information to FBI head-
quarters in.Washington. FBI headquar-
ters in turn gave it to the Department of

Justice, and the Department of Justice

turned it over to the House Select
ao ‘on Assassinations, Boynton
“Tt was just put in the filé,” Boynton
said of the 1973+information. “Nothing
further was done with it,” until it was
found last March.

Asked whether the 1973 tip stiould.have
been investigated, Boynton said he was
not going to second-guess the judgment

id, “and
found the .

“of the FBI agent in St. Louis wh,
led it.

“Tt’s.kind.of hard to tell what judg-
‘ment the agent and the supervisor made,
about thé reliability” of the information,
Boynton said, “In the Kennedy investiga-
tion, we checked out thousands and
thousands of these. Some af them Were|
very bizarre. And many of them ended inj
absolutely nothing. And it could have
been the judgment of the agents that this;
was not worthy of following through on:”*!
“Boynton said he could not discuss the!
specifics of the allegations-as reported inl
the Times. :

He said the FBI is not currently!
investigating the information. that was!
furnished in 1973. He said the agency had

-an agreement with the House committee:

that the committee would investigatel
such leads unless the panel asked the
FBI for help. :

A member of the House committee’s
staff in' Washington said it was commit-
tee policy not to confirm or.deny reports
about. matters related to the King and
‘Kennedy assassinations, He said thé
‘committee's findings would be. contained
in its final report'to Congress, which is
due by the end of the year,

at dust can’t comment,” the staff
mem! poses ns

‘The Times story said House investiga-
tors learned that Byers believed theoffer
to him had been an effort to recruit a
“fall guy” who would not actually
commit the murder, but who would be
arrested for it, .

‘A St. Louis Police Department captain
who investigated the Art Museum thefts
said he had heard recently that Byers
testified before the House committee.

Other officers in the Police Depart-
nient’s intelligence unit said Byers was’
seen frequently at Spica’s fruit stand.
Byers had been charged in connection
with the Art Museum thefts, but the
charges were later dropped. by the St,
Louis circuit attorney's office.

‘previously looked at. This was the first meeting with in-

that had been priced at about $50, but purchased for $15

item, exhibiting considerable interest in and knowledge
of antiques. He left the store without buying anything,

tea set, deseribed as golden brown, with a set of cups and
saucers, pitcher, sugar, and creamer, having a goid-brown

but he offered to sell it for $300. He then identified hine
self as RUSSELL BEYERS. He is belived to be a very intelli~
gent, percerfive person. No business was transacted.- On
that occagfon, however, BEYERS “opened up't with informant,

adviss that he is personally represented by Attorney MURRAY.
RANDSEL (former attorney, USDJ, and former AUSA, EDHO), and

“he and RANDALL are very close personal friends. He said
had inquired of an individual at OX Novelty Co., St. Louis,
aiso inquiring of informant as to “what kind of guy" was the
informant, He said he had learned that he could talk to
informant, advising further that it was his understanding
thaté informant was not a "snitch'*, He also advised that he

had personally sent the aforementioned binack couple into

informant's shop to "have him knocked off", but that after
learning that he could be trusted, he had advised the black
couple against taking anything from him, He asserted that

if there was anything in,St. Louis that informant wanted to
buy, he would have it stolen and sell it to him at the right
price. He came into infarmant!s shop at least once or twice
Zor the next several wekks, and shortly after the aforemen~

‘tioned second meeting in the shop, BEYERS told informant that

he had a painting recently stolen, referring to it as the

- “Norman Rockwell", He said he intended "to have it on ice",

but would sell it to informant for $5,000, tnzormant advised
he personally contacted his Lawyer, inquiring as to whether
it would be feasible to buy the painting and sell it to an
Ansurane company. Reportedly, this lawyer, not identified
by informant, made sone inquiries and found that the involved

for same. A few days later, BEYERS again came to the shop
offering to sell the painting for $3,000, and then made

: a final offer to sell it for $2,000. BEYERS then said that
i the painting was “going into cold storage". BEYERS has
never again mentioned this paintings

‘ During the fall of 1973, Live ox six months ago,
: date not recalled, BEYERS came to the shop inquiring as to
' whether they could get together to talk, and they later did
so at Pizza and Cream, Clayton, Mos, in the area of a Brot
- Dugan Paint Store, where informant had traveled on business,
BEYERS talked freely about himself and his business, and
. they later went to informant's house where BEYERS told a story
+ about visiting a lawyer in St. Louis County, now deceased,
: not further identified, who had offered to give him a contract
to kill MARTIN LUTHER KING. He said that also present was a
short, stocky man, whe waiked with a limp. (Later, with a=
atter individual, BEYERS comiented that this
man was agtiilly the individual who made the payoff of JANES...
#7 after the kiliing.) BEYERS said he had declined to
this contract, He did remark thatthis lawyer had
Confederate flags and other items about the house that might
indicate that he was "a real rebel", BEYERS also commented
that he had been offered either $10,000 or $20,000 to kill

: Sometime later, informant takked to JOSEPH "JOD",

OLIVESYRO, & known fence, with whom he is acquainted.” This™
—thdiyidual advised informant that BEYERS truly is a "very
trecherous guy", cautioning him to stay away from him &2
he wanted to stay out of treubie. 7

About two or three months ago, BEYERS telephoned
him at 7:00 on night, probably a Monday night, date not re-
ealied, advising that he was going t@ kill @ North St. Louis
man, indicating that the man had "gnitched Sof guns", He said
BEYERS could have said that the man had "snitched Sef arugs",
At 10:00 P.M, the same night, BEYERS again called him, ad=
vising that ‘the job is done", ‘he next day, iformant read

At sbous*that same time, informant recalied that
BEYERS inquired“is to whether he knew anyone by the name
who Lives somewhere in West St. Louis
County. BRZERS veferred to him as an old man, believed
by him toiave stolen some paintings in Florida. BEYERS
said he intended to find out whether the man had the painte
»dpgs and if so, he intended to have them stolen from hin.

About one month prior to the date of the reported
burglary of the Jefferson Memorial, St. Louis, in which seve
‘ eral items of Lindbergh trophies were taken, exact date not
recalled, BEYERS came to his shop asking him if he was in-
terested in buying any articles from the Jefferson Memorial,
commenting specifically that he had in mind some “commemora=
tive pieces" that were included in the Lindbergh trophies.
Enformant said he told him this would be ‘tao hot to handle*
whereupon BEYERS said they could be used to "set up enemies"
by “atashing them in the trunk of somebody's car", informant
said he told BEYERS he was not interested in that kind of
job since he had heen in trouble once (robbery of Four Seasons
Antique Shop) and did not care to get in that kind of trouble
again, Within several days, informant heard the news of the
breakin of the Jefferson Memorial and the theft of several
items there, A day or two after that publicity, BEYERS came
to informant's shop, advising that "how rive got my hands
full = X¥'ve got a lot of problems", Informant recalled that
it appeared BEYERS had not shaven for several days, Ordi«
harily, BEYERS is a very conservati, well-dressed person,

BEYERS never egain mentioned the Jefferson Memorial
‘~ items, and he never mentioned same to BEYERS, despite the
recent publicity.

Ne firmly believes that BEYERS at one time had
both these items and the Norman Rockwell painting and may
still have same, He does not believe that BEYERS would ever
confess to anything, BEYERS having told him on one occasion
that the police would never get anywhere with him since he
absolutely would never talk, even if confronted with informac
tion from other sources attributed to him.

attorney. :

The interview was preceded by a conference with SA
JAY ALDHIZER, and a legal briefing by SA RON HELLER, at the

UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE

FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION

duly 24, 1978

HOUSE SELECT COMMITTEE ON ASSASSINATIONS

Former Special Agent Harold R. Dobson (1941 - 1972),
residence: 8831 Bracken Circle, St. Louis, Missouri 63123,
who was St. Louis case Agent on the M. L. King - James Earl Ray
case in 1968, was interviewed, not under oath, by Mr. Michael
Eberhardt, Assistant Deputy Chief Counsel to the House Select
Committee on Assassinations, at the offices of that committee,
Room 3386, Second and "D" Streets, Southwest, Washington, D. C.,
from 2:00 P.M. to 2:45 P.M. on the afternoon of June 28, 1978,
at which time he furnished the following information in response
to direct questions: a

Dobson served as a Special Agent of the Federal Bureau
of Investigation from October 20, 1941 to retirement on June 30;
1972, being assigned to the Boston, Newark, St. Paul, and St.
Louis Divisions. He was in St. Louis from 1947 until retirement.
He was assigned to the Security Squad from 1948 to retirement,
concerned primarily with investigation of the Communist Party and
its members, nationalistic tendency, espionage, sabotage, and
Security of Government Employee cases. He had comparatively
little knowledge or experience regarding New Left, racial and hate
group cases. He was an alternate supervisor but declined

* authorization as supervisor for personal reasons.

Dobson was generally aware of the existence of the
Cointel Program in St. Louis, but was unable to recall any
specific activities, objectives, or accomplishments of same.

Dobson was unable to suggest why the case was assigned
to him, except that he had the first S$ Louis lead in the case,
to trace the weapon used. through officials of Browning Arms
Company, with whom he had continuing liaison, and for the further
reason he had been utilized in an administrative capacity on

virtually every major case of national importance in the St.
Louis Division beginning with the surveillance and apprehension
of St. Louis Communist Party leaders in 1952. Ancther Special
Agent since retired handled the Ray penitentiary escape~case
prior to the assassination. 7 nee

Special Agent in Charge Thomas Gearty supervised the
King case in St. Louis. It was Dobson's responsibility to
coordinate the investigation, handle the resulting "mountain of
paper", see that obvious, logical, reasonable, or merely
desirable leads or avenues of investigation were appropriately
assigned (with Special Agent in Charge approval), promptly and
adequately covered, and properly reported, and to keep the
Special Agent in Charge, Bureau, Memphis, and other interested
offices promptly advised of pertinent developments.

Until the true identity of Ray was established, every
Special Agent in the St. Louis Division was assigned exclusively
to the case. Twenty-four hour coverage of all leads was
mandatory. Developments of the day were discussed, and “brain
busting" sessions were held at nightly conferences of all
Special Agents, at which most new assignments were made. Ail
employees clearly gave of their best efforts.

Dobson was unable to recall specifically what efforts
were made to determine the whereabouts of John. Ray on the day
of the assassination. He suggested the file would be'the best
evidence “in this regard. He believed the possibility of John
Ray's involvement was undoubtedly recognized and that SES
steps were taken to resolve.

Dobson was unable to recall any surreptitious entries
to Ray's relatives' premises. St. Louis had no technical
surveillances on relatives. Requests for authorization for
same may have been made, but if so, were without his knowledge.

To the extent of his knowledge, the ‘St. Louis Division
had never placed a technical surveillance on King.

Toll call records of relatives were obtained in
accordance with a then current Bureau poiicy subpoena process.
Relative bank accounts were monitored and results set forth in
reports with a statement that the information would only be
available after issuance of a subpoena duces tecum. Coverage of
relatives consisted of this, plus personal interviews and contacts

abIV68262_Docid:32989797 Page 133 |



® e

HOUSE SELECT COMMITTEE ON ASSASSINATIONS

with informants, sources, neighbors, and associates, ana
available public records.

Relatives were initially uncooperative in varying
degrees, but subsequently became generaily cooperative,
although Dobson never fully trusted any of them. He was unable
to recall any evidence developed that Ray was ever in St. Louis
territory, or in contact with any relatives there, subsequent to
his penitentiary escape. He doubted financial contributions to
Ray by them, as their combined incomes and assets, in his
estimation, were insufficient to support the life style Ray
apparently enjoyed following his escape.

Debson had no -knowledge or any information as to the
source of Ray's income following his escape. He conjectured
the same would have logically had to result from successful
eriminal activity or be contributed by an unknown person or
group. He recognized Ray's record stamped him as a "loser",
but opined it was not beyond the realm of possibility access
to an excellent prison library and association with convicts
less unsuccessful than himself could have enhanced the quality

- of Ray's thought processes to a point where he could. have
conceived and carried out a successful supermarket or other
similar robbery. At least his escape was succéssful. He
considered Ray's technically proper preparation and filing of a
motion for a new trial, which was pending at the time of his
escape, as evidence of this possibility. Dobson recalled that,
as a Missouri prosecutor prior to entering the Bureau, he had
uniformly recommended alternative punishment for non-habitual
criminals, as the Missouri Penitentiary, even then, was generally
considered a "finishing school for criminals". Supermarkets
offered the possibility of being almost as lucrative as banks,
without the disadvantage of incurring Federal jurisdiction. He
feels sure major police departments in the St. Louis territory
had been contacted to determine if Ray could be a logical
suspect in unsolved supermarket robberies. He recalled some
indication Ray might have been involved ina bank robbery in
Alton, Illinois and that the Springfield, Illinois Division had
been so advised, but he had no knowledge as to the outcome of
investigation there.

Dobson was ‘generally aware of the existence of white
hate organizations, but was of the opinion members of such
organizations in St. Louis territory lack sufficient organization,

NW 68262 Docld:32989797 Page 134__



HOUSE SELECT COMMITTEE ON ASSASSINATIONS

é .

{ intelligence, and financial capability for significant

' involvement in the King killing. Such organizations, in his

{ estimation, should have been able to reasonably forésee _

i King's death would elevate him to the status of a martyr,
which would have been counterproductive to their aims and

purposes. He was of the further opinion that any intelligent”

co-conspirator would undoubtedly have eliminate Ray as a

security measure. He suggested that, if then current rumors

that King had become a liability to the Southern Christian

Leadership Conference were true, that organization had the most

to gain from King's demise.

“All St. Louis informants, potential informants and
sources regarding criminal, security, racial, hate group, or
other matters, were under continuing instructions to immediately
report even the slightest information which they could obtain
ox which might come to their attentiori regarding the King case.

Dobson recalled John Gawron as an elderly, self-
confessed habitual criminal, who had lived with Ray's mother
several years until her death. He never met, saw,'or talked to
Gawron. If Gawron was initially carried as a PCI, but later
appeared openly, Dobson was unable to recall why, but suggested
Gawron may have initially indicated some potential for
furnishing information regarding current criminal matters and
was later found incapable of doing so. Having lived with Ray's
mother, Gawron was undoubtedly able to furnish some factual
personal history and background information as to the family
in the past, but it was Dobson's impression that Gawron was not
fully trusted by them and was capable of furnishing only
conjectural information as to their then current activities.
According to Agents handling Gawron, he would start with a halif-
truth or conjecture, and embroider upon it, and therefore was
considered generally to be unreliabie.

St. Louis Agents contacting released fellow inmates
were instructed to not only obtain all possible information as
to Ray's whereabouts, but all possible information as to their
degree of association with him, his sentiments, his plans, the
identities of any associates or friends either in or out of
prison, and the manner of his escape.

NW 68262 Docld:32989797 Page 135 _

HOUSE SELECT COMMITTEE ON ASSASSINATIONS

Dobson was unable to recall any telephonic.contacts
with the Memphis case agent, although there may have beén one
or two. He was in frequent telephonic contact with the
Chicago Assistant Special Agent in Charge, who was handling
‘the case there, as Jerry Ray made at least one trip to visit
St. Louis relatives.

Dobson never met, saw, or spoke with any Ray relatives,
with the exception of Jerry Ray who contacted him telephonically
on two or three occasions during a visit to St. Louis pursuant
to instructions from the Chicago Division.

‘Dobson had no idea as to the basis for any friction
which may have existed between Director Hoover and King. Mr.
Hoover never confided in Dobson and never sought his advice.

cal 8/30/68

. On August 23, 1968, Mr. HARVEY A. KLINGEMAN and Mrs.
CLARA S. KLINGEMAN,owners, Indian Trail Restaurant, 507
Chestnut Street, Winnetka, Illinois, phone HI 6-1703,
residence 391 Linden, Winnetka, Illinois, phone HI 6-2932,

., were interviewed jointly in the conference room at the Winnetka,
Illinois, Police Department, after being introduced to the
interviewing Agents by Chief DON DERWING (NA), Winnetka,
Illinois, Police Department. :

They advised that on Tuesday, August 20, 1968, they
were contacted by WILLIAM BRADFORD HULE, Hartselle, Aabama,
who is the author of "Three Lives For Mississippi". Mr. HUIE
was accompanied by Mr. (First Name Unknown. ) HANSEN, who is
a photographer for "Look"! magazine. Mr. HUIE exhibited
letters which he claimed were from JAMES EARL RAY and were
addressed to a Mississippi attorney. These letters were
purportedly given to HUIE by the attorney. HULE told them
that he had obtained all commercial rights to RAY's story
and for this he has agreed to underwrite the costs of RAY's
defense in the forthcoming murder trial in Memphis, Tennessee.
The aforementioned letters were writted on half sheets of
yellow legal foolscap and both of the KLINGEMANs stated that
they recognized the handwriting on these papers as that of the
subject RAY, whom they knew under the name of JOHN RAYNS. At
this point, the KLINGEMANs were exhibited several photographs
of the subject, JAMES EARL RAY, along with other photographs
and they both positively identified JAMES EARL RAY as a man
employed by them from May 3, 1967; to June 24,1967, as a
dishwasher and cook's helper. The KLINGEMANs verified the
foregoing statement by furnishing to the interviewing Agents
their payroll ledger sheet. A review of the ledger sheet
reveals the foliowing information:

They also made available the following listed

are endorsed by JOHN L. RAYNS or JOHN RAYNS, two of which have
the address 1648 Lunt, Chicago, underneath the signature.
These checks. are as follows: 7

The foregoing checks total $664.34.

Mr. KLINGEMAN advised that to the best of his
recollection at this time, the last check, Number 5357, was
mailed to RAY's brother, name urirecalled, in Northbrook,
Illinois, at RAY's request since ‘he left his’ employment
prior to recéipt of the check, stating that he was going to
work on boats with his brother. As Mr. KLINGEMAN recalls,
he’ received a letter from RAY requesting that the pay due be
sent to his brother.

32989797 Page 158



CG 44-1114

Both. of the KLINGEMANs characterized JAMES EARL
RAY as an excelient employee, quiet, attentive, prompt,
polite, a very good wotker, but to their knowledge,
had no friends or visitors during the time of his
‘employment. They did recall that during the subject's
last week of employment, he received three or four phone :
calls from a male individual who stted that he was RAY's brother.
‘They could not recall the individual's name,nor did they
believe that they would recognize this person's voice if they
heard it again.

In conversation with Mr. HUIE, the KLINGEMANs
received the following information on a confidential basis. and
advised that they were rather reluctant to divulgé it,
but felt that it was their duty as citizens. They requested
that this information bemintained on a confidential basis within
the FBI. They advised that they contacted Chief DERNING
because of his reputation and are now following his advice in
furnishing this information to the FBI: :

Mr. HUIE dowed the KLINGEMANs letters from RAY in
which RAY listed employment at the Indian Trail Restaurant.
(It should be noted that this restaurant is an old, large,
upper class restaurant, of excellent reputation. Chief
DERNING advised that the KLINGEMANs themselves have an
excellent reputation within the community and that he holds
them in very high regard). HUIE told them that RAY had
served seven years of a twenty-year sentence at Jefferson,
Missouri, prison, during which time he had eight visitors,
one of whom was his brother, however, HUIE did not identify
which one. Prior to his escape, RAY'had stashed away
a razor, green prison trousers which had been dyed black, and
12 hersey bars in anticipation that. he would have to go
without food for, some time. RAY also had $300 in his shoe.
He escaped in alréd truck and walked to Chicago, Illinois,
from Jefferson City, Missouri, which took him about eight

eal days. (The KLINGEMANs do recall that when the subject first
appered at the restaurant, his feet were swollen and that
their sister-in-law gave him two Ace bandages to use which he
returried three or four days later. | This supposedly was
mentioned in the letter in HUIE's possession). :

Thereafter, RAY read the advertisement in the

Tribune whrein the KLINGEMANs had advertised for help in the
restaurant. HUIE said that the subject in the letter

NW 68262 Docld:32989797 Page 159



CG 44-1114

4

mentioned that the employment at. the Indian Trail Restaurant
was the “high point of his life’. 7 :
L . it

HUIE mentioned that RAY had had only three jobs
in his life, one of which was in a shoe factory outside of
East St. Louis, Illincis, which ws prior to his going to
prison the last time. He also said that during the time RAY
was employed at the restaurant, he was "tapped on the shoulder"
by an individual who recognized him and who threatened to
reveal his identity to the policé and cause RAY's return to
Prison if he, RAY, did not work for this person. HUIE said
that RAY was given $1,200 during the initial contacts,by"the
alleged conspitators, and was ultimately paid $15,000, but
was due to receive more. : :

: Again, according to HUIE, RAY was told to go to
Canada to investigate the difficulty of crossing the border.
Supposedly RAY made two trips through the Detroit Tunnel into
Canada. He also made a third trip to Canada, date and
sequence not given, and "was instructed'to obtain a 40-year-
old newspaper, get the names of the males born that de,
and search the current phone directory for similar names.

He was then to surveil the individuals with similar names to
determine whether or not his physical description was

similar to theirs. Thereafter,he telephoned persons of his
like description, utilizing a pretext, and thereby found a manr
who had never applied for a pasSport. RAY then applied for a
passport in this name.

The KLINGEMANs .advised that they were not sure that
they were furnishing this information in its proper a
sequence, but that to the best of their recollection, the -- ~
information preceding and following was given to them in this
order by HUIK. Thereafter,RAY was given more money to roe
purchase a Mustang which was to be driven to Acapulco, Mexico
for the purpose of obtaining a tourist sticker. He then.
drove through Mexico to the West Coast and. hid out there to
receive further instructions from the other individuals in
the alleged conspiracy. HUIE stited that RAY was flown to
Atlanta from the West Coast, but the time was not right, there
Was no action andbe was sent back to California. He was also ©
told to be in Mississippi at a certain time and place.
Supposedly Reverend MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR. was at ax Holiday
Inn Motel in Atlanta, Georgia, when RAY was flown :there.

|. NW 68262 Docld:32989797' Page 164

CG 44-1114

Subsequently, RAY was given money to obtain binoculars
and a shotgun and was to go to Memphis to be somewhere at
3 p.m. in room 312 or33. Supposedly there were other
individuals who also came to this room and there was a
Negro male who purportedly called KING out to the balcony.
According to HUIE, the actual murderer of KING was not RAY,
although RAY was present and at a later time (probably the trial)
RAY will identify the murderer. RAY did pick up the rifle, ran

“to his car, and sped to a rendezvous in Atlanta, Georgia.

He was supposed to pick up a "bundle of money", however, the
conspirators did not appear. RAY allegedly spent several days
or hours at this apartment in Atlanta, Georgia,awaiting the
arrival of his "fellow conspirators". :

According to HUIE, the plan was for RAY to go to
Mexico, but immediately fly north to throw off pursuit and
to steer all investigation to Mexico. However, since
the conspirators did not appear in Atlanta, RAY fled to. Canda
thereafter utilizing his knowledgé to obtain a passport and
fled to England. .

: The KLINGEMANs advised that the rest of HUIE's story
substantially follows the newspaper accounts which appeared
after subject RAY's arrest in England. They did note that
HUIE stated that RAY did rob a bank in London because he
“got real low on money". HUIE at no time identified the
alleged fellow conspirators of RAY. He did swear the KLINGEMANs
to secrecy and told them that he would mail the "Look"
proofs. on September 10,1968, and the story would be in the
November 10,1958, issue of Look magazine. Both Mr. and Mrs.
KLINGEMAN advised that they would make these proofs available to
te interviewing Agents for review.

The KLINGEMANs advised that RAY began working for
them as a dishwasher and because of his excellent attitude
was advanced to cook's helper. During the time he was in
their employ, they did not observe him in a car, nor did they
know him to own, an automobile. He had no visitors, he did
not wear glasses, he had no women friends, nor did he make
any advances toward the female personnel employed at the
restaurang and they noted that his hair was "less bushy" duting
the time he was at the restaurant than shown in the :
photographs. :

They are not sure how he came to work from his
apartment, but believe hemight have beenrmet at the Eden's
Expressway by WILLIE PERRY and FRED BURNS, who were also
employees at the restaurant.



‘*. the Negro race and specifically no comments whatsoever cori- -

.. when RAY received the phone calls during his last week of
- employment he seemed to be disturbed and that his
. concentration on his work was not as good as it usually was.

Janes EARL RAY left England, he was going to Lisbon to get to

CG 44-1114

i His conduct was excellent and they cannot recall .
him making any comments one way or another about members of

cerning MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR. RAY madé no, referérice to his

previous employent, but did mention that he was in.
Brimerhaven, Germany, during World War II. ‘They advised that

They then recalled that according to HUIE, that when

Africa, howéver, he was unable. to do so which is when he returned
to England and held up a bank receiving about $200 in loot. .
They again stated that the information furnished to them by

-  HUIE came fromJetters which RAY had written to his attornsy, who
‘in turn turned them over to the author. Also Mr. KLINGEMAN

stated that in one of the letters which he believed was to
the attorney from RAY, while he was in London, England, there

‘was a drawing identifying a location ‘which appeared to be

Diversey Street and Shéffield Avenue in Chicago, Iliinois.

At the conclusion of the interview, the Klingemans
again requested that this information be maintained in
confidence and expressed a willingness to co-operate with

. the FBI in ay way possible.

HOUSE SELECT COMMITTEE ON ASSASSINATIONS (HSCA)

In the couse of a file review in an unrelated
matter, SL 3167-C, St. Louis File 137~16185, Bureau File
137-36945, was reviewed. This file contained a contact
memorandum dated March 19, 1974, which contained information
relating to several criminal matters and also contained the
following paragraph:

"During the Fall of 1973, five or six months ago,
date not recalled, Beyers came to the shop inquiring as
to whether they could get together to talk, and they later
did so at Pizza and Cream, Clayton, Mo., in the area of a
Broad~Dugan Paint Store, where informant had traveled on
business. Beyers talked freely about himself and his
business, and they later went to informant's house where
Beyers told a story about visiting a lawyer in St. Louis
County, now deceased, not further identified, who had
offered to give him a contract to kill Martin Luther King.
He said that also present was a short, stocky man, who
walked with a limp. (Later, with regard to the latter
individual, Beyers commented that this man was actually
the individual who made the payoff of James Earl Ray after
the killing.) Beyers said he had declined to accept this
contract. He did remark that this lawyer had confederate
flags and other items about the house that might indicate
that he was ‘a real rebel'. Béyers also commented that
he had been offered either $10,000 or $20,000 to kill King."

Extensive further research in the St. Louis indices
and files failed to reveal this information was if any way
disseminated and the information simply reposes in the informant
file.

INTERVIEW OF SPECIAL AGENT WILLIAM R. DUNCAN,
ST. LOUIS DIVISION, BY STAFF INVESTIGATORS
ON NOVEMBER 21 AND 29, 1977, AND HIS
TUSTINONY BOFORE THE SUB-COMMITTEE

ON NOVEMBER 30, 1977

At approximately 3:00 p.m., November 21, 1977,
Special Agent (SA) William R. Duncan was interviewed by
Mrs. Sheila Lee and Mr. Michael Everhart, Attorneys for
the House Select Committee on Assassinations, at the U. S.
House of Representatives, Annex Number Two, Washington, D.G

SA Duncan was told his name came up as. having made an
offer in the Louisville Police Department to kill Dr. Martin
Luther King in 1965. Duncan told them he was assigned to the
Louisville Division of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)
/from February, 1952, until May, 1967, and had responsibilities
as Liaison Agent with the Louisville Police Department during
most of this period.

‘fhe allegation involved an incident which allegedly
took place at a roll-call time in the First District Office
sonetime in the fall of 1965. Reportedly making the allega-
tion was Clifton Baird, white male, 50, a retired Louisville
police officer who retired in 1975 after 27 years of srvice.
Also present was Chief of Datectives, Major Robert Gregory, .
Captain Priest ti. Fry, formerly Chief of Detectives and possibly
the Captain of the First District; Lieutenant James Bibb, a
uniformed First District Lieutenant; Sergeant Brent Hardin, a
Third District Sergeant; possibly Herman Mitchell, Homicide
Squad; Lioutenant Vernon Austin; and possibly Robert E. Peters
(SA), formerly of the Louisville Division of the FBI.

an offer to kill Dr. Martin Luther King. The clipping came
in the regular FBI mail and Duncan stated he did not know who
sent it to him.

A few days later, while on the phone to ex-FBI Supervisor
Robert E. Peters in Louisville regarding a social engagement,
Duncan asked him about the clipping and who Clifton Baird was
and what the clipping referred to. Peters said Baird was a
tall, heavy-set man who was in the Vice Squad for a while and
that Duncan should have known him from seeing him in the Vice
Squad while Duncan worked with the Detective Bureau in Louis=
ville.

Approximately April 25, 1977, FBI Headquarters sent a
sommunication to Louisville and St. Louis FBI Offices request-
ing the present locations of former Special Agent in Charge of
Louisville, Bernard C. Brown; Supervisor Robert E, Peters;
and SA William R, Duncan as they were named by former Police
Officer Clifton Baird alleging casinbbiceasbaniad in. the Martin
Luther King assassination case.

SA Duncan initially had no recollection of the incident
and he called former SA Peters at Louisville and asked him if
he knew anything about this. Peters replied that he had no
idea. Duncan later called retired Police Captain John Hampton
of Louisville, a close personal friend, to determine if he
knew anything about this. Hampton advised he did not know
but would ask and find out what he could and call Duncan. He
later called back and gavé the names. of some police officers
who. had been interviewed and named former Major Priest M. Fry;
former Major Robert Gregory; Lieutenant James Bibb; Sergeant
Brent Hardin and Lieutenant Vernon Austin. Hampton apparently
talked to Austin and advised that he had learned that the event”
was supposed to have taken place in the First District Offices
sometime in 1964 or 1965. Duncan called Lieutenant Vernon
Austin, whom he had known for 25 years, and asked him about the
Matter. Austin related to Duncan who the Committee had asked
about and generally who was supposed to be present when the
alleged offer took place.

Duncan told the investigators that he had no recollection
concerning this matter and that he had in fact not slept and
walked the floor a number of nights for approximately ten days
to two weeks, At this time he recalled one night that Sergeant
flilliam Baker of the First District Vice Squad met him in the

INTERVIEW OF SPECIAL AGENT WILLIAM R. DUNCAN

second floor hallway sometime in the afternoon arid asked
Duncan to help him with a joke with a couple of officers
at the First District. ‘Duncan was told to go to the roll<call
at roll~gall time and say that he had heard that there wasa
$250,000 or $500,000 reward for the death of Dr. Martin Luther
King and was to add to or verify something that had already
been said. Duncan recalled going down to the area and making
the general statement that he had heard that there was a

$250,006 or $500,000-price on Dr. Martin Luther King from
either the Ku Klux Klan or the Communist Party. Duncan added
if verification was wanted, one should contact Bob Peters or
B. C. Brown of the PBI.

Duncan did not recall who was there except several
uniformed officers who were coming and going and that there
were several in the area, There were a number of questions
regarding whether it was'a big roll-call area er the Captain's,
Sergeant's, Lieutenant's offices or a hallway. Duncan was
asked whether or not there were three or a dozen people present
and Duncan replied that there could have been between three
and twelve people, exact number: unrecalled.

Duncan was asked whether Eob Peters was there. Duncan
said he did not recall his being there, otherwise he would
mot have made the statement that “if you want to verify the
price on Dr. Martin Luther King contact Bob Peters or B. C.
Brown." Duncan identified one person he thought waa there as
Arlie Blaire (because Duncan had heard that he was supposed to
have been there from tha questions asked). Duncan recalled a
younger, red-haired officer with a crew-cut or brush-cut.
Duncan said he had talked to Blaire and possibly his partner
in connection with a fugitive murder case that Duncan was
working. :

Duncan was asked about his relationship with Robert Peters
and also with Fry, Hardin, Gregory, Bibb, Austin, Herman
Mitchell, John Mitchell and B. C. Brown of the FBI.

The committee Investigators apparently could not under-
stand why Duncan could not remember who was at the meeting.
They asked Duncan about an attempted bombing of Sergeant Brent
Hardin's car and if Duncan worked on the case. buncan recalled
a borib being placed on Hardin's car but that it apparently did
not go off. Duncan recalled it was possibly in conriection with

an election regarding sone of the police organizations.
Duncan did nat recall whether the FI worked on the case
at all other than to offer the FBI Laboratory facilities;
however, Duncan did not work on the borbing of the car.

Duncan was asked about the Louisville Chapter of the
Fraternal Order of Police (FOP) and if it was a racist or a
white-hate group. bBunean replied he did not know, but he
did receive a plaque and an honorary life-tima menbership
in the Louisville Chapter of the FOP for cooperation with
the Louisville Folice Department when he transferred from
Louisville in 1967 and that this plaque was signed by Licu-

ROUSE SELECT COMMITTEE ON ASSASSINATIONS,
U. S, HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,
INTERVIEW OF SPECIAL AGENT WILLIAM R. DUNCAN

On November 29, 1977, Duncan again contacted Committee
Staff Members Mrs. Sheila Lee, Mr. Michael Everhart and Mr.
William Hebb.

Dunean told them that he had recalled that he might have
known Aaron Duke, Arlie Blaire'’s partner. Duncan recalled a
person described as a white male, in his late 30's or early
40's as o£ 1965 or 1966, stocky, not fat, with gray cropped
hair, approximately 5° 10" and 180-185-190 pounds.

Duncan advised that he had no first-hand knowledge of
Dr. King and Mr. Hoover's difficulty but that he had heard
rumors about it and had a faint recollection that he may have
mentioned this at the time he told of the KuHlux Klan and/or
the Communist Party rumor in the First District Police area.

Duncan told them that he did not tell someone of his
recollection as a joke earlier because when the communication
was received from the Burcau, it was pointed out that he would
be contacted regarding the matter by the Committee Investiga~
tors and that he would at that time be briefed by legal personnel
from FBIHQ.

Duncan was asked if he had discugsed this matter wth
anyone outside the Bureau and his family. Duncan told them
he had talked one tine with Lieutenant Vernon Austin by phone
and he did not discuss the joke other than ask if it could
have been a joke. Duncan told them he had discussed it with
Robert Peters at least on three occasions. Once when it came
to his attention from a newspaper clipping, once when he re-
veived a communication from FBI Headquarters, and one time after
he realized that it was a joke, at which time he told Peters
that he (Peters) and B. C. Brown had nothing to do with it.
Duncan was asked about their get-together for the foothall
game on November Il-12, 1977. Duncan told them that Duncan
and Peters seriously considered not getting together for this
year's football game bat decided since they had known each
other for 25 years and had plans to attend this football gane
for over a year, that they would go ahead and get together.
they agreed not to discuss the matter, however.

Dunean also told them that when he realized that it was
a joke and that he was involved, he contacted a long-tine
personal friend and lawyer to assist in the analysis and action
regarding the entire matter.

the Washington National Airport to pick up his luggage.
While there, a Slight from Louisville came in and he saw
his long-time friend, P. M. Fry, with whom he shook hands.

- Accompanying Fry was Lieutenant James Bibb whom Duncan did
not recall for a minute, and former Police Officer Arlie
Blaire. Blaire came up to Duncan and at this time was
recognized as being a former Louisville Police Officer. At
this time SA DUNCAN realized BLAIRE was not the red-héaded
person he thought that hé had remembered at the First District
Office, Blaire volunteered to Duncan that he knew Duncan only
professionally and that he had been discharged for being an
alcoholic, that he had cured himself without going to Alco~
holics Anohymous and he was there at the request of the
Committee. He was asked by Duncan if he ever recalled working
on the Naslian Lane murder case. He did recall this. He was
asked what his partner, Aaron Duke, looked like and he gave
a description meeting the one Duncan had recalled. He also
advised that they rode in car 102 rather than car 101.

On November 30, 1977, Duncan brought the aforementioned
airport meeting to the attention of Mr. Michael Everhart and
Mr. Edward Evans of the Committee staff.

Duncan appeared before the House Sub-Committee on
November 30, 1977. ‘The Conmittee members present part or
full time were Mr. Louis Stokes; Mr. Walter E. Fauntroy;
Mr, Robert W. Edgar; Mr. Samuel L. Devine; Mrs. Yvonne
Brathwaite Burke; and possibly Harold E. Ford,

Mr. Michael Everhart of the Committee staff questioned
Duncan,

At this time Duncan asked Mr. Fauntroy if he would be
out of order if he asked when this incident was supposed to
have taken place and who was present. Mr. Fauntroy advised
that he would be out of order. .

Duncan was asked how long he had been in Louisville,
Kentucky, and if he knew P. M. Fry, Robert Gregory, James Bibb,

Duncan was asked if he ever pulled any jokes and the
answer was "on occasion*, and he gave one example. Ie was
asked in great detail about where the méeting or joke was
pulled and how he was to know who he was to tell the story
to. Duncan did not recall except that he thought there were
two officers from the district and undoubtedly one of thon
would have been Baird, otherwise Baird would not have told
the story. He was asked how the statement was made and if
there was anything else said. Buncan replied that there could
have been a question asked and he could have replied something
about Nr. Hoover and Dr. Xing's relationship.

He was asked about the racial climate in Louisville ani
yeplied that he thought it was fairly calm until after 1967.
He also pointed out that the Louisville City School Systen
was one of the fow in the United States that was integrated
without incident but that the County School System several
years later had difficulty. He was asked about Dr. Martin
Luther Ring and a. PD. Williams Hing again. He again gave the
raply except that he had chected the newspaper accounts md

in Louisville threé times between 1963 and 1965 and they were

he was at the Zion Baptist Church, his brother's church;
and again on December 16, 1965, at the Zion Baptist Church when

tively to all these questions.

Duncan was given a statement which allegedly was a trans-
exiption of a recording betwoen Arlie Blaire and Clifton Baird

U. S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, ;
INTERVIEW OF SPECIAL AGENT WILLIAM R. DUNCA

Dancan was asked if he thought that the incident was
an offer by the FBI to kill Dr. King. Duncan replied that
it definitely was not. However, it was in poor taste and
something that should not have occurred. He was asked his
definition of a joke and Duncan. gave his definition of a joke
as something made in fun. He was asked several times regard-
ing the anénymous m=yspaper clipping suddenly appearing in the
EBI mail, and was this not a crack-pot way of doing things.
He added that Congressmen frequently receive anonymous itens.
in the mail also.

tir. Stokes asked if SA DUNCAN knew that Dr. King had won
the Nobel Peace Prize and that he preached peaca wherever he
went. Duncan replied he did know, but did not know the date.
Mr. Stokes stated that he thought the Ameritan public should
hear and judge this matter. :

Duncan was asked where he was assigned and where he was
) physically the date that Dr. King was killed. He replied he

was assigned to the St. Louis. Division and at the Mexica,
Missouri, Resident Agency.

Mr, Everhart of the staff summed up the questioning by
‘asking if it was possible that P. M. Fry, Vernon Austin,
Robert Gregory, Brent Hardin, Herman Mitchell, Arlie Blaire,
and Robert Peters could have been present when the matter was
discussed regarding Dr. King. Duncan replied that it was pos—
sible, but he had no recollection of any of them, especially
Peters.

SA puncan acknowledged limited participation as described
in instant incident, but stated this was done on his owm ini~
tiative spontaneously and wanted it known the FBI as an organi-
zation had no involvement whatsoever. Further, that he would
cooperate fully in resolving this matter satisfactorily.

7 lic. Lehner requested Duncan not to contact any of the
4 police officers or discuss his testimony with any of them.

the United States and Mexico “at $1000 to

(2000 per trip." Said Jerry Ray: “James

assumed he was delivering dope or some
ther kind of contraband.”

“James is a crook,” said Jerry Ray.
“He's been one since he got out of the
Army, to make money without working.

“He thinks being a thief is an honorable
: profession, but he never wanted to be
‘known as a murderer.”

Now, says the brother of the man
s convicted of assassinating the Rev. Dr.
: King; James Earl Ray fears that if he is
transferred to federal custody after his
» short-lived escape from a Tennessee
|, state’ prison recently, “‘he will be sent to
the: federat medical facility. at Spring.
field (Mo.), given shock treatments, die-.
\.of'a heart attack in three years, and the
* case'will be closed.”
+” Here is the story Jerry Ray told the
Post-Dispatch of how James Earl Ray
* found himself in Memphis at the time the
“ Rev. Dr. King was killed:
~ “After he escaped’ from the Missouri
Penitentiary in 1967, he came to Chicago
"and called’ me,” said Jerry Ray. “He
‘later told me he didn’t escape in a bread
” truck as the story goes. He climbed over
~ the-wall on some pipes, like he did in
* Tennessee. :
“When they fourd he was missing,
they thought he was hiding inside the
prison as he had done on a previous
attempt, This gave him some valuable
time to walk along the railroad tracks
and get away. They put out the bread
truck story because James was working
in the bakery and they just figured that
‘was what happened. ;
~“{ met him in Chicago when he got |
theré. He never once mentioned King or .|
,- any’. other political. matters. James
doesn’t give a damn about politics. He
never cared who was governor or who
was running the country. If you're a
racist ‘in prison, where he was, you’re in
deep trouble. These stories that he
carried .around pictures of Hitler and
stuff, that’s a lot of bunk. He’s not
viglent. When he was arrested on an |
‘armed robbery charge in St. Louis in
= 1959, he had a gun but didn’t use it. Even |
the black prisoners in Tennessee think he
was framed.” :
-' When Ray arrived in Chicago, said his |
ther, “he took a job as a dishwasher
f a restaurant in Winnetka, Aftef a
@puple of days he was promoted to the
+ cifeteria line. He worked there ‘bix
ks until he got enough money. to pet

out of the country, because he was ‘hot.’

NW 68262 Docld:32989797 Page 223

y He went to Montreal and started
‘iging around some Sleazy bars and |

jt Be known that he was a thief and wal

looking for a way to make some money|

That's where he met Raoul

“He knew Raoul was a phony name

“but he was using one, too. He used last

names like Willard, Lohmyer, Eric Galt

‘ And‘finally Sneyd. If you're a crook, you

don’t ask, ‘What's your name’ or, ‘what's

» itt the car?" They'll think you're a cop or

stool pigeon and they wouldn't hire

you..
““After a while, James came back to

2 Chicago and I could tell hé had some- |

thing good. He asked me to come to
* Chicago by-train because he wanted to
\ give me his car.*He said I'should get new
license plates because the old ones were
~ ‘hot, He said he was going to take a bus
to “Alabama for ‘a good job.’ He said
“Raoul told him.to establish residence in
Bifmingham and gave him $2000 to buya
~ cat. He bought a Mustang.
+= Raoul operated out of New Orleans.
. From there he started sending James out
 cFoss the country and into Mexico to

‘y deliver cars. All over — Puerta Villarta, |

" Atapulco, the West Coast, New Orleans
He was getting paid $1000 or $2000 a trip.

° Hevfigured the cars might be full of dope
‘but he didn’t ask any questions. All he,
cared about was that he had a job and
was getting paid good. It was better than
being in Jeff City, he told me. James told

me-Raoul never talked politics, either.”

‘James Earl Ray has said that a gun he
purchased was probably the one used to
kill’ Dr. King. This is his brother's
explanation:

“James tells me that one day Raoul
asked him to buy a gun in Alabama and
bring it to Memphis. At this point James
thought Raoul might also be in the gun

inning business. He brought the gun to p!

TRaoul. He said it wasn’t the right kind.
. fo.james went back and bought another
ne. Raoul said that was the right kind,
” He’picked it up from James at the new

3, dropped out of sight. He is said to have

ebel Motel just across the Mississippi.
ne from Memphis.

| Then Raoul told James to move into'a

Yoarding house in Memphis. In this job
\ James was always doing what he was
| told. The money was good. James had

only been to Memphis once before in his

life. He kept getting lost there. He rented
the room in the name of Willard,

“Raoul, came to the boardinghouse and

| Sent James out on several other erranc

— to buy some binoculars’ and other
| things, The afternoon Dr. King was shot,

Raoul told James he wanted to use the

Mustang that night. |.

“There were three keys to-it. James
had one, Raoul had one, and he (James)
didn't know who had the third one.
Jamés told him he would have to go get
a tire fixed because he had had a flat
tire, . E i"

“He drove to a service station nearby
and they were busy. He talked to two

“attendants for awhile. When he was

driving away he saw all this commotion,
police cars everywhere, He heard on the
radio that Dr. King had been killed.
When he heard they were Jooking for a
white Mustang, he realized he had been .
set up.”” ae :

In the Mustang, James Ray discovered
a card stuffed into the seat, says Jerry

Ray. The front part was crossed out. The

back bor a name, Randy R-—, with a

telephone number on it.

' “Only James and my sister and myself
| have known this name up to-now,”” said
) Jerry Ray. “Plus the Assassinations
| Committee. James kept this card.”

It was discovered by attorneys for
James Earl Ray that Randy R-——
had homes in Miami and Gulfport, Miss.,
and that he was subsequently apprehend
ed in New. Orleans and convicted on a
} dope charge, says Jerry Ray. “But

whether he ever served any'time or not;

we can’t find out, and after that he

been an informant for the FBI,” Jerry
Ray said,

James Earl Ray drove to Atlanta,
abandoned the Mustang, and took a train
to Montreal. “He knew he was hot. The
only way to get out of the, country is /
through Canada. He didn't know how to |{)

MRS, CORETTA KING.

1 A’ special report from the
Department of Justice to the
media this week reads in
part: ©

The purpose of the study
was to examine FBI activities

“involving Dr. King and to
evaluate the effectiveness of
the -assassination investiga-
tion. ‘“The report concluded
that the FBI had conducted a
.Painstaking and successful
investigation of the 1968
assassination in Memphis,
“Tenn. The task force also
found no evidence of FBI
complicity in the murder,”
the statement to the ARGUS

_ said.

However, the report further
stated, “The FBI's
COINTELPRO - type harass-
-ment of, Dr. King and
efforts to drive him out of the
civil rights movement were
found to have been clearly
improper. The task force te-
commended no diseiplinary
action because the chief FBI

. activist

- Officials responsible for the

harassment are dead or re-
tired, but proposed outright
prohibition of COINTELPRO-
type activities against
domestic intelligence
subject.’”" 7

Dr.. King’s widow,
father, the Rev. Martin
Luther King Sr., other family
members and civil rights
leaders have called the latest
report from the house com-
mittee ‘‘unacceptable’’ to
them,

Shortly after this re-inves-
tigation into the King slaying
officially opened, it was re-
ported by the media that
numerous documents perti-
nent to the King slaying case
were missing from the
government’s file.

Last week human rights
Dick Gregory,
announced that he will
resume his hunger fast until a
“thorough and true’’
gation into Dr. King’s slaying
is initiated - which should
include the necessary FBI and
other legal government and:
official documents on the
King case.

In addition to this, the U.S.
District Judge John Lewis has
ordered the FBI to file with
the National Archives all of
its tapes and documents
growing out of buggings and

. wiretaps of Dr. King. Accord-

ing to the judge’s previous
records, these materials could
not be made available to the
public for at least 50 years,
except by court order.

A couple of months ago, Ed
Redditt, an ex-police
detective in Memyhis told the
National Inquirer Magazine in

his”

investi- |

82 interview that he and
another Black officer, W.E.
Richmond, were the only
detectives assigned to policé
detail on April 4, 1968. He
stated that when police
officials in Memphis learned
of the many threats against
Dr. King’s life they ‘‘slashed
security from 10 men to two
men, instead of beefing it up.

“When Dr. King was
murdered I was miles away -
and another officer on duty
with me that day (W.B.
Richmond) was missing from

. the scene,” Redditt said.

Redditt said despite his
protests that he had-a job to
do, he was ordered home and
Holloman (then the director
of the Memphis Police and
Fire Department) called in
iwo burly police officers to
escort him there and stami
guard over him.

Redditt further stated that
it appeared, ‘‘as if the guards
were trying.to keep me in the
house, rather than protect
me,” ail

Attorney General Bell said
at a recent news conference,

* although the report found no

evidence of FBI involvement
in the 1968 murder case of
Dr. King, the case was not
closed for the Justice bhai
ment.

He said a final decision wit
be made when the House
Select Committee completes
its investigation of the killings
of both Dr. King and Pre-

‘sident John F. Kennedy.

Of a possible meeting wittt
Ray, Bell stated: ‘“‘I’d eithez
go or send someone in whon!
T have. absolute confidence.’’

~ New Policies —
inestrain FBI,

Kelley Says = 5

WASHINGTON, Feb, 19 — Federal Bureau of Investi-
patién Director Clarence M. Kelly Jr. said Friday that
furrent policy and Department of Justice guidelines
wl prevent future FBI harassments such as those
hised‘against the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.

{ Kehtey expressed great satisfaction’ that a Justice
{Department task force found the FBI had made a cred-
A sitable and thorough. investigation of the King assassina-
ition-in 1968, .

tj “There ‘are portions of the report which described’

objectionable.actions on the'part of the FBI,” Kelley
oa i id, referring to the task force's criticism of the FBI’s *°

tempt to “neutralize” the, Rev. Dr. King's role as a

il rights leader.

A Justice. Department task force investigating the
ideath of the Rev. Dr. King says evidence that James
Earl Ray was a lone assassin is convincing, although

naenod

is motive remains elusive. .

In the report made public Friday, the task force
praised the FBI’s original investigation of the Rev. Dr.
King’s death in 1968, but said the Justice Department
failed to exercise proper supervision over the agency's
work, .

The report said also that former FBI Director J. |
‘Edgar Hoover inspired an improper and at times illegal
{harassment campaign against the Rev. Dr. King in the
jlast.five years of his life. But it recommended against
‘Iprosécutions in the campaign because Hoover and his
top aids are dead or retired.

| Ray was acting alone on April 4, 1968 when he
gunned King down on a motel balcony in Memphis, the
Teport concluded. It said that FBI agents checked out~
-}eonspiracy theories but found them groundless,

“The task force is satisfied that the FBI did a credi- :
ble and thorough job in attempting to identify any. possi- .}

1 {ble conspiracy. In all the years following the assassina-
tion, the investigation has failed to reveal any connec-:

7 ine tween any alleged conspirator and James Ear}

aye.

: Now Ray supported himself for a year before the Reva

i P King’s death, :

“Ray's apparent hatred for the civil rights moves!
‘ment, his possible yearning for recognition and a desire?
‘for a potential quick profit may have, as a whole, pro-
‘vided sufficient impetus for him to act and act alone,”
the report said.”

} Imprisoned in the Missouri State prison until his
‘escape in 1967, Ray took part in inmate speculation
tabout a bounty on the Rev. Dr. King’s head. But the
report found no evidence ‘proving that a bounty pay-
ment was actually offered.

Meanwhile, an attorney for Ray accused the Justice
Department of attempting to whitewash the investiga-
tion.of the killing. Robert I. Livingson of Memphis,
-{Tenn., also charged the Justice Department with trying
to thwart a planned investigation of the assassination
by alHouse committee. on 7

Eivingston said he knew of two persons willing to

the Committee was having inernal problems, Robert I,

“Since that investigation started, I felt they wovld

nection with the Dr. King murder. I knew they would

} “The only thing I'm surprised at is that they haven't

for living expenses.

The FBI speculated that Ray éommit-
ted several robberies or burglaries but
that was never proved. Ray was checked
as a possible participant in a 1567 bank
robbery at Alton, [ll., and in other
holdups around the country, but results

« Gwere always negative. -
IE DID EARN $664 as a dishwasher in
1a Chicago suburb, and at least once senit - i
4 money out of the Missouri prison by
money order to a fictitious company. But
nothing else could be established about
how Ray obtained several thousand
dollars, which he spent between his
escape and his arrest.

One expenditure was $269 on July 14,
1967, for purchase of 2 Plymouth automo-
bile in East St. Louis.

The FBI was criticized for allegedt
failure to follow a lead which the report:
described as ‘‘stiggesting that one ori
both of Ray’s brothers were in contact)
with him after, and in aid of, His escape
in 1967 from (prison).”

‘The lead was not unearthed until after
Ray’s artest, and-the.FBI downgraded

the information as, “made sterile by
intervening events,” the report said. The
tip was that Jerry’ Ray may have seen
his brother James ‘‘at-a pre-arranged
meeting place in St. Louis shortly after
his escape,” the reports said.

“By hindsight, the task force believes
Jerry and John Ray could haye been
effectively interrogated further to leam;
their knowledge, if any, of James Earlt
Ray's plans, his finances, and whether!
they helped him after King's death, the
report said. ‘ y
