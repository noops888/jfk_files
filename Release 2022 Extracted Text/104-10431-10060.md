From:

Chief, SR/CI

Report aal

Subject:

'Cable from Chief, SR Division, re Possible KGB role In Kennedy

Slaying

CASINOUGS

The following is the text of a cable from Chief,

SR Division, sent

via' closed channel from Frankfurt at 23162 on 23 November, for the attention

of Mr. Angleton:

"I.

I desire that you consider these reactions to the Kennedy

assassination:

8. Within minutes of the first news, Moscow radio statements

as heard in london attributed the assassination to "right-

wing elements." Only as the true identity of the believed

assassin became known did Moscow begin to complain that

U.S. reactionaries

3 were using Oswald as & pawn.

b. Should not the assignment of 13th Dept: officers to the KGB

residency In the United Nations In New York be considered

in a new light?

c.

I discovered from Arthur Martin (of MI-5))during our long

and exceptionally valuable discussions, that one of Harold

Wilson's principal scientific advisors is Captain Ian Maxwell,

who has a long Soviet Intelligence background. This may

shed new light on AFLADLE's report [I.e., that Harold Wilson

may be a Soviet agent.

2. Putting It baldly, was Oswald, unwittingly or wittingly, part of

a plot to murder President Kennedy In Dallas as an attempt to

further exacerbate sectional strife and render the U.S. Government

less capable of dealing with Soviet initiatives over the next

year? If AFLADLE's views on Wilson and the information noted in

paragraph Ic above have any substance (end they cannot be ignored),

this suggests that we can expect major Soviet pressures over the

next several months, for which the Soviets have made careful;

long-range preparations."

2. The above reference to 13th Dept. officers in New York refers to the

presence, reported by an FBI penetration of the KGB locally, In New York or

Washington of one or two known officers of the 13th Department of the lst Chief

Directorate (Foreign Intelligence) of the KGB.

This department is charged with

"Liquid affairs," sabotage and assassination.

One of the 13th Deptu Officers,

Pennsylvania university during the school year 1902-03, which suggests that

the Soviet student 1s also a 13th Dept. officer or agent. Perbaps

significantly, his course of studies was In food chemistry!
