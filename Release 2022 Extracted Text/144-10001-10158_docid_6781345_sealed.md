"With the purpose of documenting what has already been

indicated, I take the liberty of informing you below in detail, of

the charges which have been brought against Counselor JAIME CALDEVILLA,

proved in an authentic and irrefutable manner, and which compel

us to formally and expressly request his immediate departure from

military, economic and political nature, the fulfillment of tasks

of ideological diversionism and the recruitment of agents and

counterrevolutionaries for the Central Intelligence Agency, tasks

in which he has availed himself of the very close collaboration of

his secretary, Miss CARMEN_JTMENEZ GOMEZ((4)) .

"Since February 1959, Counselor CALDEVILLA has undertaken the

job of recruiting members of the then Rebel Army, among them the

traitor ALDO VERA((A)), MARIO MARRERO((A)), and AGUSTIN RARRADA((A)) .

The latter, once his activities were discovered, found it propitious

to flee the country to avoid prosecution.

"Along this same line, he also used the aforementioned Miss

CARMEN JIMENEZ GOMEZ, instructing her to infiltrate student

organizations for the purpose of creating diversionism in the

Ideological order, and she established, for this purpose, intimate

relations with Mr. PEDRO LUIS BOITELL (A)): ex-President of the

arrested and sentenced to imprisonment on the Isle of Pines,

Miss JIMENEZ GOMEZ went there and carried out military and political

espionage activities. The data and information that she obtained

on that occasion were transmitted to Counselor JAIME CALDEVILLA,

and included microfilms.

"In February 1960 Counselor CALDEVILLA conceived a plan for

an attempt against the life of the then First Deputy Chairman of

the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, Mr. ANASTAS MIKOYAN,,

a guest in Cuba, for which purpose he delivered arms to a group

of counterrevolutionarly elements. It was not executed, according

to what Counselor CALDEVILLA himself claims, because of

the

cowardice of the assassins. He also sought refuge and protection in

the home of his collaborator JOSE LUIS RODRIGUEZ ((A)), for MI. ISRAEL

FAMORA PEREZ ((A)), a fugitive from Cuban authorities

for plotting

an attempt against the life of the Vice Prime Minister and Minister

of the Cuban Revolutionary Armed Forces, Conmander RAUL CASTRO RUZ,

as well as a plan to create an incident at the United States Naval

Base at Guantanamo. Later, Counselor CALDEVILLA arranged for the

mentioned ISRAEL ZAMORA PEREZ to take asylum in the Colombian

Embassy in Havana.

"In May 1962 he instructed his agents

CARMEN

JIMENEZ GARCIA

and ALFREDO SERRA ECHEVARRIA((A)), an accountant at the Embassy,

well as other individuals, to infiltrate different organizations

and offices of the Cuban State. The former went to work in the

offices of the National College of Architects, where she established

contacts with numerous professionals to induce them to desert, as

well as to obtain data and intormation from the Congress of the

International Union of Architects, where she worked as a simultaneous

interpreter.

"The latter worked at the National Institute of Agrarian Reform

where, if a break in diplomatic relations between Spain and Cuba

occurred, he would be in charge of obtaining confidential information

correspondence with instructions, received by diplomatic pouch,

for the counterrevolutionary organization, the Revolutionary

Student Directorate with which he maintained close relations

through BLANCA MARTINEZ DEL HOYO((A)), JORGE MEDINA BRINGUIER (A)),

and LUIS FERNANDEZ ROCHA((A)). The first two were national coordinators

for civic resistance and strengthening of the Revolutionary Student

Directorate, and the latter, a CIA agent.

"It has also been proved that Counselor CALDEVILLA's wife,

at his suggestion, has maintained relations with relatives of

political prisoners and counterrevolutionaries, inciting them to

send letters of protest to foreign embassies and international

organizations.

"On the occasion of the arrest of counterrevolutionary GENARO

to recruit him and give him training in arms and explosives, even

within the Spanish Embassy, and instruct him in organizing an

espionage network for the illicit procurement of military, economic

and political information and in penetrating the Cuban-Spanish

Friendship Society, whose building he was to occupy in the event

the United States Government launched an armed aggression against

Cuba. He was to be given arms and equipment at the opportune

moment. In like manner FOLGUEIRAS was instructed by the former

to distribute arms and relay guidance to counterrevolutionary

groups in the event of this aggression. The espionage ring organized

by the aforementioned is made up of eight persons who receive for said

task the amount of 250.00 US dollars monthly and the promise of

a deposit of 500.00 Us dollars in an account in their names in a

Miami bank.

on one occasion, supplied him with a directive of the nickel industry

as well as a plan and a report with specifications on the type of

arms, location, and personnel of the military installations of Managua

and Matanzas which were delivered by LUIS ANTONIO COLLAZO DENNISN((A)),

who is a deserter from the Armed Forces.

"In April 1963, when the Achives was pentrated by CIA agent

RAMON GRAV-ALS IN((A)) who directed an espionage ring, a note was

found which confirmed that a certain message had been delivered to

Counselor CALDEVILLA. In June of the same year, photostatic copies

of the motions of the Student Congress on the Struggle of Peoples

Against Colonialism were delivered to him by CARMEN JIMENEZ GOMEZ.

"In February 1966, he gave refuge in his residency to counter-

revolutionary fugitive ALDO ABREURACALLAO((A)), a convicted saboteur.

"The Cuban authorities have also learned through the statements

of several arrested persons, that Counselor JAIME CALDEVILLA uses the

pouches and enciphered Embassy cables to receive and transmit

instructions, reports, requests for information, and correspondence

related to illicit activities and is personally

in charge of

deciphering messages in an office on the second floor of the chancery,

next to the office of his Secretary, and is also in charge of

reviewing and approving all of the material obtained in the country

by his numerous agents and contacts before sending it abroad.

by means of radio sets. They also recruited a telegraph operator

from the Ministry of Communications who was in charge of the

espionage work of that organization. At that time Counsellor

JAIME CALDEVILLA was personally concerned with verifying the reports

the Embassy, ADELA RODIL RODRIGUEZ((A)), and CARMEN JIMENEZ GOMEZ.

He give direct orders to the latter.

Both were exposed by leaders of counterrevolutionary organizations,

having offered, on one occasion, to supply to one group rifles

with telescopic sights.

The authorities have proof that one or

the other maintains relations with the well-known counterrevolutionary

leader MANUEL ARTIME, whom Mi. VERGARA visited in Miami sometime

before the mercenary invasion was crushed at Playa Giron, in

April 1961, with the knowledge of Counselor JAIME CALDEVILLA.

•"It has been known that Counselor JAIME CALDEVILLA has been

dedicated, furthermore, for some time, to the illegal removal from

the country through the diplomatic pouches of the Spanish Embassy

of jewels and foreign currency delivered to him by different persons,

on a basis of 20 percent of its value. In this way, the removal

from the country of the possessions of ALVARO GONZALEZ GORDON((A))
