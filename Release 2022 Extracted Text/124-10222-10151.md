On 15 June 1964 a member of the Venezuelan Branch of the Movi-
miento de Recuperacion Revolucionaria (MRR, 2M nt for Rev
lutionary ‘Recovery) claimed that the MRR has nd operational :
base in Venezuela and does not intend to establish one. The ic
MRR maintains,an office in the Dominican Republic and is i |
« believed to have facilities for using that territory as an a
occasional staging point for attacks against. Cuba. The MRR,
however, does ‘not have a permanent base or training camp in
the Dominican Republic. The Dominican Government: has little

interest in supporting Cuban exile activitiesat the present
time,

ly

2. No large-

ale exile operations against Cuba by the MRR will

take place until after the November 1964 elections in the —
United States. The MRR claims that this decision is based on
. the fact that at least six months of preparation will be re-
quired before internal conditions in Cuba will: be favorable
and that the'decision does not imply close connivance between
the MRR and, the, United States Administration.
