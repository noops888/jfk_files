. . Specific: Agent Communications

REFERENCE b WH/C Memorandums 965-86 and #65-87
(Not sent WH/2/Salvador)

1, The LN Department bes no means of direct radio &
communication with its own agents, If it wishes to send a message -
to an agent, it passes the message to the Hegal Department, and
that cffice sends the message for LN, either ‘to the LN agent
directly if he has radio facilities for receiving it, or to an Ulegal
{ Department ages? (with whom there is dtrect radio communication)

for passage to the LN agest, The LN Department, when in
> 1963, for example, it wished to send a message to YON Sosa,
passed the: message to the Dlegal Departme=t, which sect it to
an agent with radic communication in Guatemala to relay to him,

2, The Diegal Departmert has its own radio atation for
‘ communication with its agenis, The stativa 1s not in any of the
headquarters’ buildings; its actual location is net known, Even
when the Illegal Department and the LN Department were com-
bined in the MA Section and shared offices, the members af the
section handling illegal agents were very unwilling to talk about
} commuaications in any way,

i 3. In the Zapote Operation, agent communication brake
down because of several factors, As planned, the three agents

: in the op-ration were to use the same post office box as a cover

a address, but each agent was taught a aeparair s/w system, The

Chemical Laboratory (LQ) had a recurd of each system agair

the agent's pseudonym, as well as examples of his hardwriti:g, all

under the heading of the Zupote Operation, :

It was planned that Roque DALTON, “MONTENEGRO, "
wpal agent in the Zapote Operati: was to do the letter
writirg. the cther two agents were to pasa their information to
him, 2 first letter received at DGI (Cuban Intelligence Service)
headquarters was picked up at the accommedation address in
Mexico and forwarded to Havana, where through sume corfusion
it was misrouted to the Dlegal Department. From there it waa
estntually forwarded to LN, The Salvador Desk officer sent the
letter in tts envelope to LQ requesting processing and identifying
the letter as belunging to the Zapote case, from SARAVIA (the ~
second agent), and ashing notification as to whether the letter
contained secret writing. The LQ analysts, examining the letter,’
equated Zapete and "MONTENEGRO" (although SARAVIA was
also part of the Zapote Operation) but checked with the desk
officer and with him agreed (o develop the seeret writing with the
SARAVIA develcper, They believed that the letter contained
secret-writing because it was folded with the legal text ouwtde
and the Dlank side inside as if to protect a secret text. When
the letter was tested with the SARAVIA deyeleper, however, ac
secret writing appeared, The techniclans then tried ic with the
"MONTENEGRO" developer, but by this tine any secret wrilirss
the letter contained had been destroyed by the incorrect process
They identified the handwriting as that of SARAVIA, and the
text indicated that there was ans w enclosure, Mearwhile,
"MAURICIO" had reported from Mexicc that DALTON had been
arrested and deported {rom E] Salvador,

5. A second letter from SARAVIA was also received ard
tested with the SARAVIA develcper, Although there were in-
dications that it contained s/w, nothing could be recovered,
‘There was no s/w on the envelope, which had net been opened. A
third letter from SARAVIA, folded In the form to contain s/w,
was also developed and showed signs df s/w but so faint that tt
could not be read. The desk officer theaght that perhaps when
DALTON was arrested SARAVIA bad takes over his s/w aod aras
Using It instead of his own, The LQ analysts commented that
SARAVTA was using for commurucation with DG] headquarters a
system that he had been t for use only internal com-
murucations tn E} Salvador aed that he uid be toid to use the
proper system for beadquarters, eo desk cffiere, however,
had ce means of communtcatin: with tne agent since the sw
messages could not be read, A system of recogaiticr for

personal meetings with the agents in E] Salvador was included tn:
the operational program for Zapote, but that meant an-intermediary
or the case officer going to El Salvador for the contact. Since
DALTON was out of El Salvador and other medns of communtcarton
was lost, DALTON was ordered to. Mexico and the desk officer
arranged ‘a trip there to.get explanations of what had-happened and
reestablish nail communication, When the desk officer went to
Mexico for the meeting in March 1904, however, DALTON and

the other Salvadorans he wanted to see did not show up. The case
officer also wrote a stiff memorandum to PINEIRO complaining
about the quality of the s/w systems and training. His letter

was returned with an endorsement by PINEIRO saying that the
matter was being looked into and resulis could be expected. Up.

to April 1064, however, nothing concrete had been achieved, as

far as the desk officer knew; he heard nothing from LQ and was
unable to resolve the matter directly with the agent In Mexico
because the agent never appeared for the scheduled meeting,

6. All agent gommunications from the field to accom-
modation addresses in Mexico or elsewhere are picked up and
forwarded through the field station to headquarters without being
opened, In the Sonia Operation, for example, when the agent
wanted a meeting in Mexico, she sent a letter to her accom-
modation address there; the lette: was picked up and forwarded
to headquarters; when it had been developed at headquarters,
the desk officer informed the case officer tn Mexico of the time,
date, and place set by the agent for the meeting. In no case
does the field atation cpon and read aay agent correspondence.

1. In the Zapote Operation, all agent personal documents
were picked up during the training period acd were photographed for
the agent's file. When the agent left Cuba to return to his opera-
tional area, the personal documents such as the cedula de
identidad were returned to him,
