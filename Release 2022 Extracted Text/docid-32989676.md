APPENDIX

COMMUNIST INFILTRATION OF THE
FIRST UNITARIAN CHURCH OF LOS ANGELES

A source advised on May 8, 1968, that the premises
of the First Unitarian Church of Los Angeles, 2936 West Sth Street,
Los Angeles, ‘California, have been utilized for meetings by Communist
Party members and sympathizers over a period of years. Speakers
and lecturers at the church frequently espouse Communist causes or
follow the Communist Party line. Communist front group literature
is distributed at the church. The church is used by some Communist
Party members for "mass concentration" work.

This same infiltration extends to adjuncts of the
church such as the Unitarian Public Forum and the Fellowship for
Social Justice, formerly known as the Unitarian-Universalist
Fellowship for Social Justice.

STEPHEN H. FRITCHMAN has been minister of the church
Since 1948.

Reverend STEPHEN H. FRETCHMAN is described in the Fourth
Report, Un-American Activities Committee in California, 1948,
Page 115, as a very active "Communist fronter" and connected with |
numerous "Communist front organizations and activities".

Membership in the First Unitarian Church does not, of
itself, connote membership in or sympathy with the Communist Party.

APPENDIX
LOS ANGELES STUDENT NONVIOLENT
COORDINATING COMMITTEE

A source advised in July, 1968, that the Los Angeles
Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee (LA-SNCC) , headquartered
at 7406 South Western Avenue, Los Angeles, California, is not a
membership organization but a loose-knit agency composed of young
militant, black nationalists from South Los Angeles who have
eliminated all Gaucasians from their ranks and have initiated a
program against the draft, the war in Vietnam and discrimination
and have proposed a revolutionary program utilizing armed force,
political and economic action to obtain their goals. LA-SNCC is
an arm of the National Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee
organization headquartered at Atlanta, Georgia, and with the naming
of LA-SNCC Director RONALD LEROY WILKINS as Deputy Director of SNCC
for the West Coast, the affinity between the National and Local
organization will be more harmonious.

The above source advised that at a meeting of LA-SRCC
leaders on March 22, 1968, the group indicated it was necessar
for all SNCG personnel to be armed in order to shoot "pig cops"
when they are stopped in South Los Angeles. cel Soot
: A source, in May, 1968, indicated thet LA-~SNCC leadership
has encouraged 211 associates of LA-SNCCG to obtain arms and to be
armed at all times. :

On April 5, 1968, four LA~SNCC officers were arrested
by the Los Angeles Police Department at LA-~SNCC headquarters in
possession of two fully loaded .30 caliber M-l carbines and one
.12 gauge shotgun, pump action, with four rounds of 00 gauge
buckshot. On May 4, 1968, five LA-SNCG officers were arrested
by the Los Angeles Police Department for possession of loaded
firearms.

On May 14, 1968, then Director JOHN FLOYD and three
Security Officers, LA~SNCC, were ssted by the New Orleans Police
Department for possession of stolen property. New Orleans Police
Department found four automatic weapons in attache cases carried
by the above persons. They also obtained material concerning
instructions in the making of Molotov cocktails, bombs and booby
traps for sabotage in guerilla-type warfare. This literature was
published in Communist Chir

she had received a threatening letter. He said that he had
been advised by former Attorney General RAMSEY CLARK to contact
the FBI. JAFFE further stated that he would like to bring
the letter to the Los Angeles Office of the FBI on 10/17/72,
between 2:00 and 3:00 p.m., and relate the facts to an agent.
JAFFE did not appear at the Los Angeles Office as he stated;
therefore, he was telephonically contacted at his residence
7 by SA JOSEPH C, ALSTON at approximately 5:00 p.m., 10/17/72.

During this conversation he stated, "I just couldn't make it
today, but I'll be in tomorrow". :

.An information copy is being furnished to the

Sacramento Office as investigation is currently pending in
that division.

on 10/25/72, (sia szlab) advised SA ROGER J.
LA JEUNESSE, JR., as follows: :

He has learned that one STEVE JAFFE, a-individual
who is associated and/or affiliated with JANE FONDA, was
recently contacted by Special Agents of the,FBI. The contact
by the Agents was initiated by JAFFE in behalf of FONDA who
had reportedly -received, through the ma%l, threats against her
life. According “to this source, SANE’ FONDA and others closely
. associated with her seriously considered the matter prior to
calling the FBI. Becatsse of the. apparent threat contained in
the letter, they felt it™necesdary to report the matter to the
Bureau and subsequently aiddgo. In addition, JAFFE furnished
to interviewing agents what héxrepresented to them to be FONDA'
itinerary up through 11/5/72. This source has: learned,
however, that the itinerary furnished to the Agents by JAFFE
is not, in fact, a eOmplete and facttal report of her planned
travels. This sovfce has further learned that JAFFE is in the
process of attempting to employ a privatéSinvestigator to

furnish appropriate "body guard" coverage fox JANE FONDA in
‘her upcoming’ travels.

both of whom are entertainers. He was formerly an investigator
for JAMES GARRISON, the New Orleans, Louisiana District
Attorney, His father is reported a doctor and JAFFE is
approximately 26.or e7 years of age.

Apparently SAEFE, in attempting to obtain the
services of a private investigator, learned that the cost
for such services would be prohibitive. In view of the
foregoing, he has decided to utilize ROBERT DUGGAN "and his
peopie™ to perform bodyguard services-for FONDA in her
‘travels. ss

JAFFE “desires to obtain the services of a reputable
private investigator to conduct an independent investigation
to determine if the FBI "is doing their job".

It appears that the A.L.L. could be classified
as a forerunner of our present day 'tradical-right'!
groups. They swore to 'protect the Constitution!
and wrote letters to then President Roosevelt.
They claimed 2,000 members. The Los Angeles head-
I; : quarters in 1939 was located at 510 South Spring
Street, Los Angeles. National Headquarters was.
listed as the National Press Building, Washington,
>» D.C. The Los Angeles leader was L.E. RANCK;
other officers were J. CLARITY and STEDMAN G. SMITH.
They recéived publicity in a newspaper published
in 1939 to the effect that they were starting a
group in San Francisco to go Tall out to save the
Constitution for everyone",

On October 19, 1972, the original letters and
envelopes signed "ART JASKY", "CLARENCE TP, STAUFIER" and
"Mrs, ANN SMITH", were forwarded to FBI Headquarters,
Washington, D.C., requesting a handwriting and latent

assailing authorivy inwhatever form it appeared -- this inspite of
my ‘aloofness” or 'reserve' or whatever you choose t& call it.
AS when, for no apparent political reason, I decided to attend a forizel
dance in my jeans (my uniform during that t jeans and Army-Navy
store turtlenecks), There were also the wild parties the foreign
students would have, waking up the entire campus after curfew with
loud Greek dances curving all over the partictilar area where the thins
was taking place.~ I remember-one-ineldentd CTS WAS = PABlS GUAGE

ly departed, There was another, more
serious incident, kK I may have mentioned mo to you last
year +~ The same g, Ss one weekend with not par-
“ticular place to go and a] to take us there, no money, no
nothing. We decid e off the caipus that we'd headxnnkax North,
perhaps to Glouce 7 ly becéuse the ne vocky
beaches and fisher: nen? 8 arves were aesthetically pleasing. (ie
had signed out for New York because you could only leave campus over-
“night if you gave én addressa end tel#2 where you could be reached, )
“By the time we had hitched to Gloucester, we were of course hungry,
put had no more than ten or vty cents, so we scanned the area for
@ EullibiS restaurant owner who would give us a free meal, When

we offered in this tiny scaside restaurant to wash dishes in ex-
change for a solid meal, the old man was so moved that he ordered his
waitress to bring us anything we wanted and conveniently forgot the
dssvashing part. We ate, walked around, absorbed the sights, but

then decided that mankax it would proba aby be disastrous for us to
sleep on the rocks as we'd planned ~~ it was Hovembefish and close

to freezing outside. So we spengt our pennies for coffee while we
tried to define the alternatives open for the night ahead, The deci-~
sion was to return to Brandeis, to ke a longer story shorter, but
after we'd hitched the hundred miles or so, it was after curfew and
we couldn't be caught galavanting about the campus, “A friend in the
men's d tory right off the highway was kind enovght, after
aroused him, to spend the night in another room and give us his 7 t
two beds for the next few hours, Things worked out perfectly, until
sometie Tater in the week a snitk4 told the woman's dean that we had
“not gone to N.¥. and had, in fact, violated one of the most sacred ,
rules of the university by spending the night surrounded by men, Folia,
a prolonged affair, threats to expell us, our trying to convince the
dean that we had not in fact slept in the men's dorm, but had gone

there Ane early thet morning, after having slept with the rocks in
Gloucester. The most humiliaténg part about it all was the trial -~ be-

George, Go you think I x might be’on the verge of something like
anity? I am still not f£1% for anything. Today

during a conference with Ho ad and the attorney who has prepared

the appeal on the bail motion I had to gather up all my energies

and powers of concentrations simply in order to keep my attention
focuesed on the subject of the discussion, All these continua}
wanderings towards you are irrepressible, But let me relate a rather
amusing anecdote. My mother unexpectedly appeared today and of
eourse one of her first comments had to do with the markings on my
face an neck, Now I'm sure you've begun to detect this strange un-
reality that pervades between us whenever matters pertaining to

CO ae err ene

when I have to diseuss such things with her. And she is always

‘so naive that I find her virt ly impossivle to commmicated witi.
Her question today: Wheat is that on your fase as she leaned over

to touch.it. I looked at Howard helplessly, I guess,“as I felt

my Whole face turning red. Don't lay at me, Anyway, I mumbled
something under my breath about having hurt myself and. then started

to laugh, Howard, of course, called me a liar, So I said: jou know, &
mother, k George and I were together for eight hours the other day,

with' a cigarsette? By then, I felt like going through the floor.
Howard saved the day by explaining to her that you have extraordi- 7
narily hot lips and that if she looked more closely shay could
actually make out your lip prints in three places, She's in’ another
vorld, But’ she's bean really beautiful around this whole affair --
yesterday, some kind of a bomb (a little one) exploded a few yards
away from her during an L.A. rally and there was a bomb threat durin;

the area where the house in Bihaa is located was called Dynamite
Hill./ When I suggested that thing about our having a more public
marriage ceremony, it was conceived only for its publicity value.
The first vow was absolute, it fused us for life and if we did have
a ceremony, we would not be more married than we are nov At would
only be an affirmation of what already exists for the benefit of j
others. And then, too, I've always disagreed with those among the
lawyers who, for the purposes of the case, do not want to concede
‘that the relationship exists, because they feel thatthat mignt be

APPENDIX

COMMUNIST INFILTRATION OF THE
FIRST UNITARIAN CHURCH OF LOS ANGELES

A source advised on May 8, 1968, that the premises
of the First Unitarian Church of Los Angeles, 2936 West &th Street,
Los Angeles, California, have been utilized for meetings by Communist
Party members and sympathizers over a period of years. Speakers
and lecturers at the church frequently espouse Communist causes or
follow the Communist Party line. Communist front group literature
is distributed at the church. The church is used by some Communist
Party members for "mass concentration" work.

This same infiltration extends to adjuncts of the
church such as the Unitarian Public Forum and the Fellowship for
Social Justice, formerly known as the Unitarian~Universalist
Fellowship for Social Justice.

7 STEPHEN H, FRITCHMAN has been minister of the church
since 1948.

Reverend STEPHEN H. FRITCHMAN is described in the Fourth
Report, Un-American Activities Committee in California, 1948,
Page 115, as a very active "Communist fronter" and connected with
numerous "Communist front organizations and activities".

Membership in the First Unitarian Church does not, of
itself, connote membership in or sympathy with the Communist Party.

APPENDIX .

LOS ANGELES STUDENT NON-VIOLENT
COORDINATING COMMITTEE

A source advised in July, 1968, that the Los Angeles
Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee (LA-SNCC), headquartered
at 7406 South Western Avenue, Los Angeles, California, is not a
membership organization but a loose-knit agency composed of young
militant, black nationalists from South Los Angeles who have
eliminated all Caucasians from their ranks and have initiated a
program against the draft, the war in Vietnam and discrimination
and have proposed a revolutionary program utilizing armed force,
political and economic action to obtain their goals. LA-SNCC is
an arm of the National Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee
organization headquartered at Atlanta, Georgia, and with the naming
of LA-SNCC Director RONALD LEROY WILKINS as Deputy Director of SNCC
for the West Goast, the affinity between the National and Local
organization will be more harmonious.

han
The above source advised that at e meeting of LA-SRCC
leaders on March 22, 1968, the group indicated it was necessar,
for all SNCC personnel to be armed in order to shoot "pig cops"
when they are stopped in South Los Angeles... Reel pene

: A source, in May, 1968, indicated thet LA-SNCC leadership
has encouraged 21] associates of LA-SNCC to obtain arms and to be
armed at all times.

On April 5, 1968, four LA~SNCC officers were arrested
by the Los Angeles Police Department at LA-~SNCC headquarters in
possession of two fully loaded .30 caliber M-l carbines and one
12 gauge shotgun, pumo action, with four rounds of 00 gauge
buckshot. On May 4, 1968, five IA-SNCCG officers were arrested
by the Los Angeles Police Department for possession cf loaded
firearms.

On May 14, 1968, then Director JOHN FLOYD and three
Security Officers, LA~SNCC, were arrested by the New Orleans Police
Department for possession of stolen property. New Orleans Police
Department found four automatic weapons in attache cases carried
by the above persons. They also obtained material concerning
instructions in the making of Molotov cocktails, bombs and booby
traps for sabotage in guerilla-type warfare. This literature was
published in Communist China.

INSTITUTE FOR POLICY STUDIES
1520 NEW HAMPSHIRE AVENUE, NORTH WEST
WASHINGTON, D. C.

On August 21, 1970 a source who is in a position to
furnish reliable information advised the Federal Bureau of
Investigation (FBI) as follows:

"Gentlemen:

‘Phe attached letter was received in the mail
today. Perhaps the times we live in have made

me super-conscious of our nation's security, but
the letter sounds a little shady to me. For
example, wouldn't this be a perfect way for a
foreign power (or even radical Americans) to deter-
mine.what it takes to destroy American industry?

“ For all I know, the Institute for Policy
Studies could be a communist front for an
espionage operation.

"At any rate, we're NOT going to provide Mr.
Raskin with the rather vital information he
asks for... and you may put his letter in your
files in case you decide he also sounds
suspicious to you."

The letter to which the first source is referring was
typed with an IPS letterhead, dated August 17, 1970, and signed

Marcus G. Raskin, Co-director. The letter was addressed to Granite
City Steel, Public Relations Department, Granite City, Illinois.
It stated as follows:

“ Dear Sirs:

“I am doing a study of the problems
of industrial security. As a starting
point, I would appreciate any written
materials which you might have con-
cerning this question including a
biographical resume of the person or
persons in charge of your security
program. Thank you very much."

On August 28, 1970 a second source who is in a
position to furnish reliable information advised that the Corning
Glass Works, Corning, New York received a letter from Marcus G.
Raskin, which is identical to the one described above.

On 9/22/70 another investigative agency provided the
FBI with information that the Hewlett~Packard Company, Palo
Alto, California also received a copy of the pete described
letter from Hone G, Raskin of the IPS.

eS

The IPS has been characterized in an article in, 7
the Washington, D. C. weekly newspaper,
"The Examiner" dated September 24, 1967 page” 22 \
by Edith Kermit Roosevelt. She stated An part

“~~ that the IPS is a Washington based “pn iink Factory”
which helped train extremists who tneite violence \

"Ramparts" is a monthly magazine with

California. The September 10, 1967, /

ssue of the "Denver Post" contained /

aharticle on "Ramparts" which states
in‘part that it is “radical in style

described as a co-défendent with Dr. Benjamin Spock on charges
-of conspiracy to atuke others to avoid the ‘draft.

More recently Raskin was credited in a Washington Post
newspaper article entitled "Military Influence Deplored,: as urging
at a conference on Militawy Budget and National Priorities, the
dismantling ‘of the Central\Intelligence Agency, the Defense Depart-
ment, and the National Secukity Agency within the next decade as
the only sure way of reversihg the "national security" state.

In April, 1970 a third source who has provided reliable
information in the past advised\ that Marcus Raskin was one of the
speakers at a convention of Federal Employees for Peace, Equality,
and Priorities held in Washingtom, D. C. Raskin stated in part
that such Government agencies. as the FBI, Secret Service
intelligence services of other Government agencies, and the military
should be done away with, in that ofder. He labeled these
agencies as’ un-American. He stated that the capitalistic system
in the United States is causing imperialism and aggression in
other parts of the world and that Federal employees should
organize to encourage the Government to ‘ghange these policies and
to do away with-the above mentioned agencies.

WASHINGTON, D. c.

several years, is now engaged in two programs aimed at American
security. Program 1 is a decument IPS is now circulating to
radical groups around the country, "A Proposal for the Formation
of Liberation Collectives and Brigades and for the Disruption/
Liberation of Washington." It is a call for all-out sabotage

of government, beginning at the Potomac. There are five basic
demands: .

N
1. immédiate withdrawal of United States
forces from Southeast Asia
\

2. $5,500 ‘5 year guaranteed income for every
. family of\ four

3. "Liberation! of all "political prisoners"
(i.e., Black. Panthers, draft resisters,
military desexters, etc.)

%
4. “independence” for the people of
Washington, D.C.

5. immediate end by colleges, corporations,
churches, etc., of complicity" with the
United States "war maghine" and the police.

IPS urges brigades, if the } can be recruited, to
descend on Washington (no date has been set, but late October
or November are beingmentioned) and “(1)\hold "teach-ins" for
federal employees, (2) meet with staffs ‘ef "genocidal agencies”
(described as the Army, CIA, HEW, etc.) aya force closure of
those agencies if necessary, (3) public hearings, televised on
the Capitol lawn, with members of Congress being forced to ex-
plain their support of %enocide," with possible sit-ins in the
Capitol, (4+) blocking highways and bridges td, the Pentagon and
CIA buildings in Virginia, (5) stopping armed ‘forces conscrip-
tion and enlistment, (6) opening of government hospitals and
cafeterias "to all people" and turning military\reservations
over to "people who need housing." New Leftist Jeader Rennie
petibee | leaker publicized by the media for his successful
campaign to sabotage a March for Victory in Washington, is
chief organizer of the program, assisted by IPS co4founder
Arthur Waskow, one of the authors of The Liberal Papers a few
years back (which called for dismantling United States offensive

and defensive forces). askow and Davis have established
liaison with groups around the country.

A man vho once had a place of honor_in the office
of President Kennedy's ational Security Council, Marcus
Raskin, heads up TPS's Promram 2 which at the moment is collecting
information about the mén who handle security for the nation's
industrial plants. Raskin, another Liberal Papers author, was
once on Ramparts board of directors, and was an out-spoken critic
of the CIA and the National Security Agency and other intelligence
organizations. In mid-August Raskin sent a letter to the public
relations departuents\or 500 American companies, informing the
PRmen: "I am doing a\study of the problems of industrial
security. As a starting point I would appreciate any written
materials which you m and have concerning this ques tion including
a biographical resume of the person or persons in charge of
your security program. fhank you very much." PR men habitually
respond to such inquiries without asking questions themselves.
Contacted by "Combat" Raskin ‘yaid he was doing the research for
a book which would show "the class background and educational
background of the men who head various programs, who are part
of the business elite." He said\one of his inrests was to find
out what happenec to ex-military officers and ex-FBI agents.
Most American firms will not concekl the background of their
security managers, but when a man who in the past has attacked
national security programs (e.g., nublear testing, Skybolt
missiles, etc.) tries to compile a filing cabinet of dossiers
on the men who guard the country's indystrial plants, security
agents are suspicious. Not suspicious ‘enough though. Raskin
told "Combat" that he has received more ‘than 200 replies."

Combat" is a nevslettex published by National
Review, Inés, and is described as a Newsletter that "keeps ——
you informed about the revolutionary struggle in America today."

A second source, who has pyar reliable informa-
tion in the past, advised on December 9, 1970 eee it had come
to his attention that such an inquiry had been xeceived by the
Corporate Information Section of the Corporate Relations Divi-
sion, Eastman Kodak Company, Rochester, New York,\a number of
months ago. A brief reply was directed to the sender informing
him that such information as that requested was not\available.

The source advised thut no record was maintained of the inquiry
and reply by the Eastman Kodek Company, and recollection of the
incident was disclosed by an official in charge of a depart-
ment.

A third source, who has furnished reliable information
| in the past, advised on December 9, 1970 that the Industrial
Nnagement Council of Rochester, which maintains contact with
Industrial Management personnel from Rochester firms, was

aware of contact made by IPS with the Xerox Corporation and the
matter was brought up at one of the Industrial Management
meetings, primarily to alert responsible persons to the possi~
bility to receiving such an inquiry from Raskin. No additional
information has come to the sources' attention of any additional
contacts with local industry.

Re the IPS:

\
The IPS has been characterized in an article in
the Washington, D.C, weekly, newspaper, "The
Examiner" dated September 24, 1967, page 22, by
EDITH KERMITROOSEVELT. She stated in part that
the IPS is a Washington based “Think Factory" ee
which helped train extremists who incite violence
in U.S. cities, and whose educational research
serves as a cover for intrigue andpolitical agi- ia a
tation. Through its conference and seminars,

the IPS exerts a continuing influence cn the
ideology and tactics of the New Left.

Re MARCUS GOODMAN RASKIN:

RASKIN has been publicly described as Co-director and
Trustee of the IPS; AB University of Chicago; JP University of
Chicago Law School: Trustee of Antioch College, associate
editor of “Ramparts Magazine," and author of many articles on
public policy. ir

"Ramparts" is a monthly magazine with editorial
offices in San Francisco, California. The
September 10, 1967 issue of the "Denver Post"
contained an article on "Ra: amparts" which states
in part that it is “radical in style and poli-
tics." It belongs to the left, if not the New
Left...

7 Dear Mr, Steadman:

As i explained to you when you were! kind enougit
- to grant me an interview with yourself? and Mr. Howard :
c. Anderson, Vica President and General Counsel of C & Pp,
., ‘the Federation of American Scientists ooking into tne
. question 7_privacy-.of con i
.. forming our_members. 1 have Teft you with three Fequests.
7 a ace wanted to know the number of persons who had asked C&P :
. to check their Vine: s with.a view to possible eve: sdropping.. gaa
I wanted to speak to the management of the security depars oo
ment that conducts such checks. And I wanted the pri vilege
of interviewing some of the men who deal directly with :
customers in installing and checking" phones.. I appre~" 7
ciate your wiliingness to consider these requests and eaeteee
“I ook forward to your Fesponse. : . cate

“As I mentioned to you ove 7 the telephone, Tan
; stil] confused about certain questions and wonder if,
. for the sake of precision, I might write you about then.
_ The fact of the matter is’ that I have received. conflicting .
reports on some of these questions. :

“1, As far as is known to C&P, representatives
* of other Government agencies do not a) own trucks ta

| t= that are dasigned to give the impression that they
-are telephone company trucks ; b) send their personnel ab
homes along with C & P personnel (whether wi th Govermmen
warrants or otherwise) in such a way as to create the |

JTlusion chat both are repair men c) otherwise represent
themselves directly or indirectly, | as telephone company

Gade a this correct? .

8
ct

ROS on
gp Ae tort.



Z. As far as is known to C & P, has any telephone company
‘employee éver been disciplined ‘or fir red for electronic evesdropping -
whether authorized or unautharized. How common is this? a

3. You have advised me that the telephone company does not “place
the taps" that may be authorized by court order. Does t, however, :
a) lease lines for that purpose b) supervise the placing of the cess
c) otherwise Cooperate in the placing o7 the-tap. In the case of court~
‘ordered evescropping that may use the telephone lines, coes the tele 7
phone company cooperate with law-envorcement icials whose warrant
is to evesdrop electronically cn conversations not taking place over the
phone, but who wish to use the telephone on the premises (or its
Vines} for evesdropping purposes. Does it, for example, supervise the
piacement of Suitable devices on telephones: .

&. You have advised me that, apart from national security evess
dropping, the telephone company advises persons on whose lines eves~
cropping devices are found that such devices have been found, even if the
devices were placed by court order. You said that this is done after . ‘>

x the Department of justice is notified. May I see a blank copy o7 4 7
-form advising a private party that evesdropping had been going on on his ©
line? Hov-many persons were advised that such devices nad been found

. * sover the last few years? How many devices have been found? How many

_ > persons issued requests for iiehennion of their lines? Ara Desi of
. , these statistics made to the F.C : :

5. Does the telephone company have written procedures for .
verifying and handling requests of the Federal Government for coopera~
vion in national security evesdropping cases? Is it satisfied that
ali requests made to it, in this regard, by the Justice Department,”
military intelligence agencies and/or the CIA were personally author ized
by the At ‘corney General acting for the President?

6. Has the telephone conpany-found evidence of wiretapping by
Soviet or Eastern European agents?

Has the telephone company ever uncovered a bugging device 3 ae
ce, or at the home, of a Congressman or Senator? I do not wish .
to Know particulars of a private nature, of course. :

Let me thank you in advance for helping me with these questions.
As you know, a sizable nuaber of persons seriously question the security
of their telephone lines. A complete and Tull answer to these Questions:
would, I am sure, allay eed oF tha anxieties ay members feel.

Re: Interview with Dr. Jer ‘emy J. Stone

43.01 ° > In response to Dr. Stone's letter to Mr, Bolger, a copy of TS
which is attached, I called Dx. Stone on January 7, and arranged to
meet with him on January 8 at 2:30 p.ra. in my office. Howard C.
Anderson was present during most of the meeting.

In eatin to our iene Dr. - Stone de desert

. ‘to to himself, Dr. Stone stated that he held a doctorate in 1 mathematics,
sueeae ‘although he was not actively pursuing that discipline-at this time. He

indicated that he had recently written on political subjects, and that

Dx Stone stated that he was interested, Jn our procedures fox

courity did™ Stiéx authorized wiretapping. He was told

had Specié © pr ocedures for handling court-ordered wiretapping

+ which we would outline for him, but that we would not discuss national
security wiretapping and that this aspect of the aubject should propexly be
‘discussed with the Federal agencies javolved. 7 wt

national security wiretapping; he stated ‘that one of his concerns is that

cee Company and the r «Bill was a distinct possibility and would impose a
Srearnezaxd fo the Tegi imate privacy of individuals, He expresseda 4

“strong fceling that this area was a legitimate concetn for organizations ~~

such as his, and that a réfusal to discuss the subject was unwarxanted,

We repeated that we would not discuss national security wire-
tapping, and that anything that was said did not apply to this area, With -
respect to court-ordered wiretapping, we stated that our practice was

. | that an employee’ of the Company would inspéct the court or der to |”
cetermine that it was valid on its face before any cooperation was given,
Dz. Stone asked to see the form on which a xécord of such inspection
: "was made. .He stated that the procedure for inspection would undoubteay
. vequire a form and he appeared skeptical of our statements with respect
to our seo nay He continued to tals of the action.of the-¥+Byl.,and_

> XOX.

. his ourrent activity was diz ected foward political and social problems. nea

spueenauaes Dr. Stone expressed dissatisfaction: with oux., refusal to discuss -"

oo indicated that he was referring: to testimony before the Long Committee,

7 2 7 t i s
appdaxedto be ing @:. the distinction between ‘aun security and
ful i _ Petions We again pointed ou\/hat we were discussing
only procedures in court-drdered interceptions, and further told him

that th

ce assistance provided in such cases was ordinarily limitcd to Paczeneee
cable and P x information, and that additional assistance was only i
spre’ ided under unusual circumstances. We stated that, to-our i
‘now icdwe, additional assistance in no case had included the actual |
connection of th ue tap by employees of our Cornpany.

Dr. Stone inquired about our handling of requests for line | :
checks by subscribers who suspect a tap. We told hira that a check eet
would be made, and that the customer would be advised whether ox not
evidence of tampering was found. Taps would be reported to law i
enforcement agencies to determine if they were court-ordered and to
afford opportunity fox investigation if unlawful, but that the customer
would be advised in any event. 7

Dr. Stone asserted that our statements were inconsistent with
testimony by Bell System witnesses at Congressional Hearings. He
and we pointed out that the policy we were discussing was fozmulated
to implement the provisions of the Omnibus Crime Control Bill of 1948
and that the practices were not necessarily applicable prior to that time.
Dr. Stone requested the number of such inquiries from subscribers, and
the results of our investigations. We indicated that we would see what
_infommation was available. He asked if reports of such’activities were
“made to the F,C.C., and we said that we did not know whether any such
‘reports were required, but that if required, .they were undoubtedly made.”
Dr, Stone remarked that there was some conflict in testimony he had- :
xéad concerning whether ox not such xeports weré ina

Discussing the handling of customer complaints, “we pointed out a7
that a‘report to the suspect was required by the law within a short period:
following termination of the interception;-Dr. Stone later indicated that,
he was not aware of this provision, eee ia
i Dr. Stone asked how we would feel about impersonation of

Company employees by law enforcement officials engaged in interceptions. H
He was told that we would not like such a practice. Dr, Stone asserted
that such action was wide spread and shouldn't something be done by the ™
Company about it. We replied that we had no knowledge of such imper-
sonations, and since our employees wére not in uniform it was difficult

to distinguish between a Company employce and other craftsmen wearing
tool belts. Dx. Stone again assexted that the practice was wide spread;
that our craftsmen knew all about it; and that the Company should an
investigate the matters. 0 fae EEE tui

Company, and that practices might or might not vary to some extent
othex companics; this was a national problem as to which there had been
discussions among the System companies, but the practices adopted by
7 ‘this Company reflected its view of proper pr occduves in the light of its
particular situation.

Dr. Stone questioned whether the design of our plant facilitared

_whexe private lines had been wired with the connivance of er aiteren to
 pexmit dialing in on "thousands of lines."' I indicated that i had z coal banda

Jeremy J. Stone

On April 22, 1966, a confidential source, who has
furnished reliable information in the past, advised that
Jeremy J. Stone, of Harvard University, advised Dr. i. N.
Kutakov, Senior Advisor of the Soviet Mission to the United
Nations, 136 East 67th Street, New York City, that he was
sending several copies of his book for forwarding to
interested persons in the Soviet Union. Stone indicated
to Kutakov that he had already mailed copies of his bool:
to several persons in the Soviet Union who are interested
in disarmament.

The source advised that Stone intended to attend
the International Congress of Mathematics in Moscow, Uixlon
of Soviet Socialist Republics, and would be in Moscow with
his wife, a student of the Russian language, as well as a
Dector of Mathematics, from August 14 to August 30, 1966.
Stone indicated to Kutakov that if it were possible to
discuss questions of disarmament with persons to whom his
book had been sent, he and his wife could stay until, Ceptember
‘5, 1966. Stone further indicated, according to the source,
that his comments would reflect only his personal opinions,
but this in no way would make him less eager to exchange
views on the question of disarmament.

will be in Moscow from August 14 to August 30 at least; if,
in fact, it seems likely to be possible to discuss questions
of disarmament: and if your goverment permits uc a longer
visa we may stay until September 5. As you know, I am a
non-governmental student of these matters. My comments would
reflect only my personal opinions but I am no less eager to
exchange views for that. Therefore, if it ls possible, and
convenient, for you to signify my interest in discussions
tothose persons to whom these books are sent I should be
especially indebted.

"Thank you again for your assistance and, especially
for reading my book; this is what authors most require.

‘With best regards,
"Sincerely
“Jeremy J. Stone"

The NYO has summarized the above letter in the LHM
in an effort to further conceal the confidential source.

Boston is requested to ascertain if the writer of
_ this communication is identical to the son of the long-time
CP member, ISIDOR FEINSTEIN STONE. If identical, Eoston
should handle in accordance with instructions contained in
Section 105K of the Manual of Instructions.

Boston should also be alerted to the fact that the
Soviet Intelligence Service is especially interested in
cultivating and using persons of STONE's caliber. It is
extremely possible that if STONE is the son of the long-
time CP member, the KGB may be aware of this and could
possibly utilize some ‘way to approach STONE while he is in
Moscow.
