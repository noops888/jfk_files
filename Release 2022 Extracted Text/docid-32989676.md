Now I'm sure you've begun to detect this strange un

to touch. 1ü.

I lookeû at Howard helplessly, I guess, as I folt

about having hurt myself and. then started

to laugh. Howard, of course, called me a liar.

COMMUNIST INFILTRATION OF THE

FIRST UNITARIAN CHURCH OF LOS ANGELES

Party members and sympathizers over a period of years:

and lecturers at the church frequently espouse Communist causes or

follow the Communist Party line. Communist front group literature

is distributed at the church.

The church is used by some Communist

Party members for "mass concentration" work.

This same infiltration extends to adjuncts of the

church such as the Unitarian Public Forum and the Fellowship for

Social Justice, formerly known as the Unitarian-Universalist

Fellowship for

Social Justice.

STEPHEN H. FRITCHMAN has been minister of the church

since 1948.

Reverend STEPHEN H. FRITCHMAN is described in the Fourth

Report, Un-American Activities Committee in California, 1948,

as a very active "Communist fronter"

itself, connote membership in or sympathy with the Communist Party.

a loose-knit agency composed of young

militant, black nationalists from South Los Angeles who have

eliminated all Caucasians from their ranks and have initiated a

program against the draft, the war in Vietnam and discrimination

and have proposed a revolutionary program utilizing armed force,

political and economic action to obtain their goals.

LA-SNCC is

an arm of the National Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee

organization will be more harmonious.

when they are stopped in South Los Angeles.

A source, in Mey, 1968, indicated that IA-SNCC leadership

has encouraged a11

associates of LA-SNCC to obtain arms and to be

armed at all times.

On April 5, 1968, fOUr IA-SNIC officers were arrested

1520 NEW HAMPSHIRE AVENUE, NORTH WES!

WASHINGTON, D. C.

On August 21, 1970 a source who is in a position to

furnish reliable Information advised the Federal Bureau of

Investigation (FBI) as follows:

"Gentlemen:

"The attached letter was received in the mail

today.

Perhaps the times we live in have made

me super-conscious of our nation's security, but

the letter sounds a little shady to me.

For

example, wouldn't this be a perfect way for a

foreign

power (or even radical Americans) to deter-

mine what it takes to destroy American industry?

" For all I know, the Institute for Policy

Studies could be

a communist front for an

espionage operation.

"At any rate, we're Not going to provide Mr.

Raskin with the rather vital information he

asks for... and you may put his letter in your

fIles in case you decide he also sounds

suspicIous to you."

The letter to which the first source is referring was

typed with an IPS letterhead, dated

August 17, 1970, and signed

Marcus G. Raskin, Co-director. The letter was addressed to Granite

City Steel, Public Relations Department, Granite City, Illinois.

It stated as follows:

materials which you might have con-

cerning this question including, a

biographical resume of the person or

persons in charge of your security

program.

Thank you very much. "

On August 28, 1970 a second source who is in a

position to furnish reliable information advised that the Corning

Glass Works, Corning, New York received a letter from Marcus G.

Raskin, which 1s Identical to the one described above.

On 9/22/70 another investigative agency provided the

FBI with Information that the Hewlett-Packard Company, Palo

Alto, California also received a copy of the above described

letter from Marcus G. Raskin of the IPS.

-Re-the IP'S:

The IPS has been characterized in an article in,

the Washington, D. C. weekly newspaper,

"The Examiner"

dated September 24, 1967 page 22

by baith Kermit Roosevelt.

She stated in part

= that the IPS is a Washington based "Think Factory"

which helped train extremists who incite violence

In U.S. cities, and whose educational research

•serves as a cover for intrigue and political

agitation.

Through its conference and seminars, the

IPS

exerts a continuing influence on the ideology

and tactics of the Newsleft.

In addition, Marcus Raskin has also been publicly

More recently Raskin was credited in a Washington Post

at a conference on Military Budget and National Priorities, the

dismantling of the Central Intelligence Agency, the Defense Depart-

ment, and the National Security Agency within the next decade as

the only sure way of reversing the "national security" state.

In April, 1970 a third source who has provided reliable

information in the past advised that Marcus Raskin was one of the

speakers at a convention of Federal Employees for Peace, Equality,

and Priorities held In Washington

Raskin stated

in part

that such Government agencies. as the FBI, Secret Service

intelligence services of other Government agencies, and the military

should be done away with, in that order. He labeled these

agencies as un-American.

He stated that the capitalistic system

in the United States 1s causing imperfalism and aggression in

other parts of the world and that federal employees should

organize to encourage the Government to change these policies and

to do away with the above mentioned agencies.

liaison with groups around the country.

A man who once had a place of honor in the office

of President kennedy's rational Security Council, Marcus

Raskin,

heads up IPS's Frogram 2 which at the moment is collecting

information about the men who handle security for the nation's

industrial plants. Raskin, another Libera Papers author, was

once on Ranparts board of directors, and was an out-spoken critic

of the CIA and the National Security Agency and other intelligence

organizations.

In mid-August Raskin sent a letter to the public

relations departments i 500 American companies, Informing the

PR men: "I am doing alstudy of the problems of

thank you very much.

PR men habitually

respond to such inquiries without asking questions themselves.

Contacted by "Comat" Raskin said he was doing the research for

a book which would show "the class background and educational

background of the men who head tarious programs, who are part

of the business elite.

He said lone of his irerests was to find

out what happened to ex-military officers and ex-FBI agents.

Most American firns will not conceal the background of their

security managers, but when a man who in the past has attacked

national security

programs (e.g, nuelear testing, Sybolt

missiles, etc.) tries to compile

a filing cabinet of dossiers

on the men who guard the country's industrial plants, security

agents are suspicious.

Not suspicious enough though.

than 200 ceplies."

"Combat" is a nevsletter published by National

Review, Inc., and is described as a Newsletter that "keeps

you informed

about the revolutionary struggle in America today."

A second source, who has furnished reliable informa-

tion in the past, advised

on December 9, 1970 that it had come

to his attenti on

that such

an inquiry had been received by the

Corporate Information Section of the Corporate Relations Divi-

sion, Eastman Kodak Company, Rochester, New York, la number of

months ago.

A brief reply was directed to the sender informing

The source advised that no record was maintained of the inquiry

and

reply by the eastman Kodek Company, and recollection of the

incident was disclosed by an official in charge of the depart-

ment.

A third source, who has lurnished reliable intormation

in the past, advised on December 9, 1910 that the industrial

Mnagement Counci. of Rochester

which maintains contact with

Industrial Management personnel from Rochester firms, was

aware of contact made by IPs with the Xerox Corporation and the

matter was brought up at one of the Industrial Management

meetings, primarily to alert responsible persons to the possi

bility to receiving

such an inquiry

fron Raskin. No additional

information has come to the sources' attention of any additional

contacts with local industry.

Re the IPS:

The IPS has been characterized in an article in

stated in part

that

the IPS is a lashington based "Think Factory"

which helped train extremists who incite violence

in U.S. cities, and whose educational research

serves as a cover for intrigue andpolitical agi-l

tation.

Through its conference and seminars,

the IPS exerts a continuing influence on the

ideology and tactics of the New Left.

Re MARCUS GOODMAN RASKIN:

RASKIN has been publicly described as Co-director and

Trustee of the lis; AB University of Chicago; JP University of

Chicago Law School; Trustee of Antioch College, associatc

editor of

"Ramparts Magazine,"

and author of many articles on

public policy.

"Ramparts" is a monthly magazine with editorial

offices in San Francisco, California. The

September

10, 1967 issue

of the

"Denver Post"

contained

an article on "Ramparts" which states

in part that it is

"radical in style and poli-

tics.

In addition,

MARCUS RASKIN has also been publicly

described as a co-defendent with Dr. BENJAMIN SPOCK on charges

of conspiracy to advise others to avoid

the draft.

More recently RASKIN was credited in a Washington

Post newspaper article entitled "Military Influence Deplored,"

as urging at a conference on Military Budget and National

Priorities,

the dismantling of the Central Intelligence

Agency, the

Defense Department, and the National Security

Agency within the next decade as the only sure way of re-

1. What is the donon's view of the International

Institute and how does his view airect liu options with

(Raskin suggested early 1973, as a likely daten)

that directions have been taken by people in

Dear Mr. Steadman:

As I explained to you when you were kind enough

• to grant me an interview with yourself and Mr. Howard

C. Anderson, Vice president and General Counsel of CUP,

the Federation of American Scientists is.looking into üne

question of privacy of communications with a view to in-

forming our members. I have left you with three requests.

I wanted to know the number of persons who had asked C & P

to check their lines with a view to possible evescropping..

I wanted to speak to the management of the security depari-

ment that conducts such checks. And I wanted the privilege

of interviewing some of the men who deal directly with

customers in installing and checking phones.. I appre-

ciate your willingness to consider these

requests and

"I:look fontard to your response.

•As I mentioned to

you over the telephone, I am

still confused about certain questions and wonder if,

for

the sake of precision. I mignt lie you about them;

The fact of the matter is

that I have received. contiicting.

reports on some of these questions.

1.

As far as is known to C&.!, representatives

of other Government agencies do not a) own trucks

that are designed to give the impression that they

are telephone company trucks; b) send their personnel into

homes along with C & P personnel (whether with Government

warrants or otherwise) in such a way as to create ine

illusion

inaü both are repair men c) otherwise represent

themseives direcily or indirectly, as telephone company

personnel..

is this correct?

%.

As far as is known to c&?, has any telephone compary

employee ever been disciplined or fired for electronic evesaropping

whether authorized or unautherized. How common is this?

3. You have advised me that the telephone company does not "place

the taps" that may be authorized by court order.

Does it, however,

a) lease lines for that purpose b) supervise the placing of the caos

c) otherwise cooperate in the placing of the tap.

In the case of cour

ordered evesdropping that may use the telephone lines, does the tele

phone company cooperate wich law enforcement officiais whose warrant

You said that this is cone after . :

i the Department of justice is notified.

•May I see a blank copy of à

form advising a private party that evesdropping had been going on on his

line? How many persons were advised that such devices had been found

over the last few years? How many devices have been found? How many

persons issued requests for inspection of their lines? Are reporis of

these statistics made to the F.C.C.?

5. Does the telephone company have written procedures for

verifying and handling requesis of the Federal Government for coopera-

tion in national security evesdropping cases?

Is it satisfied that

ali requests made to it, in this regard, by the justice Department,

military intelligence agencies and/or the CiA were personally authorized

by the Attorney General acting for the President?

6.

Has the telephone company-found evidence of wiretapping by

Soviet or Eastern European agents?

7: Has the telephone company ever uncovered a bugging device in

the office, or at the home, of a Congressman or Senator?

I do not wish

to know particulars of a private nature, of course.

Let me thank you in advance for helping me with these questions.

As you know, a sizable number of parsons serously question the security

of their telephone lines.

& complete and Tull answer to these questions

would, I am sure, allay many or the anxieties my members feel.

MEMORANDUM FOR FILI:

Re: Interview with Di. Jeremy J. Stone

In response to Dr. Stone's letter to ir. Bolger, a copy of

which is attached, I called Di. Stone on January 7, and arranged io

meet with him on January 8 at 2:30 p.r. in my oifice. Howaxa C.

Anderson was present during most of the meeting.

In response to our inquiry, Di. Stone described the Federation:

of American Scienüsts as a nonprost organization interesied in legistative

action with respect to issues allecting science and society. With respect

to himself, Di. Stone stated that he held à doctorate in mathematics,

although ho was not actively pursuing that discipline at this time.

He

indicated that he had recently written on political subjects, and trat

his current activity was directed toward political and social problems.

Di. Stone stated that he was interested in our procedures 10r

handling national security and other authoriced wiretapping. he was tola

thai we had specific procedures for handling couxt-ordered wiretapping

which we would ouiline for him, but that we would not discuss national

security wiretapping and that this aspect of the aubject should properly be

discussed with the Federal agencies involved.

Di. Stone expressed dissatisfaction with our refusal to discuss

national security wiretapping; he stated that one of his concerns is that

uncontrolled cooperation beiween the "'bureaucracies" of the Telephone

Company and the I. B.I: was a distinct possibility and would impose a

ical nazara to the legitimüle privacy of individuals. He expressed a

strong iceling that this arca was a legitimate concern for organizations

such as his, and that a réfusal to discuss the subject was unwarrantea.

We repcated that we would not discuss national security wire-

tapping, and thai anything that was said did not apply io this area. With

respect to court-ordered wiretapping, we statea that our practice was

that an employee of the Company would inspect the court order to

determine that it was valia on its face before any cooperation jas given.

Di. Stone asked to see the form on which a record of such inspaction

.was mâce. . He stated that the procedure for inspection would undoubiecy

require a lorm and be appeared areptical oi pur statements wit respeci

to our practice. Ho continued to talk di thaaation di the IrBr-ana

ng the distinction between

japiions, We again pointed out

that we were discussing

Only procedures in cout-ordcied intcrceptions, and further told him

that the assistance provided in such cases was ordinarily limitca to

cable and pair information, and that additional assistance was orly

...

"rovided under unusual circumstances. We staicd that, to our

¡novicage, additional assistance in no case had includcd the actual

connection of the tap by employees of our Corapany.

Di. Stone inquired about our handling of requests for line.

checks by subscribers who suspect a tap. We iold him that a cacci

would be made, and that the customer would be advised wactner or not

evidence of lampering was found. Taps would be reporied to law

enforcement agencies to determine if they were couit-ordered and to

afford opportunity for investigation it unlawíul, but that the cusiomes

would be advised in any event.

Di. Stone asserted that our statements were inconsisten witn

testimony by Bell System witnesses at Congressional hearings. He

indicated thai he was referring to testimony before the Long Commitee,

and we pointed out that the policy we were discussing was formulaied

to implement the provisions o1 the Omnibus Crime Conirol Bill of 1968

and thai the practices were not necessarily applicable prior to thai time.

Di. Stone requested the number of such inquiries from subscribers, and

the results of our investigations. We indicated that we would see whai

information was available. He asked if reports of such activites were

made to the F.C.C., and we said that we did not know whether any such

reports were required, but that it required, they were undoubtedly made.

Di. Stone remarked that there was some conflict in testimony he had

read concerning whether or not such reports were made.

Discussing the handling of customer complaints, we pointed out

that a repori to the suspect was required by the law within a shori period.

following termination of the interception; Di. Stone later indicated that

he was not aware of this provision.

DI. Stone asked how we would fecl about impersonation oi

Company employces by law enforcement officials engaged in interceptiono.

He was told that we would not like such a pracüce. Di. Sione asscried

that such action was wide spread and shouldn't somathing be done by the

Company about it. We replied that we had no knowledge oi such imper-

sonations, and since our employees were not in uniform it was difficuit

to distinguish between a

Company employee and other craitsmen wearing

tool belis.

Di'. Stone again asserted inat ine practice was wide spread;

that our craitsmen knew all about it; and that the Compasy should

investigaic the matter.

interested persons in the Soviet Union. Stone indicalea

to Kutakov that he had already mailed copies of his bool:

to several persons in the Soviet Union who are interested

in disarmament.

The source advised that Stone intended to atiend

the International Congress of Mathematics in Moscow, Union

of Soviet Socialist Republics, and would be in Moscou with

his wife, a student of the Russian language, as well as a

Doctor of Mathematics, from August 14 to August 30, 1965.

book had been sent, he and his wife could stay until coptember

The NYO has summarized the above letter in the LHM

in an effort to further conceal the confidential source.

Boston is requested to ascertain if the writer of

communication is identical to the son of the long-time

CP member, ISIDOR EDINSTEIN STONE. It identical, Boston

should handle in accordance with instructions contained in

Section 105K of the Manual of Instructions.

Boston should also be alerted to the fact that the

Soviet Intelligence Service is especially interested in

cultivating and using persons of STONE's caliber.

It is

extremely possible that if STONe is the son of the long-

time CP member, the KGB may be aware of this and could

possibly utilize some way to approach STONE while he is in

MOSCOW.
