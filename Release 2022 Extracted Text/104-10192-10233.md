for. SOURCE had, after Hr. ZAKRZEWSKI"s' Introductory remarks, quite correctly _
Sucased what was meant by the straight deal" and-he, therefore, triéd to avoid~
ithe subject... Mr. ZAKRIEWSKI'then asked SOURCE frankly how he did with his
Painting. SOURCE could’ only truthfully reply that his art was definitely not
sulted to provide a living for him and.his wife. This was also the reason,
"SOURCE emphasized, that he wanted to leave Poland because-he could no longer:
Bear to live from his wife's income. rites

"This 1s all well known to us” said Mr. ZAKRIEWSKI, "but do you in all
Seriousness believe that you will'do better in West Germany? They have painters
by the thousands and you, as.a newcomer to this crowd,-will only be sorry to’have
Joined them. You will have to depend on your wife's income more than with us in
Poland".. Mr. ZAKRZEWSKI.then continued: that the aid which SOURCE would recoive
would enable him to better devote hinself to his are because financial worries -
would be taken from his mind. "Is not this a straight deal?", Mr. ZAKRZEWSKI
asked, "you help us and ve help you, and we know that your help will be worth the
money". When SOURCEasked what was meant by "ua" and ‘we and what kind of

: -Whelp" he: was, expected to offer, Hr. ZAKRZKWSKI cautiously replied that, before
being more. specific, he would need SOURCE's agreement to the proposition.

"Please try -to understand", Mr. ZAKRZEWSKI aid, "Il represent, as you have seen,
the government, and it is part of the deal that details of your mission will be
made known. to you the moment we know that you are willing to help." SQURCE then
refused by emphasizing that, as an artist, he folt in cio way competent for the
mission which doubtlessly will be assigned to him in-Cermany. His nerves would
not stand the strain and, sooner or later, he would fail, and thus ruin himself.
Mr. ZAKRZEWSKI. accepted SOURCE's refusal withdut the slightest.sign of dis-
appointment, impatience or anger. He Listened to SOURCK'S words with a friendly

! ssSmile on his face, and commented that such a reaction was enly natural and even

ene reasonable froma man like SOURCE, and: it was only furthée proof of SOURCES

ole inordinate intelligence and integrity. He assured SOURCE that there was no
hurry, and important things quite natirally need some time to be carefully thought

i over. . Inviting SOURCE to carefully reconsider the offer, he asked for permission

i ett to approach’ the matter a second tine in a few weeks. wn this occasion, SOURCE

i r should be prepared, after Mr. ZAKRZEWSKI's telephone call, to come to the hotel

H 7 "BRISTOL" on ULICA. PIERSZEGO MAJA” (First of May Road), vhere matters could be

| discussed more easily. SOURCE agreed to this arranvement because he was afraid

thie, ; that, by a flat and uncompromising refusal, be would jeopardize his exit permit.

7 ‘ The hotel “BRISTOL” was an impressive four-storied building with a tavern
Glace and a night-club;-which had been renovated in 1960. It vas patronized by well-to-
do members of the intelligentsia and tourists. ie renenbered having heard from
‘ fellow members of his painters’ club that the secret police had rented a wing in

A. OPERATIONS OF THS BORDER SECURITY TROOPS

1. Border Area

‘The border area was established by a law passed by the National Counell
dated 21 March 1958, which revised the existing law governing the security of
the Polish frontier. Source could not recall any details of the law, except
that it stated that the border area waS divided into three parts: the forbidden

strip, the border strip,and the border zone.

a. Forbidden Strip (Pas Wzbrontony)

This was a strip of land, also referred to as the border control path
(Pas Drogt Granieznej), ¥nich was completely under the Border Security Troops’
{Wojsko Ochrony Pograntcza-WOP) administration and control. Tnere were no
markers indicating its lialts. The width varied, depending on the terrain;
it was never narrower thai 10 mand seldom wider than 100 m, however. The

forbidden strip was an evacuated area, but by Special permission the local
population could enter {t for a Limited time to remove firewood and harvest

nay.

The forbidien strip was 6 m wide and was plowed; a telephone, line
ran parallel to it; ani wooden observation towers on it were spaced 3 to 5 km
apart, depending on teld of vision. To the best of Source's knowledge,
there were no physical obstacles, such as barbed-wire fences, electrified
fences, and trip flares en the Polish frontier, except west of SZCZHCIN.

The physical security means along the coast were the same as along
the inland border except that radar toers were to replace the observation

towers sometime in 1962.
b. Border Strip (Strefa Nadgraniczna)

Source described the border strip as an area over which the Border
Security Troops exercised operational control. It extended 2 to 6 km from
the border or from the coast and 1t was marked with a sign "Strefa Nadgranicans:
All persons desiving to reside within the border strip were required to obtain
permission trom their county Citizens’ Militia (MO) office. Upon arrival
in the border strip area, they were required to register for permanent or
temporary residence with the local Registrar's Office (Biuro Meldunkowe). In
the coastal arca, during summer months (15 April to 15 October) tourists and

vacationers were not required to obtain entry permits from their local MO;

the border strip required no special authorization.

ce. Border Zone (Zona Graniczna)

Source defined the border zone as an area over which the Border
Seourity Troops brigades exercised limited operational control. The zone
extended up to $0 km from the border. The entrance into the border zone was
not marked and no special documentation was required to enter or reside in it.

Coastal Waters

The coastal waters were divided into two zonest the territorial
waters, extending 3 nautical miles from the shore at low tide, and waters of
the adjacent strip (Strefa Wed Przyleglych), extending Into the sea for an
additional 3 nautical miles. The WOP exercised complete operational control
over the territdrial waters only. It was within the WOP authority to enforce,
existing water traffic regulations; to prevent fishing within the limits of
the territorial waters by foreign fisaing fleets, and to search all craft for
stowaways, proper documentation of the crews, and contraband.

2. Criteria for Selection of WOP Personnel

qhe WOP enlisted men came from normal conscription channels. Source

did not know the criteria for selection used by the District Military
Otfice (Wojskowa Komenda ReJjoncwa-sKR), but he thought that to quality a
couseript had to have only a clean police record and a minimim of 7 years of
education; political reliability and membership in the Conminist Party were
not factors.

Conseripts with ll years of educatign (gimiazium) were selected for
officer candidate training upon graduation,© and sent- directly to WOP Orficers’
School at KETRZYN, or for NCO training, or were assigned to port battalions
or to border traffte control’ pests.

headquarters. Here, they were acsiguad to the Brigade Recruit Training Center,
where they underwent 2 weéxs of preliminary training and cursory medical
‘xamination, and were organized into training compantes, platoons and squads,
Following the 2-week preliminary training tney were given 14 weess of basic
infantry training and basic borde= security training.

‘The conscripts were sworn in after 8 weeks of basic training, usually

on New Year's Day. Upon success*:2 comphetioa-of the basic training in early
February they were selected for srectalist training ani NCO training. The
specialist training prepared the Graftees for duty with pert battalions or
with border control posts. The ining lasted from 6 to 12 weeks. Con-
Scripts who were selected for NCO training attended the Brigade NCO School,

which lasted 9 months.

‘The mandatory training in the outposts was conducted by officers and

noncommissioned officers. Because of the staggered hours of border duty,
the training was conducted twice <atly, from 0800 to 1100 hours, and from 1300

to about 1600 hours. Garrison training was rather Inefficlent and the schedule

yas not rigidly followed because of the shortage of personnel. The sain stress
in garrison training was placed ox border guard subjects. The men were taught
the methods used by border violators, border reyulations, detecticn and inter-
pretation of tracks left on the rlowal strip, familiarization with documents
hd permits used tn ae border zone and at border crossing points, types of
patrol duties, searching and conveying of arrested personnel, and use of

Service dogs. All WOP personnel were required to qualify ith their individual
weapon twice @ year.

Garrison training was suspexded from Septenber through February, during

which time part of the old conseripts were discharged while the new conscripts

were still undergoing basic training.

B. JOINT MANEUVERS :

-

In July 195y, while assigned to the SLIWNO PZ Post as CI officer, Source
received orders to report to the Baltic WOP Brigade headquarters at KOSZALIN,
to participate in Joint maneuvers scheduled to take place on the coast from
25 July to 10 August 1959. Upon arrival at the Brigade headquarters, he was
briefed by the chief of CI Division, Major BRZOZOWSKI, (fu), on the general
situation, then on his specific assignment. Source was assigned the duties of
a CI officer in Lebork County with a mission to organize a civil observation and
reporting force, alert to airborne and seaborne hostile forces.

Source recalled from the briefing on the general situation the following
alignment of forces:

all Yocal sivil authorities, social and political organizations, labor and -
industria! enterprises; the adequacy of existing SOP's; radio and wire com-
munication means along the coastal zone in the event of a surprise enemy attack
from air or sea; and the alertness and reporting procedures of the WOP outposts

deployed along the Baltic coast.

The Limits of the maneuver area extended along a line from NOWCGARD
through BIALGGARD to LEBCRK in the south, and along the coast line from DZIWNOW

to KARWIA in the north.

4. Execution of the Maneuver

‘Tne Line units of the Baltic WOP Brigade remained in place and conducted
their norm! border security duties.

The remaining elements of the defending force were assembled in a wooded
area in the vicinity of KOSZALIN.

From about 2? July to about 6 August the Ci officers organized the
eivil defense force and radio-telephone comminication net {n the maneuver
area; recomneitered their areas of responsibility for possible landing beaches
and air drop sites, and reported them to the chief of the CI Division at KOSZALIN;
ved, interrogated and further processed ¢ ed paratroopers who 7

were dropped in small numbers (three or four) in the saneuver area for the
purpose of Sisrupting commnicatlons, similating destruction of radar, radio

stations ani bridges.
It was established from the interrogation of the POW's that the enemy
Sea force, preceded by a sassed air drop, would land cn beaches in the vicinity

of ROWY ang MRZEZYNO. ‘

A fully motorized reserve force, strength unknown, was kept in the
headquarters of the Baltiz WOP Brigade, and in the assecyly area near KOSZALIN

as mobile reinforcements to be used when and where needed.

About 8 August 1952, under cover of darkness. about 80 paratroopers
were droppes in the vicinity of LEBORK. Their mission was to penetrate south
as deeply as possible and destroy bridges and commaication centers. An unidenti-

C. AIR AND HOME TERRITORIAL ANTIAIR DEFENSE FORCES (Powtetrzna Obrona Przeciw
Lotnicza Obszaru KraJoweyo-POPLOK) (See Annex A for Source's schematic concept

of the organization.)

Source could not give a detailed description of this organization, but from
lectures heard at the WOP Officers’ School at KETRZYN* and from briefings
attended during ‘the Joint maneuvers described in paragraph B above, he

described it in the following general terms:

‘The supreme headquarters for the organization was the headquarters of the
Warsaw Pact Forces, through the Polish Ministry of National Defense. Source
