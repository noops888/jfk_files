In Dec 61, SOURCE lad applied to the KATOWICE: 5016N-1J0LE Province Adrint-

stration for an exit permit to west Geriany.

In Apr i2, still walting for an

answer, he vas approached by a secret agent who tried to talk him into colla-

borating vich the Polish Intelligence servico:

Because the agent had invited

hir to tlie Hotel "DHISTOL" in DITOM, SOURCE ohtalued reliable confirmation of the

assertion by friends that this hotel was the location of the BYTOM branch office

of the Polish intelligence service.

SOURCE, an artist of above average intelligence

and experience, soon understood what the agent vas driving at, and refused on che

grounds that he was completely incompetent for intelligence work.

SOURCk related

his experience in the desire to drav attention to the subtle nethods applied by

intelligence service. His

staterents were accepted as credible tecause

of the honesty with which SOURCE descrited lis our attitude and reactions.

then explained that he was authorised to

offer Solnck a straight

deal which, if solkce only cared to consider li realistically, would turn out to

their mutual benefit.

soUrcE's personality, particularly his

academic education

and hia reputation as a painter together with hin knows lovel attitude towards

the state, qualified SOURCE as the ideal partner in a sumerlar delicate under-

taking:

The personalities of influence, for vhom ur. -urstsky was authorized

to speak, could not think of any one

with qualtiicarions better clian SOURCE's.

souRcE replied that, of course, he would gladly become a partner to any efforts

intended to promoto

the arts because they vere the oily things he really cared

for. SOURCE had, after Mr. ZAREEnSKI's' Introductory resarks, quite correctly

guessed what was meant by the fatraight deal" and he; therefore; tried to aroid

the subject..

Мг.

ZAKREEWSKI then asked SOURCE frankly how he did with his

rainting: source could only trithfully renly that his art was definitely not

suited to provide a living for his and his wife.

This was also the reason,

SOURCE emphasiied,

that he wanted to leave Pöland because he could no longar:

bear to lire from his wife's income.

"This 1o all well knowm to us" said Mr. ZAKHELUSKI, "but do you in all

Berlousness

believe that you will do better in West Gemany? They havo palnters

by the thousands and you, as a nevconer to thia crowd, will only be sorry to have

Joined then.

You will have to depend on your win's income more than with us in

Poland". Mr. ZAKHZEWSKi. then continued that the ald which SOURCE vould recoive

would enable hin to better devote hiaself to hia art because financial vorries

would be taken from his mind.

"Is not this a straight deal?", Mr. ZAKRZEWSKI

asked, "you help us and we help you, and ve know that your help will he worth the

money.

When SOURCE asked what was meant by "un" and "me" and what kind of

"'help" he was expected to offer, Mr. ZARZEWSKI cautlously replied that, before

being more specific, he would need SOURCE's agrocinent to the proposition.

"Please try to understand", Mr, LNKRZENSKI Bald, "I reprosent, as you have seen,

the government; and it is part of the deal that details of your mission ll be

made known. to you the moment ve know that you are willing to help."

SOURCK then

refused by emphasizing that, as an artist, he fole in no way competent for the

mission

which doubtlessly will be assigned to him In Corsany.

His nerves would

not stand. the strain and,

gooner or later, he would fail, aid thus ruin himsell.

Mr. ZAKRZEWSKI.accepted SOURCE's refusal without the slightest. sign of dis-

appointment;

impatience or anger.

He. listened to SOURis's words with a friendly

smile on his face, and commented that such a reaction vas only natural and even

reasonable from a man like SOUrcE, and it was only further proof of SOURcE's

Inordinate intelligence and integrity.

He assured SOURCE that there was no

hurry, and important things quite raturally need some rise to be carefully thought

Inviting SOURCE to carefully reconsider the offer, he asked for permission

to approach the matter a second tine in a

fer wecks. On this occagion, soURcE

after Mr. ZAKHZEsSKI's telephone call, to come

to the hotel

"BRISTOL'' on ULICA PIERSZEÇO MAJA" (Pirst of May Road), where matters could be

discussed more casily.

SOURCE agreed to this arrangement decause he was afraid

that, by a flat and uncompromising refusal, he rould jeopardize his exit permit.

The hotel "BRISTOL" was an impressive four-storied building with a tavern

and a night-club, which had been renovated in 1960. It was patronized ly well-to-

do members of the intelligentsia and tourists.

He renembered having heard from

fellow members of his painters' club that the secret police had rented a wing in

one of the upper stories of this hotel.. The rooms, nuber unknow, were said to

be furnished as offices and club rooms.

OPERATIONS OF THS BORDER SECURITY TROOPS

1. Border Area

The border area was established by a law passed by the National Council

dated 21 March 1958, which revised the existing law governing the security of

the Polish frontier. Source could not recall any details

of the law, except

that it stated that the border area was

divided into three parts: the forbidden

strip, the border strisjand the border zone.

a. Forbidden Strip (Pas Wabrontony)

This was a strip of land, also referred to as the border control pach

(Pas Drogs Granioznes), which was completely under the Border Sacurity Troops'

(Wojsko Ochrony Pograzicsa-WOP) administration and controi.

There were no

markers indicating its limits.

The width varled, depending on the terrain;

It was never narrower can 10 m and seldom wider

than 100 m, however.

The

forbidden strip was a: evacuated area, but by special permission tha local

population could entor it for a limited time to remove firewood and harvest

nay.

The forbidden strip was 6 m wide and was plowed; a telephone. line

ran parallel to it; as wooden observation tovers on it were

spaced 3 to 5 km

apart, depending on die :leld of vision.

To the best of Source's knowledge,

there were no physical ecstacles, such as barbed-wire

fences,

electrifler

fences, and trip flares on the Polish frontier, except rest oi szuzbein.

In the coastal areas the forbidden strip reruined off limits to

pedestrian traffic

15 April to 15 Cutober.

There vere no movement restrictlons within tie strip

In the daylight hours äuring the vacallen season from 15 April to 15 Ditober.

The physical security means along the coast were lie same as along

che inland border except

owers sometime in Iyci I wat radar losers were to replace the observation

b. Border Strip (Strefa Nadgraniesna)

Source described the border strip as an area over which the Border

Security Troops exeruised operational control.

It extended 2 to 6 km from

the border of from tie coast and it was marked with a sign

All persons desiring to reside within

the border strip were required to obtain

permission ¡rom their county Citizens' Militia (MO) office.

Upon arrival

In the border strip area, they were required to register for permanent or

temporary residence with the local Registrar's Office (Bluro Meldunkowe). In

the coastal area, during summer montha (15

April to 15 October) tourists and

vacationers were not requirei to obtain encry permits from their local MO:

they were required to register, however.

Transient passenger traffic through

the border strip required no special authorization.

C.

Border Zone (Zona Graniczia)

Source defined the border zone ay an area over which the Border

Security Troops brigades exercised limited operational control.

extended up to 30 im from the border.

The entrance Into the border zone was

not marked and no special documentation was required to enter or reside in it.

d. Coastal waters

The coastal waters were divided into two zoneg:

the territorial

waters, extending 3 nautical miles fron the shore at low tide, and waters of

the adjacent strip (Strefa Wod Pizyleglych), extending Into the sea for an

additional 3 nautical miles.

The WOP exercised complete opprational controi

over the territorial waters only.

It was within the hOP authority to enforce

existing water traffic regulailons; to prevent fishing within the limits of

the territorial waters by foreign fisning fleets, and to search all craft, ior

stowaways, proper documentation of the crens, and contraband.

2. Criteria for Selection of WOP Personnel

The WOP enlisted men came from normal conscription channels. Source

did not know the criteria for selection used by the District Military

ofrice (wojskora Komends Rejonora-KR), but he thought that to quallty a

conscript, had to have only a clean police record and a minimum of l years of

education; volitical reliabiliiy and membership in the Communist Party were

Conscripts with I1 years of education (olmazium) were selected For

officer candidate training upon graduation,

and sent. directly

to WOP Officers'

School at KETRZYN, OF

for NO training, or here assigned to port battalions

or to border traifle control pists.

3. Training

After passing the medical examination at the local WKR, early in

Otober, the conscripts received orders to report directly to WOP Brigade

where they underwent a weeks of arellainary

training and cursory medical

examination, and were organized ines training companies, platoons and squads.

Following the 2-week preliminary training they were given li weeis of basie

Infantry training and basic bonier security training.

The conscripts were snorn in after 8 weeks of hasic training, usually

on New Year's Day.

scripts who were selected for Nüd training attended the Brigade NCO. School,

which lasted 9 months.:

of the staggered hours

of border duty,

the training was conducted tuice isily, from 0800 to 1100 hours, and from 1300

to about 1600 hours.

Garrison irgining

was rather Inefticlent and the schedule

was not rigldly followed because of the shortage of personnel.

The main stress

in garrison training was placed

an border guard sub lects.

methods used by

border violators, border regulations, detection and inter-

pretation of tracks left on the piered strip, familiarizacion with documents

and permits used

in le border sone and at border crossing points, types of

patrol duties, searching and conveying of arrested personnel, and use of

service dogs.

was required to repeat only the pertinent parts of the order.

5. Planning of Border Securitz

The outpost commander was responsible for the security of the border

sector charged to his outpost.

In preparing his plans for the safeguarding

of his sector he guided himself by

order's and instructions received from higher

headquarters

(battalion and brigade); by the analysis of the local situation

officer and his recommendation; and by the terrain features existing

In the sector.

The commanding officer could order normal operations or reinforced

operations (sluzba wzmocniona) .

The reinforced operations were ordered in the

event of border violation, or an expected border violation; during political

unrest, such

as the Hungarian revolution of 1950 and Poznan evente of 1955;

during national holldays, 1 May and 22 July; during Christmas, New Year, and

Easter seasons; and during locally organized political conventions, vazaars,

county fairs, and local celebrations in the border strip.

The reinforced

operations were ordered under the assumption that during the increased

traffic near the

border the incidents of border violetions increased

and the

alertness of the border troops decreased.

During reinforced operations the

number of posted patrols was increased by 40 percent and the tow of duty

was extended up to 10 hours for enlisted men and career noncommissioned

officers and to 6 hours for officers.

Upon deciding on a plan of securing the border for a given time period

the commanding officer entered a detailed plan of action in the outpost opera-

tions logbook (Kslazka Operacyjna) ..

In his plan, he decided whether normal

or. reinforced operation would

be conducted; designated by name the various

border patrols and

their sector of responsibility; organlzed the area of

responslbility so that they were overlapping and mutually supporting;

and prepared alert plans

for border violations, fire, air attack, and in case

of the outposts alon

the Baltie Sea, against airborne and waterborne attacks.

Source had no information on the alert procedures except that troops were

form in full field equipment in predesignated assembly areas, and

that the noxt higher headquarters were notified about the alert,

6. Insenord and S1gns

Tho challenge (Haslo) and the reply (Odser) of the password for the

by the brigade headquariers.

The challenge was always a com-

ponent part of a weapon and the reply

was always the name of a city, which

started with the same letter as the challenge soni. The procedure for

challenging and replying was as follows:

Challengor!

"Halt! Who goes there?" (Stoj! Kto idzie?)

Challenged:

Challenger:

"Border Service." (Sluzba Grantegna)

"Challenge?" (Haslo)

Challengod!

"Trigger." (Kurek)

Challensor: "KRAKOV; thank you; free passaje." (KRAKOW; Dziekuje; Droga Wolna)

Thare were no other means of mutual identification known to Source,

except murking

of the crossing of

the plowed strip described in paragraph ir,

above.

7. Roporting Procedures of Border VIolations

Whenever tracks on the plowed strip, or other indications of unauthorized

movement ware observed,

the patrol notified outpost headquarters at once by

telephono and by flares.

The outpost duty oificer alerted the entire outpost,

the CI offleer, the battalion headquarters, and both flanking outposts.

He

dispatched the service dog and the dog hanuler team to the place of violation,

deployed the alort detail

in the expected path of the border violator and

ordered roinforced operations within the sector of responsibillty.

At battalion headquarters the duty officer alerted the brigade head-

quarters, tha CI Section and adjacent battalion headquarters; and deployed the

battalion's reserve detail, paying particular artention to securing by road

blocks all road junctions, bus stops, and railroad stations within a rallus of

15 km of the point of border violation.

At brigade level the duty officer alerted the brigade nesdquarters and

deployed the reserve detail in the border zone,

road junctions, bus

stops, and railroad stations within a radius of 30 km

from the point of border

violation.

When it was determined that an Illegal border crosser had left Polish

the outpost duty officer obtaina: trough command channels permission

to pursue the violator into the foreign territory.

B; mutual agreement of the

Communist bloe countries such permissions sere promptly given, and border guards

on both sides of the border mutually cooperated.

similtaneously, the outpost

duty officer notified the local CI office:, who, assisted by the service dog

handler team, tracked hack the probable route di

escape in order to establish

the point of departure of the border violator and to determine whether any

help was rendered to the violator by a local accomplice.

The CI officer also

alerted his "Agentura" in order to deteruine whether any strangers were ob-

served in the area, and to obtain any inforsation on the suspect.
