GRAY said that he had been approached by MEROLA to

pick up the money. He said he declined such offer.

Former MM 722-C said he did not learn any details

as to the exact dates or places of the alleged kidnapings of

CATENA and RAYMOND. He continued that it is very unlikely

he will learn any further such details, as he declined to

participate by picking up the pay off money.

Source advised that

above information undoubtedly

is known to only three or four individuals her than himself

and any utilization or dissemination of this information would

without question seriously jeopardize his personal safety and

even his life. Source advised that for his own personal wel-

fare and safety he intends to contact both CATENA and RAYMOND

in the very near future and advise each of them of MEROLA's

plans and intentions with respect to these alleged kidnapings

and

shakedowns.

The Bureau is aware from previous correspondence

that JOE MEROLA and MIKE SWIATEK, mentioned above, were in-

volved in a major jewel theft in the Miami area previously,

and MEROLA confided in Departmental Attomey WILLIAM KENNEY,

Miami, of their participation in the same.

By previous correspondence captioned "HENRY HARVEY

HERMAN - VICTIM; KIDNAPING," furnished to the Bureau by Miami

teletype dated January 11,

1961, HERMAN was the victim of a

shakedown kidnaping in the Miami area. Continued reports

have been received and reported to the Bureau indicating other

similar shakedown kidnapings. By teletype dated July 26, 1961,

captioned "MM 722-C," the Bureau was advised of a contemplated

shakedown kidnaping on the part of MEROLA:

MM 92-463

As the Bureau is aware, MEROLA and the informant in

this matter, CHESTER GRAY, have been close associates for many

years.

They have been jointly involved in illegal activity in

the past. MEROLA has no visible means of support, however, the

mode of his living is such that he apparently has limited funds.

This money could be coming from such shakedown kidnaping activity.

No official complaint has been received concerning a

violation of the Federal law in the previous kidnapings and in-

vestigation and inquiry among informants has failed to reflect

such a violation. Based upon the information furnished as to

the contemplated action, it does not appear a Federal law would

be broken 'in this instance.

It is also known that in some of

the past previous alleged kidnapings, which apparently took place

according to informants, the victims have even denied these kid-

napings for fear of their lives.

and the Bure wit be advised do use matt one

has discussed this matter with both CATENA and RAYMOND.

In

view of GRAY's anticipated action, it is recommended this 1n-

formation not be disseminated to local authorities. There is

attached a letterhead memorandum for the Bureau's consideration

in disseminating the same to the Department inasmuch as MEROLA

is known to this office to be a close acquaintance and intormant

of Departmental Attomey WILLIAM KENNEY in Miami.F1
