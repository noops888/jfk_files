AND THEIR OPERATIONS IN THE UNITED STATES.

RICARDO ANIBAL MORALES NAVARRETE, Apartment 2,
1541 Southwest 4th Street, Miami, Florida, informed on
December 5, 1960, that he entered the United States at
Miami on November 29, 1960, and has requested political
asylum because he fears for his life should he be forced
to return to Cuba. He said he was a member of the Cuban
Army G-2 from December 10, 1959, until the latter part
of July, 1960. In addition to information concerning
his own activities, MORALES furnished the following
information concerning the organization and personnel
of the Cuban G=2:;

MORALES informed that G-2 is under the control
of the Ministerio de Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionariog DED
(Ministry of Revolutionary Armed Forces)5)(MINFAR) .

RAUL CASTRO is the head of MINFAR. He said that all
intelligence work was being controlled directly by G-2
since January, 1960, when there was a reorganization of
all intelligence and investigative organizations. The
Department of Investigations of the Revolutionary Army
(DIER) was abolished as a separate unit and its functions
were transferred to the Central Headquarters of G-2 and

is now known as the Operations Section of G-2. The

former chief of DIER, Commander ABELARDO COLOME TBARRAGASD>
is now chief of the Operations Section.

The Bureau of Naval Intelligence (BIN) was
abolished in January, 1960, and its operations were
tzansferred to a G-2 unit which operates within the
Cuban Navy. Lieutenant HERNAN BERNAL was the chief of
this unff:until he was assassinated in July, 1960.

NW 64954 Docld:34517503 Page 4


MM 105-1998

The Department of Technical Investigations of
the National Revolutionary Police is not a part of
Ge2 and handles criminal investigations only. This
Department operates solely within Cuba, principally in
Havana, and its chief is RAUL ARGUELLESGARDED

The section of the National Revolutionary
Police, knowm as "Confidential AG as abolished in
July, 1960, on orders of RAUL CASTRO.
COBA was in charge of Confidential A until about May,
“1960; when he was transferred to the Tourist Police.
Captain LUIS PEREZ JAENCWis then placed in charge and
remained in that post until the unit was abolished.

MORALES said there is a G-2 unit within the
National Police with a Lieutenant MARRERO in charge.
It is the duty of this unit to assure that the National
Police remain loyal to the present government and to
investigate charges of counterrevolutionary activities
against individual police officers.

According to MORALES, there are G-2 units
within all branches and sections of the Cuban Government,
labor, and principal industries. It is the responsibility
of these G-2 units to maintain complete loyalty to the
government of FIDEL CASTRO and to stamp out any activity
against. that regime. In each G-2 unit there is a
political commissar. These are,gesignated by the Direc-
cion de Cultura Del Ejercitg® Cultural Office}4xDED
are generally members of the Socialist Youth Organization.
| The political commissars receive four to five months'
training in commmist ideology at the Frank Paiz School,

NW 64954 Docld:34517503 Page 5


MM 105-1998

MORALES sid that all members of G-2 are being
requested to join the Commmist Party and if they refuse,
they are discharged or arrested.

He said he has heard there is an espionage
school being operated in the Ministry of Foreign
Relations; however, this is only hearsay and he has no
first-hand knowledge of it. He said he has heard that
the school is operated by MINFAR and persons who attend
are selected by G-2. They are generally "fellow-travelers"
with good educational backgrounds who can operate effective-
ly throughout Latin America. H said Cuba's principal
intelligence and propaganda activities are directed
toward the Latin-American countries in order to stir up
unrest, foster revolutions, and promote anti-United States
sentiment.

Miami, Key West, and New York are the points
of primary interest to Cuban Intelligence officers,
according to MORALES. He said their interests have in
the past been largely confined to seeking information
concerning the activities and plans of anti-CASTRO persons.
and groups in those areas.

MORALES said it is his understanding that
the person to be in charge of G-2 operations in a
particular city in the United States will be selected
‘by _RAMIRO VALDES! 11 be ordered to go to the United
States, but will not be officially assigned a Con-
sulate. He said that after CARLOS SANCHEZ: declared
persona non grata while operating as an agent for G-2
out of the Consulate in Miami, it was decided that in
the future the G-2. agent in charge in a particular city
would not work in the Consulate.

MM 105-1998

5 He said that the G-2 agent actually has more
authority than a Consul. He maintains contact with the
Consul and may utilize him to transmit information and
reports to Cuba. The Consul may also furnish the G-2
agent in charge a list of prospective sources of in-
formation, generally from among members of the local
26th of July Clubs. These persons are then contacted
directly by the G-2 agent or someone working for him.
Their assistance is requested and they are told the
type information that is needed. These sources may be
paid if necessary and the information they furnish
warrants payment. c

MORALES said he does not know who the Cuban
G-2 agents are who are operating in the United States
at th esent time, with the exception of HECTOR GARCIA .

___._S0T0$who uses the cover of Air Attache but actually

an intelligence agent, and MANUEL MAGARTI Oo is :
employed.by Cubana Airlines but a. works for Cuban
G-2. He said that_FRANK BESTARD’ TARDPOid him in about i
mid-1960 that he was then the person in charge of the :
G-2 apparatus in Miami. He said he does not know who :
has taken BESTARD's place now that BESTARD is back :
in Cuba.

MM T-1, another Government agency which con-
ducts intelligence and security investigations, in-
formed on January 3, 1961, that a Cuban national now
residing in the United States, who was a member of 4 Q
Cuban G-2 from July, 1959, until January, 1960, and hetd !
other positions in the Cuban Government until December, :
1960, reported that the Foreign Espionage Section is
personally supervised by RAMIRO VALDEZ and is’ influenced
greatly by FIDEL and RAUL CASTRO. A great deal of im-
portance is placed on this section. Main operations are
carried out by infiltrating agents into a country who
are supervised by a designated member of the Embassy
staff. In most cases the Cuban Ambassador or Consul is.
in charge of the agents; however, in some cases the
‘military attache is responsible for espionage direction. :

MM 105-1998

All information is returned to Cuba via the Embassy.
The Embassy is also used to pass communist propaganda
into the country.

The Internatiqgal Espionage Section is called
"Servicios Exteriore: and comes under the personal
direction of the G-2 Director, RAMIRO VALDEZ. Of course,
FIDEL and RAUL CASTRO and "CHE" GUEVARA have a direct
control over this section also. Other indivi
associated with this operation were RAUL ROA,
OLIVARES INO BOTT“ @hd (FNU) ECHAVARRI (Chief of

Protocal of Foreign Relations). About ten Russians
and Czechoslovakians are assigned to this section alone
and report directly to RAMIRO VALDEZ. These Soviet
Bloc technicans plan all foreign espionage activities.
All the Soviet Bloc advisors speak good Spanish. "I
do not recall any of the names of the Soviet Bloc -
personnel." :

MM T-2, a person acquainted with members of
the Cuban Consulates in New York and Miami, reported on
December 2, 1960, that the Cuban Government considers
the Miami, Florida, area to be-of considerably more
importance in the intelligence field than the New York
area because of the greater amount of counterrevolutionary
activities in the Miami area and its proximity to Cuba.

MIAMI, FLORIDA.

MM T-3, a person acquainted with members of
the Cuban Consulate, Miami, and their activities,
advised. lovember 14, 1960, that _EDELBERTO DIAZ

_ALARERe rtved in Miami, Florida, on that date from
Cuba as a replagement for Cuban Consul General ABELARDO
LEON BLANC b had been transferred to Cuba. The
informant remarked that shortly after DIAZ arrived,
he learned he had been sent to Miami as he is, 100%
with the Cuban Government.

MM T= orted on November 16, 1960, that
MANUEL coroners Auxiliary, Cuban Consulate,
New York City, was being transferred to the Cuban pperestate,
Miami. According to MM T-2, HERIBERTO RODRIGUEZ}: .
acquaintance of GUILLOT, was going to Miami to asiee
GUILLOT; however, RODRIGUEZ would not be an official
employee of the Cuban Foreign Service. The informant
believed GUILLOT and RODRIGUEZ would be watching
activities of anti-CASTRO Cubans in Miami, particularly
in.relation to alleged training camps in that. area. :

On December 1, 1960, MM T-2 stated that shortly
after the arrival of GUILLOT and RODRIGUEZ in Miami, -
GUILLOT proposed that acts of sabotage and terrorism
be committed in the Miami, Florida, area.in such a
manner that it would appear the anti-CASTRO forces and
sponsors of former Cuban Dictator FULGENCIO BATISTA were:
the instigators. GUILLOT indicated the main purpose
would be to create confusion and disruption.

In regard to the proposal, EDELBERTO DIAZ
ALVAREZ and HERIBERTO RODRIGUEZ went to Cuba on December 1,
1960, Sr consulatation with the appropriate officials
concerning this matter.

On December 30, 1960, MM T=-2 informed that
DIAZ and RODRIGUEZ, returned from Cuba on December 5
1960. Upon their return they said the acts of sabotage
and terrorism would not be conducted, as Cuban officials
had decided against the proposal.

MM T-2 informed on December 2, 1960, that
on that date MANUEL GUILLOT met with tugopnidentified
Cubans at the home of PRIMITIVO CONDIS;’ Cuban Consulate
employee, Miami. The two unidentified Cubans allegedly
were highly. plgeed in the Frente Revolucionario
Democratic: ), an anti-CASTRO organization. They
indicated they were subject to arrest in Cuba but would
be willing to turn over to the Cuban Government informa-
tion from the files of the FRD if they were assured a
safe return to Cuba. That night GUILLOT departed for
Cuba for consultations concerning the proposal. He
returned to Miami on December 5, 1960.

Subsequently, the informant learned from
GUILLOT that he did not intend to have any further deal-
ings with the unidentified Cubans, as he did not trust
then. °

On January 3, 1961, diplomatic relations between
the United States and Cuba were broken. The Cuban Consulate,.
Miami, was closed on January 5, 1961, and within a few
days thereafter the following Consulate employees returned

Information received and investigation conducted
at Miami indicates that the following are some of the
persons who may be engaged in intelligence activities on
behalf of the Cuban Government. This is in no way to
convey the impression that the following are the only per-
sons concerning whom allegations have been made of
intelligence activities; however, these are the persons

DE CASTRO in a sworn statement to Immigration
and Naturalization Service (INS), Miami, on November 19,
1960, said he terminated his employment with the Duban
Government on March 13, 1952. He denied ever having
been a member of the Commnist Party or any organization
associated with the Commmist Party. He denied that he
had ever been employed by the present Cuban Government
in any capacity or that he had gathered information
in the United States regarding counterrevolutionary
activities and transmitted information to the present
Cuban Government by any means. He said he considers the
present Cuban Government communistic and claimed he
would not go to Cuba while FIDEL CASTRO is in power.

AMAURY GAUDERICIO TROYANO BARBAN, former
major in the Cuban Rebel Army and ex-chief of the Santa
Clara Branch of G-2 in February, 1959, and an acquaintance
of DE CASTRO for about 20 years, said in January, 1961,
he had not seen G-2 credentials for DE CASTRO but did
see credentials of the Cuban Bureau of Naval Intelligence
for DE CASTRO. He said DE CASTRO told him in early 1959
that he was working for the Bureau of Naval Intelligence
in Miami. . :

B. LIDIA FERREIRO cb0">

January 19, 1961, RICARDO FELIX PORTUONDO
PORTUONDO £*2131 Southwest 4th Avenue, Miami, informed
that LIDIA FERREIRO has recently been seen by him in
Miami... He’ said FERREIRO was very active in the Cuban
revolution and was one of FIDEL CASTRO's closest
associates both during the fighting and after he assumed
power, She was active in the CASTRO Government from the
beginning of that regime and PORTUONDO said it would be
extremely hard to believe that she has now defected
from CASTRO.
; - 10 -

NW 64954 Docld:34517503 Page 12


MM 105-1998

FERREIRO was described as about 35 years" old,
5° 6", fat, medium-dark complexion, black hair, brown
eyes, and single. She is from Santiago de Cuba but
moved to Havana with CASTRO and for a time took care
of FIDEL, JR. in Havana.

On January 19, 1961, AMELIA CUBRIA RAMOS,
70 Southwest 2nd Street, Miami, informed that she knows
FERREIRO is in Miami and has seen her several times.
She said FERREIRO was very close to FIDEL CASTRO,
both during the revolution and after he assumed
centrol of the government. She said it would be naive
te believe that FERREIRO kas actually defected. » She
said she does not know what FERREIRO'’s reason is for
being in the United States but she suspects she is here
on behalf of CASTRO.

PORTUONDO furnished FERREIRO's address in
Miami as 1880 Southwest 11th Street, telephone HI 4-0315.

MM T-3 imformed on January 19, 1961, that
’ LIDIA FERREIRO, a Cuban woman, was active in July 26
movement actiyLlties in New York City, around 1957;
however, she held no official position. In the latter
part of 1957 or early part of 1958, she disappeared
from New York.

In April, 1959, when FIDEL CASTRO returned to
New York City for a visit, after ascending to power in
Cuba, LIDIA FERREIRO preceded him by three or four days
and made preparations for his arrival. FERREIRO stayed
in the same hotel as CASTRO at that time, and eae up
women for FIDEL CASTRO to sleep with,"

While in New York City there was a cultural
entertainment fund raising event and approximtely
$12,000. was raised. FERREIRO stole approximately
_ $2, 900. of the money and ainrwuionea that FIDEL CASTRO

would not care as CASTRO "...trusted her so much." When
CASTRO returned to Cuba, FERREIRO returned at the same
time.

FERREIRO is described as a woman of very loose
morals. Her position in Cuba is unknown; however, she
undoubtedly held a high position because of her close
association with FIDEL CASTRO, When FERREIRO was
in New York City in April, 1959, she remarked that
prior to the revolt, she had been in the Sierra Maestra
Mountains fighting with CASTRO.

©. HECTOR RICARDO GARCIA soroo™

GARCIA continues to reside at 1942 Northwest
33rd Street, Miami, and has been unemployed since the
Cuban Consulate at Miami closed on January 5, 1961.
Prior to that time, he was Cuban Air Attache in Miami.

On November 30, 1960, INS, Miami, informed
that official notification had been received from
INS headquarters that the A-2 Visa, which had been issued
to GARCIA, had been cancelled by the U.S. Department
of State. As a result, GARCIA was in the United States
without a visa. GARCIA was given an exclusion hearing
by INS on November 30, 1960, and was excluded from the
United States. GARCIA's attorney filed an appeal to
the exclusion order.-

On December 3, 1960, INS informed that GARCIA's
appeal to the exclusion order had been denied. When -

. GARCIA was told of this, he received political asylum

in the United States, stating he had broken with the
Cuban Government on December 2, 1960.

INS, Miami, informed on January 6, 1961, that
they had received instructions from Central Office of
INS to grant GARCIA political exile in the United
States.

GARCIA was interviewed on January 9, 1961.
He said he had defected from the Cuban Government
and had been granted political exile in the United
States. He said the Cuban Government was not aware of
his defection; therefore, the former Consul in Miami
had left the key to the Consulate with him and had
given him the responsibility of shipping the documents,
papers and material from the Consulate to Cuba. GARCIA
offered to make this material available to the FBI.

GARCIA was questioned about the reason for
his defection and he was vague in his answers. He said
he did not want to go back to Cuba but he admitted
that he was still trugted by the Cuban Government, even
to the extent that they would turn over the papers
of the Consulate to him. GARCIA was also questioned
about intelligence activities in the United States
and the identities of persons operating as intelligence
agents in this country. By his answers, GARCIA made
it clear that he was not willing to give any specific
information of this nature. He was not willing to name
names and discuss specific intelligence activities.

RAMIREZ stated that his purpose in coming to
the Federal Bureau of Investigation was to discuss a
proposition made to him by HECTOR GARCIA SOTO, "ASESOR"
of the Cuban Government in Miami. OSCAR stated that -
HECTOR is the Air Attache for the Cuban Government,
but in reality is part of the MRP and last night came
to ‘see OSCAR, telling OSCAR RAMIREZ that he was going
to leave the Cuban Government but prior to his going,
he wafited to sell ten planes ~ North American T-28A,
which are still here in Miami, and which were purchased
by the BATISTA Government in 1958.

GARCIA explained to RAMIREZ that he has the
authority as part of his job to dispose of the air-
planes, and he wants to sell them to RAMIREZ for one
dollar each, after which the planes will be resold and
the proceeds used to help the MRP, and HECTOR will .
openly defect and assist in the MRP.
