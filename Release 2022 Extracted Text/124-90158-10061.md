and informant's involvement in these activities could
conceivably leave the impression with CIS that informant

is concealing this information from them. (uaces}3) herefore,
felt it would certainly be appropriate to include a reference
to MASFERRER's activities, if possible, in any message to his
mail drop in Cuba. j LGA

The following is th roposed message to be written
by informant} ce the mail drop in Cuba,
-Pollowing instructio: previously issued byfinformant' ‘uban,

(urcngfevisea he could give on+the-spot approval of
CIA to se the above communication since it is general and
contains only an implication of CIA information in informant's
possession. & (X) we

attempt during his next meet to subtly elicit from his case of-
ficer an instruction that informant write an account of his
former association with CIA. AL 7A

t is recognized that if the above message is sent,
informantj{must be prepared to reveal details of the plan of

a discussion with STANLEY S, SCHACHTER, Enforcement Agent,

U. S, Customs, Miami, who is handling the MASFERRER case,
relative to the propriety of revealing complete information
regarding MASFERRER's plan to Cuba at this time. SCHACHTER

} advised he could foresee no difficulties or objections on the

: part of Customs to the furnishing of full, information regarding
‘ MASFERRER's activities to the CIS by an[tnfornant of this of-

i fice, {S/SCHACHTER was also of the opinion’ that Cuba was no doubt
f already aware of MASFERRER's activities inasmuch as most

active Cuban exiles in Miami know of his plan. SCHACHTER said
she-feIt this procedure would in no way interfere with Customs
investigation in this case. a)
