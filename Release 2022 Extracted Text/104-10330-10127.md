Re: JFK.Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992
Dear Mr. Tunheim:

This will respond to your 14 September 1998 letter regarding
Central Intelligence Agency compliance with the “JFK Act.”

I have no doubt whatsoever that the CIA has fully met its
obligations to locate, review, and release “assassination
records" as defined in the JFK Act. The Agency’s 2 September
1998 Declaration of Compliance-signed, as you note, by CIA's
Director of Information Management, Edmund Cohen—confirms my
judgment. I have full confidence in the scope of the Agency‘s
searches as described in Mr. Cohen‘s recent declaration.

As Director of Information Management, Mr. Cohen is directly
responsible for CIA’s records systems and for ensuring the
adequacy of CIA’s search, review, and release of documents under
the JFK Act. Mr. Cohen signed the Agency's Declaration of
Compliance because he was the most senior Agency official with
direct personal knowledge that its statements weré accurate and
complete. There was no more appropriate signatpry.

In sum, I understand that the appropriate CIA staff officers
have worked diligently to locate and disclose to the JFK Board
all relevant records in the Agency’s possession and that they do
not believe any other relevant records are being withheld from
the Board. Mr. Cohen’s declaration confirms my understanding.

I trust that this will meet your requirements.

Sincerely,



Mr. John
