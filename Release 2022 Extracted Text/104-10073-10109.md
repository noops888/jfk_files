LAUDjoGle have never discussed about people fredriran.

(ALEX, O6 Because we had no idea how to contact then.

06 BAUD:) Yes, and also, because this was supposed to be a small meeting.

ob CALEX, Now 1t's smaller than small.

06 (MAUD:) Yes.

O6 (ALEX:) There is a possibility to have a representative of the Austrial Centra

Urganizations of Trade Unions. I have friends fron Austria and I think

(Maud) and Alex)exchange several conments--ca.:.

:06 (Bertil) leaves for Parliament.

o6. (ALEX:) ... (something about Hungary, DDR)... Why do you resist every idea I

u6 (MAUD:) No, but this has to be agreed upon if they send you. I have never ev

imagined that somebody would be available from Austria.

06 (ALEX:)

OlCHAUD: For instance, here you mention HAROLD (or Hal or Al??) GIBBONS (ph),

International Teamsters-- As far as I know, this is JIM HOFFA's trade union.

O6 (ALEX:) JIM?

06 (MAUD: A real gangster trade union.

06 CALEX:) I don't think so.

06 (MAUD:) Vell, it 1s. Haven't you seen that film 'On the Waterfront'? It's mi

up with the Mafia..

06 CaLEX: No, they are very decent people.

06 (MAUD:) Perhaps this HAROLD GIBBONS (ph) --although I think Ive seen that nane

somewhere and not on our side--because this is the most gangsteric trade unio

in the U.S.

06 (ALEX:) I like gangsters.. (Back and forth on this. Then on a more serious fr

06 (Maud)getting fed up with hearing that (ALS) wants. a( Swedish) trade unionist to

send out personal inviations to this Prep Meeting.)

06 CALEX: CURTIS HICLEAN.

_06 (MUD Hell, anybody fron the ILWU (International Longshorenen's and larehous.

Union, although your Big BORIS (AVERYANOV) didn't believe for a minute that

somabody from there would come.

06 (ALEX: But here CURTIS NCLEAN, did he participate in the Sixth Conference?

06. (AUD:) Yes.

06 (ALEX:) Why didn't he core for the special

d6 (IAUD:). Because your Big BORIS soid that this 1s

exactly the trade union--their

people--who are building the ships for Vietnan and if the war stops they will

be unemployed end therefore in Rib

Et period said nothing about indochina.
