really know all of this in detail.

Mr. Kelley. Do you know who Aprile was?

Mr. Helms. He was a Cuban exile leader, is the best

definition to give to ARIME

Mr. Kelley. I am told by a member of our staff who

reviewed these documents in their unsanitized forms that

was ARTIME

that I-1 was AMLASH, and that the case

officers whom they have questioned about these documents -

Mr. Helms.

Wasn't Anna also a member of the Cuban

Pigs.

Mr. Kelley. He was very heavily involved in the Bay of

INT MISH

L-1 was AMLASH in the period '64-'65,

and the case officers who were invölved in these documents

have testified, they say, that Desmond Fitzgerald knew all

about what they were doing, that he was informed that they

were trying to put AMLASH in touch with our teammate in order

to effect AMLASH's goal of assassinating Castro, and that

the case was a very big one, at least in their view of what

the DDP Directorate was doing at the time.

Mr. Helms. Who said Fitzgerald knew all of these things?

Mr. Kelley. The case officers that they were working

for Fitzgerald.

Now my question is did you know what Fitzgerald was

doing? Did Fitzgerald report to you what he and his case

officers were doing with respect to AMLASH?

this case,. I think, two of them out in Europe some place,

handling an asset -- and just how often you put your finger

into the pie, if at all, other than getting yourself routinely

briefed by one of your trusted --

MI. Helms. It would be the latter. Fitzgerald would be

the man who would report to me and tell me what was going on.

Get what authorizations he needed for me, bring me whatever

papers had to be signed in order to carry on his work. Obviously

minutes of 303 Committee meetings would come to me with

regard to participating, whether I did or didn't.

In other words, I would keep in the policy line there.

But the actual operational details, day to day, would " n

be handled by Fitzgerald and his people in these various

stations, Miami, Madrid, and so forth. They would come into

him in Washington.

What telegrams going back and forth I would see of would

not see, I would not have every single telegram there to

find out, but this was generally, he reported to me. I didn't

go down and talk to individual case officers about these.

Mr. Kirbow. One other question.

Mr. Helms. Except on rare occasions.

Mr. Kirbow. Sure.

After Desmond Fitzgerald returned from his trip to meet

with AMLASH, hoding himself forth, apparently properly to be

a representative of the United States government, do you recall

hopes to return Tuesday: 15 December. 1-1 mill debrief

him

as soon

as he

the meeting with

L-1 may meet with B-1

with

but is not prepared to meet with him until after

he talks

h- 2

and finds out the details of the arrangements. L-l is

also concerned over his own security and that of the people inside

Cuba whom he would

be committing once he ties

in with

B-1.

3. Our official line to take with regard to B-l is that he

is operating from outside the United States, is doing what he can

for his country, and is highly thought of.

Although we would like

to see B-1 and

L-1 get together, we do not want to be the brokers

in the union.

with L-1 line of thinking regarding solution in Cuba and is the

reason he would like to join forces.

B-1 does not know and

we do

not plan to tell

him that we are in

direct contact with L-1

nor

does

L-1 know and we do not desire he know that we are in' direct

contact with B-1.

4. L-l was told and fully understands that the United States

Government cannot become involved to any degree in the

"first step"

of his plan. If he needs support, he realizes he will have to get

it elsewhere. FYI: This is where B-1 could fit in nicely in

giving any support he would request.

also from the 26th of July. The latter is opposed to the

regine, but a prerequisite to joining in the coup is the

clinination of Castro.

The following officers are nenbers of

this group:

Coates.

sergio del Valle, Chief of Staff of the

Cuban Arry; Autonio lusson y Patlio; Guillermo Garcia Frias,

Commander of the liestern Army: and Victor Bordon lachadg, Chief

of artillery, Festers Army.

L -I was not too lauditory

concerning this group. He

feels they want to reap the fruit

regarding Aneljeiras, be clairs that be bas the courage and

determination to proceed with what has to be done under any

B =l asked the folloving question of

L -1:

If Fidal Castro should be eliminated, what officers would?

join a group taich would oppose the Conmunist Party, laul

Castro, Che Guevara and conpany.

L-1 mentioned Sergio del

Valle.

clains that he has already talked to del Valle

opinion, the following would also

Juan Alnelda Sosque, Colarmina Castilla las and Fodro iret.

Another man who nay

also join then ig "31 Gallego" fernandez,

but he has no troops with him.

The troops are very nuch

opposed to him because he was

a nonber of Batista's old army.

He was then made a comandante in the new rebel aruy.

L→1

feels that Cmate. Manuel Cospedes fernandez, the deputy connander

of the fastern Army

1n Oriente, will probably Join an anti-

Communist group.

nayy will also join then although he has not bad direct contact

with these people.

He is sure of this because ridel at every
