PROJEC'S BRIEFING

PROJECT: LIEMPTY

WH - Mexioo City

ACTION :

ADD/P approval of renewal

1 Dec 64. - 30 NOv 65

PURPOSE:

covered the orate and come surellance

PROGRESS:

One basehouse (LIMITED), which provided coverage of the

nain gate of the Embassy, was evacuated in September 196

because of security implications stemming from release o1

the Warren Commission Report.

The future of this

property has not yet been determined but the Station has

• acquired another

the

apartment on a temporary

basis to replace

LIMITED coverage.

The Division believes that three

photo basehouses directed against the Soviet compound are '

justified as well as the mobile coverage provides by

LILNTIP.

During the past year two indigenous employees

were terminated in the interest of economy.

During the

coming year Oliver G. SCANTLING (p), contract agent, 13

expected to assume other duties

and

responsibilitles not

connected with this project.

Therefore,

salary and

expenses are requested for only six months.

During a

nine month period the project produced 770 rolls of

operational still photographs, of which 595 were con-

cerned directly with the Embassy copound. Based on the

performance and overall contributions of the project

during the past year, the Station concludes that the

project is essential to the fulfillment of the RMD and

should be continued in the coming year.

COMMENTS:

FI, CI and Central Cover Staffs concur in approval.

FI STAFP: Commends the Station's success in re-

ducing expenses and maintaining its effectiveness.

Suggests that use of LIMITED installation as a

radio basehouse from which surveillance teams were

dispatched may have been a security target.

Staff suggents that the Station pursue the problem
