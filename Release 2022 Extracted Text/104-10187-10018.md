PROJECT BRIEFING

PROJECT: LIEMPTY WH - Mexico City

“ACTION + AbD/P approval of renewal 1 Dec 64.- 30 Nov 65

PURPOSE: To provide photographic and physical surveillance
coverage of the Soviet Embassy compound.

PROGRESS: One basehouse (LIMITED), which provided coverage of the
main gate of the Embassy, was evacuated in September 1964
because of security implications stemming from release of
the Warren Commission Report. The future of this
property has not yet been determined but the Station has

* acquired another apartment on a temporary basis to replace
the LIMITED coverage. The Division believes that three
photo basehouses directed against the Soviet compound are’
Justified as well as the mobile coverage provided by
LICNTRAP, During the past year two indigenous employees
were terminated in the interest of economy. During the
coming year Oliver G. SCANTLING (p), contract agent, is
expected to assume other duties and responsibilities not
connected with this project. Therefore, salary and
expenses are requested for only six months. During a
nine month period the project produced 770 rolls of
operational still photographs, of which 595 were con-
cerned directly with the Embassy compound. Based on the
performance and overall contributions of the project
during the past year, the Station concludes that the
project 1s essential to the fulfillment of the RMD and
should be continued in the coming year.

FI, CI and Central Cover Staffs concur in approval.

FI STAFF: Commends the Station's success in re-
ducing expenses and maintaining its effectiveness.
Suggests that use of LIMITED installation as a
radio basehouse from.which surveillance teams were
dispatched may have been a security target. FI
Staff suggests that the Station pursue the problem
with Office of Communications: personnel.
