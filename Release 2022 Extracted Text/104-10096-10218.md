On Friday, 25 January 1952, the writer was called to tha office

of Mr. Bannernan for tas purposa of a conference with one lix. Pricisett

EE/OPG, concerning the instant case.

Mr. Prichett)explaiced in substance the Kelly case as follows:

Kelly, (whose real nane is Dinitrov), is a 29-year-old Bulgarian and

was tke head of a snall political party based in Greece and ostansitaly

workdog for Bulgarian independance.

as being young, anbitious, bright (elementary college education), a

sort aí a "man-on-a-horsg" type but a typical Balkan politician. Ac-

03 cording to Prichett, our people discovered that Franch Intelligans

Service Word attempting to bribe Kelly and make him a double agent and

ely was codeing with layor upon the French offers.

Lot was regged in which felly was told he was going to be sange

and as a "protaction", he was placed in custody of the Greek Police

who threw keily into a Greek prison. Kelly was held in tha Greek pri-

son for six montas until the Greek authorities decided that Kelly was

a nuisance and they tald our people to take him back. Since our

people were unable to dispose of Kelly in Greace, they fles hin to

Panana where, through arrangement, he was placed in a U.S. Military

Hospital as a psychopathic patient. Kelly now has been in the U.s..

military hospital for several montes and the hospital authorities now

want to get him out since he is causing considerable trouble, bothering.

other patients, etc. Kelly is not a psychopathic personality.

Prichete explained that they can dispose of Kelly by tha simple

procass or sending him to a friend of his in Caracas, Venezuela, and

as far as they are concerned, that type of disposal is perfectly o.k.

However, because of his confinement in a Greek prison and his stay in

a military hospital, Kelly has become vary hostile toward the United

States and our intelligence operations in particular.

Hence, OPC is

considaring an "Artichoke" approach to Kelly to see if it would be

possible to re-orient Kelly favorably toward is. This operation, which

operation presumably at the military hospital in Fanama…. Also in-

volved in this would be a Bulgarian intarpreter who is a consultant

to this Agency since neither Icko) nor Gladyck] speak Bulgarian.

Mr. Bannerman pointed out to richet! that this type of operation

could only be carried out with the authorization of Fecurity and that,

under no circumstances whatsoever, could anyone but an authorized M.D.

is one i which Security hardlas Lis agen.

It was agreed between Prichett, Bannerman,- and the writer that a

conference would ba laid on Morday altarnoon when OPC representatives

and the Bulgarian interprater retura fron Boston and their tale with

hoo would be lorrarded to our people in Panama directing. them to

the Army would allow tha Agency to have the use of the racessary roma,

medical facilitias, eta. as sould be required for this type of operation

At this time, ait was also to ba determined whather the disposal of Kelly to

Venesuela could in fact be laid on.

Comment:

This particular operation was mentioned in general terms to the

writer by Mr-Waltar Driscoll] approximately thirty days ago on an in-

formal basis but no significant details wers given at this tine.

While the tachnique that Beka) and Gladyal are considering for use

In this cass is not known to the writar, the writer beliaves the approach

will be made through tha standard zarco-hypnosis techniqua. Re-conditioning

and re-orienting an individual in such a matter, in the opinion of tis

writer, cannot be accomplished easily and will require a great deal of

time and the t fact that an intarprater is necessary in the case con-

plicates it considerably more.

It is also believed that with our present i

mowleuge, we would have no absolute guarantee that the subject in this

case would maintain a positive friendly attitude toward us even though

thare is apparanily a successiul response to the treatment. the writer

aid not suggest to

Prichett that perhaps a total amnesia could be created

by a series of electro shocks, but merely indicated that amnesias under

drug treatments were not certain.
