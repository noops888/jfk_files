1.

On 9 June 1969 "Dan" of the DDO Guatemala Desk (x9041)

contacted Staft and Operations Branch/Operational Evaluatio

section for information concerning Gerald Patrick HEMMING.

"Dan" was referred to the writer, who is holding the HEMMING

file.

When "Dan" contacted the writer, "Dan" advised that he

is the action officer for a cable from

the Guatemala Station] 16-2

reporting an assassination plot on the life of President

LAUGERUD of Guatemala.

"Dan" was unfamiliar with the case of

Gerald Patrick HEMMING and had not as yet reviewed the 201 file

on HEMMING.

"Dan" was

requested to alert CI Staff and JMWAVE

to the below-mentioned cable and to provide the writer with a

copy of the report coming in from the Guatemala Station. 16-2

"Dan" provided the writer with a copy of the cable

(IN 944357, Cite Guatemala City, 19536, dated 8 June 1970),

which is attached.

circa

8 June 1976 a Guatemalan source, with the knowledge of

Guatemalan President LAUGERUD, provided the Guatemala Station /b-2

a written report, and a detailed briefing,

concerning a plot

to assassinate President LAUGERUD.

According to the informa-

tion the plot was to have been carried out on 15 September

Jorge Antonio

of an attack upon his, ZIMERI's, life. ZIMERI has been living

in Miami since August 1975.

Movement was involved with ZIMERI

in the assassination plot

and ZIMERI in turn was involved with two Americans, brothers,

Robert and Gerald Patrick HEMMING. The HEMMING brothers

assisted ZIMERI in acquiring arms, among other things,

which

were flown to Guatemala in a small aircraft.

The report also

claims that ZIMERI has close relations with police officials

co purchase arms and ammunition for

shipment to Guatemala?

e.

Any information on Robert and Gerald

HEMMING?

Gerald Patrick HEMMING is well known to this Agency,

mad ate Agenty arration when in ence there inno

none.

The most recent incident wherein HEMMING claimed such

affiliation was in May 1975 when he volunteered his services

May 195 no he oh

to the Drug Enforcement Administration.

Gerald Patrick HEMMING

is a long-time cohort of Frank Anthony STURGIS (SF#353 459),

aka:

Frank FIORINI, of Watergate notoriety who also has a

long-time record of

falsely claiming Agency affiliation.

the late 1950's HEMMING and STURGIS, both former U.S. Marines,

joined Fidel CASTRO in Cuba but returned shortly thereafter

claiming disillusionment with the CASTRO cause.

Soon thereafter,

STURGIS organized a group of mercenaries for Caribbean and

Central American activities which he named the International

Anti-Communist Brigade.

A reported sub-unit of this "Brigade"

(the backers of whom have never been fully established) was

named the Intercontinental Penetration Force, headed by Gerald

Patrick HEMMING.

For an appreciation of the possible ramifications of

a Guatemalan government expose of this assassination plot

involving HEMMING, you are referred to attachments to instant

memorandum, to wit:

a memorandum by the writer dated 10 June

1975 in the name of Frank STURGIS and Everett Howard HUNT, Jr.;

and an extract from a book published in early 1976 written by

Michael CANFIELD and Alan J. WEBERMAN.

The book Coup d'etat

in America--The CIA and the Assassination of John F. Kennedy

is a diatribe against the Agency and attempts to link the Agency

with the assassination of President KENNEDY.

One of the major

links attempted by the authors is through Everett Howard HUNT,

Jr. to Frank STURGIS to Gerald Patrick HEMMING to Loran Eugene

HALL.

Loran Eugene HALL was a member of HEMMING's Interconti-

nental Penetration Force.

Loran Eugene HALL received nationwide

publicity in 1967 when New Orleans District Attorney "Jim"

GARRISON alleged that HALL (and the Intercontinental Penetration

Force) was involved in the assassination of President KENNEDY

and that members of this unit were connected with CIA.

shortly thereafter dropped his interest in HALL, but it is

interesting that he did so after Gerald Patrick

HEMMING and

another cohort, Robert K. BROWN, joined GARRISON's investigation.
