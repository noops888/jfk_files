S. Our relationship with cover providers wold
jeopardized if it became publicly known that they wére very well

raise objections to our future use of cover
importance to the Agency at this time is the critical use of

private sector (nonofficial) cover providers. ie private sector
would no doubt drop contact and avoid future deAlings with us id
we reveal a covert relationship. Identifying fgovert

relationships with cover providers would paraVyze Agency
operations which in turn could severely damage national security.
In addition, in the past it has exposed CIA fo legal liabilities|
and substantial monetary damages,

6. Headquarters Regulation (HR) 2407/1 is the Agency's
regulation on cover. It states that “cover is required for all
Agency operations, activities and instalfations abroad, including
personnel in PCS or TDY status.” HR 240-2, the Agency's
regulation on cover after separation, ¢

© Agency will be based upon
ert status could result in
damage to the national security by ¢ompromising intelligence

sources, methods, activities, and/dr information, or cause harm
to foreign relations. This dete wination will be made on a case-
by-case basis.” Please note tha

7. Release of names of former employees who separated under
cover will make the entire Agency cover program vulnerable and
detract from our continuing efforts to enhance cover and conduct
sometimes dangerous activities necessary to carry out the
Agency’s mission. We can accept the purpose of the JFK
Assassination Records Review Act to declassify documents for
public consumption; however, we submit that the release of true
names of former Agency employees adds no value to the documents
in addition to risking physical harm to these individuals from
our public detractors. We propose and emphatically encourage
that pseudonyms, aliases or generic job descriptions such as desk
officer be used in place of true names which would not diminish
the impact of the documents.
