the data published is accurate; wethec the data

published was classified properly: whether the date

can be declassified for purposes of prosecution and,

Is so, the name of the person competent to testify

concerning classification; the extent of diesemina-

of the individual responsible for the security of

the classified data published; whether the material,

or portions, thereof, or enough background data had

been published officially or in the press to make

educated speculation on the matter possible; and

whether prior clearance for publication was sought

from proper authoricies. We obtein such daza to

assist the Department in determining whether an

In the light of the specific statutory responsibility

It is the opinion of the Department that while cases

involving leaks of classified defense information should be.

considered primarily matiers to be handled by the agency which

is responsible for safeguarding the information, it remins,

however, the cesponsibility of the Depariment to determine

wether a specific set of facts constitute a violation of our

criminal statutes.

It Is recommended that the responsible department or.

agency be requested to fumish the IBI at the time it reports

the leak to the bureau the same background data as now supplied

.Sp-2.ALM)JTG

In accord with our telephone conversation of August 12th,

I am forwarding to you a letter from the Senate Select

Committee requesting answers to questions relating to

electronic surveillance conducted by the Federal govern-

ment in the interests of national security. The Committee

has been told that we would try to respond

to their

request by August 20th.

That date is fast approaching

and may not be a reasonable period of time in which to

compile the information requested and respond to their

questions.

That date is a useful target, however, since

any issues to be presented to the Attorney General with

respect to complying to this request must be considered

prior to August 19th, the date the Attorney General is

scheduled to leave Washington.

Would your office please prepare responses to the following

questions that involve areas with which, I believe, you

are familiar: questions 2-10, 11(b)-(d), 12, 14, 15, 17,

21 and 24.

Thank you.

Your letters, and the

Further questions

Some of these questions

relate to general

policy considerations in the elcctronic surveillance area;

we can draw our conclusions.

questions is attached to this lotter.

These questions, of

I believe that the answers to these questions

are essential to a complete understanding of the policies

and procedures followed by the Justice Department in elec-

tronic surveillance cases. Full information on these mat-

ters is necessary for the Committee to fulfill its mandate

"to recommend the enactment of any new legislation.

necessary or desirable.to strengthen or clarify the national

security, intelligence, or surveillance activities of the

United States and to protect the rights of United States

citizens with regard to these activities."

With the con-

tinued cooperation of the Justice Department, I am convinced

that the Committee. will be able to discharge this respon-

sibility in the critical area of national security electronic

surveillance.

TOP SECRET

Mr. Chairman, I wish to furnish the Subcommittee

additional details regarding our mail covers and surveys;

however, some of this information enters sensitive areas

involving national security, and I respectfully request it

be presented in executive session.

As I have indicated previously, the FBI's use

of mail covers and surveys as investigative techniques has been

based on fulfilling its lawfully mandated responsibilities.

The list of intelligence accomplishments resulting

from mail covers on foreign establishments alone is long,

but perhaps these examples will suffice:

In February, 1975, a member of the military holding

a "secret" clearance obtained while in training was determined

to be in contact with a foreign establishment.

Also last February, an individual with a "secret"

• clearance employed on a missile project was in such contact.

In November,. 1974, a scientist involved in atomic

research was determined to be in such contact.

We have discovered through mail coverage on the

United Nations Mission of a communist country that a wide

range of individuals and corporations have been in contact

with an official establishment of a foreign country with

which the United States has no diplomatic relations.

TOP SECRET

With reference to our former use of mail survey

programs in which we surveyed

mail

for indicators as to whether

further processing is warranted, permit me to further explain

the

seven programs which I previously outlined in public

testimony:

Of these surveys, one was established in New York

as a result of the experience gained in the investigation

of a Soviet illegal. This illegal cooperated with the FBI;

and we learned that in directing mail to his Moscow center,

he addressed it in a specific fashion and also directed it

to mail drops in Europe.

From this experience, we were able to develop a

set of indicators which allowed us to select mail which we

felt was illegal agent mail. This, coupled with our knowledge

of known Soviet mail drops on this side of the Iron Curtain,

permitted effective screening of the mail and selection of

letters on a knowledgeable basis.

This method was proved successful when we uncovered

three such illegals and successfully neutralized their

activities. This survey was conducted between 1959 and 1966.

A second survey was based on the use of these same

indicators in examining incoming mail directed to certain areas

of New York City and other cities in an effort to detect mail

being directed to illegal agents in the United States. This

survey was conducted between 1961 and 1962.

TRP SECRET

A third survey was based on our knowledge that

illegal agents in the United States directed communications

to Soviet bloc intelligence officers employed at the United

Nations in New York City. Again, this survey was based on

solid information that this means of communication was

utilized by the hostile intelligence service. This survey

was conducted between 1963 and 1966.

A fourth survey was conducted in the Miami, Florida,

area. It also utilized the known indicators and the known

mail drop addresses on mail being sent from the United States

to Cuba. As an example, during the period of time this program

existed in Miami, from January 2, 1963, until July 21, 1966,

60 letters were determined to contain secret ink messages

either on the letter or on the envelope.

Two other surveys were directed against mail being

sent to the United States from the People's Republic of China

and Hong Kong, as well as mail directed from the United States

to China. The coverage of mail from the People's Republic

of China and Hong Kong was initiated August 1, 1956, and was

discontinued on January 24, 1966. The coverage of mail directed

to China operated between 1964 and 1966.

The purpose of these two surveys was to acquire

information concerning Americans living in China of interest

to the intelligence agencies of the United States; to detect

- 3 -

efforts by the People's Republic of China to persuade scientists

of Chinese descent in the United States to return to the

People's Republic of China; to detect efforts to arrange

travel by these scientists and to learn any information they

would provide the People's Republic of China; to ascertain

identities of subscribers to and recipients of Chinese

propaganda publications; and to develop information concerning

persons of security interest in the United States who were

corresponding with persons in the People's Republic of China.

The seventh survey, conducted from 1940 to 1966,

was of mail addressed to Soviet-bloc and other embassies and

diplomatic missions of national security interest.

This program was initiated shortly before the

United States entered World War II and its vital necessity

during those perilous times seems obvious.

Following World War II, the seventh program was

concentrated against the Soviet Union and Soviet-bloc countries,

and much greater selectivity was used in screening letters

to be opened.

We were able, for example, in 1964 to detect

the fact a civilian employee of the United States Navy

offered to sell classified information to the Soviet Embassy

for $50,000.

With regard to the FBI's participation in the CIA

mail interception project, when we were offered data from

-4-

that operation, we initially set forth four specific areas

of data which could be of value to our national security

responsibility:

1. Correspondence of a suspicious nature which

might contain double talk;

2. Correspondence indicating Soviets might be

using a hostage situation to develop sources in the United States.

3. Correspondence indicating a weakness or

dissatisfaction on the part of any Soviet in the United States.

4. Information indicating Soviet control or direction

of the Communist Party, U.S.A.

In August, 1961, we advised the CIA that we were

interested in letters in which the United States addressee

or addressor was a Government employee, working in a

sensitive industry, or an American wishing to defect to

- Russia.

In February, 1962, we established ádditional

guidelines regarding the type of letters for which we had

a requirement to help further our efforts to uncover illegals.

Knowledgeable FBI officials reviewed this data

periodically, and surveys were conducted, to assure that we

were receiving only data pertinent to our legitimate

responsibilities.

Tip

SECRET

The FBI first learned of the CIA mail intercept

project from a CIA official in January, 1958. The official

confidentially advised our liaison Agent that CIA had an

operation in New York in which mail going to, and coming

from, Russia was being examined by CIA.

We were advised the project had been furnishing

valuable economic and political information in Russia as

well as the identities of sources and potential defectors

in Russia.

The CIA operation presented excellent potential

for uncovering Soviet espionage operations in this country.

On January 24, 1958, our liaison Agent was told by

CIA representatives that the CIA had initiated negotiations

with the Post Office in 1952, and finally had worked out

arrangements for this project, with the approval of Postmaster

General Arthur E. Summerfield.

Our understanding was that under that arrangement

CIA would be permitted to initiate mail cover on mail going

to and from Russia.

The CIA coverage first involved merely photographing

the envelopes, and later resulted in the opening of mail.

CIA told us it had acquired considerable data of

foreign intelligence value. CIA

also indicated a willingness

to handle leads for the FBI regarding matters within our .

national security responsibilities.

It was recommended, and approved by Director Hoover,

that we ask CIA to advise us of any product of their operation

that would be valuable to us in discharging our national

security responsibilities. Once the receipt of material

began it was reviewed by knowledgeable Bureau officials to

assure the information was pertinent to our responsibilities

and justified our continuing to receive such information.

Our interest was in detecting foreign espionage

agents and individuals in a position to do harm to our

national security and indicating willingness to do so.

In August, 1961, we further clarified for CIA

the scope of our interest.

This was to assure no material

not relevant to our responsibilities was. furnished to us.

In February, 1973, the FBI was approached regarding

taking over this CIA mail intercept project. We did not, and

in May, 1973, we received the last data from this CIA operation.

In summary, our relationship with this CIA project

extended from 1958 to May, 1973. We have no figures for the

number.of items we received during the initial stages of that

operation; however, beginning in August, 1964, we began

preparing summaries of items received.

The full-year count ranged from a low of 1,353 in

1972 to a high of 6,256 items in 1967.

Legal basis for mail covers

The FBI utilizes mail covers as an investigative

technique in accordance with requirements set down by

law and the Postal Service.

Procedures for obtaining

mail covers are precisely set out in the Postal Manual,

Section 861.

The legality of mail covers has been substantiated

by a number of court decisions, beginning with Mr. Justice

Field's statement in Ex parte Jackson (1877); recognition

of this view through Oliver v. United States (1957) ; United

States v. Costello (1958); United States v. Schwartz (1960) ;

Cohen v. United States

(1967); Lustiger V. United States (1968) ;

United States v. Isaacs (1972); cert. denied 417 U.S. 976 (1974) .

History of Utilization by FBI of mail covers

The FBI has utilized mail covers allowed by the

U. S. Post Office Department and subsequently the Postal

Service as early as 1928. FBI procedures have been in

accordance with Post Office policies and procedures in

effect at a particular time.

From 1928 to 1945, Special Agents in Charge of

respective field offices were authorized to request a mail

cover from the appropriate Post Office official in their

respective territories. In 1945, the FBI policy was changed

to allow the SACs this authority only in cases involving

deserters, fugitives and escaped Federal prisoners. All

Tep SECRET

UNW 65360 Docld:32989634 Page 99

## Page 100

other cases

required FBI Headquarters approval. In 1947,

the FBI's policy was returned to the pre-1945 rule and

SACs were again permitted to request authority from the

Post Office without approval of FBI Headguarters. In 1954,

however, regulations were instituted whereby all mail covers

were to be limited to thirty days and justified to Headquarters

prior to being requested. This policy of final determination

by FBI Headquarters is in effect today.

Current statistics of mail covers utilization by FBI

As of June 17, 1975, current mail covers requested

or in place totaled 129. They were as follows: National

security - 69; Fugitive - 59; Criminal - 1.

The number of mail covers represents a minute

fraction of the total number of investigations pending on

a daily basis.

Authorization procedures consistent with Postal regulations

The FBI follows the procedures for obtaining mail

covers set out in the Postal Manual, Section 861. Inasmuch

as the FBI fits the "law enforcement agency" definition in

the Manual, we make our requests to the Chief Postal Inspector

or the Regional Postal Inspectors in Charge, depending on

the type of mail cover requested.

No level of authorization in the requesting agency

is specified in the Postal Manual. However, as indicated

i SCARET

2 -

NW 65360 Docld:32989634 Page 100

---

## Page 101

SECRET

above, present FBI regulations require that mail cover

requests must be first cleared through FBI Headquarters

for approval.

FBI Headquarters screens the request to insure

that the mail cover can be potentially productive and that

the nature of the case is of sufficient import to justify

the technique. These decisions are made upon justification

from the field office, review by Headquarters' supervisory

personnel, with final decision resting at the Deputy Associate

Director level or above.

Benefits achieved by mail covers

Mail covers have proved to be valuable as an

investigative technique in certain investigations. For example,

mail covers have led to the identification of individuals

holding security clearances who contact hostile intelligence

services and who have provided intelligence information of

interest to the hostile foreign intelligence services.

Over the years mail covers have provided leads

which have resulted in the location of fugitives.

In

criminal cases, mail covers have provided information that

has led to the discovery of evidence of criminal violations.

Purpose of mail covers

Lawful mail covers as an investigative technique are

based on the premise that discovery of an individual's

contacts provides knowledge of the individual's actions,

SECRET

3

NW 65360 Docld:32989634 Page 101

---

## Page 102

TRAP SECRET

as well as indicates other avenues by which knowledge of

the individual can be obtained.

Objectives, of course, vary depending on the

type of investigation involved. For example, in fugitive

cases, mail covers may be used in instances when the

fugitive's close associates or relatives are obviously

hostile or suspected of being so.

When official contact

by law enforcement with these persons is rebuffed or

impractical, mail covers are often useful.

In selected situations where a crime has been

committed or an attempt made to do so, mail covers can

be used to identify participants or co-conspirators and

provide leads in investigations.

In national security matters, the insight provided

by mail covers is invaluable. The FBI's successful fulfillment

of its national security role rests largely in determining

the activities of hostile intelligence services. The mails

are obviously a means of communication which allows a

foreign intelligence service accessibility to persons or

places from which they would otherwise be prohibited by

law or where their physical presence would be suspect and

thereby negate a covert effort on their part. Knowledge of

their mail contacts can open avenues of lawful investigation

which can be most productive.

TAP JOSCRET

The FBI has conducted seven mail survey programs

solely in the discharge of its national security responsibilities.

None has been conducted since 1966.

These surveys were instituted because of their

potential value in discharging the FBI's responsibilities

in the national security field.

These surveys were conducted to detect and identify

foreign agents who threaten this Nation's security and to

detect other persons who indicated willingness, and were

in a position, to sell out this country to hostile foreign

powers. Each survey program was carefully circumscribed

as to its scope and was conducted for specific objectives

with strict administrative controls.

These surveys involved the processing, or opening,

of mail; but they did not involve wholesale, indiscriminate

opening of mail. In these surveys we were looking for

indicators as to whether review of the correspondence might

lead to the detection of an illegal foreign agent or a

person cooperating with a hostile foreign power. Although

considerable volumes of envelopes were surveyed, the vast

majority of this mail was not further processed because it

did not contain indicators which would make it relevant to

the survey•

U. S. SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON

INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC) ;

INTERVIEW OF SUPERVISOR RICHARD H. BLOESER

BY SSC STAFF MEMBER

On August-5-p1975,

Supervisor Richara H. Bloeser

was interviewed by SSC Staff Member Lester Seidel at the

Los Angeles FBI Office regarding the COINTELPRO/Black Panther

Party (BPP).

Mr. Seidel advised Supervisor Bloeser that the

interview was voluntary, but did not advise Supervisor

Bloeser of his rights in this matter.

Mr. Seidel inquired of

Supervisor Bloeser as to

how many offices he had served in, his length of service in

the Bureau, and how long had been spent on intelligence

investigations.

Supervisor Bloeser replied that he had

served in Philadelphia, El Paso and Los Angeles, had been.

in the Bureau approximately 24k years, and had been assigned

to intelligence work for 22 years.

Mr. Seidel inquired as to whether Supervisor Bloeser

believed that the Bureau had placeâ undue pressure on the

-=

field to come up with counter intelligence proposals concerning

the BPP and was it difficult to come up. with a proposal.

Supervisor Bloeser responded that there was no undue pressure

I w? placed of the field by the Bureau, that the COINTELPRO/BPP

r.s.ca

was merely another case assigned to an agent and that agent,

as in any other case, had the responsibility of handling the

matter whether it concemed the solving of a case of the

submission of proposals. Mr. Seidel was also informed that

it was not unduly difficult to come up with a proposal and that

a number of proposals were rejected at the field level and

never submitted to the Bureau.

Mr. Seidel inquired specifically as to counter

intelligence proposals involving cartoons ridiculing the BPP.

This document contains neither recommendations nor conclusions

of the FBI.

U. S. SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON

INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC) ;

INTERVIEW OF SUPERVISOR RICHARD H. BLOESER

BY SSC STAFF MEMBER •

Supervisor Bloeser responded that he vaguely remembered such

proposals but without reviewing the file had no definite

recollection: Mr. Seidel did not request that the file be

reviewed.

Mr. Seidel inquired specifically about a business

card which allegedly had been prepared by the Bureau bearing

the phrase "Kaxenga is impotent." Mr. Seidel requested

Supervisor Bloeser's views on the distribution of this card

by the FBI. Supervisor Bloeser responded that he vaguely

remembered the card, that he thought it was humorous, and

that the word impotent had various meanings.

Mr. Seidel then inquired about the blood feud

which existed in the past between the US Organization and

the BPP and the efforts of the Bureau to keep this feud

alive and thus promote violence. He specifically inquired

as to the personal feelings of Supervisor Bloeser concerning

any counter intelligence proposals which, if placed in

operation, could lead to violence between the two groups.

Supervisor Bloeser responded first that personally

he had no apologies for the counter intelligence program as

a whole, that proposals submitted six or seven years ago

were believed necessary at that time due to the circumstances,

specifically that at that time the BPP and the US Organization

were involved in violent activity against the community as a

Mr. Seidel was informed that the feud between the US

Organization and the BPP occurred long before the FBI

COINTELPRO became involved in the feud and that any proposals

approved by the Bureau had relatively little effect on the

violence committed by either group.

Mr. Seidel was also

reminded that. six or seven years ago the Congress of the

United States fully supported the war in Vietnam in which

thousands of people were killed but that under todays

circumstances no support has been given to South Vietnam.

U. S. SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON

INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC);

INTERVIEW OF SUPERVISOR RICHARD H. BLOESER

BY SSC STAFF MEMBER

Mx. Seidel then posed a hypothetical question

involving

the following factors: Would Supervisor Bloeser

now or in the past approve a counter intelligence proposal

whereby one extremist with a criminal record of violence

be anonymously informed that another extremist with a

record of criminal violence was an informant for the FBI,

knowing that the alleged informant might be injured or

killed. Supervisor Bloeser replied that under the present

conditions such a proposal would not be approved, but

that he could not give an answer as to what his

feelings

might have been six or seven years ago under any given

situation.

Mr. Seidel was again reminded that Congress

in the past has not hesitated to support wars which kill

thousands of people but that recently they have critiseed

the CIA for allegedly plotting

to assassinate one individual

whose death might prevent a war. Mr. Seidel was also informed

that it was ironic that Congress was investigating another

agency of the Federal Government which was attempting to

prevent revolucionary violence in this country.

Mr. Seidel then inquired into the counter

intelligence proposals approved by. the Bureau in relation

to the actress Jean Seberg and Raymond Hewitt, a leader

of the BPP.

This proposal concerned the fact

that Seberg,

who was then married to a French producer, admitted being

pregnant by Hewitt who was also married

at the time. The

Bureau arproved anonymously leaking this information to a

..

Hollywood columnist.

Mr. Seidel inquired as to whether

Supervisor Bloeser did or did not believe that this was an

_- invasion of privacy. Supervisor Bloeser responded that the

item was news worthy and that it.would have been any fair game

for any newsmen had they come across it in the course of their

business which they could have probably

certainly Congress would not have critisely done, and that

a newspaper fox

printing such an item or claim it to be anivasion of privacy.

Mr. Seidel inquired as to the purpose of this particular

operation and he was informed that Miss Seberg was giving

support to the BPP and that it was hoped that such publicity

would prevent any future support by her of the BPP.

INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC) ;

INTERVIEW OF SUPERVISOR RICHARD H.. BLOESER

BY •SSC STAFE MEMBER

He was further advised that it was the responsibility of the

FBI to determine who was funding revolutionary groups in this

country.

Mr. Seidel then inquired as to whether or not it

was difficult to conduct intelligence investigations under

present statutes and under the Criminal Rules of Procedure.

He was informed that it was somewhat difficult to conduct an

test to cornet an

effective intelligence operation under present circumstances

and that perhaps new legislative or executive orders would be

helpful to the FBI in order to allow the FBI to continue its

investigations in the Domestic Intelligence field. Mr. Seidel

inquired as to whether it would be helpful to have specific

legislation which might completely separate criminal and

intelligence operations so one would not taint the other.

He was informed that if such legislation could be enacted

that it would undoubtedly help-the FBI.

The interview lasted approximately two hours and

it was not necessary to consult with another Bureau

representative during this time.

ALL INTORMATION CONNATASE

HEREIN IS UNBLASSITINO NIRST

WHERE SHOWN OTHERTISE,

This memorandum reports the results of a meeting of

the Executive Committee of the Ad Hoc Coordinating Group on

Congressional Review of the Intelligence Community (hereinafter

referred to as the Group) held at CIA Headquarters on the

afternoon of 6/16/75.

This meeting was chaired by Mr. William Colby in his

role as the Director of Central Intelligence (DCI). In

attendance were Mr. Philip Buchen, Counsel to the President;

Mr. Roderick Hills, Counsel to the President; Mr. James A.

Wilderotter, Associate Counsel to the President; Mr. John Clarke,

Associate Deputy to the DCI; as well as senior officials from

Defense, Treasury, National Security Agency (NSA), and the

National Security Council (NSC). The Bureau was represented

by Inspector John B. Hotis and Section Chief William O. Cregar

FOREIGN AGREEMENTS

There was considerable discussion among the members

as to whether the intelligence community would furnish to the

Senate Select Committee (SSC) copies of agreements between

various agencies of the intelligence community and their

counterparts in foreign governments. This apparently presents

a very difficult problem for the community and no decision was

made as to how these will be handled. The White House, as well

as the Secretary of State, are considering how the community

should proceed.

Memorandum to Mr. W. R. Wannall

Re: Senstudy 75

62-116395

OUTLINE FOR INQUIRY PROCEDURES

Attached is a copy of the procedures for interviewing

current and former employees of any agency or department of

the intelligence community which interviews are to be conducted

by the SSC. The agreement was negotiated between the

White House and the SSC with little consultation with the

individual members of the intelligence community. The most

significant aspect of the agreement is identified on page 1,

paragraph A.

This paragraph identifies two categories of

interviews

SSC Staff Members expect to conduct. They are:

1. Those primarily seeking information concerning

the overall structure and function of any agency of its rela-

tionship with other agencies or the Executive branch; the

substantive work done in the past or being done by the agency,

including the legal bases relied upon and the requisite approval

levels for authorization; the capacities of each agency and the

responsibilities to provide information for other governmental

entities.

2. As designated by the Committee, those primarily

concerning specific allegations of agency or

Executive branch

abuses or other controversial specific matters where there is

reason to believe improprieties may have occurred.

As a general rule, an agency representative will be

present at interviews or preliminary testimony in the first

category. Similarly, as a general rule, agency representatives

will not be present at interviews or preliminary testimony in

the second category (alleged abuse situations).

Although the agreeme nt was worked out between the

White House and the SSC without consultation with the FBI, the

Intelligence Division believes it is workable and is certainly

better than the situation which currently exists where there

is no agreed-upon procedure established for the conduct of

interviews of current or former employees.

SSC FOREIGN TRAVEL

The CIA was informed by Senator Walter F. Mondale,

a member of the SSC, that he intended to travel to Europe to

inspect some of the

JFK Act 5 (9) (2) (D)

and other locations.

The White House, and particularly

Mr. Roderick Hills, was very concerned about this type of

trip feeling that it could cause all sorts of problems with

friendly

JFK Act 5 (9) 12) (D)

Mr. Colby felt that

such trips had been arranged for in the past involving

congressmen and that some good came out of such trips.

The

Committee discussed the pros and cons of the contemplated

trip by Mondale and possibly Senator Gary Hart, also a member

of the SSC, and decided that the purpose and procedures for

such trips would be discussed with Senator Church by Mr. Colby

and a senior official of the Department of State.

NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE ESTIMATES

The SSC has asked Colby for detailed briefings as

to how National Intelligence Estimates are prepared by the

United States Intelligence Board for the NSC. Colby contem-

plates giving a rather detailed briefing to the SSC on this

procedure accompanied by several senior officials of the

Intelligence Community Staff.

James Dick, Stati Member, Senate Select Committee,

requested that Special Agent James Patrick Kehoe be made

available for interview to be taken under oath by a Senator at

The focus of the interview would be mail openings,

covers and intercepts. This has been determined to be an

abuse-area.

Despite the fact the Department is examining various

types of mail surveillance with the view to possible prosecution,

Michael Shaheen, Special Counsel for Intelligence Coordination,

has determined that SA Kehoe's furnishing information on this

subject would not impede the Department's inquiry.

•un August. '5, 1975, SA Kehoe was advised of the above

and that he should be available for briefing at 7:45 a.m.,

August 8, at Room 4509 in the Justice Building.

SA Kehoe said that he would probably be represented

by private counsel during the interview and planned to invoke

the Fifth Amendment. He asked whether this would prejudice

his position in the Bureau.

SA Kehoe was told that the

Dear

Mr. Schwarz:

..Your request for information about the gathering of

intelligence at a local

level, including

the names of

individuals who engage in gathering of intelligence,

is incredible!

I think that the elected politicians

in Washington

who are supposed to represent their states

are doing a pretty good job of raping the FBI, the CIA,

and

the DEA.

This, however, involves incest because

they are

federal agencies.. I suppose if members.of

Congress decide to destroy the effectiveness of

the

FBI,

the CIA, the DEA, and the military that this is

their prerogative as

still.

long as their constituents hold

The attent to penetrate the appropriate criminal

intelligence mechanisms of local government by federal

lawmakers is an. absolute violation of the Tenth Amend-

ment of the constitution.

It will be a cold day in

hell when I provide you with the information you have

requested.

If I didn't gather necessary intelligence information

on criminal activity in my city to assist me in apply-

ing my

resources at the right place at the right-time,

this city would be in the same shape as many others..

We are proud of the fact that when crime went up

nationally 26 percent between 1970 and 1974, crime went

down in this city almost five percent. One of the

prime reasons is appropriate intelligence operations.

We are proud of the fact that this is the only major

We are proud of the

Our intelligence gathering is in absolute conformance

Dear Seymor:

Attached for your information is a memo on my staff interview

in G-308 August 11, 1975 in accordance with our conversation.

While there was no indication as to recall, I would appreciate

a return note from you to confirm that you received the memo and

to suggest an a, b,

to return for any

as you indicated, if the Executive committee or others send

formal subpoena,

I need to know a definite a, b, c procedure

with phone numbers to best represent all our interests. I look

forward to this message.

The attached material is not in the order of the questions as

asked. The questions were disconnected and left one with a

feeling of incompleteness. I think the main thrust stands out

clearly.

Since Nr. Hoover had publicly. stated during those years that

we were engaged in a certain amount of technical surveillance,

I felt that I could elaborate properly on certain associated

phases without encroaching on the records. I hope the material

will be of interest to you. Please excuse

the dubious typing

Best to you,

MEMORANDUM

August 12, 1975

TO: SEYMOR F. PHILLIPS

FROM: R. L, MILLENOM

SUBJECT: SENATE COMMITTEE on INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES

I. BACKGROUND

Telephonic request was received 8:40 pm August 5, 1975

from Michael Epstein to appear in Room G-308 NSOB August 11

or 12 for a staff interview. Air travel was confirmed August

6.

Appearance was made by the writer 11:45 am to 1:30 pm August 11,

in the presence of Mr. Epstein and Mary DeOreo. Advised of staff

interview rights.

II. INTERVIEW PROPER

A. Personal Background

1. Q. When did you leave the FBI?

A. December 30, 1965.

2. Qo How long in the FBI?

A. 1938 to December 30, 1965.

3.

Where did you work in the Ileld?

A. Worked in almost all the field divisions while

personally constructing radio stations and

travelling for months at a time, however, my

office of assignment remained in Washington.

4.

Q. Where did a non lawyer background fit?

A. Prior to WW II the Bureau began to need additional

help to manage the placement of two way radios

cars, construct point to point emergency radio

stations to handle communications in case of war,

disaster or nationwide communications strike, en-

systems for all the field offices as well as the

writing of specifications, reviewing

of bids, testing

and installing the hardware in the Ileld. This work

fell outside the usual capabilities of law trained

agents. In 1943, the Individual efforts of the

several engineers were solidified into a Radio

Engineering Section placed under the FBI Laboratory

for administrative purposes. from the beginning, the

mission of this group was that of a service and sup-

port section rather than that of operations. Cases

were worked by field agents under supervision of

their office and the appropriate interested divi-

sion supervisors at the headquarters. Field cases

as such were only a section concern when equipment

supply was inadequate of a breakdown occurred. In

this event we would be called upon to move equipment

about or correct the defective unit.

with my irregular hours making car pooling an

impossible situation.)

Relations with Others.

do What was your

relationship with w. C. Sullivan?

A. I knew of him as an Assistant Director in charge

of Domestic Intelligence División. As a section

chief of another division I had no occasion to

deal with hom. His activities appeared to be along

speech making and editorial lines.

2. Q. How many times did you go to his office?

A. None.

3. How many times did he come to your office?

4. Q. Didn't he disagree with Parsons as to the role of

the adequacy of the Laboratory scientists?

A. I believe that at one time he challenges the

adequacy of the Laboratorys' contact with outside

concerns. If that is what you had in mind, all I

can say is that I prepared an outline of the con-

tacts which we had and they were most impressive.

they ranged from all the military research est-

ablishments through the commercial radio and re-

search companies such as Texas Instruments, etc.

Our section

actually excelled in this type of

contact to "keep abreast" of a rapidly changing

field. I heara no more from Parsons or others

after submitting my list.

5: Q: Who assisted

you during your tenure as section chief?!

A.

A. J. Baker.

1. Q. Did your people furnish any training to field agents?

A. Special training was furnished to selected agents

so that they could serve as contacts in each field

office, alerting the section to parts needs, check-

ing the readiness of field equipment, advising of

equipment needs, alding in the input

to the annual

field budget preparation by the section as well

main sisting in planning. these agents, in the

carried their full case loads and were

under the local Agent in Charge, not the section.

F. Recording Facility.

1. Where was this facility physically located with

regards to your office?

A. Physically separated by being in another corridor

across the Justice Building.

2. Q. Not in the 7114 corridor?

A. Correct.

3: Q. Were agents offices attached thereto?

A. Yes,

a couple of bays.

4. Qi Who

had access?

A. Corridor doors were locked at all times but agents

had access with keys. Facility doors were locked

separately within that space.

5. Q. Was someone in that space at all times during the

day?

A. Most of the time. We tried to keep someone available

## Page 201

4

in the space in that neither Baker or myself were

qualified to operate the patch panel and recording

equipment and a Directors speech might have to be

recorded on short notice. This was somewhat difficult

in that the work assigned to these people in the form

of security checks for government officials tele-

phones and room security checks for such areas as hearing rooms

necessitated that the work be done outside of the

office space.

6. Q. Were these men fully occupied?

A• Yes.

7.

Qo How did you know they were fully occupied?

A.

By an administrative assignment system, kept one

year and then destroyed after statistics were com-

piled. Also by closely following the work load

and making adjustments to keep the 3 to 4 hour

overtime on an equitable basis.

S Go How do you know that someone couldn't make a

"composite" tape without your knowledge - and give

a specific example of why not.

A. As pointed out earlier, I was not present 24 hours

a day and therefore could not continuously mon-

itor the displaced space. Within reason, however,

for statistical purposes we needed to document our

input. This was done by assignment slip as It came

through the office by Baker or myself and in some

instances the paper work was done confirmatory

when the work was started on an urgent assignment :

orally. An effort was made early in the time period

as section chief, in 1955, 1956, to clearly

establish this procedure thereby avoiding persons

bringing work of any kind directly to a section

employee. The staff was repeatedly made aware of the

desired procedure. The only specific instance I

can recall occurred early in my tenure, possibly

in 55 or '56 when it was necessary to personally

challenge someone outside the section who was

bringing work directly to a section employee. What

the work was is not important. The bypass of pro-

cedure was. I was called by phone and went im-

mediately to the studio area on the other side

of the building and advised the person that the

proper procedure was not being followed. The person

departed and no further problem existed.

9. Q. Who was this person?

A. I believe it was Inspector Kemper.

10. Q.

Who called you in this instance?

A. I can't recall that detail 20 years ago but it

would probably have been someone normally

12.

Q. Was a memo written?

A. No. The immediate action corrected the problem.

13. @ Would a "trained" field agent be able to

operate filter equipment?

14. 8. Volta Matter be able to operate filter

equipment?

A. Yes.

G. Procedures:

1. Q. If a request to handle material came from a

1. l. Field

field office would it have a case caption?

A. Yes, to identify it with files and with the

divisions supervising the case.

2ö Q. Would you ever receive recordings from an

outside source?

A. Yes. Periodically from the military on crashes

of test planes, as for example where the pilot

was trying to tell what was wrong but the in-

telligence on the tape recording made on the

ground was garbled by over riding noises.

iltering techniques could, at times,

success-

fully bring out the message through time con-

suming procedures. In these instances, because

of the excessive manpower demands it was necess-

ary to borrow radio engineers and

trained Washington Field personnelto work on the

separate small portions of the questioned tape

to expedite the report back to the contributor.

3. & Did you have anything to do with codes and

ciphers?

• None, handled by another section.

•. @. What

about field recordings?

( Note: Since Mr. Hoover had

announced in

public that at one time some 98 technical

surveillances were in operation, it follows

A. A12 0e2060

that the Bureau had some training and operated

some eauipment in this area of operations.

.. All offices were self sufficient with regard t

playback and recording equipment. In Kidnapping

cases, for example, the equipment would be

needed on an immediate basis, hence, in my view

was unsatisfactory for an

office

to "borrow"

when needed from another office or request that

the headquarters in Washington send what they

need. Accordingly no "stock" was held here. The

field inventoried and maintained it.

H. Martin Luther King•

1. Q. Did you know in the period around 1961 that the

Bureau was investigating Mr. King?

A. No, as a support or service facility we would

not be envolved in field work unless there were

equipment or support problems. None were recalled.

2. Q. Did you instruct that a "composite" tape be made

on Mr. King?

A. No.

3. Q. I have inferences that you did. Did you?

A. I did not.

4. @ Is it possible that someone could make a tape

without your knowledge?

" i"

A. It is possible, but not a probable situation.

As indicated, the section was in two separate

parts with the voiceprint, filtering, recoraine

and related test equipment located across the

building away from my office. Possible, of

but minimized by a need to keep close

accounting of our work from an administrative

and statistical standpoint to assist in just-

ifying our existence and our programs to the

satisfaction of the inspection staff.

5. Q. Have you since heard of investigations of Mr. King

by the Bureau?

A. Through media references recently.

6. Q. Did you see material coming through your office

for handling captioned "Martin Luther King"?

r. i Bre on do marion in tree you to

tigations or Matters"?

A. I did not.

I. Miscellaneous Items.

1. Q. Did Mr. Hoover have technical recorders?

A. I recall none during my tenure of 1955-1965. He

was basically opposed to technical things in

that he tended to avoid those items which he

did not lully understand. Accordingly, much

administrative effort was expended in explain-

language which could be

fully understood.

2. ITEM. A long list of names was observed. Some

questions about, people came from this list

such as Pfafmans" reference.

3. ITEM. The period of interest appeared to be in

the 1961 or thereabouts

era. It is noted that

the person being interviewed is being asked to

recall details occurring 14 or 15 years in the

past.

Interview of IDI Special Agent (SA)

Seymor Fred Phillips by SSC Statf Members

At the very outset, Phillips was asked to sign a

of a copy to cive to Phillips.

Inereafter, Phillips made the

following opening remarks to the SSC personnel. Phillips

advised that in an effort to assist the SSC, he was informing

then that his supervision of the former FBI

Martin Luther King, Ji. at FBl Headquarcers (Ia) Was from

roughly very late in 1903 to the tall of 1005.

knowledge was contined to roughly that period.

The interrogators

were given to understand by Phillips that the discussion to

ensue would concern a period of 10 to 12 years ago and that

Phillips' replies must be considered in that context. Phillips

indicated that he would to the best of his ability give his

best recollections in response to questions.

Phillips also

staied that his intercozators should undosstand that during

the Intervening years Phillips had been indirectly caposcd

to nuch intomation relating to the ring invesilgation.

Phillips gave two examples to illustrate.

He brought to attention the fact that he had becn

exposed over the years to many media accounts relating to the

King investigation.

A noteworthy one was a feature article

which appeared in "The New York Times" in early 1975. A second

escuple oi Phillips' exposure to information concerning tho

King investigation relaied to Phillips' current FDI assignnoné

of which both Epstein and Debreo were fully cognizant.

Phillips

pointed out that this assignment has exposed him to a vast

anount of information, both docuentary and that being furnished

orally to the SSC by

various witnesses.

As a consequence,

Phillips pointed out the difficulty which he expected to encounter

in ansvering questions because it would take very studied

thought in many instances to dificrentiate in his nind informa-

tion which he had acquired in the supervision of the king case

and information which might have come to his attention during

the subsequent years, particularly the past few months in

connection with his current assignment.

Seymor Fred Phillips by SSC Stafi lembors

Phillips then went on to point out what he understood

o be the paraneters ot this interviow, which were as tollows

ho interviow was to concorn the King investigation only. Th

interview was to exclude information which was the product

or fruit of all electronic surveillances through which the FBI

obtained information concerning King.

In mentioning this

privileged area, Phillips again emphasized the difficulty ho

would likoly have in sorting out information he has in terms

of how he first acquired it. lle emphasized that it he rocognized

that his ansvor to a question vould roguire divulging information

iron an olcceronic surveillance, ho would not answer that

question. finally, Phillips pointed out what he considered

the four

privileged arens concerning which he did not intend

to answer questions. These wore as follows:

which identifies or could identify a confidential source.

Information which might advorsely affect ongoing FSI

investigations. (3)

Infomation obtained from third agencies,

including forcign intelligonce agencies,

(4) Information

roventing

sonsitivo investigative nethods and techniques.

(The exclusion of discussing information from clectronic

surveillances is based upon current negotiations between the

SSC, the Dopartment of Justice and an attornoy for the widow

of King.

It is the FBI's understanding that the king attorny

agreed to the interview provided Phillips did not disclose

information fron electronic surveillances.

Phillips indicated that he antiointed the interview

to ko prolongod and that ho anticipated that it would be tiring

because of the unusual factors involved as discussed above.

Ic thorefore requested that in order to avoid weariness on his

part, which would be counterproductivo to the ssC's obtaining

mazitum benefits from the interviow, consideration be given to

breaking up the interview on a general basis oi two hours, a

broak for lunch, and then another two hours. He indicated that

as the intervicw progressed, ho would be floxiblo on this but

felt that the intorview, 1f

more than one day long, should not

exceed four and one-hall hours on any one day. Epstein indicated

agreement with this request and the basis for

it.

Phillips rolating to the organizational maloup of the DID

starting in 1961 and the various soctions and units he had

been assigned to over the years. He indicated that when he

first joined the DID he was assigned to the Intornal Security

Scotion and spocifically to the Communist Party Unit, It

was while in this Unit that Phillips took on supervision of

the king caso and he continued that supervision whilo serving

subscquontly in a unit conccially devoloped to concentrate on

invostigations relating to the conmunist influencos in racial

matters. It was his best recollection that the Unit actually

might have been named Communist Influonce in lacial Matters

his vort associates in the biD during the pertinent period od

These included individuals a various levels within

All of these individuals either

worked with, over, or under Phillips during the pertinent

period, including

the time he first was assigned to the DID

in 1991.

Phillips pointed out in respect to Lelmont that it

was his understanding that Belmont is in an extrenely 111

condition and it was suggested that if the SSC had any intention

to interview belmont, it would be wise to first check with his

physician.

In the same contest, Phillips pointed out the

following in respect to Fred Fox. This individual was Phillips'

Unit Chiot when ho was first assigned in the DID and it wos

balioved by Pilllips that fox hod alroady loit the section when

Pillips was first essigned the king case.

Consequently, it

was not believed that for would be knowledgeable in this matter.

Horcover,_Phillips pointed out that Fox was a personal friend

and that

Fox had sullered a very tragic loss of his spouse

earlier this year. As a result,

grief and it was suggested by Phillips that he might not be

an ideal subject for interview.

Re:

Interview of FBI Special Agent (SA)

Seymor Fred Phillips by SSC Staff lembers

There was considerable discussion generated by

questions concerning the organizational makeup in the various

units in the Internal Security Section as well as concerning the

routing of mail through the various levels.

It was explained

by Phillips how mail would be generated at a supervisory level

up through a Unit Chief and then to the Section Front Office.

At that point it might be handled by either or both the

Section Chier and his Number One Man.

"out off," meaning approved for mailing, tho mail would move

to the Division Icont Office where it would be seen by either

one or both the Assistant Director and Number One Man.

Important nail would, of course, move beyond that level to the

office of the Assistant to the Virector and thence, in some

instances, to the Associate Director and the Director himself.

Phillips was asked to identify clerical personnel

who worked for him when he headed up the Unit dealing with

CIRIl. le named one individual who he indicated had been

Secretary to the Unit Chief in the Connunist Party Unit and

phillips best of his recollection, also served for a

secretary.

This individual was then named

Kathleen

Osborne, later married name Jensen; now divorced and

remarried, last nane unknown.

Questioning was diverted before

Phillips named any other clerical personnel.

The foregoing phase of the interview which covered

routing of mail, identities of personnel,

etc., covered about an hour and fifteon minutes.

With Respoct to Intolligenco Activitios (SSC)

Ro: Interview of IDI Special Agent (SA)

Seynor Fred Phillips by SSC Staff Members

Ills questioning elicited the following background

in this investigation as lost Phillips could recall it.

It

was explained that during the period in question, 1963-65,

the Internal Security Section handled investigations primarily

only in the domestic intelligence field. Invostigations of

some key leaders of subversive groups were also hanaled

in that Section. There was then in existence in the DID a

Section known as the Subversive Control Section which

supervised basically the invostigations of donestic subvorsive

individuals.

The King caso was assigned in the Subversive

Control Section whon Phillips was first esposed to it and was

assigned specifically to a Supervisor named William Forsyth

handled by both Iorsyth and Phillips and eventually, for all

practical purposes, it was suporvised by Phillips alone.

This was brought about by the nature of tho euphasis boing

placca by the FBI on the communist influonces in the racial

movenent which wore coning to the rBi's attention by investiga-

tion and othervise.

Bocause or this, it was dotormined at

• point in timo that there be created within the Internal

Security Section a CIIM Unit and that there be vested in it

related investigations such as that concerning King.

It might bo noted that at ons point during the

extensive organizational phaso of tho intorviow, Phillips

reninded lipstoin ot his bolict that he was furnishing Epstein

considerably more inforation than required within the agrocd

paranoters of the interviow.

Phillips indicated, however, that

ho was willing to do so as an exhibition of good

faith and

cooporativonoss not only on his part,

but as relating to tho FBI.

Discussion turned to the character used in correspondence

in the investigation of king and of the organization which King

headed, tho Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) •

thillips explained that to the best or his roco-lect on, the

character of the ling case was St-d (socurity Nattor • Comuniot)

and

the charnctor of the SCLC case was IS-C (Internal Security -.

Conmunist). Epstein inquired as to whether thore was a file

did not know.

Epstein inquired as to whether there was moro

than one main file on king and the SCLe and was told that

Phillips did not know of any more than one.

Inquizy was made as to whom the SCLC was assigned.

Phillips explained that the case concernine the scle vas of

o. Coninfil (connunist infiltration) type.

Consequently, this

caco was assigned in a unit specinlizing in communict

1nt-cration-type cases.

The Unit Chief Was John Kleinkauf

but to Phillips' best recollection, the case later was assigned

in the Cill Unit.

Epstein inquired as to when the King caso was opened

and what the date of the first piece of paper in that case bore.

The sane questions wero asked concorning caso on the SCiC and on

Stanloy Dwid Lovison.

Palllips Stated that he did not know

the answers to these questions.

As to the chaxacter of the

Levison case, Phillips replied

that he thought it was StIC.

Inquiry was nade as to whose idea it was to have a

CIRd Unit and Phillips stated he did not recall.

Questions wore astied about tho FBI's analysis of the

arch on lashington which took place in August, 1903, and oi

uny papors which were axleton nbout 1t.

It was obvious that

Epstein was aware that some

" "Briel" or

similar analysis documeni

about the racial sicuation at the time was propared in the Ful.

Phillips explained that alter the harch on lashington, sone

documents were prepared in the form of sumnary or analysis and

that the warch on Washington was also part of an extensive

"Brief" which was propared as un in-house docuent covering

¿ho vholo subject of conunist influences in tho racial movement.

concorning king was after the fact. He oxplained that there

had beon a misur on King ot

and that after the oporation had been torminatod, Phillips was

In responding is to how Phillips acquired this

mntorial, ho said ho did not rocall such but tolt fairly cortain

that ho did not rocoivo it through routine mail channols.

It

night also have had typographical errors and the like.

Asked

to whom the LAM which Phillips prepared was disseminated, he

responded to his best recollection it was disseminated only to

The White House at that time.

Asked if it was lator disseminated

to anyone else,

he said he did not know that it was but that

information in

it was later incorporated into a second Lill,

along with new-found infornation and that the second Ill was

dissoninated to both the hitc House and to the then Attorney

General (AG) Robert Kennedy. Asked as to woonelse it was

disschinated, Phillips could not recall anyone else.

Phillips

was questioned about the procedure for disseminating to The

White House and the AG and explained that it might possibly

have been done by use of a single lili prepared in sufficient

number and then sent to The White House with one cover conmunica-

tion and simultaneously, another copy sent to the Ad with another

cover communication.

It would havo been common pinctice at the

tine to have included in cach cover communication inforation

indicating who else was receiving the same LaM.

Phillips was asked if any new information which

prompted the second Ifil had arisen from a misur.

Phillips said

that it had but at this point reminded Epstein that he would

not be able to discuss content pursuant to the agreements and

arrangements discussed earlier in this menorandum. Epstein

wanted to know exactly which misur prompted the second Ill

Land

Phillips said he could not pinpoint which misur.

Epstein

wanted to know how many misurs the FBI had had on King and

Phillips said that he would only be able to give a rough

estinate.

Ipstein wanted to know the number even if it was

only a rough ficure and he was told that it would possibly have

been between

Which was likely documented and that the iSC would got this

On this occasion, Ipstein reminded Phillips

that notwithstanding any documentation the ose receives, it

nevertheless desires Phillips' recollection of events.

on King outside of the country, Phillips soid he knew of none

and went on to renind Ipstein that the FBI was nonoperational

have been put on by a foreign intolligence agency and that

such an agency was a privileged area for discussion during

the interview.

In making this statement to Epstein, Phillips

said he did not want Epstein to infer that there were misurs

outside the United states concerning king that Phillips Imew

about.

Inquiry was made concerning photographic surveillance

being taken in Los Angeles outside of a hotel and at the

Phillips

indicated they were of possibly both types.

Epstein inquired as to whether there were any

photographic surveillancesby other agencies, Federal, state

Phillips said he

knew oi none.

Phillips reminded ipstein, however, that the

newspapers had many pictures os ring leading marches and in other

similar public activities and that as a consequence, local agencies

might well have taken pictures of king but that it would be

vory questionable as to whether they could be justifiably

catogorized as pictures derived fron photographic survoillances.

In discussing the authority for misurs, Faillips

o menorandun to the bI which in effect savo AG authority into

Hoover's hands in cases of this nature and that the proceauxes

in etfect provided within the Bureau for lesser officials to

have the authority.

This would have included down to the lovel

of section Chief Baungardner in this case.

Phillips further explained that after a certain point

in time, and the best he could place this would have

been in

1965, 2 procedure went into elfect to verte a communication to

the Ad on each misur.

The intention at the time was, to

Phillips' best recollection, to get the AG's advance

authority.

lowever, as a practica. matter, it was not leasible many time:

to set the AG's authority in advance.

Some situations would

be so fast moving and the sensitive and security aspects would

be such that it would not be possible to get such authority

in advance.

In such a situation, an immediate communication

would be written to the Ad explaining to hin that the installation

was nade without his advance authority becauso time was of the

essence.

Under such circumstances, it would not be uncommon for

that connunication advising the At

of the misur to also adviso

him of its discontinuance.

For examplo, a misur might be

installed one morning to cover a day's activities and the misur

night be withdrawn the same night or nezt morning. In such i

situation, one communication to the AG would advise of both

the installation and withdrawal os the misur.

Epsiein asked whether, when the proccaure for advising

the AG of all misurs vent into

cilect, the iG was told of all

prior misurs which had been in effect.

Phillips stated he did

not know the precise answer to this question but told Epstein

that the AG at the time of the King nisurs (Robert Kennedy) was

aware of the nisur coverago on King beczuso he,

Kennedy, had

seen the product of the misurs.

Phillips emphasized that the

epstein again asked how the ad would know of the misurs if

Phillips explained once again that the AG had scen

the product of the misurs not only in lills but also in monographs.

Phillips was usked is the AG was shown any logs or

verbatin transcripts from the misurs or whether any of the tapos

At a point in the questioning which was after what

Phillips felt was a third time he had explained to Epstein

that from information furnished to kennedy, there should have

been no doubt in Kennedy's mind that the FBI had nisurs on king,

ipstoin asked if the At might not have thought the product was

the rosult of a tesur rather than a misur.

Many questions were asked concerning the sending of

nisur tapes to the Laboratory. They concerned how they were

sent, which ones were sent, to whon they were sent and how

many times thoy wero sent.

Phillips said that they were eiven

Phillips recalled sending to the Laboratory for use by SA William

Campbell certain tapes.

At the time, Campbell was assigned

to WFO, Phillips did not recall how many times he had sent

tapes to the Laboratory.

Epstein asked concerning the decision to make trans-

cripts of all the tapes after Phillips had indicated that tapes

had beon sont to tho Inboratory for two purposes. One purposa

was possibly for the preparation of the composite and the other

was to have a written transcript available of all misur tapes.

Phillips Indicated that he could not recall anything about

the decision to nake transcripts of all the tapes.

He was asked

if there was any written record about sending the tapes to the

Laboratory and he said he did not recall. He was asked who

propared the transcripts and ho said it was Campbell for the WFO

tapos as well as fos sone others, specific ones unrecalled.

Phillips was asked to exclude information he had fron

the media or through his current assigment and to then respond

as to whether he was aware of any COINTILPRO (Counterintelligence

Progran)-type activities against King or the SCIC.

Phillips

responded that he could not answer this question because he did

not think that he and Epstein could ever have a meeting of the

minds as to what ves encompassed in COINIELPRO-type activitios.

lipstein meant by other activities, but that it dissemination

was another activity, the FBI did disseminate infornation

about King. He was asked if any information about King

was

disseminated outside the Federal Government and at this

point,

Phillips choso to not answer the question.

Phillips was asked what activities the IBI engaged in

regarding King and the ScLe other than the collection of

disscination of intelligence.

Phillips'

response was that in-

sofar as the SCLC was concerned, this subject was outside the

paraneters of the interview. As for the king case, Paillips

Iclt that the question was too general to be answered by

Ipstein asted

is Phillips recalled a neoting at lo

whero there was proscat

at least one sA from Atlanta and

Assistant Director Sullivan.

Phillips answered that there bad

been such a meeting or conference but that he did not attend

and therefore had no firsthand knowledge.

Phillips explained

that in late 1963, he had taken practically all of his annual

leave for the year in two separate segments. One was over the

Thanksgiving holiday and the other over tho Christmas holidays.

It Was Phillips' recollection that a conforenco vas held and it

likely had beon in cither lovember or Decenber of 1905 while

Phillips was out of the city.

He was asked the purpose of the

conference or meeting and responded that it was his understanding

Phillips' response was that in the period

following the conterence, say for one or two years, there was

However, Phillips noted that he could not

Phillips responded that this was outside the scope or the

interview but Phillips was willing to tell hin that the EDI

Jad had wiretaps on the soul in its oiiices in atlanta, ceorgia,

and New York City.

Asked if there were any viretans on the SCLo

elsewhere, Phillips said he know of none and again reminded

For purposes of identification in this memorandum,

my name is George G. Moore, former Special Agent of the FBI

having retired July 31, 1974. My address is 6715 Horth 27th

Street, Arlington, Virginia, telephone number 533-8288. In

vier of the fact that I have been intervieved by the Senate

Select Committee (SSC) concerning matters involving my

activities while an FBI employee, I am making this intervier a

matter of record for the information of the FBI by my ovn

volition.

On July 28, 1975, I appeared at the new Senate Office

Building for a 2:00 p.I. Interview with Mr. Loch Johnson, a

Staff Member of the Senate Select Committee, concerning the

Huston paper.

Although the interview was originally set up for

2:00 p.m., we spent a total of 45 minutes looking for an office

space in which to hold the interview. Mr. Johnson was consider-

ably embarrassed with the snafu of his clerical staff not

providing him with room keys in the former Carroll Arms Hotel

already occupied by other Staff personnel. After approximately

30 minutes, I suggested that perhaps we would save alot of time

if he conducted the interview in the park across the street.

He seemed receptive to this suggestion; however, ve could not

find a pack bench. We proceeded to Senator Church's office

and arrangements vere made to use the Senator's personal office

located in the Capitol building itself.

At the beginning of the intervier, It. Johnson id

not place me under oath or indicate that I tas under subpoena.

He also did not advise me of my rights and right to counsel,

although he was avare that a representative of the Bureau

(Supervisor L. F. Schwartz) vas standing by in the Senate

OfEice Building for consultation if needed by me.

The following were key points which I recall covered

during the intervier.

Initially, he asked me for a brief statement of my

background which I provided. He was very much interested in

knowing the extent of my acquaintanceship with Mr. Juston

prior to the June 8, 1970, (a Monday morning) reeting in the

Director's office. I informed him that I had met Huston no

more than two times prior to that meeting and possibly once

when I had briefed him at Mr. Sullivan's suggestion in

Division 5 concerning extremist activities covered by the

section under my supervision. Such briefing was not a long

briefing and I did not recall any further details including

who might have accompanied Mr, Huston. Text, he desired to know

if I had ever prepared a paper for Mr. Huston which indicated

the extent of the extremist threat in the United States. I

did not recall preparation of any such paper at this time other

than the overall paper prepared at the Director's (and President's)

instructions in the Sumner of 1970, known as the "Huston Plan."

He asked me that I considered to be a true assessment

of the extremist threat at that time and I informed him the

paper which vas ritten tas an accurate statement of the threat

as knom to the FBI together with the input fron other intelligence

agencies.

He seemed interested in the foreign aspects to this

threat and asked for my assessment in that regard and endeavored

to have me label it as significant, nonsignificant, moderate

and similar adjectives. I refused to label it and stated that

the threats spoke for themselves and it was for others to

Interpret in that regard although I did point out that there

vas and has been and possibly still remains a degree of varying

proportions of foreign influence in these movements. I

emphasized that the word was "influence" and not knowledge

of any control.

He asked whether I felt the President was correct

In believing that the quality of FBI intelligence in this area

was low.

I informed that it was my recollection that President

Johnson likevise had been critical of the overall data of

FBI Intelligence in this area and ve in the FBI who collected

such intelligence knew fully well that our intelligence product,

although good in some respects, left much to be desired. In

other words, there were definite intelligence gaps.

next overall point covered was the meeting in the

Director's office on Monday, June 8, and his desire to receive

from me a feel of the tenor of the meeting since I was one of

the participants.

I informed him of the nature of my attendance which

was a last minute notification by Mr. V. C. Sullivan uho

stopped by Branch Chief Joseph A. Sizoo's desk (which I was

manning at the time) and asked me to go with him across the

street to the Director's office. He did not tell me why and

did not brief me ahead of time. After getting there, it was

obvious I was taken in order to prepare a memorandum of the

event. (This was obvious to me since I was much the junior

man in attendance.)

Mr. Johrison was interested in a rundown of the

meeting itself to the best of my recollection and I provided

him a few of the details including the fact that Admiral Noel

Gayler (phonetic) of the lational Security Agency (ISA) was

about five minutes late and the Director started the meeting

on time without him. Also, during the meeting the Directos

gave a very brief rundown on the mandate of the President,

which was to identify intelligence gaps through a cooperative

effort letting the chips fall there they may and affording

the President a good hard-hitting report which vould allow

him an opportunity to make some hard decisions. Somewhere

in this meeting the comment was made about a lack of cooperation

on the part of the agencies, and the Director looked Mr. Helms

in the eye and said that he was not aware of any lack of

cooperation on the part of any of the agencies and Mr. Helms

agreed with the Director In spite of the fact that llaison had

been curtailed a short time prior to the meeting by the Director

with CIA.

One other item of interest furnished was the fact

that Admiral Gayler used this meeting as an opportunity to

make a request of the Director that he hoped the FBI would

help NSA out by engaging in surreptitious entries regarding

embassies. The Director gave him no hope in this regard

pointing out the risks involved and the climate of the times.

dictated that this matter be given very careful study before

ary hasty decisions would be arrived at.

*(S

Mr. Johnson asked If I was aware of a flap which

occurred at this meeting in which Mc. Huston allegedly informed

the Director that the guidelines for the study vere broader

than announced by the Director in his presence. I recalled

no such flap and informed Mr. Johnson that a memo was written

by me of the meeting which was sent to the Director which

hit the highlights of the meeting. He asked iE this vas

available in Bureau files and I answered that I assumed so.

Mr. Johnson was very much interested in the meetings

and discussions thich took place at langley, Virginia (CIA's

hone), and wanted to know who desired meetings to be held there.

I emphasized to him that I was not privy to any plans of that

sort and only functioned from that time on as a member of the

working committee primarily because the Section I headed

was involved in domestic extremist activities.

He desired to know of Huston's input into these

meetings and of any flaps which occurred and in particular

he mentioned someone told him of a flap involving Army. I

informed him that Huston did not seem to be running the meeting

as Sullivan seemed to be doing that in his position as Chairman

and I knew of no flaps that occurred with any members.

I also mentioned in response to a question that

Mr. Helms did attend the first meeting at CIA Headquarters

and merely welcomed us to their space and offered any assistance.

He left and never returned after a few remarks.

Johnson asked several questions involving the format

of the report utilizing options for the President and asked

for my knowledge of how such a report vas decided upon. I

told him I had no knowledge; he was asking the wrong person,

He commented about Part 3 being only one recommendation

and wanted to know if that was unusual and I responded that I

had never been invoïved in a paper for the President before

and I did not know whether such was unusual or not. I also

commented that I felt that the options in and of themselves

- 7 =

were in the nature of recommendations at the President's l

pleasure.

Johnson was especially interested in whether other

agencies were desirous of using this whole operation as a

means of utilizing illegal techniques which vere at that time

denied and also if the FBI representatives likevise approached

this task with more than usual enthusiasm with the expectance

that they too would be allowed to use techniques some of which

vere obviously Illegal.

I told him that I could not speak for other agencies

and that there were better people to speak with on that score

but as far as my Feelings as a representative of the FBI were

concerned, ve all approached it as a difficult task involving

hard work, in vier of a short deadline, and a project on which

the President, the Director and Assistant Director Sullivan

vere riding herd. At the same time, from a personal standpoint

I felt that "hope always springs eternal" and that maybe, * in

view of the high-level interest involved here, from an overall

standpoint we might be provided with some investigative

tools which would allow us to do a better job. At no time

SPEETAL

was there any discussion to my recollection as to whether

any technique vas legal or illegal bearing in mind that

everybody at the table was a professional from an intelligence

point of view who made up a orking committee and the matters

of that nature would be policy matters involving officials

on a cabinet level or higher.

I was asked the question as to whether or not

extremist field personnel ever utilized covert mall examination

techniques. I told Johnson I felt he was getting beyond the

scope of my clearance

. from the Bureau for this interview and

he stated that he did not think so since one of the options

involved had to do with this matter. I informed him sather

than belabor the point that we in our Section's

work did not engage in this technique but I vould refuse

to go any further with respect to my knowledge.

He asked me if I had any knowledge of what developed

after the report was prepared, apparently approved by the

President, and then later recalled. I told him that I had

no knowledge of a personal nature and very poor hearsay, which

was gathered through rumor, and later accounts fron the press

that the Director allegedly took the letter to the Attorney

General who had it recalled.

He also asked me for my knowledge of how the

Director made his footnote decisions. I told him I did not

know but felt that ir. Sullivan vas the person who would know

and have first-hand knowledge. He asked me if the Director

discussed it with Mr. Tolson. I told him I did not know

but that he may have in view of the relationship.

He also was interested whether I had knowledge of

a difficult situation which Mr. Sullivan might have been in

at this time as chairman of a committee acknowledging intel-

ligence gaps on the part of the FBI and also occupying a

position which would entail loyalty to the Director. I

agreed that Mr. Sullivan vas in a delicate position.

He also asked me fos my opinion as to that lesson

could be learned from the Huston papers and I stated that

very little, if any, good could be learned from the papers

themselves but I did hope that after Congress was finished

with its investigation brought about by the Watergate syndrome

that the best interest of the country would be preserved in

the sense that ve don't loose sight of the fact that there

are legitimate national security interests which need to be

protected and that there will come a time in the future when

the people who are in power, whether it is Executive Branch,

Congress or both, will be asking the same questions vith

respect to intelligence gaps and will have to make some hard

decisions.

He also asked me if there was any advice I could

give as to reforms which could be initiated and I responded

that they were talking to the wrong person about reforms. It

seemed to me as

if they had enough reformers in Congress

today.

He did not ask me who was present at the meetings in

Langley as he said he had Full knowledge of those who were

present but he did name to me those he felt vere present and

at that time asked me if there vere any individuals in addition.

I mentioned that I was not sure whether T. J. Smith was present

or not. He mentioned D. E. Moore, W. G. Sullivan, C. D. Brennan,

R. D. Cotter, W. O. Gregar and F. J. Cassidy, as well as myself.

He also mentioned that he had heard that the report

consisted of 90 percent Bureau information and asked me 1f

that was correct. I said I had never put a percentage figure

on the information but knew that the report was top heavy

on Bureau intelligence which indicated intelligence gaps on

the parts of CIA and others. He asked me If I felt that

CONTRA

there was a need for an evaluation type of committee to

overlook domestic intelligence in the future. I said "yes"

I felt that there was a need but felt that such a committee

should be set up with Congress as a joint committee with the

Executive Branch. He asked why and I replied that if such a

committee had been set up, I wouldn't be in Washington, D. C.,

today giving an interview at this time and I thought for the

good of the country there should be in the future such a plan

instituted.

Finally, he asked me for my opinion as to whether

security work should be taken out of the hands of the FBI

and put somewhere else. I said that this was going a little

far from the scope but maybe it did bear on the "Huston Plan."

My reply vas that I felt from a historical vievpoint the

FBI's record in the security and intelligence field has

withstood the test of time and was an outstanding record under

the direction of Mr. Hoover and felt that if their reputation

was not unduly damaged by Gongress the security work definitely

should remain under the confines of the FBI. He said my

comments were interesting since I was the first retired person

to leave FBI with these feelingsand I replied that I did not

knot tho he talked with and certainly felt that Mr. Kelley

would take the same stand if he was called for interview. I

further stated that there is a definite relationship between

security investigations and criminal violation responsibilities,

many of which go hand in hand and as the terrorist threat

continues in this country and possibly explodes, ve vill see

more of a reason for security and criminal divisions to work

closely together.
