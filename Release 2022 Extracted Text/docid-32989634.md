U. S. SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON

INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC);

INTERVIEW OF SA WALLACE E, WARD
BY SSC STAFF MEMBER

On August 5, 1975, Special Agent (SA) Wallace E.
Ward was interviewed by SSC Staff Member Lester Seidel at
Los Angeles Field Office regarding Cointelpro/Black
ead Party. The interview lasted from -912~a.m. to
:22 a.m.

SA Ward was advised by Mr. Seidel that the
interview was voluntary but SA Ward was not advised of
his rights in this matter.

Seidel asked how long SA Ward had been a
Special Agent with the FBI, and SA Ward responded nine
years. He further requested previous offices SA Ward
had been assigned to, and SA Ward responded Cincinnati,
Ohio. Seidel advised the Bureau informed him that SA
Ward had been assigned Cointelpro/Black Panther Party
in June 1969. Seidel requested to know what work SA
Ward had been assigned before this, to which SA Ward
responded he could not remember, but believed general
eriminal work.

Seidel requested to know what specific
instructions were issued with regard to operating
Cointelpro/Black Panther Party. SA Ward advised
that due to his employment agreement, the sensitive
nature of the Bureau work, and the possible overlap
of Bureau investigation, he did not feel he could
respond to any further questions. Seidel advised he
understood SA Ward's position as he, Seidel, had
worked criminal matters himself and knew the need
for secrecy. The official interview was terminated
at this point.

(ELOSHEN



pac

In a friendly conversation that followed
for approximately ten to fifteen minutes, SA Ward
advised Seidel that he had only been assigned the
Cointelpro/Black Panther Party matter for three
months and had no knowledge that would be of value
. to Seidel. The Cointelpro/Black Panther Party matter
was not further discussed. The rest of the time was
involved in discussing points of interest in the Los
Angeles basin of tourist value, such as Marineland,
Palos Verdes, and Sunset Boulevard, Los Angeles.

SA Ward advises that he is aware that the
Director waived his employment agreement with certain
exceptions regarding privileged areas. With this in
mind, SA Ward reviewed his employment agreement and
concluded, after noting the following quotation, that
he could not disclose any information without following
the prescribed procedure:

"The burden is on me to determine, prior to
disclosure, whether information may be disclosed, and
in this regard, I agree to request approval of the
Director of the FBI in each such instance by presenting
the full text of my proposed disclosure in writing to
the Director of the FBI at least thirty (30) days prior
to disclosure".

With this in mind, SA Ward answered Mr.
Seidel as noted heretofore. :

This document contains neither recommendations
nor conclusions of the FBI. It is the property of the
FBI and is loaned to your agency; it and its contents
are not to be distributed outside your agency.

’ I believe that the answers to these questions~

i are essential to a complete understanding of the policies
and procedures followed by the Justice Department in elec=
tronic surveillance cases. Full information on these mat~
ters is necessary for the Committee to fulfill its mandate
"to recommend the enactment of any new legislation...
“necessary or desirable .to strengthen or clarify the national
security, intelligence, or surveillance activities of the
United States and to protect the rights of United States
citizens with regard to these activities." With the cdon-
tinued cooperation of the Justice Department, I am convinced
that the Committee. will be able to discharge this respon-
sibility in the critical area of national security electronic
surveillance. y

FURTHER DETAILS RECARDING THE
FBI'S USE OF MATT. COVERS, MATL SURVEYS,

AND PARTICIPATION IN CIA MAIL INTERCEPTS

MOSM 5-63 2s S87]

—NW_65360_Docld:3:


© pst ©

Mr. Chairman, I wish to furnish the Subcommittee
additional details regarding our mail covers and surveys;
however, some of this information enters sensitive areas
involving national security, and I respectfully request it
be presented in executive session.

As I have indicated previously, the FBI's use
of mail covers and surveys as investigative techniques has been
based on fulfilling its lawfully mandated responsibilities.

The list of intelligence accomplishments resulting
from mail covers on foreign establishments: alone is long,
but perhaps these examples will suffice:

In February, 1975, a member. of the military holding
a "secret" clearance obtained while in training was determined
to be in contact with a foreign establishment.

Also last February, an individual with a “secret"
clearance employed on a missile project was in such contact.

In November, 1974, a scientist involved in atomic
research was determined to be in such contact.

We have discovered through mail coverage on the
United Nations Mission of a communist country that a wide
range of individuals and corporations, have been in contact
with an official establishment of a foreign country with

which the United States has no diplomatic relations.



NW 65360 Docld:32989634 Page 88

With reference to our former use of mail survey

programs in which we surveyed mail for indicators as to whether
further processing is warranted, permit me to further explain.
the seven programs which I previously outlined in public
testimony:

of these surveys, one was established in New York
as a result of the experience gained in the investigation
of a Soviet illegal. This illegal cooperated with the FBI;
and we learned that in directing mail to his Moscow center,
he addressed it in a specific fashion and also directed it
to mail drops in Europe.

From this experience, we were able to develop a-
set of indicators which allowed us to select mail which we
felt was illegal agent mail. This, coupled with our knowledge
of known Soviet mail drops on this side of the Iron curtain,
permitted effective screening of the mail and selection of
letters on a knowledgeable basis.

This method was proved successful when we uncovered
three such illegals and successfully neutralized their
activities. This survey was conducted between 1959 and 1966.

A second survey was based on the use of these same
indicators in examining incoming mail directed to certain areas
of New York City and other cities in an effort to detect mail
being directed to illegal agents in the United States. This

survey was conducted between 1961 and 1962.

NW 65360 Docld:32989634 Page 89

A third survey was based on our knowledge that
illegal agents in the United States directed communications
to Soviet bloc intelligence officers employed at the United
Nations in New York City. Again, this survey was based -on
solid information that this means of communication was
utilized by the hostile intelligence service. This survey
was conducted between 1963 and 1966.

A fourth survey was conducted in the Miami, Florida,
area. It also utilized the known indicators and the known
mail drop addresses on mail being sent from the United States
to Cuba. As an example, during the period of time this program
existed in Miami, from January 2, 1963, until July 21, 1966,

60 letters were determined to contain secret ink messages
either on the letter or on the envelope.

Two other surveys were directed against mail being
sent to ‘the United States from the People's Republic of China
and Hong Kong, as well as mail directed from the United States
to China. The coverage of mail from the People's Republic
of China and Hong Kong was initiated August 1, 1956, and was
discontinued on January 24, 1966. The coverage of mail directed
to China operated between 1964 and 1966.

The purpose of these two surveys was to acquire
information concerning Americans living in China of interest

to the intelligence agencies of the United States; to detect



@ js = @

efforts by the People's Republic of China to persuade scientists
of Chinese descent in the United States to return to the.
People's Republic of China; to detect efforts to arrange

travel by these scientists and to learn any information they
would provide the People's Republic of China; to ascertain
identities of subscribers to and recipients of Chinese
propaganda publications; and to develop information concerning
persons of security interest in the United States who were
corresponding with persons in the People's Republic of China.

The seventh survey, conducted from 1940 to 1966,
was of mail addressed to Soviet-bloc and other embassies and
diplomatic missions of national security interest.

This program was initiated shortly before the
United States entered World War II and its vital necessity
during those perilous times seems obvious.

Following World War II, the seventh program was
concentrated against the Soviet Union and Soviet-bloc countries,
and much greater selectivity was used in screening letters
to be opened.

We were able, for example, in 1964 to detect
the fact a civilian employee of the United States Navy
offered to sell classified information to the Soviet Embassy
for $50,000.

With regard to the FBI's participation in the CIA

mail interception project, when we were offered data from

iXP-SEERET—

NW 65360 Docid:32989634 Page 90



that operation, we initially set forth four specific areas
of data which could be of value to our national security
responsibility:
1. Correspondence of a suspicious nature which
might contain double talk;
2. Correspondence indicating Soviets might be
using a hostage situation to develop sources in the United States.
3. Correspondence indicating a weakness or
dissatisfaction on the part, of any Soviet in the United States.
4. Information indicating Soviet control or direction
of the Communist Party, U.S.A.
In August, 1961, we advised the CIA that we were
interested in letters in which the United States addressee
or addressor was a Government employee, working ina
sensitive industry, or an American wishing to defect to
. Russia. :
In February, 1962, we established additional
guidelines regarding the type of letters for which we had
a requirement to help further our efforts to uncover illegals.
Knowledgeable FBI officials reviewed this data
periodically, and surveys were conducted, to assure that we
were receiving only data pertinent to our legitimate

responsibilities.

May I conclude by saying, Mr. Chairman, that the

FBI was motivated in these matters by a genuine desire to
faithfully discharge our national security responsibilities --
to detect and identify illegal foreign agents and persons

| willing to serve them.

The FBI first learned of the CIA mail intercept
project from a CIA official in January, 1958. The official
confidentially advised our liaison Agent that CIA had an
operation in New York in which mail going to, and coming
from, Russia was being examined by CIA. :

We were advised the project had ‘been furnishing
valuable economic and political information in Russia as
well as the identities of sources and potential defectors
in Russia. The CIA operation presented excellent potential
for uncovering Soviet espionage operations in this country.

On January 24, 1958, our liaison Agent was told by
CIA representatives that the CIA had initiated negotiations
with the Post Office in 1952, and finally had worked out
arrangements for this project, with the. approval of Postmaster
General Arthur E. Summerfield.

Our understanding was that under that arrangement
CIA would be permitted to initiate mail cover on mail going
to and from Russia.

The CIA coverage first involved merely photographing
the envelopes, and later resulted in the opening of mail.

CIA told us it had acquired considerable data of
foreign intelligence value. CIA also indicated a willingness
to handle leads for the FBI regarding matters within our.

national security responsibilities.

P-SECRET —

IW 65360 Docld:32989634 Page 94



© jes ©
It was recommended, and approved by Director Hoover,
that we ask CIA to advise us of any product of their operation
that would be valuable to us in discharging our national
security responsibilities. Once the receipt of material
began it was reviewed by knowledgeable Bureau officials to
assure the information was pertinent to our responsibilities
and justified our continuing to receive such information.

Qur interest was in detecting foreign espionage
agents and individuals in a position. to do harm to our
national security and indicating willingness to do so.

In August, 1961, we further clarified for CIA
the scope of our interest. This was to assure no material
not relevant to our responsibilities was.furnished to us.

In February, 1973, the FBI was approached regarding
taking over this CIA mail intercept project. We did not, and
in May, 1973, we received the last data from this CIA operation.
: In summary, our relationship with this CIA project
extended from 1958 to May, 1973. We have no figures for the
number .of items we received during the initial stages of that
operation; however, beginning in August, 1964, we began
preparing summaries of items received.

The full-year count ranged from a low of 1,353 in

1972 to a high of 6,256 items in 1967.

Re Cuban Mail Intercepts
In December, 1962, we were advised by CIA that it

was handling mail between the United States and Cuba. We were
asked if we had any requirements for the product of that
operation. We responded with a request for data -- which we
carefully delineated -- that would be of assistance to us in
fulfilling our mandated national security responsibilities.

In March, 1963, the CIA discontinued coverage of

mail going to cuba. |)

Legal basis for mail covers

The FBI utilizes mail covers as an investigative
technique in accordance with requirements set down by
law and the Postal Service. Procedures for obtaining
Mail covers are precisely set out in the Postal Manual,
Section 861. ,

The legality of mail covers has been substantiated
by a number of court decisions, beginning with Mr. Justice
Field's statement in Ex parte Jackson (1877); recognition

of this view through Oliver v. United States (1957); United

States v. Costello (1958); United States v. Schwartz (1960);

Cohen v. United States (1967); Lustiger v. United States (1968);

United States v. Isaacs (1972); cert. denied 417 U.S. 976 (1974).

History of Utilization by FBI of mail covers
The FBI has utilized mail covers allowed by the

U. S. Post Office Department and subsequently the Postal 7
Service as early as 1928. FBI procedures have been in
accordance with Post Office policies and procedures in
effect at a particular time.

From 1928 to 1945, Special Agents in Charge of
respective field offices were authorized to request a mail
cover from the appropriate Post Office official in their
respective territories. In 1945, the FBI policy was‘ changed
to allow the SACs this authority only in cases involving

deserters, fugitives and escaped Federal prisoners. All

GRET


oo e a e

other cases required FBI Headquarters approval. In 1947,

the FBI's policy was returned to the pre-1945 rule and

SACs were again permitted to request authority from the

Post Office without approval of FBI Headquarters. In 1954,
however, regulations were instituted whereby all mail covers
were to be limited to thirty days and justified to Headquarters
prior to being requested. This policy of final determination

by FBI Headquarters is in effect today.

Current statistics of mail covers utilization by FBI

As of June 17, 1975, current mail covers requested
or in place totaled 129. They were as. follows: National
security - 69; Fugitive - 59; Criminal - 1.

The number of mail covers represents a minute
fraction of the total number of investigations pending on

a daily basis.

Authorization procedures consistent with Postal regulations

The FBI follows the procedures for obtaining mail
covers set out in the Postal Manual, Section 861. Inasmuch
as the FBI fits the "law enforcement agency" definition in
the Manual, we make our requests to the Chief Postal Inspector

above, present FBI regulations require that mail cover
requests must be first cleared through FBI Headquarters
for approval.

FBI Headquarters screens the request to insure
that the mail cover can be potentially productive and that
the nature of the case is of sufficient import to justify
the technique. These decisions are made upon justification
from the field office, review by Headquarters' supervisory
personnel, with final decision resting at the Deputy Associate

Director leyel or above.

Benefits achieved by mail covers

Mail covers have proved to be valuable as an
investigative technique in certain investigations. For example,
mail covers have led to the identification of individuals
holding security clearances who contact hostile intelligence
services and who have provided intelligence information of
interest to the hostile foreign intelligence services.

Over the years mail covers have provided leads
which have resulted in the location of fugitives. In
criminal cases, mail covers have provided information that

has led to the discovery of evidence of criminal violations.

Purpose of mail covers
Lawful mail covers as an investigative technique are
based on the premise that discovery of an individual's

contacts provides knowledge of the individual's actions,

Wp Sener



— - ip net e a

as well as indicates other avenues by which knowledge of
the individual can be obtained.

Objectives, of course, vary depending on the
type of investigation involved. For example, in fugitive
cases, mail covers may be used in instances when the
fugitive's close associates or relatives are obviously
hostile or suspected of being so. When official contact
by law enforcement with these persons is rebuffed or
impractical, mail covers are often useful.

In selected situations where a crime has been
committed or an attempt made to do so, mail covers can
be used to identify participants or co-conspirators and
provide leads in investigations.

In national security matters, the insight provided
by mail covers is invaluable. The FBI's successful fulfillment
of its national security role rests largely in determining
the activities of hostile intelligence services. The mails
are obviously a means of communication which allows a

foreign intelligence service accessibility to persons or

_ places from which they would otherwise be prohibited by

law or where their physical presence would be suspect and
thereby negate a covert effort on their part. Knowledge of

their mail contacts can open avenues of lawful investigation

which can be most productive.



STATEMENT FOR RECORD ON

PBI USE CP MATL SURVEYS:

t NW 65360 Docid:32989634 Page 103



i ad Ve ee '

The FBI has conducted seven mail survey programs
solely .in the discharge of its national security responsibilities.
None has been conducted since 1966.

These surveys were instituted because of their
potential value in discharging the FBI's responsibilities
in the national security field.
| These surveys were conducted to detect and identify
foreign agents who threaten this Nation's security and to
detect other persons who indicated willingness, and were
in a position, to sell out this country to hostile foreign
: powers. Each survey program was carefully circumscribed
as to its scope and was conducted for specific objectives
with strict administrative controls.

These surveys involved the processing, or opening,
of mail; but they did not involve wholesale, indiscriminate
opening of mail. In these surveys we were looking for
indicators as to whether review of the correspondence might
lead to the detection of an illegal foreign agent or a
person cooperating with a hostile foreign power. Although ©
considerable volumes of envelopes were surveyed, the vast
majority of this mail was not further processed because it

did not contain indicators which would make it relevant to

the survey. : We

SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (Ssc) |

dated Jarwary 16, 1968, and February 4, 1969, which bear the
¢aption "Mass Media Program," and whieh were recovered from a
miscellaneous administrative file not connected with the program
itself. It scems apparent at this point that the Mass Media
Program was an informal program created at FBI Headquarters and
we have thus far been uvable to loeate any recorded correspond-
ence relating to the inception of the prozram or its termination,
as such. The above-mentioned memoranda will be delivered to the
SSC on August 11, 1975, and we are continuing efforts to develop
additional information of record concerning this program.

P., G. and H, This materlal will be delivered.

I, Material pertaining to “TITLET."

1. By memorandum June 12, 1975, SSC was
furnished certain material relating to DIET. sAnoag this
material was a memorendum, dated Yovember 7, 1969, which
recommended, "Persuant to the Director's instructions" that
“attached letters to the President andthe Attorney General be
approved enclosing the proposed current intelligence letter,"
This is the initial correspondence reflecting approval of IVLET,
Ro other support or underlying material was Located.

2, This request concerns an "Inspection
Report referred to in SAC letter of December 26, 1972." The
SaC letter is apparently the letter to Albany and all field
offices dated December 26, 1972, a copy of which was furnished
to you by memorandum Juve 12, 1975. In a review of this letter,
we have been unable to detect any reference to an Inspection
report; likevise, a review of all available INLET material
failed to reveal any inspection report or any reference thereto,

3. We have no record of a letter from the
FBI te Congressman tes Aspin in 1973 (or at any other time)
regarding INLET, We have located in our files.a copy of a
letter dated April 21, 1973, toe Me. Aspin from the White House,
This copy vas furnished te us as an enclosure to correspondence
from the White House concerning INIRT., We are currently in the
process of obtaining clearance for delivery of this material to
the 9SC,. ;

RE; REQUEST PERTAINING TO
ELECTRONIC SURVEILLANCE

SSC lettor May 14, 1975, with attached appendicos,
xequested certain documents and other information from the
FBI. Appendix D of this letter captioned "Request Pertaining
to Electronic Surveillance," requested the following specific
material under the desipnated item numbers:

Appendix D, Item 7, requests ali momoranda ond
other materials which; (a) relate toe intelligence activities
at or in connection with. the Remocratic National Convention (DNC)
at Atlantic City, Now Jersey, in August, 1964, and {bh) relate to
cleetronic surveiliances of tolephones and/or premises at
2414 Atlantic Avenue and/or Clairidge Hotel in Atlantic City,
New Jersey, during Aucust, 1964,

Appendix D, Item 8, requests Conmittes staff access
to ali memoranda and other materials reflecting the identities
of persons monitored, the contents of conversations
nonitered, and/or any information obtained from conversations
monitored on the surveiliances described in 7(b) above.

Appendix B, Item 16, requests a11 memoranda and
other materials containing the results of any aduinistrative or
other inquiry undortakon by the PBI ac a xosult of and/or volating
to the allegations contained in the January 2G, 1975, issuc of
The Washington Post concerning activities of the FBI in
Atiantic City, New Jarscy, in August, 1964.

The FBI's responss to the above is contained in a
vienorandum dated July 15, 1975, and its attached exhibits
(tabs) A through L,

~ By the very naturo of the titie of Appendix D,
- Request Pertaining to Electronic Surveillance," and the
language used in the specific requestsin Items 7 and 38,
it is obvious we ave dealing with material which is substan-
tially in the area of olectronic surveillances and falling
within the language of Mv, Elliff's inquiry where he refers
to, “any portions which summarize or deseribo any overhcarings *
obtained as a result of any olectronic surveillance directed
at Dr. King and/or members of his family."

NW 65360 Docld:32989634 Page 136



RE; REQUEST PERTAINING TO
ELECTRONIC SURVEILLANCE

As will bo illustrated by tho following resume and
examples, the FBI can give no assurances of the nature boing
requested by the SSC of the Justice Department.

By comparing information in the PeLoach memoranda
(Gxhibit/Tab K) with actual logs of overhears on King's
telephone during the DNC, it was determined that some of
the information in the DoLoach memoranda camo from :
electronic surveiliance of King and that, while we cannot
detornine the preciso sources for a majority of the information,
there is logical belief that much additional information in
these memoranda also came from clectxonic surveilianca of
King. The following are examples:

(1) DeLoach memorandum to Mr. Jenkins dated
August 25, 1964, (which bears a side heading on page one
xegarding Martin Luther King), page one, paragraph two
which concerns 2 cail received by King from Bayard Rustin
in which King stated he was very encouraged by the way
things were going and there had been no demonstrations by
the Hississippi Freedom Democratic Party CIEDP).

(2) PoLeach souerandum to Hr. Jenkins dated
August 25,.1964, (which bears a side heading on page threo
vogarding Martin Luther King) page three, paragraphs ono
through three which concern a cail from a monmber of King's
starz to a Mrs. Jackson reparding arrangemonts for her to
cone to the Atlantic City area; a call from Joan Sutton
of tho California dolegation asking Winn to ueot with
Culizornia delegates; and information indicating that MDP
Leaders had asked King to enll geovernors of two states in
an attempt to enlist their support.

{3) DeLoach memorandum to Mr. Jenkins dated
August 26,.1964, {six pages in length) pagos three nnd four,
which concern a contact with King by Dick Gregory te discuss
convention ovents including MEDP.

NW 65360 Docid:32989634 Page 137



RE: REQUEST PERTAINING TO
ELECTRONIC SURVEILLANCE

: (4) DoLoach momorandum to Mr. Jenkins dated
August 26, 1964, (which bears a sido heading on page two
rogarding Martin Luther King) page two, paragraphs three
through six and page three, paragraph one which concern
conversations by Rustin regarding MFDP delegates, a call
by Rustin to a xepresentative of tho National Council of
Churehes and whether or not there would be a streot
dononstration on that date,

In addition to Exhibit K, the FBI memorandum dated
July 15, 1975, and its other exhibits, which pertain to FBI
coverage during tho DNC at Atlantic City wore similarly
xovicwed to determine if any portions summarized or described
overhears obtained as a rosult of electronic surveillance of
King. The below outlined portions wore detexmined to contain
information from such typa coverage:

(1) «FBI memorandum dated July 15, 1975, page
sovon, paragraph five nade brief references to typo of

: INTERVIEW OF SUPERVISOR RICHARD H. BLOESER
BY SSC STAPF MEMBER

: “On August-—5-j=1975 , Gusine Richard H, Bloeser)
t . was interviewed by SSC Staff Member Lestér Seidel aE

Los Angeles FBI Office regarding the COINTELPRO/Black Panther
Party (BPP).

5 Mr. ‘Seidel advised Supervisor ‘Bloeser that the
t interview was voluntary, but did not advise Supervisor
; aan Bloeser of his rights in this matter.

Mr. Seidel inquired of Supervisor Bloeser as to
i how many offices he had served in,. his length of service in
H : the Bureau, and how long had been spent on intelligence
investigations. Supervisor Bloeser replied that he had
served in Philadelphia, El Paso and Los Angeles, had been
in the Bureau approximately 24% years, and had’ been assigned
_to intelligence work for 22 years. |

oe . Mr. Seidel inquired as to whether Supervisor Bloeser
believed that the Bureau had placed undue pressure on the

.- field to come up with counter intelligence proposals concerning

". the BPP and was it difficult to come up with a proposal.

Supervisor Bloeser responded that there was no undue pressure

placed on the field by the Bureau, that the COINTELPRO/BPP

was merely another case assigned to an agent and that agent,

as in any other case, had the responsibility of handling the

matter whether it concemed the solving of a case or the

submission of proposals. Mr. Seidel was also informed that

it was not unduly difficult to come up with a proposal and that

a number of proposals were rejected at the field level and

never submitted to the Bureau.

Mr. Seidel inquired specifically as to counter
intelligence proposals involving cartoons ridiculing the BPP.

U. S. SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON
INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC);

INTERVIEW OF SUPERVISOR RICHARD H. BLOESER
BY SSC STAFF MEMBER:

Supervisor Bloeser responded that he vaguely remembered such
proposals but without reviewing the file had no definite
recollection. Mr. Seidel did not request that the file be
reviewed.

Mr. Seidel inquired specifically about a business
card which allegedly had been prepared by the Bureau bearing
the phrase "Karenga is impotent." Mr. Seidel requested
Supervisor Bloeser's views on the distribution of this card
by the FBI. Supervisor Bloeser responded that he vaguely
remembered the.card, that he thought it was humorous, and
that the word impotent had various meanings.

Mr. Seidel then inquired about the blood ‘feud
which existed in the past between the US Organization and
the BPP and the efforts of the Bureau to keep this feud
alive and thus promote violence. He specifically inquired
as to the personal feelings of Supervisor Bloeser concerning
any counter intelligence propoSals which, if placed in
operation, could lead to violence between the twp groups.

. Supervisor Bloeser responded first that “personally
he had no apologies for the counter intelligence program as
a whole, that proposals submitted’six or seven years ago
were believed necessary at that time due to the circumstances,
specifically that at that time the BPP and the US Organization
_were involved in violent activity against the community as a
whole. Mr. Seidel was informed that the feud between the US
Organization and the BPP occurred long before the FBI.
COINTELPRO became involved in the feud and that any proposals
“approved by the Bureau had relatively little effect on the
violence committed by either group. Mr. Seidel was also
_ reminded that. six or seven years ago the Congress of the
“". United States fully supported the war in Vietnam in which
thousands of people were killed but that under today’s
circumstances no support has been given to South Vietnam.

U. S. SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON
INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC);

INTERVIEW OF SUPERVISOR RICHARD A. BLOESER
BY SSC STAFF MEMBER _

Mr. Seidel then posed a hypothetical question
involving the following factors: Would Supervisor Bloeser
now or in the past approve a counter intelligence proposal
whereby one extremist with a criminal record of violence
be anonymously informed that another extremist with a
record of criminal violence was an informant for the FBI,
knowing that the alleged informant might be injured or
killed. Supervisor Bloeser replied that under the present
conditions such a proposal would not be approved, but
that he could not give an answer as to what his feelings
might have been six or seven years ago under any given
situation. Mr. Seidel was again reminded that Congress
in the past has not hesitated to support wars which kill ed

| thousands of people but that recently they have critiz

the CIA for allegedly plotting to assassinate one individual
whose death might prevent a war. Mr. Seidel was also informed
that it was ironic that Congress was investigating another
agency of the Federal Government which was attempting to
prevent revolutionary violence in this country.

Mr. Seidel then inquired into the counter
intelligence proposals approved by. the Bureau in relation
to the actress Jean Seberg and Raymond Hewitt, a leader
of the BPP. This proposal concerried the fact that Seberg,
who was then married to a French producer, admitted being
pregnant by Hewitt who was also married’ at the time. The
Bureau approved anonymously Baking this information to a
. Hollywood columnist. Mr. Seidel inquired as to whether |
Supervisor Bloeser did or did not believe that this was an
..-invasion of privacy. Supervisor Bloeser responded that the
item was newsOworthy and that it.would have been any fair game
for any newsmen had they come across it in the course of their
business which they could have probably ‘easily done, and that.
‘certainly Congress would not have mapetie| newspaper for

printing such an item or claim it to be an mvasioi of privacy.

Mr. Seidel inquired as to the purpose of this particular

* operation and he was informed that Miss Seberg was giving
support to the BPP and that it was hoped that such publicity
would prevent any future support by her of eee BPP.

BY -SSC_STAFF MEMBER

He was further advised that it was the responsibility of the
FBI to determine who was funding revolutionary groups in this
oountry. :

Mr. Seidel then inquired as to whether. or not it
was difficult to conduct intelligence investigations under
present statutes and under the Criminal Rules of Procedure.
He was informed that it was somewhat difficult to conduct an
effective intelligence operation under present circumstances
and that perhaps new legislative or executive orders would be
helpful to the FBI in order to allow the FBI to continue its
investigations in the Domestic Intelligence field. -.Mr. Seidel
inquired as to whether it would be-helpful to have specific
legislation which might completely separate criminal and
ihtelligence operations so one would not taint the other.

He was informed that if such legislation could be enacted
that it would undoubtedly help-the FBI.-

The interview lasted approximately tw hours and
it was not necessary to consult with another Bureau
representative during this time.

Memorandum to Mr. W. R. Wannall
Re: Senstudy 75
62116395

OUTLINE FOR INQUIRY PROCEDURES

Attached is a copy of the procedures for interviewing
current and former employees of any agency or department of
the intelligence community which interviews are to be conducted
by the SSC. The agreement was negotiated between the
White House and the SSC with little consultation with the
individual members of :the intelligence community, The most
significant aspect of the agreement is identified on page 1,
paragraph A. This paragraph identifies two categories of
interviews SSC Staff Members expect to conduct. They are:

1. Those primarily seeking information concerning
the overall structure and function of any agency or its rela-
tionship with other agencies or the Executive branch; the
substantive work done in the past or being done by the agency,
including the legal bases relied upon and the requisite approval
levels for authorization; the capacities of each agency and the
responsibilities to provide information for other governmental
entities.

2. As designated by the Committee, those primarily
concerning specific allegations of agency or Executive branch
abuses or other controversial specific matters where there is
reason to believe improprieties may have occurred.

As a general rule, an agency representative will be
present at interviews or preliminary testimony in the first
category. Similarly, as a general rule, agency representatives
will not be present at interviews or preliminary testimony in
the second category (alleged abuse situations).

Although the agreeme! nt was worked out between the
White House and the SSC without consultation with the FBI, the
Intelligence Division believes it is workable and is certainly
better than the situation which currently exists where there
is no agreed-upon procedyre established for the conduct of
interviews of current or former employees.

- SSC_FOREIGN TRAVEL

The CIA was informed by Senator Walter F. Mondale,
a member of the SSC, that he intended to travel to Europe to
inspect sone of the{ meas TR)
and other locations. The White House, and particularly
Me. Roderick Hills, was very concerned about this type of
trip feeling that it could cause all sorts of problems with

friend].
Mr. Colby felt that

such trips had been arranged for in the past involving

| congressmen and that some good came out of such trips. The

| Committee discussed the pros and cons of the contemplated

H trip by Mondale and possibly Senator Gary Hart, also a,member
of the SSC, and decided that the purpose and procedures for
such trips would be discussed with Senator Church by Mr. Colby
and a senior official of the Department of State.

NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE ESTIMATES

The SSC has asked Colby for detailed briefings as
to how National Intelligence Estimates are prepared by the
‘United States Intelligénce Board for the NSC. Colby contem-
plates giving a rather detailéd briefing to the SSC on this
procedure accompanied by several senior officials of the’
Intelligence Community Staff.

James Dick, Staff Member, Senate Select ‘Committee,
requested that Special. Agent James: Patrick Kehoe. be made
available for interview to be taken under oath by a Senator at
9 a.m. , August 8, 1975, in Room G308, Dirksen Office Building.
Kehoe is currently a supervisor in our New York Office.

The focus. of the interview would be mail openings,
. covers and intercepts. This has been determined to bé-an—
abuse-area.

Despite the fact ‘the Department is. examining various
types of mail surveillance with the view to possible prosecution,
Michael Shaheen, Special Counsel for Intelligence Coordination,
has. determined that SA Kehoe's’ furnishing information on this Vy
subject would not impede the Department's inquiry. /

On August.5, 1975, SA Kelioe was advised of the above
and that he should be available for briefing at 7:45 a.m.,
. August’ 8, at Room 4509 in the Justice Building.

SA Kehoe said that. he would probably be represented}

. by private counsel. during the interview and planned to invoke

the Fifth Amendment. He asked whether this would prejudice
. his position in the Bureau. SA Kehoe was told that ‘the

Mr. Seymor Fred Phillips
Federal Bureau of Investigation
Washington, De C. Room 4063 “

Dear Seymor: ‘| Seyuiti. \y- ty

Attached for your information is a memo-on.my staff interview
in G-308 August 11, 1975 in accordance with our conversation,

While there was no indication as to recall, I would appreciate

a return note from you to confirm that you received the memo and

to suggest an a, b, ce procedure in the event that I get a call N
to return for any additional staff type interview. Secondly,
as you indicated, if the Executive committee or others send a
formal subpoena, I need to know a definite a, b, c procedure
with phone numbers to best represent all our interests. I look
forward to this message.

The attached material is not in the order of the questions as
asked. The questions were disconnected and left one with a
feeling of eine ake I think the main thrust stands out
clearly.

Since Mr. Hoover had public&yl; stated during those years that
we were engaged in a certain amount of technical surveillance,
I felt that I could elaborate properly on certain associated
phases without encroaching on the records. I hope the materi
will be of interest to you. Please excuse the dubious typing «

MEMORANDUM

August 12, 1975

TO: SEYMOR F. PHILLIPS
FROM: R. L. MILLE!
SUBJECT: SENATE COMMITTEE on INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES

I, BACKGROUND

Telephonic request was received 8:40 pm August 5, 1975
from Michael Epstein to appear in Room G-308 NSOB August 11
or 12 for a staff interview. Air travel was confirmed August 6.
Appearance was made by the writer 11:45 am to 1:30 pm August 11,
in the presence of Mr. Epstein and Mary DeOreo. Advised of staff
interview rights.

II. INTERVIEW PROPER
A. Personal Background
1. Q. When did you leave the FBI?
A. December30, 1965.
2. Q. How long in the FBI?

A. 1938 to December 30, 1965.

3. Where did you work in the field?

A. Worked in almost all the field divisions while
personally constructing radio stations and
travelling for months at a time, however, my
office of assignment remained in Washington.

4, Q. Where did a non lawyer background fit?

A. Prior to WW II the Bureau began to need additional
help to manage the placement of two way radios in
ears, construct point to point emergency radio
stations to handle communications in case of war,
disaster or nationwide communications strike, en-
gineer, design and construct voice communication
systems for all the field offices as well as the
writing of specifications, reviewing of bids, testing
and installing the hardware in the field. This work
fell outside the usual capabilities of law trained
agents. In 1943, the individual efforts of the
several engineers were solidified into a Radio
Engineering Section placed under the FBI Laboratory
for administrative purposes. From the beginning, the
mission of this group was that of a service and sup-
port section rather than that of operations. Cases
were worked by field agents under supervision of
their office and the appropriate interested divi-
sion supervisors at the headquarters, Field cases
as such were only a section concern when equipment
supply was inadequate of a breakdown occurred. In
this event we would be called upon to move equipment
about or correct the defective unit,



mo, e 2 ®
. ‘
: : B. Personal Information :
1. Q. Have you been in contact with the Bureau in this
matter?

the Washington Field Office.
2. Q. Did he work in the section?
A. Not while I was theres

my own space in Court E of the Justice Building
with my irregular hours making car pooling an
impossible situation.

Ae



@ “5 @

D. Relations with Others.

1. Q» What was your relationship with W. C. Sullivan?

A. I knew of him as an Assistant Director in charge
of Domestic Intelligence Divisian. As a section
chief of another division I had no occasion to

deal with him. His activities appeared to be along

speech making and editorial lines.
2. Q. How many times did you go to his office?

A. None.

3. How many times did he come to your office?

A. None.

4, Q.' Didn't he disagree with Parsons as to the role or
the adequacy of the Laboratory scientists?

A. I believe that at one time he challenged the
adequacy of the Laboratorys' contact with outside
concerns. If that is what you had in mind, all I
can say is that I prepared an outline of the con-
tacts which we had and they were most impressive.
They ranged from all the military research est-
ablishments through the commercial radio and re-
search companies such as Texas Instruments, etc.
Our section actually excelled in this type of
contact to “keep abreast" of a rapidly changing
field, I heard no more from Parsons or others
after submitting my list.

5+ Qs Who assisted you during your tenure as section chief?!

A. A. J. Baker.

E. Training.
1. Q. Did your people furnish any training to field agents? |

A. Special training was furnished to selected agents
so that they could serve as contacts in each field
office,! alerting the section to parts needs,check-
ing the readiness of field equipment, advising of
equipment needs, aiding in the input to the annual
field budget preparation by the section as well
as assisting in planning. These agents, in the
main also carried their full case loads and were
under the local Agent in Charge, not the section.

F. Recording Facility.

1. Where was this facility physically located with
regards to your office?

A. Physically separated by being in another corridor
across the Justice Building.

2. Q Not in the 7114 corridor?

A. Correct.

36 Q. Were agents offices attached thereto?

A. Yes, a couple of bays.

4, Q. Who had access? :

A. Corridor doors were locked at all times but agents
had access with keys. Facility doors were locked
separately within that space.

5+ 4 Was someone in that space at all times during the
day?

Most of the time. We tried to keep someone available



@ _. @

in the space in that neither Baker or myself were
qualified to operate the patch.panel and recording
equipment and a Directors speech might have to be 1
recorded on short notice. This was somewhat difficult

in that the work assigned to these people in the form
of security checks for government officials tele-

phones and room security checks for such areas as hearing rooms

65360 Docld:32989634 Page 201

necessitated that the work be done outside of the
office space.
6. Q. Were these men fully occupied?

A. Yes.

7. Qs How did you know they were fully occupied?

A. By an administrative assignment system, kept one
year and then destroyed after statistics were com-
piled. Also by closely following the work load
and making adjustments to keep the 3 to 4 hour
overtime on an equitable basis.

8. Q. How do you know that someone couldn't make a
“composite” tape without your knowledge - and give
a specific example of why not.

A. As pointed out earlier, I was not present 24 hours
a day and therefore could not continuously mon-
itor the displaced space. Within reason, however,
for statistical purposes we needed to document our
input. This was done by assignment slip as it came
through the office by Baker or myself and in some
instances the paper work was done confirmatory
when, the work was started on an urgent assignment «
orally. An effort was made early in the time period
as section chief, in 1955, 1956, to clearly
establish this procedure thereby avoiding persons
bringing work of any kind directly to a section
employee. The staff was repeatedly made aware of the
desired procedure. The only specific instance I
can recall occurred early in my tenure, possibly
in 55 or '56 when it was necessary to personally
challenge someone outside the section who was
bringing work directly to a section employee. What
the work was is not important. The bypass of pro-
cedure was. I was called by phone and went im-
mediately to the studio area on the other side
of the building and advised the person that the
proper procedure was not being followed, The person
departed and no further problem existed.

9. Q. Who was this person?
A. I believe it was Inspector Kemper.
10. Q. Who called you in this instance?

A. I can't recall that detail 20 years ago but it
would probably have been someone normally
assigned to that area, such as Matter or Corbett.

11. Q. Could it have been dise records or album material?

A. It could have been but the material was not the

prime concern,. the procedure was.
12. Q. Was a memo written?
No. The immediate action corrected the problem.



13. Q. Would a "trained" field agent be able to
operate filter equipment? :
A. No.
14. Q. Would Matter be able to operate filter
equipment?
A. Yes.

G. Procedures.
1. Q. If a request to handle material came from a
field office would it have a case caption?

A. Yes, to identify it with files and witk the
divisions supervising the case.

26 Q. Would you ever receive recordings from an
outside source?

A. Yes. Periodically from the military on crashes
of test planes, as for example where the pilot
was trying to tell what was wrong but the in-
telligence on the tape recording made on the
ground was garbled by over riding noises,
Filtering techniques could, at times, success~
fully bring out the message through time con-
suming procedures. In these instances, because
of the excessive manpower demands it was necess-
ary to borrow radio engineers and sometimes nearby
trained Washington Field personneyto work on the
separate small portions of the quéstioned tape
to expedite the report back to the contributor.

3. Q. Did you have anything to do with codes and
ciphers?

A. None, handled by another section.

4, Q. What about field recordings?

( Note: Since Mr. Hoover had announced in
public that at one time some 98 technical
surveillances were in operation, it follows
that the Bureau had some training and operated
some equipment in this area of operations.)

A. All offices were self sufficient with regard to i
playback and recording equipment. In Kidnapping
eases, for example, the equipment would be
needed on an immediate basis, hence, in my view
it was unsatisfactory for an office to "borrow"
when needed from another office or request that
the headquarters in Washington send what they
need. Accordingly no "stock" was held here. The
field inventoried and maintained it.

H. Martin Luther King.
1. 4. Did you know in the period around 1961 that the

Bureau was investigating Mr. King?

A. No, as a support or service facility we would
not be envolved in field work unless there were
equipment or support problems. None were recalled.

2. Q. Did you instruct that a "composite" tape be made
on Mr. King?

A. No.
3. Q@. I have inferences that you did. Did you?
A. I did not. 6

4, Q@. Is it possible that someone could make-a tape
without your knowledge?



A. It is possible, but not a probable situation.
As indicated, the section was in two separate
parts with the voiceprint, filtering, recording |
and related test equipment located across the
puilding away from my office. Possible, of
course, but minimized by a need to keep close
accounting of our work from an administrative
and statistical standpoint to assist in just-
ifying our existence and our programs to the
satisfaction of the inspection staff.

5 Q. Have you since heard of investigations of Mr. Kin,

by the Bureau?
A. Through media references recently.

6. @. Did you see material coming through your office
for handling captioned "Martin Luther King"?

A. I did not.

7. Q. Did you see materials coming through your office
for handling captioned "Civil Rights Inves-
tigations or Matters"?

A. I did not.

y

I. Miscellaneous Items.
1. @. Did Mr. Hoover have technical recorders?

A. I recall none during my tenure of 1955-1965. He
was basically opposed to technical things in
that he tended to avoid those items which he
did not fully understand. Accordingly, much
administrative effort was expended in explain-
ing technical things, such as the need for radio
antennas, in laymans language which could be
fully understood.

2. ITEM. A long list of names was observed. Some
questions about, people came from this list
such as Pfafmans* reference.

3. ITEM, The period of interest appeared to be in
the 1961 or thereabouts era. It is noted that
the person being interviewed is being asked to
recall details occurring 14 or 15 years in the

past.

Ret Interview of FDI Special Agent (SA)
Seynor Fred Phillips by SSC Staff Menbers

At the vory outset, Phillips was asked to sim aie.
Statenent entitled “ADVICE OF RIGHTS" which he did and it was
witnessed by Epstein in Phillips' presence, Epstein stated
that he would check with the Committee concerning the sccuring
of 2 copy to give to Phillips. Thereafter, Phillips made the
dollowing opening rewarks to the S8C personnel, Phillips
advised that in an effort to assist the SSC, he was informing
then that his supervision of the former FBI investigation of
Martin Luther King, Jv. at FBi Headquarters (IQ) was tron
roughly very Inte in 1963 to the Fall of 1965, [is personnl
knowledge was confined to roughly that period. The interrogators
were given to understand by Phillips that the discussion to
ensue Would concern a period of 10 to 12 years ago and that
Phillips' replies must be considered in that context. Phillips
indicated that he would to the best of his ability give his
best recollections in response to questions. Phillips also
stated that his interrogators should understand that during
the intervening years iilips had been indirectly exnosed
to much information relating te the hing investigation.
Puillips gave two examples to illustrate.

He brought to attention the fact that he had been
exposed over the years to many media accounts relating to the
King iavestigation. A noteworthy one was a feature article
which nppearcd in "fhe New York Times" in early 1075. A second
exanple of Dhillins' exposure to information concerning the
Kilag investigation volated to Caillips' current FOI assignnont
of which both Epstein and DeOreo were fully cognizant. Phillips
pointed out that this assignment has exposed him to a vast
amount of information, both documentary and that being furnished
orally to the SSC by various witnesses. As a consequence,
Puillips pointed out the difficulty which he expected to encounter
in answering questions because it would take very studied
thought in many instances to differentiate in his mind informa-
tion which he had acquired in the supervision of the King case
and information which might have come to his attention during
the subsequent years, particularly the past few wonths in
connection with his current assignment.

Roz Interview of PRE Special Agent (SA)
Seymor Fred Phillips by SSC Staff Membors

Phillips then went on to point out what he understood
to be the parameters of this interview, which were as follows,
The interview was te concorn tho King investigation only. The
interview was to exclude information which was the product
or fruit of all electronic surveillances through which the FBI
obtaincd information concerning King. In mentioning this
privileged area, Phillips again emphasized the difficulty he
would likely have in soxting out information ho has in terms
of how he first acquired it. He emphasized that if he recognized
that his answer to a question would require divulging information
fxvom an olectronic surveillance, ho would not answer that
question. Finally, Faillips pointed out what he considered
the. four privileged arens concerning which he did not intend
fo answer questions. ‘These wore as follows: (1) Information
which identifies or could identify a confidential source.

@) Information which might adversely affect ongoing FBI
investigations. (3) Information obtained from third agencies,
including forcign intelligence agencies, (4) information
revealing sensitivo investigative methods and techniques,

(The exclusion of discussing information from clectronic
surveillances is based upon current negotiations between the
SSC, the Department of Justice and an attorney for the widow
of King. It is the FDI's understanding that the King attorney
agreed to the interview provided Phillips did not disclose
information from clectronic surveiliances .}

Phillips indicated that he anticipated the interview
to bo prolonged and that he anticipated that it would be tiring
because of the unusual factors involved as discussed above. -
He therefore requested that in ordex to avoid weariness on his
part, which would be counterproductive to the SSC's obtaining
mazinum benefits from the interview, consideration be given to
breaking up the interview on a general basis of two hours, a
prent: for lunch, and then another two hours. He indicated that
ag the interview progressed, he would be floxiblo on this but
felt that the interview, if morc than one day Jong, should not
exceed four and one-hal£ hours on any one day. Epstein indicated
agreenent with this request and the basis for it,

The following are the results of the interviow which
are sot out gonernily in chronological order.

Phillips was asked for a dotailed biography of his
PBI carcer which ho velated to ko the foliowing. Ue started
in the FOI.on Cctokor 28, 1940, in a clerical capacity in the
Identification Division. On March 18, 1946, he was appointed
an &A and served in Wield Gffiecs (76) in Philadelphia,
Pennsylvania; Detroit, Michigan; and Washington, D.C. (WFO).
In the Spring of 1954, he was assigned to HQ and served.in the
Coneral Invostigativo, Training and inspcetion Divisions until
tho Sumiex of 1958, In the Summor of 1055, ho was transforred
to the Buffalo, New York, FO where he sorved until the Sumner
of 1961, when he was transferred back to IQ. Simce then he has
been continually assigned to tho Intelligence Division CINTD).
(INTD formerly, and during the time of the King investigation
diseussed herein, was known as the Domestic Intolligence
Division /DID/.)

Dotailed questions wore asked and vrosponses made by
Phillips volating to the organigational makeup of the DID
starting in 1961 ond the various scctions and units he had
been assigned to over the years. He indicated that when he
first joined the DID he was assigned to the Internal Security
Scetion and specifically to the Communist Party Unit, Et —
was while in this Unit that Phillips took on supervision of
the King case and he continucd that supervision while serving
subsequently in a unit ospceoinally devolored to concentrate on
investigations relating te the communist influences in racial
matters, it was his best recoliection that the Unit actually
might have been named Communist Influcnce in Racinl Matters
Unit (CIRM). .

Phillips was asked for and supplied the names of
his work associates in the DED during the pertinent period of
1968-65. These included individuals at various levels within
the DID as well as FBI officiais of a still higher level.
The following are the names of individuals given by Phillips
and in those instances where he was aware of their current
whereabouts, Phillips also gave that information on Epstein's
request: Theodore Rosack, Richard Bates, Willian Shubatt,
Jones Martin, (first none unrecalled) Corman, Charlos Brennan,

worked with, over, or under Phiilips during the pertinent
period, including the tine he first was assigned to the DID
in LOGL.

Phillips pointed out in respect to Lelmont that 1t
wag his understanding that Beimont is in an extremely i111
condition and it was suggested that if the SSC had any intention
toa interview Lelnont, it would be wise to first check with his
physician. In the same context, Phillips pointed out the
following in reSpect to Fred Fox. This individual was Phillips’
Unit Chico? when he was first assigned in the DID and it was
belioved by Palilips that Fox had already leit the section when
Paillips was first assigned the Kine case. Consequently, it
was not believed that Vox would be knowledgeable in this matter.
Moreover, Paillips pointed out that Fox was a personal fviend
and that Fox had suivered a very tragie loss of his spouse
earlier this year, As a result, Tox has been in somewhat deep
grief and it was suggested by Phillips that he might not be
an ideal subject for interview,

Re: Interview of FBI Special Agent (SA)
Seymor Fred Phillips by SSC Staff Members

There was considerable discussion generated by
questions concerning the organizational makeup in the various
units in the Internal Security Section as well as concerning the
routing of mail through the various levels. It was esplnined
by Phillips how mail would be generated at a supervisory level
up through o Unit Chief and then to the Section Front Office.
At that point it might be handled by either or both the
Section Chief and his Number One Man. If the mail was not
*eut off, meanings approved for mailing, tho mail would move
to the Division Front Office where it would be seen by either
one or both the Assistant Director and Number One Man.
Inportant nail would, of course, move beyond that level to the
office of the Assistant to the Director and thence, in some
instances,to the Associate Director and the Director himself,

Phillips was asked to identify clerical personnel
who worked for hin when he headed up the Unit dealing with
CIRM. We named one Individual who he indicated had been
Secretary to the Unit Chief in the Communist Party Unit and
who, to the best of his recollection, also served for a time
as Phillips' secretary. This individual was then named
Kathieen Osborne, later married name Jensen; now divorced and
remarried, last name unknown. Questioning was diverted before
Phillips named any other clerical personnel.

The foregoing phase of the interview which covered
organizational matters, routing of mail, identities of personnel,
etc,, covered about an hour and fifteon minutes, At this
point, Epstein indicated that he would now proceed to discuss
the investigation of King.

Ro: Interview of NPI Special Agent (SA)
Seymor Fred Phillips by SSC Staff Nembers

His questioning elicited the following background
in this investigation as khest Phillips could recall it. It
was explained that during the period in question, 1963-65,
the Internal Security Section handled investigations primarily
only in the domestic intelligence field, Investigations of
sone key leaders of subversive groups were also handied
in that Section. There was thon in existence in the DID a
Section known as the Subversive Control Section which
Suporviscd basically the investigations of donestic subversive
individuals. The King case was assigned in the Subversive
Contral Section when Phillips was first exposed to it and was
assigned specificaliy to a Supervisor named William Forsyth
(honetic}, now deceased. For a time, the case was jointiy
handied by hoth Forsyth and Phillips and eventually, for ail
practical purposes, it was supervised by Phillips alone.
This was brought about by the nature of the emphasis boing
placed by the FBI on the communist influonces in the racial
movenent which were coming te the FBRits attention by investiga~
tion and otherwise. Bocause of this, it was determined at
a point in time that there be crented within the Internal
Security Section a CIRM Unit and that there be vested in it
xelated investigations such as that concerning King.

Et might bo noted that at one point during the
extensive organizational phase of the interview, Phillips
reminded Epstein of his bolic£ that ho was furnishing Epstein
considerably more information than required within the agroed
paranoters of the interview. Phillips indicated, however, that
ho was willing to do’so as on exhibition of good faith and
gooperativeness not only on his part, but as relating to tho FST.

Discussion turned to tho character used in correspondence
in the investigation of King and of the organization which King
headed, the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC).
Fhillips explaincd that to the best of his recollection, tho
character of the Ming ease was Sh-C (Sccurity Hatter « Communist)
and the character of the SCLC case wos IS-C (internal Security ~.
Communist). Epstein inquired as to whether there was a Tile

in the FRI concerning lirs., Ming and was told that Phillips
did not know, Epstein inquired as to whether there was moro
than one main file on King and the SCLC and was told that
Faillips did not know of any more than one.

Inquiry was made as to whom the SCLC was assigned.
Phillips explained that the case concerning the SCLC was of
o Coninfil (communist infiltration) type. Consequently, this
case was assigned in a unit specializing in cosnunist
infiltration-typo cases. The Unit Chief was John Kleinkaut
but to Phillips’ best recollection, the case later was assigned
in the CIRM Unit. .

Epstein inquircd as to when the King caso was. opened
and what the date of tha first piece of paper in that case bore.
The sane questions were asked coacorning caso on the SCLC ond on
Stanley David Lovison. Paillipa stated that he did not know
the answers to these questious. As to the character of the
Levison case, Phillips replied that he thought it was SH-C,

Inquiry was made as to whose idea it was to have a
CIR Unit ond Phillips stated he did not reeall.

Guestions wore asked about the FBI's analysis of the
sfveh on Vashington which took place in August, 1963, and of
uuy papers which were writton about it. It was obvious that
Epstein was aware that some "Drief” or similar analysis document
about the vacial situation at the time was prepared in the For.
Phillips explained that after the March on Washington, soue
documents were prepared in the form of summary or analysis and
that the March on Washington was also part of an extensive
MByief" which was proparcd as an in-house document covering
tho whole subject of communist in?luences in the racial movement.

inquiry was made as to when the Lirst piece of paper
eithor in the field or at HQ was written for technical
surveillance of King and the SCLC. Phillips onplained that hic
best recepliection concerning a microphone Burvedlianes Grisur)
concerning King was after th 2

and that after the operation |
told by one of his superiors, probably cithor Suilavan, Sizoo
oy Gaunigardner, to oxpoct the receipt of somo vaper from WFO.
Phillips was told that once received, Phillips would he cxpocted
to prepare a communication suitable xor disscizination whieh
would summxico the findings from the misur. Pililips was
asked as to the form he had received the information from WFO
nnd his best recollection was that there was possibly a cover
communication such as an airtel with an cnelosed lettorhead
memorandum (LHM)}, Epstein wanted to know if there were any
enclosures to the LUM and Phillips said he had no recolicection
of same. In responding is to how Phillips acquired this
mitorini, he said he did not roeall such but felt fairly eortain
that he did not receive it through routine mail channels,
Phillips pointed out that this was a case receiving special
handling and because of the sensitive nature of the inforuation,
the material may well have been handied by hand delivery to

him by cither someone from WKO or by one of his superiors such
as any of the three mentioned above. Asked whether he had
subsequently roecived actual tapes on this coverage, Phillips
pnid that ho had, Asked how soon afterwards tha tapes wero
xccoived, Phillips caid ho could not recall,

Questioning then turned to what Phillips prepared

Suitable for dissemination from the material which WFO had fur~
nished, Phillips explained that his best recollection was that

he took the LHM fxvom WFO and rewrote it. In other words, he
crented an UQ-originated LM. Asked why this was done rather than
use the one prepared by WO, Phillips explained that there miy have
beon two ox throa yoasons for doing so. Yor oxampic, the ono
propared by WFO nay not have beon written in sufficiently good

style for the type of dissemination that was intended. It

might also have had typographical errors and the like, Asked

to whom the LOM which Phillips prepared was disseminated, he
responded to his best recollection it was disseminated only to
The White House at that time. Asked if it was later disseminated
to anyone else, he said he did not know that it was but that
information in it was later incorporated into a second LH,

along with new-found information and that the second LHM was
disscninated to both The White House and to the then Attorney
General (AG) Robert Kennedy. Asked as to whotelse it was
disseminated, Phillips could not recall anyone else, Phillips
was questioned about the procedure for disseminating to The
White House and the AG and explained that it might possibly

have been done by use of a single LHH prepared in sufficient
number and then sent to The White House with one cover conmunica~
tion and simultancously, another copy sent to the AG with another
cover communication, It would havo been common practice at the
time to have included in cach cover communicstion information
indicating who else was receiving the same LOM,

Phillips was asked if any new information which
prompted the second Li had arisen from a misur. Phillips said
that it had but at this point veminded Epstein that he would
not bo able to discuss contents pursuant to the agreements and
arrangements discussed earlier in this memorandum. Epstein
wanted to know exactly which misur pronpted the second LIfl and
Phillips said he could not pinpoint which misur. LIpstein ~
wanted to Inow how many misurs the FBI had had on King and
Phillips said that he would only be able to give a rough
estimate. Epstein wanted to know the number even if it was

only a rough £i he was told that it would possibly have
been between possibly toward the lower end of that
scale.

which wos likely documented and that the SSC would get this
docuncnted inioraution when agreenents were perfected with the
Kang attorney. On this oceasion, Lpstein reminded Phillips
that notwithstanding any documentation the SSC receives, it
nevertheless desires Phillips’ recollection of events,

Inquiry was made as to whether there were any misurs
ou King outside of the country. Phillips said he knew of none
and went on to remind Epstein that the FBI was nonoperationalL
abroad and that if there was a misur on King abroad, it might
have been put on by o Loreign intelligence agency and that
such an agency was a privileged area for discussion during
the interview. In making this statement to Epstein, Phillips
Said he did not want Epstein to infer that there were misurs
outside the United States concerning King that Phillips knew
about.

Inquiry was made concerning photographic surveillance
on Hing and Paillips said there had bcon some but it was very
linited. Asked if any of it was in a notel or hotel room
including through closed circuit TV, Phillips said he knew of
none. Asked where the pLutographic surveillances were that
Phillips knew of, Phillips said he remembered some pictures
being taken in Los Angeles outside of a hotel and at the
aixport. Asked whether they were stilis or movies, Phillips
indicated they wore of possibly both types.

Epstein inquired as to whether there were any
photographic surveillancesby other agencies, Federal, state
or local as well as by any foreign agencies. Phillips said he
knew of none. Phillips reminded Epstein, however, that the
newspapers had many pictures of King leading marches and in other
Similar public activities and that as a consequence, local agencies
night well have taken pictures of King but that it would be
very questionable as to whether they could be justifiably
categorized as pictures derived from photographic survoillances.

Seymor Fred Phillips by SSC StafZ Members

Phillips was asked as to what wiretaps or telephone
surveillances he was eware of concerning King. We responded
that there was a telephone survoillance (tesur) on King at his
residence in Atlanta, Georgia, and that when the authority from
the AG for this was obtained, the language of the communication
was such as to pecmit a tesur in other places which might
be considered “vyesidences" inasmuch as King traveled around
the country a good bit. Phillips was unable to answer as
to how many such tesurs therc were ov exactly where they were.

Regarding the SCLC, Phillips indicated that the tesurs
were at its offices in Atlanta and New York City.

Asked whether there were any nail covers or openings
on King, Phillips said he knew of none,

Asked when the first wirotap on King was operative,
Phillips indicated that it was after the FBI bad secured the
AG's approval but Phillips could not recall the date. Asked
when the last wiretap was operative, Phillips said he did not
know and that it could have keen after the supervision of the
case Was no longer in his hands.

It was roughly at this point in the interview that
the luncheon break occurred and what follows was in the
afternoon session.

Enstein inquired as to whether all of the misurs were
separately authorized by Director J. Edgar Hoover himself.
Phillips said he did not think this was so. Asked whether there
was some document at HQ on each misur which would show the
authorization, Phillips said he felt that there was. He was
asked what percentage of all the misurs was authorized by
Hoover himself and Phillips said he could not even estimate
such a percentage. Epstein asked who would owthorize 2 misur

the macs of Associate Divector Clyde Tolson (deccased) and
of the following previously mentioned above -~ Eelnont,
Sullivan, Inspector Sizoo and Baungardner -- as others who
might havo nade the authorizations. Epstein wanted to know
whother there was any letter of delegation by Uoover by
which others would have taken the authority for such an
netion and Faillips said he knew of none.

Ramerous questions were vshed relating to the
procedures for obtainine authority for a nisur and whether those
proccdures were actually in sone writtcon document. Phillips
exploined that he hed no recollection of any such procedure
ever boing in the [ispual of Mules and Rogulations or the Manual
of instructions but that the procedures night have been docuncnted
in sone policy folder although Faillips had no dofinite recol~
Lection of the procedurcs being in writing. Thevt’ is, Phillips

Re: Interview of ILI Special Arent (SA)
Seynor Fred Phillips by SSC Staff Members

In discussing the authority for misurs, Phillips
explained that im 1954, the then 4G, Nerbort Brownell, submitted
& menorundun to the FLI which in effect gave AG authority into
Koover's hands in cases of this nature and that the procedures
in effect provided within the Bureau for lesser officials to
have the authority, This would have included down to the level
of Section Chief Baumgardner in this case.

Phillips further explained that after a certain point
in time, and the best he could place this would have been in
1965, 2 procedure went into effect to write a communication to
the AG on each misur. The intention at the time was, to
Phillips’ best recollection, to get the AG's advance authority.
However, as a practical matter, it was not feasible many times
to get the AG's authority in advance. ‘Some situations would
be so fast moving and the sensitive and security aspects would
be such that it would not be possible to get such authority
in advance, In such a situation, an immediate communication
would be written to the AG cxplaining to hin that the installation
wag made without bis advance authovity because time was of the
essence. Under such circumstances, it would not be uncommon for
that conaunication advising the AG of the misur to also advise
hin of its discontinuance. For exampic, a misur might be
installed one morning to cover a day's activities and the misur
night be withdrawn the same night or next morning. In such ao
Situation, one communication to the AG would advise of both
the installation and withdrawal of the misur.

Epstein asked whether, when the proccdure for advising
the AG of all misurs went into effect, the 4G was told of all
prior misurs which had been in effect, Phillips stated he did
not know the precise answer to this question but told Epstein
that the AG at the time of the King misurs (Robert Kennedy) was
aware of the misur coverage on King becauso he, Kennedy, had
seen the product of the misurs, Phillips emphasized that the
product wags such that there should havo been no doubt in the AG's
mind but that « misur had been in effect on King. At a point

in tho questioning not kong after this was explained to Epstein,
Epstein again asked how the AG would know of the misurs if

the product of the misurs not only in Lillis but also in monographs.

Phillips was usked if the AG was shown any logs or
vexrbatin transcripts from the misurs or whether any of the tapes
thercirom hud been ployed back to hin, PBuillips said he did
not know,

At a point in the questioning which was after what
Phillips felt was a third time he had explained to Epstein
that fvom information furnished to Kennedy, there should have
been no doubt in Kennedy's mind that the FBI had misurs on King,
Epstein asked if the AG might not have thought the product was
the vosult of a tesur vather than 2 misur, "RE this point,
Phillips displayed annoyanco to Fpstein and told hin that he had
answered the question threo times and, therefore, refused to
answer it any further. Epstein mumbled something to the
eficct that Phillips had not auswered the question and Fpstein
nade some note, apparently to that effect. Phillips told hin
that he, Phillips, thought he had answered the question
regardless of what Epstein was recording in his notes.

Questioning turned to the preparation of memoranda
concering misurs and praia xplained that he had participated
in asked when the first misur

took place
he could not remenbe: Mony questions were asked concerning the
various authorizations for the misurs and the related paper.

Phillips explaincd the procedures as te the recording of such
information in memoranda and who might actually prepare such
memoranda. Phillips explained that he himself might have
weitten such a memorandum but that they might also have been
written by any of several individuals suporior to Phillips in
rank. Epstein askod if all memoranda vecording authority for
misurs included a predication or basis for the misur. Phillips
indicated that such memoranda should have had such information
in it and that the information forming the basis would have
generally rolated to the security aspects which wore the basis
for the King investigation.

Epstoin asked if thore was anything in file which
would show that Hoover was ever concerned that he was not
porsonally making 211 of the authorizations for the misurs.
Phillips said he did not know of any such information in file.
Epstein asked whether the inspection Division ever leoked into
the fact that authorizations were being made by other than
Hoover himsel£. Phillips responded that he did not recall
this ever being an issue during an inspection,

At this point in the interview, Phillips indicated
that he was finding himself tiring, particularly because the
morning session had been in 2 very warm room. ‘Therefore, at
approximately 3:17 p.m., Phillips asked that the interview be
prought to an early conclusion for the day and Epstein said that
he could stop at that point to resumc at 10:00 a.m, the noxt day.

Phillips agreed to this and then reopened discussion
concerning the "ADVICE OF RIGHTS" statement which Phillips had
signed at the onset of the interview. Phillips told Epstoin
that he wanted a copy of the statement he had signed ond
desired to have it the noxt morning when the interview was to

some ducstion as to whether the interview would resume.

The continuation of the August 4, 1975, inteorviow
proceeded on August 5, 1075, with the same two SOC Starr
Benbers as interrogators. On the latter date, the intervicw
was in the same room as the afternoon session on August 4, 1075.

vaguoly that at one time, AG Kennedy asked the FBI to look
into the matter for ofiecting olectronic survoillance of King.
Tho mattox was looked into and the BL askcd for tho AG's
authority for on installation, Nowever, the AG refused the
vequoest. Sometinc Intor the PSI again asked for authority and
this tine the AG approved it.

Phillips wos questioned concerning the predication or
basis for an clectronic survoilleance which would bo contained
in tho request documont to tho AG. Epstein specifically wanted
to know what the prodieation, if any, containcd and iz such
prodieations wore always aliko. Phillips responded that tho
predications addrossed themselves in the aren of national
security but that ho could not remenbor tho specific language
used. It was his recolicction that they probably took up the
mattor of the comuumist inzluences on King. Phillips could not
remember whether the predications wore all alike but felt in a
gonoral context, they probably wore. Me was asked if, when a
predication addrossed itself to communist influences, it vould
actually mano persons. Phillips said he thought so ond that
tha predications would probably at least nance onc person.

Asked who tho persons night be, Phillips enid that they would
have possibly named Stanley David Levison.

Upstein asked if Phillips boeanco knowledgeable of
Levison and the response was that he did. Ho was asked how
he had learned about Lovison and Phillips said ho did not
romonboxy procisoly how, Ho was asked 12 he had secon conmunica=
tions concerning Levison mnd ho acknowledged that he had.
Ho was asked if the invostigation of Levisonu roflectcd his
travels and Phillips said that it did to an extent,

At this point, after a sexics of questions concerning
Levicon, Phillips rominded Epstein of tho following. First,
the subject of Lovison as such was outside the paraneters of the
intorvicv. Second, in discussing Lovison, Dpstein was gotting
eLese to details concorning Lovisen and Phillips wanted to
advise hin that he, Phillips, would not ba abic to respond on

Phillips was asked if he knew of 211 of Levison's
travel and he said that he did not think so,

in handling correspondence on misurs, Phillips was
asked if the belief that Levison would be in the same city as
King would serve as a predication. Phillips responded that if
the FBI had such information, it would likely have heen used.

Epstein's next questions concerned misurs generally
and again emphasized the matter of predications in corrcspondence.
Epstein wanted to know whether ail such coxrespondence
justifying misurs would have predications and Paillips said
that to the best of his recollection they would. Epstein then
icunched a theoretical discussion about the possible use of
blanket" authorizations by having one memorandum cover many
situations. Phillips told him he did not vemember there being
any such "blanket" authorizations and that to his best recol-
lection, there would have keen prepared separate paper for
separate nisurs,

Guestion was asked as to whether any physical
surveillanees (fisur) were instituted in connection with the
nisurs and Phillips thought that there would have been on sone
occasion. He was asked if the fisurs revealed any King-Levison
meetings when the fisurs were in connection with misurs.
Phillips said he did not remember any which were connected with
a aisur but that he recalied at least one fisur which was on
oither King or Lovison, or otherwise, and that King and Levison
Were observed together. Phillips emphasized that in this
instance, it was his recollection it was not in connection with
a misur.

Epstein inquired as to the reason for the transfer of
Phillips from the King case to another section and another
branch in the DID, (It shouwld be noted that during the

Security Scetion whore le had been handling the King ease to
the branch in the 019 which handled foreign intelligence
natters, Phillips’ specific assignment was to the Section he
best recalled as tho Cesearch-Satellite Section and he assumed
the responsibilities of Unit Chief in a Unit specializing in
investigations relating to Soviet-bioc countries, particularly
as to Luncarian-type eases which were assigned to Puillips,)
In answex to Cpstoin's question as to reason for transfer,
Poillips told hin that his question was not german: to the
King investigation, Phillips also told hin that he, Phillips,
had no specific reason to not tell Epstein the circumstances
of the transfer but that Phillips would just not discuss it
with hin because it did not pertain to the King investigation,

Phillips was asked 1f he had received the tapes
velating to King misurs and he said that he had. Ue was asked
why they were sent to hin. He responded that at a point in
tine, it was believed that for security reasons, if for no other,
all the tapes from the misurs should ke assenbled at one place
at HQ and that as a consequence, the appropriate field offices
were instructed to send them in. These tapes were retained
unter the control of and charged to Assistant Director Sullivan
ablthouch they wore maintained in Paillips' office which was
acxoss the hall from Sullivan's. The reasons Tor this mothod
of handling were the following. First, the tapes would thus
be more accessible to Phillips who was the supervisor of the
King case. Second, there was the metter of space considerations,
Sullivan's office bad little extra space whereas Phillips'
office had the necessary space as well os a safe-typo cabiact
in which to retain the tapes,

Phillips was asked where the tapes were retained in

to the Laboratory and ho caid he could not remember. Asked
why ho had sent then to the Laboratory, he said he had not boon
told the roason but he had been moroly instructed to send thon
to the Laboratory, There was extensive questioning of Phillips
concorning the selective process, that is, why or how certain
of tha tapes were picked to send te the Laboratory. Epstein
wanted to know if tho sclection was based on contont, places
involved ox other criteria, Phillips said he could not recail
the selective process or in what words the instructions came
to him ta physically romovo certain tapes from the cabinot and
sond then to tho Laborntory, Wo was asked about the actual
procedure of sending them to tho Laboratory and he pointed out
that they wore undoubtedly not sent through the mall vowtinoly.
Ii was his best reeollection that they probably were hand
enarried and that this could have beon accomplished by any of
several people, oither individuals saaiteiaa with Phillips or
working in the Laboratory,

Phillips was asked if be was told or ho later askod
the purpose of sending tho tapos ta the Laboratory and his
ansywex was "No." Phillips was next asked when he had learned
the purpose .of sending the tapes was to make a composite and
ho said he did not recall, Ho was osked how he had Learned of
the composite. Phillips explained that when the tapes wore
returned to him, thero were one or more than the number he had
sent to the Laboratory. This fact concerning oxtra tapes was
Eurythor undoxvscorcd to him when he noted that on the one or moro
extra tapss the word “couposite" appoared on the box or boxos
along with perhaps some other verbiage.

Phillips said he had no distinct rocollcction that he had, He

in making the composite, were all or only some of the tapes

used; and of tapes used, were all or only portions used. Ilis
answer was to the best of his recollection, the composite was
only of portions of somo of the tapes. He was asked the number
of composites made and he said he believed only one was made

but that there was more than one copy of it made. He was

asked what he did with the composite (s) and said it or they
would have been put away with the others in the safe-type cabinet.

Phillips was asked if he ever told anyone about
having seen 2 composite and he said that he had. Arked who
he had told, he said he could not vecail but it would have been
logical for him to have told one or more of the following
of his superiors; Section Chief Caumpardnex, Inspector Sizoo,
Assistant Director Sullivan.

Phillips was asked if he had inquired of anyone
concerning the composite and he said that he had probably asked
a Laboratory SA, John Matter, about it. Ue chose Matter
because it was fron Matter that he had received the tapes on
their return to Phillips. At that point, when Phillips received
nove than he had sent, he felt the one to ask would be the one
who bad returned the tapes to hin, This inguiry by Phillips of
Matter gained little information for Phillips. It was rhillipst
hest recollection thet Matter indicated he had heen given an
assignacnt relative to the tapes and the preparation of a
composite from a high ranking superior, unnanucd by Matter, and
that Matter was thus sworn to secrcey. VPalllips pressed Matter
no iurther. Asked how Jons Phillips had kept the composite (s),
¥hiLLips said retection was for as lons as he had hod the case
assigned to him and the composite (s) remained in the cabinet
at the time Phillips left this case. Phillips was asked if the

he could not recall any such removal other than as discussed ahove.

As to the composite specifically, Phillips was asked whether

it ever left the cabinet and he said that to his best recollection,
it had not. He was asked if he had ever again at some later

date come in contact with the tapes. Phillips responded that

in early 1975, he had been assioned to update an inventory of
sensitive material relating to King, including the tapes, and

that he would have had come in contact with them under these
circunstances,

At this point in the interview, Phillips indicated to
Epstein that if Epstein would be a bit more candid, Phillips
felt he could be more helpful to him. Epstein's response was
that he would just keep asking questions.

In connection with the 1975 inventory, Phillips was
asked whether he felt any tapes were missing and he said that
he did not recail that to be the case. He was asked when the
last previous inventory (previous to 1975) was taken and he
said he did not know.

Epstein asked when Phillips first learned the purpose
for making the composite. Phillips responded, "Did I ever say
I knew the purpose?" Epstein then said, "OK, did you ever learn
the purpose?" Phillips responded, “Don’t ask me when I stopped
beating my wife."

Epstein then again asked if Phillips had ever learned
the purpose and Phillips responded that he had not. He was asked
if anyone had evor told him the purpose and he answered in the
negative. le was asked what was done with the composite and

Many questions were asked concerning the sending of
nisur tapes to the Laboratory. They concerned how they were
sent, which ones were Sent, to whom they wero sent and how
many times they wero sent. Phillips said that they were given
special handling and were probably hand carried and that he did
not precisely recall which ones other than the WFO tapes,
Phillips recalled sending to the Laboratory for use by SA William
Campbell certain tapes. At the time, Campbell was assigned
to WFO, Phillips did not recall how many times he had sent
tapes to the Laboratory.

Epstein asked concerning the decision to make trans-
cripts of ail the tapes after Puillips bad indicated that tapes
had been sent to tho Laboratory for two purposes. Onc purpose
was possibly for the preparation of the composite and the other
was to have a written transcript available of a11 misur tapes.

as to whether he was aware of any COINTELPRO (Counterintelligenco

activities and Phillips said that it was not clear as to what
Epstein meant by other activities, but that if dissemination
was another activity, the FBI did disseminate information
about King. He was asked if any information about King was

point, Phillips chose to not answer the question.

Phillips was asked what activities the FBI engaged in
regarding King and the SCLC other than the collection of and
dissomination of intelligence. Phillips’ response was that in-
sofar as the SCLC was concerned, this subject was outside the
parameters of the interview. As for the hing case, Phillips
felt that the question was too general to be answered by hin.

Ipstein asked if Phillips recalled a meeting at LQ

been such a meeting or conference but that he did not attend

Re: Interview of FBI Special Agent (SA)
Seymor Pred Paillips by SSC Staff Nenbers

investigation resulted from the conference and Phillips said
that nothing stands out in his mind along this line. He was
asked if investigation of King was intensified as a reault

of the conference, Phillips’ response was that in the period
following the conference, say for one or two years, there was
nore investigation of King than in the like period preceeding
the conference. Uowever, Phillips noted that he could not
say it was as a result of the conference.

Epstein asked concerning the wiretaps on the SCLC and
Phillips responded that this was outside the scope of the
interview but Phillips was willing to tell him that the FBI
had had wiretaps on the SCLC in its offices in Atlanta, Georgia,
and New York City, Asked if there were any wiretaps on the SCLC
elsewhere, Phillips said he knew of none and again reminded
Epstein that Phillips desired to get away from being interviewed
about the SCLC as it was outside the paramcters of the
authorized interview.

Epstein asked concerning authorizations for wiretaps
on King and the SCLC, Hewinted to know if they were in similar
or separate documents and Phillips advised that they were
handled through separate communications. One communication
would deal with King's residence whereas another would deal with
SCLC offices.

Epstein asked whether the original authorization
propared for a Wiretap on King referred to installing it on both
King's residence and office, Phillips said he could not give
a positive answer to this. He was asked how long wiretaps
remained on King's residence and responded that he could not
say because it was his best recollection such coverage was
still in elfect when he left supervision of this case in 1955.

Ro: Interviow of PRI Specinl Agent (8A)
Seymor Tred Phillips by SEC Staf2 Mombors

Discussion next turned to monographs prepared by the
EBI and Phillips was asked as to who decided to prepara the
original monopraph., fhillips said ho did not xveeall, Ue was
asked who had determined to whom dissemination should be made
and Phillips said he could not reeail who made the decision,
Ho was asked 12 the Pirst monograph prepared was dissominated
outside the Executive Branch of the Government and he said he
helioved that it had not been,

Epstein noxt displayed to Paillips a Xerox of an FBI
nmonorandum £von Willionm C, Cuilivan to A. H. Lolmont datad
Novenbor 22, 1964, concerning dissemination of the second
monograph prepared by the FDI. At one point in this memorandum,
nention was made of appropriate dissemination. At this point,
an asterisk was inked or penciled in and at the bottom of tho
page there appearcd an asterisk and after it: White House,
Dopartnent, State and the names of somo othes: Federal agencies.
This was an apparent moans of indieating exactly to whon
dissomination was to ko made. Upstoin asked who entered this
information with the agtorisk and Phillips said ho did not know
but that the printing did not appear to be that of Phillips.

In the above-=nentioned monorandun, there was an
indication of the information appearing in the monograph which
was discussed in the memorandum, One typo of information
included in the monograph was that shown as number (2) followed
with a statonent about facts relating to tho noxval degoncracy
of Ins. Tho mororandam also roforved to the fact that the
second monograph was an update of an carlior monograph. Phillips
was askod if the update included materials relating to (2).
Phillips said ho would have thought so. Epstein thon asked
whether the original monograph which was prepared in Getober,
1963, had infernation niong the lines of (2). Phillips responded
that now that Epstein had directed Phillips? thinking to the tine
frano, Phillips doubted that the November, 1964, (second
monograph) updated anything relating to (2) inasmuch as it was
Phillipst_bost veecolicction that tho PRY. did not havo sueh
anformation to include in tho original monogyaph in Gctoher, 1963.

fe: Interview of FOI Special Agent (SA)
Seynor Fred Phillips by SSC StaLz Members

Phillips was asked who dccided to include information
about moral deroneracy and he said ke did not know. Ho was asked
who had written that portion of the monograph and responded
that he himseli may have. He was asked who decided to put such
infornation in the monograph. It was Phillips' best recollection
that this was a decision of not any specific person but that
there was a general consensus that it should be in the monograph.
Epstein asked whether anyone cane forward and voiced an opinion
that such information should not be included in tho monograph.
Paillips rospondcd that be did not veenll anyone takins such a
position.

4 this point, Epstein inuuired as to why the 1Bi
included information on moral desenevacy in a monograph which
supposedly related to the communist influences on King.

Phillips told Epstoin that Epstein was now entering inte an

area Which called for opinion and conclusion on the part of
Phillips. Phillips pointed out that this was ulso an area that
involved moral ond philosophical considerations. Vor all of
theso veasons, Yaillips told tpstcin that he chose to not discuss
the matter with hin. Phillips was nusked if he was aware of any
other dissemination of the November, 1064, monograph to any
Senator other than Senator Uubert Humphrey. At this point,
Epetein displayed a Xerox of an FBI letter to Uunphrey furnishing
hin a copy of the monograph. Phillips said he did not have any
such information. Me was asked who decided to give a copy to
Luaphrey and Shillips said he did not know.

Ipsteln asked whether COINITLPR0-Conmunist Party, USA
(CPUS) was handled in the sanie section where Pilllips handled
the King case. The response was in the affirmative. MTpstein
asked if there was any COINTELPRO-CPuUSA against King and Phillips
said he knew of none.

Tho interview concluded at 2:57 p.n. with Ipsteia
indicating that it was complete althoush the door was open for
sone possible further questions at a later date.

For purposes of identification in this memorandum,
my name is George C. Moore, former Special Agent of the FBI
having retired July 31, 1974. My address is 6715 North 27th
Street, Arlington, Virginia, telephone number 533-8288. In
view of the fact that I have been interviewed by the Senate
Select Committee (SSC) concerning matters involving my
activities while an FBI employee, I am making this interview a
matter of record for the information of the FBI by my ovm
volition.
On July 28, 1975, I appeared at the new Senate Office
Building for a 2:00 p.m. interview with Mr, Loch Johnson, a
Staff Member of the Senate Select Committee, concerning the
Huston paper.
Although the interview was originally set up for i
2:00 p.m., we spent a total of 45 minutes looking for an office
space in which to hold the interview. Mr. Johnson was consider-
ably embarrassed with the snafu of his clerical staff not
providing him with room keys in the former Carroll Arms Hotel
already occupied by other Staff personnel. After approximately
30 minutes, I suggested that perhaps we would save alot of time

if he conducted the interviey in the park across the street.

He seemed receptive to this succestion; however, we could not
find a pack bench. We proceeded to Senater Church's office
and arvangements vere made to use the Senator's personal office
located in the Capitol building itself.

At the beginning of the intervie, Mr, Johnson did
not place me under oath or indicate that I was under subpoena.
He also did not advise me of my rights and right to counsel,
although he was avare that a representative of the Bureau
(Supervisor L. F. Schvartz) was standing by in the Senate
Office Building for consultation if needed by me.

The following vere key points which I reeall covered
during the intervier.

Initially, he asked me for a brief statement of my
background which I provided. He was very much interested in
knowing the extent of my acquaintanceship with lr. Huston
prior to the June 8, 1970, (a Monday morning) meeting in the
Director's office, I informed him that I had met Huston no
more than tvo times prior to that meeting and possibly once
whey I had briefed him at Mr. Sullivan's suggestion in

Division 5 concerning extremist activities covered by the

NW 65360 Doctd:32989634 Page 271



7? ¢

mugen

section under my supervision. Such briefing was not a long
briefing and I did not reeall any further details including

vho might have aceompanied Mr, Huston. Next, he desired to know
if I had ever prepared a paper for Mr. Huston which indicated

the extent of the extremist threat in the United States. I

did not recall preparation of any such paper at this time other
than the overall paper prepared at the Director's (and President's)
instructions in the Summer of 1970, known as the “Huston Plan.”

He asked me what I considered to be a true assessment
of the extremist threat at that time and I informed him the
paper which vas written vas an accurate statement of the threat
as kno to the FBI together with the input from other intelligence
agencies,

He seemed interested in the foreign aspects to this
threat and asked for my assessment in that regard and endeavored
to have me label it as significant, nonsignificant, moderate
and similar acjectives. TI refused to label it and stated that
the threats spoke for themselves and it was for others to
interpret in that regard although I did point out that there

vas and has been and possibly still remains a degree of varying

Coin,

proportions of foreign influence in these movements. I
emphasized that the word was “influence” and not knowledge
of any control.

He asked whether I felt the President was correct
in believing that the quality of FBI intelligence in this area
was low.

I informed that it was my recollection that President.
Johnson Likewise had been critical of the overall data of
FBI intelligence in this area and we in the FBI who collected
such intelligence knew fully well that our intelligence product,
although good in some respects, left much to be desired. In
other vords, there were definite intelligence gaps.

“ext overall point covered was the meeting in the

Director's office on Monday, June 8, and his desire to receive

from me a feel of the tenor of the meeting since I was one of
the participants.

I informed him of the nature of my attendance which
was a last minute notification by Mr. W. C. Sullivan vho
stopped by Branch Chief Joseph A. Sizoo's desk (which I was
Manning at the time) and asked me to go with him across the
street to the Director's office, He did not tell me why and
aid not brief me ahead of time. After getting there, it vas

obvious I was taken in order to prepare a memorandum of the
event. (This was obvious to me since I was much the junior
man in attendance.)

Mr. Johnson was interested in a rundowm of the
meeting itself to the best of my recollection and I provided

him a fev of the details including the fact that Admiral Noel

Gayler (phonetic) of the National Security Agency (MSA) was
about five minutes late and the Director started the meeting
on time without him, Also, during the meeting the Director
gave a very brief rundowm on the mandate of the President,
which was to identify intelligence gaps through a cooperative
effort letting the chips fall where they may and affording
the President a good hard-hitting report which would allow
him an opportunity to make some hard decisions. Somewhere

in this meeting the comment was made about a lack of cooperation
on the part of the agencies, and the Director looked Mr, Helms
in the eye and said that he was not aware of any lack of
cooperation on the part of any of the agencies and Mr. Helms

agreed with the Director in spite of the fact that liaison had

been curtailed a short time prior to the meeting by the Director

with CIA.

One other item of interest furnished was the fact
that Admiral Gayler used this meeting as an opportunity to
make a request of the Director that he hoped the FBI would
help NSA out by engaging in surreptitious entries regarding
embassies. The Director gave him no hope in this regard
pointing out the risks involved and the climate of the times.
dictated that this matter be given very careful study before
any hasty decisions would be arrived at. £8

Mr. Johnson asked if I was aware of a flap which
occurred at this meeting in which Mr. Huston allegedly informed
the Director that the guidelines for the study were broader

than announced by the Director in his presence. I recalled

no such flap and informed Mr. Johnson that a memo was written

by me of the meeting which was sent to the Director which
hit the highlights of the meeting. He asked if this was °
available in Bureau files and I answered that I assumed so.

Mr. Johnson was very much interested in the meetings
and discussions which took place at Langley, Virginia (CIA's
home), and wanted to know who desired meetings to be held there.
I emphasized to him that I was not privy to any plans of that

sort and only functioned from that time on as a member of the



| quapeatt

working committee primarily because the Section I headed
vas involved in domestic extremist activities,

He desired to know of Huston's input into these
meetings and of any flaps which occurred and in particular. ~
he mentioned someone told him of a flap involving Army. fT
informed him that Huston did not seem to be running the meeting
as Sullivan seemed to be doing that in his position as Chairman
and I knev of ne flaps that occurred with any members,

I also mentioned in response te a question that
Mr. Helms did attend the first meeting at CIA Headquarters
and merely welcomed us to their space and offered any assistance,
He left and never returned after a few remarks.

Johnson asked several questions involvirg the format
of the report utilizing options for the President and asked
for my knowledge of how such a report was decided upon. Tf
told him I had no knowledge; he was asking the wrong person,

He commented about Part 3 being only one recommendation
and wanted to know if that was unusual and I responded that I
had never been involved in a paper for the President before
and I did not know whether such was unusual or not. T also

commented that I felt that the options in and of themselves

|NW 65360 Docid:32989634 Page 276



- ° @ )

nine
were in the nature of recommendations at the President's
pleasure,

Johnson was especially interested im whether other
agencies were desirous of using this whole operation as a
means of utilizing illegal techniques which vere at that time
denied and alse if the FBI representatives likewise approached
this task vith more than usual enthusiasm with the expectance
that they too would be allowed to use techniques some of which
were obviously illegal.

I told him that I could not speak for other agencies
and that there were better people to speak with on that score
but as far as my feelings as a representative of the FBI were
concerned, we all approached it as a difficult task involving
hard work, in view of a short deadline, and a project on which
the President, the Director and Assistant Director Sullivan
vere viding herd. At the same time, from a personal standpoint
I felt that “hope always springs eternal" and that maybe, . in
view of the high-level interest involved here, from an overall
standpoint we might be provided with some investigative

teois which would allow us to do a better job. At no time

RATAN,

NW 65360 Docld:32989634 Page 277



NW 65360 Docid:32989634 Page 278

was there any discussion to my recollection as to whether

any technique was legal or illegal bearing in mind that
everybody at the table was a professional from an intelligence
point of view whe made up a working committee and the matters
of that nature would be policy matters involving officials

on a cabinet level or higher.

I was asked the question as to whether or not
extremist field personnel ever utilized covert mail examination
techniques. I teld Johnson I felt he was getting beyond the
scope of my clearance from the Bureau for this interview and
he stated that he did not think so since one of the options
involved had to do with this matter, 1 informed him rather
than belabor the point that we in our Section's
work did not engage in this technique but I would refuse
to go any further with respect to my knowledge.

He asked me if T had any knowledge of what developed
after the report was prepared, apparently approved by the
President, and then later recalled, I told him that I had
no knovledge of a personal nature and very poor hearsay, which
was gathered through rumor, and later accounts from the press
that the Director allegedly took the letter to the Attorney
General who had it recalled.

mx

He also asked me for my knowledge of how the
Director made his footnote decisions. I told him I did not
know but felt that Mr. Sullivan was the person who would know
and have first-hand knowledge. He asked me if the Director
discussed it with Mr. Tolson. I told him I did not know
but that he may have in view of the relationship.

He also vas interested whether I had knowledge of
a difficult situation which Mr. Sullivan might have been in
at this time as chairman of a committee ackriowledging intel-
ligence gaps on the part of the FBI and also occupying a
position which would entail loyalty to the Director. 1
agreed that Mr. Sullivan was in a delicate position.

He also asked me for my opinion as to what lesson
could be learned from the Huston papers and I stated that
very little, if any, good could be learned from the papers
themselves but I did hope that after Congress was finished
with its investigation brought about by the Watergate syndrome
that the best interest of the country would be preserved in
the sense that we don't loose sight of the fact that there
are legitimate national security interests which need to be

protected and that there will come a time in the future when

oo he a

the people who are in power, whether it is Executive Branch,
Congress or both, will be asking the same questions with
respect to intelligence gaps and will have to make some hard
decisions.
. He also asked me if there was any advice I could

give as to reforms which could be initiated and I responded
that they were talking to the wrong person about reforms, It
seemed to me as. if they had enough reformers in Congress
today.

He did not ask me who vas present at the meetings in
Langley as he said he had Full knowledge of those who were
present but he did name to me these he felt were present and
at that time asked me if there were any individuals in addition.
I mentioned that I was not sure whether T. J. Smith was present
or not. He mentioned D. E, Moore, W. C. Sullivan, C. D. Brennan,
R. D. Cotter, W. 0. Cregar and F. J. Cassidy, as well as myself.

He also mentioned that he had heard that the report
consisted of 90 percent Bureau information and asked me if
that was correct. I said I had never put a percentage figure
on the information but knew that the report was top heavy

on Bureau intelligence which indicated intelligence gaps on

-ll-

CORE, wilh

the parts of CIA and others. He asked me if I felt that
there was a need for an evaluation type of committee to
overlook domestic intelligence in the future. I said "yes"
I felt that there was a need but felt that such a committee
should be set up with Congress as a joint committee with the
Executive Branch. He asked why and I replied that if such a
committee had been set up, I wouldn't be in Washington, D. C.,
today giving an interview at this time and I thought for the
good of the country there should be in the future such a plan
instituted.

Finally, he asked me for my opinion as to whether
security work should be taken out of the hands of the FBI
and put somewhere else, I said that this was poing a little
far from the scope but maybe it did bear on the "Huston Plan."
My reply vas that I felt from a historical viewpoint the
FBI’s record in the security and intelligence field has
withstood the test of time and was an outstanding record under
the direction of Mr. Hoover and felt that if their reputation
yas not unduly damaged by Congress the security work definitely
should remain under the confines of the FBI. He said my

comments were interesting since I was the first retired person

wwe
to leave FBI with these feelings and I replied that I did not
know who he talked with and certainly felt that Mr. Kelley
would take the same stand if he was called for interview. I
further stated that there is a definite relationship between
security investigations and criminal violation responsibilities,
many of which go hand in hand and as the terrorist threat
continues in this country and possibly explodes, we vill see
more of a reason for security and criminal divisions to work

closely together.
