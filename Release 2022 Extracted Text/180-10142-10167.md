After the Warren Commission iavestigatten published
its report two very important allegations related to Lee
Harvey Oswald's activities in Mexico city \wave—come to
the attention of the United States investigative agencies.
In 1964, Elena Garro de Paz reported that she had seen Lee
Harvey Oswald, accompanied by two other men, at a party
at the home of Ruben Duran Navarro, the brother-in-law of
Silvia Duran.’ "(see-Geetiomet 2.) In 1967, Oscar Con-

treras Lartigue reported that he met Lee Harvey Oswald on

i _ fel
the campus of the National Autonomous University cf Mexico.

(erte-tramscertps.) On October 1, .1963, a man called

the Soviet Consulate and identified himself as "Lee Os-

ing that the caller on 9/28 and 10/§ was Oswald is that
wok
Oswald spoke fluent Russian. (Cites.) Granted, Ms.

Duran's denial of the Saturday visit and the proficiency

of the calier's Russian is not sufficient evidence to

conclude that the person who visited the Cuban Consulate

on Saturday and who called the Soviet Consulate on Satur-

day and on October lst was an imposter. Yet the informa-

C. What were Lee Harvey Oswald's Activities in Mexico City?
When the Warren Commission wrote about Lee Harvey

Oswald's activities in Mexico City, it concluded:

had failed to obtain visas at both the Cuban/and
Soviet Embassies. From Sunday, September 2
through Wednesday morning, October 2, when he fee 272
left Mexico City on a bus bound for the United Hee
States, Oswald spent considerable time making

his travel arrangements, sightseeing and checking

again with the Soviet Embassy to learn whether ,
anything had happened on his visa application. '"3!

There is also circumstantial corroboration of Ms
Garro's allegation's regarding June Cobb sharp. (For example,
Ms. Cobb was indeed a CIA agent and she did file fhe first
report of Ms. Garro's story. It should be noted that this
first report was accurate in its detail)in that Ms. Garro's
story remained essentially the same in subsequent repetitions.
Ms. Garro claimed that she kicked Ms. Cobb out of her house.

why Ms. Garro's story had been largely ignored by the
American official's in Mexico:

It would appear that whereas the FBI has

discounted the Elena Garro allegations,

the CIA is still considerably disturbed :
by them. The CIA may not have pressed for

225

at further investigation, however, for a number

of reasons: 1) considering the sensitive over-

lap and subtle competition between two intelli-
gence collecting agencies, it had to yield to

the FBI's clear jurisdiction; 2) there are ob-
vious complications in conducting such an inves-
tigation in a foreign country; 3) there is a close
and delicate relationship between the CIA.

Station Chief and(the former Minister of Interior
--President Gustavo Diaz Ordaz) and 4) some of the
people appearing in the Elena“Garro scenario may
well be agents of the CIA. Under the circum-
stances it is unlikely that any further investi-
gation of this matter will ever take place unless
it is ordered by a high official in Washington. “7°

The Committee's’ last—hope-was to locate Elena Garro.

Although the Committee established telephonic contact with
: ; ; ee a2

MS. Garro, it was never able to arrange an interview.

Consequently, the Committee was totally frustrated in

this aspect of it's investigation, but yet believes that

there is’a otaaeng possibility that Lee Harvey Oswald did
Rie attend ul party at the home of Ruben Duran.

The Committee also considers it possible that Lee
Harvey Oswald contacted pro-Castro Students at the National
Autonomous University of Mexico (Universidad Nacional
Autonoma de Mexico, heréinafter UNAM.) as claimed by Oscar

uit :
Contreras Lartigue. (See~Section—Vi;—B; ebeve—feor-detetls.)

Silvia Duran admitted that she had told Oswald of two ways

in which he could get a Cuban visa: 1) he could get an intran-
sit visa by first obtaining a visa to another Comhuhist
country such as Russia; 2) he could obtain a regular Cuban
visa by knowing Peiaang in Cuba who would, aftex—a—fashton,

effort to locate someone trusted by the Cuban Consulate to

vouch for him. “There is no direct evidence about how a Ke
could have learned of the pro-Castro group at UNAM, Oscar e
Contreras says that Oswald first contacted him as he was =
leaving a round-table discussion at the school of philosophy.” 4
It is known that, in 1963, the Duran&s were close friends
with the Chairman of the Philosophy Department at UNAM,
Ricardo Guerra, who held seminars on Kant, Hegel and Marx .
in the puran*s tesa is possible, if Silvia Duran had

more than just a purely buSiness relationship with Oswald,

that she referred Oswald to one of Guerra's Marxist seminars

in his search for help. Unfortunately, Contreras does not
name who headed the round table discussion at which he met
ag oswaralt? Silvia Duran denied that she referred Oswald to

anyone for help. 17? Ricardo Guerra is presently the
Mexican Amabassador to East Germany and was not available

D. Was Lee Harvey Oswald alone while he travelled in.Mexico?

The Warren Commission concludéd that Lee Harvey Oswald
ad =
travelled alone while he was in Mexico. All of the witnesses,



27?

with the exception of Elena Garro de Paz who stated that
Oswald was accompanied by two "beatnik looking boys" UAtee
Section VI, C;—ebeve—for_details.) at Ruben Duran's party,
have stated that when they saw Oswald in Mexico he was alone.
But yet the Committee does not believe that it can readily
dismiss Ms. Garro's allegation that Oswald had a companion

in Mexico in light of: 1) the corroboration of details of

tb
Ms Garro's story and the manner in which t

_authorities handled the investigation-of-that~story {gee

Seetioqn VEbr-t; ave.) F 2) The possibility that someone
ugr : =
impersonated Oswald in Mexico (Ses=SéetienmVii-=Bsebome. )

and 3) the similarity in/description of Oswald by Ms. Duran

and Mr. Azcue and the description of Oswald's companion by

Ms. Garrd!S? (ceersscetons-vi—Ay-By and 27 Bove.)
