VII. Analysis of Lee Harvey Oswald's activities in Mexico

City

A. Introduction

THIS COPY IS NOT

FOR RELEASE.

After the Warren Commission investigation published

its

report two very important allegations related to Lee

Harvey Oswald's activities in Mexico City have come to

the attention of the United States investigative agencies.

In 1964, Elena Garro de Paz reported that she had seen Lee

Harvey Oswald, accompanied by two other men, at a party

at the home of Ruben Duran Navarro, the brother-in-law of

Silvia Duran.

after the publication of the warren Report.

(Sae sactions

* respectively for details:).

The Garro and Contreras allegations, in conjunction

with the weakening of Ms. Duran's story raise three major.

questions: did Lee Harvey Oswald or an imposter visit the

Cuban Consulate in Mexico City?; Other than his visits

to the Cuban Consulate, what were Lee Harvey Oswald's acti-

(3)

vities in Mexico City?; and, was Lee Harvey Oswald travel-

ling alone in Mexico? ¿These three questions dorot

coutse

overlap somewhat in detail;

e. or exampte, if oswald was

not tarveling alone, did one of his companions impersonate

him at the Cuban Consulate, Nonethekss

Each of the three questions

will be dealt with in separate sections below.

If the dis-

cussion at times seems

slightly redundentit is because

that is an anavoidable

side-effect of the interpelatedness

of the questions. )

In an attempt to answer the questions, posed above

the House: Select Committee on Assassinations has: 1) inter-

viewed Mexican and Cuban citizens who could have knowledge

of Oswald's visits to the Cuban Consulate; 2) Interviewed

1061

Mexican citizens who could have knowledge of Oswald's ac=

tivities and associations in Mexico City; 3) Conducted an

Oswald's signature on the Cuban visa application,

hoever, does not by itself rule out the possisility

that someone impersonated Oswald in contacts with the

Cuban and Soviet Embassies.

An analysis of the telephone conversations (which

the CIA's Mexico City Station intercepted by tapping the

• Soviet Consulate and the Soviet Military Attache's tele-

phone) reveals that

someone, later identified as Oswald,

visited the cuban consulate at least two times and the

Soviet Consulate at least threef times.

would tend to indicate that Oswald, or someone

impersonating him, visited the Cuban Consulate at least

one and possibly two additional times on September 27,

1963. Silvia Duran says that Oswald first visited the

Cuban Consulate at approximately 11:00 a.m. requesting

an intransit visa to Cuba with Russia as the final de-

1083

stination. (Duran interview, 676/70, 894 Document 1011681.)

Ms. Duran sent Oswald to obtain photographs that he needed

1084

for the visa application. (Fbiu., p. 20-23.) Eusebio

Azcue recalls that this visit probably occured on the

1085.

date on the visa application, 9/27/63. (Public testimony

of Fusebio Aseue, 9/18/78, P. 36.)

C. What were Lee Harvey Oswald's Activities in Mexico City?

When the Warren Commission wrote about Lee Harvey

Oswald's activities in Mexico City, it concluded:

-BY Saturday, September 28, 1963, Lee Harvey Oswald

had failed to obtain visas at both the Cubanfand

Soviet Embassies.

From Sunday, September 29,

through Wednesday morning, October 2, when he

left Mexico City on a bus bound for the United

States, Oswald spent considerable time making

his travel arrangements, sightseeing and checking

• the Soviet Embassy to learn whether

anything had happened on his visa application. "3!

(Warren Commiscion Report, p. 307.) Subsequent to the Warren

Commission's Report, the allegations of Elena Garro (See Section

VI, C, above.) and Oscar Contreras Lartigue

(see Section VI,

I, above:) came to the attention of the United States inves-

tigative agencies. The main allegation of both these people,

1130c

that they met Lee Harvey Oswald in Mexico City, remains to this

day without direct

corroboration. Yet the Committee feels that

without giving them any consideratio

it cannot dismiss these allegations

entirely out of hand fore

everal reasons

Illustrated below.

The testimony of Silvia Duran and the Cuban Consulate

Officials Azcue and Mirabal place Oswald's last contact with

1134 se

the Cuban Embassy on Friday evening, September 27, 1963.

(see Section VII, D, above.) The transcripts

rom the CIA's

wiretaps on the soviet Consulate place Oswald's last visits

to the Soviet and Cuban Consulates on Saturday morning, Sep-

1635

tember 28, 1963.

(See Seetions 3, A, 1 and III, B, Z, above.)

Oswald's last telephonic contact with the Soviet Consulate

1136

came on Tuesday, October 1, 1963.

(Ibia.) Oswald's activities

on the days between September 28 and October 1, are not clearly

recorded. The warren Commission speculated that he spent

1137

most of this time sightseeing and making travel arrangements.

(Warren Report, p. 301+ It is entirely possible that Oswald ?

did spend some of his time during this weekend sightseeing

and making his travel arrangements. It is also entirely

possible that, after his failure to obtain his visas on

Saturday, September 28, that Oswald did not give up completely

and did attend a party where he would have come into contact

with the Cuban Consular officials and, later, sought help

from pro-castro students.

It is entirely possible that Ruben Duran had a "twist

(1138)

party" on September 30, or October 1 as Elena Garro has claimed.

Ruben, Horacio, Lydia and Silvia Duran all admitted that they

frequently had twist parties in 1963.

It should be noted that this party alle

Many of the details of Elena Garro's allegations have

not been, or cannot be, corroborated. For example, Elena's

allegation that some of the people who had been at the party

were taken to Veracruz under the protection of Governor Lopez

alleged by Elena Garro.

•) The Committee has not

been able to verify whether or not gaurds were posted out-

side of Elena's home in 1963 as she claims.

But other details of Elena's story mete it hard to

tor aut it nam. Perhaps the most striking is the sugges-

tion that Oswald's relationship with Silvia Duran was more

extensive than just the business contacts in the Cuban

Consulate.

Another detail is the manner in which he elena's

allegations were handled, and the manner in which this

Committee's attempts to investigate those allegations have

147

been frustrated.

In 1965 Elena Garro reported that Silvia Duran

had been Oswald's mistress while he was in Mexico City.

In 1967 this report was confirmed by la CIA agent who talked

Ti49

to Silvia Duran.

The CIA Station did not consider the

information significant and told the agent to end his

contact with Ms. Durant'so

(see-section VI, A, 2, above

that

for details.) If that information is accurate then Silvia

inviting Oswald to a party would not have been that surprising.

Silvia Duran admitted that the Mexican police had questioned

her on this point but denied that she had had an affair

11151

with Oswald. / Ms. Duran denied having any extra-marital

1152

affairs while she was married to Horacio Duran.

This denial is not consistent with evidence of her reputation

at the cuban consulate. (A CIA penetration agent there

reported to his case officer that all that would have to

be done to recruit Silvia Duran, whom he reférred to by

using

the Spanish word for whore, would be to get a blonde

with her.

whom she believed worked for the Mexican Ministry of Govern-

were also frustrated. (See appendix 3.)

There is also circumstantial corroboration of Ms.

Garro's allegation's regarding June Cobb Sharp. (For example,

Ms. Cobb was indeed a CIA agent and she did file the first

1164

report of Ms. Garro's story. It should be noted that this

first report was accurate in its detail) in that Ms. Garro's

story remained essentially the same in subsequent repetitions.

1165

Ms. Garro claimed that she kicked Ms. Cobb out of her house.

There is a notation on Ms. Cobb's report that she was

not

able to regain access to Ms. Garro. The Committee attempted

to obtain an interview with Ms. Cobb, but was once again

frustrated.'"*7

Reviewing the manner in which the CIA Mexico City

Station and the Legál Attache's office in Mexico City

handled Ms. Garro's allegations reveals that, at best,

they were handled in an irresponsible manner because they

were dismissed after a superficial investigation. The first

report that came to the CIA was mis-filed and forgotten.

1168

The Legat, after talking to Elena, dismissed her story after

interviewing one person whom she said may have been at the

11L9

party.

The manner in which the official American community

handled Charles Thomas' reporting is detailed in Section

VI, C, 11, above.) Mr. Thomas Speculated in 1969 about

why Ms. Garro's story had been largely ignored by the

American official's in Mexico:

It would appear that whereas the FBI has

iscounted the Elena Garro allegations,

the CIA is still considerably disturbec

by them.

The CIA may not have pressed for

further investigation, however, for a number

of reasons: l) considering the sensitive over-

lap and subtle competition between two intelli-

gence collecting agencies, it had to yield to

the FBI's clear jurisdiction; 2) there are ob-

vious complications in conducting such an inves-

tigation in a foreign country; 3) there is a close

and delicate relationship between the CIA.

Station Chief and the former Minister of Interior

-President Gustavo Diaz Ordaz and 4) some of the

people appearing in the Elena

Garro scenario may

well be agents of the CIA. Under the circum-

stances it is unlikely that any further investi-

gation of this matter will ever take place unless

it is ordered by a high official in Washington. 17°

attempted

The Committee's last hope was to locate Elena Garro.

Although the Committee established telephonic contact with

(1111)

Ms. Garro, it was never able to arrange an interview.

Consequently, the Committee was totally frustrated in

this aspect of it's investigation but yet believes that

there is a song possibility that lee Harvey Oswald did

attend a twist party at the home of Ruben Duran.

The Committee also considers it possible that Lee

Harvey Oswald contacted pro-Castro students at the National

Autonomous University of Mexico (Universidad Nacional

Autonoma de Mexico, hereinafter UNAM.) as claimed by Oscar

1112

Contreras Lartigue.

(See section VI, D, above for details.)

Silvia Duran admitted that she had told Oswald of two ways

in which he could get a Cuban visa: 1) he could get an intran-

sit visa by first obtaining a visa to another Communist ..

country such as Russia; 2) he could obtain a regular Cuban

visa by knowing someone in Cuba who would, after a fashion,

,113

vouch for him.

effort to locate someone trusted by the Cuban Consulate to

"There is no direct evidence about how

Oscar

Contreras says that Oswald first contacted him as he was

leaving a round-table discussion at the school of philosophy.

It is known that, in 1963, the Duran

s were close triends

with the Chairman of the Philosophy Department at UNAM,

Ricardo Guerra, who held seminars on Kant, Hegel and Marx

in the Duran's home.

1115

It is possible, if Silvia Duran had

more than just a purely business relationship with Oswald,

that she referred Oswald to one of Guerra's Marxist seminars

in his search for help. Unfortunately, Contreras does not

name who headed the round table discussion at which he met

MIL

Oswald.

Silvia Duran denied that she referred Oswald to

anyone for help.

"7? .) Ricardo Guerra is presently the

Mexican Ambassador to East Germany and was not available
