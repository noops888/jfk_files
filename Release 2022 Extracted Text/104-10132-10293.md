MEMORANDUM FOR. THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Lee Harvey OSWALD
OS#351 164

a)
1. On 22 March 1977 (Gary M. LONNQUIST), Office of
Communications, and the undersigned met during a social
engagement (a party in his honor prior tohis PCS to

i3-t {Manilay). During social conversations, (LOWNQUIST] mentioned

an incident which occurred in the Security Recor Division——
file room relating to the OSWALD security files, Suownqurstos
was subsequently interviewed by the undersigned a Jerry
Brown, Deputy Chief, Security Analysis Group, on 23 March
1977 in the Security Analysis Group, Room 3E49, and {LONN- %
QUISTjrelated substantially the following. ~

2. Sometime between May 1975 and January 1976 while
an Office of Security employee assigned to the Security
Records Division file room, LONNQUIST /was requested to
search SANCA in the name of ee Harvey OSWALD. This request
was in connection,with a Freedom of Information case involving
OSWALD, and LONNQUIST Jbelieved that fore HOWARD), also
assigned to the Security Records Division, made the request.
This search met with positive results, thus making [LONNQUIST] °5
aware of the fact that OSWALD's name was entered i SANCA.

3. Subsequently, [LONNQUIST] came across a file which
he described as relating to OSWALD, and he intended to, file
same with the rest of the OSWALD files on the shelf. LONN - 03
QUIST |described this file as covert, thin, and having
higher file number than the rest of the OSWALD holdings.
He could not remember the name which appeared on the outside
of the file but thought that it may have been one of OSWALD's
akas. He further related that he looked inside the file and
believed that it was related to, or possibly identical with,
the regular OSWALD holdings. While attempting to refile this
covert file, he observed that all of the regular OSWALD
holdings were permanently charged to the Security Analysis
Group; thus he believes he sent the covert file to the
Security Analysis Group.

4. Later, (LonNQUIST] again queried SANCA in the name
which he saw on the covert file but_found no record.
Perturbed, he queried lFranci§$ DAVIS] (Indices Chief) as to
why he could find no record in the na: eof a file which he
knew existed. He specifically asked DAVIS}i£ the name
(which he ,cannot remember now) could Rave ‘been erased from
SANCA. (patra) replied that she did, ot think that was
possible.,,He then apprised (John B LLINGER| of the above,
since JBOLLINGER]had processed the OSWALD Freedom of Infor-
mation Act request. c{BOLLINGER| made unknown inquiries for
some three to four hours concerning theypossible erasure
of a name from SANCA and finally told {L INNQUIST] that there
was nothing to worry about, that he BOLLINGER}3took care
of the matter.ox/LONNQUIST) also advised that hé’ made his
immediat. oo aware of the incident.

T] advised that "he heard nothing further concerning

he incident but privately harbored doubts about the resolu-
tion of the incident. He mentioned that he entertained
thoughts of reporting the incident to the Inspector General
but has not discussed it with anyone subsequently until he
apprised the undersigned on the night of 22 March 1977.

OF
5. (Lonxquisi? was advised by the Deputy Chief, Security
Analy Group that the Security Analysis Group would make
the incident a matter of official concern and would begin
immediate inquiries .os[LONNQUIST] was cautioned not to vocalize
allegations regarding possible erasures of SANCA entries or
possible illegal destruction of official files. However,

he was told that he was perfectly [ree to bring the entire
matter up with the Inspector General if he felt it necessary.
