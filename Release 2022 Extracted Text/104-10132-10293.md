MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT:

Lee Harvey OSWALD

OS#351 164

1: On 22 March 1977 [Gary M. LONNQUISI, Office of

Communications, and the undersigned met during a social

engagement (a party in his honor prior to,

„his PCS to

13-! Manila).

During social conversations, (LONNQUIST mentioned

an incident which occurred in the Security Records Division-

file room relating to the OSWALD security files. LONNQUIST a3

was subsequently interviewed by the undersigned

Brown, Deputy Chief, Security Analysis Group, on 23 Marcr

1977 in the Security Analysis Group, Room 3E49, and LONN-;

QUIST related substantially the following.

2. Sometime between May 1975 and January 1976 while

an Office of Security employee assigned to the Security

Records Division file room, LONNQUIST]was requested to

search SANCA in the name of Lee Harvey OSWALD. This request

was in connection

assigned to the Security Kecords Division, made the request..

This search met with positive results, thus making [LONNQUIST] 03

aware of the fact that OSWALD's name was entered in SANCA.

3. Subsequently, [LONNQUIST] came across a file which

he described as relating to OSWALD, and he intended to file

same with the rest of the OSWALD files on the shelf. LONN- 03

QuisT described this file as covert, thin, and havinga

higher file number than the rest of

the OSWALD holdings.

He could not remember the name which appeared on the outside

of the file but thought that it may have been one of OSWALD's

akas. He further related that he looked inside the file and

believed that it was related to, or possibly identical

the regular OSWALD holdings. While attempting to refill this

covert file, he observed that all of the regular OSWALD

holdings were permanently charged to the Security Analysis

Group; thus he

believes he sent the covert file to the

Security Analysis Group.

Later, LONNQUIST] again queried SANCA in the name

he saw on the covert file but found no record.

Perturbed, he queried Francis DAVIS (Indices Chief)

as to

why he could find no record in the name

ot a tile which he

knew existed.

He specifically asked DAVIs?if the name

(which he cannot remember now) could have been erased from

SANCA. DAVIS replied that she diagnot think that was

possible. o He then apprised John BOLLINGER of the above,

since BOLLINGER had processed the OSWALD Freedom of Infor-

was nothing to worry about, that he (BOLLINGER)itook care

of the matter.,|LONNQUIST also advised that he made his

immediate supervisor, {Chuck" TACKETT] aware of the incident.

03 LONNQUIST advised that he heard nothing further concerning

the incident but privately harbored doubts about the resolu-

tion of the incident.

He mentioned that he entertained

thoughts of reporting the incident to the Inspector General

but has not discussed it with anyone subsequently until he

apprised the undersigned on the night of 22 March 1977.

5. LONNQUIST was advised by the Deputy Chief, Security

Analysis Group that the Security Analysis Group would make

the incident

matter of ofticial concern and would begir

immediate inquiries.0z LONNQUIST/ was cautioned not to vocalize

allegations regarding possible erasures of SANCA entries or

possible illegal

destruction of official files. However,

he was told that he was perfectly free to bring the entire

matter up with the Inspector General if he felt it necessary.
