MEMORANDUM FOR: Me. Jnmep W. MeCond, Jr.
‘THROUGH Head of @@ Carcer Service

SUBJECT : Notification of Non-eligibility for Designation as a
Participant in the CIA Retirement and Disability System

1. As you may know, we are in the process of reviewing the employment
history and current career ficld of all employees in the Agency to identify
those who are eligible for designation as a participant in the new CIA
Retirement and Disability System. In this process, the initial review of
vach case is made by the individual's Career Service, If the Head of h
Career Service nominates him for participation ‘n the system, this nomina-
tion is revicwed by the CIA Retirement Board which recommends final action
tooac, However, Ef the i the Carcor Service advises that the employee
does not meet the basic requirements of IR 20-50 for participation, ! have
accepted this finding without further review by the CIA Retirement Board.
This practice has been adopted in the interest of cxpediting this sercening
process so that those employees who are eligible to participate in the sys-
ten may be designated participants as soon as possible.

i. fn vour case, the fiead of your Career Service has advised me that
jou do nut meet the requirecents of HA 20-99 for des:gnation as a partici-
pant and i have accordingly nade the fornal determination required by the

lation that you are cut eligible for designation. from a review of your
record ff appears that the decision of your Carece Service was based upon
the face that yao do not have sefficient tim: prior to completing 15 years
of service with the agency in watch you could cunplete a minimum of 60 months
of quabifsing service as required by regulation. “y deternination that you
ate not eligible at this cime fer designation in no way affects your current
Status under the Civil Service Retirement Systes, nor docs it preclude recon-
sideratio oor eligibility to participate in the CIA System if you should
