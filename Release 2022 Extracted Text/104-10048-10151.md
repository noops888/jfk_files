II. Production

1: “Although Subject submitted a good number of. reports
which were. of interest to JMWAVE internally, only three dis~
seminations. were credited to him during the month:

as: UFG-2781 (cable) from Frank Fiorini and Pepin Bosch,
"Frank Fiorini's Agreement to Participate in Air Strike
Against Cuba". Dele oe

b. .. UFG=2901 (cable) from Frank Fiorini, "Request by
Venezuelan: National that Frank Fiorini Purchase Arms
for Him".

Manuel Artime".

2. One item of information which Subject received from |
Frank Fiorini.on 28 May was considered possibly of*interest to
Headquarters, but-probably best not forwarded in reports format. |
Fiorini said that he. had spoken twice during the month with
General Claré Chenault, Jr,, who phoned from California.
Chenault indicated his desire to participate in the anti-
Castro effort, and asked Fiorini about the different organ-
izations in the Miami area and their leaders. Fiorini's
reply put Mantel Artime at the head of the list, and noted
that lack of. financial~backing was Artime'’s most pressing
problem. In the second phone call, Chenault recommended that
Artime solicit aid from the representatives of the Chinese
Nationalists. in Washington, and urged that his (Chenault's)
name be used. . Fiorini promised to pass this on to Artime
when the latter returned to the U.S. from a tour of Latin
American countries.

3. Information on a possible new labor grouping in exile
called Alianza de Trabajadores Cubanos was received from Sub-
ject early in the month, and was forwarded as an attachment
w UFGA-8970, WI ER

4. Another item of possible disseminable value received
at the end of the month was a letter received by Mariof*MARTI
io, a Cuban lawyer in exile, from his father-in-law, Miguel.
SHERNANDEZ Banza, who reported in congidgrable detail on a

POV for offi

Iv. Futuré’ Plans

Subjgct will continue his rounds of the exile communicy
in general, but will also look for more covert sources of
information such as the (} elopment. He will also

be useful for debriefing of new arrivals froin Cuba who ave
connected with revolutionary groups of interest to JMWAVE.

In this regard he should be of considerable assistance in

the influx of Uruguayan asylees.
