1:

COS met with a representative of LNERGQ of 22 November 1972

in an attempt to clarily the confusing issue over ANDESK-1 as outlined in

reference A.

The substance of LNERGO's remarks are as follows:

LNERGO ascertained from conversations with ÄMDESK-I that the latter

, häd been

some, time during the summer or early fall of 1972

business.

During his visit

AMDESK contacted

his old friend CIRASH-6. In the course of this contact, CIRASH-h

evidenced an interest in re-establishing contact with BKHERALD

, Subsequently, AMDESK-l, through the good offices of his

superior

arranged this contact which eventually took place.

LNERGO. has since been advised bv ÄMDESK-] that he (AMDESK-1) did not.

accompany CIRASH-6

2. The problem, therefore, appears to be that AMDESK-1, for

reasons not clear to us. reported to LNAGON that be ard an unidentified

high ranking

had been

together, and he (AMDESK-l) met with a BKHERALD officer.

LNERGO

mentioned that they have always found AMDESK-l honest and objective,

but there is always the possibility that he could have misrepresented the

information he passed to 'LNAGON, perhaps to gin some advantage for

himself with that service. In any event, LNERGO prefers not to pursue the

matter further with AMDESK-l as they are reluctant to become involved in

The Station also prefers not to raise the issue again with LAGON

as tha le to, time AiDFSK.I related the details of bis contacts

with BKHERALD in confidence, and to pressure him, now for more

FITNESS REPOST, RICANO MOrSlOS

SUBMITTED 3Y:-

Ricardo was selected for the group because of

Case Officer recommendation and personal obser

vation and his' training record plus the abib 1ty.

to speak. French and English as well as Spanish.

He is particularly bright, and during the prepara-

tory

and holdlag phase, as well as during the phase.

in which he has been left behind to acconpany

home, he perforned as required of a good

commando.

During. the action he showed a surprising leadership

taking ofer effectively a team which

needed it

capabllity it the nonent and continulns intll ho got

hit.

During a portion of the action he served as

conno link with aviators whose English was

not good.

Ricardo 1s definitely reconmended for spacial ops

in a leadership capacity, but 1t 1s mentioned here

thät his use to RUBARk baj be In a broader fleld and

that use as a conmando may be wasting his talents.

Ricardo is not now enployed at IMWAVE. He 1s not

felt in any way to have after action sacualty

concern.
