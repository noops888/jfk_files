IDENTIFYING DATA -
Subject is a forty year old married male who is a citizen of Cuba, ‘

He has been cooperating with the Agency since-about 1959, without receiv-

7 ing’ salary and being paid only expenses incurred in operational assignments,
Subject has been residiag in the United States since March 1961, Subject is
being utilized in @ covert capacity as an Fl asset, Subject's file number is
201-211900,

PROCEDURE :
Seana oS

Subject was given a polygraph interview at the request of(Harry WEBSTER,
case officer, WH/C/FI. The interview was held at a covert site in Washington,
D. C. on 27 August 1965, The interview was conducted in the English lang~

:uage, in which Subject appears to have limited and seemingly adequate pro-
ficiency, Subject sometimes expressed difficulty in understanding certain
words or phraseology in reviewing test questions, but generally stated that
he understood definitions and meanings for testing purposes. Throughout
testing, Subject Claimed that he understood the test questions; during a
discussion at the end of the interview, Subject stated that he found himself
during tests translating the interrogator's questions into Spanish for himself
and then provicing his answers, ever though he had heard the questions before -
testing and had arrived at a judgment onthem, — ~

PURPOSE :

It was ‘requested by the case officer that polygraph testing attempt to

determine the following: (1) Any connection with another intelligence service,
~eSpecially Cuban; (2) Whether Subject has told the truth about the nature of :
his relationship with Rolando CUBELA and has been reporting the truth to us i
ubout CUBELA and CUBELA's activities; (3) Whether Subject has told the

truth about his relationship with CARRILLO, Cuban Ambassador in Paris,
: In addition, it was requested that testing include the specific issues requested =
for coverage in an attachment to a contact report dated 28 June 1965, These :
issues include Subject's true name, Communist connections, intelligence or

iby :



to protect or advance his own business purposes.

security connections, relationshipk with CUBELA and CARRILLO, report-’
ing of Agency assignments and CU ELA activities, smuggling oc illegal
activitics in the United States or Europe, disclosure of CIA conncction to
any intelligence service or to the Castro Government, It was suggested
that the smuggling issue not be included or stressed during current testing,

sea that jt should be pressed if there was any indication that Subject might

be vulnerable to blackmail or might be using his CLA connection primarily
‘The issue was not entered

ing testing. It was agreed that merely an emotional question using
the smuggling be inserted to draw out Subject's comments or work

loitation
of CIA on the part of the Subject. It is noted that such a question woe
veserved until the very last test administered to the Subject so that there
vould be no. risk of emotionally disturbing the Subject prematurely or
clouding the relevant intelligence issues. -

CONCLUSION - \

ect's charts exhibit a combination
reactions, and inconsistencies through-
The charts also’ show a marked increase
in emotional disturbance and tension and progressively worse reactions as
testing advanced, From the’standpoint of Subject's tension and sensitivity,

it is possible that Subject is practicing deception during testing and that his
unusual test performance is the result of attempts to withhold pertinent
information in one or more relevant areas. Overall testing could not
conclusively pinpoint the reactions on all questions pertiennt as deception
reactions, and Subject's reactions are unresolved at this point, Due to
certain other factors which may have influenced testing, it is necessary to term
this case inconclusive and incomplete, To resolve the factors, it is recom-
mended thut Subject be re-interviewed at a later date and that the interview

be conducted in the Spanish language, It is believed that only testing in
Spanish can conclusively confirm or eliminate any indications and significant
problem areas arising from current tests, In the meantime, Subject's
admissions in certain areas and Subject's reactions on questions of specific
concern to the case officer are presented in this report, although the true
significance of the cited reactions may not be conclusive until a test in

Spanish can be administered,

From a technical analysis, Subj
of nervous tension, ‘erratic patterns,
out three separate phases of testing.

The factors present during this interview that might have affected
technical testing are as follows: .

(1) Subject claimed to be sick, to have been feeling ill since the pre~
vious evening and to have debated with himself whether to fly to
“Washington for the interview that same morning;

Subject claimed to be “in a hurry" because of "business problems"
and stipulated that the interview should not take too long so that

he could.catch an early plane back to New York;

: +

Subject has a rather limited command of the English language and
there are indications that a language problem may have been en-
countered during testing.

(2

2

On the basis of these factors, Subject has been temporarily given the
benefit of the doubt in testing, but by no means has been given a clean bill
: of health on the basis of current test performance; inasmuch as the case is
i considered incomplete, arrangements should be made for a follow-up poly-
graph interview in the Spanish language at a later date.

DETAILS

$

1, Specifically, Subject did not reflect consistent reactions on the
general question of working for another intelligence service, but he did reflect
reactions on specific questions of having a secret connection with the Castro
Government, telling another intelligence service about his connection with us,
having a secret connection with any Cuban Intelligence or security organization,
reporting information about American Intelligence activities or representatives
to anyone unknown to us, giving false or misleading information to any American
Intelligence representative, and being approached to work for another intelligence
service,

Subject further reflected extreme emotional disturbances on many quest- :
ions regarding his relationship with CUBELA and his knowledze of CUBELA's
activities or sentiments. He also reacted on questions dealing with his relat-
ionship with CARRILLO,

On questions that used the words such as "hiding," "concealing" (inform-

4, Subject was interrogated on tie basis of pronounced reactions on
the questioz, “Have you ever deliberately reported false or misleading in«
formation to any American Intelligence representative?" Subject ‘stated that
he had never reported false or misleading information on any assignment or
task, including hry missions to Mexico and Switzerland, and concerning his
activity vis-a-vis CUBBLA.

intelligence service besides American, despite reactions on this question,

TEPEDINO Gonzalez since 1946, Before 1946, he used the name Carlos LOPEZ

covering these two facts, but there were reactions on the question, "Have you
ever used another name to hide your true identity?" Answer: "No," Subject
stated that he had never used any name to hide his true identity and that he
understood the meaning of the question to refer to any secret or intelligence
use of another name that was unknown to us,

6, Regarding his name,

7, Subject reacted prominently on various questions dealing with CUBELA,
During the pre-test discussion, the interrogator had asked the Subject the follow-
ing question:. Does CUBELA have a plan to overthrow Castro? Subject replied
that there is no plan that he knows of, and he docs not corsider CUBELA's various
activities as constituting a plan for such an objective. Asked how he might des-
cribe CUBELA's attitude toward Castro, Subject said that CUBELA was opposed
to the Castro government and that Subject felt that CUBELA had a "desire" to
overthrow Castro, rather than any plan, When Subject was asked whether he
considered CUBELA's group to be a genuine anti-Castro and anti-Communist
group, Subject replied that CUBELA cid not have a group and that he knew of no
group he ever had, Asked how he world describe any individasls who supported.
CUBELA as friends, or promised him s<pport in any undertaking, or who might
be counted on for support if he were ever to follow through with his ‘desire to
overthrow Castro, Subject shrugged ard said he did not know what to call them,
that he did not think GUBELA had any control over all his friends or supporters,
that he did not even think they would all help CUBELA in any crisis or that CUBELA
could depend on any of them in any undertaking, He said that a group as such was
ho. existent and that he could not even regard CUBELA's following as a group of

peuted that he hud complete confidence in CUBELA,

urity elements, knew quite a few intelligence people, worked with them closely,

cooperating with Cuban Intelligence or Security clements, Subject replied that
CUBELA, of course, had strong connections with Cuban Intelligence and was
probably cooperating with them in.various ways. Subject added that he had

disturbance throughout the tests, An additional question which had been in-
cluded, "Is there a CUBELA-group?" was not answered by the Subject during
testing. Before testing Subject had stated that he understooa the question and
