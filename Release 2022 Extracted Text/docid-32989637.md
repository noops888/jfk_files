Please refer to the attached copy of a memorandum

I from Mr. Callahan to Mr. Mohr, dated 6/3/71.

This memorandum

points out that the proposed expansion of foreign liaison

would result in an approximate cost of $1,083,000. In regard

to this matter, I must take what will be an unpopular position;

one which runs counter to the present trend.

Frankly, I do not think that what we are getting from

our foreign liaison offices warrants such a tremendous

expenditure.

We must face up to the hard realities in this

i matter.

Specifically, I refer to the fact that, with the

exception of one office, we are operating on strictly a liaison

Ubasis in foreign countries. We are not operational; therefore

lite sea to day, in had the ratant a resorted.

I recognize fully that there will be some who will

disagree with me, but as I follow and understand our foreign

liaison operations the more convinced I am that what we

receive falls into four main categories, i.e.,

• (1) there

is information given to us which is in the nature

ot gossip;

!(2) we receive opinions of native contacts in the countries

Where we are, of in some instances people in those countries

ifrom other nations;

RECIST.

Ester"

(3) we receive what might be called "planted" Information,

expressly material which our native contacts give to us which

they want conveyed via the FBI to the White House or other

pertinent high-ranking U.s. officials----information that

would serve the interests of their own countries; and

1(4) lastly, we do from time to time develop information that,

at least to us, appears to be of value, but this is not in

, sufficient quantity to justify the expense of our operations.

The

same can be said of data relating to our criminal

It is a matter of common sense to conclude that

we cannot develop nard, high quality, positive intelligence

elby sending men

to these countries only in a liaison capacity.

They would have to be operational, with penetration of

sonsitive an and the develoment of covert sources da

It would take years to actually develop

operationally in foreign countries to the point where the

product can be considered to be in depth and of great value.

It has been recommended, among other things, that we

reopen our office in Brazil. Some years ago I strongly recom-

mended closing that office because it was clearly unproductive.

There is no reason to believe now that it would be any more so.

I The same is true of other offices.

It seems to me that the time has arrived to take a

very honest, cold, impartial look at our foreign liaison

operations.

We should ask ourselves the question, "Would any

real harm be done this

number of our current liaison

-ESTIMATED COST OF PROPOSED

EXPANSION OF FOREIGN LIAISON

The Director noted on the attached memorandum from Mr. W. R.

Wannall to Mr. C. D. Brennan dated 5/28/71: 'What is estimated cost of this

if approved?f.".

The proposed expansion would require the assignment of an

additional 29 employees (15 agents and 14 clerks) to Foreign Liaison. It is

anticipated that we will not ask for additional employees but we expect to take

will cost the Bureau approxina tely $100,000 additional. We have not provided for

such funds and it the project is undertaken, the funds will have to come irom some

other source in our budget such as equipment. If we keep taking money from our

equipment item we will soon be operating with obsolete equipment.

The total cost of foreign liaison operations would be increased

by approximately $1,083,000 on an annual basis broken down as follows:

(1) expansion of existing offices--$813, 680; (2) reopening of former offices.

$315,502; and (3) opening of three new offices --$453,818.

This memorandum, with all ticklers attached (including

my own), is being sent directly to you. I am doing this in

order to prevent any gossip that might circulate around the

Bureau had I taken the ticklers off and routed them. This will

give you an opportunity to consider the entire matter and decide

at what time you want to release the tickler copies.

As you know, this

memorandum is predicated on your state-

ment, written on Mr. Felt's memorandum of 6/10/71 to Mr. Tolson,

which reads:

"I would like to have from Sullivan a list of

foreign offices he would recommend be closed now."

This complex subject matter will be handled in three

stages: First, I will discuss the offices to be closed now, or

within the foreseeable future. These relate to the long-established

second, I will discuss the liaison

offices which were opened during the latter part of 1970.

Third, I will make reference to the proposed expansion of foreign

liaison and the proposed opening of additional foreign offices.

FIRST STAGE

MADRID, SPAIN -

as been tune as

I recommend the closing of this office now. It was re-

1969.

Since that time the operational cost

has been $152,952,. The Legal Attache's salary is Grade 15, $25,867.

The Legal Attache

Is Mx. V. V. Kolombatovic, whom I regard as an

outstanding man.

However, the work is simply not there and I

question strongly that what we have received is worth the cost

of operating this office.

I believe consideration should be given to transferring

Mr. Kolombatovic to head the office in Copenhagen, where the

Legal Attache is being recalled because of a security violation.

Memorandum to

The Director

Re: FBI, Foreign Liaison Program

I realize that Mr. R. E. Potocki, Assistant Legal Attache in

Paris, has been recommended to be the Legal Attache in Copenhagen;

however, if this is cancelled it would mean moving only Kolombatovic

to Copenhagen, Leaving Potocki where he is, thereby keeping expenses

down.

(I am aware that Ambassador Hill asked to have an FBI man

assist him; that Mr. Hill is a personal friend o1 President Nixon; and

that it is said he intends to retire soon. If the Bureau wishes to

base its decision on this I have no further comment to make relative

to this office.)

HONG KONG -

This office was opened in April, 1966, and since then it

has cost the Bureau $331,453.

Again, I do not think we have in any.

the office which would even approximate

that the product coming

out of this office during the

TOKYO (continued)

I tall to see that it is worth the money being put into it. The

Legal Attache, H. L. Child, is in Grade GS 17, $36,000 per

year.

Parenthetically, I am preparing a separate memorandum in regard

to salaries.

for example, Mr. Child receives 536,000 a year and

Ihas only. one man under him, with obviously very limited responsi-

bIlities, whereas Mr. Courtland Jones of the Washington Field Office

200 men under him and is in Grade 14, $27,061 per annum.

I want to state without equivocation that in my judgment Mr. Jones

handles more complicated and heavy responsibilities in one

month

than any of these Legal Attaches handle in an entire year.)

I recommend that the Tokyo Office be closed because the

VIEWS OF MESSRS.

BEAVER, DALBEY AND FELT -

I have read the comments of the above-named men. It

was somewhat more than mildly distressing and saddening to me

to observe the lack of objectivity, originality, and independent

thinking in their remarks.

The uniformity and monolithic

character of their thinking constitutes its own rebuttal. While

I am certain it was not the intention of these important Bureau

OIIICIaLS, who occupy unique roles, to create the impression

in the reader's mind that they said what they did because they

thought this was what the Director wanted them to say, neverthe-

less

it seems to me this is the impression conveyed.

It has been my experience that the Director certainly

does not want officials of the Bureau to try to guess what he

would approve of, but rather wants men to think a subject-matter

through and give their views, calling "a spade a spade," and

"letting the chips fall where they may." The Director is fully

capable of deciding for himself among conflicting viewpoints.

To use any other approach is, I think, to render a disservice

to the Bureau.

This current situation reminds me that a number of years

ago it was pointed out that Inservice training, as it then

existed, was of very little, If any, value to our field agents.

All the agents in the field knew this. However, When It was

Memorandum to

The

Director

Re:

FBI Foreign Liaison Program

called to the Director's attention a number of Bureau officials

went to great lengths to insist that there was nothing wrong

with

Inservice and that it should remain as it existed at the

time.

Change was opposed.

The Director will recall the results

pi this controversy, for there was plenty wrong with inservice.

It had to be overhauled, and it was at the Director's instructions.

I am also reminded of a statement attributed to Tom Huxley

which, though uttered years ago, fits the present subject-matter

with

rare exactitude.

Huxley said that, when faced with a

difficult problem, one should give up all pre-conceived beliefs,

notions, prejudices and desires to please, and sit down with

an open

mind before the evidence, and follow wherever it leads,

Ifor otherwise no worthwhile contribution can be made.

I do wish, however, to point out that I think Mr. Felt

made a useful contribution and a most valid observation when he

commented favorably on the Mexico City Office (and I share his

view), and concluded, "However, Mexico City is an operational

office, whereas the others

are not, and in my opinion this goes

to the

crux of the matter." Of course it does, and we should

not lose sight of this major and decisive fact, or inundate it

with irrelevant words.

---

SUMMATION

-

To sum up, since the offices to which I have alluded

(in the first stage of this memorandum) were opened, we have

spent a total of $2,256,715, as of 6/15/71. It

seems to me,

from the standpoint of

efficient administration, this money

can be far better spent in the domestic field, where our primary

responsibilities are and where our problems are increasing and

becoming ever more complex.

I am sure none of us are wholly

satisfied with the way we are discharging our operational

responsibilities in all areas of the domestic field.

Further,

we would be deluding ourselves if we believed that our Legal

Attache positions are not the "plums" of the Bureau. They

carry fine salaries, plus living allowances, opportunities

for foreign travel, et cetera. These positions do not even

begin to require, across the board, the heavy pressures and

complex responsibilities which our field office administrators

Shoulder day in and day out.

The Legats know this better, it

seems than some of us here at the Bureau. How many Legats

have asked to return to the field down through the years? And

when a foreign office is opened we are flooded with requests to

go.

The "word" has certainly gotten around. The "plums" are

well identified.

Additionally, the evidence points to the fact that,

and possible increase in unemployment, this country Is

into ever more troubled waters, and the Bureau had better be

fully prepared to cope with the difficulties which lie ahead.

This cannot be done if we spread ourselves too thin and finance

operations which do not give us proper returns for the dollars

spent.

We all know that the taxpayers of this country fully

expect that the Bureau will give them the best possible return

for their tax dollar.

This is a truth which I think is most

relevant to some of our foreign operations, and it is a truth

which we ought not to ignore.

In order to keep this memorandum reasonably brief, I

have not gone into all the reasons and into the many details

which I can and will turn to if it is considered necessary. I

am convinced that the offices I have discussed will not stand up

under any honest, impartial, searching, professional analysis,

from the standpoint of getting back full value

for the dollars

spent, as long as these offices are liaison and not operational.

Also, we must be very careful not to mislead the President into

thinking we can consistently develop for him, in volume and

quality, high level, hard, positzve intelligence intormation.

It cannot be done on

a liaison basis.

Lastly, I am not unmindful of the fact that the Director

pointed out that we could get along quite well without an

expansive domestic liaison

section and, therefore, he dissolved

it. Applying the Director's reasoning to foreign liaison, I

think certainly the conclusion is valid that we can at least

Ireduce it, with benefits to the Bureau.

SUBJECT: EXPANSION OF FOREIGN LIAISON

Washeste

Pursuant to the. Director's request, we have considered

various steps which. could be taken to expand our coverage abroad

in order to augment our development of high-level intelligence of

interest to the White House.

There are areas of the world where

political

and other developments would be of keen intelligence

interest and we have included some of these although we cannot

expect

that any

substantial volume of data pertinent to the

Bureau's domestic jurisdiction will be developed.

Thus, assignment

of Agents to such areas would be almost exclusively for

purpose of developing intelligence.

We have also prepared an

outline of our present coverage involving 42 Agents and 47 clerks

assigned to 17 foreign offices. This outline reflects the changes

which were made during the expansion effected in December, 1970,

land is attached.

We believe that our coverage can be stepped up in our

existing offices by increasing the complements of our Madrid,

In addition, offices

110 de Janezro, santo Domingo, and manzla

course reopened, thereby relieving pressure on Buenos Aires,

and Hong

Kong, which are presently attempting coverage

on a roadtrip basis. New offices could be opened in Australia

southeast sia, Inald, and 11 the

a. The office in

india, presumably at New Delhi, would open an entirely new area

and give:. us access to information of U. S. interest concerning

India, Pakistan, and Burma.

The office in Australia and in

Southeast Asia would also relieve our office at Hong Kong which

presently travels to these areas and would permit intensification

of coverage in Hong Kong itself by the two Agents currently

assigned.

The additions contemplated above would involve an

increase of no more than 20 Agents plus an appropriate clerical

stall.

making specific recommendations concerning the most

productive locations in some of the areas considered, we believe we

should secure the advice of some of our experienced men abroad who

have worked in the areas and are intimately familiar with their

"potential.

We plan therefore, if approved, to consult selected

Legats by teletype on a highly confidential basis.

SUBJECT: EXPANSION OF FOREIGN LIAISON

As discussed in the attached memorandum

Wannall to

Brennan, 5/27/71, we have prepared specific recommendations for

expansion of our foreign liaison for the purpose of increasing

our production of high-level intelligence of interest to the

White House. While we now have 17 foreign offices manned by

42 Agents, we suggest

new offices; and reopening of 3 former offices;

addition of one Agent each to 5 present

offices.

This would result in totäl of 23 offices manned by.

57 Agents and 61 clerks, increasing_present 89 personne]

overseas to 118.

It is our recommendation that the following changes

be considered: Add one Agent each to the following offices:

Beirut, to take over coverage in Turkey and Iran; Caracas,.

permit more thorough coverage of the

large roadtrip territory

in northern South America

and the West Indies; London,

to permit

increased

coverage in Ireland and

more efficient handling of a,

| large case load; Madrid

, to expand coverage in Portugal and

(Morocco; Tokyo,

to intensify coverage on Taiwan and in South Korea.

We suggest the following former offices be reopened;

Manila, Philippines,

relieve Hong Kong of present roadtrip and

provide closer following of political developments and more prompt

coverage in this important area which is larger than the U. S.;

Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic, to relieve San Juan of roadtrip

and turnish prompt coverage not

only of Dominican Republic but of

current political developments

in Haiti.

We suggest the following new offices be established:

might hold in connection with relations with the FBi.

Enclosed will be found an anaiysis of 38 items

(2 are contained in one memorandum, making a total of 37

real reason why CIA would raise any issue in connection with

37 out of the 38 items.

MOCASE (THE BORIS MORROS CASE)

Item number one in the material submitted to the

Director by Special Agent (SA) Sam Papich in his memorandum

3/5/70 discusses the case of Boris Morros-(Mocase).

BACKGROUND OF CASE

Boris horos, a hollywood motion picture

producer,

was recruited by Soviet intelligence in 1935.

1947 to 1957 he was operated as a double agent by the

FBI. This

was an extremely sensitive counterintelligence operation involving

Soviet intelligence activities in the United States in which

Morros traveled behind the Iron Curtain Ior meetings with his

Soviet principals.

Information obtained by Morros from his Soviet contacts

was disseminated to interested agencies,

including the Central

Intelligence Agency. On January 25, 1957, Jack Soble, Myra Soble,

and Jacob Albam were arrested in New Yorks

on charges of conspiracy

to commit espionage against the

United states.

PROBLEM WITH CIA

On March 16, 1954, the Bureau disseminated

Infornation received from Boris Morros to heads of the various

intelligence agencies, including, ClA, By letter of March 27, 1954;

Lieutenant General C. P. Cabell,

Acting Director of CIA,

criticized the information and,

in effect, characterized it as

"fabrication or

," which conclusion

the past from apparently the same source. By letter of April 5,

1954, the Bureau informed CIA that it was believed that no useful

purpose would be served in making any future dissemination to

CIA of information received from this source.

On April 9, 1954, Hr. Allen Dulles, then Director of

CIA, advised hiaison Agent Papich that he had been looking into the

matter and there was no question in his mind but that his agency

had acted stupdly in transmitting such a letter to the Bureau.

Memorandum to Mr. C. D. DeLoach

RE:

RELATIONSHIPS WITH CIA

By letter of April 21, 1954, Mr. Dulles stated that

CIA would appreciate it if the Bureau would kindly continue

to send reports from the source (Morros) which relate

to matters of foreign intelligence.

By letter of April 29, 1954,

the Director expressed the opinion that no useful purpose

would be served by disseminating to CIA information received

from the source in the future.

Nevertheless, memorandum

NAME

tO MAMA

dated

April 28, 1954, pointed out that when and if the Bureau receives

• information in the Mocase in the future of a type required

by National Security Council Directireto be furnished to CIA,

it should be carefully evaluated, and a decision made at that

: time

as to the officials and agencies

of the Government to whom it

should be disseminated. The Director noted "OK but before anything

goes

to CIA from this source I want to pass on it.

This

restriction does not apply to dissemination to other agencies. H"

Subsequent to the foregoing three disseminations were

made to interested agencies, including CIA, based on information

from Morros during October and December, 1954, and appropriate

dissemination was made thereafter

with the Director's approval.

As the time grew near for prosecutive action, the

Department requested the Bureau to check with CIA to see if

Department attorneys could interview a Soviet intelligence

defector then in custody of CIA named

RE: RELATIONSHIPS WITH CIA

(1) CIA feels it should have been advised much

earlier concerning those aspects of

the case relating to

CIA employees.

(2) Leads were, given to CIA at the same time the

agencios to play a dominant role in the European

investigation.

(4)

CIA fears the Bureau had not told it all there

was to know about the case that CIA should have known.

DISPOSAL, OF PROBLEM WITH CIA

The Bureau took the position

that any necessary investigation looking 'toward prosecution

in countries where Bureau had a Legal Attache would be

referred by the Legal Attache to the appropriate investigative

agency of that country.

In those countries where the Bureau

did not have a legal Attache, request for investigation would

be channelled through CIA. Because the

NAME

France,

the interrogation of the NAME

was handled by

request from the Legal Attache to the French.

NAME

during World War II had been with the

Office of Strategic Services and had contacts later with CIA

personnel. Prior to decision on prosecution we did not

disseminate information regarding the NAME

because ve

feared the effects of compromise from possible leaks would

endanger the life of our source. This was particularly true

in view of CIA's expressed attitude in 1954.

Some leads had

been given to CIA over two weeks before the arrests

01 the

subjects in the United States. •Leads were not given earlier

because of the fear of possible compromise. As far as

coordinating the French aspects of the case were concerned,

it is doubted that CIA could have exerted any control over

the

French investigation after the French had the information.

There was a distinct difference in this case between

intelligence information and evidence in support of prosecutive

action.

THE ABEL CASE

Item #3

in the material submitted to the Director by

SA Sam Papich in his memorandum of March 5, 1970, discusses the

Abel case.

According to Papich, CIA felt it was not given proper

recognition for its contribution in the case, in that it took the

risk and responsibility of transporting. NAME from pLACE to the

U.S. in 1957 after the Bureau declined

to become involved in this

transportation; that after a short handling period in the U. S. the

Bureau dropped

and CIA took the responsibility of safeguarding him, giving the

Bureau free access to him and time to develop leads

leading to the

apprehension of Abel; that CIA was responsible for making

NAME

mentally and physically capable to testify at the Abel trial; also,

CIA incurred heavy expenses, all for the benefit of the Bureau;

further, the Bureau never thanked 'CIA for its cooperation nor did 1

see fit

to inform the Attorney General' or the White House of the

role played by CIA.

impressions because of the FBI's world-wide reputation, and

when foreign visitors had no contact with Bureau officials

they were left with suspicions there was friction between the

FBI and CIA. In 1956, we had a clear-cut policy to the effect

that tours for such visitors would be of a restrictive nature

and

they would be afforded the same treatment as the public

nothing more.

SUBJECT: RELATIONSHIPS WITH CIA

CIA - DUTCH INTERESTS IN SOVIET ESPIONAGE ACTIVITY

Item #7 in the material submitted to the Director by.

SA Sam Papich in his memorandum of March 5, 1970, discusses

ClA - Dutch Interests in Soviet Espionage Activity.

SA Papich

notes that in 1956 the Dutch Internal Security Service (BVD) wanted

to have certain individuals in the U. S. interviewed and approached

CIA to make inquiry at the Bureau.

Whep Cia approached us,

we

told them to have the dutch submit the request through diplomatic

channels and we subsequently told CIA we would not handle the

interviews for the Dutch.

Although CIA accepted this, they felt it

hurt efforts to gather Soviet espionage information in Europe.

Our

position was based on failure of the Dutch to deal honestly with us

in the case of NAME

who was involved in collecting

intelligence information at the National Security Agency for a

Dutch official.

BACKGROUND OF THE SITUATION: ..

This question first arose when a Dutch official approachec

our representatives at the NAto special Committee conference in

Paris in May, 1956, and requested Bureau assistance in interviewing

NAME

in the U. S: and to have a Dutch representative

present during the interview.

NAME

NAME

is the widow of NAME

, who operated an espionage network in Europe prior

to his defection

in YEAl The Dutch representative said CIA had

interviewed her, but the results were unsatisfactory:

He was told

to submit his request through diplomatic channels.

In June, a CIA

representative advised SA Papich they were receiving pressure from

the Dutch to have

a Dutch representative bring all the material

on the case to the U. S. for the Bureau's use in interviewing

NAME

and two others in the U. S., but not to participate in

the interview.

In accordance with instructions, SA Papich told

CIA to have the Dutch submit their request through diplomatic

channels and to include all information in writing, and that the

Bureau would not deal personally with a Dutch representative. By

memorandum of June 15, 1956, it was reported that

NAME

of CIA told SA Papich

he was of the very strong opinion that the

Bureau's position made good sense, but other CIA officials felt the

Dutch should be helped in every possible way.

NAME

Of CIA. NAME asked if the Bureau

would talk to a representative of the Dutch if he came over

and, in lieu of that, would the Bureau accept from CIA information

and leads furnished by the Dutch..

NAME pointed out the Bureau's position was very

simple in that the Dutch had been caught short in the Mane

case when their representatives had been obtaining highly

classified information from a friendly government apa, before

the fBl even requested to interview the Dutch representatives

involved, the

notified

State Department

in view of this, the Bureau notified State Department

that any requests for information from the Dutch to be handled

by the Bureau must be channeled through the State Department.

NAME

said that this was a situation created by the

and wewould not talk to a Dutch representative and did not

desire to receive any leads in the

case through CIA.

advised that CIA respected the Bureau's position

and had attempted to guide itself accordingly in dealing with

the Dutch. He said he understood the Bureau's position, which

in essence was that the Dutch had made their bed and could

now lie in it.

it was agreed information might be furnished directly to fBI by

of what was given.

Horeover, on 5/7/52 a CIA official requested

Bureau's views regarding validity of information we were receiving

employed in channeling information from NAME

Significantly, under procedure then, NAME directed communica

tions to CIA with copies to Bureau.

CIA was told that as it

appeared NAME

mending any method of dissemination and it was up to CIA to handle

problem.

In the ensuing period, dispute arose between CIA and

NAME

over channeling of information and Bureau made every

effort to stay out of dispute.

In late 1952, for example, C/A

inquired if Bureau's views regarding dissemination had changed.

He was told they certainly had not and again informed that Bureau's

desire was to receive all information of interest no matter how

INTERNAL SECURITY LEADS IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES

Item number 10 in the material submitted to the

unb Agent 5*

3/5/70 discussed our furnishing leads to our Legal Attaches

(Legats) without advising Central Intelligence Agency (CIA)

or requesting the Agency to handle the, lead.

...

The observations of Special Agent Papich in this

matter are broad and

general in nature. His presentation is

hinged upon the premise advanced by the Agency that "internal

security" cannot be separated from "counterintelligence,"

thereby

necessitating our advising CIA of requests to our

Legats to have leads covered in foreign countries.

The Manual

of Instructions, Section 102, page 23, states CIA's responsibilities

include collection, collation, evaluation, coordination and

dissemination of intelligence information. CIA does not have,

among other things, responsibility for "internal security

functions."

In the absence of unusual situations,: we forward

investigative.leads pertaining to our cases in

countries there

we have liaison coverage to the particular Légal Attache

concerned.

Through his contacts the Legat arranges for the

necessary

investigation and

submits the desired information

according to our reporting needs. The Legat coordinates

this activity on a

• local level..

It is more desirable to have our representatives

request investigation abroad in order to achieve maximum coverage,

and to maintain tight control so we can insure that we fulfill

our responsibilities.

None.

we operated informants' in Cuba during the period we had a

Logat Office in Havana and did not coordinate our operations

after Castro came on the scene, approval was granted to turn

certain

informants over to CIA. Papich also refers to a

turned over to CIA to obtain complete coverage. We, of course,

bad no coverage of Venezuela. Bureau had not advised other

agencies of this source since we did not want Castro to uncover

any operational activities which might embarrass the Bureau.

The entire operation was later turned over to CIA.

CIA began its operations in Havana in 4/47 and in a

letter to the Bureau, 4/28/53, regarding Havana informants,

NAME noted that CIA was not overly cooperative and that,

1n fact, it was not developing pertinent information. At that

time NAME met with the CIA representative in Havana who

CIA REQUEST FOR BUREAU LECTURE

refusal of a 1958 CIA request for

NAME

on communism before a CIA group. Papich stated that CIA accepted

this as an affront and a blatant refusal to cooperate on a most

, CIA requested NAME

to address a selected

group of CIA personnel on the communist movement in the U.S.

CIA suggested dates of 12/9,10, or 11/58. The Director by routing

slip attached to NAME

letter commented, "It seems strange

that CIA should seek this when its top representative in Japan

considers FBI as a bunch of mere

'flat-feet' and the dangers

of communism as something conjured up in the minds of the FBI.

But then again I note request doesn't comé from the Director

it would give NAME

In this case.

In February, 1963, ClA made available information fron

inquiry of CIA personnel in pLAcE had been made concerning

one of the individuals previously identified as FORGIN

agent

and also requests had been made for certain biographical data

concerning other incividuals.

Legal Attache noted that CIA

personnel in PLACE had indicated they were previously aware

of the NAME Case and were impressed with the extreme sensitivity

of the case. We furnished

this information to CIA headquarters

and on 5/7/63 CIA referred to the incident and stated that it

was a matter of serious concern to it, requesting that any

This practice

was closely followed. The Director observed in January, 1964g

that he thought the

whole thing had been imaginary on the part

of CIA which had been played as a sucker by NAME

The

Director added that no more time should be wasted on it, at

least until CIA restrictions were removed. We continued

to attempt to get the restrictions removed without success and

covered outstanding leads.

In September, 1964, an analysis of the case disclosed

that although thirty-eight separate investigations were opened

only threeFoREIGN agents were uncovered. Original allegations

Of FOREIGH intent to mount an espionage mission in the United States

could not be substantiated. This information, coupled with the

fact that CIA refused

to make NAME

available to us tior

the purpose of resolving discrepancies, prompted a decision

transmitted by us to CIA on 9/30/64 that we were closing our

investigation in this case.

Mr. Papich commented in his memorandum of 3/5/70

CIA never has been satisfied with the efforts made by the

Bureau in this case. Our review indicates our efforts in the

matter were as full and complete as possible under circumstances

where CIA refused to grant us access to the source, did not

respond to request for clarifying data and declined to remove

restrictions making it impossible to take necessary investigative

steps.

Should any question be raised in the future, we are in

a position to document our difficulties experienced

with CIA.

RECOMMENDED ACTION:

None. We do not believe, in light of the facts set

forth, that CIA will make an issue of this,matter.

SUBJECT: RELATIONSHIP WITH CENTRAL

INTELLIGENCE AGENCY (CIA)

DISSENINATION OF CIA INFORMATION

IN A BUREAU MONOGRAPH

Item 20 submitted to the Director by Sam Papich in his

memorandum 3/5/70 mentions the dissemination of a Bureau monograph

dated 5/5/65 and entitled "Communism in the Dominican Republic."

Special Agent (SA) Papich stated that due to the

urgency of the

document Bureau did not obtain CiA clearance to include CIA

information in the monograph which was disseminated to interested

agencies, including CIA. According to SA Papich, CIA never

as aphora

made any protest although it considered our action a violation

of the "third agency rule."

Although the monograph referred to by SA Papich did

contain CIA data, it also set forth highly significant data

obtained by Bureau through our own informants. The CIA data

was biographical in nature and was used in the monograph to

characterize the past, including, communist contacts, of key

figures in the Dominican Republic.

It was taken from the 1963

CIA Biographical Handbook and CIA

telegrams dating back to 1961,

all of which were

previously disseminated to the U.S. intelligence.

community by CIA.

No attempt was made in the monograph to

characterize CIA data as Bureau information and, in fact,

this

information was attributed to "another Government agency," in

accordance with established procedures.

The so-called "thira '

agency rule" provides that

classified information originating in a department or agency

will not be disseminated outside the receiving agency without

the permission of the originating agency. However, an exception

to this rule provides that the receiving agency may disseminate

such data to other members of the U.S. Intelligence

of which Bureau is a' member, unless

Board (USIB),

the originating agency

uses appropriate control markings limiting its data

to the

use of the receiving agency only.

The CIA data used in the

Bureau monograph had no such control markings and our monograph

was disseminated to the President, the Attorney General and

USIB members only.

Nemorandum to Mr. C. D. DeLoach

RE: RELATIONSHIP WITH CENTRAL

The Bureau's monograph was a compendium of our own

It was prepared under emergency

conditions for the President and had a significant bearing

on the understanding and handling by the intelligence community

of a serious crisis which confronted this country.

RECOMMENDED ACTION:

• None.

We do not believe, in light of the facis

set forth, that CIA will make an issue of this matter.

Director, Allen Dulles, later expressed disappointment that we

did not contact CIA beforehand but that an agreement satisfactory

to all concerned was eventually worked out.

Papich also says that

in late 1959 we gave consideration to establishing a Legat in

Denmark

but did not inform CIA.of our intentions.

In contemplation of the stationing of a Legat in Denmar's,

Bulet of 12/7/59 instructed Legat, PLALE

SUBJECT: RELATIONSHIPS WITH CIA

COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES - AFRICA

Item number 28 in memorandum of 3/5/70 from SA Sam

Papich to the Director, captioned "Cases and/or Situations

Involving Conflict With CIA," states that in April, 1960,

CIA inquired if the Bureau would give any consideration to

• assisting that agency toward developing coverage in Africa by

providing a Negro informant or placing a Negro in the Communist

Party, USA for the purpose of eventually using him in Africa.

His memorandum added that we told that agency the EBI had no

informants available because they were necessary for our own

operations.

He claims we took the position since we saw no

benefit to be gained by loaning an informant on a short or

Iong

torm basis.

Ho states that CIA could argue that as carly

as 1960 it had

foresight to recognize the need for additional

coverage and when it appealed to the Bureau for assistance,

we did not cooperate.

He refers to his memorandum dated 4/7/60

concerning this matter captioned "Communist Activities in Africa."

The memorandum referred to discloses that on 4/5/60

NAME AND POSITION

• CIA, Stated

•that communist organizations were rapidly increasing in strength

on the continent of

Africa and 'that his agency. found

! it most

diffIcult to establish effective penetration.

NAME

noted that

in this connection it was almost impossible for a white man to

move about Africa and establish a relationship which would enable

him to develop worthwhile sources.

He asked'if the Bureau would

consider furnishing one of its

Negro informants or developing an

Informant in the Communist Party, USA for eventyal use by CIA in

Africa.

Papich told At&

that

if the Bureau had a good Negro

informant, we certainly were not interested in having his future

jeopardized nor did we want to lose his production.

Papich

added that it undoubtedly would be most difficult to take a Bureau

informant, have him'travel to Africa under some cover and still

be able to satisfactorily explain such activities to his communist

colleagues without becoming a target of suspicion. KAHE

said

he recognized all this but asked if the Bureau would give

Item number 30 in the material submitted to the

discusses a dispute we had with CIA in May, 1953, as a result

of a communication the Bureau sent to the President's Foreign

Intelligence Advisory Board (PFIAB). It was pointed out that

in our communication

• to PFIAB we attributed certain information

to Mccone, then Director of CIA, concerning the matter of

increasing wire taps on diplomatic establishments. McCone

charged

that the information attributed to him was not so

because he had never made any such statement and he could

prove it. The fact was that the information relating to

McCone had been given us by one of his subordinates who had

indicated the information originated with McCone.

McCone

maintained that we should have checked with him

before going

on record that any information had originated with him.

A review of the file in this matter discloses! that

source of the information set forth in our letter.

The last

paragraph of this letter includes a statement that the

impression gained from a review of CIA reports indicates that

CIA had

some

coverage reflecting there were to be troubles

concerning Mr. Nixon's Latin American travels. This letter

also stated as follows:

, "It is significant that information in the indi-

vidual countries came to CIA's attention shortly before your

arrival in a particular country.

Therefore, there is a

question as to whether or not CIA had coverage in communist

organizations which would have led to the development of

information concerning communist plans days or weeks ahead of

your visit."

There is no indication in this file regarding

instructions given to prepare our letter of May 16, 1958.

The first paragraph of this letter indicates that the Director

had a discussion with Mr. Nixon on May 16, 1958, inasmuch as

the first sentence of the above letter reads as follows:

"Apropos of our discussion today, there is set

forth information contained in Central Intelligence Agency

reports received from them on May 14, 1958."

The data set forth in our May 16, 1958, letter to

I. That most of the information in our letter to

letter could be interpreted

as raising the question concerning

the quality of CIA's coverage in Latin America.

There is no dispute as to the source of the informa-

tion which was

summarized In our letter to hir. Nixon, and we

clearly indicated in our letter that the source was CIA. With

regard to any question being raised as to the quality of

CIA's coverage in Latin America, we merely pointed out to

Mr. Nixon something that was readily discernible to any 'reader

the CIA reports - - that is,

that the information from CIA

popped up rather suddenly as related to the country and

Mr. Nixon's arrival.

Certainly Mr. Nixon himself, since he

was personally involved in demonstrations directed against

him during his Latin American trip, must have been aware that

advance information from our responsible intelligence agency

(CIA) may have been lacking.

EXCHANGE OF TECHNICAL INFORMATION

Item number 34 in the material submitted to the

Director by sA sam Papich in his memorandum 3/5/70 concerns

exchange of technical information with CIA, particularly is

it related to

the technical surveillance field. Papich states

CIA exhibited its equipment to us, but for many years we declined

to show any of our devices, with some exceptions. He states

that CIA never made an official protest but informally indicated

from time to time that the lack of exchange was prejudicial to

overall intelligence and internal security interests and implied

we were more open with the British in this area than with CIA.

Papich states this situation does not exist today as there is

a good exchange by the Bureau and CIA.

Our files reveal that through the years CIA has

furnished the Bureau a number of technical devices for our use

or inspection.

They have also furnished technical manuals obtained

abroad and briefed us on operational and technical aspects of

some

of their operations abroad. • Laboratory personnel have

been

afforded tours and briefings concerning CIA facilities ahd

equipment and in two instances Bureau personnel have been afforded

training at CIA schools.

As recently as October, 1969, CIA

SUBJECT: RELATIONSHIPS WITH

CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY

(POSITIVE INTELLIGENCE)

Item Number 37 in the material submitted to the

Director by Special Agent Sam Papich in his memorandum 3/5/70

discusses CIA criticism which could generate from Agency belief

that Bureau has failed to cooperate and offer necessary assistance

in collection of positive intelligence in the United States.

Memorandum is to deal with specific cases believed by Papich

to evidence lack oi cooperation and to briefly comment on policy

of cooperation we have adopted with CIA.

SYNOPSIS:

Mentioned Item by Papich points out CIA belief that

more aggressive action should have been taken in field of

collecting positive intelligence in the United States. Papich

notes Bureau's action in this field, fox the most part, has been

restricted to compliance with requests by State Department when

political crises occur in some country. He points out CIA belief

that acquiring needed data would mean increased technical surveil-

Lance coverage, developm papichinformants and collection of

cryptographic material.

cites two specific cases occurring

in 1969 where Bureau declined CIA's request for technical coverage,

suggesting to Agency that it make its request directly to the

Attorney General.

Review of specific cases mentioned set forth

with Director's comments relative thereto being noted. Our

policy of cooperation with CIA most recently delinated to field

by SAC Letter 66-10 (B) - copy attached.

SAC letter calls for

guarding our jurisdiction but shows our willingness to cooperate

with CIA.

CIA has repeatedly raised the issue in the past of

our coverage in the positive intelligence collection area and

we can

reasonably expect similar issues to be raised in the

future.

RECOMMENDED ACTION:

Memorandum to Mr.

ü. D. DeLoach

RE:

RELATIONSHIPS WITH

CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY

DETAILS:

Papich points out CIA feels there is unexplored

field for acquiring positive intelligence in the United States

but he notes that there has been no law, directive, or executive

order which fixes responsibility for clandestine collection of

such information. He notes we investigate subversives, spies,

and develop penetrations of foreign intelligence services and

that facets of these investigations of violations of United States

laws serve

to fulfill a counterintelligence objective referred

to by us as investigations of internal security matters. Papich

notes, however, that most of our work in the positive intelligence

field has been

restricted to the compliance with requests by

State Department prompted usually by a political crisis occurring

in some foreign country.

Papich

points out CIA feels there is unexplored

field for acquiring positive intelligence requiring use of

vastly increased technical surveillances,

informant development

and collection of cryptographic material. According to Papich,

CIA does not feel Bureau

has moved aggressively in this area

and CIA has been thwarted in attempts to do much about the

problem.

Papich cites two cases NAME

and

where CIA requests for technical surveil-

lance were declined by us with the suggestion to CIA that these

matters should be taken up by that Agency directly with the

Attorney General.

The Director's letter to NAME

noted that

after careful review it was felt that CIA should take this

Special Agent Papich that inthe future CIA should transmit its

to the Attorney General. This specifically covered the cases

Of MAME

The Director commented "Right."

Bureau Policy of Cooperation

In 1965 and 1966, recognizing overlapping interests,

changes inherent in faster communication, hysteria to facilitate

international travel and in response to requests from CIA,

the

Director approved Bureau attendance at conferences with CIA

regarding

that Agency's operational activities in the United States.

On a memorandum reporting the

results of the conferences with

CIA, the Director commented "I hope we still don't let our

guard down as CIA has always outsmarted'us because of our

gullibility."

SAC Letter 66-10 (B) dated 2/15/66 furnished to the

fIeld and Bureau offiçials results of the conferences with CIA

and emphasized necessity for protecting Bureau jurisdiction.in

the counterintelligence field. This SAC letter (copy attached)

emphasized there is to be no interference with or infringement

upon our jurisdiction but clearly shows our willingness

to

cooperate with CIA in developing positive intelligence in the

United States. In approving this SAC letter, the Director

noted "I hope

there is. no

"sneaker' in this.

Time will tell."

There has been

no renewed request from cIA for

technical coverage in the cases mentioned above,

nor has there

been any indication that such requests have been sent by CIA

to the

Attorney General as we suggested. Due to CIA interest

in the past in these matters, we cannot

rule out the possibility

the Agency may approach Attorney General for the desired

coverage at some time in the future.

(B) CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY - OPCRATIONS IN THE UNITED

STATES -- The Bureau recently completed discussions with the Central

Intelligence Agency (CIA) regarding that aceney's operational activitics in

the United States.

These ascussions essentinily deeit with CIA'S assessment

and recruitment of foreign intelligenre sources in the United States, Pndlosed

for your use is a lisi oi the ground rules which bot agencies nave accepted

as guidelines for effecting the necessary coordination. In order that you may

be adequately oriented in this matter, the following background is set orth.

The need for the ground rules is related to Cli's interesi in dereloping

positive intelligence sources in the Unitec Staies and the necessity for

protecting the Bureau's jurisdiczion in the counterintelligence field, Tie

latter is essential to the adequate ascharge of our responsibilities to

national security.

Positive intelligence may be described as a comprchensive product

resulting froni collectior, evaluation, collation, analysis, and interpretation

of all available information relating to national security and concerning other

countries where such information is significant to our Co: ernient's riesel?-

ment and execution of plans: policies, and courses of action, Such intelligence

can be divided into various categories, suen as econonic, military, scientific.

political, geographic, st cerera. The collection ot positive incelligence is

distinguished from counterintelligence waieh is primarily designed to pendacte.

United States. Therefore, in the absence of any statuory prerogative to conduc-

of a positive intelligence nature. This requires Bureau action designed to

bring about the necessary coverage. A good exaniple is our involvement

in the development oi information relating to the crisis in the Dominican

Republic. From the above you will recognize that there can be "gray areas"

of interest to the Bureau and CIA. It, therefore, has been necessary to

effect adequate coordinating machinery.

The potential for the development of positive inteiligence in this

country is vast and varied. Voluminous positive intelligence is collected

overtly through the review of foreign and comestic publications, interviews

of travelers, arriving aliens, contacts with scientists, et cetera. In this

area there have been no serious issues between the Bureau and CIA.

However, in the field of clandestine development of positive

intelligence both agencies have an interest, and there is a necessity for a

clear-cut understanding of jurisdiction and coordination. Particularly is

this true in the development of positive intelligence sources who are

employees or officials of foreign governments stationed in the United States

or who are visiting this country on a temporary basis.

For many years he Bureau has had a continuing program of

developing sources in diplomatic installations for the purpose of discharging

our counterintelligence responsibilities and incidentally ior developing

positive intelligence information which might assist the Government in

formulating policy. The Bureau, recognizing CIA s need for sources in the

positive intelligence field, has permitted CIA to assess and recruit sources in

the United States in a limited manner with the understanding that such activities

are fully coordinated with the Bureau. In January, 1964. CIA established

their Domestic Operations Division (DOD) to conduct such operations in the

United States. and certain Bureau field offices were alerted and furnished

the necessary guidance and instructions. The recent discussions with CIA

resulted in a refinement of the understanding of the ground rules established

in January, 1964.

The enclosed ground rules will be applied by the Bureau and CIA

as cases arise. The Bureau position in each matter will be decided at the

Seat of Government. As a general rule, Bureau Headquarters will be informed

by Cla regarding its interest in an individual or a target. Prior to notification

of CIA regarding our position, the situation will be carefully reviewed at the

Seat of Government. This may often include a request to the field for

observations and recommendations before notice is transmitted to CIA. A:

the same time, it is possible that you may be contacted in the field by a

representative of DOD, CIA. If so, you should be guided by the enclosed

ground rules in any discussions, bearing in mind that the approval for any

particular operational activity is to be made at Bureau Headquarters..

You should hoid to the concept that the protection of the interna!

security of the Unitea States involves very basic clear-cut responsibilities

of the FBI. This should be kept in mind in each case and in any contacts

which you may have with CIA representatives. There is to be no interfere-ce

with or infringement upon our jurisdiction. It is recognized that unforesee.

developments may create siations not adequately covered by the ground zies.

You, therefore, should report such matters to the Bureau setting forth

complete details with your recommendations. Although we have been inforzied

by CIA that the Bureau's jurisdiction and operational interests will not be

interfered with, we cannot discount the results of past experiences stemming

from CIA's operational and organizational deficiencies. We have no reaso. io

believe that there will be a revolutionary change of these conditions. It is.

therefore, incumbent upon you to be extremely alert for any breakdown of the

adherence to the ground rules. I emphasize that this is an area of activity

which must be closely monitored by each Special Agent in Charge. You

should be certain that your personnel is adequately oriented so that the Bureau

can have the full benefit of any constructive suggestions pertaining to this

entire matter.

Item Number 38 in the material submitted to the

a sort of summary in which SA Papich indicates that he cannot

recall the names of other cases which resulted in CIA displeasure

or criticism, but does cite one instance "early in the 1950's"

in which we disseminated data from a source of unknown reliability

charging Allen Dulles as having been a communist and & spy

while in Europe.

By letter 3/22/52, we informed State and CIA that a

source of unknown reliability had alleged that 1PENflING

he definitely did not want to make "a big thing" of the letter,

that it was not that important, and that maybe it would be better

to drop the matter.. General Smith (then Director of Central

relations between Bureau and CIA with NAME I

head of private

intelligence network (NAME & PaS

NAME/'s aide who had liaison

with Bureau) •

Problem: Papich states we never informed CIA we were receiving

information from NAME I

which was also of interest to CIA;

and that while it is possible MAME l had given same data to

CIA, we do not know.

Analysis: NAME/ ' was financed by CIA during early 19505 {2.5-,

CIA budgeted $650,000

fOr NAME,

in 1952) . (62-77306-60) • There

is ample evidence CIA

knew we were receiving information from

NAME! • We do know some information was given by NAME, to:

CIA and

Bureau jointly.. NAME 2, fox example, told us of

conference in early 1951 between CIA officials and NAME 1. when

it was agreed information might be furnished directly to FBI by

NAME / i provided CIA was advised by Nauel of what mas given...

(62-77306-23) Moreover, on 5/7/52 a CIA official requested

Bureau's views regarding validity of information we were receiving

frOm NAME I

and asked for our views regarding method to be

employed in channeling information from NAMa! to Bureau.

Significantly, under procedure then, NAME / directed communica-

tions to CIA with copies to Bureau.

CIA was told that as it

appeared NAME I

was an appendage of CIA, Bureau was not recom-

mending any method of dissemination and it was up to CIA to handle

problem. (62-77306-25)

In the ensuing period, dispute arose between CIA and

NAME I

over channeling of information and Bureau-made every

effort to stay out of dispute. In late 1952, for example, Helms

inquired if Bureau's views regarding dissemination had changed.

He was told they certainly had not and again informed that Bureau's

desire was to receive all information of interest no matter how

received. (62-77306-27) Our position of not becoming involved in

COMMISSION ON THE ORGANIZATION OF THE

EXECUTIVE BRANCH OF THE GOVERNMENT

(HERBERT HOOVER COMMISSION - 1954)

Item number nine in the material submitted to the

Director by SA Sam Papich in his memozandum 3/5/70 discusses

the Hoover Commission survey of CIA operations in 1954.

to Papich, there was talk within CIA that the Bureau had furnishe

the names of subversives within CIA to Senator McCarthy.

Senator Joseph R. McCarthy (R-Wisc) was Chairman of the Senate

Investigations Subcommittee.

General Mark Clark headed the Task Force which

surveyed CIA operations between 9/54 and 6/55. In 10/54, CIA

alleged that the McCarthy Committee was attempting to develop

information regarding CIA operations.

According to the Washington

Star, 10/1/54, McCarthy said CIA was

"one of the worst situations

we have as far as communist infiltration is concerned."

He said

he would give his data relative to this matter to Clark's Task

force.

According to the Washington Star, 1/15/55, McCarthy

said he had given Clark information relative to alleged communist .

• infiltration of CIA.' As of 1/17/55, CIA had not received from

Clark the names of those considered security risks but CIA

believed it had done a good job of removing security risks and

believed that it was in good

shape.

On 1/21/55, the Task Force requested name checks on

security risks named

by McCarthy. Memoranda containing the

results of those checks were given to the Task Force on 2/8/55.

On 5/13/55, the Bureau received a letter from Clark asking for

investigations relative to character, reputation, and. loyalty

of individuals mentioned as security risks.

CIA was aware of

the names as we asked it for identilying data concerning them.

Clark was later advised that the investigations would entail

Interviews at CIA, review of its programs, inquiries in foreign

countries, and the like and he withdrew his request.

RELATIONSHIPS WITH CIA

THE PRESIDENT'S FOREIGN INTELLIGENCE

ADVISORY BOARD AND JOHN MC CONE

Item number 30 in the material submitted to the

Director by SA San Papich in his memorandum of March 5, 1970,

discusses a dispute we had with CIA in May, 1963, as a result

of a communication the Bureau sent to the President's Foreign

Intelligence Advisory Board (PFIAB). 'It was pointed out that

in our communication to PFIAB we attributed certain information

to McCone, then Director of CIA, concerning the matter of

increasing wire taps on diplomatic establishments.

McCone

charged that the information attributed to him was not so

because he had never made

any such statement and he could

prove it.

The fact was that the information relating to

McCone had been given us by one of his subordinates who had

indicated the information originated with McCone.

McCone

maintained that we should have checked with him before going

on record that any information had originated with him.

A review of the file in this matter discloses that

in April, 1963, Mr. Belmont along with Papich had discussed

with Richard Helms and James Angleton of CIA McCone's alleged

position with the PFIAB; that he was in favor of across the

board telephone taps on diplomatic establishments.

Bureau, of course, wasopposed to this and advised Helms that

we would request to make our position known before the board.

specifically asked what he should tell McCone and Mr. Belmont

the meeting; that the Bureau was opposed to across the board

wire taps and the Bureau intended to so advise PFIAB.

RECOMMENDED ACTION:'

None.

We do

not believe, in light of the facts set

forth, that CIA will make an issue

this matter.

mentions Bureau letter 5/16/58 sent to the then Vice

President Nixon and containing a summary of CIA informa

tion concerning events in Latin America relating to

Mr. Nixon's trip there during 5/58.

According to SA Papich, most of the information

in above letter came from CIA. He commented that this

letter could be interpreted as raising question concerning

quality of CIA's coverage in Latin America. Papich noted

it is not known if CIA ever became. aware of the letter.

Papich stated that General Robert Cushman, currently Deputy

Director of CIA, was attached to the then Vice President

Nixon's staff. SA Papich pointed out that CIA, if aware of

above letter, could raise question as to violation of Third

Agency Rule.

source of the information set forth in our letter. The last

paragraph of this letter includes a statement that the

impression gained from a review of CIA reports indicates that

CIA had some coverage reflecting there were to be troubles

concerning Mr. Nixon's Latin American travels. This letter

also stated as follows:

vidual countries came to CIA's attention shortly before your

arrival in a particular country. Therefore, there is a

question as to whether or not CIA had coverage in communist

organizations which would have led to the development of

information concerning communist plans days or weeks ahead of

your visit."

There is no indication in this file regarding

instructions given to prepare our letter of May 16, 1958.

The first paragraph of this letter indicates that the Director

had a discussion with Mr. Nixon on May 16, 1958, inasmuch as

the first sentence of

the above letter reads as

follows:

"Apropos of our discussion today, there is set

forth information contained in Central Intelligence Agency

reports received from them on May 14, 1958."

The data set forth in our May 16, 1958, letter to

Mr. 'Nixon is contained in a memorandum Mr. R. R.

Roach, to

Mr. A. H. Belmont dated May 15, 1958, which was prepared for

the Director's information.

The Director noted on this memo-

randum, "Send summary to A. G. H." In accordance with

instructions, a letter was sent to the then Attorney General

date of May 16, 1958, and this letter contained a summary.

of CIA information in the same manner as had been sent to

Mr. Nixon on May 16, 1958.

Our letter to the Attorney General,

however, did not contain any observations regarding.CIA

coverage in Latin American countries visited by Mr. Nixon and

his party.

Colonel Cushman's request was set forth in memorandum

tion that Colonel

Cushman be advised that if the information

were to be given to the press, it would undoubtedly create a

serious problem as the FBI would then have violated CIA's

confidence since CIA was aware that SA Papich had reviewed

CIA's classified reports

As indicated above, Colonel Cushman, who was a member of

authority to do so, and we follow this rule unless there

are overriding reasons. With regard to our letter to

(POSITIVE INTELLIGENCE)

Item Number 37 in the material submitted to the

Director by Special Agent Sam Papich in his memorandum 3/5/70

discusses CIA criticism which could generate from Agency belief

that Bureau has failed to cooperate and offer necessary assistance

in collection of positive intelligence in the United States.

Memorandum is to deal with specific cases believed by Papich

to evidence lack of cooperation and to briefly comment on policy

of cooperation we have adopted with CIA.

SYNOPSIS:

Mentioned Item by Papich points out CIA belief that

more aggressive action should have been taken in field of

collecting positive intelligence in the United States.

Papich

notes Bureau's action in this field, for the most part, has been

restricted to compliance with requests by State Department when

political crises occur in some country.

He points out CIA belief

that acquiring needed data would mean

increased technical surveil-

lance coverage, developmepapie informants and collection of

cryptographic material.

cites two specific cases occurring

in 1969 where Bureau declined CIA's request for technical coverage,

suggesting to Agency that it make its request directly to the :

Attorney General. Review of specific cases mentioned set forth

with Director's comments relative thereto being noted.

Our

policy of cooperation with CIA most recently delinated to field

by SAC Letter 66-10 (B) - copy attached. SAC letter calls for

guarding our jurisdiction but shows our willingnéss to cooperate

CIA has repeatedly raised the issue in the past of

we

future.

DETAILS:

Papich points out CIA feels there is unexplored

field for acquiring positive intelligence in the United States

but he notes that there has been no. law, directive, or executive

order which fixes responsibility for clandestine collection of

such information. He notes we investigate subversives, spies,

and develop penetrations of foreign intelligence services and

that facets of these investigations of violations of United States

laws serve to fulfill a counterintelligence objective referred

to by us as investigations of internal security matters.

Papich

notes, however, that most of our work in the positive intelligence

field has

been

restricted to the compliance with requests by

State Department prompted usually by a political crisis occurring

in some foreign country.

Papich

points out CIA feels there is unexplored

field for acquiring positive intelligence requiring use of

vastly increased technical surveillances,

informant development

and collection of cryptographic material.

According to Papich,

CIA does not feel Bureau has moved aggressively in this area

and CIA has been thwarted in attempts to do much about the

problem.

• Papich cites two cases (Alfred S. Gonsalves, 10/69 and

Lalman Shapiro,

10/69) where CIA requests for technical surveil-

lance were declined by us with the suggestion to CIA that these

matters should be taken up by that Agency directly with the

Attorney General.

Specific Cases

CIA advised that Alfred S. Gonsalves, Deputy Permanent

Representative of the Indian United Nations Delegation,

had been .

under development by a Soviet intelligence service partly as

a result of his weakness

for women when assigned in Moscow

from 1957 to 1961. Gonsalves was to participate, in bilateral

talks with United States

officials

in October, 1969.

By letter

9/26/69 CIA requested telephone and microphone surveillances on

Gonsalves.

The Director commented "Let CIA seek the authority

of the AG. I don't want them utilizing FBI as their channel."

Zalman M. Shapiro was originally investigated by us

in 1965 as a possible unregistered agent of the Israeli Govern-

ment due to negotiations by him with Israeli officials designed

to set up a semiprivate nuclear processing company in Israel.

Memorandum to Mr. C. D. DeLoach

RE:

RELATIONSHIPS WITH

CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY

Our investigation showed close contact by Shapiro with Israeli

Officials, strong pro-Israel sentiments by Shapiro and details

of activity by that subject to create the firm mentioned.

Shapiro headed a Pittsburgh firm involved in Atomic Energy

Commission (AEC) work requiring "Top Secret clearance by AEC.

Our initial investigation was closed when Assistant Attorney

General - Internal Security Division found that facts did not

justify soliciting Shapiro's registration as a foreign agent.

In Spring of 1965, sixty-one kilograms of nuclear

material were found to be unaccounted for by the firm headed

by Shapiro, but subsequent inventories and checking by AEC

revealed this shortage was probably the result of cumulative

process of wasteful production methods over a period of eight

years and did not justify an unqualified determination of a

diversion of nuclear material on the

part of Shapiro to

unauthorized persons or government.

CIA, in 1968, became alarmed on receipt of information

of loss of mentioned nuclear material and despite AEC findings

felt it may indicate illegal diversion or at least justification

for reopening investigation. Richard Helms of CIA contacted

the Attorney General directly with his thoughts regarding the

need for additional investigation. Attorney General contacted

Bureau requesting it discuss matter with CIA and determine

advisibility of additional investigation.

The Director, in

approving conference with CIA, noted "OK but I doubt advisibility

of getting into this.

It looks, like Helms is going around

'us to aG as he suspects we would say no."

An intensive investigation of Shapiro conducted

during, late 1968 and into Fall of 1969 revealed no positive

intelligence activity on his part or verifiable diversion of

AEC material to Israel. Our investigation included technical

surveillances installed 9/27/68 and discontinued, 9/4/69. Shapiro

was

interviewed by AEC 8/14/69 and disclaimed passing any

classified data to Israeli Government.

Facts of case were

reviewed by Department of Justice which found no evidence of pro-

secutable violation by Shapiro.

AEC felt the additional investi-

gation produced no data upon which could be based a legitimate

withdrawal of clearance for AEC contracts or information.

In

view of this, we closed our investigation and CIA was so advised.

A 10/13/69 letter from Helms acknowledged additional investigation

would produce no legal evidence pertinent to the issue which

prompted CIA's original request but noted he felt reinstituted

audio surveillances of Shapiro would produce positive intelligence

information.

He therefore requested reinstitution of this

*coverage.

The Director's letter to Helms 10/17/69 noted that

after. careful review it was felt that CIA should take this

matter

,to the Attorney General.

On October 21, 1969, a CIA official was told by

Special Agent Papich that inthe future CIA should transmit its

requests for technical surveillance coverage in the United States

to the Attorney General. This specifically covered the cases

of Gonsalves and Shapiro. The Director commented "Right."

Bureau Policy of Cooperation

In 1965 and 1966, recognizing overlapping interests,

changes inherent in faster

communication, hysteria to facilitate

international travel

and in response to requests from CIA, the

Director approved Bureau attendance at conferences with CIA

regarding that Agency's operational activities in the United States.

On a memorandum reporting the results of the conferences with

CIA,

the Director commented "I hope we still don't let our

guard down as CIA has always outsmarted us because of our

gullibility."

SAC Letter 66-10 (B) dated 2/15/66 furnished to the

field and Bureau officials results of the conferences with CIA

and emphasized necessity for protecting Bureau jurisdiction in

the counterintelligence field. This SAC letter (copy attached)

emphasized there is to be. no interference with or infringement

upon our jurisdiction but clearly shows our willingness to

cooperate with CIA in developing positive intelligence in the

United States. In approving this SAC letter, the Director

noted "I hope

• there is no 'sneaker' in this.

Time will tell.".

There has been no renewed request from CIA for

technical coverage in the cases mentioned above, nor has there

been any indication that such requests have been sent. by CIA

to the Attorney General as we suggested. Due to CIA interest

in the past in these matters, we cannot

rule out the possibility

the Agency may approach Attorney General for the desired

coverage at some time in the future.

(B) CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY - OPERATIONS IN THE UNITED

STATES - The Bureau recently completed discussions with the Certral

Intelligence Agency (CIA) regarding that agency's operational activities in

the United States.

These discussions essentiaily dispit with CiA's assessment

and recruitment of foreign intelligence sources in the Unite States. Endlesed

for your use is a list of the ground rules which both agencies have accepted

as guidelines for effecting the necessary coordination. In order that you may

be adequately oriented in this matter, the following background is set forth.

•The need for the ground rules is related to CLA's interest in developing

positive intelligence sources in the United States and the necessity foi

protecting the Bureau's jurisdiction in the counterinteiligence field. The

latter is essential to the adequate discharge of our responsibilities to

national security.

Positive intelligence may be described is a compychensive product

resulting from collection, evaluation, collation, enalysis, and interpretation

of all available information relating to national security and concerning otae"

countries where such information is significant to our Covernment's develop-

ment and execution of plans: policies, and courses of action. Such intelligence

can be divided into various categories, such as economic; military, scientific:

political, geographic, et cerera.

The collection of pogitive intelligence is

distinguished from counterintelligence which is primarily designed lo penetrate.

monitor, neutralize and/or disrupt the foreign intelligence and security services.

Counterintelligence further includes other functions of an internal security

nature directed againsi subversive groups, organzations, and individuais, By

law CIA does not have any law enforcement or internal security funcuons CId's

authoritation for collecting positive intelligence is predicated on the Nationai

Security Act of 1947 and subsequent issuance oi National Socurity Connell

Directives. There is no law, directive, or charter which authorizes Cie to

engage in the clandestine development of positive intelligence sources in the

United States: Therefore, in the absence of any statuory prerogative in conduc:

.. such activity in the United States, it nes been mutually agrced by. FBI aid Cl

that the Agency can only engage in the clandestine developrent and handlig si

positive intelligence sources in this country by coordinating with the Bureau.

The Bureau in turn legally has the primary counterinielligence responstall?

in the U. S. and is continually deyeloping positive intelligence.

It, howster,

must be regarded an incidental product to our main objective.

The Burenu

"country is vast and varied. Voluminous positive intelligence is collected

overtly through the review of foreign and comestic publications, interviews

of travelers, arriving aliens, contacts with scientists, et cetera. In this

area there have been no serious issues between the Bureau and CIA.

However, in the field of clandestine development of positive

intelligence both agencies have an interest, and there is a necessity for a

clear-cut understanding of jurisdiction and coordination. Particularly is

this true in the development of positive intelligence sources who are

employees or officials of foreign governments stationed in the United States

or who are visiting this country on a temporary basis.

For many years the Bureau has had a continuing program of

developing sources in diplomatic installations for the purpose of discharging

our counterintelligence responsibilities and incidentally for developing

-

positive intelligence information which might assist the Government in

formulating policy. The Bureau, recognizing CIA's need for sources in the

positive intelligence field, has permitted CIA to assess and recruit sources in

the United States in a limited manner with, the understanding that such activities

are fully coordinated with the Bureau. In January, 1964, CIA established

their Domestic Operations Division (DOD) to conduct such operations in the

United States, and certain Bureau field offices were alerted and turnshea

.. the necessary guidance and instructions. The recent discussions with ClA

resulted in a refinement of the understanding of the ground rules established

in January, 1964.

The enclosed ground rules will be applied by the Bureau and CIA

as cases arise. The Bureau position in each matter will be decided at the

Seat of Government. As a general rule, Bureau Headquarters will be. informed

by ClA regarding its interest in an individual or a target. Prior to notification

of CIA regarding our position, the situation will be carefully reviewed at the

Seat.of Government. This may often include a request to the field for

the same time, it is possible that you may be contacted in the field by a

representative of DOD, CIA. Il so, you should be guided by the enclosed

ground rules in any discussions, bearing in mind that the approval for any

particular cperational activity is to be made at Bureau Headquarters.

You should hold to the concept that the protection of the internal

security of the United States involves very basic clear-cut responsibilities

of the FBI. This should be kept in mind in each case and in any contacts

which you may have with CIA representatives. 'There is to be no interference

with or infringement upon our jurisdiction. It is recognized that unforeseen

developments may create situations not adequately covered by the ground riles.

You, therefore, should report such matters to the Bureau setting forth

complete details with your recommendations. Although we have been informed

by CIA that the Bureau's jurisdiction and operational interests will not be

interfered with, we cannot discount the results, of past experiences stemming

from CIA's operational and organizational deficiencies. We have no reaso.. to

believe that there will be a revolutionary change of these conditions. It is.

therefore, incumbent upon you to be extremely alert for any breakdown of tie

adherence to the ground rules.

I emphasize that this is an area of activity

which must be closely monitored by each Special Agent in Charge: You

should be certain that your personnel is adequately oriented so that the Bureau

can have the full benefit of any constructive suggestions pertaining to this

entire matter.

Dear Mr. President:

FoReigN

GENERAL

In reference to our discussion concerning the serious inter- :

national situation and the need for more intelligence information of a high

quality, I have analyzed our coverage abroad.

We presently have eleven liaison offices located at Bern,

Switzerland; Bonn, Germany; Buenos Aires, Argentina; Hong Kong, British

Crown Colony; London, England; Madrid, Spain; Vexico City, Mexico;

Ottawa, Canada; Paris, France; Rome, Italy; and Tokyo, Japan, staffed by

twenty-eight Special Agents.

With your approval, we are in a position to increase our Agent

complement abroad by adding one man each to our offices in Paris, Bonn

and Rome, Jand two men to our offich in Buenos Aired, We are also in a

position to

establish pew offices atylel Aviv, Israel; Saigon, Vietnam;

Caracas,

Venezuela: San dose, Costa RiçayLa Paz, Bolivia; ancielsinki,

Finland.

We feel the new ofices, which we recommend be establisned

are desirable in view of the current crises in the Middle East and Vietnam,

which are subject to momentary escalation, and the recurring critical

situations in Central America and South America. An office in Helsinki

would present the advantage of having a listening post close to the Soviet border.

We are giving further consideration to expanding our domestic

coverage and to the possibility of additional expansion abroad for the purpose

of producing information in the foreign intelligence field.

I have been giving further consideration to the

expansion of the foreign operations of the FBI.

There is

lone more new office to which I would like, to have the

Director give consideration.

I refer to opening a'one-man full

office In Lebanon.

My reasons are as follows:

We all know the gravity and the great importance of

the Middle-East situation, involving Israel and the Arab

nations.

We will be opening an office in Israel.

We need

also to

penetrate the Arab world and gather intelligence

information of value to

the President.

It would be quite a

feat to do this. There is one country in which I am reason-

could get an office and develop some very fine

sources of Intormation, and this is Lebanon. I say this

because I have known Mr. William J.YBaroody, Director of the

American Enterprise Institute in washington or

some years.

He is a Lebanese.

He makes regular trips to Lebanon, has many

friends and relatives there, and has much, influence in that

country.

to supplement our production of intelligence by increasing domestic coverage

on diplomatic establishments of countries of particular interest where we

feel it will provide information of the type desired. Our foreign coverage

can be stepped up by assignment of 15 additional Agents abroad.

There are presently 28 Agents assigned to our 11 offices abroad.

Memorandum for Mr. Sullivan

Re: EXPANSION OF FBI FOREIGN

INTELLIGENCE COLLECTION EFFORTS

We have selected the six new locales for following reasons:

With respect to Tel Aviv, the Israelis have a most competent and

efficient intelligence-gathering network relating to the Arab countries and our

efforts would be directed toward enhancing the flow of strategic information of

this type to the U.S. In Saigon, Vietnam, there is an obvious critical situation

generating the development of political intelligence. We would also be in position

to develop on the spot the identities of Americans traveling in the area,

particularly those subversives who within our own country are working toward

the overthrow of our Government.

Caracas (Venezuela) is the capital of a country which has been a

prime target for Castro infiltration and subversion efforts. In addition, from

this strategic point we would be in position to develop political intelligence

regarding Colombia, Panama, Ecuador, Trinidad, Guyana and Surinam. There

are strong anti-American segments in all these countries working to deliver

them to Castro, Communist China and Soviet Russia. San Jose is located in

Costa Rica, the southern-most Central American country excluding Panama.

All Central American countries are presently covered as a road trip by Mexico

City Agent. Establishing San Jose as a Legat post would put us in the position

of having an office strategically located to report regarding countries which

are almost constantly in a state of rebellion and change. We would, of course,

eliminate the road trip out of Mexico in establishing San Jose as a Legat post.

La Paz is located in the country (Bolivia) where "Che" Guevara

was killed. It is strategic in its location in that it borders Chile to the south

where a communist regime is about to take over and Peru to the west which

is strongly anti-U. S. to the extent that U. S. interests are being confiscated.

Helsinki (Finland) is in a country bordering Russia and would give us a

strategic listening post in an area where there is a definite need for intelligence.

With respect to both Bolivia and Finland, however, we must be prepared to

encounter difficulties in establishing Legat operations because both governments

are oriented away from the U. S.

Expansion abroad would include the necessity of assigning additional

clerical personnel to certain existing offices as well as to the new offices.

Through past experience we know there is considerable high-level

political intelligence available within the U. S. which can be secured immediately

and with no risk through coverage of diplomats and diplomatic establishments by

technical surveillances. During past crises, such as those relating to the

Middle Hast, Panama,

Dominican Republic and Cuba, we have been able to

produce especially significant data through technical coverage of selected

establishments.

We recognize that should we expand our foreign coverage, certain

problems would arise in view of Centrai Intelligence Agency and State Depart-

ment interests in this area. However, we do feel the Bureau could provide

information through the expansion outlined above which would be of benefit to

the President and that any objections which may arise from other agencies can

be overcome.

ACTION:

(1) If approved, attached letter will be sent to the President advising

him of extent of our present coverage, expansion of our current offices, and

establishment of additional ones as outlined above.

(2) If approved, we will submit our recommendations with regard

to expanding our technical coverage of diplomats and diplomatic establishments

within the U. S. for purpose of producing the intelligence required by the President.

(3) If approved, office of Assistant to the Director J. P. Mohr will

proceed to recommend the additional personnel described above.

(4) If approved, we will instruct all Legats to expand their current

coverage and to advise of their plans and recommendations for accomplishing

this.

SUBJECT:

THE LEGAL ATTACHE PROGRAM

The Bureau's Foreign Liaison Program has proved to be an invaluable

adjunct to all categories of FBI investigative activity, particularly in view of the

proven incapability, if not indisposition, of CIA and other agencies to adequately

service our requests for inquiries overseas, or even more important, to aggressively

seek the manifold information of immediate value to the Bureau which is available

through well-developed foreign sources. It is obviously important to locate Legal

Attache (Legat) Offices geographically and to staff them in the manner that will

accrue to maximum advantae of the Bureau.

The purpose of this memorandum

is, at your request, briefly to analyze existing and potential foreign liaison coverage

from standpoints of both areas involved and personnel. This analysis will be

separated according to the three principal areas in which Legats are assigned:

Europe, the Far East, and the Wester Hemisphere.

WARE

EUROPE

The Bureau at present has five Legat Offices in Europe:

Paris,

H/2:4

France;

London, H

Rome, Italy Bonn, Germany; and Bern, Switzerland. All offices

process a high volume of cases, but most of this volume consists of uncomplicated

matters which lend themselves

to standardized -- almost mass production --

handling. Much more important than the number of cases turned over monthly

is the capability to develop sources who can handle Bureau inquiries immediately

and through whom new, pertinent, needed information can be received on a current

basis. In view of limited manpower, the main task facing each Legat is to exercise

great selectivity in airectng his efforts, eliminating all unnecessary ana marginally

productive activities.

...

539241=27W.E14

Paris: The Paris Office was reduced in complement in late 1967 from

3 Agents and 3 clerks to 2 Agents and 2 clerks. The office is now staffed by

exceptionally competent people, both Agent and clerical. A heavy work load is

being handled efficiently and without undue strain. Legat Paris covers the former

Madrid territory (Spain and Portugal) and is able to handle work in these two countries

through 3-day road trips about every six weeks. The former Madrid Office had

been regarded mainly as a "listening post" and was closed in; 1963 because of low

volume of work. Conceivably, if work in Africa increased greatly (it is now minimal),

[re-establishment of the Madrid Office should be considered. Another possibility

(is reassignment of the Spain-Portugal coverage from Paris to Rome, still keeping

Paris-asià 2+Agent

liaison with key's pyglerk office.

This would permit further intensification of

es ¡B'h®Rorimarily important areas of France and Belgium.

Re: The Legal Attache Program

SECRET

Rome: The Rome Office was cut in late 1967 from 3 Agents and 3 clerks to 2

Agents and 2 clerks. It is operating very smoothly with present complement and,

In fact, could carry a slightly heavier load. Legat Rome has substantially improvea

the imperfect liaison which existed in its territory two years ago. Since 1967

road trip coverage of Turkey and Lebanon was discontinued as unproductive.

Coverage is now limited to Italy and Greece, with one-week road trips to Greece

made every other month. The cases developed from the Greece road trip are

very routine in nature, consisting mostly of matters gleaned from review of U. S.

visa and immigration files in Athens. Assistant Legat Theodore A. Korontjis, who

mainly handles liaison in Greece, has informally expressed his intention of requesting

Ireturn to domestic assignment when his present tour expires in 1970. It is believed

that a Greek-speaking Agent is not essential for the type of work currently existing.

Replacement of Korontjis with a Spanish-speaking Agent would permit assumption

of Spain-Portugal coverage by the Rome Office, which Rome work load could well

accommodate. Airline distance from Rome to Spain and Portugal is only negligibly

greater than from Paris.

London: Legat London's complement was reduced from 3 Agents and 3

clerks to 2 Agents and 2. Clerks in late 1967. Work load is heavy but actually no

more so than that of Legat Paris, who had adjusted to the reduction somewhat more

gracefully. Continued attention to conscientious streamlining and selectivity and

economy in direction of effort can enable the London Office to function effectively

with existing personnel. However, if assignment of additional personnel to Legats

becomes practical, and especially if the Spain-Portugal responsibility were shifted

from Paris to Rome, London, of the 5 European offices could best justify a personnel

increase, and increase of clerical complement from 2 to 3 could be considered

warranted.

Bern: Complement of Legat Bern (I Agent and l clerk) has remained

unchanged since the office was opened. Bern covers Switzerland and Austria with

very occasional trips to the tiny principality of Liechtenstein.

Bonn: Complement of Legat Bonn was reduced in late 1967 from & Agents

and clerks to 2 Agents and & clerks. Bonn handles work in West Germany and the

Netherlands.

Both the Bern and Bonn Offices are productive and well managed, but

do not have visible expansion potentials that would necessitate or justify

additional personnel. Bonn is in a position to release one of its 3 clerk-stenographers

whenever necessary during extended leave of employees in the other European

Offices. • The Paris, London, Bonn and Rome Offices are all capable, through

good management, of releasing their second Agent temporarily for relief duty

as necessary in the one-man Bern Office.

FAR EAST

We have three Legats in the Far East: Tokyo, Japan Manita, in biry

Philippines; and the British Crown Colony of Hong Kong. All liaison in the

Orient was handled until 1961 by Legat Tokyo. The Manila Office was opened in

1961 and the Hong Kong Office in 1966 with appropriate allocation of geogaphic

responsibilities:

Preponderance of work in all three offices, and particularly in

Tokyo and Hong Kong, has been in the security category -- with main emphasis

on Chinese Communist matters.

A Pinema 01EL

Tokyo: In late 1967 complement of the Tokyo Office was reduced from.

2 Agentst and 2 clerks to 1 Agent and 2 clerks. Territory covered includes

Japa, Republic of China (Taiwan), South Korea and Okinawa. The latter 3 areas

are covered by road trip of about one week at 2-month intervals. Solidly established

sources provide a wealth of information of value to the Bureau, which of necessity

at present is processed most selectively by the Legat.

Sufficient potential for

further exploitation of sources in Japan and Taiwan exists to justify assignment of

a second Agent in event overseas expansion becomes feasible. Competence in the

•Japanese language, written as well as spoken, is important. Clerical complement

at Tokyo had been 3 until about 1965, when it was reduced to 2. The office has

operated efficiently through extensively streamlining with the 2 clerks, and can

continue to function with this complement although supply of relief clerks by Tokyo

to other Far Eastern Offices, is difficult.

Hong Kong:, "Complement of Legat Hong Kong has been

1 Agent and I

clerk since time the office was opened. There are no road trips.

Limited potentials

in the nearby Portuguese colony of Macao, plus hazards of travel to that colony

which is so susceptible to Chinese Communist encroachment and pressure, have

militated against official travel there by Bureau representatives. British authorities,

in approving our opening of the Hong Kong Office, were adamant that we not conduct

liaison with Taiwan from Hong Kong in view of the sensitive balance of British

relations with Red China. This factor has precluded our consideration of shifting

coverage of Taiwan (which is located about half-way between Hong Kong and Japan)

from Tokyo to Hong Kong. Major work of Legat Hong Kong involves file reviews

and liaison within the American Consulate General, which is one of the largest

consulates in the world, having more personnel assigned than our embassies in

many of the smaller countries. Of much importance also is liaison with Hong Kong

Police Headquarters and British Security Service (MI-5). Although Legat Hong

Kong was continually pressed the Bureau for assignment of additional personnel,

the existing complement should be adequate if efforts are applied by Legat with

maximum efficiency. Liaison is conducted 100% in English, which is the official

language in Hong Kong. Knowledge of Chinese is helpful in living in Hong Kong, but

is not essential.

Memo for Mr. Tolson

Re: The Legal Attache Program

SECRET

Manila: There is very little activity of interest to the Bureau in the

Philippines. Our office was located there in 1961 largely because of its central

location with respect to Southeast Asia. All liaison in the Philippines is

conducted in English, which is the official language. Spanish is virtually useless

and study of the native Tagalog, Ilokano and Pampanga dialects is impractical.

The Manila Office since its inception has had one Agent and one clerk. Because

of dearth of work in the Philippines and wide extent of the territory, the Legat has

spent a large proportion of his time "on the road," covering all of Southeast Asia,

Singapore, Kuala Lumpur, Australia and New Zealand. Much of his travel to far-

flung countries has been necessitated in the past by requirement that Legat

interview FBI National Academy candidates being sponsored by the Agency for

International Development (A ID). Case load at Manila has dropped substantially

during the past 16 months. Manila', I any Far Eastern office, should be considered

for readjustment o

of territory. The small amount of work existing in Manila itself

could be handled without difficulty by Legat Hong Kong (one hour away by airjet.

A more logical spot for coverage of Southeast Asia might be Canberra, Australia,

or Bangkok, "Thailand, both of which are more centrally located, have more

potential for expansion of FBI investigative interests and present a more healtful,

¡ secure environment for clerical employees and dependents.

Vietnam: Another area of vital importance to the United States at

this time is South Vietnam, which heretofore has been considered part of the

Manila territory. Saigon currently is the seat of one of the largest U. S. Embassies

in the world in terms of personnel assigned, with enormous U. S. Information

Service, AID, and other auxiliaries. The CIA operation in Vietnam is by far the

largest it has

in the whole world. Although we have in the past had relatively little

case work in Vietnam, unquestionably an FBI representative, if solidly accredited

to the Embassy, would be in a position to make an important contribution to the overall

effort through police liaison, and would at the same time serve as a valuable listening

post for the Director. In any expansion program it would therefore appear that

¡ Saigon should be activel y considered.

Taiwan: As noted above, the Republic of China (Taiwan) has been

covered by Legat Tokyo. British attitude makes coverage of Taiwan from our

Hong Kong Office unfeasible. An alternative to increasing Agent complement at

Tokyo from one to two would be opening a new office in Taiwan, from which the

Repüblic of Korea (South"Korea) could conveniently be handled

If this were

done, one Agent and one clerk at Taiwan would suffice. It would still be

desirable to retain two clerks in Tokyo, and with the reduction in territory the

second clerk could be made available whenever required for relief duty in other

Far Eastern offices. On analysis, however, it would appear more desirable for

the Bureau to continue to cover Taiwan and South Korea out of Tokyo, as this,

assuming complement at Tokyo can again be established at two Agents, would

insure a source of Agent relief for the other Asiatic offices, at the same time

maintaining the economy of a more consolidated operation.

Memo for Mr. Tolson

Re: The Legal Attache Program

SECRET

WESTERN HEMISPHERE

We.now have 3 offices in the Western Hemisphere: Ottawa, Canada;

Mexico City, Mexico; and Buenos Aires, Argentina.

Ottawa: Legat Ottawa has operated from the beginning with only one

Agent, but with 2 or more clerks. Following the inspection in March, 1969,

clerical complement was raised to 3 and request of Legat for 1 additional Agent

was denied.. Legat processes an enormous volume of investigative matters (484

cases pending on 3/31/69; 282 cases closed during March, 1969), 99% of which

involve liaison with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP). Although most

of the cases are stereotyped and are handled by use of form communications, the

very volume involved is greatly confining to Legat, limiting his availability for

personal liaison with the highly cooperative RCMP in matters of greater importance

to the Bureau. For this reason, serious consideration should be given when

practical to assigning a second Agent to office of Legat, Ottawa.

Mexico City: Mexico City has a complement of 12 Agents and 12 clerks

(reduced from 15 Agents and 15 clerks following the inspection in February, 1969).

The office covers Mexico and five countries of Central America (Costa Rica,

El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua). Legat operates a large number

of informant nets in Mexico to provide intensive knowledge of potentially subversive

activities along the nathern border of the United States. Criminal investigations

involving border crossings are also numerous. During the recent inspection a

redixection of effort was ordered, to concentrate more fully on activities of

direct Bureau interest and less on matters where other U. S. agencies have joint

interest and responsibility. In view of this, it would not appear that increase in

personnel at Mexico in the immediate future will be justifiable 365

Buenos Aires: The Buenos Aires Office was opened 3/31/67 coincident

with closing of the Rio de Janeiro Office: Territory includes Argentina, Uruguay

and Brazil. Staff consists of one Agent and one clerk, which was fo und to be

adequate during inspection completed 5/11/69. Work load is substantial, but

justification was not seen during the receat inspection for reopening the Rio de

Janeiro Office.

Other Latin American Countries: At present, no regular coverage is

maintained by the Bureau in Panama, Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia,

Paraguay, Chile and other South American countries. Experience has shown that

well planned, aggressive liaison does produce worthwhile results for the Bureau in

cooperative foreign areas. While disposition of some of the above countries toward

the United States has fluctuated, the necessity of maintaining a position of intelligent

defense against the inroads of communism in the Western Hemisphere is clear.

Re: The Legal Attache Program

SECRET

Data is not available to evaluate potentials of each of the countries mentioned,

but if expansion abroad becomes practical in the future a careful survey to select

one of the countries named as site of a new Legal Attache Office appears desirable. '

RECOMMENDATIONS:

1. That observations of the Domestic Intelligence Division (DID) and

Legats, Paris and Rome be obtained regarding desirability of shifting coverage

of Spain and Portugal from the Paris Office to theYRome Office. Their observations

should also be requested regarding future desirability of reopening the Madrid

Office to cover Spain, Portugal and, il necessary, nearby areas of Africa.

103.

2. That a third clerk-stenographier be assigned to London when feasible.

Esses

N:0, 529

3. That an additional Agent be assigned the Tokyo Office when feasible,

restoring complement to 2 Agents and 2 clerks.

lagree +00-5-74628

4. That DID and Legats Hong Kong and Manila be requested to furnish

re commendations regarding desirability of closing the Manila Office; having

the Philippines covered by Legat Hong Kong, and opening a new office either at Canberr

Australia, or at Bangkok, Thailand, to cover Southeast Asia.

5. That Saigon be considered for opening of a new Legat Office in any future

expansion program.

In a notation on the attached routing slip of June 8, 1971,

to the Director from Mr. Beaver, the Director asked for my views on

the subject matter -- the expansion of the FBI's Foreign Liaison personnel,

offices, and activities.

I recommend the expansion for three reasons, as follows:

The suggestion that we expand originated at the

White House, and was said there to be based on

the quality of information valuable to the President

that we have been able to provide. If it is the

judgment of the President and his Advisers that

this Bureau is able to provide unusually good in-

Лаком

formation, and that they need more of it, we

certainly are in no position to deny or disagree.

It safely can be said that the people in the White

House know better than we the value of the infor-

mation which we have provided. I will trust their

judgment.

HASPIN SENACTY

DJD:tak-tak

clđ:32989637

2 Tut seems hardly open to question that the President

of the United States needs good intormation of this

type now more than ever before. Political, economic

and social ferment abroad, all bearing on our foreign

relationships, requires more and better information.

This hemisphere alone is a good example. In the

past we have had sporadic trouble with one banana

republic or another but never before have we had

a combination of such difficulties as now are en-

countered in Cuba and Chile which have been taken

over by the Communists, and in several other

countries which are apparently on the verge of a

revolutionary change. If there is a chance that we can

help, we should try. aFt

Re: Estimated Cost of Proposed

Expansion of Foreign Liaison

My limited experience with and memory of the

Bureau's S.I.S. operations during World War Il

convinced me that we should be able to produce

superior information. I was undercover in Chile

for one year and because of that experience, I

followed the S.I.S. operation with more than usual

interest. I think the files will show that this Bureau

was greatly praised by high government officials

for its S.I.S. accomplishments. This leads me to

conclude that we can do a superior job again if need

be.

The Director asked for my views on Mr. Sullivan's 6-page

memorandum, dated 6/16/71, arguing against proposed expansion of

our Foreign Liaison and proposing elimination of most existing Legal

Attache Offices either now or within six months.

Mr. Sullivan has not set forth any information which

causes me to change my position. Three important factors must be kept

in mind: (1) The White House requested both the recent expansion

and the proposed expansion; (2) what is of value to the White House is

political, economic and social information; (3) we are not attempting to

decide the question on the basis of "hard intelligence. " The White

House is not directly interested in Fugitives located, espionage

subjects identified and cases solved, which are what I think Mr. Sullivan

is talking about.

RECOMMENDATION:

That we proceed with the proposed expansion program.

A2.a. Communist Party (CP), USA

SE 100-11889

Bureau 100-3-23

The Northern California District (NCD) of the

Communist Party (CP) is comprised of 48 counties in central

and northern California.

The westernmost of these counties

are in the San Francisco Division; the easternmost are in

the Sacramento Division. Most of the CP activity in the

NCDCP lies in the westernmost counties, there being only ten

known CP members in CP groups in the Sacramento Division.

The CP maintains an office in Rooms 410-11, 942 Market Street,

San Francisco.

• The CP continues to act as an arganization, holding

CP club, club chairmen and district meetings.

Principal activity in the CP in the NCD consisted

of financing, preparation and distribution of literature

reflecting the national CD line, especially the "peonle's

World"

, the West Coast communist newspaper published in San

Francisco, and activities relating to recruitment of new members,

for example, the formation of the local Young Workers Liberation

League•

Informants are members of most of the CP clubs in

the NCD.

Some of these informants are members of committees

of the NCDCP .

number of them are officers in the various

ce groups.

The identity of the members of the CP in the NCD

are obtained from these informants who report on activities of

old members, transfers of members, recruitment of new members

and cessation of activity on the part of others. Within a

short time after it ocars, any change in the membership is

• reported.

Since 4/1/70, as an example, the informants reported

two deaths, 19 ceasing activity, Il moving out of the district,

three on leaves of absence, two resignations, one expulsion,

four new recruits, five reactivations, and two transfers into

the district. •

It is felt that the informant coverage is adequate.

It will be noted there are 20 informants who are members of the

CP in the NCD and two informants who are not members but furnish

information primarily concerning CP activity. It will be noted

the informant ratio to membership is approximately one informant

for each 8.5 members.

The main activity of the Socialist Workers Party

(SWP) and its affiliated youth group, the Young Socialist

Alliance (YSA), since the last inspection has been working

toward the withdrawal of troops from Vietnam. In this

connection, they have been the motivating force behind massive

demonstrations in San Francisco on 11/15/69 and 4/18/70

protesting U. S. presence in Vietnam. They have also

sponsored a petition which resulted in a referendum to be

voted on in San Francisco on 11/2/70 putting San Francisco on

record as being opposed to the war. The SWe is also in the

forefront of the Women's Liberation Movement, utilizing it as

a means of attaining the appearance of their political candidates

on college campuses

to speak on the subject.

When dealing

with youth, swe activity is carried on in the name of the YSA

but as the

YSA is completely controlled by the SWP, members who

comprise a majority of the YSA membership the name utilized in

public activity is irrelevant. Funds are derived from members'

sustainers, literature sales, and outside solicitation of funds.

Although constantly in arrears in payments to the National-

Office of the SWP and the YSA, they do not appear to have any

financial crises at any time.

Informant coverage is adequate

at present but efforts will be made to develop additional

coverage to provide for continuing coverage in the event current

informants. are discontinued for any reason. New members are

identified by member informants.

The membership of the SWP

in this area is approximately 99 according to member informants.

The membership of

the YSA according to member informants is

approximately 90.

RU publications describe RU as adhering to Marxist-

Leninist-Mao Ise-tung thought and advocating necessity of

armed revolution to destroy United States imperialism and

establish dictatorship of proletariat. Members of leading

body, Political Committee, state all members armed.

At

Central Committee meeting

weekend of October 10 and 11, 1970,

15 delegates present and informant who was present estimates

75% to 80% advocated armed struggle now. RU going national

and has started collectives in Northvest chicago area.

Detroit, and in several major cities in East. Chief sources

of funds are membership dues and profit from sales of publi-

cations. Ru publishes three newspapers and has significant

control over a fourth.

Has published three issues of

theoretical journal "Red Papers."

RU concentrating on

revolutionizing of workers, college

and high school students,

looking toward formation of national Marxist-Leninist Party...

capable of seizing control of the United States.

RU active

in strikes around the Bay Area, college demonstrations, and

in community affairs, tenants unions, welfare,

and education.

Increased emphasis being placed on weapons training and

affinity groups being organized for action in demonstrations.

RU members are identified mainly through live

informant coverage; fisurs and, where possible, photo

coverage of known RU meetings.

Additional names of RU

membership is self-identification in RU newspapers, and

Estimate of

member intormant by RU Chairman in 9/70. Rapid membership

increase attributed to heavy emphasis on recruiting during

past year, less insistence on ideological purity in

recruitment and increased recruit potential caused by

breakup of SDS. While present informant coverage

considered adequate on overall RU activity, it is felt

member informant coverage should be increased on area

basis to identify individual members so they may be placed

on SI.

The BAPLP is not holding as

many public forums and open meetings as it has in the past.

The BAPLP is active in the Students for a Democratic Society

(SDS) at the University of California at Berkeley, San Francisco

State College in San Francisco, and Merritt College, Oakland,

California.

The BAPLP has a number of SDS sympathizers who

have aligned themselves with the PLP line and become BAPLP

candidate members.

The PLP is concentrating its main efforts

on student activities. This is the area where they hope to

recruit new members.

The BAPLP membership is estimated to be

between 45 and 50.

There has been no significant change in

membership since the last inspection. Some members have moved

out of the area and several have quit the Party.

The Party is

hopeful of gaining new members primarily from radicals on campus

and is having some success. Efforts are being made to secure

additional member informant coverage in the BAPLP. BAPLP

membership is determined through confidential informants.

The San Francisco chapter of the National Lawyers

Guild (NLG) operates

a legal referral service and its members

have provided legal defense for Communist Party members as

well

as anti-draft and racial matters and are presently taking

a participatory interest in the Soledad Brothers by providing

counsel for imprisoned felons. Tunds are derived from

membership dues •

The Northern California Committee For Protection of

the Foreign Born is in effect dormant, has only $30 in its

bank account and holds no meetings or functions. Unless an

innigration proceeding or legislation dealing with immigration

policy arises, the organization will remain dormant. Funds are

no longer being solicited.

Northern Californians Against Repressive Legislation

(NCARL), formerly known as the Northern Californians to Abolish

the House Internal Security Committee, changed its name to

broaden the scope of its activity.

dissemination of literature attacking specific legislation.

Meetings are held primarily to solicit help in mailings and to

discuss progress in influencing citizens and members of Congress.

Funds are derived from public donations solicited in mailings.

The

American-Russian Institute (ARI) exists mainly

• as a distribution center for the dissemination of soviet

propaganda throughout Northern California and as a contact point

for Soviet exchange students, visiting Communist dignitaries, and

other visitors from behind the Iron Curtain.

Funds are raised

by monthly contributions and a large fund raising dinner held

annually on the anniversary of the Russian revolution.

The "People's World" (PW) newspaper has two or three

fund-raising affairs yearly and numerous small meetings such as

breakfasts for fund-raising purposes. Its annual fund drive and

subscription drive quotas are usually met.

The Guardian has not held any public meetings during

the last year. In April, 1970, Guardian workers in New York

revolted against Guardian policy and began publishing a

"Liberated Guardian". The Guardian no longer has a representative

in the San Francisco

area whereas the "Liberated Guardian" lists

approximately seven individuals on its Bay Area staff but has

held no meetings of a public nature.

2. Organizations:

The last Inspection coincided with the famous Students

for a Democratic Society

(SDS) June 1969 Chicago Convention

in which the

then SDS leadership attempted to expell the

followers of Progressive Labor Party (PL).

PL controlled the

major local campus SDS chapters at the University of

California, Berkeley, and San Francisco State, Anti-PL chapters

of SDS existed for a

few months at Stanford University and

San Jose State College, but as SDS became less massive as an

organization controlled by PL these members drifted into groups

such as the Revolutionary Union (RU) •

Lack of communication

and organization, as well as a National SDS debt, constant

appeals

for funds, and continued ridicule by RU

and Weatherman

groups have all contributed to further dictatagration of sos.

Demands indigenous to the Student Movement have been ignored

to concentrate

on PL's program of "Build a Worker-Student

Alliance" (#SA).

At a western regional conference held at

Berkeley, California, September 26, 1970, SDS attempted to

rerorganize with delegates from throughout the West.

Some

criticism of PL was voiced but Pli continued to dominate,

calling for a demonstration at San Jose, California, November 3,

1970, In support of striking auto workers.

SDS/WSA

distributes,

funds available to print it, "New Left Notes"

at Boston but note regularly distributes "Challenge" published

• publication

SDS/WSA Western Regional Conference was only

able to

raise $150 toward $5,000 National Office debt.

The Bay Area Peace Action Council (BAPAC) is a

coalftion of various anti-war groups in the San Francisco area

whose sole purpose is the immediatewithdrawal of all U. s.

troops from Southeast Asia,

BAPAC is not a membership

srganization, however, the Socialist Workers Party (SWP) 15 a

controlling force behind it, simply because numerous SWe

members attend BAPAC meetings regularly. Funds are derived

from public solicitations

The Student Mobilization Committee (SMC) 1s a

national organization of high school and college students

whose basic aims are the immediate and unconditional with

drawal of all U. So troops from South Vietnam, abolition of the

draft, self-determination for Vietnam and Black America, and

Constitutional rights for GI's and high school students.

The majority of the individuals functioning in a leadership

capacity in the SMC are members of the Young Socialist

Alliance (YSA) and SWP.

Funds derived from sale of buttons

at demonstrations

public donations and support from YSA and

SWP.

The Venceremos Brigade (VB) of the San Francisco Bay

Area is affiliated with the national organization headquartered

at New York, New York, and is principally active in the

recruitment of individuals for the VB sponsored contingents

to Cuba.

There are no local independent publications of the

Confidential

funding and finances.

There are no key activists directly

affiliated with the VB.

The Newsreel in San Francisco was established in

May, 1968, as & branch of the New York Newsreel, a radical

film-making group.

Articles of Incorporation.

pursuant to

non-profitcorporations under the laws of the State of

California, number 58415, were filed in the Office of Secretary

of State, California, November 5, 1969. The Newsreel makes

and distributes films that depict ideas and information that

the Government and the news media tend to choose to ignore.

In the spring of 1970, the Newsreel began work on two new

films, one on the history of labor and the other on the

history of the women's liberation struggle. Persons who have

had

some activity in the SDS and related

groups in other

parts of the United States have been some of the leaders of

the Newsreel in San Francisco.

The White Panther Party (WPP) in Berkeley is a

small group which seems to center its activities around

There are no Key Activists in the Berkeley

group.

Recently, the WPP have been "hangers on" at the office

(1) Of an estimated several thousand communes in

Northern California, only a

small percentage of these may be

classiflea as political collectives organized for the purpose

of revolutionary violence.

The difficulty lies in identifying

these political collectives with the scant cooperation received

by the

FBI and local police agencies from the alienated youth

sub-cuiture which engages in ihis commurai living.

Extended coverage has been given to those addresses

wherein the residents have been identified as members of the

Weatherman faction of Students For A Democratic Society (SDS)

for the purpose of identlying members and locating fugitives.

Addresses which turn up in leads from other offices are given

short term coverage for the purpose of locating fugitives and

evaluating the nature of the commune.

coverage over a period of several months because they are considere

to be political collectives are as follows:

1970 campus demonstrations

During May, 1970, the final series of the sharkeley

occurred on the campuses at

and Stanfora.

June and July, 1970 brought a number of bombings

and attempted bombings against off-campus institutions of the

establishment. It appears that several groups other than Weatherman

participated in these bombings as Weatherman communication was only

received regarding the bombing of the Hall of Justice in Oakland,

California, on July 30, 1970.

The months of August and September, 1970, were unusually

quiet with no demonstrations or bombings. It was not until the

fall offensive announced by BERNARDINE DOHRN, in the fifth communi-

cation from the Weatherman

Underground on October 6, 1970, that a

new series of bombings began.

The October 7, 1970 bombing of the San Rafael Courthouse

was claimed by the Weatherman and it appears that the other attemptec

bombings and bomb threats came from terroristic groups which respon-

• dod to Wetherman's call for a fall offensive.

In response to Bureau teltype, dated April 17, 1970,

the san Francisco Division advised by teletype dated April 20,

1970, that an additional 28 Agents would be needed with an addi-

tional sven Agents for servicing of sophisticated coverage to

implement the intensified investigation against New Left violence.

In our teletype of April 20, 1970, it was indicated that the peak

number expected to be assigned to these investigations was 46.

As of June 15, 1970, a New Left Violence Squad was set

up in this office consisting of 24 Agents, broken down as to 17

Headquarters Agents and seven Resident Agents, of whom four were

exclusively assigned to the handling of New Left extremist matters.

One

additional Agent is on transfer to

the New Left Violence Squad

for a total of 25.

Based on current available manpower and the present

investigative demands on this office, it is believed that the Bureau

program of intensification against the New Left has been implementes

up to this time.

However, in view of the new Bureau jurisdiction of

arson and bombing matters

and the tremendous number of individuals in

the San Francisco Bay Area who have accepted the hippie culture and

way of life among whom are the New Left extremists and fugitives,.

task of locating, identifying, and apprehending these

individuals thus poses an extremely difficult challenge.

By airtel, dated September 30; 1970, the San Francisco

Division has asked for an additional 26

Agents.

Of this number

five will be assigned to the New Left Violence Squad, five will

be assigned to the squad hadling the Venceremos Brigade, six will

ESPIONAGE AND RELATED MATTERS

1.

Espionage and related matters are handled on Squad 8,

which

and 4 resident agents.

In addition to Espionage and Internal Security responsi-

bilities dealing with the soviets, chinese and the satellites,

this squad also

handles various nationality groups, such as

the Arabs, Iranians and Yugoslavs, and also handles the investi-

gation of the Revolutionary Union

(RU), which is the largest

Maoist-Marxist-Leninist organization in the Bay area openly

espousing the overthrow of this government by force and violence

and which is discussed elsewhere in detail.

This squad also

handles Mexican-American matters which

are

in their relative

infancy but appear to be trying to follow the path of the

blacks in their efforts to obtain more recognition for their

- problems:

The foremost tasks presently facing this squad in

their order of importance are:

(1)

Coverage of the Soviet Consulate, which is in

the process of being established;

(2) Coverage of the RU;

(3) Coverage of the Chinese, which has taken a new

turn subsequent to the Chinese government policy now of going

international and its recognition by Canada and the contemplated

establishment of a Chinese Communist Consulate in Vancouver;

(4) Coverage of Mexican-Americans;

(5) Coverage of soviet students (there are 7 in the

Bay area) ;

(6) Coverage of nationality groups, such as the Arabs,

Iranians, Yugoslavs, Cubans and South Americans, and

(7) Fisur coverage of other Soviet Intelligence

officials visiting this area, handling cases from other offices

and satellite programs and illegal agent programs.

With respect to the Inspector's comment on priorities,

I would like to suggest that serious consideration be given to

setting out priorities on situations before the fact rather than

waiting until the pioblems have become so serious.

Specifically

it is believed that the following serious and important matters

NW-65360-Đoeld:92989094-2age-196

## Page 197

4-F-G

now basically in their infancy in San Francisco should receive

greater emphasis in determining the present overall Bureau

priorities.

(1) The Soviet Consulate.

Four officials have now

arrived, including the Consul General Designate and the Vice

and have obtained house-keeping apartments.

All indications are they are here to stay, to be augmented to

20 - 30 families when they locate their space.

four officials are known KGB and this fact should certainly

be meaningful to us.

history have our students, scientists and men in the Armed

FOrceS

let their moral standards deteriorate to such a low

degree. Certainly the Soviets will capitalize on this

deterioration.

In addition, the San Francisco Peninsula

area is one of the most important centers of electronic and

scientific escarch in the minited States.

(2)

Coverage of Chinese Espionage.

Within the past

week Canada

has recognized Communist China and information

indicates that a Chinese Communist Consulate will be opened in

Vancouver. Already we have seen contacts between pro-Chinese

Communist elements in San Francisco and New China News Agency

personnel in Vancouver.

This, coupled with the recent indi-

• cation that Communist China is now ready to come out of its

shell and now concentrate on improving its international position,

will cause greatly increased activity in the Chinese field in

this area.

(3)

The Revolutionary Union (RU), which was only

founded in 1968, has grown from 1969 to 1970 from 120 to 350

members, according to estimates given by its Chairman in 9/70.

The development.Ofthe RU had closely-paralleled recent

past six months has assumed a national posture with development

of collectives in the mid-west and East. At the Central

Committee meeting within the past week,

70 to 80% of the

delegates favored armed revolutionary struggle now.

(4) Mexican-Americans. This field is in its infancy

but could prove serious inasmuch as revolutionary organizations,

such as the white radicals, are making determined efforts to

revolutionize and

recruit within the Spanish-American community.

As of the present, the most important local group

IS LOS SIDLE DE LA RAZA (The Seven of the Race), aka (SE file

100-63425) • This group was established in May, 1969, for

the purpose of obtaining adequate legal counsel for

the seven

Latinos charged with killing

' a San Francisco Police Officer

on 5/1/69.

The group was quickly taken over by militant,

radical Latinos who have guided it into more radical and

militant channels, with close ties to such groups as the

Black Panther Party, Revolutionary Union, Youth International

Party, etc.

"BASTA YA," and has expanded

its activities into such "community-oriented" work as a "People's

Clinic" and "children's breakfasts."

The second most important local group is the VENCEREMOS

COLLEGE (SE file 100-65241), located in Redwood City, California.

This is part of the NAIROBI College of East Palo Alto,

established in 1969, following the confrontation of Third

World students with

the College of San Mateo. AARON MANGANIELIO,

Director of VENCEREMOS COLLEGE, was expelled from San Mateo

College as a result of this confrontation.

This college is primarily for young chicano students,

and its stated goal is to produce

"revolutionary technologists-

doctors, lawyers, teachers."

It is a two-year college, and

claims to be accredited.

are Marxist-Leninist, and the class stressed is the political

education class in Marxism-Leninism.

Chinese Matters

Although the ethnic breakdown of the 1970 census is

not yet available, it is estimated by the San Francisco Public

Health Department, that persons of Chinese descent constitute

approximately one-tenth of the population of the city. This

percentage has risen constantly during the past two decades

and is expected to rise at an increasing rate in view of

liberalized immigration regulations and the tendency of certain

other groups to move out of the core city. The estimate of

approximately 70,000 Chinese residing in San Francisco is

matched by an equal number in other Bay area cities, making

the total Chinese

population of the San Francisco Bay Area

sómewhere between 140,000 and 150,000 persons.

The report of the San Francisco Chinese Community

Citizen's Survey and

Fact Finding Committee, issued in 11/69,

points out that the San Francisco Chinatown

is not simply an

area but in fact, "a City within a City," with "its businesses

and commercial district, light manufacturing and industrial

areas, schools, churches and parks and its different housing

both public and private."

The fact that Chinese are

area idely dispersued throughout the city, Chinatown remains

crowded, with a population density about ten times that of

the city as a whole.

Although more

and more Chinese are taking

up residence elsewhere in San

Francisco, and in nearby cities,

most still retain Chinatown ties and many commute daily to

their businesses or offices in Chinatown.. All of these

considerations affect the investigation of Chinese matters

and it has been found that the development of Nationality

Sources and the promotion of community relations is particularly

effective in the expeditious handling of Chinese investigations.

The San Francisco Office has sources in all of the

important organizations and groups in the San Francisco China-

town.

Nationality Sources of this office serve on the board

of the Chinese Consolidated Benevolent Association, commonly

called the Chinese Six Companies, which is made up of the

Presidents of the seven major Chinese District Associations,

(associations of persons who trace ancestry to one or another

or the districts near Canton, China). At present both

officials directing the Anti-communist Committee, of the Six

Companies are established sources, one

being STEVE M. JEONG™

and the other being FOQ HUM. This office also has sources

in each of the

fifteen major Chinese Family Associations on

an officet level, and has officer sources, in four of the five

major tongs, the Bing Kung long the Ving On Tong-the Hop

is also a source of this office.

This office has officer-

level sources in the Cathay Post of the American Legion, and

the Chinatown Post of the Veterans of Foreign Wars.

Perhaps the most important invesigation in the Chinese

field at present is that entitled "Chinese Voice," IS-CH, which

appears to be shaping up as a major propaganda effort of

Chicoms. This investigation, discussed in more detail elsewhere

in this write-up, is expected to become more time-consuming, as

It appears that the

he editor tonG will be successiud

in securing Chicom

Ilnancial support

to make the paper into a

daily publication.

Recently ONG, accompanied by several other

Chinese from this area, traveled

to Vancouver, Canada, to

welcome the crew of a Chicom ship and ONG made a banquet speech

in which he clearly disclosed Chicom sympathies.

The individual

investigation of ONG is discussed elsewhere in this write-up,

as "JOHN S.C.ONG, IS-CH.". Another important case, is that

entitled "BEATRICE;_IS-CH."

Two organizations at San Francisco that are considered

pro-Chicom are the Hai Yen She (M), commonly known as the

Petrel Club (Bufile 105-13332; SF File 105-869) , and the Red

Guard (Bufile 105-189989; SF File 105-23956) •

The Hai Yen She (M) is the descendant organization

of the Chinese-American Democratic Youth League which in the

1950's had a fairly extensive membership and was actively pro-

Chicom. At present the organization is "officially" disbanded,

but it remains an informal group of Chinese who are pro-Chicom

in sympathy and who hold weekly discussion meetings attended

by approximately ten persons. _SE 2311-Sisa member Of this

group It is also noted that individuals who are associated

with JOHN_S CONG, and the "Chinese Voice" include persons

who were formerly quite active in the Hai Yen She or its

predecessor organization. MAURICE CHUCK, (Bufile 105-19681;

SF File 105-1493), who was once Educational Director of the

Chinese-American Democratic Youth Club, is now the Managing

Editor of the "Chinese Voice."

The Red Guard grew rapidly in 1969, by absorbing

Chinatown youth gang elements.

The Asian American Political Alliance, which only a

University of California at Berkeley, California, is now a

dead issue due to dissension in the Asian Studies Division

Although there has been no evidence of anti-communist

group activity which could be considered embarrassing to our

government, there does exist a potential among the Arao

students, Iranian students, and

"the Yugoslav emigre groups.

Pro-Arab activity offering potential for illegal

activity and violence centers in Arab students on the several

Bay area campuses.

Their primary interest at present is to

support the Palestinian Arab cause. Demonstrations along

The Iranian Student Association has chapters in the

major colleges in the San Francisco Bay area. It advocates

the overthrow of the government of the shah of Iran. It is

also critical of U.S.

with the United States, and it supports the Palestinian Arabs.

There has been no acts of violence perpetrated by

6. Deseco Program

San Francisco is aware that the West Coast is of

increasing interest to the SIS, and the anticipated opening

of the soviei Consulaie has emphasizeu the need for the develop-

ment of an adequate pool of sources, informants and double

agents which will assist in our efforts to effectively cover

the intelligence activities of the soviets.

To further implement the instructions of the Bureau

who plan travel to or through Sino-Soviet bloc countries or

who plan to attend an international meeting outside the U.S.

where Sino-Soviet-bloc personnel may be present.

These persons,

on a selective basis, are interviewed to alert them to the

possibility of foreign intelligence recruitment, and their

DESECO potential is then evaluated.

Other sources which have been contacted in an effort

to locate suitable individuals for development within this

program include security officers oI major Inaustrial IlIm

Counterintelligence Against Communist Party USA:

No occasion has arisen where it was felt that

any counterintelligence action action would

heighten existing tensions or create

disruption, so no

authority for counterintelligence

action was

requested of the Bureau,

B. Counterintelligence Against New Left:

The continued fragmentation of New Left Groups

aná

the

criticism of one group by che oiner

has narrowed opportunities under this program.

SDS/WSA local campus

chapters are constantly

labeled "PL stooges" by other campus groups.

The attendance of such large student groups as

World Christian Liberation Front (WCLF) at

Regional Convention of SDS to preach the

Gospel was more disruptive than any program

we could suggest to Bureau. The WCLF delayed

the West Coast SDS Convention one half day

until the SDS removed the WCLE and its student

members to the outside, where they continued

to pray for forgiveness of the SDS and to SDS

to refund their registration fee.

As a

combined result of University and local

prosecution virtually the entire leadership

of such groups as Berkeley SDS and Campus

Progressive Labor Party are currently under

suspension and many have felony indictments

pending

against them. Our prompt notification

of such agencies as

INS and request for regular

notification of action

taken by them in case

of

Foreign disrupters has resulted not

necessarily in statistics under this program

but results in keeping with spirit of program.

While suggestions made under this program

tangible results are not evident because

with the disruption carried on by one group

against another greatest care must be

exercised to prevent involvement that could

result in criticism of Bureau.

Office clearly indicates that the need for an

imaginative,

aggressive, well organized program to obtain "member informants"

in all known extremist groups, collectives, and basic revolu-

tionary organizations in order

that your office will be in a

position to fulfill the Bureau's responsibility in this field;

the re-establishment of a Soviet Consulate in San Francisco

creates

a most serious investigative responsibility to your

office; daily coverage will be expected of all phases of

activities which again emphasizes the need of all types

of coverage; the Revolutionary Union (RU) (comprising an

estimated 350 members in 41 collectives of which only 145 have

groups of this type.

Continuous terroristic violence encouraged by fanatics

and revolutionary groups, organized and unorganized, squarely

affixes San Francisco's responsibilities in the security field.

The foremost objective in the security field must be

"member informant" coverage to identify and infiltrate all

revolutionary and extremist

groups with the

and/or complete extinction of these groups.

goal of prosecution

Quality "member"

informant coverage in leadership position (in violence-oriented

groups on andoff campuses) is a prime and critical factor that

must be kept uppermost in the mind of responsible supervisory

and investigative personnel through sound administrative and

investigative programs on a day-to-day basis.

Simply stated, "the name of the game is 'member

• informant

culture with emphasis on the use of drugs, communal living,

The above clearly points

out the critical need for

in-depth member informant coverage in all of the above areas

set forth.

In this regard, you should promptly make a thoroug!

analysis

of your security informant program, insuring that a1

weaknesses therein

are promptly corrected in order that optimum

informant coverage is obtained from available informants in order

that necessary informant coverage is obtained at the earliest

possible date.

BASIC REVOLUTIONARY GROUPS

COMMUNIST PARTY, USA

As reported by you to answers posed by the inspectors,

the activities of the Communist Party (CP) in the San Francisco

Division appear to be adequately covered by member informants;

however, you should insure not to lose sight of the fact that

coverage

can fluctuate daily.

You should insure that informant

development in this organization is not relaxed in order that

you will always have adequate coverage.

A review of files relative

to New Left organizations and individuals reflects that your inves-

tigations in this area are conforming with existing Bureau instruc-

tions.

The one problem area indicated in the New Left extremist

type organization is the Revolutionary Union (RU).

Accordingy.

an

in-depth analysis was made of the problems involving this organiza-

• tion which is set forth as follows:

REVOLUTIONARY UNION

The RU has had an alarming membership growth from fifty

members at the time of the last inspection to 350 members at

present. The growth of the RU has closely paralleled recent

directives from Communist China for a Marxist-Leninist organiza-

tion outside of China.

During the past six months, the RU has

assumed a national posture with the development of collectives

in the Midwest and East:

At the Central Committee meeting

(governing body) held within the past week, 70 per cent to 80

per cent of the delegates favored armed revolutionary struggle now.

The RU in your territory is presently made up of 350

members in 41 collectives which are located in San Francisco and

seven Resident Agencies: Berkeley, Oakland, Palo Alto, Richmond,

San Jose, San Mateo, and Santa Cruz.

the prime reason why this unfavorable situation

attempt to have them

gain membership.

Of the 145

* members identified, a total of 13 have been

included in the Security Index. The investigations concerning the

other

12, known members should be expedited and appropriate reports

submitted to the Bureau together with recommendations for placing

these individuals on the Security Index.

As you are aware, the Department

of Justice advised on

May 19, 1970, that it was considering submission of a petition

to the Subversive Activities Control Board

• to designate

the RU a

Communist front. Because of the Department's interest in the RU,

you should keep the Bureau advised of all pertinent information and

activities of this organization.through timely letterhead memoranda

and/or appropriate reports suitable for dissemination.

The extent of extremist activities such

as those

adhered to by the Revolutionary Union and the Weatherman

Faction of the Students for a

• Democratic Society is further

emphasized by the statements of MARK RUDD! Leader of Weatherman,

to the extent that in 2/70, a meetingwas held in Clevelana,

Ohio, at which time weatherman decided to go

undergrouna

and direct "strategic sabotage" not so much at Federal Buildings

but at military ana police institutions.

One of the centers

of Weatherman

activity

was designated as

Berkeley, California.

Therefore, you should insure that aggressive and penetrative

investigation is directed in this area not only to identify

known Weatherman members but to locate and apprehend Weatherman

fugitives.

In regard to RUDD's statement as to strategic sabotage,

the above stated acts of Violence indicates that Weatherman

in this area may be responsible for such acts, it being noted

that RUDD did not indicate any specific target other than the

sabotage was to be directed against symbols of the establishment

and particularly through confrontation with police and

accomplishing accompanying acts of sabotage through the use of

bombs and other

explosives.

In this regard, your attention is

directed to SAC letter 70-46 (F) dated September 1, 1970, cap-

tioned "New Left Movement-Violence-Internal Security-Miscellaneous

(Weatherman) which relates that recent developed intelligence

information unquestionably indicates the FBI, its field offices

and its Resident Agencies throughout the country are vulnerable

to the terroristic tactics of these madmen.. No office can

consider itself immune to such action; accordingly, you should

be constantly alert for same.

The foregoing emphasizes the importance of penetrative

aggressive investigation and the development of "member

informants" in

i these organizations.

It is further emphasized

by the activities of extremists throughout the U. S. who, during

the past academic year, were involved in excess of 1,785

demonstrations on college campuses:

During these demonstrations

over 7,116 individuals were arrested and damage to campus

facilities amounted to more than $9,563,000.

Approximately

300 police officers and 163 participants were injured during

these incidents.

Recently at the University of Wisconsin at

Madison, Wisconsin, a bombing caused one death and $3,000,000

damage to a building on the campus. During the period of

NW-65360-Dog|d-32989637 Page 231

## Page 232

- 11 =

September, 1969 to August, 1970, there were 151 instances

of bombing

and/or arson.

Damages as result of these instances

amounted to more than $11,454,500. This compared to the 65

acts of violence, 503 arrests, 103 police officers injurea,

11 deaths and estimated damages of $961,443 in the San

Francisco Division clearly crystalizes the problem that your

office faces in combating these

new left extremist groups.

You must insure that the Bureau's responsibilities in this

regard are fulfilled.

Stockpiling of Arms

and Ammunition

Your attention is directed to SAC letter 70-18 (C)

captioned "New Left and Black Extremist Terrorism-Bombing

Matters" dated 4/7/70, and the provisions of Senate Bill 30

relating to explosive incendiary devices and bomb threats.

The files of the San Francisco Office in: regard to

the stockpiling of arms and ammunition by extremists indicates

a neea for a definite program set up by your office to insure

that you are aware of the theits of weapons anà other insiu-

ments

of violence with emphasis being placed on identifying

whether or not such weapons of violence are falling into the

hands of extremist groups.

In connection with the reported thefts of weapons

of violence you should insure that all informants (both

security and criminal)

are promptly alerted regarding such

'thefts to aid in determining if any of these weapons of

violence are being sought after or stolen by extremists.

Counter-Intelligence Programs

A review of the San Francisco files in regard.

to the Counter-Intelligence Program of your office reflects

that serious imaginative and aggressive thinking has been

directed in this area with particular emphasis against

racial and Weatherman extremist groups.

An effective Counter-Intelligence Program against

basic revolutionary groups is a prime aspect in neutralizing

the potential of these groups.

Accordingly, you should insure

that this program continues to receive your close supervision

and direction in order that counter-intelligence can be

implemented where it will be most effective.

One such area

would be in directing your attention to violations of laws

under the Bureau's jurisdiction wherein the members are reported

to be connected with extremist groups. In this regard, your

attention is directed to the Selective Service Survey

(being

reported elsewhere in this inspection writeup) wherein it

is pointea out thai nine individuals were reprted to be

affiliated with extremist groups haing violated the Selective

Service Act. In this regard, you should insure necessary •

administrative controls are set up so such indicated violations

are promptly brought to the attention of the responsible

supervisory personnel.

Security Index

A review of the overall operation of the security.

Index was made and it was determined that it is being maintained

in a current status in accordance with Bureau instructions.

It is noted that you do not have photographs for four Security

You should make every effort

to immediately obtain current photographs on those Security

ESPIONAGE AND RELATED MATTERS

With the signing of the Consular Convention Agree-

ment between the United States and the Soviet Union, June 1

1964, negotiations have been conducted concerning the establish-

ment of Consulate Offices.

In April, 1970, negotiations

established authority for

• the Soviet Union

to open a Consular

Office in San Francisco which will cover the states of Oregon,

Washington, California, and Hawaii, plus Kodiak Island and the

cities of Juneau and Anchorage, Alaska.

As you are aware, the Soviet Union previously had a

Consulate in San Francisco

this consulate were extremely active peespionage activaties

up to the time of its closing in 1948. With the establish-

ment of a Soviet Consulate in the State of California, a state

with a large ethnic Russian population, the largest Communist

Party other than New York, and rife with extremist groups of

both the New Left anü Black Nationalist type, it is obvious

the Soviets are presented with unlimited potential for

successful espionage operations.

The area to be covered by

the San

Francisco Consulate is one in which are located many

key facilities and vital military installations, including

the Defense Language Institute, Monterey, California.

During the negotiations for the establishment of

this Consulate, it was contemplated that eight to ten Soviets

would staff this establishment.

It now appears the Soviets

contemplate assigning about thirty families to this Consulate.

• At present two Soviet officials have already arrived in San

Francisco area.

These individuals have previously served in

the United States and were connected with Soviet Intelligence.

The Soviets are presently in the process of establishing the

the prove evide inter gondo.

Consulate and are seeking to purchase a building and other

equipment

and supplies.

They are presently being assisted

by two Soviets assigned to the Soviet Embassy, Washington,

D.C.

On 10/27/70, an

'additional Soviet arrived in San

Francisco, presumably to assist the above-mentioned Soviets.

At least three of these soviets are known KGB agents.

The need for daily and thorough investigative

coverage and close supervision of the above-mentioned soviets

and those who will follow is absolutely necessary and

expectea.

investigative responsibility in covering all phases of

Soviet activities in San Francisco henceforth cannot be over-

emphasized.

You must personally IoLlow all pertinent develop

ments in this matter on a daily basis. It will be your

responsibility to appropriately apprise offices covering the

territory of the Consulate relative to their travel to those

areas, such as Los Angeles, Sacramento, San Diego, Portland,

Seattle, Anchorage and Honolulu Offices.

of the Soviets assigned to your Consulate is without question

as important as any investigative responsibilities you have.

The Bureau expects you to fulfill all phases of these

responsibilities in a thorough and exhaustive manner.

To date the actual purchase of a building which will

house the Consulate and anticipated living quarters for the

Soviats has not been madle.

Possibility exists that after

this purchase is made renovations to the building may be

necessary to fulfill the overall needs of the Soviets.

If

this possibility becomes a reality, the lapse of time in

completing such renovation may delay the arrival of the full

complement of Soviet personnel.

The San Francisco Office has been aware of the

possibility of a Soviet Consulate being established in San

Francisco for several years.

The Bureau has given you

numerous instructions in this regard.

In September, 1969,

Bureau instructed San Francisco to immediately institute

a vigorous campaign to develop a pool of suitable DESECO

sources for use against Soviet personnel.

At the present time you have three. Psi-DEsEco, two

of whom have been placed in contact with Soviet-bloc officials.

In addition, since the last inspection you have opened 108

DESECO cases, closed 50 of them, and you presently have 58

pending cases. This is a distinct and worthy improvement

over the last inspection when you had 19 pending DESECO

In addition to the above DESECO potential, you have

three

134-4408 and ST 3365-5 134-4875

who may eventually prove

valuable to San Francisco in its coverage of the Soviet

Consulate. Agents handling these informants should remain

alert for

the appropriate opportunity in placing these

individuals in contact with the Soviets.

It is essential that you vigorously pursue an active

DESECO Program and insure that individuals are being developed

whose background would make them attractive to Soviet

necessary•

Confidential Source Coverage

At the time of the last inspection you had seventeen

Confidential Söurces furnishing

with the opening of the Consulate and the arrival

of soviet personnel in your division, it is most essential

that consideration be given and efforts be extended to not

only evaluate individuals for potential defection but to

actively work toward inducing a defection in place recognizing

that such a source has proven to be the most productive

and positive means of penetrating Soviet Intelligence.

It should be expected that there will be an increase

of Soviet Intelligence official and non-official travelers

from New York, Washington, D.C. and abroad to the San Francisco

area.

It, therefore, would appear mandatory that increased

attention

and

l coverage be given to such individuals.

In addition the opening of a Soviet Consulate in

San Francisco undoubtedly will stimulate the increase of

Soviet Intelligence effotts in the area of your division,

boch in the legal and illeyat inielligence fiela.

This

fact will certainly necessitate

the need for alertness on

your part to uncover this activity.

You must give consid-

eration to means to uncover such efforts by Soviet Intelli-

gence and be certain personnel working on Soviet cases are

experienced and qualified.

Sufficient manpower and attention

must be given to all facets of these endeavors.

With the establishment of the Consulate and

considering

numerous private and governmental plants of a technical and

sensitive nature, it is imperative that the contacts of the

Consulate and its Soviet personnel be immediately identified

Surveillances of the Soviet personnel must be

vigirously conducted and consideration given to new sophis

ticated means to determine the movements and contacts of

these Soviets.

The Mast monitoring survey suggested by your

office and now being conducted should receive continuous

attention and implemented if feasible.

At the present time you have seven Soviet students

attending universities located in your territory. Your

coverage of these students is through various sources, and

event they are contacted by individuals or groups which may

be of interest to your office.

As you are aware, within the past week the Canadian

government has recognized Communist China and information

developed indicates that a Chinese Communist Consulate may

be opened in Vancouver, Canada, in the impending future.

This

Consulate will certainly produce an increase in "contact

cases." It can be expected that many Chinese of the Chinese

Community in the San Francisco area will undoubtedly contact

that Consulate.

The Chinese Communist government will

undoubtedly be vitally interested in developing sources

among the

Chinese population in the San Francisco territory.

San Francisco has seen contacts between pro-Chinese Communist

elements in San Francisco and the New China News Agency

personnel in Vancouver.

This, coupled with the recent indi

cation that Communist China is now ready to come at of its

shell and concentrate on improving its international position,

will undoubtedly greatly increase activity in the Chinese

improve de vite he

field in San Francisco territory. The need for developing

DESECO sources and quality Chinese confidential sources is

necessary and desirable if you are to fulfill your responsi-

bilities in this potentially critical investigative area.

Your investigation concerning the "Chinese Voice,"

a Chinese-language newspaper, clearly shows that this paper

is developing into a potential major propaganda effort of the

Chinese Communists.

Your investigation in this regard appears

to be progressing satisfactorily.

SECURITY INFORMANT PROGRAM

The Bureau has repeatedly stressed

and the above

analysis emphatically points out the necessity of establishing

in-depth, quality informants in the racial and security field.

This fact is even more imperative now than ever before in view

of the present conditions throughout the United states,

particularly involving extremists as the upsurge of violence

is rapidly increasing.

The files of your sis and Psis have been reviewed

and Individual ratings have been prepared and made available

to you concerning each file. The ratings given the informants

are as follows:

The abova informant that was rated fair is San

Francisco file number 134-971, Bureau file number 134-4238.

This informant should be closely followed by you for 90

days. Specific assignments should be given the informant

during this

period.

However, at the end of 90 days if no

positive improvement is shown the file should be closed.

The Bureau should be advised of the action taken as to this

the 90 day period.

In addition to the above a representative number of

the files relating to lot potential security informants under

development (non-Bureau approved) were reviewed. From the

ratings given the above SIs and PSIs (considering 23, SIs

are reporting on the Communist Party)clearly indicates this

program needs revitalization within your division to fullfill

the needs of coverage on the extremist groups. Primary

weaknesses noted were made subject of separate memoranda relating

to failure to "contact informants" and the destruction of

channelizing memoranda.

found elsewhere in this inspection report.

Another weakness

noted in a review of these files was that informants did not

appear to be given sufficient, definite and varied assignments

in order to utilize and develop their full potential.

It is

felt that through close

guidance and direction of informants

currently avallable to you, you will greatly increase badly

needed

coverage in critical areas.

You should insure that imaginative and aggressive

steps

are.immediately taken in order that the San Francisco

Division has sufficient informant coverage in the security

field to meet and fulfill the Bureau's responsibilities

in this area.

You are reminded that in developing informants,

ofttimes monetary remuneration is a prime factor, coupled

with

the need of a proper rapportbetween the agent and

the informant to fully develop the potential of the informant.

In regard to the expenditure of funds for security

informants and sources the San Francisco Division for the

period September 1968 50 August 1969 expended $80 23 45

for informants and $311.00 for sources, while during the

period September 1969 through August 1970 it expended

$76,789.62 for informants and $1,505 for sources. While

you should insure that value is received for funds expended,

!'

In addition, it should be impressed upon all agents

of the San Francisco

Division that each has a responsibility

of pinpointing security informant potentials for further

development by agents handling security matters.

In connection with the overall administrative

handling of the informant files of your division, in

addition to the weaknesses pointed out in the memoranda

referred to above, it was noted that the "pink sheet" in

several of these informant files were not completed.

" and the completion of

at an early date.

OBSERVATIONS

From an overall analysis of the security matters

in the San Francisco Division, it appears a prime factor

for a successful operation in

this area is the close

coordination of the three security squads along with the

racial squad in view of the scope of the problem dealing

with extremists in this area.

This is necessary to Insure

that each desk is madeaware of the pertinent information

relating to the operation of that desk.

_ NW 65360 Docld:32989637 Page 241

## Page 242

Another impolant and prime factor is the fact that

your office must develop "member informants" in each extremist

group and organization in order that you will be in possession

of advanced intormation on all contemplated acts or violence

or other pertinentacts on the part of these

groups prior to

the act taking place.

INSTRUCTIONS

The Bureau must be immediately advised of any

outbreak of demonstrations or proposed demonstrations

within your division. In this regard you should insure

that all employees

are aware that such activities which

occur during the night within your division are brought

to the Bureau's attention by the opening of business

the Seat of Government the following morning. This is

extremely important

as the White House, the Attorney General

and other interested Government agencies rely heavily on

the Bureau to keep them advised of subversive and New Left

activities throughout the United States.

Promptly review your overall operations relating

to your informant program, correcting any weaknesses therein

to Insure an effective program is in operation to develop

"memberinformants" for in-depth coverage in all revolutionary

groups, branches and other affiliations of these groups.

In this

regard it should be stressed

to all agents that

, each have a definite responsibility in this area.

In connection with the violence-oriented extremist

groups, you are reminded that a group of like-minded individuals

as dangerous, or more dangerous, than well-organized

extremist groups. This is pointed out by the increase of

unprovoked

attacks against police and the increase of acts

of violence, not only throughout the United States but in

statistics.

with this

are

given

assignments in conjunction with the group the

informant regularly covers to: (1) cover unaffiliated

extremists; (2)

search out and identify unaffiliated extremists;

(3) attend

public meetings held by extremists; (4) survey

extremist bookstores and other areas where extremists are

known to congregate; (5) insure informants are alert to

violations of both Federal and local statutes by extremists,

particularly those involving weapons of violence as such

violations may be an important factor in directing a

counterintelligence operation against the extremists.

Closely follow investigations relating to all

communes within your division to insure existing Bureau

instructions relating to such communes are followed.

Insure all informants are alerted to the theft

of weapons of violence that could be utilized by extremists

to fulfill their announced intentions.

Insure that all informants are properly indoctrinated

in accordance with existing Bureau regulations with primary

emphasis on prompt reporting of information if in a travel

status to the nearest FBI office.

You should insure that an imaginative and aggressive

counterintelligence program is considered against basic

revolutionary groups insuring such programs are properly

cleared with the Bureau.

emphasis must be made in the

coverage of

each of the 39 Revolutionary Union (U) collectives.

Identify the 205 unidentified revolutionary members and

conduct appropriate investigation and submit Security Index

recommendations.

Expedite background investigation of the 72 known

members of the RU who are not on the Security Indexand

submit reports and recommendations for placing them on

the Security Index.

You should insure that your office is adhering

to the Bureau deadlines in the submission of reports

on

all individuals and organizations.

You should insure that necessary administrative

procedures are set up so that any member of an extremist

group who has violated a law under the Bureau's jurisdiction

within your division is promptly brought to the

attention of

In view of the clear danger the establishment of

this new Soviet Consulate presents to your office, it is

imperative that your overall counterintelligence efforts

SAC ROBERT E. GEBHARDI

10/23/70

PART I. INVESTIGATIVE ASPECTS

A. Since the last inspection the territory covered

by the San Francisco Office has experienced no mass demonstra-

tions, riots or confrontations of a racial nature. The period

has been characterized as an organizational drive for minorities

other than black.

These other minorities are of the belief

that the blacks through organizational activity, demonstrations

and violence have gotten and

are receiving a disproportionate

share of Government funds and attention.

All of these groups

want what they believe is their fair share and that is one

hundred per cent of all that is available. This development has

had a sobering effect on black demands, by occupying their time

attempting to hold on to their recent gains.

Spanish surname groups are the most advanced in their

organizational activities, with Chinese groups iviiowing.

The violence problem involves the shooting of

policemen and numerous bombings.

In San Francisco alone in 1970, four police officers

have met violent ends.

ne boat was it tale bombers of the Pat to see staton:

22, was killed by two

black robbers. On 2/18/70,

Those responsible have never been determined. On 6/19/70,

RICHARD RADETICH was shot through the head in the early morning

hours while writing a traffic ticket in the Haight-Ashbury

District. Those responsible are unknown. On 10/19/70, Officer

HAROLD I HAMILTON, was killed by a bank robber.

Outside of San Francisco, most notable incidents of

the killing and wounding of police officers are as follows:

Black Panther Party (BPP) Capt. RANDY WILLIANS On

the evening of 4/17/70, with two others in Oakland, shot

up a police paddy wagon being driven by two officers.

Both

officers were wounded. Weapons used were both automatic

and conventional. Another police vehicle responding to the

officers' in the paddy wagon call for help came under gunfire

and was hit five times. Those responsible for the shooting

who were fleeing in a stolen vehicle in order to effect an

escape fired a shotgun and threw a hand grenade or bomb

the police vehicle.

A second grenade or bomb injured a bystander

and her five year old daughter.

awaiting trial.

In San Jose on August 6, 1970, during the early

morning hours, Officer Richard Huerta was seated in his police

vehicle with a traffic offender who had run a red traffic

signal. Emit Aubert Thompson a San Jose State College law

enforcement student, walked up to the police vehicle and

emptied six shots at the officer, resulting in his death.

The twenty year old bystander admitted the killing and

claims the act resulted because he hates cops and subscribes

to the BPP philosophy: His father is a veteran police officer

and his brother a jailer of the Oakland Police Department.

In Berkeley on August 20, 1970 after midnight,

officer Bonal Tsukamoto was citing a motorcyclist for

a traffic violation.

A young black bystander engaged

l the

officer in a briet conversation betore pulling a gun

and firing two shots at point blank range, fatally wounding

the officer.

On

August 1, 1910, a shoot-out occurred at the Marin

County Civic Center, Which is in the greater San Francisco

metropolitan area.

An unsuccessful attempt by three convicts

and an accomplice to escape from a court room resulted in the

death of a Superior Court jurist and three other persons,

in addition, wounding a Deputy District Attorney and a juror.

Angela Yvonne Davis,

a self-admitted Communist Party member,

"protessed revolutionary and a recently dismissed Philosophy

instructor at the University of California at Los Angeles,

was charged with kidnapping and

murder for her part in the

abortive escape attempt.

Davis was apprehended by the FBI in

New York City on October 13,

1970 and is awaiting extradition

to California.

An example of an act of extreme violence occurred on

October 8, 1970 at 1:27 a.m.

The same Marin County Civic

Center where the judge and three others were killed was

bombed by persons unknown.

Partially destroyed was a Superior

Courtroom which suffered extensive damage.

## Page 253

In the opinion of many, a definite contributing

factor in the killing of police officers and other acts of

violence by extremists is the BPP official publication,

"The Black Panther"

This weekly newspaper prominently

features and eulogizes so-called revolutionary acts

by any blacks.

There is every reason to expect a continuation

of violence against police

officers and bombings of public

and military buildings.

Since the last inspection, no institution of higher

education has experienced racial disruptions in the territory

covered by San Francisco.

Some gang-type trouble has been

experienced in the high schools and these disturbances

break down along racial lines but are unorganized.

example of such trouble occurred on October 20, 1970 at the

Woodrow Wilson High School in San Francisco.

The school

has 2095 students, the vast majority of which are black.

Gang warfare broke out between the blacks and Samoans.

Only 25 Samoan students attend this school.

D. Plans to Expand Informant Coverage

There is presently underway a plan through which 3?p

is hoped this effort will result in coverage at the top level

of the BPP.

A comprehensive intervier program remains in effect

under which all BPP nembers and ex-membess are being interviewea

at least once and many several times, depending upon their

intelligence and the likelihood of their eventual cooperation.

Honey is known to be an essential lactor and they are advised

of its availability in exchange for their full cooperation.

The BPP is

not presently accepting members; however,

this office maintains

several informants as close to the BPP

as possible los imnediate infiltration into the Party should

the bar to new members be dropped.

local police departments attorna

are reminded repeatedly of

continuing need for good quality informants. All the above-

naned agencies have at one time or anothor provided this office

with the name of a potential source and continue to do so.

All Agents

investigating extremist groups and/or

individuals are constantly reninded of their responsibility

to develop quality informants and neighsorhood sources on

each and every group and individual under investigation.

All ghetto and racial informants are solicited

repeatedly for the names of individuals who they believe can

possibly be of assistance to this office in providing the in-

formation needed in racial matters.

This technique has proven

to be of value as a source for new informants.

Where possible,

ghetto informants are utilized to cover pubiio lunciions,

rallies, or meetings sponsored by militant groups.

They are

provided assignments where compatible with their ability and

encouraged along these lines so that their usefulness to this

office is fully exploited.

All racial informants are constantly educated and

'reminded of the Bureau's responsibilities in the racial field

and the need for timely, accurate intelligence information on

all militant individuals and organizations and their activities.

They are encouraged to engraciate themselves with and to seek

the companionship of individuals in positions of leadershir

and to spend

• as much time as possible in and around the offices

and pads and

in the company of individual leaders.

Emphasis

is placed on determining the likellhood of racial violence and

the locating of weapons, ammunition, and explosives.

Assign-

ments are immediately given to resolve any rumors of the

stockpiling of weapons or explosives.

Successes

are rewarded

by increased payments and bonuses.

All Agents handling racial and ghetto informants have

been repeatedly reminded to report and flash all statistical

are constantly reminded

I to irmediately contact this offico tele-

phonically for instructions in case a racial disturbance appears

in the making

or is underway. All Agents are alerted to contact

their sources by telephone or any way possible. The office main-

tains a chetto informant card index filed oy area.

The card con-

tains the infomant's place of residence and employment and the

K. Anytime a militant organization or group

appears to be taking shape or a legitimate group appears to

become militant a case is immediately opened on that organi-

zation.

The first order of business then becomes the

development of an informant from among the group and/or the

infiltration of that group by an established source. All

Agents are alerted to the need and requested to cooperate.

It becomes the direct responsibility of the case Agent to

follow and assure that adequate live informant coverage is

available on the organization. When coverage decreases from

loss of an informant for some reason, the need is again pin-

pointed and all Agents are requested to assist with

suggested replacements.

sis solicited in

attempting to fill in any gaps in informant coverage. Close

supervision is afforded informant development.

PART II. ADMINISTRATIVE ASPECTS

A.

The racial informant control file in the San

Francisco Office is 170-22.

A separate control file has been

opened to coordinate the development of a top level BPP infor-

mant (170-1030). The counterintelligence file is 157-601.

Individuals identified as members or affiliates of

racial extremist groups come primarily from live informants

and from the technical informant coverage.

Channelizing

memoranda are prepared by Agents handling live informants,

the memoranda routed over the desk and new cases opened

promptly where warranted.

Information originating from

technical coverage is reviewed daily by Agents who prepare

individual memoranda. These memoranda are routed across

the desk and new cases opened promptly.

The key racial extremists are kept in a pending

status •

Information from all sources are channelized to

the files and these files are followed closely on tickler

to insure continuous investigative effort.

c.

The primary responsibility for reporting to the

local police that information received from informants rests

with the case agent handling the informant. The Agent when

dictating the information received from informants remarks

that the

information was given to the local police. The

supervisor when initialing the report for duplication checks

to ascertain that proper dissemination has been made.

D.

Agitator Index cards and Security Index cards are

current. Case Agents have primary responsibility and squad

supervisors reading reports and reviewing files on ticklers

check to determine whether individual names of Subjects

should be included on any index.

E.

The Black Nationalist Photographic Album is main-

tained in the supervisor's office. Necessary changes are

routed to the Squad #9 secretary who makes the changes or

inserts the form into the album, and initials the accompanying

letter. Case is assigned to an

agent for periodic review.

F.

There are no active extremist organizations in San

Francisco Division in which the case agent has failed to

develop an informant. It is to be noted, however, that the

BPP case is assigned

to SA RAYMOND N. BYERS who, because

of enormity of the investigation, acts only in a coordinator

capacity. The overall investigation is handled by the racial

squad and several informants have been developed as indicated

in Part I, Sections B and E.

All Agents operating racial informants have been

advised to report all statistical accomplishments in the

criminal field on FD-209's or contact memos and to flash same

for the attention of the racial supervisor.

These memos or

FD-209's are then routed to the racial informant coordinator

for inclusion in the FD-305-B submitted monthly.

PART III. OUTSIDE INFLUENCE IN RACIAL ACTIVITIES (BPP)

The legats and CIA have been continuously requested

to observe foreign activities of persons and groups sympathetic

B. The effect of New Left and Communist influence

on the BPP has been negligible.

The BPP from the beginning

has been almost solely interested in the problems of the

community blacks, and while repeating Communist and/or

Socialist type slogans, have seldom rendered any assistance

to groups from these leftist organizations.

The BPP attorney is Charles Garry, former CP, USA

member and leftist oriented thinker,

who is, in all

probability, responsible for the leftist slant to BPP

publications, slogans, and teachings.

The most prominent

instance of the cooperation between the BPP and the white

radical left came in the National Convention of the United

in July, 1969.

Up to this time, the BPP had

movement, having as allies such

Moke yarmichaes and samermal

adies such "cultural are undists" as

With the UFAF, it

appeared

a major new development was on hand, as CP, USA

and New Left leaders converged on the gathering and made

speeches.

However, a split ensued between all groups, i.e,

between the biacks

aná

the wnites, and vetween certai

elements of the radical whites.

The CP, USA tell out witr

the New Left, the Jews criticized the BPP for its anti-

Israel stance, and the PLP attacked and was counter-attacked

by the others

in the New Left. This grand design came

apart and eventually Eldridge Cleaver began writing of the

CP,

USA in the past tense,

and attacking Negro writers for

, the "Daily World"

and the

"Guardian".

He engaged in a

polemical discussion, in writing, with William Patterson,

Negro spokesman for

the CP, USA.

Thus, a year or more

later, it might be said that the BPP has little rapport

with the CP. USA and its exemplar, the CP, USSR. The

Soviet Union has received many criticisms in the pages of

"The Black Panther" newspaper.

The New Left does maintain its relations with the

BPP,

seeking Panther support in anti-war demonstrations,

and

in such court cases as Los Siete de la Raza (six Chicanos

accused of killing a San Francisco policeman), the Soledad

brothers (three Negroes accused of killing a

prison guard),

and the Angela layis case,

as examples.

As a follow-up to the UFF type of activity in

1969, in 1970 there have been meetings of the Revolutionary

PART IV. BLACK NATIONALIST MOVEMENT IN THE UNITED STATES

The Monthly Racial Calendar is posted on the bulletin

board in the Supervisor's office and all agents have been in-

structed to pay careful attention to the items listed thereon.

The calendar is also discussed in squad conferences and the

agents

are briefed in order that they can take full advantage

of it.

With regard to the black extremist fugitives the

substantive cases are handled on the Criminal Fugitive Desk as

88 cases (Desk #2);

There is close coordination between those

agents and agents handling racial matters and as an example of

this our technical informant coverage has established that the

review of the racial investigation

and informant files, an analysis of pertinent data furnished

by you, and discussion with supervisory and investigative

personnel handling racial matters:

RACIAL MATTERS - GENERAL

SAN FRANCISCO DIVISION

The general overall picture of racial matters in

your division is as follows:

Nine hundred and seventy pending racial matters

(includes informants) handled by 23 Agents: ? hasic. black extremist

groups (the Black Panther Party (BPPJ), Black Student Union

[BSU] and Nation of Islam [NOI] with 41 chapters or pads com-

prising a reported membership of 1,564 (1,198 are BSU); 9 funds

related to BPP traced; 51 institutions of higher education

with total enrollment of 272,970, number who are Negro and

other racial oriented extremists not identified; 6 ghettos

with a total population of 85,000; 2 black extremist

of 143,000 covered by 14 Racial

Informants (RI) , L0 RI-Probationary

informants, who are primarily listening posts, plus 6 Confi-

dential Racial Sources, and 2 additional excellent sources,

namely ST 3215-R* and SE 3259-R*; only 4 informants in

leadership position.

Since the last inspection,

65 acts of violence

have occurred in the San Francisco Division which resulted

in 503 arrests, 103 police officers injured (civilian

Injuries numerous, but unknown), and I1 deaths.

Targets

of violence included. 9 institutions of learning, 9 Government

and military institutions, 3 utility and 15 commercial

establishments, 5 private

residences, and I church, with total

estimated damage of $961,443.

Included in the 65 acts of

violence were 50 bombing

Acts of violence and figures concerning arrests and damages

include violence caused by both black and

white New Left

militants.

Limited intelligence regarding stolen or stockpiling

weapons of violence in files, however, a check with the

California State Bureau of Criminal Identification and

Investigation disclosed approximately 27,375 guns stolen

per annum in the area covered by the San

Francisco Office.

The extent of racial extremists involved in these thefts is

unknown, however, numerous thefts establish potential source

for racial militants to obtain weapons of violence:

sverYances ects of counterintelligence, A fixed physical

along with 110 other physical surveillances,

were conducted in connection with BPP activities. The

numerous acts of violence and extensive damage to persons

and property is indicative of the absolute need for quality

in-depth informant coverage on all militant extremist groups.

San Francisco is the most important office in connection

with the investigation of the BPP, whose National Headquarters

is located in two adjoining buildings in Oakland, California.

In addition,

two other

active chapters of the BPP are located

in San Francisco and Richmond, California.

The San Francisco

Chapter has on its premises the National Distribution Office

of the BPP where the weekly newspaper,

"The Black Panther," is

prepared. You have advised this paper has a circulation of

about 135,000 copies per week and is distributed througnout

the U.S. and abroad.

As Office of Origin in the BPP investi-

gations, your office has the task of coordinating the

investigation of this extremely militant group

for the whole

country, resulting in an extremely heavy paper load in the

administrative handling of this investigation.

It is imperative that investigations concerning

this terroristic and militant organization be directed with

the utmost imagination and

aggressiveness to insure that

the Bureau's responsibilities are fulfilled.

The most

possession of advanced information on all pertinent contem-

plated acts of this violence-prone group.

informants, particularly in the upper echelon of the BPP

leadership, is apparent in order for the Bureau to fulfill

the grave responsibilities in this field.

It is to be noted that there are schools of higher

education located in each of the above-mentioned RAs.

In the past, there have been militant black student

groups at San Jose State College and San Jose City College,

the University of California at Berkeley, and San Francisco

State College.

These groups have been influenced by or

have members

who are extremists advocating violence-prone

activities.

throughout the San Francisco territory, as well as Headquarters

City Agents, must develop adequate sources and informants

in a position to report on black extremist involvement in

with Bureau letter to all offices dated 1/31/69 captioned

matters points out the critical need for in-depth member

informant coverage in all of the above areas to insure that

you can accurately assess violence potential in the

San Francisco Division. Although you have indicated that

several of the BSU chapters have not been prone to violence

or; indicated any real militant activity, the potential remains,

:and adequate coverage of these groups is imperative.

You have advised that since the last inspection,

the territory, covered by your office has experienced no

mass demonstrations, riots or confrontations of a racial

nature. You characterized this period as an organizational

• drive for minorities other than blacks.

The number of acts

of violence which have occurred in your division would

indicate that Negro militants could certainly have

participated in some of these acts and your office must

make certain that your coverage of extremist groups, whether

organized or independent, receives an aggressive approac

in order that any

participation by these individuals 1s

known to you prior to their participation in acts of violence.

' Incidents which may not, on the surface, appear to be black

nationalist oriented could certainly provoke a reaction on

the part of extremists and lead to a civil disturbance in

ghetto areas.

This is particularly true in situations

_where: local police make

an arrest in a ghetto area where

it does not take an incident of great magnitude to incite

a riot.

NOI

You have indicated that you have two

informants covering the NOl Temple in San FrancisCo, as

well as the NOI Temple in Oakland. Although the NOI does

not advocate racial violence,

at present they tollow the

line of preaching hatred to tho white race.

You should

remain alert to the need for excellent coverage of the NoI

and exert your efforts to improve your member coverage in

order to remain alert to all activities of this extremist

Counterintelligence

It is noteworthy that you have completed 28

counterintelligence projects since the last inspection

and currently have

wunder submission to the Bureau for

approval. The accomplishments have included successfully

cancelling a speech of BPP leader David Hilliard and Attorney

continually needed in order to disrupt and confuse not only

the BPP, but all other black extremist organizations and

activities within

It is

incumbent upon the

personnel handling racial investigations

to be aware of the tremendous

importance to recognize

opportunities to neutralize individual black extremists

The black extremists have

accelerated their terrorist tactics in recent months and

local police have borne the burden of their attacks. The

BPP, which is the vanguard of black extremism, has

been

responsible for many of the attacks on police.

INVESTIGATIONS OF BLACK EXTREMIST

ORGANIZATIONS AND INDIVIDUALS

All Special Agents handling racial matters

investigation should be familiar with instructions set

out in Bureau airtel to all offices

•Atta sure Part, Exerentse Activita You should insure

that instructions concerning the opening of cases in

accordance with this airtel

are followed.

You should make certain that personnel handling

racial matiers are

complotely familiar with the airtel directed

by the Bureau to all offices dated 10/12/70 captioned

"Black Panther Party, Racial Matters - Black Panther Party".

It is imperative that you are promptly instituting

investigation of all black extremist organizations, as well

as those individuals

who are openly advocating violence,

"anarchy or insurrection.

These investigations

must be

directed to promptly

ascertain the aims and objectives,

as well as the identities of the leaders and members.

extent of each group's involvement in the black nationalist

movement must be determined promptly.

You must be aggressive

and imaginative, and these investigations should be

pursued with the purpose of developing evidentiary material

with a goal of prosecution.

The ever-present need to be alert for information

concerning revolutionary extremists who may be planning

hijacking of airplanes or kidnapping of government officials

should be impressed on all personnel. Make certain the

Bureau is promptly advised of all circumstances

concerning

this more current and important area of our work.

Agents

handling racial matters should

be familiar with

SAC Letter

70-18 (C), which sets out guidelines for handling of bombings

or arsons which appear to have black extremist or New Left

connotations or modifications.

Make certain that personnel assigned to racial

matter investigations are entirely familiar concerning the

fact that active investigation of gun law violations

should be conducted when these violations directly relate

to any investigation of which the Bureau has primary

investigative jurisdiction. This is particularly pertinent

to investigations concerning the BPP, as well as other

terroristic, extremist and hate groups.

Agents handling racial matters must be familiar

with SAC Letter 68-74 (D)

dated 12/24/68, which instructs

that certain black extremists may be interviewed with SAC

authority.

Further, you should continue to make certain that

where there are public rallies or demonstrations by extremists

that appropriate steps to record speeches made at these

gatherings by black extremists are being made.

In this

regard, you should obtain tape recoraings of other speeches

made by extremists which are heard within your territory.

Agitator Index (AI)

You have advised that you have 59 individuals

listed on the AI, of which 30 are affiliated with black

extremist groups.

Out of the 30, 15 are affiliated with

the BPP, including Charles a Garty Bet Attorney®

Penetrative

and aggressive investigation of black

nationalist militant

groups, as well as continued effective attention to white

hate groups, should result in the increase of individuals

placed on

the AI. You should make certain that personnel

recommending subjects for the AI also consider their

inclusion on the Security Index when they possess

necessary criteria.

Racial Informants

As office of origin for the BPP, you have a

critical responsibility for developing informants in this

group who are knowledgeable concerning the overall activities

of the BPP throughout the United States and especially

knowledgeable concerning the activities of the BPP within

your division. You have made some progress in developing

informants in the BPP. However, this progress is limited

and, there is an urgent need for development of additional

quality informants in this organization. The immediate

need for informants in the racial field was shown earlier

in this write-up where it was indicated that numerous acts

of violence have occurred in your division since the last

inspection in which you were unable to furnish information

as to the

participants or whether or not the violence was

racial oriented.

A particular weakness on the part of San

Francisco has been to develop informants in the upper echelon

Leadership of the BPP who can furnish information concerning

details of BPP finances and overall day-to-day activities

in the BPP offices.

An example of San Francisco's weakness concerning

informant coverage is noted in your file 157-5822, which

concerns an allegation that two

It is noted that authority was granted by the Bureau

for your division to enter into a three-phase operation in an

attempt to develop the head of the BPP Breakfast Program,

ELLIS WHITE, as an informant. You have successfully completec

spection that you contemplate completing Phase 2 in early

November, 1970.

This operation should receive imaginative

and close supervision in order to receive the success

desired.

The increase in the number of racial informants

is noteworthy and this desirable trend should be continued.

Bureau records indicate that you have it racial informants,

10 racial informant probationaries, and 281- ghetto informants.

The difference between the Bureau records and the above

tabulation is explained due to the recent approval of new

racial informants and the closing of some ghetto informants.

The development of sources, particularly in the Resident

Agency territories where so many institutions of higher

education are located, is an urgent need of the San Fran-

cisco Division.

The favorable growth in the number of ghetto

informants is noteworthy and necessary if the substantial

need to increase the number of RIs and RI (probs) is met by

your office.

Each of your racial informants and your probationary

racial informants were rated and you have been advised

individually of these ratings, which are set forth as follows

in a tabulation for your ready reference.

The need for additional quality informant coverage

cannot be over-emphasized, particularly since you have

several areas that have experienced acts of violence where

there are no racial informants and racial informant probationaries.

Although you have indicated ghetto informants have been

developed in some of these areas, you recognize that these

informants are primarily listening posts and have not been able

to furnish the quality intelligence information that is

needed for the Bureau to fulfill its responsibilities in

the racial field.

You should insure that this matter of

developing quality racial informants is immediately brought

to the attention of all Resident Agents and afforts choula ba

made to reverse this undesirable situation.

During this inspection, you were advised separately

by "trend memoranda" concerning certain delinquencies in the

handling of racial informant files.

It is most important

that Agents

handling racial matter

informants be completely

familiar: with Bureau instructions and that these instructions

are followed explicitly. Make certain that all Agents are

giving their informants

assignments and are alert for

evidentiary-type information,

as well as intelligence-type

information.

Due to the sensitivity of informant files,

you should continue to insure that these files are being

afforded complete security and that personnel having access

are mature individuals who can be expected to maintain

them under the most secure conditions.

With respect to your ghetto informants, insure

they are being given

assignments, including attendance

at public meetings held by extremists, survey of

extremist book stores, verification of residence and

employment of AI and SI subjects living or working in

ghetto areas, identity of extremists agitating in local

areas and information concerning youth gangs operating

in neighborhoods in such a fashion as to increase racial tension.

NW 65360 Docld:32989637 Page 292

## Page 293

- 12-

You should remain alert to the fact that ghetto

informants, in view of their unique positions in

usually

high-crime

areas and since black extremists are involved

in criminal activities,

should also be obtaining criminal

statistics in addition

to racial-type information.

In

this connection, San Francisco, only five months out of

the last 17 months, has furnished criminal statistics

achieved through RIs, which includes ghetto informants.

The field average in

submitting criminal statistics from

racial informants is 8 out of 17.

Your office should devise

a workable program wherein all criminal statistics achieved

through sacial informants are properly recorded and racial

informants are given proper assignments.

In addition, make certain that personnel handling

racial informants are uiilizing

the Black Extremist Fualtive

List in connection with the National Photograph Album.

Special Agents should be familiar with the instructions

set out in Bureau letter to all field offices dated 8/29/70,

captioned "Black Extremist Activities in Penal Institutions,

Racial Matters".

In addition,

this is essential for evidence to be used in connection

with the possible forthcoming Smith Act prosecutions.

Make

certain you continue to give your informants proper direction

so that

full value can be obtained from their potential.

SE 3122 rob and SE 3056-R appear to have

potential for obtaining valuable racial information, as

well as evidentiary information. It is imperative that

these informants be utilized in

such a way that their

potential value is consummated.

Stockpiling of Weapons and Ammunition

our control file 157-3021 captioned "BPP

WEAPONS AND EXPLOSIVES", and 157-1171, "Stockpiling of

Arms and Ammunition", were reviewed and indicate that

these matters receive almost daily attention from SE-3215-R

It is imperative that all agents are constantly made aware

of the tremendous importance of these matters and the need

for quality informants to provide information in this

field. During the current inspection, a timely example

of the need for informants in this particular area was

noted when the Oakland Police Department recovered a cache

of weapons and explosives which included 20 sticks of dynamite,

and other guns and explosives.

They were recovered

0n 10/27/70, at the 55th Avenue Motel in Oakland.

Further, another timely example during the

current inspection occurred when five individuals were

arrested on a military reservation in your territory while

doing target practice, including one using a rifle that was

determined to be stolen from the military. These individuals

were identified as former BPP members and

associates.

Again,

the demand and absolute necessity for quality in-depth

informants to apprise you of the individuals maintaining

weapons of violence is apparent.

it.

-14-

Make certain that all informants, both in the

racial and criminal field, are properly alerted concerning

thefts of weapons of violence in an attempt to determine

II they are being stolen by individuals connected with

extremist activities.

Observations

The BPP is noted for its terroristic nature

and philosophy of violence. Never in our history have

we been confronted with as

critical a need

for informant

coverage in such a violence-oriented organization. Bombings,

kidnappings, murder of

police officers are all included in

militant fanatics.

ever spiraling crime rate, particularly in the ghetto,

has provided additional fuel for the militant and malcontent.

The racial situation is extremely serious and presents a

perplexing domestic problem which cannot be over stressed.

The vital role of the Bureau's personnel in the racial

field

is pressing and apparent.

The Bureau is constantly being

judged by our ability to

• develop timely intelligence, to

identify the leaders, the direction of movement of all

radical groups and, where possible, to predict potential

trouble spots.

To fulfill

these grave responsibilitles,

we must have an efficient wide-spread network of intelligent.

resourcetul, aggressive

attention should be rectified

as quickly as possible and

so that all information relating

to potential violence will be brought to the Bureau's

attention.

INSTRUCTIONS 1

•1. All Agents of your office, regardless. of

their assignments, must be aware of the urgent need for the

development of an

informant network which can provide accurate,

timely and advanced information concerning the black extremists.

Primary needs for informant coverage within the San Francisco

operating within the BPP Headquarters

instructed to closely follow this informant in an aggressive

and imaginative manner in an attempt to accomplish coverage

within BP HeadquarterS.

2. In-depth member informants of the black

extremists are absolutely necessary.

In this regard you

are instructed to intensify your interview program and

exert aggressive action to satisfy the urgent need for

informants in the upper echelon of BP leadership.

3. You should immediately designate informants

on the peripheral of the BPP for priority attention inasmuch

as BPP membership may open up at any time and should have

some informants ready to move in.

In this regard, current

• BPP member informants should be designated for direction

to move into leadership positions should such positions

develop.

4. You should aggressively pursue the potential

for BPP informants through the infiltration of Panther

pads.

An individual properly directed could possibly be

accepted in the pad which could not only provide coverage

but lead to a BPP leadership position.

5.

Investigation of all pads and community

centers in your division should be followed closely to make

certain that the black extremists are identified and

investigated in accordance with Bureau instructions.

6. Make certain that all informants are alerted

to the theft of weapons of violence in order that your office

and the Bureau can be promptly advised of extremists involved

in potential acts of violence.

7. The necessity for complete informant coverage

is apparent and you should immediately instruct that where

black extremist groups, including the Black Student Union,

is located in your territory without coverage that efforts

be made to correct this deficiency at once.

In this regard,

the recent change in Bureau policy permitting interviews of

individuals under 21 years of age should be made known to

all personnel handling these matters in an attempt to increase

your informant coverage.

8 .

You should continue your counterintelligence

program and be alert to any new schemes you might submit to

the Bureau for approval to use in this regard.

9. You should consider the placing of all black

extremist fugitives now handled on the criminal squads on

the desk of the Racial Matters Supervisor.

Further in this

regard, you must make certain that all black extremists

who are subjects of substantive cases on criminal desks

are coordinated with the Racial Matters Desk.

10. You are further instructed to make the

Monthly Racial Calendar available to all Agents in the San

Francisco Office as well as the Black Fugitive Extremist List.

Agents contacting informants outside of normal working

hours obtained supervisory approval for these contacts

prior to making them and make appropriate notations on

their #3 cards.

Supervisors thereafter, during file

reviews with Agents, check with them regarding those

contacts and spot-check informant files to insure after-

hour contacts were made and appropriately recorded.

PROGRAM DEVELOPMENT •

1. The overall objectives of the criminal informant program

are to develop high quality informants who are in a

position to furnish valuable information on a continuing

basis.

Criminal desk supervisors participate in the program by

remaining

alert to the necessity of having good informant

coverage in the criminal classifications which are covered

Dy their respective desks. The supervisor is also

required to approve any expenditure made to an informant

for information or services concerning any case

handled on his desk and in this way will be aware of the

progress of the program as it relates tactivities in

The supervisors also follow the Agents'

this regard on an individual basis to insure that they

are fully participating in the informant program.

The San Francisco Office does have standards which

requires all Agents assigned one year or more to this

division should conform to and that is they should have

a minimum of four PCIs or one CI and two PCIs or two

CIs assigned at any one time. This, of course, is by

no means considered a maximum and many Agents

participate more fully in the program.

There are currently no first office agents assigned to

this division and when an Agent is transferred to this

division and assigned to criminal work he is expected

to show some progress by the end of sixty days and

within one year he is expected to be in compliance

with the above standarûs.

Regarding the Government reservations, it is noted

that specific liaison assignments have been made in regard

to these but inasmuch as persons normally contacted on these

bases are Government employees contacted on an official

basis, they are not considered appropriate for development

as CIs and are bound to furnish information as part of

their duties.

It is noted, however, that the Hunters Point

Naval Shipyard is in a predominantly Negro area and two

PRIs, 170-845 and 170-241, are under development at that

location by sas assigned to this squad.

SANTA CRUZ RA

• The Santa Cruz RA is a three-man RA with two agents,

PATRICK, J. HAGGERTY, JR. and JOSEPH A. DUSHEK, handling

the criminal work in this area.

The

territory covered by

this RA is basically rural in nature and no specific targets

have been picked for this territory.

It is noted, however,

three CIs are currently being handled in this RA and in

addition, they have a symbol racial informant and a top

echelon criminal informant target. These informants are as

follows:

• 137-4132

137-5651

137-5280

137-5112

170-613

SANTA ROSA RA

Criminal matters in the Santa Rosa RA are handled

by SAS WILLARD E. BASEMAN and DOUGLAS R. AHLSTROM.

The Santa Rosa RA covers three rural counties of

Sonoma, Mendocino and lake, comprising some 7000 square

miles

in area.

The bulk of criminal activity is located in

and around the headquarter city of Santa Rosa, California

(Sonoma County). Informant coverage has been established

in the legalized cararooms and night clubs in this area.

Coverage in the counties of Mendocino and Lake is

limited to the close personal relationship with deputy

sheriffs that cover the remote areas of these counties, which

principal industries are logging and ranching.

There are no principal targets for informant

development, such as shipping companies, railroads, airports,

or large industries.

Coverage has been established in

gambling, 137-3976 and 137-4486. In night clubs, coverage

has been established with females, 137-5819 and 137-5818,

both of whom are furnishing quality information and will

be

converted

as CIs.

In deserter and Selective Service matters, hippie

coverage is maintained in Guerneville, California (Sonoma

County) through 137-5462.

This latter town is largely a

summer resort town

for the area, but does have a hippie

population in the winter months

as well.

Also, in the

Indian and Mexican deserter fugitive matters, 137-1412

gives coverage to the skid row section of Santa Rosa,

California.

WALNUT CREEK RA

Criminal investigations in the Walnut Creek PA are

handled by SAs RUDOLPH H. MANCINI and FRANKLIN S. BURROUGHS.

This RA covers a territory which consists of

several large "bedroom" communities and a large section that

is rural in nature.

The only problem high crime rate area in the

territory is the City of Pittsburg, which is a Negro ghetto-

type area

and specific eliorts have been made to develop

informant coverage in this area. The following informants

have been developed and furnish general criminal and racial

information for the Pittsburg area:

137-674

137-5079

In addition, the RA handles four other informants

and they are:

137-3135

137-5395

137-3529

137-4685

Yes, in line with the answer to question two above,

agents are expected to submit a replacement at the

earliest possible date.

Supervisors participate in the informant program in that

they must approve all expenditures to informants furnishing

In this way they are aware of the productivity.

of the informant program as it concerns them. Also,

if there is any particular problem concerning the

handling of a particular informant, a supervisor is

expected to assist and give guidance to the agent

handling this particular informant.

Supervisors are

Supervisors in this office are not required to approve

either closing or opening memoranda on informant files.

However, efforts are made on a

The criminal informant files

are also specifically reviewed on a semi-annually basis

at the time the semi-annual IHMs are submitted to the

Bureau.

It is also noted files are checked at the time

they are posted on a continuing basis.

year they have been opened on an individual basis and

if they have been unproductive the agent is advised to

close the case and replace the PCI with anew one.

10/27/70

All criminal informant (CI) files and a representative

number of potential criminal informant (PCI) files were reviewed

during this inspection.

Following review, a memorandum

disclosing the rating

afforded in each file has been forwarded

to you for inclusion

in the respective file.

Your office is currently operating 145 CIs as

compared to 141 CIs being operated at the time of the last

inspection. There is also an increase in the number of PCIS

under development at this time to 271 as opposed to 250 under

development during the last inspection.

which are commented on separately under the Criminal Intelligence

Program. This represents a slight increase in the number of

CIs and a more substantial increase in the number of PCIs

under development.

However, there is a slight decrease in

two large metropolitan areas, namely, San

Francisco and Oakland,

which though slight represents a static situation as to

• increasing coverage in these areas.

The Oakland Resident

also recorded a decrease in the number of PCIs

In analyzing the coverage in the resident

agencies, it was noted that Monterey, Richmond and San Jose

have the same coverage from CIs as during the last inspection

although Monterey and San Jose have shown a substantial

increase in the number of PCIs being handled. PCIs under

development in Salinas and San Rafael are down somewhat,

AGENT PARTICIPATION

You have indicated Special Agents JAMES P. MALOY,

CARLTON H. 'WOLFARTH and GARY N. MAVITY have spent 50% or

more of their time on criminal type investigative matters

during thepast year but do not currently have assigned a

qualified CI personally developed by them. Further comment

is being set forth later in this addendum concerning these

Agents.

PAYMENTS

A review of payments indicates that your office

paid an average of $1,473.98 a month to informants during

the period immediately preceding the last inspection. For

the period immediately preceding this inspection, an average

of $1,643.10 was paid to informants each month.

A spot

check of payments made to CIs and PCIs indicated value was

being received for the money paid. You should insure that

your personnel are alert to the use of monetary payments to

enlist the further cocheration of informants by compensating

them for expenses incurred in pursuit of information for

this Bureau and as compensation for their effort on the

Bureau's behalf.

You should continue to closely evaluate

informant payments to insure that value is received for money

paid.

increases

According to Bureau records your office shows

in 4 of the 8 statistical accomplishments

attributable to informants and it is noted that these

increases have occurred in matters concerned directly with FBI

investigations.

PROGRAM DEVELOPMENT

You have indicated a rather extensive involvement

of supervisory personnel in directing informant development to

those areas of responsibility coming within the scope of

their respective desks.

Referring to Government reservations

and military installations, you indicated you do not

consider Government employees

appropriate for development as

CIs as they are bound to furnish information as part of

their duties.

Your attention is specifically directed to

175.

-MVVL65360_Docld:32989637 Page 324

---

## Page 325

5

Section 108, I-12, Volume 4, Manual of Instructions, which

states informants

should be developed on Government

reservations

and military installations when warranted.

In

view of the large installations located within your territory,

it is suggested you identify particular areas of these

installations wherein informant coverage would be logical

and productive and give consideration to pinpointing such areas

for development.

You have also indicated that Supervisors approve

payments to informants and in this way are also aware of the

productivity of the informant program. However, It is noted

that approval of payments provides a rather limited

assessment of the productivity of informants and points out

the need for a continuing evaluation of respective coverage.

Supervisors

must constantly be alert to identify specific

areas in which informant coverage would be logical and

hinductive.

OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

You should give consideration to the development

of

informants on Government reservations and military

installations as suggested by the Manual of Instructions.

In a number of instances, it was noted there was

no follow-up on incomplete information furnished by informants.

In such instances, the informant was not recontacted any

sooner than required by the 30 day contact rule, which would

indicate a lack of direction of the informant to further

develop information of interest.

The need to give informants

direction to develop information to the point it can be

considered useful and valuable should be brought to the

attention of all appropriate investigative personnel.

There were few instances noted during review of

the CI files wherein FD-302's had been utilized in recording

informant information. It is recognized that much information

regarding fugitives and possible suspects does not require

NW 65360' Docld: 32989637 Page 325

## Page 326

- 6 -

such recording but in view of the recent passage of Senate

Bill 30 which will

greatly expand the opportunity to utilize

informant information, you should make certain all personnel

are aware of those instances in which informant information

should be

recorded on an FD-302 and the proper method for so

recording it.

Numerous areas have been identified in your

territory as being the habitat of ethnic, ghetto and hippie

elements, many with

a high incidence of crime.

• to provide

a better

over-all view of the coverage in San Francisco and

the heavily populated East Bay area and to facilitate a more

convenient, ready reference for the agents of your office to

this information, you should consider preparing a large wall

map of the San Francisco - East Bay area and placing it in a

central secure position in the office.

In addition to criminal

informants, you should include the location in which racial

and ghetto informants will logically be able to furnish

information and you should identify the location of all these

informants on the map with an appropriate locator reference

to an index showing the agent to whom the intormant is

assigned and the coverage which informant can be expected to

provide.

EXPLANATIONS REQUESTED

Explanations are requested from SA'S JAMES P. MALOY,

CARLTON H. WOLFARTH and GARY N. MAVITY as to why they have

not developed a qualified criminal informant during the past

year.

number of CI'S since the last inspection and have increased

the number of PCI'S since the last inspection.

We have also

increased our payments to informants and no instances have

been found where we did not

get value received from

payments to informants.

We have achieved excellent statistics

from them as indicated

by the fact that at the close of the

last fiscal year we were ahead in all eight categories of

informant accomplishments. This is our continuing

goal and

we will make every effort to surpass these accomplishments

in the coming months. The observations, instructions and

suggestions

of the Inspector will be immediately complied

with and this program will continue to receive close

super-

vision in order to get maximum results in connection with

our work.

In the period of time I have been

assigned to criminal work I have

handled a number of PCIs with a view

to the qualification of them as

approved Criminal Informants.

In the past year since I

last had

an approved Criminal Informant I have handled

several PCIs including one who previously was the prime

factor in the apprehension of a Bureau fugitive wanted

for the murder of a police officer.

This PCI has since

furnished information of value which was relayed to the

local police in a burglary case. He has been given the

assignment to develop further information concerning local

suspects

in the handling of stolen merchandise from this

and other burglaries.

In the past year I have been unable

to devote a great deal of time to the development of this

and other PCIs due to having been utilized as Relief

supervisor in the absence of the regular supervisor and

because of the time necessary. to prepare and present lectures

at police schools on legal matters.

I am aware of the importance of the

Criminal Informant Program and will continue efforts to

develop a qualified Criminal Informant and expect to

qualify the above-mentioned PCI in the very near future.

I am extremely aware of the need to

develop CIs and have had a total of

CHW : ekk

nine PCIs in San Francisco during the

time I have been in san Francisco.

I arrived in the San Francisco Division,

7/13/69, on transfer from the Chicago Division. It is to be noted

that I

developed CG 72150 in 1967.

This informant had either

worked for or was close to the top men of organized crime in Chicago,

Miami and New Orleans.

At one time, through a court order, this

Informant was wired with a microphone and tape recorder so

Information could be obtained in an Obstruction of Justice case.

I had at least one other informant while I was handling the

above informant, and handled both until leaving Chicago.

The potential of the four PCls which I

opened on 8/24/70 and the one which I opened 10/19/70 appears

promising and it 1s anticipated that at least one will develop

into a ci in the near future.

My assignments in san trancisco javo

been

mainly ITSP - FBW Investigations which are complicated and

involve reviewing records and interviews with banks, brokerage

house and other business officials.

opportunity to develop a good CI when LOUIS MARDER, Las Vegas

Led to

the recovery of $650,000 worth of Avco Thrift Certificates

at Las Vegas. MARDER as recently as 10/27/70, furnished me

valuable information. He cannot be developed into a CI because

he lives in Las Vegas and is under Federal indictment In Miami. .

I am sorry that this delinquency on

my part happened. It is regretted and I will not let it happen

pointed out that failure to meet this challenge reflects

and an FBI official. The SAC was instructed to take

immediate steps to analyze the investigative and supervisory

programs and take corrective action where necessary.

As will be noted for the first three months of

the current fiscal year (FY), your convictions are deficient

by 37% as are your fines, savings, and recoveries. This

is a continuation of a most undesirable trend.

In analyzing the lack of convictions, it was

noted that you had a decline in the Theft From Interstate

Shipment classification of 39% in fiscal year 1970, and

a continuation of this downward

trend during the first

three months of the current FY. In the Selective Service

category during the first three months of FY 1971 you

obtained only 9 convictions as compared with 21 in the

prior year for a decline of 57% This number of convictions

seems

very low when considering the fact that as of 9/30/70

you had pending in this office 2257 cases in this category.

During first three months of current Fy there has

been a decline of 87% in the ITSMY category (1 vs 8) and

a decline of 86% in the Theft of Government Property classi-

1). In addition, no convictions were obtained

Supr. ANDRESS:

Concerning the decline of Selective Service

10/28/70

statistical accomplishments for the first

three months of 70-71 as compared to 69-70,

it will be noted that in an endeavor to expedite these

matters through the U.S. District Courts, a conference was

held on February 26, 1970

, with the U.s. Attorney for the

Northern District of California at San Francisco, Mr. James I.

Browning, representatives of the California State Selective

service system, the local selective service System and

three members of the U.S. Department of Justice. Continual

weekly contacts are made with the U.S. Attorney to expedite

these matters and again on July 10, 1970, a conference was

held which included the U.S. Attorney, San Francisco, the

Director of the California State Selective Service System

and the Director of the National Selective Service System,

Mn. Cuntis Tari, along wiül attorneys for the national

Selective Service System and representatives of the U.s.

Department of Justice.

These matters are followed

closely

with a minimum of two

contacts a

week being made with the

U.S. Attorney. It will be noted that many of these matters

have been postponed as many as sir to eight times in U.s.

District Court and several conferences have been had with

former Chief U.S. District Court Judge George B. Harris, and

on 10/15/70 U.S. Attorney James

I. Browning discussed these

matters with the new Chief U.S. District Court Judge of San

Francisco, Oliver B: Carter.

Every effort has been made

through sources available to this office to expedite these

matters in U.S. District Court. It will be noted that as of

10/14/70 the San Francisco Office had 414 outstanding

indictments. 57 of these are fugitives that are out of the

country and since that date, on October 14, 15 and 21, 1970,

an additional 39 indictments

have been obtained giving a total

of #53 outstanding indictments.

The total Selective Service

matters presently awaiting

Federal Grand Jury action is 749.

The decline in statistics in the Selective Service category is

due to the lack of action on the part of the U.S. District

Court Judges due to the

lack of enthusiasm and the coddling

of these cases by the U.S: District Court Judges.

It will

be noted that several of these cases have been under submission

to U.S. District Court Judge CARTER for over one year: I will

continue close aggressive liaison with the U.S. Attorney and

U.S. District Courts and endeavor to increase the statistical

accomplishments in this category.

SUPERVISOK

DE JEAN:

The Inspector advised that there has

10/28/70

been a decline of 87% in ITSMV

classification (1 vs. 8)

and a

decline of 86% in the TGP classification (1 vs. 7).

These

two classifications are supervised by me on Desk 3 of this

office.

The following tabulations are set forth below which

set out the convictions of this desk from 7/1/70 to 10/16/70,

the date the inspection commenced, as compared with a like

period the preceding year, 7/1/69 to 10/16/69.

One of the main reasons for reduction in convictions

'in the 26 classification this year over last year is the

Departmental guidelines pertaining to ITSMV matters.

The

combination of the 52-70 convictions this year is 18, as

compared with 13 last year.

I realize that the 26 and 52

convictions independently are below last year, but evers

effort is being made to achieve and thereafter exceed the

goal set during the preceding year.

I constantly stress to those Agents in Headquarters

and the Resident Agencies which cover sources of 52 matters,

government reservations, transport facilities (shipment of

government property), to be constantly alert to obtain those

matters which

should be investigated by the FBI.

In addition, I would like to point out that I will

continue to take all necessary steps to exceed this year in

the statistical accomplishments of this squad over the

previous

year.

I would like to point out that I have taken the

necessary steps

and will continue to do so in compliance with

Bureau instructions

to streamline the ITSMV matters and handle

1o 2 an

only those that are fully justified and at the same time

pursue those that are justified towards convictions.

-SUPERVISOR GLENN A. HARTER:

ITSP Matters

There was a gain in ITSP matters of one conviction

in fiscal year 1970 (seven) over fiscal year 1969 (six).

On 9/24/70, the San Francisco Office obtained one

conviction in the ITSP field (BUfile 87-111262, SFfile 87-31516).

We have every reason to believe therewill be a

large per

centage increase in statistical accomplishments in the ITSP

field for fiscal year 1971. We have a large amount of quality

cases offering an excellent potential for statistical

accomplish-

At the present time we have four individuals indicted

in the 87- category.

Additionally, we have eleven other

subjects wherein we

believe indictments will be obtained.

of thesematters have already been discussed with the USA,

who has

indicated he will

seek indictments. Additionally;

we have two 87- cases awaiting pleas under Rule 20 in other

field offices.

In view of the above,

we anticipate that we will

have at least seventeen convictions in the 87- field by the

end of the fiscal year 1971, plus any other cases that might

be reported to us.

There is every reason to believe in 1971

that we will not only equal but considerably exceed the

statistical accomplishments that we obtained in 1970.

As

noted above, we expect to at least double the amount of

convictions

obtained last year.

Mention should be made here to accurately present

; the accomplishments of the

squad in this category that as a

result of information obtained and developed by one of the

agents, the Las Vegas Office was able to recover $650,000

,of Avco thrift certificates (BUfile 87-108171, SFfile

87-30355).

Iris Matters

The decline in convictions in this category has been

a matter of great concern, and every effort is being made to

reverse this situation.

The Bureau

has been kept advised in

detail of this situation.

This decline

in convictions during

IIscal year 1970 was a direct result of a change of policy

in the

USA's office concerning the prosecution of these cases.

The high volume of convictions obtained by the San Francisco

¡Office in past years was attributable to the policy of taking

NW 65360 Docld:32989637 Page 336

181

---

## Page 337

setty oftenders before the Use on the day that they were ap

nehended and on that same dav they would usuallv be sentence

after a guilty plea.

The USA's office noted in a letter dated

1/11/69 that a review by their office of cases presented to

them in past years disclosed that almost none of the offenses

involved TFIS thefts where the value of the goods exceeded

$100 and that over 95 per cent of the cases referred to the

USA by the FBI had been handled by the USC under the Assimilative

Crimes Act.

The USA's office has recently had conferences

with the san trancisco ID and the san

Francisco District

Attorney and has informed them of their policy not to prosecute

minor thefts of cases involving less than $100 and has urged

the San Francisco PD and District Attorney to accept and

handle these cases.

At the time of the current inspection, the San

Francisco Office has obtained eleven convictions compared to

twelve convictions obtained last year at this time.

Although

we are down ons conviction compared to last year at this.

time, there is every reason to believe that

we will exceed

last

year's accomplishments, as we have some good cases

pending prosecution.

As noted above, the type of case we are handling

now as compared to those

in the past, is one that

is more

likely to produce a high recovery value, -and it should be

noted that

the amount recovered to date during the current

fiscal year is $159,000, as compared to $6,000 last year.

I have personally discussed the prosecution of

TFIS cases with USA JAMES BROWNING, as well as several of

his assistants, pointing out the need for prompt indictment

and prosecution.

The Bureau is aware, of

course, of the

change in personnel of the USA's office, including the USA.

Another reason for the fact that we have not exceeded last

year's number of convictions

, is the cases

currently pending

prosecution have been assigned and re-assigned several tmes

to different AUSAs, as there has been a.large turnover in

their staff.

There are currently three new attorneys which

handle the majority of these prosecutions, none who have

been in office more than several months,

and

as the files will

reflect in those cases offering a potential for prosecution,

they have stated they have not

as yet had an opportunity to

review the case?.

since it had just been recently assigned to

them.

USA BROWNING has

advised that he is making every

effort to obtain faster indictments and subsequent prosecution

MW- 65360_Docld:32989637 Page 337

188

---

## Page 338

of these cases, and he hopes with additional experience on

his part and on the part of his staff that cases will be

handled in a more expeditious

manner.

Additionally, I have personally called upon local

businessmen in the transporation industry who are a source

of these cases, as well as having had frequent discussions

with local police and District Attorney LOWELL JENSEN of

Alameda County and Chief Criminal Deputy H.F. CLIFFORD

of San Francisco County, in order to apprise them of the

Bureau's policy and obtain more cooperation in these matters.

As noted above, we are only one conviction behind

our record of last year at this time and most definitely

feel

that we will exceed our number of convictions obtained

in fiscal 1970.

I base this optimistic forecast on the fact

that the tremendous expenditure of squadi agent time last

year in connection with civil rights cases will not be

duplicated

in fiscal 1971 and that this tremendous amount of

investigative time can be directed toward securing additional

statistical accomplishments in those classifications handled

by squad #5.

General Observations

In order to accurately present an over-all picture

of the accomplishments of Squad #5, it should be noted that in

fiscal year 1970 nine convictions were obtained in the 43-

• classification against four for the previous. fiscal year,

and we have obtained one so far this fiscal year.

Additionally, much of the efforts of this squad have

been directed

towards the handling of

the civil rights

cases

which grew out of the People's Park riots in Berkeley in 1969.

Currently indicted are twelve Alameda County sheriff deputies

and former deputies. It is estimated approximately 800 to 1000

interviews have been conducted by the squad in connection

with the civil rights cases, all of which have had very short

period deadlines.

The USA has just commended this office by

letter dated 10/21/70 for the extremely able investigative

efforts and other assistance given to the USA's office.

These

trials are currently scheduled.

One took place in October;

another is

scheduled for 11/2

and the tremendous amount of

time

and attention give to these civil rights cases has taken

that investigative time away from other classifications

that might be more productive statistically.

Concerning the fact that the office is currently

deficient under the category fines, savings and recoveries,

189.

NW 65360 Docld:32989637 Page 338

## Page 339

it should be pointed out herethat a report has been submitted

a recovery value of sixty million

dollars

was claimed, which added to the fines, savings and

recoveries, will out the office well ahead of last year ir

this category. (BUfile 44-23710, SEfile, 44-842).

BANK ROBBERY SURVEY

Inspector ARVOLD C. LARSON: Information concerning the bank

10/27/70

SHO/ jI

robbery survey supplied by the

San Francisco Office is reported

in Section 4-M-1 of the work papers of this inspection.

The following observations and comments regarding bank

robbery matters are based upon a review of all pending origin

cases, a selection of closed and auxiliary office cases,

related control files, discussions with appropriate personnel

assigned to these cases, and a review of the techniques and

procedures used by this office.

SOLUTIONS

According to Bureau records the San Francisco

Office from July 1, 1968, through September 30, 1970, had

a total of 356 violations of the Federal Bank

Robbery Statute

consisting of 311 robberies, 23 burglaries, and 22 larcenies.

Of these violations 227 robberies, 13 burglaries,

and 14 larcenies for a total

of 254 are solved. During this

• same period, 31 additiona. violations of the statute which

occurred prion to 1/1/68 were also solved.

As of 9/30/70, there are 77 robberies,

3 burglaries,

and 5 larcenies pending unsolved in the San Francisco

Office. Of these, 8 robberies and one larceny occurred

prior

to 7/1/68.

A comparative tabulation of violations

and solutions which occurred during the period of the last

inspection and current inspection are set out below:

Last Inspection Period;

/July, 1968 to July 2, 1969

As reflected in the tabulation above, your

overall solution rate of bank robbery matters since last

inspection has increased 19% which is a very favorable

trend.

This solution rate is indicative of the conscientious

effort made by Agents of the San Francisco Office in this

most important area of the Bureau's responsibilities. You

should insure that all investigative

and supervisory personnel

continue this effort to effect solutions in these cases.

effort inasmuch as experience has shown that as time passes

the solution rate in bank robbery and bank larceny cases

drops drastically.

It is noted all convictions obtained by the

San Francisco Office for bank robbery violations have been

handled in tha U.s. District Court and it is noteworthy

that you nave periected liaison to the point where these

matters are being handled exclusively by the Federal government.

The differences

between your figures and Bureau

figures is accounted for since Bureau figures are as of

-are as of October

september 30, 197016, 19the San Francisco Office figures

Those areas requiring further attention in bank

robbery matters are those consisting of the greatest areas

of population; that is, Berkeley, Oakland, San Jose, and

Headquarters.

In the case of Berkeley, it is suggested that

greater efforts be made to obtain informants connected with

the New Left element inasmuch as this area has the greatest

student®

population in the San Francisco Bay Area and members

of the SiS and other revolutionary groups have indicated a

propensity for violence including bank robbery.

Although the percentage of delinquencies in

any classification

is only one measure of the attention

being given cases in that category, the above tabulation

indicates the comparative delinquency in the bank robbery

matters with the overall office delinquency and the

delinquencies in criminal matters.

It is noted that delinquencies in 91 matters

has been below the office generally in 10 out of the past

15 months.

The 6.2 delinquency and 5.3 delinquency shown

in the chart above appears to be excessive for those months

and all efforts should be made to insure that this type

of delinquency does not recur in 91 matters.

In this

all important category delinquency should be held at an

absolute minimum.

INFORMANTS

At the beginning of the current inspection there

were 17 approved CIs opened and assigned to the Agents on

Bank Robbery Squad in the San Francisco Office.

17 informants have been separately rated in the informant

section of the inspection report (shown in Section 4-H).

The ratings are as follows:

Excellent

Very Good

Good

Fair

Poor

2

• 3

One informant is not being rated in view of

insufficient data to rate and it appears this informant

will be placed in the nature of a source as a result of

this inspection.

You

should give serious

consideration

to giving the informants rated good or fair specific

assignments so that they may become more productive in

the future.

As can be seen from the above tabulation the

informant program handled by the Agents on the Bank

Robbery Squad is in need of improvement.

Agents working

on this squad should be constantly selecting new individuals

for consideration under the informant program and should be

194.

NW 65360 Docld:32989637 Page 343

## Page 344

- 6-

aware of the possibility of developing quality informants

from the Bank Robbery Suspect Program.

Agents handling

bank robbery matters should continue to be leaders within

• the office in this particular category.

The San Francisco Office has a total of 268

ghetto informants, 14 racial informants, and & probationary

racial informants.

This is an excellent pool for obtaining

quality bank robbery information and it should be fully

utilized by your office. You should insure that dissemination

is promptly made for timely contacts of these sources when

the facts of a bank robbery are clear so that full advantage

can be made of any

information they may have while the facts

are still fresh in the mind of those individuals that are

contacted.

BANK RORBERY SUSPECTS

The Bureau has advised all offices of the need

to develop quality informants among known and suspected

armed robbers and burglars and thieves.

The Bank Robbery

Suspect Program has been most effective in developing informants

from among this

element.

Your efforts should be directed

towards developing background information on individuals

previously convicted for bank robberies and bank burglaries

as well as armed robberies.

You should increase your efforts through

continuous intensive coverage of known robbers to

develop suspects or informants especially in view of the

cosmopolitan area ot san t'rancisco and the closeness to the

Los Angeles and Las Vegas criminal elements.

In regard to your suspect program you should

accumulate all possible data concerning their background

and obtain photographs of these individuals as soon as possible

in order that they could be added to your Bank robbery

Album and utilized

during your investigation of bank robberies

in your territory.

ADMINISTRATIVE HANDLING

Review of your files discloses that in general

bank robbery cases and related matters are receiving the

attention they deserve and are generally well administered.

195.

NW 65360 Docld:32989637 Page 344

Procedures being followed by the San Francisco Office

conform to the Bureau rules and regulations in regard

to the prompt notification of the Bureau of a bank robbery

violation and prompt submission of initial

reports within

30 days.

However, it is noted in several instances in

which notes have been

used these notes after being obtained

have not been promptly submitted to the FBI Laboratory.

The need for obtaining and promptly submitting these notes

should be brought to the attention of all the Agents on the

Bank Robbery Squad. The obtaining of these notes and the

prompt submission is necessary in both those cases in which

the subject is unknown as well as those in which the subject -

has been identified.

In view of the number of bank robberies that

have occurred throughout the San Francisco territory

newspapers apparently have shown a reluctance to publicize

photographs of Subjects obtained from surveillance cameras

during the commission of the

robberies.

Efforts should be

made to institute a program in which newspapers can be induced

to publish these photographs throughout the territory

covered by the San Francisco Office shortly after the commission

of a robbery in which a good likeness of the Subject has

been obtained.

EVIDENCE

tout the the one, a sin, o pay at a once enguts

be submitted to the Bureau on the day of the violation or

• as soon

thereafter as possible.

If local authorities have

the original note, copies should be promptly and forwarded

in accordance with existing procedures.

In the absence of

unusual circumstances the initial 30 day report in bank

robbery cases should contain results of the Laboratory

and Identification Division examinations.

In 91-9460 a bank robbery was committed on

10/9/70, and although the Subject was apprehended he had

left a note and this note has

not yet been submitted to the

FBI Laboratory•

In 91-9446 a bank robbery occurred on 10/5/70,

and indications are that the suspect involved in this case

may possibly have been involved in three other, bank robberies.

were not timely submissions of latent prints and/or demand

notes were noted in your files 91-9439, 91-9382, 91-9410,

91-9395. It is essential that personnel of your office

fully comply with existing Bureau procedures relative to the

prompt submission of evidence in bank robbery matters. In

the above instances you: are instructed to immediately submit

demand notes or copies thereof to the Bureau for appropriate

examination.

NCIC

In 91-9410 and 91-9446 the Unknown Subjects

obtained balt money, however, there is no indication that

the serial numbers

of the bait money have been entered

into NCIC.

You should insure that bait money in bank

robberies

is entered into NCIC immediately.

SURVEILLANCE CAMERAS

In approximately 75 to 80% of the bank robberies

In which a photograph was obtained it was of material

assistance

in solving the case.

In addition, where Subject

has

been identified by other means, the photograph was

available as corroborative evidence.

On the other hand, if a bank camera does not

photograph the subject or produces a blurred result because

of poor lighting it is an expense to the bank and of no

practical use toward the solution of the case.

In 91-9460 a surveillance camera had been

installed by the bank, however, it was not activated during

commission of the robbery.

that during clinics conducted by your office, banks are

instructed to insure cameras are in proper working condition,

properly serviced and bank employees are aware of the value

of activating the cameras at the proper time.

BANK ROBBERY CLINICS

It is noted that the San Francisco Office is

conducting frequent Bank Robbery Clinics throughout the

division to give banking institutions instructions

concerning their role in bank robbery investigations

and to create a continued interest among bank officials

to adopt a continuing training program for their

employees.

It is recommended that you continue to give clinics of this

type throughout your territory

and stress the need for

bank officials to become security conscious in connection

with their banking procedures and physical plants.

It is noted as a result of these clinics and

contacts with the bank of Amarica which has over 960 branches

has

produced an excellent training film which is shown

periodically to all new personnel.

Other banks are following

this procedure and this

should assist substantially

in

obtaining good descriptive data of suspects as well

as

reducing the incidents of bank robberies in your division.

As a result of the passing of the Bank Protection

Act of 1968 most of the banks throughout your area have

installed or are in the process of installing cameras

in most of their branches.

Through the wider use of

bank surveillance photographs shortly after the commission

of a robbery it should lead to the identification of

more suspects.

It is noteworthy in an attempt to minimize the

number of bank robberies occurring in the San Francisco

Bay Area

the City of San Francisco has adopted a plan of

encouraging the hiring of law enforcement officers as

tel era during then out on during ven chat they are

past year

this has proved very successful in

apprehending bank robbers, bad check passers, and individuals

attempting to cash stolen

securities.

It has been noted

that even though the robber may not be apprehended

l at the

by these bank tellers, because of their training their

value as witnesses has

been extremely worthwhile.

LEADS IN REPORTS

The leads set out in the initial report in

91-9161 indicate the projected investigation to consist

of reporting results of Laboratory examination, reviewing

State of California All Point Bulletins, maintaining contact

with the San Francisco Police Department and reviewing

solved and unsolved West Coast bank robberies.

This same

type of non-descriptive lead is set out in the second report

in this same case.

Similar non-descriptive leads are set

out in 91-9206 and 91-9419.

Leads of this type are unimaginative and of

little value for the supervisor in evaluating the

he supervisor.

projected investigation or for another Agent in having

such a case r'eassigned to ham. The exppession of such

leads does not represent the investigative potential of

which FBI Agents are capable and of which the San Francisco

Office has shown in its

solution rate.

Leads such as these

are merely passing our investigative responsibility to the

local authorities.

COPIES OF REPORTS

Three copies of the bank robbery report were

designated in 91-7976, 91-9377, 91-9225 and four copies of

the initial report were made in 91-9362, with no apparent

reason shown or explanation made for the extra copy. All

Agents should be reminded that only two copies are made

in bank robbery cases

in the interest of conserving file

space.

When more copies are dictated for a particular need

such as multiple leads in several Resident Agencies the

extra copy should be destroyed and proper notation

made of this fact after its purpose has been served.

CASE SUGGESTIONS

In 91-9395 an unknown white female subject,

approximately 17 or 18 years old robbed the Wells

Fargo

Bank in Berkeley, California.

The Unknown Subject displayed

a note which note has not yet been forwarded to the Bureau.

This note should be immediately sent to the FBI Laboratory.

security informants familiar with the New Left element in

Berkeley should be contacted. Inasmuch as this case

involves a young female it is felt that additional contacts

with neighboring newspapers should be made in order to

have her picture publicized more widely than as heretofore

happened.

Also contact should be made with the Berkeley

Campus Police Department to determine if it would be feasible

to display her photograph to college sources or counsellor:

in an attempt to determine if this Unknown Subject may be

a student at the Berkeley Campus of the University of

California.

In 91-9277 it is noted that the individnal who

robbed this bank as depicted in the surveillance photograph

on July 24, 1970, is of excellent quality. Although this

photograph

photographs appeared in the "Oakland Tribune"

California, 8/3/70, it is believed this is the type of

photograph

that should receive additional newspaper publicity.

It is noted from past contacts with officials of the Bank

of America they plan in the near future to publish in local

newspapers

in the Bay Area a full page ad depicting

; surveillance

photographs in unsolved bank robbery cases.

It is

recommended in contact with the Bank of America officials

that this case be recommended as one that they publish in

such an ad.

In addition, any other circulation that can

be obtained through area newspapers should be utilized

in displaying this photograph.

In 91-8825, 91-9267, and 91-9456, all bank

robberies where good

to excellent quality surveillance

photographs were obtained of the individual robbing the

banks.

This individual was responsible for all three

bank robberies. It is noted this photograph has been

published in surrounding Bay Area newspapers but did not

appear in local San Francisco news media, inasmuch as all

three bank robberies occurred in San Francisco. Two of

these bank robberies were Bank of America banks and

consideration should

be given to having this surveillance

photograph published in the contemplated ad to be placed by

Bank of America officials in San Francisco and Bay Area

newspapers in the near future.

Likewise, consideration

should be given to extending circulation of this photograph

to other news media and appropriate parole officials

and law

agencies in the Bay

Area.

• MISCELLANEOUS

In 91-9427 It Is noted the subject of this

case is also a member of the Students for a Democratic

Society (SDS) and was the Subject of a security matter in

the San Francisco Office.

In 91-9405 the Subject was also the Subject of

a Selective Service case, security matter case and an

Anti-Riot Law case

in the San Francisco Office.

These

examples are cited

in order to show the need at this time

for maintaining informant contacts not only with the

criminal

element but also with security informants throughout

your division. You should be constantly aware that

revolutionaries in this country have publicly stated that

they intend to finance their causes by bank robberies

and/or armed robberies and this emphasizes the need when

descriptions

and photographs are obtained to distribute

these photographs and descriptions throughout all the

personnel in your office.

Agents working security type

cases should be made aware of the need in contacting their

informants to keep in mind that robberies have been committed

by these young revolutionaries in the past and undoubtedly

in the future they will continue to increase.

Comments of Bank Robbery Supervisor BRYON C.

WHEELER and SAC requested.

SUPERVISOR BRYON C. WHEELER?

The comments and

suggestions of the Inspector have been noted and will be

carried out in every instance.

comments of the Inspector have been noted and appropriate

action will be taken to carry out the Inspector

Special Agent and supervisory personnel will be thoroughly

It is noteworthy that since the inspectors

arrived in the san Francisco Office an additional 10 previously

unsolved bank robberies have been solved through the

identification of the perpetrators who have been incarcerated

and are awaiting prosecution.

The San Francisco Office

therefore now has a grand total of old and new

unsolved bank robbery matters in the amount of pending

percentage of solution of bank robbery violations is,

since the date of last inspection, now 79.2 percent.

CRIMINAL INTELLIGENCE PROGRAM AND

INTERSTATE CAMBLING ACTIVITIES

PART A.

GENERAL

1.

The commercial or lucrative type of criminal

activity in the San Francisco Division continues to be

predominantly confined to

the areas as noted below.

Exhaustive and probative investigation and close liaison

with local state and Federal agencies to date has revealed no

evidence of an organized criminal group controlling these

activities lAngan Francisco or Resident Agency territories.

Investigation

contacts

with informants and other sources of

information have failed to reveal the existence of any

organized illegal gambling, loan sharking (Shylocking),

labor racketeering or planned bankruptcy frauds.

A.

Local booknaking involving horse and

sport bets conducted by numerous local

independent bookmakers, some of whom

have established "lay-off" arrangements

among themselves.

B.

Prostitution activity primarily in the

"Tenderloin" section of San Francisco

involving out-of-town businessmen,

tourists, and servicemen with prostitutes,

most of whom are working for unorganized

negro "pimps".

C. Narcotic activity and related crimes

usually involving thefts and frauds near

universities, military installations, and

"hipple" or Bohemian sections of cities

within the division.

This office continues to enjoy an excellent rela-

tionship with the San Francisco Police Department and its

official personnel. Cooperation and excellent relationships

are known to exist between all Resident Agencies and the

local law enforcement agencies in their territories.

No

evidence or information has been made available to this

office to indicate that there is any corcuption in law

enforcement in this division.

As the Bureau is well aware, Mayor JOSEPH LAWRENCE

ALIOTO was the Subject of anti-racketeering investigation

by this office several years ago, however, this matter has

been closed. ALIOTO prior to assuming the position of Mayor

of the City of San Francisco was a prominent and well known

attorney, particularly in the field of anti-trust matters.

He is

known to have been the attorney for TONY LImA, a former

"Boss" of the ICN in San Francisco.

He also represented a

number of other ICN figures and their associates.

prior investigation revealed that the cousin of

ALIOTO's father, JOHN ALIOTO, was the former "Boss" of the

Milwaukee ICN Family. JOHN

ALIOTO attended the inauguration

of Mayor ALIOTO at San Francisco in January 1968.

As a result of an article published in "look"

• magazine, September 23, 1969, linking ALIOTO with many LCN

figures, ALIOTO filed a $12.5 million libel suit against

"Look"

magazine and the authors of this article, RICHARD

CARLSON and LANCE BRISSON.

On May 15, 1970, Federal Judge BRUCE THOMPSON

declared a mistrial in San Francisco on this suit in that

the jury was unable to agree on the key issue of whether

the article linking ALIOTO with the "Mafia" was published

with "malice and reckless disregard for the facts."

jurors told newsmen that the article was deramatory to

ALIOTO and that at least 50 per cent of the 27 points were

indeed untrue.

There was no agreement as to whether the

falsehoods and the article's general claim that ALIOTO was

"enmeshed in a web of alliances" with the "Mafia" represented

"malice and reckless disregard for the facts."

U.S. Supreme

Court has ruled that such a finding is essential to a libel

judgment sought by a public official.

On August 5, 1970, RUDOLPH RAPALE, brother-in-law

of Mayor ALIOTO, filed a 5.2 million libel suit against

This article re

with FRANK BOMPENSIERO, "CAPO", of the Los Angeles Family of

the ICN residing in San Diego to discuss a lard selling

permit in Mexico for a company of which PAPALE was former

On September 5, 1970, it was reported that retrial

San Francisco top level informants currently being

handled consist of four members of the ICN and ssix™ TE

informants in the gambling and related criminal fields.

ICN TE informants and ten PC target. informants report on ICN

activities of the San Francisco and San Jose Families as

well as ICN activities in other divisions.

our other re

informants and our 36 PC target informants regularly report

on matters involving bookmaking, prostitution, pornography

and other criminal matters.

AS

an indication of the level

of our intormant coverage since last inspection, SF 2689-C-TE,

assumed the position of

"Boss" of the san Francisco ICN

Family. These informants due to their positions and locations

have made it possible to obtain top level information necessary

to provide coverage for Items i and 2.

4.

Since last inspection extensive investigation as

well as informant coverage led to the first ITAR conviction

prosecutions ever in the San Francisco Division (see Item 7

below).

Investigation

in the case CARL EZEKIAL ECKSTIN,

ITWI, case developed a "shakedown" by ECKSTIN against local

bookmaker VICIOR ROMOLO.

This matter arose out of the failure

of RoMoLo to pay a bookmaking debt owed ACKStIN. SALVATORE

if he failed to pay the debt. This case is currently

under investigation with the matter being presented to

the Federal Grand Jury at San Francisco for violation

of Title 18, U.S. Code, Section 894, Extortionate Credit

Transaction

Statute.

It should be pointed out that "BILI" BONANNO

and JOSEPH BONANNO, JR. are the sons of JOSEPH BONANNO, SR.,

a "Conmission" member of the ICN in the United States.

The aforementioned Subjects are also involved in

a separate ECT case involving the shakedown and threats to

do bodily harm tO. WILLIAN JOSEPR ELLIS.

This matter is

presently under investigation and will be presented to the

Federal Grand Jury, San Francisco imnediately upon completion

of Grand Jury action in the ECKSTIN ECT case.

Since last inspection investigation has continued

in regard to GUISEPPI CONFORTE,

the reported Vice Lord,

State

of Nevada, who for years

has headed up a major pros-

titution operation. Through extensive investigation and

the placement of SF 3239-C-TE and SF 3369-C, this organization

been completely penetrated identifying his lieutenants

'and scope of operation.

As a result of the above, it has

been

determined that CONFORTE's operation has spread to

of Hawaii being controlled there by one of his top lieutenants,

TOMMY SEALE.

San Francisco has under preparation an affidavit

for a request of a Title 3 electronic surveillance on the

phones utilized by this organization in Honolulu. This Title 3

affidavit has been prepared with the assistance of Departmental

Attorney at San Francisco and who has discussed same with the

organized Crime section, Deparchent of Justice, who has advisec

that upon completion or current investigation in honolulu the

affidavit should be immediately submitted for approval.

As another example of the progress made in the

penetration of the racketeering operation since the last

inspection intormation was received that HARRY JOHN JOHNSON

and ALAN "SUITCASE" FIDLER,: two. Boston "hit men" received a

contract,

reportedly by a printer, to travel to San Francisco

and "straighten somebody out over a union matter."

JOHNSON,

a former resident of San Francisco, is known as a former

associate of JACK GOLDBERGER, top local l'eamster official

and reportedly JIMMY HOFFA's special West Coast representative.

JOHNSON and FIDLER travelled to San Francisco from Boston in

Januasy, 1970 and through surveillance and subseguent intensive

investigation it was determined that they met with one GEORGE

R. DUNCAN, International Representative,

International

typographers union (Iru).

It was determined that shortly

prior to the travel of JOHNSON and FIDLER to the San Francisco

area a strike situation existed at the San Rafael "Independent

Journal" newspaper involving the ITU.

Through cooperation and

Liaison with Local law enforcement, JOHNSON and FIDLER were

arresced near san Rafael, California and found to be in

possession of handguns and mace.

Shortly after the return

Of JONSON and FIDLER to the Boston area, an individual who

had knowledge that they had been given this contract was

found murdered in Boston and on his body were found the names

and telephone numbers of JOHNSON and FIDLER. Through these

efforts the attempt by JOHNSON and FIDLER to perform the

conditions of the contract were thwarted.

In addition, this

matter

is being considered by Departmental Attorney for

possible Federal Grand Jury presentation.

Another example of progress made in the penetratior

in the Isela of Inteldigence and organized crime in this arei

resulted when through information furnished by top echelon

informants revealing the presence of ALAJADENO JAMES FRATIANNO

residing in the San Francisco territory.

Through investigation

and surveillances conducted FRATIANNO was subsequently contacted

and was developed as a top echelon target of this division.

Freguent contacts were conducted with FRATIANNO and extensive

cooperation was obtained from him concerning organized crime.

FRATIANNO was identified as a member of the Los Angeles Family

of the ICN and during August, 1970 was indicted by Federal

Grand Jury convening in San

Francisco for two counts of

violation of Title 18, U.S. Code, Section 894, ECT. Although

presently incarcerated FRATIANNO

is being contacted periodically

as a target in an effort to continue development of his

cooperation.

Increase in penetration of racketeering operations

since last inspection is evidenced by the above examples as

well as the statistical accomplishments reported. hereinafter.

Subsequent to the submission of last inspection

report, through information by top echelon informants this

office, information has been developed that SF 2689-C-TE

has assumed the position of "Boss" of the San Francisco

ICN Family.

SF 2656-PC has reported to the return to the San

Jose area Of STEFANO ZOCCOLI, Consiglieri of the San Jose ICN

Family from Los Angeles where he had been residing for the

past year.

During November 1969, SF 2656-PC reported that

GEORGE ADRAGNA, a member of Western Pennsylvania Family of

the LCN was coming to the San Jose area to live.

subsequently,

SF 2656-PC and SF 2689-C-TE reported that ADRAGNA's membership

had been transferred to the San Jose ICN Family and he is

currently residing in the San Jose area.

Subseguent to the submission of last inspection

report SE 2689-C-TE reported that JAMES FRATIANNO, a member

of the Los Angeles ICN Family had moved into the San Francisco

•area where he remained until August when he commenced servino

a prison sentence executed by the State of California.

During October, 1969, information was received

indicating that JERRY LISNER, major bookmaker, Los Angeles,

california was in contact with JOHN CASTELLI, bookmaker,

Oaklana, California.

The purpose of this contact was for

LISNER to establish

a base of operation, particularly book-

making, for his criminal activities in the San Francisco

area.

Investigation subsequently established that LISNER

and others commenced a bookmaking operation in Alameda and

Contra Costa Counties, East Bay Area, using as its front

A-1 IV Service, Oakland, which is owned by JOHN CASTELLI.

Following extensive investigation in cooperation with the

Oakland Police Department, no evidence was developed to

indicate any violation of Federal statutes. On November 22,

1969, the Oakland and Berkeley, California Police Departments

simultaneously arrested SALVATORE J. BERNICE, JOHN TRAPPS and

two other associates who were engaged in LISNER's bookmaking

operation. These arrests resulted in a breakup in the

entire bookmaking operation and subsequently during

February, 1970 LISNER returned to the Los Angeles,

California area.

In July, 1970, information was made available

For the San Mateo Police Department which led to the arrest

Of WALTER DALY, PAULA DALY and SABRINA DUNN. These indi-

viduals were arrested for prostitution, conspiracy,

maintaining a disorderly house and being an inmate

in a

disorderly house.

These arrests were a

direct result of

informant information and investigation conducted by the

San Francisco Office which revealed no Federal violation

and therefore was referred to local authorities.

This

operation was determined to be a $90,000 a year

call girl seivice and trom this tive other call girl services

were uncoverea, all local in nature in San Francisco.

Intelligence information concerning these operations

haS>

been furnished the San Francisco Police Department and are

PART B:

GAMBLING MATTERS

1. In the San Francisco Division there appears

to be two gambling operators that lead all others in terms

•of handle, volume, coverage, number of accounts, and

number of employees. These operators are CARL EZEKIAL

ECKSTEIN and CHARLES FRANCIS LEAHY, JR., both of whom are

based in San Francisco. While they both handle substantial

individual accounts, ECKSTEIN and LEAHY are primarily

associated with and rely on lessor local bookmakers for

"action."

CARL EZEKIAL ECKSTEIN, age 40 years, has

been

enyageû in gambling activities most of his adult life.

ECKSTEIN was formerly associated with TONY RUIZ and other

San Francisco bookmakers, but in the last year ECKSTEIN

has set up his own independent operation. ECKSTEIN has been

arrested on several occasions on charges of bookmaking but

has never been convicted of this violation.

was convicted for failure to pay Federal wagering tax, which

conviction was subsequently overturned.

Details regarding

his current operation are set forth below in Paragraph 3.

CHARLES FRANCIS LEAHY, JR., a native San Franciscan,

in his middle 40's, has been engaged

in bookmaking

activities

throughout his adult life.

He was convicted in United

States District Court, San Francisco, in 1961 for arrest

on 9/28/60 for violation of Title 26,

Section 7203, U.s.

Code, failure to report and pay wagering tax, and was

sentenced to six months in jail and five years probation.

Subsequent to his incarceration, LEAHY moved to Medfora,

Oregon.. He returned to the San Francisco area in the Spring

of 1969 and resumed his bookmaking activities. During his

absence from San Francisco, his ex-brother-in-law, KENNETH

JOSEPH ZAHND, reportedly handled his, LEAHY's, bookmaking

• operation.

LEAHY was recently arrested by the San Francisco

Police Department on local bookmaking charges and is

currently awaiting trial.

The types of gambling prevalent in the San

Francisco Division are primarily wagering on horse races

and sporting events. In addition, small numbers betting

with a weekly drawing take place usually in the Spanish-

speaking communities.

There are also legal and illegal

card games operating

usually in low-income commercial

neighborhoods. Gambling in the division is conducted by

individual operators who are independent of each other,

except for layoff purposes with respect to bookmaking and

there. are no indications of hoodlum control over any of

these activities.

3.

Concerning the extent of gambling in this

division, bookmakers ECKSTEIN and LEAHY, named in Paragraph

I above, operate in the following manner.

Both are in

daily contact with their accounts located in the Bay area

which include other bookmakers for layoff purposes, split

bookmakers, and numerous individual bettors.

Bets are placed with these operations generally

at locations to which the general public has access, such

as bars, restaurants, coffee shops, and other snall

shops.

The "action" received at these business locations are in

turn called in to a phone spot operated by a bookmaker who

has a gambling relationship with the operator

of the

business.

ECKSTEIN normally operates with six employees,

including two phone men,

a bookkeeper,

a pay & collect man,

and two runners.

The principal bookmakers and

split bookmakers involved in the ECKSTEIN bookmaking

operations are THEODORE CHAIMIS, ALBERT DiGERONIMO, ELBERT

HEDRICK, MANNY PRONGOS, and ALBERT CARLSON.

ECKSTEIN'S

monthly

handle based on informant data, evidence seized by

the San Francisco Police Department auring recent bookmaking

raids, and interviews of bettors is estimated to be approxi-

mately $50,000 for horse bets.

His sports

"action" varies

with the season of the year and bettor interests in particu-

lar sporting events; however, ECKSTEIN's handle for sports

action is estimated

to be $40,000 per month.

Since the last inspection, the San Francisco

Office has developed SF 2661-C-TE, who is a key operator

within the ECKSTEIN bookmaking organization.

SF 3036-PC,

who was targeted at time of last inspection, has been

developed to the point where he furnishes detailed

information on a weekly basis regarding the LEAHY bookmak~

ina organization. This target is a

split bookmaker hanaling

of information furnished by SF 3036-PC and SF 3237-C-TE,

LEAHY was arrested by the San Francisco Police Department

on 8/4/70 on charges of bookmaking and convict in possession

of

a weapon.

SF 3090-PC was targeted at the time of the last

inspection; however, during the past several months, he

has furnished extensive information regarding several

large bookmaking operations.

SF 3387-C was developed since the last inspection

including Oakland, California, and Naval Air Station,

Alameda, California.

The informant's information led to

the arrest and subsequent conviction of the two major

operators within, the organization in United States District

Court, San Francisco.

In addition, based on informant's

information and investigation by this office, there were

two arrests and convictions effected by local authorities,

As a result of extensive investigation in the

ECKSTEIN ITWI case,

a "shakedown" on the part of ECKStEIN

against a local bookmaker was developed.

This investigation

has resulted in two major ECT cases involving non-payment

of bookmaking debts which are currently under investigation

and before the Federal Grand Jury at San Francisco. TO •

date, eight local bookmakers have appeared before the

Federal Grand Jury and others will be called. This has had

a disruptive effect among bookmakers and has created an

atmosphere of distrust.

Pursuant to instructions set forth in Bureau

letter to SAC Albany 1/27/70 regarding gambling investiga-

tions under proposed SB30, a review of gambling cases was

undertaken.

It should be

pointed out that during the past

three years, it has been the policy of the San Francisco

Office to closely follow the activities of local gambling

organizations and/or subjects in an attempt to develop any

indication of a Federal gambling violation.

Per instructions

additional 162 and 165 cases have been opened and investigated.

Specifically since 2/1/70, sixty-three 162 cases and ninety-

eight 165 cases have been opened.

INSPECTOR ARNOLD

C. LARSON:

10/27/70

The following comments

are based on a review of

information of pending

files and interviews

with appropriate personnel:

LA COSA NOSTRA (ICN)

Investigation by your office revealed the existence

of two ICN "families" within your territory.

Membership

within these "families" total 64 individuals. Your

investigation revealed neither "family" is considered to be

very strong and has little or no illegal operations being

conducted on a day to day basis.

One "family" is centered in the San Francisco area

. ana has for the past lew years been headed by James lanca,

an attendee at the Apalachin meeting in 1957.

Lanza has

recently stepped down as boss of the San Francisco "family"

and has been replaced by Toni Lima. Your investigation

reveals that Lima's leadership has not been approved by

You should follow this matter closely

so you will be in a position to know all activities relating

"to this change in position.

The second "family" is centered in the San Jose area

and is headed by boss Joe Cerrito.

This "family" exhibits

little enthusiasm for illegal operations.

You should closely

follow the activities of members of this "family" to insure

that any illegal operations are immediately known to your

office.

Organized Crime

Although prostitution, gambling and narcotic activities

exist within your division, there is no indication from your

investigations that these

operations are controlled by either

the ICN or other organized groups. Your investigations

should be continually pursued with vigor in order that your

office will be aware of any illegal operations within your

division.

This is particularly true in regard to gambling

activities in view ofthe recent passage of Senate Bill 30.

NW 65360 Docld:32989637 Page 379

As you are aware provisions of Senate Bill 30 made it a

Federal crime in certain gambling operations and it will

not be necessary to prove interstate aspects of the

gamoling activity.

It is noted your office has penetrated the ICN

in both San Jose and San Francisco through the

development of member informants. This is very noteworthy

and you are encouraged to make certain that your member

informants are utilized to the best advantage of the Bureau.

. Also, it is noteworthy that you have increased your TE

.coverage from 7 to 10 since the last inspection.

SF 3058-C-TE (San Francisco file 137-4670; Bureau

file 137-17455) was rated fair because of a lack of productivity.

You should follow instructions issued in Bureau letter dated

July 14, 1970 and if this informant is unproductive for four

months

subsequent to the receipt of that letter the informant

should be closed.

Although SF, 2745-C-TE (San Francisco file 137-3456;

Bureau file 137-11174) was rated good, his progress should

be closely followed. Although he is noted to be a member

informant the file indicates he is very sick with varicose

veins and is very old. The majority of information furnished

by this source has been of a nature of past activities and

little present information is being furnished by him.

You

should endeavor to have him furnish more productive recent

informant or give consideration to concentrate on a more

productive source.

A review of your file 137-5207, Bureau file 137-20313

concerning SF 3208-C-TE indicates the

source was last contacted

on June 26, 1970. The file indicates this source sold his

business and left for Los Angeles and this information was

learned by your office on August 13, 1970.

The file also

indicates this TE left the New York area because of being

a victim of a

In view of this information

you should closely follow this informant's activities and

be circumspect in dealing with the informant to prevent

any possible embarrassing situation from arising.

You are encouraged to

continue this

most desirable trend.

SF 2123-PC (San Francisco file 137-4945; Bureau file

137-11841) was rated fair.

This target was opened on April

You

advised that contact is being held in abeyance pending a

surveillance which was conducted by the Oakland Police

Department in early 1970.

In view of the length of time

since this case was opened and the length of time since this

target was contacted he was rated fair.

SF 2630-PC (San Francisco file 137-2967; Bureau file

137-9023) was rated fair.

By letter dated December 10, 1968

the Bureau advised that this target was over two years old

and

that you should

consider deleting within four months if

he was unproductive.

This informant was also rated fair

during the last inspection because of lack of productivity.

The only reason this informant is being classified fair

instead of poor is because information contained in your

letter to the Bureau dated September 18, 1970 wherein your

informant reported information was furnished by a TE to

the effect that the present "boss" of the San Francisco

ICN "family" had been discussing leadership of the San

Francisco LCN

with the target.

You are instructed that

in the event he does not furnish valuable positive information

within 90 days he should be closed and a more

suitable target

developed.

SF 3061-PC (San Francisco file 137-4768; Bureau file

137-17558) was also rated fair.

This target along with the

other two targets rated fair should be closely followed for

of time. In the event they are unproductive they should be

closed.

SF 2582-PC (San Francisco file 137-2690; Bürea file

137-8249) was rated poor and should be closed.

In regard to your PCs, the following specific

instructions are being furnished you:

SF 2656-PC (San Francisco file 137-3086; Bureau file

137-9425) was rated good because of his being close to San

Jose ICN member Dominick Anzalone and Pittsburgh LCN member

George Adragna who recently moved to San Jose.

He is also

close to ICN "recruit" Vito Adragna. It is noted that this

target has been opened Ior a period ot more than one jear

and has been furnishing general rather than any specific

information.

You should encourage this informant to furnish

some specific information concerning these people who he

is close

to in order that he may be retained as a target of

your office.

SF 3318-PC (San Francisco file 137-5545; Bureau file

137-22526) has been a target of your office

since December

26, 1969. Unless your office is in possession of some

specific information to the contrary he should be immediately

interviewed to determine whether he will be cooperative

with your office.

SF 3135-PC (San Francisco file 137-5010; Bureau file

137-19079) was opened on May 17, 1968.

During the two

inspections since he was opened this PC was rated Unsufficient

Data to Rate.

On November 20, 1969 you advised that an

interview of this PC was being held in abeyance pending an

investigation by the Oakland, California Police Department.

The file indicates that that investigation was completed on

August 6, 1970 with your target paying a $125 fine.

August 19, 1970 you advised that interview of the target

was being delayed pending further investigation you are

instructed that this interview should be immediately conducted

in order to determine if this target will be cooperative with

your office.

file indicates

that this target has never been interviewed and you indicate

that contact with the target is being delayed until a more

logical area of vulnerability is developed.

Inasmuch as

this target is over ond jour old it is felt thai sufficient

• information should be developed so that your office might

approach this target to determine if he

will be cooperative

with your office.

• 3192-PC (San Francisco file 137-5016; Bureau file

137-10982) was opened on May 21, 1968.

SF 3110-PC (San

Francisco file 137-2182; Bureau

• file 137-22452) has been

opened

since Decemoer 8, 1969. It would appear that

sufficient time has elapsed in order for your office to

develop background information so that an interview of

these targets can be conducted. You should without further

delay interview these targets to determine if they will be

cooperative and if not you should consider closing and finding

more suitable targets for development.

Information you furnished indicates there are ten

SAs who are working either exclusively or virtually exclusively

on the CIP and IGA program who have not developed TEs.

Although all ten Agents have PCs their progress should be

closely followed to insure their participation in the

development of TEs.

In this regard you may desire to

reiterate provisions of the Manual of Instructions to the

Agents on the program concerning the qualifications of TE

informants.

All Agents are to be reminded that in dealing with

informants, they are to be particularly alert and not

leave themselves open for criticism or false accusations.

The importance of having an alternate contacting Agent

or another Agent along during the course of certain

interviews is advisable in case any compromising situation

is attempted.

With the recent enactment of Senate Bill 30 you

should concentrate on increasing your informant coverage in

the areas covered by this legislation.

Also in regard to

the passage of Senate Bill 30 dealing with gamoling, which

you are aware does not now require interstate activity, you

should not overlook

the utilization of your racial informants

to furnish information to your office concerning gambling

activities.

Other divisions of the Bureau have been

particularly successful in coordinating the information

from racial informants in to the CIP and IGA programs.

Stalisiival Accomplishments -.

According to the information furnished by your office

you have four cases pending prosecution, two of which are

in the 159 (IMRDA-IM) category and two are in the 92

(Anti-Racketeering) category. Only one of these cases is

in the CIP-IGA program.

A review of your files indicates

that in file 179-24 in a case captioned JAMES FRATIANNO,

EXTORTIONATE CREDIT TRANSACTION (ECT), the subject was

indicted under Title 18, Section 894 of the U.S. Code.

Your office was working

the case under Anti-Racketeering

classification and the file was opened after the ECT

indictment.

In regard to the possible statistical accomplishments,

from the above file it would appear the local office of the

United States Attorney will seek indictments under the ECT

statute.

A review of Your

cases in this category reveal only

three Office of Origin cases.

wherein there are shylocking activities among the gamolers

file 165-100 on Kenneth Joseph Zahna, aka; Morris Cooper,

ITWI, indicates the local office of the United States Attorney

appears to be in no rush to seek Grand Jury indictments on

gambling matters.

If the local office of the United States

Attorney will entertain prosecution under ECT and is in

no rush to seek indictments under the gambling statute,

you should review at squad conferences with Agents assignec

to the program provisions of SAC letter 68-46 dated August

20, 1968 wherein provisions of the ECT statute are set forth.

In relation to statistical accomplishments, prior

experience has shown a direct relationship between office

of Origin cases in a particular classification and statistical

accomplishments.

As of September 30, 1970 your monthly

administrative

report reflects the following Office of Origin

cases in the categories enumerated:

A review of the monthly administrative reports since

the last inspection indicates your office of origin cases

has remained fairly constant since the last inspection.

With the increase of manpower on this program and the

addition of informant development since the last inspection

it is anticipated that your office should be in position at

this point to begin to show results in regard to the

statistical accomplishment phase of this program.

Supervision And Manpower

The CIP and IGA program is supervised by Supervisor

Charles N. Hiner.

Discussions with Supervisor Hiner and

personnel

assigned to the program indicate a very enthusiastic

approach to the problems involved in this program.

236.

NW 65360 Docld:32989637 Page 385

Immediately prior to the last inspection, by letter

May 29, 1970 captioned "CRIMINAI. INTELLIGENCE PROGRAM,

ASSIGNMENT OF ADDITIONAL MANPOWER," you advised the Bureau

of the addition of ten Agents to be assigned exclusively

to this program.

Your success since that time has been

noted by the addition of one conviction in 1970 vs. 1969.

Also you have added three TEs to the program and seven

additional PCs. This is to your credit and you are encouraged

to continue this favorable trend.

However, the collection

of intelligence information, though very important, is only

one phase of this program.

The other phase of the program

which must receive close supervision and personal attention

is the obtaining of convictions to fulfill the Bureau's

responsibility toward statistical accomplishments.

In regard to statistical accomplishments, other

divisions of the Bureau have been very successful in

the utilization of Title 3. The utilization of Title 3

requires extensive use vi manpower and if the title 3 you

are presently awaiting approval is approved you should

Judiciously use manpower in the operation of the Title 3

In regard to the utilization of manpower, it is

imperative that all Agents assigned to this program show

the necessary zeal to accomplish the desired results of

intelligence information and statistical accomplishments.

In the event any Agents assigned to the program fail to

show the necessary enthusiasm consideration should be given

to the reassignment of those Agents to other squads.

Administration And Files

were not completed although the informant files have been

opened for a

considerable period of time.

There were four instances wherein you were instructed

during the last inspection to complete the pink sheet and

although 14 months have passed since last inspection these

pink sheets nave not been completed.

While failure to

complete the pink sheet when instructed does not necessarily

indicate an Agent's enthusiasm in working this program, it

does not show the desired attitude. These four instances

are as follows:

Dissemination

•Your office has been very successful in obtaining

favorable results in dissemination of information to local

law enforcement agencies concerning local violations

developed during the investigation. You are encouraged

to continue this

favorable trend; however, you should

bear in mina that vioiaiions ihai weie strictly locui in

nature previously may now be covered by the recent enactment

of Senate Bill 30.

Those which are determined to be Federal

violations, of course, should be prosecuted in federal

court.

New Legislation

A review of your files indicates you have complied

with Bureau letter dated January 2l, 197, concerning the

then proposed Senate Bill 30.

You should closely follow

guidelines formulated by the

Bureau in regard to this

new legislation in order that your office will be abreast

of the latest information so that the Bureau's

responsibilities

in the organized crime field can be fulfilled.

Observations and Instructions

(1) Provisions of Title 3, the Extortionate Credit

I Transaction statute and of the Manual of Instructions

concerning the qualification of TEs should be reiterated

to all Agents on the program at squad conferences.

(2) You should stress to all Agents on the program

the necessity of developing quality TEs.

239.

(3) You should stress the necessity of proper

utilization of Title 3 installations as other field divisions

have been very successful in this regard in obtaining a

backlog of potential statistical accomplishments.

(4) You should concentrate on quality cases which

have prosecutive potential which will obtain the desired

statistical accomplishments.

(5) You should keep abreast of policy in regard to

new Senate Bill 30 so that the Bureau's responsibility in

this regard can be fulfilled.

SELECTIVE SERVICE MATTERS

4-M-5

INSPECTOR ARNOC. LARSON:

The following 'comments,

observations, recommendations

and instructions are being made after an in-depth review of

a representative number of your Selective Service Act matter

cases and administrative files along with conversations with

supervisory and Agent personnel and review of the answers to

questions in a separate yellow (4-M-5):

The San Francisco area is a

haven to draft dodgers and this undesirable situation will

not be reversed until we make this area unattractive for

"bums, ""hippies," and members of white and black extremist

groups who come

to San Francisco in order to avoid the draft.

Several obstacles must be surmounted in order to reverse this

undesirable situation.

The indifferent attitude that the

judges have displayed

to date must be reversed towards a

tough handling of Selective Service Act violators.

Supervisory

and

• Agent personnel muct

maintain an aggressive attitudc and

continue to be a leader in streamlining processing procedures

by the United States Attorney's Office and various Selective

Service Boards to insure that these violators are promptly

prosecuted in the courts.

Every technique available to the

Bureau should be used

to

get the judges, United States

Attorney and public riled up about this ridiculous situation.

Aggravated violators should be put in jail.

There are 2,983 "hippie-type"

communes in the San Francisco Division comprising in excess

of 20,000 population.

1,050 of these communes

are located in

the Berkeley and Oakland areas comprising in excess of110,000

population and 43 communes are known to be violently oriented.

Your office has eight subjects who have committed selective

Service Act violations that are members of white and black

extremist groups.

Every effort should be made to take these

individuals out ofcirculation by placing them in jail.

Information concerning their activities with extremist groups

should be furnished to the probation officers so that they

can so inform the judges in their presentencing report. All

Agents handling Racial Matters and

Selective Service Act

matters should be periodically reminded to be on the alert

These should be promptly discussed with the

United States Attorney for expeditious handling.

There are several reasons

why the draft dodgers come to this area to beat the draft,

however, the six most important reasons are as follows:

1. Nationwide:publicity during the last

three years concerning San Francisco

being a haven for draft dodgers.

2.

The apathetic attitude of the United

States District Judges:

So Investigations have developed strong

indications that there is a loosely

, organized: movement by registrants

to deliberately crowd the court calendars

In San Francisco to make the reaching

of any one man as slow as possible.

This will also give the violator the

opportunity of getting the indictment

Many registrants from all over the united States come to the

draft board changed to this area, and after meeting

algrother requirements for induction, refuse to step forward

to be inducted knowing that they will have two years or longer

of freedom due to the slow handling of these cases

bỳ the

Selective Service Board, United States Attorney's Office

and the courts. San Francisco has several cases where the

volations are over two years ola in which no prosecutive

action- has been taken.

• 5.:

NW 65360 Docld:32989637 Page 392

## Page 393

4-M-5

It is evident from the

backlog of cases awaiting trial (414), backlog of cases

awaiting prosecutive action by the Federal Grand Jury

(749) and the fact that these violations are being re-

ceived by your office at the average rate of 175 cases

per month, that something must be done to get these

cases before the courts.

The most aggravated cases should

be singled out and tried first, particularly those indi-

viduals who are members of extremist groups. Experience

has shown that after several subjects

have received rigid

sentences, and a widely publicized trial, that many subjects

enter guilty pleas hoping for lesser sentences by avalding

the Government the expense of a trial.

It is recognized the San

Francisco Division has been most forcefully making every

effort to expedite the handling of these cases, particularly

through the judiciary.

Indications are that the relatively

newly appointed United States Attorney is sympathetic and

receptive to the problem and is making an effort to diminish

the backlog of cases awaiting Grand Jury presentations, but

it is recognized once an indictment is returned, it is then

up to the judiciary to proceed through the final step, to

which they have not been particularly receptive. They have

not responded enthusiastically to handling these matters in

Federal Court.

It is obvious the Federal

Judges in Northern California (San Francisco Division) have

resisted any and all pressures brought to bear upon them

concerning this problem.

In my analysis of this situation,

I have determined that the United States Attorney's Office,

personnel of the FBI, and Selective Service personnel have

all attempted to influence the Judges in handling these

matters more expeditiously to no avail. Furthermore, within

recent months there has been wide-spread nation-wide publicity

relative to their coddling and minimizing this particular

problem.

This apparently has had no effect upon them.

It

would, therefore, appear that the various Federal Judges

will not react to this problem unless

some superior influential

individual or group can forcefully bring this matter to their

attention, particularly if such individual or group is one

which the Federal Judges would respect.

The obvious answer

is the Administrator of the Courts for the Federal Judicial

System in Washington, D.C. and/or Chief Justice of the Supreme

Court, WARREN BURGER.

NW 65360 Docld:32989637 Page 393

You are, therefore, instructed

to suggest to the Bureau that the contents of the letterhead

memorandum setting forth this overall problem be brought to

the attention of the Attorney General with the further sug-

gestion that the Attorney General bring this matter to the

attention of the Administrator of the Courts of the Federal

Judicial System and/or Chief Justice BURGER for his analysis

and information, and the further suggestion he may desire to .

communicate with the Chief Federal Judge in San Francisco

relative to these matters.

SAC, ASAC, Supervisory and

Agent personnel should take advantage of

every opportunity

to personally discuss this aggravated situation with the

United States Attorney, Selective Service Board officials,

SAC contacts and other prominent individuals to get them

riled up about this ridiculous situation. neure that

continuous close liaison is maintained by supervisory and

Agent personnel with United States Attorney's Office and

various local draft board officials to insure that these

cases are promptly processed and prosecuted.

Your office in April, 1969

suggested to the former United States Attorney that arresting

several inductees on the spot might have a favorable effect

upon lowering the rate of refusals at the Oakland Induction

Center. The only objection given by the former United States

Attorney was that the case of the registrant must be presented

to the Federal Grand Jury within two weeks after arrest. Due

to your effective liaison, most of the "bottlenecks" have been

worked out between the Selective Service Board and United

States

Attorney's Office in which these arrests can now be

effected.

You should be alert to members of extremist groups

who will

fail to step forward at the time of their induction

and appropriately arrange with the United States Attorney for

authority to arrest these individuals on the spot.

You should

insure that such arrests are given adequate press

coverage.

Such plans should be brought to the attention of the Bureau

for their consideration in making a national press release,

if warranted.

You must closely coordinate

Selective Service Act cases with Agents handling extremist

groups such as the Black Panther Party, Weatherman, SDS, etc.

These files

should be cross-referenced by appropriate

memoranda.

Statistical Accomplishments and Administrative Handling of Cases

As of 9/30/70, you had 1,873 origin Selective

Service matters (1,799

active and

74 inactive). Between

March and September 1970 you received 1,186 Selective Service

Act matters for investigation, an average of 169 (1,186 - 7)

per month.

As OI 10/23/10, 1,163 Ot the origin cases were

completed. 14y cases are awaiting the United States

Attorney's (USA) prosecutive decision, and 414 cases involve

indictments of subjects and are awaiting trial. The case

load is split about in half between Headquarters City and

Resident Agents.

17 Agents are assigned to Squad 6 who

handle only Selective Service Act (SSA) matters and their

informants.

One Agent has been on extended sick leave.

Approximately 18 Resident Agents spend between 60 to 100%

of their time on Selective Service Act matters.

During

the fiscal year 1970, ending 6/30/70, you recorded 74

convictions and for

the first four months of fiscal year 1971,

ending 9/301?9, you have recorded s convictions.

The procedures followed by your office concerring

the immediate handling of subjects who refuse to step forward

at the Armed Forces Examining and Entrance Station, Oakland,

California, appear to save Agent time and Government expense

and should be continued.

Lt is noted, however, that several

nonths elapse between the time the sublect is interviewed ano

the

time the United States Attorney makes his prosecutive

decision since he insists that the Selective Service file be

processed and forwarded to his office by the State Director of

the Selective Service Board.

You should have Headquarters

city Agents continue close liaison with Selective Service

Boards and the United States

Attorney's

Office to insure that

• these cases receive expeditious processing and are presented to

the Federal Grand Jury at an early date.

Current administrative procedures being followed in

these refusal type cases are as follows::

The Induction Officer at the Armed Forces Examining

and Entrance Station, Oakland, California, calls an Oakland

Agent when there is going to be one or more inductees who will

refuse to submit to induction. Inductions are handled on

a Wednesday of each week.

The Special Agent witnesses the

refusal, conducts a short interview of the subject, and in

almost every instance

an admission from the Subject

that he knew he was violating the law and that he had thought

about this matter carefully before refusing to step

forward.

The Agent during this interview obtains the Subject's

current address which is generally different from the one he

furnished the

Selective Service Board.

The Agent places

the Subject on notice as to what probably will occur as to an

indictment, sumnons, etc.

The Subject is cautioned to remain

in touch with his Local Draft Board in orden to avoid beine

a Bureau fugitive.

A case is immediately opened and assigned to the

Oakland Agent who prepares a report.

Information copies of

the report are furnished to the local USA, San Francisco: anc

the field office and the USA covering the Subject's draft

board when located in another division.

It is the USA's

opinion

(San Francisco) that the refusal to step forward takes

precedence over any prior delinquencies and will be handled

by the USA, San Francisco.

Instructions

are given in leads

to Headquarters city Agents and/or

auxiliary offices to

closely follow the Local Board to insure that all pertinent

information regarding

the subject is promptly furnished

to the USA, San Francisco.

In order to streamline the administrative handling

of these matters as well as keeping the Bureau

fully

informed of the activity you are taking in thee matters to

insure prompt prosecutive handling, the following instructions

should be followed:

All refusal cases and all other cases

in which

the investigation is completed should be reassigned to three or

four Headquarters city Agents. These Agents will have

the responsibility of getting

• these cases to the Federal

Grand Jury and on the trial calendar.

Those cases in which

the subject becomes a fugitive should be reassigned to another

case Agent.

At the present time there are 1163 cases pending

prosecutive action.

In order: to eliminate status

• letters and

reports to the Bureau in these

type cases, the following

procedures should be followed.

Memos to the SAC should be placed in individual

files to keep them from becoming delinquent.

When the

Subject is indicted the Bureau should be immediately advised

in

which would include the total number of cases presented

to the Federal Grand Jury during the prior two week period,

identifying each case by San Francisco file number, Bureau

file number and title; the number of cases completed and

awaiting Federal Grand Jury action; number of new cases

received for investigation and general comments concerning

the attitude of the USA's Office and U.S. District Courts

concerning these matters. Also you should comment on any

favorable publicity being given these matters by the local

press media.

In the refusal cases the Bureau should be specifically

advised of the status of a case within five months after the

violation. The USA should be requested to advise of the

prosecutive action he intends to take in each case and this

information reported in the individual file.

It is felt that better liaison can be mainiained

with the USA's Office when only two or three Special Agents

present these cases in a group thereby eliminating 30 to 35

different Agents presenting their cases separately. The

Bureau will be kept advised on a semi-monthly basis of

the activities of your office in getting these SSA matters

through the courts.

The above procedures will eliminate

'the dictation and typing of approximately 750

pages each

month.

There are a sufficient number of SSA cases in

Berkeley, Oakland, San Jose and San Francisco for your

consideration of having a Special Clerk handle the

review of Selective Service Board records. You should

closely review these situations in these particular areas

and if warranted recommendations for hiring Special Clerks.

ADMINISTRATIVE MEMORANDUM

Administrative Handling of Theft

From Interstate Shipment Cases in

the San Francisco Division

INSPECT

FOR ARNOLD C. LARSON: During the course of the

inspection of the San Francisco

Office a review was made of 140 Theft From Interstate Shipment

cases.

Instances were noted wherein Bureau Regulations

'concerning the handling of these cases were not followed. Set

forth below are instances noted during this review:

In the following cases, it was noted the amount

involved appeared to be a minor amount and there appeared to

be no aggravating circumstances concerning these violations.

In some instances concerning the cases which originated at the

san Francisco Airport, it was noted the file indicated there

was a possibility of an individual at the airport being involved

in the theft. However, it is felt it is not necessary to keep

open all the minor

cases in order to determine which, if any,

employees at the airport may be involved.

These cases where

minor amounts are involved are as follows:

15-11816

-11977

-11987

-11988

-11989

-11990

The FBI Handbook, Part III, Chapter 73, Paragraph

F, Page 192, states as follows:

"If complaint is received involving a

minor Theft From Interstate Shipment where there

are no known aggravating or unusual circumstances,

immediately present facts to USA for prosecutive

opinion. If USA will not consider Federal prose-

cution, conduct no investigation, advise complainant,

and, where appropriate, refer matter to law entorce

ment agency having jurisdiction.

Confirm to USA

complainant in writing opinion and action taken. "and

None of the aforomentioned casas reviewed indicate

you are referring minor violations to the U. S. Attorney to

determine if he would prosecute in the event a subject was

identified.

There were numerous incidents wherein information

had been received and the file contained no FD-302s and no

indication that the FD-302s had been dictated.

The following is a list of these files which includes

only those files wherein the case is at least 15 calendar days

old. These files are identified as follows:

3, Paragraph E, Page 31 and following

pages lists the procedures

for entering serial numbers of stolen items into NCiC.

In your file 15-11918 a case was opened wherein the

opening memo states there is no Federal violation involved.

The alleged purpose of@ening this case is because the person

who is responsible for this theft may have been involved in a

theft wherein FBI jurisdiction was apparent.

1) Why, in his supervision of these matters, he

failed to insure that cases involving minor thefts were

2) Why, in his overall supervision, he failed to

detect that FD-302s were not prepared in the aforementioned

cases.

• 3) Why he failed to detect that serial numbers in

letter from

the U.S. Attorney

dated 6/24/69 wherein the

U.S. Attorney advised that they would not undertake prosecution

of minor theft cases.

The letter set the guide as those

cases of value of less than $100.

This office has been

following the interpretation of minor thefts as those having

a value of less than $100.

office that bout all of the airport thefts involvea amounts

in excess of $100. It appears that an average loss at the

an it the arenat there

It was the judgnent of this

airport would average an estimated $250, it being noted that

the airline companies currently are paying up to 5500 per

bag.

Therefore, these cases were not judged to be minor

cases and had not been discussed with the U.S. Attorney as

their value exceeded $100. In following this policy San

Francisco believed that they were in compliance with Section 94

of the Manual

regarding presentation of minor cases to the

uS. Attorney.

In the future this office wil? immediately

present cases of the type cited by the Inspector to the

U.S. Attorney before any investigation is conducted and

will consider suitcase type thefts as minor cases.

2) Submission of FD 302s. Regarding

the fact that I had not detected that FD 302s were not

included in

the 25 files listed by

the Inspector, I would

like to explain that 13 of these files were opened after

September 22 and I had not reviewed any of these files

as yet on tickler and thereby would not have had an

opportunity to detect the fact that the ED 302 was not

listed. The remaining files have not all been available

for review at this time but it is obvious that some of

these files did not have FD 302s prepared:".. promptly.

3)NCIC Entries. Three of the

four files listed where NCIC entries had not been made

had not as yet been reviewed on ticklers since they had been

received in this office.

i dated where were ele enon

One of the four files, 15-11994, re-

flects a suitcase claim

check number which is not suitable

for entry into the NCIC.

4) File 15-11981 was recommended

to be opened by the case Agent as he felt that this

shipment involved personnel and circumstances which

would be logically

worked in connection with other existing

TFIS cases and that it might be a lever for possible

informant development.

The Agent hoped to work this case

even though it was not a Federal violation and obtain an

informant and utilizing the Subject's

complicity in the

case as a possible lever.

It was believed that he

could obtain a criminal informant.

I regret very much that it was

necessary for the Inspector to call to my attention

the

matters referred to in this

administrative write-up. I

will

take the necessary action to insure that minor cases

are immediately presented to the U.S. Attorney, that FD 302s

are immediately prepared, that Ncle numbers be immediately

entered where pertinent so that it will not be necessar

for these matters to be called to my attention again.

SAC ROBERI E. GEBHAROT!

The USA advised this office by

letter dated 7/16/69 that the

FBI should no longer present minor theft cases to the USA's

office and that these cases should be deferred to local

courts.

The once nas in lame me police set men me mee

•USA and has utilized his guideline of $100 as a minor case.

In view of his policy, the office has not been receiving minor

theft cases, as the local business community has been made

aware of the policy of the USA and has not been referring

minor cases to the office.

Occasionally some minor case is received from

someone not aware of the policy of the USA's office in not

prosecuting cases having

à value of less than $100. In the

uture when a complaint is received regarding a minor theft.

he case will be immediately presented to the USA and arter

his declination, the office will advise the complainant and

the USA's office in writing and where appropriate, refer

the

complaint to the local law enforcement agency having jurisdiction

over the violation.

This procedure will de in line with the

requirements in the Manual of Inspection, Section 94.

ADDENDUM

INSPECTOR Abs

c.

LARSON: In regard to your answer to this

write-up, the following is

pointed out to you:

1. Your answer implies the inspector indicated that

all suitcase-type thefts are minor thefts.

This is completely

inaccurate as each case, whether it be a

suitcase or otherwise,

has to be judged on the

merits of the individual case.

In

the review of 140 cases there was not one single instance

wherein the United States Attorney had been consulted to

determine if the case was a minor amount and he would not

entertain prosecution even if the subject were identified.

2.

Concerning the submissions of FD-302's to the

file, the following is a tabulation of cases over two months

old in which no FD-302 is in the file:

FILE NUMBER

DATE OPENED

15-11918

Although the remainder of the 25 files pointed out to

you did not contain FD-302's and

the files had not come

up on ticklers for your revlew, it is apparent with this

number of files without FD-302's the Agents are not receiving

adequate instructions in conferences concerning proper

preparing of FD-302's in TFIS cases.

3. Although it was pointed out to you wherein

NCIC entries on serial numbers had not come up for adminis-

trative review, it is

apparent that several Agents on your

squad have not been properly instructed in the necessity

of immediately entering serial numbers into NCIC. It shoula

not be necessary for you to have to remind Agents on your

squad on a periodic file review of the necessity of entering

serial numbers into NCIC.

They should not wait an extended

period of time to enter these numbers in NCIC, but the serial

numbers should be entered immediately after they are obtained.

4.

File 15-11981 was of a purely local nature and

should have been worked out of the related Federal violation

case rather than open a

separate TFIS case wherein no

Federal jurisdiction was indicated in the opening serial.

DESTRUCTION OF

CHANNELIZING MEMORANDUM

INSPECTOR

ARNOLD C. LARSON: Manual of Rules and Regulations,

Part II, Section 3, Page 15b,

provides for the procedure to follow in the destruction of

copies of informant channelizing memoranda after the pertinent

information has been incorporated into report form.

While reviewing files during

this inspection, it was noted that copies of channelizing

memoranda are not being destroyed through the use of Form

FD-338 after the pertinent portions of the memoranda have been

incorporated into reports.

In some instances the portions

of the channelizing memoranda pertaining to specific su jects

was uf such minor importance so as to preclude their use in

reports.

As examples, the following files

containing copies of channelizing memoranda which could have

been destroyed after the pertinent portions of the memoranda

had been incorporated into report form:

thoroughly impressed with the importance of utilizing FD-338

on a continuing basis.

This form can be easily executed when

the Agents are actually reviewing files, serial by serial, in

old channelizing memoranda which could have been destroyed at

the time previous reports were prepared. It is suggested when

future reports are prepared in these matters the respective

old channelizing memoranda containing information which had

been incorporated into those previous reports.

During such individual review,

the provisions of Manual of Rules and Regulations, Fart 11,

Improper Administrative Handling of

Security and Racial Informant Files

INSPECTOR ARNOLD C. LARSON: During the inspection of the

San Francisco Office, a review

of files in the 134 and 170 classifications has disclosed a

number of delinquencies in the administrative handling of

these files.

It was observed that security informant reports

are being disseminated by use of the FD-306.

The informant's

true name is included in the report in accordance with

existing Bureau instructions set forth in the Manual of

Instructions, Section 107G,

Page 9, Part 2a9. Some of

these reports also contained the true name of other symbol

number informants. In the latter instances copies of the

reports were channelized to the 134 administrative file

of the informant showing the file number followed by the

symbo. number; however, there was no channelization memoran-

dum for a file containing the true name of either the

informant furnishing the information or the other informant

mentioned in the report.

Due to the fact copies of the

reports are not being designated

for a file under the

true name of the informants, the identities of all

informants mentioned in the

to anyone reviewing the 134 file or any of the 100 case

files to which copies of the reports are channelized.

It is essential that the identities of all

informants be kept on a need to know basis and that they

, be afforded maximum security. In order to avoid the

possibility of disclosing the identities of informants

through your channelization procedures, 100 dead files

should be opened under the true name.of all informants in

your office and copies of reports reflecting their true

names should be channelized to these files.

In addition

security to the informant, this

procedure will alleviate the necessity fr designating

copies of the reports to the informant's 134 administra-

tive Illes and thus avoid placing unnecessary intormation

the 100 case files for informants should be destroyed in

accordance with instructions set forth in the Manual of

Rules and Regulations, Part II, Section 3, Page 15,

Part m2.

With respect to racial informants it was noted

that the name of the informant is placed on the pink

sheet (FD-377) where it is only necessary to show the

serial number where his name appears in the file. It

was further observed

that in many instances reports of

both security and racial informants are not being properly

authenticated.

Bureau instructions are that the informant's

code name should appear immediately below the last line

of the report rather than at the bottom of the page.

addition,

there were several instances of failure to

indicate on the FD-306 the date that the report was

authenticated by the informants.

Examples of the above delinquencies are located

in the following files:

134-3251

134-2376

134-1834

134-11

134-1046

As indicated from the above it is apparent that

there is a real need for all personnel conducting these

investigations to change their administrative handling

of informants and information received from them.

INFORMANT CONTACTS

INSPECTOR ARNOID C. LARSON:

Manual of Rules and Regula~

tions, Volume 4, Section 107,

page 6 (4a), captioned "Contacts by Agents," sets forth

instructions regarding the contacting of security informants.

It points out except in espionage and foreign nationality

matters where freguency of contact is dependent on circum-

stances, informant should be contacted as often as necessary,

but at least one personal contact should be made every two

weeks.

If such frequent contacc cannot be established,

specific Bureau authority should be obtained for the exception

to this requirement..

170-314

mile reviewing files during

this inspection, it was noted that many of the FD-209s con-

tained in the sacurity informants"

files showed distinct

lapses of time beyond the prescribed period of time.

AS

examples, the below-listed cases failed to indicate that the

informant had been contacted in accordance

with the above

requirements. These files are as follows:

134-3784

134-3740

134-4368

134-4243

134-4157

170-576

In view of the

critical need

for quality security informants in the Bureau's operations,

the freguency of contact is important not only to continue

the rapport developed between the Agent and informant, but

to insure the informant is given sufficient assignments to

insure that his potential 'is exploited to the fullest. It

is essential that the FD-209 reflect the proper dates of

contacts in order that the close continuous supervision can

be afforded this important phase of Bureau work.

The above tabulation indicates there has been

a delay in opening cases in addition to the delay in

conducting investigation in these matters.

This is a highly undesirable trend and corrective

action should be immediately instituted to prohibit delays

of this type in this important phase of the Bureau's work.

The Black Panther Party is a violence-prone, black militant

organization and individuals connected or associated with

this group should receive prompt investigative attention.

The FBI Handbook, Part III, page 154D, instructs

that black nationalist extremists represent a threat to the

internal security of the U,S. and the investigative guide-

TREND MEMORANDUM

Delay In Opening And

Investigating Racial

Matters

INSPECTOR ENDED Co LARSON:

A review of a number of

pending files in the 157

classification (racial matters) during the course of: the

current San Francisco inspection disclosed several instances

in which cases have been open for a significant period of time

but fail to disclose any investigative activity. These files

generally pertain to

individuals whose telephone number was

either called or was used to make a collect call to the

Black Panther Party Headquarters in Berkeley and Oakland,

California.

The purpose of the investigation of these

individuals is to determine if they are black militant

extremists, and in addition to evaluate their potential

possible racial informants.

Examples of files

that have been

open for a significant period of time withont investigative

• activity contained therein are as follows:

INSPECTOR/A'C LARSON

During the inspection a

careful evaluation will

be made as to the adequacy of your Agent complement. Tabulations

have been separately requested (work paper 4-L) covering fluctuations

of Agent personnel complement, case load, case closings, and delin-

quency for the past six months and this information should be care-

fully considered by you in preparing your response.

Set forth the Agent complement which was approved at

the time of the last inspection.

Huw many agents have you been able to divert to highor

priority work as a result of streamlining procedures instituted 7/1/70

in ITSMV and Deserter matters?

If you feel your Agent complement is adequate but not

excessive, you should so state. If you have any surplus of Agent per-

sonnel you should specify and explain. If you feel additional Agent

personnel should be assigned to your office, you should so state and

completely justify by tabulations. and other factors which you think

pertinent.

Add any other comments you feel are pertinent and as the

last sentence of your answer set forth your Agent complement as of

close of business on closest Friday to date this inspection commenced.

Refer to Section 6-M of the Inspectors' Manual for instructions as to

inclusion or exclusion of Agents under transfer, resignations, etc.

I have carefully reviewed the detailed study

made and tabulation set forth under 4-L of

the work papers.

The workload in this office,

increased workload

and particularly the important nature of the

steadily increased in the recent past

and there is no indication that this trend will change in the

near future.

Agent complement at the time of the last

Inspection was 229, excluding, of course, the Agents assigned

to the Defense Language Institute, Monterey.

As of 10/16/70,

complement was 256, excluding those at the Language

School. As of 10/16/70, four Agents were

under transfer into

the Division

and one was under transfer out of the Division.

A total of 4-1/2 Agents were diverted to higher priority work

as a result of streamlining procedures instituted 7/1/70 in ITSMV

and beserter matters.

As the Inspector and the Bureau are aware, the

Bay Area of San Francisco has

the graduat potent the or violence

Panther Party is located in Oakland. In addition, there are

seven Black Panther community centers and a large

number of

Black Panther pads

in the San Francisco Bay Area.

In addition to the Black Panther Party, there is

a hard core group of militant, violence-prone New Left organi-

zations and individuals centered in this area.

It is known there

are many persons in the area who are either Weathermen or espouse

the violent, militant doctrine of the Weathermen.

In addition,

there are 262 individuals who have been connected with the

Venceremos Brigade living in this area and, as

the Inspector

and the Bureau are aware, the Revolutionary Union organization

has numerous members in this area.

This office and the present

complement

of personnel have been

and are making every effort

to fulfill its responsibilities with respect to the activities

of these violent militant groups.

Since May, 1970, an additional

17

men have been added to handle these important responsibilities.

It is felt, while we are making headway, one of the prime thrusts

in our investigations

of these violent groups is the

realization

of the absolute necessity to develop live quality informants

within the inner core of such groups so that we can anticipate

their future activities.

As the Inspector and the Bureau are aware, a

russian Consulate will be operational in San Francisco in

the

immediate future.

Already four members of the consulate have

arrived in San Francisco, including the Consul and Vice Consul.

It is known three of these four individuals are KGB agents.

There is

every indication that, while they do not have a specific

physical building as yet,

they

are already conducting business

to a certain degree out of their hotel and apartments. Our

responsibilities in this regard have already increased and, as

soon as a physical building is established, our responsibilities

will increase tremendously.

As indicated previously, this office is making

every possible effort to fulfill its responsibilities with the

present complement of 256 Agents and will continue to do so,

since this office does

recognize the over-all needs of the

Bureau wiih respeci io

the assignment of the Agent personnel.

ADDENDUM

TRAITOR ARONE. LARSON:

During the inspection a careful

evaluation was

made as to the

adequacy of your agent compliment

10/28/70

bearing in mind the case load,

cases closed, delinquencies and types of cases assigned.

It is fully agreed that the San Francisco Office

is the hub of the Black Panther Party operations which

creates potential for violence.

It also has a concentration

of New Left and violence-oriented individuals and is a

center for Selective Service violators:

These along with

your other responsibilities draw: heavily upon your manpower.

Your division has a unique situation with respect

to Selective Service cases.

As of September

30, 1970, your

office

had pending 2,257 cases in this classification.

In

analyzing these it was determined that many of these require

very little investigation and 1,163 are either under indictment

or awaiting prosecutive action

some type.

(A special

write-up has been prepared concerning Selective Service Act

cases for streamlining procedures) In analyzing the Selective

Service case load of i,ill pending cases requiring investigation,

approximately 50 percent are in headquarters city. There

are 16 men assigned to these investigations for an average

case load of 34.4 of cases.

this office in categories other than Selective Service,

a computation was made by eliminating the Selective Service

Act cases and those agents handling (2,178 pending active

apolo ton

and 27 agents as of 9/30/70). It was determined that the

average case load for the remaining agents was 32.5.

With respect to the work load of the individual

squads, the following is called to your attention tor

consideration in diverting personnel to assignments where

manpower is needed:

during this period' she case load remained almost constant

cases in April, 530 in September)

and one agent was added

to the complement.

Squad 5 pending active case load declined from

655 cases to 508 cases or 16

per cent while the agent

complement remained constant.

As will be noted,

the average

case load is approximately 29 and the type of cases handled

on this squad do not appear to be complicated

or involved.

The percentage of cases closed during the period averaged

39 per cent

per month.

squad iu case load was analyzed for the period

from December, 1968, through September, 1970.

The case

load

as of the first date was 692 cases with 16 agents.

At the latter date there were 773 pending active cases with

22 agents:

In addition, it is recommended that maximum

utilization be made of the Special Clerk program to relieve

• Special Agents for higher priority assignments. One specia.

Clerk is recommended for the Berkeley Resident Agency for

record checks.

Special Clerks for checking Selective Service records in view

of your vast volume of cases of this type. Consider Special

Specien

Clerks for complaint duty and monitoring.

You should constantly re-evaluate your manpower

situation and make adjustments where necessary to insure

that the Bureau's interests are being fully carried out.

Divert manpower to priority assignments and make necessary

adjustments through your re-evaluation and realignment to

that the work load is equitably shared, priorities

emphasized and any deficiencies corrected.

Keep the Bureau

tully intormed concerning your manpower and all requests

for additional manpower will be tully and closely scrutinizec

in light of your potential for accomplishments, efficiencies

in administrative and investigation operations

and the

demands placed upon the Bureau through expanded jurisdiction.

INSPECTOR

AVe LARSON

Set forth tabulation of the clerical

complement of your office showing

separately total number of employees assigned to each of following three

categories: "Chief Clerk's Office, " "Stenographic Personnel" and "Clerks

not Available to Chief Clerk's Office, " plus overall total of your clerical

staff. List complete titles and grades involved and in listing Investigative

Clerks indicate whether at headquarters city or if at a Resident Agency, so

identify (see Format page 2). In mentioning resignations or in referring

to employees in the military or on maternity leave, extended sick leave or

special assignment to another division, identify employee by name, title

and grade and state whether such personnel have been replaced and, if so,

whether the overage thus created is to be reduced by attrition.

Describe additional positions established since last inspection and

state whether filling of same was from approved complement or necessitated

hiring additional personnel. In any category where there has been an in-

crease or decrease set forth a specific explanation, including whether au-

.

thorization for increase was based on such things as (1) need to replace

employee on maternity leave or extended sick leave; (2) increased work

load; (3) June overhiring; or (4) transfer in to relocate employee.

Where

there are increases cite Bureau communications authorizing such increases.

Reconcile any differences between your assigned personnel complement

(total clerical employees shown on tabulation) and your "authorized" com-

plement (total clerical employees approved at the last inspection - plus or

minus any changes since authorized by the Bureau).

Third column of the tabulation should include only those vacancies

you have received authority to fill or that you intend seeking authority to

fill.

If you feel your clerical complement is adequate but not excessive,

so state. If you have any surplus of clerical personnel you should specify and

explain. If you feel additional clerical personnel should be assigned to your

office,

so state and completely justify by tabulations and other factors which

you think pertinent.

In line with economy measures, consolidation and

Due to streamlining procedures utilized, such as

to the

letter dated 8/10/70. These positions are deemed essential.

The personnel assigned are adequate and there is no excess.

ADDENDUM

.. INSPECTOR

ARNOLD C. LARSON: At the time of the last Inspection

10/29/70

your clerical complement was

fixed at 168.

This would include

65 1n the Steno Pool and 2.

Since that date there

has been an increase of one

in the number of Clerks not available to the Chief Clerk's

Office. This was due primarily to the increase in the Special

Clerk Program.

It was noted that a request has been made for an

additional 10 Clerks in the Chief Clerk's Office.

This matter

will be considered further at the Bureau and you will be advised

of the results.

It is noted, however,

that you are 6 under your

authorized complement in the

Chief Clerk's Office.

An analysis

of your turnover of personnel in the Chief Clerk's Office during

the past two years reflects that your complement has averaged

6 under authorized strength almost constantly. Every effort

should be made to bring your complement up to strength.

It Is agreed that the present stenographic complement

Also, your complement of

clerks

not available to the Chief Clerk's Office (24) is adequate

but not excessive.

It should be noted, however,

that elsewhere

encouraged to utilize the

for higher priority assignments.

This should be done and it is

believed that any clerks taken

from the Chief Clerk's Office for

this purpose should be replaced.

assigned to a Resident Agency territory or road trip, identify

each. Also advise where these men are presently assigned

- and specifically comment as to their present duties.

4. Identify Agents by name and place of assignment (headquarters -

Resident Agency) who were assigned on a part-time basis on

applicant recruiting. What are their present duties?

5. In the likely event it becomes necessary to partially or fully

Headquarters City plus the Applicant Coordinator.

We also had one agent who spent approximately

50 per cent of his time recruiting, handling

interviews and processing clerical Applicants.

To reinstitute our clerical Applicant

arise, we would recontact our many sources

of clerical Applicants and make known to

them that we are once again actively

recruiting.

This would include sources in

not only Headquarters City but also in the

We would also consider

utilizing Special Agents on a part-time basis,

in both Headquarters City and RAs to meet

the needs of the Bureau.

Public and parochial high schools are our most

productive sources of qualified clerical

Applicants.

Individual assignments have been made throughout

the division designating an agent as a liaison

representative with each public and parochial

high school as well as business schools and

San Francisco had a clerical applicant quota of 16

for the period July, 1969, through May, 1970 (at which time

the quota was removed). During that period, 12 clerical

employees

entered on duty.at the Seat of Government.

Your

quota was met or exceeded during 5 of the ll months. It is

to be noted, however, that since May, 1970, 15 additional

SUGGESTION MEMORANDUM

DESIGNATION OF ROTOR

NUMBER ON FILE JACKET

INSPECTOR ARNOLD

C.

LARSON:

During the inspection of the

San Francisco Office, it has

been observed that several pending files failed to contain

the rotor or desk number on the file cover. In those instances

where the rotor number has been placed on the file cover in ink,

it is often small and hard to read.

To facilitate the routing of pending files by

clerical employees to the eleven rotors throughout the

San Francisco Office, it is suggested that the rotor number

be placed on top of the file jacket with a large stamp. You

should devise a system which would include maintaining a stamp

on each rotor and at the time a new case is opened the rotor

clerk should stamp on top of the file jacket the number of the

rotor which handles the particular pending case.

The adoption of this system would allow not only

employees of the CCO to more expeditiously route pending files

but would also be of assistance to stenographic and other per-

sonnel when they are routing files to the various rotors

throughout the office.

This procedure would specially aid in the routing

of files where the classification is split between two desks

such as the 42-classification.

INSPECTOR

ARNOLD C. LARSON: This is a pending case, opened

on 3/16/67, assigned to SA

GERARD JAMES NORTON of the Richmond, California, Resident

Agency. It is supervised by SA RAY M. ANDRESS.

A review of this file reveals the Subject was de-

clared delinquent by Local Board #30, Richnond, California,

on 319/67, for failure to report for induction on 8/17/66.

The

whereabouts of the subject have been unknown since 3/16/67,

and

considerable investigation has been conducted to locate

nim. InIormation was developed in March, 1970, that subject

was possibly in Canada and

a friend of Subjecti

s mother advised

in september, 1970, that the subject is in Canada, but that nis

mother does not have an address for him.

The subject is re-

ported to telephone his mother on occasions. Other neighbors

and police have reported Subject to be in Canada at the present

time.

In view of the above, the following action should be

promptly initiated in an effort to ascertain the location of

the Subject:

1.

Prepare a letterhead memorandum, in accordance

with instructions set forth in the Manual of Rules and Regu-

lations, Part II,

Section 4, page 14 (2) (a) I and SAC letter

#70-27, dated 5/19/70, in order that information regarding

the Subject may be furnished to the Royal Canadian Mountec

family had moved from

Subject's DD 553 in 12/68 which was prior to subject's

neighbois of suject's parents

are not well acquainted with

the Subject, they are cooperative and a neighborhood source

has been established.

Subject entered military service in 9/66 at San Jose,

California, at which time

he was approximately 20 years of

age.

Since initiation of this investigation, additional past

residences have been developed for Subject's parents at 278

Lassen Avenue, Mountain View, California in 9/63;

620 East

Mauded Avenue,

Sunnyvale, California in 7/68 and 1390 Latham

Street, Mountain View, in 7/68. A

neighbor has indicated

Subject may have a brother but could furnish no specific

information concerning his identity. Attempts to establish

residence at the Latham Street address have been negative.

Mail returned to the U.S. Army addressed to the Latham Street

address indicated a possible residence of Apartment 101, 1617

Pine Street, San Francisco, California.

Investigation has

also indicated past employment for the Subject at Channing

House, Palo Alto, California, for a period not

stated.

In view of the fact Subject had already entered

military service before his parents

SUGGESTION MEMORANDUM

BOND DEFAULT MATTERS

INSPECTOR ARNOLD C. LARSON:

As of 10/1/70, the San Francisco

Office had 48 bond default

matters under investigation.

This volume of cases presents

a fertile field for increased convictions under the Bond

Default classification.

An in depth survey conducted by the Inspection

Division disclosed

that there has been a significant

increase in cases received by the FBI for investigation

subsequent to the passage of the Bail Reform Act of 1966.

This Act liberalized bail and bond procedures in

Federal

cases whereby subjects were

to be considered for release

or their own personal recognizance or unsecurea appearance

bond in contrast to previous procedures which required a

specific bond,

creating an excellent opportunity for us

to achieve statistical

accomplishments.

The ratio of

convictions to the number of cases investigated in bond

default matters is one of the highest of any violation

handled by the Bureau.

One of our offices,

namely San Diego, has been

responsible for the most significant portion of the Bureau's

convictions in bond default matters as a result of effective

liaison with the U: S. Attorney, who felt that an indictment

obtained under bond default was more easily proven than

the substantive offense. When a subject is

apprehended,

the sentence is, in part, influenced by the U. S. Attorney,

who informs the

court the length of time the subject's

apprehension has been sought by the Bureau. A number of

these cases have arisen through charges of narcotics and

smuggling of merchandise and aliens across the border.

Subjects were brought before a magistrate, and rather

than

pleading guilty, subjects obtained a court appointed

attorney and entered

a not guilty plea.

then on either personal recognizance or a minimum bond until

their scheduled appearance.

When the subject failed to

appear in court, a bench warrant was issued, San Diego opened

a case, and usually within 30 days an indictment was secured

under bond default.

Although San Francisco is not a border office,

It 1s a great port of entry, both by sea and air, and many

of the same type cases utilized by San Diego for obtaining

a bond default indictment should be available to San

Francisco.

As you are aware, convictions are becoming more

difficult to obtain because of the court's interpretation

of the law in many classifications.

Bond default matters

present an excellent opportunity to increase your conviction

rate, therefore, it is suggested that through your liaison

with

the U. S. Attorney, point out to him the possibilities

for an increase in convictions under the Bond Default

Statute.

The necessity to establish effective liaison with

the U. S. Attorney in bond default matters was set out in

SAC Letter 70-13 dated 3/17/70.

If an increase in cases and convictions is obtained

as a result of this Suggestion Memorandum, advise the

Bureau by routing slip, attention Inspection Division.

Comments of Supervisor DE JEAN and SAC GEBHARDT

requested.

SUPERVISOR MORRIS M. DE JEAN: Close liaison will continue to

Attorney's office and all avenues

of potential convictions will be

Desk

#9.

On

10/8/70, 1:30 A.M., a bomb which had been placed

in the women's restroom adjacent to a courtroom in the Marin

County Civic Center exploded, causing damage in excess of

$150,000 to the restroom, courtroom #4, and the surrounding

area.

This bombing appeared to coincide with bombings

occurring in the ROTC Building at the university of Washington

in Seattle and the National Guard Armory at Santa Barbara.

These bombings came two days after BERNARDINE DOHRN, speaking

for the weatherman organization, warned of a

"fall offensive"

by that organization.

A member of the night maintenance crew at the Civic

Center advised he noted a white male in his early twenties,

clean cut, normal dress in the area at 10:20 P.M. He also

noted a white female in early twenties in the area

on three

occasions between 7:30 P.M. and 10:30 P.M.

This case received wide-spread publicity because

it followed the recent kidnap and murder of Judge HALEY at

the same Marin County Civic Center.

President NIXON commented

on these bombings at a news conference, indicating his interest

in the matter.

on 9/22/70, during the course of the inspection of

the Sacramento Office, it was recalled that Sacramento Potential

Security Informant (PSI) ALLEN EARI, THOMA furnished informationon or

SA SAMUEL A. MILLER:

The Inspector has requested my

explanation as to why there was

a delayed investigation and/or reporting in this matter.

I am sorry it was

necessary for the Inspector to call this

to my attention.

My investigation failed to identify the

subject, and I have not yet aictated a closing memorandum.

In the future I

will dictate more promptly.

I/SUPERVISOR GLENN A. HARTER: SA MILLER is a very thorough and

experienced all-around, excellent

agent, who has done a very good job in obtaining statistical

accomplishments for this office in criminal matters.

I have

specifically discussed this case with him, and he was

aware

of the fact that it was delinquent. It should be noted that

time has been taken up with the

robberies and leads in two civil rights cases, all of which

were treated as specials, and these laptore are,

in part,

responsible for this delinquency.

It Is regretable that it

was necessary

for the Inspector to bring this delinquency

to the attention of the office, and steps will be taken to

insure that it will not happen again.

• SAC ROBERT E. GEBHAR

I have urged the need for prompt

investigation, which did take

place in this case.

I have also stressed to SA MILLER and

Supervisor HARTER the need for prompt reporting.

Agents' handbook, Part II, Page 12 and 12B,

instructs that at the beginning of an interview with any

known Subject of a Bureau case the Subject be advised of the

name and official identify of the interviewing agent and the

nature of the inquiry.

The fact that the Subject was so

advised is to be

recorded in the opening paragraph of the

on 7/24/69, assigned to SA JEAN G. HUGHES and reassigned

on 12/8/69,

to SA KENNETH W. SHEETS. Case is supervised

by SA ROBERT D. ROBY.

Review of the file indicates the Subject together

with two other Navy deserters had lived in a hippie commune

in the San Jose area during Angust of 1969. Investigation has

determined that he has used narcotics and has associated with

hippie-type individuals until the present time.

During 8/70, investigation was conducted in San

Jose and investigation determined that one JOAN BAUER was

also residing in a hippie fashion and was acquainted with the

Subject of this investigation as well as the other two Navy

deserters.

On 8/13/70, JOAN C. BAUER was interviewed at which

time she stated she

is employed at National Aeronautics

Space Agency (NASA), Ames Research Center, as a secretary

at Moffett Field, a Navy installation.

During the course

of this interview, she stated she was

living with

a male

individual in a common-law relationship.

She had

formerly

considered herself a member of a "family" of hippies

including the Subject and another Navy deserter.

At the

time of interview she advised that the members of this

hippie "family" received mail at her adaress

and the reason

for maintaining the address is to receive food stamps for

this hippie "family" living in a commune style. She stated

their mail at her home and admitted

on occasion taking the

mail to them when she visits the

"family".

This interview was conducted at Moffett Field.

The information concerning BAUER was orally disseminated

to the security Officer, NASA, Ames Research Center, on

8/13/70.

ine Manual of Rules and Regulations, Part 2,

Section 5, Page 7, indicates

that Bureau policy under

Commission all pertinent identifiable; derogatory non-

subversive information relative to employees of the Executive

Branch of the government.

This is normally accomplished by

including such information in letterhead memorandum form

and transmitting same to the Bureau for appropriate dissemination.

INSTRUCTIONS

Immediately handle this matter in accordance with

'Bureau instructions cited above.

EXPLANATIONS REQUESTED

1. SA KENNETH W. SHEETS is requested to explain

why he neglected to forward to the Bureau in letterhead

memorandum form the information developed concerning JOAN C.

BAUER, as required by existing Bureau instructions.

2. Supervisor ROBERT D. ROBY is requested to

explain why, in his over all supervision of this case, heidid

not detect this error as set out

above.

Comments of SAC requested.

SA SHEETS:

JOAN C. BAUER advised at the outset

of the interview on 8/13/70 that she

could consider herself a member of the communal "family",

however, this became a matter of interpretation during the

course of interview and eventually she denied she was a member

of the "family" or commune.

She admitted visiting people

connected with the commune

and associating with them, even to

the extent of allowing some of these individuals to use her

address for the purpose of receiving mail and food stamps.

This matter was discussed at length

•with Security Officer RALPH MAINES and JOHN VAN ETTEN, Head of

Security at NASA, Moffett Field, California. They made no

statement as to what action they intended to take.

I realize now that I should have

also prepared

a letterhead memorandum for dissemination to NASA

Headquarters in Washington, D.C.

I regret not having done-so and

in the future will insure that such matters are prombtly

disseminated.

The case was supervised on the desk of SA GLENN A. HARTER

and was closed on 7/27/70.

BY letter dated 4/27/70, United Airlines Collection

Manager, RICHARD H. GEIMER, San Francisco, made available the

original of three fraudulent checks payable to United Airlines

on the account of KENDALL H. LUTES, Plandome, New York.

TWO

checks were for $50 and one was for

$25. UAL advised they

were forgeries.

GARY EUGENE LEGO was subsequently developed as the

Subject when arrested on 5/8/70 at Newark Airport, Newark,

New Jersey for false pretense and possession of stolen

property.

When arrested he was attempting to purchase an

• airline ticket with credit card of K. H. LUTES. An NCIC

check revealed he was wanted by Lancaster County Sheriff's

Office, Lincoln,

Nebraska.

He was released on 5/11/70

on

$500 bond but failed to appear for a hearing on 5/20/70.

LEGO was subsequently arrested on 6/19/70 in

Minneapolis by local police while in a stolen car. Local

authorities held numerous warrants for LEGO and indicated

that they were going to prosecute him.

The United States

Attorney's Office in Minneapolis declined prosecution on

6/22/70 and on 7/16/70, AUSA, San Francisco, also declined

prosecution in view of

LEGO's incarceration

on local charges

by Minneapolis authorities, and in view of the small amount

of checks passed in the San Francisco area. The case was

subsequently closed on 7/27/70.

• The original checks received from United Airlines

on 4/27/70 have not been returned to the contributor, it

being noted the 1-A envelope containing the 3 checks

they were to be returned. It is further noted that the 3

for inclusion in the National Fraudulent Stolen Check File.

According to Part I, page 4 of the FBI Handbook

all documentary evidence shall be promptly returned to

the persons to whom it belongs upon conclusion of the case.

The file fails to reveal that the local San

Francisco police authorities were informed as to

the check-

passing activities of GARY EUGENE LEGO in their jurisdiction

and that he had been identified as the alleged passer of

the 3 fraudulent checks cashed at UAL in San Francisco.

EXPLANATIONS REQUESTED:

Why he failed to submit the 3 original checks in

this case to the FBI Laboratory for inclusion in the

National Fraudulent Stolen Check File and why the 3 checks

were not returned to the contributor, Uniteâ Airlines, san

declination of the USA's Office on 7/27/70.

Why he failed to contact the San Francisco police

authorities for the purpose of disseminating appropriate

information to them concerning this case for whatever action

deemed necessary.

OF SUPERVISOR GLENN A. HARTER

Why he failed to detect the delinquencies concerning

the submission of the 3 checks to the FBI Laboratory for

SA JOHN A. GARRETT:

SA DONALD L. COFFIN and I

attempted to

interview DAVID CHARLES LIPPMAN in the

Berkeley, California City Jail on April 16,

SA COFFIN

promptly advised LIPPMAN of the identity of the interviewing

Agents

and presented the Waiver of Rights Form (FD-395) to LIPPMAN at

which time he indicated that he would neither sign the waiver

form nor would he consent to be interviewed without his attorney.

It is my recollection that a waiver form was prepared on April

16, 1970, and I cannot account for the fact that this file does

not reflect same in the lA exhibit envelope other than a case was

being opened on the subject and that the waiver form was misplaced

upon submission.

SA,COFFIN, and I inadvertently failed to prepare

an interview log in this matter.

• I regret that these omissions were over-

looked at the time and also that we failed to note that the subject

was advised of the identity of the interviewing Agents and the nature

of the inquiry in the opening paragraph of the FD-302 reporting the

attempted interview of the subject on April 16, 1970.

omiscions of this type do not ecour in the future in any inves.
