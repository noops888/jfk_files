suBJECT: ESTIMATED COST OF PROPOSED
EXPANSION OF..FOREIGN LIAISON”

——

eaae

Please refer to‘ the attached copy of a memorandum
from Mr. Callahan to Mr. Mohr, dated 6/3/71. This memorandum
‘points out that the proposed expansion of foreign liaison
jwoula result in an approximate cost of $1,083,000. In regard
to this matter, I must take what will be an unpopular position;
one which runs counter to the present trend.

\ Frankly, I do not think that what we are getting from
sour foreign liaison offices warrants such a tremendous
jexpenatture. We must face up to the hard realities in this
matter, Specifically, I refer to the fact that, with the
| jexception of one office, we are operating on strictly a liaison
basis in foreign countries. We are not operational; therefore
‘ythe kind of information we receive, in the main, cannot be
considered high quality, firm, positive intelligence data.
his is the kind of data in which the President is interested.

I recognize fully that there will be some who will
disagree with me, but as I follow and understand our foreign 4
liaison operations the more convinced I am that what we «
receive fails into four main categories, i.e., 6
(1) there is information given to us which is in the nature
of gossip;

(2) we receive opinions of native contacts in the countries
jwhere we are, or in Some instances ae te in. those countries,
from other nations; REA 7

{ (3) we receive what might be called "planted" ‘information, : °
{expressly material which our native contacts give to us which

, they want conveyed via the FBI to -.the White House or other
\pertinent high-ranking U.S. officials----information that

\rouia serve the interests of their own countries; and

{(4) lastly, we do from time to time develop information that,

at least to us, appears to be of value, but this is not in
,sufficient quantity to justify the expense of our operations.

The same can be said of data relating to our criminal

Mr. Tolson SECRET

are It is a matter of common sense to conclude that
ire cannot develop hard, high quality, positive intelligence
tl by sending men to these countries only in a liaison capacity.
‘They would have to be operational, with penetration of
‘{icommunications and the development of covert sources in
(sensitive areas. It would take years to actually develop
operationally in foreign countries to the point where the
Vier can be considered to be in depth and of great value,

It has been recommended, among other things, that we
reopen our office in Brazil. Some years ago I strongly recom-
mended closing that office because it was clearly unproductive.
There is no reason to believe now that it would be any more so.

{| tne same is true of other offices.

It seems to me that the time has arrived to take a
very honest, cold, impartial look at our foreign liaison
operations. We should ask ourselves the question, "Would any

r real harm be done this nation if. we did not expand and

it nu ibe t of our current. “Tiaison f£fices were closed, with” the
money “Saved thereby being put’ to Something ioré Worthwhile

i| and the manpower applied to our heavy domestic responsibilities?"

‘ESTIMATED COST OF PROPOSED Cree

EXPANSION OF FOREIGN LIAISON ahi

The Director noted on the attached memorandum from Mr. W.'R.
Wannall to Mr. C. D, Brennan dated 6/28/71: "What is estimated cost of this
if approved?E."- |

’ The peieeed expansion would require the assignment of an
additional 29 employees (15 agents and 14 clerks) to Foreign Liaison. It is
anticipated that we will not ask for additional employees but we expect to take
the number from the 851 employees (500 Agents and 351 clerks) in our fiscal year :
1972 request which begins on 7/1/71. The 29 employees if put on foreign assignment
will cost the Bureau approxina tely $100,000 additional. We have not provided for i
such funds and if the project is undertaken, the funds will have to come from some _
other source in our budget such as equipment. If we keep taking money from our
equipment item we will soon be operating with obsolete equipment. i

The total cost of foreign liaison operations would be increased B |
by approximately $1,083,000 on an annual basis broken down as follows: tose

(1) expansion of existing offices - -$313,680; (2) reopening of former offices=+ ;
$315, 5025 and (3) acai of three new offices --$453,818, aS

te,

This memorandum, with all ticklers attached (including

my own), is_being sent directly to. you. I am doing this in
order to prevent any gossip that might circulate around the
Bureau had I taken the ticklers off and routed them. This will
give you an opportunity to consider the entire matter and decide
at what time you want to release the tickler copies.

As you know, this memorandum is predicated on your state-
ment, written on Mr. Felt's memorandum of 6/10/71 to Mr. Tolson,
which reads: ‘I would like to have from Sullivan a list of
foreign offices he would recommend be closed new,"

This complex subject matter will be handled in three
stages: First, I will discuss the offices to be closed now, or
within the foreseeable future, These relate to the long-established
foreign liaison offices, Second, I will discuss the liaison
offices which were opened during the latter part of 1970.

Third, I will make reference to the proposed expansion of foreign
Tiaison and the proposed opening of additional foreign offices.

FIRST STAGE

MADRID, SPAIN -~
I recommend the closing of this office now. It was re-
opened in june, 1969, Sincé that tine the operational cost

has been $152,952, The Legal Attache's salary is Grade 15, $25,867.
The Legal Attache is Mr. V. V. Kolombatovic, whom I regard as an
outstanding man. However, the work is simply not there and I
question strongly that what we have received is worth the cost

of operating this office.

I believe consideration should be given to transferring
Mr. Kolombatovic to head the office in Copenhagen, where the
Legal Attache is being recalled because of a security violation.

Memorandum to
The Director
Re: FBI, Foreign Liaison Program 7 :

I realize that Mr. R. E. Potocki, Assistant Legal Attache in

Paris, has been recommended %o be the Legal Attache in Copenhagen;
however, if this is cancelled it would mean. moving only Kolombatovic
to Copenhagen, leaving Potocki where he is, thereby keeping expenses
down.

(I am aware that Ambassador Hill asked to have an FBI man
assist hin; that Mr. Hill is a personal friend of President Nixon; and
that it is said he intends to retire soon, If the Bureau wishes to
base its decision on this I have no further comment to’ make relative
to this office.)

HONG KONG -
This office was opened in April, 1966, and since then it
ow cost the Bureau $331,453. Again, I do not think we have in any.
way received value from the office which would even approximate
remotely the cost of this operation. On the other hand, I recognize
| inte Hong Kong is a sensitive area from the standpoint of Chinese

intelligence operations, Therefore, I recommend that either the
present Legal Attache, Dan Grove, be returned to this country for
j obviously failing to make the office productive and a new Legat be
| pput in his place, or the Hong Kong Office be closed now. Mr. Grove
j is in Grade 16, with salary of $29,067.

| BERN, SWITZERLAND -
——~—-—"THIs office was opened in October, 1961, and since then

i it has cost $457,085, Again, I fail to see that the product coming
\ out of this office during the past ten years has in any way equaled
the large expense involved, In view of the fact that the Paris

i Office can cover the situation at Bern, Switzerland, I think the

i unnecessary work in the Bern Offidé~c: can. “be é ye et: se “eliminated and this

area should be covered by Paris, I recommend the “closing of the

BUENOS AIRES -

VIEWS OF MESSRS.
BEAVER, DALBEY AND FELT -

I have read the comments of the above-named men, It
was somewhat more than mildly distressing and saddening to me
to observe the lack of objectivity, originality, and independent
thinking in their remarks, The uniformity and monolithic
character of their thinking constitutes its own rebuttal. While
I am certain it was not the intention of these important Bureau
officials, who occupy unique roles, to create the impression
in the reader's mind that they said what they did because they
thought this was what the Director wanted them to say, neverthe-
less it seems to me this is the impression conveyed.

It has been my experience that the Director certainly
does not want officials of the Bureau to try to guess what he
would approve of, but rather wants men to think a subject-matter
through and give their views, calling "a spade a spade,"* and
“letting the chips fall where they may." The Director is fully
capable of deciding for himself among conflicting viewpoints.
To use any other approach is, I think, to render a disservice
to the Bureau.

This current situation reminds me that a number of years
ago it was pointed out that Inservice training, as it then
existed, was of very little, if any, vaive to our field agents,
All the agents in the field knew this. However, when it was

Re: FBI Foreign Liaison Program , H

|caited to the Director's attention a number of Bureau officials
{went to great lengths to insist that there was nothing wrong
‘with Inservice and that it‘should remain as it existed at the

time. Change was opposed. The Director will recall the results
pf this contrgversy, for there was plenty wrong with Inservice.

t had to be overhauled, and it was at the Director's instructions.

Iam also reminded of a statement attributed to Tom Huxley
which, though uttered years ago, fits the present subject-matter
with rare exactitude, Huxley said that, when faced with a
difficult problem, one should give up all pre-conceived beliefs,
notions, prejudices and desires to please, and sit down with
an open mind before the evidence, and follow wherever it leads,
for otherwise no worthwhile contribution can be made.

I do wish, however, to point out that I think Mr, Felt
made a useful contribution and a most valid observation when he
commented favorably on the Mexico City Office (and I share his
view), and concluded, "However, Mexico City is an operational
office, whereas the others are not, and in my opinion this goes
to the crux of the matter."" Of course it does, and we should
not lose sight of this major and decisive fact, or inundate it
with irrelevant words.

SUMMATION

To sum up, since the offices to which I have alluded
(in the first stage of this memorandum) were opened, we have
spent a total of $2,256,715, as of 6/15/71. It seems to me,
from the standpoint of efficient administration, this money
can be far better spent in the domestic field, where our primary
responsibilities are and where our problems are increasing and
becoming ever more complex. I am sure none of us are wholly
satisfied with the way we are discharging our operational
| responsibilities in all areas of the domestic field. Further,
we would be deluding ourselves if we believed that our Legal
Attache poSitions are not the "plums" of the Bureau. They
carry fine salaries, plus living allowances, opportunities
for foreign travel, et cetera. These positions do not even

‘Memorandum to SHORE.

The Director
Re: FBI Foreign Liaison Program

begin to require, across the board, the heavy pressures and
complex responsibilities which our field office administrators
Shoulder day in and day out. The Legats know this better, it
seems than some of us here at the Bureau, How many Legats
have asked to.return to the field down through the years? And
when a foreign office is opened we are flooded with requests to
go. The “word"t has certainly gotten around, The “plums” are
well identified. ECE

Additionally, the evidence points to the fact that,
because of racial conflict, student and academic revolution,
and possible in Sé in Unemployment, this country is” Kéading
into ever more troubled waters, and the Bureau had better be
fully prepared to cope with the difficulties which lie ahead,
This cannot be done if we spread ourselves too thin and finance
operations which do not give us proper returns for the dollars
spent. We all know that the taxpayers of this country fully
expect that the Bureau will give them the best possible return
for their tax dollar. This is a truth which I think is most

[relevant to some of our foreign operations, and it is a truth
which we ought not to ignore.

In order to keep this memorandum reasonably brief, I
have not gone into all the reasons and into the many details
which I can and will turn to if it is considered necessary. I
| am convinced that the offices I have discussed will not stand up
: mder any honest, impartial, searching, professional analysis,
| from the standpoint of getting back full value for the dollars
' , jspent, as long as these offices are liaison and not operational,
1so, we must be very careful not to mislead the President into
‘thinking we can consistently develop for him, in volume and
| quality, high level, hard, positive intelligence information.
[It cannot be done on a liaison basis.

Lastly, I am hot unmindful of the fact that the Director
pointed out that we could get along quite well without an
expansive domestic liaison section and, therefore, he dissolved
it. Applying the Director's reasoning to foreign liaison, I
think certainly the conclusion is valid that we can at least
reduce it, with benefits to the Bureau,

SUBJECT: EXPANSION ‘OF FOREIGN LIAISON rt
oa eae / Wael am
Pursuant to the, Director’ S request, we have considered
various steps which.could be ‘taken to expand our coverage abroad
in order to augment our development of high-level intelligence of
interest to the White House. There are areas of the world where
political and other developments would be of keen intelligence
interest and we have included some of these although we cannot
expect that any substantial volume of data pertinent to the
Bureau's domestic jurisdiction will be developed. Thus, assignment
of Agents to such areas would be almost exclusively for the
purpose of developing intelligence, We have also prepared an
outline of our present coverage involving 42 Agents and 47 clerks
assigned to 17 foreign offices, This outline reflects the changes
which were made during the expansion effected in December, 1970,
and is attached.

We believe that our coverage can be stepped up in our

[Beirut offices by increasing the complements of our Madrid,
Beirut, Tokyo, London, and Caracas Offices. In addition, offices
formerly operating in Rio de Janeiro, Santo Domingo, and Manila
| gould be reo ened. thereby relieving pressure on Buenos | ‘Aires,
\San Juan, and Hong Kong, which are presently attempting coverage
on @ roadtrip basis. New offices could be opened in Australia,
Southeast Asia, India, and in, the Benelux enelux area. The office in
india, presumably At Wer at New Deihi, w would open an ent open an entirely new area
and give:. us access to information of U. S. interest concerning
India, Pakistan, and Burma. The office in Australia and in
Southeast Asia would also relieve our office at Hong Kong which
presently travels to these areas and. would permit intensification
of coverage in Hong Kong itself by the two Agents currently
assigned, The 2dai trons contemplated above would involve an

expansion of our foreign liaison for the purpose of increasing
our production of high-level intelligence of interest to the
White House, While we now have 17 foreign offices manned by
42 Agents, we suggest, reopening _ ing of. 3 former »ffices? opening
‘of_3_hew offices; and addition of one Agent “éach “to” 5 present
offices. This Would result in” total of 23 offices manned by.

MOCASE (THE BORIS MORROS CASE) ina
Item number one in the material submitted to ‘the
Director by Special Agent (SA) Sam Papich in his memorandum
3/5/70 discusses the case of Boris Morros. (Mocase).

BACKGROUND OF CASE Boris Morros, a Hollywood motion picture
producer, was recruited by Soviet intelligence in 1935, From
1947 to 1957 he was operated as a double agent by: the FBI. This
was an extremely sensitive counterintelligence operation involving
Soviet intelligence activities in the United States in which
\ Morros traveled behind the Iron Curtain for meetings with his
| Soviet principals,

Information obtained by Morros from his Soviet contacts
| _was disseminated to interested agencies, including the Central
| Intelligence Agency, On January 25, 1957, Jack Soble, Myra Soble,
and Jacob Albam were arrested in New York on charges of conspiracy
to commit espionage against the United §tates.

PROBLEM WITH CIA On March 16, 1954, the Bureau disseminated
information received from Boris Norros to heads of the various
intelligence agencies, including,CIA, By letter of March 27, 1954,
Lieutenant General C,. P, Cabell, Acting Director of CIA,
criticized the: information and, in effect, characterized it as
“fabrication or the product of a paper mill," which conclusion

" Cabell stated had been applied to many similar disseminations in
the past from apparently the same source. By letter of April 5,
1954, the Bureau informed CIA that it was believed that no useful
purpose would be served in making any future dissemination to

- CIA of information received from this source.

On April 9, 1954, Mr, Allen Dulles, then Director of
CIA, advised Liaison Agent Papich that he had been looking into the
matter and there was ho question in his mind but that his agency
had acted stupidly in transmitting such a letter to the Bureau,

Memorandum to Mr. C. D, DeLoach

RE: RELATIONSHIPS WITH CIA

oy
1

By letter of April 21, 1954, Mr. Dulles stated that
CIA would appreciate it if the Bureau would kindly continue
to send reports from the source (Morros) which relate
to matters of foreign intelligence, By letter of April 29, 1954,
the Director expressed the opinion that no useful purpose
would be served by disseminating to GIA. information received
from the source in the future.

Nevertheless, memorandum MAME to “AME dated
April 28, 1954, pointed out that when and if the Bureau receives

- information in the Mocase in the future of a type required

by National Security Council Directixeto be furnished to CIA,

it should be carefully evaiuated_and a, decision made at that time
as to the officials and agencies of the’Government to whom it
should be disseminated. The Director noted “OK but before anything
goes to CIA from this souree I want to pass on it. This
restriction does not apply to dissemination to other agencies, H"

Subsequent to the foregoing three disseminations were
made to interested agencies, including CIA, based on information
from Morros during October and December, 1954, and appropriate
dissemination was made thereafter with the Director's approval,

As the time grew near for prosecutive action, the
Department requested the Bureau to check with CIA to see if
Department attorneys could interview a Soviet int elligente

defector then in custody of CIA named WAME
Accordingly, the Director authoxvized an oral briefing of Mr. Dulles
and on 1/8/57 he and RPAHME | 1 of his staff were generally

briefed on the Mocase and the contemplated prosecution. They were
furnished with background data concerning subjects residing in

Memorandum to Mr. C. D. DeLoach
RE: -RELATIONSHIPS WITH CIA

(1) CIA feels it should have been advised much
earlier concerning those aspects of phe- case relating to
CIA employees,

(2) Leads ‘were. given to CIA-at the same time the
case was publicized and, therefore, CIA was handicapped.

(3) The failure to coordinate the French aspects
of the case with CIA permitted the French intelligence
agencics to play a dominant role ini the European
investigation,

(4) CIA fears the Bureau had not told it all there
was to know about the.case that GIA aera have known,

DISPOSAL OF PROBLEM WITH CIA The Bureau took the position
that any necessary investigation looking ‘toward prosecution
in countries where Bureau had a Legal Attache would be
referred by the Legal Attache to the appropriate investigative
agency of that country. In those countries where the Bureau
did not have a Legal Attache, request for investigation would
be channelled through CIA, Because the WAME were in
France, the interrogation of the MAME was handled by
request from the Legal Attache to the French,

MAME during Yorid War II had been with the
Office of Strategic Services and had contacts later with*CIA
personnel. Prior to decision on prosecution we did not
disseminate information regarding the MAME because we
feared the effects of compromise from possible leaks would
‘endanger the life of our source, This was particularly true
in view of CIA's expressed attitude in 1954, Some leads had
been given to CIA over two weeks before the arrests of the
subjects in the United States, .Leads were not given earlier
because of the fear of possible compromise, As far as
coordinating the French aspects of the case were iconcerned,
it is doubted that CIA could have exerted any control over the
French investigation after the French had the information,
There was a distinct difference in this case between
intelligence information and evidence in support of prosecutive
action.

recognition for its contribution in the case, in that it took the
i risk and responsibility of transporting, WAME from peace to the
| U. S. in 1957 after the Bureau declined to become involved in this

transportation; that after a short handling period in the U, S, the

Bureau dropped yAHE |, an alcoholic, because he became a problem
and CIA took the responsibility of safeguarding him, giving the
Bureau free access to him and time to develop leads leading to the
apprehension of Abel; that CIA was responsible for making MAME
mentally and physically capable to testify at the Abel trial; also,
CIA incurred heavy expenses, all for the benefit of the Bureau;
further, the Bureau never thanked ‘CIA for its cooperation nor did i

MAME that WAKE had walked into the American Embassy in

was a Soviet agent in New York since 1952 and gave certain details
to back up his story, He claimed he was ordered back to Moscow and
got "cold feet" in psacé and wanted to cooperate with American
‘officials, He was in a highly emotional state which led CIA to
question his mental’ stability. It was the opinion of ‘
that no steps should be taken to return MAMN& to the U. S, until
the story was substantiated or demolished to reflect his actual

disprove his story. On May 3, 1957, CIA was informed of the
facts cGeveloped-by our investigation and asked what action it
intended to ‘take regarding VAME * return to the U.S, On :
May 9, 1957, C/A advised of a report received from CIA, Lace
revealing that MAME had suffered almost a complete mental
breakdown and that in view of his condition, arrangements were
made by CIA for him to be returned to the U.S. by plane. On
May 10, 1957," MANE was returned to the U.S, in the company of
a CIA agent. On arrival our ilew York Agents were at the airport
to take him over, but because of his emotional stote, he was
confined at the U,S, Marine Hospital iw Staten Island until

May 15, 1957, when he was released to the custody of our Agents,
Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) authorities
arranged for his confinenent in the U/S, Marine Hospital,

Staten Islan, for psychiatric exahination through the U.S.
Public Mealta Service, (Liaison Agent Papich had previously
conferred with an INS official who had stated thet if “ase
condition warranted confinement upon his arrival in the U.S,

an order would have to be issued by the U.S. Public Health
Service).

MAHE and his wife were placed in a midtown hotel
by New York Agents and were under. Bureau control from May 15, 1957,
until June 20, 1957, when they-were taken to their residence in
PLACE _ at their request, All exnenses for their
maintenance were paid by the Bureau, Luring this perioc? wame
and his wife were becoming a problem because of heavy drinking
and irrational behavior. - 8
” .

On June 13, 1957, Abel was located by Bureau Agents when
visiting his studio in Brooklyn, New York, Efforts by Bureau
Agents and the Department to have WAME testify against Abel in a
cviminal prosecution were unavailing, With the Depastment's
concurrence, we arranged for INS authorities to arrest Abel on
dune 21, 1957, on an alien warrant, After Abel's arrest, the
Department continued to raise questions concer ing MAME
willingness to testify in an espionage prosecution against Abel
and requested the Burem to press WAME in that regard. We
took the position that any efforts to induce WAHE to testity
should be made by the Department, as we realized that yame
would undoubtedly want assurances, such as remaining in this
country and financial assistance, and the Department was so
advised, The Department was also advised that ‘the Bureau
would no longer pay NWAME *subsistence and thet other
arrangements would have to be made. In an effort to solicit

WAME cooperation, the Department conferred with Allen
Dulles of CIA to determine if CIA would be willing to sponsor
‘the entry of #vAME into the U.S, under the authority granted
the Director of CIA by law. Dulles indicated a willingness

that dissemination of the allegations to the White House, Attorney General
and Department of State had placed De on the spot because the MWAME

BACKGROUND: ; : i ad
CIA advised that on Date /53 “AME had informed CIA representa-
tives abroad that he had evidence pointing toward. WAME being a

‘communist and active agent, and that yAMEé might shortly be exposed
by the McCarthy Subcommittee of the Senate as the chief of the third great

Subsequently, on 2/ /54, ° : NAME called
the Director from White House about the MAME situation. The
Director advised ‘WAME that he had personally talked to

MAME for two hours the previous day and-had concluded that WAME
was obsessed with the charges he was making and while he appeared
to be a brilliant and well educated man he did not appear to have
specific details.

On the day the Director spoke with MAME , 2/. /54, he
referred VAME to Domestic Intelligence Division where a detailed
interview was conducted_and results incorporated in a page memo~
i randum, copies of which were furnished Attorney General, Governor

‘ Adams, CIA and State Department.

We interviewed #Aye at the specific instructions of the

Attorney General based upon a White House request and dissemination
of interview results to Attorney General and White House was not
only proper but required under the circumstances. CIA and State
Department received results since allegations concerned officials
and operations of those agencies. MANE furnished names of
persons who he said could support his'allegations and we interviewed
them and disseminated results, ‘NAMB of CIA commented
on 3/13/54 that when the yAHE information was first recéived at
that Agency some officials gained the impression FBI was deliberately
collecting and disseminating data solely for the purpose of "hurting"
CIA. WAME said results of interviews and investigation conducted
by Bureau had cléarly demonstrated to CIA officials that FBI was
living by its well-known tradition and reputation of developing
facts and reporting information in an impartial manner, He said
on the previous day all officials, including Dulles, commented the
Bureau was following the MAME case in conformity with its

- well established reputation of getting.all the faets. In view of
this, there is no basis for believing that at this time CIA would
raise any charges of unfair conduct on the part of Bureau in its

RELATIONSHIPS WITH CIA ereeaee
CIA ~ DUTCH INTERESTS IN SOVIET ESPIONAGE ACTIVITY

Item #7 in the material submitted to the Director by.
SA Sam Papich in his memorandum of March 5, 1970, discusses
CIA ~ Dutch Interests in Soviet Espionage Activity. SA Papich
notes that in 1956 the Dutch Internal Security Service (BVD) wanted
to have certain individuals in the U. S, interviewed and approached
CIA to make inquiry at the Burean. When CIA approached us, we
told them to have the Dutch submit the nequest through diplomatic
channels and we subsequently told CIA we would not handle the
interviews for the Dutch, Although CIA accepted this, they felt it
hurt efforts to gather Soviet espionage information in Europe, Our
position was based on failure of the Dutch to deal honestly with us
in the case of MAME . who was involved in collecting
intelligence information at the National Security Agency for a
Dutch official.

BACKGROUND OF THE SITUATION:

This question first arose when a Dutch official approachec
our representatives at the NATO-Special Committee conference in
Paris in May, 1956, and requested Bureau assistance in interviewing

ME. “in the U. S, and to have a Dutch representative
present during the interview. VAME is the widow of MAME
BAME ‘ , who operated an espionage network in Europe prior

to his defection in EAP The Dutch representative said CIA had
interviewed her, but the results were unsatisfactory, He was told
to submit his request through diplomatic channels, In June, a CIA
representative advised SA Papich they were receiving pressure from
the Dutch to have a Dutch representative bring all the material
on the case to the U, S, for the Bureau's use if interviewing
MAM and two others in the U. S., but not to participate in
the interview, In accordance with instructions, SA Papich told
CIA to have the Dutch submit their request through’ diplomatic
ehannels and to include all information in writing, .and that the
Bureau would not deal personally with a Dutch representative. By
memorandum of June 15, 1956, it was reported that MAME
of CIA told SA Papich he was of the very strong opinion that the
Bureau's position made good sense, but other CIA officials felt the
Dutch should be helped in every possible way.

. - . RE: RELATIONSHIPS WITH CIA ’

DISPOSAL OF PROBLEM:

On June 19, 1956, then MAME AWA POSITION —
_and SA Papich met with MAME AYO Positioy
t, and MAME ' of CIA. MAnz asked if the Bureau
would talk to a representative of the Dutch if he came over
and, in lieu of that, would the Bureau accept from CIA information
and leads furnished by the Dutch.,

WVAME pointed out the Bureau's position was very
simple in that the Dutch had been caught short in the MAHE
case when their repreésentativeshad been obtaining highly
classified information from a friendly tovernment ami, before
the FBI even requested to interview the, Dutch representatives
involved, the WAME notified State Department
that if Dutch representatives were to be interviewed, it should
“be done by State Department and not by the FBI. WAHE was

_ told that in view of this, the Bureau notified State Department
that any requests for information from the Dutch to be handled
by the Bureau must be channeled through the State Department.

MAME said that this was a situation created by the

‘Dutch and the Bureau had no intention of altering its position
“and wewould not talk to a Dutch representative and did not
desire, to receive any leads in the MAME case through CIA,

WAME advised that CIA respected the Bureau's position
and had attempted to guide itself accordingly in dealing with
: the Dutch. He said he understood the Bureau's position, which
7 in essence was that the Dutch had made their bed and could
now lie in it. 7

‘LIKELIHOOD OF PROBLEM ARISING -NOW:

| . : It would appear remote that this probiem would
’ arise at this time.

[RECOMMENDED ACTION: © . nnig uy

None. We do not believe, in light of the facts
set forth, that CIA will make anvissue of this matter.

Problem: Papich states we never informed CIA we were receiving

As ample evidence CIA knew we were ‘receiving information from

_it was agreed information might be furnished directly to FBI by
MAME .« provided CIA was advised by “AME of what was given.
FRE | ,Moreover, on 5/7/52 a CIA official requested
‘Bureau's views “regarding validity of information we were receiving
from VAME and asked for our views regarding methdd to be
employed in channeling information from M44 to Bureau,
Significantly, under procedure then, WAME& directed communica-

effort to stay out of dispute, In late 1952, for example, C/A
inquired if Bureau's views regarding dissemination had changed,

He was told they certainly had not and again informed that Bureau's
desire was to receive all information of interest no matter how

(Legats) without advising Central Intelligence Agency (CIA)
or requeSting the Agency to handle the, lead.
. el :

The observations of Special Agent Papich in this
matter are broad and general in nature. ‘His presentation is
hinged upon the premise advanced by the Agency that "internal
security" cannot be separated from "counterintelligence,"
thereby necessitating our advising CIA of requests to our
Legats to have leads covered in foreign countries. The Manual
of Instructions, Section 102, page 23, states CIA's responsibilities
include collection, collation, evaluation, coordination and
dissemination of intelligence information. CIA does not have,
among other things, responsibility for "internal security
functions." .. :

: : ¢
In the absence of unusual situations,. we forward
investigative.leads pertaining to our cases in countries where
we have liaison coverage to the particular Legal Attache
concerned, Through his contacts the Legat arranges for th
necessary investigation and submits the desired information
according to our reporting needs, The Legat coordinates
this activity on a local level. :

request investigation abroad in order to achieve’ maximum coverage,
and to maintain tight control so we can insure that we fulfill

we operated informants’ in Cuba during the period we had a .
Legat Office in Havana and did not ‘coordirfate our operations
with CIA or advise it we had sources there, It was noted that
after Castro came on the scene, approval was granted to turn
certain informants over to CIA, Papich also refers to a
memorandum WHME to WANE » 2/5/60, regarding the
Communist Party of Cuba (CPC) which dealt with the problem

"of whether a Havana source used in an intercept operation

between the Communist Party of Venezuela and the CPC should be
turned over to CIA to obtain complete coverage. We, of course,
had no coverage of Venezuela, Bureau had not advised other
agencies of this source since we did not want Castro to uncover
any operational activities which might embarrass the Bureau,
The entire operation was later turned over to CIA.

CIA began its operations in Havana in 4/47 and in a
letter to the Bureau, 4/28/53, regarding Havana informants,
WAME noted that CIA was not overly cooperative and that,

1 in fact, it was not developing pertinent information. At that
time VA@rve met with the CIA representative in Havana who
admitted he was not getting any information concerning the CPC

‘, and had no plans for any aggressive action in that field. For
this reason it was necessary for us to develop our own coverage.
We instructed y ange to ascertain from the Havana CIA
representative information available to him concerning matters
of interest to the Bureau; however, he was to continue through
informant sources to obtain needed information regarding security
matters which could not be supplied by CIA. Subsequently, our
relations with CIA improved to the point of being described as
excellent in 1958, We think our overall position to-be sound,

the case of WAME : that CIA might eriticize our not
identifying our source,

BACKGROUND OF CASE MAME was the CIA employee assigned to

the PLACE AWD DATE

He became involved with a FoRE/éw girl, and the FofS/6/

INTELUGEYC SERVICE approached him for recruitment, using the

affair with the girl and compromising photographs as leverage to
| .carry out the approach, WAM& reported the approach to his

superiors and was returned to U. S. and ultimately removed from

CIA.
PROBLEM WITH CIA We first learned of this case on 7/9/56
fron WAHE Awd Pasiriev

» Who furnished the information in confidence ,and who
indicated VAHE might have been involved in espionage. “On
7/16/56 MAME AMA Jesit/d , cra, advised
SA Papich that CIA was considering requesting in writing that
the Bureau identify our source. On 7/17/56 SA Papich was advised

}

NAHE » CIA, that Allen Dulles had instructed
that the request not be made.

DISPOSAL OF PROBLEM WITH CIA . This problem never officially
arose in view of the instructions of Mr. Dulles. Bureau files
contain no indication as to whether or not CIA documented this.

RECOMMENDED ACTION: _

None. We do not believe, in light of the facts set
forth, that CIA will make an issue of this matter,

. Director ‘by SA Sam Papich in his memorandum of 3/5/70 discusses
the possible belief of Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) that
the Legal ‘Attache, Phace, had leaked sensitive information
concerning VAHe . SA Papich noted that perhaps CIA
might question whether FBI had pursued investigation in the case
. vigorously enough. Memorandum is to review circumstances under
which information was furnished by CIA to FBI, Legal Attache
inquiries of CIA, P4ace , and the effect of CIA restrictions on
FBI investigations in this case.

In February, 1963, CIA made available information from
MWAHE AVS IDENTIFYING DATA
to the effect that the “FOREE_
Government was planning to engage in clandestine collection of
scientific and technical information in the United States. CIA
insisted information not be made ‘available to other government
agencies and no investigation be conducted which might jeopardize
its source. CIA then made available extensive information from
SEusiTtve Sevrce “s. Analysis of the
7 Source Nafefalrevealed several discrepancies which would have A
.made interview by FBI of VAHE desirable. CIA refused this
request, We made numerous requests to obtain clarifying data to
explain items mentioned in Sevmcé nitiisiniin and CIA failed
to respond.

In March, 1963, CIA furnished informatfon concerning
“WAKE interest in American personnel and installations in AZAce&
This information was made available to Legal Attache, Parscée On

inquiry of CIA personnel infsdc& had been made concerning
one of the individuals previously identified as Aofélév agent
and also requests had been made for certain biographical data
concerning‘other individuals. Legal Attache noted that CIA
personnel in PLAce had indicated they were previously aware
of the MAME ‘case and were impressed with the extreme sensitivity
of the case. We furnished this information to CIA headquarters
and on 5/7/63 CIA referred to the incident and stated that it
- was a matter of serious concern to it, reauesting that any
future dissemination outside Bureau or to the Legal Attache
be coordinated in advance with that Agency. This practice
was Closely followed, The Director observed in January, 1964,
that he thought the whole thing had been imaginary on the part
of CIA which had been played as a sucker by WAME ~~ The
Director added that no more time should be wasted on it, at
least until CIA restrictions were removed, We continued
to attempt to get the restrictions removed without success and
covered outstanding leads,

In September, 1964, an analysis of the case disclosed
that although thirty-eight separate investigations were opened
only three ForEiG¥ agents were uncovered, Original allegations
of EoRElG/ intent to mount an espionage ‘mission in the United States
could not be substantiated, This information, coupled with the
fact that CIA refused to make MAME available to us-for
the purpose of resolving discrepancies, prompted a decision
transmitted by us to CIA on 9/30/64 that we were closing our
investigation in this case. 7

Mr. Papich commented in his memorandum of 3/5/70
CIA never has been satisfied with the efforts made by the
Bureau in this case. Our review indicates our efforts in the

Item Number 19 in the material submitted to the

Director by SA Sam Papich in his memorandum 3/5/70 discusses
the posSible travel of one of our Mexican border informants
to Cuba and whether our not advising CIA of this made us

In October, 1965, we were vitally interested in
determining the location and extent of Cuban guerrilla training
sites being used to prepare Latin American subversives to carry
out revolutions in their home countries. MAME , a Mexican
»national residing in PsaAc& , Mexico, which is within the area
covered by Q008 VANE » had infiltrated Fepésvand Foren

SUBJECT: RELATIONSHEP WITH CENTRAL
INTELLIGENCE AGENCY (CIA)
DISSEMINATION OF CIA INFORMATION
IN A BUREAU MONOGRAPH

Item 20 submitted to the Director by Sam Papich in his
memorandum 3/5/70 mentions the dissemination of a Bureau monograph
dated 5/5/65 and entitled “Communism in the Dominican Republic."
Special Agent (SA) Papich stated that due to the urgency of the
document Bureau did not obtain CIA clearance to include CIA
information in the monograph which was disseminated to interested
agencies, including CIA. According to SA Papich, CIA never
made any protest although it considered our action a violation
of the “third agency rule."

Although the monograph referred to by SA Papich did
contain CIA data, it also set forth highly significant data
obtained by Bureau through our own informants. The CIA data
was biographical in nature and was used in the monograph to
characterize the past, including communist contacts, of key
figures in the Dominican Republic. It was taken from the 1963
CIA Biographical Handbook and CIA telegrams dating back to 1961,
all of ‘which were previously digseminated to the U. S, intelligence.
community by CIA. Nosattempt was made in the monograph to
characterize CIA data as Bureau information and, in fact, this

_ information was attributed to "another Government agency," in
accordance with established procedures, :

The so-called "third agency rule" provides that
classified information originating in a department or agency
will not be disseminated outside the receiving agency without
the permission of the originating agency, However, an exception
to this rule provides that the receiving agency may. disseminate
such data to other members of the U. S. Intelligence Board (USZB),
of which Bureau is a’ member, unless the originating Agency
uses appropriate control markings limiting its data to the
use of the receiving agency only. The CIA data used in the
Bureau monograph had no such control markings and- our monograph
was disseminated to the President, the Attorney General and
USIB members only.

SA Papich has cited two situations. The first

of 1966, identified MANE as a potential scurce of intclligenc:
information of importance to U.S. security; conducted
appropriate background inquiry regarding him and determined
his excellent potential and willingness to furnish intelligence
information to U.S. Government. By memorandum 11/23/66 it was
approved that we contact CIA headquarters through liaison
_..channels to inform CIA that we planned to maintain contact with
WAAME +; that CIA would be furnished the information obtained
- and that we would service CIA requests provided they could be
handled with complete security. SA Papich so informed
MANE of CIA on 11/25/66. “MANE = CIA stated he saw no reason
a FBI could not proceed as we desired and that CIA headquarters
would so inform its representatives in /Psace and P4ace ,
instructing them to give FBI all necessary support in-this

In April, 1965, MAME returned to “Peace and

criminal matters as well as those of interest to U.S. security
in fLace .

Upon MAME *g designation as a highly placed police
official in fPr»nce in 1967, we promptly advised CIA
headquarters through liaison channels of informant's identity.

. We advised CIA that we had utilized M4AE for handling
criminal leads and that he periodically volunteered information
concerning political developments in Peace +. At that time,
10/6/67, it was agreed that Bureau would continue control of
informant and that after each contact with informant by our
road trip Agent, the latter would confer with NAA4E =
Head of CIA operations in Peace (who was present at CIA
headquarters at the meeting) concerning political information
furnished by the intormant. ie were assured of complete CIA
cooperation in this matter, On the occasion of our road trip

bitterly accused our Agent of having lied to him and of having
operated a source in facg _ without CIA's knowledge. He
‘stated that responsibility for the development of security

HARASSHENT OF CIA

Item #23 in the material submitted to the Director by
SA Sam Papich in his memorandum of March 5, 1970, discusses a letter
dated November 15, 1967, from CIA which requested that the Bureau
check telephone toll calls from the home of one WVAME
who was allegedly harassing CIA in the Miami area, JVAME. was
supposedly seeking information concerning CIA's covert operations.
SA Papich states that we told CIA that we would not check the toll
calls on the basis that the information received was not sufficient
to justify investigation within the Bureau's jurisdiction. SA Papick
also states that "CIA accepted our response but there is no doubt
that the Agency characterized our position as a concrete example of
refusal to help a sister agency with a problem relating to the
security of U.S. intelligence operations.”

A review of Bureau files disclosed that a memorandum,
MAME » to VANE , dated November 17, 1967,
was prepared. This memorandum encompassed the above facts and
recommended that CIA Liaison Agent advise CIA that we wowld not |
- check the toll calls as requested. This memorandum and recommendatio:

as an instance CIA could cite as an FBI failure to coordinate with
them in line with National Security Council Directives. «.

MAME reportedly raised questions, indicating FBI
should first reach agreement with CIA, which he said had previously
handled ali relations with Dutch authorities, Papich.says CIA.
Director, Allen Dulles, later expressed disappointment that we
did not contact CIA beforehand but that an agreement satisfactory
to all concerned was eventually worked out. Papich also says that
in late 1959 we gave consideration to establishing a Legat in
Denmark but did not inform CIA-of’our intentions.

In contemplation of the stationing of a’ Legat in Denmark,
Bulet of 12/7/59 instructed Legat,Pa4ce , to broaden lifiison
contacts in Scandinavian countries and told GAT, F44CE to make
exploratory contacts with appropriate authorities in Holland
for the same purpose. Since we had told State by letter of -3/10/55
that we would handle requests for investigations and name checks
for the Dutch only when received through formal State channels,
we advised State of our intention to make exploratory contacts wih
the Dutch regarding regular lidison arrangements, and State
approved. State sent a letter to the U. S. Embassy in Holland
on 12/17/59, advising of the Bureau's intention,’ but it apparently
did not get to “MAME + prior to Legat's trip to Holland,

RELATIONSHIPS WITH CIA ' “|
COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES - AFRICA

Item number 28 in memorandum of 3/5/70 from SA Sam
Papich to the Director, captioned "Cases and/or Situations
Involving Conflict With CIA," states that in April, 1960,
CIA inquired if the Bureau would give any consideration to

-assisting that agency toward developing coverage in Africa by

providing a Negro informant or placing a Negro in the Communist
Party, USA for the purpose of eventually using him in Africa,
His memorandum added that we told that agency the FBI had no
informants available because they were necessary for our own
operations. He claims we took the position since we saw no
benefit to be gained by loaning an informant on a short or

long term basis. He states that CIA could argue that as carly
as 1960 it had foresight to recognize the need for additional
coverage and when it appealed to the Bureau for assistance,

we did not cooperate. He refers to his memorandum dated 4/7/60

concerning this matter captioned "Communist Activities in Africa."

The memorandum referred to discloses that on 4/5/60
2. MAME AWD Pes/Tlon . CIA, Stated

“that communist organizations were rapidly incréasing in strength

on the continent of Africa and “that his agency. found it most
difficult to establish effective penetration, MAME noted that
in this connection it was almost impossible for a white man to
move about Africa and establish a relationship which would enable
him to develop worthwhile sources, He asked-if the Bureau would
consider furnishing one of its Negro informants or developing an
informant in the Communist Party, USA for eventyal use by CIA in
Africa, Papich told “A4é that if the Bureau had a good Negro
informant, we certainly were not interested in having his future
jeopardized nor did we want to lose his production, Papich

added that it undoubtedly would be most difficult to take a Bureau
informant, have him‘travel to Africa under some cover and still

be able to satisfactorily explain such activities to his communist
colleagues without becoming a target of suspicion. WAKE Said
he recognized all this but asked if the Bureau would give |

THE PRESIDENT'S FOREIGN INTELLIGENCE
ADVISORY BOARD AND JOHN MC CONE

Item number 30 in the material submitted to the
Director by SA Sam Papich in his memorandum of March 5, 1970,
discusses a dispute we had with CIA in May, 1963, as a result
of a communication the Bureau sent to the President's Foreign
Intelligence Advisory Board (PFIAB), It was pointed out that
in our communication to PFIAB we attributed certain information
to MeCone, then Director of CIA, concerning the matter of
increasing wire taps on diplomatic establishments. McCone
charged that the information attributed to him was not so

. because he had never made any such statement and he could
prove it. The fact was that the information relating to
McCone had been given us by one of his subordinates who had
indicated the information originated with McCone. McCone
maintained that we should have checked with him before going
on record that any information had originated with him,

A review of the file in this matter discloses’ that
in Awil, 1963, WAMA _ along with Papich had giscussed
with VANE and «VAME of CIA McCone's alleged
position with the PFIAB; that he was in favor of across the
board telephone taps on diplomatic establishments. The
Bureau, of course, wasopposed to this and advised WAHE& that
we would request to make our positon known before the board.
At the conclusion of the meeting in April, 1963, MAWE
specifically asked what he should tell McCone and WAME
told him he should tell McCone exactly what had‘ occurred at
the meeting; that the Bureau was opposed to across the board
wire taps and the Bureau intended to go advise PFIAB.

CIA had some coverage reflecting there were to be troubles
concerning Mr. Nixon's Latin American travels. This letter
also stated as follows:

, “It is significant that information in the indi-

1. That most of the information in our letter to

the quality of CIA's coverage in,Latin America.

There is no dispute as to the source of the informa-
tion which was summarized in our letter to Mr. Nixon, and we
clearly indicated in our letter “that the source was CIA. With
regard to any question being raised as to the quality of
CIA's coverage in Latin America, we merely pointed out to
Mr. Nixon something that was readily discernible to any reader
of the CIA reports - - that is, that the information from CIA
popped up rather suddenly as related to the country and
. Myr, Nixon's arrival. Certainly Mr. Nixon himself, since he
was personally involved in demonstrations directed against
him during his Latin American trip, must have been aware that
advance information from our responsible intelligence agency
(CIA) may have been jacking.

The Bureau's success im handling BAME can be
attributed to the know-how of the SAs of the New York
Office becauseWAMNA is a highly emotional individual
and he had aggravated marital problems, severe pressures
from his many business associates; therefore, it took
a high degree of skill in dealing with this source in

Item number 34 in the material submitted to the

it related to the technical surveillance field. Papich states
CIA exhibited its equipment to us, but for many years we declined
to show any of our devices, with some exceptions. .He states
that CIA never made an official protest but informally indicated
from time to time that the lack of exchange was prejudicial to
Overall intelligence and internal security interests and implied
we were more open with the British in this area than with CIA.
Papich states this situation does not exist today as there is
@ good exchange by the Bureau and CIA,

Our files reveal that through the years CIA has

furnished the Bureau a number of technical devices for our use
or inspection, They have also furnished technical manuals obtained
abroad and briefed us on operational and technical aspects of
some of ther operations abroad. - Laboratory personnel have been
afforded tours and briefings concerning CIA facilities ahd
equipment and in two instances Bureau personnel have been afforded
training at CIA schools. As recently as October, 1969, CIA
afforded a briefing to Bureau personnel concerning S$Sassrivé.

Items number 35 and 36 in the material submitted to the
- Director by SA Sam Papich in his memorandum March 5, 1970, indicatec
CIA has never understood why Bureau will not permit CIA personnel tc
lecture at our schools and CIA was unhappy regarding our attitude
concerning exchange of information in the training field.

: CIA by letter May 19, 1950, requested it be permitted to
discuss training problems with FBI training staff in view of
necessity of its maintaining relations with foreign police and
security agencies, Following recommendations by the Executives
Conference, Bureau advised CIA py Letter May 25, 1950, that we did
not believe FBI training staff could intelligently discuss training
methods with CIA since our staff was not knowledgeable concerning
conditions encountered by CIA in various foreign countries,

: RELATIONSHIPS WITH

CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY f
(POSITIVE INTELLIGENCE)

Item Number 37 in the material submitted to the
Director by Special Agent Sam Papich in his memorandum 3/5/70
discusses CIA criticism which could generate from Agency belief
that Buréau has failed to cooperate and offer necessary assistance
in collection of positive intelligence in the United States.
Memorandum is to deal with specific cases believed by Papich
to evidence lack of cooperation and to briefly comment on policy
of cooperation we have adopted with CIA.

SYNOPSIS:

Mentioned Item by Papich points out CIA belief that
more aggressive action should have been taken in field of
collecting positive intelligence in the United States. Papich
notes Bureau's action in this field, for the most part, has been
restricted to compliance with requests by State Department when
political crises occur in some céuntry. He points out CHA belief
that acquiring needed data would mean increased technical surveil-
lance coverage, development of informants and collection of
cryptographic material. Papich’cites two specific cases occurring
in 1969 where Bureau declined CIA's request for technical coverage,
suggesting to Agency that it make its request diréctly to the
Attorney General. Review of specific cases mentioned sét forth
with Director's comments relatiye thereto being noted. Our
policy of cooperation with CIA most recently delinated to field
by SAC Letter 66-10 (B) - copy attached. SAC letter calls for

guarding our jurisdiction but shows our willingness to cooperate
with CIA.

Memorandum to Mr.?vU. D.-DeLoach
RE: RELATIONSHIPS WITH . . :
CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY 7 ni

DETAILS:

: Papich points out CIA feels there is unexplored
field for acquiring positive intelligence in the United States
but he notes that there has been no law, directive, or executive
order whiclht fixes responsibility for clandestine collection of
such information. He notes we investigate subversives, spies,

and develop penetrations of foreign intelligence services and
that facets of these investigations of violations of United States
laws serve to fulfill a counterintelligence objective referred
to by us as investigations of internal security matters. Papich

- notes, however, that most of our work in the positive intelligence

_field has been restricted to the compliance with requests by
State Department prompted usually by a political crisis occurring
in some foreign country. :

Papich points out CIA feels there is unexplored
field for acquiring positive intelligence requiring use of
vastly increased technical surveillances, informant development
and collection of cryptographic material. According to Papich,
CIA does not feel Bureau has moved aggressively in this area
and CIA has been thwarted in attempts to do much about the
problem. Papich cites two cases WAME : and
: MAME i where CIA requests for technical surveil-
lance were declined by us with the suggestion to CIA that these

“matters should be taken up by that Agency directly with the
Attorney General, ef

MAME headed a PLACE _ firm involved in Atomic Energy
Commission (AEC) work requiring "Top Secret" clearance by ‘AEC,
Our initial investigation was closed when Assistant Attorney
General - Internal_Security Division found that facts did not
justify soliciting “AMé__'s registration as a foreign agent.

In’Spring of ¥S4 sixty-one kilograms of nuclear
material were found to be unaccounted for by the firm headed
by MAKE but subsequent inventories and checking by AEC
revealed this shortage was probably the result of cumulative
process of wasteful production methods over a period of eight
years and'did not justify an unqualified determination of a
diversion of nuclear material on the part of WANE to
unauthorized persons or government. :

CIA, in yéAft became alarmed on receipt of information
of loss of mentioned nuclear material and despite AEC findings
felt it may indicate illegal diversion or at least justification
for reopening investigation, NANE o CIA contacted
the Attorney General directly with his thoughts regarding the
need for additional investigation. Attorney General contacted
Bureau requesting it discuss matter with CIA and determine
advisibility of additional investigation. The Director, in
approving conference with CIA, noted "OK but I doubt advisibility
of getting into this, It Looks, like MAHG& is going around
us to AG as he suspects we would say no."

An intensive investigation of WAM& conducted
during late Y@AA and into Fall of yeah revealed no positive

would produce no legal evidence pertinent to the issue which
prompted CIA's original request but noted he felt reinstituted
audio surveillances of AME would produce positive intelligence
information. He therefore requested reinstitution of this
coverage. ‘The Director's letter to WAKE .. noted that
after careful review it was felt that CIA should take this

matter to the Attorney General,

On October 21, 1969, a CIA official was told by
Special Agent Papich that inthe future CIA should transmit its
requests for technical surveillance coverage in the United States
to the Attorney General. This specifically covered the cases
of AME and WAHE- The Director commented "Right."

Bureau Policy of Cooperation

In 1965 and 1966, recognizing overlapping interests,
changes inherent in faster communication, hysteria to facilitate
international travel and in response to requests from CIA, the
Director approved Bureau attendance at conferences with CIA
regarding that Agency's operational activities in the United States.
On a memorandum reporting the results of the conferences with
CIA, the Director commented "I hope we still don't let our
guard down as CIA has always outsmarted’us because of our
gullibility." .

: ¢

. SAC Letter 66-10 (B) dated 2/15/66 furnished to the
field and Bureau offigials results of the conferences with CIA
and emphasized necessity for protecting Bureau jurisdiction.in
the counterintelligence field. This SAC letter (copy attached)
emphasized there is to be no interference with or infringement
upon our jurisdiction but clearly shows our willingness to
cooperate with CIA in developing positive intelligence in the
United States. In approving this SAC letter, the Director
noted "I hope there is. no 'sneaker' in this. Tie will tell."

There has been no renewed request from CIA for
technical coverage in the cases mentioned above, nor has there
been any indication that such requests have been sent by CIA
to the Attorney General as we suggested. Due to CIA interest
in the past in these matters, we cannot rule out the possibility
the Agency may approach Attorney General for the desired
coverage at some time in the future. :

’ of a positive intelligence nature. This requires Bureau action designed to
’ bring about the necessary coverage. A good example is our involvement
in the development of information relating to the crisis in the Dominican
Republic. From the above you will recognize that there can be ‘gray area
of interest to the Bureau and CIA. It, therefore, has been necessary to
effect adequate coordinating machinery.

The potential for the.development of positive intelligence in this
country is vast and varied. Voluminous positive intelligence is collected
overtly through the review of foreign and domestic publications, interviews
of travelers, arriving aliens, contacts with scientists, et cetera. In this
area there have been no serious issues between the Bureau and CIA.

*

However, in the field of clandestine development of positive
intelligence both agencies have an interest, and there is a necessity fora
clear-cut understanding of jurisdiction and coordination. Particularly is
this true in the development of poSitive intelligence sources who are

| or who are visiting this country on a temporary basis.

For many years ‘he Bureau has had a continuing pro
developing sources in diplomatic installations for the purpose of dischary:
our counterintelligence responsibilities and incidentally for develoyi
positive intelligence information which might assist the Government in
formulating policy. The Bureau, recognizing CIA s need for sources in the
positive intelligence field, has permitted CIA to assess and recruit sources
the United States in a limited manner with the understanding that such activit
are fully coordinated with the Bureau. In January, 1964, CIA established
their Domestic Operations Division (DOD) to conduct such operations in the
United States. and certain Bureau field offices were alerted and furnished
the necessary guidance and instructions. The recent discussions with CIA
resulted in a refinement of the understanding of the ground rules established
‘in January, 19464, : ;

The enclosed ground rules will be applied by the Bureau and CIA
as cases arise. The Bureau position in each matter will be decided at the
Seat of Government. As a general rule, Bureau Headquarters will be informed
by C14 regarding ils interest in an individual or a target. Prior to notification
of CIA regarding our position, the situation will be carefully reviewed at the
Seat of Government. This may often include a request to the field for

observations and recommendations before notice is transmitted to CIA. At
the same time, it is possible that you may be contacted in the field by a
representative of DOD, CIA. If so, you should be guided by the enclosed
ground rules in any discussions, bearing in mind that the approval for any
particular cperational activity is to be made‘at Bureau Headquarters.

You should hoid to the concept that the protection of the internal
security of the United States involves very basic clear-cut responsibilities
of the FBI. This should be kept in mind in each case and in any contacts
which you may have with CIA representatives. ‘There is to be no inierferexce
with or infringement upon our jurisdiction. It is recognized that unfores
developments may create situations not adequately covered by the ground rzies.
You, therefore, should report such matters to the Bureau setting forth
complete details with your recommendations. Although we have been informed
by CIA that the Bureau's jurisdiction and operational interests will not be
interfered with, we cannot discount the results of past experiences stemm
from CIA's operational and organizational deficiencies. We have no reascz to
. believe that there will be a revolutionary change of these conditions. It i
therefore, incumbent upon you to be extremely alert for any breakdown o
adherence to the ground rules. I emphasize that this is an area of activity
which must be closely monitored by each Special Agent in Charge. You
should be certain that your personnel is adequately oriented so that the Bureau
can have the full benefit of any constructive suggestions pertaining to this
entire matter. G

SUBJECT: RELATIONSHIPS WITH CIA (
MISCELLANEOUS ITEMS

Item Number 38 in the material submitted to the
Director by SA Sam Papich in hismemorandum of 3/5/70 serves as
a sort of summary in which SA Papich indicates that he cannot
recall the names of other cases which resulted in CIA displeasure
or criticism, but does cite one instance "early in the 1950's"
in which we disseminated data from a source of unknown reliability
charging Allen Dulles as having been a communist and a spy
while in Europe.

By letter 3/22/52, we informed State and CIA that a
source of unknown reliability had alleged that /PEM7/FS/¥6
. DAYA had been arrested in Hungary in 1947 or
1948 and forced to write a letter to his wife which brought her
to Hungary where she was also arrested. We asked for an
evaluation of the information. MAME memorandum,
4/5/52, states he received a call from Allen Dulles during which
Dulles referred to the letter and said’he was not concerned
about it but wanted ¥AASto look it over. We were subsequently
informed by CIA that Allen Dulles _ Ipéa7riFheywg DATA OW
OTHER JdIVebVAL : Seared had said that
the information concerning Dulles and his wife was without _
| foundation and we promptly told State of this by letter 4/15/52,
i a copy of which was directed to Allen Dulles. KRAE
; “+ memorandum 5/10/52 written by SA Papich reports his discussion
with Dulles concerning this matter. Mr. Dulles asked if the
i original letter could be withdrawn and was told that it appeared
yes that the FBI had already set the records straight but that if he
wished to make an official request, Papich would refer the matter
to the Bureau for consideration, Dulles. immediately replied that
he definitely did not want to make "a big thing" of the letter,
that it was not that important, and that maybe it would be better
to drop the matter., General Smith (then Director of Central

Intelligence) later told Papich that he considered the matter
closed.

SA Papich also alludes to other instances in which
Tora alleged that we had mishandled its information. He has no
ispecifics, however, and states he cannot recall the cases,

Problem: Papich states we never informed CIA we were receiving
inform tion from WAME / which was also of interest to CIA;
and that while it is possible WAM@ 4 had given same data to
CIA, we do not know.

Analysis: WANE | > was financed by CIA during early 19508 (2.¢.,
CIA budgeted $650,000 for M4HE 14° in 1952).(62-77306-60) There
is ample evidence CIA knew we were receiving information from
” MAKE } \. We do know some information was given by WAME / to.
. ' CIA and Bureau jointly. aMG 2, for example, told us of 7
" conference in early 1951 between CIA officials and WAMWE 7. when
it was agreed information might be furnished directly to FBI by
WANE 7 , provided CIA was advised by #446 / of what was given. _
(62~77306-23) Moreover, on 5/7/52 a CIA official requested
Bureau's views regarding validity of information we were receiving
fron MANE | and asked for our views regarding method to be
employed in channeling information from VAM ; to Bureau. | x.
Significantly, under procedure then, WAAME ¢ directed .communica=
tions to CIA with copies to Bureau. CIA was told that as it
_ appeared VANE } Was an appendage of CIA, Bureau was not recom-
-mending any method of dissemination and it was up to CIA to handle
ican (62~77306-25) 1

In the ensuing period, dispute arose between CIA and
WAME / over channeling of information and Bureau-made every
effort to stay out of dispute. In late 1952, for example, Helms
inquired if Bureau's views regarding dissemination chad changed.
He was told they certainly had not and again informed that Bureau's
. desire was to receive all information of interest no matter how

RELATIONSHIPS WITH CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE
AGENCY (CIA)

COMMISSION ON THE ORGANIZATION OF THE

EXECUTIVE BRANCH OF THE GOVERNMENT

(HERBERT HOOVER COMMISSION - 1954)

Item number nine in the material submitted to the
Director by SA Sam Papich in his memorandum 3/5/70 discusses :
the Hoover Commission survey of CIA operations in 1954. According
to Papich, there was talk within CIA that the Bureau had ‘furnished
the names of subversives within CIA to Senator McCarthy.
Senator Joseph R. McCarthy (R«Wisc) was Chairman of the Senate
Investigations Subcommittee. 5

: : General Mark Clark headed the Task Force which
surveyed CIA operations between 9/54 and 6/55. In 10/54, CIA
alleged that the McCarthy Committee was attempting to develop’
information regarding CIA operations. According to the Washington
. Star, 10/1/54, McCarthy said CIA was “one of the worst situations
we have as far as communist infiltration is concerned." He said
he would give his data relative to this matter to Clark's Task

SUBJECT: RELATIONSHIPS WITH CIA
THE PRESIDENT'S FOREIGN INTELLIGENCE
ae ADVISORY BOARD AND JOHN MC CONE

: Item number 30 in the material submitted to the
Director by SA Sam Papich in his memorandum of March 5, 1970,
discusses a dispute we had with CIA in May, 1963, as a result
ofa communication the Bureau sent to the President's. Foreign
Intelligence Advisory Board (PFIAB), ‘It was pointed out that .
in our communication to PFIAB we attributed certain information

aceaet . to McCone, then Director of CIA, concerning the matter of

; increasing wire taps on diplomatic establishments. McCone

; charged that the information attributed to him was not so

: . because he had never made any such statement and he could

H : prove it. The fact was that the information relating to

| McCone had been given us by one of his subordinates who had

indicated the information originated with McCone. McCone
maintained that we should have checked with him before going
on record that any information had originated with him,

A review of the file in this matter discloses that
i in Apil, 1963, Mr. Belmont along. with Papich had qiscussed
i with Richard Helms and James Afigleton of CIA McCone's alleged
li : ’ position with the PFIAB; that he was in favor of across the
a - board telephone taps on diplomatic establishments. The
Bureau, of course, wasopposed to this and advised Helms that
we would request to make our position known before the board,
an At the conclusion of the meeting in April, 1963, Helms
7 . specifically asked what he should tell McCone and Mr. Belmont
a told him he should tell McCone exactly what had‘ occurred at
the meeting; that the Bureau was opposed to across the board
wire taps and the Bureau intended to so advise PFIAB.

RECOMMENDED ACTION:¢ ia

None. We do not believe, in light of the facts set
i forth, that CIA will make an issue of this matter,

Item number 32,in material submitted to the
Director by SA Sam J. Papich in his memorandum 3/5/70
mentions Bureau letter 5/16/58 sent to the then Vice
President Nixon and containing a summary of CIA informa~
tion concerning events in Latin America relating to
Mr. Nixon's trip there during 5/58.

: According to SA Papich, most of the information
.in above letter came from CIA. He commented that this
letter could be interpreted as raising question concerning

it is not known if CIA ever became. aware of the letter.
Papich stated that General Robett ‘Cushman, currently Deputy
Director of CIA, was attached to the then Vice President
Nixon's staff. SA Papich pointed out that CIA, if aware of
above letter, could raise question as to violation of Third
Agency Rule.

source of the information set forth in our letter, The last
paragraph of this letter includes a statement that the
impression gained from a review of CIA reports indicates that
CIA had some coverage.reflecting there were to be troubles
concerning Mr. Nixon's Latin American travels. This letter
also stated as follows:

"It is significant that information in the indi-
vidual countries came to CIA's attention shortly before your
arrival in a particular country. Therefore, there is a
question as to whether or not CIA had coverage in communist
organizations which would -have led to the development of
information concerning communist plans days or weeks ahead of
your visit."

There is no indication in this file regarding
instructions given to prepare our letter of May 16, 1958,
The first paragraph of this letter indicates that the Director
had a discussion with.Mr. Nixon on May 16, 1958, inasmuch as ~-

’ the first sentence of the above letter reads as follows:

"Apropos of our discussion today, there is set
forth information contained in Central Intelligence Agency

- reports received from them on May: 14, 1958."

The data set forth in our May 16, 1958, letter to
Mr. ‘Nixon is contained in a memorandum Mr. R. R. Roach. to
Mr. A. H, Belmont dated May 15, 1958, which was prepared for
the Director's information, The Director noted on this memo-
randum, "Send summary to A, G, H." In accordance with

. instructions, a letter was sent to the then Attorney General
‘under date of May 16, 1958, and this letter contained a summary

of CIA information in the same manner.as-had been sent to

Mr. {Nixon on May 16, 1958, Our letter to the Attorney General,
howgver, did not contain any observations regarding , CIA
coverage in Latin American countries visited by Mr. Nixon and
his party. . 7

/ Our file in this matter (62-88461-150) indicates that

‘on. gune 9, 1958, Colonel Robert Cushman in the office of the

then Vice’ President Nixon contacted the Bureau-at the request

of Mr. Nixon to determine if the contents of a letter from
the Director to Mf. Nixon dated May 16, 1958, regarding

Mr. Nixon's trip to South America could be leaked to the
press. Colonel Cushman's request: was set forth in memorandum
G. A. Nease to Mr. Tolson June 9, 1958, with the recommenda-
tion that Colonel Cushman be advised that if the information
were to be given to the press, it would undoubtedly create a
serious problem as the FBI would then have violated CIA's
confidence since CIA was aware that SA Papich had reviewed
CIA's classified reports and, therefore, this information
should not be given to the press. Both Mr. Tolson and the
Director agreed with the recommendation, and Colonel Cushman
was advised of our decision. It is noted that Colonel Cushman
is identical with the individual who is now Deputy Director
of CIA.

Comments on Remarks in SA Papich Memo 3/5/70

i. That most of the information in our letter to
Mr. Nixon dated May 16, 1958, came from CIA and that this
letter could be interpreted as raising the question concerning
the quality of CIA's foveraee in Latin America.

D
H There is no dispute as to the source of the informa-

tion which was summarized in our letter to Mr. Nixon, ‘and we
clearly indicated in our letter“that the source was CIA. With
regard to any question being raised as to the quality of
CIA'S coverage in Latin America, we merely pointed out to :
Mr. Nixon something that was readily discernible to any reader
of the CIA reports - - that is, that the information from CIA
popped up rather suddenly as related to the country and
Mr. Nixon's arrival, Certainly Mr. Nixon himself, since he
was personally involved in demonstrations directed against
him during his Latin American trip, must have been aware that
advance information from our responsible intelligence agency
(CIA) may have been lacking.

2. We are not aware if CIA became knowledgeable of
our letter to Mr. Nixon dated May 16, 1958. Under ordinary
conditions, we are not aware nor do we seek to identify any CIA

CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY
(POSITIVE INTELLIGENCE)

Item Number 37 in the material submitted to the
Director by Special Agent Sam Papich in his memorandum 3/5/70
discusses CIA criticism which could generate from Agency belief
that Bureau has failed to cooperate and offer necessary assistance -
in collection of positive intelligence in the United States. i
Memorandum is to deal with specific cases believed by Papich
to evidence lack of cooperation and to briefly comment on policy
of cooperation we have adopted with CIA.

SYNOPSIS:

Mentioned Item by Papich points out CIA belief that
more aggressive action should have been taken in field of
collecting positive intelligence in the United States. Papich
notes Bureau's action in this field, for the most part, has been
restricted to compliance with requests by State Department when

‘political crises occur in some country. He points out CIA belief

that acquiring needed data would mean increased technical surveil-
lance coverage, development of informants and collection of
cryptographic material, Papich cites two specific cases occurring
in 1969 where Bureau declined CIA's request for technical coverage,
suggesting to Agency that it make its request directly to the
Attorney General. Review of specific cases mentioned sét forth
with Director's comments relatiye thereto being noted. Our

policy of cooperation with CIA most recently delinated to field

by SAC Letter 66-10 (B) - copy attached. SAC letter calls for
guarding our jurisdiction but shows our willingnéss to ‘cooperate
with CIA.

Memorandum to Mr. C. D. DeLoach
RE: RELATIONSHIPS WITH
CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY

—SECRET—
DETAILS:

Papich points out CIA feels there is unexplored
field for acquiring positive intelligence in the United States
but he notes that there has been no.law, directive, or executive
order which fixes respofsibility for clandestine collection of
such information. He notes we investigate subversives, spies,
and develop penetrations of foreign intelligence services and
that facets of these investigations of violations of United States
laws serve to fulfill a counterintelligence objective referred
to by us as investigations of internal security matters. Papich
notes, however, that most of our work in the positive intelligence
field has been restricted to the compliance with requests by
State Department prompted usually by a political crisis occurring
in some foreign country.

Papich points ouf CIA feels there is unexplored
field for acquiring positive intelligence requiring use of
vastly increased technical surveillances, informant development
and collection of cryptographic material. According to Papich,
CIA does not feel Bureau has moved aggressively in this area
and CIA has been thwarted in-attempts to do much about the
problem. Papich cites two cases (Alfred S. Gonsalves, 10/69 and
Zalman Shapiro, 10/69) where CIA requests for technical surveil-
lance were declined by us with the suggestion to CIA that these
matters should be taken up by that Agency directly with the
Attorney General.

Specific Cases s

CIA advised that Alfred S. Gonsalves, Deputy Permanent
Representative of the Indian United Nations Delegation, had been
under development by a Soviet intelligence service partly as
a result of his weakness for women when assigned in Moscow
from 1957 to 1961. Gonsalves was to participate, in bilateral
talks with United States officials in October, 1969. By letter
9/26/69 CIA requested telephone and microphone surveillances on
Gonsalves, The Director. commented "Let CIA seek the authority
of the AG. I don't want them utilizing FBI as their channel,"

Zalman M. Shapiro was originally investigated by us
in 1965 as a possible unregistered agent of the Israeli Govern-
ment due to negotiations by him with Israeli officials designed
to set up a semiprivate nuclear processing company in Israel.

ea . e& ERT 92

Memorandum to Mr. C. D. DeLoach
RE: RELATIONSHIPS WITH
CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY

Our investigation showed close contact by Shapiro with Israeli
officials, strong pro-Israel sentiments by Shapiro and details*
of activity by that subject to create the firm mentioned.
Shapiro headed a Pittsburgh firm involved in Atomic Energy
Commission (AEC) work requiring "Top Secret’ clearance by AEC.
Our initial investigation was closed when Assistant Attorney
General - Internal Security Division found that facts did not
justify soliciting Shapiro's registration as a foreign agent.

In Spring of 1965, sixty-one kilograms of nuclear
material were found to be unaccounted for by the firm headed
by Shapiro, but subsequent inventories and checking by AEC

_ revealed this shortage was probably the result of cumulative

process of wasteful production methods over a period of eight
years and did not justify an unqualified determination of a
diversion of nuclear material on the part of Shapiro to
unauthorized persons or government.

CIA, in 1968, became alarmed on receipt of information

.of loss of mentioned nuclear material and despite AEC findings

felt:it may indicate illegal diversion or at least justification
for reopening investigation. Richard Helms of CIA contacted
the Attorney General directly with his thoughts regarding the

need for additional investigation. Attorney General contacted

Bureau requesting it discuss matter with CIA and determine
advisibility of additional investigation. The Director, in
approving conference with CIA, noted “OK but I doubt advisibility
of getting into this. It looks, like Helms is going around
,us to AG as he suspects we would say no." :

An intensive investigation of Shapiro conducted
during, late 1968 and into Fall of 1969 revealed no positive
intelligence activity on his part or verifiable diversion of
AEC material to Israel. Our investigation included technical
surveillances installed 9/27/68 and discontinued, 9/4/69, Shapiro
was interviewed by AEC 8/14/69 and disclaimed passing any

. classified data to Israeli Government. Facts of case were

reviewed by Department of Justice which found no evidence of pro~
secutable violation by Shapiro. AEC felt the additional investi-
gation produced no data upon which could be based a legitimate
withdrawal of clearance for AEC contracts or information. In
view of this, we closed our investigation and CIA was so advised.
A 10/13/69 letter from Helms acknowledged additional investigation

prompted CIA's original request but noted he felt reinstituted
audio surveillances of Shapiro would produce positive ‘intelligence
information. Hé therefore requested reinstitution of this :

after, careful review it was felt that CIA should take this °
matter to the Attorney General.
. ,

On October 21, 1969, a CIA official was told by
_Special Agent Papich that in the future CIA should transmit its
“F¥equests for technical surveillance coverage in the United States
to the Attorney General. This specifically covered the cases
of Gonsalves and Shapiro. The Director commented “Right.

Bureau Policy of Cooperation

In 1965 and 1966, recognizing overlapping interests,
changes inherent in faster communication, hysteria to facilitate
international travel and in response to requests from CIA, the
Director approved Bureau attendance at conferences with CIA
regarding that Agency's operational activities in the United States,
On a memorandum reporting the results of the conferences with
CIA, the Director commented “I hope we still don't let our
guard down as CIA has always outsmarted us because of our
gullibility."

SAC Letter 66-10 (B) dated 2/15/66 furnished to the .*
field and Bureau offigials results: of the conferences with CIA
and emphasized necessity for protecting Bureau jurisdiction in
the counterintelligence field. This SAC letter (copy attached)
emphasized there is to be. no interference with or infringement
upon our jurisdiction but clearly shows our willingness to

United States. In approving this SAC letter, the Director
noted "I hope there is no 'sneaker' in this. Time will tell.'.

There has been no renewed request from CIA for
technical coverage in the cases mentioned above, nor has there
been any indication that such requests have been sent. by CIA
to the Attorney General as we suggested. Due to CIA interest
in the past in these matters, we cannot rule out the possibility
the Agency may approach Attorney General for the desired
coverage at some time in the future.

of a positive intelligence nature. This requires Bureau action designed to
bring about the necessary coverage. A good example is our involvement

in the development of information relating to the crisis in the Dominican
Republic. From the above you will recognize that there can be "gray areas”
of interest to the Bureau and CIA. It, therefore, has been necessary to
‘effect adequate coordinating machinery.

The potential for the.development of positive intelligence in this

“country is vast and varied. Voluminous poSitive intelligence is collected

overtly through the review of foreign and domestic publications, interviews
of travelers, arriving aliens, contacts with scientists, et cetera. In this
area there have been no serious issues between the Bureau and CIA.

However, in the field of clandestine development of positive
intelligence both agencies have an interest, and‘there is a necessity for a
clear~cut understanding of jurisdiction and coordination. Particularly is
this true in the development of poSitive intelligence sources who are
employees or officials of foreign governments stationed in the United States
or who are visiting this country on a temporary basis.

For many years the Bureau has had a continuing program of

developing sources in diplomatic installations for the purpose of discharging

our counterintelligence responsibilities and incidentally for developing a
poSitive intelligence information which might assist the Government in
formulating policy. The Bureau, recognizing CIA's need for sources in the
positive jintelligence field, has permitted CIA to assess and recruit sources in
the United States in a limited manner with,the understanding that such activities
are fully coordinated with the Bureau. In January, 1964, CIA established

their Domestic Operations Division (DOD) to conduct such operations in the
United States. and certain Bureau field offices were alerted and furnished

the necéssary guidance and instructions. The recent discussions with CIA

resulted in a refinement of the understanding of the ground rules established

‘in January, 1964. ¢

The enclosed ground rules will be applied by the Bureau and CIA
as cases arise. The Bureau position in each matter will be décided at the
Seat of Government. As a& general rule, Bureau Headquarters will be. infor med
by C1A regarding its interest in an individual or a target. Prior to notification
of CIA regarding our position, the situation will be carefully reviewed at the
Seat.of Government. This may often include a request to the field for

the same time, it is possible that you may be contacted in the field by a

Dear Mr. President:

In reference to our discussion concerning the serious inter- -
national situation and the need for more intelligence information of a high
quality, I have analyzed our coverage abroad.

We presently have eleven liaison offices located at Bern,
Switzerland; Bonn, Germany; Buenos Aires, Argentina; Nong Kong, British
Crown Colony; London, England; Madrid, Spain; Mexico City, Mexico;

, Ottawa, Canada; Paris, France; Rome, Italy; and Tokyo, Japan, staffed by
1 twenty-eight Special Agents.

With your approval, we are in a position to increase our Agent
complement abroad by adding one man each to our offices in Paris, Bonn
and Rome, /and two men to our office in Buerios scifi We are alsoina

one iglestablish pew offices at) el Aviv, IsraelSaigon, Vie H

We feel the new offices, which we recommend be established,
are desirable in view of the current crises in the Middle East and‘ Viefnai
which are subject to momentary escalation, and the recurring critical

situations in Central America and South America. An office in Helsinki
would present the advantage of having a listening post close to the Soviet border.

We are giving further consideration to expanding our domestic
coverage and to the possibility of additional expansion abroad for the purpose
Oot producing information in the foreign intelligence field.

: SECRET
Memorandum for Mr. Sullivan

Re: EXPANSION OF FBI FOREIGN
INTELLIGENCE COLLECTION EFFORTS

We have selected the six new locales for following reasons:
.

With respect to Tel Aviv, the Israelis have a most competent and
efficient intelligen¢e-gathering network relating to the Arab countries and our
efforts would be directed toward enhancing the flow of strategic information of
this type to the U. S. In Saigon, Vietnam, there is an obvious. critical situation
generating the development of political intelligence. We would also be in position
to develop on the spot the identities of’ Americans traveling in the area,
particularly those subversives who within our own country are ee toward
the overthrow of our Government,

Caracas (Venezuela) is the capital of a country which has been a
prime target for Castro infiltration and subversion efforts. In addition, from
this strategic point we would be in position to develop political intelligence
regarding Colombia, Panama, Ecuador, Trinidad, Guyana and Surinam. There
are strong anti-American segments in all these countries working to deliver
them to Castro, Communist China and Soviet Russia. San Jose is located in
Costa Rica, the southern-most Central American country excluding Panama.
All Central American countries are presently covered as a road trip by Mexico
City Agent. Establishing San Jose as a Legat post would put us in the position
of having an office strategically located to report regarding countries which
are almost constantly in a state of rebellion and change. We would, of course,
eliminate the road trip out of Mexico in establishing San Jose as a Legat post.

La Paz is located in the country (Bolivia) where ''Che'' Guevara
was killed. It is strategic in its location in that it borders Chile to the south’
where a communist regime is about to take over and Peru to the west which
is strongly anti-U. S. to the extent that U. S. interests are being confiscated.
Helsinki (Finland) is in a country bordering Russia and would give us a
strategic listening post in an area where there is a definite need for intelligence.
With respect to both Bolivia and Finland, however, we must be prepared to
encounter difficulties in establishing Legat operations because both governments
are oriented away from the U. S.

Expansion abroad would include the necessity of assigning additional
clerical personnel to certain existing offices as well as to the new offices.

Through past experience we know there is considerable high-level
political intelligence available within the U. S. which can be secured immediately

and with no risk through coverage of diplomats and diplomatic establishments by

technical surveillances, During past crises, such as those relating to the hi
Middle East, Panama, Dominican Republic and Cuba, we have been able to

produce especially significant data through technical coverage of selected
establishments.

We recognize that should we expand our foreign coverage, certain
problems would arise in view of Central Intelligence Agency and State Depart-
ment interests in this area. However, we do feel the Bureau could provide
information through the expansion outlined above which would be of benefit to
the President and that any objections which may arise from other agencies can
be overcome.

ACTION:

(1) If approved, attached letter will be sent to the President advising
him of extent of our present coverage, expansion of our current offices, and
establishment of additional ones as outlined above.

(2) If approved, we will submit our recommendations with regard
to expanding our technical coverage of diplomats and diplomatic establishments
within the U. S. for purpose of producing the intelligence required by the President.

(3) If approved, office of Assistant to the Director J. P. Mohr will
proceed to recommend the additional personnel described above.

(4) If approved, we will instruct all Legats to expand their current
coverage and to advise of their plans and recommendations for accomplishing
this.

sugyect: THE LEGAL ATTACHE PROGRAM

The Bureau! S ; Foreign Liaison Program has prod to be an invaluable
adjunct to all categories of FBI investigative activity, particularly in view of the
proven incapability, if not indisposition, of CIA and other agencies to adequately
service our requests for inquiries overséas, or even more important, to aggressively
seek the manifold information of immediate value to the Bureau which is available
through well-developed foreign sources. It is obviously important to locate Legal
Attache (Legat) Offices geographically and to staff them in the manner that will
accrue to maximum advantage of the Bureau. The purpose of this memorandum
is, our request, briefly to analyze existing and potential foreign liaison coverage ,
from standpoints of both areas involved and personnel. This analysis willbe ,

Memo for Mr. Tolgon SECREE-
Re: The Legal-Attache Program

Rome: ° The Rome Office was cut in late 1967 from 3 Agents and 3 clerks to
Agents and 2 clerks. It is operating very smoothly with present complement and,
in fact; Could carry a slightly heavier load. Legat Rome has substantially improved
the imperfect liaison which existed in its territory two years ago. Since 1967
road trip coverage of Turkey and Lebanon was discontinued as unproductive.
Coverage is now limited to Italy and Greece, with one-week road trips to Greece
made every other month. The cases developed from the-Greece road trip are
very routine in nature, consisting mostly of matters gleaned from review of U. S.
visa and immigration files in Athens, Assistant Legat Theodore A. Korontjis, who
mainly handles liaison in Greece, has informally expressed his intention of requesting
return to domestic assignment when his present tour expires in 1970. It is believed
that a Greek-speaking Agent is not essential for the type of work currently existing.
Replacement of Korontjis with a Spanish-speaking Agent would permit assumption
of Spain-Portugal coverage by the Rome Office, which Rome work load could well
accommodate. Airline distance from Rome to Spain and Portugal is only negligibly
greater than from Paris.

London: Legat London's complement was reduced from 3 Agents and 3
clerks to 2_Agents.and_2. clerks in late 1967. Work load is heavy but actually no
more so than that of Legat Paris, who had adjusted to the reduction somewhat more
gracefully. Continued attention to conscientious streamlining and selectivity and
economy in direction of effort can enable the London Office to function effectively
with existing personnel. However, if assignment of additional personnel to Legats
becomes practical, and especially if the Spain-Portugal responsibility were shifted
from Paris to Rome, London, of the 5 European offices could best justify a personnel
increase, and increase of clerical complement from 2 to 3 could be considered
warranted.

Bern: Complement of Legat Bern (1 Agent and 1 clerk) has remained
unchanged since the office was opened. Bern covers Switzerland and Austria with
very occasional trips to the tiny principality of Liechtenstein.

Bonn: Complement of Legat Bonn was reduced in late 1967 from @Agents
and clerks to 2 Agents and Z clerks, Bonn handles work in West Germany and thé
Neéthée¥fands7~

Both the Bern and Bonn Offices are productive and well managed, but
do not have visible expansion potentials that would necessitate or justify
additional personnel. Bonn is in a position to release one of its 3 clerk-stenographers
whenever necessary during extended leave of employees in the other European
Offices. The Paris, London, Bonn and Rome Offices are all capable, through
good management, of releasing their second Agent temporarily for relief duty

as necessary in the one-man Bern Office.

Memo for Mr. Tolson _ -SHCREE-
Re: The Legal Attache Program

FAR EAST

, We-have three Legats in the Far East: Tokyo, Japan\taniia aler

Philippines; and the British Crown Colony of Hong Kong. All diaison in the
Orient was handled until 1961 by Legat Tokyo. The Manila Office was opened in
1961 and the Hong Kong Office in 1966 with appropriate allocation of geogmphic
responsibilities; Preponderance of work in all three offices, and particularly in
Tokyo and Hong Kong, has been in the security category -- with main emphasis
on Chinese Mey ea ar ars.
u : 1967 complement of the Tokyo Office was reduced from,
2 Agent and 2Clerks to 1 Agent and 2 clerks. Territory covered includes

dapm, Republic of China (Taiwan), South Korea and Okinawa. The latter 3 areas

are covered by road trip of about one week at 2-month intervals. Solidly established
sources provide a wealth of information of value to the Bureau, which of necessity
at present is processed most selectively by the Legat. Sufficient potential for

urther exploitation of sources in Japan and Taiwan exists to justify assignment of
fa second Agent in event overseas expansion becomes feasible. Competence in the
Japanese language, written as well as spoken, is important. Clerical complement
at Tokyo had been 3 until about 1965, when it was reduced to 2. The office has
operated efficiently through extensively streamlining with the 2 clerks, and can
continue to function with this complement although supply of relief clerks by Tokyo
to other Far Eastern Officesyis difficult.

Whe

Hone Kong?, Complement of Legat Hong Kong has been ] Agent and 1
clerk since time the office was opened. There are no roadtrips. Limited potentials
in the nearby Portuguese colony of Macao, plus hazards of travel to that colony
which is so susceptible to Chinese Communist encroachment and pressure, have
militated against official travel there by Bureau representatives. British authorities,
in approving our opening of the Hong Kong Office, were adamant that we not conduct
liaison with Taiwan from Hong Kong in view of the sensitive balance of British
relations with Red China. This factor has precluded our consideration of shifting
coverage of Taiwan (which is located about half-way between Hong Kong and Japan)
from Tokyo to Hong Kong. Major work of Legat Hong Kong involves file reviews
and liaison within the American Consulate General, which is one of the largest
consulates in the world, having more personnel assigned than our embassies in
many of the smaller countries. Of much importance also is liaison with Hong Kong
Police Headquarters and British Security Service (MI-5). Although Legat Hong
Kong xhas continually pressed the Bureau for assignment of additional personnel,
the existing complement should be adequate if efforts are applied by Legat with
maximum efficiency. Liaison is conducted 100% in English, which is the official
language in Hong Kong. Knowledge of Chinese is helpful in living in Hong Kong, but
is not essential. .

Memo for Mr. Tolson
Re: The Legal Attache Program

Manila: There is very little activity of interest to the Bureau in the
Philippines. Our office was located there in 1961 largely because of its central
location with respect to Southeast Asia. All liaison in the Philippines is
conducted in English, which is the official language. Spanish is virtually useless
and study of the native Tagalog, Ilokano and Pampanga dialects is impractical.
The Manila Office since its inception has had one Agent and one clerk. Because
of dearth of-work in the Philippines and wide extent of the territory, the Legat has
spent a large proportion of his time "on the road," covering all of Southeast Asia,
Singapore, Kuala Lumpur, Australia and New Zealand. Much of his travel to far-
flung countries has been necessitated in the past by requirement that Legat

i interview FBI National Academy candidates being sponsored by the Agency for
International Development (AID. Case load at Manila has dropped substantially

during the past 16 months, Manila Tifany Far Eastern 0 office, should be considered

for ‘“Peadjustment ¢ of ‘territory. The small an amount c of work existing i in Manila itself

could be be handled without, pace b y Legat | Hong ong Kong ( one » hour a “away. | by. by. airjet).

“more re logical spot for st Asia might be Canberra,.Australia,

Bangkok, ‘Thailand, both trally located, have more

| potential for expansion of FBI it é interests and present a more healtful,

j secure environment for clerical employees and dependents.

Vietnam: Another area of vital importance to the United States at
this time is South Vietnam, which heretofore has been considered part of the
Manila territory. Saigon currently is the seat of one of the largest U. S. Embassies
in the world in terms of personnel assigned, with enormous U. S. Information
Service, AID, and other auxiliaries. The CIA operation in Vietnam is by far the
largest it has in the whole world. Although we have in the past had relatively little
case work in Vietnam, ‘unquestionably an FBI representative, if solidly accredited
to the Embassy, would be in a position to make an important contribution to the overall]
; effort through police liaison, and would at the same time serve as a valuable listening
| post for the Director. In any expansion program it would th therefore appear that
{ Saigon should be actival y “considered.

Taiwan: As noted above, the Republic of China (Taiwan) has been
covered by Legat Tokyo. British attitude makes coverage of Taiwan from our
Hong Kong Office unfeasible.

yo, and with the reduction in ae the
second clerk could be made available whenever required for relief duty in other
Far Eastern offices. On analysis, however, it would appear more desirable for
the Bureau to continue to cover Taiwan and South Korea out of Tokyo, as this,
assuming complement at Tokyo can again be established at two Agents, would

insure a source of Agent relief for the other Asiatic offices, at the same time
maintaining the economy of a more consolidated operation.

WESTERN HEMISPHERE

We.now ‘have 3 offices in the Western Hemisphere: Ottawa, Canada;
Mexico City, Mexico; and Buenos Aires, Argentina. 7

Ottawa: Legat Ottawa has aneurin from the beginning with only one
Agent, but with 2 or more clerks. Following the inpection in March, 1969,
clérical complement was raised to 3 and request of Legat for 1 additional Agent
was denied. . Legat processes an enormous volume of investigative matters (484
cases pending on 3/31/69; 282 cases closed during March, 1969), 99% of which
involve liaison with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP). Although most
of the cases are stereotyped and are handled by use of form communications, the
very volume involved is greatly confining to Legat, limiting his availability for
personal liaison with the highly cooperative RCMP in matters of greater importance
to the Bureau. For this reason, serious consideration should be given when
practical to assigning a second Agent t to offi office, of | Legat, , Ottawa,

Mexico City: Mexico City has a complement of 12 Agents an
(reduced from 15 Agents and 15 clerks following the inspection in Febru:
The office covers Mexico and five countries of Central America (Costa Rica,

El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua). Legat operates a large number
of informant nets in Mexico to provide intensive knowledge of potentially subversive
activities along the nathern border of the United States. Criminal investigations
involving border crossings are also numerous. During the recent inspection a
redimction of effort was ordered, to concentrate more fully on activities of

direct Bureau interest and less on matters where other U. S. agencies have joint
interest and responsibility. In view of this, it would not appear that increase in
personnel at Mexico in the immediate future will be justifiable, -

aah arise ra

Buenos Aires: The Buenos Aires Office was opened 3/31/67 coincident
with closing of the Rio de Janeiro Office: Territory includes Argentina, Uruguay
and Brazil. Staff consists of one Agent and one clerk, which was found to be
adequate during inspection completed "5711/6 69. “Work 1 load is substantial, but
justification was not seen during the recent inspection for reopening the Rio de
Janeiro Office.

Other Latin American Countries: At present, no regular coverage is
} maintained by the Bureau in Panama, Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia,
| Paraguay, Chile and other South American countries. Experience has shown that
well planned, aggressive liaison does produce worthwhile results for the Bureau in
cooperative foreign areas. While disposition of some of the above countries toward
the United States has fluctuated, the necessity of maintaining a position of intelligent
defense against the inroads of communism in the Western Hemisphere is clear.

Memorandum to Mr, Tolson
Re: Estimated Cost of Proposed
Expansion of Foreign Liaison

3. \{ My limited experience with and memory of the
Bureau's §,1.S. operations during World War II
convinced me that we should be able to produce
superior information. I was undercover in Chile
for one year and because of that experience, I
followed the S,I. 8. operation with more than usual
interest, I think the files will show that this Bureau
was greatly praised by high government officials
for its S.1.S. accomplishments, This leads me to
conclude that we can do a superior job again if need
be.

\ I recommend an expansion of Foreign Liaison consistent

with White House desires, We

.
The Director asked for my views on Mr. Sullivan's 6-page
memorandum, dated 6/16/71, arguing against proposed expansion of

our Foreign Liaison and proposing elimination of most existing Legal
Attache Offices either now or within six months.

Mr. Sullivan has not set forth any information which
in mind: (1) The White House requested both the recent expansion
and the proposed expansion; (2) what is of value to the White House is
political, economic and social information; (3) we are not attempting to
decide the question on the basis of “hard intelligence." ‘rhe White
House is not directly interested in Fugitives located, espionage
is talking about.
RECOMMENDATION:

That we proceed with the proposed expansion program.

Portions recommended for excision from attached have

Generally, criteria for excision were:

1. Information which could identify sources or

2. Names of individuals or organizations whose
privacy requires protection
3. Information which would reveal our overall success
or lack of success in a given investigative area
4. Information from "Third Agencies" or friendly

disclose the extent of our commitment in specific areas of
counterintelligence activity. We have given the Committee
Administrative Division figures regarding total manpower
i involved in security investigations but, to my knowledge, we
have not given them a breakdown as to where these personnel '
are assigned. A policy decision is necessary as to whether we
want to pinpoint, through release of "Adequacy of Personnel".
sections of these inspection reports, precisely how much or
how little manpower we have on specific types of investigations.

It is questionable whether the information regarding
eriminal cases in the San Francisco report is germane to the
Committee's inquiry, It would not seem improper to me to .
delete all references to criminal matters and merely substitute
‘a page saying that "pages - to relate to criminal

The percentage of all files (pending and closed)

containing substantive errors is 0.17% which is below the
field average of 0.29%. :

In pending files the percentage error was 0,12%
as compared to field average of 0.22%. This is a very
favorable comparison, however, the error percentage of 0.63%
in closed files is higher than the field average of 0.40%,
This would indicate that a closer review of files should be
made at the time of closing to insure that no further action
is warranted in those cases,

“The subject of substantive errors should be dis-
cussed with employees of the San Francisco Office periodically
and all efforts should be made to eliminate errors such as
those set out above. :

A2.a. Communist Party (CP), USA
SF 100-11889
Bureau_100-3-23 i.

The Northern California District (NCD) of the

Communist Party (CP) is comprised of 48 counties in central

and northern California. The westernmost of these counties

are in the San Francisco Division; the easternmost are in

the Sacramento Division. Most of the CP activity in the

NCDCP lies in the westernmost counties, there being only ten

known CP members in CP groups in the Sacramento Division.

The CP maintains an office in Rooms 410-11, 942 Market Street,

San Francisco.

- The CP continues to act as an organization, holding
cP club, club chairmen and district meetings.

Principal activity in the CP in the NCD consisted
of financing, preparation and distribution of literature
xeflocting th 1 cP line,. especia. “Deonle!s
World", the West cast communist newspaper published in San
Francisco, and activities relating to recruitment of new members,
for example, the formation of the local Young Workers Liberation
League.

Informants are members of most of the CP clubs in
jthe NCD. Some of these informants are members of committees
of the NCDCP. Also a number of them are officers in the various
CP groups. The identity of the members of the CP in the NCD
are obtained from these informants who report on activities of
old members, transfers of members, recruitment of new members
and cessation of activity on the part of others. Within a
short time after it ocars, any change in the membership is

-xeported. Since 4/1/70, as an example, the informants reported
two, deaths, 19 ceasing activity, 11 moving out of the district,
three on leaves of absence, two resignations, one expulsion,
four new recruits, five reactivations, and two transfers into

feeuseeuec the district. - . : So

It is felt that the informant coverage is adequate.
It will be noted there are 20, informants who are members of the
.CP in the NCD and two informants who are not members but furnish
information primarily concerning CP activity. It will be noted
the informant ratio to membership is apptoximately ¢ one informant
for each 8.5 members.

When an informant reports on a new member in the
NCD, a case is opened and assigned to secure background data,
to report subversive activity, and to make a recommendation
as to Security Index.

Source of funds are from dues, sustainers and
assessments of members; from sale of literature; from
proceeds of fund raising picnics, dinners, bazaars and
similar affaixs open to the public.

The main activity of the Socialist Workers Party
(SWP) and its affiliated youth group, the Young Socialist
Alliance (YSA), since the last inspection has been working
toward the withdrawal of troops from Vietnam. In this
connection, they have been the motivating force behind massive
demonstrations in San Francisco on 11/15/69 and 4/18/70
protesting U. S. presence in Vietnam. They have also
sponsored a petition which resulted in a referendum to be
voted on in San Francisco on 11/2/70 putting San Francisco on
record as being opposed to the war. The SWP is also in the
forefront of the Women's Liberation Movement, utilizing it as
a means of attaining the appearance of their political candidates
on college campuses to speak on the subject. When dealing
with youth, SWP activity is carried on in the name of the YSA
but as the YSA is completely controlled by the SWP, members who
comprise a majority of the YSA membership the name utilized in
public activity is irrelevant. Funds are derived from members'
sustainers, literature sales, and outside solicitation of funds.
Although constantly in arrears in nav s to th ational -
Office of the SWP and the YSA, they do not appear to have any
financial crises at any time. Informant coverage is adequate
at present but efforts will be made to develop additional
coverage to provide fox continuing coverage in the event current
informants. are discontinued for any reason. New members are
identified by member informants. The membership of the SWP
in this area is approximately 99 according to member informants.
The membership of the YSA according to member informants is
approximately 90.

RU publications describe RU as adhering to Marxist-
Leninist-Mao Tse-tung thought and advocating necessity of
armed revolution to destroy United States imperialism and
establish dictatorship of proletariat. Members of leading
body, Political Committee, state all members armed. At
Central Committee meeting weekend of October 10 and 11,-1970,
75 delegates present and informant who was present estimates
75% to 80% advocated armed struggle now. RU going national
| “and has started collectives in Northwest, Chicago area,
Detroit, and in several major cities in Bast. Chief sources
of funds are membership dues and profit from sales of publi-
cations. RU publishes three newspapers and has significant
control over a fourth. Has published three issues of
theoretical journal "Red Papers." RU concentrating on
revolutionizing of workers, college and high school students,
looking towar@ formation of national Marxist-Leninist Party.
capable of seizing control of the United States. RU activ:
in strikes around the Bay Area, college demonstrations, and
in community affairs, tenants unions, welfare, and education.
Increased emphasis being placed on weapons training and
affinity groups being organized for action in demonstrations.

RU members are identified mainly through live
informant coverage; fisurs and, where possible, photo
coverage of known RU meetings. Additional names of RU
membership is self-identification in RU newspapers, and

. coverage of RU communications by SF_3247-S. Estimate of

- RU membership in Bay area based upon figure quoted to

ember informant by RU Chairman in 9/70. Rapid membership

increase attripuced to heavy emphasis on recruiting during
past year, less insistence on ideological purity in
recruitment and increased recruit potential caused by
breakup of SDS. Whilé present informant coverage
considered adequate on overall RU activity, it is felt
member informant coverage should be increased on area
basis to identify individual members. so they may be placed
on SI.

The Bay Area Progressive Labor Party. (BAPLP)
membership is made up primarily of individuals in their early
twenties. The organization in the past held and is presently
holding classes on Marxism for potential members and for
further education of old members. The BAPLP is not holding as
many public forums and open meetings as it has in the past.

The BAPLP is active in the Students for a Democratic Society
(SDS) at the University of California at Berkeley, San Francisco
State College in San Francisco, and Merritt College, Oakland,
California. The BAPLP has a number of SDS sympathizers who
have aligned themselves with the PLP line and become BAPLP
candidate members. The PLP is concentrating its main efforts
on-student activities. This is the area where they hope to
recruit new members. The BAPLP membership is estimated to be
between 45 and 50. There has been no significant change in
membership since the last inspection. Some members have moved
out of the area and several have quit the Party. The Party is
hopeful of gaining new members primarily from radicals on campus
and is having some success. Efforts are being made to secure
Ye (@ additional member informant coverage in the BAPLP. BAPLP

The San Francisco chapter of the National Lawyers
Guild (NLG) operates a legal referral service and its members
have provided legal defense for Communist Party members as
well as anti-draft and racial matters and are presently taking
a participatory interest in the Soledad Brothers by providing
counsel for imprisoned felons, “Funds are derived from
membership dues. ;

The Northern California Committee For Protection of
the Foreign Born is in effect dormant, has only $30 in its
bank account and holds no meetings or functions. Unless an
immigration proceeding or legislation dealing with immigration
policy arises, the organization will remain dormant. Funds are
no’ longer being solicited.

Northern Californians Against Repressive Legislation
(NCARL), formerly known as the Northern Californians
the House Internal Security Committee, changed its name to
broaden the scope of its activity. Its main activity is the
dissemination of literature attacking specific legislation.
Meetings are held primarily to solicit help in mailings and to
discuss progress in influencing citizens and members of Congress.
Funds are derived from public donations solicited in mailings.

The American-Russian Institute (ARI) exists mainly
‘as a distribution center for the dissemination of Soviet
propaganda throughout Northern California and as a contact point
for Soviet exchange students, visiting Communist dignitaries, and
other visitors from behind the Iron Curtain. Funds are raised
by monthly contributions and a large fund raising dinner held
annually on the anniversary of the Russian revolution.

: The "People's World" (PW) newspaper has two or three
fund-raising affairs yearly and numerous small meetings stch as

. breakfasts for fund-raising purposes. Its annual fund drive and
subscription drive quotas are usually met.

The Guardian has not held any public meetings during
the last year. In April, 1970, Guardian workers in New York
revolted against Guardian policy and began publishing a
“Liberated Guardian". The Guardian no longer has a representative
in the San Francisco area whereas the "Liberated Guardian" lists
approximately seven individuals on its Bay Area staff but has
held no meetings of a public nature. :

2. Organizations:

The last inspection coincided with the famous Students
for a Democratic Society (SDS) June 1969 Chicago Convention
in which the then SDS leadership attempted to expell the
followers of Progressive Labor Party (PL). PL controlled the
major local campus SDS chapters at the University of
California, Berkeley, and San Francisco State, Anti=PL chapters
of SDS existed for a few months at Stanford University and
San Jose State College, but as SDS became less massive as an
organization controlled by PL these members drifted into groups
such as the Revolutionary Union (RU). Lack of communication
and organization, as well as a National SDS debt, constant
appeals for funds, and continued ridicule by RU and Weatherman
groups have all contributed te £ ntegratica of SDS.
Demands indigenous to the Student Movement have been ignored
to concentrate on PLis program of "Build a Worker-~Student
Alliance" (WSA). At a western regional conference held at
Berkeley, California, September 26, 1970, SDS attempted to
re~organize with delegates from throughout the West. Some
eriticism of PL was voiced but PL’ continued to dominate,
calling for a demonstration at San Jose, California, November 3,
1970, in support of striking auto workers, SDS/WSA distributes,
when funds available to print it, “New Left Notes", published
at Boston but more regularly distributes "Challenge", publication
_ o£ PL, SDS/WSA Western Regional Conference was only able to
raise $150 toward $5,000 National Office debt,

The Bay Area Peace Action Council (BAPAC) is a
coalition of various anti-war groups in the San Francisco area
whose sole purpose is the immediatewithdrawal of all U. S.
troops from Southeast Asia, BAPAC is not a membership
organization, however, the Socialist Workers Party (SWP) is a
controlling force behind it, simply because numerous SWP
members attend BAPAC meetings regularly. Funds are derived
from public solicitations. :

The Student Mobilization Committee (SMC) is a
national organization of high school and college students
whose basic aims are the immediate and unconditional with-
drawal of all U. S. troops from South Vietnam, abolition of the
draft, self-determination for Vietnam and Black America, and

NW 65360 Docld:32989637 Page 181 i : : :


Constitutional rights for GI's and high school students. Hl
The majority: of the individuals functioning in a leadership
capacity in the SMC are members of the Young Socialist
Alliance (YSA) and SWP. Funds derived from sale of buttons
at demonstrations, public donations and support from YSA and
SWP.

The Venceremos Brigade (VB) of the San Francisco Bay
Area is affiliated with the national organization headquartered
at New York, New York, and is principally active in the
recruitment of individuals for the VB sponsored contingents
to Cuba. There are no local independent publications of the
VB. Confidential informants continually report a lack of
funding and finances, There are no key activists directly
affiliated with the VB.

The Newsreel in San Francisco was established in
May, 1968, as a branch of the New York Newsreel, a radical
film-making group. Articles of Incorporation, pursuant to
non-profit orporations under the laws of the State of
California, number 58415, were filed in the Office of Secretary
of State, California, November 5, 1969, The Newsreel makes
and distributes films that depict ideas and information that
the Government and the news media tend to choose to ignore,
In the spring of 1970, the Newsreel began work on two new
films, one on the history of labor and the other on the
history of the women's liberation struggle. Persons who have
had some activity in the SPS and related groups in other
parts of the United States have been some of the leaders of
the Revergaee in San Francisco,

The White Panther Party (WPP) in Berkeley is a
small group which seems to center its activities around
drug usage and communal living activity. The group has never
been identified as a significant force in the radical scene
at Berkeley. There are no Key Activists in the Berkeley
group. Recently, the WPP have been "hangers on" at the office
of the underground newspaper "Berkeley Tribe”.

The WPP of Marin County began in May, 1970. The
two leading figures among its‘7 - 10 members are DENNIS MARNELL
and RICHARD LORD STARK, both Priority I Security fndex Subjects.
This group lives in communal style. To date, the group's major
activity is the free distributing of food purchased with food’
stamps. :

Activities of the WPP in Palo Alto currently are
being directed p: ily hy..Revolutionary Union leaders who
live in communes wi the WPP members. The activities have
been limited to collecting weapons and demonstrating around
Lytton Plaza public meeting controversies. WPP has announced
its intention to "blow up a pig station" but no action along
these lines have been evident to date.

Youth International Party (YIP) was formed in New

York in early 1968 by Key Activists JERRY RUBIN,,ABBIE HOFFMAN,

STEWART ALBERT, and others. Purpose of organization was to

| disrupt the 1968 Democratic Convention. There has been

virtually no San Francisco area YIP activity and YIP was only

heard from when RUBIN, or HOEEMAN. were passing through this

area. Then, in mid September, 1970, two girls, CATHY PEARL

and PAMELA.GARRETT, publicly announced that they were

coordinating efforts to establish a San Francisco chapter of

YIP. These. two.persons, previously, Unknown tO,SanErancisco,

indices On 9/25/70, ABBIE HOFFMAN spoke to a group of about
persons at a meeting in San F¥ancisco which was arranged

by PEARL_and GARRETT for the purpose of promoting a YIP

chapter, Investigation of these two persons and the results

of their initial efforts are under way. No known offices

or publications at this time. No local Key Activists known

to be involved. :

sources to record contemplated movements; through employment
sources, when the individual is regularly employed; through
bank sources to ascertain details of income, particularly the
sources thereof; through targeting informants who are in or
report on the groups in which the particular key activist is
associated, These informants are impressed with the
importance of developing a working relationship with key

Publications:

The "Leviathan" newspaper, formerly printed in New
York City, has moved its editorial offices to San Francisco.
Since its arrival two issues have been printed, One dealt
with a history of Cuba and the Cuban revolution and the other-
dealt with a variety of radical topics, dealing principally
with the Palestinian liberation movement. The newspaper is
thought to be in dire financial straits as ten days ago their
telephone was disconnected,

: "Ramparts", a monthly magazine, has had as its
principal backer EDGAR LOCKWOOD. He recently withdrew
financial support~in protest 6ver the magazine's radical
tone of late. ‘The last issue pleaded for financial assist-
ance.

The three major weekly underground papers are the
"Berkeley Barb", the "Berkeley Tribe", and the ‘Good Times".
The “Tribe" for the past month has pleaded for financial
aid to keep going. The "Barb" is the only one that is a
financial success. While reporting news of interest to
activists in the New Left, the "Barb" can sustain itself by
printing nude pictures, running several pages of sexual
want-ads, as well as advertisements from local movie houses
that feature erotic and pornographic movies.

went on tovisit Al Fatah camps in Jordan. Upon return to the
United States started Palestine Solidarity Committee in Bay Area.
These two also paid long visits to Chicom Embassy in Paris. RU

4, There are presently 31 Priority I Security Index
subjects being investigated as New Left terrorists under the
Weatherman character.

5. There are 557 cases being‘ investigated under New
Left. Movement - Violence character in accordance with instructions

_set forth in SAC Letter 70-18 (C), dated April 7, 1970.

6. (1) Of an estimated several thousand communes in
Northern California, only a small percentage of these may be
classified as political collectives organized for the purpose
of revolutionary violence. The difficulty lies in identifying
these political collectives with the scant cooperation received
by the FBI and local police agencies from the alienated youth
sub-culture which engages in this commutal living.

Extended coverage has been given to those addresses
wherein the residents have been identified as members of the
Weatherman faction of Students For A Democratic Society (SDS)
for the purpose of identifying members and locating fugitives,
Addresses which turn up in leads from other offices are given
short term coverage for the purpose of locating fugitives and

‘evaluating the nature of the commune.

The addresses of communes which have been given extended
coverage over a period of several months because they are considered
to be political collectives are as follows:

the San Francisco
Division since May, 1970, has followed a trend from mob action on
campus to off-campus bombings by terrorist groups.

LNW-65360-Bocld:3290063%-Raget90—


During May, 1970, the final series of the Spring,

1970 campus‘ demonstrations occurred on the campuses at Berkeley
and Stanford. June and July, 1970 brought a number of bombings
and attempted bombings against off-campus institutions of the
establishment. It appears that several groups other than Weatherman
participated in these bombings as Weatherman communication was only
received regarding the bombing of the Hall of Justice in Oakland,
California, on July 30, 1970.

: The months of August and September, 1970, were unusually
quiet with no demonstrations or bombings. It was not until the
fall offensive announced by BERNARDINE DOHRN,in the fifth communi-
cation from the Weatherman Underground on October 6, 1970, that a
new series of bombings began. :

The October 7, 1970 bombing of the San Rafael Courthouse
was claimed by the Weatherman and it appears that the other attemptec
bombings and bomb threats came from terroristic groups which respon-

. ded to Wetherman's cali for a fall offensive. ‘

i 7. In response to Bureau tektype, dated April 17, 1970,
| the San Francisco Division advised by teletype dated April 20,
: 1970, that an additional 28 Agents would be needed with an addi-
tional swen Agents for servicing of sophisticated coverage to
implement the irfensified investigation against New Left violence.
,In our teletype of April 20, 1970, it was indicated that the peak
. ‘number expected to be assigned to these investigations was 46.-

As of June 15, 1970, a New Left Violence Squad was set
- - up in this office consisting of 24 Agents, broken down as to 17
- Headquarters Agents and seven Resident Agents, of whom four weré
exclusively assigned to the handling of New Left extremist matters.
- One additional Agent is on transfer to the New Left Violence Squad
_ for a total of 25. : : :

: Based on current available manpower and the present
investigative demands on this office, it is believed that the Bureau
program of intensification against the New Left has been implemented
up to this time. However, in view of the new Bureau jurisdiction cf
arson and bombing matters and the tremendous number of individuals iz

. the San Francisco Bay Area who have accepted the hippie culture and
way of life among whom are the New Left extremists and fugitives,
the task of locating, identifying, and apprehending these
individuals thus poses an extremely difficult challenge.

By airtel, dated September 30, 1970, the San Francisco
Division has asked for an additional 26 Agents. Of this number
five will be assigned to the New Left Violence Squad, five will
be assigned to the squad hndling the Venceremos Brigade, six will
assigned to the squad handling the Revolutionary Union, and ten wil}
be assigned to handle the additional work load in the racial field.

D. ESPIONAGE AND RELATED MATTERS

1. Espionage and related matters are handled on Squad 8,
which is composed of a supervisor, 17 agents in headquarters,
and 4 resident agents. As of 10/12/70, the case load was 742
cases. In addition to Espionage and Internal Security responsi-
bilities dealing with the Soviets, Chinese and the Satellites,
this squad also handles various nationality groups, such as
the Arabs, Iranians and Yugoslavs, and also handles the investi-
gation of the Revolutionary Union (RU) - which is the largest
Maoist-Marxist-Leninist organization in the Bay area openly
espousing. the overthrow of this government by force and violence
and which is discussed elsewhere in detail. This squad also
handles Mexican-American matters which are in their relative
infancy but appear to be trying to follow the path of the
blacks in their efforts to obtain more recognition for their

—~-preblems. The foremost tasks presently facing this squad in
their order of importance are:

(1) Coverage of the Soviet Consulate, which is in
the process of being established;

(2) Coverage of the RU;

. (3) Coverage of the Chinese, which has taken a new
turn subsequent to the Chinese government policy now of going
international and its recognition by Canada and the contemplated
establishment of a Chinese Communist Consulate in Vancouver;

{4) Coverage of Mexican-Americans;

i (5) Coverage of Soviet students (there are 7 in the
Bay area); ‘

(6) Coverage of nationality groups, such as the Arabs,
Iranians, Yugoslavs, Cubans and South Americans, and

(7) Fisur coverage of other Soviet Intelligence
officials visiting this area, handling cases from other offices
and satellite programs and illegal agent programs.

With respect to the Inspector's comment on priorities,
I would like to suggest that serious consideration be given to
setting out priorities on situations before the fact rather than
waiting until the problems have become so serious. Specifically
it is believed that the following. serious and important matters

NUV-65360~Boeld:32989627-Rage96——___



a A=P-G

now basically in their infancy in San Francisco should receive
greater emphasis in determining the present overall Bureau
priorities.

: (1) The Soviet Consulate. Four officials have now
arrived, including the Consul General Designate and the Vice
Consul Designate, and have obtained house-keeping apartments.
All indications are they are here to stay, to be augmented to
_ 20 = 30 families when they locate their space. Three of the
four officials are known KGB and this fact should certainly

be meaningful to us. Furthermore, in no time in this country's
history have our students, scientists and men in the Armed
Forces let their moral standards deteriorate to such a low
degree. Certainly the Soviets will capitalize on this
deterioration. In addition, the San Francisco Peninsula

area is one of the most important centers of electronic and
seientific research in the tmited States.

(2) Coverage of Chinese Espionage. Within the past
week Canada has recognized Communist China and information
indicates that a Chinese Communist Consulate will be opened in
Vancouver.- Already we have seen contacts between pro-Chinese
Communist elements in San Francisco and New China News Agency
personnel in Vancouver, This, coupled with the recent indi-

cation that Communist China is now ready to come out of its

shell and now concentrate on improving its international position,
will cause greatly increased activity in the (Chinese field in
this area.

(3) The Revolutionary Union (RU), which was only
founded in 1968, has grown from 1969 ‘to 1970 from 120 to 350
members, according to estimates given by its Chairman in 9/70.

but could prove serious inasmuch as revolutionary organizations,
such as the white radicals, are making determined efforts to
revolutionize and recruit within the Spanish-American community.

There has been no reported organized activities among

in this area appear to have ceased.

Mexican-American Militancy

The San Francisco area, with its large numbers of
Spanish-speaking residents (90,000 to 100,000 in San Francisco),
is becoming one of the centers of the developing militancy of
this group. .

Poteet! 4-F-G
a ¢ i

As of the present, the most important local group
is LOS SIETE DE LA RAZA (The Seven of the Race), aka (SF file
100-63425). This group was established in May, 1969, for
the purpose of obtaining adequate legal counsel for the seven
Latinos charged with killing a San Francisco Police Officer
on 5/1/69. The group was quickly taken over by militant,
radical Latinos who have guided it into more radical and
militant channels, with close ties to such groups as the
Black Panther Party, Revolutionary Union, Youth International
Party, etc. It has a newspaper, "BASTA YA," and has expanded
its activities into such “communi ty-oriented" WORE as a “People's
Clinic" and "children's breakfasts.

The second most important local group is the VENCEREMOS

COLLEGE (SF file 100-65241), located in Redwood City, California.
This is part of the NAIROBI College of East Palo Alto,
established in 1969, following the confrontation of Third
World students with the College of San Mateo. .AARON MANGANIELLO,

irector.of VENCEREMOS COLLEGE, was expelled from Sah Mateo
College asa result of this confrontation. -

This college is primarily for young Chicano students,
and its stated goal is to produce “revolutionary technologists-
doctors, lawyers, teachers." It is a two-year college, and
claims to be accredited, MANGANIELLO states the directors
are Marxist~Leninist, and the class stressed is the political
education class in Marxism-Leninism. Tuition is free.

One of its programs is the establishment of "united
front organizations," such as the “People's Medical Center" in
Redwood City, Welfare Rights Organizations, and a Daycare
Nursery.

6. Chinese Matters : :

Although the ethnic breakdown of the 1970 census is
not yet available, it is estimated by the San Francisco Public
Health Department, that persons of Chinese descent constitute
approximately one-tenth of the population of the city. This

- percentage has risen constantly during the past two decades
and is expected to rise at an increasing rate in view of
liberalized immigration regulations and the tendency of certain
other groups to move out of the core city. The estimate of
approximately 70,000 Chinese residing in San Francisco is
matched by an equal number in other Bay area cities, making
the total Chinese population of the San Francisco Bay Area
somewhere between 140,000 and 150,000 persons.

The report of the San Francisco Chinese Community

_ Citizen's Survey and Fact Finding Committee, issued in 11/69,

- points out that the San Francisco Chinatown is not simply an
area but in fact, "a City within a City," with “its businesses
and commercial district, light manufacturing and industrial
areas, schools, churches and parks and its different housing
areas, both public and private." The fact that Chinese are
now widely dispersued throughout the city, Chinatown remains
crowded, with a population density about ten times that of
the city as a whole. Although more and more Chinese are taking
up residence elsewhere in San Francisco, and in nearby cities,
most still retain Chinatown ties and many commute daily to
their businesses or offices in Chinatown.. All of these
considerations affect the investigation of Chinese matters
and it has been found that the development of Nationality
Sources and the promotion of community relations is particularly
effective in the expeditious handling of Chinese investigations.

The San Francisco Office has sources in all of the
important organizations and groups in the San Francisco China-
town. Nationality Sources of this office serve on the board
of the Chinese Consolidated Benevolent Association, commonly

Perhaps the most important investigation in the Chinese
field at present is that entitled "Chinese Voice," IS-CH, which
appears to be shaping up as a major propaganda effort of the
Chicoms. This investigation, discussed in more detail elsewhere
in this write-up, is’ expected to become more time-consuming, as
it appears that the. editor, JOHN, S..C..ONG, will be successful
in securing Chicom financial support to make the paper into a

: Two organizations at San Francisco that are considered
pro-Chicom are the Hai Yen She (M), commonly known as the
‘Petrel Club (Bufile 105-13332; SF File 105-869), and the Red
Guard (Bufile 105-189989; SF File 105-23956).

The Hai Yen She (M) is the descendant organization
of the Chinese-American Democratic Youth League which in the
1950's had a fairly extensive membership and was actively pro~
Chicom. At present the organization is “officially" disbanded,
but it remains an informal group of Chinese who are pro-Chicom

SF File 105-1493), who was once Educational Director of the
Chinese~American Democratic Youth Club, is now the Managing
Editor of the "Chinese Voice."

The Red Guard grew rapidly in 1969, by absorbing
Chinatown youth gang elements. However, adverse publicity
and the positive action of certain Chinatown tongs which took

action to absorb some of these youth and to place them under

so that no more than ten youths are now subject to the

travel, which included visits to Soviet Russia and to Algeria,
will make it even more necessary to cover HING's activity as
a Chinatown militant.

The Asian American Political Alliance, which only a
year ago was a center of Orléiiial protesi activity act the
University of California at Berkeley, California, is now a
dead issue due to dissension in the Asian Studies Division
of the Ethnic Studies Department at that university. According
to SE-2496=Ry. a leader in these groups, the Asian Studies
group is divided between moderates who want to remain in the
university framework and radicals who want to organize the
Asian Studies Division into a community ccellege, divorced
from university control and oriented toward community action.

This Asian Studies group maintains a community center in the
International Hotel at San Francisco, as well as the Chinatown-
_ North Beach Draft Counseling Center and Everybody's Bookstore,
- dealing in Chicom and New Left literature, in that same Hotel
building. : : :

Agency representatives at Vancouver, Canada. When an official
Chicom Consulate is established at Vancouver, many Chinese
from San Francisco will undoubtedly contact that Consulate

and these contacts as furnished by the RCMP will have to be
checked to determine their significance.

Another program with potential for producing a break~
through into Chicom Intelligence activity is that entitled
"Chinese Communist Contacts with Scientists in the U.S.; IS-CH,"
(Bufile 105-168542; SF File 105-21725) recently insituted by
the Bureau to try to take advantage of Chicom interest in
the fields of nuclear ener missile and aeros ace research,
Submarine development, and biological and chemical wartare, ~
€o develop double agents among scientists in those fields.

Related to the Chinese field are the investigations
in the Revolutionary Union category, including that of its
icador, who returned to the United States
from China with the mission of setting up such a revolutionary
group. Individual discussion of both the Revolutionary Union
and its leader are set out elsewhere in this write-up.

7. . Nationalities Intelligence Matters:

Although there has been no evidence of anti-cemmunist
group activity which could be considered embarrassing to our
government, there does exist a potential among the Arab
students, Iranian students, and the Yugoslav emigre groups.

Pro-Arab activity offering potential for illegal
activity and violence centers in Arab students of the several
Bay area campuses. Their primary interest at present is to
support the Palestinian Arab cause. Demonstrations along
this line to date have been orderly and sentiment expressed
has been critical of both the USSR and Arab governments as
well as Israel and the United States.

The Iranian Student Association has chapters in the
major colleges in the San Francisco Bay area. It advocates
the overthrow of the government of the Shah of Iran. It is
also critical of U.S. "Imperialism," USSR and its cooperation
with the United States, and it supports the Palestinian Arabs.
It has sought and had the support of the SDS in its demon-
strations. Its demonstrations have been generally peaceful
excépt on one occasion demonstrators invaded the Iranian
Consulate and had to be forceably evicted by the police
department. 41 of them were arrested.

Among the Yugoslavs, the Ustashi element of the
Croatian group have exhibited bitter resentment to public
appearances at Croatian emigre social affairs by representa-
tives of the Yugoslav Consulate, San Francisco. Via their
weekly radio program they criticize the present communist
regime in Yugoslavia and strongly advocate a "free Croatia."

The Chetnik element of the Serbian group also’ voice
their criticism of the present communist regime in Yugoslavia
via their weekly radio program.

There has been no acts of violence perpetrated by
the Yugoslav group in the San Francisco Bay area. They have
on two occasions formed picket lines in the vicinity of the
Yugoslav Consulate protesting the Yugoslav communist govern-
ment but on each occasion they registered same with the San
Francisco Police Department.

6. Deseco Program

San Francisco is aware.that the West Coast is of
increasing interest to the SIS, and the anticipated opening
of the Soviet Constilate iias euplasized the neea fox the develop-
ment of an adequate pool of sources, informants and double
agents which will assist in our efforts to effectively cover
the intelligence activities of the Soviets.

To further implement the instructions of the Bureau
in this program, San Francisco has obtained from the Defense
Supply Agency, the identities of employees of Tndustrial firms
who plan travel to or through Sino-Soviet bloc countries or
who plan to attend an international meeting outside the U.S.
where Sino-Soviet-bloc personnel may be present. These persons,
on a selective basis, are interviewed to alert them to the
possibility of foreign intelligence recruitment, and their
DESECO potential is then evaluated.

Other sources which have been contacted in an effort
to locate suitable individuals for development within this

program include security offi jor ind

A total of 159 PSI-DESECO cases have been opened by

been interviewed. 58 of the 159 cases are now pending, and
potentially suitable persons included in these pending cases
will be interviewed in the future. g§eyven,persons have been

A. Counterintelligence Against Communist Party USA:

No occasion has arisen where it was felt that

any counterintelligence action action would
heighten existing tensions or create

disruption, so no authority for counterinteliligence
action was requested of the Bureau,

B. Counterintelligence Against New Left:

The continued fragmentation of New Left Groups
and the criticism of ‘one group by the oiler
has narrowed opportunities under this program,
SDS/WSA local campus chapters are constantly
labeled "PL stooges" by other campus groups.
The attendance of such large student groups as
World Christian Liberation Front (WCLF) at
Regional Convention of SDS to preach the
toe - Gospel was more disruptive than any program
we could suggest to Bureau, The WCLF delayed
the West Coast SDS Convention one half day
until the SDS removed the WCLF and its student
members to the outside, where they continued
to pray for forgiveness of the SDS and to SDS
to refund their registration fee, As a
combined result of University and local
prosecution virtually the entire leadership
of such groups as Berkeley SDS and Campus
Progressive Labor Party are currently under
suspension and many have felony indictments
pending against them. Our prompt notification
of such agencies as I and request for regular
notification of action taken by them in case
of iersien disrupters has resulted not _
necessarily in statistics under this program
but results in keeping with spirit of program.
While suggestions made under this program
tangible results are not evident because
with the disruption carried on by one group
against another greatest care must be
exercised to prevent involvement that could
result in criticism of Bureau.

concern groups and individuals in the security field, e&cept

matters which is set forth elsewhere in this inspection report.

cases); 2983 communes with estimated 20,125 members of which
40 are known to be violence-oriented (membership unknown);
overall individuals living in communes varies throughout the year
because of heavy influx of students and transient “hippie-type”"
individuals; 69 security informants (53 member informants) of
which 23 report primarily on Communist Party (CP) matters,

24 PSIs, 161 PSIs under development; 51 institutions of higher
education with enrollment of 272,970 students (number of

Negro and/or racially-oriented students unknown); ten extremist
or racially~-oriented publications (includes two Black Panther
Party papers), some published periodically but at least ona
monthly basis with total estimated circulation of 359,800;

65 acts of violence since last inspection, targets of which
were nine institutions of learning, .nine Government or military
installations, three public utilities, 15 commercial establish-
ments, five private residences, one church, resulting in 503
arrests, injury to 103 police officers (civilian injuries
numerous, total unknown), 11 deaths, damages to property

27,375 handguns stolen annually in area covered by the San
Francisco Division; while these thefts of guns and other
weapons of violence (such as related in the "San Francisco
Chronicle" of October 28, 1970, regarding a huge cache of
weapons, including such items as gas grenades, fire grenades,
..50 caliber machine guns, and dynamite caps) have not been

identified with extremist groups as
source for such weapons of violence
along with information set forth in
to your office concerning intent to

such, they offer a potential
by extremists; this and
suggestion memorandum

“blow up the Hall of Justice"

- in San Francisco emphasizes the need for your office to establish
administrative devices which will readily make available
pertinent information relating to the stockpiling of weapons
of violence by extremists; in addition, it resoundingly points
out the need for additional in-depth informant coverage in
security matters, particularly of activity of extremists
{separate suggestions have been made and are reported else-
where in the inspection report in this regard}; «fs it
appears you have “member informant coverage" in the Old Left
(CP). ,

You are making some inroads into the problems of the
New Left, the overall security picture of the San Francisco



aie |

Office clearly indicates that the need for an imaginative,
aggressive, well-organized program to obtain "member informants"
in all known extremist groups, collectives, and basic revolu-
tionary organizations in order that your office will be in a
position to fulfill the Bureau's responsibility in this field;
the re-establishment of a Soviet Consulate in San Francisco
creates a most serious investigative responsibility to your
office; daily coverage will be expected of all phases of

Soviet activities which again emphasizes the need of all types
of coverage; the Revolutionary Union (RU) (comprising an
estimated 350 members in 41 collectives of which only 145 have
been identified and 73 jaced on the Security Index) additionally
emphasizes that an aggressive, imaginative approach must be
taken against groups of this type.

Continuous terroristic violence encouraged by fanatics
and revolutionary groups, organized and unorganized, squarely
affixes San Francisco's responsibilities in the security field.

: The foremost objective in the security field must be
“member informant" coverage to identify and infiltrate all
revolutionary and extremist groups with the goal of prosecution
and/or complete extinction of these groups. Quality "member”
_informant coverage in leadership position (in violence-oriented
groups on andoff campuses) is a prime and critical factor that

“must be kept uppermost in the mind of responsible supervisory
and investigative personnel through sound administrative and
investigative programs on a day-to-day basis.

Simply stated, "the name of the game is 'member informant
coverage' in all basic revolutionary and extremist groups" so
the Bureau will be in possession of advanced information on all
pertinent contemplated acts on the part of these groups and
the prosecution after the act. The Bureau cannot take "NO" for
an answer. : of :

The above clearly points out the critical need for
in-depth member informant coverage in all of the above areas
set forth. In this regard, you should promptly make a thorough
analysis of your security informant program, insuring that all
weaknesses therein are promptly corrected in order that optimum
informant coverage is obtained from available informants in order
that necessary informant coverage is obtained at the earliest
possible date.

BASIC REVOLUTIONARY GROUPS
COMMUNIST PARTY, USA

As reported by you to answers posed by the inspectors,
the activities of the Communist Party (CP) in the San Francisco
Division appear to be adequately covered by member informants;
however, you should insure not to lose sight of the fact that this
coverage can flutuate daily. You should insure that informant
development in this organization is not relaxed in order that
you will always have adequate coverage, A review of files relative
to New Left organizations and individuals reflects that your inves-
| tigations in this area are conforming with existing Bureau instruc-
: tions.

The one problem area indicated in the New Left extremist
type organization is the Revolutionary Union (RU). Accordingly, an
in-depth analysis was made of the problems aaditehhnt this organiza-

‘tion which is set forth as follows: vos
é Et | > 1 a

REVOLUTIONARY UNION

The RU has had an alarming wenbership. growth from fifty
members at the time of the last inspection to 350 members at
present. The growth of the RU has closely paralleled recent
directives from Communist China for a Marxist-Leninist organiza-
tion outside of China. During the past six months, the RU has
assumed a national posture with the development of collectives
in the Midwest and East. At the Central Committee meeting
(governing body) held within the past week, 70 per cent to 80
per cent of the delegates favored armed revolutionary struggle now.

The RU in your territory is presently made up of 350
members in 41 collectives which are located in San Francisco and
seven Resident Agencies: Berkeley, Oakland, Palo Alto, Richmond,
San Jose, San Mateo, and Santa Cruz.

eT



Of ‘the 350 members, San Francisco has identified
as members. A total of have not been identified. This is
a most serious problem which must be rectified immediately.
The lack of appropriate quality informant coverage in,39,of the
RU collectives is the prime reason why this unfavorable situation
exists, At present you have only three member informants furnishing

information in two collectives located in San Jose. One of these
informants is onthe Steering Committee. and willbe, in a. position

to furnish you badly needed informant coverage of the RU governing
body.

You have two informants who are furnishing you valuable
information concerning the RU; however, they are not actual members .
San Francisco has five potential security informants who appear to
have excellent chaficés’ of being accepted as members. Agents handling

these informants must give them close and continuous guidance in an
attempt to have them gain membership. :

Of the members identified, a total of 73 have been
included in the SecUrity Index. The investigations CoAcerning the
other 2h, known members should be expedited and appropriate reports
submitted to the Bureau together with recommendations for placing
these individuals on the Security Index.

: . As you are aware, the Department of Justice advised on
H May 19, 1970, that it was considering submission of a petition
| to the Subversive Activities Control Board to designate the RU a
j Communist front. Because of the Department's interest in the RU,
- you should keep the Bureau advised of all pertinent information and
+ activities of this organization.through timely letterhead memoranda
and/or appropiate reports suitable for dissemination.

Aggressive and continuous investigations must be afforded
the key leaders of this organization.

NW 65360 Docld:32989637 Page 230


The extent of extremist activities such as those
adhered to by the Revolutionary Union and the Weatherman
Faction of the Students for a Democratic Society is further
emphasized by the statements of MARK RUDD, leader of Weatherman,
to the extent that in 2/70, a meetingwas held in Cleveland,
Ohio, at which time Weatherman decided to go underground
and direct "strategic sabotage" not so much at Federal Buildings
but at military and police institutions. One of the centers
of Weatherman activity was designated as Berkeley, California.
Therefore, you should insure that aggressive and’ penetrative
investigation is directed in this area not only to identify
known Weatherman members but to locate and apprehend Weatherman
fugitives.

_In regard to RUDD's statement as to strategic sabotage,
the above stated acts of Vidlence indicates that Weatherman
in this area may be responsible for such acts, it being noted
that RUDD did not indicate any specific target other than the
sabotage was to be directed against symbols of the establishment
and particularly through confrontation with police and
accomplishing accompanying acts of sapotage through the use of
bombs and other explosives. In this regard, your attention is
directed to SAC letter 70~-46(F) dated September 1, 1970, cap-
tioned "New Left Movement-Violence~Internal Security-Hiscellaneous
(Weatherman) which relates that recent developed intelligence
information unquestionably indicates the FBI, its field offices
and its Resident Agencies throughout the country are vulnerable

_ to the terroristic tactics of these madmen.. No office can

consider itself immune to such action; tannic eto should
be constantly alert for same.

. The foregoing emphasizes the importance “of penetrative
aggressive investigation and the development of "member
informants" in these organizations. It is further emphasized

‘ by the activities of extremists throughout the U. S. who, during
the past academic year, were involved in excess of 1,785
demonstrations on college campuses: During these demonstrations
ever 7,116 individuals were arrested and damage to campus
facilities amounted to more than $9,563,000. Approximately
300 police officers and 163 participants were injured during
these incidents. Recently at the University of Wisconsin at
Madison, Wisconsin, a bombing caused one death and $3,000,000
damage to a building on the campus. During the period of

eaceegen ecm



. 6
oe iy

September, 1969 to August, 1970, there were 15h instances

of bombing and/or arson. Damages as result of these instances

amounted to more than $11,454,500. This compared to the 65

acts of violence, 503 arrests, 103 police officers injured,

11 deaths and estimated damages of $961,443 in the San

Francisco Division clearly crystalizes the problem that your

office faces in combating these new left extremist groups.

You must insure that the Bureau's responsibilities in this

regard are fulfilled. 7
Stockpiling of Arms

and Ammunition

Your attention is directed to SAC letter 70-18 (C)
captioned "New Left and Black Extremist Terrorism-Bombing
Matters" dated 4/7/70, and the provisions of Senate Bill 30
relating to explosive incendiary devices and bomb threats.

The files of the San Francisco Office in- regard to
the stockpiling of arms and ammunition by extremists indicates
a need for a definite program set up by your office to insure
that you are aware of the thetts ot weapons and other insisu-
ments of violence with emphasis being placed on identifying
whether or not such weapons of violence are falling into the
hands of extremist groups.

In connection with the reported thefts of weapons
of violence you should insure that all informants (both
security and criminal) are promptly alerted regarding such
‘thefts to aid in determining if any of these weapons of
violence are being sought after or stolen by extremists.

Group-Nembership Finances

A review of the files relating to extremist groups
reflects that thAle you have made attempts to trace funds of
some of these g¥oups, you have beén :relatively unsuccessful
with the exception of thos Fa r You are

~ reminded that financial stipport 3 - any
organization and the tracing of funds, whether through member—
ship or gifts to such organimtions is important investigative
technique to identify individuals connected with any group.
In this regard accountants of your office may be of assistance
in either tracing funds or offerng guidance in this area.

Counter-Intelligence Programs

A review of the San Francisco files ‘in regard.
to the Counter-Intelligence Program of your office reflects
that serious imaginative and aggressive thinking has been
directed in this area with particular emphasis against
racial and Weatherman extremist groups. :

An effective Counter-Intelligence Program against
basic revolutionary groups is a prime aspect in neutralizing
the potential of these groups. Accordingly, you should insure
that this program continues to receive your close supervision
and direction in order that counter-intelligence can be
implemented where it will be most effective. One such area
would be in directing your attention to violations of laws
under the Bureau's jurisdiction wherein the members are reported
to be connected with extremist groups. In this regard, your
attention is directed to the Selective Service Survey (being
reported elsewhere in this inspection writeup) wherein it
is pointed out that nine individue @ reported to be
affiliated with extremist groups haing violated the Selective
Service Act. In this regard, you should insure necessary -
administrative controls are set up so such indicated violations
are promptly brought to the attention of the Sle eaten
supervisory personnel.

Security Index

A review of the overall operation of the Security.

Index was made and it was determined that it is being maintained

in a current status in accordance with Bureau instructions.

It is noted that you do not have photographs for four Security
Index subjects and that photographs of 74 Security Index
subjects are over ten years old. You should make every effort

‘to immediately obtain current photographs on those Security

Index subjects which you do not have a photograph and, if
possible, obtain current photographs of those modems Index
subjects that are over ten years old. :

ESPIONAGE AND RELATED MATTERS

: y

With the signing of the Consular Convention Agree-
ment between the United States and the Soviet Union, June 1,
1964, negotiations have been conducted concerning the establish-
ment of Consulate Offices. In April, 1970, negotiations
established authority for the Soviet Union to open a Consular
Office in San Francisco which will cover the states of Oregon,
Washington, California, and Hawaii, plus Kodiak Island and the
cities of Juneau and Anchorage, Alaska.

As you are aware, the Soviet Union previously had a
Consulate in San Francisco and Soviet personne]. assigned to
this Consulate were extremely active in espionage activities
up to the time of its closing in 1948. With the establish-
ment of a Soviet Consulate in the State of California, a state
with a large ethnic Russian population, the largest Communist
Party other than New York, and rife with extremist groups of
both the New Left aud Black Nationalist type, it is obvious
the Soviets are presented with unlimited potential tor
successful espionage operations. The area to be covered by
the San Francisco Consulate is one in which are located many
key facilities and vital military installations, including
the Defense Language Institute, Monterey, California.

: During the negotiations for the establishment of
this Consulate, it was contemplated that eight to ten Soviets
would staff this establishment. It now appears the. Soviets
contemplate assigning about thirty families to this Consulate.
At present two Soviet officials have already arrived in San
Francisco area. These individuals have previously served in
the United States and were connected with Soviet Intelligence.
The Soviets are presently in the process of establishing the
Consulate and are seeking to purchase a building and other
equipment and supplies. They are presently being assisted

by two Soviets assigned to the Soviet Embassy, Washington,
D.C. On 10/27/70, an additional Soviet arrived in San
Francisco, presumably to assist the above-mentioned Soviets.
At least three of these Soviets are known KGB agents.

The need for daily and thorough investigative
coverage and close supervision of the above-mentioned Soviets
and those who will cca is absolutely necessary and
expected. :

The seriousness of San Francisco's continuing
investigative responsibility in covering all phases of

41. -

-2- : : 4~F-G

Soviet activities in San Francisco henceforth cannot be over-
emphasized. You must personally follow all pertinent develop-~
ments in this matter on a daily basis. It will be your
responsibility to appropriately apprise offices covering the
territory of the Consulate relative to their travel to those
areas, such as Los Angeles, Sacramento, San Diego, Portland,
Seattle, Anchorage and Honolulu Offices.

The thorough daily investigation of the activities

‘of the Soviets assigned to your Consulate is without question

as important as any investigative responsibilities you have.
The Bureau.expects you to fulfill all phases of these
responsibilities in a thorough and exhaustive manner.

To date the actual purchase of a building which will
house the Consulate and anticipated living quarters for the
Soviets has not been made. Possibility exists that after
this purchase is made renovations to the building may be
necessary to fulfill the overall needs of the Soviets. If
this possibility becomes a reality, the lapse of time in
completing such renovation may delay the arrival of the full
complément of Soviet personnel. :

. The San Francisco Office has been aware of the
possibility of a Soviet Consulate being established in San
Francisco for several years. The Bureau has given you
numerous instructions in this regard. In September, 1969,
Bureau instructed San Francisco to immediately institute
a vigorous campaign to develop a pool of suitable DESECO
sources for use against Soviet personnel.

At the present time you have three PSI~DESECO, two
of whom have been placed in contact with Soviet-bloc officials.
In addition, since the last inspection you have opened 108
DESECO cases, Closed 50 of them, and you presently have 58
pending cases. This is a distinct and worthy improvement
over the last inspection when you had 19 pending DESECO
cases. In addition to the above DESECO potential, you have

three dormant double agents, sue ES a OEE toni AE Stern
134-4408, ENS Set 305 = Su 13 het Bal Oat who may eventually prove

valuable to San Francisco in its Soverage of the Soviet
Consulate. Agents handling these informants should remain
alert for the appropriate opportunity in placing these
individuals in contact with the Soviets.

It is essential that you vigorously pursue an active
DESECO Program and insure that individuals are being developed
whose background would make them attractive to Soviet

Intelligence. This program must be expanded and receive
imaginative and continuous attention. At the present time
in your coverage of the Soviet-officials who are presently
in San Francisco, you have the following basic coverage in
handling the daily activities of these Soviet officials:

following the daily activities of these officials.

. 1t is noted that since the last inspection a total
of 51 Soviets have visited the San Francisco area. .Their
overall success in gathering intelligence data is not.known..

those assigned to the Soviet Consulate is obvious and
necessary. a 7

Confidential Source Coverage pores

Sete At the time of the last inspection you had seventeen
Confidential Séurces furnishing information on Espionage” an
Nationality Intelligence matters. During the interim, nine
of these sources were closed and you developed eleven new
sources,making a total of nineteen, broken down”as Follows: |

constantly developed.

cart t

With the opening of the Consulate and the arrival
of Soviet personnel in your division, it is most essential
that consideration be given and efforts be extended to not
only evaluate individuals for potential defection but to
actively work toward inducing a defection in place recognizing
that such a source has proven to be the most productive
and positive means of penetrating Soviet Intelligence.

It should be expected that there will be an increase
of Soviet Intelligence official and non-official travelers
from New York, Washington, D.C. and abroad to the San Francisco
area. It, therefore, would appear mandatory that increased
attention and coverage be given to such individuals.

In addition the opening of a Soviet Consulaté in
San Francisco undoubtedly will stimulate the increase of
Soviet Intelligence efforts in the area of your division,
both in the legal and iileyal inielligence fielaé. This
fact will certainly necessitate the need for alertness on
your part to uncover this activity. You must give consid-
eration to means to uncover such efforts by Soviet Intelli-
gence and be certain personnel working on Soviet cases are
experienced and qualified. Sufficient manpower and attention
must be given to all facets of these endeavors.

With the establishment of the Consulate and
considering the nature and makeup of the Bay area which has
numerous private and governmental plants of a technical and

- sensitive nature, it is imperative that the contacts of the
- Consulate and its Soviet personnel be immediately identified
and thereafter exploited.

Surveillances of the Soviet personnel must be
vigirously conducted and consideration given to new sophis~
ticated means to determine the movements and contacts of
these Soviets. The Mast monitoring survey suggested by your
office and now being conducted should receive continuous
attention and implemented if feasible.

Soviet Bloc: Immigrant : ‘ : :
({SOBIR) Program 7.

Since the last inspection you have had 413 cases
referred to you under this program by U.S. Immigration and
Naturalization Service or other government agencies, and
you opened 82 of those cases and interviewed 26 persons.

At the time™Of the last inspection you had 337 such matters
referred to you, opened $9,cases and interviewed 16, indivi-
duals. Because of the excellent potential in developing
worthwhile sources in this category in connection with the
coverage of the Soviet Consulate, it is imperative that you
scrutinize each SOBIR case to insure that all potential is
exploited to the fullest.

Visitors to Soviet-
Bloc Countries

| Over 3,000 individuals in you. territor

| traveled to Soviet-bloc countries since the Ist inspection.

j Of this number, you have interviewed 104 individuals, 14 who
visited the Soviet Union. Of these [04 individuals it was
determined that one individual encountered a recruitment
approach and no persons were sre recruited. This program should
receive renewed emphasis by your office in further develop-

. ment of a wide variety of quality source coverage of the
Soviet Consulate.

Soviet Students et SiteSssstaretteceeza

At the present time you have seven Soviet students
attending universities located in your territory. Your
coverage of these students is through various sources, and
it is noted that you are continuing to develop additional
sources. It is imperative that their activities be closely
followed, according-to existing Bureau instructions. For
all practical purposes, these students should be considered
part of the Soviet Consulate complément.

-Chinese Matters

San Francisco has the largest Chinese “colony in the
United States. A review of your files concerning Chinese
matters shows that you have conducted numerous interviéws
under the Chinese Alien Interview Program. These interviews
have alerted many of the immigrants to our interests in the

event they are contacted by individuals or groups which may
be of interest to your office.

As you are aware, within the past week the Canadian
government has recognized Communist China and information
developed indicates that a Chinese Communist Consulate may
be opened in Vancouve,, Canada, in the impending future. This
Consulate will certainly produce an increase in "contact
cases." It can be expected that many Chinese of the Chinese
Community in- the San Francisco area will undoubtedly contact
that Consulate. The Chinese Communist government will
undoubtedly be vitally interested in developing sources
among the Chinese population in the San Francisco territory.
San Francisco has seen contacts between pro-Chinese Communist
elements in San Francisco and the New China News Agency
i personnel in Vancouver. This, coupled with the recent indi-~
: cation that Communist China is now ready to come ait of its
shell and concentrate cn improving its international position,
will undoubtedly greatly increase activity in the Chinese
field in San Francisco territory. The need for developing
DESECO sources and quality Chinese confidential sources is
necessary and desirable if you are to fulfill your responsi-
bilities in this potentially critical investigative area.

: Your investigation concerning the "Chinese Voice,"
a | Chinese~language newspaper, clearly shows that this paper

ig developing into a potential major propaganda effort of the
Chinese Communists. Your investigation in this regard appears
to be progressing satisfactorily.

SECURITY INFORMANT PROGRAM

“The Bureau has repeatedly stressed and the above
analysis emphatically points out the necessity of establishing
in-depth, quality informants in the racial and security field.
This fact is even more imperative now than ever before in view
‘of the present conditions throughout the United States,
particularly involving extremists as the upsurge of violence
is rapidly increasing.

The files of your SIs and PSIs have been reviewed
and individual ratings have been prepared and made available
to you concerning each file. The ratings given the informants
are as follows: :

Excellent Very Good Good Fair

SIs
PSIs’

The abcve infer t was rated fair is San et

Francisco file number 13 » Bureau file number 134-4238,
This informant should be closely followed by you for 90
days. Specific assignments should be given the informant
during this period. However, at the end of 90 days if no
positive ‘improvement is shown the file should be closed.
The Bureau should be advised of the action taken as to this’

, informant and whether or not he became productive within
the 90 day period.

In addition to the above a representative number of
the files relating to 161 potential security informants under
development (non-Bureau dpproved) were reviewed. From the
ratings given the above SIs and PSIs (considering 23, Sis
are reporting on the Communist Party)clearly indicates this
program needs revitalization within your division to fullfill
the needs of coverage on the extremist groups. Primary
weaknesses noted were made subject of separate memoranda relating
to failure to "contact informants" and the destruction of
channelizing memoranda. Copies of these memorandam will be
found elsewhere in this inspection report. Another weakness
noted in a review of these files was that informants did not
appear to be given sufficient, definite and varied assignments
in order to utilize and develop their full potential. It is
felt that through close guidance and direction of informants
currently available to you, you will greatly increase badly
needed coverage in critical areas,

i ; Fi.

aruas. You should insure that imaginative and aggressive
steps are.immediately taken in order that the San Francisco
Division has sufficient informant coverage in the security
field to meet and fulfill the Bureau's responsibilities

in this area.

You are reminded that in developing informants,
ofttimes monetary remuneration is a prime factor, coupled
with the need of a proper rapport between the agent and
the informant to fully develop the potential of the informant.

In regard to the expenditure of funds for security

informants and sources the San Francisco ery for the
eriod September 1968 to August 1969 expended $80,123.45 |

vor informants and $311.00 for sources, while during the
eriod September 196 Tough August 1970 it expended
76,789.62 for informants and $1,308 for sources. While

you should insure that value is received for funds expended,

you should also be certain that all agents are aware of the

r importance of tinancial remuneration in deveiopiny.: infurmasits.

In addition, it should be impressed upon all agents

.of the San Francisco Division that each has a responsibility
of pinpointing security informant potentials for further
development by agents handling security matters.
7 : In connection with the overall administrative
handling of the informant files of your division .3.1: in
addition to the weaknesses pointed out in the memoranda
referred to above, it was noted that the “pink sheet" in
several of these informant files were not completed. The
identities of these files were called to your attention

«. and the completion of these “pink sheets" should be acconptrshed
at an early date. : :

OBSERVATIONS

: From an overall analysis of the security matters
in the San Francisco Division, it appears a prime factor
for a successful operation in this area is the close
coordination of the three security squads along with the
racial squad in view of the scope of the problem dealing
with extremists in this area. This is necessary to insure
that each desk is madeaaware of the pertinent information
relating to the operation of that desk. i

_NW 65360 Docld:32989637 Page 241 G g :



15

Another impotant and prime factor is the fact that
your office must develop "member informants" in each extremist
group and organization in order that you will be in possession
of advanced information on all contemplated acts of violence
or other pertinent acts on the part of these groups prior to
the act taking place. :

INSTRUCTIONS

The Bureau must be immediately advised of any
outbreak of demonstrations, or proposed demonstrations
within your division. In this regard you should insure
that all employees are aware that such activities which
occur during the night within your division are brought
to the Bureau's attention by the opening of business at
the Seat of Government the following morning. ‘ This is
extremely important as the White House, the Attorney General
and other interested Government agencies rely heavily on
the Bureau to keep them advised of subversive and New Left
activities throughout the United States.

Promptly review your overall operations relating
to your informant program, correcting any weaknesses therein
to insure an effective program is in operation to develop
“memberiinformants" for in-depth coverage in all revolutionary
groups, branches and other affiliations of these groups.
“In this regard it should be stressed to ali agents that
, each have a definite responsibility in this area.

In connection with the violence-oriented extremist

groups, you are reminded that a group of like-minded individuals
“can be as dangerous, or more dangerous, than well-organized
“extremist groups. This is pointed out by the increase of
unprovoked attacks against police and the increase of acts

of violence, not only throughout the United States but in
particular in your division as indicated by the above related
statistics. With this in mind, you should insure that informants
are given assignments in conjunction with the group the
informant regularly covers to: (1) cover unaffiliated
extremists; (2) search out and identify unaffiliated extremists;
(3) attend public meetings held by extremists; (4)survey
extremist bookstores and other areas where extremists are

known to congregate; (5) insure informants are alert to
violations of both Federal and local statutes by extremists,
particularly those involving weapons of violence as such
violations may be an important factor in directing a
counterintelligence operation against the extremists.

—NW-65360_Docld: ' q 4 .

@ e '
‘ . .

- 16 - 7

By giving informants these and other assignments to actively
seek information relating to extremists, the informant will

be reporting.on a regular basis and thereby be more productive
in aiding and affording the necessary coverage in this area.

‘Closely follow investigations relating to all
communes within your division to insure existing Bureau
instructions relating to such communes are followed. ~

Insure all informants are alerted to the theft
of weapons of violence that could be utilized by extremists
to fulfill their announced intentions.

Insure that all informants are properly indoctrinated
in accordance with existing Bureau regulations with primary
emphasis on prompt reporting of information if in a travel
status to the nearest FBI office.

You should insure that an imaginative and aggressive
counterintelligence program is considered against basic
revolutionary groups insuring such programs are properly
cleared with the Bureau.

In regard to developing informants, particular
emphasis must be made in the "member informant" coverage of
each of the 39 Revolutionary Union QU) collectives.
Identify the 205 unidentified revolutionary members and
conduct appropriate investigation and submit Security Index
recommendations .

Expedite background investigation of the 72 known
members of the RU who are not on the Security Index“adhd
submit reports and recommendations for. placing them on
the Security Index.

You should insure that your office is adhering
to the Bureau deadlines in the submission of reports on
all individuals and organizations.

You should insure that necessary administrative
procedures are set up so that any member of an extremist
group who has violated a law under the Bureau's jurisdiction

“within your division is promptly brought to the attention of
the responsible desk.

4-F-G

In view of the clear danger the establishment of
this new Soviet Consulate presents to your office, it is
imperative that your overall counterintelligence efforts
be immediately implemented to meet your responsibilities.

Initiate a vigorous program to develop a pool of
additional quality sources under the DESECO Program.

Immediate steps must be taken to consider tesur
SOUS Fass and misur coverage.

Promptly institute appropriate lookout, surveillance
and substantive case coverage of present Soviet officials.
Beta

Adequate surveillance coverage must be established.
These Soviet officials will be permitted to travel throughout
the Consulate district and thus will be in a position to
personally handle agents presently existing in seattle

Washington and Los Angeles.

Closely follow Soviets purchase of Consulate building
and immediately upon ascertaining the location of the building
purchased, immediate steps must be taken to arrange suitable
Lookoug and tesur coverage of this establishment.

: You must develop an ropriate lookout on the
Soviet Consulate to vigorous Sty ENB TOReRE thee Contact program.

The Chinese Communist government, through its
official establishment in Canada will undoubtedly attempt
.to develop sources in the Chinese Community , San Francisco.
Your need to develop appropriate coverage in this regard
is of utmost importance.

RACIAL MATTERS AND INFORMANTS 4-GG

SAC ROBERT E. cepnany

A. Since the last inspection the territory covered
by the San Francisco Office has experienced no mass demonstra~
tions, riots or confrontations of a racial nature. The period
has been characterized as an organizational drive for minorities
other than black. These other minorities are of the belief
that the blacks through organizational activity, demonstrations
. and violence have gotten and are receiving a disproportionate
share of Government funds and attention. All of these groups
want what they believe is their fair share and that is one
hundred pér cent of all that is available. This development has
had a sobering effect on black demands, by occupying their time
attempting to hold on to their recent gains.

PART I. INVESTIGATIVE ASPECTS

Spanish surname groups are the most advanced in their
organizational activities, with Chinese groups fviluwing.

The violence problem involves the shooting of
policemen and numerous bombings.

In San Francisco alone in 1970, four police officers
have met violent ends. On 1/1/70, Officer ERIC oe eee age
22, was killed by two black robbers. On 2/ “BRIAN V.

“MC DONALD was killed in the bombing of the Park “bots “station.
Those responsible have never been determined. On 6/19/70,

. RICHARD RADETICH was shot through the head in the early morning
hours while writing a traffic ticket in the Haight-Ashbury
District. Those responsible are unknown. On 10/19/70, Officer
HBROLD wlicomEAMILTON, was killed by a bank robber.

Outside of San Francisco, most notable incidents of
the killing and wounding of police officers are as follows:

Black Panther Party (BPP) Capt. RANDY WILLIAMS on
the evening of 4/17/70, with two others in Oakland, shot
up a police paddy wagon being driven by two officers. Both
officers were wounded. Weapons used were both automatic
and conventional. Another police vehicle responding to the
officers' in the paddy wagon call for help came under gunfire
and was hit five times. Those responsible for the shooting
who were fleeing in a stolen vehicle in order to effect an
escape fired a shotgun and threw a hand grenade or bomb at

a

the police vehicle. A second grenade or bomb injured a bystander
and her five year old daughter. As a result of Willians.
participation he was indicted for attempted mur er and is
awaiting trial.

: In San Jose on August 6, 1970, during the early
morning hours, Officer Richard.Huerta was seated in his police
vehicle with a traffic offender who had run a red traffic
signal. Emil Aubert Thompson, a San Jose State College law
enforcement student, walked up to the police vehicle and
emptied six shots at the officer, resulting in his death.

The twenty year old bystander admitted the killing and

claims the act resulted because he hates cops and subscribes
to the BPP philosophy. His father is a veteran policeofficer

In Berkeley on August 20, 1970 after midnight,
Officer Ronald T. Tsukamoto was citing a motorcyclist for
a traffic violation. A young black bystander engaged the
otticer in a brief conversation betore pulling a gun
and firing two shots at point blank range, fatally wounding
the officer. 7

on August 7, 1970, a shoot-out occurred at the Marin q
County Civic Center, which is in the greater San Francisco :
metropolitan area. An unsuccessful attempt by three convicts 1
vand an accomplice to escape from a court room resulted in the i
death of a Superior Court jurist and three other persons, i
in addition, wounding a Deputy District Attorney and a juror. F
Angela Yvonne Davis, a self-admitted Communist Party member, }
Wr proressed revoliitionary and a recently dismissed Philosophy
instructor at the University of California at Los Angeles,
was charged with kidnapping and murder for her part in the i
abortive escape attempt. Davis was apprehended by the FBI in ,
New York City on October 13, I =e and is awaiting extradition i
to California. i
}
?

An example of an act of extreme violence occurred on
October 8, 1970 at 1:27 a.m. The same Marin County Civic ;
Center where the judge and three others were killed was :
bombed by persons unknown. Partially destroyed was a Superior :
Courtroom which suffered extensive damage.

NW 65360 Docld:32989637 Page 252


‘In the opinion of many, a definite contributing
factor in the killing of police officers and other acts of
violence by extremists is the BPP official publication,
"The Black Panther". This weekly newspaper prominently
features and eulogizes so-called revolutionary acts
by any blacks. *

There is every reason to expect a continuation
of. violence against police officers and bombings of public
and military buildings.

Since the last inspection, no institution of higher
education has experienced racial disruptions in the territory
covered by San Francisco. Some gang-type trouble has been
experienced in the high schools and these disturbances
break down along racial lines but are unorganized. An
example of such trouble occurred on October 20, 1970 at the
Woodrow Wilson High School in San Francisco. The school
has 2095 students, the vast majority of which are black.

Gang warfare broke out between the blacks and Samoans.
Only 25 Samoan students attend this school.

D. Plans to Zxpand Informant Coverage

ene is presently underway a plan) through which SPP
leader ELLIS WHITt@s is to be cormpromised and an attempt will De
made Loree oy “induce him to assist this office by virtue of
the compromise. Lographedtaking.monex.
in andep kano tofunthorenbvanhin wALErSCHCAULEd.s 16
is hoped this effort will result in coverage at the top level
of the BPP.

A comprehensive interview program remains in effect
under which all BPP nembers and ex-members are being interviewed
at least once and many several times, depending upon their
intelligence and the likelihood of their eventual cooperation.
Tioney is kmowm to be an essential factor and they are advised
of its availability in exchange for their full cooperation.

“The BPP is not presently accepting members; however,
this office maintains several informants as close to the BPP
as possible for immediate infiltration into the Party should
the bar to new members be dropped.

The California Dep
local polisée deoaPtientsy ta
Identification and In
racial, and security i re reminded See etrtece of our
continuing need for good quality informants. All the apove-
named agencies have at one time or another provided this office
with the name of a potential source and continue to do 80.

All Agents investigating extremist groups and/or
individuals are constantly reminded of their responsibility
to develop quality informants and neighborhood sources on
each and every group and individual under investigation. The
development of adequate live informant coverage in all areas
receives constant and close supervision.

Black extremist groups under investigation and
members targeted include the f following:

(These individuals were specifically
targeted on authority of the Bureau for
repeated interviews because of their positions
as leaders in the BPP. In reality any member

. or leader of the BPP who becones dissatisfied,
disappointed, or irritated with the BPP or one
of the leaders is immediately targeted for
interview. The San Francisco Office is always
alert to this possibility through established
sources. )

Nation of Islam

(This organization has committed no violent
acts and its membership has remained relatively
fixed for over two years. Present informant
coverage is considered more than adequate. ):

In the past the BSU at San Francisco State College has
been the only other Black Extrenist organization worthy of note
on college campuses. This organi zation has been prantioally
emasculated; however, by the firm stand taken by San Francisco
State Gollege President S. 1. HAYAKAWA. It is unlikely it will
become a viaole organi cation aparn tare school year, but if it
does, CSS@_ 3060-8 is sm | ina position to provide the
needed coverage. In a tr nis JERR DO, an ex-BSU.

at San Francisco State has been interviewed” aren some success
in the past and further steos are being taken to gain his con+
fidence. BSU's on other college campuses in past years have
not cormitted any acts of violence and established sources advise
none are expected to occur this year.

F. All ghetto and racial informants are solicited
repeatedly for the names of individuals who they believe can
possibly be of assistance to this office in providing the in-
formation needed in racial matters This technique has proven
to be of value as a source for new “informants. Where possible,
ghetto informants are utilized to cover public functions,
rallies, or meetings sponsored by militant groups. They are
provided assignments where compatible with their ability and
encouraged along these lines so that their usefulness to this
office is fully exploited.

All racial informants are constantly educated and

‘reminded of the Bureau's responsibilities in the racial field

“ and the need for timely, accurate intelligence information on
all militant individuals and organizations and their activities.
They are encouraged to engraciate themselves with and to seek
the companionship of individuals in positions of leadership
and to spend as much time as possible in and around the offices
and pads and in the company of individual leaders. Emphasis
is placed on determining the likelihood of racial violence and
the locating of weapons, ammunition, and explosives. Assign-
ments are immediately given to resolve any rumors of the
stockpiling of weapons or explosives. Successes are rewarded
by increased payments and bonuses. eet r

All Agents handling racial and ghetto informants have
been repeatedly reminded to report and flash all statistical |

accomplishments on FD-209's or informant contact menos. These
particular memos are then routed to the racial infornlant co-
ordinator who includes the statistics on the F “1.05 submitted

Gee All racial and ghetto informants have been alerted and
are constantly reminded to immediately contact this office tele~
phonically for instructions in case a racial disturbance appears

tains a ghetto informant card index filed by area. The card con-
tains the informant's place of residence and employment and the
‘telephone numbers so he can be immediately contacted should the
disturbance be in the area he covers.

3. Liaison with major law enforcement agencies
within the San Francisco area is specifically assigned to
Agents on the Racial Squad. Liaison with other law enforce-

assigned to appropriate Resident Agency or Headquarters
Agents; and this liaison includes campus police, parole
authority, State Attorney General's Office, California
Department of Identification and Investigations (CII) as
well as county and municipal police.

A very close relationship with continuous exchange

Close contact is also maintained with 115th
Military Intelligence Group, Secret Service, Internal Revenue
Service; and all State and Federal agencies are contacted
immediately when information is received which should be
disseminated to them. Likewise, San Francisco's Liaison
contacts insure that any information of interest to the San
Francisco Division in the hands of local or Federal agencies
will be furnished to San Francisco Division without delay.

San Francisco participates in bi-weekly conferences
with intelligence agencies of the Army, Navy, and Air Force,
one purpose of which is to review the potential for racial

“violence. The San Francisco racial supervisor regularly
attends these conferences.

Very good relations are enjoyed by San Francisco
with all local and Federal law enforcement and intelligence
agencies. -

kK, Anytime a militant organization or group
appears to be taking shape or a legitimate group appears to
become militant a case is immediately opened on that organi-
zation. The first order of business then becomes the
development’ of an informant from among the group and/or the
infiltration of that group by an established source. All
Agents are alerted to the need and requested to cooperate.
It becomes the direct responsibility of the case Agent to
follow and assume that adequate live informant coverage is
available on the organization. When coverage decreases from
loss of an informant for some reason, the need is again pin-
pointed and all Agents are requested to assist with
suggested replacements. The assistance of all police agencies,
era and probation officers, State Attorney General's Office,
g Oo, Criminal and security informants is solicited in“ ~
attempting to fill in any gaps in informant coverage. Close
supervision is afforded informant development.



PART II. ADMINISTRATIVE ASPECTS

A. The racial informant control file in the San
Francisco Office is 170-22. A separate control file has been
opened to coordinate the development of a top level BPP infor-
mant (170-1030). The counterintelligence file is 157-601.

B, Individuals identified as members or affiliates of
racial extremist groups come primarily from live informants
and from the technical informant coverage. Channelizing
memoranda are prepared by Agents handling live informants,
the memoranda routed over the desk and new cases opened
promptly where warranted. Information originating from
technical coverage is reviewed daily by Agents who prepare
individual memoranda. These memoranda are routed across
the desk and new cases opened promptly.

The key racial extremists are kept in a pending
status. Information from all sources are channelized to
the files and these files are followed closely on tickler
to insure continuous investigative effort. 7

Cc. The primary responsibility for reporting to the
local police that information received from informants rests
with the case agent handling the informant. The Agent when
dictating the information received from informants remarks
that the information was given to the local police. The
supervisor when initialing the report for duplication checks
“to ascertain that proper dissemination has been made.

D. Agitator Index cards and Security Index cards are
current. Case Agents have primary responsibility and squad
supervisors reading reports and reviewing files on ticklers
check to determine whether individual names of Subjects
should be included on any index.

E. The Black Nationalist Photographic Album is main-
tained in the supervisor's office. Necessary changes are
routed to the Squad #9 secretary who makes the changes or
inserts the form into the album, and initials the accompanying
letter. Case is assigned to an agent for periodic review.

F. There are no active extremist organizations in San
Francisco Division in which the case agent has failed to
develop an informant. It is to be noted, however, that the
BPP case is assigned to SA RAYMOND N. BYERS who, because
of enormity of the investigation, acts only in a coordinator

NW 65360 Docld:32989637 Page 276 / 7 ,


capacity. The overall investigation is handled by the racial
squad and several informants have been Greece eae as indicated
in Part I, Sections B and E.

G. All Agents operating racial RReoraenes have been
advised to report all statistical accomplishments in the
eriminal field on FD-209's or contact memos and to flash same
for the attention of the racial supervisor. These memos or
FD-209's are then routed to the racial informant coordinator
for inclusion in the FD-305-B submitted monthly.

PART IIi. OUTSIDE INFLUENCE IN RACIAL ACTIVITIES (BPP)

The Legats and CIA have been continuously requested
to observe foreign activities of persons and groups sympathetic
to the BPP. Considerable material has been received relative
to such organizations as BPP Solidarity Committees.

i A close study is made of "The Black Panther"
newspaper for evidences of foreign ideology. 2

o All BPP bank accounts are regularly monitored to

| detect any possible foreign funding "O1 7 seaaet

The BPP does not have any indigenous philosophy,

i and has borrowed heavily from the writings of various

H world-wide revolutionary figures, particularly those from

i4 the Far East. However, except for repeating old Communist

\ cliches, the pulicy uf the BPP is Lasically oriented toward

the problems of the people of the ghetto streets, the lumpen

\q proletariat, as they call themselves. The BPP will accept

help, both physical and financial, from anyone desirous of

i donating. However, they seldom help anyone else and, in

fact, have engaged in an exchange of polemics with William
i, Negro spokesman for the CP, USA, which organi-

i ‘zation, in spite of a luke-warm effort to influence the BPP,

| - has had very little visible effect on the course of the

Party.

Informants have been alerted to report any such
influence and careful review of all material received from
technical coverage of the BPP is analyzed to insure any
information pertinent to this problem is reported.

Top level informants in the NOI report no outside |

Nw 65360| Docid:22980637-1 weg



B. The effect of New Left and Communist influence
on the BPP has been negligible. The BPP from the beginning
has been almost solely interested in the problems of the
community blacks, and while repeating Communist and/or
Socialist type slogans, have seldom rendered any assistance
to groups from these leftist organizations.

The BPP attorney is Charles, Garry, former CP, USA
member and leftist oriented thinker, who is, in all
probability, responsible for the leftist slant to BPP
publications, slogans, and teachings. The most prominent
instance of the cooperation between the BPP and the white
radical left came in the National Convention of the United
Front Against Fascism (UFAF) held in Oakland, California,
in July, 1969. Up to this time, the BPP had been an all-black
movement, having as allies such "cultural nationalists" as
Stokely, Seams ael, and JamesFormap, With the UFAF, it
appeared that ape new development was on hand, as CP, USA
and New Left leaders converged on the gathering and made
speeches. However, a split ensued between all groups, i.e.,
between the biacks and the whites, and petween certain
elements of the radical whites. The CP, USA fell out with
the New Left, the Jews criticized the BPP for its anti-
Israel stance, and the PLP attacked and was counter-attacked
by the others in the New Left. This grand design came
apart and eventually Eldridge Cleaver began writing of the
CP, USA in the past tense, and attacking Negro writers for
the "Daily World" and the "Guardian". He engaged in a
polemical discussion, in writing, with William Patterson,
Negro spokesman for the CP, USA. Thus, a year or more
later, it might be said that the BPP has little rapport
with the CP, USA and its exemplar, the CP, USSR. The
Soviet Union has received many criticisms in the pages of
‘The Black Panther" newspaper.

The New Left does maintain its relations with the
BPP, seeking Panther support in anti-war demonstrations,
and in such court cases as Los Siete de la Raza (six Chicanos
‘accused of killing a San Francisco policeman), the Soledad
brothers, (three Negroes accused of killing a prison guard),
and the Angela Davis, case, as examples. The Party seems
reluctant to get involved in any of these "causes", beyond
printing routine articles in its paper concerning these
activities.

PART IV. BLACK NATIONALIST MOVEMENT IN THE UNITED STATES

The Monthly Racial Calendar is posted on the bulletin
board in the Supervisor's office and all agents have been in-
structed to pay careful attention to the items listed thereon.
The calendar is also discussed in squad conferences and the
agents are briefed in order that they can take full advantage
of it.

With regard to the black extremist fugitives the
substantive cases are handled on the Criminal Fugitive Desk as
88 cases (Desk #2). There is close coordination between those
agents and agents handling racial matters and as an example of
this our technical informant coverage has established that the

Special Agent David E. Todd,

The following comments, observations and instructions” are
made on the basis of a review of the racial investigation
and informant files, an analysis of pertinent data furnished
by you, and discussion with supervisory and investigative
personnel handling racial matters:

RACIAL MATTERS ~ GENERAL
nes SAN FRANCISCO DIVISION

The general overall picture of racial matters in
your division is as follows:

Nine hundred and seventy pending racial matters

(includes informants) h. led by 23 Agents: 2 basic. black extremist
groups (the Black Panther Party [BPPj), Black Student Union

[BSU] and Nation of Islam [NOI] with 41 chapters or pads com-
prising a reported membership of 1,564 (1,198 are BSU); 9 funds
related to BPP traced; 51 institutions of higher education

with total enrollment of 272,970, number who are Negro and

other racial oriented extremists not identified; 6 ghettos

with a total population of 85,000; 2 black extremist
- newspapers with a circulation of 143,000 covered by 14 Racial
Informants (RI), 10 RI-Probationary (RI-Prob), Z28L, Ghetto
informants, who are primarily listening posts, plus 6, Confi-
dential Racial Sources, and 2 additional excellent sources,

- namely SF_3215-R* and SE 3259=R%; only 4.informants in

leadership position.

: Since the last inspection, 65 acts of violence
have occurred in the San Francisco Division which resulted
in 503 arrests, 103 police officers injured (civilian
injuries numerous, bit unknown), and 11 deaths. Targets
of violence included 9 institutions of learning, 9 Government
and military institutions, 3 utility and 15 commercial
establishments, 5 private residences, and 1 church, with total
‘estimated damage of $961,443. Included in the 65 acts of
violence were 50 bombing matters in, which_i ants of, the San.

Limited intelligence regarding stolen or stockpiling

California State Bureau of Criminal Identification and
Investigation disclosed approximately 27,375 guns stolen
per annum in the area covered by the San Francisco Office.
The extent of racial extremists involved in these thefts is
unknown, however, numerous thefts establish potential source
for racial militants to obtain weapons of violence.

Picea rots of counterintelligence, 4,fixed physical
ay ben: , along with 110 other physical surveillances,

“.were conducted in connection with BPP activities. The

numerous acts of violence and extensive damage to persons
and property is indicative of the absolute need for quality
in-depth informant coverage on all militant extremist groups.

: San Francisco is the most important office in connection
with the investigation of the BPP, whose National Headquarters
is located in two adjoining buildings in Oakland, California.
In addition, two other active chapters of the BPP are located
in San Francisco and Richmond, California. The San Francisco
Chapter has on its premises the National Distribution Office
of the BPP where the weekly newspaper, "The Black Panther," is
prepared. You have advised this paper has a circulation of
about 135,000 copies per week and is distributed throughout
the U.S. and abroad. As Office of Origin in the BPP investi-
gations, your office has the task of coordinating the
investigation of this extremely militant group for the whole
country, resulting in an extremely heavy paper load in the
somenietreea ys: handling of this investigation.

It is imperative that investigations concerning
this terroristic and militant organization be directed with
the utmost imagination and aggressiveness to insure that
the Bureau's responsibilities are fulfilled. The most
important goal for your office is to develop quality

‘member informants in order that the Bureau will be in
“possession of advanced information on all pertinent contem-
Plated acts of eee oar ragt oats group.

It is to be noted that there are schoois of higher
education located in each of the above-mentioned RAs.

In the past, there have been militant black student
groups at San Jose State College and San Jose City College,
the University of California at Berkeley, and San Francisco
State College. These groups have been influenced by or
have members who are extremists advocating violence-prone
activities. The RAs covering the varieus universities
throughout the San Francisco territory, as well as Headquarters
City Agents, must develop adequate sources and informants
in a position to report on black extremist involvement in
campus disorders. In this regard, make certain that campus
disorders are brought. to the Bureau's attention in accordance
with Bureau letter to all offices dated 1/31/69 captioned,

."Black Student Groups on College Campuses, Racial Matters".

The coverage in the above RAs regarding racial
matters points out the critical need for in-depth member
informant coverage in all of the above areas to insure that
you can accurately assess violence potential in the
San Francisco Division. Although you have indicated that
several of the BSU chapters have not been prone to violence
sr indicated any real militant activity, the potential remaing

adequate coverage of these groups is imperative.

. You have advised that since the last inspection,

the territory, covered by your office has experienced no

mass demonstrations, riots or confrontations of a racial
.fature. You characterized this period as an organizational
- drive for minorities other than blacks. The number of acts

of violence which have occurred in your division would

indicate that Negro militants could certainly have

participated in some of these acts and your office must

make certain that your coverage of extremist groups, whether

N
wi
s

NW65360_Docld:32989637 Page 286



organized or independent, receives an aggressive approach
in order that any participation by these individuals is
known to you prior to their participation in acts of violence.

‘Incidents which may not, on the surface, appear to be black

nationalist oriented could certainly provoke a reaction on
the part of extremists and lead to a civil disturbance in
ghetto areas. This is particularly true in situations

where: local police make an arrest in a ghetto area where

it does not take an incident of great magnitude to incite
a riot.

You have indicated that you have Avo, member
informants covering the NOI Temple in San Francisco, as
well as the NOI Temple in Oakland, Although the NOI does
not advocate racial violence, at present they follow the
line of preaching hatred tc the white race. You should .
remain alert to the need for excellent coverage of the NOI
and exert your efforts to improve your member coverage in
order to remain alert to all activities of this extremist

* group.

Counterintelligence

It is noteworthy that you have completed 28
counterintelligence projects since the last inspect
and currently have under submission to the Bureau for
approval. The acco iar eho have included successfully
cancelling a speech of BPP leader David ard and Attorne)
‘Char: me tn addition; “the scant one ae %

t >: sion of some, European. members,of, the

BPP. Imaginative ‘count intéllige ce proposals are
continually needed in order to disrupt and confuse not only
the BPP, but all other black extremist organizations and
activities within the San Francisco Division. It is
incumbent upon the personnel handling racial investigations
to be aware of the tremendous importance to recognize
opportunities to neutralize individual black extremists
or black extremist groups. The black extremists have
accelerated their terrorist tactics in recent months and
local police have borne the burden of their attacks. The
BPP, which is the vanguard of black extremism, has been
responsible for many of the attacks on police.

It appears that your attempt to compromise BPP
Breakfast Program Chairman bllis White, has had some success
and should be followed very closely in an attempt to
complete phase 2 of this operation.

INVESTIGATIONS OF BLACK EXTREMIST
ORGANIZATIONS AND INDIVIDUALS

All Special Agents handling racial matters
investigation should be familiar with instructions set
out in Bureau airtel to all offices dated 9/3/70, captioned
"Attacks on Police, Extremist Activity". You should insure
that instructions concerning the opening of cases in
accordance with this airtel are followed.

You should make certain that personnel handling
racial mativis are completely familiar with the airtel directed
by the Bureau to all offices dated 10/12/70 captioned
"Black Panther Party, Racial Matters - Black Panther Party".

It is imperative that you are promptly instituting
investigation of all black extremist organizations, as well
as those individuals who are openly advocating violence,
“anarchy or insurrection. These investigations must be
directed to promptly ascertain the aims and objectives,
as well as the identities of the leaders and members. The
extent of each group's involvement in the black nationalist
movement must be determined promptly. You must be aggressive
and imaginative, and these investigations should be
pursued with the purpose of developing evidentiary material
with a goal of prosecution.

The ever-present need to be alert for information
concerning revolutionary extremists who may be planning
hijacking of airplanes or kidnapping of government officials
should be impressed on all personnel. Make certain the
Bureau is promptly advised of all circumstances concerning
this more current and important area of our work. Agents
handling racial matters should be familiar with SAC Letter
70-18(C), which sets out guidelines for handling of bombings
or arsons which appear to have black extremist or New Left
connotations or modifications.

Jows5360-Decld:329a0637 Page zag BG



Make certain that personnel assigned to racial
matter investigations are entirely familiar concerning the
fact that active investigation of gun law violations
should be conducted when these violations directly relate
to any investigation of which the Bureau has primary
investigative jurisdiction. This is particularly. pertinent
to investigations concerning the BPP, as well as other
terroristic, extremist and hate groups.

Agents handling racial matters must be familiar
with SAC Letter 68-74 (D) dated 12/24/68, which instructs
that certain black extremists may be interviewed with SAC
authority. Further, you should continue to make certain that
where there are public rallies or demonstrations by extremists
that appropriate steps to record speeches made at these
gatherings by black extremists are being made. In this
regard, you should optain tape recordings of other speeches
made by extremists which are heard within your territory.

Agitator Index (AI)

: You have advised that you have 59 individuals
listed on the AI, of which 30 are affiliated with black

“extremist groups. Out of the 30, 15 are affiliated with

the BPP, including Charles R. Garry, BPP Attorney. Penetrative
and aggressive investigation Of black nationalist militant
groups, as well as continued effective attention to white
hate groups, should result in the increase of individuals

. placed on the AI. You should make certain that personnel

recommending subjects for the AI also consider their
inclusion on the Security Index when they possess | re
necessary criteria.

Racial Informants

As office of origin for the BPP, you : have a
eritical responsibility for developing informants in this
group who are knowledgeable concerning the overall activities
of the BPP throughout the United States and especially
knowledgeable concerning the activities of the BPP within
your division. You have made some progress in developing
informants in the BPP. However, this progress is limited
and, there is an urgent need for development of additional
quality informants in this organization. The immediate

. need for informants in the racial field was shown earlier
in this write-up where it was indicated that numerous acts
of violence have occurred in your division since the last
inspection in which you were unable to furnish information
as to the participants or whether or not the violence was
racial oriented. A particular weakness on the part of San
cee has been to develop informants in the upper echelon

exship, of the BPP who can furnish information concerning.

eee of BPP finances and overall day-to-day activities
in the BPP offices.

An example of San Francisco's weakness concerning
informant coverage is noted in your file 157- = 5822. which

The increase in the number of racial informants

is noteworthy and this desirable trend should be continued.

Whe difference between the Bureau records and the above

racial informants and the closing of some ghetto informants.
The development of sources, particularly in the Resident
Agency territories where so many institutions of higher
education are locatéd, is an urgent need of the San Fran-
cisco Division. The favorable growth in the number of ghetto
informants is noteworthy and necessary if the substantial
need to increase the number of RIs and:RI (probs) is met by
your office.

Each of your racial informants and your probationary
racial informants were rated and you have been advised
individually of these ratings, which are set forth as follows

Racial
Informants

The need for additional: quality informant coverage
cannot be over~emphasized, particularly since you have
several areas that have experienced acts of violence where
there are no racial informants and racial informant probationaries,
Although you have indicated ghetto informants have been
developed in some of these areas, you recognize that these
informants are primarily listening posts and have not been able
to furnish the quality intelligence information that is
needed for the Bureau to fulfill its responsibilities in
the racial field. You should insure that this matter of
developing quality racial informants is immediately brought
to the attention of all Resident Agents and efforts chould he
made to reverse this undesirable situation.

During this inspection, you were advised separately
by "trend memoranda" concerning certain delinquencies in the
handling of racial informant files. It is most important
that Agents handling racial matter informants be completely
familiar: with Bureau instructions and that these instructions

- are followed explicitly. Make certain that all Agents are
giving their informants assignments and are alert for
evidentiary-type information, as well as intelligence-type
information. Due to the sensitivity of informant files,
you should continue to insure that these files are being
afforded complete security and that personnel having access
are mature individuals who can be expected to maintain
them under the most secure conditions.

With respect to your ghetto informants, insure
they are being given’ assignments, including attendance
at public meetings held by extremists, survey of
extremist book stores, verification of residence and
employment of AI and SI subjects living or working in
ghetto areas, identity of’ extremists agitating in local
areas and information concerning youth gangs operating
in neighborhoods in such a fashion as to increase racial tension.

NW 65360 Docld:32989637 Page 292 / $3 ,



-12 +

You should remain alert to the fact that ghetto
informants, in view of their unique positions in usually
high-crime areas and since black extremists are involved
in criminal activities, should also be obtaining criminal’
statistics in addition to racial-type information. In
this connection, San Francisco, only five months out of
the last 17 months, has furnished criminal statistics
achieved through RIs, which includes ghetto informants.

The field average in submitting criminal statistics from
racial informants is 8 out of 17. Your office should devise
a workable prograth wherein all criminal statistics achieved
through racial informants are properly recorded and racial
informants are given proper assignments.

In addition, make certain that personnel handling

racial informants are uiiligzing the Black Extremist Fugitive

{ - List in connection with the National Photograph Album.

| Special Agents should be familiar with the instructions

| set out in Bureau letter to all field offices dated 8/29/70,
captioned "Black Extremist Activities in Penal Institutions,

this is essential for evidence to be used in connection

certain you continue to give your informants proper direction
so that full value can be obtained from their potential.

SES21sR(pmob), and SE 3056-R appear to have
potential for obtaining valuable racial information, as
well as evidentiary information. It is imperative that
these informants be utilized in such a way that their
potential value is consummated.

Stockpiling of Weapons and Ammunition

Your control file 157-3021 captioned "BPP ~
WEAPONS AND EXPLOSIVES", and 157-1171, “Stockpiling of
Arms and Ammunition", were reviewed and indicate that
these matters receive almost daily attention from SF32) 5=Ri se
It is imperative that all agents are constantly made aware
of the tremendous importance of these matters and the need
for quality informants to provide information in this
field. During the current inspection, a timely example
of the need for informants in this particular area was
noted when the Oakland Police Department recovered a cache
of weapons and explosives which included 20 sticks of dynamite,
two dozen fire grenades, four grass grenades, two fragmentation
_grenades, three machine guns, including a .50 caliber military
weapon, and other guns and explosives, They were recovered
on 10/27/70, at the 55th Avenue Motel in Oakland.

Further, another timely example during the
eurrent inspection occurred when five individuals were
arrested on a military reservation in your territory while
doing target practice, including one using a rifle that was
determined to be stolen from the military, These individuals
were identified as former BPP members and associates. Again,
the demand and absolute necessity for quality in-depth :
informants to apprise you of the individuals maintaining
weapons of violence is apparent. .

NW 65360 Docld:329896. ‘age



Make certain that all informants, both in the
vacial and criminal field, are properly alerted concerning
thefts of weapons of violence in an attempt to determine
if they are being stolen by individuals connected with
extremist activities. ‘

Observations
The BPP is noted for its terroristic nature

and philosophy of violence. Never in our history have
we been confronted with as critical a need for informant
coverage in such a violence-oriented organization. Bombings,
kidnappings, murder of police officers are all included in
the violence performed by these militant fanatics. The
ever spiraling crime rate, particularly in the ghetto,
has provided additional fuel for the militant and malcontent.
The racial situation is extremely serious and presents a
perplexing domestic problem which cannot be over stressed,
The vital role of the Bureau's personnel in the racial field
is pressing and apparent. The Bureau is constantly being
judged by our ability to develop timely intelligence, to
identify the leaders, the direction of movement of all
radical groups and, where possible, to predict potential
trouble spots. To fulfill these grave responsibilities,
we must have an efficient wide-spread network of intelligent,
resourceful, aggressive, and quality informants and sources,
The informant inadequacies which have been brought to your

attention should be rectified as quickly as possible and
all personnel should continually be alerted to the need
! : for "member" informants so that all information relating
: to potential violence will be brought to the Bureau's

attention.

“NUY"65380—Docld:32989637 Rage 205


‘lL. All Agents of your office, regardless.of
their assignments, must be aware of the urgent need for the
development of an informant network which can provide accurate,
timely and advanced information concerning the black extremists.
Primary needs for informant coverage within the San Francisco
Division is” ins the area of developing a_live o:

Op: the Panthers, In In this regard, recently
developed ghetté in informant DEBBIE NORMAN AdJ0>1084) appears

to be a likely prospect for “this © assignment. You are
instructed to closely follow this informant in an aggressive

and imaginative manner in an attempt to accomplish coverage

Within, BRP HEaGIuacterson :

2. In-depth member informants of the black
extremists are absolutely necessary. In this regard you
are instructed to intensify your interview program and
exert aggressive action to satisfy the urgent need for
informants in the upper echelon on OF BRE. leadership.

3. You should immediately designate informants
on the peripheral of the BPP for priority attention inasmuch
as BPP membership may open up at any time and should have
some informants ready to move in. In this regard, current
- BPP member informants should be designated for direction
“to move into leadership positions should such positions
develop,

4, You should aggressively pursue the potential
for BPP informants through the infiltration of Panther
pads. An individual properly directed covld possibly be
accepted in the pad which could not only provide coverage
but lead to a BPP leadership position.

5. Investigation of all pads and community
centers in your division should be followed closely to make
certain that the black extremists are identified and
investigated in accordance with Bureau instructions.

6. Make certain that all informants are alerted
to the theft of weapons of violence in order that your office
and the Bureau can be promptly advised of extremists involved
in potential acts of violence.

NW 65360 Docid:32989637 Page 296 . i

7. The necessity for complete informant coverage
is apparent and you should immediately instruct that where
black extremist groups, including the Black Student Union,
is located in your territory without coverage that efforts
be made to correct this deficiency at once. In this regard,
the recent change in Bureau policy permitting interviews of
individuals under 21 years of age should be made known to
all personnel handling these matters in an attempt to increase
your informant coverage.

8. You should continue your counterintelligence
program and be alert to any new schemes you might submit to
the Bureau for approval to use in this regard.

: 9. You should consider the placing of all black
extremist fugitives now handled on the criminal squads on
the desk of the Racial Matters Supervisor. Further in this
regard, you must make certain that all black extremists
who are subjects of substantive cases on criminal desks
are coordinated with the Racial Matters Desk.

10. You are further instructed to make the
Monthly Racial Calendar available to all Agents in the San
Francisco Office as well as the Black Fugitive Extremist List.

Agents contacting informants outside of normal working
hours obtained supervisory approval for these contacts
prior to making them and make appropriate notations on
their #3 cards. Supervisors thereafter, during file
reviews with Agents, check with them regarding those
contacts and spot-check informant files to insure after-
hour contacts were made and appropriately recorded.

PROGRAM DEVELOPMENT -

i.

The overall objectives of the criminal informant program
are to develop high quality informants who are in a
position to furnish valuable information on a continuing
basis. 7

Criminal desk supervisors participate in the program by
remaining alert to the necessity of having good informant
coverage in the criminal classifications which are covered
by their respective desks, The supervisor is also
required to approve any expenditure made to an informant

NW 65360 Docld:37989637 Page 304 / SE .



~7-

for information or services concerning| any case
handled on his desk and in this way willl be aware of the
progress of the program as it relates to their desk,

The supervisors also follow the Agents’ activities in
this regard on an individual basis to insure that they
are fully participating in the informant program,

ieee 2. The San Francisco.Office does have standards which
requires all Agents assigned one year or more to this
division should conform to and that is they should have
a minimum of four PCIs or one CI and two PCIs or two
CIs assigned at any one time. This, of course, is by
no means considered a maximum and many Agents
participate more fully in the program,

There are currently no first office agents assigned to
this division and when an Agent is transferred to this
division and assigned to criminal work he is expected
to show some progress by the end of sixty days and
within one year he is expected ta be in compliance
with the above standards. :

Regarding the Government reservations, it is noted
that specific liaison assignments have been made in regard
.to these but inasmuch as persons normally contacted on these
bases are Government employees contacted on an official
basis, they are not considered appropriate for development
as CIs and are bound to furnish information as part of
their duties. It is noted, however, that the Hunters -Point
Naval Shipyard is in a predominantly Negro area and two
PRIs, 170-845 and 170-241, are under development at that
location by SAs assigned to this squad.

Regarding the air piracy and crime aboard aircraft
violations, it is noted all major airports are located within
Resident Agency territories and coverage at these locations
will be covered there.

Selective Service matters and have been instructed to develop
informants that will be of assistance in this classification.

It is also pointed out that this desk has numerous
subjects that fall in the radical left and Black militant
category. Anytime these subjects, when interviewed, appear
to be cooperative in any degree their names and addresses
are furnished to the appropriate desk for consideration as
development to an informant.

Members of this squad continually endeavor to

and around the headquarter city of Santa Rosa, California
(Sonoma County). Informant coverage has been established
in the legalized cardrooms and night clubs in this area.

Coverage in the counties of Mendocino and Lake is
limited to the close personal relationship with deputy
sheriffs that cover the remote areas of these counties, which
principal industries: are logging and ranching.

! There are no principal targets for informant
development, such as shipping companies, railroads, airports,
or large industries. Coverage has been established in

WALNUT CREEK RA

‘ Criminal investigations in the Walnut Creek RA are
handled by SAs RUDOLPH H. MANCINI and FRANKLIN S. BURROUGHS.
This RA covers a territory which consists of
several large “bedroom" communities and a large section that
is rural in nature.

The only problem high crime rate area in the
territory is-the City of Pittsburg, which is a Negro ghetto-
type area and specific efforts have been made to develop
i informant coverage in this area. The following informants

have been developed and furnish general criminal and racial

4, Yes, in line with the answer to question two above,
agents are expected to submit a replacement at the
earliest possible date.

5. Supervisors participate in the informant program in that
they must approve all expenditures to informants furnishing
information in classifications handled on their respective

NW 65360 Docld:32989637 Page 317 | CF i eee

| desks. In this way they are aware of the productivity
of the informant program as it concerns them. Also,
if there is any particular problem concerning the
handling of a particular informant, a supervisor is
expected to assist and give guidance to the agent

, handling this particular informant. Supervisors are
also regularly reminded of the importance of the
informant program at supervisors! conferences and follow
their individual agents to insure that they are fully
participating.

Supervisors in this office are not required to approve
either closing or opening memoranda on informant files.
No record is kept of productivity ofinformants by
desks, however, this information is readily available
through the monthly statistical letter submitted on
informant production inasmuch as each fees is
reported by classification.

6. Agents are reminded of the criminal infs & program
and their responsibility to participate in it at each
biweekly squad conference.

7. Informant statistics are not kept by RA or road trip
territory, however, this information would be available
if it were necessary to obtain it by review of the
particular informant files that are providing coverage
in these areas. Our informant coverage in each RA
area is considered adequate at this time and no particular
weaknesses are noted. However, efforts are made on a
continuing basis to try to improve coverage in all
areas.

8. It is felt that informant coverage at Headquarters City
is adequate at this time, but as indicated innumber
seven above, a continuing effort is made to _improve this
coverage.

Regarding the coverage provided by each criminal desk,
it is noted that as of October 12, 1970, the following
CIs and PCIs are being handled off the respective desks:

The classifications handled by the above listed desks

9, Administrative devices used to make certain agents are
making maximum contributions to the criminal informant
program are that the agents are followed on an individual
basis through file reviews and supervisor conferences to
insure they are meeting the criteria as set forth in
question number two above. The criminal informant files
are also specifically reviewed on a semi-annually basis

7 at the time the semi-annual LiMs are submitted to the

| Bureau. It is also noted files are checked at the time
they are posted on a continuing basis.

10. Informant files are reviewed at the end of the first
year they have been opened on an individual basis and
if they have been unproductive the agent is advised to
close the case and replace the PCI with anew one.

| If the PCI has been productive the agent, handling him
is advised to convert him to a criminal informant. If
| it is a questionable matter it is discussed with the
| agent handling the PCI on an individual basis and a
| decision is reached in this matter inasmuch as the
| agent is in a better position to make the judgement as
to the potential of this particular PCr.

11. All agents in the San Francisco Division are aware of
- the racial and ghetto informant program through
participation. If an agent has a case that he feels
warrants contacting of ghetto informants he will
dictate a memorandum setting forth specifically that
they should be contacted by the edad agents
handling them.

H 12. No actual record is kept of how much use is made of
the geographical criminal informant index. However, it
was proved to be a valuable tcol in determining whe

the logical informants are to contact in any given
situation. This has saved many investigative hours by
making easily available to each agent the particular
type of informant coverage he might need.

ADDENDUM 7)
INSPECTOR ARNOLD’C. LARSON
10/27/70 | 7 ; ,

ne v
All criminal informant (CI) files and a representative

number of potential criminal informant (PCI) files weré reviewed

during this inspection. Following review, a memorandum 7

disclosing the rating afforded in each file has been forwarded
to you for inclusion in the respective file.

Your office is currently operating 145 CIs as
compared to 141 CIs being operated at the time of the last
inspection. There is also an increase in the number of PCIs

| under development at this time to 271 as opposed to 250 under
development dusing the Last inspection. These figures do not |
include Top Echelon informants or targets for development
which are commented on separately under the Criminal Intelligence
Program. This represents a slight increase in the number of
CIs and a more substantial increase in the number of PCIs
under development. However, there is a slight decrease in
two large metropolitan areas, namely, San Francisco and Oakland,
. which though slight represents a static situation as to
. increasing coverage in these areas. The Oakland Resident
Agency has also recorded a decrease in the number of PCIs
under development. In analyzing the coverage in the resident
agencies, it was noted that Monterey, Richmond and San Jose
have the same coverage from CIs as during the last inspection
although Monterey and San Jose have shown a substantial
increase in the number of PCIs being handled. PCIs under
development in Salinas and San Rafael are down somewhat,
although this too in part is off-set by the increase in the
number of CIs being operated. In view of the Bureau's
increased responsibilities, it is absolutely essential that
a strong criminal informant program be maintained and in
fact expanded if the Bureau is to meet these increased
responsibilities.

QUALITY
All of the CI files were reviewed during this

inspection and the following ratings were given to the CIs
presently being operated by this office:

information principally as a result of his employment in
the U.S. Army, Personnel Center, Oakland, California Army
Base, this informant should be discontinued as a.CI and
converted to a Confidential Source. SF 2290-C was recently
reopened on the basis of having provided a service to
Department of Justice attorneys and the Bureau but has furnished
no criminal information for an extended period of time and
had been in a closed status since 3/10/69. This informant
should also be discontinued as a CI and considered as a
Confidential Source. You should appropriately advise the
Bureau that this action has been taken.

The following informants have been rated Fair and
they should be given specific assignments for a period of
90 days in an attempt to improve their productivity. At
the end of that period of time you should advise the Bureau
of reasons for continuing them as informants or that they
are being discontinued.

PAYMENTS
A review of payments indicates that your office
paid an average of $1,473.98 a month to informants during
the period immediately preceding the last inspection. For
the period immediately preceding this inspection, an average
of $1,643.10 was paid to informants each month. A spot
check of payments made to CIs and PCIs indicated value was
being received for the money paid. You should insure that
your personnel are alert to the use of monetary payments to
enlist the on of informants by compensating
them for expenses incurred n pursuit of information for

this Bureau and as compensation for their effort on the
Bureau's behalf. You should continue to closely evaluate
informant payments to insure that value is received for money
paid.

: attributable to informants and it is noted that these
7 increases have occurred in paneled concerned directly with FBI
investigations. :

PROGRAM DEVELOPMENT

You have indicated a rather extensive involvement
of supervisory personnel in directing informant development to
those areas of responsibility coming within the scope of
their respective desks. Referring to Government reservations
and military installations, you indicated you do not
consider Government employees appropriate for development as
CIs as they are bound to furnish information as part of
their duties. Your attention is specifically directed to

eee



Section 108, I-12, Volume 4, Manual of Instructions, which
states informants should be developed on Government
reservations and military installations when warranted. In
view of the large installations located within your territory,
it is suggested you identify particular areas of these
installations wherein informant coverage would be logical

and productive and give consideration to pinpointing such areas
for development.

You have also indicated that Supervisors approve
payments to informants and in this way are also aware of the
productivity of the informant program. However, it is noted
that approval of payments provides a rather limited
assessment of the productivity of informants and points out
the need for a continuing evaluation of respective coverage.
Supervisors must constantly be alert to identify specific
areas in which informant coverage would be logical and
productive.

* OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

You should give consideration to the development
of informants on Government reservations and military

_ installations as suggested by the Manual of Instructions.

In a number of instances, it was noted there was
no follow-up on incomplete information furnished by informants.
In such instances, the informant was not recontacted any
sooner than required by the 30 day contact rule, which would
indicate a lack of direction of the informant to further
develop information of interest. The need to give informants
direction to develop information to the point it can be
considered useful and valuable should be brought to the
attention of all appropriate investigative personnel.
:
' There were few instances noted during review of .
the CI files wherein FD-302's had been utilized in recording
informant information. It is recognized that much information
regarding fugitives and possible suspects does not require

NW 65360" Docld:32989637_Page 325 /7 é



- -
|

such recording but in view of the recent passage of Senate
Bill 30 which will greatly expand the opportunity to utilize
informant information, you should make certain all personnel
are aware of those instances in which informant information
should be recorded on an FD-302 and the proper method for so
recording it. :

!
Numerous areas have been identified in your
territory as being the habitat of ethnic, ghetto and hippie
elements, many with a high incidence of crime. To provide
a better over-all view of the coverage in San Francisco and
the ‘heavily populated East Bay area and to facilitate a more
convenient, ready reference for the agents of your office to
this information, you should consider preparing a large wall
map of the San Francisco - East Bay area and placing it in a
central secure position in the office. In addition to criminal
informants, you should include the location in which racial
and ghetto informants will logically be able to furnish
information and you should identify the location of all these
informants on the map with an appropriate locator reference
to an index showing the agent to whom the intormant is
assigned and the coverage which informant can be expected to
provide.

several PCIs including one who previously was the prime

for the murder of a police officer. This PCI has since
furnished information of value which was relayed to the
local police in a burglary case. He has been given the
assignment to develop further information concerning local

| In the past year I have been unable

and other PCIs due to having been utilized as Relief
Supervisor in the absence of the regular supervisor and
because of the time necessary. to prepare and present lectures
at police schools on legal matters. :

I am aware of the importance of the
Criminal Informant Program and will continue efforts to
develop a qualified Criminal Informant and expect to
qualify the above-mentioned PCI in the very near future.

SA CARLTON H. WOLFARTH: I am extremely aware| of the need to
10/28/70 * develop CIs and have had a total of
CHW s ekk ‘ nine PCIs in San Francisco during the
time I have been in San Francisco.

I arrived in the San Francisco Division,
7/13/69, on transfer from the Chicago Division. It is to be noted
that I developed CG 7215¢ in 1967. This informant had either
worked for or was close to the top men of organized crime in Chicago,
Miami and New Orleans. At cone time, through a:court order, this
informant was wired with a micrephone and tape recorder so
information could be obtained in an Obstruction of Justice case.
T had at least one other informant while I was handling the
above informant, and handled both until leaving Chicago.

The potential of the four PCIs which I
opened on 8/2),/70 and the one which I opened 10/19/70 appears
promising and it is anticipated that at least one will develop

i into a CI in the near future. :

: My assignments in San Francisco hive
been mainly ITSP - FBW investigations which are complicated and
involve reviewing records and interviews with banks, brokerage
house and other business officials, TI had one excellent
opportunity to develop a good CI when LOUIS MARDER, Las Vegas
furnished me on 2/27/70 and 3/2/70 the original information which
led to the recovery of $650,000 worth of Aveo Thrift Certificates
at Las Vegas, MARDER as recently as 10/27/70, furnished me
valuable information. He cannot be developed into a GI because
he lives in Las Vegas and is under Federal indictment in Miami.

supervisory personnel to surpass the prior year's accomplish-
ments in all four categories of convictions; fines, savings,
and recoveries; fugitives apprehended; and automobiles
recovered.

The Bureau by letter dated 7/13/70 called this
to your attention and pointed out that each SAC must
exhibit aggressive sound leadership in the future. It
pointed out that failure to meet this challenge reflects
most unfavorably upon the SAC's ability as an administrator
and an FBI official. The SAC was instructed to take
immediate steps to analyze the investigative and supervisory
programs and take corrective action where necessary.

As will be noted for the first three months of
the current fiscal year (FY), your convictions are deficient
by 37% as are your fines, savings, and recoveries. This
is a continuation of a most undesirable trend.

In analyzing the lack of convictions, it was
noted that you had a decline in the Theft From Interstate
Shipment classification of 39% in fiscal year .1970, and
a continuation of this downward trend during the first
three months of the current FY. In the Selective Service
category during the first three months of FY 1971 you
obtained only 9 convictions as compared with 21 in the
prior year for a decline of 57%. This number of convictions
seems very low when considering the fact that as of 9/30/70
you had pending in this office 2257 cases in this category.

During first three months of current FY there has
been a decline of ‘87% in the ITSMY category (1 vs 8) and
a decline of 86% in the Theft of Government Property classi-
fication (1 vs 7). In addition, no convictions were obtained
as of 9/30/70 in the Interstate Transportation of Stolen
Property category and you had pending in the office 307
cases.

Your accomplishments seem very low for your investment
- in manpower.

It was noted that as of 10/1/70 there were no
vacancies with respect to Federal judges, U. S. Attorneys,
or Assistant U. S. Attorneys, which might reflect unfavorably
upon your statistical picture. You advised the Bureau
that you had 352 subjects under indictment and several
hundred Selective Service cases pending prosecution which
indicates you may have the potential for correcting this
situation before the end of the year.

Comments of following supervisors are requested

in this important category of operations. Every effort will

be made to make certain that we do fulfill our responsibilities
and that we show an increase in all four categories of
statistical accomplishments as soon as possible and definitely

suprHiftoress: Concerning the decline of Selective Service
10/28/70 statistical accomplishments for the first
three months of 70-71 as compared to 63-70,
it will be noted that in an endeavor to expedite these
matters through the U.S. District Courts, a conference was
held on February 26, 1970, with the U.S. Attorney for the
Northern District of California at San Francisco, Mr. James L.
Browning, representatives of the California State Selective
Service System, the local Selective Service System and
three members of the U.S. Department of Justice. Continual
weekly contacts are made with the U.S. Attorney to expedite
these matters and again on July 10, 1970, a conference was
held which included the U.S. Attorney, San Francisco, the
Director of the California State Selective Service System
and the Director of the National Selective Service System,
Mr. Curtis Tarr, along with attorneys for the national
Selective Service System and representatives of the U.S.
Department of Justice. These matters are followed closely
with a minimum of two contacts a week being made with the
U.S. Attorney. It will be noted that many of these matters
have been postponed as many as six to eight times in U.S.
District Court and several conferences have been had with
former Chief U.S. District Court Judge George B. Harris, and
on 10/15/70 U.S. Attorney James L. Browning discussed these
matters with the new Chief U.S. District Court Judge of San
Francisco, Oliver B. Carter. Every effort has been made
through sources available to this office to expedite these
matters in U.S. District Court. It will be noted that as of
10/14/70 the San Francisco Office had 414 outstanding
.indictments. 57 of these are fugitives that are out of the
country and since that date, on October 14, 15 and 21, 1970,
an additional 39 indictments have been obtained giving a total
of 453 outstanding indictments. The total Selective Service
matters presently awaiting Federal Grand Jury action is 749.
The decline in statistics in the Selective Service category is
due to the lack of action on the part of the U.S. District
Court Judges due to the lack of enthusiasm and the coddling
of these cases by the U.S. District Court Judges. It will
be noted that several of these cases have been under submission
to U.S. District Court Judge CARTER for over one year. I will
continue close aggressive liaison with the U.S. Attorney and
U.S. District Courts and endeavor to increase the statistical
accomplishments in this category.

10/28/70 been a decline of 87% in ITSMV
classification (1 vs. 8) anda

decline of 86% in the TGP classification (1 vs. 7). These

two classifications are supervised by me on Desk 3 of this
office.

: The following tabulations are set forth below which
set out the convictions of this desk from 7/1/70 to 10/16/70,
the date the inspection commenced, as compared with a like

. One of the main reasons for reduction in convictions

. in the 26 classification this year over last year is the
Departmental guidelines pertaining to ITSMV matters. The
combination of the 52-70 convictions this year is 18, as
compared with 13 last year. I realize that the 26 and 52
convictions independently are below last year, but every
effort is being made to achieve and thereafter exceed the
goal set during the preceding year.

I constantly stress to those Agents in Headquarters
and the Resident Agencies which cover sources of 52 matters,
government reservations, transport facilities (shipment of
government property), to be constantly alert to obtain those
matters which should be investigated by the FBI.

In addition, I would like to point out that I will
continue to take ail necessary steps to exceed this year in
the statistical accomplishments of this squad over the
previous year.

I would like to point out that I have taken the
necessary steps and will continue to do so in compliance with

Bureau instructions to streamline the ITSMV matters and handle

only those that are fully justified and at the same time
pursue those that are justified towards convictions.

SUPERVISOR GLENN A. HARTER:

ITSP Matters ‘

There was a gain in ITSP matters 6f one conviction
in fiscal year 1970 (seven) over fiscal year 1969 (six).

On 9/24/70, the San Francisco Office obtained one
conviction in the ITSP field (BUfile 87-111262, SFfile 87-31516).
We have every reason to believe therewill be a large per-
centage increase in statistical accomplishments in the ITSP
field for fiscal year 1971. We have a large amount of quality
eases offering an excellent potential for statistical accomplish-
ments. At the present time we have four individuals indicted
in the 87- category. Additionally, we have eleven other
subjects wherein we believe indictments will be obtained.

Two of thesematters have already been discussed with the USA,
who has indicated he will seek indictments. Additionally,
we have two 87- cases awaiting pleas under Rule 20 in other
field offices.

In view of the above, we anticipate that we will
have at least seventeen convictions in the 87- field by the
end of the fiscal year 1971, plus any other cases that might
be reported to us. There is every reason to believe in 1971
that we will not only equal but considerably exceed the
statistical accomplishments that we obtained in 1970. As
noted above, we expect at least double the amount of
convictions obtained last year.

Mention should be made here to accurately present
“the accomplishments of the squad in this category that as a
‘yesult of information obtained and developed by one of the
-agents, the Las Vegas Office was able to recover $650,000
.of Avco thrift certificates (BUfile 87-108171, SFfile 87-30355).

7 TFIS Matters

| The decline in convictions in this category has been

;a matter of great concern, and every effort is being made to
-veverse this situation. The Bureau has been kept advised in
‘detail of this situation. This decline in convictions during

, fiscal year 1970 was a direct result of a change of policy

!in the USA's office concerning the prosecution of these cases.
The high volume of convictions obtained by the San Francisco

* Office in past years was attributable to the policy of taking

“Docld:32989637_Page 336



petty offenders before the USC on the day that they were ap-
prehended’ and on that same day they would usually be sentenced
after a guilty plea. The USA's office noted in a letter dated
7/11/69 that a review by their office of cases presented to
, them in past years disclosed that almost none of the offenses
involved TFIS thefts where the value of the goods exceeded
$100 and that over 95 per cent of the cases referred to the
USA by the FBI had been handled by the USC under the Assimilative
Crimes Act. The USA's office has recently had mnferences
with the San Francisco PD and the San Francisco District
Attorney and has informed them of their policy not to prosecute
minor thefts of cases involving less than $100 and has urged
the San Francisco PD and District Attorney to accept and
handle these cases. ;

At the time of the current inspection, the San
Francisco Office has obtained eleven convictions compared to
twelve convictions obtained last year at this time. Although
we are down one conviction o ed to last year at this.
time, there is every reason lieve that we will exceed
last year's accomplishments, as we have some good cases
pending prosecution.

- As noted above, the type of case we are handling
now as compared to those in the past, is one that is more
likely to produce a high recovery value,-and it should be
noted that the amount recovered to date during the current
fiscal year is $159 ,000, as compared to $6,000 last year.

I have personally discussed the prosecution of
TFIS cases with USA JAMES BROWNING, as well as several of
his assistants, pointing out the need for prompt indictment
and prosecution. The Bureau is aware, of course, of the
change in personnel of the USA's office, including the USA.
peek ata reason for the fact that we have not exceeded last
year's number of convictions is the cases currently pending
prosecution have been assigned and re-assigned several tmes
to different AUSAs, as there has been a.large turnover in
their staff. There are currently three new attorneys which
handle the majority of these prosecutions, none who have
been in office more than several months, and as the files will
reflect in those cases offering a potential for prosecution,
they have stated they have not as yet had an opportunity to
review the case, since it had just been recently assigned to
them. USA BROWNING has advised that he is making every :
effort to obtain faster indictments and subsequent prosecution

| NW65360_Nocid:37989G7 Pages SK


:32989637 Page 338 .

of these cases, and he hopes with additional experience on
his part and on the part of his staff that cases will be
handled in a more expeditious manner.

‘Additionally, I have personally called upon local
businessmen in the transporation industry whoiare a source
of these cases, as well as having had frequent discussions

: with local police and District Attorney LOWELL JENSEN of
Alameda County and Chief Criminal Deputy H.F. CLIFFORD
of San Francisco County, in order to apprise them of the
Bureau's policy and obtain more cooperation in these matters.

As noted above, we are only one conviction behind
our record of last year at this time and most definitely
feel that we will exceed our number of convictions obtained
in fiscal 1970. I base this optimistic forecast on the fact
that the tremendous expenditure of Squad#S agent time last
year in connection with civil rights cases will not be
duplicated in fiscal 1971 and that this tremendous amount of
investigative time can be directed toward securing additional
statistical accomplishments in those classifications handled
by Squad #5.

General Observations

In order to accurately present an over~all picture
of the accomplishments of Squad #5, it should be noted that in
fiscal year 1970 nine convictions were obtained in the 43-
classification against four for the previous:fiscal year,
and we have obtained one so far this fiscal year.

Additionally, much of the efforts of this squad have
been directed towards the handling of the civil rights cases
which grew out of the People's Park riots in Berkeley in 1969.
Currently indicted are twelve Alameda County sheriff deputies
and former deputies. It is estimated approximately 800 to 1000
interviews have een conducted by the squad in. connection
with the civil rights cases, all of which have had very short
period deadlines. .The USA has just commended this office by
letter dated 10/21/70 for the extremely able investigative
efforts and other assistance given to the USA's office. These
trials are currently scheduled. One took place in October;
another is scheduled for 11/2 and the tremendous amount of time
and attention give to these civil rights cases has taken
that investigative time away from other classifications
that might be more productive statistically.

Concerning the fact that the office is currently
deficient under the category fines, savings and recoveries,

/87.



{

it should be pointed out herethat a report has been submitted
to the Bureau wherein a recovery value of sixty million
dollars was claimed, which added to the fines, savings and
recoveries, will put the office well ahead of last year in
this category. (BUfile 44-23710, SFfile 44-842). \

BANK ROBBERY SURVEY

‘

Inspector bles Cc. Pee Information concerning the bank
10/27/70 fii robbery survey supplied by the
ia San Francisco Office is reported

in Section 4-M-l’of the work papers of this inspection.

The following observations and comments regarding bank
robbery matters are based upon a review of all pending origin
- eases, a selection of closed and auxiliary office cases,
related control files, discussions with appropriate personnel
assigned to these cases, and a review of the techniques and
procedures used by this office. :

SOLUTIONS

According to Bureau records the San Francisco
Office from July 1, 1968, through September 30, 1970, had
a total of 356 violations of the Federal Bank Robbery Statute
consisting of 311 robberies, 23 burglaries, and 22 larcenies.

Of these viPlations 227 robberies, 13 burglaries,
and 14 larcenies for a total of 254 are solved. During this
. same period, 31 additional violations of the Statute which
occurred prior to 7/1/68 were also solved.

As of 3/30/70, there are 77 robberies, 3 burglaries,
and 5 larcenies pending unsolved in the San Francisco
Office. Of these, 8 robberies and one larceny occurred
prior to 7/1/68. A comparative tabulation of violations
and solutions which occurred during the period of the last
inspection and current inspection are set out below:

“Last Inspection Period; Current Inspection Period;
{ July, 1968 to July 2, 1969 July 2, 1963 to October, 1970
- 76 of 130 (58.5%) 7 142 of 190 (75%)
- 0 of 8 (0%) 8 of 13 (61%)
- 3 of 5 (62%) 7 ll of 16 (68%)
- 79 of 143 (55.1%) 161 of 219 (74%)

Docld:32989637 Page 340 (at



As veflected in the tabulation above, your

| overall solution rate of bank robbery matters since last
inspection has increased 19% which is a very favorable

‘trend. This solution rate is indicative of the conscientious
effort made by Agents of the San Francisco Office in this
most important area of the Bureau's responsibilities. You
should insure that all investigative and supervisory personnel
continue this effort to effect solutions in these cases.

The 86 unsolved cases in the San Francisco
Office will require continuous aggressive, imaginative
effort inasmuch as experience has shown that as time passes
the solution rate in bank robbery and bank larceny cases
drops drastically.

It is noted all convictions obtained by the
San Francisco Office for bank robbery violations have been
handied in the U.S. District Court and it is noteworthy
that you have perfected liaison to the point where these
matters are being handled exclusively by the Federal government.

‘The differences between your figures and Bureau
figures -is accounted for since Bureau figures are as of
September 30, 1970, and the San Francisco Office figures

, care as of October 16, 1970.

Those areas requiring further attention in bank
robbery matters are those consisting of the greatest areas
of population; that is, Berkeley, Oakland, San Jose, and
Headquarters. In the case of Berkeley, it is suggested that
greater efforts be made to obtain informants connected with
the New Left element inasmuch as this area’ has the greatest
student_population in the San Francisco Bay Area and members
of the SDS and other revolutionary groups have indicated a
propensity for violence including bank robbery. |

Although the percentage of delinquencies in
any classification is only one measure of the attention
being given cases in that category, the above, tabulation
indicates the comparative delinquency in the bank robbery

, matters with the overall office delinquency and the
delinquencies in criminal matters.

: It is noted that delinquencies in 91 matters
has been below the office generally in 10 out of the -past
15 months. The 6.2 delinquency and 5.3 delinquency shown
in the chart above appears to be excessive for those months
and all efforts should be made to insure that this type
of delinquency does not recur in 91 matters. In this
all important category delinquency should be held at an
absolute minimum.

INFORMANTS

At the beginning of the current inspection there
were 17 approved CIs opened and assigned to the Agents on
the Bank Robbery Squad in the San Francisco Office. These
-L7 informants have been separately rated in the informant
section of the inspection report (shown in Section 4-H).
The ratings are as follows: 7

a Excellent 2

7 Very Good 2
Good 8

Fair -3

Poor 1

One informant is not being rated in view of
insufficient data to rate and it appears this informant
will be placed in the nature of a source as a result of
this inspection. You should give serious consideration
to giving the informants rated good or fair specific
assignments so that they may become more productive in
the future.

As can be seen from the above tabulation the
informant program handled by the Agents on the Bank
Robbery Squad is in need of improvement. Agents working
on this squad should be constantly selecting new individuals
for consideration under the informant program and should be

| aware of the possibility of developing quality informants
from the Bank Robbery Suspect Program. Agents handling
bank vobbery matters should continue to be leaders within
- the office in this particular category.

The San Francisco Office has a total of 268
“ghetto informants, 14 racial informants, and 8 probationary
vacial informants. This is an excellent pool for obtaining
quality bank robbery information and it should be fully
utilized by your office. You should insure that dissemination:
is promptly made for timely contacts of these sources when
the facts of a bank robbery are clear so that full advantage
can be made of any information they may have while the facts
are still fresh in the mind of those individuals that are
contacted.

“BANK ROBBERY SUSPECTS

The Bureau has advised all offices of the need
to develop quality informants among known and suspected
armed robbers and burglars and thieves. The Bank Robbery
Suspect Program has been mostieffective in developing informants
from among this element. Your efforts should be directed
-towards developing background information on individuals
previously convicted for bank robberies and bank burglaries
as well as armed robberies.

You should increase your efforts through
continuous intensive coverage of known robbers to
develop suspects or informants especially in view of the
cosmopolitan area of San Francisco and the closeness to the
Los Angeles and Las Vegas criminal elements.

In regard to your suspect program you should
accummulate all possible data concerning their background
and obtain photographs of these individuals as soon as possible
in order that they could be added to your Bank Robbery
Album and utilized during your investigation of bank robberies
in your territory. : aa

ADMINISTRATIVE HANDLING
Review of your files discloses that in general

bank robbery cases and related matters are receiving the
attention they deserve and are generally well administered.

NW 65360 Docld:32989637 Page 344



Se

Procedures being followed by the San Francisco Office
conform to the Bureau rules and regulations in regard

to the prompt notification of the Bureau of a bank robbery
violation and prompt submission of initial reports within
30 days. However, it is noted in several instances in
which notes have been used these notes after being obtained
have not been promptly submitted to the FBI Laboratory.

The need for obtaining and promptly submitting these notes
should be brought to the attention of all the Agents on the
Bank Robbery Squad. The obtaining of these notes and the
prompt submission is necessary in both those cases in which
the Subject is unknown as well as those in which the Subject —
has been identified.

In view of the number of bank robberies that
have occurred throughout the San Francisco territory
newspapers apparently have shown a reluctance to publicize
photographs of Subjects obtained from surveillance cameras
during the commission of the robberies. Efforts should be
made to institute a program in which newspapers can be induced
to publish these photographs throughout the territory
covered by the San Francisco Office shortly after the commission
of a robbery in which a good likeness of the Subject has
been obtained. :

EVIDENCE

SAC Letter 69-32, dated June 10, 1969, instructs
that the note used by a bank robber, latent impressions
found at the scene, and similar physical evidence should
be submitted to the Bureau on the day of the violation or

“as soon thereafter as possible. If local authorities have
the original note, copies should be promptly and forwarded
in accordance with existing procedures. In the absence of
unusual circumstances the initial 30 day report in bank
robbery cases should contain results of the Laboratory
and Identification Division examinations.

In 91-9460 a bank robbery was committed on
10/9/70, and although the Subject was apprehended he had
left a note and this note has not yet been submitted to the
FBI Laboratory.

(46.

NW 65360 Docld:32989637 Page 345



-8~

In 91-9446 a bank robbery occurred on 10/5/70,
and indications are that the suspect involved in this case
may possibly have been involved in three other, bank robberies.
This robbery was another in which a note was used and there
is no indication in this file that this note has yet
‘been submitted to the Bureau. Other cases in which there
were not timely submissions of latent prints and/or demand
notes were noted in your files 91-9439, 91-9382, 91-9410,
91-9395, It is essential that personnel of your office
fully comply with existing Bureau procedures relative to the
prompt submission of evidence in bank robbery matters. In
the above instances you: are instructed to immediately submit
demand notes or copies thereof to the Bureau for appropriate
examination.

: NCIC

In 91-9410 and 91-9446 the Unknown Subjects
obtained bait money, however, there is no indication that
the serial numbers of the bait money have been entered
into NCIC. You should insure that bait money in bank

“ pobberies is entered into NCIC immediately.

SURVEILLANCE CAMERAS

_ In approximately 75 to 80% of the bank robberies
in which a photograph was obtained it was of material
assistance in solving the case. In addition, where Subject
has been identified by other means, the photograph was
available as corroborative evidence.

On the other hand, if a bank camera does not
photograph the Subject or produces a blurred result because
of poor lighting it is an expense to the bank and of no
practical use toward the solution of the case.

In 91-3460 a surveillance camera had been
installed by the bank, however, it was not activated during
the commission of the robbery. However, in this case the
Subject was subsequently apprehended. You should insure
that during clinics conducted by your office, banks are
instructed to insure cameras are in proper working condition,
properly serviced and bank employees are aware of the value
of activating the cameras at the proper time.

BANK ROBBERY CLINICS

It is noted that the San Francisco Office is
conducting frequent Bank Robbery Clinics throughout the
division to give banking institutions instructions
concerning their role in bank robbery investigations
and to create a continued interest among bank officials
to adopt a continuing training program for their employees.
It is recommended that you continue to give clinics of this
type throughout your territory and stress the need for
bank officials to become security conscious in connection
with their banking procedures and physical plants.

It is noted as a result of these clinics and
contacts with the Dank cf Ame which hac over 960 branches
has produced an excellent training film which is shown
periodically to all new personnel. Other banks are following
this procedure and this should assist substantially in
obtaining good descriptive data of suspects as well as
reducing the incidents of bank robberies in your division.

As a result of the passing of the Bank Protection
Act of 1968 most of the banks throughout your area have
installed or are in the process of installing cameras
in. most of their branches. Through the wider use of
bank surveillance photographs shortly after the commission
of a robbery it should lead to the identification of
more suspects. 7

It is noteworthy in an attempt to minimize the
number of bank robberies occurring in the San Francisco
Bay Area the City of San Francisco has adopted a plan of
encouraging the hiring of law enforcement officers as
tellers during their off hours during which time they are
armed. A review of your files indicates that over the
past year and a half this has proved very successful in
apprehending bank robbers, bad check passers, and individuals
attempting to cash stolen securities. It has been noted
that even though the robber may not be apprehended at the
by these bank tellers, because of their training their
value as witnesses has been extremely worthwhile.

LEADS IN REPORTS '

The leads set out in the initial report in
91-9161 indicate the projected investigation to consist
of reporting results of Laboratory examination, reviewing
State of California All Point Bulletins, maintaining contact
with the San Francisco Police Department and reviewing
solved and unsolved West Coast bank robberies. This same
type of non-descriptive lead is set out in the second report
in this same case. Similar non-descriptive leads are set
out in 91-9206 and 91~9419.

: Leads of this type are unimaginative and of
little value for the supervisor in evaluating the
projected investigation or for another Agent in having
such a case reassigned te him. The expression of such
leads does not represent the investigative potential of
which FBI Agents are capable and of which the San Francisco
Office has shown in its solution rate. Leads such as these
are merely passing our investigative responsibility to the
local authorities.

COPIES OF REPORTS

Three copies of the bank robbery report were
designated in 91~7976, 91-9377, 91-9225 and four copies of
the initial report were made in 91-9362, with no apparent
reason shown or explanation inade for the extra copy. All
Agents should be reminded that only two copies are made
in bank robbery cases in the interest of conserving file
space. When more copies are dictated for a particular need
such as multiple leads in several Resident Agencies the
extra copy should be destroyed and proper notation
made of this fact after its purpose has been served.

CASE SUGGESTIONS

In 91-9395 an unknown white female subject,
approximately 17 or 18 years old robbed the Wells Fargo
Bank in Berkeley, California. The Unknown Subject displayed
a note which note has not yet been forwarded to the Bureau.

[eevee eA



-lil-

This note should be immediately sent to the FBI Laboratory.
In addition, an extremely clear photograph was taken of the
Unknown Subject and inasmuch as it appears from the photograph
and from descriptions obtained she is a "hippie type"
security informants familiar with the New Left element in
Berkeley should be contacted. Inasmuch as this case

involves a young female it is felt that additional contacts
with neighboring newspapers should be made in order to

have her picture publicized more widely than as heretofore
happened. Also contact should be made with the Berkeley
Campus Police Department to determine if it would be feasible
to display her photograph to college sources or counsellors
in an attempt to determine if this Unknown Subject may be

a student at the Berkeley Campus of the University of
California.

In 91-9277 it is noted.that the individual who
robbed this bank as depicted in the surveillance photograph
on July 24, 1970, is of excellent quality. Although this
photograph together with other bank robbery surveillance
photographs appeared in the "Oakland Tribune", Oakland,
California, 8/3/70, it is believed this is the type of
photograph that should receive additional newspaper publicity.
It is noted from past contacts with officials of the Bank

" of America they pian in the near future to publish in local
newspapers in the Bay Area a full page ad depicting surveillance
photographs in unsolved bank robbery cases. It is
recommended in contact with the Bank of America officials
that this case be recommended as one that they publish in
such an ad. In addition, any other circulation that can
be obtained through area newspapers should be utilized
in displaying this photograph.

In 91-8825, 91-9267, and 91-9456, all bank
robberies where good to excellent quality surveillance
photographs were obtained of the individual robbing the
banks. This individual was responsible for all three
bank robberies. It is noted this photograph has been

. published in surrounding Bay Area newspapers but did not
appear in local San Francisco news media, inasmuch as all
three bank robberies occurred in San Francisco. Two of
these bank robberies were Bank of America banks and
consideration should be given to having this surveillance .
photograph published in the contemplated ad to be placed by
Bank of America officials in San Francisco and Bay Area
newspapers in the near future. Likewise, consideration
should be given to extending circulation of this photograph

NW 65360 Docld:32989637 Page 349 Qo }.



-12- ne:

to other news media and appropriate parole officials
and law enforcement agencies in the Bay Area.

MISCELLANEOUS

In 91-9427 it is noted the Subject of this
case is also a member of the Students for a Democratic
Society (SDS) and was the Subject of a security matter in
the San Francisco Office.

In 91-9405 the Subject was also the Subject of
a Selective Service case, security matter case and an
Anti-Riot Law case in the San Francisco Office. These
examples are cited in order to show the need at this time

security informants throughout
your division. You should be constantly aware that
revolutionaries in this country have publicly stated that
they intend to finance their causes by bank robberies
and/or armed robberies and this emphasizes the need when
descpiptions and photographs are obtained to distribute
these photographs and descriptions throughout all the
“personnel in your office. Agents working security type
cases should be made aware of the need in contacting their
informants to keep in mind that robberies have been committed
by these young revolutionaries in the past and undoubtedly
in the future they will continue to increase.

unsolved bank robberies have been solved through the

i identification of the perpetrators who have been incarcerated
and are awaiting prosecution. The San Francisco Office

: therefore now has a grand total of old and new pending

' unsolved bank robbery matters in the amount of 76. The
percentage of solution of bank robbery violations is,
since the date of last inspection, now 79.2 percent.

CRIMINAL INTELLIGENCE PROGRAM AND
INTERSTATE GAMBLING ACTIVITIES

PART A. GENERAL

1, The commercial or lucrative type of criminal
activity in the San Francisco Division continues to be
predominantly confined to the areas as noted below.
Exhaustive and probative investigation and close liaison
with local state and Federal agencies to date has revealed no
evidence of an organized criminal group controlling these
activities in, §an Francisco or Resident Agency territories.
Investigation contacts with informants and other sources of
information have failed to reveal the existence of any
organized illegal gamb , loan sharking (Shylocking),
labor racketeering or planned bankruptcy frauds.

A. Local bookmaking involving horse and
sport bets conducted by numerous local
independent bookmakers, some of whom
have established "lay-off" arrangements

pan among themselves.

B. Prostitution activity primarily in the
"Tenderloin" section of San Francisco
involving out-of-town businessmen,
tourists, and servicemen with prostitutes,
most of whom are working for unorganized
negro “pimps",

C. WNareotic activity and related crimes

’ usually involving thefts and frauds near
universities, military installations, and

t “hippie” or Bohemian sections of cities
within the division. ;

2. This office continues to enjoy an excellent rela-_
tionship with the San Francisco Police Department and its
official personnel. Cooperation and excellent relationships

are known to exist between all Resident Agencies and the
local law enforcement agencies in their territories. No
evidence or information has been made available to this
office to indicate that there is any corruption in law
enforcement in this division.

As the Bureau is well aware, Mayor JOSEPH LAWRENCE
ALIOTO was the Subject of anti-racketeering investigation
by this office several years ago, however, this matter has
been closed. ALIOTO prior to assuming the position of Mayor
of the City of San Francisco was a prominent and well known
attorney, particularly in the field of anti-trust matters.
He. is known to have been the attorney for TONY LIMA, a former
"Boss" of the LCN in San Francisco. He also represented a
number of other LCN figures and their associates.

: Prior investigation revealed that the cousin of
ALIOTO's father, JOHN ALIOTO, was the former "Boss" of the
Milwaukee LCN Family. JOHN ALTOTO attended the inauguration
of Mayor ALIOTO at San Francisco in January 1968.

As a result of an article published in “Look”
- Magazine, September 23, 1969, linking ALIOTO with many LCN
: figures, ALIOTO filed a $12.5 million libel suit against
"Took" magazine and the authors of this article, RICHARD
CARLSON and LANCE BRISSON.

On May 15, 1970, Federal Judge BRUCE THOMPSON
declared a mistrial in San Francisco on this suit in that
the jury was unable to agree on the key issue of whether
the article linking ALIOTO with the "Mafia" was published
with "malice and reckless disregard for.the facts." The
jurors told newsmen that the article was defamatory to
ALIOTO and that at least 50 per cent of the 27 points were
indeed untrue. There was no agreement as to whether the
falsehoods and the article's general claim that ALIOTO was
“enmeshed in a web of alliances" with the "Mafia" represented
“malice and reckless disregard for the facts." U.S. Supreme
Court has ruled that such a finding is essential to a libel
judgment sought by a public official.

activities of the San Francisco and San Jose Families as

on matters involving bookmaking, prostitution, pornography

and other criminal matters. As an indication cf the level

of our informant coverage since last inspection, SF 2689-C-TE .

_ assumed the position of "Boss" of the San Francisco LCN

Family. These informants due to their positions and locations
have made it possible to obtain top level information necessary
to provide coverage for Items 1 and 2.

4. Since last inspection extensive investigation as
well as informant coverage led to the first ITAR conviction
prosecutions ever in the San Francisco Division a Item 7
below).

Investigation in the case CARL EZEKIAL ECKSTIN,
ITWI, case developed a “shakedown” by ECKSTIN against local
bookmaker VICTOR ROMOLO. ‘This matter arose out of the failure
of ROMOLO to pay a bookmaking debt owed ECKSTIN. SALVATORE
VINCENI "BILL" BONANNO, JOSEPH BONANNO, JR., MAURICE PATRICK

if he failed to pay the debt. This case is currently
under investigation with the matter being presented to
the Federal Grand Jury at San Francisco for violation
of Title 18, U.S. Code, Section 894, Extortionate Credit
Transaction Statute. eet :

It should be pointed out that "BILL" BONANNO
and JOSEPH BONANNO, JR. are the sons of JOSEPH BONANNO, SR.,
a "Commission" member of the LCN in the United States.

The aforementioned Subjects are also involved in
a separate ECT case involving the shakedown and threats to
do bodily harm to. WILLIAM JOSEPH ELLIS. This matter is
presently under investigation and will be presented to the
Federal Grand Jury, San Francisco immediately upon completion
--—.- , O€ Grand Jury action in the ECKSTIN ECT case.

Since last inspection investigation has continued

in regard to GUISEPPI CONFORTE, the reported Vice Lord,

State of Nevada, who for years has headed up a major pros-
titution operation. Through extensive investigation and

the placement of SF 3239-C~TE and SF 3369-C, this organization
has been completely penetrated identifying his lieutenants
‘and scope of operation. As a result of the above, it has Leen
‘determined that CONFORTE's operation has spread to the State

of Hawaii being controlled there by one of his top lieutenants,
TOMMY SEALE. San Francisco has under.preparation an affidavit
for a request of a Title 3 electronic surveillance on the
phones utilized by this organization in Honolulu. This Title 3
affidavit has been prepared with the assistance of Departmental
Attorney at San Francisco and who has discussed same with the
Organized Crime Section, Department of Justice, who has advised
that upon completion of current investigation in Honolulu the
affidavit should be immediately submitted for approval.

As another example of the progress made in the
penetration of the racketeering operation since the last
inspection information was received that HARRY JOHN JOHNSON

“and ALAN “SUITCASE” FIDLER,ctwo. Boston "hit men" received a
contract, reportedly by a printer, to travel to San Francisco
and "straighten somebody out over..a union matter." JOHNSON,
a former resident of San Francisco, is known as a former
associate of JACK GOLDBERGER, top local Teamster official

| and reportedly JIMMY HOFFA's special West Coast representative.

: JOHNSON and FIDLER travelled to San Francisco from Boston in
January, 1970 and through surveillance and subsequent intensive
investigation it was determined that they met with one GEORGE
R, DUNCAN, International Representative, International
Typographers Union (1fU). It was determined that shortly
prior to the travel of JOHNSON and FIDLER to the San Francisco
area a strike situation existed at the San Rafael “Independent
Journal" newspaper involving the ITU. Through cooperation and
liaison with local law enforcement, JOHNSON and FIDLER were
arrested near San Rafael, California and found to be in

| possession of handguns and mace. Shortly after the return
of JOHNSON and FIDLER to the Boston area, an individual who
had knowledge that they had been given this contract was

{ found murdered in Beaten and on his body were found the names

7 and telephone numbers of JOHNSON and FIDLER. Through these

efforts the attempt by JOHNSON and FIDLER to perform the

conditions of the contract were thwarted. In addition, this

Matter is being considered by Departmental Attorney for

possible Federal Grand Jury presentation.

.? Another example of progress made in the penetration
in the field of intelligence and erganized crime in this area
resulted when through information furnished by top echelon
informants revealing the presence of ALATADENO JAMES FRATIANNO
residing in the San Francisco territory. Through investigation
and surveillances conducted FRATIANNO was subsequently contacted
-and was developed as a top echelon target of this division.
Frequent contacts were conducted with FRATIANNO and extensive
cooperation was obtained from him concerning organized crime.
FRATIANNO was identified as a member of the Los Angeles Family
of the LCN and during August, 1976 was indicted by Federal
Grand Jury convening in San Francisco for two counts of
violation of Title 18, U.S. Code, Section 894, ECT. Although
presently incarcerated FRATIANNO is being contacted periodically
as a target in an effort to continue development of his
cooperation. : : ie

8. Subsequent to the submission of last inspection

report, through information by top echelon informants this
office, information has been developed that SF 2689-C-TE
has assumed the position of "Boss" of the San Francisco
LCN Family.

SF 2656-PC has reported to the return to the San
Jose area of STEFANO ZOCCOLI, Consiglieri of the San Jose LCN
Family from Los Angeles where he had been residing for the
past year.

During November 1969, SF 2656-PC reported that
- GEORGE ADRAGNA, a member of Western Pennsylvania Family of
: ‘the LCN was coming to the San Jose area to live. Subsequently,
~~ SP 2656=PC and SF 2689-C-TE reported that ADRAGNA's membership
had been transferred to the San Jose LCN Family and he is
currently residing in the San Jose area.

Subsequent to the submission of last inspection
report SF 2689-C-TE reported. that JAMES FRATIANNO, a member
of the Los Angeles LCN Family had moved into the San Francisco
‘area where he remained until August when he commenced serving
a prison sentence executed by the State of California.

. ei: During October, 1969, information was received
indicating that JERRY LISNER, major bookmaker, Los Angeles,
California was in contact with JOHN CASTELLI, bookmaker,
Oakland, California. The purpose of this contact was for
LISNER to establish a base of operation, particularly book-

_ making, for his criminal activities in the San Francisco
area, Investigation subsequently established that LISNER
and others commenced a bookmaking operation in Alameda and ~*
Contra Costa Counties, East Bay Area, using as its front
A-1 TV Service, Oakland, which is owned by JOHN CASTELLI.
Following extensive investigation in cooperation with the
Oakland Police Department, no evidence was developed to
indicate any violation of Féderal statutes. On November 22, —
1969, the Oakland and Berkeley, California Police Departments
simultaneously arrested SALVATORE J. BERNICE, JOHN TRAPPS and
two other associates who were engaged in LISNER's bookmaking

operation, These arrests resulted in a breakup in the
entire bookmaking operation and subsequently during
February, 1970 LISNER returned to the Los Angeles,
California area.

In July, 1970, information was made available
x San Mateo Police Department which led to the arrest
of WALTER DALY, PAULA DALY and SABRINA DUNN. These indi-
viduals were arrested for prostitution, conspiracy,
maintaining a disorderly house and being an inmate in a
disorderly house. These arrests were a direct result of
informant information and investigation conducted by the
San Francisco Office which revealed no Federal violation
and therefore was referred to local authorities, This
operation was determined to be a $90,000 a year “high class"
cail girl service and trom this rive other call girl services
were uncovered, all local in nature in San Francisco.
Intelligence information concerning these operations haS2
been furnished the San Francisco Police Department and are
being followed closely by the San Francisco Office.

In addition to the foregoing, as a result of
information furnished by SF 2956-C-TE and SF 3036-PC,
CHARLES FRANCIS LEAHY, JR., Major San Francisco Pookmaker,
was arrested on August 4, 1970, by the San Francisco Police
Department on charges of bookmaking and ex-convict in

PART B: GAMBLING MATTERS

1. In the San Francisco Division there appears
to be two gambling operators that lead all others in terms
-of handle, volume, coverage, number of accounts, and
number of employees. These operators are CARL EZEKIAL
ECKSTEIN and CHARLES FRANCIS LEAHY, JR., both of whom are
based in San Francisco. While they both handle substantial
individual accounts, ECKSTEIN and LEAHY are primarily
associated with and rely on lessor local bookmakers for
“action.” :

CARL EZEKIAL ECKSTEIN, age 40 years, has been
enyaygéd in gambling activities most of his adult life.
ECKSTEIN was formerly associated with TONY RUIZ and other
San Francisco bookmakers, but in the last year ECKSTEIN
has set up his own independent operation. ECKSTEIN has been
arrested on several occasions on charges of bookmaking but
has never been convicted of this violation. In 1965 ECKSTEIN
was convicted for failure to pay Federal wagering tax which

,* conviction was subsequently overturned. Details regarding
his current operation are set forth below in Paragraph 3.

CHARLES FRANCIS LEAHY, JR., a native San Franciscan,
. in his middle 40's, has been engaged in bookmaking activities
7 throughout his adult life. He was convicted in United
States District Court, San Francisco, in 1961 for arrest
on 9/28/60 for violation of Title 26, Section 7203, U.S.
Code, failure to report and pay wagering tax, and was
sentenced to six months in jail and five years probation.
Subsequent to his incarceration, LEAHY moved to Medford,
Oregon.. He returned to the San Francisco area in the Spring
of 1969 and resumed his bookmaking activities. During his
i absence from San Francisco, his ex-brother~in-law, KENNETH
JOSEPH ZAHND, reportedly handled his, LEAHY's, bookmaking’
operation. LEAHY was recently arrested by the San Francisco
Police Department on local bookmaking charges and is
currently awaiting trial.

2. The types of gambling prevalent in the San

Francisco Division are primarily wagering on horse races

and sporting events. In addition, small numbers betting

“with a weekly drawing take place usually in the Spanish-
speaking communities. There are also legal and illegal

card games operating usually in low-income commercial

“neighborhoods. Gambling in the division is conducted by
individual operators who are independent of each other,

except for layoff purposes with respect to bookmaking and
there. are no indications of hoodlum control over any of

these activities. :

3. Concerning the extent of gambling in this
division, bookmakers ECKSTEIN and LEAHY, named in Paragraph
1 above, operate in the following manner. Both are in
daily contact with their accounts located in the Bay area

which include other bookmakers for layoff purposes, split

_ bookmakers, and numerous individual bettors.

Bets are placed with these operations generally
» at locations to which the general public has access, such
7 as bars, restaurants, coffee shops, and other small shops.
The “action" received at these business locations are in
turn called in to a phone spot operated by a bookmaker who
has a gambling relationship with the operator | of the
business.

ECKSTEIN normally operates with six employees,
including two phone men, a bookkeeper, a pay & collect man,
and two runners. In addition, he utilizes several split
bookmakers as employees, The principal bookmakers and

" split bookmakers-involved in the ECKSTEIN bookmaking
operations are THEODORE CHALMIS, ALBERT DiGERONIMO, ELBERT
HEDRICK, MANNY PRONGOS, and ALBERT CARLSON. ECKSTEIN's
monthly handle based on informant data, evidence seized by
the San Francisco Police Department during recent bookmaking
raids, and interviews of bettors is estimated to be approxi-
mately $50,000 for horse bets. His sports "action" varies
with the season of the year and bettor interests in particu-
lar sporting events; however, ECKSTEIN's handle for sports
action is estimated to be $40,000 per month.

Investigation has determined that MATZA receives race
results by calling either California Turf, Los Angeles,
‘a horse race results business operated by FRANK MILANO,
or J & K Sports Journal, North Hollywood, California,
operated by GERALD KILLGORE.

Since the last inspection, the San Francisco
Office has developed SF 2661-C-TE, who is a key operator
within the ECKSTEIN bookmaking organization. SF 3036-PC,
who was targeted at time of last inspection, has been
developed to the point where he furnishes detailed
information on a weekly basis regarding the LEAHY bookmak~
inq organization. This target is a split bookmaker handling
sports "action" for the LEAHY organization. As a xesult

of information furnished by SF 3036-PC and SF 3237-C-TE,
LEAHY was arrested by the San Francisco Police Department
on 8/4/70 on charges of bookmaking and convict in possession
of a weapon.

SF 3090-PC was targeted at the time of the last
inspection; however, during the past several months, he
has furnished extensive information regarding several
large bookmaking operations.

SF 3387-C was developed since the last inspection
and was responsible for the initial information and identifi-
cation of a major bookmaking operation in the East Bay area,

“including Oakland, California, and Naval Air Station,
Alameda, California. The informant's information led to
the arrest and subsequent conviction of the two major
operators within, the organization in United States District
Court, San Francisco. In addition, based on informant's
information and ‘investigation by this office, there were
two arrests and convictions effected by local authorities,

' Oakland.

As a result of extensive investigation in the
ECKSTEIN ITWI case, a “shakedown" on the part of ECKSTEIN
against a local bookmaker was developed. This investigation

.has resulted in two major ECT cases involving non-payment

of bookmaking debts which are currently under investigation
and before the Federal Grand Jury at San Francisco. To -
date, eight local bookmakers have appeared before the
Federal Grand Jury and others will be called. This has had
a disruptive effect among bookmakers and has created an
atmosphere of distrust.

6. Pursuant to instructions set forth in Bureau
letter to SAC Albany 1/27/70 regarding gambling investiga-
tions under proposed SB30, a review of gambling cases was
undertaken. It ¢hould be pointed out that during the past
three years, it has been the policy of the San Francisco
Office to closely follow the activities of local gambling
organizations and/or subjects in an attempt to develop any
indication of a Federal gambling violation. Per instructions
additional 162 and 165 cases have been opened and investigated.
Specifically since 2/1/70 sixty-three 162 cases and ninety-
eight 165 cases have been opened.

he The La Cosa Nostra (LCN) continues to exist in the Northern
California area and includes a San Francisco "family"
and a San Jose "family." There are currently 8 members of the

San Francisco "family" residing in this division and 19 members
of the San Jose "family" residing in this division. In addition,
there are two members of the San Francisco "family" residing in
the Sacramento Division, one member in the Los Angeles Division,
one in the Chicago Division and two members presently residing

in Italy. There are currently 3 members of the San Jose "family"
residing in the Sacramento Division and one in the Las Vegas
Division. All of these members have been identified as mmbers

of the San Francisco or San Jose "families by TE informants

of the San Francisco Division.

Four top echelon informants of this division who are
members of LCN "families" have failed to indicate that the LCN
"families" of this division register any control over gambling ,
narcotics, prostitution er any other organized iliegal activity
within this division.

The present leadership of the San Francisco "family"
has recently been assumed by ANTHONY LIMA, who took over this
position when the previous "boss", JAMES JOSEPH LANZA, stepped
down in his favor. The "underbogs" of the San Francisco "family"
is GASPARE "BILL" SCIORTINO and this "family" has one Capo de
Decina, VINCENZO INFUSINO, who resides in Modesto, California,
in the Sacramento Division.

The leadership of the San Jose "family" remaine the same
as at the time of the last inspection report with JOSEPH CERRITO,
the "boss," PHILIPPO OCTAVIO MORICI and STEFANO ZOCCOLI,
Consiglieris, and one Capo de Decina, EMANUEL FIGLIA. Notap-
pointment has been made to the position of "underboss" since
the death of the previous "underboss ," CHARLES CARBONE, in 1967.

2 There are presently 8 members of the San Francisco "family"
and 19 members of the San Jose "family" residing in this
territory. “All of these members have been identified by TE
eriminal informants of this division.
TE informants of this office who are members of the LCN
or associates of members of the LCN have been alerted to con-
tinue to furnish information and identities of any individuals

AAT,



aA

who are. associated with the LCN in this territory. SF-2689-C-TE
j has indicated that the recruits are the "second army" of the
| LCN and to be aware of and on top of activities of the LCN,
i it is necessary to identify these recruits. Since the last
i inspection, TE informants have identified an additional 11
recruits of the San Francisco and San Jose "families" residing
' in this territory or in the Sacramento territory.

As has been reported above, TE informant, of this office
reported the change in leadership of the "boss" of the San
' Francisco "family" when JAMES LANZA stepped down in favor of
ANTHONY LIMA.

‘In addition, informants of this office reported the
return to the San Jose area of Consiglieri STEFANO ZOCCOLI, who
has been residing in the Los Angeles territory.

LCN in the San Francisco territory:

SF-2550-C~TE
SF-2689-C-TE
SP-2745-C~TE
SF-3208-C~TE

. Agents of the San Francisco Division eurrently involved
in the development of TE criminal informants and in AR investiga-
i tions are contacting the following PC targets who are members

of the LCN in this beet in an effort to develop their
" cooperation:

SF-3141-PC, in contacts to date, have furnished some cooperation
and it is felt that with continued contacts, these targets offer
excellent potential. In addition, from contacts to date, SF-2639-F=

LA COSA NOSTRA (LCN)

Investigation by your office revealed the existence

| of two LCN "families" within your territory. Membership ~

| within these "families" total 64 individuals. Your

| investigation revealed neither "family" is considered to be
very strong and has little or no illegal operations being

| conducted on a day to day basis.

One "family" is centered in the San Francisco area

. and has for tne past few years been headed by Jaties Lanza,
an attendee at the Apalachin meeting in 1957. Lanza has

{s recently stepped down as boss of the San Francisco "family
and has been replaced by Toni Lima. Your investigation
| reveals that Lima's leadership has not been approved by
: the "commission." You should follow this matter closely

so you will be in a position to know all activities relating

0

| _, ‘to this change in position.
eee The second "family" is centered in the San Jose area

z and is headed by boss Joe Cerrito. This "family" exhibits
little enthusiasm for illegal operations. You should closely
follow the activities of members of this "family" to insure
that any illegal operations are immediately known to your |

office. : :

Organized Crime ¥ . .
7 = if
Although prostitution, gambling and narcotic activities |

exist within your division, there is no indication from your |

investigations that these operations are controlled by either |
the LCN or other organized groups. Your investigations

should be continually pursued with vigor in order that your |

office will be aware of any illegal operations within your

division. This is particularly true in regard to gambling |

activities in view of the recent passage of Senate Bill 30.

As you are aware provisions of Senate Bill 30 made it a
Federal crime in certain gambling operations and it will
not be necessary to prove interstate aspects of the
gambling activity.

Top Echelon Criminal Informant Program (TECIP)

The following is an analysis of your Top Echelon
Informant Program at this time as compared with the last
inspection:

Rating Last Inspection Present Inspection
Excellent 4 3
Very Good 2 3
Good 1 3
Fair 0 1
Poor 0 0

Totals 7 iv

It is noted your office has penetrated the LCN
"families" in both San Jose and San Francisco through the
development of member informants. This is very noteworthy
and you are encouraged to make certain that your member
informants are utilized to the best advantage of the Bureau.
Also, it is noteworthy that you have increased your TE

-coverage from 7 to 10 since the last inspection.

SF 3058-C-TE (San Francisco file 137-4670; Bureau
file 137-17455) was rated fair because of a lack of productivity.
You should follow instructions issued in Bureau letter dated
July 14, 1970 and if this informant is unproductive for four
months subsequent to the receipt of that letter the informant
should be closed.

Although SF 2745-C-TE (gan Francisco file 137-3456;
Bureau file 137-. ~11174) was rated good, his progress should
be closely followed. Although he is noted to be a member
informant the file indicates he is very sick with varicose
veins and is very old. The majority of information furnished
by this source has been of a nature of past activities and
little present information is being furnished by him. You
should endeavor to have him furnish more productive recent
informant or give consideration to concentrate on a more
productive source.

A review of your file 137-5207, Bureau file 137-20313

concerning SF 3208-C-TE indicates the source was last contacted

on June 26, 1970. The file indicates this source sold his

business and left for Los Angeles and this information was

learned by your office on August 13, 1970. The file also

indicates this TE left the New York area because of being

a victim of a shylock loan. In view of this information

you should closely follow this informant's activities and

be circumspect in dealing with the informant to prevent

any possible embarrassing situation from arising.

The following is a rating of the PCs and a comparison
with the ratings at the time of the last inspection:

Rating | Last Inspection Present Inspection
Excellent 0 1
Very Good 6 7
Good 7 11 24
Fair 1 3

It is very encouraging to note that you have increased
your targets from 39 from the time of the last inspection to
- 46 at the time of this inspection. You are encouraged to
ccontinue this most desirable trend.

SF 2123-PC (San Francisco file 137-4945; Buraau file
137-11841) was rated fair. This target was opened on April
8, 1968 and was last contacted on October 10, 1969. You
advised that contact is being held in abeyance pending a
surveillance which was conducted by the Oakland Police
Department in early 1970. In view of the length of time
since this case was opened and the length of time since this
target was contacted he was rated fair.

i SF 2630-PC (San Francisco file 137-2967; Bureau file
137-9023) was rated fair. By letter dated December 10, 1968
the Bureau advised that this target was over two years old
and that you should consider deleting within four months if
he was unproductive. This informant was also rated fair
during the last inspection because of lack of productivity.

Solel etch aoa ae ee eee


i 27

The only reason this informant is being classified fair

instead of poor is because information contained in your

letter to the Bureau dated September 18, 1970 wherein your

informant reported information was furnished by a TE to

the effect that the present "boss" of the San Francisco

LCN "family" had been discussing leadership of the San

Francisco LCN with the target. You are instructed that

in the event he does not furnish valuable positive information

within 90 days he should be closed and a more suitable target
' . developed.

SF 3061~PC (San Francisco file 137-4768; Bureau file
137-17558) was also rated fair. This target along with the
other two targets rated fair should be closely followed for
90 days and be given specific assignments during that period
i of time. In the event they are unproductive they should be
| a closed.

“SF 2582-PC (San Francisco file 137=2658; Bureau file
137-8249) was rated poor and should be closed.

In regard to your PCs, the following specific
instructions are being furnished you:

SF 2656~PC (San Francisco file 137-3086; Bureau file
137-9425) was rated good because of his being close to San
Jose LCN member Dominick Anzalone and Pittsburgh LCN member
George Adragna who recently moved to San Jose. He is also
close to LCN "recruit" Vito Adragna. It is noted that this
target has been opened for a period of more than one yar
and has been furnishing general rather than any specific
information. You should encourage this informant to furnish

_ some specific information concerning these people who he
is close to in order that he aa be retained as a _ target of
. your office. r
SF 3318-PC (San Francisco file 137~5545; Bureau file
137-22526) has been a target of your office since December
| 26, 1969. Unless your office isin possession of some
specific information to the contrary he should be immediately
interviewed to determine whether he will be cooperative
. with your office.

SF 3135~-PC (San Francisco file 137-5010; Bureau file
137-19079) was opened on May 17, 1968. During the two
inspections since he was opened this PC was rated Unsufficient
Data to Rate. On November 20, 1969 you advised that an
interview of this PC was being held in abeyance pending an
investigation by the Oakland, California Police Department.
The file indicates that that investigation was completed on
August 6, 1970 with your target paying a $125 fine. On
August 19, 1970 you advised that interview of the target
was being delayed pending further investigation. You are
instructed that this interview should be immediately conducted
in order to determine if this target will be cooperative with
your office.

- SF 3297-PC (San Francisco file 137-5457; Bureau file
137-22106) was opened on October 17, 1969. ‘The file indicates
that this target has never been interviewed and you indicate
that contact with the target is being delayed until a more
logical area of vulnerability is developed. Inasmuch as
this target is ever onc year old it is felt that sufficient

* information should be developed so that your office might

approach this target to determine if he will be cooperative
with your office.

‘ SF 3192-PC (San Francisco file 137-5016; Bureau file
137-10982) was opened on May 21, 1968. SF 3110-PC (San
Francisco file 137-2182; Bureau file 137~22452) has been

“ opened since December 8, 1969. It would appear that

sufficient time has elapsed in order for your office to
develop background information so that an interview of

-. these targets can be conducted. You should without further

delay interview these targets to determine if they will be
cooperative and if not you should consider closing and finding
more suitable targets for development.

i Information you furnished indicates there are ten
SAs who are working either exclusively or virtually exclusively

.on the CIP and IGA program who have not developed TEs.

Although all ten Agents have PCs their progress should be
closely followed to insure their participation in the
development of TEs. In this regard you may desire to
reiterate provisions of the Manual of Instructions to the
Agents on the program concerning the eta of TE
informants. | 7

All Agents are to be reminded that in dealing with
informants, they are to be particularly alert and not
leave themselves open for criticism or false accusations.
The importance of having an alternate contacting Agent
or another Agent along during the course of certain
interviews is advisable in case any compromising situation
is attempted.

With the recent enactment of Senate Bill 30 you
shoulid concentrate on increasing your informant coverage in
the areas covered by this legislation. Also in regard to
the passage of Senate Bill 30 dealing with gambling, which
you are aware does not now require interstate activity, you
should not overlook the utilization of your racial informants
to furnish information to your office concerning gambling
activities. Other divisions of the Bureau have been
particularly successful in coordinating the information
from racial informants in to the CIP and IGA programs.

Statisiical Accomplishments: - --

During the fiscal year (fy) you recorded two convictions
in the CIP-IGA category. During the fy 1970 your office had
three convictions. During the first three months of fy 1971
you have recorded one conviction in this category.

According to the information furnished by your office
you have four cases pending prosecution, two of which are
in the 159 (LMRDA-IM) category and two are in the 92
(Anti-Racketeering) category. Only one of these cases is
in the CIP-IGA program. A review of your files indicates
that in file 179-24 in a case captioned JAMES FRATIANNO,
EXTORTIONATE CREDIT TRANSACTION (ECT), the subject was
indicted:under Title 18, Section 894 of the U.S. Code.
Your office was working the case under AntizRacketeering
classification and the file was opened after the ECT
indictment.

In-regard-to the possible statistical accomplishments,
from the above file it would appear the local office of the
United States Attorney will seek indictments under the ECT
statute. A review of your cases in this category reveal only
three Office of Origin cases. The files also indicate instances
wherein there are shylocking activities among the gamblers
where there are large debts outstanding. A review of your



; "30

file-165~-100 on Kenneth Joseph Zahnd, aka; Morris Cooper,
ITWI, indicates the local office of the United States Attorney
appears to be in no rush to seek Grand Jury indictments on
gambling matters. If the local office of the United States
Attorney will entertain prosecution under ECT and is in

no rush to seek indictments under the gambling statute,

you should review at squad conferences with Agents assigned
to the program provisions of SAC letter 68-46 dated August

20, 1968 wherein provisions of the ECT statute are set forth.

In relation to statistical accomplishments, prior
experience has shown a direct relationship between Office
of Origin cases in a particular classification and statistical
accomplishments. As of September 30, 1970 your monthly
administrative report reflects the following Office of Origin
cases in the categories enumerated: 7

A review of the monthly administrative reports since
the last inspection indicates your office of origin cases
-has remained fairly constant since the last inspection.
With the increase of manpower on this program and the
addition of informant development since the last inspection
it is anticipated that your office should be in position at
this point to begin to show results in regard to the
statistical accomplishment phase of this program.

Supervision And Manpower

The CIP and IGA program is supervised by Supervisor
Charles N. Hiner. Discussions with Supervisor Hiner and
personnel assigned to the program indicate a very enthusiastic
approach to the problems involved in this program.

Immediately prior to the last inspection, by letter
May 29, 1970 captioned "CRIMINAL INTELLIGENCE PROGRAM,
ASSIGNMENT OF ADDITIONAL MANPOWER," you advised the Bureau
of the addition of ten Agents to be assigned exclusively
to this program. Your success since that time has been
noted by the addition of one conviction in 1970 vs. 1969.
Also you have added three TEs to the program and seven
additional PCs. This is to your credit and you are’ encouraged
to continue this favorable trend. However, the collection
of. intelligence information, though very important, is only
one phase of this program. The other. phase of the program
which must receive close supervision and personal attention
is the obtaining of convictions to fulfill the Bureau's
responsibility toward statistical accomplishments.

: In regard to statistical accomplishments, other
divisions of the Bureau have been very successful in

the utilization of Title 3. The utilization of Title 3
requires extensive use of waupower and if the Title 3 you
are presently awaiting approval is approved you should
judiciously use manpower in the operation _ the Title 3
installation.

In regard to the utilization of manpower, it is
imperative that all Agents assigned to this program show
, the necessary zeal to accomplish the desired results of
intelligence information and statistical accomplishments.
In the event any Agents assigned to the program fail to
show the necessary enthusiasm consideration should be given
to-the reassignment of those Agents to other squads.

Administration And Files

Several instances were noted wherein the "pink sheet"
were not completed although the informant files have been
opened for a considerable period of time. The following

There were four instances wherein you were instructed
during the last inspection to complete the pink sheet and
although 14 months have passed since last inspection these
pink sheets have not been completed. While failure to
complete the pink sheet when instructed does not necessarily
indicate an Agent's enthusiasm in working this program, it
does not show the desired attitude. These four instances
are as follows:

137-4768
137-5015
137-4945
137-5016

A review of your 162 files indicates several instances
wherein Bureau instructions were not followed. These Bureau
instructions were set torth in Bureau airtel dated April 2,
1969, captioned "INTERSTATE GAMBLING ACTIVITY MATTERS." This
is found in your file 162-00-21. Briefly, these instructions
stated that the 162 classification should be reserved for
"intelligence-type" inquiries and that substantive cases
should be opened under the proper classification. These
files which were opened on individual gamblers were as

Dissemination

“Your office has been very successful in obtaining
favorable ‘results in dissemination of information to local
law enforcement agencies concerning local violations
developed during the investigation. You are encouraged
to continue this favorable trend; however, you should
bear in mind that violations ihat were strictly local in
nature previously may now be covered by the recent enactment
of Senate Bill 30. Those which are determined to be Federal
violations, of course, should be prosecuted in Federal

court,

New Legislation
A review of your files indicates you have complied
‘with Bureau letter dated January 27, 1970, concerning the
then proposed Senate Bill 30. You should closely follow
: guidelines formulated by the Bureau in regard to this
new legislation in order that your office will be abreast

of the latest information so that the Bureau's responsibilities
in the organized crime field can be fulfilled.

Observations and Instructions

‘ (1) Provisions of Title 3, the Extortionate Credit
| Transaction statute and of the Manual of Instructions
concerning the qualification of TEs should be reiterated

to all Agents on the program at squad conferences.

: (2) You should stress to all Agents on the program
the necessity of developing quality TEs.

A239.

(3) You should stress the necessity of proper
utilization of Title 3 installations as other field divisions
have been very successful in this regard in obtaining a
backlog of potential statistical accomplishments.

(4) You should concentrate on quality cases which
have prosecutive potential which will obtain the desired ©
statistical accomplishments.

SELECTIVE SERVICE MATTERS Pl deMe5

INSPECTOR anotr’. LARSON: The following ‘comments, <

observations, recommendations
and instructions are being made after an in-depth review of
a representative number of your Selective Service Act matter
cases and administrative files along with conversations with
supervisory and Agent personnel and review of the answers to
questions in a separate yellow (4-M-5):

The San Francisco area is a
haven to draft dodgers and this undesirable situation will
not be reversed until we make this area unattractive for
“pums,""hippies," and members of white and black extremist
groups who come to San Francisco in order to avoid the draft.
Several obstacles must be surmounted in order to reverse this
undesirable situation. The indifferent attitude that the
judges have displayed to date must be reversed towards a
tough handling of Selective Service Act violators. Supervisory
ang Agent personne] muct maintain an aggressive attitude and
continue to be a leader in streamlining processing procedures
by the United States Attorney's Office and various Selective
Service Boards to insure that these violators are promptly
prosecuted in the courts. Every technique available to the
Bureau should be used to get the judges, United States
Attorney and public riled up about this ridiculous situation.
Aggravated violators should be put in jail.

5 There are 2,983 "hippie-type”
communes in the San Francisco Division comprising in excess

i of 20,000 population. 1,050 of these communes are located in

_ the Berkeley and Oakland areas comprising in excess of!10,000
population and 43 communes are known to be violently oriented.
Your office has eight subjects who have committed Selective
Service Act violations that are members of white and black
extremist groups. Every effort should be made to take these
individuals out ofcirculation by placing them in jail.
Information concerning their activities with extremist groups
should be furnished to the probation officers so that they
can so inform the judges in their presentencing report. All
Agents handling Racial Matters and Selective Service Act
Matters should be periodically reminded to be on the alert

It is evident from the
backlog of cases awaiting trial (414), backlog of cases

_ awaiting prosecutive action by the Federal Grand Jury

(749) and the fact that these violations are being re-
ceived by your office at the average rate of 175 cases

per month, that something must be done to get these

cases before the courts. The most aggravated cases should
be singled out and tried first, particularly those indi-
viduals who are members of extremist groups. Experience
has shown that after several subjects have received rigid
sentences, and a widely publicized trial, that many subjects
enter guilty pleas hoping for lesser sentences by avoiding
the Government the expense of a trial.

It is recognized the San .
Francisco Division has been most forcefully making every
effort to expedite the handling of these cases, particularly
through the judiciary. Indications are that the relatively
newly appointed United States Attorney is sympathetic and
receptive to the problem and is making an effort to diminish
the backlog of cases awaiting Grand Jury presentations, but
it is recognized once an indictment is returned, it is then
up to the judiciary to proceed through the final step, to

.whic¢h they have not been particularly receptive. They have

not responded enthusiastically to handling these matters in
Federal Court.

It is obvious the Federal
Judges in Northern California (San Francisco Division) have
resisted any and all pressures brought to bear upon them
concerning this problem. In my analysis of this situation,
I have determined that the United States Attorney's Office,
personnel of the FBI, and Selective Service personnel have
all attempted to influénce the Judges in handling these
matters more expeditiously to no avail. Furthermore, within
recent months there has been wide-spread nation-wide publicity
relative to their coddling and minimizing this particular
problem. This apparently has had no effect upon them. It
would, therefore, appear that the various Federal Judges
will not react to this problem unless some superior influential
individual or group can forcefully bring this matter to théir
attention, particularly if such individual or group is one
which the Federal Judges would respect. The obvious answer
is the Administrator of the Courts for the Federal Judicial
System in Washington, D.C. and/or Chief Justice of the Supreme
Court, WARREN BURGER.

NW 65360 Docld:32989637 Page 393 atl

-5- 4-M-5

You are, therefore, instructed
to suggest to the Bureau that the contents of the letterhead
memorandum setting forth this overall problem be brought to
the attention of the Attorney General with the further sug-
gestion that the Attorney General bring this matter to the
attention of the Administrator of the Courts of the Federal

_ Judicial System and/or Chief Justice BURGER for his analysis
and information, and the further suggestion he may desire to
communicate with the Chief Federal Judge in San Francisco
relative to these matters. i -

SAC, ASAC, Supervisory and
Agent personnel should take advantage of every opportunity
to personally discuss this aggravated situation with the
United States Attorney, Selective Service Board officials,
SAC contacts and other prominent individuals to get them
riled up about this ridiculous situation. Tnsure tha a

. continuous close liaison is maintained by supervisory and
Agent personnel with United States Attorney's Office and
various local draft board officials to insure that these
€ases are promptly processed and prosecuted.

‘! Your office in April, 1969
suggested to the former United States Attorney that arresting
.several inductees on the spot might have a favorable effect
upon lowering the rate of refusals at the Oakland Induction
Center. The only objection given by the former United States
Attorney was that the case of the registrant must be presented
to the Federal Grand Jury within two weeks after arrest. Due
to your effective liaison, most of the "bottlenecks" have been
worked out between the Selective Service Board and United
States Attorney's Office in which these arrests can now be
effected. You shauld be alert to members of extremist groups
who will fail to step forward at the time of their induction
and appropriately arrange with the United States Attorney for
authority to arrest these individuals on the spot. You should
insure that such arrests are given adequate press coverage.
Such plans should be brought to the attention of the Bureau F
for their consideration in making a national press release, |
if warranted.

Statistical Accomplishments and Administrative Handling of Cases

As of 9/30/70, you had 1,873 origin Selective
Service matters (1,799 active and 74 inactive). Between
March and September 1970 you received 1,186 Selective Service
Act matters for investigation, an average of 169 (1,186 -.7)
per month. As of 10/23/70, 1,163 of the origin cases were
completed. 749 cases are awaiting the United States
Attorney's (USA) prosecutive decision, and 414 cases involve
indictments of subjects and are awaiting trial. The case
load is split about in half between Headquarters City and
Resident Agents. 17 Agents are assigned to Squad 6 who
handle only Selective Service Act (SSA) matters and their
informants. One Agent has been on extended sick leave.
Approximately 18 Resident Agents spend between 60 to 100%
of their time on Selective Service Act matters. During
the fiscal year 1970, ending 6/30/70, you recorded 74
convictions and for the first four months of fiscal year 1971, |

ending 9/20/70, you have recorded $ convictions. i
+

The procedures followed by your office concerning
the immediate handling of subjects who refuse to step forward
at the Armed Forces Examining and Entrance Station, Oakland, 4
California, appear to save Agent time and Government expense
and should be continued. It is noted, however, that several
months elapse between the time the Subject is interviewed and

. ‘the time the United States Attorney makes his prosecutive
decision since he insists that the Selective Service file be
processed and forwarded to his office by the State Director of
the Selective Service Board. You should have Headquarters
eity Agents continue close liaison with Selective Service
Boards and the United States Attorney's Office to insure that

- these cases receive expeditious processing and are presented to
the, Federal Grand Jury at an early date.

Current administrative procedures Pears barrie in
these refusal type cases are as follows:-

The Induction Officer at the Armed Forces. Examining
and Entrance Station, Oakland, California, calls an Oakland .
Agent when there is going to be one or more inductees who will
vefuse to submit to induction. Inductions are handled on
a Wednesday of each week. The Special Agent witnesses the
refusal, conducts a short interview of the Subject, and in
almost every instance secures an admission from the Subject
that he knew he was violating the law and that he had thought

about this matter carefully before refusing to step

forward. The Agent during this interview obtains the Subject 's
current address which is generally different from the one he
furnished the Selective Service Board. The Agent places

the Subject on notice as to what probably will occur as to an
indictment, summons, etc. The Subject is cautioned to remain
in touch with his Local Draft Board in order to avoid being

a Bureau fugitive. 7

A case is immediately opened and assigned to the | a
Oakland Agent who prepares a report. Information copies of
the report are furnished to the local USA, San Francisco:and
the field office and the USA covering the Subject's draft
board when located in another division. It is the USA's :
opinion (San Francisco) that the refusal to step forward takes
precedence over any prior delinquencies and will be handled .
by the USA, San Francisco. Instructions are given in leads al
to Headquarters city Agents and/or auxiliary offices to
closely follow the Local Board to insure that all pertinent
information regarding the Subject is promptly furnished
to the USA, San Francisco.

In order to streamline the administrative handling Pl
of these matters as well as keeping the Bureau fully
informed of the activity you are taking in these matters to
insure prompt prosecutive handling, the following instructions
- should be followed: :

: All refusal cases and all other cases in which
- the investigation is completed should be reassigned to three or
- four Headquarters city Agents. These Agents will have
the responsibility of getting these cases to the Federal
Grand Jury and on the trial calendar. Those cases in which
the subject becomes a fugitive should be reassigned to another
case Agent. :

At the present time there are 1163 cases pending
prosecutive action. In order.to eliminate status letters and
reports to the Bureau in these type cases, the following
procedures should be followed.

Memos to the SAC should be placed in individual
files to keep them from becoming delinquent. When the
Subject is indicted the Bureau should be immediately advised
in each individual case. Beginning 10/30/70 and continuing
on the 15th and 30th of each subsequent month, you are to
advise the Bureau, by letter, entitled "SELECTIVE SERVICE ACT
MATTERS, SAN FRANCISCO DIVISION" of the activity conducted,

which would include the total number of cases presented

- to the Federal Grand Jury during the prior two week period,
identifying each case by San Francisco file number, Bureau
file number and title; the number of cases completed and
awaiting Federal Grand Jury action; number of new cases
received for investigation and general comments concerning
the attitude of the USA's Office and U.S. District Courts
concerning these matters. Also you should comment on any
favorable publicity being given these matters by the local
press media.

In the refusal cases the Bureau should be specifically
advised of the status of a case within five months after the
violation, The USA should be requested to advise of the
prosecutive action he intends to take in each case and this
information reported in the individual file.

. It is felt that better liaison can be mdiniained
with the USA's Office when only two or three Special Agents
present these cases in a group thereby eliminating 30 to 35
different Agents presenting their cases separately. The
Bureau will be kept advised on a semi-monthly basis of
the activities of your office in getting these SSA matters
through the courts. The above procedures will eliminate
‘the dictation and typing of approximately 750 pages each
month,

There are a sufficient number of SSA cases in
Berkeley, Oakland, San Jose and San Francisco for your
consideration of having a Special Clerk handle the
. review of Selective Service Board records. You should
closely review these situations in these particular areas
and if warranted recommendations for hiring Special Clerks.

ADMINISTRATIVE MEMORANDUM

Administrative Handling of Theft
From Interstate Shipment Cases in
: the San Francisco Division

‘ :
INSPEC OR“ ARNOLD C. LARSON: During the course of the

l inspection of the San Francisco
Office a review was made of 140 Theft From Interstate Shipment
cases. Instances were noted wherein Bureau Regulations
‘concerning the handling of these cases were not followed. Set
forth below are instances noted during this review:

In the following cases, it was noted the amount
involved appeared to be a minor amount and there appeared to
be no aggravating circumstances concerning these violations.
In some instances concerning the cases which originated at the
San Francisco Airport, it was noted the file indicated there
was a possibility of an individual at the airport being involved
in the theft. However, it is felt it is not necessary to keep
open all the minor cases in order to determine which, if any,
employees at the airport may be involved. These cases where
minor amounts are involved are as follows:

The FBI Handbook, Part II, Chapter 73, Paragraph
F, Page 192, states as follows:

"If complaint is received involving a

minor Theft From Interstate Shipment where there

are no known aggravating or unusual circumstances,
immediately present facts to USA for prosecutive
opinion. If USA will not consider Federal prose-
cution, conduct no investigation, advise complainant,
and, where appropriate, refer matter to law enforce-
ment agency having jurisdiction. Confirm to USA and
complainant in writing opinion and action taken."

None of t mentioned cases reviewed indicate
you are referring minor violations to the U. S. Attorney to
determine if he would prosecute in the event a subject was

identified.

There were numerous incidents wherein information
- had been received and the file contained no FD-302s and no
jndication that the FD-302s had been dictated.

The following is a list of these files which includes
only those files wherein the case is at least 15 calendar days
old. These files are identified as follows:

(| -surERVISOR GLENN A. HARTER: 1) This office received a
of} 10/28/70 letter from the U.S. Attorney

dated 6/24/69 wherein the
U.S. Attorney advised that they would not undertake prosecution
of minor theft cases. The letter set the guide as those
eases of value of less than $100. This office has been
following the interpretation of minor thefts as those having
a value of less than $100. It was the judgment of this
office that Hout all of the airport thefts involved amounts
in excess of $100. It appears that an average loss at the
airport would average an estimated $250, it being noted that
the airline companies currently are paying up to $500 per
bag. Therefore, these cases were not judged to be minor

eases and had not been discussed with the U.S. Attorney as

“their value exceeded $100. In following this policy San
Francisco believed that they were in compliance with Section 94
of the Manual regarding presentation of minor cases to the

us. Attorney. In the future this office vill immediately
present cases of the type cited by the Inspector to the

U.S. Attorney before any investigation is conducted and

will consider suitcase type thefts as minor cases.

2)Submission of FD 302s. Regarding
the fact that I had not detected that FD 302s were not
included in the 25 files listed by the Inspector, I would
like to explain that 13 of these files were opened after
September 22 and I had not reviewed any of these files
as yet on tickler and thereby would not have had an
opportunity to detect the fact that the FD 302 was not
listed. The remaining files have not all been available
for review at this time but it is obvious that some of
these files did not have FD 302s prepared +~.- promptly.

3)NCIC Entries. Three of the
four files listed where NCIC entries had not been made
had not as yet been reviewed on ticklers since they had been
received in this office. One of the four files, 15-11994, re-
flects a suitcase claim check number which is not suitable
for entry into the NCIC.

4) File 15-11981 was recommended
to be opened by the case Agent as he felt that this
shipment involved personnel and circumstances which
would be logically worked in connection with other existing
TFIS cases and that it might be a lever for possible
informant development. The Agent hoped to work this case
even though it was not a Federal violation and obtain an

AS3,



~6-

informant and utilizing the Subject's complicity in the
case as a possible lever. It was believed that he
could obtain a criminal informant.

I regret very much that it was
necessary for the Inspector to call to my attention the
matters referred to in this administrative write-up. I
will take the necessary action to insure that minor cases
are immediately presented to the U.S. Attorney, that FD 302s
are immediately prepared, that NCIC numbers be immediately
entered where pertinent so that it will not be necessary
for these matters to be called to my attention again.

SAC ROBERT E. GEBHARDTS The USA advised this office by
: letter dated 7/16/69 that the
FBI should no longer present minor theft cases to the USA's

. office and that these cases should be deferred to local

courts. The office has followed the policy set down. by the
‘USA and has utilized his guideline of $100 as a minor case.

In view of his policy, the office has not been receiving minor
theft cases, as the local business community has been made
aware of the policy of the USA and has not been referring
minor cases to the office.

Occasionally some minor case is received from
someone not aware of the policy of the USA's office in not
prosecuting cases having a value of less than $100. In the
future when a complaint is received regarding a minor theft,
the case will be immediately presented to the USA and after
his declination, the office will advise the complainant and
the USA's office in writing and where appropriate, refer the
complaint to the local law enforcement agency having jurisdiction
ever the violation. This procedure will pe in line with the
requirements in the Manual of Inspection, Section 94.

ADDENDUM

INSPECTOR AR ge In regard to your answer to this
write-up, the following is
pointed out to you:

1. Your answer implies the inspector indicated that
all suitcase-type thefts are minor thefts. This is completely
inaccurate as each case, whether it be a suitcase or otherwise,
has to be judged on the merits of the individual case. In
the review of 140 cases there was not one single instance
wherein the United States Attorney had been consulted to
determine if the case was a minor amount and he would not
entertain prosecution even if the subject were identified.

2. Concerning the submissions of FD-302's to the
file, the following is a tabulation of cases over two months
old in which no FD-302 is in the file:

FILE NUMBER DATE OPENED

sieresa 15-11918 8/14/70
15-11816 7/6/10
15-11814 7/2/70
15-11947 8/26/70
15~11818 7/10/70
15-11902 8/25/70
15-11939 8/28/70
15~11933 8/21/70

Although the remainder of the 25 files pointed out to
you did not contain FD-302's and the files had not come
up on ticklers for your review, it is apparent with this
number of files without FD-302's the Agents are not receiving
adequate instructions in conferences concerning proper
preparing of FD-302's in TFIS cases.



~9-

3. Although it was pointed out to you wherein
NCIC entries on serial numbers had not come up for adminis-
trative review, it is apparent that several Agents on your
squad have not been properly instructed in the necessity
of immediately entering serial numbers into NCIC, It should
not be necessary for you to have to remind Agents on your
squad on a periodic file review of the necessity of entering
serial numbers into NCIC. They should not wait an extended
period of time to enter these numbers in NCIC, but the serial
-numbers should be entered immediately after they are obtained.

4, File 15-11981 was of a purely local nature and
should have been worked out of the related Federal violation
case rather than open a separate TFIS case wherein no
Federal jurisdiction was indicated in the opening serial.

DESTRUCTION OF i
CHANNELIZING MEMORANDUM

provides for the procedure to follow in the destruction of
copies of informant channelizing memoranda after the pertinent
information has been incorporated into report form.

While reviewing files during

this inspection, it was noted that copies of channelizing
memoranda are not being destroyed through the use of Form
FD-338 after the pertinent portions of the memoranda have been
incorporated into reports.

In some instances the portions

of the channelizing memoranda pertaining to specific stb jects
was of such minor importance sO 28 to preclude their use in

The growth of many of these
security files and others will necessarily continue. There-
fore, the need to utilize FD-338 is extremely desirable. You
should insure that all Agents handling these matters are
thoroughly impressed with the importance of utilizing FD-338
on a continuing basis. This form can be easily executed when
“the Agents are actually reviewing files, serial by serial, in
preparing reports. Many of these security-type files contain
old channelizing memoranda which could have been ‘destroyed at
the time previous reports were prepared. It is suggested when
future reports are prepared in these matters the respective
case agent thoroughly review the entire file to destroy those
old channelizing memoranda containing information which had
been incorporated into those previous reports.

During such individual review,
* the provisions of Manual of Rules and Regulations, vart il,
| Section 3, Page llc, which provide for the destruction of
i copies of serials could also be implemented.

Such systematic individual

| approach to the destruction of channelizing memoranda pursuant

making these files more manageable. As you are aware, the
need for additional filing space is constantly increasing

Failure to Properly Execute Daily
' Reports and Number Three Cards

Manual of Rules and Regulations, Part II, Section 2,
Pages 5 and 6, instructs that the primary purpose of number
three locator card is to show where an employee may be reached
at all times, and in the preparation of Daily Reports when
recording action performed in connection with a new case, the
title and classification followed by the word “new should be
inserted on the Daily Report.

A review of Daily Reports (FD-28) submitted by
Resident Agents (RA‘'s) in the San Francisco Office disclosed a
number of instances wherein investigative activity was
performed in new investigative matters which was identified
only by the classification and the word "new",

Several instances were also noted in Daily Reports
wherein administrative activity was identified in the file
number column as "66=", "Admin" and "66-Admin", Other Daily
Reports contained a “O" file without further identifying data
to record investigative activity.

In the preparation of Daily Reports, it is essential
these forms clearly indicate the nature of work being performed
at any given time. The use of the particular RA's administrative
file number should be confined to those instances where the
nature of work being performed relates directly to the
administrative operation of the RA,

A review of No. 3 cards disclosed instances where the
location of informant contact and the location for lunch was
not recorded, It is recognized that it is not always practical
or desirable to show the exact address of the location an
informant is to be contacted, however, the general locality
of the contact should be shown and the location for lunch
should always be recorded,

You must insure that all personnel preparing both
Daily Reports and No. 3 cards are aware of the need to properly
execute same.

Improper Administrative Handling of
Security and Racial Informant Files

inspecror/Aiinonp C. LARSON: During the inspection of the

: : San Francisco Office, a review
of files in the 134 and 170 classifications has disclosed a
number of delinquencies in the administrative handling of
these files.

It was observed that security informant reports
are being disseminated by use of the FD-306. The informant's
txue name is included in the report in accordance with
existing Bureau instructions set forth in the Manual of
Instructions, Section 107G, Page 9, Part 2a9. Some of
these reports also contained the true name of other symbol
number informants. In the latter instances copies of the
reports were channelized to the 134 administrative file
of the informant showing the file number followed by the
symb61 number; however, there was no channelization memoran-
dum for a file containing the true name of either the
informant furnishing the information or the other informant
mentioned in the report. Due to the fact copies of the
reports are not being designated for a file under the
true name of the informants, the identities of all
informants mentioned in the reports are readily apparent
to anyone reviewing the 134 file or any of the 100 case
files to which copies of the reports are channelized.

It is essential that the identities of all
informants be kept on a need to know basis and that they
be afforded maximum security. In order to avoid the
possibility of disclosing the identities of informants
through your channelization procedures, 100 dead files
should be opened under the true name.of all informants in

; SAN FRANCISCO INSPECTION

10/26/70
ALA:jtal

262.

yp NW 65360 Docld:32989637 Page 413



your office and copies of reports reflecting their true
names should be channelized to these files. In addition
to affording greater security to the informant, this
procedure will alleviate the necessity Hr designating
copies of the reports to the informant's 134 administra-
tive files and thus avoid placing unnecessary information
in these files. The channelization memoranda placed in
the 100 case files for informants should be destroyed in
accordance with instructions set forth in the Manual of
Rules and Regulations, Part II, Section 3, saaia 15,

Part m2.

With respect to racial informants at was noted
that the name of the informant is placed on the pink
sheet (FD-377) where it is only necessary to show the
serial number where his name appears in the file. It i
was further observed that in many instances reports of 4
both security and racial informants are not being properly
authenticated. Bureau instructions are that the informant's
code name should appear immediately below the last line i
of the report rather than at the bottom of the page. In |
addition, there were several instances of failure to i
indicate on the FD-306 the date that the report was
authenticated by the informants. F

Examples of the above delinquencies are located
in the following files:

134-3251 ; 134-2376

134-1834 ' 134-11

134-1046 134-2388

134-347 170-48 ;

134-970 . 170-859 : :
134-4312 170-72 Stzesstaae

As indicated from the above it is apparent that
there is a real need for all personnel conducting these
investigations to change their administrative handling
of informants and information received from them. You

shovld immediately insure that all of these employees
are fully cognizant of and are abiding by Bureau instruc-

INFORMANT CONTACTS

(eas
INSPECTOR bonis’. LARSON: Manual of Rules and Regula-
y. tions, Volume 4, Section 107,
page 6 (4a), captioned "Contacts by Agents," sets forth
instructions regarding the contacting of security informants.
It points out except in espionage and foreign nationality
matters where frequency of contact is dependent on circum-
stances, informant should be contacted as often as necessary,
but at least one personal contact should be made every two
weeks. If such frequent contact cannot be established,
specific Bureau authority should be obtained for the exception
to this requirement.

While reviewing files during
this inspection, it was noted that many of the FD-209s con-
tained in the security

tain mn th uxity informants’ files showed distinct

lapses of time beyond the prescribed period of time. As
examples, the below-listed cases failed to indicate that the
informant had been contacted in accordance with the above
requirements. These files are as follows: : i
134-3784 170+324
134-3740 f 170-368
134-4368 170-371
134-4243 170-381 i

134-3232 170-506
134-3037 . 170-513
134-2237 170-576

In view of the critical need
for quality security informants in the Bureau's operations,
the frequency of contact is important not only to continue
the rapport developed between the Agent and informant, but
to insure the informant is given sufficient assignments to
insure that his potential is exploited to the fullest. It
is essential that the FD-209 reflect the proper dates of
contacts in order that the close continuous supervision can
be afforded this important phase of Bureau work.

IMPROPER MAINTENANCE OF
157-0 (RACIAL MATTERS) FILE

inspectow/fif OLD C, LARSON: A review was made of the 157-0
(racial matters) file during
the course of the current San Francisco inspection. This
£ile contains several serials which pertain to telephone
numbers which were called from or was used to make a collect
call to the Black Panther Party (BPP) headquarters in
Oakland, California. These serials contain the identity
of the subscriber of the telephone number and further contain
instructions that investigation should be conducted to
establish if Subject is involved in BPP activities and con-
sider Subject's potential as a racial informant. +

Examples of the above-described serials are located
in the following serials:

157-0-3563 157=-0-3501
3552A 3500
3550 ~ 3499
3549 4 3498
3547 . 3490

Manual of Rules and Regulations, Part 2, Section 3,
Page 7, indicates that a zero (0) file is maintained for the
purpose of filing nonspecific information. This undesirable
trend of filing serials with leads to conduct investigation
contained thereon should be terminated. If investigation is
to be conducted, a case should be opened and beled and
investigation | conducted promptly.

SAN FRANCISCO INSPECTION
9427/70

Syoedes7 Page 418 D477



The above tabulation indicates there has been
a delay in opening cases in addition to the delay in
conducting investigation in these matters,

This is a highly undesirable trend and corrective
action should be immediately instituted to prohibit delays
of this type in this important phase of the Bureau's work.
The Black Panther Party is a violence-prone, black militant
organization and individuals connected or associated with
this group should receive prompt investigative attention.

The FBI Handbook, Part III, page 154D, instructs
that black nationalist extremists represent a threat to the
internal security of the U.S. and the investigative guide-
lines in the Manual of Instructions, Volume III, Section 87D,
concerning security investigations of individuals apply to
them. General guidelines concerning black nationalist
appear in the Manual of Instructiens, Volume IV,
Section 122. You should make certain that all personnel
handling investigations concerning racial matters are
completely familiar with the instructions as set forth in
the Manual of Instructions, and investigations are handled
pursuant thereto. :

pending files in the 157
classification (racial matters) during the course ofthe
current San Francisco inspection disclosed several instances
in which cases have been open for a significant period of time
but fail to disclose any investigative activity. These files
generally pertain to individuals whose telephone number was
either called or was used to make a collect call to the
Black Panther Party Headquarters in Berkeley and Oakland,
California. The purpose of the investigation of these
individuals is to determine if they are black militant
extremists,and in addition to evaluate their potential as

careful evaluation will
be made as to the adequacy of your Agent complement, Tabulations
have been separately requested (work paper 4-L) covering fluctuations
of Agent personnel complement, case load, case closings, and delin-
quency for the past six months and this information should be care-
fully considered by you in preparing your response.

Set forth the Agent complement which was approved at
the time of the last inspection.

Huw any Agents have you been able to divert to higher
priority work as a result of streamlining procedures instituted 7/1/70
in ITSMV and Deserter matters?

If you feel your Agent complement is adequate but not
excessive, you should so state. If you have any surplus of Agent per-
sonnel you should specify and explain. If you feel additional Agent
personnel should be assigned to your office, you should so state and
completely justify by tabulations. and other factors which you think
pertinent,

Add any other comments you feel are pertinent and as the
last sentence of your answer set forth your Agent complement as of
close of business on closest Friday to date this inspection commenced.

Agent complement at the time of the last
Inspection was 229, excluding, of course, the Agents assigned
to the Defense Language Institute, Monterey. As of 10/16/70,
Agent complement was 256, excluding those at the Language
School. As of 10/16/70, four Agents were under transfer into
the Division and one was under transfer out of the Division.
A total of 4-1/2 Agents were diverted to higher priority work
as a result of streamlining procedures instituted 7/1/70 in ITSMV
and Deserter matters.

ect oe seed Es iene et ne panna,

As the Inspector and the Bureau are aware, the
Bay Area of San Francisco has the greatest potential for violence
in the entire United States. The headquarters of the Black
Panther Party is located in Oakland. In-addition, there are
seven Black Panther community centers and a large number of
Black Panther pads in the San Francisco Bay Area.

In addition to the Black Panther Party, there is
a hard core group of militant, violence-prone New Left organi-
zations and individuals centered in this area. It is known there
are many persons in the area who are either Weathermen or espouse
the violent, militant doctrine of the Weathermen. In addition,
there are 262 individuals who have been connected with the
Venceremos Brigade living in this area and, as the Inspector
and the Bureau are aware, the Revolutionary Union organization
has numerous members in this area. This office and the present
complement of personnel have been and are making every effort
to’ fulfill its responsibilities with respect to the activities
of these violent militant groups. Since May, 1970, an additional
17 men have been added to handle these important responsibilities.
It is felt, while we are making headway, one of the prime thrusts
in our investigations of these violent groups is the realization
of the absolute necessity to develop live quality informants
within the inner core of such groups so that we can anticipate
their future activities. :

NW 65360 Docld:3298: age



_6-M-1

As the Inspector and the Bureau are aware, a
Russian Consulate will be operational in San Francisco in the
immediate future. Already four members of the Consulate have
arrived in San Francisco, including the Consul and Vice Consul.
It is known three of these four individuals are KGB agents.
There is every indication that, while they do not have a specific
physical building as yet, they are already conducting business
to a certain degree out of their hotel and apartments. Our
responsibilities in this regard have already increased and, as
soon as a physical building is established, our responsibilities
will increase tremendously.

As indicated previously, this office is making
every possible effort to fulfill its responsibilities with the
present complement of 256 Agents and will continue to do so,
since this office does recognize the over-all needs of the
Bureau with respect to ihe assignment of the Agent personnel.

ADDENDUM LL ae During the inspection a careful
» INSPECTOR’ AR}IQLD LARSON: evaluation was made as to the

ACT: dp ey adequacy of your agent compliment
10/28/70 bearing in mind the case load,

cases closed, delinquencies and types of cases assigned.

It is fully agreed that the San Francisco Office
is the hub of the Black Panther Party operations which
ereates potential for violence. It also has a concentration
of New Left and violence-oriented individuals and is a
eenter for Selective Service violators. These along with
your other responsibilities draw; heavily upon your manpower.

| Your division has a unique situation with respect
i to Selective Service cases. As of September 30, 1970, your
| office had pending 2,257 cases in this classification. In
analyzing these it was determined that many of these require
very little investigation and 1,163 are either under indictment
or awaiting proeseoutive action OF seme type. (A special
write-up has been prepared concerning Selective Service Act
eases for streamlining procedures) In analyzing the Selective
Service case load of 1,111 pending cases pequiring investigation,
approximately 50 percent are in headquarters city. There
are 16 men assigned to these investigations for an average
ease load of 34.4 of cases.
7 In an effort to determine the average case load of
this office in categories other than Selective Service,
Samos a computation was made by eliminating the Selective Service
Act cases and those agents handling (2,178 pending active
and 27 agents as of 9/30/70). It was determined that the
average case load for the remaining agents was 32.5. This
computation for the proceeding five months reflected the

following: :

August 1970 average cage load 32.7
. July 1970 7 32.5
H June 1970 7 31.1
: May 1970 31.9
: April 1970 + 3h

ATS,

NW 65360 ‘Docld:32989637 Page 427



5

With respect to the work load of the individual
squads, the following is called to your attention for
consideration in diverting personnel to assignments where
manpower is needed:

Squad 4, the case load remained almost constant
during this period (539 cases in April, 530 in September)
and one agent was added to the complement. Fl

3

Squad 5 pending active case load declined from
655 cases to 508 cases or 16 per cent while the agent
complement remained constant. As will be noted, the average
case load is approximately 29 and the type of cases handled
on this squad do not appear to be complicated or involved.
The percentage of cases closed during the period averaged
39 per cent per month, peersasaes i

Squad lu case load was analyzed for the period
from December, 1968, through September, 1970. The case
load as of the first date was 692 cases with 16 agents.

At the latter date there were 773 pending active cases with
22 agents. : :
In addition, it is recommended that maximum
utilization be made of the Special Clerk program to relieve
Special Agents for higher priority assignments. One Special
Cierk is’ recommended for the Berkeley Resident Agency for
record checks. It is suggested that you explore the use of
Special Clerks for checking Selective Service records in view
of your vast volume of cases of this type. Consider Special
Clerks for complaint duty and monitoring. :

You should constantly re-evaluate your manpower
situation and make adjustments where necessary to insure
that the Bureau's interests are being fully carried out.
Divert manpower to priority assignments and make necessary
adjustments through your re-evaluation and realignment to
insure that the work load is equitably shared, priorities
emphasized and any deficiencies corrected. Keep the Bureau
fully informed concerning your manpower and all requests
for additional manpower will be fully and closely scrutinized

- ain light of your potential for accomplishments, efficiencies
in administrative and investigation operations and the
demands placed upon the Bureau through expanded jurisdiction.

INSPECTOR Ne. RSON

Describe additional positions established since last inspection and
state whether filling of same was from approved complement or necessitated
hiring additional personnel. In any category where there has been an in-
crease or decrease set forth a specific explanation, including whether au-

_ thorization for increase was based on such things as (1) need to replace
employee on maternity leave or extended sick leave; (2) increased work
load; (3) June overhiring; or (4) transfer in to relocate employee. Where
there are increases cite Bureau communications authorizing such increases.
Reconcile any differences between your assigned personnel complement
(total clerical employees shown on tabulation) and your "authorized" com-
plement (total clerical employees approved at the last inspection - plus or
minus any changes since authorized by the Bureau).

t Third column of the tabulation should include only those vacancies
you have received authority to fill or that you intend seeking authority to
fill.

If you feel your clerical complement is adequate but not excessive,
so state. If you have any surplus of clerical personnel you should specify and

The over-all



If this increase of 10 clerks were authorized, their services
would be immediately brought to bear by utilizing two in our
indexing unit, one for closed and one for pending; three would
be used on rotor units, noting there is a heavy increase in
work in racial matters, New Left matters and on the civil
rights rotor; four of these clerks would be utilized in closed
files, primarily for indexing; and one would be utilized in
consolidation, stripping and destroying files.

Due to streamlining procedures utilized, such as
duplication of certain material from the stenographic pool,
it is felt that the present complement of 63 stenographers
and typists can handle the present work load. While this
figure is adequate, it is in no way excessive.

The complement of clerks not available to the Chief
Clerk's Office has increased from 22 to 24 from the last
inspection. A review of these positions indicates each to
be essential to the over-all discharge of our responsibilities
in the technical field. The increase of two clerks was due
to the authorization of two Special Clerk positions by Buréau
letter dated 8/10/70. These positions are deemed essential.
The personnel assigned are adequate and there is no excess.

ADDENDUM /7, ve ete :
. INSPECTOR ‘ARNOLD C. LARSON: At the time of the last Inspection
10/29/70 Y’ : your clerical complement was

fixed at 168. This would include
-82 in the Chief Clerk's Office, 63 in the Steno Pool and 23
Clerks not available to the Chief Clerk's Office.

Since that date there has been an increase of one
in the number of Clerks not available to the Chief Clerk's
Office. This was due primarily to the increase in the Special
Clerk Program.

‘It was noted that a request has been made for an
additional 10 Clerks in the Chief Clerk's Office. This matter
will be considered further at the Bureau and you will be advised
of the results. It is noted, however, that you are 6 under your
authorized complement in the Chief Clerk's Office. An analysis
of your turnover of personnel in the Chief Clerk's Office during
the past two years reflects that your complement has averaged
6 under authorized strength almost constantly. Every effort
should be made to bring your complement up to strength

NW 65360 Docld:32989637 Page 436 as?



It is agreed that the present stenographic complement

- Of 63 is adequate but not excessive. Also, your complement of
clerks not available to the Chief Clerk's Office (24) is adequate
but not excessive. It should be noted, however, that elsewhere
in the Inspection Report you have been encouraged to utilize the
Special Clerk Program to its maximum to make Agents available
for higher priority assignments. This should be done and it is
believed that any clerks taken from the Chiéf Gierk!s Office for
this purpose sacuie be replaced.

To reinstitute our clerical Applicant
Recruiting Program, should the necessity
arise, we would recontact our many sources
of clerical Applicants and make known to
them that we are once again actively
recruiting. This would include sources in
not only Headquarters City but also in the
RA territory. We would also consider
utilizing Special Agents on a part-time basis,
in both Headquarters City and RAs to meet
the needs of the Bureau.

Public and parochial high schools are our most
productive sources of qualified clerical
Applicants.

Individual assignments have been made throughout

the division designating an agent as a liaison

representative with each public and parochial

high school as well as business schools and
ilcges.

Also the Applicant Coordinator as well as other
agents appear at high schools on a constant
basis for career type speeches and serve on

San Francisco had a clerical applicant quota of 16
for the period July,'1969, through May, 1970 (at which time
the quota was removed). During that period, 12 clerical
employees entered on duty .at the Seat of Government. Your
quota was met or exceeded during 5 of the 11 months. It is
: to be noted, however, that since May, 1970, 15 additional
i clerical employees have entered on duty from San Francisco
as a result of your recruiting efforts expended during the

quota months.

Even though quotas have been removed, you should
continue recommending highly qualified clerical applicants
\ and should continue liaison with sources in the event it
: becomes necessary to reinstitute an aggressive clerical
recruiting program on a very short notice,

Since June, 1969, 16 Special Agents have entered on
duty from San Francisco. By teletype dated 9/23/70, you were
advised that New Agents' Classes were being scheduled on a
weekly basis beginning 10/5/70, and effective 10/14/70, each
office was placed on a quota of one Special Agent per week.

You are reminded that applicants who possess a four year

resident college degree may be considered for the position

of Special Agent provided they possess one year of executive,
administrative or investigative type experience. Noncommissioned
officers may be considered provided they have at least two

years of military service. .In addition, clerical employees

who possess a four year resident college degree may be considered
for the Special Agent position upon completion of one year

of continuous Bureau service.

It is imperative that the Special Agent recruitment
program be given top priority and every effort should be made
to insure that there are a sufficient number of available
applicants processed so that your quota of one Special Agent
per week will be met without fail.

SUGGESTION MEMORANDUM

DESIGNATION OF ROTOR H
NUMBER ON FILE JACKET ©

snsescnon jock. ransom During the inspection of the

“ San Francisco Office, it has
been observed that several pending files failed to contain
the rotor or desk number on the file cover. In those instances
where the rotor number has been placed on the file cover in ink,
| it is often small and hard to read.

To facilitate the routing of pending files by
clerical employees to the eleven rotors throughout the
San Francisco Office, it is suggested that the rotor number
be placed on top of the file jacket with a large stamp. You
should devise a system which would include maintaining a stamp
on each rotor and at the time a new case is opened the rotor
clerk should stamp on top of the file jacket the number of the
rotor which handles the particular pending case.

The adoption of this system would allow not only
employees of the CCO to more expeditiously route pending files
but would also be of assistance to stenographic and other per-
sonnel when they are routing files to the various rotors
throughout the office.

7 This procedure would specially aid in the routing
of files where the classification is split between two desks
such as the 42-classification.

on 3/16/67, assigned to SA

GERARD JAMES NORTON of the Richmond, California, Resident

Agency. It is supervised by SA RAY M. ANDRESS.

A review of this file reveals the Subject was de-
elared delinquent by Local Board #30, Richmond, California,
on 3/9/67, for failure to report for induction on 8/17/66.
The whereabouts of the Subject have been unknown since 3/16/67,
and considerable investigation has been conducted to locate
him. Information was developed in March, 1970, that Subject
“ was possibly in Canada and a friend of Subject's mother advised
in September, 1970, that the Subject is in Canada, but that his
mother does not have an address for him. The Subject is re-
ported to telephone his mother on occasions. Other neighbors
“ and police have reported Subject to be in Canada at the present
time.
In view of the above, the following action should be
promptly initiated in an effort to ascertain the location of
the Subject:

1. Prepare a letterhead memorandum, in accordance }
with instructions set forth in the Manual of Rules and Regu-
lations, Part II, Section 4, page 14 (2) (a) I and SAC letter
#70-27, dated 5/19/70, in order that information regarding

INSPECTOR fang ra « LARSON: This is a pending case in the
us San Francisco Office which was
opened in July 1969 and is presently assigned to SA JEAN G.
HUGHES. It is supervised by SA H. ERNEST WOODBY.

Extended investigation has been conducted since
inception of this case in the neighborhood of Subject's parents,
1132 South Sage Court, Sunnyvale, California. When case was
initiated, it was determined Subject's family had moved from
870 EL Camino, Mountain View, California, the address shown on
Subject's DD 553 in 12/68 which was prior to Subject's
reported absence from the military in 4/69. Subject's
parents have appeared to be cooperative amd although present
| neighbors of Subject's parents are nct well acquainted with
: the Subject, they are cooperative and a neighborhood source
has been established.

Subject entered military service in 9/66 at San Jose,
California, at which time he was approximately 20 years of
age. Since initiation of this investigation, additional past
residences have been developed for Subject's parents at 278
Lassen Avenue, Mountain View, California in 9/63; 620 East
Mauded Avenue, Sunnyvale, California in 7/68 and 1390 Latham
Street, Mountain View, in 7/68. A neighbor has indicated
Subject may have a brother but could furnish no specific
information concerning his identity. Attempts to establish
residence at the Latham Street address have been negative.
Mail returned to the U.S. Army addressed to the Latham Street
address indicated a possible residence of Apartment 101, 1617
Pine Street, San Francisco, California. Investigation has
also indicated past employment for the Subject at Channing
House, Palo Alto, California, for a period not stated.

In view of the fact Subject had already entered

the following areas to develop background and associates of
Subject which may be of assistance in determining his present
whereabouts and causing his apprehension:

1. Re-interview parents specifically concerning
the identity of any possible brothers or sisters
or other close relatives Subject might logically
contact.

2. Conduct in depth investigation in areas of
family's former residences, correlating this
inquiry with results of re-interview of parents,
“to develop former employments or associates of
Subject who may be able to furnish information
concerning his present whereabouts.

3. Conduct inquiry at Pine Street address in
San Francisco to develop background information
of possible assistance in this investigation.

4. Check records at Channing House, Palo Alto,
to determine if Subject formerly employed there
and for possible leads to associates of Subject,
such as listed references or indicated residences.

5. Conduct appropriate credit and criminal
checks at Palo Alto and San-Francisco.

6. Inasmuch as Subject has been absent for a
-period in excess of one year, consideration
should be given to contacting Baltimore Source

SUGGESTION MEMORANDUM
BOND DEFAULT MATTERS

of wh C. LARSON: As of 10/1/70, the San Francisco

Office had 48 bond default
matters under investigation. This volume of cases presents
a fertile field for increased convictions under the Bond
Default classification.

An in depth survey conducted by the Inspection
Division disclosed that there has been a significant
increase in cases received by the FBI for investigation
subsequent to the passage of the Bail Reform Act of 1966.
This Act liberalized bail and bond procedures in Federal
cases whereby subjects were to be considered for release
on their own persoiiai récognizance or unsecured appearance
bond in contrast to previous procedures which required a
specific bond, creating an excellent opportunity for us
to achieve statistical accomplishments. The ratio of
convictions to the number of cases investigated in bond
default matters is one of the highest of any violation
handled by the Bureau.

One of our offices, namely San Diego, has been
responsible for the most significant portion of the Bureau's
convictions in bond default matters as a result of effective
liaison with the U. S. Attorney, who felt that an indictment
obtained under bond default was more easily proven than
the substantive offense. When a subject is apprehended,
the sentence is, in part, influenced by the U,. S. Attorney,
who informs the court the length of time the subject's
apprehension has been sought by the Bureau. A number of
these cases have arisen through charges of narcotics and
smuggling of merchandise and aliens across the border.
Subjects were brought before a magistrate, and rather than
pleading guilty, subjects obtained a court appointed

: . attorney and entered a not guilty plea. They were released
- then on either personal recognizance or a minimum bond until

their scheduled appearance. When the subject failed to
appear in court, a bench warrant was issued, San Diego opened
a case, and usually within 30 days an indictment was secured
under bond default.

SAN FRANCISCO INSPECTION

eaee ee

Although San Francisco is not a border office,
it is a great port of entry, both by sea and air, and many
of the same type cases utilized by San Diego for obtaining
a bond default indictment should be available to San
‘Francisco.

As you are aware, convictions are becoming more
difficult to obtain because of the court's interpretation
of the law in many classifications. Bond default matters
present an excellent opportunity to increase your conviction
rate, therefore, it is suggested that through your liaison
with the U. S. Attorney, point out to him the possibilities
for an increase in convictions under the Bond Default
Statute.

The necessity to establish effective liaison with
the U. S. Attorney in bond default matters was set out in
SAC Letter 70-13 dated 3/17/70.

If an increase in cases and convictions is obtained
as a result of this Suggestion Memorandum, advise the
Bureau by routing slip, attention Inspection Division.

“Comments of Supervisor DE JEAN and SAC GEBHARDT

requested.
sunsaip reas M. DE JEAN: Close liaison will continue to
10/26/70" be maintained with the United States

Attorney's office and all avenues

of potential eonvictions will be
vigorously pursued to increase the statistical aecomplishments
in the San Francisco Division. :

This matter will be followed and the
Inspection Division will be advised if -
an inerease in cases and convictions is
obtained.

Desk #9000 a

On 10/8/70, 1:30 A.M., a bomb which had been placed
in the women's restroom adjacent to a courtroom in the Marin
County Civic Center exploded, causing damage in excess of
$150,000 to the restroom, courtroom #4, and the surrounding
area. This bombing appeared to coincide with bombings
occurring fn the ROTC Rnilding at the University of Washington
in Seattle and the National Guard Armory at Santa Barbara.
These bombings came two days after BERNARDINE DOHRN, speaking
for the Weatherman organization, warned of a "fall offensive"
by that organization.

A member of the night maintenance crew at the Civic
Center advised he noted a white male in his early twenties,
clean cut, normal dress in the area at 10:20 P.M. He also
noted a white female in early twenties inthe area on three
occasions between 7:30 P.M. and 10:30 P.M.

This case received wide-spread publicity because
it followed the recent kidnap and murder of Judge HALEY at
the same Marin County Civic Center. President NIXON commented
on these bombings at a news conference, indicating his interest
in the matter.

On 9/22/70, during the course of the inspection of

a oueueese C. LARSON: This is a pending origin case,
opened 7/8/70, assigned to
SA SAMUEL A. MILLER, Hayward, California, Resident Agency,
and supervised by SA GLENN A, HARTER. By memorandum dated
7/7/70, SA MILLER advised he had received information from
PAUL A. FOX, Terminal Manager, Lee Way Trucking Company,
Doolittle Boulevard, San Leandro, California, that the
above-mentioned Lices were missing from the company and were
presumed to be stolen. Accompanying the memorandum was an
FD~302 showing interview with FOX and the memorandum contained
three (3) leads for additional investigation. As of 10/27/70,
there was no additional information in the file to indicate
that investigation had been conducted,

-EXPLANATIONS REQUESTED

i. SA SAMUEL A. MILLER is requested to explain the
delayed investigation and/or reporting in this matter; specifi-
cally, why he failed to cover the three (3) leads set forth
in the memorandum reporting this possible theft.

explain why, in his overall supervision of this case, he failed
to detect the delayed investigation on the part of SA MILLER.

SA SAMUEL A. MILLER: The Inspector has requested my
explanation as to why there was
a delayed investigation and/or reporting in this matter.
I am sorry it was necessary for the Inspector to call this
to my attention. My investigation failed to identify the
subject, and I have not yet dictated a closing memorandum.
In the future I will dictate more promptly.

Sf soPERVISOR GLENN A. HARTER: SA MILLER is a very thorough and
experienced all-around, excellent

agent, who has done a very good job in obtaining statistical
accomplishments for this office in criminal matters. I have
specifically discussed this case with him, and he was aware
of the fact that it was delinquent. It should be noted that
during the last month and a half, a majority of SA MILLER's
time has been taken up with the investigation of two bank
robberies and leads in two civil rights cases, all of which
were treated 4s specials , and these factorc are, in part,
responsible for this delinquency. It is regretable that it
was necessary for the Inspector to bring this delinauency
to the attention of the office, and steps will be taken to
insure that it will not happen *again.

, SAC ROBERT E. GEBHAR I have urged the need for prompt
: investigation, which did take
place in this case. I have also stressed to SA MILLER and
_ Supervisor HARTER the need for prompt reporting.

Comments of SA ANDRESS and SAC requested,

SA RICHARD ,GUY MILLER: At the beginning of the interview at the
10/27/70 Humboldt County Jail, Eureka, California,

I exhibited my FBI credentials to the
subject and advised him of the nature of the inquiry. I

. ‘apparently inadvertently failed to record this in the opening

paragraph of the FD 302 and on review of this FD 302 I
inadvertently failed to note this had been omitted from the
FD 302. Care will be exercised in the future to insure this
does not reoccur.

SA RICHARD E, LUEBBEN: I was Relief Supervisor on Desk #6 in the
10/27/70 absence of the regular supervisor and due
: to the exceptionally high volume of mail
handled by this desk I inadvertently failed to note the above
omission from FD 302 of SA MILLER dated 9/1/70 when the report
was signed out by me. Every effort will be made in the future

to avoid a repitition of this delinquency.

RAS

SA RAYMOND py: DRESS: In reference to the report of SA RICHARD GUY
10/27/70 i MILLER signed out by SA LUEBBEN on 9/3/70,
: SA LUEBBEN was one of the Relief Supervisors
during my extended sick leave during this period. SA LUEBBEN is an
experienced Relief Supervisor and supervises the desk in a very
efficient and commendable manner. Due to the exceptionally heavy
volume of mail during this time, he inadvertently overlooked the
omission in the FD 302 of SA MILLER. The importance of advising

on 7/24/69, assigned to SA JEAN G. HUGHES and reassigned

on 12/8/69, to SA KENNETH W. SHEETS. Case is supervised

by SA ROBERT D. ROBY. :

Review of the file indicates the Subject together
with two other Navy deserters had lived in a hippie commune
: in the San Jose area during August of 1969. Investigation has
determined that he has used narcotics and has associated with
| hippie-type individuals until the present time.

sees During 8/70, investigation was conducted in San

fect Jose and investigation determined that one JOAN BAUER was

' also residing in a hippie fashion and was acquainted with the

| Subject of this investigation as well as the other two Navy
» deserters, :

On 8/13/70, JOAN C. BAUER was interviewed at which
time she stated she is employed at National Aeronautics
Space Agency (NASA), Ames Research Center, as a secretary
at Moffett Field, a Navy installation. During the course
-of this interview, she stated she was living with a male
individual in a common-law relationship. She had formerly
considered herself a member of a "family" of hippies
including the Subject and another Navy deserter, At the
time of interview she advised that the members of this
hippie "family" received mail at her address and the reason
for maintaining the address is to receive food stamps for
this hippie "family" living in a commune style. She stated
she occasionally picks up their mail at her home and admitted
: on occasion taking the mail to them when she visits the
- "family". This interview was conducted at Moffett Field.

INSPECTOR Ai. LARSON: This case was opened on 4/30/70

and assigned to SA FREDERICK A.
GROS. The case was supervised on the desk of SA GLENN A. HARTER
and was closed on 7/27/70.

By letter dated 4/27/70, United Airlines Collection
Manager, RICHARD H. GEIMER, San Francisco, made available the
original of three fraudulent checks payable to United Airlines
on the account of KENDALL H. LUTES, Plandome, New York. Two
checks were tor $50 and one was for $25. UAL advised they
were forgeries.

GARY EUGENE LEGO was subsequently developed as the
Subject when arrested on 5/8/70 at Newark Airport, Newark,
New Jersey for false pretense and possession of stolen
property. When arrested he was attempting to purchase an

airline ticket with credit card of K. H. LUTES. An NCIC

check revealed he was wanted by Lancaster County Sheriff's
Office, Lincoln, Nebraska. He was released on 5/11/70 on
$500 bond but failed to appear for a hearing on ¥20/70.

LEGO was subsequently arrested on 6/19/70 in
Minneapolis by local police while in a stolen car. Local

‘ authorities held numerous warrants for LEGO and indicated

that they were going to prosecute him. The United States
Attorney's Office in Minneapolis declined prosecution on
6/22/70 and on 7/16/70, AUSA, San Francisco, also declined
prosecution in view of LEGO's incarceration on local charges
by Minneapolis authorities, and in view of the small amount
of checks passed in the San Francisco area. The case was

subsequently closed on 7/27/70.

- The original checks received from united Airlines
on 4/27/70 have not been returned to the contributor, it
being noted the 1-A envelope containing the 3 checks indicates
they were to be returned. It is further noted that the 3

checks in question were not submitted to the FBI Laboratory
for inclusion in the National Fraudulent Stolen Check File.

According to Part I, page 4 of the FBI Handbook
all documentary evidence shall be promptly returned to
the persons to whom it belongs upon conclusion of the case.

The file fails to reveal that the local San
Francisco police authorities were informed as to the check-
passing activities of GARY EUGENE LEGO in their jurisdiction
and that he had been identified as the alleged passer of
the 3 fraudulent checks cashed at UAL in San Francisco.

Why he failed to submit the 3 original checks in
this case to the FBI Laboratory for inclusion in the

deemed necessary.

Subject escaped from custody at San Quentin Prison

Commissioner, San Francisco, California. Bureau changed
Office of Origin to Los Angeles because Subject's relatives
and friends live in the Los Angeles area and all logical

Los Angeles by letter dated 4/24/70 requested the

numbers concerning long-distance telephone calls from home
telephone of Mrs. MARLYS CONNOLLY, Rialto, California. San
Francisco by letter dated 6/30/70 identified one telephone

_SA DOUGLAS R. AHLSTROM is requested to explain
why he failed to detect the lead at Walnut Creek had not
been covered before the case was closed on 10/15/70.

Field Supervisor BRYON C, WHEELER is requested
to explain why he failed to assign a lead to a Walnut Creek

the holder of the telephone number and why he failed to
insure that this investigation had been conducted before he
approved the closing of this case (San Francisco letter to
Los Angeles dated 10/15/70).

Comments of SAC requested.

SA DOUGLAS R. AHLSIRGh+—The writer was of the
impression that the lead at Walnut Creek to identify a
telephone subscriber had been covered and reported at
the time the case was RUC'd on 10/15/70. The writer did
not have the file available as the RUC communication was
submitted from the Santa Rosa Residence Agency and was
therefore unable to make a thorough review of the file.

in the San Francisco Bay Area. San Francisco's investi-
gation planned to establish the identity and national
character of this group, its aims and objectives, and to
identify the local persons invoived in this group.

In March, 1970, through.a check of U.S. Post

OEE CCL COLAS 1, San Francisco developed Sana pen
“ concerning the Post Office Box, eitilized, al

chapter... The. ‘box a. s rented | by Ibrahim ae
“Baygshe was subsequently developed by the san Francisco

Office as a Potential Security Informant.

A review of San Francisco File 105-25846 discloses
that Tawasha had been contacted on two occasions relative
to capttéméd organization, once in April, 1970, and again
in June, 1970, The brief and negative information he
furnished did not resolve any of the original planned
investigation by your office in this matter.

7 San Francisco memorandum dated 6/23/70 reporting
the results of contact with Tawasha on 6/19/70 showed that
a future discussion was contemplated with Tawasha relative
to captioned organization. San Francisco File 105-25846
indicates no other investigation has been conducted to date.
