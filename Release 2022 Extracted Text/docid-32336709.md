SIRZO

On 6/3/65 RAFAEL DE LOS REYES was contacted

at his request and furnished the following information

to SA JOSEPH I. SCULLY:

DE LOS REYES said that he first became associated

with the

Second, National Front of Escambray (Alpha 66) (SNFE)

while he was a student at Earlham College in Richmond,

Indiana. He described himself at that time as idealistic

and with complete faith in the SNFE. After coming to

Washington, D.C., he became aware that although he was the

representative of that organization he was

never fully taken into its confidence., He also attempted

to learn something of the organizations military plans

(Plan Omega) but all questions were answered in only general

and vague terms.

DE LOS REYES was unable to cited specific

reasons but he began to doubt that money collected and

equipment obtained was put to the use for which it was

intended.

additional disillusioned by the

capture of ELOY CUT TERREZ RENOYO, Leader of the SNrE, and

his subsequent public confessions on television in Cuba where

he implicated other members of the organization.

DE LOS REYES

also noted that shortly alter?:

..* MENOYO's apprehension

many Cubans in Cuba were arrested and DE LOS REYES feels that

there may have been a connection between MENOYO's apprehension

and these arrests.

The above,

coupled with the general

questionable background of MENOYO with regard to his early

association with FIDEL CASTRO raised serious doubts concerning

MENOVO himself. DE LOS REYES has developed a suspicion that

MENUYO may have been a CASTRO man or at least motivated by

personal gain rather then by concern

MENOYO's sister, MERCEDES GUTIERREZ MENOYO

lived with DE LOS REYES and his family for a month during

February and March, 1965, during which time she contacted

various Embassies in Washington, D.C. in an effort to

have those Embassies intervene with Cuba on the behalf

of her brother.

This lengthy contact with MERCEDES MENOYO

gave DE LOS REYES the definite impression that the

SNFE was poorly organized and not equipped to cope with

the emergency created by MENOYO's capture.

DE LOS REYES' suspicions concerning MENOYO

have also been heightened by the fact that during her

stay in Washington, D.C., MERCEDES MENOYO applied at the

Embassy of Czechoslovakia for renewal of her Cuban Passport

and was successful in receiving same.

The passport was sent to her at DE LOS REYES'

residence.

Additionally, DE LOS REYES noted that a

vast number of Cubans in Washington, D.C. are suspicious

of and distrust MENOYO and the SNIE.

He feels that

his association with this organization has adversely Affected

his association with other members of the Cuban community

and that to a degree they distrust him because of his

association with the SNFE.

DE LOS REYES has just embarked on a new venture

with one IVRE J. KAUSZ a Consulting Engineer; 1908

Sunderland Place, N.W. DE LOS REYES is hopeful that this

association will eventually develop into a full partnership

for him.

Indices WFO negative re derogatory information

concerning IRVE J. KAUSZ.

In view of his feelings outlined above and

because he feels that within a year he may want to become

a United States citizen DE LOS REYES recently submitted

his resignation as Washington, D.C. representative of SNFE.

His resignation was not accepted and the organization

attempted to convince DE LOS REYES to remain on as its

Washington, D.C. representative.

DE LOS REYES intends to

resubmit his resignation and will cease his association

with SNFE whether it is formally accepted or not.

In view of the above WFO is discontinuing

its investigation of DE LOS REYES as a PSI and will

continue to use him as a source of information.
