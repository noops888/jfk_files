On 6/3/65 RAFAEL DE LOS REYES was 18 contacted
at his request and furnished the following information
to SA JOSEPH E, SCULLY:

| DE LOS REYES said that he first became associated
with the Second, National Front of Escambray (Alpha 66) (SNFE)
while he was a student at Earlham.College in Richmond,

: Indiana. He described himself at that time as idealistic
and with complete faith in the SNFE.. After coming to
Washington, D.C., he became aware that although he was the
Washington,D.C, representative of that organization he was
never fully taken into its confidence. He also attempted
to learn something of the organizations military plans

(Plan Omega) but all questions were answered in only general
and vague terms. DE LOS REYES was unable to cite# specific
reasons but he began to doubt that money collected and
equipment obtained was put to the use for which it was
intended.

DE LOS REYES ssppattitiomy disillusioned by the
capture of ELOY GUTIERRE: (OYO, Leader of the SNFE, and
his subsequent public confessions on television in Cuba where
he implicated other members of the organization. DE LOS REYES
also noted that shortly .after”:.. MENOYO's apprehension
many Cubans in Cuba were arrested and DE LOS REYES feels that
there may have been a connection between MENOYO's apprehension
and these arrests. The above, coupled with the general
questionable background of MENOYO with regard to his early
association with FIDEL CASTRO raised serious doubts concerning
MENOYO himself. DE LOS REYES has developed a suspicion that
MENOYO may have been a CASTRO man or at least motivated by

MENOYO's sister, MERCEDES GUTIERREZ MENOYO
lived with DE LOS REYES and his family for a month during
February and March, 1965, during which time she contacted
various Embassies in Washington, D.C, in an effort to
have those Embassies intervene with Cuba on the behalf :
of her brother. ig

This lengthy contact with MERCEDES MENOYO . |
gave DE LOS REYES the definite impression that the
SNFE was poorly organized and not equipped to cope with
Hl the emergency created by MENOYO's capture.

i
|
\
|
DE LOS REYES': suspicions concerning MENOYO i"
have also been heightened by the fact that during her
stay in Washington,D.C., MERCEDES MENOYO applied at the H
Embassy of Czechoslovakia for yenewal of her Cuban Passport \
and was successful in receiving same. |
The passport was sent to her at DE LOS REYES'
residence.

Additionally, DE LOS REYES noted that a
vast number of Cubans in Washington,D.C, are suspicious
: of and distrust MENOYO and the SNIE. He feels that
: his association with this organization has adversely Affected i
his association with other members of the Cuban community
and that to a degree they distrust him because of his t
association with the SNFE. i
i

ij DE LOS REYES has just embarked on a new venture
with one IMRE J. KAUSZ a Consulting Engineer,. 1908
Sunderland Place, N.W. DE LOS REYES is hopeful that this
association will eventually develop into a full partnership
|! for him.

Indices WFO negative re derogatory information
concerning IRME J. KAUSZ.

| In view of his: feelings outlined above and
because he feels that within a year he may want to become

a United States citizen DE LOS REYES recently submitted
his resignation as Washington,D.C. representative of SNFE.

Washington,D.C. representative. DE LOS REYES intends to
resubmit his resignation and will cease his association
with SNFE whether it is formally accepted or not.

In view of the above WFO is discontinuing
its investigation of DE LOS REYES as a PSI and will
continue to use him as a source of information.
