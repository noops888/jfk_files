COMMENTS OF REVIEWING OFFICIAL

Although this employee is a fine intelligence officer end bas worked
very herd for the Chief of Station, Mexico City, I consider the reting

of Outstanding in ell specific duties end for over-all performance to be
excessively high. Reporting on the activities she supervises hes been

es good es thet from other Mexico City pperations but is still not up

to DpP stendards. While most ofthe Grojecte she is concerned vith are
handled with proper cost const 8, at least one of them, the LITEMPO
Project, is not. The agents WXpaid too mch and their activities are
not adequately reported. This hasteen called to the station's ettention.

Miss Goodpasture has been on sick leave since July 1972 awaiting

having entered on duty from OSS and its ane
career is highly distinguished by virtu
standing performance, all of which
In addition to several s Vee Sassignments, Miss Goodpasture
served in support of the su p against the ggmunist government
in Guatemala in 1954 and com ted tours of duty in! » Monterrey and
Mexico City. Undoubtedly, the high point of,her caréer o curred during
her service in Mexico City from 1957 ‘through @97, where she served as a
“trouble-shooting” case officer for the incomparable Winfield Scott
(deceased), who was then the Chief of Station. Mr. Scott, a stern task-
master, described Miss Goodpasture over these years as “intelligent, hard4
working, conscientious, versatile, valuable and unquestionably one of the
most competent Ci/CE officers he ever had the privilege of working with."
Miss Goodpasture's fitness reports were totally consistent with this
appraisal, and were characterized by outstanding ratings. In her final
assignment prior to acute medical problems, she worked for the CI Staff
(October 197 ctober 1971), earning the following remarks from her
supervisor: -I_ venture to rate her overall performance, thirty years
of it, as Outstanding. Ann is one of the tough warp-threads on which

organizations. Her

medical retirement in October 1973. She is a sehors member of the Agency,:

SECTION D (AN
contribution to ew

By virtue of WWifsual to duty which over a
period of several yea consistently long hours,
superior performance ¥ ible achievement in sensitive
matters of national seurity, Miss Goodpasture has excelled
as an operations officer. She was the case officer who was
responsible for the identification of Lee Harvey Oswald
in his dealings with the Cuban Embassy in Mexico. She was
also responsible for other important and successful opera-
tions against Soviet penetration efforts directed toward
the United States from Mexico. She would rather work than
rest, and when she works, she always impresses her super-
iors with her mastery over her craft. For thirty years
Miss Gocdpasture has given unstintingly of herself to
the cause and mission of this Agency; the Agency owes her
formal acknowledgement of appreciation.
