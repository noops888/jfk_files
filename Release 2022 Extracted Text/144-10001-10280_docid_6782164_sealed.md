This internal NSA report summarizes significant intelligence
developments, arranged by area of occurrence, and operational

herein was selected from SIGINT, collateral and press received
in the NSASCC between 260700Z- 2707002. November’ 1963.

INTELLIGENCE DEVELOPMENTS “+

CUBA

is The alert in Oriente province, apparently prompted by the
assassination of President KENNEDY, is believed to have
terminated on 25 November (2027.1). Access. to the coastal

observation post at Punta Maisi was restricted only unfil 25
November, and Eastern Naval District units, which were to receive
further instructions regarding the alert on 25 November, have
apparently not received any such orders. Further, the Cuban navy
held an island wide communication ekercise on 25 5 ae Such
an exercise is unlikely under alert conditions. (2/0, R58-63,
2602192)

B-l Comment: It is possible that the restriction regarding access
to the Punta Maisi observation post extended to other observation
posts in Oriente as well, and that the restriction was to be lifted
on 25 November by all of these posts.
