4, Operations,

a. On 25 February 1964 PARMUTH and FRANCOTTE were requested
by Lee R, MYLECHRAINE to cover a meeting between Oliver Q, WIMPHEN
and a top-ranking official of the PCM, MYLECHRAINE requested movies of
this meeting. A casing exercise was completed on the afternoon of 25 February
with the recommendations that the LIFIRE truck be used on this operation,

On the morning of 27 February 1964, PARMUTH and FRANCOTTE, with
RESCIGNO driving the LIFIRE truck, successfully photographed this meeting
on motion picture film using the Turret Camera Concealment device.
Forwarded as enclosure B is a copy of the film covering this meeting.

b, During the period 26 February - 1 March 1964, PARMUTH and
FRANCOTTE were requested by Gerald F, GESTETNER to prepare for a
photographic operation which would take place dn 1 March 1964 The purpose
of this operation was to photograph a meeting between a Soviet official and a
U.S. Army enlisted man who came from the States to Mexico to meet with
this official clandestinely. Work on this operation began on 26 February 1964
by choosing different photographic locations using the LIFIRE truck, On
27 February 1964, immediately following the PCM operation, test exposures
were made from the LIFIRE truck at the proposed meeting site using both
the K-100 for motion pictures and the Exacta camera with 240mm lens for
stills. Upon reviewing the tests, the Station chose stills for this operation,
On the night of 28 February 1964, FRANCOTTE and Lola M, CAPAZZI
registered in alias at a hotel which overlooked the general meeting site.
FRANCOTTE was requested to photograph all persons who would be near the
target area before and after the meetings took place in order to check for
counter- surveillance. On the morning of 29 February 1964, FRANCOTTE
made tests with the Exact camera and 30x eyepiece. Using Tri-X film,
FRANCOTTE photographed examplars of what type of coverage could be expected
in bright morning sun from this location, This test rool of Tri-X film was
developed with excellent results in Acufine, full strength at 75 degrees, for a
period of 20 minutes, The Station was satisfied with this part of the coverage.
On the morning of 1 March 1964, RESCIGNO parked the LIFIRE truck directly
across'the street from the meeting site (which was at a local movie theatre),
leaving PARMUTH to cover this part of photographing the meeting between the
Soviet and the target. RESCIGNO immediately went to FRANCOTTE's room
in the hotel to maintain audio communications between the LIEMBRACE
surveillance team (which would be following the target when he left his hotel
for the meeting) and the LIFIRE truck which would be warned when the target
approached the theatre area for his meeting with the Soviet. FRANCOTTE's
coverage showed the Soviet entering the park area approximately 25 minutes
before the actual meeting time. At 0916 the Soviet walked to the theatre
entrance where the target was standing, The Soviet waited approximately 6
minutes before approaching target. Forwarded as enclosure C, are photographs
taken of this operation, which were requested by the U.S, Army through
GESTETNER, .

5, Station Support.

a, On 15 and 16 February 1964, ZAMBELLE and PARMUTH were
requested by Lee R, MYLECHRAINE to be on standby to remove important
Gorimunist documents which were sewn into the lining of a raincoat. Con-
siderable preparations were made on the part of ZAMBELLE for this operation,
who'spent the whole of 15 February practicing on different stitching both by hand
and machine. On the night of 16 February 1964, PARMUTH and ZAMBELLE
were notified by MYLECHRAINE that the raincoat with the

inside the coat plus 19 envelopes were in the case officer's possession for a
period of 7 hours. ZAMBELLE successfully removed the documents which
consisted of three type-written documents on white thin cloth. The documents
were then photographed and resewn into the raincoat. PARMUTH opened,
photographed and resealed 16 of the 19 envelopes with the help of ZAMBELLE
and Julie G, PERSFULL, This operation was completed in five hours,
PARMUTH requested that MYLECHRAINE tell his agent that the 19 envelopes
should be carried by the agent preferably in his rear hip pocket during his

trip by bus from Mexico City to Merida (a hot long trip by bus) to distort any
chance that the recipients would detect that the letters had been opened. On

27 February 1964, MYLECHRAINE reported that his agent returned from
Merida and followed the Station's instructions about placing the letters in his
hip pocket, The letters arrived in Merida as expected, in a pressed damp
condition, The three of the 19 envelopes which the Station did not open had

been originally sealed with a liquid-gum-type glue which gets tacky when sealed,
When PARMUTH attempted to open these three envelopes which were made of
cheap rough fiber paper by direct steaming, it Witla found that the fiber would
give way before any noticeable softening of the glue and the decision was made
to leave the envelopes untouched, On 17 February 1964, seven Sets of prints,
cortsisting of 63 each set, were given totMYLECHRAINE for hi dissemination.
No repercussions were reported to the Station concerning this Fand $ operation,

b.7Op the afternoon of 24 Febriary 1964, FRANCOTTE and PARMUTH
visited the(MKICHARITY basehouse where PARMUTH introduced FRANCOTTE
to RESCIGNO, KURIOT Station support was discussed at length during this
meeting.

c. On the night of 25 February 1964, PARMUTH introduced FRANCOTTE
toIdentity A who controls the passport camera activity at th airport] IA meeting
was arranged by Identity A to haye PARMUTH and FRANCOTTE inspect the
passport camera at thefaizpordfo 4 March 1964, The three new cassettes which
.were sent to the Station for this passport camera operation have been tested
and are working Well. Several improvements were made by Identity A to the
safe area where the passport camera is used. They are as follows:

(1) The new room now has a steel grating as a ceiling preventing
anyone from climbing over and into this room;

{2) Another door divides the location of the room into two parts.
This door as well as the other two doors is always locked, Thus the entire
area is secured,

(3) Identity A and one camera operator have the key to this new
inner room for their private use only. See enclosure D,. for the drawing of
this room.

d. On 24 February 1964, PARMUTH introduced FRANCOTTE to
LIFEUD/22 and 23 who are located at the LIERODE basehouse, An inspection
tour of the installation was given by LIFEUD/22, explaining in detail his respon-
sibilities at this installation in support of PBRUMEN operations, FRANCOTTE
will handle this photographic operation when PARMUTH departs Mexico.
