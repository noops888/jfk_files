1. wAfter meeting with Mr. Warner, Mr. ind others
from the (LPGLOBE staff, I telephoned Mr. Leonar ewman, Chief
of the Rackets Section, New York County District Attorney's office,
on Thursday, 6 February, and stated that I wanted to discuss a
matter not directly related to the Itkin case. I felt it was
necessary to explain to Mr. Newman that it was not the Itkin
case since we have been enjoined by the U.S, Attorney's office
from discussing the Itkin case with members of Mr. Hogan's office,
Mr. Newman's immediate question was, "Does this involve(R obert "2
I said it did and would look forward to meeting with him at 10:30 °3
on Friday provided the weather permitted an on-time arrival in
New York.

2. At 10:30 on Friday, 7 February, I met with Mr. Newman
and Sergeant William Graf, a police investigator assigned to the
District Attorney's office to work on the Itkin case. It appears
that Sergeant Graf, in the course of his iny estigation of Itkin's
activities, came up with the information hot @oberts) was working
for CIA, When Sergeant Graf first talked to Mr. Newman about
this possibility, Mr. Newman thought he was jumping to conclusions
with insufficient evidence. However, Sergeant Grays continued his
investigation and more and more evidence pointed % @oberts)) CIA
relationship. I specifically asked Sergeant Graf if Itkin was aware
of (Roberts) affiliation with CIA, and Sergeant Graf replied that
from th@3evidence he had seen of the Itkin- oberts)#elationship
it was his opinion that Itkin does know St Qoberts) affiliation with
CIA, Mr. Newman commented that if Itkin knew of Roberts"03
affiliation with CIA, we could be sure that this would be brought
out by Mr. F. Lee Bailey during the trial of Itkin.

3. At the present time thé”New York District Attorney is
not contemplating prosecution of (Robert as the information
uncovered to date relates & (Roberts) contacts with Itkin and
apparently there are no specific criminal charges against
Roberts) Sergeant Graf stated that Roberts) had corresponded
with Itkin, and it was assumed that Itkif and Qobert3) have met
personally when(Robertd has been in this country, °3 Ali

03 4. Mr. Newman stated that they had sent questions to ®akar)
ae Interpol which have been answered. Mr, Newman
stated that the FBI had advised him that the FBI had previously
had an interest in Qoberts\oz Mr. Newman did not state whether
the FBI had advised him of CIA's interest in (Roberta Mr. Newman
asked me whether we would be willing to question Gobertg on other
items that they had uncovered, I stated that this posed a deal
problem and I was not able to give them an answer at that time.
I was concerned about certain conflicts in the event Qoberts)o%
answers involved information which could incriminate him. It
might be that@obert would consider he had immunity from
prosecution when answéring questions put forth by CIA,

oO
5. 1 did not describe (Robected relationship to CIA other than
to state he had in fact received some training from us and did
report to us. I intended to infer that (Robertd was an informant
in 4 similar capacity to that which ItkixVenjoyed earlier.

6 It should be noted that all parties to the Itkin case are
talking to each other. Mr. Newman said two days before I called
on the phone the FBI advised him that CLA would discuss our
relationship with(Robérts) with him, Later that day in Mr.
Morgenthau's office, where I met Itkin, FBI Agent Donovan
commented that he heard I had a good meeting with Newman,

It is not beyond belief that the FBI told Itkin that I had seen
Newman about Roberts.)
