Dear Mr. Brand:

Pursuant to our conversation of 11 May, enclosed please
find a copy of our response to an FOIA appeal requesting
correspondence or records of communications between NSA and
the House Select Committee on Assassinations. The documents
were released as the result of an initial request and prior
to our knowledge of congressional intent that this information
be maintained in confidentiality.

Future requests of this nature will be handled in accordance
with expressed congressional intent; we would appreciate receiving,
however, a letter addressed to this Agency specifying current
congressional views with respect to the information maintained
by NSA.

If you have any questions do not hesitate to call me or
Robin Ullman on 688-6054.

Sincerely,

Stanley Brand, General Counsel, Clerk of the House

of Representatives

M/R: This response was coordinated with Q4 (Dinwoodie) on

classification and with Stan Brand, General Counsel to the

Clerk of the House of Representatives in determining whether
correspondence originating with the House Select Committee

on Assassinations are NSA records. Mr. Brand informed us of
correspondence from Louis Stokes to Executive Agencies that

congressional material and related information in a form connected

to the Committee should not be disclosed without the written

concurrence of the House of Representatives. A subsequent letter

from the Clerk of the House affirmed this decision. He told us “
that he believes the Committee inadvertently neglected to send the
Stokes letter to NSA. Copies of both letters are attached for
your information, and, for LAO, your file.

As Q4 had already released the NSA-originated records (not
knowing about the Stokes request), we decided to uphold their
findings. Future requests of this nature should be handled in
accordance with the Stokes and Henshaw letters. If any documents
covered by these letters are to be released they must first be
coordinated with and approved by Stan Brand, General Counsel
to the Clerk of the House of Representatives. His phone
number is 225-7000.

Mark Allen has sued CIA under the FOIA for withholding
information responsive to a similar request. The D.C. Circuit
in November 1980 remanded that case to the District Court, |
but made some rulings on the (b)(1) and (b)(3) exemptions
which we have tried to comply with in this letter - inter
alia, showing procedural conformity with E.O. 12065,
demonstrating which exemptions the deleted information fall
under and why, and releasing classification markings.

Honorable William H. Webster
Federal Bureau of Investigation
J. Edgar Hoover Building
Washington, D.C. 20535

Dear Mr. Webster:

oncerning a subject of considerable
lative branch officer charged with
ouse documents and ay

I am writing to you c
concern to me as the legis
maintaining and pieserving non-current H
records under the rules and precedents of the House of
Representatives. Specifically, I call your attention to
requests filed with the Bureau under the Freedom of Informa-
tion Act for correspondence, records or any communications
between the Bureau and the former House Select Committee on

Assassinations ("HSCA").

By letter dated March 26, 1979 to the Honorable Griffin
Bell, former Chairman Stokes specifically identified the
problem which would result from requests under the Freedom
He _of Information Act for material generated by the Bureau in
ecific requests by HSCA during its investiga-

response to spi
tion. That letter requested that "this congressional material

and related information in a form connected to the Committee
not be disclosed outside your Department."

My purpose in writing is to reaffirm the congressional
intent expressed by Chairman Stokes at the conclusion of
HSCA's work in my capacity as archival and custodial agent
for the House of HSCA's records. In this connection, my
General Counsel has generally. reviewed the congressional
materials and has determined that none of the congressional
materials can be released consistent with the letter from
Chairman Stokes asserting the exemption for Congress under .
5 U.S.C. §551(1) (A) (1976). This is our position notwith-
standing the recent decision of a panel of the United States


able Williem Mebster

- _ te i,
Doc Rit Deets e e

Court of Appeals in Holy Spirit Association For The Unifica-
tion of World Christianity v. Central Intelligence Agency,

Nos. 7922143, 2202 (D.C. Cir. Dec. 23, 1980), petition for
ly believe that

rehearing filed, (Jan. 21, 1981). We strong

Chairman Stoke's letter, together with our reaffirmation by
this letter, comes squarely within the standards articulated
in the Holy Spirit case, because they predate both the
request and any itigation which might arise therefrom, two
factors cited by the panel in Holy Spixit as absent.

As constitutional officer of the House charged with
preservation of House records, I cannot overemphasize the
importance of maintaining the strictest confidentiality over
records generated by the Bureau, as well as copies of
congressional materials retained by the Bureau, in connection
with HSCA. While I believe that these letters adequately
serve to support the withholding of any of these documents
under FOIA, I would appreciate being informed of any such
requests. In this regard, please have appropriate personnel
in the processing sections contact my General Counsel concern-
ing requests for HSCA materials.

Mr. Mark Allen
P.O. Box 9032
Washington, D.C. 20003

Dear Mr. Allen:

This replies to your letter of 8 April 1981 in which you
appeal the National Security Agency's (NSA) denial of information
responsive to your Freedom of Information Act request. I have
reviewed your initial request of 12 January 1981, the nine records
located in response to that request, NSA's letter of 16 March
1981 which forwarded one record in its entirety and portions of
eight other records, and your letter of appeal. As the result
of this review, I am again sending you the releasable portions
of eight documents and I am’referencing herein the laws that
preclude disclosure of certain segments of these documents. I
have also decided to release additional portions of three records
that were released to you by the Chief, Office of Policy, and
amended copies of those records are attached. However, I affirm
the determination of the Chief, Office of Policy, that the
remaining portions of the attached records must be withheld,

The ninth document, an unclassified letter from Eugene Yeates
to Robert Blakey dated 14 July 1978 was released to you in its
entirety and therefore does not need to be addressed.

Set forth below are descriptions of the eight records which
were withheld in part and the reasons for withholding those
portions of them. The reasons for withholding are as responsive
as possible without disclosing classified information. The U.S.
Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia has recognized that
information disclosed by an agency about withheld documents does
not have to contain facts that if made public would compromise
the secret nature of the information. Vaughn v. Rosen, 157 U.S.
App. D.C. 340, 484 F.2d 820, 826 (1973), cert. denied, 415 U.S.

§798; 5 U.S.C. §552(b) (6)

A more detailed explanation of the rationale for each exemption follows:

With respect to the classifications assigned to the portions
of documents 2 through 8 being withheld, I have concluded that
they meet the criteria for classification in Section 1-3 of Executive
Order 12065 and in paragraph 2-202 of DoD Regulation 5200.1-R and
that the withheld portions are properly classified in their entirety
within the categories provided in Section 1-1 of Executive Order
12065 and in Chapter I, Section 5 of DoD Regulation 5200.1-R. The
records have been reviewed for possible declassification or down-
grading according to the provisions of Sections 3-1 and 3-3 of
Executive Order 12065 and of Chapter III of DoD Regulation 5200.1-R.
Portions that were declassified are enclosed; the remaining portions
were found to be properly classified and therefore excluded from
declassification or downgrading despite the length of time which
has elapsed since their origin. In conducting this review, I
have weighed the significant need for openness in government against
the likelihood of damage to our national security at this time.
I have specifically taken into account Section 3-303 of Executive
Order 12065 and have determined that the records, except for the
portions released, should continue to be classified. Thus, I find

2



"Doc Ref ID: A4269476 e : e

that the Chief, Office of Policy, properly found these portions
to be exempt from release pursuant to 5 U.S.C. §552(b)(1), and I
affirm his denial of your request for release of these portions
on those grounds.

Portions of each of the eight documents are exempt from
disclosure pursuant to 5 U.S.C. §552(b)(3). Section 6 of Public
Law 86-36 provides that no law shall be construed to require
the disclosure of the organization, personnel, functions or
activities of the.National Security Agency. Each of the
records contains information falling into this description.

The National Security Agency is precluded by 18 U.S.C. §798

from providing information concerning classified communications
intelligence activities except to those persons authorized to
receive such information. 50 U.S.C. §403(d)(3) protects infor-
mation pertaining to intelligence sources and methods. Withheld
portions of documents 3 through 8 contain information protected
by these statutes. Enclosure 6 of DoD Directive 5400.7 (32
C.F.R. §286 (1980)) specifically recognizes 18 U.S.C. §798 and
Public Law 86-36 as exemption 3 statutes. Thus, I also find that
the Chief, Office of Policy, properly concluded that portions of
the documents were exempt from release pursuant to 5 U.S.C.

§552 (b)(3), since each of the statutes and the directive cited
above provides adequate grounds upon which to base such an
exemption.

In addition, portions of documents 4, 5, 6 and 8 relating
to one individual are exempt pursuant to 5 U.S.C. §552(b) (6)
due to certain unique circumstances involved. I have determined
that disclosure would constitute a "clearly unwarranted invasion
of personal privacy," for this individual.

With the exception of the one document released in its
entirety and the portions of the other documents that were
released, I found the matter covered by your request clearly
within the statutory protection and exemptions cited above,
and proper protection of classified information and intelligence
sources and methods requires a denial of the remaining portions
of the documents.

Finally four documents originated by Congress, one of
which was a Memorandum of Understanding between the House
Select Committee on Assassinations and the Office of the
Secretary of Defense and attached to document 5, were found
not to be agency records and are therefore not subject to the
Freedom of Information Act. Possession of a document does not
dictate that it is an "agency record" but rather whether control
of the document has passed from Congress and become property of
the agency within which it resides. See Goland v. CIA, 607 F.2d
339 (D.C. Cir. 1978), cert. denied, 445 U.S. 927 (1980). As you
already know, when the House Select Committee on Assassinations
disbanded, Chairman Stokes informed former Attorney General
Griffin Bell that the Congressional materials and related
information connected to the Committee should be held in
confidentiality. That assertion of Congressional privilege
has been recently reaffirmed by the Congress.

As your appeal is denied in part, you are hereby advised
of your rights under 5 U.S.C. §552 to seek judicial review. You
may seek an order from a United States Court in the district in
which you reside, in which you have your principal place of
business, or in which this Agency's records are situated (U.S.
District Court, District of Maryland), or in the District of
Columbia, for the production of any Agency records which you
consider to have been improperly withheld by this Agency.

5 U.S.C. §552(a)(4)(B) sets out your rights in this matter
with respect to such judicial action.

calle Sand ask him for the identity (Stevenson indicated
his extreme unwillingness to do this. LTC Graham stated that this
request would have to’be examined at policy level within DoD).

10. If the Committee is able to determine a specific name,
the staffers indicated that they would probably initiate a specific

inquiry to NSA to again search our materials. a

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD . 28 November 1978

SUBJECT: Visit to House Select Committee on Assassinations’

1.’ On 21 November I visited House Select Committee on Assassinations
spaces to review for classification purposes the report Messrs Cornwell
and Klein wrote following the 17November interview with Sgt Nicholas B.

_ Stevenson, USAF.

2. The report, about one and a half pages long, listed the participants
in the interview and described generally the substance of the discussions,
Although it did not mention the specific site to which Sgt Stevenson and

nwernsnn—ewere_agsigned, it did say that the facility was able to

REET ees the xeport further mentionedgt

nee ° en
and "NSA" in several places.

3. I told Mr. Cornwell that as written, portions of the report should
be classified "CONFIDENTIAL, HANDLE VIA COMINT CHANNELS ONLY." He agreed
“to classify it and asked me to mark it which I did. I suggested that with
a few changes we could make it unclassified. Mr. Cornwell stated that he
would prefer to retain the original language of the report at this time
put that if it was to be used in any unclassified report by the Committee,
he would then ask us to review the wording so that classified information
would not be disclosed. :

4. Mr. Cornwell asked if NSA had determined whether the conversation
z ~~~ eferenced had been published and disseminated in product
channels. I told him that we had not yet determined the answer to that
question and that we would be back in touch. :
