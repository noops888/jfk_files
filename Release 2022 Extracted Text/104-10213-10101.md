Both Rovan and MisS McGulze vere then entertalning in Las Vegas, and

Glancros asked Mabeu to fut a bug in Roan's room. Haheu did not vant

that be never beard of it.

According to Sidney Gottlied, this schene progressed to the

polat of actually buring a diving suit and readyinz It for delivery.

The technique Isrolved dusting the inside of the sult with a fungus

that vould produce a disabling and chroate sion disease (Madura 100t)

and contaminating the breathing apparatus, visa tubercle bacilli.

Gottlieb does not remember that came of the scheme or what happened

to the scube sult. San Falpers, who was 11 on the schere, at first

said the plas was dropped because 1t vas obviously Impracticable.

He later recalled toat the plan was ebandoned because lt was overtaken
