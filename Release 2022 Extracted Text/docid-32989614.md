individuals of the surveillances are not plaintiffs;

however, the Government has not specifically acknowledged

these individuals to have been the subjects of electronic

not made a final determination as to whether the electronic

surveillance material requested by the SSC concerning the

two plaintiffs (specifically Morton H. Falperin and

•William Anthony Lake) would be furnished to the Committee.

The authorizations on all of the wiretaps, however, are

being furnished to the Department of Justice, which will

make the legal determination as to whether the information

will be turned over to the SSC. The memorandum has 152e

The phrases "with British Intelligence," and

"that British Intelligence"were excised on lines i0 and I1(s)

hearings.

The Committee requested data regarding the legal

authority for "all forms of electronic surveillance and

consensual electronic surveillance" in' Appendix A, item 5a.

The enclosed material covers warrantless electronic surveillances

and consensual electronic surveillances.

It does not appear

necessary to point out the legal basis for warranted electronic

surveillances in Title III of Public Law 70-351.

Appendix B, items 4a and b requested data indicating

the original decision

to utilize these techniques and data

indicating the policies and procedures of the FBI for the

utilization of these techniques.

The policies and procedures

of the FBI for utilization of these techniques are those

required by the Attorney General which are set out in the

enclosed material. The fact that the FBI utilizes electronic

surveillances, with and without consent, is public knowledge

and it does not appear necessary to point this out.

ALI, FEI INFORMATION CONTAINED

DA 29574 enlig

Dear Senator Kennedy:

In response to your letter of April 24, 1975, I am

presently able to provide you with most of the information

you have requested

concerning the electronic surveillance

activities of federal departments and agencies.

The in-

formation

contained in this letter and the enclosed material

relates mainly to electronic surveillance conducted within

the United States pursuant to the criminal law enforcement

responsibilities of the federai government. It does not

include electionic surveillance that may be conducted either

in the interests of national security, or outside the United

States by federal departments and agencies other than the

Department of Justice.

As to these latter areas, the De-

partment is still in the process of assembling and review-

ing the materials relevant to your request, and we are thus

unable at this time to determine what information we may be

able to provide. I should note that in several instances

your letter requests information that is either not in the

possession of this Department or pertains to areas outside

its proper jurisdiction. Since I understand that you have

sent similar letters to other federal departments and agen-

cies, I expect that you will receive responses from them.

Nevertheless, I believe the information contained in this

letter and the enclosed material will answer in substantial

part the questions you have raised concerning electronic

surveillance..

Apart from the area of national security, electronic

surveillance conducted within the United States by federal

departments and agencies

may be divided into two broad

categories: consensual and non-consensual.

Consensual

electronic surveillance refers to those instances in which

one, ox more parties to the communication is a federal agent,

is cooperating with a federal agent, or has consentea to

the surveillance. Th. Supreme Court has repeatedly held

that the warrant requirement of the Fourth Amendment does

not apply to consensual surveillance.

see, e.g., United

States v. White, 401 U.S. 745 (1971) ; Lopez V.

White, 373

U.S. 427 (1963) ; Rathbun v. United States, 355 U.S. 107

(1957) ; On Lee v. United States, 343 U.S..

747 (1952).

Con-

gress

has also excepted consensual electronic surveillance

from the provisions of Title III of the Omnibus Crime Con-

trol and Safe Streets Act of 1968, including the requirement

of a court order.

Thus, "sections

2511(a) (c) and (2) of Title

28 of the United

States Code provide:

(c) It shall not be unlawful under this

chapter for a person acting under color of law

to intercept a wire or oral communication, where

such person is a party. to the communication or

one of the parties to the communication has given

prior consent to such interception.

(a)

It shall not be unlawful under this

chapter for a person not acting under color of

law to intercept a wire or oral communication

where such person is a party to the communication

or where one of the parties to the communication

has given prior consent to such interception un~

less such communication is intercepted for the

purpose of committing any criminal or tortious

act in violation of the Constitution or laws of

the United States or of any State or for the pur-

pose of committing any other injurious act.

Although consensual electronic surveillance may thus

be conducted without a court order, its use by federal agents

has been subject to regulations issued by the Attorney

General

since 1967.

The current regulations are specified in Attorney

General Kleindienst's memorandum of October 16, 1972 entitled

"Memorandum to the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies,

May 12, .1975

Re: Monitoring Private Conversations with the Consent of

a Party," and in a subsequent amending order issued by

Attorney General Saxbe. Copies of the memorandum and order

are enclosed herein.

In general, all federal agencies and departments

are required to obtain advance authorization frim either

the Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Criminal

Division, or Deputy Assistant Attorney General of that

Division before any electronic device may be used to over-

hear, transmit, or record a private conversation, other than

a telephone conversation, without the consent of

all the

parties to that conversation.

In exigent circumstances

precluding a prior request for authorization - such as

imminent loss ot essential evidence or a threat to the

immediate safety of an agent or informant - emergency

monitoring may be instituted with the authorization of the

head of

the responsible department or agency or his designee:

The Assistant Attorney Ceneral of the Criminal Division, how-

ever, must be notified promptly of any such monitoring

and

of the specific conditions that precluded obtaining prior

approval.

The above procedures do not apply to consensual moni-

toring of telephone conversations.

Because they involve the

transmission of a participant's voice through a complex and

far-reaching network of wires, the common use of party lines

and extension telephones, and

the possibility of an unseen

participant permitting another person to listen on the same

extension, telephone conversations have long been thought

not to enjoy the same expectation of privacy as face-to-face.

conversations.

For this reason, supervision and control over

consensual monitoring of telephone conversations are vested

instead in the head of each federal department and agency,

who is required

? to adopt appropriate regulations and pro-

cedures on the subject.

These regulations usually do

restrict consensual monitoring of telephone conversations

any significant respect. The relevant regulations of the

Drug Enforcement Administration are enclosed herein.

NW 65360 Docld:32989614 Page 43

Hon. Edward M. Kennedy

May 12, 1975

The current regulations issued by the Attorney

General also require the head of each federal department

and, agency to exercise responsibility for the security of

all consensual monitoring devices, including the maintenance

of current inventories as to amounts, storage, and users of

such equipment, and to submit to the Attorney General dur-

ing July of each year a report containing an inventory of

all electronic and mechanical equipment designed for the

monitoring of conversations and a brief statement of the

results obtained from their use during the prior fiscal year.

All federal departments and agencies having criminal

investigative responsibilities are authorized to conduct con-

sensual

electronic surveillance.

These agencies include,

inter-alia, the Bureau of Alcohol; Tobacco and Firearms, the

Bureau of Customs, the Department

of Agriculture, the Internal

Revenue Service, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the

Drug Enforcement Administration, the Postal Service,

the

Secret Service, the Department of Defense, the Naval Investi-

gative Service, the Immigration and Naturalization Service,

and the Department of Interior.

The number of consensual

uses of

electronic surveillance devices authorized by the

Department of Justice between 1970 and 1974 is set forth in

the attached memoranda.

The total annual authorizations

were

as follows: 1970, 512; 1971, 840; 1972, 1272; 1973, 1484;

1974, 2518.

In the first quarter of 1975, the total number

of authorizations was 1,125. In March 1975, the total author-

ized was 461.

The above figures, of course, do not include

consensual monitoring of telephone conversations. Nor do

they include consensual electronic surveillance that may be

conducted either outside the United States or in the inter-

ests of national security.

Apart from the area of national security and foreign

intelligence, non-consensual electronic

the United States is conducted pursuant surveillance within

to a court order.

Act of 1968, the Attorney General may authorize an applica-

eau of Customs, the Drug Enforcerent Administration, the

Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, and the Postal Service.

The administrative procedures and guidelines govern-

ing electronic surveillance under Title III are contained in

the Manual for Conduct of Electronic Surveillance, a copy of

which is enclosed.

The procedures specified in the Manual

apply to every federal department or agency authorized to

conduct electronic surveillance under Title III. All sur-

veillance authorized under Title III is conducted within the

United States or Puerto Rico; Title III has no application

in foreign countries. See 18 U.S.C. 2516(1) .

• : The extent of electronic surveillance conducted by

the federal government pursuant to Title III between 1971

and 1974 is contained in the reports issued by the Adminis-

trative Office of The United States Courts, as required by

28 U.S.C. 2519(3). Copies of those reports are enclosed

with this letter.

The number of electronic surveillances

authorized under Title III so fax in 1975 is 28. The Federal

Bureau of Investigation requested 27 of those surveillances,

including 3 extensions. The Drug Enforcement Administration

requested the remaining 1.

With respect to electronic surveillance conducted

outside the United States, I can provide you with informa-

tion relating only to the policy and practice of the Depart-

ment of Justice. With the exception of the Drug Enforce-

ment Administration, no division, bureau, or agency of

this Department conducts electronic surveillance outside

the United States for any purpose, including national

security.

The Drug Enforcement Administration does con-

duct electronic surveillance outside the United States in

cextain limited circumstances.

This surveillance is pres-

ently undertaken only on a bilateral basis, that is, with

the approval and participation of the foreign country in-

volved.

It is my understanding, however, that a predecessor

organization of DEA did conduct non-consensual electronic

surveillance unilaterally in at

least one instance occurring

in 1973.

The surveillance was initiated in connection with

•that organization's criminal law enforcement responsibilities

and was designed to obtain information concerning inter-

national drug traffickers.

The subject of the surveillance

was a foreign national, and not an American citizen or an

alien resident of the United States.

Under its current policy, DEA does not conduct

any

non-consensual electronic surveillance abroad without the

approval and participation of the

foreign country.

In al-

than by dEA, and is not initiated as the result of a reguest

Dy DEA. I am informed that the instances in which DEA has

been responsible in any way for electronic surveillance

conducted abroad are exceedingly few, and that in none of

these was the subject of the surveillance an American citizen

or an alien resident of the United States.

Under existing regulations, the approval of the u.s.

Chief of Mission in the host country is required before DEA

may conduct, or request a foreign country to conduct, non-

consensual. electronic

surveillance outside the United States.

In addition, I have ordered that henceforth DEA shall obtain

the prior approval of the Attorney General before conducting,

or reguesting anyone else to conduct, non-consensual elec-

tronic surveillance outside the United States where the sub-

ject of the surveillancé is an American citizen or alien resi-

dent of the United States.

Although the approval of the

Attorney General has not been required previously, as indi-

cated above there have apparently been no instances in

which an American citizen or resident has been the subject

of non-consensual electronic surveillance conducted abroad

bY DEA Or initiated at its request.

On occasion DEA has also conducted consensual elec-

tronic surveillance outside the United States, usually in- -

volving the use of a voice transmitter concealed on, an

informant, a DEA agent, or a law enforcement officer of the

host country. Under DEA's current policy, this transmitter

device is used with the specific approval

and participation

of the foreign country. Again, in almost all cases, the

suiveillance is actuûlly conducted by a law enforcement

official of the foreign country, rather than by dea, and

DEA's involvement is in general

limited to supplying the

equipment necessary to conduct the

surveillance.

So far

as

DEA can determine, no American citizen or alien resident of

the United States

has been the subject of consensual elec-

tronic surveillance conducted abroad through use of this

device by DEA, or by a foreign country at DEA's request.

I have ordered that whenever practicable DEA shall

obtain the advance approval of the Assistant Attorney General

in charge ot the criminal DivisIon, or Deputy Assistant At-

torney General of that Division, before conducting, or re-

questing anyone else to conduct, consensual electronic sur-

veillance outside the United States where the subject of the

surveillance is

an American citizen or alien resident of the

United States.

Where circumstances preclude a prior request

FOL

authorization, DEA may conduct the surveillance, but

shall notify promptly the Assistant Attorney General in charge

of the Criminal Division of the surveillance and the specific

conditions that precluded obtaining prior approval. this

orocedure parallels that outlined in Attorney General Klein-

dienst's memorandum of October 16, 1972 governing consensual

electronic surveillance within the United States by federal

departments and agencies. It. applies, of course, only to

private conversations, other than telephone conversations,

that are sought to be monitored without the consent of

all the parties to that conversation. For the reasons

mentioned earlier, prior approval for consensual monitor-

ing of telephone conversations is not reguired.

DEA has also used certain electzonic devices abroad

in order to track the location of drug shipments. These

devices do not transmit, overhear, or record private con-

versations, but rather merely emit signals which indicate

the location of the device.

Dan's policy concerning electronic surveillance

nas also been descilleù dil dis dEsponse to your letter Ji

April 24 to Mr. Bartels.

The remaining divisions, bureaus,

and agencies within the Department do not conduct electronic

surveillance of any kind outside the nited States.

assist your subcommittee in its inquiry concerning the prac-

tices and procedures of the federal agencies in the area of

electronic surveillance.

ALL KEI INFORMATION CONTAITEL

BARE MEDIARRIA

Dear Senator Kennedy:

In my letter to you of May 12, I stated that the De-

partment was in the process of assembling the materials rele-

vant to your inquiry regarding electronic surveillance con-

ducted within the

United States in the

interests of national

security and foreign intelligence. Pursuant to a review of

this matter, I am able to provide you with the following in-

formation.

Since 1940 by directives of the President, the Attorney

General has been vested with responsibility over electronic

surveillance conducted within the United States in the inter-

ests of national security and foreign intelligence. This sur-

veillance is authorized pursuant to the personal approval of

the Attorney General, rather than by court order. Based

on

an examination of the relevant precedents, it is the position

of the Department of Justice that the Executive nay conduct

electronic surveillance in the interests of national security

and foreign intelligence, and in aid of his conduct of the

nation's foreign affairs, without obtaining a judicial warrant.

This has been the position of the Department of Justice for more

..

than three decades and is supported by historical practice as

well

as judicial decision.

The only two Courts of Appeals to

address the issue, the Third Circuit and 'the Fifth Circuit, have

held that the warrant requirement of the Fourth Amendment does

not apply in the area of national security and foreign intelli-

gence.and that under. the Constitution the President has the -

authority to conduct electronic surveillance without a court

order as part of his diplomatic and military or commander-in-

chief functions.

See United States v. Butenko (Appeal of Ivanov,

494 F. 2d 593 (3rd Cir. 1974) (en banc), cert. denied sub nom.

U.S.

• 960 (1974) .

In Title III of the Omnibus Crime Control

and Safe Streets Act of 1968, Congress also explicitly dis-

claimed any attempt to place limitations on the President's

authority in this area.

18 U.S.C. § 2511(3). The Supreme

Court has, of course, expressly left open the question whether

the warrant requirement applies

to electronic surveillance con-

ducted for national security and foreign intelligence pur-

poses.

In United States v. United States District Court,

407

U.S. 297, 308-9 (1973), however, the Court, while holding that

the domestic security area was

subject to the warrant require-

ment, was careful to note that "the instant case requires no

judgment with respect to the activities of foreign powers, with-

in or without this country.

There is no evidence of

involvement, directly or indirectly, of a foreign pover."

any

More-

over, in the Butenko case, although

the United States prevailed

in the Third Circuit, the Department acquiesced in the petition

for certiorari. Nevertheless,

the Court denied certiorari,

thus leaving undisturbed the Third Circuit's decision upholding

the authority of the Executive to conduct electronic surveil-

lance without-a court ordos where national sorurity and foreign

intelligence is involved.

Under the standards and procedures established by the

President, the personal approval of the Attorney General is Ie-

quired before any non-consensual electronic surveillance may

be instituted within the United States without a judicial war-

rant.

A11

requests for surveillance must be made in writing by

the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and must

set forth the relevant factual circumstances that justify the

proposed surveillance.

Both the agency and the Presidential

appointee initiating the request must be identified. Requests

from the Director are examined by a special review group which

I have established within the Office of the Attorney. General.

Authorization will not be granted unless the Attorney General.

has satisfied himself that the requested electronic surveillance

is necessary for national security or foreign intelligence pur-

poses important to national security.

In addition, the Attorney

General must be satisfied that

the subject of the

surveillance is either assisting a foreign

L NW 65360_Docld:32989614_Page 50

## Page 51

- 3-.

power or foreign-based political group, or plans unlawful

activity directed against a foreign power or foreign-based

political group.

Finally, he must be satisfied that the

minimun physical intrusion necessary to obtain the informa-

tion will be used.

All authorizations are for a period of ninety days or

less, and the specific approval of the Attorney General is

again required for continuation of the surveillance beyond

that period.

The Attorney General has also been directed to

review all electronic. surveillance on a regular basis to en-

suxe that the aforementioned criteria are satisfied. Pursu-

ant to the mandate of United States v. United States District

Court, electronic surveillance without a judicial warrant is

not conducted where there is no foreign involvement.

All electronic surveillance related to national security

and foreign intelligence within the United States is conducted

by the Federal

Bureau of Investigation. The Bureau has estab-

lished strict internal review procedures with regard to all

electronic surveillance activities.

The extent of telephone and microphone surveillance

conducted within the United States

in the interests of nation-

al security and foreign intelligence was last disclosed in 1973.

On a comparable basis, the extent of such

surveillance between

1969 arid May 1975 is

set forth in the attached menoranda. The

total number of subjects of telephone surveillance during that

period is as follows:

1973, 116; 1974, 148. These figures do not, of

course, indicate

the number of persons those conversations were intercepted,, but

rather only the number of subjects

to whom the surveillance

directed.

The total number of subjects of microphone surveillance

• during that period was as follows:

1969, 14; 1970, 19; 1971, 10;

1972, 31; 1973, 38; 1974, 32.

Again, these figures do not in-

dicate. the number of persons whose conversations were inter-

cepted, but rather the number of subjects to whom the sur-

veillance was directed.. Moreover, I should further note that

the above figures are duplicative to an extent since in several

cases the same subject was under both telephone and microphone

surveillance.

The total installations of telephone and microphone sur-

veillances during the above periods would, of course, exceed

these figures by varying margins. On occasion, the sub-

ject under surveillance moved to

a new Location, thus nec

essitating a re-"nstallation of the surveillance at the new

On other occasions, the surveillance

Linued because the subject left the premises for an extended

was discon-

period, but was later re-instituted when the subject returned.

In still other cases,

the surveillance was discontinued for a

period as part of the Department's continuing review and re-

evaluation of all electronic surveillance activities.

The

subsequent re-institution of the surveillance pursuant to a

new approval by the Attorney General would be counted as an

additional installation.

For the above reasons, the number

of installations of telephone and microphone surveillances is

greater than the number of subjects of

such surveillance, and

would thus not provide an accurate basis for evaluating

the

extent of

electronic surveillance.

Nevertheless, pursuant to

your inquiry,

I am including in the attached memoranda the

total

number of installations of electronic surveillance devices

for

• both telephone and microphones.

I am alsn encinsing the maximum and minimum numher of ..::

telephone and microphone surveillances

installed and in opera-

tion for each month between November 1972 and April 1975.

These

figures are based on data compiled on a daily basis and reflect

installations and discontinuances of electronic surveillance de-

vices.

The records of daily counts were initiated in November

comparable intormation is not available for pIlot periods.

1s these figures indicate, the maximum number of telephone sur-

veillances in operation at any time during 1973 was 93; the

minimum number in operation that year was 65. The maximum

number of microphone surveillances

in operation during 1973

was 22; the minimum was

10. In 1974, the maximum number of

telephone surveillances in operation was 106; the minimum num-

ber in operation was 75.

Microphone surveillances in operation

during that period ranged from a maximum of 21 to a minimum of

10. During the first four

and a half months of 1975, the maxi-

mum number of telephone surveillances in operation at any time

was .9l; the minimum was

67. The, maximum number of microphone

surveillances in operation at any time during that period was

20; the minimum was 9. On April 1, 1975, there were 75 tele-

phone and 15 microphone surveillances in operation.

I trust that the information supplied to date is of

assistance to your subcommittee in its inquiry into the prac-

Reguest Pertaining to Identity of All

Mail Covers Placed by the FBI Since 1960

NOTE:

Reference is made to Legal Counsel memoranda to

Mr. J. B. Adams dated 5/23/75 and 6/12/75 which set out the

request upon which this response is predicated. The statistics

regarding the categories of mail covers noted in this memorandum

were derived by a review of each 3 x 5 card maintained by

the Special Records and Related Research (SRRR) Unit

on requested mail covers.

These cards are maintained

alphabetically by each field office.

They are not broken

down by either type of mail covers or by the categories in

which they are presented in this memorandum. To obtain the

statistics set out in this memorandum it was necessary to

duplicate all the records, categorize by the three types,

of mail covers and then subdivide the national security

mail covers into general categories.

The data contained on

each cara includes; subject, file number, time period, address,

and brief characterization.

In some instances supervisors

within the INTD who were familar with the subjects were con-

tacted to obtain information necessary to categorize.

As explained in the memorandum, this record was

kept in-house for count purposes only and therefore required

time to reassemble the data in the form presented.

It should be noted this record may not contain

every mail cover utilized by the FBI within the time period

the system is designed to

case supervisor and it is possible such notification has been

inadvertantly omited on a particular case.

This qualification

is made to advise as to the limitation of the documents upon

which the memorandum is based.

Preparation of this memorandum was coordinated

with Mr. John Russell, General Investigative, and John Mchale,

special Investigative, as to whether these Division's possess

records beyond those maintained within INTD. It was determined

that they did not.

known the identitles of te individuals, organizations, or

the energies aton

establishments upon whom mail covers have been placed. The

record system maintained by the FBI relating to the investigative

technique of mall covers does not permit a retrieval of the

entire data which was requested without a massive, time-

consuming research effort on a file-by-file basis.

SENSTUDY 75

By memorandum dated May 23, 1975, you were

advised that captioned Committee had directed a letter

to the U. S. Postal Service requesting information con~

cerning mail covers initiated by the Federal Bureau of

Investigation. The Committee was referred by Postal

Service to the Bureau.

Mr. John Elliff, Task Force Director,

was advised to direct a letter over the Chairman's

signature requesting the information.

On May 30, 1975, we recontacted Mr. Elliff again

asking that a letter be directed to the Bureau asking for

the information.

He was instructed that we had been gathering

the requested information, however; prior to our responding,

we should receive a confirmation from the Committee.

Present

at this discussion was K. William O'Connor, Special Counsel

to the Deputy Attorney General. The same information was

conveyed by Special Agent Paul V. Daly to Paul Wallach, Staff

Member of the Committee, who had been making the mail cover

inquiries. Mr. Wallach indicated that he would correspond

to the Bureau in accordance with this request.

K. William O'Connor advised subsequently that the

Department had received a letter from Wallach to the Department

June 7, 1975, containing the request. Mr. O'Connor stated

that this was not in accordance with our discussion with the

Committee and he was to convey the fact that the request

should

be over the Chairman's signature.

Memo to Mr. Adams from Legal Counsel

SENSTUDY 75

On June 11, 1975, Mike Shaheen of the Department,

who is working with K. William O'Connor in handling responses

to the captioned Committee, informed Special Agent Paul V. Daly

at 5:30 p.m. that we should respond to the request concerning

mail covers without waiting for a letter from the Committee

over the Chairman's signature. He advised that this instruction

was received fromDeputy Attorney General, Harold R. Tyler.

Tyler distinguished this postal request from others

by stating that inasmuch as the Committee Chairman had

authorized the Committee to inquire concerning mail covers

in a letter to U. S. Postal Services, it should not be

necessary for them to write a subsequent letter.

The requests to the Department were conveyed to

the Section Chief of the Intelligence Division, W. 0. Cregar,

on June 11, 1975.

RECOMMENDATION:

That the Intelligence Division expeditiously prepare

the necessary responses concerning mail covers.

IAN LI UNCLAGSITED

Dear Mr. O'Connor:

Pursuant to Section III (E) of the notification

attached to the Committee's letter of June 27, 1975, I

hereby request that a complete, unexcised set of the A

through E

surmaries of COINTELPRO cases prepared for the so-callea

Peterson Conmittee be delivered to our offices no later

than thursday, July 10, 1975.

As stated in

the notification, the Comnittee's

receipt of these summaries will form the basis of further

requests for information and documents.

It is impossible

to use the excised version of the summaries for this

purpose.

Since a thorough analysis of the summaries

requires that the volumes

be disassembled, and since

they must be available to staff members working evenings.

and weekends, it is necessary to have the summaries here

at our offices.

Thank you for your cooperation in this matter.

ALI JI ITORMATION CONTAINED

Dear Mr. O'Connor:

The purpose of this letter is to set down in

one place

the present status of the responses to the

Committee's requests regarding notional organizations.

Your letter of June 12, 1975, transmitted only

one memorandum in response to Appendix C, Part III, Item 24,

of the Committee's May 14, 1975 request.

We would

appreciate

your adrice whether any additional matorials exist which auc

responsive to this portion of our request, and, if so, when

they will be supplied.

With respect to your July 7, 1975 response to

Appendix C, Part III, Items 25 (a) and (b), we will need to

examine all of the materials which provided the basis for

the preparation of the Bureau's July 2, 1975 summary. In

addition, we will need to examine the materials which were

summarized in Item 2 under the heading "Types of Activity"

"Exhibit K" attachment to the so-called Peterson

Committee report, which I examined on July 8, 1975.

I would like to assure you that pursuant to your

request, we have seriously considered the Bureau's suggestion

for an oral briefing on this subject.

We have concluded,

however, that such a procedure would be helpful only after

we have had the opportunity to study the requested materials

which bear upon this subject.

I might add that in view of

the sensitivity of some of this material, we would certainly

be willing to review at FBI Headquarters

whichever of the

1QLI Bogaments pextain to sensitive ongoing Bureau operations.

At 2:50 p.m. on July 10, 1975, K. William O'Connor

called me and advised that Douglas Marvin, Special Assistant to the

Attorney General, has requested a briefing for the Attorney General

regarding the status of responses to inquiries by the Senate Select

Committee. He said that the briefing would be scheduled for the

afternoon of Tuesday, July 15, 1975, if possible. The briefing will

prepare the Attorney General for his appearance before the Senate Select

Committee during the latter part of that week to discuss the status of

responses. It is noted that we have received a written request from the

Committee for the Director and the Attorney General to appear to discuss

this matter in Executive Session.

In anticipation of such a request from the Attorney General,

we have caused a review to be undertaken and a status report prepared

as to all Bureau responses to Senate Select Committee inquiries plus a report

as to items actually delivered to the Committee. The distinction is that.

some materials prepared by the Bureau were delivered to the Department.

and have not been forwarded to the Committee.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

1. That the Intelligence Division expedite preparation of the

status report for information of the Director and to prepare for brieting

the Attorney General in the afternoon of July 15, 1975.

The purpose of this memorandum is to set forth in

summary form the requests we have received from various

Committees in Congress and the status of our replies.

Senate Select Committee

On Intelligence Activities (Church's Committee)

By letter dated 5-14-75, we received a lengthy request

from the Committee which pertains to among other things,

information concerning all wiretaps including their reconstruction

of Bureau files, as well as Inspection surveys for ten offices.

During a meeting on May 30, 1975, of the Committee, and the

Department, this particular requst was modified in some areas

to alleviate possible problems in preparing the responses.

Responses to many of the questions asked have been prepared,

approved, and delivered.

There remains, however, a substantial

amount of

work to be done.

Letter dated May 27, 1975, contained a request that

FBI documents in the custody of National Archives concerning

the Warren Commission be made available to the Committee for

review.

We have furnished a response to this request.

By letter dated May 28, 1975, the Committee requested

that certain Senators on the Select Committee be given access

to any Intormation concerning them in FBI files. This request

Is being handled using

the same guidelines as Freedom of Information

Act requests and material is being gathered.

The Department

has written a letter to the Committee regarding this request,

asking that a discussion be held.

They advised that on 6/7/75, they met SENSTUDY staff members

tions of current and former employees be approved

The intelligence agencies under review by this

present during certain interviews.

These guidelines have

not as yet been approved. Our current procedure has been

to brief current and former employees concerning their rights

and obligations prior to interview if they so desire. We

have also made available à Bureau representative to accompany

these individuals to an interview if requested. We feel

that, in addition to the general briefing of current and

former employees, they should be furnished a copy of the

attached basic statement of the employees Rights and Ob-

ligations, which may be taken with them during interview

or giving of testimony. This attachment will allow the

employees to have a document to which they might refer

if a matter arises wherein they have some question as to

whether they should respond to a particular question.

RECOMMENDATION:

That the attached basic statement of Rights and

Obligations be approved and furnished to all current and

former employees prior to interview or giving of testimony.

MEMORANDUM TO ALL EMPLOYEES

RE: INTERVIEWS OF FBI EMPLOYEES

All employees are advised that Congress is conducting

an inquiry into activities of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

Congressional staff members are conducting interviews of former

and current FBI employees. This Bureau has pledged its cooperation

with the Congress.

You are reminded of the FBI Employment Agreement

(copy attached) with which you agreed to comply during your employment

in the FBI and following termination of such employment.

Regulations, Section 18. 22 (copy attached), which reads as follows:

"No employee or former employee of the Department of

Justice shall, in response to a demand of a court or other authority,

produce any material contained in the files of the Department or disclose

any information relating to material contained in the files of the Department,

or disclose any information or produce any material acquired as part of

the performance of his official duties or because of his official status

without prior approval of the appropriate Department official or the

Attorney General in accordance with Section 16.24."

Also, you are reminded of Department of Justice Order

Number 116-56, dated May 15, 1956, (copy attached) which, among

other things, requires an employee upon the completion of his testimony

to prepare a memorandum outlining his testimony.

Our cooperative efforts, of course, must be consistent

purpose of interview or testimony you are to request approval as

required by the Employment Agreement and await authorization before

furnishing information, testimony, or record material.

EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT

As consideration for employment in the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), United

States Department of Justice, and as a condition for continued employment, I hereby declare

that I intend to be governed by and I will comply with the following provisions:

(1) That I am hereby advised and I understand that Federal law such as

Title 18, United States Code, Sections 793, 794, and 798; Order of the

President of the United States (Executive Order 11652); and regulations

issued by the Attorney General of the United States (28 Code of Federal

Regulations, Sections 16.21 through 16.26) prohibit loss, misuse, or un-

authorized disclosure or production of national security information, other

classified information and other nonclassified information in the files of

the FBI;

(2) I understand that unauthorized disclosure of information in the files

of the FBI or information I may acquire as an employee of the FBI could

result in impairment of national security, place human life in jeopardy, or

result in the denial of due process to a person or persons who are subjects

of an FBI investigation, or prevent the FBI from effectively discharging its

responsibilities. I understand the need for this secrecy agreement; there-

fore, as consideration for employment I agree that I will never divulge,

publish, or reveal either by word or conduct, or by other means disclose to

any unauthorized recipient without official written authorization by the

Director of the FBI or his delegate, any information from the investigatory

files of the FBI or any information relating to material contained in the files,

or disclose any information or produce any material acquired as a part of the

performance of my official duties or because of my official status. The burden

is on me to determine, prior to disclosure, whether information may be disclosed

and in this regard I agree to request approval of the Director of the FBI in each

such instance by presenting the full text of my proposed disclosure in writing to

the Director of the FBI at least thirty (30) days prior to disclosure. I understand

that this agreement is not intended to apply to information which has been placed

in the public domain or to prevent me from writing or speaking about the FBI but

it is intended to prevent disclosure of information where disclosure would be

contrary to law, regulation or public policy. I agree the Director of the FBI is

in a better position than I to make that determination;

(3) I agree that all information acquired by me in connection with my official

duties with the FBI and all official material to which I have access remains

the property of the United States of America, and I will surrender upon demand

by the Director of the FBI or his delegate, or upon separation from the FBI, any

material relating to such information or property in my possession;

(4) That I understand unauthorized disclosure may be a violation of Federal

law and prosecuted as a criminal offense and in addition to this agreement may

be enforced by means of an injunction or other civil remedy.

I accept the above provisions as conditions for my employment and continued employment

in the FBI. I agree to comply with these provisions both during my employment in the FBI and

following termination of such employment.

departmental files, interviews with department employees, testimony of depart

ment personnel, or testimony of Federal prisoners. The following procedures

re prescribed in order to effectuate this policy on a basis which will b

nutually satisfactory to the congressional committees and to the Department

linds order supersedes the Deputy Attorney General's Memorandum Ño. 5, dated

March 23, 1953, and his Memorandum No. 97, dated August 5, 1954. It formal-

Izes the Attorney General's press release of November 5, 1953, establishing

procedures to permit committees of the Congress and their authorized repre-

sentatives to interview and to take sworn testimony from Federal prisoners.

It supplements Order No. 3229 (Revised) dated January 13, 1953, and Order

3464, Supplement No. 4 (Revised) dated January 13, 1953 (with Memorandum

of "Authorization Under Order No. 3464 Supplement No. 4 (Revised)" dated

January 13, 1953), insofar as said orders have reference to procedures to be

followed in the Department's relations with congressional committees. In

support of this order, reference should be had to the President's letter

dated May 17, 1954, addressed to the Secretary of Defense, and to the Attorney

General's Memorandun which accompanied it.]

A. REQUESTS FOR INFORMATION FROM DEPARTMENT FILES

1. Congressional committee requests for the examination of files

or other confidential information should be reduced to writing, signed by

the chairman of the committee, and addressed to the Deputy Attorney General,

who is responsible for the coordination of our liaison with Congress and

congressional committees. The request shall state the specific information

sought as well as the specific objective for which it is sought. The Deputy

Attorney General will forward the request to the appropriate division where a

reply will be prepared and returned for the Deputy Attorney General's signa-

ture and dispatch to the chairman of the committee.

2. If the request concerns a closed case, 1. e., one in which

there is no litigation or administrative action pending or contemplated,

the file may be made available for review in the Department, in the presence

of the official or employee having custody thereof. The following procedure

shall be followed in such cases:

a. The reply letter will advise the committee that the

file is available for examination and set forth the

name, telephone extension number, and room number of

the person who will have custody of the file to be

reviewed;

NW 65360 Docld:32989614 Page 122

---

## Page 123

- 2 =

b. Before making the file available to the committee

representative all reports and memoranda from the FBI

as well as investigative reports from any other agency,

will be removed from the file and not be made available

for examination; provided however that if the committee

representative states that it is essential that information

Irom the FBl reports and memoranda be made available,

he will be advised that the request will be considered

by the Department. Thereafter a summary of the contents

of the FBI reports and memoranda Involved will be

prepared which will not disclose investigative tech-

niques, the identity of confidential informants, or

other. matters which might jeopardize the Investigative

operations of the FBI. This summary will be forwarded

by the division to the fBI with a request for advice as

to whether the FBI has any objection to examination of

such summary by the cormittee representative. The file

will not be physically relinquished from the custody of

the Department. If the committee representative desires

to examine investigative reports from other government

agencies, contained in the files of the Department, he

will be advised to direct his request to the agency whose

reports are concerned.

3. If the request concerns an open case, 1. e., one which liti-

Bation or administrative action is pending or contemplated, the file may

not be made available for ezamination by the committee's representative.

The following procedure shall be followed:

a. The reply letter should advise the committee that

its request concerns a case in which litigation or

administrative action is pending or contemplated, and

state to

state that the file cannot be made available until the

case is completed; and

b. Should briefly set forth the status of the case in

as much detail as is practicable and prudent without

jeopardizing the pending contemplated litigation or

administrative action.

B. REQUESTS FOR INTERVIEVS WITH DEPARIMENTAL PERSONNEL

1. Requests for interviews with departmental personnel regarding

any official matters within the Department should be reduced to writing,

signed by the chairman of the committee, and addressed to the Deputy Attorney

General. When the approval of the Deputy Attorney General is given, the

employee is expected to discuss such matters freely and cooperatively with

the representative, subject to the limitations prescribed in A respecting

open cases and data in investigative reports;

- 3 -

2. Upon the completion of the interview with the committee repre-

sentative the employee will prepare a summary of it for the file, with a

copy routed to his division head and a copy routed to the Deputy Attorney

General.

C. EMPLOYEES TESTIFYING BEFORE CONGRESSIONAL COMMITTEES

1. When an employee is requested to testify before a congressional

committee regarding official matters within the Department the Deputy Attorney

General shall be promptly informed.

When the Deputy Attorney General's approv-

al is given the employee is expected to testify freely subject to limitations

prescribed in A respecting open cases and data in investigative reports;

2. An employee subpoenaed to testify before a congressional committee

on official matters within the Department shall promptly notify the Deputy

Attorney General.

In general he shall be guided in testifying by Order 3229

(Revised) and the President's letter of May 17, 1954, cited at the beginning.

of this Order.

3. Upon the completion of his testimony the employee will prepare

a memorandum outlining his testimony with a copy routed to his division head

and a copy routed to the Deputy Attorney General.

D. REQUESTS OF CONGRESSIONAL COMMITTEES FOR THE TESTIMONY OF FEDERAL PRISONERS

Because of the custodial hazards involved and the extent to which

their public testimony may aifect the aiscipline and well-being of the institu-

tion, it is the policy of the department not to deliver Federal prisoners out-

side the penal institution in which they are Incarcerated for the purpose of

being interviewed or examined under oath by congressional committees. However,

when it appears that no pending investigation or legal proceeding will be

adversely arfected thereby and that the public interest will not be otherwise

adversely affected, Federal prisoners may be interviewed or examined under oath

by congressional committees in the institution in which they are incarcerated

i the there on in vaca.

under the following procedures, and with the specific advance approval of the

Deputy Attorney General.

I. Arrangements for interviewing and taking of sworn testimony

rom a Federal prisoner by a committee of the Congress or the authorize

epresentatives of such a committee shall be made in the form of a writter

request by the chairman of the committee to the Deputy Attorney General.

Such written request shall be made at least ten (10) days

prior to the requested date for the interview and the taking of testimony

and shall be accompanied by written evidence that authorization for the

interview or the taking of sworn testimony was approved by vote of the com-

mittee. Such request shall contain a statement of the purpose and the sub-

jects upon which the prisoner will be interrogated as vell as the names of

all persons other than the representatives of the Department of Justice who

will be present.

3. A member of the interested committee of the Congress shall be

present during the entire time of the interrogation.

NW 65360 Docld:32989614 Page 124

!

- 4-

4. The warden of the penal institution in which the Federal

prisoner is incarcerated shall, at least forty-eight (48) hours prior to the

time at which the interview takes place, advise the Federal prisoner concerned

of the proposed interview or taking of suor testimony; and shall further

advise that he is under the same, but no greater obligation to answer than any

other witness who is not a prisoner.

5. The warden of the penal institution shall have complete

authority in conformity with the requirements of security and the mainte-

nance of discipline to limit the number of persons who will be present at

the interview and taking of testimony.

6.

the warden or his authorized representative shall be present

at the interview and at the taking of testimony and the Department of Justice

testimony

shall have the right to have one of its representatives present throughout

the interview and taking of testimony.

?. The committee shall arrange to have a stenographic transcript

made of the entire proceedings at committee expense and shall furnish a copy

of the transcript to the Department of Justice.

E. OBSERVERS IN ANTENDANCE AT COMMITURE HEARINGS

In order that the Department may be kept currently advised in

matters within its responsibility, and in order that the Deputy Attorney

General may properly coordinate the Department's liaison with Congress and

Its committees, each division that has an observer in attendance at a

congrssional hearing, will have the observer prepare a written summary of

the proceeding which should be sent to the division head and a copy routed

to the Deputy Attorney General.

After review of A-E as excised, Mr. Elliff has asked

This request was iden-

Accordingly, I recommend that Mr. Elliff be granted

personal access to Exhibits K, I, and P, at the offices of the

Bergeron served as an FBI SA from August 2, 1943, until

Bergeron was contacted by SSC Staff Member

Michael Ipstein, who asked to intervier Bergeron at

10:00 a.Il. June 27, 1975, at the SSC offices. Bergeron

contacted

the FBI for the purposes of inquiring as to

release from a secrecy agreement with the FBI and to secure

consultation assistance at the time of the interview in

the event the interview led into privileged areas such as

relating to possible identification of FBI sources and

possibly affecting ongoing investigations. On June 27, 1975,

Bergeron was informed by the FBI that he was being released

fron any applicable employment agreement for the purposes

of the SSC intervier concerning the FBI investigations of

Martin Luther Ring, Jr., Stanley David Levison and the

Assoc. Dir.

Southern Christian Leadership Conference.

It was explained

Dep. AD Adm. -

Dep. AD Inv. -

to Bergeron that he had a right to counsel; however, the

Asst. Dir.:

Admin. -

FBI was unable to provide private counsel.

(It is noted

Comp. Syst. -

that Epstein had independently advised the FBI that the

Ext. Affairs — above three subject matters would be explored during the

SITATE SELECT COMITTTEE ON INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC)

RE: INTERVILY OF RETIRED FBI SA BY SSC

by an Fbl representative who made himself available for

possible consultation purposes but this representative vas

never called upon during the intervier.

Bergeron was intervieved in SSC quarters for the

approxinate period of 10:20 a.m. to 11:20 a.M. June 27, 1975.

The interview was to have commenced at 10:00 a.Il., but

Epstein devoted approximately 20 minutes arranging for

adequate space for the interview. In addition to Epstein,

another Staft Member, Mary Bedred, was present. She took

notes in longhand throughout the interview and

also partici-

pated in some of the questioning to a small degree.

At the

outset, Bergeron was advised of his right to counsel and

other rights and told that if he gave any information

indicating a possible violation of Federal law, his infornation

would be turned over to the Department of Justice. The

intervier was not under oath and was not pursuant to a

subpocna. The details of the interview are set out below,

not necessarily in chronological order.

Bergeron was asked for biographic data insofar as

his FBI career was concerned and he advised that he had

entered the FBI in a clerical capacity in 1940 and vas

assigned to the Washington Field Office (IFO) of the FBI

from October, 1942, until his Ictirement in September, 1965,

almost the entire period as an SA.

Bergeron was questioned and furnished information

about the organization of UFO, principally relating to the

squads engaged in security work. He vas asked to idencily

supervisory and other personnel attached to the various

security squads when he worked in ITO and in most instances

his replies vere that due to time lapse he was unable to

furnish specific names. He pointed out that if there was

made available to him the various personnel directories

of TO down through the years he might batter be able to

respond to such inquiries.

• Questioning turned to the FBI investigation of

Martin Luther King, Jr., and specifically to electronic

coverage of King at the Willard Hotel in Uashington, D. C.,

in the mid-1960's.

He was asked how this coverage came

about and responded that he was called into the office of

the Security Coordinator in WEO, Luäwig I. R. Oberndorf

(deceased). Present vere an FBI Assistant Director, William C.

Sullivan, SA William Welch (deceased) and two to four other

VEQ SAs, names not now recalled.

This conference was led

by sullivate re cominy to washington,

was Sullivan's information that King had spent time in

New York City and had been discovered to have a number of

communist contacts there.

Because of these contacts, the

FBI interest in King vas a national security matter, according

to Sullivan.

Bergeron vas asked whether Sullivan mentioned

the specific types of coverage desired and Bergeron could

not recall beyond the generic description of technical.

Bergeron explained that S4 Welch vas present because he vas

the hotel contact man for WFO. It was assumed that because

King was coming to Hashington, D. G., with several other

individuals, they would probably stay at a hotel rather than

in someone's home.

It was therofore believed desirable to

utilize the help of an SA who had contacts with the various

hotels.

Bergeron tas queried as to who made the decision

as to the ezaci types of coverage io be put in effcot and

Bergeron replied that he himself nade that decision. He vas

asked if there was office correspondence authorizing an

installacion and Bergeron responded that there was--that he

alvays insisted that there be when he made an installation.

Bergeron explained that the authorization could have been

either of tuo types. The Bureau letter might have authorized

only a feasibility survey; or it might have authorized both

feasibility survey and installation. Bergeron said that he

had seen whatever paper there was containing the authorization

even though such correspondence would be addressed to the

Special Agent in Charge (SAG). He explained the routing of

such mail hereby the SAG would route it to the appropriate

supervisor and then to the Si tho vas to make the installation.

In response to general questioning, Bergeron

advised that electronic surveillances might start in tro

different ways. One would be when a field office would

originate the correspondence and the other would be when FBI

Headquarters would originate the correspondence.

In response to questions conceming the type and

nature of the installation. Bergeron made at the Willard Hotel,

he advised that he had placed a transmitter in each of two

to have the housckeeper change the lamps in tvo roons which

had been sot aside foz ling and his party. This vas

handled in this matter in order in afford nanimm sccurity.-

to the operation and avoid, if possible, any suspicion among

employees of the hotel which might have been then transmitted

to the King party.

Bergeron vas asked whether any telephone surveillance

was Installod and he roplied that none had bech made in tho

Willard Hotel. Dergoron could not rccall hother or noi

the Eureau had

asked for such a surveillance. In any event,

Bergeron explained that such a surveillance would have been

too complicated because of the presence of a switchboard at

the hotel. Bergeron tas asked whether he could have used

switchboard operators to assist in such a survelllance and

his response fas "ho."

Bergeron was nost askod if he had

over put a eclophone surveillanes in any hoïcl roon and he

responded, "Io you mean in the lling case?" Epstein then

asked if Bergeron had made such an installation in any case

and Bergeron advised Ipstein that he vas cleared to discuss

only the King case.

Questioning then turned to the matter of the

monitoring of the niccophone curvoillance which ho had

installed. Berycron explained that they rcquirce to roons

for such monitoring and that there were utilized in these

rooms radlo receivers and tape recorders. Upon request,

Bergeron gave the name of Bill Gampbell as one of the SAs

doing the monitoring and said there was another SA, name

unrecalled. Bergeron indicated that he himself listened

to very little of the transmissions; only cnough to test

the efficioncy of the trancissions. Borgoron was asked is

that he probably had but did not recall any of the contents.

Bergeron alvised that he probably saw transcripts of the

monitoring but again could not recall ony of the contents.

but root y

He was questioned as to what happencd to the logs and

transcripts and replied that he assumed that they had been

sent to FBI Headquarters. As to the tapes thenselves,

Bergeron indicated he had no idea of what disposition vas

made of them.

Bergeron was asked if WO had a file on King

prios to the situation described above and he advised he

had no knowledge on that matter.

He was asked if he knew of any other similar

coverage on King in other places and his response was that

any affirmative ansver he might give would be mere hearsay.

Epstein inquired of Bergeron as to who he had

talked to after Ipstein first called him to arcange the

interview.

Bergeron told Epstein that he had talked to

another FBI SA, Ernest Belter (previously interviewed by SSC

Staff). Epstein Inquired as to why Bergeron had contacted

Belter and Bergeron told Epstein that he did it for the

purpose of thanking Belter for "small favors" because Belter

had supplied Bergeron's name to Ipstein. Bergeron also

explained that he called Belter, who he

had learned had

already been interviewed by the SSC, to find out who he,

Bergeron, should talk to in the Bureau about any forthcoming

intervier.

In response to questioning, Bergeron told Epstein

that earlier that morning he had seen FBI Assistant Director

John Mintz and SA Willian 0. Gregar in connection with

obtaining the necessary clearance prior to being interviewed.

RE: ITTERVIEW OF RETIRED FBI SA BY SSC

He was asked if they had discussed the Ring case vich him

and he responced that they had not. He was asked it he

had revierred any i'll files prior to the interview and ho

responded that he had not. He vias asked if any files vece

offered to him and he responded that none had been offered

him. He vas asked whether he had requested an opportunity

to revier FBI files and he replied that he had not made any

such request,

Miss Debreo then asked Bergeron if it was his

decision to not look at FBI files to refresh his memory

prior to the interviev. He responded by advising that he

no longer vorked for the IBI and therefore believed he had

no cight to revier FBI files.

Questioning then turned to the matter of photogmphic

coverage of King at the Willard Hotel and in response to o

direct question,

Bergeron advised there was no such coverage.

He was asked whether any "surreptitious coverago" was

utilized and his response was that none had been used. He

was questioned concerning possible use of TV coverage and

responded that none was used, Bergeron explained that they

were talking about a period over 10 years ago when such

equipment was not nearly as well developed as it is today.

Then it appeared that the interview nas concluded,

Bergeron inquired as to whether the interviewers vere

"Finished" with him. Epstein indicated that they were not

and that they rould probably call hin back again because of

Bergeron's "broad general knowledge of intelligence activictes."

Bergeron disclaimed such knowleûge.

NOTE:

Bergeron was accompanied to the interview by

SAS. F. Phillips of the Senstudy 75 Project, who also

debriefed Bergeron as reported herein. The advice given to

Bergeron prior to the interview concerning being released

from employment agreement was by Assistant Director Mintz.

Attached is a request for further detailed information from

Senate Select Committee, regarding COINTELPRO, from Mr. Elliff dated

иду 1, 1975.

Please note that this matter is considered and characterized

as an "abuse" (see page 21 of enclosures to SSC letter of June 27,

previously forwarded); accordingly, any Agent interview would be an

"abuse interview" subject to the strictures set forth in the "Outline

for Inquiry Procedures" referenced in the SSC letter of June 27.

Because of this, I feel we should discuss the procedures for inter-

view which may be sought under page 2, paragraph "Interviews" of

Mr. Elliff's attached letter. It may be that the matter should be

discussed with the Deputy Attorney General as well, after Mr. Levi

has responded to the SSC letter of June 27.

A significant legal

problem may be presented by the compulsion of Agents' appearance.

Please also note the attached Departmental decision on the interpre-

tation of "demand" in 28 C.F.R., 16.21 et. seq. This decision will

bear on our resolution of the pending a problem

REALM.

The meaning of "demand" is not indicated, beyond subpoena, in

the C.F.R. sections indicated.

Inis omission creates a need for an

interpretation, for purposes of uniform Department of Justice reaction.

Outlines for inquiry proceedings were agreed upon between the

White House and the Senate Select Commiütee on June 13, 1915, and a

copy of those procedures was furnished to the Department on June 10,

Under those guidelines, there is a general undertaking by the

Cormittee to identify witnesses to the Agency a reasonable time cefore

the interviews occur.

This general rule includes current and former

employees; certain exceptions (not clearly defined) are indicated in

the guidelines. The Committee is required to provide the witness with

a copy of the procedures, and "relevant waivers of secrecy oaths or

agreements for the purpose of this inquiry". The Conmittee is required

to give prior notice of an interview, generally, specifying: (a) sub-

ject area; (b) periods of employment; (e) the date set for the interview.

Since these structured procedures, taken with the rules of the

Subcommittee, may create a requirement of testimony upon witnesses, it

seems to me clear that the paragraphs of 28 C.F.R., $ 16.21, et. sea.,

which refer to "demand" should be interpreted to include any request

by any Committee staff member to interview any employee,

former employee

or other person connected with the Department of Justice.

This Interpretation requires certain action: (1) that the wit

ness be authorized to speak under $ 16.23 by an appropriate Departrent

Official; and, (2) that an appropriate Department Official be designatea

I would think that the appropriate Department Official for the FBI shoule

be the Director of the FBI or the FBI General Counsel, in coordination

with this offiçe.

NOTE:

The 6/24/75 SSC letter made reference to prior SSC

request pertaining to the FBI investigation of Martin Luther King,

Jx., and indicated that of the persons listed in the letter,

with only two exceptions (Larry Gurley and William D. Campbell),

all were believed to have served at either Atlanta or Albany,

Georgia, with the FBI. Gurley and Campbell were understood

to have

been assigned to FBIHQ. In attempting to identify

correctly the individuals listed because of misspellings of

names, we ran down the fact that with the exception of Gurley

and Campbell, all had at one time served in the Atlanta Field

Office except for a John Bassett. The only current or

former Agent by this name is assigned to Chicago and has never

NOTE CONTINUED:

been assigned to Atlanta. P. V. Daly of Legal Counsel Division

rechecked with Mike Epstein of the SSC Staff who advised that

the John Bassett in Chicago is the correct one. S. F. Phillips

of the Senstudy 75 Project telephonically contacted Bassett

6/26/75 and determined Bassett not only has never been assigned

to Atlanta but he has no recollection of having ever

worked on

the King case.

Notwithstanding, ve are including Basset's current

office of assignment as requested, even though we currently do

not know specifically why the SSC is considering interviewing him.

whon facts indicate a violation of Federal statutes over

which the mii las investigative jurisdiction may occur; oi

at a sito where indiviauals of investigative interest to

separate organization which espuuses & basic lazier-

Isninist-jacist revolutionary ideology. Investigation of

both of these organizations is based on inforuation which

indicates they may be engaged in activitios which could

Conspiraoy), 2385 (Advocating Overthiow of Govoranent) ,

and

2387 (Sedition), In addition, inasmuch as the possibility

existed individuals present at the denonstration would

attempt to doface Federal property, there was reason to

believe a violation oi 12z1e 18, United States Code,

Section 1361 (Descruction of Govornment Property) could occur.

At a later date, additional inframation was recoived from 2

second source, who has provided reliable information in the

past,

that the demonstration at the fedoral Building in Akron

sould be to protest United States involvement in Southeast

Asia, and leaflets urging support of this denonstration vera

being distributed in the Aron-Keut, Ohio, aren.

Survalllance in this case nas not related to any

bomb threat; however, based on the information stated above,

there was reason ics

the FBi to suspect that there might be

violations of Federal statutes over which the FbI has investi

gative jurisdiction.

In the event such violations did occus,

It would be necessary that Agents be present to gather the

The FBI did bave an interest relating to the

At the present time the type of equipment to be used in photographing

civil rights demonstrations and similar activity is left to the discretion of the

Special Agent in Charge who should make the necessary evaluation as to the

type of equipment most suitable in view of existing circumstances and available

equipment.

The question of whether such pictures will be taken openly or by

the use of concealed photographic equipment will continue to be the responsibility

of the Special Agent in Charge who will be held accountable for exercising sound

(D) ATTACHE PHOTOCOPY UNITS - PHOTOGRAPHIC EQUIPMENT -

The Attache Photocopy Units are portable document copy equipment inese

units are now available for field use. The enclosure shows one of these

units in various stages of assembly. Units will be furnished to each office

having available a Special Agent who has received the Laboratory's

specialized training in surveillance photography. The equipment wii!

be sent by FBI Laboratory invoice, and on receipt of the equipment

appropriate inveitorb/additions should be made, gecording the serial number

of the unit along with the serial number of the camera and of the lens.

Panatomic & fim for use in this equipment can be requisitioned from Bureau

supply.

This document copy equipment is completely self-contained,

requires no outside power source and, therefore, can be used to copy

documents in an automobile or at any location without regard to the avail-

ability of electric power of any kind. These units are contained in regular

attache cases measuring 18 inches by 12 inches by 4 3/4 inches and the

gross weight of each unit is 16 pounds. The units are assembled by raising

the supporting sides into upright positions and placing the camera-light

assembly in position on top of these sides. The lights are then swung

to the sides to complete the assembly. An assembled copy unit may be

used, either standing in the attache case, or removed from it. Documents

up to legal size may be copied in a single exposure but large documents may

be copied in sections by multiple exposures if the units are removed from the

attache cases. Complete operating instructions are included with each unit.

The lights in the Attache Photocopy Units are electron photoflash

lights and are powered by a 90-volt battery which is good for a minimum of

1000 exposures. The camera used in the equipment is a standard 35 mm

Minolta SR-1 camera with a 35mm fs Rokkor lens. Thesa cameras take

standard 36 exposure loads of film, have rapid wind levers and may be

reloaded without detaching from the units. Kodak Panatomic X or equivalent

ASA 50 film requires an exposure of 1/15 second at f1l or 1/8 second at f16

in these units.

Attache Photocopy Units have already been furnished to New York,

Washington Field, Jackson, Miami, and Atlanta. In the near future units

will be forwarded to Albany, Albuquerque, Baltimore, Birmingham, Boston,

Buffalo, Charlotte, Chicago, Cincinnati, Cleveland, Dallas, Detroit, Honolulu,

Houston, Indianapolis, Jacksonville,

Kansas City, Knoxville, Las Vegas,

Little Rock, Los Angeles, Louisville, Milwaukee, Minneapolis, Mobile,

Newark, New Haven, New Orleans, Norfolk, Oklahoma City, Omaha,

Philadelphia, Phoenix, Pittsburgh, Portland, Richmond, St. Louis, San

Antonio, San Diego, San Francisco, San Juan, Seattle, and Springheld.

Request for additional Attache Photocopy Units or request from offices not

receiving units at this time should be made by letter marked for the attention

of the FBI Laboratory.

(B) YAUTÓMOTÍVE EQUIPMENT USED IN SURVEILLANCES -- You ăre

reminded of the necessity that automotive equipment used in surveillances

be suificiently varied as to minimize the danger that persons under

surveillances will recognize it as "policemen's equipment." A limited

amount of special surveillance equipment is located in the various offices.

Efforts will be made in the future to augment this equipment. Until

procurement of sufficiently varied automotive equipment can be obtained,

you are authorized to make appropriate use of rental equipment where

necessary; however, it is your responsibility to see that such rental

equipment is completely justified.

Whenever such use will be extensive

and the cost is estimated to exceed $100, prior Bureau authority must be

obtained and may be obtained on an expedite basis. You are reminded of

the importance of maintaining special surveillance vehicles and equipment

in a secure manner to insure none of our surveillances are in any way

jeopardized. Existing regulations require that all radio-equipped

surveillance trucks be provided separate garage and storage treatment.

The desirability of maintaining other surveillance automotive equipment

separately from our normal equipment should be carefully evaluated.

Where circumstances dictate, such equipment should be provided the

same separate facilities as is now required of radio-equipped surveillance

trucks. Appropriate manual changes concerning the rental of surveillance

equipment will be forthcoming.

(EL) VESPIONAGE AND FOREIGN INTELLIGENCE INVESTIGATIONS

SURVEILLANCES

OF SOVIET-BLOC PERSONNEL - For years Soviet officials in the United

States have made numerous and repeated trips throughout this country

aimed at obtaining valuable data regarding our air bases, missile

sites and other important defense installations. In recent years

they have coordinated their activities in this regard with the

satellite countries and in this way are getting coverage of areas

It the united states closed to soviet travel.

In connection with our responsibility in regard to coverage

of soviet-bloc activities, these Soviet-bloc officials have been

placed under surveillance.

Many offices have participated in these

surveillances, and it appears that this activity on the part of the

Soviet bloc will continue.

On May 16, 1962, a number of newspapers in the United

the United States he was constantly shadowed by the "American secret

service.

He also alleged newspaper reporters and television men

I had

"close business connections with the FBI" because reporters met

him at the railroad station in Portland, Oregon, when he arrived

there. He alleged he was under heavy surveillance in seattle,

Washingion, and furnished license numbers of

two automobiles he

alleged were conducting surveillance of him in Los Angeles,

California.

The Bureau determined that the allegations of the Soviet

correspondent were completely false and undoubtedly were an attempt

by the soviets to embarrass this Bureau and to curtail our counter-

intelligence operations.

There is a definite possibility other

Soviet-bloc personnel may make similar charges in the future and

in this connection may attempt to obtain proof of their allegations,

such as obtaining photographs of Bureau cars or surveillance agents.

It is known that bloc personnel have made numerous attempts to do

this in the past.

We do not intend to allow a false allegation by the

Soviet bloc to alter coverage of their activities.

Our surveil-

lances undoubtedly have hampered the Soviets in collection of

intelligence data in the United States, and we can expect them

to create or utilize any incident they can as a basis for protest

against our coverage.

It is desired, therefore,

that the above

Tacts De

called to the attention of all agents.

It should be pointed

out that while the Bureau desires our

coverage of Soviet-bloc

officials to be as complete as possible, the surveillance

must be discreet and every precaution must be

taken

to avoid

giving the Soviets a basis for protest.

You should impress upon agents handling

surveillances

of Soviet-bloc personnel in the United States that they must

constantly exercise keen alertness, careful planning and

good

judgment in handling all facets of

our surveillance operations.

Very truly yours,

John Edgar Hoover

Director
