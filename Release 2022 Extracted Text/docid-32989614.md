The Attorney General

NOTE:

The Attorney General's letter dated 6/24/75 traces.
the legal authority to wtilize warrantless electronic |
surveillances; the Attorney General's 5/12/75 letter traces
the legal authority for consensual electronic surveillances.
The 6/24/75 letter has been released to the press by the
Attorney General. On 7/3/75 Mr. Douglas Marvin, Special
Assistant to the Attorney General, told SA John W. Daiseg,
INTID, that the Attorney General's 5/12/75 letter was sent to
Senator Kennedy "without any restrictions" and that it may
well appear in some future transcript of Congressional
hearings.

The Committee requested data regarding the legal
authority for "all forms of electronic surveillance and
consensual electronic Surveillance" in: Appendix A, item 5a.

The enclosed material covers warrantless electronic surveillances
and consensual electronic surveillances. It does not appear
necessary to point out the legal basis for warranted electronic
surveillances in Title III of Public Law 70-351.

Appendix B, items 4a and b requested data indicating
the original decision to utilize these techniques and data
indicating the policies and procedures of the FBI for the
utilization of these techniques. The policies and procedures
of the FBI for utilization of these techniques are those
required by the Attorney General which are set out in the
enclosed material. The fact that the FBI utilizes electronic
surveillances, with anlwithout consent, is public knowledge
and it does not appear necessary to point this out.

Dear Senator Kennedy: _

In response to your letter of- April 24, 1975, I am
presently able to provide you with most of the information
you have requested concerning the electronic surveillance

‘ activities of federal departments and agencies. The in-

formation contained in this letter and the enclosed material
relates mainly to electronic surveillance conducted within

. the United States pursuant to the criminal law enforcement

responsibilities of the federal government. It does not
include electronic surveillance that may be conducted either
in the interests of national security, or outside the United
States by federal departments and agencies other than the
‘Department of Justice. As to these latter areas, the De~
partment is still in the process of assembling and review-
ing the materials relevant to your request, and we are thus
unable at this time to determine what information we may be
able to provide. I should note that in several instances
your letter requests information that is either not in the
‘possession of this Department or pertains to.areas outside

. its proper jurisdiction. Since I understand that you have

sent similar letters to other federal departments and agen-
cies, I expect that you will receive responses from them.

‘Nevertheless, I believe the information contained in this

letter ané the enclosed material will answer in substantial
part the questions you have raised concerning electronic
surveillance..

Apart from the area of national security, electronic

surveillance conducted within the United States by federal
Gepartments and agencies may be divided into two broad

categories: consensual and non-consensyal. Consensual
electronic surveillance refers to those instances in which
one or more parties to the communication is a federal agent,
is cooperating with a federal agent, or has consented to
the surveillance. Th? Supreme Court has repeatedly held
that the warrant requirement of the Fourth Amendment does
not apply to consensual surveillance. See, e.g., United
States v. White, 401 U.S. 745 (1971); Lopez v. White, 373
U.S. 427 (1963); Rathbun v. United States, 355 U.S. 107
(1957); On Lee v. United States, 343 U.S. 747 (1952). Con-
gress has also excepted’ consensual electronic surveillance
from the provisions of Title III of the Omnibus Crime Con-
trol and Safe Streets Act of 1968, including the requirement
of a court order. Thus, “sections 2511 (a) (ce) and (d) of Title
18 of the United States Code provide:

(c) It shall not be unlawful under this
chapter for a person acting under color of law
to intercept a wire or oral communication, where
such person is a party to the communication or
one of the parties to the communication has given
prior consent to such interception.

. (a) It shall not be unlawful under this
chapter for a person not acting under color of
law to intercept a wire or oral communication
where such person is a.party to the communication
ox where one of the parties to the communication

has given prior consent to such interception un~
ess such communication is intercepted for the
purpose of committing any criminal or tortious

: act in violation of the Constitution or laws of

+ | the United States or of any State or for the pur-

pose of committing any other injurious act.

Although consensual electronic surveillance may thus
be conducted without a court order, its use by federal agents
has been subject to regulations issued by the Attorney, General
since 1967. The current regulations are specified in Attorney
General Kleindienst's memorandum of October 16, 1972 entitled

"Memorandum to the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies,

Re: Monitoring Private Conversations with the Consent of

a Party," and in a subsequent amending order issued by
Attorney General Saxbe. Copies of the memorandum and order
are enclosed herein.

In general, all federal agencies and departments
are required to obtain advance authorization from either
the Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Criminal
Division,-or Deputy Assistant Attorney General of that
Division before any electronic device may be used to over-
hear, transmit, or record a private conversation, cther than
a telephone conversation, without the consent of all the
parties to that conversation. In exigent circumstances
precluding a prior request for authorization -- such as
imminent loss of essential evidence or a threat to the
immediate safety of an agent or informant -- emergency
monitoring may be instituted with the authorization of the
head of the responsible department or agency or his designee,
The Assistant Attorney General of the Criminal Division, how-
ever, must be notified promptly of any such monitoring and
of the specific conditions that precluded obtaining prior 7
approval. :

The above procedures do'’not apply to consensual moni-
toring of telephone conversations. Because they involve the
transmission of a participant's voice through a complex and
far-reaching network of wires, the common use of party lines
_and extension telephones, and the possibility of an unseen
participant permitting another person to listen on the same
extension, telephone conversations have long been thought

- not to enjoy the same expectation of privacy as face-to-face
conversations. For this reason, supervision and control over
consensual monitoring of telephone conversations are vested
instead in the- head of each federal department and agency,
who is required to adopt appropriate regulations and- pro~
cedures on the subject. These regulations usually do not
restrict consensual monitoring of telephone conversations in
any significant respect. The relevant regulations of the
Drug Enforcement Administration are enclosed herein.

Hon. Edward M. Kennedy ‘ |
May 12, 1975 i :

The current regulations issued by the Attorney
General also require the head of each federal department
and agency to exercise responsibility for the security of
all consensual monitoring devices, including the maintenance
of current inventories as to amounts, storage, and users of
such equipment, and to submit to the Attorney General dur-
ing July of each year a report containing an inventory of
all electronic and mechanical equipment designed for the
monitoring of conversations and a brief statement of the
results obtained from their use during the prior fiscal year.

All federal departments and agencies having criminal
investigative responsibilities are authorized to conduct con~
sensual electronic surveillance. These agencies include,
inter-alia, the Bureau of Alcohol; Tobacco and Firearms, the
Bureau of Customs, the Department of Agriculture, the Internal
Revenue Service, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the

i Drug Enforcement Administration, the Postal Service, the
Secret Service, the Department of Defense, the Naval Investi-
* gative Service, the Immigration and Naturalization Service,
and the Department of Interior. The number of consensual
uses of electronic surveillance devices authorized by the
Department of Justice between 1970 and 1974 is set forth in
- the attached memoranda. The total annual authorizations were
as follows: 1970, 512; 1971, 840; 1972, 1272; 1973, 1484;
1974, 2518. In the first quarter of 1975, the total number
of authorizations was 1,125. In March 1975, the total author-
ized was 461. The above figures, of course, do not include
: consensual monitoring of telephone conversations. Nor do
they include consensual electronic surveillance that may be
conducted either outside the United Pates or in the inter-
ests of national security.

i Apart from the area of national security and foreign
intelligence, .non-consensual electronic surveillance within
the United States is conducted pursuant to a court order.
Under Title III of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets

.. Act of 1968, the Attorney General may authorize an applica-
' tion to a federal judge of a competent jurisdiction, who may
grant an order approving the interception of wire or oral

commurications “by the Federal Bureau of Investigation,
or a Federal agency having responsibility for the investi-
gation of the offense as to which the application is made,“
when such interception may provide or has provided evidence
of certain specific offenses enumerated in section 2516 of
Pitle 18 of the United Staias Code. The agencies having
investigative responsibilities under section 2516, and
hence authority to conduct non-consensual electronic sur-
veillance, are the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Bur-
eau of Customs, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the

Secret Service, the Internal Revenue Service, the Bureau of
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, and the Postal Service.

\
i

The administrative procedures and guidelines govern-
ing electronic surveillance under Title III are contained in
the Manual for Conduct of Electronic Surveillance, a copy of

= which'is enclosed. The procedures specified in’ the Manual *
apply to every federal department or agency authorized to
conduct electronic surveillance under Title III? All sur~
veillante euthorized under Title III is conducted within the
United States or Puerto Rico; Title III has no application
in foreign countries. See 18 U.S.C. 2516(1). .

: The extent of electronic surveillance conducted by
the federal government pursuant to Title III between 1971
and 1974 is contained in the reports issued by the Adminis-
trative Office of The United States Courts, as required by
18 U.S.C. 2519(3). Copies of those reports are enclosed
with this letter. The number of electronic surveillances

* authorized under Title III so far in 1975 is 28. The Federal

_ Bureau of Investigation requested 27 of those surveillances,

including 3 extensions. The Drug Enforcement Lhe lane
requested the remaining 1.

With respect to electronic surveillance conducted
outside the United States, I can provide you with informa-
tion relating only to the policy and practice of the Depart-

ment of Justice. With the exception of the Drug Enforce-
ment Administration, no division, bureau, or agency of

this Department conducts electronic surveillance outside
the United States for any purpose, including national
security. The Drug Enforcement Administration does con-
duct electronic surveillance outside the United States in
certain limited circumstances. This surveillance is pres-
ently undertaken only on a bilateral basis, that is, with
the approval and participation of the foreign country in-
volved. It is my understanding, however, that a predecessor
organization of DEA did conduct non-consensual electronic
surveillance unilaterally in at least one instance occurring
in 1973. ‘The surveillance was initiated in connection with
‘that organization's criminal law enforcement responsibilities
and was designed to obtain information concerning inter-
national drug traffickers. The subject of the surveillance
was a foreign national, and not an American citizen or an
alien resident of the United States. ~

Under its current policy, DEA does not conduct any
non-consensual electronic surveillance abroad without the
approvel and participation of the foreign country. In al-
most all cases, the surveillance is actually conducted by
law énforcement officials of the foreign country, rather
‘than by DEA, and is not initiated as the result of a request
‘by DEA. I am informed that the instances in which DEA has
been responsible in any way for electronic surveillance
conducted abroad are exceedingly few, and that in none of
these was the subject of the surveillance an American citizen
or an alien resident of the United States.

Under existing regulations, the approval of the U.S.
Chief of Mission in the host country is required before DEA
May conduct, or request a foreign country to conduct, non-
consensuaJ. electronic surveillance outside the United States.
In addition, I have ordered that henceforth DEA shall obtain
the prior approval of the Attorney General before conducting,
ox requesting anyone else to conduct, non-consensual elec-'
tronic surveillance outside the United States where the sub- |
ject of-the surveillancé is an American citizen or alien resi-

dent of the United States. Although the approval of the
Attorney General has not been required previously, as indi-
cated above there have apparently been no instances in
which an American citizen or resident has been the subject
of non~consensual electronic surveillance conducted abroad
by DEA or initiated at its request.

On occasion DEA has also conducted consensual elec-
tronic surveillance outside the United States, usually in-~
. Volving the use of a voice transmitter concealed on, an’
informant, a DEA agent, or a law enforcement officer of the
host country. Under DEBA's current policy, this transmitter
device is used with the specific approval and participation
of the foreign country. Again, in almost all cases, the
surveillance is actually condu: aw enforcement
official of the foreign country, rather than by DEA, and
DEA! s involvement is in general limited to supplying the
equipment necessary to conduct the surveillance. So far as
DEA can determine, no American citizen or alien resident of
the United States has been the subject of consensual elec-
tronic surveillance conducted abroad through use of this
device by DEA, of by a foreign country at DEA's request.

I have ordered that whenever practicable DEA shall
obtain the advance approval of the Assistant Attorney General
in charge of the Criminal Division, or Deputy Assistant At-
torney General of that Division, before conducting, or re~-
questing anyone else to conduct, consensual electronic sur-
veillance outside the United States where the subject of the
surveillance is an American citizen or alien resident of the
United States. .Where circumstances preclude a prior request
foy authorization, DEA may conduct the surveillance, but
shall notify promptly the Assistant Attorney General in charge
of the Criminal Division of the surveillance and the specific
conditions that precluded obtaining prior approval. This
procedure parallels that outlined in Attorney General Klein-
dienst's memorandum of October 16, 1972 governing consensual
electronic surveillance within the United States by federal
departments and agencies. It.applies, of course, only to

' ’
private conversations, other than telephone conversations,
that are sought to be monitored without the consent of
all the parties to that conversation. For the reasons
mentioned earlier, prior approval for consensual monitor-
ing of telephone ee is not required.

DEA has also used certain electronic devices abroad

-in order to track the location of drug shipments. These

devices do not transmit, overhear, or record private con-
versations, but rather merely emit signals which indicate
the | location of the device.

DEA's policy concerning electronic surveillance
has also been Gescribed in its séSsponse to your letter of
April 24 to Mr. Bartels. The remaining divisions, bureaus,
and agencies within the Department do not conduct electronic
surveillance of any kind outside the United States.

I trust that the information I have furnished will

_assist your subcommittee in its inquiry concerning the prac-
“tices and procedures of the federal agencies in the area of

electronic surveillance. ‘

The Honorable Edward M. Kennedy i
Chairman, Subcommittee on Administrative BEEEEE
Practice and Procedure

Committee on the Judiciary : eee a

Washington, D. C. 20510 ~ Belli ieosrepaae \ by.
Dear Senator Kennedy:

In my letter to you of May 2, I stated that the De-
partment was in the process of assembling the materials rele-
vant to your inquiry regarding electronic surveillance con-
ducted within the United States in the interests of national
security and foreign intelligence. Pursuant to a review of
this matter, I am able to provide you with the following in-
formation.

Since 1940 by directives of the President, the Attorney
General has been vested with responsibility over electronic
surveillance conducted within the United States in the inter~
ests of national security and foreign intelligence. This sur-
veillance is authorized pursuant to the personal approval of
the Attorney General, rather than by court order. Based on -
. an examination of the relevant precedents, it is the position :
of the Department of Justice that the Executive may conduct
electronic surveillance in the interests of national security
and foreign intelligence, and in aid of his conduct of the
nation's foreign affairs, without obtaining a judicial warrant.
“This has been the position of the Department of Justice for more
than three decades and is supported by historical practice as
‘well as judicial decision. The only two Courts of Appeals to
address the issue, the Third Circuit and‘the Fifth-Circuit, have
held that the warrant requirement of the Fourth Amendment does
not apply in the area of national security and foreign intelli- .
. . gence.and..that under. the. Constitution ..the President- has the-- - - -
authority ‘to conduct electronic surveillance without a court
order as part of his diplomatic and military or commander-in-
chief functions. See United States v. Butenko (Appeal of Ivanov) ,
494 F.2d 593 (3xd Cir. 1974) (en banc), cert. “denied sub nom.

“vatow v. United States 419 U.S. 881 (1974); Unite

Vv. Brown, 484 F.2d G18 (5th Cir. 1973), cert. d mied, 415
U.S. 960 (1974). In Title LII of the Omnibus Crime Control
and Safe Streets Act of 1968, Congress also explicitly dis-
claimed any attempt to place limitations on the President's
authority in this area. 18 U.S.C. § 2511(3). The Supreme
Court has, of course, expressly left open the question whether
the warrant requirement applies to electronic surveillance con-
ducted for national security and foreign intelligence pur-
poses. In United States v. United States District Court, 407
U.S. 297, 308-9 (1973), however, the Court, while holding that
the domestic security area was subject to the-warrant require-
ment, was careful to note that "the instant case requixes no
judgment with respect to the activities of foreign powers, with-
in or without this country. . . There is no evidence of any
involvement, directly or indirectly, of a.foreign power."" More-
over, in the .Butenko case, although the United States prevailed
in the Third Circuit, the Department acquiesced in the petition
for certiorari. Nevertheless, the Court denied certiorari,
thus leaving undisturbed the Third Circuit's decision upholding
the authority of the Executive to conduct electronic surveil-
lauce without~a court order ¥ nal security and foreign
intelligence is involved.

| Under the standards and procedures established by the
President, the personal approval of the Attorney General is re-~
quired before any non-consensual electronic surveillance may
be instituted within the United States without a judicial war-
rant. All requests for surveillance must be made in writing by

‘the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and must

set forth the relevant factual circumstances that justify the
proposed surveillance. Both the agency and the Presidential
appointee initiating the request must be identified. Requests
from.the Director are examined by a special review group which

I have established within the Office of the Attorney. General.
Authorization will not be granted unless the Attorney General
has satisfied himself that the requested electronic surveillance
is necessary for national security or foreign intelligence pur-

poses: important to national: security.

‘In addition, the Attorney General must be satisfied ‘that
the subject of the surveillance is either. assisting a foreign



- : |
oh.

power or foreign-based political group, or plans unlawful
activity directed against a foreign power or fioreign-based
political group. Finally, he must be satisfied that the

. minimum physical intrusion necessary to obtain the informa-
tion will be used.

All authorizations are for a period of ninety days or
less, and the specific approval of the Attorney General is
again required for continuation of the surveillance beyond
that period. The Attorney General has also been directed to
review all electronic, surveillance on a regular basis to en-
sure that the aforementioned criteria are satisfied. Pursu-
ant to the mandate of United States v. United States District
Court, electronic surveillance without a judicial warrant is
not conducted where there is no foreign involvement.

All electronic surveillance rélated to national security
and foreign intelligence within the United States is conducted
by the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The Bureau has estab-
lished strict internal review procedures with regard to all
electronic surveillance activities.

: The extent of telephone and microphone surveillance
H conducted within the United States in the interests of nation-
| al security and foreign intelligence was last disclosed in 1973.
On a comparable basis, the extent of such surveillance between
1969 and May 1975 is set forth in the attached memoranda. The
total number of subjects of telephone surveillance during that
period is as follows: 1969, 113; 1970, 90; 1971, 87;:1972, 102;
1973, 116; 1974, 148. These Eigures do not, of course, indicate
the number of persons whose conversations were intercepted,, but
xather only the number of subjects to whom the surveillance was
directed. The total number of subjects of microphone surveillance
| during that period was as follows: 1969, 14; 1970, 19; 1971, 16;
| 1972, 31; 1973, 38; 1974, 32. Again, these figures do not in-
dicate. the number of persons whose conversations were inter-
cepted, but rather the number of subjects to whom the sur-
veillance was directed. _ Moreover, I should further note that .
the above figures are duplicative to an extent since in several
_ cases the same subject was under, both telephone and microphone
Surveillance. :

f “the total installations of telephone and microphone sur-
veillances during the above periods would, of | course, exceed

| w.65360_Noctd:32980614 Page 51 :

these figures by varying margins. On « occasion, the ‘sub-

ject under surveillance moved to a new ceasiony thus nec-
essitating a re-*nstallation of the surveillance at the new
address. On other occasions, the surveillance was discon-

tinued because the subject left the premises for an extended
period, but was later re-instituted when the subject returned.

In still other cases, the surveillance was discontinued for a
period as part of the Department's continuing review and re-
“ evaluation of all electronic surveillance activities. The 7
subsequent re-institution of the surveillance pursuant to a
new approval by the Attorney General would be counted as an
additional installation. For the above reasons, the number

of installations of telephone and microphone surveillances ‘is
greater than the number of subjects of such surveillance, and
would thus not provide an accurate basis’ for evaluating the
extent of electronic surveillance. Nevertheless, pursuant to
your inquiry, I am including in the attached memoranda the total
number of installations of electronic surveillance devices for
both telephone and microphones.

T am also enclosing the maximum_and minimum number oF

telephone and microphone surveillances installed and in opera-

tion for each month between November 1972 and April 1975. These
figures are based on data compiled on a daily basis and reflect
installations and discontinuances of electronic surveillance de-

vices. The. records of daily counts were initiated in November

1972. Comparable information is not available for-prior periods.

As these figures indicate, the maximum number of telephone sur-
veillances in operation at any time during 1973 was 93; the

minimum number in operation that year was 65. The maximum

number of microphone surveillances in operation during 1973

was 22; the minimum was 10. In 1974, the maximum number of
telephone surveillances in operation was 106; the minimum num-

ber in operation was 75. Microphone surveillances in operation

‘during that period ranged from a maximum of 21 to a minimum of

10. During the first four and a half'’months of 1975, the maxi-

mum number of telephone .surveillances in operation at any time

-was-91; the minimum was 67. The, maximum number of microphone
gurveillances in operation at any time during that period was

20; the minimum was 9. On April 1, 1975, there were 75 tele- :
phone and 15 microphone “surveillances in operation. :
I trust that the information supplied to date is ‘of

assistance to your subcommittee in its inquiry ‘into the prac-

NOTE:

Reference is made to Legal Counsel memoranda to

Mr. J. B. Adams dated 5/23/75 and 6/12/75 which set out the
request upon which this response is predicated. The statistics
regarding the categories of mail covers noted in this memorandum
were derived by a review of each 3 x 5 card maintained by

im the Special Records and Related Research (SRRR) Unit
on requested mail covers. These cards are maintained
alphabetically by each field office. They are not broken
down by either type of mail covers or by the categories in
which they are presented in this memorandum. To obtain the
statistics set out in this memorandum it was necessary to
duplicate all the records, categorize by the three types,
of mail covers and then subdivide the national security
mail covers into general categories. The data contained on
each card includes; subject, file number, time period, address,
and brief characterization. In some instances supervisors
within the INTD who were familar with the subjects were con-
tacted to obtain information necessary to categorize.

As explained in the memorandum, this record was
kept in-house for count purposes only and therefore required
time to reassemble the data in the form presented.

It should be noted this record may not contain

every mail cover utilized by the FBI within the time period
the system is designed to cover. This is because the assembly
of this data is dependent upon notification by the substantive
ease supervisor and it is possible such notification has been
inadvertantly omited on a particular case. This qualification
is made to advise as to the limitation of the documents upon
which the memorandum is based.

Preparation of this memorandum was coordinated
with Mr. John Russell, General Investigative, and John McHale,
Special Investigative, as to whether these Division's possess
records beyond those maintained within INTD. It was determined
that they did not.

On June 11, 1975, Mike Shaheen of the Department,
who is working with K. William O'Connor in handling responses
to the captioned Committee, informed Special Agent Paul V. Daly
at 5:30 p.m. that we should respond to the request concerning

was received jy Deputy Attorney General, Harold R. Tyler.

ri

Tyler distinguished this postal request from others
by Stating that inasmuch as the Committee Chairman had
authorized the Committee to inquire concerning mail covers

in a letter to U. S. Postal Services, it should not be
necessary for them to write a subsequent letter.

The requests to the Department were conveyed to
the Section Chief of the Intelligence Division, W. 0. Cregar,
on June 11, 1975.

That the Intelligence Division expeditiously prepare

hereby request that a complete, unexcised set of the A through E

As stated in the notification, the Committee's

requests for information and documents. It is impossible
to use the excised version of the summaries for this
purpose.

Since a thorough analysis of the summaries
requires that the volumes be disassembled, and since
they must be available to staff members working evenings

Dear Mr. O'Connor:

The purpose of this letter is to set down in
one place the present status of the responses to the
Committee's requests regarding notional organizations.

Your letter of June 12, 1975, transmitted only
one memorandum in response to Appendix C, Part III, Item 24,
of the Committee's May 14, 1975 request. We would appreciate
your advice whether any additional matorials oxist which arc
responsive to this portion of our request, and, if so; when
they will be supplied.

With respect to your duly 7, 1975 response to
Appendix C, Part III, Items 25 (a) and (b), we will need to
examine all of the materials which provided the basis for
the preparation of the Bureau's July 2, 1975 summary. In
addition, we will need to examine the materials which were
summarized in Item 2 under the heading "Types of Activity"
in the "Exhibit K" attachment to the so-called Peterson
Committee report, which I examined on July 8, 1975.

I would like to assure you that pursuant to your
request, we have seriously considered the Bureau's suggestion
for an oral briefing on this subject. We have concluded,
however, that such a procedure would be helpful only after
we have had the opportunity to study the requested materials
which bear upon this subject. I might add that in view of
the sensitivity of some of this material, we would certainly
be willing to review at FBI Headquarters whichever of the
ments pertain to sensitive ongoing Bureau operations.

procedures, and legal authority questions regarding the us
of this technique in connection with intelligence, counter-

Director Sec'y

At 2:50 p.m. on July 10, 1975, K. William O’Connor A OF 6 hee
called me and advised that Douglas Marvin, Special Assistant to the
Attorney General, has requested a briefing for the Attorney General
regarding the status of responses to inquiries by the Senate Select
Committee. He said that the briefing would be scheduled for the
afternoon of Tuesday, July 15, 1975, if possible. The briefing will
prepare the Attorney General for his appearance before the Senate Select
Committee during the latter part of that week to discuss the status of
responses. It is noted that we have received a written request from the
Committee for the Director and the Attorney General to appear to discuss
this matter in Executive Session.

In anticipation of such a request from the Attorney General,
we have caused a review to be undertaken and a status report prepared
as to all Bureau responses to Senate Select Committee inquiries plus a ‘ep ort
as to items actually delivered to the Committee. The distinction is that,
some materials prepared by the Bureau were delivered to the Department .
and have not been forwarded to the Committee. -

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. That the Intelligence Division expedite preparation of th:

status report for information of the Director and to prepare for briefin,
the Attorney General in the afternoon of July 15, 1975.

to alleviate possible problems in preparing the responses.
Responses to many of the questions asked have been prepared,

amount of work to be done. rat
Letter dated May 27, 1975, contained a request that
FBI documents in the custody of National Archives concerning,
“the Warren Commission be made available to the Committee for
review. We have furnished a response to this request.

By letter dated May 28, 1975, the Committee requested
that certain Senators on the Select Committee be given access
to any information concerning them in FBI files. This request
is being handled using the same guidelines as Freedom of Information
“Act requests and material is being gathered. The epeanbennenis
has written a letter to the Committee regarding this request,

Attached are one copy each of two letters to A ae NS
captioned sources from Senator JOHN G. TOWER and CHARLES fy
KIRBOW, both dated 6/20/75. :

The documents enclosed in KIRBOW's letter were
copies of JOHN CREWDSON's original "New York Times" article
of 2/16/75 and the 3/6/75 article of "WIN" magazine. The
Bureau is in possession of both of these articles.

Both SCHAFERS felt reassured by the expressions and
tone of the attached letters, enough to be willing to again
travel to Washington, D.C. on 6/28/75.

On 7/1/75, the SCHAFERS advised that they had
traveled to Washington, D.C., on Saturday, 6/28/75, and
were interviewed in private by KIRBOW and MICHAEL EPSTEIN,
both staff members of the Senate Select Committee to Study
Governmental Operations with Respect to Intelligence
Activities. It was a short interview wherein KIRBOW solicited
the general unsworn statements. of the SCHAFERS regarding the | |
allegations against the FBI of JOE BURTON. KIRBOW stated that
he believed BURTON was a fool and was probably motivated by
self interest in his allegations. After hearing the SCHAFERS'
general statements contradictory to BURTON's allegations, —§~
KIRBOW said that they confirm his impression of BURTON. The
SCHAFERS were important to the Committee's inquiries in
characterizing BURTON, according to KIRBOW. The SCHAFERS
did not go into detail regarding their radical activities
or: relationship with the FBI. 7

KIRBOW said the SCHAFERS' statements would remain
confidential and would not be leaked to the press. KIRBOW

. said he did not expect the SCHAFERS to be asked or subpoenaed

to testify openly before the full Committee.

designed, however, to refute allegations made against the FBI

by former Tampa informant Joe Burton. Kirbow also questioned the
Schafers regarding the Bureau's administrative procedures

relative to the handling of New Left informants.

As a matter of courtesy, the Schafers desire to furnish

will mail a detailed letter to the Director, FBI Headquarters.

The purpose of this memorandum is to request
the attached basic statement of the Rights and Obliga-
tions of current and former employees be approved
and be furnished to both current and former employees

prior to interview and/or testimony before captioned
Committee.

The intelligence agencies under review by this
Committee are attempting to establish guidelines with
captioned Committee allowing agency representatives to be
present during certain interviews. These guidelines have
not as yet been approved. Our current procedure has been
to brief current and former employees concerning their rights
and obligations prior to interview if they so desire. We
have also made available a Bureau representative to accompany
these individuals to an interview if requested. We feel
that, in addition to the general briefing of current and : a
former employees, they should be furnished a copy of the AP |
attached basic statement of the employees Rights and Ob- f Pall
ligations, which may be taken with them during interview
or giving of testimony. This attachment will allow the
employees to have a document to which they might refer
if a matter arises wherein they have some question as to
whether they should respond to a particular question.

EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT

As consideration for employment in the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), United
States Department of Justice, and as a condition for continued employment, I hereby declare
that I intend to be governed by and I will comply with the following provisions:

(1) That I am hereby advised and I understand that Federal law such as
Title 18, United States Code, Sections 793, 794, and 798; Order of the
President of the United States (Executive Order 11652); and regulations
issued by the Attorney General of the United States (28 Code of Federal
Regulations, Sections 16.21 through 16.26) prohibit loss, misuse, or un-
authorized disclosure or production of national security information, other
classified information and other nonclassified information in the files of
the FBI;

(2) [understand that unauthorized disclosure of information in the files

of the FBI or information I may acquire as an employee of the FBI could
result in impairment of national security, place human life in jeopardy, or
result in the denial of due process to a person or persons who are subjects
of an FBI investigation, or prevent the FBI from effectively discharging its
responsibilities. I understand the need for this secrecy agreement; there-
fore, as consideration for employment I agree that I will never divulge,
publish, or reveal either by word or conduct, or by other means disclose to
any unauthorized recipient without official written authorization by the
Director of the FBI or his delegate, any information from the investigatory
files of the FBI or any information relating to material contained in the files,
or disclose any information or produce any material acquired as a part of the
performance of my official duties or because of my official status. The burden
is on me to determine, prior to disclosure, whether information may be disclosed
and in this regard I agree to request approval of the Director of the FBI in each

* such instance by presenting the full text of my proposed disclosure in writing to
the Director of the FBI at least thirty (30) days prior to disclosure. I understand
that this agreement is not intended to apply to information which has been placed
in the public domain or to prevent me from writing or speaking about the FBI but
it is intended to prevent disclosure of information where disclosure would be +
contrary to law, regulation or public policy. I agree the Director of the FBI is
in a better position than I to make that determination;

(3) I agree that all information acquired by me in connection with my official
duties with the FBI and all official material to which I have access remains
the property of the United States of America, and I will surrender upon demand
by the Director of the FBI or his delegate, or upon separation from the FBI, any
material relating to such information or property in my possession;

(4) That I understand unauthorized disclosure may be a violation of Federal
law and prosecuted as a criminal offense and in addition to this agreement may
be enforced by means of an injunction or other civil remedy.
I accept the above provisions as conditions for my employment and continued employment

in the FBI. I agree to comply with these provisions both during my employment in the FBI and
following termination of such employment.

OPFICE OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL
WASHINGTON, D.C,

soe May 15, 1956
siege T ORDER NO. 116-56
os It is the policy of the Department of Justice to extend the fullest

possible cooperation to congressional committees requesting information from
departmental files, interviews with department employees, testimony of depart-
ment personnel, or testimony of Federal prisoners. The following procedures
are prescribed in order to effectuate this policy on a basis which will be
mutually satisfactory to the congressional committees and to the Department.
{This order supersedes the Deputy Attorney General's Memorandum No. 5, dated
Merch 23, 1953, and his Memorandum No. 97, dated August 5, 1954. It forml- . | ¢
izes the Attorney General's press release of November 5, 1953, establishing °
procedures to permit committees of the Congress and their authorized repre-
sentatives to interview and to take sworn testimony from Federal prisoners.

It supplements Order No. 3229 (Revised) dated January 13, 1953, and Order

No. 3464, Supplement No. 4 (Revised) dated January 13, 1953 (with Memorandum
of "Authorization Under Order No. 3464 Supplement No. 4 (Revised)" dated
January 13, 1953), insofar as said orders have reference to procedures to be
followed in the Department's relations with congressional committees. In
support of this order, reference should be had to the President's letter

dated May 17, 1954, addressed to the Secretary of Defense, and to the Attorney
General's Memorandum which accompanied it.]

A. REQUESTS FOR INFORMATION FROM DEPARTMENT FILES

1. Congressional committee requests for the examination of files
or other confidential information should be reduced to writing, signed by
the chairman of the committee, and addressed to the Deputy Attorney General,
who is responsible for the coordination of our liaison with Congress and
congressional committees. The request shall state the specific information
sought as well as the specific objective for which it is sought. The Deputy
Attorney General will forward the request to the appropriate division where a
reply will be prepared and returned for the Deputy Attorney General's signa-
ture and dispatch to the chairman of the committee.

2. If the request concerns a closed case, i. e., ofie in which
there is no litigation or administrative action pending or contemplated,
the file may be made available for review in the Department, in the presence
of the official or employee having custody thereof. The following procedure
shall be followed in such cases:

a. The reply letter will advise the committee that the
file is available for examination and set forth the
name, telephone extension number, and room number of
the person who will have custody of the file to be
reviewed;

NW 65360 Docld:32989614 Page 122



» | o

vb. Before making the file available to the committee
representative all reports and memoranda from the FBI
as well as investigative reports from any other agency,
will be removed from the file and not be made available _
for examination; provided however that if the committee
representative states that it is essential that information
from the FBI reports and memorands be made available,
he will be advised that the request will be considered

| by the Department. Thereafter a summary of the contents

: of the FBI reports and memoranda involved will be
prepared which will not disclose investigative tech-
niques, the identity of confidential informants, or
other. matters which might jeopardize the investigative
operations of the FBI, This summary will be forwarded
by the division to the FBI with a request for advice as
to whether the FBI has any objection to examination of
such summary by the committee representative. The file
will not be physically relinquished from the custody of
the Department. If the committee representative desires
to’ examine investigative reports from other government |
agenciés, contained in the files of the Department, he
will be advised to direct his request to the agency whose
reports are concerned.

3. If the request concerns an open case, 1. e., one which liti-
gation or administrative action is pending or contemplated, the file may
not be made available for examination by the committee's representative.
The following procedure shall be followed:

a. The reply letter should advise the committee that
its request concerns a case in which litigation or
administrative action is pending or contemplated, and
state that the file cannot be made available until the
case is completed; and

b. Should briefly set forth the status of the case in
as much detail as is practicable and prudent without
jeopardizing the pending contemplated litigation or

) administrative action.

B. REQUESTS FOR INTERVIEWS WITH DEPARTMENTAL PERSONNEL

1. Requests for interviews with departmental personnel regarding
any official matters within the Department should be reduced to writing,
signed by the chairman of the committee, and addressed to the Deputy Attorney
General. When the approval of the Deputy Attorney General is given, the
employee is expected to discuss such matters freely and cooperatively with
the representative, subject to the limitations prescribed in A respecting
open cases and data in investigative reports;

NW 65360 Docld:32989614 Page 123



- - 4

2. Upon the tbinpletion of the interview with the committee repre-
sentative the employee will prepare a summary of it for the file, with a
copy routed to his division head and a copy routed to the Deputy Attorney
General.

C. EMPLOYEES TESTIFYING BEFORE CONGRESSIONAL COMMITTEES

1. When an employee is requested to testify before a congressional
committee regarding official matters within the Department the Deputy Attormey
General shall be promptly informed. When the Deputy Attorney General's approv-
al is given the employee is expected to testify freely subject to limitations
prescribed in A respecting open cases and data in investigative reports;

2. An employee subpoenaed to testify before a congressional committee
on official matters within the Department shall promptly notify the Deputy
Attorney General. In general he shall be guided in testifying by Order 3229
(Revised) and the President's letter of May 17 » 1954, cited at the beginning
of this Order. 7

3. Upon the completion of his testimony the employee will prepare
& memorandum outlining his testimony with a copy routed to his division head
and a copy routed to the Deputy Attorney General.

D. REQUESTS OF CONGRESSIONAL COMMITTEES FOR THE TESTIMONY OF FEDERAL PRISONERS

Because of the custodial hazards involved and the extent to which
their public testimony may affect the discipline and well-being of the institu-
tion, it is the policy of the Department not to deliver Federal prisoners out-
side the penal institution in which they are incarcerated for the purpose of
being interviewed or examined under oath by congressional committees. However,
when it appears that no pending investigation or legal proceeding will be
adversely affected thereby and that the public interest will not be otherwise
adversely affected, Federal prisoners may be interviewed or examined under oath
by congressional committees in the institution in which they are incarcerated
under the following procedures, and with the specific advance approval of the
Deputy Attorney General.

1. Arrangements for interviewing and taking of sworn testimony
from a Federal prisoner by a committee of the Congress or the authorized
representatives of such a committee shall be made in the form of a written
request by the chairman of the committee to the Deputy Attorney General.

2. Such written request shall be made at least ten (10) days
prior to the requested date for the interview and the taking of testimony
and shall be accompanied by written evidence that authorization for the
interview or the taking of sworn testimony was approved by vote of the com-
mittee. Such request shall contain a statement of the purpose and the sub-
jects upon which the prisoner will be interrogated as well as the names of
all persons other than the representatives of the Department of Justice who
will be present.

3. A member of the interested committee of the Congress shall be
present during the entire time of the interrogation.

NW 65360 Docld:32989614 Page 124



4, The warden of the penal institution in which the Federal
prisoner is incarcerated shall, at least forty-eight (48) hours prior to the
time at which the interview takes place, advise the Federal. prisoner concerned
of the proposed interview or taking of sworn testimony; and shall further

: advise that he is under the same, but no greater obligation to answer than any
i other witness who is not a prisoner.

Panel

5. The warden of the penal institution shall have complete
authority in conformity with the requirements of security and the mainte-
nance of discipline to limit the number of persons who will be present at
the interview and taking of testimony.

6. The warden or his authorized representative shall be present
at the interview and at the taking of testimony and the Department of Justice
shall have the right to have one of its representatives present throughout
the interview and taking of testimony.

7. The committee shall arrange to have a stenographic transcript
made of the entire proceedings at committee expense and shall furnish a copy
of the transcript to the Department of Justice.

E, OBSERVERS IN ATTENDANCE AT COMMITTEE HEARINGS

In order that the Department may be kept currently advised in
matters within its responsibility, and in order that the Deputy Attorney
General may properly coordinate the Department's liaison with Congress and
its committees, each division that has an observer in attendance at a
congrssional hearing, will have the observer prepare a written summary of
the proceeding which should be sent to the division head and a copy routed
to the Deputy Attorney General.

Bergeron was contacted by SSC Staff Member
Michael Epstein, who asked to interview Bergeron at

relating to possible identification of FBI sources and
possibly affecting ongoing investigations. On June 27, 1975,

SETATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (ssc)

RE: INTERVIEW OF RETIRED FBI SA BY SSC

by an FBI representative who made himself available for
possible consultation purposes but this representative was
never called upon during the interview.

Bergeron was interviewed in SSC quarters for the
approximate period of 10:20 a.m, to 11:20 a.m, June 27, 1975,
The interview was to have commenced at 10:00 a.m, but
Epstein devoted approximately 20 minutes arranging for
adequate space for the interview. In addition to Mpstein,
another Staff Member, Mary ReOreo, was present. She took
netes in longhand throughout the interview and also partici-
pated in some of the questioning to a small degree, At the
outset, Bergeron was advised of his right to counsel and
other rights and told that if he gave any information
indicating a possible violation of Federal lav, his information
would be turned over to the Department of Justice. The
interview vas not under cath and was not pursuant to a
subpoena. ‘The details of the interview are set out below,
not necessarily in chronological order.

Bergeron was asked for biographic data insofar as
his FBI career was concerned and he advised that he had
entered the FBI in a ¢lerical capacity in 1940 and was
assigned to the Washington Field Office (0) of the PBI
from October, 1942, until his retirement in September, 1965,
almost the entire period as an SA,

Bergeron was questioned and furnished information
about the organization of WFO, principally relating to the
squads engaged in security work. He was asked to identify
supervisory and other personnel attached to the various
security squads when he vorked in WFO and in most instanecs
his replies vere that due to time lapse he was unable to

furnish specifie names. He pointed out that if there was
made available to him the various personnel directories
of WFO down through the years he might better be able to
respond to such inquiries.

- Questioning turned to the FBI investigation of
Martin luther King, Jr., and specifically to electronic
coverage of King at the Willard Hotel in Washington, D. C.,
in the mid-1960's. He was asked how this coverage came
about and responded that he vas called Into the office of
the Security Coordinator in WFO, fiudwig V. R. Oberndorf
(deceased), Present were an FBI Assistant Director, William C,
Sullivan, 5A William Welch (deceased) and two te four other
WO SAs, names not now recalled. This conference was led
by Sullivan, who explained that King and some of his
associates vere coming to Washington, D. C., and that the
Bureau desired to effect technical coverage on King. It
vas Sullivan's information that King had spent time in
Mew York City and had been discovered to have a number of
communist contacts there, Because of these contacts, the
FBI interest in King was a national seeurity matter, according
to Sullivan.

Bergeron was asked whether Sullivan mentioned
the specific types of coverage desized and Bergeron could
not recall beyond the generie description of technical,
Bergeron expleined that SA Welch vas present because he was
the | hotel contact man for WFO. It was assumed that because
King was coming to Washington, D. C., with several other :
individuals, they would probably stay at a hotel rather than
in someone's home, It was therefore believed desirable to
utilize the help of an SA who had contacts with the various
hotels,

&fter it was determined that King and his party

vere to stay at the Willard Hotel, Bergeron was taken there

by Welch and introduced to one of the Willerd's staf€, name
not recalled, Bergeron was then shown rooms similar to

the ones which had been reserved for King and his party,

This was part of the feasibility survey which Bergeron .
performed to determine whether it would be feasible to make

a technical installation, Bergeron being a trained "sound man,"

Bergeron vas queried as to vho mace the decision
as to the exact types of coverage to be put in effect and
Bergeron replied that he himself made that decision. He was
asked if there was office correspondence authorizing an
installation and Bergeron responded that thore vas--that he
alvays insisted that there be when he made an installation.
Bergeron explained that the authorization could have been
either of tuo types. The Bureau letter might have authorized
only a feasibility survey; or it might have authorized both
feasibility survey and installation. Bergeron said that he
had seen whatever paper there was containing the authorization
even though such correspondence would be addressed to the
Special Agent in Charge (AG), He explained the routing of
such mail whereby the SAC would route it to the appropriate
supervisor and then to the S.\ who was to make the installation,

In response to general questioning, Bergeron
advised that electronic surveillances might start in two
different ways. One would be when a field office would
originate the correspondence and the other would be when FBI
Headquarters would originate the correspondence,

Im response to questions concerning the type and

nature of the installation, Bexgeron made at the Willard Hotel,
he advised that he had placed a transmitter in each of tuo :

lamps and then through the hotel contact, it was arranged

to have the housekeeper change the lamps in tvo rooms which
had “been set aside for King and his party. This vas

handled in this matter in order to afford ma:zrimum sceurlty.-
to the operation and avoid, if possible, any suspicion among
employees of the hotel which might have been then transmitted
to the King party. :

Bergeron vas asked whether any telephone surveillance
vas instalicd and he roplicd that nono had baou made in the
Willard Hotel, Bergeron covld not veeall whether or not
the Bureau had asked for such a surveillance. In any event,
Bergeron explained that such a surveillance would have been
too complicated because of the presence of a switchboard at
the hotel, Bergeron was asked whether he could have used
switehboard operators to assist im such a surveillance and
his response was "no." Lergeron was noxt asked if he had
ever put a telephone curvelllanea in any hotel room and he
eesponded, “Lo you scan in the King ease?" Upstein then
asked if Bergeron had made sueh an installation in any case
and Bergeron advised Cpstein that he vas cleared to discuss
only the King case.

Questioning then turned to the matter of the
monitoring of the nlerophone suevelllance vinlch he had
installed. Pergexon explained that they required tve rooms
for such monitoring and that there were utilized in these
rooms radio receivers and tape recorders, Upon request,
Bergeron gave the name of Bill Campbell as one of the SAs
doing the monitoring and said there was another SA, name
unvecalled, Bergeron indicated that he himself Listened
to very Little of the transmissions; only cnouch to tast
the efficiency of tha transmissions. Bergeron was asked 1f
he had seen any of the logs which were made and he replied



) )

SENATE SELECT COMMETIBE ON INTSLLIGEMCH ACTIVITIES (ssc)
RE: TNTERVIE OF RETIRED FBI SA BY SSC

that he probably had but did not recall any of the contents.
Bergeron advised that he probably saw transcripts of the
monitoring but again cowid not recall any of the contents.
He was questioned as to what happened to the logs and
transeripts and replied that he assumed that they had been
sent to FBI Headquarters, As to the tapes themselves,
Bergeron indicated he had no idea of what disposition was
made of them,

Bergeron was asked if WFO had a file on King
prior to the situation deseribed above and he advised he
had no knowledge on that matter,

He was asked if he knew of any other similar
coverage on King in other places and his response was that
any affirmative answer he might give would be mere hearsay.

Epstein inquired of Bergeron as to who he had
talked to after Epstein first called him to arrange the
interview. Bergeron teld Epstein that he had talked to
another FBI SA, Ernest Belter (previously interviewed by SSC
Staff). Epstein inquired as to why Bergeron had contacted
Belter and Bergeron told Epstein that he did it for the
purpose of thanking Belter for "small favors" because Belter
had supplied Bergeron'’s name to Epstein. Bergeron also
explained that he called Belter, who he had learned had
already been interviewed by the SSC, to find out who he,
Bergeron, shovld talk to in the Bureau about any forthcoming
interview.

In response to questioning, Bergeron told Epstein
that earlier that morning he had seen FBI Assistant Director
John Mintz and SA Willinm 0. Grepar in connection with
obtaining the necessary clearance prior to being interviewed.

RE: TWERVIEN OF SCTIRhp PBI SA BY ssc

He vas asked if they had discussed the King ease with hin
and he responded that they had not. He was asked if he

had reviewed any FBI files prier te the interview and he
responded that he had not. He vas asked 2£ any files vere
offered to him and he responded that none had: been offered
him, He vas asked whether he had requested an opportunity
to review FBI files and he replied that he had not made any
such gequest, Miss DeOreo then asked Bergeron if it was his
decision to not look at FBI files to refresh his memory
prior to the interview. He responded by advising that he
no longer vorked for the FBI and therefore believed he had
no cight to review FRE files.

Questioning then turned te the matter of photographic
coverage of King at the Willard Hotel and in response to a
direct question, Bergeron advised there was no such coverage,
He was asked whether any "surreptitious coverage" was
utilized and his cesponse was that nona had been used. He
was questioned concerning possible use of TV coverage and
responded that none was used, Bergeron explained that they
were talking about a period over 10 years ago when such
equipment vas not nearly ag well developed as it is today.

When it appeared that the interview vas concluded,
Bergeron inquired as to whether the interviewers vere
"Etnished" with him, Ipstein indicated that they were not
and that they would probably call him back again because of
Bergeron's “broad general knowledge of intelligence activities."
Bergeron disclaimed such knowledge.

NOTE: :
Bergeron was accompanied to the interview by
SAS. F. Phillips of the Senstudy 75 Project, who also
debriefed Bergeron as reported herein. The advice given to
Bergeron prior to the interview concerning being released

from employment agreement was by Assistant Director Mintz.

A SUBJECT: SSC Notification of: June 273 CORN

a Attached is a request for further detailed information from
el Senate Select Committee, regarding” COENTELPRO, from Mr. ELMiff dated
duly 1, 1975. :

“Please note that tigis matter is considered and characterized
as an "abuse" (see page 21 of enclosures to SSC letter of- dune 27, ~~“
previously forwarded); accordingly, any Agent interview would be an iE:
“abuse interview" subject to the strictures set forth in the "Outline".
for Inquiry’ Procedures" referenced in the SSC letter of dime 27. =”
Bécause of this, I feel we showld discuss the procedures for inter-

. view which may be sought under page’ 2, paragraph "Interviews" of
Mr. Elliff's attached letter. It may be that the matter should be
discussed with the Deputy Attorney General as well, after Mr. Levi
has responded to the SSC letter of June 27. A significant legal
problem may be presented by the compulsion of Agents' appearance.
Please also note the attached Departmental decision on the interpre-
tation of "demand" in 28 C.F.R., 16.21 et. seq. This decision will

bear on our resolution of the pending er Legal peoples ; -

Action Memorandi

‘+ fhe meaning of "gemana" is not, indicated, beyond stibpoena, in
the C.F.R. sections inficated. This omission creates a need for an
interpretation, for purposes of Ce Department of Justice reaction.

Outlines for inquiry a were agreed upon between the
White House and the Senate Select Committee on June 13, 1975, anda
eopy of those procedures ws furnished to the Department on June 16,
1975. Under those guidelines, there is a general undertaking by the
Committee to identify witnesses to the Agency a reasonable time before
the interviews occur. This general rule includes current and former
employees; certain exceptions (not clearly defined) are indicated in
the guidelines. ‘The Committee is required to provide the witness with
@ copy of the procedures, and “relevant waivers of secrecy oaths or
agreements for the purpose of this inquiry". ‘The Committee is required
to give prior notice of an interview, generally, specifying: (a) sub-

Since these structured procedures, taken with the rules of the
Subcommittee, may create a requirement of testimony upon witnesses, it
seems to me clear that the paragraphs of 28 C.F.R., § 16.21, et. sea.,
which refer to "demand" should be interpreted to include any request
by any Committee staff member to interview any employee, former employee
or other person connected el the’ Department of Justice.

This interpretation requires certain action: (1) that the wit-
ness be authorized to speak under § 16.23 by an appropriate Department
Official; and, (2) that an appropriate Department Official be designated.
I would think that the appropriate Department Official for the FBI should]
be the Director of the FBI or the FBI General Counsel, in coordination
with this office.

NOTE:

The 6/24/75 SSC letter made reference to prior SSC
request pertaining to the FBI investigation of Martin Luther King,
Je., and indicated that of the persons listed in the letter,
with only two exceptions (Larry Gurley and William D. Campbell),
all were believed to have served at either Atlanta or Albany,
Georgia, with the FBI. Gurley and Campbell were understood
to have been assigned to FBIHQ. In attempting to identify
correctly the individuals listed because of misspellings of
names, we ran down the fact that with the exception of Gurley
and Campbell, ali had at one time served in the Atlanta Field
Office except for a John Bassett. The only current or
former Agent by this name is assigned to Chicago and has never

rechecked with Mike Epstein of the SSC Staff who advised that

the John Bassett in Chicago is the correct one. S. F. Phillips
of the Senstudy 75 Project telephonically contacted Bassett
6/26/75 and determined Bassett not only has never been assigned

to Atlanta but he has no recollection of having ever worked on
the King case. Notwithstanding, we are including Bassett's current
office of assignment as requested, even though we currently do
not know specifically why the SSC is considering interviewing him.

Subcommittee on Civil and Constitutional Rights ‘
of the House Committee on the Judiciary :

if ‘Responses to the aforementioned questions are set
\ forth below and appear in the same order as posed.

1. The FBI conducts surveiliances of demonstrations
occurring on or near Federal property; at otner locations
whon facts indicate a violation of Federal statutes over
which the Tji has investigative jurisdiction may occur; or
at a site where individuais of investigative interest to
the FBI are present or the demonstration is sponsored by
an organization of investigative interest. in this instance,
the FEI had received information frem a source, who hag
provided reliable information in the past, that an organiza-
tion of investigative interest to the FLI would be attempting
to gain publicity by entering the Federal Building in Akron,
ereating disturbances and defacing Federal property. This
| organization has been determined to be influenced by a
. separate organization which espuuses a basic Narnigt<=
| Leninist-Hacist revolutionsry ideology. Investigation of

both of these organizations is based on information which
indicates they may be engaged in activities which could
dnvolve violations of Titis 18, Uni ted States Code >
Sections wsss (iepsizion or Insurresiion}), 2554 (Seditions
Conspiracy), 2385 (Advocating Overthrow of Government), and
_ 2887 (Seditien). in addition, inasmuch as the possibility
existed individuals present at the demonstration would
attempt to deface Federal preperty, there was reason to
believe a violation of Title 18, United States Code,
Section 1361 (Destruction of Government Property) could occur,
At a later date, additional information was received from a
second source, who has provided reliable information in the
past, that the demonstration at the Federal Building in Akron
would he to protest United States involvement in Southeast
Asia, and lenficts urging support of this demonstration were
being distributed in tha . Akron-Kent, Ohioe, aren. In
keeping with existing FRI policy, the Akvon Police Department
and the Generali Services Administration Building Manager in
charges of the Akron Federal Building were notificd of the
impending demonstration and of information received indicating
B possibility that disruptive activity would occur quring
the dewonstration. -

Subcommittee on Civil and Constitutional Rights
of the House Committee on the Judiciary

Surveiliance in this case was not related to any
bomb threat; however, based on the information stated above,
theve was Yeason fcr the FB to suspect that there might be
violations of Federal statutes ever which the FSI has investi-
gative jurisdiction. In the event such violations did oceur,
it would be necessary that Agents be present to gather the
necessary evidence.

The FBT did have an interest relating to the
identities of the particular individualg who were involved
in organizing the demonstvation. One such individual, who
played 2 key Yole in plans to cause disruptive activity and
in organizing the demonstfaticn, has been arrested and. :
convicted tor abuse to a police officer, tesisting arrest, | poe
discrdexly conduct, trespassing, and disrupting Qawfal
assembly in the past and has been deseribed by a sources,
whe has rrovided reliable infcfmaticn in the past,
to haye indicated in the past a desive to "get something
going vith the police." This samo individual is also
considered by the source to he unstable and violence-prone.
In addition. the individuais planning the demonstration,
as previously mentioned, were affiliated with an organiza-
tion which follows a Yevelutionary ideology.

2, There were no known violations of Federal or
local statutes during the demonst¥ation; there was no violenne;
and theve were no arrests aS a Fesult of the demonstratica.
Both visual and photographic surveillances were conducted by
the FSi during the detonstvation. Cusrent FRI instructions
state that photographic surveillances should be considered on
& selective basis when cixcumstanees indicate they may be
productive, The decision-making authority in such a‘ matter -
4s vested in the Special Agent in Charge of the particnise
headquarters field office cf the EBL, his assistant in his

“absence, of the Agent supervisor acting on their behalg in

the absence of both. In the event unusual circumstances
exist, the Special Agent in Chavge of a particular ficld
office would request authority from FDI Headquarters in
Washingten, D, C., to conduct a photorraphic survoillances,
Photographs were taken for the possible evidentiary purpcse of
recording anticipated events leading to the perpetyation of an
act by one er more demonstrators in violation of the Federal
Statute concerning destruction of Government property, as well
as recording on fiim any overt act. FBI Agents cbsetved the
demonstration for the same.reason and for the additional purpcs

of effecting, if necessary, the arrests of individuals vininging

Federal statutes.

Subcommittee on Civil and Constitutional Rights

Both prints and negatives of photographs taken by
the FEI have been maintained, from the time processed, as
exhibits in records of the FBI's Cleveland Office. The
film was developed because, among the approximately 15
denonstrators present outsice the Akron Federal Buliding,
Agents recognized five individuais known to be affiliated
with tho organization in which the TBI had investigative
interest. in tha event photographs depicting these individuals
were of petter quality than existing photographs, the improved
ones would be, in accordance with Fini policy and in lines with
an agreement between the FRI and the Secret Service concerning —
Presidential protection, forwarded to the Secret Service for
possible future use by that agency in connection with its
responsibilities, The photographs obtained, however, were
not suitable for this purposs.

Prints of these photographs were not made availabis
to the Akron Police Department, were not forwarded to FBI :
Headquarters in Washington, D. C., and were not made available
_to anyone else. ‘These prints were not retained at the Akron
FBI Resident Agency, but were sent ta the Cleveland FEL
Office and are maintained in the rises of that office,

3. The Akron FBI Resident Agency did make an

; attempt to identify the unknown participants in the

demonstration from the photcgranhs taken during the demonstra~
tion, Information concerning the identities of some of the
denonstrators was provided by the Akron Resident Agency to

the Intelligence Division, Alsvon Police Department, for the
purpose of bringing to their attention the identities of those
andividual participants who have bsen involved in disruptive
activities in the past and who may become so involved again
in the future. One of the individuals so identixgied to the
Akron Police Departient has reportedly -urged ‘spontaneous |
violence" at a demonstration in the past.

Files of the FBI are not maintained at the Resident
Agency level; therefore, information concerning the identities

of sone of the demonstrators has been placed and igs being
maintained in the files of the Cleveland FBI Office,

4. It is believed the FBI should betain photographs
and information gathered concerning the identities of
demonstrators following a demonstration in which the

presence of the FEI is justified, even though such demonstra=

tion ends peacefully with no arrests and no violations of

either Yederal or iocai statutes. In the few sclective ~ -- =
instances in which demonstrations have been photographed,

@ substantive reason has existed justifying the use of

photography. In this instance, photography was utilized

in anticipation of commission of a Federal offense and in
connection with the investigation of an organization, and
individuals sffiliated therevith, on whom the’ FBI was

conducting investigation under the statutes mentioned herein.

Additionally, information of this nature is
maintained in accordance with the records ‘retention plan
euxnished the FBI by the National Archives and Records
Servico during 1969, This pian identified categories of seueuer’
records vhich were considered to have a permanent value and
which shouid bo retained indefinitely by the FBI, Included
were those records involv. g crimes of treason, insurrection

Subcommittee on Civil and Constitutional Rights pasieear,
of the House Committees on the Judiciary - 7 nesseaea

. Responses to the aforementioned questicns are set
. forth below and appear in the same order as posed.

i. The FBX conducts surveillances of demonstrations
occurring on or near Federal property; at other locations
whon facts indicate a violation of Federai statutes over
which the Fi has investigative jurisdiction may occur; oy
' at a site where individuais of investigative interest to
: the FRI are present or the demonstration is sponsored by
if an organigation of investigative interest. Ii this instance,
the FRi had received information from a source, whe hag
provided reliable’ ingormation in the past, that an organiga-
tion of investigative interest to the FLI would be attempting
to gain publicity by entering the Federal Building in Akron, -
ereating disturbances and defacing Federal property. This ~
organization has been determined to be influenced by a
separate organization which espouses a basic Narxist-
LeninisteNacist revolutionary ideology. Investigation of
both of these organizations is based on information which
indicates they mzy be engaged in activities which could
involve violations of Tities 16, United States Code,
Sections 45u5 (Keveiiion or insurreviivu}, 2554 (Soditious
Conspirecy), 2885 (Advocating Overthrow of Government), and
2387 (Sedition). in addition, imasmuch as the possibility
existed individuais present at the demonstration would

. attempt to deface Federal property, there was reason to
believe a yiolation of Titie 18, United States Code,
Section 1861 (Destruction of Government Property) could occur,
At a later date, additional daforsation was recoived from a

! . Survefliance in this case was not; related to any
. bomb threat; however, based on the information stated above,
there was reason for the FBI to suspect that there might ke
violations of Federal statutes over which the FSI has investi-
gative jurisdiction. In the event such violations did occur,
it would be necessary that Agents be present to gather the
necessary evidence . i
fhe FBI did have an interest relating to the
identities of the particular individuals who were involved
in organizing the demonstration. One such individual, who
played 2 key vole in plans to cause disruptive activity and
in erganizing the demonstration, has been arrested and :
convicted fof abuse to a police officer, tesisting avrast, .-° -
discrdexly conduct, trespassing, and disrupting iawfnul :
assembly in the past and has been described by a souree,
who has provided veliable infclmation in the past,
tO bays incgicated in ths past a desive to "get eduething
going with the police." This same individual is aiso 7
considered by the source to be unstable and violence-prone.
in addition. the individuals planning the demcustYaticn,
as pteviously montioned, were afiliiated with an organiza-
tion which feollicys a Yevolutionary ideclogy,.

: 2, Yhexe were no known violations of Federal ox
- local statutes during the demenst¥ragfion; there was no violent}:
and there wore no arrests as a Tesult of the demonstraticn.
Both visual and photographic surveillances were conducted by
the FSi during the demonstration. Current FBI instructions
state that photographic surveillances should ba considered on
a selective basis when cixcumstanecos indicate they may be
productive. The decision-making authority in such a‘ matter ©
4s vested in the Special Agent in Charge of the particular
headquarters field office of the FBI, his assistant in his
absence, of the Agent supervisor acting on their behalf? in
the absence of both. In the event unusual civcunstances
exist, the Special Agent in Charro of a particular field
office would request authority from FDI Headquarters in
Washington, D, C., to conduct a photorraphic survelllanes,
Photographs were taken for the possible evidentiary purpose of
vecording anticipated events leading te the perpetration of an
act by one er more demcnstratcrs in violation of the Federal
statute concerning destruction of Government property, as woll
as Yecording on film any overt act. FBI Agents ecbserved the
- demonstration for the same: reason and for the additional purpcse
of effecting, 12 necessary, the arrests of individuals violating
i Fedexval statutes.

. 4. It is believed the FBI should retain photographs

- and information gathered concerning the identities of :
demonstrators following a demonstration in which the
presence of the FLY is justified, even though such demonstra=
tion ends peacefully with no arrests and no violations of
either Federal or local statutes. In the few selective ~  --
instances in which demonstrations have been photographed,
a sunstantive reason has existed justifying the use of
photography. In this instance, photography was utilized
in anticipation of comission of a Federal offense and in

i connection with the investigation of an organization, and

, individuals affiliated therewith, on whom the FSI was

} conducting investigation under the statutes mentioned herein,

At the present time the type of equipment to be used in photographing
civil rights demonstrations and similar activity is lefi to the discretion of the
fpecial Agent in Charge who should make the necessary evaluation as to the
type of equipment most suitable in view of existing circumstances and available
equipment. The question of whether such pictures will be taken openly or by
the use of concealed photographic equipment will continue to be the responsibility
of the Special Agent in Charge who will be held accountable for exercising sound
judgment in each instance.

i) {D) ATTACHE PHOTOCOPY UNITS - PHOTOGRAPHIC EQUIPMENT ~-
i The Attache Photocopy Units are portable docuntént copy equipment. These
units are now available for field use. The enclosure shows one of these
units in yarious stages of assembly. Units will be furnished to each office
having available a Special Agent who has received the Laboratory's :
spe fialized training im survejilance photography. The equipment will
be sent by FBI Lab ory invoice, and on receipt of the equipment
appropriate inve.itorv/additions should be made, Secording the serial number
of the unit along with the serial number of the cathera and of the lens.
Panatomic X ffm for use in this equipment can bé requisitioned from Bureau
supply. f ;

f

This doctiment copy equipment is completely self-contained,
requires no outside power source and, therefore, can be used to copy
documents in an automobile or at any location without regard to the avail-
ability of electric power of any kind. These units are contained in regular
attache cases measuring 18 inches by 12 inches by 4 3/4 inches and the
gross weight of each unit is 16 pounds. The units are assembled by raising
the supporting sides into upright positions and placing the camera-light
assembly in position on top of these sides. The lights are then swung
to the sides to complete the assembly. An assembled copy unit may be
used, either standing in the attache case, or removed from it. Documents

up to legal size may be copied in a single exposure but large documents may
be copied in sections by multiple exposures if the units are removed from the
attache cases. Complete operating instructions are included with each unit.

The lights in the Attache Photocopy Units are electron photoflash
lights and are powered by a 90-volt battery which is good for a minimum of
1000 exposures. The camera-used in the equipment is a standard 35. mm
Minolta SR-i camera with a 35mm {4 Rokkor lens, These cameras take
standard 36 exposure loads of film, have rapid wind levers and may be
reloaded without detaching from the units. Kodak Panatomic X or equivalent
ASA 50 film requires an exposure of 1/15 second at f11 or 1/8 second at £16
in these units.

Attache Photocopy Units have already been furnished to New York,
Washington Field, Jackson, Miami, and Atlanta. In the near future units
will be forwarded to Albany, Albuquerque, Baltimore, Birmingham, Boston,
Buffalo, Charlotte, Chicago, Cincinnati, Cleveland, Dallas, Detroit, Honolulu,
Houston, Indianapolis, Jacksonville, Kansas City, Knoxville, Las Vegas,
Little Rock, Los Angeles, Louisville, Milwaukee, Minneapolis, Mobile,
Newark, New Haven, New Orleans, Norfolk, Oklahoma City, Omaha,
Philadelphia, Phoenix, Pittsburgh, Portland, Richmond, St. Louis, San
Antonio, San Diego, San Francisco, San Juan, Seattle, and Springfield.
Request for additional Attache Photocopy Units or request from offices not
receiving units at this time should be made by letter marked for the attention
of the FBI Laboratory.

(8) VAUTOMOTIVE EQUIPMENT USED IN SURVEILLANCES -- You aré
reminded of the necessity that automotive equipment used in surveillances
be sufficiently varied as to minimize the danger that persons under
surveillan¢es will recognize it as "policermen's equipment." A limited
amount of special surveillance equipment is located in the various offices.
Efforts will be made in the future to augment this equipment. Until
procurement of sufficiently varied automotive equipment can be obtained,
you are authorized to make appropriate use of rental equipment where
necessary; however, it is your responsibility to see that such rental
equipment is completely justified. Whenever such use wili be extensive
and the cost is estimated to exceed $100, prior Bureau authority must be
obtained and may be obtained on an expedite basis. You are reminded of
the importance of maintaining special surveillance vehicles and equipment
in a secure manner to insure none of our surveillances are in any way
jeopardized. Existing regulations require that all radio-equipped
surveillance trucks be provided separate garage and storage treatment.
The desirability of maintaining other surveillance automotive equipment
separately from our normal equipment should be carefully evaluated.
Where circumstances dictate, such equipment should be provided the
same separate facilities as is now required of radio-equipped surveillance
trucks. Appropriate manual changes concerning the rental of surveillance
equipment will be forthcoming.

(H)VESPIONAGE AND’ FOREIGN INTELLIGENCE INVESTIGATIONS a ee
OF SOVIET-BLOC PERSONNEL -- For years Soviet officials in the United
States have made numerous and repeated trips throughout this country
aimed at obtaining valuable data regarding our air bases, missile
sites and other important defense installations. In recent years
they have coordinated their activities in this regard with the
satellite countries and in this way are getting coverage of areas
the United States closed to Soviet travel.
Ap ‘
: Im connection with our. regponsibility in regard to coverage
of Soviet-bloc activities, these Soviet~bloc officials have been
placed under surveillance, Many offices have participated in these
surveillances, and it appears that this activity on the part of the
Soviet bloc will continue.

On May 16, 1962, a number of newspapers in the United
States carried an Associated Press article, date line Moscow, May 15,
1962, reporting that a correspondent for “Izvestia," the official
Soviet Government newspaper, alleged that during a recent tour of
the United States he was constantly shadowed by the “American secret
service." He also alleged newspaper reporters and television men
had “close business connections with the FBI" because reporters met

_ him at the railroad station in Portland, Oregon, when he arrived

there. He alleged he was under heavy surveillance in Seattle,
Washington, and furnished license numbers of two automobiles he

alleged were conducting surveillance of him‘in Los Angeles,

(2

NW 65360 Docld:32989614 Page 199

California. .

The Bureau determined that the allegations of the Soviet
correspondent were completely false and undoubtedly were an attempt
by the Soviets to embarrass this Bureau and to curtail our counter-
intelligence operations. There is a definite possibility other
Soviet-bloc personnel may make similar charges in the future and
in this connection may attempt to obtain proof of their allegations,
such as obtaining photographs of Bureau cars or surveillance agents.
It is known that bloc personnel have made numerous attempts to do
this in the past.

We do not intend to allow a false allegation by the
Soviet bloc to alter coverage of their activities. Our surveil-
lances undoubtedly have hampered the Soviets in collection of
intelligence data in the United States, and we can expect them
to create or utilize any incident they can as a basis for protest
against our coverage.

6/5/62
SAC LETTER NO. 62-32 -7T-



It is desired, therefore, that the above facts be
called to the attention of all agents. It should be pointed
out that while the Bureau desires our coverage of Soviet-bloc
officials to be as complete as possible, the surveillance
must be discreet and every precaution must be taken to avoid
giving the Soviets a basis for protest.

You should impress upon agents handling survelilances
. of Soviet-bloc personnel in the United States that they must
It constantly exercise keen alertness, careful planning and good
judgment in handling all facets of our surveillance operations.

Very truly yours,
‘ John Edgar Hoover
