MEMORANDUM FOR: Deputy Director for Operations

Deputy Director for Administration

Inspector General

General Counsel

Deputy Director for Public Affairs

FROM:

SUBJECT:

Acting Legislative Counsel

House Select Committee on Assassinations

1. On 27 April 1978, I sent you a projection of issues requiring

the development of coordinated positions for consideration and decision

by top management. In response to my request, each of you designated

representatives to a Task Force assembled for this purpose and the Task

Force met on 4 May (Attachment A).

2. Attachment B contains memoranda on sessions with the senior

staff of the Assassinations Committee subsequent to the 4 May Task

Force meeting, covering Committee complaints and our pre-position

bargaining with them on certain key issues, e. go,:

• Nosenko: Has refused to be video taper

he Committee staff is pondering this decisior

The "formal"' session has been slipped from 31 May

to 21-22 June.

b. The question of whether the claim of

sources and methods can extend to information known

to a defector before he is recruited or defected.

3. I understand there has been concern over the range of access

by Committee staffers to sensitive information. I think you should know

that pursuant to an exchange of letters between the Chairman and the

Director, coordinated with CIA offices of interest, revised procedures

to allow a selected group of staff researchers access to CIA documents

with limited sanitization to facilitate the Committee's review of the

larger volumes of files involved. Sensitive viable Agency sources,

however, are excised and the staff must show relevancy to the

investigation if there is any question as to making material available.

tor example, the Committee's inquiry into the CIA Japan Station was.

resisted until the staff disclosed to us that the purpose was former 5-9

CIA employee James Wilcott's allegation that Oswald was a CIA agent.

Those staffers given this special access have executed special secrecy

agreements which run to the Director as opposed to the Committee as is the

case with the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence for example.

There also has been concerns expressed that the Committee has been

given greater access than has ever been done before in a Congressional

investigation. Although we are getting into new unchartered waters

as a result of the Jay Epstein book, the Church Committee, for example,

had wide access to the Oswald 201 file and personnel files.

4. Attached is an agenda for the next Task Force meeting. You

may wish to review some of the major issues pending. Positions on

these issues, of course, will be fully coordinated and appropriately

presented to the DDCI/DCI for determinatio
