Director

National Security Agency/Central Security Service

Fort Meade, Md. 20755

Dear Sirs:

This is a request under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 8552.

Please furnish me with all correspondence or records of any communications

between your agency and the U.S. House Select Committee on Assassinations

concerning the Select Committee's investigation into the assassination of

President John F. Kennedy.

I am presently engaged in a program of scholarly research on the work

of the Select Committee, which includes gathering all available records

dealing with its investigation. As the records requested concern the

assassination of an American president, I feel they are of important historical

value and that their release would significantly benefit the public.

Accordingly, I hereby request that all search and copying fees be waived as

provided for under the Act.

If you do not make an initial determination to waive these costs,

please first furnish me an estimate of the number of records involved,

the cost of a thorough search and your charge per page for copying:

Sincerely,

Mal Aalle

Mark A. Allen
