Fort Meade, Md. - 20755 :

Dear Sirs:

This is a request under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. $552,
Please furnish me with all correspondence or records of any communications
between your agency and the U.S. House Select Committee on Assassinations
concerning the Select Committee's investigation into the assassination of
President John F, Kennedy, F

I am presently engaged in a program of scholarly research on the work
of the Select Committee, which includes gathering all available records
dealing with its investigation. As the records requested concern the
assassination of an American president, I.feel they are of important historical
value and that their release would significantly benefit the public.
Accordingly, I hereby request that all search and copying fees be waived as
provided for under the Act.

If you do not make an initial determination to waive these costs,
please first furnish me an estimate of the number of records involved,

the cost of a thorough search and-your charge per page for copying.

Sincerely,

AML A Qld

Mark A. Allen
