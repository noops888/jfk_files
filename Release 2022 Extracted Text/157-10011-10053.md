Mr. Schwarz. Reflecting a minute of the meeting on;May
3rd, Present: General Taylor, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Johnson; Mr.
Giipatric, General Decker, General Lansdale and General

Craig; Mr. McCone, and Mr. Harvey.

Here I would like to read into the record the entirety
of paragraph 2, which is: "Mr. Harvey gave a rundown on
progress to date, with agent teams and in the general field of
intelligence, including the Opa-locka interrogation center and
the " |clandestine interrogation center. He outlined
various difficulties encountered and said the three agent teams
had been infiltrated and the five W/T sets are in place.
Approximately 72 actual or potential reporting sources are
also‘in-place. A significant development is that Major Duque
has refused to allow agents responsive to him to be dispatched
on purely intelligence-gathering missions. (This sort of
attitude had been forecast earlier as a possibility, but it now
assumes particular importance in view of Duque's stature.)" .

All xight.

Now, having marked these’three exhibits, .Mr..Harvey, they
surround your visit to Miami when you passed the poisoned pills
to Roselli for assassination purposes.

Now you have testified that when you were in Miami you
did a lot of other things. Could you first state what they
are?

or a number of years. The only time the
007 comment was ever made to my knowledge was at a Special
Group (Augmented) meeting, and the sort of facetious comment
by the then-Attorney General, why can't you ~-- and this was a
part of his sort of favorite author was Ian Fleming, and so
on -- why can't you gentlemen get things cooking the way 007
does?

That's the only time I ever recall that being made, or that
type of reference being made.

As far as this’ business of the firearms is concerned, the
only incident that aver happened on that is the one that I
mentioned a moment ago, gentlemen. There was one occasion a
as I recall I was at lunch and was called from the Director's
Office and told to go to the White House because of a meeting.

I did happen to be armed at the time, and it occurred to
me as I went in downstairs at the White House that it was most
inappropriate for anybody except the Secret Service officer to
go up to the White House offices armed, so I checked the sidearm
that I had with the Secret Service officer at the desk, and I
picked it up on the way out.

That“ isthe only incident, as far as I know, not only as
far as I know, it is the only incident that ever happened which

even remotely resembles the question you raised.
