The April 9, 1963, issue of the "Miami News"
carried an article entitled, “Exiles Say Miro.fo Quit™,
This article stated that informed exile sources claim
that Dr. JOSE MIRO CARDONA would rezizn his post as head
of the Cuban Revolutionary Council. The article said
exile sources gave two possibilities for his resignation,
One faction believed that MIRO's recent trip to Washington
from which he returned Sunday (April.7) was to pin down the
United States Government to a statement of positive policy
regarding Cuba. Another schsol of thought was that the
Council head was retiring from his poet in protest of
Government curbing of hit-and-run raids on the Comuunist

ialand of Cuba.

The article went on to state that Dr. MIRO's
leadership in the Council, aimed at uniting all Cuban
exiles, has been burdened by protlems since his appointment

in March 1961.
On April 10, 1963, MM T-

{

‘Who has rurnished some reliable information “in the past,

beginning April 9, and ending at atout 6:00 A.M., on

April 10, during which time MIRO CARDGNA presented his
resignation but the Council refused to accept his resignation
and MIRO CARDONA was persuaded to remain as President of the

Council.

1M T-1 said that MIRO's resiznation consisted of Fi
a 25-page statement which was in effect an indictment against i"
the administration of President JOMi FP, KENNEDY of the United

first line of combat,

MM T-1 explained that when Dr, MIRO CARDONA ret
to Miami from a trip to Washington, D. C., on Sunday, where
contacted high government officials, he came away with the

feeling thatr

1) The United States has no plan to free Cuba
ai of Communism. :

2) If the United States ever does formulate any
zs plans, 1t will do so without consideration
for the Cuban exiles in tho United States.

3) The United States policy is now one of
peaceful co-existence with Communist Cuba.

MM T-1 said that in his opinion, the Cuban exiles
are frustrated, confused, losing faith in the United State
and there is a growing feeling of abandonment of them by the

United States.

The April 10, 1963, issue of the "Miami Herald”
carried a headline article entitled, "Miro Resigns as Exile
Chief; Raps U. S. Policy". This article stated that MIRO
CARDONA resigned because the United States refused to allocate
fifty million dollars to train a Cuban invasion force, according

informed source said that MIRO decided to quit “because
of the change in the U. S. - Cuban poltoy”.

The April 16, 1963, issue of the "Miami Herald”
carried an article entitled "JFK Accepts Demand, Fidel Says".
This article by the UPI bearing a Havana dateline reported
that PILZL CASTRO told Cubans on Thursday (April 11) that the
KENUEZDT Administration has accepted one of his five demands

On April 15, 1963, MM T-1 advised that he was
positive that MIRO CARDONA did not intend to again tender
his resignation on Monday, April 15, 1963, but was
contemplating taking that action on the following Thursday,
April 18, 1963. MM T-1 said that the Counel1 was meeting ~
on Thursday to take a ‘definite attitude ortough line of
action and that it waa entirely probable that all of the
members of the Council might resigh in protest to the present
policy of the United 2tates with regard to the Cuban situation.
He said that the prezent feeling of the Council towards the
United States is basically "to hell with it",

MM T-l expreased the personal feeling that VU. S,
policy towards Cuba is presentlyin a vacuum and consequently
everything 18 at a standstill. The Cuban exiles in the
Miami area feel that the VU. S. is abandoning their cause
and has now adopted a course of peaceful cc-existence with
Communist Cuba.

On April 16, 1963, MM T-2, a Cuban exile who has :
furnished some reliable information in the past and who is erates
associated with fellow Cubans’ who belong to several different A
organizations, ddvieed that reaction among the Cuban exiles - :
ia "very bad against the United States". He explained that the s
Cuban exiles allege that President KENNEDY has made promises eurtin
to help them in their fight against CASTRO but is now opposing ts
them and consequently they feel that the U. 3. 18 now committed
to a policy of peaceful co-existence with Communist Cuba. i

" The Cuban exiles are fearful as to the future, confused as to :
why the U. S. has changed its policy and the exiles feel that
they have been abandoned in their fight.
