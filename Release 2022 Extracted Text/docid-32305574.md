friend, NANCY CZAR, moved from ROSELLI's apartment sometime
during the latter part of June, 1965, and no longer lives
there. Informant has no knowledge that any other woman is
living at ROSELLI's apartment at the present time. i

On the afternoon of 7/16/65 information was
received from the LAPD that ROSELLI left Los Angeles for
Las Vegas at about 3:00 PM on this date via Western Airlines.
ROSELLI was alone.

LA 4145-c advised on 7/15/65 that ROSELLI had
recently contacted AL PARVIN who owns a considerable interest
in the Dohrman Hotel Supply Company for the purpose of convincing
PARVIN to have the Dohrman company purchase more refrigeration
equipment from Ajax West Coast Corp. FRANZ BREITLING, a close
friend of ROSELLI, is president of Ajax and ROSELLI purchases
refrigeration equipment from the company for resale. According
to informant, BREITLING met with PARVIN on 7/13/65 to discuss
this matter. PARVIN was willing to buy more equipment from
Ajax but was not certain that he had sufficient control in the
company to persuade the buyers to use Ajax equipment exclusively
because in many instances other makes of equipment would be
specified. However, PARVIN and BREITLING will continue to
work on this matter. Informant said that when some agreement
is reached between them, ROSELLI will receive a three per cent
commission of the gross sales made by Ajax to the Dohrman
Company. Informant estimated that if Ajax got all of Dohrman's
refrigeration equipment business the total yearly sales would
pe about $500,000.
