friend, NANCY CZAR, moved from ROSELLI 's

apartment sometime

during

the latter part of June, 1965, and no longer lives

there.

Informant

has no knowledge that any other woman is

living at ROSELLI's apartment at the present time.

On the afternoon of 7/16/65 information was

received from the LAPD that ROSELLI left Los Angeles for

Las Vegas at about 3:00 PM on this date via Western Airlines.

ROSELLI was alone.

LA 4145-C advised on 7/15/65 that ROSELLI had

recently contacted AL PARVIN who owns a considerable interest

in the Dohrman Hotel Supply Company for the purpose of convincing

PARVIN to have the Dohrman company purchase more refrigeration

equipment from Ajax West Coast Corp.

FRANZ BRETTLING, a close

friend of ROSELLI, Is president of Ajax and ROSELLI purchases

reirigeration equipment irom the company for resale.

According

to informant, BREITLING met with PARVIN on 7/13/65 to discuss

this matter.

PARVIN was willing to buy more equipment from

Ajax but was not certain that he had sufficient control in the

company to persuade the buyers to use Ajax equipment exclusively

because in many instances other makes of equipment would be

specified.

However, PARVIN and BREITLING will continue to

work on this matter.

Informant said that when some agreement

is reached between them, ROSELLI will receive a three per cent

commission of the gross

sales made by Ajax to the Dohrman

Company.

Informant estimated that if Ajax got all of Dohrman's

refrigeration equipment business the

total yearly sales would

be about $500,000.
