Project WUBRINY - Termination Settlement

with Edward G. TICHBORN (P)

The undersigned on 12 September 1968 went to

New York to effect a termination settlement with Edward G.

TICHSORN (P). A hotel room at the Shoreham Hotel, 33 West

55th Street,

was obtained for a meeting place.

There were

two principal aspects to the settlement:

secure TICHBORN's acceptance of an amend-

ment to his contract providing for a one-time: Lump

sum taxable payment of $3311.00 and releasing the:

• Government from any further claim and

insure that TICHBORN had, as. of 31 August 1968

administratively severed his relationship with WUSALINE,

particularly that his

accountings for expenses in-

curred in 1968 were

submitted,

recorded by WUSALINE,

and certified correct and proper by both TICHBORN

and WUBRINY/l1.

2:.

The first pant of the settlement went smoothly.

TICHBORN on 12 September 1968 readily accepted the amend-

ment to his.

basic contract:

He brought along for the Covert

tax Unit a

Copy of his 1966 income tax return which the

prietary company (WUTACTIC) which will issue TICHBORN

a Form 1099 for income tax filing.

He readily endorsed

and save to the undersigned the check for $477.38 la

settlenent of the amount he owed wi Division from nis

Lour in Mexico City.

3.

Trough no fault of TiCuRN, the administrative

severance from WUSALINE did not go as smothly.

The undersigned

enjoined TICHBORN and WUBRINY/11 to prepare a couplete

List of expenses for 1968.

TICHBORN was asked to record

the purpose of each expense.

The undersigned emphasized

In WUBRIVY/ll's presence that TICHBORN should ensure

that

no experses chargeable to wiskint/l's private firm were

charged

to WUSALINE.

Both TICHBORN and WUBRINY/ll were

reminded that all expenses on the Venezuela project were

chargeable to WUBRINY/l's private firm as well as one-half

of the expenses on the Mexican Border project: TICHBORN

said that he would get all of the accountings fron WUBRINY/11's

had lost the missing accountings.

TICHBORN

atso said that a few of the charges on the partial list

of expenses which the undersigned had given him to review

should have been charged to WUBRINY/1'5 Private firm.

The undersigned secured

agreement from TICHBORN and WUBRINY/ll that TICHBORN'S

services on WUBRINY/l's Venezuela projeci were as great

as any other officer who worked on it and that, therefore,

WUSALINE. should

receive for TICHBORN's services on als

project compensation at least egual to that given any

officer in

WUbRINY/l's private firm.

The undersigned

obtained fion TICHBORN the two credit cards American

hin under WUSALINE sponsorship.

The undersigned asked

TICHBORN if he had charged any

expenses under these cards

since: 31 August 1968-

TICHBORN sald that he had enter-

talned a movie producer who visited him as an outgrowth:

of his trip to California to develop a movie adjunctato

that TICHBORN was not authorized to incur any further

expenses after 31

TICHBORN then readily

agreed to pay the expense.

There is a possibility that WH Division may.

want TICHBORN to take an operational IDY In Chile.

TICHBORN was alerted to this possibility.

He expressed

interest in the assignment, but pointed out that he now

has to get. a job and

that,
