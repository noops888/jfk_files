Re: Frank Lang "Lefty" Rosenthal, aka AR; IGA.

The administrative pages of this report re~
flects the Bureau advised that local police authorities
should be advised that LUIS POSADA CARRILES, was in
possession of a gun equipped with a silencer, unless
reasons exist to the contrary. Information was not
furnished to the authorities due to the delicate nature
of information received from CIA and Miami security
informants. —

On 9-30-65, Miami advised Secret Service under.
category three regarding the above.

On 11-5-65, POSADA identified a photo of NORMAN
ROTHMAN, as the American who accompanied ROSENTHAL and an
unidentified third American male whom POSADA believed to
be a gun dealer. POSADA thought the third man a gun
dealer because on occasion of meeting the third American the
first time at a garage operated by DIEGO BORGES, the third
man had a gun and seemed to be very knowledgeable about
guns in general. This individual asked if a silener could
be obtained for a specific type of gun. POSADA related
the silencers involved in the deal between BORGES and the
three Americans were made or obtained by FRANCISCO RODRIGUEZ
TAMAYO, a Cuban exile, POSADA said that he accompanied
RODRIGUEZ when he turned about six silencers over to BORGES.
BORGES intended to turn over to the Americans the silencers
but later learned they were no good.

. _Luis ADA Carriles, residing at 2635 S.W, 28th
St., Miami, telephone 4435-0206, is a contact of this office
and the source of the information reported to the FBI in
referenced memoranda. On 9 June 1967, POSADA advised this
office that subsequent to the events reported in referenced
memoranda, circa October 1966, he was contacted by Frank
"Lefty" ROSENTHAL who visited POSADA's home, ROSENTHAL told
POSADA that all the silencers he had purchased from POSADA
were pieces of junk and that he felt POSADA and Diego
BORGES were responsible and maybe his friends would kill
POSADA and BORGES some day. ROSENTHAL further stated that
in spite of the fact he was out $5000 for the equipment, he
didn't want money from POSADA. He said he knew POSADA was
working for the CIA and that he wanted some CIA “equipment”.
He asked POSADA to steal such “equipment” and give it to
him. POSADA allegedly refused to do so at which time
ROSENTHAL said that his friends thought POSADA had made a
fool of them and if POSADA didn't do something to make
ROSENTHAL's friends happy, POSADA was a dead man. POSADA
then made a number of fuse devices which he.gave to
ROSENTHAL which seemed to make ROSENTHAL happy.

29 July 1967

2. In early June 1967, ROSENTHAL again visited
POSADA's home and told POSADA that the fuse devices were
faulty and one of his friends had had an accident asa
result of POSADA's work, He reiterated a desire to have
some CIA fuse devices as well as a remote control unit
for detonating explosive charges, He "reminded" POSADA
that he still owed them $5000 worth of "equipment",

visit from ROSENTHAL at midnight on 11 June 1967, ROSENTHAL
asked for the "equipment" and told POSADA he had friends who
would "get" POSADA if he did not deliver, POSADA allegedly
got equally as tough with ROSENTHAL saying he, too, had
friends who could "get" ROSENTHAL, POSADA refused to do
anything more for ROSENTHAL. POSADA advised this office
that he doesn't think ROSENTHAL will bother him again
although he can't be certain,

the FBI'on this matter and this office has no objection to
your office contacting POSADA at any time. It is requested

that we be kept informed of the results of your investigation.

105-1729-1853 FD 302 of Ricardo Morales Navarrete 5/22/68. |
Information furnished to SA Joseph C. Ball, re: Venezuelan i
Political Activities. Cuban nationals LUIS POSADA and
GUSTAVO ORTIZ are in charge of Section 1 of the General
Directorate of Police (DIGIPOL), the Venezuelan secret
plice. This section is in charge of all Cuban activities
and movements in Venezuela. POSADA and ORTIZ reportedly
have gained such control that every Cuban who enters or
leaves Venezuela is required to submit to an interview
by this section.. POSADA is a "gangster type"-and he and
ORTIZ are reportedly very effective, using strong-arm
methods to obtain information and fight pro-CASTRO elements.
For example, if an individual is identified as a CASTRO
supporter, they do not bother to question him or advise
him of any rights but simply eliminate him. They are under
the direct supervision of ERASTO FERNANDEZ, the head of
DIGEPOL. ERASTO FERNANDEZ has recently been under in-
vestigation by high Venezuelan authorities. DIGEPOL
recently arrested two Venezuelan students who were su-
sequently found dead and FERNANDEZ has been under in-
vestigation by the Venezuelan Senate because of those
and other similar activities. FRANCISCO RODRIGUEZ TAMAYO,

i also known as “El Mexicano" has recently left for Venezuela,
