Re: Frank Lang "Lefty" Rosenthal, aka AR; IGA.

The administrative pages of this report re-

flects the Bureau advised that local police authorities

should be advised that LUIS POSADA CARRILES, was in

possession of a gun equipped with a silencer, unless

reasons exist to the contrary. Information was not

furnished to the authorities due to the delicate nature

of information received from CIA and Miami

security

informants.

on 9-30-65, Miami advised Secret Service under.

category three regarding the above.

On 11-5-65, POSADA identified a photo of NORMAN

ROTIMAN, as the American who accompanied ROSENTHAL and an

unidentified third American male whom POSADA believed to

be a gun dealer. POSADA thought the third man a gun

dealer because on occasion of meeting the third American the

first time at a garage operated by DIEGO BORGES, the third

man had a gun and seemed to be very knowledgeable about

guns in general. This individual asked if a silener could

be obtained for

a specific type of gun. POSADA related

the silencers involved in the deal between BORGES and the

three Americans were made or obtained by FRANCISCO RODRIGUEZ

TAMAYO, a Cuban exile.

POSADA said that he accompanied

RODRIGUEZ when he turned about six silencers over to BORGES.

BORGES intended to turn over to the Americans the silencers

but later learned they were no good.

1. Luis

POSADA Carriles

St., Miami,

telephone 445-0206, is

residing at 2635 S.w. 28th

a contact of this office

and the source of the information reported to the FBI in

referenced memoranda.

On 9 June 1967, POSADA advised this

office that subsequent to the events reported in referenced

memoranda, circa October 1966, he was contacted by Frank

"Lefty" ROSENTHAL who visited

POSADA's home.

ROSENTHAL told

POSADA that all the silencers he had purchased from POSADA

were pieces of junk and that he felt POSADA and Diego

BORGES were responsible and maybe his friends would kill

POSADA and BORGES some day.

ROSENTHAL further stated that

In spite of the tact he was out $0000 for the equipment, he

didn't want money from POSADA. He said he knew POSADA was

working for the CIA and that he wanted some CIA "equipment"

He asked POSADA to steal such "equipment" and give it to

him.

POSADA allegedly refused to do so at which time

ROSENTHAL said that his friends thought POSADA had made a

fool of then and if POSADA didn't do something to make

ROSENTHAL'S friends happy, POSADA was a dead man. POSADA

then made a number of fuse devices which he gave to

ROSENTHAL which seemed to make ROSENTHAL happy.

2.

In early June 1967, ROSENTHAL again visited

POSADA's home and told POSADA that the fuse devices were

faulty and one of his friends had had an accident as a

result of POSADA's work.

He reiterated a desire to have

some CIA fuse devices as well as a remote control unit

for detonating explosive charges.

He "reminded" POSADA

that he still owed them $5000 worth of "equipment".

3. On 12 June 1967, POSADA reported that he had a

visit from ROSENTHAL at midnight on 11 June 1967.

ROSENTHAL

asked for the "equipment" and told POSADA he had friends who

would "get" POSADA if he did not deliver. POSADA allegedly

got equally as tough with ROSENTHAL, saying he; too, had

friends who could "get" ROSENTHAL.

POSADA refused

to do

anything more for ROSENTHAL. POSADA advised this office

that he doesn't think ROSENTHAL will bother him again

although he can't be certain.

4.

POSADA advises he would be willing to work with

the FBI'on this matter and this

office has no objection to

your office contacting POSADA at any time. It is requested

that we be kept informed of the results of your investigation.

On both occasions he indicated that he had had no futher

105-1729-1853 FD 302 of Ricardo Morales Navarrete 5/22/68.

Information furnished to SA Joseph C. Ball, re: Venezuelan

Political Activities. Cuban nationals LUIS POSADA and

GUSTAVO ORTIZ are in charge of Section 1 of the General

Directorate of Police (DIGIPOL), the Venezuelan secret

plice. This section is in

charge of all Cuban activities

and movements in Venezuela. POSADA and ORTIZ reportedly

have gained such control that every Cuban who enters or

leaves Venezuela is required to submit to an interview

by this section.. POSADA is a "gangster type" and he and

ORTIZ are reportedly very effective, using strong-arm

methods to obtain information and fight pro-CASTRO elements.

For example, if an individual is identified as a CASTRO

supporter, they do not bother to question him or advise

him of any rights but simply eliminate him. They are under

the direct supervision of ERASTO FERNANDEZ, the head of

DIGEPOL •

ERASTO FERNANDEZ has recently been under in-

vestigation by high Venezuelan authorities. DIGEPOL

recently arrested two Venezualan students who were sur

sequently found dead and FERNANDEZ has been under in-

vestigation by the Venezuelan Senate because of those

and other similar activities. FRANCISCO RODRIGUEZ TAMAYO,

also known

as

"El Mexicano" has recently left for vene

where he will be

in touch with POSADA and ORTIz. (luauela,
