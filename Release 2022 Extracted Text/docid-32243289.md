Kennedy Assassination

Hecords Lollection Act of

1992 |44 USC 2107 Notel.

09.01-2022

December 8, 1995

Status of Document:

Postponed in Part

Number of releases of previously postponed information: 20

Reason for Board Action: The Review Board's decision was premised on several factors

including: (a) the significant historical interest in the document in question; (b) the

absence of evidence that the release of the information would cause harm to the United

States or to any individual.

Number of Postponements: 6

Postponements: All the postponements in this document represent Social Security numbers.

Reason for Board Action: The text is redacted because the public disclosure of the redaction could

Dear Mr. Sprague:

You've undertaken quite a task. I think I can be of

use to you and

I hope you'll agree.

As my

attached resume shows, I have considerable

practical as well as executive experience, not only

in investigating homicides and conspiracies (real or

imagined) but in effectively handling problems that

involve delicate interagency relationships.

I retired from Federal service a little over a year

ago because my retirement would have been mandatory

within a few years anyway and there seemed no purpose

in marking time until then; I am now working as a

have no cloud over me and

was cleared for Top Secret at the time I retired. My

ability and reputation are well known to various

officials within Treasury law enforcement circles

including the Commissioner of Customs. As an ex-

Treasury investigator I can be objective about both

and the CIA; as an ex-Internal Security

Inspector I have lived with the problems of inform-

ation leaks and unethical disclosures. My retirement

status would allow me to work at a minimal salary and

for a fixed period of time.

I hope I have said enough to interest you; I can supply

additional details or discuss the matter with you at

your convenience. But even if you are not interested,

I have a suggestion which might be helpful to your

future inquiries: After the assassination of President

Kennedy, some witnesses claimed to have heard shots

fired

from somewhere other than Oswald's location.

There is a phenomenon called the "bow wave report" in

which persons hearing riflefire from a high-velocity

weapon undergo a "hearing illusion"; they think the

shot came direction other than its actual origin. (The

attached reprint of an article I wrote some years ago

touches on the "bow wave report". )

NW 68261

-Docld:32243289-Page-17

---

## Page 18

I don"t know whether the Warren Commission investi-

gators considered this phenomenon in their analysis

of witness statements; I have seen no mention of it

in any published material concerning their inquiry.

However the phenomenon can be tested and consideration

of it could resolve some of the questions that arose

from certain witness statements.

I hope I will hear from you. Whether I do or not,

I wish you the best of luck in your endeavor.

Sincerely,

James

POLICE TRAINING INVESTIGATES THE FALLIBILITY OF THE EYE WITNESS

JAMES H. CHENOWETH

James H. Chenoweth is Chief Deputy U. S. Marshal, Anchorage, Alaska, and a past-president of

the Alaska's Peace Officers Association. Shortly after his arrival in Alaska in 1951 Mr. Chenoweth

was appointed to the Alaska Police Department as a patrolman and detective, and in January 1954

assumed his present position. Prior to Alaskan statehood U. S. Marshals and their deputies were

charged with the responsibility of enforcing Alaskan law as well as Federal law and in this capacity

operated as a police unit. Among its other activities the Alaska's Peace Officers Association has con-

ducted several training programs at Anchorage one of which is described in this article.— EDITOR.

ago because my retirement would have been mandatory

Spoke to him today about a position as Acting Security

Chief at a salary of $28,000 -- although I told him that

ultimately he may not remain in that position as I may

want him to work on the Kennedy investigation.

He said he wanted to speak to his wife about it and that

Dear Vir. Spragues

You've undertaken quite a task. I think I can be of

use to you and I hope you"ll agree.

As my attached resume shows. I have considerable

practical as well as executive experience, not only

in investigating homicides and conspiracies (real or

imagined) but in effectively handing problems that

involve delicate interagency relationships.

I retired irom Federal service a little over a year

ago because my retirement would have been mandatory

within a few years anyway and there seemed no purpose

in marking time until then; I am now working as a

Iree lance photographer. I have no cloud over me and

was cleared for Top Secret at the time I retired. My

ability and reputation are well known to various

officials within Ireasury law enforcement circles

including the Commissioner of Customs. As an ex-

Treasury investigator I can be objective about both

the FBI and the CIA; as an ex-Internal Security

Inspector I have lived, with the problems of inform-

ation leaks and unethical disclosures. My retirement

status would allow me to work at a minimal salary and

for a fixed period of time.

I hope I have said enough to interest you; I can supply

additional details or discuss the matter with you at

your convenience. But even if you are not interested,

I have a suggestion which might be helpful to your

future inquiries: After the assassination of President

Kennedy, some witnesses claimed to have heard shots

fired from somewhere other than Oswald's location.

There is a phenomenon called the "bow wave report" in

which persons hearing riflefire from a high-velocity

weapon undergo a "hearing illusion"; they think the

shot came direction other than its actual origin. (The

attached reprint of an article I wrote some years ago

touches on the "bow wave report".)

I don't know whether the Warren Commission investi-

gators considered this phenomenon in their analysis

of witness statements; I have seen no mention of it

in any published material concerning their inquiry.

However the phenomenon can be tested and consideration

of it could resolve some of the questions that arose

from certain witness statements.

I hope I will hear irom you. Whether I do or not,

I wish you the best of luck in your endeavor.

Sincerely;

POLICE TRAINING INVESTIGATES THE FALLIBILITY OF THE EYE WITNESS

JAMES H. CHENOWETH

James H. Chenoweth is Chief Deputy U. S. Marshal, Anchorage, Alaska, and a past-president of

the Alaska's Peace Officers Association. Shortly after his arrival in Alaska in 1951 Mr. Chenoweth

was appointed to the Alaska Police Department as a patrolman and detective, and in January 1954

assumed his present position. Prior to Alaskan statehood U. S. Marshals and their deputies were

charged with the responsibility of enforcing Alaskan law as well as Federal law and in this capacity

operated as a police unit. Among its other activities the Alaska's Peace Officers Association has con-

ducted several training programs at Anchorage one of which is described in this article.— EDITor.

Anchorage, Alaska, carried a brief item under a

interpretations of general terms such as "sweet,"

"bitter," "strong," "faint," "sharp;" some knowl-

edge of semantics is beneficial to a peace officer who

must work from the descriptive terms used by wit-

About ninety per cent of what we experience

comes to us through the organs of sight and hear-

ing. Reliability studies in both of these areas are

worth our attention. For example, Frances Mc-

Gehee made a reliability study to determine the

accuracy of 740 people who attempted to identify

an unfamiliar voice after various intervals of time

had elapsed after they heard the voice. This study

indicated that approximately eighty-three percent

of the listeners were able to identity the voice dur-

ing intervals that extended up to two weeks, but

beyond that point there was a notable drop in cor-

rect identification.

Problems frequently arise for investigating offi-

cers who must determine the source of sound, and

they are especially troublesome in cases involving

gunfire. A high-velocity bullet in flight builds up a

bow-wave in front of it which assaults the ear of a

listener with a sound-impact. Because this bow-

wave originates from a different location than the

gunshot itself, the listener who hears the bow-wave

before he hears the gunshot may easily be mis-

taken; confusing the bow-wave report with the

gunshot report, he may honestly be in error con-

cerning the source of the gunfire.

To illustrate some of these audio-problems, we

asked the students to close their eyes and listen to

a variety of sounds which were produced from dif-

ferent locations, including up near the ceiling. With

their eyes still closed, they were requested to point

to the source of the sounds. When they opened

their eyes, the variety of directions indicated drove

the point home. This test is made more interesting

if different sounds are used and the students are

asked to identify them. Some of our experienced

police officers could not distinguish between the

sound of a gun being cocked and the sound of a

cigarette lighter.

Visio-errors cause more trouble for police officers

than any other form of sensory data.

We intro-.

duced this topic by discussing retinal fatigue, night-

vision, color-blindness,

Vincent's Rule on the

limiting

visual

recognition, and

Rohrschach tests. Using visual aid cards which

contained numerous optical illusions, we helped

each student to commit his own "eyeball error."

At this stage in our course; we digressed a bit

and began relating the many psychological tests

that have been sprung upon unwary students by

having an unannounced incident occur in the class-

room about which the students are later ques-

tioned. With the element of surprise, it is not too

difficult to force someone to commit a human error.

But this type of test does little to remove from the

student's mind the thought that he would not have

made an error had he not been either concentrating

on the lecture or subjected to the bewilderment of

surprise. To remove this doubt, thus emphasizing

our discussions even more strongly, we announced

that the students were about to witness a skit that

would be enacted in front of the class. We in-

structed the students to take positions where they

could see clearly everything that occurred. Al-

though they were specifically: prohibited from

taking notes during the skit, we warned them that

at the end of the session they would be handed

questionnaires to take home and answer before

coming back to class the next week. Because these

questionnaires required information about the skit,

the students were warned to watch closely and re-

member accurately.

The skit was relatively simple in plot. A masked

man entered the classroom, carrying a suitcase and

flashlight. He placed the suitcase on a chair, exam-

ined the adjacent area with the flashlight, took a

tobacco canister from a table-top and placed it in

the suitcase. Then he erased a drawing of a safe on

the blackboard and re-drew it so that the safe door

was open. Next, he took a drink from one of two

jottles on the desk, closed the suitcase, placed the

flashlight in his pocket, and left the room. A clock

stood ostentatiously on the desk; by its mechan-

ism, the entire skit took approximately two min-

utes.

The next twenty minutes were spent in discuss-

ing other aspects of visio-error, during which time

the skit was not mentioned at all. The question-

naires were handed out; students were asked to

fill them out without additional help from other

students. The class was dismissed.

A week later, twenty-seven questionnaires were

collected at the beginning of the class. Although

the questionnaire had been designed to fulfill a

number of purposes not pertinent tu this article,

some of the questions were simple, direct, and un-

ambiguous. Oddly enough, the answers to these

questions caused the greatest consternation when

[Vol. 51

they were tabulated. The following is a sample of

what we found:

1. What time did the skit begin?—The answers

covered a time-span of twenty-five minutes.

(One officer stated he did not know because

he had no watch, apparently overlooking both

the clock on the desk and the one that hung

on the classroom wall.)

2. How long did theskit take?—Answers covered

a span of two to fifteen minutes.

3. What did the burglar wear for a mask?—27

correct answers.

4. What did he carry in his right hand when he

entered?-Only 10 correct answers out of 27.

5. What did he carry in his left hand when he

entered?-Only 8 correct answers out of 27.

6. What did he carry in his right hand when he

left the room?-Only 17 correct answers out

of 27.

7. What did he carry in his left hand when he

left the room?-Only 1 correct answer out of

8. When, in the course of the action, did he open

the suitcase?-Only 16 correct answers out

of 27.

9. When, in the course of the action, did he look

at his wrist watch?-Only 10 correct answers

out of 27.

The moral of this story was obvious. The stu-

dents who attended our advanced training program

were experienced police officers from a variety of

police and enforcement agencies. Attending this

course of their own volition, they manifested a

healthy and intelligent attitude toward their police

responsibilities. This experiment, limited in nature

and not without some flaws in its own structure,

seemed to indicate rather strongly that many po-

lice officers have not developed the ability to see

accurately, or remember with clarity what they

have seen. Carried out under circumstances which

eliminated the element of surprise and focused at-

tention upon the skit itself, we can only conclude

that at least this aspect of police training needs

further encouragement from our agencies.
