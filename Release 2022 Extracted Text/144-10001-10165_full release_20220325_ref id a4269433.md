Ut is evident: that these sectors planned beforehand to
involve Cuba and the Soviet Union in these deeds.

‘thé inconceivable’ and inexplicable impunity with which~ an.
individual of known penal antecedents assassinated OSWALD, the
principal accused of the. assassination of President KENNEDY, io
the presence of the police themselves’ and in the (5G) of a he

“prison, demonstrates in a scandalous and indisputable manner
that ‘the powerful reactionary polLtical forces within. the =
United States are making use of all their resources and influences
“Jn order ‘to conceal. those who master-minded KENNEDY's ‘assassination

and the true: motives for it.

World public“opinion demands the enlightening of the deeds
It-ig absurd that the political authorithes and-the prosecuting +>
attorney of Dallas have declared that the case is closed when
hardly 48 hours have passed since a deed of so great a‘result’
he assagsination of the President of the United States.
