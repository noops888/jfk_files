I an reproducing below the note siven to the press by the

Ministry:

With relation to the Informat on published today. in the

newspaper Excalsion in Mexico City, affizing that LEp KARVEY:

OSWALD had requested a transit visa for travel to the Soulei

Union at the Cuban Consulate Ir. Mexico in Septenber, the Caban

Governent requested information from the officiala of our de

Consulate in that city confirming that it 1s certain chat

ME. LEE HARVEY OSWALD requested the cransit visa for travelater:

the Soviet Union on 27 September in the said Consulate.

Or being informed by the consular officials that their

office could not

grant such a visa without the authorizacion.

of the Cuban Ministry of Foreign Relations, which Ilkewise

would not grant it if it was not previously authorized by the

country of destination, Mr.. OSWALD Left the Consulate vistöly

disgusted.

Thẹ said visa was never granted.

Ints detail, in connection with thip other circumstances,

most reactionary sectors

Cuban:

3/0/cUD/Tt384-63 :

It 19 evident that these sectors planned beforehand to

involve Cuba and the Soviet Union in these deeds.

The Inconceivable and inexplicable Impunity with which an

individual of known penal entecedents assassinated OSWALD, the.

principal accused of the assassination af President KENNEDY

the presence of the police theselves and in the (5G) of a

prison, demonstrates in a scandalous ind indisputable manner

that the powerful reactionary political forces within the

United States are making use of all their resources and influences

In order to conceal. those who master-minded KENNEDY's assassination,

and the true motives for it.

world public opinion demands the enlightening of the deeds.

It 1s absurd that the political authoritaes and the prosecuting

attorney of Dallas have declared that the case is closed

hardly 48 hours have passed since a deed of so great a result e

the assassination of the President of the United States.
