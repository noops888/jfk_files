2. We have been in recent contact with Edward Scannell’ B Butler, Executive
Vice President and Staff Director, and have received his assurances of. whole-
hearted cooperation in our agency's mission. (Yesterday we examined alf of the
files of correspondence between Hr. Butler and personnel of various radio~
stations in 16 Latin American count ries.| In order to build up a market for
the Truth Tapes program in Latin America, Mr. Butler first obtained from the
appropriate consul in New Orleans a Vist of the radio stations in operation in
his country. He next wrote the administrative personnel of these stations
about the anti-Communist purpose of INCA and offered to supply each station
with Truth Tapes. Those stations requesting them were then provided with a
eries of the tapes. One or two years later, Mr, Sutler sent the participating
station a questionnaire designed to elicit information. about audience response
to the Truth Tapes program, Copies of the first questionnaire and of a revised
tiem one are attached for your information. Judging by the responses we read, the
correspondence files will provide a limited amount of information; dated
hed and 1335, on the identification of radio stations in Latin America which
sting Truth Tages, their addresses, the names of key personnel, the
nti fication of stations not eteseon to the inCA offer, sizes of audiences,
and their cesponses. th: ves the exchange of correspondence

. er, Butter mentioned yeste
estiusnatre, he would welcoae 2: sujgestions about addition.
ested questions desijned to elicit technical information about ‘the station
and its equipment, such as descriptions (manufacturer, type, model) of trans~
mitter, receiver, antenna type and power, frequencies and frequency range, reli-
ability of equipment, normal end emeryency power sources, remote pick-up arrange
ments, etc, We stressed of course that none of these topics should be introduced
Into the questionnaire unless Mr. Butler was convinced of their suitability for
his lmmediate purpose as well as for the long-term propaganda aim of his organi-
zation. He stated that our suzgestions were entireiy proper and, in his opinion,
were reasonable requests that would not arouse the station manager's curiosity.
We pointed out to Nr. Butler that, while information /about key personnel and
their political orientation,) about the station's administrative policies, etc.,
was of prime importance to us, these subjects obviously could not be introduced

into the questfonnaire. He agreed that [t would be bet r_to elicit such infor-
mation in another manner, as he had done -) cum because
of his very heavy responsibilities, he did not me-to-devefop similar
sources of information in each of the other 15 countries. .

4, tt occurs to us that you or a possible consumer could assist us by
suggesting other appropriate topics for Mr. Butler's consideration in the revision
of the questionnaire. We shall appreciate whatever help you can give us In this
regard,

5. in the meantime, as soon as all of Mr. Butler's current correspondence
hes been properly filed, we expect to extract the upprooriate information from
the folders and to present the material in a series of 09-3 reports.
