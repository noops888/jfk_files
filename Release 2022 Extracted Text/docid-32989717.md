EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT

As consideration for employment in the Federal Bureau of Investigation (F'BI), United

States Department of Justice, and as a condition for continued employment, I hereby declare

that I intend to be governed by and I will comply with the following provisions:

(1) That I am hereby advised and I understand that Federal law such as

Title 18, United States Code, Sections 793, 794, and 798; Order of the

President of the United States (Executive Order 11652); and regulations•

issued by the Attorney General of the United States (28 Code of Federal

Regulations, Sections 16.21 through 16.26) prohibit loss, misuse, or un-

authorized disclosure or production of national security information, other

classified information and other nonclassified information in the files of

(2) I understand that unauthorized disclosure of information in the files

of the FBI or information I may acquire as an employee of the FBI could

result in impairment of national security, place human life in jeopardy, or

result in the denial of due process to a person or persons who are subjects

of an FBI investigation, or prevent the FBI from effectively discharging its

responsibilities. I understand the need for this secrecy agreement; there-

fore, as consideration for employment I agree that I will never divulge,

publish, or reveal either by word or conduct, or by other means disclose to

any unauthorized recipient without official written authorization by the

• Director of the FBI or his delegate, any information from the investigatory

files of the FBI or any information relating to material contained in the files,

or disclose any information or produce any material acquired as a part of the

performance of my official duties or because of my official status.

The burden

is on me to determine, prior to disclosure, whether information may be disclosed

and in this regard I agree to request approval of the Director of the FBI in each

such instance by presenting the full text of my proposed disclosure in writing to

the Director of the FBI at least thirty (30) days prior to disclosure. I understand

that this agreement is not intended to apply to information which has been placed

in the public domain or to prevent me from writing or speaking about the FBI but

it is intended to prevent disclosure of information where disclosure would be

contrary to law, regulation or public policy. I agree the Director of the FBI is

in a better position than I to make that determination;

(3) I agree that all information acquired by me in connection with my official

duties with the FBi and all official material to which I have access remains

the property of the United States of America, and I will surrender upon demand

by the Director of the FBI or his delegate, or upon separation from the FBI, any

material relating to such information or property in my possession;

(4) That I understand unauthorized disclosure may be a violation of Federal

law and prosecuted as a criminal offense and in addition to this agreement may

be enforced by means of an injunction or other civil remedy.

I accept the above provisions as conditions for my employment and continued employment

in the FBI. I agree to comply with these provisions both during my employment in the FBI and

following termination of such employment.

Memorandum

TO

MR. BELMONT

DATE: October 25, 1963

FROM :

C. A. EVANS

SUBJECT:

COMMUNISM AND THE

NEGRO MOVEMENT

The Attorney General telephoned at approximately 10:15 a.m.

He advised that he had tried to call the Director who was temporarily out of

, the building. The Attorney General stated he had just learned that the Army

had received a copy of a report submitted to the Attorney General about the

communist activities of Martin Isther King. The Attorney. General Was reic, 2ag

to the report captioned "Communism and the Negro Movement -- A Current.

Analyses, " dated Cctober 16, 1963.

There is no question this is the report

Ito which he is referring.

althougn he persisted on calling it the report on the

/communist background of Martin Luther King.

The Attorney General said he would like to know what other

assemination was made of this report in addition to the Army and the purpose

for such dissemination. He was coviously irritated. He went on to ask i the

Army got copies of all reports submitted to him. I told the Attorney Ceneral that

obviously the Army did not get copies of all reports we sent to him personally,

but that there were hundreds of reports that did go to the Army that did not

concern matters of sufficient importance to warrant the Attorney General's persona?

attention. I pointed out to him that we regularly submitted some type of reports

in matters of current interest under our internal Security jurisdiction, and that

dissemination of these summaries was made to the military authorities as well

as other top governmental officials because of responsibilities they have in this

connection.

1.

The Attorney General asked what responsibilities the Army had in

[relation to the communist background of Martin Luther King. I told the Attorney

General the report went beyond this and that the Army had an interest in communist

lactivities particularly in relation to racial matters because the military had to be

calloa on if civil disturbances arising out of such matters went beyond the ability

•of the civilian authorities.

This explanation seemed to serve no purpose.' The Attorney General

said he still could not understand why we sent a report to the Army on King's

communist acrivities. He reiterated his request for information as to the dissemina

tion of the report in question and the purpose for it.

INTERNAL SECURITY - COMKUNIST

This memorandum reconmends that the National Science

Foundation (NST) be furnished information concerning

communist influence exerted on the Southern Christian Leadership

Conference (SCIC) and its President, Di. Martin Luther King, Jr:

This appears necessary since the SCIC has been contacted by the

NSE for the purpose of obtaining applicants for southern schools:

has furnished information that

desired qualified applicants to enter the University of

and other schools in southern states where the NSf has its

was advised that the NSf was

groups to handle the beeriment program for degre students since

they did not want it to appear that the iSf as attempting ta

put legro applicants in southern schools.

was advised that each qualified applicant

Föuld receive a $3,000 scholarship fron the IST. Since this

is a Government project any expenses incurred in this matter

"would not come out of anyone's pocket."

This would adicate

that any expenses incurred by the SCIC in their recruitment

effort would be paid for with Government funds.

The communist influences exerted on King are well

known. to the Bureau.

RE: COLLINIST INTILTRATION OF

SOUTHERN CHRISTIAN LEADERSHIP CONFERENCE

U. S. Govern ent are involved. The Atlanta Office has

recommended hat

be

advised con erning this matter. This appears inadvisable

since such ction could conceivably cause repercussions which

would only ggravate the racial siuation that exists in the

South.

It 1s felt that Dr. Leland J. Hanorth, Director,

NSI, should be furnished information regarding

communist

influences exerted

on the SCIC and King. In this regard

re iccently disseminated to the White House and the

heads of the intolligence community copies of a "Top Secret"

sunmary entitled

"Conmunism and the liegro llovenent--A

Current Analysis" which contains infomation regarding the

SCiC aId king.

BACKGROUND:

On my recent inspection of the Legal Attache office

our conversation, it was quite apparent that Ambassador

Christian Leadership Conference.

In November of 1964, interested officials of the

Government, including the Honorable Dean Rusk, Secretary of

State, were furnished copies of the monograph

entitled,

communism and the Nearo Movement - A Current Analysis

It is felt that Ambassador Johnson, because of his

position,

should be made aware of communist infiltration into

King's group, and the influence being exerted on King.

Ambassador Johnson is a former Deputy Secretary of*

State and has been extremely cooperative and

. SECURITY MATTER - C

DATE: 2/29/68

Mr. Tolson has suggested, and the Director agreed,

that the monograph on Martin Luther King,. JI., be brought

•up to date.

.. This is an excellent suggestion and we have already

started the necessary research. Bringing this monograph up to

date and disseminating it at high level prior to King's "Wash-

ington Spring Project" should serve again to remind top-level

officials in Government of the wholly disreputable charactes

of King. 7

As you know, King's "Washington Spring Froject" was

originally scheduled

for early April, 1968. However, our

Washington Field Office has developed information that King's

group is experiencing difficulty in secruiting individuals

to participate in the demonstration and the date for the project

" has now tentatively been set for April 27, 1968.

Because of the importance of doing a thorough job on:

this, we will conduct an exhaustive file review to bring togethe

the most complete and up-to-date information and to present it

in a hard-hitting manner. Io make the brief timely, we will

have it completed

and

ready for dissemination by March 14, 1968

RE: CONIUNIST INCILTRATION OF

SOUTHERN CHRISTIAN LEADERSHIP CONFERENCE

U. S. Government are Involved. The Atlanta Office has

recommended that

be

advised concerning this matter. This appears inadvisable

since such action could conceivably cause repercussions which

would only aggravate the racial situation that exists in the

south.

It is felt that Dr. Leland J. Haworth, Director,

NSI, should be furnished infornation regaiding

communist

influences exerted on the SCIC and King. In this regard

we recently disseninated to the White House and the

heads of the intelligence community copies of a "Top Secret"

summary entitled "Conmunism and the legro llovement--A

Current

Analysis" which contains information regarding the

SCIC and King.

This summary deals with King's conmunist

connections and his porsonal immoral activities. With the

receipt of this summary by Dr. Haworth, the SCIC would

undoubtedly be removed arom thA NST

arngram to obtain qualified

Regro students for southern schools.

The information concerning the SCIC participation

in the NSF program is being sepazately disseminated to the

Department and interested intelligence agencies.

E:) CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY (CIA) - DOMESTIC CONTACT

SERVICE -- You previously have been informed regarding CIA's Contact

Division which has had offices in various U. S. cities and which is openly

identified as being connected with CIA. This division has been responsible

• for the overt collection of positive intelligence gained through interviews of

aliens, travelers, businessmen, etc. The division has not been engaged

in any operational activity such as the development of double agents. For

your information, CIA has reorganized this division and it is now called

the Domestic Contact Service.

An examination of CIA s activities in the area of overt collection

oi positive intelligence has indicated that the Bureau can strengthen its

position by having our field offices establish direct contact with the local

oilices of the Domestic Contact Service. This particularly applies to those

situations where the Bureau and CIA both have an interest in Soviet-bloc

and lugoslav nationals, excluding those who are connected with embassies

or the United Nations. We recognize that CIA has a responsibility for.

collection of positive intelligence (i. e. information regarding Soviet-bloc

capability in a particular research field) which might be acquired from

such visitors hit we rannot condone any CIA actirity which might

interfere with Bureau operations. - You therefore are authorized to

establish liaison with local offices of the Domestic Contact Service.

Lloya N. Cutler,

Dear Mr. Cutler:

Pursuant to our discussions concerning the disposition of

certain records relating to the surveillance activities

directed at your client, Mr. Joseph Kraft, the Department

is making the following temporary arrangements:

I. Pending further vepartmental action relating

to the policies which will govern records of the

üype invulved in li. Kraft's case, all. documenta,

recordings, or other records of any type in the

Department'

s.custody of control which constitute,

summarize, or describe the contents of the over-

hearings obtained

as the result of any electronic

surveillance directed against Mr. Kraft and mem-

bers of his family will be placed under seal.

As long as the items described above remain

under seal, no official or employee of the Depart-

ment will have access to them or any purpose, and

no official or employee of the Department will

allow any person outside of the Department to have

any such access, except as described below. The

only material referring to these items will be a

single index card needed to locate the sealed iters.

The index card

will bear only Mr. Kraft's name and

a file number.

3.

Should some future need which we do not now

foresee require any official or employee of the

Department to obtain of permit access to the

aforesaid

items, the decision on such"accéss shall

be made personally by the Attorney General. The

Attorney Ceneral

shall not grant any access without

notifying MI. Kraft or his counsel in writing at

least ten days prior thureto, and providing him of

## Page 108

then an opportunity to discuss the matter per-

-sonally with the Attorney General before the

grant is made.

The notice shall set forth the

date upon which access will be permitted if it is

granted, and the purpose for which and person by

whon access is sought.

The Attorney General will

personally inform MI. Kraft or his counsel of a

decision to grant access as soon as practicable.

after it is made, but in any event at least five

business days before access occurs.

4.

Although this arrangement is not intended to

constitute a permanent solution to the questions

you have raised concerning these documents, it

will not be rescinded or modified by the Attorney •

General or his successors unless the Attorney Gen-

eral gives fir. Kraft or his counsel ten days'

prior notice and affords him or them an opportun-

ity to discuss the matter personally with the

Atiorney General before he rescinds or modifies

the agicamara.

Is the httornay Caneral then

decides to rescind or modify this agreement he

shall. personally Intorm fit:

Kraft or his counsel

of that decision at least five business days before

lit is implemented.

As a result of our discussions, I understand that this

temporary arrangement is acceptable to Mr. Kraft, of coursa

without waiver of any. legal rights he may have as a result

of prior surveillances.

As I advised you, we are working

now on genoral policy dcterminations which, we hope, will

offer a permanent solution to the problem this settles temp-

orarily.

Of course, under the terms of this agreement we

will notify you of any policy determination which would

involve a modification of this agreement.

Until a final policy is determined, this agreement shoula

assure Mr. Kidit that no person will read or otherwise use

these Secuments in

any. manner so long as they remain under

UBJECT: RELATIONS WITH CIA

!.

• .

Reference is made to my letter of 3/2/70. I made the

statement, "Unfortunately., CIA also belieres that in the past

we did not always act in a forthright manner, and the Agency

undoubtedly could present a list of grievances." It is my

understanding that you want such grievances identified. There

1s enclosed herewith a list of cases or situations which arose

over the years.

Based upon a review of files and my personal recollectio=

this list would be representative of matters which CIA could use

for making charges such

aS:

not being forthright, not playing

fairly and

squarely, not cooperating, not being of assistance,

not recognizing the

need for concrete FBI contributions to the

foreign intelligence effort.

What CIA may have compiled over the i

years is unknown.

What situations are known to CIA and have not

come to our attention cannot be answered at this time. I am

thinking of leaks including distorted information which may have

been passed to CIA from ex-Bureau employees and CIA informants

and sources;

It should be clearly emphasized that there is no

indication whatsoever within CIA that the Agency has been seeking

say kind of a showdown or confrontation with the FBI. Contrary,

to what some people may believe, the relationship between the

two agencies up to the recent crisis was never better despite

the problems which have arisen from time to time. I am confident

that a thorough and impartial examination will conclusively

support the foregoing.

In order that there may not"be any misunderstanding, 1t

is important to emphasize that the Bureau can also produce an

extensive list of justified grievances. Ne can also produce an'

excellent record of support which we have given CIA; presumably

CIA could do the same. There are ingredients for continuing

conflict and there is also adequate machinery for maintaining

sound working relations and producing badly needed intolligence

information.

RE: RELATIONS H

Director A-pET

H CIA

-

I belleve that it would be most helpful to you and

interested

Bureau officials when evaluating and passing judgment

on the attached material if we analyzed very briefly the role

of the Bureau liaison Agent. A liaison Agent can be a simple

mail courier or be can be the true Bureau Agent ready to confront

any problem or issue with anotheragency, very often working with

very limited information. It is expected that the Bureau Agent

carry out his instructions forcefully and efficiently. He must

be prepared to handle all types of personalities under various

conditions.

He must be alert for pitfalls and express himself

in a most judicious and prudent manner but

always making certain

that the Bureau position is well fortified.

In evaluating the attached and my encounters with CIA,

It should be noted that protests from the Bureau always were

easy

to handle because the Agent

had f. Edgar Hoover behind him.

However, when an Agent struck at :an official on one day and

solicited his cooperation the next day, it did require some

resourceful action.

It is believed that other liaison Agents

regularly encounter similar situations.

On numerous occasions

I have bittorly feuded with CIA ofcicials and this has included

rough language. I have walked out on CIA officials when I felt

they were unreasonable. They took the initiative by asking the

Agent to return.

I did try to play fairly and squarely with all

of them and never hesitated to accept a confrontation; this inclue.

the Director of the Agency.

When

I lectured to CIA personnel

over the years I always made a point to challenge them to present

any grievances or raise any subject matter relating to the

• Bureau. I never left a discussion with any CIA official without

being positive that our position was absolutely understood.

The approaches utilized by me might be open to criticism.

I

can only refer, to the records of the Bureau and CIA and

I believe

the Bureau's position is most favorable. I don't think CIA has

ever transmitted a letter of protest to the Bureau during the

eighteen years during which the Agent handled the assignment.

•CASES AND/OR SITUATIONS

INVOLVING CONFLICTS WITH THE

CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY (CIA)

(1) MOCASE. (THE BORIS MORROS CASE) •

This was a sensitive Soviet-espionage case

which originated in 1943 and terminated for the most

part in 1957. The case had many wide loreign ramifi-

cations and historically has been, and undoubtedly

will be, one of the most important. and involved cases

of Soviet operations in this country and abroad.

He

did not disseminate any iniormation of significance

In this case until 1954. On various occasions wher

the Liaison Agent has become involved in heated argu-

ments with CIA officials, they have seen fit to raise

this case as an outstanding example of FBI failure to

cooperate with the Agency. The position taken by CIA

sas that it should have been advised regarding the

Soviet operational activity in foreign countries,

claiming that the Agency would have had the opportunity

to develop more information of significance, identify

Soviet agents, and possibly prepare conditions for

recruitment or doubling of Soviet operatives. He did

not disseminate our reports to CIA because of the

extreme sensitivity of the case.

We actually did not

permit CIA to handle any investigations relating to

the MOCASE until 1957.

In 1957, CIA complained that it certainly had

every right to have received the information earlier

because many aspects of the MOCASE pertained to CIA

employees and operations. CIA further argued that it

had been greatly handicapped in effectively carrying out

the leads in 1957 because the leads were given to the

Agency at the same time that the case was publicized.

The Agency argued that the failure of the Bureau to

coordinate with CIA those French aspects of the case

permitted the french, rather than the U. s., to play &

dominating role in Europe.

With regard to dealing with the French, we

took the position that we would cover the leads through

our Legal Attaches wherever possible and to furnish

leads to CIA in those countries where we did not have

Legal Attaches. CIA maintained that since we were on

record that our Legal Attaches do not handle operations

abroad, the sureau had an obligation to levy those French

leads on CIA or at least coordinate with the Agency .

before going to the French.

it is to be noted that in any argument relating

to jurisdiction in this matter, CIA will fall back on the

responsibilities placed on the

Agency under the provisions

of the National Security Act of 1947 and the implementation

of the Loregoing through National Security Council Dire-

tives. CIA will maintain that' it is incumbent upon the

Bureau to recognize the provisions of the National Security

Act of 1947 and the Directives.

The Agency would argue

that in the MOCASE, these were ignored by the Bureau.

(3) THE ABEL CASE

Although CIA has not raised the point for

several years, the prevailing attitude was; and probably

still exists,

that the FBI did not play it square with

CiA in the Abel case by not making certain that the

Agency Has given the proper recognition for its contri-

butions. CIA feels that in the first place, there would

not have been any U. S. access or availability to the

(6) BUREAU HANDLING OF CIA REQUESTS FOR TOURS

FOR FOREIGN OFFICIALS

On occasions in the 1950's,

"CIA complained that

officials visiting the U. S. under CIA sponsorship were

given excellent treatment on the tour but, nevertheless,

many of the visitors left most disappointed because they

had not had any contact with any Bureau officials.

CIA

felt that contact with Bureau officials had very

significant

benefits and left lasting favorable impressions because of

the FBI's worldwide reputation.

CIA also pointed out that

when foreign visitors had no contact with Bureau officials,

they were left with the suspicion that there was some kind

of friction between the FBI and CIA..

In 1956, we had a

clear-cut policy to the effect that

tours for

such visi-

tors would be of a restrictive nature in that such

visitors would view our facilities normally seen by the

public and

past.

In addition, we have learned more about these

countries, their services, and their sécurity chiefs

• by spending a few minutes with them. Needless to say,

this kind of treatuent has also inmeasurably helped

our Legal Attaches.

(7) CIA - DUTCH INTEREST IN SOVIET ESPIONAGE ACTIVITY

In 1965, the. Dutch Internal Security Service

was in the process of investigating individuals in

Holland who allegedly had been engaged in Soviet-espionage

activity. The Dutch wanted to have certain individuals

1n the U. S. Interviewed and approached CIA to make

Inquiry at the Bureau. At that time, our relations

with the Dutch had been practically nonezistent because

can Dutch had ale to restly deal with us ia the

who had been

clandestinely collecting intelligence at the National

Security Agency. Then CIA approached us, we-told

the Agency that the dutch could submit their request

through-diplonatic channels. He subsequently told CIA

we would not handle the interviews for the Dutch. Ne

stuck to our position. CIA surrendered but felt that

we were impairing their efforts to gather infornation

concerning Soviet-espionage activities in Europe.

last several years, it is not believed that there is

any basis for complaint since we have regularly been

notifying CIA concerning subjects of cases who travel

abroad.

If the Legal Attache is investigating, CIA is

notified in order to avoid duplicate efforts. There

have been exceptions where we have taken the position

that CIA should not be notified because of the sensitivity

of the matter. How many such exceptions are known to

CiA cannot be established Iron our files; however, we

3hould boar in mind that when nur legal Attaches inves.

(12) BUREAU OPERATIONS IN BRAZIL -

In YEAR the U. S. Ambassador in Brazil accused

our Legal Attache of engaging in uncoordinated covert

intelligence activity "of a nature which I believe

exceeds his terms of reference."

The Ambassador further

indicated that. CIA was unhappy over-the Legal Attache's

activities and the Agency allegedly had told the Ambassador

that the Legal Attache had disseminated information from

& source who was a fabricator or a provocator. This

situation arose as a result of

the Legal Attaches

operation of an informant in Brazil. Some of the

Information that he received from the informant was

of a derogatory nature and related to a Brazilian who

was being touted as a Presidential candidate.

CIA

asked for the identity of the informant and we told

the Agency that the person could not be identified

because he did not wish that his identity be disclosed.

This case is being cited because CIA may have evidence

that we had been operational in Brazil, had not coordi-

nated pursuant to Directives, and that the matter was

further aggravated because of the alleged unreliability

of the information.

Readquarters.

This matter is being highlighted because

authorities. He have no evidence or reason to

believe that the Legal Attache Office ever involved itself

in any such leak.

In connection with alleged Forelay espionage

(18) LEAKS TO THE '"NATIONAL REVIEW" - 1959

In April, 1959, CIA became concerned over the

appearance of certain items in issues of the "National

an unidentified individual who was making derogatory

references

to CIA. CIA subsequently identified the

author as

may have additional data not revealed.

(19) TRAVEL OF BUREAU INTORMANTS TO CUBA

In September, 1965, we received information

indicating that oneof our informants on the Mexican border

was in a position to travel to Cuba. A question was raised

concerning CIA interest in this matter, 1f the informant

made the trip. It was recommended and approved that we

not advise CIA concerning the identity of the informant

his trip to Cuba.

It Is not known if CIA acquired any knowledge

but, if the Agency did, we potentially are vulnerable.

The Agency could charge that we were operating outside

of the U. S. and we failed to coordinate with the Agency.

(20) DISSEHINATION OF CIA INFORMATION IN A BUREAU MONOGRAPH

By letter dated May 5, 1965, we disseminated to

Interested agencies, including CIA, a copy of 2 monograph

graph contained considerable information which had emanated

from CIA.. We did not obtain clearance from CIA for

the inclusion ofthis information in our monograph.

Clearance approval was not obtained because of the

urgency of the document. CIA was irritated because

Denmark, Norway, Sweden, and Holland.

We did not inform

obligation of coordinating with the Agency.

(28) COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES - AFRICA

In April, 1960, CIA inquired 1f the Bureau would

give any consideration to assisting the Agency toward

developing coverage in Africa. CIA was looking for the

services of any Negro informant who might be available.

The Agency also inquired about placing a Negro in the

Communist Party, USA, under a plan which would have as

an eventual objective; the sending of the informant to

Africa under an appropriate cover and for an extended

period. We told CIA we had no informants available

because they were necessary for our own operations. We

took the position that we saw no benefit to be gained by

Loaning an informant on a short of long term basis.

This item is being mentioned because Africa

has become vitally important to U. S. interest, bearing

in mind that both the

Soviets and Chinese Communists have

made significant inroads into the area.

CIA could argue

that as early as 1960, it had the foresight to recognize

the need for additional coverage, that it appealed to the

Bureau for assistance, and that we did not cooperate.

(29) ADVISING THE WHITE HOUSE REGARDING CRITICISM

OF INTELLIGENCE OPERATIONS - EUROPB

By letter dated October 23, 1964, we furnished

the White House information received

SOUPCE

He was critical

reference to the overstaffing of personnel.

He do not know if CIA became cognizant of the

existence of the Bureau letter bearing in mind that the

allegations made by NAME

Interviewed in detail concerning these allegations.

By

letter dated February 26, 1965, we officially advised CIA

that there appeared to be no basis at this time for a

full investigation of the individuals involved.

There are officials in CIA who continue to be

seriously concerned about possible penetrations of the

'agency and have not discarded NAME'S

allegations.

He do not have any reason to believe that CIA

has developed any substantive evidence to support NAME'S

allegations.

If It does, me could be vulnerable and could

be charged that we did not cooperate and conduct the

necessary investigation in 1965.

(32) VICE PRESIDENT NIXON'S TRIP TO SOUTE AMERICA - 1958

In 1958; Vice President Richard M. Nison traveled

to Latin America during which time there were numerous riots

and attacks which were directed against the Vice President

jand his party. By letter dated May 16, 1958, we provided

the Vice President with a summary of information which we

had received concerning the events in Latin America relating

to the trip.

Most of this information came from CIA.

Our letter could be interpreted as raising, the question

concerning the quality of CIA's coverage in Latin America.

•It is not known if CIA ever became knowledgeable

of the referenced communication. As already indicated,

we do know that CIA personnel have been assigned to the

White House.

We also know that

TITLE

'NAME AND

CIA, was attached to Vice

President Nixon's staff.

If CIA is cognizant of the communication, the

Agency technically could raise a question concerning a

violation of the third agency rule and, furthermore,

could question the Bureau's propriety of making reierence

to CIA's coverage in Latin America,.

The captioned individual is a criminal infor-

mani won we have been utilizing to very significant advan-

tage in New York City. He has been the source of valuable

Although

the Agency has never officially made any statement to us,

It has been bitterly disappointed that the Bureau never

acknowledged CIA's assistance which the Agency considered

extremely valuable.

(34) EXCHANGE OF TECHNICAL INFORHATION

For many years, we maintained tight restrictions

with regard to the exchange of technical information with

CIA, particularly as it related to the technical surveillance

field.

CIA exhibited its equipment to us but, for many years,

ve declined to show any of our devices, with some exceptions.

NW 65360 Docld:32989717 Page 131

CIA never made any official protest but informally

Indicated from time to time that the lack of exchange

in this highly important field was prejudicial to over-

all intelligence and internal security interests.

The

Agency implied that we actually were more open with the

British in this general area than we were with CIA.

It should be noted that the foregoing situation

does not exist today. There is good exchange between the

Bureau and CIA.

(35) CIA LECTURERS AT BUREAU TRAINING SCHOOLS

CIA has never been able to understand why the

Bureau will not permit CIA personnel to lecture at Bureau

schools or training courses.

CIA has felt that through

a careful selection of lecturers, the Agency could make

a very valuable contribution both to the Bureau and to

CIA.

The Agency has indicated that its participation in

some of our courses would give the Agency the opportunity

to acocribo CIA's organization, objcotivoo, and opcrational

problems. Furthermore, it has

been expressed that Bureau

personnel could be given the opportunity to pose questions

and there would be a far better over-all orientation on

the part of our people.

The Liaison Agent has always resisted CIA's

request.

It has been a delicate matter to handle because

Bureau personnel have lectured to hundreds of CIA employees.

(36) EXCHANGE IN THE TRAINING FIELD

Although CIA has never officially made an issue

of the matter, the Agency has not been happy about our

attitude concerning exchange of information in the training

field. When the matter has been broughtup for any discussion

by CIA, the Agency has been discouraged.

CIA informally has

expressed the feeling that an exchange along certain guide-

lines could be most useful to the U. S. intelligence and

Internal security effort.

(37) POSITIVE INTELLIGENCE

This is an area where discussion with CIA

officials can rapidly generate criticisn of the Bureau

for failure to cooperate and offer the necessary assis-

tance. Positive intelligence, briefly, is that information

which might assist the U. S. Government in formulating

foreign policy.: Much' of it is of a political nature and

a vital portion pertains to scientific developments, military

capabilities of foreign countries, and intentions of foreign

countries.

Positive intelligence is rot only important

as it concerns the communist-bloc countries but also

the non-bloc nations.

There never has been any'lay, Directive, or

Executive Order which has fixed the responsibilities for

••

the clandestine collection of positive intelligence in

the U.S. The Bureau does have a responsibility which

we refer to as internal security and which falls into the

accepted area of counterintelligence. We do investigate

subversives, spys, and we develop penetrations of foreign

Intelligence services.

Our work in the positive intelli-

gence field, for the most part, has been restricted to

the compliance of requests imposed upon us by the State

Department, usually when a political crisis occurs in

some country.

• CIA has maintained that there is a tremendous

unexplored

field for expanded acqutrement of positive

intelligence in the U. S.

This would nean vastly increased

technical surveillance coverage,

; development of informants,

and collection of cryptographic material.

CIA does not

feel that we have aggressively moved on this particular

subject and that over the years, the gency has been

thwarted in its attempts to do much about the problem.

In DATE

Install technical surveillances at the offices and temporary

CIA has never made any official comment or

protest but it has considered the afore-mentioned action

by the Bureau as unfriendly and uncooperative. The Agency

has looked to the Bureau as the logical point of contact and

as the only organization having the lesources and capabilities

of adequately determining i such coverage is even feasible.

(38) MISCELLANEOUS ITEMS

The Liaison Agent recalls fragments of other

situations or conflicts which occured over the years and

which resulted in the voicingof ClA displeasure or criticism.

The Agent cannot recall the names of the cases which is

necessary to acquire the required data. There was one

instance early in the 1950's which involved information

received from a source of unknown reliability charging

Allen Dulles with having

2050% into, bata.

been a communist and a spy while

1n Europe.. He disseminated the information to several

agencies. Dulles exploded but never lodged a protest.

The Agent also has recollection of instances when

CIA alleged that its source or informant was compromised by

Bureau revelation of CIA information during the course of

Interviews conducted by us. Technically, this would be a

violation of the third agency rule and, if CIA had hard

core facts, we would be vulnerable, particularly if an

Important informant was lost. CIA never made any official

Issue or protest.

: Honorable Richard Helms.

Director

Cashing in, i gence Agency

Dear Mr. Helms:

As I am sure you will agree, the need for close

coordination of the intelligence-gathering ansfounter-

Intelligence efforts of the rBi and the Central Intelligence

тона

Agency (CIA) is self-evident. This

matter. is one which

requires a continuing analysis to assure that both agencies

have established working agreements whereby we can most

effectively realize positive results with a minimum of

duplication, misplaced effort, and jurisdictional problems.

During January, 1966, representatives of this

Bureau met with officials of the CIA to consider coordina-

tion of our mutual efforts in the collection of positive

intelligence in the United States. As a result of these

conferences, a set of ground rules was drawn.up and agreed

to by both agencies. A copy of this agreement was transmitted

In my letter of February 7, 1966, to then CIA Director

Vice Admiral William F. Reborn, JI. A copy of the agreement

is enclosed for your information. ' This agreement has proven

generally effective and no major problens have been

encountered since its adoption in the areas it covers.

=.. The FBI has primary responsibility with regard to

matters involving the internal security of the United States

as well as for conducting counterintelligance operations in

this country. While this Bureau does not have any statutory

responsibilities with regard to the collection of foreign

Intelligence, I have always recognized that the potential

for the development of such intelligence in this country 1s

considerable.

The FBI has, in fact, made a concerted effort

to obtain positive intelligence of value to other U.S.

intelligence agencies, including the CIA, and policy-making

officials of the Goverment. While these efforts have,

of course, been incidental to our main internal security

and counterintelligence responsibilities, we have on a

selective -basis developed sources, both live and technical,

providing coverage at key foreign establishments in the

United States. The product of this coverage has been furnished

on a regular basis to the CIA and other interested agencies

and ufficials uf the Guverimeni:

I know that you will share my belief that this

matter requires a periodic reexamination to assure that the

national security interests continue, to be served in the

most effective and complete manner possible. After reviewing

this matter, Including the attached 1966 agreement, I-would

welcome any observations you may desire to make.

sincerely yours,

J. Edgar Hoover
