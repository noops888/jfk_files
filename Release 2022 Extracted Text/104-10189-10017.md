SEA-57-68

DATE: 7 February 1968

Alleged Anti-CIA Couments made by Priests at Seattle University

Denver memorandum DEN-51-68, dated 1 February 1968, with attachment

1. You will find attached i copy of a Memorandum for the Record

dated 31 January 1968 and written by Don Jordan of the Denver Office.

The text of the memorandum needs no further explanation.

2. I made a cursory check with local sources who were unable to

confirm or deny the allegations made by Mrs. Margaret Fanning, nother

of Mias Clare Loulse Panning who is currently a student at Seattle

Since the matter is not cxactly in our ken 'and might be

of interest to the PBI I made a digest of the original memorandum and

gave a copy to the Seattle FBI Office. A copy of. the digest was also

given to Mr. William Barrus, CIA. O/S, Seattle Resident Agent.

of the digest is atrached.

Seattle FBI Office said that they probably

take any action but would pass the information along to their

headquarters in Washington DC.

In all probability the information

will be attributed to the Seattle Field Office.

3.

I made a further check with Colonel Michael J. Dolan, Place-

ment Officer, Seattle University, to determine if he had heard arything

about the subject matter on

the campus.

Colonel Dolan works with Mr.

Thomas L. Culhane, CLA, OP/RD. Mr. Culhane says that Colonel Dolan

can be trusted to be discreet in any dealings that we might have with

hio.

Colonel Dolan was unable to give me any Information of a sub-

stantive nature regarding Subject but stated that Miss Panning 18

having academic problems and her grade point has gone down steadily

since enrollment at Seattle University.

Her present courses are all

aught by laymen so if she has any contact with the Jesuit priests th

contact would be outside of the classroom.

It was Colonel Dolan',

opinion that the university administration would be very interested in

running down information of the nature outlined by Mrs. Fanning.

Colonel Dolan has stated he will make some discreet inquiries without

implicating either Mrs. or Miss Fanning.

MEHORANDUM FOR THIS RECORD

SUBJECT:

Call fros Mis: Marzaret Panning Regardirig Ant1-CIA seeIvity

at the Univerally of Seattle

1. On 18 January 1968; 1100 hours, the Denver Office recesved a

call'on the listed number frou a ioman who identified herself ao

Mis. Margaret Fanning.

"Hra. Fanning stated that she lives is pueblo

and that at the cise of the call she was at Stapleton Alrport enrouto

to Texas.:" MIs. Fanning'a readon for calling us was her great concern

about what her daughter, Clase, 1s being taught about the ClA and the

Kennedy assassination at the University of Scatcle shere Clare 18 a

student.

2.

Mrs. Fanning has received several telephone calls recently

from Clare in which Clare Inforzed her mother that some of the pileste

at the University of Seattle (a Jeault school) had convinced tse studenta

that Carrison's cheories about the assassination are correct and that the

charges about the Agency's topilcation are also correct.

3.

Mrs. Fanning stated that her daughter is actually afraid of the

CIA and conaiders that the ClA 1s

comparable to the Gestapo.

Kis. Fanning

acated that she cried to persuade Clare that what she (the dauzater) had

heard 1s totally untrue but Mrs. Panning had no succesa whatsoever in

changing her daughter's vleupoint.

4.

Mrg. Fanning also atated that Clare asked her to be sure not

to repeat to anyone any of the foregoing information and that the prlests

at Seattle University had Instructed their students not to discuss these

matters with their parents.

MIs. Fanning was obviously nost upset that

a faculty member at a university, particularly a priest, had instructed

students not to discuss matters presented to chea at the school with their

parents.

In this cornection, I suggested to Mrs. Fanning thai she posalbly

id legitimate grievance agalnst the school and that she aight drite

ter to the president on this particular ltes

'. I also pointad out to her that li there 1s in progress at che

niversity of seattle activity shich could be construed as a chreat t

HIA which is apparently being disseminated at the University of Seattle

but pointed out that there is very little we can do about such =atters.
