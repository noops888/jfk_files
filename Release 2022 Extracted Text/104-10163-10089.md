dical doctor, who resides in exile in the US. Sinca +
1962, he has be sociated with active anti-GOC organizations in the
US and chroughout Latin America.

(this report was developed by an Army representative assigned to the office
of preparation, :

1. Late in 1965, General Anastacio Somoza, Director, Nationsl Guard of Nicarsgua,
patient in Baltimore's John Hopkins Hospital for approxi:
ted the General at the hospital in two occasions
appearance; he was 4 very sick man, He was ouffering
had had @ nervoue breakdown, As part of the treatment,
he was pleced on @ very strict diet, and advised to stop drinking. Presently,
\) 7, Somoza fe following the diet religiously; he takes « sugar substitute
oath his coffee, and has drastically curtailed his drinking. Apparently
yt s \. the diet hee been successful, for Somoza has lost much weight.

In February 1966, I visited Nicaragua and called on General Somoza on & fae
‘ business matter. Ha appeared healty, strong and was in jovial spirite.
\ We discussed politics ; and his presidential candidacy for next years elace
sthons, He fe confident about the outcome of the elections; there is no
: “doubt in hie mind that he will bs the next President of Nicaragua.

3. In my opinion, behind the confidence and optimism is the nagging fact
i oc. thet the Somosa, name is eutetatically. identified with dictatorenips. He

: would Like to change the image the Somoza name has creates. throughout

4 Latin America, This is his real motivation in seeking the presidency, and
abandoning the dizcctership of the 4onal Gerd. He refoices in the

dact that President Shick, @ duly mt, WLLL sotye his ful?

fa - term and will be succeeded by another elected president. Somoza has ell
intentions of stepping aside at the end of his tere in favor 7f the’ Chen
i : ; ected president. He desires the Somoze ‘name'to be synonys of prosperity, ~,
stability and democracy in Nécaragua, : 7
