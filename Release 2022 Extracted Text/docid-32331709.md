General VINCENT P. RUSSO and WILLIAM A. GALLAGHER have recently :
been assigned by the Department to assist the Denver Office of the
U. S. Attorney in trying a number of pending cases in U. S. District
Court in Denver. After reviewing this case Mr. RUSSO and Mr.
GALLAGHER in discussing the matter with the reporting agent stated
that in their opinion former Assistant U. S. Attorney. JOSEPH N.
LILLY should have included a conspiracy count in drawing the original
indictment against SNELL which was returned by a Federal Grand Jury
in Denver on June 2, 1952. It was for this reason that Mr. GALLAGHER
and Mr. RUSSC re-presented the SNELL case to a Federal Grand Jury

opinion that the case against SNELL can be successfully prosecuted.
