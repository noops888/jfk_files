ADMINISTRATIVE PAGE

For the information of the Bureau, Special Assistants to the Attorney

General VINCENT P. RUSSO and WILLIAM A. GALLAGHER have recently

been assigned by the Department to assist the Denver Office of the

U. S. Attorney in trying a number of pending cases in U. S. District

Court in Denver. After reviewing this case Mr. RUSSO and Mr.

GALLAGHER in discussing the matter with the reporting agent stated

that in their opinion former Assistant U. S. Attorney. JOSEPH N.

LILLY should have included a conspiracy count in drawing the original

indictment against SNELL which was returned by a Federal Grand Jury

in Denver on June 2, 1952.

It was for this reason that Mr. GALLAGHER

and Mr. RUSSO re-presented the SNELL case to a Federal Grand Jury

in Denver on October 20, 1952. Both stated that they are now of the

opinion that the case against SNELL can be successfully prosecuted.
