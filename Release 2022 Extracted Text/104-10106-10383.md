MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, Central Cover Staff

oh .

SUBJECT : Official Cover for Mr.

1. We have been informed by the Clandestine Service

Agent 1 that they pose no objection to the conversion
of from Staff Agent status to Staff Employee
status wi Will enable him to work regularly in the

Headquarters building. They do, however, feel that prior
to his conversion a suitable cover, consistent with his
legal background, must be arranged.

2. In informal discussions with your office, a
possibility of arranging non-official cover with a leeal
law firm was discussed. This law firm would ostensibly
hav te with various government agencies.
wr will be hired by the lew firm to serve as a
legal advigor to the government agencies thus enabling
his to be gone from the office a great part of the tine.
In view of his many contacts in government and private
circles, this type of cover would hold up since sone of
his friends may try to physically reach him at the
office.
