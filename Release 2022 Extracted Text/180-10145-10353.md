AMCLATTER -1 was terminated effective 7/31/66 . Termination

carried out in an amicable manner,

AMCLATTER-1 to take job

in Chicago. Concerned re: citizenship. Six year association

with JMWAVE. Received six weeks basic tradecraft course

in New York in Sept. 1964. Started work in 1960 for JMWAVE as

Prinicpal Agent, handled a number of political action agents

and spotted and developed several candidates for recruitment

for the Bay of Pigs.

Since much of his activity was more overt

than covert, he was thoroughly blown as a CIA asset and

eventually became known in the area as a sort of CIA spokesman.

Became something of a security problem.

Bernard Reichardt.

In the course ofhis relationship with

him and Howard Hunt, hewas promised that his citizenship status

would be inquired into officially.

In summer of 1961, Barker drove to ZRMETAL/ and asked Hunt for

direct help in the matter. Hunt sent someone to take notes in

the matter, he also introduced Barker to Phillip Toomey,) Barker's

next UMWAVE supervisor.

March 1962, cover business provided an opportunity for tien to

leave the country long enough

to re-enter on permanent residence

visa.

On another cover trip in April 1963, met Bernard Reichardt

who said he and Hunt were given to understand that citizenship

matter had been taken care of.

Ihe Cuban passport used in evacuation procured only after assurance

from James Noel |that it would not adversely affect citizenship.
