in Chicago. Concerned re: citizenship. Six year association
with JMWAVE. Received six weeks basic tradecraft course

in New York in Sept. 1964. Started work in 1960 for JMWAVE as
Prinicpal Agent, handled a number of political action agents
and spotted and developed several candidates for recruitment
for the Bay of Pigs. Since much of his activity was more overt

eventually became known in the area as a sort of CIA spokesman.
Became something of a security problem.
