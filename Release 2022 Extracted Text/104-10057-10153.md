[could remember, Ft. Shernan was open in about Aucust or
September 1960 to train Cubans for about a 2 to.3 month period.
There were about 40 to 50 men, mostly ARTIME followers. hon it was
docided a birger group would be noeded, which later becana Brigade
2506, these people were sent to Rotalhulou (Guatemala) xnaxath in
abont November 1960, Actually, the group was split, with sone going
to Guatemala and others, to,the New Orleans. area. As to other training
in Panama, 4 \has no knowledge, (NOTE: A |sungested that Hr. H

am Ay $, retired staffer currently in the New Orleans area, i
might be a good source. Ax |was C/Ops for the invasion Task Force, j
as wo$l as Deputy for PM and C/Ops for JIMWAVE at one time.)

othor calarory was “political” taans - that is political group: in
soufthern:Florida:wlio were sponsoring infiltrations into Cuba,

Tho Agency holped this lator g catarory by riving them supplios.
In the case of both, they usually made x caches in Cuba, The

unilateral team, as an example, would make a cache on-island, ani
zanother, group vould pick it up and use it (compartnentabion).

In some cases, teams (both unilateral and political) would not
actually make the cache and keep the material in Florida, to be

used later at their own convenience, In'aidition, & |was positive
that sono of Castro's troops obtained some of thesn’cachos, dus to
foul-ups and:snitchos, These caches containes pistols, rifles and
heavier, money and demolitions. Somo of the teams cheated by going
to the Bahamas and buryinh thoir stuff on small islawis and reporting
back to Florida that. they had cached in Cuba, A tated soveral
tinos that there was no effective control over the "political"
groups and therefore no control ofer the material riven thea, From
this, me may survize that Agency eywipment (demolition included)
in the hands of-anti-Castro Cubans in south Florida, as xell as
Castro's Rebel Army on-island,

d, Brigade Traini Furthor to demolition training te
sAnti-Castro Cubans, A. jreminded’ me that shortly after the Br:
cwas ransomod from Cuba, Brigado leadors were taken to Palm Beach
and talked with President Kennody, At that timo, the US Govt offered
Brigade members the chance to join the U.S. army. This also included
infil team members, who were completely seporate from tho Brigade, and
<menbers of the Brigade airforce, The Army ond of this training was
given at Ft, Bonning, Geormia and began in early 1953. There, Brigade
members entered the U.S. Army at roukly equivalent ranks - officers
wore made 2nd Lts, They received Ranger training, plus. jump traininn.
‘Thus, A, said, af any exiles wore training in demolations and. related
topics, théfo best training was probably riven at Ft. Benning, Most
“of these mon wero in the U.S. Army for oither 6 months or one year.

6 Octobor 1976 bombing kha of the Cubana airliner in the Garibbean,

A i said the stroet-word along tho Cuban community in south Florida
4s that the bomb should have gone off in the plane on the ground. Tho
bombers did not moan to kill all of those people. On BOSCH, the.
community does not particularly like him, but admires him because-he
thad been going at Castro tooth and nail for years. They do not like
‘the idea of terrorism and fault BOSCH and MORALES for this.

‘Emergency in Miami

It's an emergency.

leader of Brigade 2506, sunned

Mindless murder is a purely
tlocal police matter. But the
oolly calculated multiple politi-
Cal assassinations, not to men-
tion assassination attempts, in
the city that Cuban refugees
adopted, are admittedly beyond

the resources of @ local. law en-
forcement agency.

That is why Minni police,
wisely, have appealed to U.S. At-
tomney General Edward Levi to
FBI intervention in the in-

lings.
Federal intervention is not, as
ely believed, automatic in'as-
sassination cases. The murder of
a private person, even the politi-
cal assassination of a matron the
street, is not a Federal offense.

Before the FBI can enter the
case, Levi must declare that the
Miami murders constitute an
“emergency.”

business, Last yoar, however, they joined with Orlanlo BOSCH, avonr
others, to help form CONG. Now, the Brigade is ombarrassed and wished
they had never joined CORUJ. They with-drow shortly after the Cnbana
bombing in October 76. However, the damage has been done to the
Brigade Association, which A considers a shame. On the CBS film
(above), A ‘said he was filmed attending an anniversary meeting.
‘This same meoting was where CBS filmed Poyuyero.

mf As Hamseript: I had read | A Jes nas ipl,
"Tho Bay of Pigs” befors dopartin, Yashincton, ch explained Ut
he had dictated this’ paper and had a couple of secrotarios type iL
out, It is only in very roush form and ho wanted to get his thoushts
down on paper. As ho indicates in tho papsr, ho wanted to get tie
facts straight, e-fedls that since ho was there and part of the
invasion, he has ‘a-unique véew point of the Ray of Pies and wants
wto seo that history roflects his pobition, Asx indicated earlier,
A is rather bitter against the Now Frontier, Kennedys ant
Camelot. This is roflected in his manuseript A claimed tha
much of his papor had boen "stolen" in that ho oxplained the invasion,
for instance, to the CBS crew anl they wore using sone of his material
sin the soon to bne bo shown proyram described above. In addition,
mentioned that he had spoken to the Agency historian ~ can't
‘recall his name ~ on who is also writing a Look (classified) on tho
invasion. As to publication, it seems.to be in the distant future.
He does not plan to po to a piblisher, where he would xex racoive
royalty payments of around 5%, Rather, he. plans to publish on hi:
.oun, probably in Miami, and realize close to 100% profit. It micht
cost him kkx in the area of $5,000, but he could realize a profit of
about $30,000 depending on sales.

n i _& ‘also spoko abont porsonalities within the
“mency. He mebtioned Ted Shackloy, "Dum'Dum"imer, many poople in
LAD who had a part in the invasion or JMVAVE. . A is a member of
the retired Agency employees association that Dave Phillips formed.
hs such, he has appeared several times on Tampa radio and TV shows.
To me, he appears to bo an articulate defender of the Agency.

4, Conclusion: For me, this was a most intorosting interviow.
As far as results, the interview indicated to me that we can cot
broad-brush overviews from retired Azency employees, and fow details.
To answer specific questions from Congfoss and/or the Departmont of
Justice, we mst continue to dig and come up with documents from
