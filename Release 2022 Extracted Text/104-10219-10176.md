1. DCD's only recorded contact with Joseph Raymond Merola
prior to August 1961 occurred on 6 February 1961. It followed
a series of telephone calls over a period of several months
in which Merola had expressed interest in offering his assis-
tance in connection with Cuban matters. The DCD officer had
. declined contact until 6 February when Merola claimed to have
information on a Brazilian senator who was a "close friend ©
and confidante" of "Che" Guevera. Because Guevera was the
subject of requirezents levied on DCD, our officer agreed to
fees a meeting. The substance of the 6 February 1961 meeting is
described in report 00-A(S)-3179213, dated 8 February. (This
report has been returned to the Agency Archives, but will be
retrieved and reviewed for classification. Should it carry a
"Secret" classification, it will be downgraded to "Confidential"
and may be so considered for the purposes of this inquiry.)
