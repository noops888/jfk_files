sgreed that I return to Cuba for about one year, security permitting,

1957 was concentrated on communist targets in the University of Habana, it :
should te pointed out that ny dities during that Period also involved many :

visa in 1953, for purely technical reasons. may be changed.

In this matter, the natare of the new project or —_
