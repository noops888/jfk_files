would be permitted to take notes, but he would not be furnished a copy of 4
the document. The Deputy further instructed that should Mr. Elliff a

Dear Congressman Wiggins: C a f fl bf] ae i N

Reference is made to your letter dated April 9,
1975, enclosing a resolution adopted by the State Bar of
California condemning the’ Federal Bureau of Investigation
(8BI) for placing an informant on the staff of a legal
service agency to communicate information learned in that
eapacity to the FBI and our response dated April 28, 1975.

Contact with the State Bar of California has
enabled us to identify the situation to waich they were Pa
referring. g

> Betveen April, 1968, and November, 1968, one
ph Leamez Muse was “operated as an informant by our
‘leans, Louisiana, Division. Muse furnished information
regarding plack extremist activities and he was paid for
services rendered. Muse vas unemployed when initially
volunteering his assistance to the FBI and subsequently, on
May 10, 1968, begen vorking as an investigator for the
New Orleans legal Assistance Corps CHOLAC), an organization

Honorable Charles E, Wiggins

Muse and the FBI would be maintained by him and would go
no further. Muse's supervisor said he was cognizant of
the importance of Muse's cooperation with the FBI remaining
confidential.

The New Orleans Division of the FBI never —
conducted any investigation regarding NOLAC and Muse
never furnished information concerning its activities.

: E hope this information will clarify the issue
for you. If I may be of further assistance in this matter,
pleasé contact me.

A copy of this letter is being provided to the

Honorable Charles E, Wiggins

NOTE:

The resolution of the State Bar of California (SBC)
referred to above did not identify the specific incident in
which they were interested so Congressman Wiggins' letter was
acknowledged and we indicated additional details would follow.

On 4/25/75 San Francisco advised the basis for the SBC resolution
was articles contained in the 2/7/75 issues of the San Francisco
Examiner and Oakland Tribune. In these articles Muse was not
mentioned by name but the details corresponded with his case.

On 4/28/75 Supervisor Ernest Wall, New Orleans, advised Muse °
was identified by name in articles concerning this incident

in the 2/2/75 issue of the New Orleans Times Picayume and the
2/25/75 issue’ of the New Orleans States Item. Since Muse
revealed his relationship with the FBI and has been publicly
identified by mame and appears to be no privacy issue or néed

“to protect the confidentiality of our files, Congressman Wiggins
should be advised.of the complete details in this matter. As'
the SBC urged issues such as this be considered by the select
committees of the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives, a
copy of this communication is being furnished for the information
of the Legal Analysis Section and Project Senstudy 75 in
Division 5.

SUBJECT =: -Ninth Meeting, 4 June 1975 PEE Eee

’

- od. A meeting of the USIB Ad Hoc Coordinating Group!
‘was held on.4 June 1975 at 10: OO a.m. A list. cs attendees
is attached.

EEL “2. The meeting was opened by Dr. Clarke who described’
the current activities of the Senate Select Committee in -
accelerating their official interviews with knowledgeable .
officials across the Community and the criticality of firming
up agreements on how these interviews are to be handled.

This has not been forthcoming despite White House interest.
chau Select Committee procedure is not yet clear.

k 3. | The second item raised by the Chairman was the
: list of category II "abuses" which-had been developed at
|’. , the direction of the Policy Steering Group. The set’ developed
: was the result of discussions with Mr. SchwarJz, Counsel .to
the Senate Select Committee, who plans to present a complete
- list of "category II" items to the Committee on Friday, 6 za
June. At that point, it is expected "notices" would go out ~
to:the Community agencies advising them so that agreed i
interview procedures will apply. It is also anticipated
‘that the presence of private as well as Agency counsel will
-be addressed. The Policy Steering Group has accepted the
pranciple:.of dealing: with :these .identified -lcategory.. TE"
ects by. assigning responsibility for gathering be, ale
nd paper preparation’ to specific “inay ua.
within the Community agénéies. -'Dr.: Clarke’ is thé” focaky |

a In addition to the "category II" items, there are
a number of additional subjects largely geographic in nature
for which the DCI feels CIA should assume responsibility
for preparing comprehensive papers. In view of the
apparent adversary relationship between the Senate Select
Committee Staff and the agencies under investigation, it may
: be that preparation of papers dealing comprehensively with
! - specific subjects will deflect some of this cross-agency
: probing and result in a positive solution to problems before
they arise.

» 5. The Chairman reminded’ the group of the responsibility
‘which exists to keep Mr. Cotter of the Post Office Department
informed on matters resulting from the Congressional investiga-
tions which will clearly impact on his agency's affairs. At
present, the cross-agency character of the interviews now
under way indicate a possible communication gap in adequately
bdadviahnmaiavaaiae on postal matters.

6. : The Chairman explained the DCI's action taken in
late May to separate the responsibility for CIA's response
. tu the Congressional Selcct Comiittees from those responsi-
‘bilities of the IC Staff. Both Dr. Clarke and Mr: Elder
. emphasized the’ very close relationship which exists in the
.° . two efforts. Mr. Elder will WiGsaTiieannl CIA at all USIB Ad
Hoe sessions be cease
|
|
|

T The Chairman questioned Mr. Elder, the CIA repre-
sentative, whether or not the Senate Select Committeg had
yet furnished the Agency with a list of subjects with which
they plan to deal in depth. Mr. Elder reported they have
not yet done so, but it is apparent that three items are of
‘priority interest at the moment: assassinations, the Phoenix
program, and covert action; that.it appears clear the Committee
is currently pursuing the question of authorities, approvals,
and support from other agencies.

8. The 27 May request addressed to the DCI covering
¢ Va Watertals: undér “the ‘Sunisdidtiori “of a*ritinber Of “Community *
agencies was provided. to.the members of the Ad Hoe Group.
Ps: Clarke indicated he was.. seeking policy guidance. on...
selected items in the request which dealt with Community
product such as NIE etc. He noted the 27 May request indicated
identical:letters were being: forwarded to-the- Secretary: of

indicated to CIA its intent to concentrate on specific

noted that concurrent with this meeting, a meeting of Community
. legal representatives was taking place with the purpose of
commenting on the House Select Committee's proposed security

Q: Shortly after King received the Nobel Prize did a Bureau official William
Sullivan come to Atlanta?

visited Atlanta.

Q: Did Sullivan have any contact with Ralph McGill concerning King?

A: I do not know.

Q: Were taps (telephone) and bugs (microphone) used by Atlanta in connection
with King?

A: A tap (telephone) was utilized re King at his SCLC office and his residence.
Q: When were the bugs (microphone) utilized?

A: There were none.

Q: What was the purpose of the investigation of King?

A: ‘To determine whether King and/or SCLC were influencéd by persons or groups
having communist tendencies.

Q: Did you feel the investigation was worthwhile?

A: I don't recall that I ever asked myself that question. It was an assign-
ment made by my employer and my responsibility to handle it.

Q: How did other agents feel about the illegal use of these taps?

A: The taps were not illegal. They were obtained through the authority of

the Attorney General. :

Q: Did any agents express the opinion that these investigations were improper?
A: I do not recall specifically although Mr. Murtaugh may well have so stated.
Q: What electronic surveillance was used concerning Levison?

A: Only to the extent that he was in contact with King. There was no tap
on Levison per se in Atlanta.

Q: Was there any physical surveillance of King?

A: I do not recall any physical surveillance of King as such. There was
surveillance conducted of individuals in contact with King and consequently
King would obviously have been physically surveilled. But such surveillance
was not on King directly.

Q: Did you participate in these surveillances?

A: Yes on several occasions.

Q: How many occasions?

A: I cannot recall.

Q: How long were you in Atlanta?

A: August 1960 - March 1971. : |

Q: What other offices did you serve in and when?

A: Baltimore, September 1948 - January 1949; Buffalo, January 1949 - August 1960; -
Atlanta, August 1960 - March 1971.

Q: Where were you born?

A: London, England.

Q: How long did you live there?

A: 9 years.

Q: Where did you live first when in this country?

A: In New Jersey approximately one year. I spent most of my growing up time

in Towa.

Q: You entered the Bureau July 1948 and left in March 1971?

A: That is correct.

Q: When was the King and SCLC case assigned to you?

NW 65360 Docid:32989588 Page 40


=4-

A: I believe it was the early part or spring of 1965.

Q: How long had the investigation been going on before you got the case?

A: I really am not sure - possibly a year; it might have been longer.

A: How long did the investigation continue?

A: TI cannot actually recall.

Q: Was it still going on when you left the Bureau?

A: Yes, regarding the SCLC.

Q: How long after King's death did the tap remain?

A: I cannot be sure. It seems as though it was discontinued a short time
after, however I believe it continued for a longer period of time on the SCLC.
Q: Did you have any contact with news media or clergy regarding King, SCLC,
or Levison?

A: No.

Q: What relationship was there with the Atlanta Police Department and

what electronic surveillance did it have of King, SCLC, or Levison?

A: Throughtout my entire period as agent in Atlanta I never had any informa-
tion as to what electronic surveillance may have been conducted by the Atlanta
Police Department. During the period of time I was concerned with King, SCLC,
Levison there was no discussion to my knowledge of these matters with the
Atlanta Police Department. Generally speaking the rapport with the police
department was good.

Q: Did you monitor the taps on King, SCLC?

A: No.

Q: What squad were you assigned to in the Atlanta Office?

A: Security. More correctly it was referred to as the Security and Racial

Squad.

NW 65360 Docld:32989588 Page 41


Q: Who else was assigned to this squad? Was there a man named Harding?
A: Yes.

Q: What was his first name?

A: Charles.

A: Who else was assigned?

Your friend Murtaugh, a Richard Davis. 4
At this point the writer stated he preferred not to name additional per-

sonnel simply because he did not wish to feel that they might subsequently be

interviewed as a result. The writer stated he was confident that Siedel or

his agency had already been furnished all of these names by Mr. Murtaugh.

He was informed that in the writer's opinion the Bureau was fully able and
capable of furnishing this information. :Siedel opined it would be a waste of govern-
ment money to subpoena the writer to Washington in order to obtain these names.
Q: Did you develop any evidence relating to Levison's CP connections?

A: No.

Q: Did you read reports from New York regarding Levison?

A: Yes.

Q: Did these reports set forth information from taps and bugs?

A: The reports did not state source of information,

Q: Did you know the information came from taps (or bugs)?

A: I did not know directly but presumed that it did.

Q: What type of work was the Security Squad in Atlanta concerned with?

A: That squad primarily handled matters in the security category, racial
matters, and also civil rights matters.

Q: What kind of matters constituted racial matters besides SCLC?

_NW 65360 Docid:32989588 Page 42 d



A: The investigation of SCLC was not a racial matter. It was concerned with

possible communist influence of the organization. The Ku Klux Klan was a

racial matter because it involved pressures between white and black persons.
Q: What organizations or individuals were investigated in the security
category?

A: T have had no contact with Bureau matters for over four years. At this

time I have no knowledge what effect my answer to your question might have
upon the current status of any matter of concern to the Bureau.

Siedel essentially repeated his question and endeavored to explain that

he had no desire to affect the Bureau's investigative status.

The writer advised his answer to the question remained as above. At
this point Siedel suggested the writer might wish to consult Mr. Phillips
which was done.

Writer consulted privately with Phillips. After which Phillips entered
the writer's office and told Siedel that if he was seeking the Bureau's policy
relative to security, racial and civil rights investigations, same was in
the Bureau's manuals available to the Committee. At this point Siedel said
he was not after policy but names of specific persons and organizations the
writer would now recall were under investigation.

The writer restated former answer to this question and explained to
Siedel that he did not consider himself so naive to suppose that any of the
information given to Sielel would not at some future time appear in print.

To which Siedel stated he would not be personally responsible therefore.
Siedel was informed the writer was not necessarily stating he would be personally

responsible therefore. Siedel pointed out that he could not require a different

answer to this question at the present time but went on to explain the writer

_ NW 65360 Docld:32989588 Page 43 . y

could be subpoenaed for this purpose for open or closed testimony.
Q: During the course of these investigations did you ever alter or fabricate
any document previously prepared?
A: No.
Q: Do you know of such having been done in the Atlanta Office?
A: No.
Q: Do you know of a tape recording pertaining to King which was sent to
Mrs. King?
A: Not during that period. It seems I might have heard such an allegation
but there has been so much material news media wise the past year or two,
I actually cannot be sure whether I read of such an allegation or might have
heard it said. In any case so far as I am concerned it was hearsay.
Q: What was your participation in. COINTELPRO investigations and what did
they cover while you were in the Atlanta Office?
A: I left the Bureau over four years ago and have absolutely no knowledge of
what might be the present status of any investigation by the Bureau past or
present. I feel very strongly that any answer I might give could conceivably
adversely effect the Bureau's investigative position. For this reason I de-
cline to discuss this matter.

Siedel stated the Bureau had recently stated it had discontinued COINTELPRO.
The writer advised he was not aware of this; that his answer above remained the
same.
Q: Do you know of any effort by the Bureau to influence a political campaign?

A: No.

WRITER'S OBSERVATIONS

1. Siedel obviously was attempting to verify allegations made by other individuals.
2. All of his questions appeared to have been previously prepared in writing.
3. At one point he commented he was conducting this interview for a colleague
(not named).
4. Siedel did not appear satisfied with the results of the interview. It is
presumed he considers the writer's cooperation to be minimal.
5. As Siedel prepared to depart he was informed that during 23 years as an
agent the writer suffered some adverse administrative action; that these ulti-

mately proved to be experiences from which the writer profited. He was told

the writer had "no axe to grind" regarding the Bureau and no intent or desire
to accomplish any questionable literary fame.

6. Upon departing Siedel inquired as to the proximity of the Equitable Building f
(office building) and the First National Bank of Atlanta (also office building).

Any significance to these locations was not apparent to the writer. When

informed that banking hours terminated at 4:00pm Siedel made no comment.

EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT

As consideration for employment in the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), United

States Department of Justice, and as a condition for continued employment, I hereby declare
that I intend to be governed by and I will comply with the following provisions:

(1) That I am hereby advised and I understand that Federal law such as
Title 18, United States Code, Sections 793, 794, and 798; Order of the _
President of the United States (Executive Order 11652); and regulations
issued by the Attorney General of the United States (28 Code of Federal »
Regulations, Sections 16.21 through 16.26) prohibit loss, misuse, or un-
authorized disclosure or production of national security information, other
classified information and other nonclassified information in the files of
the FBI;

(2) [understand that unauthorized disclosure of information in the files
of the FBI or information I may acquire as an employee of the FBI could
result in impairment of national security, place human life in jeopardy, or
result in the denial of due process to a person or persons who are subjects
of an FBI investigation, or prevent the FBI from effectively discharging its
responsibilities. I understand the need for this secrecy agreement; there-
fore, as consideration for employment I agree that I will never divulge,
publish, or reveal either by word or conduct, or by other means disclose to
any unauthorized recipient without official written authorization by the
Director of the FBI or his delegate, any information from the investigatory
files of the FBI or any information relating to material contained in the files,
or disclose any information or produce any material acquired as a part of the
performance of my official duties or because of my official status. The burden
is on me to determine, prior to disclosure, whether information may be disclosed
and in this regard I agree to request approval of the Director of the FBI in each
such instance by presenting the full text of my proposed disclosure in writing to
the Director of the FBI at least thirty (30) days prior to disclosure. I understand
that this agreement is not intended to apply to information which has been placed
in the public domain or to prevent me from writing or speaking about the FBI but
it is intended to prevent disclosure of information where disclosure would be
contrary to law, regulation or public policy. I agree the Director of the FBI is
in a better position than I to make that determination;

(8) I agree that all information acquired by me in connection with my official
duties with the FBI and all official material to which I have access remains
the property of the United States of America, and I will surrender upon demand Pe
by the Director of the FBI or his delegate, or upon separation from the FBI, any
material relating to such information or property in my possession;

(4) That I understand unauthorized disclosure may be a violation of Federal
law and prosecuted as a criminal offense and in addition to this agreement may
be enforced by means of an injunction or other civil remedy.

I accept the above provisions as conditions for my employment and continued employment

in the FBI. I agree to comply with these provisions both during my employment in the FBI and
following termination of such employment.

On the morning of May 30, 1975, Mr. Robert Nichols

(SA-Retired), and SA John Dennis Miller, Legal Analysis ~ Ay

for interview by members of the staff of the Senate Select

Committee.

Miller gave Nichols a copy of the Committee's rules
at approximately 8:35 a.m. after Nichols stated he had not
been given a copy by anyone else. He advised Nichols that
nothing Miller was about to say was intended to or should
be interpreted as an order or suggestion to be uncooperative
with the Senate Select Committee or its staff.

Miller then advised Nichols he had the right to be
represented by an attorney; if he is unable to retain an
attorney, he should so advise the Committee staff and ask them
to assist him in securing counsel; and the FBI could not
provide the services of an attorney. Nichols said he

understood. “REC! 100 (tex2 fl by By Dhar

On the evening of 5-20-75 Deputy Assistant Attorney Director See'y —
General K. William O'Conner telephonically advised SA Paul V. Daly
of the Legal Counsel Division that the Department had reached a decision ui Lf
concerning the scope of testimony to be allowéd in the Senate Select fs

Committee interview of former SA Alan G. Sé@ntinella. We previously

had informed the Department that Mr. Sentinella was to testify pursuant
to a subpoena before this Committee and that Bopartment of Justice Order
501-73 requires we obtain Departmental approval before testimony may

be given. We also informed the Department that Lester B. Seidel , staff
member of the Senate Select Committee, had advised SA Daly that the
scope of the intended interview of Sentinella would include knowledge
Sentinella may have concerning the investigations of Martin Luther King,
Stanley David Levinson, and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference
(SCLC). Mr. Seidel also indicated that they would interview Sentinella
concerning his activities between the years 1960 to 1971. 4

5
Mr. O'Conner advised SA Daly that the decision of Deputy \
Attorney General Harold R. Tyler; Assistant Attorney General Antonin 4
Scalia, and Associate Deputy Attorney General Robert McDermott was that’
Sentinella was released insofar as the Department was concerned to only
discuss three areas, those areas being the FBI investigations of Martin Luther
King, Stanley David Levinson, and SCLC. He was to advise the Committee
that he was not permitted to go outside of these three areas because of
instructions from the Department of Justice which instructions were issued
pursuant to Department of Justice Order 501-73.

On 5-21-75 former SA Sentinella was advised of the
Departmental restrictions on the information he could furnish the Committee
by SA Daly, and he was accompanied by SA Daly to the Senate Select Committee
office located in G308 of the Dirksen Senate Office Building. Sentinella's
interview was scheduled for 9:30 a.m. Mr. Seidel met Mr. Sentinella and
at 9:31 a.m. furnished a Pontinella a copy of _ Rules f mia, for

RE: SENSTUDY 75

the Select Committee to Study Governmental Operations with Respect to
Intelligence Activities. At the same time, former SA Sentinella was furnished
forms which Seidel. requested he fill out at that time. Seidel also made
reference to Sentinella's Fifth Amendment rights but did not specify or spell
out his rights.

It was brought to Mr. Seidel 's attention by SA Daly that the Rules
adopted by the Senate Select Committee called for a witness to be given copies
of the Rules 24 hours prior to his appearance before the Committee and that
these Rules are important for a potential witness to have knowledge of prior to
his being interviewed since they contain a list of rights and privileges which a
witness is entitled to. It was also brought to Mr. Seidel 's attention that despite
the fact that the interview was to be initiated at 10 a.m. (initially the interview
was scheduled for 9:30 a.m. , however, upon arrival former SA Sentinella was
advised it would not be held until 10 a.m.) with Mr. Sentinella being required
to fill out forms, he would have very little opportunity to review and digest the
Rules of the Committee.

Mr. Seidel was also advised of the restrictions placed onthe
area which former SA Sentinella could respond to by the Department of Justice.
Mr. Seidel specifically requested that he be allowed to ask questions concerning
"COINTELPRO!' He was advised that this was not within the scope of the
Department's release for Sentinella unless such information may have been
related to the investigations of Martin Luther King, Stanley David Levinson, or
SCLC.

SA Daly also explained to John Elliff, Task Force Head for the
Committee on Domestic Intelligence Matters, the circumstances surrounding
the failure to provide a copy of the Rules 24 hours prior to interview and of the
lack of specificity of Mr. Seidel as to areas/which Mr. Sentinella would be
interviewed.» <«. -, Mr, Elliff apologized for the oversight of the Committee
in complying with its Rules and assured SA Daly this would not happen again.
In addition, he was advised that the Rules of the Committee provide that witnesses
would have a reasonable opportunity to inspect and correct their testimony,
however, the Rules provide that a witness must inspect his testimony in the
office of the Committee. It was pointed out to Mr. Elliff that such procedures
were unreasonable in that in Mr. Sentinella's instance, he would have to travel
from Atlanta to Washington, D. C., to review the transcript of his testimony at
his own expense. Mr, Elliff indicated that he believed other arrangements
concerning this particular aspect of the Rules could and would be worked out,

Legal Counsel to Mr. J. B. Adams
RE: SENSTUDY 75

7

Mr. Sentinella at the conclusion of his testimony advised SA Daly,
who was not present at the testimony, that the Committee adhered to the restrictions
placed on his testimony by the Attorney General with one possible exception. They
asked Mr. Sentinella if while he was working in Atlanta his squad investigated the
"Klan" and "SNCC" (Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee). Sentinella
advised he did not raise an objection to this question because he felt the deviation
from the eee ental restrictions was very slight, and our investigations of
these matters/wéll known.

On the afternoon of 5-21-75 K. William O'Conner inquired of
SA Daly how the interview went and he was generally advised of the facts surrounding
the interview, including the fact that former SA Sentinella was not furnished a copy
of the Rules until immediately preceding the interview. Mr. O'Conner inquired
as to whether the Senator (‘Senator Robert Morgan [D-N.C, ]) remained during the
taking of testimony from Mr. Sentinella, and he was advised that according to
Sentinella, Senator Morgan departed approximately five minutes after placing
Mr, Sentinella under oath.

Mr. O'Conner expressed his displeasure at the way the Committee
operated and indicated he was going to discuss this matter with Deputy Attorney
General Tyler.

Subsequently, on 5-21-75 O'Conner indicated he had been in contact
with James Wilderotter, assistant to the Counsel to the President, and Deputy
Attorney General Tyler, and they want the Bureau to prepare a letter protesting
the Committee's handling of the interview of Sentinella and of the fact that they
violated Rules which were adopted by that Committee, specifically the Rules
requiring Mr. Sentinella be furnished a copy of the Committee Rules 24 hours
prior to giving testimony to the Committee, failure to be specific concerning the
areas to be covered by Sentinella's testimony, the general manner in which the
rights of Sentinella were explained to him, and the fact that Senator Morgan
departed from the Committee session after giving the oath. O'Conner explained
in this regard Deputy Attorney General Tyler feels that this is in contravention
of the Rules of the Committee, and he questions whether an executive session of
the Committee being held to hear such testimony can continue in the absence of a
Senate Committee Member. He requested this letter be directed to Senator
Church. He was advised that such a letter could only be prepared after approval
had been obtained from proper Bureau authorities, and it was also pointed out
to Mr. O'Conner that we had orally protested this matter to Mr. Elliff of the
Committee and Mr, Seidel , and he was apprised of Elliff's statement that such
mistakes would not be repeated in the future, It was pointed out to Mr. O'Conner

RE: SENSTUDY 75

that the Bureau had furnished former SA Sentinella a detailed briefing of his
rights and a briefing as to what was contained in the Rules of the Committee
prior to his interview. Mr. O'Conner again requested that we prepare a letter
protesting this matter.

It is not felt that a letter concerning this particular matter should
be directed to Senator Church in view of Mr. Elliff's statement that this
incident will not be repeated in the future. It is felt that our oral protest to the
Committee is sufficient at this point, especially inasmuch as they accepted the
limitations placed on the testimony of former SA Sentinella by the Department.
It would appear we could expect to achieve very little by sending such a letter
at this time.

RECOMMENDATION:

That we orally advise Mr. O'Conner the Bureau does not feel
a letter should be directed to the fen this particular incident.

Dear Senator Church:

It is my understanding that the continuing efforts of

’ staff members of the Executive and Legislative Branches to
prepare standard guidelines for witness interview procedures
are continuing this week. While that process continues, the
Department of Justice is, of course, continuing to cooperate
in an ad hoc and responsive manner, In order,to ensure our
attention to these cooperative efforts, I have designated
K, William O'Connor as Special Counsel for Intelligence
Coordination and as such he will be the (principle liaison

“:,* Counsel and members of his staff are now dealing with

Mr. O'Connor in the execution of their responsibilities.

. In the meantime, in an effort to expedite the coopera-
tive provision of appropriate information to SSC, it would be
most helpful if th i f:
epartment of Justi

“TRIS would FAG kate” the interview ProeEss , since “it would

The purpose of this memorandum is to advise that a
representative of captioned Committee has advised that if the Bureau's
response to a Committee request concerning the Democratic Convention
in Atlantic City in 1964 is sufficiently informative it may not be necessary
to interview Bureau personnel concerning this matter and to recommend
that an expeditious effort be made to furnish a summary concerning the
Atlantic City investigation be made available along with certain documents
concerning this matter.

By way of background, we have received a requ st dated
5-14-75 pertaining to many items, among which was information concerning
the Bureau's activities in Atlantic City in 1964 at the Democratic National
Convention. At a meeting on 5-30-75 it was pointed out to the Committee
that certain aspects of thein May 14, 1975, request were particularly
burdensome, would in some instances invadé privacy and for other reason;
was imost difficult. During this meeting which was attended by Mark Gite:
staff member of the Committee; John Elliff, Task Force Director;
representatives of the Bureau; and K. William O'Conner, Special.Co ;
to the Deputy Attorney General for Intelligence Coordination, the Commitfee
representatives indicated that subject to the Senate Committee's approval
they would accept some sort of summary with #egard-to their request in
Appendix D, Item 8 of the May 14, 1975, request. This item pertains to
the Bureau's activities in Atlantic City.

We have had former Agents interviewed concerning this
matter, a request has been made to interview two Bureau secretaries, and
the Committee has indicated they intend to interview as many as five
additional Bureau Agents concerning this matter. In conversation with
K. William O'Conner, he mentioned that the Committee had specifically
informed him that if the Bureau's response was informative enough concerning

the Atlantic City matter, they would not interview the two Bureau
secretaries, Mary Ann Massa and M. Ann Mierzejewski. (The request
concerning the interview of these Bureau employees, who are Newark
Office employees, is the subject of a separate memorandum captioned
and dated same.) He requested SA Paul V. Daly to contact Mark
Gitenstein in an effort to determine what type of response the Committee
expected concerning the Atlantic City incident.

—-On 6-4-75, SA Daly contacted Mr. Gitenstein and Mr. Gitenstein
advised that the Committee knew of the existence of certain memoranda
and in particular a memorandum from former Assistant to the Director
C. D. DeLoach reporting a conversation with the President requesting Bureau
coverage at the Convention. Gitenstein stated that with regard to the
Atlantic City incident, if a summary was prepared concerning this incident
which would in general show the types of people whose conversations were
monitored, the type of information collected, and the type of information
disseminated along with furnishing the Committee certain important documents
that it would not be necessary to interview Bureau personnel. He indicated
among the documents they would expect to be furnished would be the DeLoach
memorandum along with other "benign" documents which would not involvea
privacy consideration or other considerations which might preclude their
being made available tothe Committee. Gitenstein indicated that it is the
Committee's feeling that information of a political nature such as the
credentials argument at the Convention was collected and furnished to the
White House and that the collection and dissemination of this information is
not apparently in concert with the ostensive purpose of electronic surveillance.
He felt that the summary need not and should not identify individuals monitored
but rather describe them such as a senator or some other descriptive phrase
to describe the individual whose conversation might have been monitored.
He said as to the verification of the information contained in the summary
with the information in the files, that subject will be addressed by the
Committee at a later time.

Gitenstein again mentioned that if such information was
furnished by the Bureau, their need to interview employees would be muted
as what they are attempting to learn through interview of Agents involved
would have already been furnished by the Bureau. He volunteered’that the
Committee is relatively well informed concerning this particular matter.

It is obvious from the specific mention of the DeLoach memorandum along
with other observations and statements he made that this could well be true.

Legal Counsel to Mr. J. B. Adams Memo
RE: SENSTUDY 75

It is realized that the White House has requested that a
paper be prepared which would include the Atlantic City incident; however,
K. William O'Connér indicated that he had conversed with
Mr. James Wilderotter, assistant to the Counsel to the President, and
that Wilderotter had advised that document requests pertaining to
Atlantic City or any other topic which will be addressed in a paper should
be responded to and response should not be delayed.

It would appear to be advantageous to the Bureau to attempt
to comply with the summary request along with furnishing certain documents
concerning Atlantic City on an expeditious basis as opposed to the Committee
continuing to conduct interviews of current and former Bureau personnel.’

If this type of arrangement can be worked out in this particular incident
which the Committee characterizes as an abuse, it might lend itself toa
similar arrangement in other areas.

RECOMMENDATION:
That the Intelligence Division expeditiously prepare a

summary in line with the above concerning the Atlantic City incident along
with furnishing the important documents concerning this incident.

meeting of the Executive Committee of the Ad Hoc Coordinating Group
of Congressional Review for the Intelligence Community on 5-28-75.
The meeting was chaired by William Colby, Director of Central Intelligence.
Also present were: Philip Buchen, Counsel to the President, James
Wilderotter, Associate Counsel to the President, Thomas K. Latimer,
Special Assistant to the Secretary of Defense, John M. Clarke, Associate
Deputy to the DCI for the Intelligence Community, William O'Connor,

Section Chief William O. Cregar, Inspector John B. Hotis, and senior
officials of the State Department, National Security Agency, Office of
Management and Budget, Defense Department, and the Treasury Department.

The following matters of interest were discussed at the

meeting:
House Select Committee on Intelligence Activities eee /)

Mr. Colby said he met earlier this week with Chairman’

Nedzi of the House Select Committee on Intelligence Activities, John L.

Boos, Chief Counsel, and A. Searle Field, Committee Staff Director.

He said they seemed interested in the relationship which had developed

between the Senate Committee and CIA and asked where he thought the

Senate inquiry was going. They also discussed procedures regarding access.
«, to documents and witnesses and requested they be furnished some basic
‘ materials concerning the CIA's authority to conduct intelligence investigations.
*. They also requested that the Committee be provided with all the materials
. ¥equested by the Senate Select Committee. Colby pointed out that the

House Resolution (H-Res. 138) which established the Select Committee

which provides that members of the House shall have access to all
Committee records. He said Congressman Robert N. Giaimo (D-Conn.)
has indicated that he will not accept any limitations on access. Colby

said he will appear in an open session before the Committee sometime

in the next few weeks to discuss, in general terms, the agency's position on
collection of intelligence information.

Senate Select Committee on Intelligence Activities

Mr. Wilderotter said that F. A. O. Schwarz. Counsel to
the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence Activities, has agreed to identify
in advance specific allegations of abuse that will be reviewed by the
Committee. Wilderotter said he will then appoint a task force or some
other coordinating mechanism within the executive branch to examine each
of these areas in depth. The purpose will be to develop an executive
department brief on each subject which can be used to respond to Committee
requests. He felt that this might enable the Administration to gain the
initiative on these issues and perhaps limit the Committee's inquiries to the
boundaries set ‘forth in the Senate Resolution. He asked that the agencies
make an effort to identify abuse subjects so that the White House can pull
together all the information available on each topic. He said it is already
clear that the Committee will examine such subjects as assassinations
and the CIA's role in the internal affairs of Chile and the Dominican Republic.

Mr. E. H. Knoche, Assistant to the Director, Central
Intelligence Agency, reported that Mr. Colby has made three appearances
before the Senate Select Committee and on each occasion discussed
assassination matters. Mr. Colby will meet with the Committee three times
next week, and it is expected that he will be asked about the Phoenix program
and the covert activities of the CIA including political, counterintelligence,
and clandestine intelligence collection. The Committee will trace the agency's
operations back to the 1947 directive in an effort'to determine how they
relate to policy objectives of the Government.

Mr. William G. Hyland, Director of Intelligence and Research,
Department of State, said the Committee has requested position papers
"on the Department's activities in Laos and Chile and to explain of the Depart-
ment's approach to covert action and whether it was a supplement or instrument
of policy. Mr. Hyland raised the question of whether the agencies had any
moral obligation to advise former employees that documents were now being

Re: SENSTUDY 75

made available to Congress. He felt that they should be given an opportunity
to review these files prior to interview in order to refresh their memories.
Mr. Wilderotter agreed and said that each agency should adopt a similar
policy.

Mr. John M. Clarke, Associate Deputy to the DCI, asked
whether anyone knew what John Elliff hoped to accomplish as Director of
the Task Force on Domestic Intelligence. We pointed out that his earlier
writings would indicate that he intends to draft an intelligence charter for
the FBI, and perhaps the entire intelligence community. Elliff hag made
a comprehensive study over the past several years of the Bureau's internal
security intelligence functions, including sources of the FBI's authority and
the legal restrictions of its operations. This was the subject of a paper he
submitted at the Princeton Conference in 1971, and he has since called for
the establishment of legal standards for the Bureau's collection, retention,
and dissemination of intelligence information.

Mr. Buchen then requested that the FBI draft a proposed
intelligence charter for the Bureau. He felt that it would be helpful for
the Administration to have a proposal available which it might use to counter
any recommendations made by the Committee. At the end of the meeting
Mr. Wilderotter asked that a second paper be prepared reviewing all
of Mr., Elliff's articles on the subject of domestic intelligence with the
view toward identifying those issues which seem to be of major importance.

With regard to Mr. Buchen's request, we feel that it would
be inappropriate for the Bureau to draft an intelligence charter for the
executive branch. It is the responsibility of the White House and other
consumers of intelligence to define their needs and propose appropriate
operating authority. We also question the utility of reviewing Professor
Elliff's writings on the domestic intelligence functions. We feel a better
course of action at this point is simply to ask Mr. Elliff to define the goals
and objectives of his task force. He has always been very candid and forthright
and we have no reason to think that he would be reluctant to discuss the matter
with us. In addition, it is likely his views on the intelligence function differ
from those expressed in his earlier articles, and it is best to get his current
thinking on the problem. If this approach proves unsuccessful, we can then
resort to a review of his written materials.

Senate Select Committee staff for interview but it, was ‘his intention
to call Mark Giteisteim to discuss further her his interview by the Committee.
Mr. Armstrong’ inquired as to whether the Bureau has any objections to

his discussing the two subject areas previously described by Mr. Gitenstein.
Those areas were Armstrong’s knowledge of the Bureau's Intelligence
Division activities as a result of his employment in the FBI, and his
knowledge of the possibility of the Bureau getting an Executive Order
establishing the FEI’s authority in security matters.

I advised Mr. Armstrong that to the extent that the interview
would concern those two subjecis, the Bureau would have no objection
and he could consider his secrecy agreement waived, but only to that
extent. Mr. Armstrong inquired as to whether there were any particul
problems with information he furnished to me on May 28, 1975. I told
him that the waiver of the agreement was conditioned on the one limitati:
that he would not furnish information that would identify informants,

‘ compromise current investigations, or on-going programs, or reveal
other sensitive matters which should be reserved for the information of .
members of the Committee or the Chairman of the Committee.

y

I told Mr. Armstrong that the Bureau would have available
during his interview, though not present at the interview, a representative
who would provide him with counsel as to any problems concerning subjects
he may be reluctant to discuss with the Committee representative. I
explained that the FBI represe a" was not intended to inhibit any

Liaison with Capitol Hill by the Office of Legal Counsel resulted
in an arrangement whereby Laboratory representatives could meet with those
members of the Capitol Police Force handling security surveys for the
U, S. Congress. ““haboratory: “personnel met with members of the Capitol ‘Police
Fore Son 5/6/75 and 5/8/75 at their headquarters, 331 First Street, NE,
Washington, D. C., At the meeting on 5/6/75 an examination of their survey
equipment revealed that it was adequate, however it did not meet thé level
of sophistication or quality available at thé present state of the art.
Further discussion revealed that the training received by members of the
police force handling their responsibility was limited.

On 5/8/75 Laboratory Supervisors Wilbur G. Stevens and Joseph B.+
Parsons met with Chief James M. Powell and some of his staff members which’
included Deputy Chief Garner, Captain Brannon, Head of the Investigative
Unit, and Lieutenant Bell, Head of the Bomb Disposal Unit. ‘The discussion
at this meeting centered dround steps which could be taken to update their
present security survey equipment as well as additional measures which
could be put into practice to enhance their technical expertise in this
area. Laboratory personnel furnished them with the names of manufacturers +
of additional survey equipment as well as suggestions as to the establish- %

Memorandum W. E. Harward to Mr. Cochran

RE: SECURITY SURVEYS - SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE
ACTIVITIES - HOUSE SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES -
CAPITOL POLICE DEPARTMENT

At the conclusion of this conference, Chief Powell expressed
his sincere appreciation to the Bureau for the excellent help and
_ guidance extended to him and his staff in this matter of mutual interest,
and expressed the hope that he could call on us again in the event he
or his staff needed to tap our resevoir ef knowledge. The Chief was
assured that we would be available if needed in this capacity.

It appears that the Capitol Police Force has been forced into
the untenable position of handiing this responsibility for the Congress, .
and as a result are attempting to establish some degree of self-reliance
and outward credibility being completely inexperienced in this area of
technical expertise. Because of this, it is felt that the Bureau should
move cautiously in any continuing liaison with the Capitol Police
concerning security survey matters.

* RECOMMENDATION:
It is recommended that any continuing liaison with the
Capitol Hill Police Force be handled by mature and experienced

Special Agent Supervisors, who are completely familiar with security
survey matters.

INTERVIEWS OF FEI EMPLOYEES HERES 8
OR FORMER EMPLOYEES DATE

Bs = =

At the Executives Conference on May 22, 1975, I presented fo;
discussion the question of the procedures to be followed when former employees
or current empldyées of thé Bureau 7 are contacted for interview by staff
representatives of the Senate Select Committee, or are called for testimony
pursuant to a subpoena issued by the Committee. I explained the background
including the numerous attempts to arrive at a working arrangement with
the Committee in terms of stated guidelines and that all such efforts in the
past had proven unworkable.

I pointed out that when presented with the proposal that an agency
representative be present during interviews, the Committee met and voted
unanimously to reject that proposal. The issue of whether the agency
representative would be present during the interview therefore is a stumbling
block to the development of a reasonable procedure to be followed by th
Committee and by our present and former employees. I requestéd the
authority of the Executives Conference and approval of the Director to.
the requirement that a Bureau representative be present during interviews,
and following a vote such approval was given.

I then requested authority to undertake the development ofa
working understanding with the Committee in behalf of the Bureau by which
we would be given notice of the idantities of persons to be interviewed prior to
interview or testimony, that we would be advised of the subject matter of the

Re: Senate Select Committee, etc.

interview or testimony, and afforded an opportunity to discuss with the
witness those areas of the proposed interview or testimony which would
require no special arrangements and those areas which would require the
information possessed by the witness to be furnished to members of the
Committee or to the Chairman exclusively.

We also wanted an opportunity prior to interview to furnish the
witnesses information concerning their Constitutional rights, their rights
pursuant to the Committee’s rules, and to advise them concerning the extent
to which they were released from obligations of secrecy made to the FBI, and
to the procedures necessary to obtain authority of the Department to respond
to a subpoena.

Following discussion and vote this matter also was approved.

Pursuant to such authority, I met with K. William O'Connor,
Deputy Assistant Attorney General, from approximately 4:00 p.m. to 5:20 p.m.
on May 22, 1975, accompanied by Inspector John B. Hotis. I explained to
Mr. O'Connor that the Director was desirous of having the Committee under-
stand that the FBI wanted to be cooperative to the extent that it was possible
and consistent with the need to protect the identities of informants, sensitive
sources of information and methods, on-going investigations and other current
operations and personal privacy. Because of this view of the Director and the
Bureau, we desired to make known to the Committee the fact that we would
not insist on the presence of a Bureau representative during actual interviews
of testimony of present or former employees, but we would want an under-
standing with the Committee and the Committee staff that the Bureau would
be given prior notice of the identities of proposed witnesses, the subject
matter of the proposed interview or testimony, and an opportunity prior to
interview or testimony for the Bureau to consult with the employee in order
to release him from his obligations of secrecy to the extent possible for
purposes of the interview or testimony.

I restated our position that we were not endeavoring to deter
testimony rather we were attempting to facilitate testimony under reasonable
eonditions and we felt that these matters should be discussed with the
Committee. I told Mr. O'Connor that we were aware of the numerous
discussions, proposals and conferences that have been held in an effort
to establish specific formal guidelines with the Committee, but that all such
efforts in behalf of the White House staff and the intelligence community at

Re: Senate Select Committee, etc.

large have not been successful. I told him that therefore we felt it would
be appropriate for the FBI to express our view fo the Committee because
interviews of FBI personnel and former employees have been conducted
and are scheduled in the near future.

Mr. O'Connor said that he understood the Director's view that
he desired to cooperate with the Committee and he felt that such cooperation
could be negotiated if we were to offer the Committee as trading material
COINTELPRO files. I told Mr. O'Connor that we were not going to negotiate
an understanding concerning witness interview procedures on the basis of
trading any of our files. He then suggested that we negotiate the May 14,
1975, letter which was addressed to the Attorney General by Senator Church
and use that negotiation as a basis for trdding with the Committee to develop
workable guidelines. I again told Mr. O'Connor that I considered the question
of procedural arrangements for witness inerviews to be a very broad question and |
one that went far beyond the requests in the May 14, 1975, letter. I told him
that I felt confident that the May 14, 1975, letter would be followed by perhaps
an even longer letter with more requests and that such matters should be
negotiated individually.

Mr. O'Connor then said that it was his strong view that a letter
should be addressed to the Committee complaining of the treatment of FBI
witnesses, particularly regarding violations of the Committee's own rules
in that it appeared that during recent interviews the Committee had not
furnished witness a copy of the rules in sufficient time and the treatment by
staff representatives & the Committee staff}of witnesses had been improper.

I told Mr. O'Connor that I thought that our efforts to develop
a working relationship with the Committee could be seriously impaired at
this time should a protest letter be sent to Senator Church because a formal
communication of that nature would require some reaction on the part of the
Committee and I could see no benefit to our present efforts to establish
procedures by which we could reasonably cooperate with the Committee.

Mr. O'Connor then suggested that a letter might be addressed
to Senator Church which described our concern that in the absence of
reasonable procedures witnesses' rights might be impaired and that for that

Re: Senate Select Committee

reason and for the reason that the Director desired to be cooperative with
the Committee, we would request a meeting with Senator Church and
Senator Tower to arrive at an understanding as to procedures. I told
Mr. O'Connor that I would consider such a letter aniivt ld discuss
the matter with the Deputy Attorney General and with James Wilderotter
at the White House.

At approximately 9:05 a.m. on May 23, 1975, Mr. O'Connor
called me and said that he had discussed the matter with Mr. Wilderotter
and the Deputy Attorney General. He said that both had agreed that it was
inopportune at this time to seek special guidelines for irterviews of FBI
personnel and former personnel with the Committee. He said that a meeting
has been scheduled for Tuesday, May 27, 1975, at noon in a final
effort to resolve an understanding with Committee representatives. He
said at the present time it is proposed that the meeting be attended by
Wilderotter and Roderick Hills, representing the White House; Hoffman,
representing the Defense Department; Warner, representing CIA; and
O'Connor representing the Justice Department. Committee representatives
would be Schwarz, Chief Counsel, and John Elliff. He said that at this
time it was his thought that the Deputy Attorney General and I should not
attend the meeting. He gave as his reasoning the thought that "should
something go wrong" the Deputy Attorney General could disassociate himself
from any agreement arrived at, and that I would similarly be in a position
of saying that we have not been a party to the agreement.

Ireminded Mr. O'Connor that meetings have been held frequently
in the past and that tentative understandings made at such meetings have dis-
appeared shortly after the meeting was concluded. I told him that was
significant to us because we now understand that two more former
employees of the FBI have been contacted and may be interviewed in the
near future. I told him that former SA Sam Papich and former Agent Nichols
have been contacted. I told him that the extent to which we should release
these two former employees from their obligation of secrecy could not be
intelligently evaluated unless we.:knew the subject matter of the interviews
and that we plan to contact the Committee to inquire as to the subject
matter. I pointed out to him that such pending interviews make it imperative
for the FBI to consider action in addition to meetings that may be planned
to discuss guidelines.

-4- CONTINUED _ OVER



Memorandum to Mr. Adams
Re: Senate Select Committee

Mr. O'Connor asked that we not contact the Committee directly
at this time, but that we allow him to call John Elliff and Schwarz to a
request that he be advised of the identity of all proposed FBI witnesses
and of the subject matter of the proposed interviews, and that such inter-
views or testimony not go forward pending developments of an agreement
on guidelines. O'Connor promised that he would make the contact promptly
and advise me today of the results. I agreed to withhold our contact
pending receipt of the information from him.

Mr. O'Connor then insisted that a letter be prepared for the
Attorney General to send to Senator Church pointing out the failure of the
Committee to afford complete protection of the rights of witnesses. I
declined to undertake that responsibility and I told him the reason was that
a formal document addressed to the Chairman of the Committee would tend
to impair our efforts to negotiate with the Committee and certainly would be
untimely in view of the conference he described as being scheduled for next
Tuesday at noon.

Mr. O'Connor then said he would hate to have to tell the Deputy
Attorney General that the FBI declined to prepare such a draft. I told him
that not only would I not mind him telling the Deputy Attorney General, but
I wished he would tell the Deputy Attorney General and explain my reason
for not sending such a formal letter addressed to Senator Church at this
time. Mr. O'Connor said that "well everyone else agrees to the letter,"
and I told him the FBI:does not agree.

Mr. O'Connor said that if he was going to have to draft the
letter for the Attorney General's signature, he would do it, but that he would
need the information concerning the interviews of former SA Devlin and
former SA Sentinella. I told Mr. O'Connor that the information concerning
Sentinella was en route to him already and that we would endeavor to
furnish him as promptly as possible any additional information available
to us concerning these interviews.

At 11:13 a.m. on May 23, 1975, Mr. O'Comnor called me and
said that he had just concluded a conversation with John Elliff during which

Elliff agreed that in regard to the scheduled interview of former SA Sam Papich
on May 29, 1975, at 9:00 a.m., he would furnish us the substance of the

-5- CONTINUED ~ OVER

NW 65360 Docld:32989588 Page 103


€ @ @

Memorandum to Mr. Adams
Re: Senate Select Committee

questions to be asked Mr. Papich. He said that Elliff was agreeable to

an informal arrangement under which the FBI would not require the
presence of a Bureau representative at such interviews, but would expect
to receive the identity of persons to be interviewed plus a statement as to
the subject matter of the interview. Elliff then proceeded to identify as
those persons scheduled for interview as William Turner, who will be
interviewed today or this weekend by Mike Epstein at San Francisco, and
"Chick" Brennan, who was interviewed yesterday, May 22, 1975, by Mark
Gitenstein and who may be interviewed again today.

As to the interview of Sam Papich, Elliff said that the interview
would concern:

1. A liaison agreement between the FBI and CIA;

2, The abolition of Papich's liaison responsibilities in 1970;

3. Dissatisfaction by the FBI with the Huston Plan;

4, The views in the White House regarding the intelligence
community and the FBI with reference to a conversation Elliff had with
Mr. Wannall and Mr. Cregan on May 22, 1975;

5. A detailed follow-up on the discussions with Mr. Wannalk.

6. A copy of the Huston Plan and certain minutes taken of
meetings at which the Huston Plan was discussed. These minutes allegedly
were made by William Cregar;

7. The matter raised with Paul Daly on May 22, 1975. (Mr. Daly
recalled that Mr. ELliff discussed an incident concerning the CIA and the
FEI which occurred at Denver, Colorado. )

Mr. O'Connor said that an interview proposed with former

SA Nichols has been postponed indefinitely according to Elliff because
of Nichols' unavailability.

Memorandum to Mr. Adams
Re: Senate Select Committee

Mr. O'Connor noted that even though formal ezrcext rules
have not been agreed upon with the Committee, it appears that Elliff's
cooperation in furnishing the above information indicates a willingness
to abide by the terms and conditions that I had requested Mr. O'Connor
to seek in behalf of the FEI.

In this developing cooperation with Elliff, it is my opinion that |
we should not participate in the conference at noon on Tuesday, May 27, 1975,
at which time the broad proposals by Wilderotter will be discussed. It is
to the interest of the FBI to develop a cooperative attitude on the part of
Elliff and his staff and that is being accomplished.

Reference is made to memorandum from captioned

Committee dated April 30, 1975, and the appendices thereto,

which contained requests for documents and other information

from the FBI.

In connection with Part four, concérning the FBI's
filing system and printed forms utilized by this Bureau,
enclosed are copies of the following:

1. Undated nine-page memorandum captioned "FBI
Indexing Procedures.”

2. One copy each of 13 Tables of Contents
eoncerning forms utilized by this Bureau.

Concerning theegr's filing system and_the Committee's
requests for a so-calledi@lerk's Manual;" and for a list of
FRI classifications used in its filing system, it will be
noted that the nine-page memorandum contains the list of clas~
sifications. With respect to the so~called "Clerk's Manual,”
the Piles and Communications Division of the FBI maintains
detailed instructions which are followed by its employees in
classifying mail for indexing. It is not known whether such
instructions are what is referred to by the Committee as the
Assoc. dx. —_"Clerk*s Manual." These instructions consist of nine volumes
de ADAin-- OF Material. Because of their bulkiness and because it is not
wee — clear whether this material would serve the Committee's purpose,
yoetaa it is not being furnished at this time. However, it will be
available for review at FBI Headquarters by the Committee Staff.

PILING SYSTEI

The following will explain the Tables of Contents
concerning FBI forms which are being furnished in Llicu of the
actual forms at this time. This procedure is being followed
because the forms number nearly 2,000 and many will probably
be of no interest to the Committes. I£ the Conmittec: will
xvoview these Tables of Contents and advise which forme it
desires to see, appropriate steps will then be taken to maze
them available to the Committee Staff. “he Tables of Contents
headed "FBI Form Book" lists all FBI FD (Field Division) forms
which are in use throughout the field. The remaining Tables
of Contents list those forms applicable to the worl: of snecifie
FBI Divisions at Headquarters. Por example, forms with tho
prefix "1" are us ed in Division One (Identification) ; oe 3e
with prefix °2" are used in Division Tvo (fraining); ©
Shere arc no forms peculiar to Divisions 11 (Legal counsel)
and 13 (Office of Planning and Bvaluation). Those forms with
prefix “O" (omnibus) arc for use by two or more Divisions at
Hoadquarters.

NOTE:

Clearance for making these Tables of Contents available
vas obtained from the Training Division for the FD forms and
from each Division for its applicable forms. The Files and

The Senate Select Committee has expressed an wungent

interest in the details of any FBI investigation concerning ~tkhe
disappearance of Thomas Riha, former Professor at University of
Colorado, Boulder, Colorado, in March, 1969. The Bureau con-
ducted no investigation regarding the disappearance. There was
considerable publicity with reference to a statement made by

Dr. Smiley, then President of the university, that he had been
informed by a Government official that Riha "was alive and weli"
Smiley was interviewed by the El Paso Office. Smiley furnished
information in the strictest of confidence, not to be dissemin-
ated to any outside agency, regarding his contacts with a CIA
‘representative in Bouldér after the Riha disappearance. It was
the CIA official who told him that Riha was alive and well.
Without the Smiley interview our response to the Senate Select
Committee has an obvious gap. If the Committee calls any wit-
nesses in the Riha matter Dr. Smiley would be one of the most
logical persons to call. The passage of time and other factors
may have brought about a change in the mind of Dr. Smiley
regatding the necessity to keep the information funn
ina confidential xelationship with the Bureau and itN
believed he should be given the opportunity to either Rainfowys
his request for confidentiality or release the Bureau
restriction he imposed. RA 4

Set out helow is information voluntarily furnished
to the FBI by retired SA John BP. Deviin following his voluntary
appearance before Senator Mondale and Staff Members of the
Senate Select Committee on May 19, 1975. Deviin's appearance
followed an interview of him by Senate Select Committee Staff
Member Michael T. Epstein on April 25, 1975. A memorandum
veporting the results of the April 25, 1975, interview was for-
warded to the Attorney General as an enclosure to my letter to
the Attorney General dated May 8, 1975, entitled "United States
Senate Select Committee to Study Governmental Operations with
Respect to intelligence Activities."

On May 19, 1975, Devlin was interviewed by Senator
Hondale; SSC Chief Counsel Frederick A. 0, Schwarz, Jr. |
Assistant Minority Counsel Charles Kirbow; and Epstein. The
interview was conducted in a building across the street from
the Dirksen Building in Washington, D, C., and lasted from
approximately 2:00 p.m. to 3:20 p.m. Devlin was not subpoenaed
to appear but appeared voluntarily. He was placed under oath
hy Senator Mondale.

At the outset of the interview Devlin was advised of.
Assoc 0r, . hig rights; that he could be represented by counsel and that
Dep. ADAdm.- 3 he had none, but desired counsel, the Committee Staff would:
attempt to provide one for him. At the conclusion of the inter-
view he was thanked but given no indication as to whether he

Re: Interview of Retired Special Agent (SA)
by Scnator Walter F. Mondale and
Staff Members of the Canate Select
Committee (SSC)

Following being advised of his rights, Devlin
was asked who sent him to Atlantic City and why he was sent.
He advised he received his instructions from Special Agent in
Charge Ralph Bachman through Devlin's supervisor, SA Vincent
Garphy. It is to be noted here that upon being interviewed by
Epstein on April 25, 1975, Devlin had indicated he had received
his instructions through his supervisor, SA William Gagnon.
Devlin corrected this mistake during the interview of liay 1°,
1975. As to why he was sent, Devlin advised that as a sound
aan of the Howark Office he vas sent to Atlantic City,
Jersey, to install a technical surveillance on Martin Jarther
c ating Yho occupied a room at the Claridge Uotel “in that
city. Devlin was asked whether tha monitoring plant for the
electronic surveillance was located in the same hotel. Upon
being advised it was the intervievers' desire to know whether
tho lecation of the plant at the Claridge Hotel was also designed
to serve as a physical lookout on King’s room, Devlin advised
he was not aware that the FBI employed a physical loolzout on
Ring's hotel room. Devlin was also asked whether he installed
a microphone in the room of King. He advised that he had not
because it vas not technically feasible. Also of concern to
those interviewing Devlin on May 19, vas whether he had parsonal
knowledge as to whether the Attorney General had approved the
electronic surveillance on King's telephone. Devlin replied he
had no personal knowledge but assumed such authority had been
obtained by his supervisor. Povlin was also asked if he could
recall any conversations over King's phone which were monitored.
Davlin replied that the only recollection he had involved con-

Re: Interview of Retired Special Agent (SA)
by Senator Walter F, Mondale and
Staff Hembers of the Senate Select
Committee (SSC)

notes regarding-the activity that occurred in Atlantic City during
the Democratic Party Nominating Convention during the summer of
1964. Devlin advised that he did not retain any notes but sub-
sequent to the original contact of-‘him by Epstein, Devlin called
SA John Connelly of the FBI Office in Newark in an effort to
review any available material that might refresh his recollection.
Connelly advised Devlin that all materials and notes retained by
the Newark Office were forwarded to FBI Headquarters. This infor-
mation was conveyed to the interviewers on the occasion of the
May 19, 1975, interview.

Devlin also was asked if he ever questioned the tech-
nical coverage of King inasmuch as it appeared to be for
political rather than security reasons. Devlin replied that he
had no reason to question the technical coverage of King. He
also was asked if he personally met with Mr. Cartha DeLoach of
the FBI while both were in Atlantic City. Devlin advised he
could not recall whether he actually met DeLoach, pointing out
that SA Billie D. Williams was assigned the liaison responsibility
with DcLoach.

Devlin was asked whether he had contacted the FBI
following his original interview by Epstein on April 25,
1975. Deviin advised he had reported the interview by
Epstein to the FBI Office in Newark, New Jersey. We further
advised that subsequent to this, he received a call from Newark
Assistant Special Agent in Charge Herbert Clough who informed
him that should he be contacted in the future, and should he
feel he needed to consult with FBI officials, he could call the 4
Legal Counsel Division, FBI Headquarters, in Washington, D, C.,
collect, for such consultation. Senator Mondale desired to know
who Devlin saw upon his arrival in Washington, D. C., on the
morning of May 19, 1975, and specifically what instructions he
received from the FBI. Devlin advised Senator Mondale that

Dear Mr. Chairman:,

In my letter to you on 20 May 1975 I requested your
-assistance in making the Joint Committee's secure storage
facilities available for the retention of certain sensitive 7
material to which access is needed by the Senate Select
Committee to Study Governmental Operations with Respect
to Intelligence Activities. Those arrangements have been
made with Mr. George Murphy and with the Select Committee.
I want to thank you for making the facilities available and for
permitting Mr. Murphy to be the custodian of the material.

A further need has now arisen for the same kind of
arrangement for the House Select Committee on Intelligence.
Again I would be very grateful to you and Mr. Murphy if a
similar arrangement could be made for the members of the
House Committee and members of the Committee staff
designated for access to such material by mutual agreement
of Chairman Nedzi and myself.

Reference is made to my memorandum dated 5/19/75
advising of the receipt of a letter from the Senate Select

Committee (SSC) to the Attorney General dated 5/14/75, appendilg
requests for additional documents and other information.

Specific attention is invited to Appendix A, item
number 5, which requests:

discussing the legal authority of the FBI to use the followin
techniques to (1) investigate internal security matters, (2)

collect intelligence information, and (3) engage in counter-

intelligence activities (see letter from the Chief Counsel to
the Deputy Attorney General dated April 23, 1975):

Appendix B, item number 4, requests:

Appendix A above, all memoranda and other materials relating

to:

The original decision to utilize the technique in
internal security, intelligence collection, and/or
counterintelligence matters, operations, or

The policies and procedures of the FBI for the
utilization of the technique in internal security,

It would appear appropriate that response to Appendix
A, item number 5, be prepared by the Legal Counsel Division..
It is also apparent that response to Appendix B, item number 4, '~
should be closely coordinated although responsibility for research
in this area would appear to fall more logically within the
Intelligence Division.

Director See"y —

At approximately 9:00 a.m. on May 21, 1975, retired Lf bt
Special Agent Alan G. Sentinella appeared in my office prior to 4
his g~pointment to receive a subpoena and to testify at 9:30 a.m. on 5/21/75
at Washington, D.C., before the Senate Select Committee. I told
Mr. Sentinella that it would not be possible for me to furnish him personal
counsel prior to or during his testimony, however I felt it was appropriate
for me to furnish him certain information. I told Mr. Sentinella that he
was entitled to be represented by a personal counsel of his own choice
at any time and that if he chose to secure the services of a private attorney
he was at liberty to do so.

Select Committee (Rule 6.4), a witness may be accompanied by counsel
during testimony and a witness who is unable to obtain counsel may

_inform the Committee of that fact and the Committee is obliged to endeavor
to obtain voluntary counsel for the witness. I told him that the rules
further provide that the failure to obtain counsel would not excuse him from
appearing and testifying.

ye
T also told Mr. Sentinella that under the rules of the Senate ie

Iasked Mr. Sentinella whether he had been given any advice
by the Committee concerning his right to counsel and whether he had received
a copy of the Committee's rules as required by regulations in the rules
(Rule 6.1). Mr. Sentinella said that he had not been so advised and he had
not been given a copy of the rules by any representative of the Committee.

PERSONNEL RECORDS UNE

COPY RETAINED IN

I told Mr. Sentinella that as to matters other than the presence _
of personal counsel, no understanding had been reached with the Committee.

Memorandum to Mr. Adams
Re: Senate Select Committee

I further explained to him that the Attorney General Order relating to
responses to subpoenas would apply to him and that we had been advised

that the Department had approved a waiver of the Attorney General Order
limitation permitting his testimony, but only as to matters concerning
Martin Luther King, Jr., and Stanley David Levison, and the Southern’
Christian Leadership Conference, including related matters. I told

Mr. Sentinella that should the questioning involve other areas and he was

in doubt as to his authorization to respond, he could request an opportunity to
consult with the Department to secure approval for his testimonyfgonsistent
with the terms of the Attorney General Order. I also reminded Mrx_Sentinella
that a representative of the F BI would be available during his testimony

for such consultation as he felt might be necessary. I told him that

i SA Paul Daly would be available for that purpose. nt

I told Mr. Sentinella that our concern is not that matters of
historical fact might be revealed, but that testimony which might be
j required of him could impair the Bureau's current efforts to discharge its
| responsibilities. I explained that in specific terms what this meant was that
information that would identify sensitive sources, techniques or methods,
or that would identify confidential informants, or would expose current
investigative operations should be reserved for members of the Committee
or perhaps the Chairman of the Committee depending upon the sensitivity
of the particular information. I advised him that in the event such matters
are involved in the questioning he could request consultation and that
arrangements could be made for the answers to be supplied under appropriately
limited conditions. I told Mr. Sentinella that as to other areas of possible
testimony, the Bureau would impose no request that he decline to answer
questions.

Mr. Sentinella advised me that he understood the matters I
had explained to him and that he did not at this time feel the need of personal
counsel because he said that he did not regard the appearance as one in the
nature of a grand jury appearance. I told Mr. Sentinella that he should
be aware that his testimony would be given under oath and in the event
he made a satement that was self-incriminatory, it could be used against
him. I reminded him I was not advising him in order to deter him from
furnishing testimony, but only telling him of the protections he has under the

Memorandum to Mr. Adams
Re: Senate Select Committee

Constitution against self-incrimination. He said he would keep
that matter in mind.

Mr. Sentinella said that he would like to volunteer the
results of his interview at the conclusion of the interview and he also
would like to have an opportunity to review a transcript of the testimony
for accuracy.

RECOMMENDATION:

For information.

This is in response to: your memoranda, entitled as above,
gated May 8, 1974 and August 19, 1974, directed to the Deputy
Attorney. General, Criminal Division, ana xeferring to pro-
blems which have arisen as-a result Of the promulgation of
‘Executive Order 11785 which amends Executive Order 10450. in
view of the involvement of my staff in -these matters, I will
undertake to answer your questions with the concurrence of the
: 4inal Division. i :

i 7
z ‘Rs you know this matter has been under continuing review
both in the Task Force, chaired by a representative of this
office, of working level representatives of various agencies
in the security field and is now under study to a lesser degree
in Project #10 of the "Domestic Council on Privacy*™.

“

" You ask that the Department; (a) provide specific instxuc-
.tions to the Bureau to conduct intelligence-type investigations
“to identify and determine the activities of organizations now
@escribed in the amended Section 8(a) (5) of Executive Order
10450; (b) furnish guidelines to be used by the Bureau in ini-
tiating investigations of individuals under the captioned matter
pursuant to Executive Order 10450 and specifically, criteria to
be utilized in determining whether available information is.a
sufficient basis for investigation. ae
Under the amendment to Section 8(a) (5) of Executive Order
10450, we now have only two types of organizations; (1) those
which unlawfully advocate. or practice the commission of acts
of force or violence to prevent others from exercising their
xights under the constitution or laws of the United States or

~.

Nw'@@Ag0 Docld:32989588 Page 190
4



any State, (2) or which seek to overthrow the Government of
the United States, or any State or subdivision thereof, by -

unlawful means: (Emphasis added).

Of course, the key words which are underlined indicate
that the investigation should be initially based on a possible
violation of a federal (such as the Smith Act) or state statute
prohibiting unlawful advocacy or the commission of any unlawful
act of force or violence. However, in order for the Bureau to
detect organizations with a potential of the above nature, it

ant that the investigation proceed on the basis of in-
formation indicating that the organization may be of the nature
mentioned. It is not necessary’ that a crime occur before the
investigation is initiated, but.only that a reasonable evaluation
of the available information suggests that the activities of the
organization may fall within the proscription of the Order. The
most recent example of the type of organization, ‘that you have
advised is becoming more prevalent, is the small but dedicated
to violence, Symbionese Liberation Army (SLA). Organizations. of
this nature would cleariy fait within the Order and should be
investigated as soon as information is available indicating their
potentiality for violence and of course, if possible, prior to
the fulfillment of their purposes.

It is true that Executive Order 11785 eliminated the prior
communist, totalitarian, fascist, and subversive characterizations
and definitions, but there was no intention of restricting the
investigations of such organizations if their programs call for
acts of force or violence or the unlawful advocacy of.the com-

-mission of acts of force or violence in furtherance of these

programs.

‘It is not possible to set definite parameters covering the
initiation of investigations of potential organizations falling
within the Order but once-‘the investigation reaches a stage that
offers a basis for determining that the activities are legal in
nature, then the investigation should cease, but if the investi-
gation suggests a*determination that the organization is engaged
in illegal activities or potentially illegal activities it should
continue,

* It follows in answer to-your second question that individ-
uals who are active either as members of or as affiliates of

2

NW 65360 Docld:32989588 Page 191
| -aeT

\



Zations déScribed above should be investigated when
jmation is received indicating their involvement. The
yardstick indicated above for organizations in deter-

ing whether the investigation should continue, should apply
jncerning individuals and when a determination can reasonably
ye made that the individuals activities, either within the
organization or as an individual, do not appear to be in vio-
lation of any law, then the investigation should cease.

On 5-22-75 CIA en from the FBI copies of
photographs of three "bums" who were taken into custody by Dallas |
authorities on 11-22-63 in the vicinity of the Texas School Book
Depository. It has been alleged that the three persons shown in the
photographs were E. Howard Hunt and Frank Sturgis, individuals .
involved in the Watergate ‘incident, and Thomas Arthur Vallee, who
was arrested in Chicago, Dlinois, several days before the Kenedy
assassination based on a threat against the President. Don Donahue,
Special Assistant to Senator Henry Jackson (D-Wash.),made available
on 9-12-74 to Inspector Bowers a set of the photographs depicting these
"bums" which had been furnished to Donahue by one Michael Canfield,
and the FBI Laboratory made copies from these prints, the original
being returned to Donahue. Donahue requested that his identity be ,
concealed as the source of these photographs. Canfield was supposed to

furnish a set of these photographs to Washington Field Office but it has
been determined he never did so.

At Mr. Adams' instructions, Bowers contacted Donahue
on 5-22-75 and advised him of the CIA request for a set of these photographs.
Donahue was told that if he has no objections we intend to furnish CIA a
set of the pictures with the statement that the originals were obtained from
an individual who requested his identity be concealed, Donahue stated that ©
was quite satisfactory to him, adding that if it becomes necessary he_
agree to his identity being disclosed : as “a source of these pictiirés

United States Senate Select Committee (SSC) with appendices

A thru D. The memorandum noted the ambiguous nature of some

of the SSC requests and that Mr. K. William O'Conner, Deputy

Assistant Attorney General, who is the Department of Justice

coordinator for SSC matters, is presently negotiating the 5/14/75

requests with the SSC Staff.

Even though the negotiations are still under way, we RY
believe that ultimately we will be required to provide substantia :
responses to the 5/14/75 requests. To this end we have begun
to gather together the necessary data from our files in anticipa-
tion of the substantial responses we will be required to prepare.
The various requests set forth in the May 14, letter have been
analyzed and specific assignments made to prepare responses. The
primary assignments have been made to representatives of several
Sections of the INTD. It is anticipated that in some circumstances
it will be necessary for these INTD representatives to convey
requests for information and material to other Divisions. When
such action is necessary contact will be effected through the

= designated representatives of the other Headquarters Divisions.
= A list of such other Divisional representatives is maintained
8 by the SENSTUDY Staff on the basis of designations made to assist
Bes in previous SSC requests, and is set forth below.

Dear Hr. Seidel:

Reference is mada to your telephone call to me on May 16,
1975, in which you advised that the Committee was gathering
facts concerniny the FBI's various CoIntelPros and in
particular, you were looking into the CoIntelPro having

to do with the Black Panthers. You inguired if I recalled a
Letter, which had been made public, dated May 11, 1970, from
the Director, FBI, to the SAC, San Francisco, which suggested
disruptive techniques against the Black Panthers and which
mentioned spurious police or FBI reports. I advised you I
had no first hand recollection of having seen such a document
at that timo, but that I had read a recent news item describ-
ing such a document.

You also indicated an interest in the theoretical question as
to whether intelligence functions should be divorced from
enforcement functions in order to avoid the dilemma of dis-
closure versus dismissal, and you suggested that my views on
this might be helpful in educating the Committee.

For your information, I entered on duty as a Special Agent on
January 5, 1942, and retired from the Bureau on December 3,
1971. During the two years immediately preceding my retirement
I served as supervisor of a squad of agents which investigated,
among other matters, violations and alleged violations of law
by the Black Panthers. The only information I have concerning
the Black Panthers was learned as a direct result of my official
duties. I have made no independent study of them, nor do I
have any personal files or written material, either official

or otherwise, relating to then,

Since speaking with you, I have reviewed Executive Order $501-73
(28 C.F.R.§§ 16.21, 16.22 and 16.23) which specifies that no
employee or former employee of the Department of Justice shall
produce any materLal contained in the files of the Dapartment



Hr. Lester B. Seidel
May 19, 1975
Page -2~

nor shall he disclose any information acquired in the performance
of his official duties without prior approval of the Attorney
General or appropriate Departmental official.

From this, I must conclude that I am prohibited from furnishing
you or the Committee any information along the lines requested
by you unless appropriate authority to do so has first been
given by an authorized representative of the Department of
Justice.

Very truly yours,

DAVID E. TODD

Dear Me. Attorney General:

On behalf of the Senate Select Committee To Study Governmental
Operations With Respect To Intelligence Activities, Senator Tower and
T want to thank you for the opportunity we had on February 26, 1975,
to discuss the work of the Committee. I want to express my personal.
appreciation for your willingness to assist the Committee to meet its
responsibilities under the mandate of S. Res. 21. I believe we are in
agreement that the work of the Committee should proceed as expeditiously
as possible.

Toward that end we are seeking initial documentation from various
agencies whose activities fall within the mandate given us by the Senate.
Enclosed with this letter is a copy of an initial request for documents
i relating to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, which has been previous];
| discussed with staff representatives of the Bureau. With the unanimous
t approval of the Committee, I respectfully request that the documents be
supplied to the Committee at the earliest opportunity.

We expect to make similar initial requests for documents to other
parts of your Department that fall under the mandate of S. Res. 21.

I I trust that our respective staffs will continue to work together
in the spirit of mutual cooperation which we both recognize is necessary
i to ensure a thorough and expeditious investigation.

Memorandum to Mr. W. R. Wannall
RE: SENSTUDY 75
62-116395

By memorandum dated 5/6/75, we advised the AG that
the requested position paper of 7/31/72 is an internal deliberative
document which we feel is inappropriate to furnish the Select
Committee. This position is consistent with the position previously
expressed by the AG. During the meeting with EL1Liff he was orally
advised of the Bureau's position regarding making the 7/31/72
position paper available to the Select Committee,

The Appendices which have not yet been made available
to the Select Committee are being cleared with other agencies
under the Third Agency rule requirement and will be made available
to the Select Committee once all clearances have been obtained.
E1Lif£ was orally apprised of this.

During: the course of the meeting, Mr. ELLiff stated
that he felt the FBI's concerted investigative effort in the
early 1960s against the Klan and later our investigative effort
arising out of the ghetto riots were justified given the situation
at that time. However, he felt the Committee would probably
like to do an in-depth case study of both investigations. He
asked if the FBI could provide the Committee with copies of all
memoranda and documents reflecting the decision making process
leading up to the initiation of the major ‘investigative effort
against the Klan as well as investigations during and following
the ghetto riots. EL1iff was advised that we certainly would
consider responding following receiptoof a formal written request
from Senator Church through the AG. El1liff advised he would
prepare such a written request,

The Intélligence Division has already instituted the
necessary research in anticipation of this request and will submit
recommendations following a completion of this research.

In anticipation of Select Committee hearings which are
expected to begin in about one month, Mr. El1liff and Gitenstein
expect to start interviews of current Bureau employees in Bureau
}space during the week of 5/19/75. Mr. Gitenstein will concentrate
lon the work of the Internal Security Branch of the Intelligence
Division and Mr. ELLiff on the Counterintelligence Branch. We
expect that Mr. E11iff will begin his interviews by meeting with
Assistant Director Wannall, Inspector Leavitt and the Section
Chiefs of the Counterintelligence Branch.

Memorandum to Mr. W. R. Wannall
RE: ‘SENSTUDY 75
62-116395

It is noted that we previously furnished to the
Select Committee with the AG's approval one copy each of
Sections 87 and 122 of the Manual of Instructions. Section 87
is concerned with investigations of subversive organizations —
and individuals. Section 122 addresses extremist matters and
civil unrest. In his discussion of these two Sections it was
readily apparent Mr. Gitenstein had conducted a thorough review.
In this regard, he noted a difference in the investigative procedure
outlined in these two Sections of the Manual. Mr. Gitenstein
was advised that the. Intelligence Division had just completed
a Manual revision combining these two Sections into one and had
submitted it to the Director for his approval. Mr. Gitenstein
commented this was an'excellent idea to combine these two Sections
into one and expressed the hope that the revised Section could
be made available to the Committee for its review in anticipation
of the forthcoming Committee hearings.

At the conelusion of the meeting, E1Lliff asked whether
the FBI would .be willing to meet with the Staff to discuss such
sensitive issues as surreptitious entry, the opening of mail, and
incommunicado interviews. Elliff was advised that the Bureau was
aware of certain allegations that have appeared in the press and
felt that any interviews in sensitive areas should be restricted |
to the Senators on the Committee. E11iff interposed no objection
to this suggestion.

The thrust of the meeting gave Bureau officials present
the impression that the task force was primarily concerned with
identifying what areas of the Bureau's investigative responsi-
bilities needed to be better defined through new legislation.

In fact, E1liff solicited the observations of those present as

to what the Bureau's needs were in the way of new legislation

to permit the Bureau to carry out its internal security responsi-
bilities effectively. He recognized certain limitations involving
records of educational institutions, banking institutions, telephone
companies and credit establishments currently restrict the Bureau ~
and suggest that some legislation with Congressional oversight
should be written to assist the FBI in carrying out its mission.

MsifORANDUM he

Froas John ELLi££

Subject: “Intelligence Division Position Paper on Jurisdiction"

dated February 13, 1975

1. The following documents directly related to this Position ~
Paper have not been supplied to the Select Committee:

(1) The previous Position Paper, dated July 31, 1972.

(2) Appendices I, J, K, M, and P.
s u .

2. Parts I and II discuss the Presidential directives which
may serve as the basis for FBI national security intelligence
activities. Part IV lists statutes. and Executive Orders
affecting FBI jurisdiction. There is no mention in Parts I and
II of the first Executive Order cited in Part IV. This is
Executive Order #11605, dated July 2, 1971, amending Executive
Orcer #10450, of April 27, 1953, relating to security require-

ae
These Executive Orders have been further amended by
a more recent Executive Order of June 4, 1974. This latest
order abolishéd the so-called “Attorney General's List" and
revised the criteria for determining the suitability a
loyalty of Government employees.
The following questions arise:

_ (1) In what way, if any, do the Executive orders
relating to employment security provide a legal
basis for FBI intelligence activities?

(2) In what way, if any, did the Executive Order of
June 4, 1974, affect the legal basis for FBI
intelligence activities?

3. The analysis in Parts” tr and II discusses the legal basis
for FBI national security intelligence investigations. There
is no specific discussion of other intelligence activities.
These other activities are variously described in the attached
documents and quoted memoranda. The terms used include
“counterespionage" (Presidential Directive of June 26, 1939),

Le ee
i. vo bi -leeA ~ 1OP

"to neutralize Communist front and Communist-dominated organi-~
zations of the United States" (IIC and ICIS Report to NSC,
March 5, 1954), "program designed to intensify any confusion and
- @issatisfaction among its /Communist Party's/ members" and ~
"“counterintelligence operations" (NSC Briefing, November 6, 1958),
“action proposals to protect the internal security of the United
States" (National Security Action Memorandum 161, June 9, 1962).
The term "counterespionage" reappears in several other documents.
These terms seem to refer to activities which have since
been labeled COINTELPRO operations. In this regard, it should
be noted that Attorney General Saxbe's-report of November 18,
1974 on FBI COINTELBRO Activities stated, at p. 20:
“(2) Espionage or Soviet-Satellite Intelligence
This program, although officially designated
a COINTELPRO program, emphasized intelligence gathering
and counterintelligence efforts already being pursued
in connection with the Bureau's ongoing foreign intelli-
gence responsibilities. It did not curtail any activity
or in any way change the scope of counterintelligence
efforts already in effect and continuing today. It was
primarily intended to inspire initiative and to encourage
ingenuity in the Bureau's continuing counterintelligence
efforts against hostile foreign intelligence services.”
--In the interest of the national security, no
= statistics or examples of the types of actions imple~
-* mented under this program may appropriately be disclosed."

This passage seems to say that the FBI continues to perform
other activities going beyond investigation and directed at
hostile foreign intelligence services.

The following questions arise:

(1) In what way, if any, do the Presidential directives
discussed in Parts I and II provide a legal basis
for FBI national security intelligence activities
beyond investigations? :

(2) In what way, if any, do the Presidential directives
discussed in Parts I and II provide a legal basis
for the COINTELPRO activities which have been
discontinued as a matter of policy since 1971?

NW 65360 Docld:32989588 Page 235

(3) In what way, if any, do the Presidential directives

7 discussed in Parts I and II provide a legal basis
for the FBI's continuing counterintelligence efforts
against hostile foreign intelligence services?

4. Appendix S includes excerpts from the appropriations testimony
of former Director Hoover. The testimony in 1939 and‘1941 makes
reference to President Roosevelt's Proclamation of National
Emergency, September 8, 1939. The following exchange took place
ae atthe hearing on February 19, 1941:

Mr. Ludlow. Af the close of the present emergency, when
peace comes, it would mean that much of this emergency
: work necessarily will be discontinued.
Mr. Hoover. That is correct.
Mr. Tabers. Is your set-up for the national-defense work
separate from the other work?
Mr. Hoover. It is
‘Mx. Taber. Is it operated
Mr. Hoover. Yes. In the field our field officials
“ are under instructions to utilize approximately 50
pexcent of the personnel on national defense work
and the other 50 percent on the regular work.
Mr. Taber. But if some rush comes up, you might have
to vary that?
Mr. Hoover. That is correct.
Mr. Taber. According to the situation. é
" Mr. Hoover. According to the emergency that might arise.
If the national emergency should terminate, the
structure dealing with national defense can immediately
be discontinued or very materially curtailed according
to the wishes of Congress.

When President Roosevelt issued the Proclamation of National
Emergency on September 8, 1939, he accompanied it with Executive
Order No. 8247 directing the Attorney General to “increase the
personnel of the’ Federal Bureau of Investigation, Department of
Justice, in-such number, not exceeding 150, as he shall find
necessary for the proper performance of the additional duties dl
imposed upon the Department of Justice in connection with the oa
national emergency." At a press conference the same day,

President Roosevelt specificalty discussed this Executive
Order and the nature of the "additional duties imposed upon
the Department of Justice."
& 7 {
"And the fourth /Executive Order/ relates to what
‘ you might say is a combination of neutrality’and national
defense. It provides for an addition to the personnel
7 of certain investigating agencies of the Government to
uaan protect this country against--I suppose the easiest way
of putting it is--some of the episodes, some of the i
things that happened over here in 1914 and 1915 and
1916 and the beginning of 1917, before we got into the
“war. There was,.sabotage; there was a great deal of
propaganda by both belligerents, and a good many definite
pians laid in this country by foreign governments to try
to sway American public opinion. We do not have to
specify. . The older men who are here can remember some
of the episodes of that time. It is to guard against
that, and against the spread by any foreign nation of
propaganda in’ this country which would tend to be ~
subversive--I believe that is the word--of our form of
Government." (1939 Roosevelt Papers 485-486)

The following questions arise:

(1) To what extent, if any, were the Presidential
directives of June 26, 1939 and September 6, 1939,
.:, based on the emergency powers of the President?

(2) To what extent, if any, was the establishment of

. the FBI's Intelligence Division in September, 1939,
based on the President's Proclamation of National
Emergency and Executive Order No. 8247?

(3) To what extent, if any, does Congress have the
Constitutional authority to discontinue or curtail
the FBI's national security intelligence activities
.based on the President's emergency powers or on
other Constitutional powers of the Executive Branch?

At approximately 3:20 PM, former SA David E. Todd _
(EOD as SA 1/5/42; retirement 12/9/71) called long distance from
San Francisco and spoke to Deputy Assistant Director Herington.
He said that he had been contacted by Lester B. Seidel, Senate Select
Committee, who said that he would be on the west Boast j in the near
future and desired to interview Todd concerning FBI policies with
regard to investigation of racial matters and our counterintelligence
programs against the Black Panthers and other groups. Todd pointed
out that he was a former supervisor of the San Francisco Office desk
responsible for Black Panther cases. Todd asked what position he
should take. He was advised that his decision as to whether or not to

eA

be interviewed was entirely his and that the Bureau could not make a

any suggestion in this regard. It was pointed out that if he decided to

be interviewed, we had made arrangements with the Senate Select:.
eee which would permit a Bureau representative to be available
‘or consultation with regard to matters that might seem sensitive, but
that the Bureau representative would not be present during or participate
in the actual interview. He was advised further that he had the same
rights as any other citizen, namely, the right to personal counsel and
any other rights guaranteed him under the Constitution. Pursuant to

his request, he was also advised of the provisions of Attorney General
Order 501-73 which appears in Title 28, Code of Federal Regulations,
beginning at Section 16.21, which would‘require appropriate Departmental
approval prior to any current or former employee revealing, pursuant to

: a subpoena or other demand, any information acquired during the course

{ of the employee's official duties. He was also paar me; all Bureau

employees had signed a secrecy agreement. iy

Memo to Mr. J. B. Adams
Re: SENSTUDY 75

Todd indicated that while he desired to respond as legally
required to an official committee inquiry, he would advise Mr. Seidel
that he considered himself bound by the Attorney General Order and did
not feel that he could reveal official information without approval by the
appropriate Department official. Todd was clearly advised that this
decision had to be hiw own and that the FBI could not and would not make
any recommendation to him as to the course of action he should take.

Memorandum

This is to advise that as of 5-7-75 we have received
and ordered to the field a total of 96 requests from the SSC for
investigations of its staff members. An additional case was |
received on 5-8-75 which is being ordered to the field immediately. |
As a result of referenced memo, Inspector Bowers contacted the.
SSC which was in accord with a more realistic deadline on
remaining investigations, except "a few" specials which wo;
still be handled on an expedite basis, such as afforded
Presidential appointments. Of all cases received to date |
only six have been designated as nonexpedite. emcee

It is noted recent articles in the media have contained
eriticism of Congressman Lucien Nedzi for delay in staffing the
HSC and proceeding with its inquiry. On 3-3-75 Inspector Bowers
discussed with the Congressman the mechanics for FBI investi-
gations of the HSC staff. In the intervening period no cases
were received except one ent case from the HSC which has
been ordered to the 10167 concerns Carl Hendrickson Simms,
Security Director, HSC, erly connected with the House
impeachment inquiry. Simms has been in contact with our Project
Senstudy ae group. It is not known when additional investig; tionda
. egeived from the HSC.

sUNTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (HSC)

By agreement, the FRI is currently conducting full fieid
investigations regarding SSC stazf personnel. These have extremely
short (2 week) deadlines which are identical to those afforded
Presidential appointments and are, therefore, given preferential
treatment in opening, assigning, and following field progress, The
Special Inquiry Unit of the Employees Security and Speciel.Incuiry
Section, which has about twice its normal case load, is handling
these requests. Senater Church, Chairman, SSC, originally estimated

that between 35 and 46 staff members would he submitted zor investi-
’ gation. 4s of today, 4-3+75. we hava recsived requesta for 85 such
invedtigaticns from the SSC and the end does not appear to be in
sight. They are xoovived in bunches as many as 6 at a time, which
is not the even flow expected and presents an additiongzl burden,

7 7 In addition it is expected that similar requests will be
forthcoming in the near future from the HSC since we have 2 similar
agyeement with it. Congressman Hedzi, Chairman of the HSC, has
astinated “probably no more than about 25 staff mombers will be
Rived." It remains te be seen if this estimate aise falls short of
actual receipts.

Sinee there is no charge for these full f1eld investigations
they will have to be considered in the budget. It is nosed the
cect charge for a full field investigation, where applicable, is
$2023.

ACTION: Fox information, Since it appears the nucleus of the
Committee has been formed, it is suggested Senator Church be con-
tacted and queried regarding a more realistic (20 day) deadline on-
the remaining investigations concerning future staff membors and”
their replacemants.

Training
Telephone Rm.
Director Soc’y

id The Executive Committee of the Ad Hoc Co-
ordinating Group on Congressional Review of the Intel-
ligence Community identified ten issues likely to grow
out of the Select Committee's deliberations. The
Executive Committee asked the FBI to prepare a paper
on one of these topics, Intelligence Files and Privacy.
Specifically, the request was for a brief paper which
raises the issues observed by the intelligence agencies
when intelligence files and privacy are viewed together
without, suggesting or recommending how the questions
should be resolved.

J. D. Miller drafted an outline which was
discussed on April 16, 1975, with. representatives of the
CIA and Departments of Defense and Treasury. On April 21,
this outline was presented by Mr. Hotis to the Executive
Committee which received it without comment. Mr. Miller
then prepared a rough draft which was discussed at a
meeting on April 22, with the representatives of the CIA
and Department of Treasury. J

Mr. Miller's final draft is attached. It
\ discusses both intelligence files and the concept of
privacy in general terms before focusing on the issues
which present themselves when an effort is made to
establish the proper relationship between the two.

i Following the death last week of Clyde

Tolson, J. Edgar Hoover's close friend and No.

2,man at the FBI, two FBI agents reportedly
1 removed some documents from the late director's
i house in Washington, where Tolson had been liv-
ing. Officially, the FBI denies taking any
such action, and a friend of Tolson's says the
only Hoover documents Tolson had were old can-
eceled checks and tax returns. But Newsweek had
reported earlier that some of Hoover's private
dossiers, including information "very, very
damaging" to persons in the Nixon White House,
were left in Tolson's custody, and a source
told Newsweek this week that the materials were
earted away in a truck.

Assuming that the files ‘in question may be part
of the so-called "Official and Confidential” files, your
testimony before the House Judiciary Committee on February
27, 1975, is instructive. You said that the number of

"domestic extremist activities", and use of the FBI to
gather political intelligence.

Furthermore, at the same time, Director Kelley
suggested that materials from the "Official and Confiden-
tial" files were taken to Director Hoover's home. He
stated:

Immediately after his death /Mr. Hoover's/

some of his employees, including his personal
Ae secretary, went through his files and completed
i the destruction of the remainder of the files
that were purely personal. ‘These were destroyed
by shredding. Some I understand were taken out
to his home and placed in his home, they being
historical I presume to some extent. There is
no indication that they were other than personal
files.

Please determine for the Select Committee whether
‘ any documents were removed from Mr. Tolson's or Mr. Hoover's
‘ residence by FBI agents or former FBI agents after
Mr. Tolson's death. If agents of the FBI did go to
Mr. Hoover's or Mr. Tolson's’ residence to remove files,
please provide the Select Committee with a complete des-
eription of the documents taken into custody by the FBI.
Were any such documents copies or originals of documents
relating to the business of the FBI? If so, please des-—
eribe the subject matter of each such document. Also
indicate the individual within the FBI who has custody
over these files. Furthermore, I respectfully request on
behalf of the Select Committee that such files not be des-
troyed or removed from the FBI's custody until further
_ notice.

\ Jolson, J. Edgar Hoover's close friend and top assis tant, FBI agents

removed documents from the late FBI“ Director's house, in which Mr.
olson had been living. The article further alleges that the docu-
ments removed were of the nature of private dossiers.

7 February 27,'1975, it was asserte that papers delivered te-the home
of 'J. Edgar Hoover after his death were of a purely historical or

diction of the FBI, I respectfully remest that the Department of
Justice make an independent investigation of the alleaa made by
the New weiter and report back to the Subcommittee within a

FORMER ASSOCIATE DIRECTOR

The April 28, 1975, issue of “Newsweek" magazine
on page 15 under its "Periscope" section, referred to Mr.
Tolson's death and claimed that 2 Agents reportedly removed
i documents from Hoover's residence where Tolson had been

living. The article, captioned "Hoover's Secrets," carried
the FBI's denial of such action and also stated that a friend
of Tolson's said the only Hoover documents Tolson had were
old cancelled checks and tax returns. However, the article |
added that "Newsweek" had reported earlier that some of Hoover's
private dossiers, including information "very, very damaging"
to persons in the Nixon White House, were left in Tolson's
custody. "Newsweek" further claimed that a source advised that
the materials were carted away’in a truck.

Mr. Kelley .has asked of Messrs. Callahan, Jenkins,
Adams and Moore, "Do you have any idea where such a story got
started? Ky." =

My memorandum to you of 4/17/75 captioned as above
(copy attached) pointed out that Tony Marro, "Newsweek" reporter,
contacted my office that date advising he had heard from a
source to the effect that 2 Agents were sent to Tolson's residence
‘the day of his death with a truck and carted away some files
which were subsequently brought to the home of Mr. John P.
Mohr, former Assistant to the Director. Upon checking with
Mr. Mohr, Marro was advised there was absolutely no truth
to the story. It should be noted that Mr. Mohr also advised
at that time that most of the furnishings at Mr.-Tolson's
home have been removed over the past several months and that
there were some associates of the family and Annie, the housekeener
who had stopped by the house on the day of the death with
some empty boxes to help remove additional furnishings.

Moore to Jenkins Memo (cont'd.)
Re: CLYDE A. TOLSON

rd Based ‘upon a request from Mr. Mohr to Mr. Callahan,
a Bureau clerk did go to the residence of Mr. Tolson on the day
of his death whereupon he delivered some 24 boxes and 6 rolls
of tape. The clerk merely delivered the boxes and tape and
then left the residence. We have no idea what was placed ino
the boxes nor how this story started in the first place.

By memorandum dated 4-30 a7 5, directed to the Director Soc'y —

Deputy Attorney General and the Director of the FBI, signed by’ Chief

Counsel of the Senate Select Committee (SSC) Frederick A. O. Schwarz,

dr. , the SSC had made additional requests of the FBI. Their requests are

divided into four separate areas which, are as follows: (1) Request for

prior changes in the Manual of Instructions, to those sections of the

Manual of Instructions which they have already had access to. (2) Request

to review certain sections.of the Manual of Instructions not previously

furnished the Committee. A review of this list discloses generally

ee sections do not pertain to foreigw or domestic intelligence investigations

and some do not appear to be within the ambit of Senate Resolution 21 which

charters the authority’ of the SSC. Regarding the sections of the Manual ‘

of Instructions, the request stated they would be satisfied with reviewing

them at FBI Headquarters. (3) Request certain sections.of the Manual

of Rules and Regulations be made available for review by SSC representatives :
ters. As in request #2, some of the sections do not ;

appear to be within the scope of Senate Resolution 21. Among the sections

of the Manual of Rules and Regulations requested are. such sections as those

concerning disciplinary matters and administration of offices. (4) A

general request est conerning the Bureau's filing procedures including

information Concerning our indexing system, list of classifications used

in FBI filing system, and a set of cc used by the Bureau. (Attached \5%

Legal Counsel to Adams Memorandum
RE: SENSTUDY 75

be technically accurate the Committee felt it was necessary for them

to come to a general understanding as to Bureau operations and that

this would assist them in their review of FBI operations in the domestic
and foreign intelligence areas. Gitenstein also indicated it was the
Committee's feeling that Senate Resolution 21 was intended to be construed
liberally and that in general it required that the SSC be furnished by

the various intelligence agencies that information which would be necessary
_ for them to carry out its mandate. It was also explained to Gitenstein

H that concerning their requests involving prior changes in various sections
of the Manual of Instructions that they had not placed a cutoff date as

to how far back the Bureau had to go to comply with this request. Gitenstein
indicated that we could use 1-1-60 as the cutoff date.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

(1) Recipients review requests pertaining to their Divisions
and furnish in memorandum form their response to the Legal Counsel
Division.

(2) The Legal Counsel Division will, upon receipt of
responses from the interested Divisions, prepare the necessary communication
to the Senate Select Committee to be approved by the Attorney General and
furnished to the Committee.

| GENERAL TYLER AND DIRECTOR KELLY’

April 30, 1975

i - This memorandum concerns paragraph IV of the attachment
to, Senator Church's letter of March 19 to the Attorney General.

on behalf of the Senate Select Committee to Study Governmental
oyerations with Respect to Intelligence Activities, I would like to
request the following: \

: 1. ‘Superseded Sections of the Mantial of Instructions.

Cértain sections of the Manual currently in effect have been produced
+6 us. We had intended by the request to ask for the relevant super-
séded sections (note the absence of the word "current" in Section IV
ad compared to Section IIIA) and we did indicate previously to the
liaison staff that we were interested in superseded sections. But
without regard to that, it is clear from documents such as the
Director's letter of August 7, 1973 to the Attorney General that

certain superseded sections will be highly relevant in analyzing

the question of legal authority, as well as in understanding particu-

ihr events in earlier years. We would appreciate their being sent

( " :

my promptly review them at the FBI in order to select particular

RE: H. R. 214

Congresswoman Bella Abzug (D-N,Y.), had indicated an interest in
holding hearings onthis matter. Whitley stated hopefully Abzug's

- Subcommittee can be precluded from conducting any hearings in this
area by virtue of the assertion of authority by the Post Office and Civil
Service Committee.

James Wentzel, Office of Legislative Affairs, Department
of Justice, has been alerted to the effect that an invitation will be received
by the Department for testimony on this legislation,

RECOMMENDATION:

That the General and Special Investigative Divisions and ~
the Intelligence Division promptly begin compiling appropriate information
for submission to the Legal Counsel Division which can be submitted to

the Department for its use in testifying or can be used as the basis for
FBI testimony should the Department request an FBI representative to appear
