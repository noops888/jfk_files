TOPSECRE I DINAR: NOFORN XRAY HANDLING REQUIRED

CRITICAL APPRAISAL OF PRESIDENT JOHNSON

FOR SIOGRAPHICAL DATA ON PRES. JOHNSON, PLEASE CONSULI YOUR

CONGRESSIONAL DIRECTORY. MATERIAL HERE CONCERNED PRIMARILY WITH

HIS OUTLOOK AND PROBABLE POLICIES.

TEMPERAMENT. PRES. JOHNSON HAS BEEN DESCRIBED VARIOUSLY AS

VIGOROUSLY POWER-SEEKING, EGOTISTIC, HARD DRIVING, AMBITIOUS, RUTH-

LESS AND A WHOLLY POLITICAL ANIMAL. ALL THESE DESCRIPTIONS ARE IN

SOME DEGREE TRUÉ. HE IS ABOVE ALL CONCERNED WITH THE MECHANICS

OF POLITICS. HE WAS ONE OF THE 2 OP 3 BEST MAJORITY LEADERS IN

THE HISTORY OF THE SENATE. HE EXPECTS RESULTS AND IS NOT SYM. -

PATHETIC TO THOSE WHO CANNOT PRODUCE QUICKLY AND EFFICIENTLY.

WHILE HE IS A MASTER OF DOMESTIC POLITICS; HE IS NOT EQUALLY

CONVERSANT WITH FOREIGN AFFAIRS--EXCEPT FOR WHAT HE MAS ABSORBED

THROUGH CONSIDERATION OF LEGISLATION AND IN GOODWILL VISITS

ABROAD.

POLICIES. PRES. JOHNSON IS INE FIRST PRESIDENT FROM THE

SOUTH SINCE THE AMBRICAN CIVIL WAR. HE

IS MORE BASICALLY CON-

SERVATIVE THAN PRES. KENNEDY, BUT NOI SUBSTANIIALLY SO. HE IS

CONSIDERED TOO "LIBERAL" BY OTHER SOUTHERNERS. HE WILL PRODABLY

PRODUCE NO MAJOR CHANGES IN DOMESTIC POLICIES. IN FOREIGN POLICY

HE MAY PROVE MORE IMPATIENT THAN PRES. KENNEDY BUT HIS BASIC

POLICIES WILL NOT SUSSTANTIALLY DIFFER. ME CAN BE EXPECIED TO

SUPPORT THE KENNEDY ROUND, ALTHOUGH A DEFINITELY "HARD" LINE

CAN BE ANTICIPATED... HE KNOWS NO NEGOTIATION BUT HARD AND VIGO-

ROUS NEGOTIATION. SIMILARLY, HE CAN BE EXPECTED TO SUPPORT THI

COMMUNITY AND IIS FURTHER CONSOLIDATION, ALTHOUGH HE STILL NEEDS

A GREAT DEAL OF EDUCATION REGARDING ATLANTIC AFFAIRS. HE HAS

BEEN RECEPTIVE IN GENERAL TO FORMATION OF A FEDERAL EUROPE AND

THE ATLANTIC PARINERSHIP CONCEYI. HE CAN BE EXPECTED TO TAKE A

FORCEFUL POSITION AGAINST THOSE IN EUROPE WHO OPPOSE PARTNERSKIP

AND CLOSE ALLIANCE WITH HE U.S.

AS A GUIDELINE, IT SHOULD BE REMEMBERED THAT PRES. JOHNSON

WILL WITHOUT FAIL. SEE MAJOR ISSUES IN BASIC POLITICAL TERMS.

IN SUMMARY THE FOLLOWING MIGHT BE EXPECTED IN A JOHNSON

FOREIGN POLICY: 1) SUPPORT OF ATLANTIC PARTNERSHIP AND STRONG

OPPOSITION TO: ALL THOSE WHO OPPOSE IT. 2) LESS WILLINGNESS TO

NEGOTIATE WITH THE SOVIETS.

3) CONTINUED PRESENCE IN EUROPE OF

SUSSTANTIAL U•S MILITARY STRENGIH. 4) ADDED ATTENTION IO AND

EMPHASIS ON LATIN AMERICA CA LONG-TIME AREA OF PERSONAL IN -

TEREST). 5) SUPPORI OF KENNEDY ROUND, BUT A HARD AMERICAN POSI-

TION WITHIN IT. 6) INCREASED PRESSURE ON ALLIES RE NATO DEFENSE

CONTRIBUTION, AID AND TRADE.

PERSONNEL, PRESS JOHNSON IS A MAN OF AND FROM THE CONGRESS.

HE ISTHE CHOSEN PROTEGE OF THE LATEHOUSE SPEAKER SAM RAYDURN.

HE CAN BE EXPECTED TO DRAW FROM CONGRESS STAFF MEMBERS AND FRIENDS

FILL HIS ADMINISTRATION. MANY OF THESE WILL PROBABLY DE ((XM>>

MOGEORGE BUNDY, ARTHUR SCHLESINGER, TED SORENSON, PIERRE SALINGER.

CABINET MEMBERS MOST IN DANGER OF THEIR JOBS ARE MACNAMARA, DILLON,

RUSK--FIRSI TWO BECAUSE OF THEIR REPUBLICAN PARTY MEMBERSHIP•

FROM THE MOMENT HE ENTERS THE WHITE HOUSE, PRES: JOHNSON WILL

BECONCERNED PRIMARILY WITH HIS 1964 NOMINATION AND ELECTION: BE-

CAUSE OF THIS, HE CAN BE EXPECTED TO FOLLOW A GENERALLY MORE CON-

SERVATIVE LINE THAN IF HE FACED A FULL FOUR YEAR TERM. UNLIKE

PRES. KENNEDY HE CANNÖT COUNT ON FULL SUPPORT FROM ALL NORTHERN

INDUSTRIAL STATES. HE MUST THUS ATTEMPT TO HOLD THE SOUTH FOR THE

DEMOCRATIC PARTY WHILE AT THE SAME TIME NOT ALIENATING THE IN-

DUSTRIAL NORTH:

NOTE: THIS GREATLY AIDS ROCKEFELLER'S CHANCES FOR REPUBLICAN I.

NOMSNATION AND LESSENS GOLDWATER'S WHO CAN NO LONGER SHOOT AT

"LEFTIST" TARGEI.

ABOVE ALL, THE REPUBLICAN MOST STRENGIHENED

IS RICHARD NIXON WHO UNDOUBTEDLY WILL SEEK NOMINATION AGAIN.

SUMMARY• JOHNSON HAS POTENTIAL TO BE A GREAI PRESIDENT. HE

WILL NOT BE AFRAID TO USE THE FULL POWERS OF HIS OFFICE, IF ABLE

TO CONSOLIDATE HIS POSITION IN THE NEXT FEW MONTHS. HE WILL PROBABLY

BE FAR MORE SUCCESSFUL WITH CONGRESS THAN PRESIDENT KENNEDY, AS HE

IS WILLING TO USE ALL--REPEAT ALL--MEANS AT HAND IN GAINING OBJEC-

TIVES.

PRES. JOHNSON WAS SOUGHT AND PREPARED FOR THE PRESIDENCY

ALL HIS LIFE. IT IS NOW IN HIS GRASP AND HE WILL NOT LET THE

OPPORTUNLTY PASS•

ONE WARNING: IT IS PROBABLE THAI STAFF MEMBERS MAY BE CHOSEN

LESS FOR THEIR SENSITIVITY TO DIPLOMACY AND INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS

THAN FOR THEIR LOYALTY, BRUTE EFFICIENCY AND DRIVE. WE WILL SEND

NEXT WEEK FULLER AND MORE CAREFUL ANALYSIS OF PROSPECTS FOR

JOHNSON ADMINISTRATION, INCLUDING VOTING RECORD AND POSITIONS ON

ALL MAJOR LEGISLATION AND ISSUES•

REGARDS•

CONFIRM EARLIER CONVERSATION THAT BOBBY BAKER SCANDAL UNLIKELY

TO TOUCH PRES. JOHNSON IN VIEW OF HIS POSITION AND EARLIER SENATE

ATTEMPTS TO PLAY IT DOWN.

REPRESENTATIVE MCCORMICK IS NOW NEXT-IN-LINE TO THE PRESIDENCY

BUT HE WILL NOT ACQUIRE ANY POWERS IN ADDITION TO THOSE HE ALREADY

HAS--VERY LITTLE IN FOREIGN AFFAIRS.
