CONGRESSIONAL DIRECTORY. MATERIAL HERE CONCERNED PRIMARILY WITH
HIS CUTLOOK AND PROBABLE. POLICIES, :

TEMPERAMENT. ‘PRES’ JOHNSON HAS BEEN DESCRIBED VARIOUSLY aS
VIGOROUSLY POWER-SEEKING,.EGOTISTIC, HARD DRIVING, AMBITIOUS, RUTH-  .
LESS AND A. WHOLLY POLITICAL ANIMAL. ALL THESE DESCRIPTIONS ARE IN

“SOME DEGREE TRUE. HE 1S ABOVE ALL CONCERNED WITH THE MECHANICS

OF POLITICS. HE WAS ONE OF THE 2 OR 3 BEST MAJORITY LEADERS IN

| THE HISTORY OF THE SENATE. HE EXPECTS RESULTS AND IS NOT SYH- ~~
PATHETIC TO THOSE WHO CANNOT PRODUCE QUICKLY AND. EFFICIENTLY.
WHILE HE IS A. MASTER OF DOMESTIC. POLITICS, HE IS NOT EQUALLY
CONVERSANT WITH FOREIGN AFF ALRS--EXCEPT FOR WHAT HE HAS ABSORBED

THROUGH CONSIDERATION OF LEGISLATION AND IN GOODWILL VISITS

POLICIES. PRESé JOHNSON IS THE FIRST PRESIDENT. FROM THE \
— SINCE THE AMERICAN CIVIL WaR. HE IS MORE BASICALLY CON- .

SERVATIVE THAN PRES. KE DY, BUT NOT SUBSTANTIALLY SO. HE Is
CONSIDERED TOO “LIBERAL” BY OTHER SOUTHERNERS. HE WILL PROBABLY
PRODUCE NO MAJOR CHANGES IN DOMESTIC-POLICIES. IN FOREIGN POLICY
HE MAY PROVE MORE. INPATIENT THAN, PRES. KENNEDY. BUT HIS: BASIC
POLICIES WILL NOT SUBSTANTIALLY DIFFER. HE CAN BE EXPECTED TO
SUPPORT THE KENNEDY ROUND, ALTHOUGH A DEFINITELY "HARD" LINE
CAN BE ANTICIPATED: HE KNOWS NO NEGOTIATION BUT HARD aND ViIGo-
ROUS NEGOTIATION» SIMILARLY, HE CAN BE EXPECTED TO SUPPORT THE
COMMUNITY AND ITS FURTHER CONSOLIDATION, ALTHOUGH HE STILL NEEDS
A GREAT DEAL OF EDUCATION REGARDING ATLANTIC AFFAIRS. HE Has
BEEN RECEPTIVE IN GENERAL TO FORMATION OF A FEDERAL EUROPE AND
THE ATLANTIC PARTNERSHIP CONCEYT. HE CAN BE EXPECTED TO TAKE A
FORCEFUL POSITION AGAINST .THOSE IN EUROPE WHO OPPOSE PARTNERSHIP
AND CLOSE ALLIANCE With THE UeS. :

AS & GUIDELINE, IT SHOULD BE REMEMBERED THAT PRES. JOHNSON
WILL WITHOUT FAIL. SEE MAJOR ISSUES IN BASIC POLITICAL TERMS.

IN SUMMARY THE FOLLOWING MIGHT BE.EXPECTED IN A JOHNSON
FOREIGN POLICY: 1) SUPPORT OF ATLANTIC PARTNERSHIP AND STRONG
OPPOSITION TO-ALL. THOSE WHO OPPOSE IT. 2) LESS WILLINGNESS TO
NEGOTIATE WITH THE SOVIETS. 5) CONTINUED PRESENCE IN EUROPE OF \
SUBSTANTIAL U.S. WILITARY STRENGTH, 4) ADDED ATTENTION TO aND
EMPHASIS ON LATIN-AMERICA (A LONG-TINE AREA OF PERSONAL IN-
TEREST). 5) SUPPORT OF KENNEDY ROUND, SUT A HARD AMERICAN post-

Ve WITHIN IT, 6) INCREASED PRESSURE ON ALLIES RE NATO DEFENSE \
CONTRIBUTION, AID AND. TRADE.

CAUSE OF THIS, HE CAN SE.EXPECTED TO FOLLOW A GENERALLY MORE CON~
SERVATIVE LINE THAN IF HE FACED A FULL FOUR YEAR TERM. UNLIKE

INDUSTRIAL STATES. HE-MUST. THUS ATTEMPT TO HOLD THE SOUTH FOR THE
DEMOCRATIC PARTY WHILE AT THE SANE TIME NOT ALIENATING THE IN-
DUSTRIAL NORTH, ,

NOTE: THIS GREATLY AIDS ROCKEFELLER'S CHANCES FOR REPUBLICAN
NOWSNATION AND LESSENS GOLDWATER'S WHO CAN NO LONGER SHOOT “aT
“LEFTIST” TARGET. ABOVE ALL, THE REPUBLICAN MOST: STRENGTHENED

TIVES. PRES. JOHNSON was SOUGHT AND PREPARED FOR THE PRESIDENCY

HIS LIFE. IT Is how in HIS GRASP AND HE WILL NOT LET THE a
