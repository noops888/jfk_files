DECLASSIFICATION AND/OR

RELEASE OF THIS DOCUMENT

the 23-year old Ray was granted a scholarship by the Cuban

Ministry of Public Works to study civil engineering at the

University of Utah.

Ray was in the United States for two

years before returning to his native Cuba in 1949 and

obtaining various positions in the engineering field, one of

which was project manager for the construction of the

3

Havana Hilton Hotel.

Reacting to the excesses of the military rule of

Fulgencio Batista, Ray organized the Civic Resistance Movement

in 1957. and began supervising sabotage and acts of terrorism

4

against the government.

His political posture and active

resistance to Batista was recognized by Fidel Castro who,

upon assuming control of the government of Cuba, apprinted

Ray his Minister of Public Works in February 1959.

Within a

few months of his appointment, Ray confided to two alti-Castro

Cubans that he had recognized the symptoms of Communism in

the Castro regime but was not prepared to conspire against

"El Lider Maximo."

6

Ray's tenure in Castro's government was short-lived. He

7

was

relieved of his official position in November 1939.

definite reasofrood Athcoatrekededoeunshas been documented but,

according to one source, Ray did not leave Castro because 'of

ideological or policy discrepancies but rather because of a

personality clash with Castro's Minister of Labor who almost

shot Ray after a stormy Cabinet meeting." Another theory

about his leaving was that he opposed Castro's plan to declare

Hubert Matos

a traitor and execute the Cuban revolutionary

hero with whom Ray had been associated.?

For whatever reason, Ray did continue to permit his name

to be associated with the Castro regime until May 1960

when he formed the Revolutionary Movement of the People (MRP)?

The MRP wassanti-Castro organization which believed that

the ideas and aims of the democratic left best suited the

needs and aspirations of the Cuban people. 12 It did not wish

to reinstate the 1940 Cuban Constitution, rather it favored

continuation of the laws passed by Castro at the beginning of

his regime! and advocated the regulation of private investment

and nationalization of all utilities. 14 Associated with Ray

in this underground organization were Raul Chibas, Ramon

Barguin, Rogelio Cisneros, 15 Rufo Lopez Fresquet and Felipe

Pazos. 16

Organized in each of Cuba's six provinces, the MRP

was

considered the most important underground group. 17 Working

in tightiy organized cells, the leadership in one province

was unaware of the identities of their counterparts in other

and was supplied with explosives sent by launches from the

19

Florida Keys.

Having waited until May, 1960 to organize his resistance

group, Ray was criticized as being suspiciously tardy to the

anti-Castro movnement. 20

Charges of "Fidelism without Fidel"

were made against him and the MRP because of their leftist

ideologies. 21 Perhaps for these reasons, Ray's background

was questioned by some in the State Department22 and the Miami

CIA station?3 when, in the summer of 1960, he was being re-

cruited by the CIA in Cuba to become a member of the Frente

Rēvolucionario Democratico (FRD), a newly formed anti-Castro

organization sponsored by the CIA.24 The Agency considered him

an important political asset25

and facilitated his clandestine

entrance into the United States

1§26 on November 10, 1960.27

Nevertheless, there was internal conflict within the

CIA about Ray's political compatibility to United States

government policy. In a CIA Memo for Record, dated November 21,

1960, one Agency officer declared, "

... Ray did not politically

represent anything to cheer about "o A CIA officer who met

privately with Ray in November, 1960 noted that his political

posture was "doubtful" as far as U. S. government acceptance

was concerned,

and a further assessment portrayed Ray as so

far "left in his thinking that he would be as dangerous to

U. S. interests as Castr030

Some prontione (tA Cubatrollemigenta.] so expressed negative

opinions about Ray, among them DI. Jose Miro Cardona, president

of the FRD. Miro opposed Ray because he considered his

program too Marxist31 and declared that Ray was bitterly

anti-American as well as probably totalitarian in his think-

ing. 32

Manuel Artime, head of the Movimento Recuperacion

Revolucionaria (MRR), noted that Ray's group was opposed to

banning the Communist Party and in favor of "nationalizing

everything. "33 Although aware of his controversial political

philosophy, the CIA continued to actively recruit Ray to join

the FRD34 because the White House and State Department pushed

for his inclusion. 35

Ray received full operational approval as a "political

asset" on February 7, 196136 but resisted joining the newly

formed Cuban Revolutionary Council (CRC) just as he had

resisted inclusion

into the FRD. He said he felt the members

of the CRC were too restrained and he did not want to become

a part of a situation in which someone else was running the

show for the exiles. 37 However Three weeks before the Bay of

Pigs invasion,

*ray was persuaded to join the CRC as a show of

unity. 38

In recalling the events of this period, Ray told HSCA

investigators that he was aware of the fact that certain in-

fluential and wealthy Americans, among then former Ambassador

William Pawley, were opposed to him and that a lot of heavy

propaganda wasClassificatianated aeeusing him of being a

Ray withdrew from the CRC shortly after the Bay of Pigs

invasion. In a Miami news conference on May 28, 1961, he said

the major reason for the MRP break with the CRC was that the

Council had failed to live up to the written promises given

it in March, outlining conditions Ray had insisted upon before

joining the organization. 40 The first condition had been that

the Council was to give first priority to the underground

fighters in Cuba during the Bay of Pigs invasion. Secondly,

Ray had insisted that anyone too closely associated with the

Batista regime would not be used in the invasion. Also, he

said, he was to have been allowed prior approval of any appoint-

ment of invasion military leaders. 41 Ray told the assembled

newsmen that his

program to overthrow Castro was based on

maximum mobilization of the discontented people inside Cuba,

and

that he thought the leadership of this underground should

come from Cubans who could prove they had access to such a

42

potential force.

Ray sought CIA support for the MRP independent of the

Council, 43 claiming that the group had an effective underground

organization but needed material and financial support. 44 Ray

felt the MRP.had to be allowed to plan its own operations and

broaden its base of financial support to include sympathetic

Latin American governments. 45 He was totally opposed to another

large invasion lassification:

initial $50,000 for operational expenses. 47 Reaction at

CIA headquarters was immediate: Within 24 hours a Memo for

the Record was circulated, objecting to the Miami Station's

recommendation and claiming that Ray did not ever produce any

substantial military actions against Castro. 48 Ray was told

to submit a "prospectus" of his plans for the MRP and advised

that no financial help would be forthcoming until such a plan

was reviewed. 49

Ray went to Puerto Rico about July, 1961, where he

received sympathetic support for the MRP from the Governor

of that island, Luis Munoz Marin, who personally liked Ray 50

While Ray was

in Puerto Rico, a member of the MRP underground

in Cuba reported to the MRP Executive Council that he had been

in contact with the CIA and was told by the Agency that no

material resources would be available for the group until

Manuel Ray was dismissed as general coordinator.5l Charging

the CIA with repeated interference in the affairs of the MRP,

Ray

resigned so that there wouldn't be any obstacle to the

group's cohesion. 52

In October, 1961, the Puerto Rican Planning Board an-

nounced that Ray had accepted a $12,000-a-year position as

consultant to that Board. 53

Although there was no evidence

that the Puerto Rican government was supporting the MRP, Ray

was looked upon with great favor by Puerto Rican officials 54

and he endeavorlassificationd the MiP wIth cuban exiles residing

Although treninsA atedralledaotmentsational leadership of the

MRP in April, 1962,56 Ray began formulating plans for a new

anti-Castro organization, Junta Revolucionario Cubana (JURE) 57

which, he

said, would be only political in nature.

58 Ray

freely admitted that this group, organized in July, 1962

would cooperate with the CRC but ultimately hoped to dominate

it. 60

Concurrent with his JURE activities. Ray began giving

information to the CIA regarding possible recruitment or

61

defection of Castro officials.

Specifically, he discussed

plans with the CIA

to approach the Cuban Ambassador to

Mexico. 62

The CIA, deciding he had such capabilities,

recommended he be given $84,000 over a six-month period to

set up an intelligence network inside Cuba and create a

recruitment or defection capability in selected Latin American

countries.

63 The degree of Ray's success in this area is

not documented, but his efforts continued into the summer of

1963 and involved recruitment activities in France and

Belgium.

The Chief of Station in Paris was so impressed

by Ray's abilities that he recommended he be used more

extensively in this capacity.

65

In June, 1963, the CIA inaugurated the concept of

"Autonomous Operations", under which JURE could be financed

independently, not through the CRC.

Military operations

were also initiated" with Rogelio Cisneros as JURE military

coordinator. Classification:

Under his interpretation of the "Rules of Engagement of

the Autonomous Operations"

, Cisneros felt that JURE was not

obligated to report its military or political plans to the

CIA but that the Agency was obligated to finance JURE's

purchase of military equipment. 69

By the fall of 1963, Ray was devoting his full time to

JURE, 70 traveling extensively in Latin American countries to

gain support which would allow JURE to mount resistance

operations inside Cuba?! Ray told this Committee that he

and Cisneros were in Caracas for this purpose on November 22,

1963. He remembers that the assistant to the President of

Venezuela came into the JURE meeting shortly after lunch that

day and announced that President Kennedy had been shot. 72

In January, 1964, Ray's organization was making plans

•to move their operations to Costa Ricals and, at the same time,

establish a guerrilla training base in Venezuela.

74 He also

began to formulate plans for his own infiltration into Cuba?5

declaring that he would turn the operation of JURE over to

Rogelio Cisneros during his absence. 76

77

His in-

filtration plans were known throughout the Miami Cuban exile

community.

Soon the story spread to Cuba where Castro ordered

a full-scale military alert and rounded up scores of suspected

79

Ray supporters.

After several days of bad weather and dodging Cuban patrol

boats, Ray and his crew of seven,.

8°including a reporter-

photographer team from LIFE magazine 81 landed at the

Anguilla Cays, 40 miles off the Cuban coast. 82

There Ray

intended to make a final equipment check and a final radio

transmission. 83

Because of their proximity to Cuba, the Anguilla Cays

were heavily patrolled by Castro forces and by the British who

owned them.

The British discovered Ray and his group and

their cache of weapons and explosives, arrested them for illegal

entry into the Bahamas and

took them to Nassau.

85 The minimal

fine of $14 was levied on

each

member of the group and each

was admonished to never tresspass again.

Upon his release, Ray said that he was as determined as

ever to infiltrate Cuba: "Fidel knows me," he said, "and he

knows I'm coming!" 87

and U.S. Treasury that Rogelio Cisneros had illegally purchased

$50,000 worth of arms for JURE from a California arms manu-

facturer.

It also caused the CIA considerable embarrassment.

The Agency denied knowledge of the purchase to Revenue

officials and, because of the autonomous nature of its relation-

ship with. JURE, did not make any attempt to stop Revenue's

investigation. 82" The Agency now, however, told Ray that he

83%'

would have to move all his operations outside U.S. territory.

In order to shore up his waning credibility within the

Cuban exile community, Ray again tried to infiltrate Cuba in

July, 1964 but, again, his boat developed motor trouble and

the plan was aborted.

The failure this time led three

exile groups to withdraw from JURE.

All these events, from May through July, resulted in a

CIA decision to stop financing Ray until he ceased all

activities from the U.S. mainland.
