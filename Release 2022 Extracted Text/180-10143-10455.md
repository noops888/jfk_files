Some pronfianeftA-Cubetrpllechdquentalso expressed negative

opinions about Ray, among them Dr. Jose Miro Cardona, president
of the FRD. Miro opposed Ray because he considered his
program too Marxist31 and declared that Ray was bitterly
anti-American as well as probably totalitarian in his think-
ing.32 Manuel Artime, head of the Movimento Recuperacion
Revolucionaria (MRR), noted that Ray's group was opposed to
banning the Communist Party and in favor of "nationalizing
everything. "33 Although aware of his controversial political
philosophy, the CIA continued to actively recruit Ray to join
the FRD34 because the White House and State Department pushed
for his inclusion.35

Ray received full operational approval as a "political
asset" on February 7, 196136 but resisted joining the newly
formed Cuban Revolutionary Council (CRC) just as he had

resisted inclusion into the FRD. He said he felt the members

Ray withdrew from the CRC shortly after the Bay of Pigs

invasion. In a Miami news conference on May 28, 1961, he said

the major reason for the MRP break with the CRC was that the
Council had failed to live up to the written promises given

it in March, outlining conditions Ray had insisted upon before
joining the organization. 4° The first condition had been that
the Council was to give first priority to the underground
fighters in Cuba during the Bay of Pigs invasion. Secondly,
Ray had insisted that anyone too closely associated with the
Batista regime would not be used in the invasion. Also, he

said, he was to have been allowed prior approval of any appoint-

ment of invasion military leaders. 41 Ray told the assembled

newsmen that his program to overthrow Castro was based on

maximum mobilization of the discontented people inside Cuba,
and that he thought the leadership of this underground should

come, from Cubans ‘who could prove they had access to such a
42

potential force.

Ray sought CIA support for the MRP independent of the

44

organization but needed material and financial support. Ray

felt the MRP.had to be allowed to plan its own operations and

broaden its base of financial support to include sympathetic

Latin American governments. 45

Ray went to Puerto Rico about July, 1961, where he
received sympathetic support for the MRP from the Governor
of that island, Luis Munoz Marin, who personally liked Ray .99
While Ray was in Puerto Rico, a member of the MRP underground
in Cuba reported to the MRP Executive Council that he had been
in contact with the CIA and was told by the Agency that no
meterial resources would be available for the group until
Manuel Ray was dismissed as general coordinator .51 Charging
the CIA with repeated interference in the affairs of the MRP,
Ray resigned so that there wouldn't be any obstacle to the
group's cohesion. 52

In October, 1961, the Puerto Rican Planning Board an-
nounced that Ray had accepted a $12,000-a-year position as
