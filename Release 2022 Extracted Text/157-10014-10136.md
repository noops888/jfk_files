PROLOGUE
The events discussed in this Interim Report must be viewed in
the context of United States policy and actions designed to counter
the threat of spreading Communism.} Following the end of World
War II, many nations in eastern Eutope and elsewhere fell under
Communist influence or control. The defeat of the Axis powers was
accompanied by the rapid disintegration of the Western colonial
empires. The Second World War no gooner ended than a new struggle
began... The Communist threat, emanating, from what was then called
the "Sino-Soviet bloc," produced a policy of containment intended
to prevent further encroachment by | Communism into the "free world."
United States strategy for conducting the Cold War called for
the establishment of interlocking treaty arrangements and military
bases throughout the world. Our concern over the expansion of an
aggressive Communist monolith led the United States to fight two
major wars in Asia. In addition, it was considered necessary to
" wage A relentless cold war. against | Communist expansion wherever
it appeared in the "back alleys of the world.'"' This called for a
full range of clandestine Ae in response to the operations

i
7 A }
of Communist clandestine services...

it i
The fear-of expanding Communism was particularly acute when
i
Fidel Castro emerged as the leader! of Cuba in the late 1950's.
n i
His takeover was seen as the first) significant penetration by the

Communists into the Western Hemisphere. U.S. leaders, including

most Members of Congress, called for vigorous action to stem the
Communist infection in this hemisphere. These policies rested on-
widespread popular support and encouragement. :

Throughout this period, the ujs. felt impelled to respond to
threats which were, or seemed to be, skirmishes in a global. Cold
War against Communism. Castro's Cuba raised the spectre of a Soviet
outpost at America's. doorstep. Events in the Dominican Republic
appeared to offer more such opportunities for the Russians and their
allies. The Congo, freed from Belgian rule, occupied the strategic
center of the African continent, and the prospect of Communist pene-
tration there was viewed as a thredt to American interests in emerging,

Africa: Americans are well aware ‘pf the powerful reactions set off

in the United States in the 1960's by the domino theory in Indochina.
And, even the élection in 1970 ofa Marxist president -in Chile was

efi
seen by some as a threat similar to, that of Castro's takeover in Cuba.
i

The Committee regards the wnfireunace events dealt with in this
Interim Report as an aberration, explainable at least in part, but
not justified, by the Drescuce of sents at the time. The Committee

- believes that it is still in the national interest of the United
States ‘to do what it can to help nhtions resist Communist domination,
but it is clear that. this cannot justify in the future the kind of

i
abuses covered in this report. Indeed, the Committee has resolved

that steps must be taken to prevent them from, happening again.

In depth treatment of the assassination question has lengthened
the Committee's schedule but has greatly increased the Comaittee's awareness

of the hard issues it must face in the|.months ahead. The Conmittee intends,

nevertheless, to complete, by February, 1976, its main job of undertaking the

t
first comprehensive review of the intelligeace community.

Under Senate Resolution 21, ithe Committee was instructed to in-

vestigate the full range of governtiental intelligence activities and the

extent, if any, to which such activities were “illegal, improper or un-
Hl -

ethical". In addition to that very broad general mandate, the Committee

was required by the Senate to investigate, study and make recommendations

concerning, various specific matters, several of which relate to the assassi-

nation issue.

Although the Rockefeller Commission conducted an inquiry into

reported assassination plots, the Commission declared it wa

a variety of reasons, to complete its}inquiry. At the direction. of the Presi-

is report raises important questions of national policy. We

lieve that the public is entitled to] know what certain instrumentalities

f8f their Government have done. Further, our recommendations can only be

ae

‘judged in light of the factual record} Therefore, this interim report

should be made public.

Because of our faith in the democratic system, and the paraniount

importance of strengthening the institutions of this country, the Committee
y !

believes the truth about the assassination allegations should be told.
5

i
Democracy depends upon a well-informed electorate. Truth underlies both

justice and freedom.

We reject any contention that the facts disclosed herein should be

kept secret because they are embarrassing to the United States. Despite
the possible injury to our national reputation, the Comittee believes. that
foreign peoples will, upon sober refléction, respect the United States nore
for keeping faith with its denocratic [ideal than they will condenn us for
the misconduct itself.

The fact that portions of the Story have already been publicly dis-
closed only accentuates the need, for full disclosure.’ Innuendo and mis-
leading partial disclosures are neither fair to the individuals involved,
nor a responsible way to lay the grouidwork for informed public policy

Hany of the events under consideration occurred as
long as fifteen years ago. With one exception, they
occurred during the administrations of Presidents now dead.
Other high officials, whose testimony might have
additional light upon the thorny issues of authorization
and control, are also dead. toreover, with the passage

4 of time, the memories of those still alive have dimmed.
The Committee often faced the difficult task of dis-

tinguishing refreshed recollection from speculation. In

i
many instances, witnesses were unable to testify from in-
i -

dependent recollection ané had to rely on documents con~

temporaneous with the ‘events to refresh their recollections.

While informed speculation is of some assistance, it can
|

only be assigned limited weight in judging specific events.

Assassination is|not a subject on which one would

relating to that investigation was destroyed upon’ its

completion.*

A final deficiency in the evidence stems From the

doctrine that CIA covett operations should be concealed

from the world and performed in such a way that if they
were discovered, the role of the United States could be
plausibly denied. As an extension of this doctrine of
“plausible deniability"- communications between the Agency

and high Administration officials were often convoluted

and imprecise.** : 7
The evidence contains sharp. conflicts, Sone of which relate to
basic facts; but the most important conflicts relate not so much to basic
facts as to differing perceptions and: opinions based upon relatively. undis-
iz
puted facts. 1;

With respect to both kinds of conflicts, the Conmittee has

‘tensively so that it may speak for

attempted to set forth the evidence e
itself. In the findings and conclusions section, we suggest resolutions
of some of the conflicts. Remembering that the Committee's main job is
to find lessons for -the future; there are also occasions’ where ve point
out that resolving conflicts in the evidence may be less important than

making certain that the system which produced the acbiguities is corrected.

* This “Was done pursuant to the instructions of CIA Director Richard
Helms (Helms Ex.__; 6/13/75 Tr.__). In fairness.to Director Helms it
should be added, however, that he was responsible for requesting the
preparation of the I.G. Reports and for preserving them.

D. Summary of Findings and Conclusions

1. The Questions Presented
The Committee sought to answer four broad questions:
ASSASSINATION PLOTS. Did U.S. officials instigate,
attempt, aid and abet, or acquiesce in plots designed to
assassinate foreign leaders?

INVOLVEMENT IN OTHER KILLINGS. Did U.S. officials

1
assist foreign dissidents an a way which significantly con-
tributed to the killing of foreign leaders?

AUTHORIZATION. Where thére was involvement by U.S.

officials in assassination plots or other killings, were such

activities ordered and if 80, at what levels of our Government?

Countr; a Individual Involved

Dominican Republic -Rafael Trujillo

Chile General Rene Schneider
South Vietnam Ngo Dinh Diem

In summary, the evidence with respect to each allegation disclosed

the following.*

el Castro (Cuba). United States Government personnel plotted
to kill Castro beginning in 1960. American underworld Figures were used in
these plots as well as Cubans hostile to the Castro regine. One of the later
plots, which lasted until 1965, involved a cuban dissident who was provided

encouragement and material support by the United States.

Patrice Lumumba (Congo/Zaire). In the Tall of 1959, two CIA

officials were asked by superiors to assassinate Lumumba. Poisons were
sent to the Congo and some exploratory steps were taken toward gaining
access to Lumumba. Subsequently, in early 1961, Lumumba was killed by
Congolese rivals. It does not appear from. the evidence that the United
States was involved in the actual killing.

Rafael Trujillo (Dominican Republic). Trujillo was shot by

Dominican dissidents on May 31, 1961. ‘Commencing in 1960 and continuing

to the time of the assassination, the U.S. Government generally supported

these dissidents and some Governaent personnel were aware that they intended
to kill Trujillo. Three pistols and three carbines were furnished by
American officials, although a request for machine guns was later refused.

There was conflicting evidence whether the weapons were knowingly supplied

for use in the assassination and whether any were present’at the scene.

Schneider died of gunshot wounds inflicted while resisting a kidnap attempt

three days earlier. Schneider, as Commander in Chief of the Arny and a

constitutionalist opposed to military!coups, was considered an obstacle to

(2) Whether the plot was specifically intended to kill a
foreign leader,or actnee the leader's death vas-a reasonably
foreseeable consequence of an attempt to overthrow the govern-
ment.

i
The Castro case is an example of a plot conceived by United States

officials to kill a foreign leader. The Lumumba plot falls into the si
category. |
In the case of Trujillo, although*the U. S. Covernment certainly

:
opposed his regime, it did not initiate the plot. Rather, United States

officials responded to requests for aid from lecal dissidents whose ain

clearly vas to. assassinate Trujillo. jBy aiding them this country was in-

plicated, whether the specific weaponty actually supplied was neant to kill

Pa Trujillo or was only intended as a symbol of U.S. support for the dissidents.

The Schneider case is different from that of both Castro and Tru-

|
jillo. The United States Government ought a coup and provided, support to

local dissidents, knowing they believed that General Schneider was an obstacle

to their plans. iovever, even though the support included deadly weapons,
it appears that the intention of both ithe dissidents and the United States
officials was to abduct, not to kill, General Schneider. Similarly, in

the Diem case, United States officials did want a change in Government, but

there is nd°evidence that the United States sought the death of Die himself.

and. Cont ‘

points must be made clear. Fi
Government opposed the various leaders in question, U.S. officials

at the bighest levels objected to the’Castro and Trujillo regines, believed

the accession of Allende to power in.Chile would be harmful to Americana in-
terests, and thought of Lumumba as a dangerous force in the heart of Africa.
Second, the evidence on assassinations has to be viewed in the context of other,

more massive activities directed agaiast the regi

’ other forms of intervention in the affairs of foreign nations. Therefore,

the Committee endeavored to explore as e the question of

how and why the plots mappened, authorized, and if so, from

what level the authorization came. j

We discovered a murky picture..:It is not clear whether this is

an agency of the United States Government without authority +

HW 50955 DocId:32423524° Page 17


Based upon the record of our, investigation, the Committee's
single most important finding is that the ‘system was such that assassina-

tion activity could have been undertaken by an,agency of the United States
i

Government without it having been uncontrovertibly clear that there was

explicit authorization from the highest level.

Along with that paramount c four other

aclusion, the Committee tat:

major findings.* The first relates to the lack of direct evidence of authori~

gation of the assassination plots by Presidents or other persons above the

Governmental agency or agencies involved. The second lains why certain

officials may have, nonetheless, perceived that, according to their judgment

and experience, assassination was an a¢geptable course of action. The third

criticizes. agency officials for failing on several occasions to reveal their

plans and activities to superior authorities, or for failing.to do so with
i

sufficient detail and clarity. The fourth criticizes Administration officials
i

for, on occasion, giving vague and indirect instructions to subordinates, and

cluded from

i
for not making sufficiently clear that assassination should be

consideration.
There is admittedly a tension within the four findings. The first

and third points tend to suggest a lack)

fourth points explain why agency officials could nonetheless have perecived

of authority vhile the second and

that. their actions were proper. This tension reflects a basic conflict in the
evidence. While there are sone conflicts over facts, it is more important
that there may often have been two differing perceptions of the same facts.

This distinction may be the result of the differing backgrounds and ex-

perience of those persons experienced ‘in covert operations as distinquighed

POLICY DEVELOPMENT AND APPROVAL. MECHANISM.
The evidence dealt with in Part III is concerned with what actually
happened as far.as obtaining, or not obtaining, authorization for the ac-
tivities under review by the Committed; With respect to what was meant

to happen in regard to covert action generally, the CIA's General Counsel

stated in 1962:

CIA must necessarily be responsible for planning. Oc-

casionally suggestions for action will come from out-

side sources but, to depend entirely on such require-

ments would be an evasion of the Agency's responsibili-
ay ties. Also, the average person, both in government and
outside, is thinking along norinal lines and to develop
clandestine cold war activities) properly, persons know-
ing both the capabilities and imitations of clandestine
action must be studying and deVising how such actions
can be undertaken effectively.

With respect to policy approval, the General Counsel went on to say:
|

Both in developing ideas or plans-fer action it is in-
cumbent upon the Agency to obtain necessary policy ap-
proval, and for this purpose these matters should be
explored with proper officials|in other departments
and agencies, particularly in the Departments of State
and Defense, so the determination can be made as to
whether any one proposal should! go to the Special Group
or higher for policy determination.

The General Counsel's 1962 memorandum made it clear that the CIA

considered itself responsible for developing proposals and plans to

The foregoing should not be taken|/to imply that the procedures

always have been clear and tidy, nor}.that they have always been fol-

ma lowed. Prior to 1955, formal procedures barely existed at all. in
1955 the Special Group procedures wefelmade more formal. Neverthe-
less, the procedures that were followed during the period of 1959-63

were. characterized by an internal CIA memorandum as "somewhat cloudy

and thus can probably be described. ag Having been based on value judg-

ments by the DCI." (Memorandum for the Record, C/CA/PEG, "Policy Co-

ordination of CIA's Covert Action Operations," 21 February 1967)

In addition to the "somewhat cloudy" nature of the formal pro-

cedures themselves, there are other dptions afailable to any Chief Ex-

ecutive. The Committee recognizes that’

can be disregarded from above or below/! In at least one case, for

example, a President instructed CIA officials not to consult with the

Special Group or other departments. at.least one other case, Agency

officials decided not to bring matters'jto the attention of the Special

Group. It should also be noted that ait of the above procedures apply

FBI records reveal that Maheu end Roselli (alias J. A, Rollins)

Giancana had been brought into the operation, but prior to

Eee (i) Evidence Concernifig CIA involvement in the Tap. The
) EE

Committee received conflicting “i = on whether the agency was consulted

prior to the installation of the fap." O'Connell testified that he

)

had called Edwards and cleared the placement of an electronic "bug" in

Rowan's apartment prior to the

tallation of the tap (O'Connell,

pp. 67-71). Maheu recalled tay ir hadwinitially asked O'Connell if
_ the CIA would handle the job, alton O'Connell had told him that
"he would call Mr.. a and see if they would have the
capability of accompli ping this, . . . and that subsequently
i ; he informed me that me | : Edwards had said that they would not
do it, but approved seine for it if we hired an independent

private detective to vii it on." (Maheu, 7/29, p. 37).

On the other hand, Edwards, in a May 14, 1962 memorandum for the

i

Attorney General (discussed at legen, infra, p. ), stated that

"At the time of the tnelaent. neither. the Agency nor

the undersigned knew of the proposed technical installation."**

Regardless of whether the CIA dally authorized the tap, it is apparent
that the CIA paid for the tap jDuBois told FBI agents that Maheu had
paid him a retainer of $1,000 (Bile R-505, p. 14). O'Connell confirmed
that CIA "indirectly" paid for! the tap because "we paid Maheu a certain
amount of mney and he just pa it out of what we were giving him."

"Q: But it was understood), ‘or you understood, that out of the money
the CIA made available: ‘to Maheu, Dubois would be paid for the tap?

A: Yes.
eRe : : -
Q: And Colonel Edwards. knew somebody was being employed

are A: That is right." (O'ebtinel p. 69.)
bar memorandum by J.. Edgar Hoover: states that the Attorney General said he had
been told by Edwards that the "CIA admitted that they had assisted Maheu
in making the installation" (Meio Hoover, 4/10/62).

The Inspector General's Report acéepted Edwards' assertion that "the

Agency was first unwitting and thén a reluctant accessory after the fact",

but offered no further evidence tis support that contention (1.G., p. 67).
The Committee also récgived conflicting evidence concerning

“whether the tap had been placed’:

Q keep Giancana in Miami or to check

on security leaks. O'Connell testified that during the early stages of

negotiations with the gambling syndicate, Maheu informed O'Connell that a

girl friend of Giancana was havi g an affair with Rowan. Giancana wanted

blowing every kind of cover that I had tried to arrange to keep quiet"

Roselli said that he told Gianeana that the CIA was involved in the

operation "in order to have hin keep his mouth shut" (Roselli, p. 27).

involved) by an October 18, 1960 memorandum from J. Edgar Hoover, which
th
‘i stated that "a source whose reliability has not been tested" reported:

"(D)uring recent conversations with several friends,
Giancana stated that Fidel Castro was to be done

away with very shortly. When doubt was expressed
regarding this statement, Giancana reportedly assured
those present that Castro's assassination would

occur in November. Moreover, he allegedly indicated
that he had already met with the assassin-to-be on

three occasions. . . Giancana claimed that everything has
been perfected for the killing of Castro, and

that the 'assassin' had arranged with a girl, not further
described, to drop a 'pill' in some drink or

food of Castro's." (File R-505, memo from Hoover

to DCI (Att: DDP), 10/19/60.)

Roselli testified that Maheu had given him two explanations for the tap
on different occasions: first 3 that Gjancana was concerned about a
% z
possible affair between Rowan and his girl friend; and, second, that he
i
had arranged the tap to determine whether Giancana had told his girl
: H
friend about the assassination|plot, and whether she was spreading the
{
story (Roselli, pp. 47-48). Maheu gave the second explanation to the
FBI when he was questioned abollt his involvement in the tap (File
R-505, FBI Summary), and Edwards wrote in the memorandum to the
Attorney General:
"ygheu stated that Sam Glancana thought that (Giancana's
girl friend) might kmow of the proposed operation and
might. pass on the information to one Dan Rowan, a friend
of (Giancana's girl friend)". (Memorandum, Edwards to
Kennedy, 5/14/62.)
(ii) Consequences of the tap. Edwards told Maheu that if he
was "approached by the FBI, he could refer them to me to be briefed

that-he was engaged in an intelligence operation directed at Cuba"

(Memo, Edwards to Kennedy, 5/14/62). FBI records indicate that on April 18,

ne? Basm Uy? t; -

1961, Maheu informed the FBI that the tap involved the CIA,
and suggested that Sheffield Edwards be. contacted (File R-505,
Memo, 4/20/61). Edwards subsequently informed the Bureau
that the CIA would object to Maheu's prosecution because it
might reveal sensitive information relating to the abortive
Bay of Pigs invasion® (R-505, ‘Summary of FBI file). Ina
memo dated April 2h, 1962, Herbett J. Miller, Assistant
Attorney General, Criminal Division, advised the Attorney
General that the "national interest" would preclude any
prosecutions based upon the tap. Following a briefing of
the Attorney General by the CIA, a decision was made not to

prosecute.**

* Details of the discussions between the CIA and FBI are
described fully infra at pp. .

** Maheu subsequently drew on his involvement with the CIA
to avoid testifying before Senator Edward Long's Committee
investigating invasions of privacy in 1966. According to the
Inspector General's Report, when Maheu learned that the
Committee intended to call him, "he applied pressure on the
Agency in a variety of ways--suggesting that publicity might
expose his past sensitive work for the CIA" (I.G., p. 74).
Lawrence Houston, General Counsel for the CIA, met with Maheu
and his attorney, Edward P. Morgan, and informed Senator Long
that Maheu had been involved in CIA operations (Houston, pp.
58-60). As a result, the Long Committee did not call Maheu
to testify.

(4) Poison Pills Are Prepared and Delivered

to Cuba

The Inspector General's Report described
conversations among Bissell, Edwards, and Cornelius Roosevelt,
Chief of the Technical Services Division (TSD), concerning
the most effective method of poisoning Castro (1.¢., pp. 23-
2h). ‘There is some evidence i Giancana or Roselli originated
the idea of depositing a poison pill in Castro's drink to give
the "asset" a chance to escape (I.G., p. 25). O'Connell
recalled Roselli's request for something “nice and clean, with-
out getting into any kind of out ana out ambushing", preferably

a poison that would disappear'without a trace (O'Connell, p. 116).

The Inspector General's Report cited O'Connell as stating that
; the Agency had first er a "gangland-style killing" in
which Castro would be gunned Perea erreur es reer ett
the idea because it would be difficult to recruit someone for
such a dangerous operation, aria suggested instead the use of
poison. (I.G., p. 25)
“—-Bawards rejected the first batch of pills
prepared by TSD because they. would not dissolve in water. A
second batch, containing botulinum toxin, "did the job expected
of them" when tested on monkeys. (1.G., pp. 25-26; O'Connell,

p. 43) O'Connell received the pills from TSD, probably in

February 1961, with reassurances that they were lethal,* and

(egeaars ® Records of the TSD still extant in 1967 indicate that the
pills were tested on February 10 and delivered to O'Connell
sometime thereafter.

HW 50955 DocId:32423524 Page 43


1g

then gave them to Roselli (o*Connell, p. 43).

In late February or March 1961, Roselli
reported to O'Connell that the pills had been delivered in
Cuba to an official close to Castro who may have received
kickbacks from the gambling interests (I.G., p. 23). The

official kept the pills for a few weeks, then returned them.

Roselli and O'Connell ascribed! his failure to a case of
"cold feet" (Roselli, p. 2h; gfeornen, p. 44). The Inspector
General noted that he had soot his position in the Prime
Minister's office, and thus access to*Uastro, before he
received the pills (I.G., p. 38).
(5) A Second belivery Is Attempted

youloving: this first failure, Roselli told
O'Connell that Trafficante believed Tony Varona, a leading
figure in the Cuban exile movement, might be able to accom-
plish the assassination (I.G., p. 29).* Dr. Manuel Antonio
de Varona y Lorado headed the Democratic Revolutionary Front,
a Cuban exile group supported by the CIA. The Inspector
Genefal's Report suggests that Varona may have been receiving
funds from Trafficante and other racketeers interested in

securing "gambling, prostitution, and dope monopolies" in

* O'Connell testified that he met Varona only once, and
that after the meeting Varona told Roselli:

"Look, I don't know [sic] like the CIA and you can't

tell me that this guy isn't a CIA man". O'Connell

recalled, "I don't know whether T showed it or what, io
but he suspected that I wasn't what I was represented
tobe." (O'Connell, p. 22.)

HW 50955 DocId:32493524 Page 44


20

Cuba after the overthrow of Castro (I.G., p. 29). The Report
speculated that Varona was interested in the assassination
scheme as a means of financing the purchase of arms and
communications equipment (I.G., p. 31).
Varona claimed to have a contact inside
a restaurant frequented by Castro (Roselli, p. 21). Asa
prerequisite to the deal, he demanded cash and $1,000 worth
of communications equipment (1.G., pp. 31-32; O'Connell, p. 23).
O'Connell recalls that Colonel J. C. King, head of the Western
i
Hemisphere Division, gave him '$50,0007in Bissell's office to
pay Varona if he successfully assassinated Castro (O'Connell,
pp. 17-21). O'Connell stated ‘that Bissell also authorized him
: to give Varona the electronics sequipment that he requested
j (0'Connell, pp. 20-24). im
Bissell testified that he did not doubt that
some cash was given to "Connell, and that he was aware that
the poison pills had bees prepared. He did not recall the
meeting, and considered it unlikely that O'Connell. would have
: been given the money in his office (Bissell, 6/11, p. 40). The
Inspector General's Report, relying on an Office of Security
memorandum to the DDCI dated June 24, 1966, as well as on an
interview with the person who signed the voucher for the funds,
placed the amount, at $10,000 (I.G., pp. 31-32). If the

Inspector General's conclusionsWere correct, the funds which

Bissell allegedly authorized were probably the advance payment «

HW 50955 DocId:32423524 Page 45


to Varona, and not the $150,000’ that was to be paid to Varona

after. Castro's death.
The record does clearly reflect, however,

that communications equipment was delivered to Varona* and

that he was paid advance money to cover his expenses, probably
in the amount of $10,000 (I.G:, p. 32). The money and pills
were delivered at'a meeting between Maheu, Roselli, Trafficante,
and Varona at the Fontainebleau Hotel in Miami. As Roselli

recalled, Maheu :

"opened his briefcase and dumped a whole lot of money

on his lap .. . and also came up with the capsules

and he explained how they were going to be used. As

far as I remember, they couldn't be used in boiling

soups and things like that, but they could be used in
water or otherwise, but they couldn't last forever... .
It had to be done as quickly as possible. (Roselli,

p. 21). ¥*

Varona had:no better success than Orta.
According to the Inspector General's Report, Edwards believed
the scheme failed because Castro stopped visiting the restau-

rant where the "asset" was employed. Maheu suggested an

* O'Connell testified that a man from the communications
office delivered the communications equipment that Varona had
requested to Miami (O'Connell, :p. 20). Maheu recalled deliver-
ing an automobile which he had been told contained communica-
tions.equipment to an empty lot (Maheu, p. 52).

** Maheu denied that this dramatic event ever occurred, and
did not recall being present at a meeting at which the pills
were passed (Maheu, pp. 40-l1). Maheu did recall that O'Connell
showed him the pills in an envelope and told him that the pills
would be given to a Cuban (Maheu, p. 40).

HW 50955 DocId:32423524 Page 46

ala,

alternative reason. He recalled being informed that after

the pills had been delivered to Cuba, "the go signal still had

|

to be received before in fact'lthey were administered" (Maheu,

p. 42). He testified that hejwas informed by O'Connell some-

time after the operation that! the Cubans had an opportunity

di
to administer the pills to Fidel Castro and either Che Guevarra

or Raul Castro, but that the ile signal" never came (Maheu,
pp. 43-4, 60-61). He did not know who was responsible for
giving the signal (Maheu, p. liy-5). Varona subsequently
returned the cash and the pag (o'connell, “pp. 19-20; CIA
Justice file R-153, Menorandun| Osborn to DCI, 6/24/66).
The date of thé Varona operation is

ia

unclear. The Inspector General's Report places it in March-

Nae

April 1961, prior to the Bay of Pigs (I.G., p. 29). Bissell
testified that the effort against Castro was called off after
the Bay of Pigs (Bissell, 6/Ls pe 52) and Maheu testified

that he had no involvement in the operation after the Bay of
Pigs (Maheu, P. 50). 0'Connell., however, was certain that it

\ :
occurred during early 1962 (O'Connell, pp. 47-48).

{c) Use of Underworld Figures: Phase II

(1) Change in Leadership
The Inspector General's Report

divides the gambling syndicate operation into Phase I, termina-

HW 50955 DocId:32423524 Page 47


HW 50955

ting with the Bay of Pigs, and Phase II, beginning with
William Harvey's involvement in late 1961. The distinction
between a clearly demarcated Phase I and Phase II may be an
artificial one, as there is considerable evidence that the
operation was continuous, perhaps lying dormant for the period

immediately: following the bey’ f Pigs.*

o:
In‘ early 1961, Harvey** was assigned the
1g

responsibility for establishing a general capability within

the CIA for disabling foreign aders, including assassination

as a "last resort" (Bissell, 6/9, p. 73; Harvey, 6/25, pp. 34-35).

i
* Harvey said that he took over a "going operation" from
Edwards (1.G., p. 42; Harvey, 6/25, p. 67) and emphasized

that:

"I would like to make as clear as I can that there was
no phase 1, phase 2 in this. This is an ongoing matter
which I injected into . . |. . (Harvey, 6/25, p. 90).

Continuity was provided by retaining O'Connell as the case
officer for the project well into May 1962. During interviews
for the aS peer General's Report, O'Connell recalled that
there was "something going on" between the Bay of Pigs and
Harvey's assumption of control,|\(1.G., p. 43). When testifying
before the Committee, 0"Connenil; firmly recalled several trips
to Miami in the Fall of 1961, and "right up to the time I
turned it over to Harvey I was’ in and out of Miami" (O'Connell,

_ Pp. 89-90).

** Harvey had a long background in clandestine activities.
He had conceived and carried out the Berlin tunnel operation
(Harvey, 6/25, pp. 8-9), and served as Chief of the givision,
which was responsible for,,the.. -surreptitious acquisition of code
information (Harvey, 6/25, pp. 8-9).

The capability was called Exed

a

included under the cryptonym ZR/RIFLE. It and the evidence

relating to (i) its connection] yee the "White House" and (ii)

whether or not it involved action as well as "capability" is

discussed extensively infra ae.
ih
Harvey's, hotes reflect that Bissell asked

him to take over the gambling’ syndicate operation from Edwards

and discussed the “application of ZR/RIFLE to Cuba" on
November 16, 1961 (I.G., p. 39). Bissell confirmed that the

conversation took place and accepted fhe November date as

accurate (Bissell, 7/17, pp. 12-13). He also testified that the

operation _ ,

“was not reactivated, iniiother words, no instructions

} - went out to Roselli or to others . . . to renew the
attempt, until after I had’ left the Agency" (Bissell,
6/11, p. 53).

Harvey agreed that his conversation with Bissell was limited
to exploring the feasibility of using the gambling syndicate
against Castro (Harvey, 7/11, - 60).

a Richard Helms replaced Bissell as
DDP in February 1962. As such, he was Harvey's superior.

Harvey testified that he kept Helms informed of the gambling

bee that

syndicate operation at all stgest (Harvey, 6/25, pp. E566;
T/ll, p. 42; 1.G., p. 41).

(2) The Operation is Reactivated

In early April 1962, Harvey, who testi-
fied that- he was acting on "explicit orders" from Helms (Harvey,

7/11, p. 18), requested Edwards, to put him in touch with Roselli
i
(CIA Justice File R-153; Bawards memorandum, 5/14/62). O'Connell

first introduced Harvey to Roselli in-.Miami, where Harvey told
Roselli to maintain his Cuban ontacta, but not to deal with Maheu
or Giancana (O'Connell, Pp. 505! Roselli, pp. 27-30), whom he had
decided were "untrustworthy" and "surplus" (Harvey, 6/25, p. 65).

ds
O'Connell recalled that Roselli. did not initially trust Harvey,

*When interviewed for the ‘Thspector General's Report, Harvey
} stated that he briefed Helms on| his first meeting with Roselli,
: and "thereafter he regularly briefed Helms on the status of the
Castro operation" (I.G., p. di)t

1
Helms' recollection was less certain. Helms did recall that
he was briefed by Harvey when Harvey first contacted Roselli in

April 1962. He remembered that {he ' "reluctantly" had approved the operation,
but that he had no confidence that it would succeed (Helms, 7/17,
p. 23).

When asked..if he authorized sending the poison pills to Florida,
Helms testified: ‘

"I believe they were poison pills, and I don't recall

necessarily approving them; but since Harvey alleges to

have them and says that he 'took them to Miami, I must

have, I must have authorized them in some fashion."

(Helms, 6/13, p. 4h).

‘Helms confirmed that. Harvey was "reporting quite regularly what
was going on. Whether he reported everything or not, I do not know."
It was Helms' expectation that Harvey would have reported to hima
matter such as the pills. (Helms, 6/13, p. 105). However, Helms also
testified: i

i

"You saw the I.G, Report says that I was kept currently
informed. Maybe I was and maybe I wasn't, and today

I don't remember it, as I have said. But I do not
recall ever having been convinced that any attempt was
really made on Castro's life"(Helms, 7/18, p. 32).

HW 50955 DocId:|32423524 Page 50 ue


although they subsequently developed a close friendship.
(O'Connell, p. 52).
Harvey, O'Connell and Roselli met for
‘a second time in New York on April 8-9, 1962 (I.G., p. 43). A
notation made during this time in the files of the Technical Ser-
vices Division indicates that folir poison pills were given to O'Connell
on April 18, 1962 (I.G., pp. 46-li7). The pills were passed to Harvey,
who arrived in Miami on April 21, and found Roselli already in touch
with Varona (I.G., p- 47). He gave the pills to Roselli, explaining
that "these woula work anywhere and at any time with anything" (Roselli,
p. 31). Roselli testified that he told Harvey that the Cubans intended
to use the pills to assassinate Che Guevara as well as Fidel and Raul
i Castro. According to Roselli's eee Harvey approved of the
targets, stating "everything is all right, what they want to do"
(Roselli, p. 34). \
Varona requested arms and. equipment as
a guid pro quo’ for carrying out, iphe assassination operation (O'Connell,
pp. 53-54). Harvey, with the help ofthe CIA's Miami station :
(JMWAVE), procured explosives, detonators, rifles, handguns,
radios, and boat radar costing about $5,000 (I.G., p. 49).. Harvey
andthe chief of the JMWAVE station rented a U-Haul truck under
an assumed name and delivered the equipment to a parking lot
(Harvey, 6/25, p-63). The keys were given to Roselli, who watched

the delivery from across the street with O'Connell (O'Connell, pp. 92-93).

i

2 bf

The truckload of equipment was finally picked up by either Varona

or Roselli's agent, Maceo (1.G., pp. 49-50; Roselli, p. 40).

Harvey testified that the arms "could" have been for use in the
assassination attempt, but that they were not given to Varona
solely for that purpose (Harvey, T/ll, p. 9).

Roselli kept Harvey informed of the
operation's progress. timc in May 1962, he reported that the
pills and guns had arrived in cuba (Harvey, 6/25, p. 64; Roselli,
pp- 34, 42-43). On June 21, he told Harvey that Varona had dis-
patched a three-man team to Cuba. The Inspector General's Report
described the team's mission as. "vague" and conjectured that: the
team would kill Castro or recruit others to do the Job, using the
poison pills if the opportunity arose (I.G., p. 51).

Harvey met Roselli in Miami on September 7
and 11, 1962. Varona was idea ect to be preparing to send in
another three-man team to penetrate Castro's bodyguard. Harvey
was told that the pills, referred to as "the medicine," were
still "safe" in Cuba (Harvey, 6/25, p. 103; I.G., p. 51).

if Harvey testified that by this time he
had grave doubts about whether|the operation would ever take
place, and told Roselli that "there's not much likelihood that
this is going anyplace, or that it should be continued" (Harvey,
6/25, p. 104). Varona's second team never left for Cuba, claiming

that "conditions" in Cuba were!not right (I.G., p. 51-52). During

early January 1963, Harvey paid Roselli $2,700 to defray Varona's

expenses (I.G., p. 52). |

Harvey terminated the cpratic in pies esl 1963. Ata
meeting with Roselli in Los'Angeles, it was agreed that Roselli
would taper off his communications with Varona (i.G., pp. 52-53).
Roselli testified that he simply broke off contact with the Cubans.
However, he never informed tnda that the offer of $150,000 for
Castro's assassination had ie withdrawn* (Roselli, p. 45).

Roselli attributed his motivation to patriotism** and testified
that he was not paid for his services. According to O'Connell,

In 1943, Roselli had been convicted of extorting money from

and during the period of his gontacts with the CIA, Roselli was
deeply involved in hotel and (gambling operations in Las Vegas
(File R-505, Summary of FBI Documents). It is possible that he

operation might serve him well'in the future.

Two mapas to assassinate Castro were ex-

of the Task Force, asked Samuel Halpern to determine whether an exotic

seashell, rigged to explode, could be deposited in an area where Castro
{
commonly went skin diving (Halpern,|p. 28). The idea was explored by the

Technical Division and discarded as| impractical (Helms, 6/13, p. 135; I.G., p-77)

** In May 1966, the FRI. threatened tol deport_Roselli for living in the United

- States under an assumed name unless! they cooperated in an investigation of the
Mafia. (Roselli, whose true name is Filippo Saco, was born in Italy and
allegedly brought illegally into the United States while still a child.)
Roselli contacted Edwards, who informed the FBI that Roselli wanted to
"keep square with the Bureau," but was:afraid that gangsters might kill. him
for "talking" (CIA Justice File Re 153,'Memorandum, Osborn to FBI, 5/27/66).
After Roselli was arrested for fraudulent gambling activities at the Friars
Club in Beverly Hills in 1967, he requested Harvey, who had left the Agency,
‘to represent him (CIA Justice File R-153, Memorandum for Record by Osborn,
12/11/67). Warvey contacted the Agenicy and suggested that it prevent the
prosecution (Osborn Memorandum, supra)? Roselli was subsequently convicted
of violating United States interstate gambling laws. In 1971, the CIA
approached the Immigration and Naturalization Service, Department of Justice,
to "forestall public disclosure of Roselli’ S$ past operational activity

y with CIA "that might occur if deportai ion proceedings were brought. (CIA to

a Select Committee, 7/21/75). It was a reed that CIA would be kept informed

of developments in that case. The deportation order is presently being

contaminated diving suit* (Colby , 5/21, pp. 38-39).

The Inspector General's Report dates this

operation in January 1963, when Fitzgerald replaced Harvey as

- Chief of Task Force W, although it is unclear whether Harvey or
Fitzgerald conceived of the {plan (I.G., p. 75). It is likely
that the activity took place éarlier, since Donovan had completed
his negotiations by the middlt ‘of January 1963. Helms characterized
the plan as "cockeyed" (Helns’, ,6/13, p. 135).

TSD bougtit a diving suit, dusted the inside

diving suit on his own initial ve (I.G., p. 75). Helms testified

From the first contact with AM/LASH-1, until

the latter part of 1963, it. ‘was uncertain whether he would defect

During this period the CIA also sponsored a separate operation to

"penetrate the Cuban military to encourage either defections

_perhaps even to forming a group which would be capable of

replacing the then present government in Cuba" (Case Officer 1,

sonnel dealin gwith AM/LASHEL were aware of his desire to take such

ing with AM/LASH-1 stated: |

"Have no intention give AMLASH-l physical elim-
ination mission as requirement but recognize
this something he could or might try to carry

* Case Officer 1 testified that AM/LASH-1 discussed "eliminating Castro,

although he attributed such| remarks to AMLASH-1's "mercurial" nature,
and stated that no specific):plans for assassinations were ever discussed
(Case Officer 1, pp. 39-415; 62). The case officer who took over the
AMLASH project in September 1963 recalled being briefed by Case Officer
1 on AMLASH's belief that Castro's assassination was a necessary first
step in a coup. (Case Officer 2 p. 28).

The second AMLASH case officer described the ontext in which AMLASH-1
generally raised the topic of’ Seen

Halpern, |Fitzgerald's assistant, told the

D
|

Committee that the pen was intended to show "bona fides" and

"The orders were to do something to get rid of Castro...
and we thought this other method might work whereas. a rifle
wouldn't." (Halpern, 26)

Helms confirmed that the pen was manufactured
: i
"to take care of a request. from him that he have some device

for getting rid of, Castro, for killing him, murdering him,

whatever the case may; be." (Helms, 6/13, p. 113)

". . . (t)his was a tlemporizing gesture." (Helms, 6/11, p. 133)*

On November 22, 2963, Fitzgerald and the case
officer met with AMLACH-1 in a European capital and offered him
the poison pen, recommending that he use Blackleaf-40, a deadly poison
which is commercially available. (Case Officer 2, p. 112) The Inspect-
or General's Report noted that
"it is likely that at the very moment President Kennedy was
shot a CIA officer was meeting with a Cuban agent in Paris

and giving him an assassination device for use against
Castro." (I.G., p. 94)

*® In his testimony before the.Committee, Case Officer 2 offered a con-
flicting story. He said that the purpose of the pen was

"to provide AMLASH with a device which would serve him to

protect” Himself in casé¢ he was-confronted with and charged

with being involved in|a military coup against Castro.”

(Case Officer 2, p. 107)
According to the case officer, AMLASH-1 had requested an "esoteric device
which could easily be concealed and which he could use in self-defense
(Case Officer 2, po. 98-99).| The device was not intended for offensive
use paca any person, but was rather

-- "a kind of psychologica} crutch . . .to help him think that

we were interested in his own protection, his own security”
(Case Officer 2, pp. 104-105).

This version is wholly inconsistent with documents in the CIA ‘files, some
of which were written by the AMLASH case officer, which establish that
AMLASH-1 intended to kill Castro, and that the CIA knew his desiré and

endeavored to supply the means. that he needed.

(3) Providing AMLASH-1 with Arms

CIA cables indicate that one cache of arms
for AMLASH~1 was delivered in|Cuba in March 1964 and another in
June. An entry in the AMLASH|file for May 5, 1964, states that
the case officer requested the Technical Services Division to pro-
duce, on a "crash basis," a sillencer which would fit an FAL rifle.
The contact report of a neeting between the case officer and a
confidant of AMLASH states that AMLASH was subsequently informed
that it was not feasible to make a silencer -for an FAL.

Toward tHe latter part of 1964, AMLASH-1
became more insistent on the! fact that the assassination of the
Cuban leadership was a necessary initial step in a successful coup.

(Case Officer 2, pp. 129-133 In a memorandum dated December 10,

1964, the case officer wrote:
et
"AMLASH-1 was told and’ fully understands that the United
States Government cannot become involved to any degree
‘in the 'first step’ of’ his plan. If he needs support, he
realizes he will have to get it elsewhere. FYI: This is

recalls describing the tttoner as being 'from A to B to
C'. As he then envisioned it, A was Maheu, B was
Roselli, and C was the phincipal in Cuba. Edwards
recalls that Mr. Dulles mérely nodded, presumably in
understanding and appro Certainly there was no
opposition. Edwards states that, while there was no
formal approval as such,. ‘he felt that he. Eoearae: had
_ tacit approval to use his}own judgement.' (1.G.
pp. 17-18.)

Bissell testified that the desicription sounded "highly plausible"

(Bissell Tr. 6/9/75 at 24.) Edwards said it was "accurate"

rT
In light of the manner in which Bissell and Edwards
described briefing Dulles, the question arises as to whether

Dulles in fact would have understood that the operation involved

assassination. The Inspector |General, in attempting to "con-
jecture as to just what the Director did approve", decided

|
"It is safe to conclude, \given the men participating and
the general subject of the meeting, that there was little
likelihood of misunderstanding--even though the details
were deliberately blurred and the specific intended
result was never stated to unmistakable language. It is
also reasonable to conclude that the pointed avoidance of
‘bad words' emphasized to the participants the extreme
sensitivity of the operation." (I.G., p. 18

Bissell testified that { i

fh
"I can only say that I am quite sure I came away from
that meeting--and there was, I think, subsequent
occasions when this came /up between Mr. Dulles and
myself, and I am quite convinced that he knew the nature
of the operation.’ a {i

«e be *
fi
"Q.: .What were the subsequent conversations you had

with Mr. Dulles in which} you concluded that he knew
that this was an assassination effort?

MB ie Geist tu ttn eo really a guess on my part ‘that


such conversations occurred,. . . I do believe they did
occur is that during the | sntire autumn I suppose I must
have spoken to Mr. Dulleg!! practically daily about some
aspect of the whole Cuban operation and I am virtually
certain that he would in} one or another of those con-
versations and probably thore than once have asked if
there was anything to report about the Sheffield Edwards’
operation. He also may have been in direct contact with
“ Edwards at that time." (Bissell Tr. 6/9/75, pp. 24-26)

When asked by the Chairman why, in this context,
persons within the Agency talkéd "in riddles to one another",

Bissell replied that: th

I think there was 4 reluctance to spread even
on an oral record some aspects of this operation.

1 -
"Chairman: Did the reluctiance spring from the fact
that it simply grated against your conscience to have
to speak more explicitly? |

"Bissell: I don't think tt grated against my conscience.
I think it may have been a feeling that the Director
} ‘{Dullesl preferred the usé of the sort of language that
is described in the 1.G. epore. i
|:

Bissell, in a subsequent appearance before the
Committee, again addressed the lissue of whether he and Edwards
had made it clear to Dulles that what was involved was an

assassination operation: :
"I. thought I-made clear that it-was my impression--and
I believe the impression incidentally that I thought
was confirmed in the [I.G: Report]--that in discussing
this with Dulles and Cabell . . . the objective of the
operation was made unmistakably clear to them. The
terms 'an intelligence operation’, I think someone
said, was.that not a cover designation? But we would not
under any circumstances have told Allen Dulles that this
was an intélligence collection operation. If I said that
on Monday, I must have given a wrong impression."
(Bissell Tr. 6/11, p. 24.)

On the other hand, “Seott Breckenridge, the only

Sheffield Edwards was;iquite infirm when examined by

the Committeé and has since died.* Edwards testified before

the Committee as follows:

"

; {T]his possible project was approved by Allen B.
Dulles, Director of CIA, and by General Cabell, the
Deputy Director. They are both dead.

“The Chairman: How do youjknow, Colonel, that the
project had been approved ‘by these two gentlemen?

“Edwards: I personally briefed Allen Dulles . . . and
Cabell." (Edwards, 5/30/75) pp. 5-6)

In his interview with| the Rockefeller Commission,

Edwards testified (Edwards interview, p. 5):

ul
"Q.: Now, who inside the Agency besides Bissell did
you have any contact with jpn the top echelon?

"A, Very important. The; plan was approved by Allen W.
Dulles and General Cabell"

* As the investigation procteded, members of the Committee
requested that Edwards be recalled. Edwards passed away
before this could be accomplished. As a result of Edwards’
infirmity and subsequent death), the Committee was unable to
examine him effectively concerning his conflicting prior
statements, concerning Dulles’ knowledge of the plots.

Bissell did not have'a clear independent recollection

of the dates involved, but recalled that discussions concerning

the Autumn of 1960".* He recalled initial discussions among

The testimony indicates that the meeting between Dulles,
Bissell, Edwards, and Cabell occurred sometime “in ‘the autumn’
of 1960, probably around Sepcpier. The minutes of a meeting of
the Special Group, the high- level governmental body for consider-
ing ¢overt action, on November 3, 1960, reflect the following

remarks: 74
“Finally, Mr. Merchant asked whether any real planning
had been done for taking direct positive action against
Fidel, Raul and Che Guevara. He said that without these
three the Cuban Governmént would be leaderless and
probably brainless. He conceded that it would be necessary
to act against ail three simultaneously. General Cabell
pointed out that action of this kind is uncertain of
results and highly dangerous. in conception and execu-
tion, because the instruments must be Cubans. He
felt that, particularly: because of the necessity of
simultaneous action, it would have to be concluded
that Mr. Merchant's suggestion is beyond our capabilities.’
(11/3/60 Special Group Minutes, PL. 3).

Exactly what the term "direct positive action" meant to the

speaker or those listening is uncertain. Neither was able to

offer any interpretive help to, the Committee. However, other

-participants at this meeting have testified that the reference

could mean or include assassination. *

*

"Q: Do you read. . . direct, positive action.
as meaning killing (Fidel Gastro, Raul Castro and Che
Guevara)?"

"A: I would read it that way, yes." (Lansdale
Tr. 7/8/75; p. 103.) .

qi
: -would you agree that the words ‘direct
positive action’ appear to question» whether there's been any
planning in connection with assassinating (the Castros and
Guevara)?" | . . “

MA: I think the phrase ‘positive action' could include
assassinations, but. . . I'm not sure what. was in Mr. Merchant's
mind.” (Gray Tr. 7/9/75, p. 9.)

tt

The CIA considered several assassination plots
at i
against Castro during McCone's tenure as Director. Harvey

initiated his contact with Roselli in April 1962, and the
operation involving underworld figures continued into early
1963. In early 1963 the CIA looked into the possibility of
assassinating Castro with an exploding seashell and contaminated
diving suit. AM/LASH was offered a poison pen device in
November 1963, and caches of arhs were delivered to Cuba for
nis use in the following year. :

the plots to assassinate castro which took place during the
years in which he was Der, and chat he did not authorize those

- plots.* (McCone, 6/6/75, pp. 33, 44-45) He testified that he
was not briefed about the assassination ‘plots by Dulles,

were continuing.* When asked jhether McCone was aware of the

assassination plots against Castro, Helms testified:

No, it isn't my impression that I told him,
at least I don't have any impression, unfor-
tunately. . . . Mr. McCone is an honorable
man, He has done his own testifying, and all
I can say is that I do not know specifically

I honestly didn't recall that Mr. McCone
was not informed and when I was told that
there was evidence that he wasn't informed,
I was trying to serateh my head as to why I
didn't tell him at the time and my surmises
are the best I can come up with. I am really
surprised {I did not discuss ie with him at
the time. My relations with him were good,

able to do in 1975 over an episode that took
place that many years, ago. (Helms, 6/13/75,

Several other Agency ofFigials who were aware of the

assassination plots testified that they had not told McCone
of the plots. William Harvey festities that he never spoke
with McCone about the operation involving underworld figures
or assassination ‘and that, to the best of his knowledge,
MeCone had not been told about , the project. (Harvey,. 6/25/75,

Sheffield Edwards, when abked whether he had informed
McCone about the plot, replied:

Edwards: Well, I did not want to drag

opinion had petered out, and I did not
want te involve him. ¥ (Edwards, p. 18)

James O'Connell, who was the case officer for the opera-
a)
tion under Edwards, testified that he recalled that Edwards had
told him during a discussion avout the plots in 1965 that

Edwards had not briefed McCone on the operation.

Xu As a matter of fact, {1 don't think he ever
knew about it. From-later conversations with
Colonel Edwards, not recently, we talked about
it, and he said that jhe was convinced that
Mr. MeCone never knew about it, it wasn't on
his watch, so to speak, and he didn't want to
get him involved. “ Connell, pp. 37, 39)

George McManus, Helms! Spécial Assistant for Cuba during
the relevant period,. veseified that he was not told about the
assassination activities, and gave his opinion that if McCone
had been asked to approve an agsassination, he "would have

reacted violently immediately" is
i

*McManus advanced two reasong for this opinion:

(1) MeCone had a great love for the President: of
the United States and he sort of looked at him
as an older son or a!brother, a very protective
sense he had about the President, President
Kennedy, and McCone would have immediately said
Jesus, this is a no win ball game.

(2) ~Secondly, as an individual, he would have found
ait morally reprehensible. (McManus, p. 33)

Walter Elder, McCone's Executive Assistant, testified

that he had not known of the upgervorne operation until August

operation prior to that time.*"4 (Elder, p. 15)

(iii) Helms and Harvey Did Not Brief McCone About

the Assassination Plots

McCone assumed the position of DCI in Novem-
ber 1961. It was also in November 1961 that Bissell asked

volving underworld figures. **' Richard Helms replaced Bissell

in February of 1962 and was subsequently briefed by Harvey on

McManus also testified:

i always assumed that Mr. Helms would keep the

Director fully informed of any activity that he

thought was sensitive. . . . Under most cir-
7 cumstances, and indeed under all circumstances
you can imagine, Helms would have told McCone,
with the exception of a situation in which
-Helms had been told by higher authority not to
tell him. (McManus, )\pp. 32-34)

*In August 1963 Helms gave McCone a copy of Edwards' May 14,
1962, memorandum to the. Attorney General. See discussion infra

With respect to the Cuban, assassination matters, where
Colby's kitowledge was only second-hand, Colby said: "Mr. McCone

the existence of the assassination plots. Helms was Harvey's
immediate superior and the person to whom he reported about

the Castro plot activities.

Harvey Spgritiea that in the spring of

1962, when he was preparing to, contact Roselli, he briefed
Helms on the assassination plot. (Harvey, 6/25/75, p. 65)
Harvey said: :

oo L briefed Helms" generally on the take-

over of Roselli, on ‘the doybts about the

operation, on the possible . . . future of

it, and to the extent. it had then been possible,

the assessment of Rogelli and the cutting out

cf various individuals. *
Harvey testified that when he briefed Helms on the assassina-

tion plot operation, they decided that it would not be appro-

priate at that point to brief ‘John McCone.

There was a fairly dltaitea discussion be-

tween myself and Helms as to whether or not

the Director should at that: time be briefed

concerning this. For, a variet of reasons

‘ \

*Harvey testified that when te took over the Roselli opera~
tion, he had "cut out" both Maheu and Giancana. because ' "regard-
less of what I may have thought.of their trustworthiness, .
they were surplus” to the operation. (Harvey, 6/25/75, Pp. 65)

that time:

which were tossed pack and forth, we agreed
that it was not necessary or advisable to brief
him at that time.

I then said, as I recall, to Mr. Helms, if you
decide in the future that he should be briefed,
I would like to know about it in advance to
which, to my best recollection, he agreed.
(Harvey, 6/25/75, p. 66)

mn offered the following explanation for why he and

decided not to discuss the matter with McCone at

There were several reasons-for this. One
this operation at that stage had not been
assessed. It was obviously questionable on
several grounds. It obviously involved know-
ledge by too many people. We were not, even

sure at that point. it had any remote possibility
or rather any real possibility for success. It
had arisen with full authority insofar as either
of us knew long before I knew anything about it,
and before the then-Director became Director of
the Agency.

I saw no reason at that time to charge him
with knowledge of this, at least until we reach-
ed the point where it appeared it might come to
fruitation or had had a chance to assess the
individuals involved and determine exactly the
problem we faced, including the possible problem

-77 and it was a very, or-it appeared.to be, and

HW 50955 DocId:32423524

in my opinion was, at that time, a very real
possibility of this government being blackmailed
either by Cubans for political purposes or by
figures in organized crime for their own self-
protection or aggrandizement, which, as it turned
out, did not happen, but at that time was. a very

pregnant possibility. (Harvey, 6/25/75, pp. 67. 68)

I am definitely not! saying that there was any
effort to hide or conceal any information from
the Director. There’was not. This was a’ dis-
cussion as to whetHer or not it was even neces-
sary or appropriate at this point to take details
of this particular operation in an unassessed
form to. the then-Director at that time. (Harvey,
6/25/75, p. 69)

Harvey stated that he did, not have any reason'to believe
that the assassination activities would have been "disapproved
by the Director" had he been/advised of the project (Harvey,
6/25/75, p. 69) and stated that he had thought the plots "were
completely authorized at every appropriate level within and ~
beyond the Agency". (Harvey | 7/11/75, p. 66) When asked why
McCone had not been given an opportunity to consider the plot,

Harvey replied:

One of the things that I don't know from
my own. . . knowledge . . . is who was briefed
in exactly what terms at the time of the so-
called Las Vegas flop that involved attempts to
place a technical surveillance . . . in Dan
Rowan's hotel room. (Harvey, 7/11/75, p. 46)

HW 50955 DocId:32423524 Page 92


Harvey was queried on whether the reasons he had given for not
briefing McCone were actually "reasons why he should [have been}
briefed forthwith". Harvey replied:

Well, Senator jHuddleston, it will be quite
easy in looking at lit’ now to say, well, I can
see your argument. ,

|

All I can say 'to you in answer is at that
time I didn't feeljthat it was necessary or
advisable. I did not make this decision except
in consultation, and had I been disagreed with,
that would have been it. And I am not off-
loading this on Richard Helms or attempting to
at all. It isn't all that ‘easy for me to go
back this many years and sort of recast all of
the reasoning and be sure I am accurate. And
I don't also want to evade it by saying, well,
it seemed like a good idea at the time. But
actually it did. |

) In other words, this was not something
that either Helms or’ myself felt that at that
stage there was any point in attempting to
brief the Director|}on it until, at least, we
had a somewhat better handle on it. :

The 1967 Report prepared by the Inspector General for
Helms states chat Harvey said: "When he briefed Helms on
Roselli, he obtained Helms' Approval not to brief the

Harvey stated that he did not tell McCone or the Special Group
about the operation at that time because:

also that he had felt ‘so strongly that he had, I believe,

In relation to the August/,10 meeting, Helms was asked whether
he believed McCone would have stopped an assassination attempt if
he had known. that one was underway. Helms stated:

Mr. Helms: "The reason I ‘say I don't know. . . is that
elsewhere Mr. McCone states that he went to see Mr. Mc-
Namara in connection with, this August 1962. affair and told
Mr. McNamara that he'woulldn't have anything to do with
this, that. I have no recollection that I don't believe he
ever said anything to me jabout his not wanting to have any-
thing to do with it. :

Q.: "And you were close to Mr. McCone in that period? You
are his Deputy for Plans?:

Mr. Helms: "I saw him almost daily.

Q.: “And is it your belief that if he had made any such
statement to Mr. McNamara that he would have come to you
and told you about it at|'some point?

Mr. Helms: "I just don't iknow why he didn't but I don't re-
call-any such statement.;, As I said, and I would like to
repeat it, Mr. McCone had given me my job, he had promoted
me, I felt close to him,|I felt loyal to him, and I would
not have violated an instruction he gave me if I could have
possibly helped it. '

"I may have deferred for a period of a few weeks giving
an actual order to terminate this as soon as possible,

O.: "But in any event, it [is your judgement that he did not
indicate that he was opposed to assassinations?

Mr. Helms: "Not to me.'
Walter Elder, who served .as McCone's Executive Assistant, testified,
however, that he had personally told Helms of McCone's opposition

to assassination after the August 10 meeting.*

(iv) The August 1963 Briefing of McCone

An August 16, 1963, Chicago Sun Times article claimed
that the CIA had had a connection with Giancana.**. McCone asked
Helms for a report about the atticle. McCone testified that when
Helms came to see him, he brought the following memorandum:

"1. Attached is the only ‘copy in the Agency of a memorandum
on subject, the ribbon copy of which was sent to the Attorney
General in May of 1962. Twas vaguely aware of the existence
of such a memorandum since: I was informed that it had been

written as a result of a briefing given by Colonel Edwards and

# Lawrence Houston to the‘Attorney General in May of last year.

and, in the absence of Mr!) Bannerman on leave, I was with Colo-
nel Edwards’ assistance able to locate this copy. As far as I

"I told Mr. Helms that Mr} McCone had expressed his feeling

: that assassination could not be condoned and would not
be approved. Furthermore! I conveyed Mr. McCone's statement
that it would be unthinkable to record in writing any consid-
eration of assassination because it left the impression that
the subject had received Serious consideration by governmental
policy makers, which it had not. Mr. Helms responded, ‘I un-
derstand’. The point is that I made Mr. Helms aware of the
strength of Mr. McCone's Opposition to assassination. I know
that-Mr. Helms could not have been under any misapprehension
about Mr. McCone's feelings after this conversation. (Elder

**The 8/16/63 Chicago Sun Times article states that "Justice
Department sources” believed that Giancana never did any spying
for the CIA, but pretended to go along with the Agency “in the
hopes that the Justice Department's drive to put him behind bars

might be slowed - or at least affected - by his ruse of coopera-
tion with another government ‘agency."

Mr. Elder: "No."

of Mr. McCone's being aware of any aspect of the
scheme to assassinate Castro using members of the
gambling syndicate." (I.G., p. 70).

(bv) The Question of Authorization Outside The Central Intelli-

gence Agency In The Eisenhower Administration.

1. Summary
As discussed in the preceding section, the evidence as to whether,
Allen Dulles, CIA Director during the Eisenhower Administration, was
informed of the Castro assassination operation is not clear.

Even assuming that Dulles was so informed, authorization outside
the CIA for a Castro assassination could, according to the testimony,

only have come from President Eisenhower, from someone speaking for him,

or from the Special Group.* At issue, therefore, is whether President

Eisenhower, his close aides, or the Special Group authorized or had knowledge

of the Castro assassination plots.

In addition to Bissell, we took considerable testimony from
President Eisenhower's principal start assistants, Gordon Gray (Special
Assistant for National Security Affairs and President Eisenhower's
representative on the Special Group); General Andrew Goodpaster (starr

Secretary to President Eisenhower with particular responsibility for

* With respect to then Vice President Nixon, Bissell testified--and he
was supported by the principal White House assistants and the documents-~
that Nixon was not significantly involved in Cuban matters generally at
the critical times. There is no evidence suggesting his knowledge of the
Uastro assassination effort during the period under review, significant

parts of which occurred during the Presidential campaign. (Bissell ‘

national security operational matters); John Eisenhower (Assistant Staff
Secretary and the President's son) and from Thomas Parrott (Secretary
to the Special Group and special assistant to Allen Dulles). In summary,
the evidence was:
(i) Bissell testified that he did not inform the Special Group

or President Eisenhower of the Castro assassination operation, and he
had no personal knowledge that Allen Dulles informed either President
Eisenhower or the Special Group. However, Bissell expressed the belief
that Allen Dulles would have advised President Eisenhower (but not the
Special Group) in a "circumlocutious” or “oplique" way. Bissell based
this "pure personal opinion" on his understanding of Dulles’ practice
with respect to other particularly sensitive covert operations. But

5 Bissell testified that Dulles. never told him that he had so advised
President Eisenhower regarding the Castro assassination operation, even
though Dulles had told Bissell when he had employed this "circumlocutious"

approach to the President on certain other occasions.

(ii) Gordon Gray testified that the Special Group never approved
a Castro assassination, and that President Eisenhower had charged the
Special Group with the responsibility of authorizing all important covert
operations. A review of the records of Special Group meetings shows that
a query concerning a plan to take "direct positive action" against Castro
at a Special: Group meeting caused Allen Dulles' Deputy, General Cabell,
‘to advise that such action.was beyond the CIA's capability. Gray,

Goodpaster and John Bisenhower all affirmed (i) that they did not believe

President Eisenhower would have considered such a matter in a private

meeting with Dulles, or indeed that President Eisenhower would have approved
a Castro assassination in any event, and (ii) that he would not have dis-
cussed such a matter without telling ‘them. They conclude, therefore, as a
matter of opinion, that President Eisenhower was never told, and testify,
as a matter of fact, that they never heard anything about any assassination
at any time.

(iii) In addition to the 1.G. Report (which found that the CIA could
not say that any assassination activity carried on during this period was
responsive to Administration pressure), the documentary evidence showed that
the subject of Castro's removal was discussed at two meetings of the National
Security Council and the Special Group. in March 1960. The minutes of these
meetings indicated that the discussions were in the context of a general con~
sideration of the proposal to train a Cuban exile force for an invasion of
Cuba and an assessment that Castro's overthrow might result in a Communist
takeover. Gray and Admiral Burke testified that the discussion of Castro's
removal at these meetings did not refer ‘to assassination, but rather: to the
problem of creating an anti-Castro exile force strong enough to insure a non-
Communist successor to. the Castro regime. In any event, no action was shown

to have stemmed from those meetings. An additional Spécial Group document
showed See ctaned a question regarding planning for "direct positive action"
against Cuban leaders was raised at a meeting in the Fall of 1960 (shortly
after Phase l-of the CIA/underworld assassination operation was initiated),

the Deputy Director of the CIA told the Special Group that such action was

beyond the CIA's capability.

ichard Bissell's Te:

(a) Lack of Personal Knowledge. Bissell testified that he knew
nothing of clearances outside the CIA for the Castro assassination effort.
(Bissell, 6/9, p. 30).. Indeed, Bissell met frequently with the Special
Group in the Fall of 1960 for the purpose of discussing Cuban operations,
but never informed the Special Group that there was a plot underway involving
use 6f underworld figures to assassinate Castro, (Bissell, 6/9, pp. 25-26);
nor did Bissell inform President Eisenhower or Vice President Nixon or any
other person outside the CIA (Bissell, 6/9, pp. 26-29). Bissell testified
that his reason for not doing so was that as Deputy Director of Plans, he
reported to the Director and under Agency procedures relied upon the Director
to inform the appropriate persons outside tha Agency. Thus, the question of
President Eisenhower's knowledge rests on whether Allen Dulles personally

informed him of the Castro plot.

(b) Assumptions Concerning Dulles. Based upon his belief that

Dulles had been briefed about the operation involving underworld figures
and understood that it involved assassination, Bissell assumed that Allen
Dulles would have sought authorization above the CIA level. As Bissell

testified:

"TI went on the assumption that, in a matter of this sensitivity,
the Director would handle higher level clearances. By clearance
I mean authorization."* (Bissell, 6/9, p. 26.) */

*Bissell reiterated this view on his second day of testimony: ". . . I
felt that the responsibility for obtaining necessary authorization should
remain with the Director." (Bissell, 6/11, p. 4) a

Bissell further stated that although he believed that Dulles
"probably" talked with President Eisenhower:
"the Mafia operation was not regarded as of enormous importance
and there were much more important matters to talk about with
the President." (Bissell, 7/17, p. 25.)
Bissell said he was "guessing" that Dulles informed Eisenhower.
(Bissell 7/17, pp. 38-39.) He said, however, that he based his assumption
on his knowledge of "command relationship, of Allen Dulles as an individual,
and of his [Dulles'] mode of operations". (Bissell, 6/11, p. 6.) As

Bissell explained, his guess that Dulles informed President Eisenhower "is

not based on hard evidence” but is "pure personal opinion". (Bissell,

Nee

~ 6/9, p. 61.) Nevertheless, he believed it to be so, and that the Presi-
dent thereupon gave his authorization "perhaps only tacitly". (Bissell,

6/11, p. 6.) As Bissell explained,

: "My guess is that indeed whoever informed him, that is Dulles
directly or Dulles through a staff member, would have had the
same desire. . . to shield the President and to shield him in
the sense of intimating or making clear_that something of the
sort was going forward, but giving the President as little in-
formation about it as possible, and the purpose of it would have
been to give the President an opportunity, if he so elected, to
cancel it, to order it cancelled, or to allow it to continue but
without, in effect, extracting from him an explicit endorsement
of the detailed specific plan." (Bissell, 6/9, p- 61)

HW 50955 DocId:32423524 Page 107


Bissell said circumlocution would have been used "to protect
the President" in-accord with the concept of "plausible deniability".*
As noted above, Bissell testified he had no personal knowledge
that Dulles informed President Eisenhower of the Castro plot. On other
specific occasions involving sensitive covert operations, Dulles had told
Bissell he had used the “circumlocutious" approach with President
Eisenhower. (Bissell, 6/11, p. 10.) But with respect to the Castro
assassination attempt, Dulles did not so.inform Bissell. (Bissell, 6/11,
p. 11.) As Bissell testified:
"T still want to be quite clear, I do not have a recollection of the
Director telling me that on this specific operation he had made

such an approach and received assent, approval, tacit or otherwise."
(Bissell, 6/11, p. 11.)

As to whether Dulles knew of the plots and informed Eisenhower, we
) have discussed above the fact that in January 1960 Dulles had told the Special
Group that the CIA "did not have in mind a quick elimination of Castro."
(Memorandum of Special Group meeting, January 13, 1960, pe). And.in July
1960 an instruction by Bissell's deputy to attempt to kill Raul Castro, which
“also stated that “possible removal of top three leaders is receiving serious
consideration at headquarters" had been countermanded. The CIA officer
who drafted this instruction testified that he hed heard at the time that

it was Dulles who countermanded this instruction and in doing so had "indicated

that assassination was not to be considered." (Hinkle, p. 29).

* Bissell explained the "plausible deniability" practice as follows:

"Any covert operations, but especially covert operations . . . that
if successful, would have very visible consequences, it was of course
an objective to carry out in such a way that they could be plausibly
disclaimed by the U.S. Government." (Bissell, 6/11, p. 5.)

Bissell apparently assumed that a corollary to that doctrine required the
use of "oblique", "circumlocutious" language.

(iii) White House Officials Denied Knowledge of Assassination

Efforts and Gave the Opinion that President Eisenhower Was Not Informed.

1. Gordon Gray. Gordon Gray served as President Eisenhower's
Special Assistant for National Security Affairs from July 1958 to the
pe ae an ree teers Administration on January 20, 1961. (Gray, p. 4.)
In this capacity, Gray served as the President's representative on the
Special Group. (Gray, p. 4.) President Eisenhower specifically instructed
Gray that all covert actions impinging on the sovereignty of another
country must be deliberated by the Special Group. (Gray, p. 6.) Gray
testified that during the period July 1958 to January 20,.1961, the
Special Group never approved an action to assassinate Castro (Gray, p. 6)
and no such suggestion was made by Bissell. (Gray, p. 37-)
Gray testified he did not.believe Allen Dulles would have
approached President Eisenhower without informing Gray: Gray stated:
"I find it very difficult to believe, and I do not believe, that
Mr. Dulles would have gone independently to him with such a

proposal without, for that matter, my knowing about it from Mr.
Dulles." (Gray, p. 35.)*

* Gray pointed out "that I was not with President Eisenhower twenty-
four hours a day. It was a few minutes every day, practically every day."
(Gray, p. 35.)

According to the records of the Eisenhower Library, Dulles was alone
with President Eisenhower on one occasion in the Fall of 1960. That
meeting lasted ten minutes on November 25, 1960. The record of the
previous portion of the meeting attended by Gray indicates only that, in
addition to discussion of operations in another country, "there was also
some discussion of Cuba". (Memorandum, November 28, 1960, by Gordon Gray,
of Meeting with the President, November 25, 1960 at 10:40 A.M.). We feel
compelled to state that the fact of this brief meeting, on the evidence
available, is of little, if any, significance or relevance.

VOP SECRET —

Gray further testified that his relationship with President
Eisenhower was such that President Eisenhower “would discuss with me any-
thing that came to his attention independently of me." (Gray, p. 7.)

And Gray testified that President Eisenhower never discussed with him the
subject’ of a Castro assassination or of the use of the underworld figures
and Cubans in such an effort. (Gray, p. 7.)

2. Andrew Goodpaster.. Goodpaster served as President Eisenhower's
Staff Secretary and Defense Liaison Officer during the last two years of
the Eisenhower Administration. (Goodpaster, p. 3.) In addition to responsi-
bility for the President's schedule and the supervision of the White House
staff, Goodpaster was responsible for handling with the President "all
matters of day to day operations" in the foreign affairs and national
security field, including the activities of the CIA and the Departments
of State and Defense. (Goodpaster, p. 3.) Goodpaster testified that he
had a."very close personal relationship" with President Eisenhower and
saw the President "essentially every day when [President Eisenhower] was
in Washington (Goodpaster, p. 4). Along with Gordon Gray, Goodpaster
served as the channel between the CIA and the President. Goodpaster was

- the particular channel for "operations in Which [President Eisenhower]
might take a personal part". (Goodpaster, p. 4.)

Goodpaster testified that he never heard any mention of assas-
ination efforts. (Goodpaster, p. 5.) He said that President Eisenhower
never told him about any assassination effort and that it was his belief,
under White House procedures and by virtue of his close relationship with
President Eisenhower, that if an assassination plan or operation had ever

been raised with the President, he would have learned of it. (Goodpaster,

TOP SEG

p. 5.)

HW 50955 Docld:32423524 Page 110


Beyond this General Goodpaster testified that he found Bissell's
assumption of a "circumlocutious" personal conversation between Dulles and
the President "completely unlikely".

_"That was simply not the President's way of doing business. He
had made it very clear to us how he wanted to handle matters of
this kind, and we had set up procedures to see that they were then
handled that way." (Goodpaster, pp. 6-7)

According to Goodpaster, after the collapse of the Paris Summit
Conference between President Eisenhower and Premier Khruschev as a result
of the U-2 incident in the Spring of 1960, the Fisenhower Administration
reviewed its procedures for approval of CIA Sperations and tightened then.
General Goodpaster testified that this review was carried out

“vith the aim in mind of being sure we had full and explicit under-
standing of any proposals that came to us and. we knew from
[President Eisenhower] that in doing that we were responsive to

} a desire on his part." (Goodpaster, p. 7.)

Secondly, according to Goodpaster, the relationship between
President Eisenhower and Allen Dulles-was quite different from that
between the President and John Foster Dulles. He said John Foster Dulles

was a confidant of the President while Allen Dulles was not. (Goodpaster,

p. 8.)

3. Thomas Parrott. Thomas Parrott, a CIA officer, served as
Secretary of the Special Group from 1957 through the end of. the Eisenhower
Administration (and thereafter until October 1963). (Parrott, p. 4.)
Parrott stated that, by virtue of this assignment, he functioned as Allen
Dulles' assistant in connection with the Special Group, knew Dulles well,

and gained an understanding of Dulles’ method of expression and his

HW 50955 Docld:32423524 Page 111


10

a practice for dealing with the President. (Parrott, pp. 13-1h.)*
Parrott testified that early in 1959, President Eisenhower
directed the Special Group to meet at least once a week to consider, approve,
or reject all significant covert action operations (Parrott, p. 4.)
Parrott testified it would have been "highly unlikely” for President
Eisenhower to have instructed the CIA to carry out a covert operation

without informing the Special Group. Parrott testified:

"as evidenced in his . . . revitalization . . . of this Committee
[the Special Group], [President Eisenhower was] highly conscious of.
the necessity to be protective . . . in this field, and I just

cannot conceive that [President Eisenhower] would have gone off and

mounted some kind of covert operation on his own. This certainly

would not have been consistent with President Eisenhower's staff

method of doing business . . . "**(Parrott, p. 7.)

4. John Eisenhower. John Eisenhower, President Eisenhower's

son, served in Goodpaster's office as Assistant Staff Secretary from mid-
1958 to the end of the Eisenhower Administration. (Eisenhower, pp. 5, 9)
He testified that his father had confided secret matters in him "to a very
large extent". (Eisenhower, p. 3.) For example, he said that after the

Potsdam Conference in July 1945, then Gen. Eisenhower told him that the

United States had developed the atomic bomb at a time when this was highly

* Parrott testified:

"T saw him [Allen Dulles] several times a week for hours at a time.
T had known him somewhat before . . . but I got to know him very
well indeed during these four years." (Parrétt, p. 13.)

®* Parrott further testified that Allen Dulles followed a practice of
insisting upon specific orders rather than "tacit approval" and he also
found Bissell's assumptions regarding a eircumlocutious conversation
between President Eisenhower and Allen Dulles "hard to believe!.

(Parrott, p. Lh.)

Ene coe

secret information. (Eisenhower,’p. 3.) And he said that-as early as

1956, President Eisenhower told him of the secret U-2 flights. (Eisenhower,
pe 4.)
i John Eisenhower testified, as a matter of fact, that President
Eisenhower never told him of any CIA activity involving an assassination

plan or attempt with respect to Castro. ‘(Bisenhower, p. 5.) Based on

his father's practice in other matters, it was his opinion that President
Eisenhower would have told him if the President had known of any such
activity. (Eisenhower, p. 5.) He further testified that President Eisenhower

did not deal with important subjects in a circumlocutious manner. (Eisenhower, p. 8.)

John Eisenhower further testified that it was his father's belief that
no leader was indispensable, and thus assassination was not an alternative
ae in the conduct of foreign policy. (Eisenhower, p. 14.)
(iv) The Documents

i. The Inspector General's Report

The document latest in date which bears oe the issue of
authorization for Phase I of the Castro assassination efforts is the 1967

- Inspector General's Report. In the concluding section of the Report to
Director Helms, the authors advanced several possible Agency responses to

Drew Pearson's public charges regarding CIAAinderworld links.* One of the

* On March 3, 1967, Drew Pearson stated in his newspaper column that
there was a U.S. "plot" to assassinate Castro, and that "one version
claims that underworld figures actually were recruited to carry out the
plot." (Pearson, Washington Merry Go-Round, March 3, 1967)

questions they asked was whether the Agency could say it was acting pur-
4 suant to Government policy -- or as they put the question: "Can CIA state
or imply that it was merely an instrument of policy?" The answer given
was:
"Not in this case. While it is true that Phase Two (the
attempt commencing in April 1962) was carried out in an
atmosphere of intense Kennedy Administration pressure to
do something about Castro, such is not true of the earlier
phase." (I.G., p. 132).
In addition to the I.G. Report, we examined the records of the National
Security Council and the Special Group, as well as other relevant White House
files bearing on the question of authorization for the period from
Castro's rise to power to the end of the Eisenhower Administration. As we
discuss below, three documents were found which contained references arguably

related to the subject. of assassination.

2. The Contemporaneous Documents

7 In March 1960, the National Security Council and the Special
Group focused on Cuban policy. President Eisenhower had just returned from
a foreign trip in which

"Latin American Presidents had counseled further forbearance

by the U.S. in the hope that the members of the Organization

of American States would finally see the potential danger in

Cuba and take concerted action." (Gray, Ex. 2, Memorandum of

March 10, 1960 NSC Meeting, p. 8). :

Castro was characterized as hostile, but his Communist ties were apparently
then unclear. Indeed, it may have been the prevailing opinion, at that time,
that Castro was not actually a Communist.* For it was stated in the minutes
of the March 10, 1960 NSC. meeting:

“there is no apparent alternative to the present government in

the event Castro disappears. Indeed the result of Castro's dis—
i appearance might be a Communist takeover." (Gray, Ex. 2, p. 7). =

* Castro apparently first announced publicly that he was a "Marxist-Lenist"

on December 2, 1961. (David Larson, Cuba Crisis of 1962, p. 30h). :

the general covert action plan against Cuba.*

Against this background of general discussions of Cuba, we con-
sidered certain remarks appearing in the eee ae a March 10, 1960 National
Security Council meeting and a March 14, 1960 Special Group meeting.

The record of the NSC meeting of March 10, 1960 (at which President
Eisenhower was present) states that Admiral Arleigh Burke, in commenting on
Allen Dulles' statement that the Cuba covert action plan was in preparation,
"suggested that any plan for the removal of Cuban leaders should be a package
deal, since many of the Cuban leaders around {astro were even worse than Castro."
(Gray Ex. 2, p. 9). And, according to the minutes of a Special Group meeting
on March 14, 1960 (which President Eisenhower did not attend) "there was a
general discussion as'to what would be the effect on the Cuban scene if Fidel
and Raul Castro and Che Guevara should disappear simultaneously." (Gray Ex. 3,

p. 2).

Admiral Burke, who served as Chief of Naval Operations from 1955 to

1961, stated in an affidavit** that although he did not have a specific recollec-
: tion of the March 10, 1960 meeting of the National Security Council, he had a

clear recollection of-the discussions of Cuba policy that took place in the

spring of 1960. (Burke affidavit, p. 1). Burke stated that the reference to

the suggestion by him at the March 10, 1960 meeting "clearly refers to the

* As Gray testified, this plan covered four areas: sabotage, economic sanc—
tions, propaganda, and training of a Cuban exile force for a possible invasion.
Gray stated that this plan had nothing to do with assassination. (Gray, 7/9/75,

general covert action plan reported by Allen Dulles at that meeting and to

the general consideration given at that time in the U. S. Government to
identify Cuban groups with which the U.S. might work to overthrow the Castro

regime." (Burke affidavit, p. 1). Burke stated:

"In this connection, it was my view that the U.S. must support
those Cuban groups who would have a sufficient power base among
the Cuban people, not merely to overthrow Castro, but to be
able to cope with and dismantle his organization as well. It
was my firm belief at the time that many people in Castro's
organization were Communist and that Castro was probably a
Communist. I therefore advocated that any effort to support
groups so as to achieve Castro's overthrow must focus, not
merely on the leaders at the top of the Castro regime, but on
the very strong organization that had been the key to Castro's
rise to power, and was the basis for hig power." (Burke affidavit,
p. 1-2).*

Burke stated further:

"The question of a Castro assassination never arose at the March 10,
i} 1960 NSC meeting or at any other meeting or discussion that I
7 attended or in which I participated. It is my firm conviction
based on five years of close association with President Eisenhower
during my service as Chief of Naval Operations, that President
Eisenhower would never have tolerated such a discussion,
or have permitted anyone to propose assassination, nor would he
have ever authorized, condoned, or permitted an assassination
attempt." (Burke affidavit; p. 2).

Gray testified that the discussion-at the March lo ana March 1h,
1960 meetings dealt with plans to overthrow the Castro government, rather than
to assassinate Castro himself.- He gaia that Admiral Burke's recorded comment
at the March 10, 1960 NSC meeting was part of a lengthy and general discussion
of the problem of Cuba. At the outset of that discussion, it was Under Secretary

of State Douglas Dillon who pointed

out that "the result of Castro's disappearance

might be a Communist takeover." (Gray Ex. 2, p. 73 Gray, p. 11). Ana

Admiral Burke's reference to a "package deal" for the removal of Cuban
leaders was in direct response to a comment by Allen Dulles recorded in
the minutes that "a plan to affect the situation in Cuba was being worked
on." (Gray Ex. 2, p. 9; Gray pp. 13-14). Gray said he believed that

Mr. Dulles "was certainly referring to" the Eisenhower Administration's
plan to train Cuban exiles for an invasion, rather than a targeted attempt

on Castro's life.*/ (Gray pp. 14, 45). Gray testified that viewing Admiral

Burke's remarks in context, he believed it was clear that "Admiral

*/ A CIA memorandum of an internal CIA meeting (Memorandum of First
Meeting of Branch 4 Task Force, March 9, 1960), shows that the first
meeting of the CIA task force establishgd to plan the training of a
Cuban exile force was held on March 9, 1960, the day before the March
10, 1960 NSC meeting. (Memorandum of First Meeting of Branch 4 Task
Force, March 9, 1960). At that March 9, 1960, CIA meeting, the CIA
task force discussed "an operation directed at the overthrow of the
Castro regime" and described that operation as one: in which a Cuban
exile force would be trained for "6-7 months." In the discussion of
this operation, it was noted that a principal problem was the weakness
of the Cuban exile groups which "had no real leader and are divided
into many parts,” but it was hoped that during the long training
period the “opposition groups will have been merged and will have formed
a government-in-exile to which all trained elements could be attached.”
(Id., p. 2).

According to the memorandum of the meeting,
chief of the CIA's Western Hemisphere division

J. C. King, had stated, "unless Fidel and Raul Castro and Che Guevara could

- be eliminated in onepackage ~- which is highly unlikely - this operation

HW 50955

can be a long, drawn-out affair and the present government will only be
overthrown by the use of force." (Id., p. 1).

Burke ... was expressing his opinion that if you have any plan [for the
overthrow of Castro/ it ought to take these factors into consideration, that
you might end up with a Communist government." (Gray, p- 45).

With respect to the March 14, 1960 Special Group meeting, Admiral
Burke stated that the "general discussion" referred to in the record of that
meeting 'tlearly did not involve a discussion of assassination of Cuban leaders,
put to the possible effécts should only those leaders be overthrown by a group
not powerful enough to also master the organization those leaders had established

in Cuba." (Burke affidavit, p. 2) Burke stated further:

"Thus, it was consistent with my views then that I should have
been recorded in the record of the March 14 meeting as warning
in this discussion that the Communists might move into control
even if these three top leaders should be overthrown. As stated
above, I strongly believed that a strong, organized group must
be in the forefront of any effort to overthrow the Castro
government." (Burke affidavit, p. 2).

In any event, when a question "whether any real planning had been

- done for taking direct positive action against Fidel, Raul and Che Guevara"

was subsequently asked. at a Special Group meeting on November 3, 1960, the

Deputy Director of the CIA, General Cabell, according to the record of that

meeting, pointed out

"that action of this kind is uncertain of results and highly
dangerous in conception and execution, because the instruments

must be Cubans. He felt that, particularly because of the
necessity for simultaneous action, it would have to be concluded
that (such action) is beyond our capabilities." (Gray Ex. 1, p. 3).

* The record of the March 14 meeting states: "Admiral Burke said that the
only organized group within Cuba today were the Communists and there was therefore
the danger they might move into control." (Gray Ex. 3, p. 2)

‘

HW 50955 DocId:32423524 Page 118


The reference to "direct positive action" is ambiguous and can
be subject to a number of different interpretations, including a L
question suggesting exploration of assassination.* However, it is clear
that at most a question was being asked. Moreover, assuming that "direct
positive action" meant killing, it is significant that shortly after assassi-
nation plots were begun, the CIA Deputy Director told the Special Group that

such action was "beyond our capabilities.”

* Testimony varied as to the meaning of the phrase "direct positive action"
and General Cabell's response in the November 3, 1960 memorandum.

Gray testified that the phrase "direct pasitive action" could be taken
to include assassination, but he did not know whether Mr. Merchant intended
to refer to assassination or not. (Gray, 7/9, p. 9).

Parrott, the author of the memorandum, testified that, although he had
no recollection of the November 3, 1960 meeting, it was his opinion, based
on the context of weekly Special Group meetings and discussion in the Fall of
1960, that this discussion centered on the possibility of a palace coup, as
opposed to a paramilitary operation mounted from outside Cuba; General Cabell
was indicating that "we simply do not have agents inside of Cuba to carry out
this kind" of a coup. (Parrott, pp. 19-21) Parrott also testified that the
phrase "direct positive action" was not a euphemism, and that he did not
employ euphemisms in Special Group records, except for references to the

President. (Parrott, pp. 19-21). We discuss in greater detail’at pp. i:
__ > and other ambiguous phrases in minutes and memoranda drafted by
Parrott. :

Bissell testified that he found it "difficult to understand" that General
Cabell would have told-the Special Group that-it was beyond the CIA's capa—
bilities to take "direct positive action" (if that referred to assassination)
in light of Bissell's assumption that General Cabell was informed of the CIA/
underworld assassination effort. (Bissell, 7/17, pp. 15-18).

Mr. Merchant was unable to testify because of ill health and orders of
his physician.

c. THE QUESTION OF AUTHORIZATION DURING THE KENNEDY ADMINISTRATION

The evidence on the issue of whether or not assassination plots were
authorized during the Kennedy Administration is divided herein into two
broad sections. The first primarily relates to the assassination operation
involving. underworld figures and occurring prior to the Bay of Pigs invasion
of April, 1961. The second section deals with the Post-Bay of Pigs period,
including the Roselli operation in the spring of .1962, Operation Mongoose, the
laboratory schemes in early 1963, and the AM/LASH plot in the fall of 1963.

(i) PRE-BAY-OF PIGS ASSASSINATION PLOTS

The pattern of testimony for this period was essentially the same

as for the Eisenhower Administration. Bissell, once again, said he assumed
and believed that Dulles had met with President Kennedy and informed him, in
a circumlocutious fashion, that the operation had been planned and was being

4 attempted. Bissell also testified that he (Bissell) did not inform the
President about the assassination efforts or any of the other non-CIA persons with
whom he was working on covert Cuban operations. The Kennedy Administration
officials all testified that they did not know about or authorize the plots.
Furthermore, they said they did not believe the President did or would authorize
an. assassination plot.

There were for this period no significant contemporaneous documents.

a. pears WAS oe aa SOE a HAD Eee ELL KENNEDY
IAS

When John F. Kennedy became President in January, 1961, Richard Bissell
was still Deputy Director for Plans and the principal agency official respon-
sible for the ongoing efforts against the Castro regime, including both the

Bay of Pigs operation and the assassination plots. Bissell is the only sur-

HW 50955 DocId:32423524 Page 121


Page 2
of viving CIA policy maker with first hand knowledge of high-level decision-

making in the early phases of the Castro assassination efforts. . Bissell
testified that he believed Allen Dulles had informed the President (although
Dulles did not so inform him) and that accordingly the plots had been approved
by the highest authority. Bissell was questioned about how he felt the. Pres-
ident would have been made aware of the plots:

"Senator Baker: ...You have no reason to think

that he [Dulles] didn't or he did [brief President

Kennedy]. But the question I put was whether or

not in the ordinary course of the operations of

the CIA as you know it under their traditions,

their rules and regulations, their policies as

you knew them what in your opinion -- [wJas the

President, President-elect briefed or was he in

the light of all these circumstances?

Bissell: I believe at some stage the President

and the President-elect both were advised that such

an operation had been planned and was being attempted.

en Senator Baker: By whom?

Bissell: I would guess through some channel by
Allen Dulles.

The Chairman: But you're guessing, aren't you?
Mr. Bissell: I am, Mr. Chairman, and I have ‘said that
I cannot recollect the giving of such briefing at
the meeting with the President-elect in November or
in any meeting with President Eisenhower." (6/9/75,
pp. 38-39). ce
Bissell's testimony varied with respect to the force with which he stated
his belief that the President had been informed. Once he referred to it as
“a pure personal opinion" (Bissell, 6/9/75, pp. 60-1); on another occasion he

testified as follows:

HW 50955 DocId:32423524 Page 122


Page 3

ie "Senator Morgan: Mr. Bissell, it's a serious
matter to attribute knowledge of this sort to
the President of the U.S., especially one who
cannot speak for himself. Is it fair to assume
that out of an abundance of caution you are simply
telling us that you have no knowledge unless you
are absolutely certain?...I gather that you think
..-it [assassination plot information] came out

- but because of the seriousness of the accusation

you are just being extremely cautious...is that
a fair assumption to make?

Bissell: That is very close to a fair assumption,
sir. It's just that I have no direct knowledge,
first-hand knowledge of his [President Kennedy's]
being advised, but my belief is that he knew of it
{assassination plans]."" (Bissell, 6/9, p. 56).

When asked why he had not himself informed White House officials or the
President of the assassination plots, Bissell said since Dulles was the DCI,
he "left the question of advising senior officials of the government and
obtaining clearances in Allen Dulles' hands" (Bissell, 6/9/75, pp. 29, 33).

As with President Eisenhower, Bissell said that, based upon his testimony

ae

that Dulles knew about the assassination plot, he "assumed" that Dulles

Panta "had at least intimated [to President Kennedy]
that some such thing was underway." (Bissell,
6/9/75, p. 33).*

* The Presidential logs. from the Kennedy: Administration indicate only one
meeting before the Bay of Pigs invasion at which the President and Allen Dulles
may have met privately. This meeting took place on March 25, 1961. (There is .
no record of the meeting. We feel compelled to state that the fact of this
meeting, on the evidence available, is of little, if any significance or
relevance.

HW 50955 Docld:32423524 Page 123


Page 4

Again as part of his "pure personal opinion'' (Bissell, 6/9/75, p. 60)
that this was done, Bissell speculated that Dulles would have engaged in a
“cixcumlocutious" sort of conversation. (Bissell, 6/11/75, p. 6), using
“rather general terms."

- Bissell repeatedly coupled Eisenhower and Kennedy together when he
speculated about the manner in which he felt the Presidents would have been
advised to maintain "plausible deniability." (Bissell, 6/9/75, pp. 38, 57;
6/11/75, pp. 5-6): ,

‘In the case of an operation of high sensitivity

of the sort that we are discussing, there was a
further objective that would have been pursued at
various levels, and that was specifically with
respect to the President, to protect the President.
And, therefore, the way in which I believe that
Allen Dulles would have attempted to .do- that was to
have indicated to the two successive Presidents the
general objective of the operation that was contem-
plated, to make that sufficiently clear so that the
President -- either President Eisenhower or President
Kennedy -- could have ordered the termination of the
operation, but to give the President just as little
information about it as possible beyond an under-
standing of its general purpose. Such an approach
to the President would have had as its purpose to
leave him in the position to deny knowledge of the
operation if it should surface,

"My belief -- a belief based, as’I have said, only to
me knowledge of command relationship of Allen Dulles
as an individual, and of his mode of operations -- is
that authorization was obtained by him in the manner
7 that I have indicated. I used the word on Monday
“circumlocutious ,"" and it was to this approach that I
_.referred.

“Assuming for the moment that I am correct, since the

effort would have been to minimize the possibility of
embarrassment to the President, it is, I think, under-
standable that neither I nor anyone else in the Agency ”
would have discussed this operation on our own initiative
with, for instance, members of the White House staff.

HW 50955 DocId:32423524 Page 194


Page 5

The effort would have been to hold to the

.absolute minimum the number of people who knew

that the President had been consulted, had been

notified and had given, perhaps only tacitly,

his authorization." (Bissell, 6/11/75, pp. 5-6).

However, Bissell testified that Dulles never told him he had briefed

President Kennedy and he did not recall asking Dulles. (Bissell, 6/9/75,
p. 34; 6/11/75, p. xx; 7/17/75, p. 27). .In contrast, Bissell testified that
on certain other occasions, Dulles had mentioned that a "circumlocutious"
approach had been used to brief President Eisenhower on sensitive subjects
(Bissell, 6/11/75, pp. 10-14). Bissell also said that he never asked to
what degree Dulles had advised McGeorge Bundy, Special Assistant to the
President for National Security Affairs, of the assassination plot. (Bissell,
6/9/75, p. 34).

b. BISSELL TESTIFIED HE DID NOT INFORM THE PRESIDENT OR WHITE HOUSE

OFFICIALS OF THE ONGOING ASSASSINATION PLOTS.

When asked if he had informed anyone outside’the CIA that an effort to
assassinate Fidel Castro was- underway, Bissell stated, "not to my recollection."
He added that he was not told that any Administration official had been made
aware of such efforts. (Bissell, 6/9/75, pp. 28-30).

After the change of Administration, McGeorge Bundy was the White House
official who was the liaison with Bissell eaicering Cuba and in general was
the principal White House official responsible for CIA matters (Bissell, 6/9/75,

- p. 16). Bundy was a former student of Bissell's at Yale and they were personal

friends (Bissell, 6/9/75, p. 28). Bissell testified that he did not tell Bundy
about the ongoing Castro assassination plots (Bissell, 6/9/75, pp. 28-29; 7/22,

p. 31), and Bundy confirmed this (Bundy, p. 41).

HW 50955 DocId:32423524 Page 125


Page 6

Cuban affairs during this period leading up to the Bay of Pigs received
active high-level attention. Bissell said that, in a continuation of the kind
of intense weekly scrutiny the Eisenhower Administration had given. the invasion
plans (Bissell, 6/9/75, p. 13).

'...almost from the beginning of the Kennedy
Administration, the President himslef and a
number of Cabinet members and other senior
: officials took a very active interest in the
/ operation(s) concerning Cuba." (Bissell, 6/9/75,
p- 16).
Bissell "almost invariably" was present at meetings in which the President
and other senior officials took an "active interest" in Cuba (Bissell, 6/9/75,
p. 17). Bissell, testified that he did not *nform any of them of the assassin-
ation plot. (Bissell, 6/9/75, p. 39).

c. KENNEDY ADMINISTRATION OFFICIALS bo KNOWLEDGE OF ASSASSINATION EFFORTS
1D OPINION TE ENT

Testimony was taken by the Committee from all living officials high in
the Kennedy Administration who dealt with Cuban affairs.* The theme of their
testimony -- which-is set forth in detail below -- was that they had no know-
ledge of any assassination plan or attempt by the U.S. government before or
after the Bay of Pigs invasion.

As with the Eisenhower Administration officials, members of the Kennedy
Administration also said they did not believe the President's character or
style of operating would be consistent with approval of such a matter.

: (McNamara, p.. 4; Bundy, p. 98; Taylor, pp. 45,51).

* Most of the testimony from officials high in the Kennedy Administration
dealt with the period after the Bay of Pigs invasion, involving Operation Mon-
goose arid related activities. (See Section jinfra.) It was during this period
that most of the high officials in the White House, Ise, State Department , Defense
Department, and the CIA were drawn into the detailed planning of Cuban Operations.
During this period, an extraordinary amount of decision making memoranda and

Lg other documents were generated in response to the Cuban situation.

HW 50955 Docld:32423524. Page 126


Page 7

Secretary of State Dean Rusk testified:

"T never had any reason to believe that anyone
that I ever talked to knew about had any active,
planning of assassination underway."" (Rusk,
pp. 65,49).

Likewise, Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara stated that he had "no
knowledge or information about.:.plans or preparations for a possible assass-
ination attempt against Premier Castro." (McNamara, pp. 7,4). [The question
of whether McNamara once raised the issue of assassinating Castro is discussed
at Section infra. |

Roswell Gilpatric, Deputy Secretary of Defense under McNamara, said that
killing Castro was not within the mandate o€ the Special Group which he con-
strued to be the weakening and undermining of "the Cuban system."' (Gilpatric,
p. 28).

This was supported by General Maxwell Taylor, who chaired Special Group
ey meetings on Operation Mongoose. Taylor stated that he had "never heard" of
the assassination effort against Castro (Taylor, pp. 72, 7-8). Taylor stated
that he never raised the question of assassination with anyone. (Taylor, p.
19). Moreover, Taylor testified that he was not aware of a directive for an
assassination effort from the President or the Attorney General, nor was he
aware of a proposal-for the assassination.of a foreign leader in any form by
anyone to the Special Group (Taylor, pp. 41,45,62).

McGeorge Bundy stated that it was his "conviction" that

"no one in the Kennedy Administration, in the

White House, or in the Capitol, ever gave any

eet authorization, approval, or instruction of any

kind for any effort to assassinate anyone by the
CIA." (Bundy, p. 54)

HW 50955 Docld:32423524 Page 127


Page 8

Furthermore, Bundy testified that he was never told by anyone at any time that
assassination efforts were being conducted against Castro (Bundy, p. 63).
Bundy said that Richard Bissell never informed him about CIA involvement in
assassination attempts against any foreign leader (Bundy, p. 41). Bundy
acknowledged, however, that he had once been briefed by Richard Bissell on
the development of an "executive action capability’ at the CIA (see Section

, infra) .*

Walt Rostow, who shared national security duties with Bundy before moving
to the Department of State, testified that during his entire tenure in govern-
ment he "never heard a reference" to an intention to undertake an assassination
effort (Rostow, pp. 10, 12-13, 38). a

Asked if he had ever been told anything about CIA efforts to assassinate
Castro, Richard Goodwin, Assistant Special Counsel to the President, replied,
oe "No, I never heard of such a thing." (Goodwin, p. 13)

* As indicated further below, Bundy also said (i) that the matter of a

Castro assassination was "mentioned from time to time ... as something to
an talk about rather than to consider." (Bundy, p: 73); and (ii) he had a "very
vague, essentially refreshed recollection" that at some time he had heard
about “'poison" in connection with a "possibility of action in Cuba" -- what
stuck in his mind was that it seemed "totally impractical because it was
going to kill a large number of people in a headquarters mess or something
- like that." (Bundy, pp. 42-43). Bundy stated flatly, however, that no

assassination plot was approved and that he was never informed about the
various plots. (Bundy, pp. 54, 63-64).

** As indicated below, Goodwin did on two occasions hear questions raised
about assassination. One involved the President, who said he was opposed
(see p. ) ); the other involved the meeting of August 10, 1962 (see pp.
to .

HW 50955 DocId:32423524 Page 128


Page 9

Presidential Assistant Theodore Sorensen said that his "first-hand
knowledge" of Cuban affairs was limited to the post-Bay of Pigs period
(Sorensen, p. 4), Sorensen stated, however, that his general opinion based
upon his close contact with President Kennedy, was that

"such an act [as assassination] was totally
foreign to his character and conscience,
foreign to his fundamental reverence for

human life and his respect for his adversaries,
foreign to his insistence upon a moral dimen-
sion in U.S. foreign policy to his pragmatic
recognition that so horrendous but inevitably
counterproductive a precedent committed by a
country whose own chief of state was inevitably
vulnerable could only provoke reprisals and in-
flame hostility.'! (Sorensen, p. 5).

Sorensen also said that President Kennedy "would not make major foreign
policy decisions alone without the knowledge or participation of one or more
of those senior foreign policy officials in whose judgment and discretion he
had confidence." (Sorensen, pp. 5-6).

Sorensen concluded his testimony by providing the Committee his judgment
on the following question:

"Q: Would you think it would be possible that ... the
Agency, the CIA could somehow have been under

the impression that they had a.tacit authorization

for assassination due to a circumspect discussion

that might have taken place in any of these

meetings? iat

Sorensen: It is possible, indeed, I think the
President on more than one occasion felt that Mr.
Dulles, by making rather vague and sweeping re-

5 ferences to particular countries was seeking tacit
approval without ever asking for it, and the Presi-
dent was rather concerned that he was not being

~* asked for explicit direction and was not being given
explicit information, so it is possible. But on
something of this kind, assassination, I would
doubt it very much. Either you are for it or you
are not for it, and he was not for it. " (Sorensen,

7/21/75, pp. 32-33.) : .

HW 50955 Docld:32423524 Page 129


Page 10

d. THE QUESTION OF WHETHER ASSASSINATION EFFORTS WERE DISCLOSED
IN VARIOUS BRIEFINGS. OF ADMINISTRATION OFFICTALS

(i) BRIEFING OF THE PRESIDENT-ELECT.

After the election, in the latter part of November, :1960, Dulles
and Bissell jointly briefed President-elect Kennedy on "'the most important
details with respect to the operation which became the Bay of Pigs." (Bissell,
6/9/75, p. 34).' Bissell testified that he did not believe the ongoing assass-
ination efforts were mentioned to the President-elect, and that to the best of
his recollection they were not. (Bissell, 6/9/75, pp. 27, 35-36). Bissell
surmised that the reasons he and Dulles did not tell Kennedy at that initial’
meeting were: (a) "apparently" they had not thought it was an important
matter*; and (b) they "would have thought that that was a matter.of which he
should be advised upon assuming office rather than in advance." (Bissell,
6/9/75, p. 35). The latter comment led to the following exchange:
) "The Chairman: Isn't it a strange distinction

that you draw that on the one hand (as) a Presi-

dential designate, as President-elect, he should

have all of the details concerning a planned in-

vasion of Cuba, but that he should not be told

about an ongoing attempt to assassinate Fidel

Castro?

Mr. Bissell: I think that in hindsight it could
be regarded as peculiar, yes.

"The Chairman: .+.(1)t just. seems too strange
that if you were charged with briefing the man who

ig * This was subsequently repeated by Bissell in response to examination of
his assumption that Dulles probably told President Eisenhower about the assass-
ination operation:

",.,.the Mafia operation was not regarded as of
enormous importance and there were much more
important matters to talk about with the
President." (Bissell, 7/17/75, p. 25).

HW 50955 Docld:32423524 Page 130


Page 11

was to become President of the U.S. on matters
so important as a planned invasion of a neigh-
boring country, and that if you knew at the
time in addition to the planned invasion there
° was an ongoing attempt to assassinate the leader
; of that country, that you would tell Mr. Kennedy
: about one matter and not the other.'''

Mr. Bissell: Well, Mr. Chairman, it is quite
possible that Mr. Dulles did say something about
an attempt to or the possibility of making use
of syndicate characters for this purpose. I do
not remember his doing so at that briefing. My
belief is that had he done so, he probably would
have done so in rather general terms and that
neither of us was in a position to go into detail
on the matter. " (Bissell, 6/9/75, p. 35).

However, Bissell also testified generally that pursuant to the doctrine of
plausible denial, efforts were made to keep matters that might be "embarrassing"
away from Presidents (Bissell, 6/11/75, pp. 5-6).

(ii) DISCUSSION WITH BUNDY ON "EXECUTIVE ACTION CAPABILITY"

As explained in the next section, sometime during the early period
of the Kennedy Administration, Bissell discussed with Bundy the subject of a
"capability" for "executive action" -- a term said by Bissell to include various
means of "eliminating the effectiveness" of foreign leaders up to and including
assassinations (Bissell, 7/22/75, p. 32).

There is some dispute concerning when this occurred and who initiated it,

and this subject is discussed at length at Section » infra.
Bissell and Bundy both testified, however, that Bissell did not tell Bundy --
a in the course of discussing the executive action capability or at any other
time -- of the actual assassination plots against Castro (Bissell, 7/22,
p. 31; Bundy, p. 41). (However, there was some testimony that the

names of Castro, Trujillo, and Lumumba might have been mentioned in connection

HW 50955 DocId:32423524 Page 131


Page 12

with the discussion of "research" into the capability. (Bissell, 6/11/75,
pp. 50-51)).
(iii) TAYLOR/KENNEDY BAY OF PIGS INQUIRY

Following the failure of the Bay of Pigs invasion, President Kennedy
convened a "board of inquiry" which reviewed "the causes:of... [the] failure"
of the operation (Bissell, 6/9/75, pp. 42,45). The members of the board were
Robert Kennedy, General Maxwell Taylor, Allen Dulles and Admiral Arleigh Burke.
The panel examined the Bay of Pigs failure for several weeks and issued its
report on June 13, 1961. The 'aylor Report" does not mention the assassination
plots.

Bissell was questioned extensively and appeared to General Taylor to have
been the principal person involved in the operation and much more knowledgeable
than Dulles who had deliberately kept himself out of the planning and delegated
responsibility to Bissell.- (Taylor, p. 73).

Bissell testified that he did not disclose to the Taylor/Kennedy Committee
that there had. been an assassination effort against Castro (Bissell, 6/9/75,

p. 42). He put forward several reasons for not having done so. First, "the
question was never asked.'' Second, he claimed Dulles already knew about the
operation. Third, Bissell said "by that time the assassination attempt had been
called off." Fourth, he contended that the. assassination effort was "not germane"
because it did not contribute to the failure of the Bay of Pigs. (Bissell,

- 6/9/75, pp. 44-46; 6/11/75, p. 39).

Bissell hastened to add that he had no reason to believe" that Allen Dulles,
himself a board member, did not discuss the plots with one or more members

(Bissell, 6/9/75, p. 46).

HW 50955 Docld:32423524 Page 132


Page 13

However, both General Taylor and Admiral Burke stated that neither
Bissell nor Dulles informed them of the assassination plots (Taylor, pp. 72-73;
Burke affidavit, 8/25/75, a 3).

When asked if Richard Bissell ever informed him that underworld figures
had been offered a large sum to assassinate Castro, General Taylor responded,
"No, I never heard that, and it amazes me" (Taylor, p. 72). Taylor said that
during his review of the Bay of Pigs operation no mention was made of an
assassination effort against Castro (Taylor, p. 72). Despite the fact that
Dulles met with Taylor on the Board of Inquiry thirty or forty times, Taylor
testified that Dulles never told him about the plot (Taylor, p. 73).

(iv) MEMORANDUM TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL

Bissell's testimony that he had not disclosed assassination plots to
the Kennedy/Taylor "court of inquiry" was consistent with his statement that
: "I have no knowledge that Robert Kennedy was
wf advised of this (the plot to kill Mr. Castro)."
(Bissell, 6/9/75, p. 41).
The Committee tested this statement against other parts of Bissell's
testimony. An attachment to the May 22, 1961 FBI. memorandum (regarding the
Las Vegas tap) which Director Hoover had sent to the Attorney General* had
quoted Edwards as saying that Bissell in "recent. briefings" of Taylor and
Kennedy ,
"told the Attorney General that some of the
associated planning included the use of
Giancana and the underworld against Castro."
(Bissell, 7/17/75, Ex. 3).

When first Shown this document, Bissell said,

* A handwritten note from the Attorney General to his assistant on the
face of the’ memorandum indicates that he had actually seen the: document? This
memorandum is discussed in detail at Section » infra.

HW 50955 Docld:32423524 Page 133


Page 14

"I have no recollection of briefing those
~ two gentlemen except as members of the Board
: of Inquiry that I have described, of which
Allen Dulles himself was a member."" (Bissell,
6/11/75, p. 27).
As mentioned above (Section (e), supra), Bissell testified that his briefings
to the Board of Inquiry did not deal with assassination efforts. (Bissell,
6/11/75, pp. 45-46).
Discussing the document in a subsequent appearance before the Committee,
’ Bissell again said that he had no recollection of any such conversation (Bissell,
7/22/75, p. 56) but he was sure that-it did not take place in front of the
Kermedy/Taylor board of inquiry (Bissell, 7/22/75, p. 64).
However, Bissell speculated, the report quoted language which "I might
very well have used, that is, the use of the undexworld against’ Castro."
(Bissell, 6/11/75, p. 21).

The examination of Bissell on whether he had had any such discussion and,

if so, why he used such obscure and indirect language, elicited the following
testimony:

"Q: Did you, sometime in May of 1961 commmicate
the state of your awareness to the Attorney General
in your briefing to him?

Bissell: Well, there is a report which I was shown,
ak it was last week, I believe it also came

from the FBI, but I could be wrong about that, or
indicating that I did, at that time in May, brief
the Attorney General, and I think General Taylor to
the effect that the Agency had been using -- I
don't know whether Giancana was mentioned by name,

- but in effect, the Underworld against the Castro
regime.

Q: Did you tell them -- them being the Attorney

General and General Taylor -- that this use included
actual attempts to assassinate Mr. Castro?"

Page 15

es "Bissell: I have no idea whether I did [.]
I have no idea of the wording. I think it
might quite possibly have been left in the
more general terms of. using the underworld
against the Castro regime, or the leadership
of the Castro regime.

Q. Mr. Bissell, given the state of your
knowledge at that time, wouldn't that have been
deliberately misleading information?

Bissell: I don't think it would have been.
We.were indeed doing precisely that. We were
trying to use elements of the underworld
against Castro and the Cuban leadership.

Q. But you had information, didn't you, that
you were, in fact, trying to kill him?

Bissell: I think that is a Way of using these
people against him. :

Q. That's incredible. You're saying that in
briefing the Attorney General you are telling
him you are using the underworld against Castro,
and you intended that to-mean, Mr. Attorney

" General, we are trying to kill him?

Bissell: I thought it signalled just exactly
that to the Attorney General, I'm sure.

Q. Then it's your belief that you commmicated
to the Attorney General that you were, in fact,
trying to kill Castro?

Bissell: I think it is best to rest on that
Yeport_we do have, which is from a source over
which I had no influence and it does use the
phrase I have quoted here. Now you can surmise
and I can summise as to just whattthe Attorney
General would have read into that phrase."
(Bissell, 7/22/75, pp. 53-54) .

Bissell then. testified:

HW 50955 DocId:32423524 Page 135


tage au

"Q. Was it your intent to circumlocuticusly

or otherwise, to advise the Attorney General

that you were in the process of trying to kill

Castro?

Mr. Bissell: [U]nless I remembered the con-

versation at the time, which I don't, I don't

have any recollection as to whether that was

my intent or not." (Bissell, 7/22/75, p. 56).

. Bissell proceeded to speculate that a "proper" briefing might not

have included any reference to the assassination plot. (Bissell, 7/22/75,
p. 59). He gave two reasons for this: speculation: (i) even if he had
“thoroughly briefed" the Attorney General he would have chosen "circumlocutious"
language to tell him about the activity involving Giancana. (Bissell, 7/22/75,
pp. 53-56); and (ii) the assassination effort had been "stood down by then."'
(Bissell, 7/22/75, p. 59). Bissell concluded by reiterating that he had "no
knowledge” that the Attorney General was "specifically advised" of the

assassination plot against Castro (Bissell, 7/22/75, p. 62) .*

‘ y e. QONVERSATION BETWEEN PRESIDENT KENNEDY AND GEORGE SMATHERS
George Smathers, former U.S. Senator fram Florida, testified that the
subject of the possible assassination of Castro arose in a conversation between

Smathers and President Kermedy on the White House lawn in 1961.** Smathers

* If the FBI quotation of Edwards is to be accorded significant weight, then
it is important to note that another section of it contradicts Bissell's assump-
tion that Presidents Eisenhower and Kennedy had been circumlocutiously advised
by Dulles of the assassination plot. Edwards told the FBI that "Allen Dulles was
completely unaware of Edwards’ contact with Maheu' in connection with Cuban opera-
tions.

Bissell's explanation for Edwards' statement was that Edwards was being "pro-
tective"’ of the DCI. (Bissell, 7/17/75, p. 20). But this testimony mist be
reconciled with Bisséll's previous testimony ‘that Dulles knew of the operation and
probably would have told the President about it,

** Smathers' testimony about this conversation referred to the transcript of
an Oral HIstory interview, conducted on March 31, 1964, in which his testimony was
based gives an indication that the conversation transpired in 1961, before the
Bay of Pigs invasion in mid-April.

au It appears from the White House logs of Presidential meetings that there were
only two occasions in 1961 when Senator Smathers ‘met with the President alone for
as much as twenty minutes. Both of those meetings took place in March. (Supra,

p. oe

Page 17

said he discussed the general Cuban situation with the President many times
(Smathers, p. 6). Smathers had many Cuban ‘constituents, was familiar with
Latin American affairs, and was a long-time friend of the President (Smathers ,
p. 6).

_ Smathers had the "impression" that the President raised the subject of
assassination with him because someone "had apparently discussed this and
other possibilities with respect to Cuba" with the President (Smathers, pp.
16, 25). Smathers had no direct knowledge of any such discussion, nor did he
know who might have been involved (Smathers, pp. 18-19, 25). The-President

did not indicate directly that assassination had been proposed to him: (Smathers,

p. 18).
According to Smathers:

".,. [President Kennedy] asked me what reaction

I thought there would be throughout South
America were Fidel Castro to be assassinated...

I told the President that even as much as I dis-
liked Fidel Castro that I did not-think it would
be a good idea for there to be even considered
an assassination of Fidel Castro, and the Pres-
ident of the United States completely agreed with
me, that it would be a very unwise thing to do,
the reason obviously being that.no matter who did
it and no matter how it was done and no matter
what, that the United States would receive full
credit for it, and the President receive full
credit for it, and it would-work to his great
disadvantage with all of the other countries in
Central and South America...I disapproved of it,
and he completely disapproved of the idea."
(Smathers, p. 22).

Smathers further testified that he had said the reason it would work to "great -
disadvantagé" with the nations of Central and South America was because they would

blame the United States for any assassination of Castro (Smathers, p. 6).

HW 50955 DocId:32423524 Page 137


Page 18

Smathers said that on a later occasion he tried to raise the subject
of "Cuba and what could be done'' with President Kennedy (Smathers, p. 22).
The President made it clear to Smathers that he should not raise the subject
with him again.*

Senator Smathers concluded his testimony by indicating that on Cuban
affairs in general, he felt he was "taking a tougher stance than was the
President'"' (Smathers, p. 24). But Smathers said that he disapproved of even
thinking about assassinating Castro and said he was "positive'' that Kennedy
also opposed it (Smathers, p. 16).

_ * One night at dinner with Senator Smathers, the President emphasized
his point by cracking his plate at the mention of Cuba. (Smathers, p. 22).

(iii) Kennedy Administration -~ The Question of Authorization Outside the
Agency During the Post Bay of Pigs, Mongoose, and 1963 Periods

«This section discusses the question of authorization outside the Agency
for the assassination plots during 1962 and 1963 -- the period of Operation

Mongoose (the 1962 Kennedy Administration program aimed at overthrowing Castro

by an internal revolt), the Missile Crisis in the fall of 1962, and the subse-

quent program in 1963 which saw a more limited covert action program directed ai

against Cuba.

A. Recap of the Assassination Activity After the Bay of Pigs

During 1962 and 1963 there were three principal assassination plots.

1. In the spring of 1962, William Harvey reactivated the contact

with John Roselli and in April provided lethal pills and guns to Roselli and

Cuban associates in Miami. In May it was reported that the pills reached Cuba. aa
2. In early 1963, the science fiction schemes -- exploding sea shell

and poisoned diving suit -- were contrived and then abandoned.
3. In November 1963 the dissident Cuban who was code-named AMLASH

was given a poison pen device.

B. The Issue of Authority,

The fundamental issue dealt with in this section is whether the above
assassination plots were authorized outside the Agency. The issue arises from
the differing perceptions of Helms and his subordinates, on the one hand,

and members of the Kennedv Administration, including the Director of the

CIA, on the other hand.

While Helms stated that he never received a direct order to assassinate
Castro, Helms testified that he fully believed that the CIA was at all times acting
within the scope of its authority and that he believed a Castro assassination came
within the bounds of the Kennedy Administration's effort to overthrow Castro and his

regime. Helms stated that he never informed M§To!

eerey eet

Administration of the assassination plots. On the other hand, McCone and the sur-
viving members of the Kennedy Administration testified that they did not believe
a Castro assassination was permissible without a direct order, that assassination
was not within the parameters of the Administration's anti-Castro program, and

testified that to their knowledge no ch direct order was given to Helms.

Before setting out the testimony in detail, we discuss below the Kennedy
Administration's 1962 covert action program, Operation Mongoose (as well as the = a.
events in 1961 leading to that program) which was designed to overthrow the Castro
regime. An understanding of that program is essential to an evaluation of the testi-

mony on the issue of authorization.

Cc. Events From the Bay of Pigs to the Establishment of Mongoose

1. The Taylor Review

On April 22, 1961, following the Bay of Pigs failure, the President requested.
General Maxwell Taylor to conduct a re-evaluation of “our practices and pro-
yrams in the areas of military and paramilitary, guerilla and anti-guerilla
activity which fall short of outright war." The President hoped that Taylor

would give special attention to Cuba. (Letter to Maxwell Taylor, April 22,
e
1961) Robert Kennedy was to be Taylor's principal colleague in this effort.

The resulting review of the U.S. policy in this area concluded:

"We have been struck with the general feeling. that there can be no
long-term living with Castro as a neighbor. His continued presence
within the hemispheric community as a dangerously effective exponent
of Communism and Anti-Americanism constitutes a real menace capable
of eventually overthrowing the elected governments in any one or more
of weak Latin American republics.

sek ;
"It is recommended that the Cuban situation be reappraised in the light
of all presently known factors and new guidance be provided for political,

military, economic and propaganda action against Castro." (Report to
the President, June 13, 1961, memorandum No. 4, p. 8)

HW 50955 DocId:32423524 Page 143


It is clear from the record, moreover, that the defeat at the Bay of Pigs
had been regarded as a humiliation for the President personally and for the CIA
institutionally.

By July the Special Group had agreed that the basic objective "is to provide
support to a U. S. program to develop opposition to Castro and to help bring about
a regime acceptable to the U. S." (Memo for the Record, July 21, 161.) Occasional
harrassment operations were mounted during the summer but there was neither over-
all strategy nor much activify.

2. ational Security Action Memorandum 100 of October 5, 1961, and the

CIA Intelligence

The documentary evidence and testimony indicate that in the fall of 1961
the question of the effect of Castro's removal from power and the prospects in
that event, for U. S. military intervention were considered by the Kennedy Admini-
stration.

Two studies were prepared in this connection. Pursuant to Hational Security
Action Memorandum 100 ("NSAM 190"), the State Department was asked to assess the
potential courses of action open to the U. $. should Castro be removed from the
Cuban scene, and to prepare a contingency plan with the Department of Defense
for military intervention in that event. The CIA, prepared an "Intelligence
Estimate" on the "situation and prospects" in Cuba. As discussed below, the :

aeneey
evidence indicates that the focus of these studies was on the possible cours! é

of action open to the U. 5. in a post-Castro Cuba, rather eben out

Om:

might bring about Castro's removal. However, it a ee t
e
o

was not excluded from the potential means by which C: t be removed.

NAM 100 .

On October 5, 1961, Bundy issued National Security Action Memorandum No.
100 ("HSAM 100") (Bundy, Ex 3).entitled "Contingency Planning for Cuba", HSAH

109 vas addressed to the Secretary of State stated in full: "In confirmation of

HW 50955 DocId:32423524 Page 144


oral instructions conveyed to Assistant Secretary of State Woodward*, a plan is
desired for tie indicated contingency."

“Related documents indicate that the subject matter of the contingency
referred to in NSAM 100 was the "possible removal of Castro from the Cuban scene".

(Bundy Ex 3A, Minutes of Special Group Meeting, October 6, 1261, p. 1.)

The Minutes of the Special Group meeting on October 6, 1961, (the day after

the issuance of NSAM 100) state that the Group was told that in addition to an overall
plan for Cuban covert operations," a contingency plan in connection with the pos~
sible removal of Castro from the Cuban scene" was in preparation. (Bundy, Ex 3A,
Memorandum for the Record of Special Group meeting, October 6, 1961, p. 1.)

In addition, a Memorandun for the Record by Parrott on October 5, 1961, |
states that Parrott informed Assistant Secretary Woodward's Deputy that "what was
wanted was a plan against the contingency that Castro would in some way or other |
be removed from the Cuban scene", (Bundy, Ex 3B, p. 1.) Parrott's memorandum
further stated that in preparing the plan, “the presence and positions of Raul
(Castro) and Che Guevara must be taken into account", and that General Taylor had

told Parrott he preferred "the President's interest in the matter not be mentioned"

toto Woodward. (Bundy, Ex 3B.) Parrott's memorandum also stated that "on they

covert side, I talked to Tracy barnes in CIA and asked that an up-to-date:report~
: Corea
be furnished as soon as possible on what is going on and khath is'being planned".

(Bundy, Ex 3B, p. 1.)

*Woodward at that time was Assistant Secretary of State for Latin American Affairs.

Docld:32423524 Page 145



ee

Bundy further contended that the President was not considering an assassina-

tion, but rather "what are things going to be like after Castro." (Bundy, p. 81.)*

~ Taylor's Testimony
Taylor testified that he had no recollection of NSAM 100 of the events de-

scribed in the related documents set out above. (Taylor, p. 18.) On the basis of

his review of the documents, Taylor testified that "it sounds like purely a political
ee

consideration of the sequence of power in Cuba." Taylor emphasized, moreover,

that"never at any time" did he raise the question of of assassination with Parrott,

or with anybody else. (Taylor, p. 19) -

Parrott's Testimony 7

Parrott, the Special Group Secretary who transmitted the request for the

NSAM 100 study to the State Department, testified that the request for a plan re- >

flected in his memorandum of October 5, 1961, and the reference in that memorandum
to the "contingency that Castro would in some way or another be removed from the
Cuban scene" (described above, p. 18), reflected interest in a contingency study

for Castro's removal, but by means "short of being killed." (Parrott, p. 83)

*Thus, with respect to the desire not to indicate the President's interest in
the plan requested from the State Department, Bundy testified:

"...it was precisely to insulate the President from any false in-
ference that what he was asking about was assassination. It is easy
to confuse the question, what are things going to be like after
Castro, with the other question, and we were trying to focus atten-
tion on the information he obviously wanted, which is, what would
happen if we did do this sort of thing, and not get one into the
frame of mind of thinking that he was considering doing it." -
(Bundy, p. 81)

**Taylor said he was puzzled by the wording of NSAM 100 and the related documents
and stated, "I just cannot tie in the language here with a plausible explanation."
(Taylor, p. 18)

HW 50955 DocId:32423524 Page 146


The CIA's Intelligence Estimate

Yhe CIA study in connection with the consideration of Castro's oval

was an intelligence estimate prepared by the CIA's Board of Rational listimates

(which was not part of the CIA's covert action directorate), entitled "The Situation

and Prospects in Cuba’ The CIA Estimate was pessimistic regarding the chances
for success of a Cuban internal revolt, and further found that a Castro assassina~
tion would likely strengthen the Communist position in Cuba.

After a general review of the economic, military, and political situation
in Cuba, the CIA estimate concluded tnat the Castro regime had sufficient popular
and repressive capabilities to cope with any internal thréat. The concluding
paragraph of the estimate was entitled "If Castrqwere to Die". It noted that:

"iis (Cestro's) loss now, by assassination or by natural

causes, vould have an unsettling effect, but would almost

certainly not prove fatal to the regime...(I)ts principal

surviving leaders would probably rally together in the er

face of a common danger." (Estimate, p. 9.)

The CIA study further predicted that should Castro die, “some sort of power struggle

would almost certainly develop eventually,” but that wh

ever the outcome of auch,

ic

e

a struggle, the Communist Party's influence would be "s

(Estimate, p. 9.)

‘fhe IG Report apparently refers to an earlier draft of this intelligence estimate.
(IG, p. 4.) The IG Report, in reporting that many CIA officers interviewed in the
IG investigation stressed the point that “elimination of the dominant figures in a

government. the

-will not necessarily caus ownfall of the government," stated:
“This point was stressed with respect to Castro and Cuba in an internal CIA

- draft paper of October 1961, which was initiated in response to General fax-
well Taylor's desire for a contingency plan. ‘he paper took the position
that the demise of del Castro, from whateve se, would offer little op-
portunity for the liberation of Cuba from Communist and Soviet Sloc control."
(IG, p. 4.) The CIA was unable to locate the draft paper referred to in the
IG Report.

**A cover memorandum by Lansdale transmitting the CIA estimate to Robert Kennedy
stated that the estimate “seems to be the major evidence to be used to oppose

your program" (referring to the proposed overall Mongoose operation). Lansdale's
memorandum criticized the estimate's assessment that “it is highly improbable that
an extensive popular uprising could be fomented" against Castro as a “conclusion
of fact quite outside the area of intelligence." (Lansdale Memorandum to Robert
Kennedy, 11/62, p.1) As discussed in detail at pp. _ below, Lansdale's basic
concept for the Mongoose program was to overthrow Castro through an internal revolt

3. Testimony of Szulc on President Kennedy's November 9, 1961 Question
Regarding a Possible Castro Assassination

Ape
whic

Tad Szulc* testified that in a private meeting he had with President Kennedy

on Novebmer 9, 1961, the President asked"Szulc what would you think if I ordered
Castro to be assassinated," and said "I agree with you completely" when
Szulc answered that a Castro assassination should be ruled out on both practical

and moral grounds. Szule further testified that President Kennedy “went on "to

make the point how strongly he and his brother felt that the United States for moral

reasons" must not be involved in assassinations. (Szulc, p.27).

In early November 1961 Szulc was asked by Richard Goodwin, the Special Assistant

to President Kennedy, to meet’ with Attorney General Robert Kennedy on iovember 8,

1961, to discuss the situation in Cuba. The meeting was an “off-the-record" one
which Szule attended as a friend of Goodwin's and not as a reporter. (Szulc,
p- 24.) During the mecting with Robert Kennedy, the discussion centered on "the
situation in Cuba following the (Bay of Pigs) invasion (and) the pros and cons
of some different possible actions by the U. S. in that context" (Szulc, p. 25).
The subject of assassination was not mentioned during this meeting. (Szulc, p.

31.) . : '

*In November 1961 Tad Szule was employed as a reporter in the Washington Bureau
of the New York Times (Szulc, p. 24). Szule had visited Cuba in May-June 1961,
following the Bay of Pigs invasion. (Szulc, p. 24) During the course of that
trip, Szule had a "series of very long conversations with Castro". (Szule, p.
24.)

HW 50955 Docld:32423524 Page 148

At the close of the meeting, Robert Kennedy asked Szulc to meet
with President Kennedy the following day (Szule, p. 25). On November 9,
1961, Szule, accompanied only by Goodwin, met with President Kennedy
for over an hour in the Oval Office.*. (Szulc, 6/10, p. 25.) Szule
recalled that the President discussed "a number of his views on Cuba
in the wake of the Bay of Pigs, asked me a number of questions concerning
my conversations with Premier Castro, and...what the United States could
for? might do in...either a hostile way or in establishing some kind of

a dialogue..." (Szulc, 6/10, pp. 25-26).

Szulc testified that after this general discussion, the President

then asked "what would you think if I ordered Castro to be assassinated.*/*/

(Szulc, 6/10, p. 26; Szulc Notes of conversation with President Kennedy, »:
EM ye :
November 9, 1961). Szule testified that he replfed:that an assassination

would not necessarily cause a change in the Cuban system, and that it was

Szulc's personal view that the United States should not be party to murders

and political assassinations. (Szulc, 6/10, p. 26). Szule testified that

, oR */Goodwin testified that President Kennedy met frequently with members of
ttl the press and others who were experts in their fields, but that it was "possible"
~ that the meeting with Szulc may have been an occasion for the President to con-

sider Szule for a position in the Administration (Goodwin, p. 29-30).
On November 2, 1961 Goodwin had» addressed an "eyes only" memorandum to the

thereupon the President said, "I agree with you completely." Szule stated

further:

"He /President Kennedy/ then went on for a few minutes

to make the point how strongly he and his brother felt

that the United States for moral reasons should never be

in a situation of having recourse to assassination." (Szule, p.27).

Szulc's notes of the meeting with the President state:

“JFK then said he was testing me, that he felt oe same
way -~ he added ‘I'm glad you feel the same way' --
because indeed U.S. morally must not be part /sic/ to
assassinations.'\- — -

Szulc's notes of the conversation further state:

“JFK said he raised question because he was under

terrific pressure from advisers (think he said intel-

ligence people, but not positive) to okay a Castro

murder. sed /sic/ he was resisting pressures." (Szulc i
note of conversation with President Kennedy, November

9, 1961).

Szule stated, relying on his memory, that it is. "possible"
and he "believed" that President Kennedy used such words as "someone in the
intelligence business," as the source of the pressure for a Castro assassina-
tion.. (Szulc, 6/10, p. 29). The President did not identify the person or

persons. (Szulc, 6/19, p. 27). | : :
If anyone was in fact putting pressure on the President, there was no

other evidence on this point adduced before the Committee. This was particularly

troublesome since everyone questioned by the Committee, both within and without

the CIA,denied ever having discussed assassination with the President, let

alone having pressured him.

Testimony of Goodwin .

Goodwin attended the November 9, 1961 meeting between President

Kennedy and Szulc. (Goodwin, p. 3). Goodwin testified that, after asking

Szule for his reaction to a suggestion that Castro be assassinated,

"

President Kennedy said "well, that's the kind of thing I'm never going to do.

(Goodwin, p. 3).

Goodwin testified further ‘that several days after the meeting «iti
Szule, Goodwin referred to the mention of assassination to Sculc, and Tresident
Keanedy said only “we can't get into that kind of thing, or we would all be
targets". (Goodwin, p. 4, 11.)

4. The Rejection of Assassination in President Kennedy's November 16,

1961 Speech fa

A few days after the meeting with Szule and Goodwin, and some six

weeks after the issuance of NSAM 100, President Kennedy delivered a speech at

the University of Washington. In that public address, President Kennedy stated:

"We cannot, as a free nation, compete with our adver-
saries in tactics of terror, assassination, false

_ promises, counterfeit mobs and crises." (Public Papers
of the Presidents, John F. Kennedy, 1961, p. 724)

We discuss in the next section the nature of the program which was initiated
against the Castro regime at the end of November 1961 pursuant to President

Kennedy's instruction, and which continued to the Missile Crisis in the fall of

1962.

D. Operation Mongoose

1. The Creation of Operation Mongoose. In November 1962 the

proposal for a major covert program to overthrow Castro was developed.
Richard Goodwin, a special assistant to President Kennedy, and Edward
Lansdale, a military officer. with experience in counter-insurgency
operations, played major staff roles in the creation of Mongoose. Both
Goodwin and Lansdale worked closely with Robert Kennedy, who took an a
active interest in this preparatory stage and in the later conduct of
Mongoose. On November 1, 1961, Goodwin advised the President that |
Robert Kennedy "would be the aie effective commander of the proposed
operation. (Memorandum to the President, November 1, 1961, p. es |
Lansdale, in a memorandum to Robert Kennedy on ue 15, 1961, out-
lining the Mongoose proposal, stated that a "picture of the situation Be =
has' emerged clearly enough to indicate what needs to be done and to
support your sense of urgency concerning Cuba". (Memorandum, November 15,
1961, p. )
At the end of the month, on November 30, 1962, President Kennedy
issued a memorandum recording his decision to begin thé Mongoose project--

to "use our available assets . . . to help Cuba overthrow the Communist

regime". (Lansdale Ex. 17, Memorandum to the Secretary of ‘State,
meat iT
Defense, et al., November 30, 1961). : 4 (haa
de
ae Important organizational changes were made in establishing Operation
MONGOOSE.
a. The Special Group Augmented. A new control group, the Special

Group Augmented, was put in charge’of Operation MONGOOSE. The SGA con-

sisted of the regulary Special Group (i.e., Bundy, Johnson of State,

HW 50955 DocId:32423524 Page 152


Gilpatric of Defense, McCone of CIA, and Gen. Lemnitzer of the Joint
Chiefs) plus Robert Kennedy and General Taylor. Also, Secretaries
Rusk and McNamara’ more frequently attended its meetings than they did

those of the Special Group itself.

b. General Lansdale as the Chief of Operations of MONGOOSE.
General Edward Lansdale was named the Chief of Operations of the MONGOOSE
activities by President Kennedy. Lansdale had developed a reputation in
the Philippines and Vietnam for having an ability to deal with revolu-
tionary insurgencies in less developed countries. In addition, as a

result of the Bay of Pigs failure, President Kennedy distrusted the CIA

and believed he required someone fron uesiae the Agency to oversee #
major covert action programs. Rather than appoint Robert Kennedy to

head Mongoose as proposed by Goodwin, President Kennedy gave Lansdale poe

the task of coordinating the CIA's Mongoose operations with those of the
Departments of State and Defense, and-made General Taylor the Chairman

of the Special Group Augmented. However, Robert Kennedy did play an active
role in the Mongoose structure, unrelated to his position as Attorney General.

c. CIA Organization for Mongoose. In late 1961 or early 1962, William

Harvey was put in charge of the CIA's Task Force !, the CIA arm for, Hongoose
Operations. Task Force W operated under the Special Group Augmented and em-

ployed some 400 people’at CIA headquarters and at the Miami Station. McCone

and Warvey were thereafter the principal CIA participants in Operation

Helms attended only some 7 of 40 Mongoose mm;

2. Lansdale's Theory and Objective for Mongoose

In the fall of 1961, Lansdale had been asked by President
Kennedy to examine the Administration's Cuba policy and to make recommen-
dations. Lansdale testified that, in reporting his recommendations to
President Kennedy, he emphasized that "Castro ... had aroused con-
siderable affection for himself personally with the Cuban population...."
(Lansdale, p. 4), and that the U.S. "should take a very different course"
from the "harassment" operations that had been directed against Castro
up to that time. (Lansdale, p. 3). These prior U.S. operations were
conceived and led by Americans, Lansdale informed the President. (Lans~
dale, p. 5).. In contrast, Lansdale proposed that the U.S. work with
all exiles, particularly professionals who had opposed Batista and then ~ - |
became. disillusioned by Castro. (Lansdale, ee 4, 10-11).  Lansdale's
ultimate objective was to have "the people themselves overthrow the a
Castro regime rather than U.S. engineered efforts from outside Cuba."
*
(Lansdale, p. 4a).
Hence, after his appointment’ as Chicf of Operations, Lansdale's
concept for the MONGOOSE project emphasized as a first step the develop-
ment of leadership elements, and "a very necessary political basis"

among the Cubans opposed to Castro, before any large actions began.

(Lansdale, p. 11). At the same time, Lansdale sought to develop "means

to infiltrate Cuba successfully" and to organize "cells, al daactititie
wae Fal RNY

mA
inside Cuba ... who could work secretly and safely. "8 (Lan
at AE

Lansdale's plan was designed so as not to "arouse premature actions, not

to bring great reprisals on the people, and abort any eventual success."

(Lansdale, p. 11).

—/ As Lansdale described his "concept of operation" for Mongoose in a
memorandum to the President on January 18, 1962, it was to "help the
Cubans from within Cuba" to overthrow the Castro regime through a
"revolt of the Cuban people." . (Lansdale Ex. 3, p. 2).

3. Bissell's Testimony Concerning Presidential Instruc~

tions to Act More Vigorously, But That Assassination Was Not Included.

Sometime in the early fall of 1961, Bissell was apparently called. to
the White House and was said to have been

“chewed out in the Cabinet Room in the White House.

by both the President. and the Attorney General for,

as he put it, sitting on his ass and not doing any-

thing about getting rid of Castro. and the Castro

regime."
et This description comes from the testimony of Samuel Halpern, a middle-
level CIA covert action officer, who said Bissell-told him about the
meeting, and directed him to come up with some plans. (Halpern, pp. 8,
36-37). Bissell said he did not remember that precise meeting but that
he had been, in essence, told to "get off your ass about Cuba."
(Bissell, 7/25/75, pp. 37-38).

Bissell was asked whether he considered such an instruction
to constitute authority for proceeding to assassinate Castro. He said it
would not, and that "formal and explicit approval” would be required for
assassination action (Id., 38-39).

Bissell also testified that there was in fact no assassination
activity between the pre-Bay of Pigs/Roselli operation and his departure

from the Agency in February 1962:

In late 1961 Halpern became Harvey's Executive Assistant

pp. 15-16).

4, The January 19, 1962 Meeting at Which the Attorney General Was

Quoted As Saying Cuba Should Have the "Top Priority" in the United States Government.

On January 19, 1962, a meeting attended by Lansdale, probably Helms, Helms'. Executive
Assistant George McManus, and other representatives of the agencies involved in
Mongoose, took place in Attorney General Kennedy's office.* (McManus, p. 6).

Notes taken at the meeting by McManus contain the following passages:

"Conclusion Overthrow of Castro’ is Possible"

"

+++ 'a solution to the Cuban problem today
carried top priority in U.S. Gov/ernmen/t.

No time, money, effort -- or manpower is to
be spared.'"

\ "Yesterday ... the President had indicated to
him' that final chapter had not been written --
its got to be done and will be done."

(McManus Ex. 1, Memorandum, January 19, 1962, p. 2). NeManus

stated that the words "the top priority in the U.S. Gov/ernmen/t = no

time,money, effort or manpower is to be spared" had been spoken.» bite

Attorney General (McManus, pp. 8-9).

Hed Others who attended the meeting were Brig. Gen. Craig, representing
the Joint Chiefs, Don Wilson of USIA, Major Patchell of the Secretary
of Defense's office, and Frank lland of CIA.

Helms stated that those words reflected the "kind of atmosphere" on which he
relied for his perception that assassination was implicitly authorized. (Helms,
7/17, p. 60-61.) McManus, who wrote. the memorandum, agreed that Robert Kennedy
"was ‘Very vehement in his speech" and "really wanted action" but McManus disagreed
with Helms. perception, stating that "it never occurred to me" that the words
quoted above from Robert Kennedy included permission to assassinate Castro. (McManus,
p. 9.) Nor did the spirit of the meeting as a whole give McManus any idea that

assassination was either contemplated or authorized. (Tr., p. 9-10.)*

5. General Lansdale's Mongoose Planning Tasks

On January 18, 1962, Lansdale-assigned 32 planning tasks to the, agencies parti-
cipating in Mongoose. (Lansdale Ex, 3, Program Review of the Cuba Project.) Ina
memorandum to the working group members, Lansdale emphasized that "it’ is our job to put

the American genius to work on this project, quickly and effectively. This demands.a

change from the business as usual and a hard facing of the fact that we are in a com-
bat situation--where we have been given full command." (Lansdale memorandum, 1/20/62,
p. 1.)

The 32 tasks comprised a variety of activities, ranging from intelligence collec-

tion to planning for "use of U. S. military force to support the Cuban popular

_*/ With respect to the question of priorities and emphasis in the Kennedy
Administration, there was a great deal of proof showing that Cuba
indeed had a high priority and the very existence of a high level
eroup like the Special Group Augmented further demonstrates its
importance. MacHamara, for example, stated that "we were hysterical
about Castro at the time of the Bay of Pigs and thereafter.” (In
the same context, MacNamara stated "I don't believe we contemplated
assassination.) (MacNamara, p. 93). Similarly, General Lansdale in-
formed the members of his inter-agency committee that Mongoose “demands
a change from business-as-usual and a hard facing of the fact that
you're in a combat situation where we have been given full command."

> Ex. » Memorandum, January 20, 1962, from Lansdale).

On the other hand, Sorensen testified.that "there were lots of top

priorities, and it was the job of some of /us/ to continually tell
various agencies their particular subject was the top priority" and
although Cuba was "important" it was "fairly well down on the list of
the President's agenda." (Sorensen, p. 12). For example, when told
that his first letter to Khruschev in the secret correspondence that
lasted two or three years would be "the single most important docu-
ment you will write during your Presidency," President Kenndy said,
"Yes, we get these every day over here." (Sorensen, p. 12).

movement" and developing an "operational schedule for sabotage actions inside
Cuba.""' (Lansdale Ex. 3, p..5, 7.)*
In focusing on intelligence collection, propaganda and various sabotage actions,

Lansdale's tasks were consistent with the underlying strategy of Mongoose to build

gradually towards an internal revolt of the Cuban people. (See p. above.)

Lansdale transmitted a copy of the tasks to Robert Kennedy on January 18, 1962,
with a handwritten note stating 'my- review does not include the sensitive work I
have. reported to you; I felt you preferred informing the President privately."
Lansdale testified that this did not refer to assassinations and that he "never took
up assassination with either the Attorney General or the President."** Lansdale
testified that he could not precisely recall the nature of this "sensitive work" —
but that it might have involved a special trip he made under cover to meet Cuban

leaders in Florida and to assess their political strengths. (Lansdale, p. 30.)

*There was testimony regarding one Lansdale plan that a witness thought was an example
of Lansdale's "perspicacity" in planning operations. Parrott, the Secretary to the
Special Group Augmented, testified:

"I'll give you one example of Lansdale's perspicacity. He
had a wonderful plan for getting rid of Castro. This plan
consisted of spreading the word that the Second Coming of
Christ was imminent and that Christ was against Castro (who)
was anti-Christ. And you would spread this word around Cuba,
and then on whatever date it was, that there would be a mani-
festation of this thing. And at that time--this is absolutely
true--and at that time there would be an American submarine
which would surface just over the horizon off of Cuba and send
up some starshells. And this would be the manifestation of the
Second Coming and Castro would be overthrown..."

"Well, some wag called this operation--by this time Lansdale was
something of a joke in many quarters--and somebody dubbed this
i Elimination by Illumination. (Parrott, p.

**Harvey testified that he never received any instructions from Lansdale to under-
take assassinations, although as noted below (p. ), in August 1962, Lansdale asked
Harvey to consider the feasibility of a plan for the "liquidation" of Cuban leaders,
(Harvey, 7/ /75, p. .)

Lansdale also referred, in a memorandum to the Attorney General on
January 27, 1962, to his feeling that "we might uncork the touchdown
"play" "independently of the institutional program we are spurring."
(Lansdale Ex. 4, p.1). Lansdale testified that in this memorandum the
phrase "touchdown play" was a "breezy way of referring to "g Cuban
-revolt to overthrow the regime" rather than to a Castro assassination.

*
(Lansdale, pis) a! The examples of such "plays cited in the memorandum

“The Chairman: What precisely dideyou mean by "uncork the
touchdown play independently of the institutional programs
we are spurring?" i:

"General Lansdale: Well, I was holding almost daily meet-
ings with my working group, and -- in tasking, and finding
how they were developing plans I was becoming, more and more
concerned that they kept going back to doing what I felt were
pro forma. American types of actions rather than actively ex-
ploring, how to get the Cubans into this, and to have them
undertake actions.

"QT. me, the touchdown play was a Cuban revolt to over-
throw the remime. I did not feel that we had fotten into
the real internal part of getting Cubans into the action,
and I was concerned about that."

“Senator Baker: In the same context, is it fair.to say that
the name of the game was to get rid of Castro or his regime
and that touchdown play was one of several methods, that f-
might have been used for that purpose?" an

"General Lansdale: Yes."

“Senator Baker: All right, now. what was the touchdown play
that you had in mind here?"

"General Lansdale: Well, it was a revolt by the Cubans
themselves ... a revolution that would break down the police
controls of the state and to drive the top people out of

power and to do that, there needed to be political actions
cells, psychological propaganda action cells, and eventually
when possible, guerilla forces developed in the country in

a safe place for a new government to set up and direct the
revolution that would eventually move into Havana and take over."
(Lansdale, pp. 45-56).

(e.g., "stir up workers in Latin America and Cuba," work through "ethnic

won .

language groups," "youth elements," or families through the Church") do

not contain anv indi¢ation of assassination. (Lansdale, Ex. 4, p. 1.)
7 On January 19, 1962, Lansdale added an additional
task to those assigned on January 18. This "Task 33" involved a Plan to
"incapacitate" Cuban sugar workers during the harvest by the use of chemical
warfare means. (Lansdale, p. 29). Lansdale testified that the plan in-
volved the use of non-lethal chemicals to sicken Cubans temporarily and
keep them away from the fields for a 24-48 hour period “without ill effects."
After initial approval for planning purposes (withthe notation that it :
would require “policy determination" before final approval), the plan was
ultimately cancelled after a study showed it was not Leasible and before de~
bate by the SGA, (Lansdale, p. 29, Special Group “inutes, 1/30/62, p. 1.)
Lansdale's 33 tasks were approved for planning purposes ~ ‘i
by the Special Group on January 30, 1962 (Minutes of Special Group meeting,
1/30/62, p. 1). Thereafter, on February 20, 1962, Lansdale detailed a
six phase schedule for Mongoose, designed to culminate in October, 1962,
with an "open revolt and overthrow of the Communist regime." (Lansdale
Ex. 11, Program Review of the Cuba Project, 2/20/62, p. 2). As one of the
operations for the "Resistance" phase proposed for September, 1962, Lansdale
listed "attack on the cadre of the regime, including key leaders.” (Id., p. 151).

Lansdale's plan stated:

"It may be a special effort which professional labor

operators can launch to stir up workers in Latin America

and Cuba. It may be through ethnic-language groups; Spain

“of the always lively youth element in Latin America and

Cuba, through some contacts specially used. It could be with
the families through the Church, with families resisting the
disciplined destruction of social Justice by the Commmists. It
could be an imaginative defection project which cracks the top
echelon of the Communist gang now running Cuba."

ee ales
"This should be a 'Special Target' operation ...
Gangster elerients might provide the best recruit-
ment potential for actions against police -- G2
/intelligence/ officials." (Id., p. 151).°_*/

Lansdale testified that early in the Mongoose opera-
tion he had suggested to the working level representatives of the Mongoose
agencies that they get in touch with "criminal elements" to obtain intelli-
gence and “possible actions against the police structure" in Cuba. (Lans-

dale, p. 104). But Lansdale conceded that his* proposal to recruit
gangster elements for: attacks-on "key leaders": contemplated the targeted

. killing of individuals, in addition to the casualties that might occur in
the course of the revolt itself. (Lansdale, p. 107).

These 33 plans of Lansdale were, however, never

approved for implementation by the Special Group Augmented. As
discussed below in greater detail (see p- ), the Special Group Augmented
tabled Lansdale's six phase plan altogether in February 1962, and directed
Lansdale to plan for and conduct an intelligence collection plan only.
(Memo, 3/2/62; Minutes of Special Group Augmented Meeting, 3/5/62).

a. Lansdale's Rejection of a Suggestion That _a Propaganda

Campaign, Including Rewards for Assassination, Be Explored

On January 30, 1962, the representative of the Defense Department and the

Joint Chiefs on the Mongoose Working Group forwarded for Lansdale's con-

,

sideration "a concept for creating distrust and apprehension in the Cuban

. Communist Hierarchy" (Lansdale Ex. 1, Memorandum, 1/30/62, from Craig

to Lansdale, p. 1). This concept, titled Operation Bounty, was described as

a "system of financial rewards, commensurate with position and stature,
for killing or delivering alive known Communists." (Id., p. 2) Under the

concept, leaflets would be dropped in Cuba listing rewards, which

*7hn earlier reference to use of gangster-type elements had appeared
in a CIA memorandum for the Special Group on January 24, 1962. Commenting
on Task 5 of Lansdale's original 32 tasks (which called for planning for
“defection of top Cuban government officials"), the CIA memorandum noted
that planning for the task will "necessarily be based upon an appeal made

inside the island by intermediaries" and listed "crime syndicates" along

were proposed as ranging from $5,000 for an "informer" to $100,000 for
“government officials." A reward of "2¢" was listed tor Castro nim~ :
self. (Id., p. 3). Lansdale testified that price was designed "to deni-
werate ... Castro in the eyes of the Cuban population." (Lansdale, Tr. 26).
Lansdale testified that he "tabled" this concept when

he received it, on the ground that "I did not think that it was something

that should be.seriously undertaken or supported further." (Lansdale, p. 26).

Lansdale did not bring the proposal before the Special Group Augmented.

6. The Control.Syvstem for. Mongoose Operations.

In establishing the Mongoose Operation
on November 30, 1961, President Kennedy had emphasized that the Special
Group should be "kept closely informed" of Mongoose activities. (memo-
.randum by the President, 11/30/62; Goodwin, ‘p. ).

In practice, as Samuel Halpern, Harvey's Executive Assistant on ud
the CIA Mongoose Task Force. W testified, this resulted in the submission

of "specific detailed plans for every activity carried out by the task

force." (Halpern, p. 16). Halpern testified that those plans were sub-

mitted "in nauseating detail:"

"It went down to such things as the gradients on the
beach, and the composition of the sand on the beach
in many cases. Every single solitary thing was in
those plans, full details, times, events, weaponry,
how it was going to happen, who was going to do thats}
-. the full details of every single thing we“did.
e (Halpern, p. 17). rN)

§

=

Harvey similarly characterized the control process (ilarvey, 6/25,”
p. 123), as one which required the submission of “excruciating detail" and

where it was understood. that the Special Group Augmented was to be given

HW 50955 DocId:32423524 Page 162


~23-
an opportunity to debate and decide after weighing the strengths and
weaknesses of any given proposed action. (Harvey, 6/25, pp. 114, 124).

a. The Documentary Evidence

cz The documentary evidence illustrates the tight control prom
cedures set out for Mongoose by the Special Group Aupmented. For example,
as discussed above (p.  _), Lansdale initially submitted 32 specific tasks
with his ‘basic concept” on January 18, 1962 for consideration by
the Special Group Augmented. (Lansdale Ex. 3) After consideration
of Lansdale's concept and the 32 tasks in February. the Special Group
Augmented ordered Lansdale to_cut back his plan to Limit it te an
intelligence collection program for the Narch-May 1962 period, rather
than the Live-stage plan to culminate in an October “popular revolution"
as originally conceived by Lansdale. (Nemo 3/2/62, by Lansdale) In
approving the intelligence collection program, the Special Group Aur-
mented pointed out that:

+ + + any actions which are not specifically spelled
out in the plan but seem to be desirable as the pro-
ject progresses, will be brought to the Special Croup
for resolution." (Helms Ex. 1, 7/18, p.l)

for providing policy puidance to the (ionzoo8&) “project,
for approving important operations and for monitoring
7 Progress. (Guidelines for Operation Monfoose, March au,
f 1962, p.2)

Further indication of the Mongoose control process is the request given

to Helms a month prior to Harvey's trip to mect Roselli in tia Pur=

suant to the discussion at the Special Group's meeting on March 5, Nelms

was asked to estimate "for each week as far into the next twelve months

as possible . . . the members and type of agents you will establish
inside Cuba . . . (and) bricf descriptions . . . of actions contemplated."
(Memo to Helms from Lansdale, March 5, 1962) bi

Moreover, the approved plan for Operation Motigoose, as of
the time of Harvey's meeting with Roselli in Miami required that auy

proposal to supply arms and equipment to particular resistance

groups inside Cuba “be submitted to the Special Group for decision,

ad hoc" (Lansdale Memo to » April 11,1962, p.  -)e

And the Guidelines for the Mongoose program emphasized that, after specific
tasks were approved by the Special Group Augmented and given to participating i .
agencies by Lansdale, normal command channels were to be observed. As the
Guidelines. stated:

During this period, General Lansdale will continue
as Chief of Operations, calling directly on the
participating departments and agencies for.support
and implementation of agreed tasks. The heads of
these departments and agencies are responsible for
performance through normal command channels to
higher authority. “_/ Guideline for Operation Mon-
goose, March 14, 1962, p.2)

¥ The initial draft of these Guidelines had referred to the President but
was later amended to read’ “higher authority." (Draft Guidelines, March
7 5,°1962, p.2) The minutes of the consideration of these Guidelines were
also amended with respect to the manner in which the Guidelines were approved.
On March 16, 1962, a Memorandum for Record of "Discussion of Operation
Mongoose with the President" of the Special Group (Augmented) stated:

"In the presence of the Special Group (Augmented)
the President was given a progress report oh Operation MO!-
GOOSE. The guidelines dated March 14, 1962 were circulated
and were used as the basis .of the discussion. After a
prolonged consideration of the visibility, noise level and
risks entailed, General Lansdale and the Special Group (Aug-
mented) were given tacit authorization to proceed in accordance
with the guidelines.

In a Memorandum to Mé¢Cone on April 10, 1962, Harvey recognized that the
Special Group Augmented control process required advance approval of "major
Sperations going beyond the collection of intelligence." But Harvey stated
that these “tight controls" were unduly “gtultifying:"

"To permit requisite flexibility and professionalism .
for a maximum operational effort against Cuba, the

right controls exercised by the Special Group and the
present time-consuming coordination and briefing pro-
cedures should, if at all possible, be made less
restrictive and less stultifying." (Memo, April 10, 1962,
Harvey to McCone, p.4) *

Even as the Cuban Missile Crisis approached, and the pressure to
act against the Castro regime increased through a "stepped up" Mongoose
plan, the Special Group continued to insist on Ceoe approval of sensitive
operations. Thus, when the Special Group Augmented on September 14,

1962, approved in principle a proposed set of operations,

(Footnote cont'd)

fowever, a note at the bottom of this memorandum, dated March 22, 1962,
- stated:

This minute was read to the Special Grou
(Augmented) today. ‘the Group was unanimous in feeling
that no authorization, either tacit or otherwise, was
given by higher authority. The members of the Group
asked that the minute be amended to indicate that the
Group itself had decided to proceed in accordance with

the Guidelines.

Bundy, speaking to the Group,

"

++. made it clear that this did not constitute
a blanket approval of every item in the paper and

” ‘that sensitive ones such as sabotage, for example,
will have to be presented in more detail on a case
by case basis." (Memo of Special Croup Augmented

meeting, September 14, 1962, p. ).

Helms and the members of the Special Group Augmented differed on
whether or not these control requirements were consistent with Helms' per- Ca
ception that assassination was permissible without a direct order. We
discuss that testimony below at a ' 7

testimony reveal that the Kennedy Administration pressed the Mongoose opera-

tion with vigorous language and although the collection of intelligence

information was the central objective of Mongoose up until August ag
ae ; en tf Oe
sabotage and para military actions - were conducted.4-fh Pere he eet
major sabotage operation aimed at a large Cuban copper rine} fana pode
sabotage operations. As Lansdale described them in his testimony, the
sahntace acts involved "blowing up bridges to stop communications and
blowing up certain production plants" (Lansdale, p. 36). And during

the Missile Crisis in the fall of 1962, sabotage was increasingly urged.

_*/ In early March, 1962, the SGA recognized the need to begin "preliminary
actions ... involving such things as spotting, assessing and training
action-type agents" but the Group agreed that it must “keep its hand
tightly".on these actions. The Group saw, however, that such control
might not be completely effective and recognized "that many of the
“agents infiltrated would be of an all-purpose type; that is, they would
be trained in paramilitary skills, as well as those of exclusively
intelligence concern. It was noted that once the agents are within the
country, they cannot be effectively controlled from the U.S., although
every effort will be made to attempt such control." (Minutes of
Special Group meeting, March 5, 1962).

HW 50955 Docid:32423524 Page 166


moby are
At the sane ae however, the record shows. that the Special Group Aug-
mented turned away from proposed sabotage and similar violent action throughout
1962, including the period of the Missile Crisis. (See p. above.) Thus, Helms
noted in a memorandum of a meeting on October-15, 1962, that Robert feanedy in ex-
pressing the "general dissatisfaction of the President" with Mongoose, "pointed out
that (Mongoose) had been underway, for a/year...that there had been no acts of sabo~
tage and that evén the one which had been attempted had failed twice". (Memorandum
by Helms, October 16, 1962, p. 1.) Similiarly a memorandum to Helms by his Execu~
tive Assistant (who spent full time on Cuba matters), which reviewed the Mongoose

program in the aftermath .of the Missile. Crisis, stated:

“During the past year, while oneeof the options of the a

project was to create internal dissension and resistance

leading to eventual U.S. intervention, a-review shows

that policymakers not only shied away from the military

intervention aspect but were generally apprehensive of

sabotage proposals. (McManus, Ex. 2, p. 1, McManus,‘p. 11).

Harvey. testified that this assessment of the Special Group Aug-
mented's position was an accurate one. (llarvey, 6/25, p.). This is
also borne out by the record of Mongoose activity. For example, after

Lansdale's. initial six phase plan to overthrow Castro by the fall of 1962,

the single phase approvéd for January August 1962 was described by Lans+

dale as “essentially an intelligence collection" effort. (Memorandum,

SEP

Ce” ns we "
alconitg months.
tae panied
(Taylor Ex. 3, p. 2, Guidelines for Operation Mongoose, March 14, 1962).
The Guidelines further stated that although other covert actions would be
undertaken concurrently with intelligence collection, these were to be on
a scale “short of those reasonably calculated to inspire a revolt" in Cuba,

(Id., p. 2). And the Special Group stipulated that Mongoose action beyond

the acquisition of intelligence "must be inconspicuous." (Memorandum,

NW 50955 pocrat 493504? B4Ghe 169: 3).


HW 50955

By Ae

With the scheduled conclusion of that intelligence collection
phase in August 1962, the Special Group Augmented considered whether to
(adopt a “stepped-up Course B plus," which, in contrast to Phase I, was
designed to inspire a revolt against the Castro regime. (Memorandum for
the Special Group. Augmented, 8/8/62, from Lansdale, p. 1). Initially, the
Special Group Augmented decided against this course and in favor of a "CIA
variant," at a meeting of Special Group Augmented principals on August 10, ~
1962. (Minutes of Special Group Augmented Gere August 10, 1962)... The
"CIA variant," which was proposed by McCone on August 10, posited more

limited actions to avoid inciting a revolt and sought not Castro's over-

throw, but a split between Castro and “old-line Communists." (Id.,-p. 2).

The onset of the Missile Crisis caused an initial reversion to the

stepped-up Course B plan, but ultimately, however, an order was issued on

October 30, 1962 to halt all sabotage operations. (Lansdale, Ex.8, Memo
by Lansdale, 10/30/62)

Thus, on August 20, Taylor told the President that the Special
Group Augmented perceived no likelihood of an overthrow of the Castro govern-
ment by internal means without direct U.S. military intervention, and
that the Special Group Augmented favored a more agressive Mongoose program.

(Memo from Taylor to President.) Shortly thereafter, on
‘August 23, McGeorge Bundy issued NSC Memo Number 181 to Lansdale and Taylor
stating that, at the President's directive, “the line of activity projected
for Operation MONGOOSE Plan B plus should be developed with all possible
speed." “One week later, on August 30, the CIA was instructed by. the Special
Group Augmented to submit a list of possible sabotage targets they might
propose and it was noted that this list could serve as the limit for action
on the Agency's own initiative: "The Group, by reacting to this list, could
1

define the limits within which the Agency could operate on its own initiative."

Special Group Augmented Minutes of August 30, 1962.)

Thus, at a-Special Group Augmented meeting on October 4, 1962, Robert
Kennedy stated that the President "is. concerned about progress on the Mongoose
program and feels that more priority should be given to trying to mount sabotage
operations". And Robert Kennedy urged that "massive activity" be undertaken
within the Mongoose framework. In line with this proposal, the Special Group
Augmented decided:that "considerably more sabotage" should be undertaken, and that
"all efforts should be made to develop new and imaginative approaches with the pos-
sibility of getting rid of the Castro regime’. (Minutes of Special Group Aug-
mented meeting, October 4, 1962, p. )*. On October 30, 1962, however, the

order to stop all sabotage operations was issued (Lansdale, Ex. 8).**

* The SGA also decided on October 4, 1962, that Robert Kennedy would chair
the Group's meetings "for the time being." (Id., p. ). Subsequently,
at a meeting on October 16, 1962, Robert Kennedy stated that he was
going to give Mongoose "more personal attention" in view of the lack of
progress and would hold daily meetings with the working group represen-
tatives, i.e., Lansdale, Harvey, and the other Agency members. (lHarvey,
Ex. 12, Memorandum of Meeting, October 16, 1962, by Helms, p. 1). Helms
testified that he did not recall any such daily meetings with the
Attorney General, but he had the impression there may have been several
at first, but then they ceased. (Helms, 7/17/ > Pp. 54-55).

“Mlarvey testified that he had a "confrontation" with Robert Kennedy
at the height of the Missile Crisis concerning Iarvey's order that
agent teams be sent into Cuba to support any conventional U.S. mili-
tary operation that might occur.

Elder, NeCone's assistant at the time, similarly, described; tliis inc!

from top officials during the Missile Crisis, Narvey "earned another

black mark as not being fully under control". (Elder, p. 34-35.)

‘As Sorensen (a member of the Executive Committee established to deal with
the Missile Crisis) testified, even though Cuba was the "No. 1 priority" dur-
ing the Missile crisis, and “all alternatives, plans, possibilities were ex-
haustively surveyed" during that time, the subject of assassination was never
raised in the high-level National Security Council Executive Committee (of which

Helms was not a member) that was formed to deal with the Missile Crisis.

(Sorensen, 7/21, p. 11.)***

*** There are references in the Special Group Augmented records to attacks
on Soviet personnel in Cuba. The record of the SGA meeting on September ie
1962, states:

"It was suggested that the matter of attacking and
harassing of Soviet personnel within Cuba should be
considered." (SGA Minutes, 9/9/62, p. ).

Earlier, on August 31, 1962, Lansdale had included a task "to provoke
incidents between Cubans and Bloc personnel to exacerbate tensions,"

in a proposed projection of actions for Phase II of Mongoose. (Memo-
“randum to SGA, 8/31/62, from Lansdale, Action No. 7). The Special Group
thereafter decided, as a means of "emphasizing ‘such activity" to replace
that task with one to "cause actions by Cubans against Bloc personnel,"
and to note that "consideration will be given to provoking and conducting
physical attacks on Bloc personnel." (Memorandum to Taylor, Rusk, and
MacNamara, 9/12/62, from Lansdale, pp. 1-2).

See

E. The Issue of Authority Outside the Agency

This section discusses the evidence as to whether there was authorization
from outside the Agency for the assassination activity that took place during
the Mongoose operation.

TR. 7/17, p.4)

As discussed below in detail, both Helms and the Kennedy’ Administration
officials agreed that no direct order was ever given for Castro's assassina-
tion and that no one outside the Agency (including McCone) was informed
about the assassination activity. Helms testified, however, that he believed
the assassination activity was"permissible and that” it was withid the scope _
of the authority given to the Agency. McGene and the other Kennedy Admini - :
stration officials disagreed, testifying that assassination was not permissible

without a direct order and that a Castro assassination was not within the

authorized bounds of the Mongoose operation.

In April 1962, when the poison pills were given to Roselli in Miami,
Helms was the CIA Deputy Director in charge of covert operations and reported
to McCone, the CIA Director. Helms had succeeded Bissell in this job,
following Bissell's retirement in February, 1962, as a consequence of the
failure of the Bay of Pigs invasion. Helms testified that, after the Bay
of Pigs, “Those of us who were still (in the Agency) were enormously anxious
to try and be successful at what we were’ being asked to do by what was then
a relatively new Administration. We wanted to earn our spurs with the

President and with other officers of the Kennedy Administration.” (Helms

1. Helms' Testimony Concerning Authority

As set forth below, Ilelms testified that while he doubted whether
he was initially informed that Harvey gave poison pills to Roselli and did
not recall having authorized a Castro assassination in that form, nevertheless,

Helms had authorized the 1962 assassination plot because “we felt that we

HW 50955 DocId:32423524 Page 171


- 29a -
were operating as we were supposed to operate; that these things if
not specifically authorized, at least were authorized in general terms.”

(Helms, 6/13, p.61)

5 Perception of Authority
Helms testified that based ‘upon the ‘‘intense’ pressure exerted by the
Kennedy Adwninistration to overthrow Castro it was his perception that the CIA

ae

was at all times acting within the scope of its authority with respect 96 4

‘or the Attorney General.

)

@ielms, 6/13, p. 137: ilelms,. 7/17, p. 62, 7/17, p. 4-5.) Melms testified that

this authority, as he perceived it, was implicit in the U. S$. policy and attitude

towards Castro. (Helms, 6/13, p. 165.) As Helms testified:

"I believe it was the policy at the time to get rid of Castro
and if killing him was one of the things that was to be done
in this connection, that was within what was expected."
Gielms, 6/13, p. 137.)

*The extent to which pressure in fact existed "to do something about Castro" is
discussed in detail in the section immediately above dealing with Operation Mon-
goose, its strategy of causing an internal revolt of the Cuban people against
Castro, the strict control system established by the Special Group Augmented, and

the pattern of intelligence collection’ and sabotage activity actually authorized
and undertaken.

HW 50955 Docld:32423524 Page 172


- 30 -

Helms testified that "I remember vividly (the pressure to overthrow

Castro) was very intense." (Helms, 6/13, p. 26.) Helms stated that this pres-

sure intensified during the period of Operation Mongoose during late 1961 and

throughout 1962, and then continued on throughmuch of 1963. (lelms, 6/13, p. 27.)

As these pressures rose, “obviously the extent of the means that one thought

were available, obvious increased too." (elms, 6/13, p. 26.)

Helms stated that during the Mongoose Operations period "it was made abundantly
clear...to everybody involved in the operation that the desire was to get rid of
the Castro regime and to get rid of Castro...the point was that no limitations
were put on this injunction." (Helms, 7/17, p. 16-17).:- In Helms" testimony,

the following exchange occurred: ae
"Senator Mathias: ‘Let me draw an example from history.
When Thomas A. Beckett was proving to be an annoyance,
as Castro, the King said who will rid me of this man.
He didn't say to somebody go out and murder him. He said
who will rid me of this man, and let it go at that.

"Mir. Helms: ‘That is a warming reference to the problem.'

“Senator Mathias: 'You feel that spans the generations
and the centuries?’ 7

"Mr, Helms: 'I think it does, sir.'

"Senator Mathias: 'And that is typical of the Kind of thing
which might be said, which might be taken by the director or
by anybody else as presidential authorization to go forward?!

“Mr. Helms: 'That is right. But in answer to that, I re-
alize that one sort of grows up in [the] tradition of the
time and I think that any of us would have found it very
difficult to discuss assassinations with a President of the
U.S. I just think we all had the feeling that we're hired
out to keep those things out of the oval office.’

“Senator Mathias: ‘Yet at the same time you felt that some

spark had been transmitted, that that was within the per-
missible limits?'

"Mr. Helms: ‘Yes, and if he had disappeared from the scene
they would not have’ been unhappy.'" (Helms Tr. 6/13, pp. 72-73)

HW 50955 DocId:32423524 Page 173


- 30a -

Helms said that although he never was told by his superiors to kill Castro
(llelms, 7/17, p. 15), there was at the same time never any injunction laid down
by the Lennedy Administration that proscribed a Castro assassination: “No wenber
of the Kennedy Administration...ever told me that (assassination) was proscribed,
(or) ever referred to it in that fashion..." (Helms, 7/71, p. 18.) "Nobody ever

said that (assassination) was ruled out..." (elms 7/17, p. 43.

2 &
Helms stated that during the Mongoose period, “e For of

assassination of Castro, "with all the other things thal
time...seemed to’ be within the permissible part of this-effort." ~(Nelms, 6/13
p. 99.) “In the perceptions of the time and the things we were trying to do this

was one human life against many other human lives that were being lost."

(elms, 6/13, p. 64.)*

*As Helms declared: ‘In my 25 years in the Central Intelligence Agency, I always
thought I was working within authorization, that I was doing what I had been
asked to do by proper authority and when I was operating on my own I was doing
what I believed ite be the legitimate business of the Agency as it would have been
expected of me." (Helms, 6/13, p. 30-31.)

**As set out above (p. ), Helms stated: "...people were losing their lives
in raids, a lot of people had lost their life at the Bay of Pigs, agents were
being arrested left and right and put before the wall and shot." (Helms, 6/13,
p. 64.)

b. Helms' Testimony That He Had No Direct Order to Assassinate
Castro and Did Not Inform the President or the Special Group
of the Assassination Activity

Helms testified that there was no direct order to assassinate Castro.

ile said that his perceptions of authority did not reach the point where he could

testify that he had spe

i£ic instructions to kill Castro. As he put it:

"T have testified as best I could about the atmosphere
“of the time, what I understood was desired, and I don't
want to take refuge in saying that I was instructed to
specifically murder Castro, . ." (Helms, 6/13, p.88).

On the question of whether the President was “informed of any
assassination plots, Helms pointed out that "nobody wants to embarrass a
President of the United States (by) discussing the assassination of foreign
leaders in his presence" (6/13, p. 29), and that the Special Group was "the
mechanism that was set up. .. .to use as a circuit breaker so that these

things did not explode in the President's face and that he was, ae

responsible for them." (6/13, p. 29). Howeygrffiielg also, téstigs
that he had "no knowledge that a Castro assas$i “ever authorized
by the Special Group (Augmented)" (6/13, pp.28-29).

In addition, Helms said he never informed the Special Group Augmented

or any member of that Group that Harvey had given the pills to Roselli

in Miami "because I am not even sure I knew about it at the time." (Helms,
7/18, p.18).*/ Helms also stated he never told Robert Kennedy about any

assassination activity and my "presumption-is he wasn't informed" (Helms,
6/13, p.58), and that "Harvey kept (the Roselli pill plot) pretty much

: in his back pocket." (Helms, 6/13,pp.57-58).

Helms further testified that although Robert’ Kennedy was "constantly

in touch" with him in 1962 and 1963, Robert Kennedy never instructed Helms

HW 50955 Docld:32423524 Page 175


NW 50955

- 3la ~

to assassinate Castro:

"The Chairman. 'Since he was on the phone to you
” repeatedly did he ever. tell you to kill Castro?!

"Mr. Helms. 'No.'

“he Chairman: ‘He did not?!
“Mr. Helms: jot in those words, no.'" (Helms,
T/L, p.13)2/

¥jigine immediately reiterated after this exchange that his perception of
authority for a Castro assassination rested on the pressure exerted by the
Administration against Castro. The exchange between the Chairman and Helms
continued as follows:

"te Chairman: ‘Well, did he ever tell you in other words
that clearly conveyed’ to you the message that he wanted
to kill Castro?!

"Helms: ‘Sir, the last time I was (before the Committee), I
aid the best I could about what I believed to be the parameters
under which we were working, and that was to get rid of Castro.
And I don't, I am sorry to say . . . see how one would have
expected that a thing like killing or murdering or assassinating
would become part'of a large group of people sitting around a
table in the United States Government. I can't imagine any
Cabinet officer wanting to-sign off on something like that. au
can't imagine, anybody wanting something in writing saying T
have just charged Mr. Jones to go out and shoot Mr. Smith."
(lelms, 7/17, pp. 13-24)

ce. telms Testimony that he Ddubted Whether he had

Authorized a Specific Assassination Attempt or was Informed
of the Passage of the Pills

There is:some doubt whether Helms ever authorized a specific attempt
at Castro's assassination, or was informed of the passage of the pioson
pills to Roselli in April, 1962. Although Helms testified that Harvey
regularly reported to Helms on Harvey's Mongoose work (Helms, 6/13, p-95),
and Helms "would have thought" that Harvey would have reported to Helms
the transfer of the pills into Cuba (Helms, 6/13, p.105), Helms does not

recall Harvey ever telling him that the pills were delivered to Roselli.

(Helms, 7/17, p.22).
Thus,:as indicated above, Helms tesfified he never informed the Special

Group Augmented or any member of that Group that ilarvey had given the pills

to Roselli in Miami "because I am not even sure I knew about it at the time.!

(tielms, 7/16, p. 18.)* And with respect to the pills, Helms testified that,

although he agreed to the Harvey-Roselligpperatss ‘Shieved Ay
4 pe a FT & i 4
implicit authorization for oe! ivity), he testified)

call having okayed the killing of Castro myself in that form." (Ilelms, 7/17,

p. 9.)

a. Helms' Perception of Robert Kennedy's Position on a Castro
Assassination

In testifying as to his perception of authority, Helms emphasized the

particular role played by Robert Kennedy in pressing for progress and results

*/ Helms' testimony that he may not have been informed that the pills were
delivered is corroborated by Harvey's testimony. Harvey testified that
when he returned from Miami he reported to Helms on his: contacts with
Roselli. But ilarvey said that he only "briefed Helms generally", on the
subjects of Harvey's takeover of the Roselli operation, the prospects
of the operation, and the fact that Harvey had dropped Maheu and Giancana
from the operation. (Harvey, 6/25, p.65).

HW 50955 Docld:32423524 Page 177


seer
in the Mongoose Operation.*/ In addition, Helms said that

Robert Kennedy often talked directly with Helms and other CIA officials
working on the Mongoose program, outside of the Special Group Augmented
channels. (Helms, 7/17, p.13; 7/18, pp.60-61). As Helms stated:
“ "I-can say absolutely fairly we are constantly in
touch with each other in these matters. The Attorney
General was on the phone to me, he was on the phone
to Mr. Harvey, to Mr. Fitzgerald, his successor. He
was on the phone even to people on Harvey's staff, as
I recall it." (Helms, 7/17, p.13). ee
Helms said that although he did not know whether a Castro
assassination would have been morally acceptable to Robert Kennedy,
Helms believed that Robert Kennedy "would not (have been) unhappy if
(Castro) had disappeared off-the scene by whatever means."” (Helms,

7/17. p.17-18). And Helms stated that Robert Kennedy never told him

that a Castro assassination was ruled out. (Helms, 7/17, p.21).

However, Helms further testified that although Robert Kennedy vas

“constantly in touch" with Helms and their exchanges were marked by de-
‘tailed, factual, and highly specific discussions on anti-Castro operations.
Robert Kennedy never raised the subject of a Castro assassination and never
instructed Helms to assassinate Castro.** Helms further testified that he had

no knowledge that Robert Kennedy "was ever asked to specifically approve

an assassination plot." (Helms, 6/13, p. 57.)

Q: "So it.was. your impression that he was sort of setting tl
the group's action or activity."
A: "Oh, yes...there wasn't any doubt about that. He sas
interested in this and spent a great deal of, gtime on RCN
: 6/13, p. 22.) ee \
**The telephone records of the Attorney Genera

contact between the Attorney General .aqt! lel nd*Helms stated that his
conversations with Robert Kennedy were\{'candid!' and that "he and I used to

deal in facts most of the time." (Helnlg, 6/18, p.63.) Helms testified as

to the level of detail in his talks with Robert Kennedy:

to that degree of specificity." (Helms, 7/17, p.40)

HW 50955

And, as stated above, lelms. also testified that "Harvey kept Phase 2
(the Roselli pill operation) pretty much in his back pocket'” and that al-
though llelms stated "I do not’ know this for sure,” he testified it was
his "presumption" that Robert Kennedy was not informed of the Piase 2

operation.* (Helms, 6/13, p. 57-58.)

e. Helms' Testimony as to Why He Did Not Obtaitr a Direct
Order

ilelms testified that assassination "was not part of the CTA's policy"

And, in his own

or a part of CIA's "armory". (Helms, 6/13, p.

view, Uelms said that he "never liked assassination". (And, in fact, banned
its use years after he became CIA Director.) (Helms, __-)

Moreover, Helms testified that he had serious reservations regarding the

CIA working with underworld figures. (Helms, 7/18 p.31). When Harvey

developed, Helms "had very grave doubts abou ta Hisdontt ad

underworld figures. (Helms, 6/13, p.33; 7/18, p.31).
Despite these reservations, Helms did not seek approval for

the assassination, activity because he said assassination was not

a subject that he felt should be aired with higher authority. (Helms, 7/18,

pp.31-32). With respect to the question of obtaining.express authority

* elms based this presumption on a review of relevant documents at the

time of his testimony. (Helms, 6/13, p.58).

from the Special Group or Special Group Augmented, Helms stated: "...

I didn't

see. how one would have expected that a thing like killing or

murdering or assassination would become a part of a large group of people

“sitting around a table in the United States Government." (Helms, 7/17,

14).

And with regard to informing the President or obtaining explicit

authority from him, Helms stated that "nobody wants to embarrass a: Presi-

dent of the United States (by) discussing the assassination of foreign

leaders in his presence." (Helms, 6/13, p. 29).

Thus, in the following exchange Helms stated that it "wouldn't have

occurred to me to ask" for clarification or express authority for assass-

ination activity from Robert Kennedy or the Special Group:

Helms also pointed out his reason for

"Senator Huddleston: "...it did not occur to you to

inquire of the Attorney General or of the Special

Group or of anyone that when they kept pushing and -
asking for action...to clarify that question of

whether you should actually be trying to assassinate?"

"Mr. Helms: "I don't know whether it was in training
experience, tradition or exactly what one points to,
but I think to go up to a Cabinet officer and say,

am I right in assuming that you want me to assassinate
Castro or to try to assassinate Castro, is a question
it wouldn't have occurred to me to ask."

KKK

“Senator Huddleston: "... (because assassination has such
serious consequences) seems to fortify the thought that

I would want to be dead certain, I would want to hear

it from the horse's mouth in plain, simple English language
before ‘I would want to undertake that kind of activity."
(Helms, 7/17, pp.51-52).

"Senator Morgan: "In light of your previous statement
that this is a Christian country and that this Committee
has to face up to the prime moral issue of whether or not
killing is...acceptable...don't you think it would have
taken affirmative permission or authority to kill, rather
than just saying it was not eliminated from the authority
or you were not restricted...?"

Page 180

"Mr. Helms: "...killing was not part of the CIA's policy.

It was not part of the CIA's armory...but in this Castro
operation...I have testified as best I could about the
atmosphere of the time, what I understood was desired (and)
that this was getting rid of Castro, if he had been gotten
rid of by this. means that this would have been acceptable

to certain individuals...I was just doing my best to do

what I thought I was supposed to do." (Helms, 6/13. pp.87-88).

When asked why he did not seek clarification from the Special
Group, its members, or Robert Kennedy whether it was "in fact, the
policy of the U.S. Government to actually kill Fidel Castro," Helms

answered "I don't know..."
"...There is something about the whole chain of episodes
in. conncection with. this Roselli business that I am
simply not able to bring back in a coherent fashion.
And there was something about the ineffectuality of all
this, or the lack of convictiot that anything ever
happened, that I believe in the end made this thing
simply collapse, disappear. And I don't recall what I
was briefed on at the time. Maybe I was kept currently
informed and maybe I wasn't, and today I don't remember
it...But I do not recall ever having been convinced
that any attempt was really made on Castro's life. And
since I didn't believe any attempt had been made on
Castro's life, I saw no’ reason to pursue the matter
further." (Helms, 7/18, pp.31-32).

f. llelms' Perception of the Relevance of Special Group
Controls to Assassination Activity

The evidence concerning the control system established by the
Special Group for the Mongoose Operation is discussed above (see p. Pe yis
Helms: stated, however, that the control system established by the

Special Group for Mongoose was not intended to apply to assassination
activity. (Helms, 7/18, p.21).- Thus, with respect to the Special Croup
Augmented's decision on March 5, 1962 that major operations going beyond
the collection of intelligence must receive awry, ovaly
stated that this referred to "rather specific hie th ‘Seca

Group had on its agenda" from the outset of Mongoose. (Helms, 7/18,

Helns»

A ig

p.21). Since assassination was not among such items, Helms 3

Pa vies

that the Special Group would not have expected assassination
activity to come under this particular policy. (Helms, 7/18,
p-21). And with respect to the Special Group Augmented's desire
to "keep its hands tightly on preliminary actions" leading
towards sabotage and other actions beyond intelligence collection,
Helms: stated that was the kind of injunction "that appears in all
kinds of governmental minutes of meetings." (Helms, 7/18, p.17).
Helms said he regarded these as "general injunctions: rather than
an "all inclusive injunction" to keep the Group informed of all matters. -
(Helms, 7/18, -.17).

Helms said he recognized, however, That there were limits on
permissible activity during Mongoose.*/ (Helms, 7/18,p.9). Thus,
Helms stated that although there were "no limitations" on, actions
to remove Castro during Mongoose, there were restraints on sabotage
operations and he did not understand the cueence of specific limitations
to authorize more drastic actions, such as committing the U.S. military
to an invasion of Cuba. (Helms, 7/18, p.9).

In addition, Helms testified that he saw no need to inform the

Special Group of the Harvey-Roselli operation because that operation was

characterized by "ineffectuality" and a "lack of conviction that aN

ever happened." (Helms, 7/18, p.32). Helms stated he did # Oe
bi
a any attempt had been made on Castro's life by virtue hs al

in Miami with Roselli. (Helms, 7/18, p.32) aoe ae

Mh, se
*/ Helms testified, that although loss of ts was implicit in the
Mongoose operations,

"I think there was an effort made not to take tacks
that would recklessly kill a lot of people and not
achieve very much. I think there was an effort, if you
had a sabotage operation, not to throw.a lot of hand
grenades into a city, but rather take out the power
plant which would actually damage the economy of the
country. There was an effort made to find devices that
would seem to have a useful end. (!elms, 7/17, p.63-64).

2. Harvey's Testimony Concerning Authority

a. Harvey's Perception of Authority

Harvey stressed that at all times he was acting as a line officer re-

porting to his immediate superior within the Agency, the Deputy Director for
covert actions (first Bissell, then Helms.)* ~— (Harvey, 6/25, p. 83).

Similarly, Harvey also pointed out that his information with respect
to authorization from outside the agency came from the Deputy Director:

"(a)t no time during this entire period...did I ever personally
believe or have any feeling that I was either free-wheeling or
end-running or engaging in any activity that was not in response

to a considered, decided U. S. policy, properly approved, admittedly,
perhaps, or through channels and at levels I personally had no in-
volvement in, or first-hand acquaintance with, and did not consider
it at that point my province to, if youwill, cross-examine either
the Deputy Director or the Director concering it." (Harvey 6/25,

p. 83.)

HW 50955 DocId:32423524 Page 183


39

Thus, Harvey relied upon his superiors within the Agency for authority.
Indeed, Harvey indicated that his perception of the authorization for the
1962 ‘Assassination activity may have come from the period when Allen Dulles
was DCI. As Harvey stated:

"But I had every right to believe organizationally,
humanly, whatever way you want to put it, that nothing
that was being told to me by Bissell had not in fact
come to him from /Allen Dulles/.

But Harvey made clear that this did not imply that McCone knew of or au-

thorized the assassination activity:

"The Chairman: 'That doesn't necessarily mean that be-
cause the previous director had knowledge that Mr. McCone
had knowledge. It is not like a Covenant that runs in
the land.''t

"Mr. Harvey: 'No, of course not, and they don't always
brief their successors.'". (Harvey, 6/25, p. 85.)

HW 50955 DocId:32423524 Page 184

b. Harvey and the Special Group Augmented

Harvey testified that he néver informed the Special Group Augmented,
or any of its nenbers individually, of the ongoing assassination plots. As
we described earlier, the Special Group Augmented and its Mongoose program
began its Cuba activities in late 1961 through 1962. Harvey attended.many
of the Special Group Augmented meetings as the CIA's representative. He
testified that at no time was assassination discussed at any of the meetings,
except for the August 10, 1962 meeting.*

We took substantial testimony covering the April/May. 1962 period when
the underworld contact was reactivated, the pills were passed to Roselli and
delivered to Cuba. Harvey had been appointed several months earlier as head
of the CIA's Task Force W, which operated under the Special Group Augmented as
the CIA's action arm for Mongoose activities.

In the latter part of April, Harvey went to Miami where the CIA had its
large (at least 200 persons) JM/WAVE. Station. "As Harvey testified, in addition
to his meeting with Roselli and the delivery of the poison pills, Harvey's trip
had other totally umrelated (in Harvey's view) purposes as well:

"...this was one of a number of periodic trips for the
purpose of reviewing in toto...the actual and potential
operations at the Miami base...and this covered the whole

gamut from personnel administration, operational support
in the way of small craft [and] so on..''(Harvey, Wy

pp. 15-16). & ae

The Special Group Augmented expected to receive a report

his April trip to Miami. On April 19, 1962, while igh n Miami, Lansdale
vm

told the Special Group Augmented that: &,

ib, 2
"Upon the return of Mr. Harvey from his current field visit,
more specific information on the status of agent training
and operations should be made available." (Memorandum for

the Special Group, April 19, 1962, from Lansdale, p..____). On April 26,
1962, the Special Group Augmented was informed by Lansdale that Harvey

was in Florida “initiating a new series of agent infiltrations" and would
return to Washington on April 30. (Memorandum for the Special Group
/Kugmented/, April 26, 1962, from Lansdale.) At the Special Group meeting
on the same day General Taylor requested that Harvey "attend the next meet-—
ing and report on agent activities." (Memorandum for the Record, April 26,

1962, by McCone.) The next day, April 26, 1962, Harvey was sent a memorandum

informing him of General Taylor's request as well as the fact that McCone

wanted to meet with Harvey and Lensdale "immediately on your return to dis-

"(Memorandum for Action, Elder to Harvey, -

cuss the Task Force activities,"
April 27, 1962.)
Harvey did report to the Special Group upon his return but did not ae

mention his meeting with Roselli or the delivery of the pills and the weapons,

Harvey testified that when he reported to the Special Group,

on his trip to Miami, he did not inform them or, indeed an

in Miami, Harvey did not tell McCone of the pills,As indicated above,

Harvey did not believe it was necessary to do so. (Harvey, 7/11, p. 17.)*

jlarvey testified with respect to why he did not brief the Special Group Augmented,
: in the Following exchange:

"Q.: '...Did you believe that the White Ilouse did not
want the Special Group to know?""' 7

"A: “Well, I would have had no basis for that belief,
but I would have felt that if the White House (tasked)
this (operation to the CIA) and wanted the Special

Group to know about it, it was up to the White House :
to brief the Special Group and not up to me to brief

them, and T would have considered that T would have

“been very far out of line and would have been subject

to severe censure.'* (Harvey Tr. 7/11, p. 77)-

NW 50955 DocId:32423524 Page 186


-42-

The minutes of the May 3, 1962, Special Group Augmented meeting make no
mention of Harvey's above-related plot activities. The minutes of that meet-
ing show that on his return from Miami, Harvey gave a progress report to the
Special Group Augmented on "agent teams" and the "general field of intelli-
gence". (Harvey, Ex. 3, Memorandum of Special Group Augmented Meeting, May
1962, p. 1.) Harvey reported that three. agent teams had been infiltrated and
that 72 actual or potential reporting sources were also in place. (Harvey Ex. 3,
Daa):

Shortly after the May 3 meeting, General Taylor went to see the President to
give him what he called a "routine briefing" (Taylor Tr. , p» id):
General Taylor's memorandum of his briefing of ‘the President similarly makes
no reference to Harvey's contacts with Roselli or the delivery of pills and
guns. (Memorandum for Record May 7, 1962, by General Taylor.) Taylor testified
that he had never heard of Harvey delivering pills to poison Castro, or of any

assassination attempts. (Taylor Tr. » Pe 42.)

3. Testimony of Kennedy Administration Officials

In addition to examining the actual nature of the Mongoose operation (discussed
above at p. __), we took considerable testimony from Kennedy Administration offi-
cials.on the question of authority for a Castro assassination in the Mongoose
period. Set out in the section below is the testimony of the Kennedy Administra-
tion officials principally involved in the MOngoose operation and the Special Group
Augmented, all of whom testified the assassination plots were not authorized. These
were McCone, the Director of CIA and a member of the Special Group Augmented;

General Taylor, Chairman of the Special. Group Augmented; General Lansdale, Chief of
Operations for Mongoose; Special Group Augmented members Bundy and Gilpatric; Secre-
tary of State Rusk; and Secretary of Defense McNamara. “Their testimony focused on
the principal issues raised by Helms, including? (1) whether any authority for-a-
Castro assassination existed; and (2) whether they had Ig edee of any Castro assassi-
nation activity.* ‘

In the succeeding section we discuss the August 10, 1962, meeting where the subject
of a Castro assassination was raised.

a. Testimony of McCone

McCone testified that at no time during his service in the Kennedy Administration
as DCI (1961-1963), did President Kennedy, Robert Kennedy or any member of the Cabi-
net or White louse staff discuss with him any Castro assassination plans or operations.
(McCone, p. 44.)

As discussed above in'greater detail, McCone, the Director of Central Intelligence
and Helms immédiate superior, testified he did not authorize and was not informed
about, the assassination activity. (McCone, p. 3.)
¥*In addition, the Committee questioned the Kennedy Administration members as to the
likelihood that an assassination order might have been given to Helms by Robert
Kennedy through a "back channel", outside the normal chain of command; however,

Helms subsequently appeared and testified that no such order was ever given by
Robert Kennedy. (See p. above.)

HW 50955 Docld:32423524 Page 188


-44-
McCone pointed out that although the Cuban problem was discussed in terms

of "dispose of Castro," or "knock off Castro", these terms were meant to refer
to "the overthrow of the Communist Government in Cuba" and not a Castro assassi-

nation. (McCone; p. 44; McCone Ex. 4, memorandum April 14, 1967, to Helms.)

McCone further stated that “it is very hard for me to believe"
that Robert Kennedy would have initiated a Castro assassination activity
without consulting with the Special Group Augmented. (MeCone , p. 52).

bv. Testimony of Taylor
Taylor served as Chairman of the Special Group Augmented

during the Mongoose Operation (Taylor, 7/9, p. ). In addition, Taylor

also served as President Kennedy's Military Representative and Intelligence
Advisor after the Bay of Pigs until his eppointment as Chairman of the - ~
Joint Chiefs of Staff in November 1962 (Taylor, 7/9, p- 3 Bundy, 7/11,
p. 25).

i Taylor testified that a Castro assassination plan was
"never" submitted to the Special Group Augmented, either orally or in
writing. (Taylor, p. 41). Taylor further testified that he and the
Special Group Augmented were never told of the passage of the poison
pills to Roselli in April 1962, and that the passage of these pills
without the knowledge of the Special Group Augmented was "entirely,
completely out of /the/ context and character of the way the /Special
Group Augmented/ operated or the way it would accept" that an operation
was properly authorized. (Taylor, p. 43). And Taylor testified that
although the Special Group Augmented was "certainly anxious for the

downfall of Castro" an “assassination never came up" in the meetings

and discussions of the Special Group Augmented. (Taylor, p. 62).

With respect to whether President Kennedy or Robert

Kennedy or Robert Kennedy might have bypassed the Special Group Aue-

RW 50955  Docla: F¥axebs° wef ghgectly with Helms or CIA officers to assassinate


: - 49 -
Castro, Taylor testified that this would have been “entirely con-
tradictory to every method of operation I ever saw on the part of
the President and his brother.” (Taylor, p. 45). Taylor stated "the
President and-the Attorney General would never have gone around" the
Special Group Augmented. (Taylor, p. 49).

Although Taylor acknowledged that Robert Kennedy
frequently pushed for more direct action during Mongoose, Taylor
stated that "there was no suggestion [ot] assassination" in these urgings.
(Taylor, p. 67). Taylor testified that Robert Kennedy dealt directly
with Lansdale outside Special Group Augmented channels “only for the
purpose of imparting his own sense of urgency" but "never" would
Robert Kennedy have done so on substantive issues:

"Senator Hart of Colorado: But on substantive issues,
he wouldn't, in effect, been dealing behind your back?"

"General Taylor: Never. Never. That was not his way."
(Taylor, p. 53). _*/

c. Testimony of Lansdale
Lansdale testified that he "was very certain" that

he never discussed a Castro assassination with either President Kennedy

The evidence, showed, however, that there were oc
Attorney General dealt with those concered with Mongoose without
consulting General Taylor. For example, as discussed in greater d
tail (in the section on Mongoose operations) on January 18, 1962.5,
General Lansdale sent a copy of his program review to Rohert Kenedy A
attached to which was a cover memorandum indicating that other "'sénsi-
tive work'' not in the review was to be dealt with only between the
President, the Attorney General, and Lansdale. The natiire of that
work (which Lansdale testified involved political contacts in the Cuba
exile comunity) is discussed at p. above. bi

sions when the

or Robert Kennedy:
“The Chairman: You do not recall ever having discussed with
the Attorney General a plan or a proposal to assassinate
Fidel Castro?"
"General Lansdale: No. And I am very certain Senator, that
” such a discussion never came up...neither with the Attorney
General or the President." (Lansdale, p. 18.)*
Lansdale. further testified that the plausible deniability concept had no part
in the fact that he never discussed a Castro assassination with President Kennedy
or the Attorney General.** Lansdale testified that he "had doubts" that assassina-
tion was a “useful action, and one which I had never employed in the past, and dur-
ing work in copying with revolutions and I had considerable doubts as to its utility
and I was trying to be very pragmatic." (Lansdale, p. 31.) ‘When asked if he thought
the President was not aware of efforts to depose Castro and his government by any

means including assassination, Lansdale answered''"I am certain he was aware of ef-

forts to dispose of the Castro regime. I am really not one to guess what he knew ©

of assassinations, because I. don't know." (Id., p. 32.)
With regard to the Castro assassination attempts, Lansdale testified that
Harvey "never" told him that Harvey was attempting to assassinate Castro. (Lansdale,

p. 24.) Lansdale stated:

"Ihad no knowledge of such a thing. TI know of no order
or permission for such a thing and I was given no infor-

mation at all that such a thing was foing on by people
who I have now learned were involved with it."

(Lansdale, p. 58). aS

__*/ Thus, when Lansdale was questioned about the "touchdown plays"
(discussed in detail above at p.  ), there was this testimony:

Senator Baker: Now do you completely rule out the ieee
that the touchdown play had to do with the possible assassination
efforts against Fidel Castro?” tee

“General Lansdale: Yes ... I never discussed, nor conceived, nor.
received orders about an assassination of Castro with my dealings 2
with either the Attorney General or the President."

**/ "Senator Baker: Is that the reason you didn't, because-of thes >”
principle of deniability?" Nh

"General Lansdale: No, it wasn't. The subject never game up,
iy

and I had no reason to bring it up with him. co

HW 50955 DocId:32423524 Page 191


47
As discussed below in detail at pp___, after the subject
of a Castro assassination was raised at the August 10, 1962 meeting of the
Special Group Augmented, Lansdale directed Harvey to prepare a plan for the
"Liquidation" of cuban leaders. However, no such plan was ever prepared and,
as the IG Report concluded, the August 10 meeting was "unrelated to any actual

attempts at assassination." (IG, p. 118).

With respect to the possibility that Robert Kennedy
might have by-passed the SGA and Lansdale to deal directly with Agency
officials on a Castro assassination, Lansdale testified:

"T never knew of a direct Tine of communication
between the President or the Attorney General and Harvey
apart from me on this...." -

During the course of the Committee's investigation
into these allegations of assassination efforts by the U.S, government,
however, General Lansdale spoke with several reporters concerning the
subject of a Castro assassination plan in 1y62. Lansdale's comments vv
the reporters are dealt with helow in connection with the August iu,

1962, meeting of the Special Group.

_*/ "Senator Huddleston: You never had any reason to believe that
the Attorney General had dealt directly with Mr. Harvey?"

“General Lansdale: I hadn't known about that at all, no...

“Senator Huddleston: ...You have no reason to believe that he
might have broached (a Castro assassination) with the Attorney
General?"

"General Lansdale: I wouldn't know that -- I certainly didn't ¢
know it." oe

"Senator Huddleston: You had no reason to believe “that there
was any kind of activity going on in relatién,‘to*Cuba® outside
of what you were proposing or what was coming \before\ the Special
Group?" eee

"General Lansdale: No, I was supposed to know it all, and I
had no indication that I did not know it all (except for one
operation by Harvey unrelated to assassinations)."

d. Testimony of Bundy

Bundy served as President Kennedy's Special Assistant
for National Security Affairs throughout the Kennedy Administration.
(Bundy, p. 2). In addition, Bundy participated in the planning that
led to the creation of Operation Mongoose and was a member of the
Special Group Augmented. (Bundy, pp. 34, 87).

Bundy testified that the matter of a Castro assassination
was "mentioned from time to time” over the period 1961-1963 but "never to
me that I can recall by the President." (Bundy, a 73). Bundy emphasized

that the question came up "as. something tO talk about rather than to -

consider." (Bundy, p. 73.)

Bundy testified that it was his conviction that "no
one in the Kennedy Administration, in the White House ... ever gave
any authorization, approval, or instruction of any kind for any effort
to assassinate anyone by the CIA." (Bundy, p. 54). Bundy testified
that he knew and worked on an intimate basis with both President Kennedy
and Robert Kennedy during the entire Kennedy Administration, and testi-

fied that it was "incredible" that they would have authorized a Castro

HW 50955 DocId:32423524 Page 193


HW 50955

- 49 -

assassination, either explicitly or implicitly as a result of pressure

they exerted in the anti-Castro effort:

"The Chairman: Based upon that acquaintanceship, do you
believe, under any of the circumstances that occurred
during that whole period, either one of them would have
authorized the assassination of Fidel Castro?"

"Mr, Bundy: I most emphatically do not ... If you Have

heard testimony that there was pressure to do something

about Cuba, there was. There was an effort, both from the

President in his style and from the Attorney General in

his style to keep the government active in looking for

ways to weaken the Cuban regime. There was. But if you,

as I understand it, and not even those who pressed the

matter most closely as having essentially been inspired s
by the White House caf tell you that anyone ever said to

them, go and kill anyone.

Let me say one other thing about these two men, and
that is that there was something that they really wanted done,
they did not leave people in doubt, so that on the one
hand, I would say about their character, their purposes,
and their nature and the way they confronted international cant
affairs that I find it incredible that they would have
ordered or authorized explicitly or implicitly an assassi-
nation of Castro, I also feel that if, contrary to every-
thing that I know about their character, they had had such a
decision and such a purpose, people would not have been in
any doubt about it." (Tr. 98-99).

Bundy was asked "have you any way to poe to the Com-
mittee, as to why Mr. Helms would testify that he...had no doubts,
that the Agency was fully authorized to proceed to not only develop
schemes, but a engage in active eereuped to assassinate Castro?"
Bundy replied: "I have no explanation of that." (Bundy, pp. 99-100)

Bundy further testified that despite the extreme sense of
urgency that arose during the Cuban Missile Crisis, Castro's assassi~
nation was never discussed, and it was "totally inconsistent" with the
policies and actions taken by the President and Robert Kennedy in that

an

DocId:32423524 Page 194


~ 50 -

crisis for them to have authorized a Castro assassination. (Bundy, p. 95,
97-98) .*

“Bundy further stated that he was never told by anyone that assassination
efforts were underway against Castro, that underworld figures were hired by
the CIA in this regard, or that Ilarvey was engaged in Castro assassination ac-
tivity. (Bundy, p. 63.)

Bundy testified that he heard about the concept of "executive action"
"Some time in the early months of 1961". (Bundy, 7/11/75, p. 4.) But since
this was presented to him as an untargeted capability only he did not "dis-
courage or dissuade" the person who briefed him on this. (Bundy, p. 4, 7, 10.)
When asked if he had any recollection of any specific covert plans that involved

poisons in conjunction with activities against Cuba, Bundy stated

"T have no recollection of any specific plan. I do
have a very vague, essentially refreshed recollection
that I heard. the word poison at some point in connec-
tion with a. possibility of action in Cuba. But that
is as far as I have deen able to take it in my own oA

memory. (Bundy, p. 42).
Bundy stated further that this recollection relating to poison involved a

proposal that seemed "impractical" because it was going to kill a large group

of people in a headquarters mess, or something of that sort." (Bundy,p.42-43),

_*/ Bundy stated:

the most important point I want to mak “is that

I find the notion that they separately, privatély encouraged,
ordered, arranged efforts at assassination totally incon- -
sistent with what I knew of both of them. And, as an
example, I would cite -- and one among very many -- the role
played by the Attorney General in the Missile Crisis, because
it was he who, most emphatically, argued against a so-called
surgical air strike or any other action that would bring
death upon many, in favor of the more careful approach which
was eventually adopted by the President in the form of a
quarantine or a blockade." (Bundy, p. 98).

HW 50955 DocId:32423524 Page 195


-ol-.

is With respect to the possibility that Robert Kennedy
may have authorized assassination outside of Special Group Augmented
channels; Bundy stated that although Robert Kennedy did spur people
to greater effort during Mongoose, "he never took away from the
existing channel of authority its authority or responsibility."
(Bundy, pp..47-48). Bundy further testified that there existed be-
tween Robert Kennedy and Maxwell Taylor (the Special Group Augmented
Chairman) "a-relation of real trust and confidence." In view of this

relation, Bundy stated it was his opinion that Robert Kennedy would

not have by-passed Taylor to develop a "back-channel" relationship

with someone else to assassinate Castro. “(Bundy, p. 87).

e.. Testimony of MacNamara

MacNamara served as Secretary of Defense throughout

HW 50955 Docld:32423524 Page 196


- 52 -

McNamara stated that. he had no knowledge or information of any nroposal

mnedy or

for the assassination of Premier Castro coming from President
Robert Kennedy, (‘cNamara, 7/11/75, p. 4.) He did note that "we were hysteri-

cal about Castro at the time of the Bay of Pigs and thereafter, aml that there

was pressure from (President Kennedy and Robert Kennedy) to-do something about

Castro. But I don't believe we contemplated assination. We did, however,

contemplate overthrow." (McNamara, p. 93.)

There occurred during McNamara's testimony an exchange which is appropriate

to set out in full because of the manner in which it captures the dilemma posed

by the evidence on the question of authority:

"The Chairman. We also have received evidence from
your senior associates that they never participated in
the authorization of an assassination attempt against
Castro nor ever directed the CIA to undertake such
attempts.

We have much testimony establishing the chain of
command where covert action was concerned, and all of
it has been to the effect that the Special Group or
the Special Group Augmented had full charge of covert
operations, and that in that chain of command any proposal
of ‘this character or any other proposal having to do
with covert operations being directed against the
Castro regime, or against Castro personally, were to
be laid before the Special Group Augmented and were not
to be undertaken except with the authority of that
group and at thé direction of that group.

Now, at the same time we know from the evidence
that the CIA was in fact engaged during the period
in a series of attempts to assassinate’ Castro.

Now, you see what we are faced with is this dilemma.

Z Either the CIA was a rogue elephant rampaging out off

control, over which no effective direction was being
given in this matter of assassination, or there wis

HW 50955 DocId:32423524 Page 197


- 53 -

some secret channel circumventing the whole structure
of command by which the CIA and certain officials in
the CIA were authorized to proceed with assassination
plots and assassination attempts against Castro.. Or the
- ‘third and final point that I can think of is that
somehow these officials of the CIA who were so engaged
misunderstood or misinterpreted their scope of authority.
Now it is terribly important, if there is any way that we
can find out which of these three points represented what
actually happened. That is the nature, that is the ~. s
quandary.
Now, is there anything. that you can tell us that would
assist us in finding an answer to this central question?

Mr. McNamara. I can only tell you what will further your
uneasiness. Because I have stated before and I believe
today that the CIA was a highly disciplined organization,
fully under the contrel-of senior officials-of the govern-
ment, so much so that I feel as a senior official of the
government I must assume responsibility for the actions
of the two, putting assassination aSide just for the
moment. But I know of no major action taken by CIA during
the time I was in the government that was not properly
authorized by senior officials. And when I say that I
want to emphasize also that I believe with hindsight we -
authorized actions that were contrary to the interest of the
Republic but I don't want it on the record that the CIA
was uncontrolled, was operating with its own authority
and we can be absolved of responsibility for what CIA
did, again with exception of assassination, again which
I say I never heard of.
The second point you say that you have, you know that
CIA was engaged in a series of attempts of assassination.
I think to use your words. I don't know that. I accept
the fact that you do and that you have information I was
not aware of. I find that impossible to reconcile. I just
can't understand how it could have happened and I don't
accept the third point, that they operated on the basis
of minunderstanding, because it séems to me that the

days without the senior members know it, and I understand the contradiction that
this carries with respect to the face." (McNamara, p. 4.) He further emphasized
that for the President or Robert Kennedy to have approved a Castro assassination
was "totally inconsistent with everything I know about the two men." (McNamara
p. 90.)
f. Testimony of Gilpatric
Gilpatric served as Deputy Secretary of Defense throughout the Kennedy Admini-
stration. (Gilpatric, p. 5; Gilpatric Ex. 1, p. 5.) In that capacity, Gilpatric
represented the Department of Defense as a member of the Special Group and the
Special Group Augmented during the Mongoose operation. “Gilpatric, p. 5.)
Gilpatric testified Chat he understood the mandate of
the Special Group during Mongoose was not to kill Castro, but to "so under-
mine, SO disrupt the Cuban system under Castro that it could not be «
effective."* (Gilpatric, p. 28). Gilpatric emphasized that "it was the

system we had to deal with" and words such as “set rid of Castro" were

* Initially in his first appearances before the Committee Mr. Gilpatric
was unable to recall any. of the events or characters involved in Operation
Mongoose. He failed to recall that General Lansdale was the Chief of
Operations for the project, or Lansdale's involvement in the Special
Group Augmented even though Gilpatric recommended Lansdale for pro~ :
motion to Brigadier General. Gilpatric testified that the lapse of time,
approximately fifteen years, had impaired his memory on these events.
(Gilpatric, pp. 6-9.) (Insert possible proposed additional language by
Smothers.) .

HW 50955 DocId:32423524 Page 199

Gilpatric said that he knew of no express restriction
that would have barred the killing of, Castro. But Gilpatic testified that
he understood “There were limits on the use of power" and that these pre-
gluded the use of assassination. (Gilpatric, p. 31). Thus, while Gil-
patric said that it was "perfectly possible" that one might reasonably
“have inferred assassination was authorized, nevertheless, the limits on
action set down by the Special Group Augmented would have “~
required that specific efforts be made by one receiving general instructions
to clarify whether those instructions authorized assassination.*/ He added
that "within our charter, $0 to speak, the one thing that was off limits
was military invasion." (Id. p. 45). In this context of the ionzoose
charter, Gilpatric, when asked whether th® "killing of Castro by a para~ .
military group (would) have been within bounds." he responded, "I know of
no restriction. that would have barred it." (Id.) In response to a ques-
tion as to whether there was any concern for the limits on the activities
of personnel involved in these raids and infiltration efforts, Gilpatric
said: "No, to the contrary. The complaint that the Attorney General had,
if we assume he was reflecting the President's views on it, /was that/ the
steps taken by the CIA up to that point, /and/ their plans were too petty,
were too minor, they weren't massive enough, they weren't going to be ef-

fective enough." (Id., p. 47.) iowever, aS discussed above at p. a

activities, and although once such agents were inside Cyba}*they could not

be “effectively controlled," the Group would make "every effort...to attempé

such control."

#/ In Gilpatric's testimony, there was the following exchange:

"Senator Huddleston:...1t's on the basis of these words that’ «
everybody admits were used, like replace or get rid of, on “®
the basis of these kinds of conversation alone that /Helms/ &

was firmly convinced and that apparently went right down

had the authority to move against the life of a head of state.

Gilpatric testified that "it was not unusual" for Presi-
dent Kennedy and Robert Kennedy to deal directly with people at various
‘levels in the Executive Branch. (Gilpatric, p. 58). With respect to Mon-
goose, Cilpatric said that. Robert Kennedy was thé “moving spirit" (Gil-

patric, p. 11). But Cilpatric stated that Robert Kennedy's role was "pvin-

cipally to spur us on, to get going, get cracking." (Cilpatric, p. 47). Thus,
although Robert Kennedy frequently complained that the plans of the CIA and
Mongoose weren't "massive enough" and that "we should get in there and

do more," Gilpatric pointed out that Robert Kennedy was not making specific -
proposals in these urgings, and the result he desired was a general one

"to limit the Castro regime's effectiveness," rather than any specific measure.

(Gilpatric, p» 47).

Augmented meetings during the Mongoose operation. (Rusk, p. __).

ment operate that way in all areas or not, but if they do then it seems

Rusk testified that he had never been informed of any
Castro assassination plans or undertakings and had no knowledge of any
such activity, (Rusk, p. 52).

Rusk further testified that he found it "very hard to
believe" that President Kennedy or Robert Kennedy would have, in the course
of urging action against Castro, sanctioned the use of any measure against
Castro.*/ Rusk said that, while it was "possible" that a person, in good
faith, might have thought specific courses of action were authorized from
the emphasis given to taking action against Castro, nevertheless Rusk testi-
fied that with respect to a Castro assassintion,

"It would have been an abuse of theePresident and the
Attorney General if somebody had thought they were

Kennedy might have communicated directly. with Helms or Harvey on a Castro
assassination effort, Rusk testified that, based on his experience and the

h. ‘Testimony of Sorensen

oo Sorenseh served as a Special Assistant to President Kennedy during
the entire Kennedy Administration. Sorensen was a member of the National Security

Council Executive Committee that dealt with the Missile Crisis, although he

was not involved with Mongoose.
Sorensen testified that in his daily personal meetings with the
President and at all the National Security Council meetings he attended, there

was "not at any time any mention -~ much less approval by. him -- of any U.S.- -

sponsored plan to assassinate any foreign leaders" (Sorensen, p. 4). Based
upon his close contact. with President Kennedy, Sorensen stated that it was his

opinion that:

"such an act (as assassination) was totally foreign to his
character and conscience, foreign to his fundamental reverence
for human life and his respect for his adversaries, foreign to
his insistence upon a moral dimension in U.S. foreign policy
and his concern for his country's reputation abroad, and
foreign to his pragmatic recognition that so horrendous but
inevitably counter-productive a precedent committed by a
country whose own chief. of state was inevitably vulnerable."

r, The August 10, 1962 Meeting

As indicated above (see p. __.), the question of a Castro assassination
was raised at a meeting of the Special Group Augmented on August 10, 1962.
Thereafter, on August 13, 1962, Lansdale directed Harvey to include in a
proposed plan for Phase II of Mongoose a plan for the "liquidation of leaders"
as an option. .We took considerable testimony and examined the documents
relating to the August 10 meeting, the nature of the discussion of a Castro
assassination, andLansdale's subsequent request for a contingency plan.

At’ the outset, it should be noted that the documents and testimony
showed that discussion of a Castro assassination at che “Agust 10, 1962 meeting
had no connection to the assassination activityeundertaken by Harvey and
Roselli, or any other Castro assassination plans or efforts. As the CIA
Inspector General found:

"The subject (of a Castro assassination) was raised
at a meeting at State on 10 August 1962, but it is
unrelated to any actual attempts at assassination.
It did result in a MONGOOSE action memorandum by
Lansdale assigning to CIA action for planning
liquidation of leaders. (IG, p. 118).

The finding of the Inspector General is supported both by the chrono-
logy of the Castro. assassination efforts and the testimony of Harvey. The
chronology shows that it was three months prior to the August 10, 1962.meet-
ing that Harvey gave Roselli the poison pills for use against Castro, and
that shortly thereafter (and well before August 10, 1962) Harvey was informed
that the pills were inside Cuba. (see p. above). Moreover, after the
August 10, 1962 meeting there was no Castro assassination activity during

the remainder of 1962. (see p. above).

In addition, Harvey (who attended the August 10, 1962 meeting and

DocId:32423524 Page 204


-66-

recalled that the question of a Castro assassination was raised) declared
that the discussion was not related to his assassination activity with Ro-
selli, (Harvey, 7/11,. pp. 48-50). Harvey further testified that he did not
view the August 10, 1962, discussion of a Castro assassination as authoriza-
tion for the Roselli operation because "the authority, as I understood it,
for this particular operation went back long before the formation’ of the

Special Group Augmented. (Harvey,:7/1l, p. 49).

1. The Contemporaneous Documents

a, Lansdale's Ausust 13,1962 Memorandum

Following the August 10, 1962 meeting, Lansdale sent a memorandum on
August 13, 1962, to Harvey and the other members: of Lansdale's interagency
working group.*/ (Lansdale Ex. 15, Memorandum from Lansdale, August 13, 1962).
The Memorandum began by stating: "In compliance with the desires and guidance
expressed in the August 10 policy meeting on Operation Mongoose, we will
produce an outline of an alternate Course B for submission." (Lansdale
Ex.:15, p. 1).

Lansdale further set out his concept of what was required: "I be-
lieve the paper need contain only a statement of objectives and a list of
implementing activities. The list of activities will be under the heading
of: Intelligence, Political, Economic, Psychological, Paramilitary, and

Military." (Lansdale Ex. 15, p. 1).

* In addition to Harvey, copies of Lansdale's August 13, 1962, memorandum were
sent to Robert Hurwitch (State Dept), Gen. Benjamin Harris (Defense Dept)-.and
Don Wilson (U.S. Information Agency). (Lansdale Ex. 15.)

In his testimony, Gen Harris identified a document drafted by the Mongoose Work-
ing Group in the Defense Dept shortly before the August 10 meeting. The document
listed a number of steps that could be taken in the event of.an intensified Mon-
goose program that might involve U. S. military intervention. One such step was
“assassinate Castro and his handful of top men."' (Harris Ex. 4.) Gen. Harris
stated that this was "not out of the ordinary in terms of contingency planning...
it's one of the things you look at. (Harris, p. 37.) There was no evidence that
this document was distributed outside the Defense Dept's Mongoose working group.

HW 50955 DocId:32423524 Page 205


-61-

Lansdale's memorandum then assigned to Harvey papers on the following
subjects by the means of the following passage, which contained a deleted
phrase:

"Mr. Harvey: Intelligence, Political, /words deleted/,
Economic, (sabotage, limited deception), and Paramilitary."
(Lansdale, Ex. 15, p- 1).
According to a memorandum by Harvey to Helms the following day, August
14, 1962, the words deleted from the above-quoted passage were "including

liquidation of leaders." (Lansdale Ex. 16, Memorandum by Harvey, August 4,

1962, to Helms).

b. Harvey's August 14, 1962 Memorandum

When Harvey received Lansdale's August 13 memorandum, Harvey wrote .
a memorandum to Helms attaching a copy of Lansdale's August 13 Memorandum, anc
noting that Harvey had excised the words "including liquidation of leaders."

(Lansdale Ex. 16, Memorandum, August 14, 1962, from Harvey to Helms). Har-

vey's Memorandum stated:

"The question of assassination, particularly of
Fidel Castro, was brought up by Secretary McNamara
at the meeting of the Special Group (Augmented) in
Secretary Rusk's office on 10 August. It was the
obvious consensus at that meeting, in answer to a
comment by Mr. Ed Murrow, that this is not a sub-
ject which has been made a matter of official
record. I took careful notes on the comments at
this meeting on this point, and the Special Group
(Augmented) is not expecting any written comments
or study on this. point. (Lansdale Ex. 16).

- Harvey's memorandum further stated that, on receipt of Lansdale's
memorandum, Harvey. had called Lansdale's office and pointed out "the inad-

missibility and stupidity of putting this type of comment in writing in such

HW 50955 DocId:32423524 Page 206


NW 50955

~62-

a document," and that the CIA "would write no document pertaining to this
and would participate in no open meeting discussing it." (Lansdale Ex. 16,

p- 1);

c. The Minutes of the August 10, 1962 Meeting

The minutes of the August 10 meeting contain no reference to the sub-

ject of a Castro assassination. (Memorandum for Record, Special Group Aug~
mented Meeting, August 10, 1962, by Parrott, hereafter referred to as the

"August 10 Minutes"). _Parrott, the author of the August 10 Minutes, testi-

fied that he did not recall a discussion of assassination at that meeting, :
but the fact that the minutes-do not reflect such a discussion is not an
indication that the matter did not come up. (Parrott, p. 34). Parrott
pointed out that his minutes "were not intended to be a verbatim transcript

of everything that was said," since the purpose of his minutes was "to zeit

interpret what the decisions were and to record those and to use’ them as
a useful action document." (Parrott, 34-35). Parrott testified:
"we had 15 or 16 people (at the August 10, 1962
meeting)...all of them well informed, all of
them highly articulate.
This meeting, as I recall, went on for several
hours...Now I'm sure that particularly in a
group like this that there were a great many
proposals made that were just shot down
immediately." (Parrott, p. 34-35).
Parrott further testified that he did not record proposals that were
- quickly rejected at the August 10 meeting. (Parrott, p. 35). Parrott
stated that, although he had no recollection of a discussion of Castro's

assassination at the August 10 meeting, he would infer from the related

DocId:32423524 Page 207


-63-
documents (the Lansdale and Harvey Memoranda of August 13 and 14) that the
subject was raised but "it never got off the ground....Therefore, I did not
record it." (Parrott, p. 35).

The documents and testimony of Parrott suggest several possible in-
ferences with respect to the nature of the discussion of a Castro assassination
at the August 10 meeting. First, as indicated by the Lansdale ant Harvey
memorandum, it is possible that a contingency plan was requested but that it
was decided not to make this "a matter of official record." (Lansdale
Ex. 16, p- 1). However, if it had been decided to commission a written
contingency plan, as Lansdale requested Harvey prepare, it is difficult to
see how this request could have been reconciled-with a decision to make to
written record.

Second, it is possible that, as Parrott's testimony indicated, the
subject was raised but quickly rejected. This inference is apparently con-
sistent with the fact that the subject did not appear in Parrott's minutes,
and perhaps, although less so, with Harvey's August 14 Memorandum. Harvey's
Memorandum states that the Special Group Augmented “is not expecting any
written comments cr study on this point." (Lansdale Ex. 16, p. 1).

Before turning to the testimony on these questions, we discuss the
context of the August 10 discussion of a Castro assassination as reflected

in the minutes of the August 10 Meeting.

- d.. The August 10 Meeting

The August 10 Meeting was held to decide upon a further course of action

to succeed the intelligence collection phase of Mongoose which was scheduled

to conclude in August. (McCone, p. 34). As a policy meeting, there were in

HW 50955 DocId:32423524 Page 208


~6h-

attendance a larger number of officials than usually participated in Special
Group Augmented meetings. The Meeting was chaired by Secretary of State
Rusk fand held in his. office), and attended by a total of 15 officials,
including the principals of the agencies taking part in Mongoose, i-.e.,
Secretary Rusk, Secretary McNamara, CIA Director McCone, and USIA Director
Murrow, . ae

At the August 10 meeting, General Lansdale proposed that a "stepped-up
Course B" be adopted for Mongoose, (August 10 Minutes, p. __). This plan
involved operations to "exert all possible diplomatic, economic, psychologi-
cal, and cther overt pressures to overthrow the Castro-Cémmunist regime, without —
overt employment of U.S. military." (Memorandum for Special Group Augmented,
August 8, 1962, p. 1).

However, the Special Group Augmented decided against consideration of
the "stepped-up Course B". In the discussion of Lansdale's Course B proposal,
Rusk "emphasized the desirability of attempting to create a split between
Castro and old-line Communists". (August 10 Minutes, p. 2). In addition,
McNamara questioned whether the practice of building up agents in Cuba would
not lead to actions that "would hurt the U.S. in the eyes of world opinion".
(August 10 Minutes, p. 2) (A remark which seems inconsistent with McNamara
at the same Meeting raising the question of assassination in any sense of
advocacy). The Minutes state that McNamara's concern "led to the suggestion

by General Taylor that we should consider changing the overall objective
of Mongoose/ from one of overthrowing the Castro regime" to one of causing

its failure. (August 10 Minutes, p. 2).

Hence, in lieu of Lansdale's "stepped-up Course B", the Special Group

HW 50955 DocId:32423524 Page 209


HW 50955

Augmented chose a plan advanced by McCone that assumed Castro's continuance

in power and had the more limited objective of splitting off Castro from

“old-line Communists".* (August 10 Minutes, -p. 2). The decision and "action"

of the Special Group Augmented at the August 10 meeting was stated as follows:

“The principal members of the Special Group felt,
after some discussion, that the CIA variant should
be developed further for consideration at next Thurs=
day's meeting of the Special Group. McCone was asked
to stress economic sabotage, and to emphasize
measures to foment a Castro-oldline Communist split."
(August Memorandum, p. 2).

RRR

“Action to be take

CIA to prepare a new version of ies variant plan,
in accordance with the above-summarized discussion.
This should be ready by Wednesday, August 15."
(August 10 Memorandum, p. 3).

It was therefore in this context that Lansdale's August 13 Memorandum

to Harvey stated that "in compliance with the desires and guidance expressed

in the August 10 policies meeting on Operation Mongoose, we will produce an

outline of an alternate Course B. "Indeed, pursuant-to the August 10 decision

to adopt McCone!'s proposal for a-more limited plan that assumed Castro's

continuation in power, Lansdale's memorandum stated that a CIA paper titled

“Operational Plan (Reduced Effort) will be used as the starting basis."

(Lansdale Ex. 15, p. 1).

The August 10 Minutes show that McCone pointed out that the stepped-up
Course B "will risk inviting an uprising, which might result in a Hungary
type blood bath if unsupported". (August 10 Minutes, p. 2). McCone
“emphasized that the stepped-up plan should not be undertaken unless the
U.S. is prepared to accept attributability for the necessary actions,
including the eventual use of military force’. (August 10 Minutes). The
August 10 Minutes further stated that, in McCone's view, the CIA variant
"would avoid all of these dangers because it would not invite an uprising".
(August 10 Minutes, p. 2).

In view of the issues raised by these documents we took testimony
from the principal participants in that meeting. In particular, we discuss
below, the testimony as to whether Lansdale's request for an assassination
plan reflected the desire of the SGA or was contemplated by the SGA's decision
to proceed with a plan of "reduced effort" that posited Castro's continuance

in power.

2. The Testimony
As set out below, Harvey, McCone, and Goodwin recall the question of
a Castro assassination was raised_at the August 10 meeting.* We discuss
that testimony, first with respect to the August 10 meeting itself, and,

second, with regard to the action that followed that meeting.

a. Testimony as to the August 10 Meeting
(1) Testimony of McCone

McCone testified that the question of a "liquidation" or removal of
Castro and other Cuban leaders arose at the August 10 meeting in the context
of "exploring the alternatives that were available" for the next phase of
Mongoose. (McCone, p. 33). McCone testified that he did not recall who
made this suggestion, but that he and Mr. Murrow took "strong exception"
to the suggestion. A memorandum of McCone's recollection of the August 10

Meeting, written in 1967,

states:

*/ Other participants (Rusk, McNamara, Bundy, and Gilpatric) did not recall
the August 10 discussion.

*k/ On April 14, 1967, after McCone left the CIA, he dictated a memorandum

~~ of his recollection regarding the August 10, 1962 meeting. The memoran-
dum was prompted by a telephone call from the newspaper columnist, Jack
Anderson, who at that time was preparing a column on Castro assassination
(Continued on the following page.)

DocIda:32423524 Page 211


"I took immediate exception to this suggestion,
stating that the subject was completely out of
bounds as far as the USG (U.S. Government) and
CIA were concerned and the idea should not be
“ discussed nor should it appear in any papers,
as the USG could not consider such actions on
moral or ethical grounds." (McCone Ex. 4).

McCone testified that there was no decision at the August 10 meeting
that assassination should not be part of any program, but that "the subject
was just dropped" after his objection. (McCone, p. ). McCone's 1967
memorandum stated that

"At no time did the suggestion receive serious
consideration by the.Special Group (Augmented)

nor by any individual responsible for policy."
(McCone, Ex. 4).

(2) Testimony of Harvey

Harvey's testimony that the August 10 discussion was unrelated to any
actual Castro assassination activity is discussed above (see p. __.). With
respect to that discussion itself, Harvey testified that it was his recollection
that the question of a Castro assassination was raised by Secretary McNamara.
(Harvey, p. 30). Harvey said it’ was his impression that McNamara raised the
question as one of “shouldn't we consider the elimination or assassination"

of Castro. (Harvey, p. 30).

With respect to the reaction of the Special Group Augmented to this

(Footnote continued from the previous page.)

attempts, implicating President Kennedy and Robert Kennedy. After talking
with Anderson on the telephone, at Robert Kennedy's request, McCone dic-
tated the April 14, 1967 memorandum, which stated that at one of several
Mongoose meetings on August 8, 9 or 10, 1962, "I recall a suggestion being
made to liquidate top people in the Castro regime, including Castro."

suggestion, Harvey testified:

"I think the consensus of the Group was to sweep
that particular proposal or suggestion or question
or consideration off the record and under the rug
as rapidly as possible. There was no extensive
discussion of it, no discussion, no back and forth
as the whys. and wherefores and possibilities and
so on."

(Harvey, p. 30).

(3) Testimony of Coodwin

Goodwin testified that he had a recollection of "limited certainty"

that the subject of a Castro assassination was raised at the August 10

meeting.*/
Goodwin testified that "I am unable to say with any certainty who it
was" who raised the subject of a Castro assassination at the August 10

meeting. (Goodwin, 7/18, p. 8)**/

*/ In a staff interview prior to his testimony, Goodwin recalled the date
of the meeting at which a Castro assassination was raised as falling in
early 1961, after the Bay of Pigs. (Memorandum of Staff Interview with
Goodwin, May 27, 1975, p. 2). After reviewing the Minutes of the August
10, 1962 meeting and the Lansdale and Harvey memoranda of August 13 and
14, respectively, Goodwin testified that he had "misplaced the date of
the meeting in my own memory." (Goodwin, 7/18, p. 7). In placing the
incident on August 10, 1962, Goodwin stated

"Now, of course, you know, it may not be. That's the best
recollection I now have. It's a little better than the earlier
one, but it's not certain." (Goodwin, 7/18, p. 8).

*k/In a magazine article in June 1975, Goodwin was quoted as stating that
at one of the meetings of a White House task force on Cuba it was McNamara
- who "said that Castro's assassination was the only productive way of deal-
ing with Cuba." (Branch and Crile, "The Kennedy Vendetta," Harpers,
July, 1975, p. 61). In his testimony on July 18, 1975, Goodwin stated:
"that's not an exact quote" in the article, and explained further: 4
(Footnote continued on following page.)

(4) ‘Testimony of McNamara
McNamara testified that, although he had no recollection of the question
of a Castro assassination being raised at the August 10 meeting, he did

express opposition to any assassination attempt or plan when he spoke with
McCone several days after the August 10 meeting. (McNamara, p. 7,8).
McNamara's testimony with respect to his conversation with McCone“is dis-

cussed below with the testimony as to actions after the August 10 meeting.

b. Testimony as to Actions After the August 10, 1962 Meeting

(1) Testimony of McCone suit ae

McCone testified that he called McNamara after he received Lansdale's

August 13 Memorandum and,

"insisted that that Memorandum be withdrawn
because no decision was made on this subject, and
since no decision was made, then Lansdale was
quite out of order in tasking the Central In-
telligence Agency to consider the matter."*/

(Footnote continued from the previous page.)

"I didn't tell (the author of the magazine article)
that it was definitely McNamara, that’ very possibly it
was McNamara. He asked me about McNamara's role, and
I said it very well could have been McNamara."
(Goodwin, 7/18, p. 33).

If Goodwin's recollection was as uncertain as he swore it was in his
testimony, it is difficult to understand how he could have spoken in the terms
he testified he did to the author of the magazine article, particularly in
view of Goodwin's statement that “it's not:a light matter to perhaps destroy

_ a man's career on the basis of a fifteen year old memory of a single sentence
that he might_have said at a meeting without substantial certainty in your
own mind /and/ I do not have that." (Goodwin, pp. 34-35).

*/ McCone's 1967 Memorandum stated:

"Immediately after the meeting, I called on Secretary McNamara
personally and re-emphasized my position, in which he heartily
agreed. I did this. because Operation Mongoose--an interdepartmental
affair--was under the operational control of (the Defense Depart-
ment)... (McCone Ex. 4).

HW 50955 Docld:32423524 Page 214


-70-

McCone also testified that McNamara agreed that the Lansdale Memorandum
should be withdrawn for the. same reason expressed by McCone, i.e. because the
topic of a Castro assassination had not been given consideration by the Special

Group Augmented. (McCone, p. 39).

(2) Testimony of Harvey

As discussed above (see p.___) Harvey's Memorandum of August 14, 1962
states that upon receiving Lansdale's August 13 Memorandum, Harvey demanded
that Lansdale excise the words referring to “liquidation of leaders." Har-
vey's Memorandum further stated that "the Special Group (Augmented) is not
expecting any written comments or study on this point." This latter passage
raises the issue whether Harvey meant to state fee the Special Cra Aug-

mented authorized a Castro assassination plan or activity but that no written

record should be made. In his testimony, Harvey clarified this point by

stating that the Special Group did not express a desire to proceed with the

suggestion of a Castro assassination:

“Senator Schweiker:...was it understood in an
unwritten way that (assassination) was to pro-
ceed?"

"Mr. Harvey: -Not to my knowledge, no....

If there was any unwritten understanding on

the part of the members of the Special Group

concerning this, other than what was said at the

meeting, I do not know of it..."

(Harvey, pp. 30-31).

Harvey further testified that shortly after the August 10 meeting,

McCone told Harvey that he had called McNamara to state that assassiantion
should not be discussed and that he had told McNamara that if he was involved

in such matters, he might be excommunicated from his church. (Harvey, p- 25).

HW 50955 DocId:32423524 Page 215


-Ti-

(3) Yestimony of McNamara

McNamara testified that he did not recall any discussion of a Castro
assasgination at the August 10 meeting, but that he did express opposition
to any assasssination attempt when McCone telephone him after Lansdale's

August 13 memorandum was brought to McCone's attention. (McNamara, P. 7,8).

McNamara stated that

"I agreed with Mr. McCone that no such planning
should be undertaken." (McNamara, p. 8).

McNamara stated further that
"I have no knowledge. or information about any other

plans or preparations for a Castro assassination."
(McNamara, p. 7).

(4) Testimony of. Elder
Elder, a career CIA officer, served as McCone's Executive Assistant
from May 1962 until McCone's departure from the Agency in April 1965. Elder
\ testified that he was present when McCone telephone McNamara after the August
10 meeting. Elder stated that McCone told McNamara
“the subject you just brought up, I think it is highly
improper. I do not think it should be discussed. It
is not an action that should ever be condoned. It is
not. proper for us to discuss, and I intend to have it
expunged from the record."
(Elder, p. 23). 2
Elder testified that this was the essence of the conversation but that he

remembered "several exact phrases, like ‘would not be condoned'~ and ‘im-

- proper’. (Elder, pp. 23, 24).*/

%/ Elder, who stated he heard both McCone and McNamara's pact of the tele-
phone conversation via a speaker phone, said that McNamara "just more
or less accepted what Mr. McCone said without comment or rejoinder."
(Elder, p. 24).

HW 50955

a ae

When Harvey later received Lansdale's August 13 memorandum, McCone
spoke to Harvey in Elder's presence, and "McCone made his views quite clear
in the same language and tone...that he used with Mr. McNamara." (Elder,
p. 25). Elder testified that Harvey did not tell McCone that Harvey was
engage in the Castro assassination effort at that time. (Elder, p. 25).

Elder also described a meeting he had with Helms in Elder's office
shortly after the August 10 meeting to convey to Helms McCone's views re-
garding the subject of assassinations. Elder stated:

"T told Mr. Helms that Mr. McCone had expressed

his feeling. to Mr. McNamara and Mr. Harvey ‘that
assassination could not be condoned and would not be
approved. Furthermore, I conveyed Mr. McCone's
statement that it would be unthinkable to record

in writing any consideration of assassination
because it left the impression that the subject

had received serious consideration by governmen~
tal policymakers, which it, had not. Mr. Helms
responded, ‘I understand." The point is that

I made Mr. Helms aware of the strength of Mr.
McCone's opposition to assasination. I know that Mr.
Helms could not have been under any misapprehension

about Mr. McCone's feelings after this conversation."
(Elder Affidavit, 8/__/75, p. d+

(5) Testimony of Lansdale

Lansdale testified that he recalled that the subject of Castro's
assassination surfaced at the August 10 meeting, but that the "consensus was
...hell no on this and there was a very violent reaction." anedaie! p. 20).
With respect to why he asked Harvey on August 13 for a Castro assasination
plan, Lansdale testified:

"Senator Baker: Why did you, three days later
if they all said, hell no, /go/ ahead with it?"

a

"General Larisdale:...the meeting at which they
said that was still on a development of my original
task, which was a revolt and an overthrow of a
regime. At the same time, we were getting intelligence
= accumulating very quickly of something very different
taking place in Cuba than we had expected, which was
the Soviet technicians starting to come in and the
possibilities of Soviet missiles being placed there.
At that time, I thought it would be a possibility
someplace down the road in which there_would be some_
possible need to take action such as /assassination/."*/
(Lansdale, p. 21). a

Lansdale stated that he had only one brief conversation with Harvey
after the August 13 memorandum in which Harvey stated “he would look into it...
see about developing some. plans" but. that was the last Lansdale ever heard
of the matter. (Lansdale, p. 124). Lansdale stated that with the develop-
ment of the Missile Crisis, Mongoose "was being rapidly shifted out of con-
sideration" and thus "I wasn't pressing for answers... dt was
very obvious that’ another situation was developing that would be handled
quite differently in Cuba." (Lansdale, P. 124).

Lansdale testified that he was "very certain" that a discussion of a
Castro assassination plan or proposal never came up in his discussions with

Robert Kennedy or with President Kennedy, and that he had originated the

request to Harvey for plan without discussing the matter with anyone:

x]

"Q:...Why, if it is true that assassination idea
was turned down on August 10, you sent out your
memo of August 132"

“General Lansdale:...I don't recall that thoroughly,
I don't remember the reasons why I would."

"Q: Is it your testimony that the August 10 meeting
turned down assassinations as a subject to look into,
and that you nevertheless asked Mr. Harvey to look
into it?"

"General Lansdale: I guess it is, yes. The way you

put it to me now has me baffled about why I did it.
I don't know." (Lansdale, pp. 123-124.

DoclId:32423524 Page 218

c. Testimony of News Reporters as to Lansdale's Comments on

the August 10 Meeting

During the Committee's investigation, news reports concerning the
Fes 10 meeting and Lansdale's request for a Castro assassination plan
appeared in the press. Two of these reports were based on statements made
by Lansdale to David Martin of the Associated Press and Jeremiah O'Leary
of the Washington Star-News. In view of the apparent conflict between
Lansdale's testimony to the Committee and what Lansdale was reported to have
said to Martin and O'Leary, the Committee invited these reporters to testify
as to Lansdale's statements to them. Martin testified under a subpoena
issued by the Committee pursuant to Senate Resolution 21. O'Leary appeared
voluntarily but stated the policy of his newspaper with regard to eras
news sources precluded him from any comment going beyond that contained in
a prepared statement he read under oath. O'Leary's statement declared that

; his news report "represents accurately my understanding of the relevant in-
formation I obtained from news sources." (O'Leary, page 5).
We discuss below Martin's testimony and the news reports as they compare

to Lansdale's testimony.

(1) The Martin News Report.

Martin's news report stated, in its lead paragraph:
"Retired Maj. Gen. Edward G. Lansdale
said Friday that acting on orders from
President John F. Kennedy delivered
through an intermediary, he developed
plans for removing Cuban Premier Fidel

Castro by any means including assassination."
(Ex. 2 to Martin Affidavit)

Martin testified that this lead paragraph was accurate and that it was
a conclusion which he drew based upon the totality of his interview on

May 30, 1975 with Lansdale. (Martin, pp. 19-20) In contrast, Lansdale

HW 50955 DocId:32423524 Page 220


-T6-

testified that, after reading Martin's report in the press, he told Martin
"your first sentence is not only completely untrue, but there is not a
single thing in your story that says it is true." (Lansdale, p. 65)

As discussed above (see p. __), Lansdale testified that on his own initiative
he had originated. the request to Harvey without discussing the matter with
anyone and that a Castro assassination plan never came up in his discussions

with Robert Kennedy (or with President. Kennedy).

In view of Martin's testimony that the lead paragraph of his report
was a conclusion based on the totality of his interview with Lansdale, it
should be noted that the remainder of Martin's story does not state that
Lansdale was ordered by President Kennedy ‘Or Robert Kennedy to develop :
plans for a Castro assassination. The report quotes Lansdale as stating
"I was working for the highest authority in the land...the President"
and goes on to state that Lansdale said he did not deal directly with
the President but ‘worked through" an intermediary more intimate to the
President than Bundy.*/ It can be'noted that the phrases “working for"
and “working through" are not the same as the lead paragraph's conclusion
that Lansdale was "acting on orders" to develop a Castro assassination plan.

In addition, subsequent paragraphs in the Martin report indicate that Lansdale
said the decision to include assassination in his planning was Lansdale's
own, as he testified it was to the Committee. Thus, the Partin report states
Lansdale said that assassination was “one of the means he /Lansdale/
considered," that it was Lansdale's belief that assassination would not have

been "incompatible" with his assignment, and that Lansdale said "I just wanted

to see if the U.S. had any such capabilities.”

*/ The Martin. report states that Lansdale refused to provide this
intermediary's name for the record. In respecting the confidentiality
of news sources, the Committee didnot seek to ask Martin what was said
off the record to him in the course of his newsgathering efforts. (Martin,

pe ). : 2

HW 50955 Docld:32423524 Page 221


-1T-

Moreover, in his testimony as to the conversation with Lansdale on
May 30, 1975 that was the basis for his report, Martin said he did not
specifically ask Lansdale if he had-acted on orders with regard to an
assassination plan, nor did Lansdale say he acted on orders. Rather,
Martin asked Lansdale “who were you working for?"*/ When Martin did
specifically ask Lansdale in a subsequent conversation on June 4, 1975
if he had acted on orders, Martin testified that Lansdale stated that
he had not. In this subsequent conversation on June 4, 1975, Martin
said he asked Lansdale specifically, “were you ever ordered by President
Kennedy or any other Kennedy to draw up plans to assassinate Castro?"
(Martin, p. 21). Martin testified that Lansdale replied "no" and that
his orders were "very broad." (Martin, p. 21). Martin further testified
that in this June 4 conversation he asked Lansdale whether "any ai aneion

i

planning you did was done on your oun initiative," and that Lansdale replied
"yes." (Martin, p. 21). Martin stated that it was his belief that his
June 4 conversation was at. variance with Lansdale's statements to him

on May 30, 1975. (Martin, p. 21). It may also. be the case, based on
Martin's testimony as to the differences between the questions he posed to

Bansdale on May 30 and on June 4, 1975, that he and Lansdale may have

misunderstood each other.

*/ Martin testified that his conversation with Lansdale on May 30, 1975
involved two subjects: 1) “what were you (Lansdalé) doing in August 1962"
(Martin, p. 16), and 2) “who were you working for." (Martin, p. 17).
Martin stated that in the first portion of the conversation dealing with
Lansdale's activities in August 1962, Lansdale stated, according to
Martin, "I just wanted to see if the U.S. had any such capabilities" and
that ‘this included "assassination" as well as other means of disposing
of Castro. As to the second portion of the conversation, Martin stated
he asked Lansdale “who were you working for" and Lansdale replied “on that
project I was working for the highest authority in the land." (Martin, p. 18).

HW 50955 DocId:32423524 Page 222


(2) ‘The O'Leary Report

O'Leary's news report read as follows in its lead paragraphs:
_ "Retired Maj. Gen. Edward G. Lansdale has named
Robert F. Kennedy as the administration official
who ordered him in 1962 to launch a CIA project

to work out all feasible plans for "getting rid
of" Cuban Prime Minister Fidel Castro.

"Lansdale, in an interview with the Washington
Star, never used the word "assassination" and

said it was not used by Kennedy, then the attor-
ney general. iu

But he said there could be no doubt that, "the
project for disposing of Castro envisioned the
whole spectrum of plans from overthrowing the
Cuban leader to assassinating him."
O'Leary's report also stated that "Lansdale said he was contacted

" \In his appearance before the

by Robert Kennedy in mid-summer of 1962....
Committee, O'Leary pointed out ‘that this reference to the mid-summer of
1962 modified the reference in the lead paragraph of his report. (O'Leary,

p. 13).

In his testimony, Lansdale said he submitted a statement to the

Washington Star stating that this report was "a distortion of my
remarks." (Lansdale, p.61). Lansdale testified that he stated to
the Washington Star that "perhaps someplace in the planning there :

is something about what to do with a leader who would threaten the

HW 50955 DocId:32423524 Page 223


-19-

lives of millions of Americans fvith Soviet Missiles7...but I can
say I never did receive any order from President Kennedy or from
Robert Kennedy about taking action against Castro personally."
(Lansdale, pp.61-62). Lansdale further testified that he told
O'Leary that he did take orders from Robert Kennedy, but made clear
that "it was on a very wide-ranging type of thing." (Lansdale, p.62).
Lansdale testified as follows concerning his statement to the Star

following the O'Leary report:

“After the story appeared, the... Washington Star
asked me what wide-ranging things were you talking

about? .

"J said there were economic matters and military

matters and military things and they were very

wide-ranging things. I said perhaps all O'Leary

was thinking of was assassination. I was

thinking of far wider than that." (Lansdale, pp.62-63)

O'Leary's report makes clear that Lansdale did not state that

Robert Kennedy instructed Lansdale to develop an assassination
plan. The O'Leary report states:

"Lansdale said he is certain Robert Kennedy's

instructions to him did not include the word

"assassination." He said the attorney general,

as best he could recall, spoke in more general

terms of exploring all feasible means and

practicalities of doing something "to get rid
of" Castro.

In view of the above, it appears that although he may have been
imprecise in his conversations with O'Leary and Martin, Lansdale never-
theless did not tell them that he was ordered to develop an assassination
plan by Robert Kennedy or the President. As discussed above (see p.”__),
Lansdale testified that he never discussed a Castro assassination with
President Kennedy or with Robert Kennedy. Lansdale's reported statements
that he was ordered to plan to "get rid of Castro by all feasible means”
is also consistent with Lansdale's testimony, as well as that of the other

witnesses, with respect to the objective of the Mongoose operation. As

HW 50955 DocId:32423524 Page 224


-80-
discussed above in section » however, it was the testimony of all
witnesses except Helms that such statements did not include assassination.
Lansdale's statements to O'Leary and Martin appear consistent with his
sworn testimony that it was his own idea to request an assassination plan
from Harvey and that he did not discuss this idea with anyone except Harvey.
(see p. ___above). With respect to this latter point, however, it is
a fact that Lansdale's request for an assassination plan followed almost
immediately after the August 10 meeting, where the question of a Castro
assassination was raised. Hence, it is not unreasonable to conclude that
the raising of the question of a Castro assassination at the August 10
meeting prompted Lansdale to request an asgassination plan (although it
was the finding of the IG Report as well ‘as the testimony of Harvey that
the August 10 meeting had no relation to the question of authorization for

: the 1962 assassination plot).

certain policies of the ey Administration during 1963 which are relevant to
that question.*/ (The facts relating to the poison pen plot are set out at pp. Hee
above).

2. The Issue of Authority

Much of the testimony of Helms and the Kennedy Administration members dis-
cussed in the preceding section (see pp. sito __) is relevant to the question
of authorization for the 1963 assassination activity. Once again there was no
evidence that anyone above the Agency was informed about or specifically authorized
the plot.

As in the case of the 1962 assassination plot, however, Helms testified that
he believed the 1963 assassination activity was permissible in view of his
perception of continuing pressure exerted by the Administration to overthrow Castro
/and his perception that there were no limits placed on the means that could be
used to achieve Castro's downfall. (elms, 9/11/75, pp. 11-13) .7

The testimony of Helms and the Kennedy Administration members on the issue
of whether the pressure to overthrow Castro made assassination permissible with-
out a direct order is discussed in detail in the preceding section and is not re-
peated here. Before turning to Helms' specific testimony relating to AM/LASH
(including his view that AM/LAsh was not seen as a potential assassin) we
discuss below the Kennedy Administration Cuba policy in 1963. In

*/The evidence showed that the "science-fiction" devices of an exploding sea
shell and a poison diving suit were abandoned at the laboratory stage within the
“IA and that no authorization was sought for their development or eventual use.
dence, the focus in this section is on the activity involving the delivery of the
poison pen to AM/LASH.

general, the 1963 covert action program and pressure was less
intense. than it had been in 1962.

3. The Kennedy Administration's Policy Towards Cuba in 1963

(a) Organization

The Mongoose Operation was disbanded following the Cuban
Missile Crisis. An interagency "Cuban Coordinating Committee”
was established within the State Department with responsibility
for developing covert action proposals. (Bundy, 7/11/75, p. 148.)
The review and approval function was taken from the Special. Group
Augmented (which passed out of existence) and.was placed under
the Special Group, chaired by Bundy. - (Bundy, 7/11/75, p. 148.)

U.S. policy towards Cuba in 1963-was also treated in the
National Security Council's Standing Group, the successor to
the Executive Committee which had dealt with the Missile Crisis.
Members of the Standing Group included Robert Kennedy, McNamara,
McCone, Bundy and Sorensen.

We discuss below four aspects of the Kennedy Administration's
1963 Cuba policy. These are: (1) the Standing Group's discus-
sion of possible developments in the event of Castro's death;

(2) the Standing Group's discussion of policy options; (3) the
covert action program approved by the Special Group; and (4) the
diplomatic effort to explore the possibility of reestablishing re-
lations with Castro. The first three of these took place in the
Spring or early Summer of 1963; the fourth aspect -- the effort

to communicate with Castro -- took place at the same time as the

1963 assassination activity.

(b) The Discussion of the Contingency of Castro's Death

~ In the Spring of 1963, the Standing Group discussed con-
tingency planning in the event of Castro's death. The documen-
tary evidence and testimony indicated that Castro's death was
discussed as a contingency which might occur independent of

U.S. action. The Group found that the possibilities for
favorable developments to the United States should Castro die
were "singularly unpromising". (Summary Record of Standing Group
Meeting, May 28, 1963, p. 1). a

The discussion stemmed from a memorandum by Bundy which
discussed "possible new directions" for U.S. Cuban policy. (Bundy
Memorandum to the Standing Group, April 21, 1963). The memoran-
dum distinguished between (i) events which might occur indenen-
dently of U.S. action and (ii) steps the U.S. might “initiate”.
(Bundy memorandum, p. 2.)

When. the Standing Group discussed the. Bundy memorandum,
Robert Kennedy proposed a study of the "measures we would take
following contingencies such as the death of Castro or the shoot-
ing down of a U-2."" (Bundy Ex. 6E, Summary Record.of NSC Stand-
ing Group Meeting, April 23, 1963, p. 2). The downing of a U-2
had been listed in the Bundy memorandum as a subject for contin-
gency planning under the category of steps for which the U.S.
must "await events" as distinpuished from "initiate actions".

Bundy 's follow-up memorandum, an agenda for a further Stand-

ing Group discussion of Cuban policy, listed the subject of a

HW 50955 Docld:32423524 Page 228


Ae

Castro death contingency under a category comprising subjects
not involving US. initiatives, e.g., “occurrence of revolt
ie repression in the manner of Hungary", attributable inter-

ference by Castro in other countries", and "the reintroduction
of offensive weapons". (Bundy Ex. 6-G, 4/29/63). =

After the meeting of April 23, 1963, the Standing Group
assigned to CIA's Office of National Estimates*/ the task of
estimating possible developments if Castro should die. (Bundy
Ex. 6-H, Memorandum for Mémbers of the Standing Group, May 2,
1963).

The resulting paper analyzed the various forces which would
come into play in Cuba after Castro's death, including the
likely penay eon of Castro's top aides, Raul Castro and Che
Guevara, as welll as possible Soviet reaction. (Bundy Ex. 6-1,
Draft tenorandy by Office of National Estimates titled "Develop-
ments in Cuba and Possible U.S. Actions in the Fvent of Castro's
Death", pp. 2-5, hereafter called the "ONE paper"). The OWE
Paper concluded that "the odds are that upon Castro's death, his
brother Raul ot some other figure in the regime would, with Soviet

/

|
backing and help, take over control

*“/The Office of National Estimates is the research division of the
CIA responsible for analyzing foreign intelligence. The Office is
not part of the CIA's covert operations organization. c

/The ONE Paper also saw little chance that a government disposed
towards the United States would be able to come to power without ex-

tensive U.S. military support: "“Anti-Moscow Cuban nationalists would
require extensive U.S. help in order to win, and probably U.S. military
intervention." (Bundy Ex. 6-1, p. ii).

HW 50955 DocId:32423524 Page 229


In addition,. the ONE Paper warned that the United States
would most Likely be blamed if Castro should die by another's
hand. “If Castro were to die by other than natural causes the
U.S. would be widely charged with complicity, even though it
is widely known that Castro has many enemies". (Bundy Ex. 6-I
p. 4.)

The ONE Paper also identified a:number of possible -U.S.
actions in the event of Castro's death, ranging along a spec-
trum that included no U.S. initiatives, action to support a
government in exile,- quarantine and blockade, and outright
invasion. (Bundy Ex. 6-I, pp. 7-12.)

On May 28, 1963, the Standing Group discussed the ONE Paper.
The Standing Group found that "all of the courses of action
{open to the U.S. should Castro die} were singularly unpromising".
(Summary Record of NSC Standing Group Meeting No. 7/63, May 28,
1963, p. 1).

Bundy agreed that the Standing Group "certainly posed the
question" in the Spring of 1963 as to what would happen if Castro
died or were killed. (Bundy, 7/11/75, p. 130.) But he testified
that he had no recollection of a Castro assassination being on
the minds of Standing Group members when they discussed this

contingency. (Bundy, 7/11/75, p. 14.)*/

*/As indicated above p. ); Bundy did recall that over the
period 1961 and 1963 "the subject of a Castro assassination was
mentioned from time to time by different individuals", but said that
he was not aware of "much discussion in the Spring, of 1963 on, that
subject". (Bundy, 7/11/75, p. ale

HW 50955 Docld:32423524 Page 230


Bundy testified, however, that one reason for getting an
eStimate of this kind was to get it on record that we should
not be "fussing" with questions of assassination and that it
was not a sound policy. (Bundy, 7/11/75, p. 142.)

Bundy further testified that it was not unusual to assess
the implications of a foreign leader's possible death, giving
the cases of Stalin and DeGaulle as examples.. In the case of
Castro, Bundy said he felt it was only prudent to attempt to
assess the question of a post-Castro Cuba since Castro was

such a "dominant figure’. (Bundy, 7/11/75, p. 145.)

(c) The Standing Group's Discussion of U.S. Policy

Towards Cuba

The Standing Group's documents indicate it continued to
assume the desirability of harassment, but recognized there
were few practical measures the U.S. could take that were
likely to achieve Castro's overthrow.

In his April 21, 1963 memorandum on-"Cuban Alternatives"
Bundy identified three possible new alternatives: (1) forcing
“a non-Communist solution in Cuba by all necessary means",

(2) insisting on "major but limited ends", or (3) moving “in
the direction of a gradual development of some form of accommo-
dation with Castro". (Bundy Memorandum to the Standing Group,

April 21, 1963, p. 3.) .These alternatives were discussed at

Standing Group.meetings on April 23 and May 25, 1963.

HW 50955 Docld:32423524 Page 231


Sorensen, who participated in these meetings, testified
that the "widest possible range of alternatives" were dis-
cussed, but that "assassination was not éven on the list".
(Sorensen, 7/21/75, p. 4.) We said that consideration of
possible options such as forcing "a non-Communist solution
in Cuba by all necessary means" did not encompass assassina-
tion:

"(this].could not have included or implied assassina-

tion. Instead, it expressly referred to_'the develop- e

ment of pressures! and 'gradual escalation of the con-

frontation in Cuba' to produce’an overthrow of the
regime, including | a willingness to use military force

to invade Cuba' Such a course was obviously not
adopted by the Président, and in any event expressed
an approach far different from assassination". (Soren-

sen affidavit, 7/25/75, p. 4).

The record of the first Standing Group discussion of Bundy's
memorandum shows that a number of alternatives were discussed (none
of wnich involved assassination) but no conclusions were reached.

On May 28, 1963, the Standing Group met again. McCone argued
for steps to "increase economic hardship" in Cuba, supplemented
by sabotage to "create a situation in Cuba in which it would be

possible to subvert military leaders to the point of their acting

The Bundy memorandum also used the phrase “all necessary measures"
to describe the steps the U.S. was willing to take to 'prevent"' a di-
xect military threat to the U.S. or to the Western Hemisphere from Cuba.
Sorensen explained the meaning of this phrase in the context of the
April 23 discussion of Kennedy Administration policy.

"Ethis phrase] could not by any stretch of semantics

or logic have included assassination or any other
initiative. It reflected the purely defensive posture
implemented six months earlier when long-range missiles |
.and other offensive weapons were placed in Cuba.
(Sorensen affidavit, 7125175, 5p fe ae : tase

HW 50955 DocId:32423524 Page 232


HW 50955

to overthrow Castro". (Summary Record of NSC Standing Group
Méeting No. 7/63, May 28, 1963, p. 1.) McNamara said that
sabotage would not be "conclusive" and suggested, study of
"economic pressures which could upset Castro." Robert Kennedy
said "the U.S. must do something against castro, even though

we do not believe our actions would bring him down". (Id.,

p. 2) In conclusion, Bundy summarized by stating that the task
was "to decide now what actions we would take against Castro,
acknowledging that the measures practical for us to take will
not result in his overthrow’. (Id., p. 2.)

(d) The Special Group's Authorization of a Sabotage Pro-

gram Against Cuba

During the first six months of 1963, little, if any,
sabotage activity against Cuba was undertaken.*/ However, on
June 19, 1963, following the Standing Group's discussion of Cuba

policy in the Spring, President Kennedy approved a Cuba sabotage

program / (Memorandum for the Special Group, 6/19/63, p. 1.)

*/ At an April 3, 1963 meeting on Cuba, Bundy stated that no
sabotage operations were then underway because the Special Group “had
decided . . . that such activity is not worth the effort expended on
it." (Memorandum of Meeting on Cuba, 4/3/63, p. 1).

/ The sabotage program approved on June 19, 1963 was directed at
"four major segments of the Cuban economy" ay electric power; (2)
petroleum refineries and storare facilities; (3) railroad and high-
way transportation and (4) production and manufacturing. (Memoran-
dum for the Special Group, June 19, 1963, p. 1) Operations under this
program were to be conducted by CIA-controlled Cuban agents from a
U.S. island off Florida and it was to complement a similar effort de-
signed to Beret internal resistance elements which could carry out
sabotage." (Id., p. 2.)

DocId:32423524 Page 233


In contrast to the Mongoose program, which sought to build
toward an eventual internal revolt, the 1963 covert action
program had a more limited objective, i.e., "to nourish a
spirit of resistance and disaffection which could lead to
significant defections and other byproducts of unrest". (Id.,
p..2.)

After the initial approval, particular intelligence and
sabotage operations were submitted to the Special Group for.
specific prior authorization. On October 3, 1963, the Special
Group approved nine operations in Cuba, including several
sabotage operations. And on October 24, 1963, thirteen major
sabotage operations were approved to.be undertaken: in the

} period November 1963 through January 1964, including the sabo-

tage of an electric power plant, an oil refinery, and a sugar
mill. (Memorandum, July 11, 1975,- CIA Review Staff to Select
Committee, on "Approved CIA Covert Operations into Cuba.").

(e) The Diplomatic Effort to Explore an Accommodation With

Castro

As early as January 4, 1963, Bundy proposed to. President
Kennedy that the possibility of communicating with Castro be
explored. (Bundy Ex: 6, Memorandum to the President, January 4,
1963, p. 3.) Bundy's memorandum on "Cuba Alternatives" to the
Standing “Group on April 23, 1963, also listed the “gradual de-
velopment of some form of accommodation with Castro" among

policy alternatives. (Bundy memorandum, p. 3). a

HW 50955 DocId:32423524 Page 234


- 10.-

And, at a meeting on June 3, 1963, the Special Group agreed
it would be a "useful endeavor" to explore "various possibili-
ties of establishing channels of communication to Castro”.
(Memorandum of Special Group meeting, June 6, 1963, p. 2).

ae the Fall of 1963, William Atwood was a Special Advisor
to the U.S. Delegation to the United Nations with the rank
of Ambassador. (Atwood, 7/10/75, p. 3.) Atwood testified : =
that during the period of September-November, 1963, he held a
series of talks with the Cuban Ambassador to the United Nations
to discuss opening negotiations on an accommodation between
Castro and the United States. (Atwood, pp. 5-9.)

Atwood testified that at the outset he informed Robert
Kennedy, who told him that the effort "was worth pursuing". (Atwood,p.6).
Atwood said he regularly reported on the talks to the White
House and to his. superior at the United Nations, Adlai Steven-
son. (Atwood pp. 6-7.) Atwood further stated that he was told
by Bundy that President Kennedy was in’ favor of "pushing towards
an opening toward Cuba" to take Castro "out of the Soviet
fold and perhaps wiping out the Bay ‘of Pigs and maybe getting
back into normal". (Atwood, p.7-8 .)

Atwood stated that he believed the only people.who knew of
his contacts with the Cubans were the President, Harriman, Steven-
son, Robert Kennedy, Bundy, Bundy's assistant, and journalist Lisa

; Howard. (Howard had initially placed Atwood in contact with. the
Cuban Ambassador after reporting to Atwood that. during a -

trip to Cuba she had learned Castro was anxious to establish

HW 50955 DocId:32423524 Page 235


‘ Ratiae oe Gzssae

communications with the United States. Thereafter Howard
served as an intermediary in arranging Atwood's meetings with
the Cubans. (Atwood, pp. 4, 18)).

Atwood also testified.that he arranged for a French
journalist, Jean Daniel, to visit the White House prior to
Daniel's scheduled trip to see Castro. (Atwood, p. 19.)
(According to an article by Daniel in December, 1963, Daniel
met with President Kennedy on.October 24, 1963. They discussed
the prospects for reestablishing U.S.-Cuba relations and
President Kennedy asked Daniel to report back to him after
seeing Castro.)*/

Atwood's efforts reached their high point on November 18,
1963, when Atwood spoke’ by telephone with a member of Castro's
staff in Cuba. (Atwood, p. 8). Pursuant to White House in-
structions, Atwood informed Castro's staff member that the
U.S. favored preliminary negotiations at the U.N. (rather than-
in Cuba as proposed by the Cubans), and that the U.S. desired
to work out an agenda for these talks... (Atwood, pp. 8-9).
After receiving Atwood's report on this conversation, Bundy told
Atwood that after the Cuban agenda was received, President
Kennedy wanted to see Atwood to "decide what to say and

whether to go or what we should do next".
days later, on November 22, 1963, (the same day AM/LASH was given
the poison. pen), Jean Daniel was meeting with Castro. On that
same day, President Kennedy was assassinated. With the change of
Administrations, Atwood's talks with the Cubans became less fre-
quént and eventually ended in early 1964. (Atwood, p. 10.)

4. Testimony on the Question of Authorization for the

AM/LASH Poison Pen Device
(a) Testimony of Helms

(i) The October 29 Meeting and the Use of Robert
Kennedy"s Name Without Obtaining Mis Approval

As discussed above in detail (see pp. ), Fitzgerald met
with AM/LASH on October 29, 1963, in a foreign capital. Fitz-
gerald represented to AM/LASH that he was the personal represen-
tative of Robert Kennedy, and gave AM/LASH assurances of full sup-
port should AM/LASH succeed in overthrowing Castro.

The IG Report states that, according to Fitzgerald, Helms and
Fitzgerald discussed the planned meeting with AM/LASH and Helms de-
cided "it was not necessary to seek approval from Robert Kennedy for
Fitzgerald to speak in his name". (IG, pp. 88-89). In his testimony,
Helms stated he did not recall such mn discussion with Fitzgerald, but
that he believed he had pre-existing authority to deal with AM/LASH
with respect to "a change in government''(as opposed to assassination)

and that this made it unnecessary to obtain Robert Kennedy's approval

"I felt so sure that if I went to see Mr. Kennedy that he would have

*/The following exchange occurred in Helms' testimony:

"Sen. Hart of Michigan: Dealing with respect to what?

A change in government, or assassination?"

Mr. Helms: A change in government, Senator Hart: This is
what we were trying to do. (Helms, 6/13/75, p. 132)

8

HW 50955 Docld:32423524 Page 237


said yes, that I didn't think there was any need to.’ (Helms,

6/13/75, p. 132.)

Helms said his view was that AM/LASH was a political
action agent, not a potential assassin, and that the meet-
ing with AM/LASH and his. decision not to contact Robert
Kennedy should be viewed in that light:

-given this Cuban of his standing and all

the history...of trying to find someone inside Cuba
who might head a government and have a group to re-
place Castro...this was so central to the whole theme
of everything we had been trying to do, that I find
it totally unnecessary to ask Robert Kennedy at that
point (whether) we should go ahead with this. This
is obviously what he had been pushing, what every-

body had been pushing for us to try to do...let's

get on with-doing it. * (Helms, 6/13/75, pp. 117-118),*,

(ii) The Delivery of the Poison Pen on November 22

While Helms stated that the delivery of a poison pen to

AM/LASH was not part of an assassination plot, Helms testified

_. */As discussed above (see pp. ), there was conflicting testi-
mony from CIA officers as to whether they viewed AM/LASH as an
assassin and as to the purpose of giving him the poison pen. The docu-
mentary evidence, however, indicates that AM/LASH in 1963 was intent
upon assassinating Castro, that the CIA officers knew of this, and,

in addition to offering a poison pen, told AM/LASH they would
supply him with high powered rifles with telescopic sights. (see
Pee, above) .

Helms testified that. because Amlash 'was the asset we were looking
for, (we didn't want him to blow himself or blow anything else ‘by
getting involved in something like this [assassination] and have it
fail. We wanted him to stay in place.’ (Helms, 6/13/75, p. 131).
Helms stated that "at no time was it the idea of [the AM/LASH- Ll] case
officers, or those people in the chain behind, to use [AM/LASH-1] to
assassinate Castro." (Helms, 6/13/75, p. 135).

Helms further stated  ° “...there was an enormous amount of
temporizing with this fellow to keep him on the team, -.to keep him
working away at this job, but to try and persuade him that this was not
the way to-go about it." (Helms, 6/13/75, p. 135). Helms testified
that AM/LASH- Ll was given the poison pen "because he was insisting on

i something and this was a baat esas gesture rather than giving him
some kind of a gun he had asked for. 4

HW 50955 DocId:32423524 Page 238


-14-

that he believed Castro's assassination was within the scope of the CIA's
authority. /(Helms, 9/12/75, pp. 11-12).7 As in the case of the 1962 plots,
Helms based this on the vigor of the Administration's policy towards Cuba
Jand his perception that there were no limits put on the means that could

be used in the effort against Castro. (Helms, 9/12/75, pp. 11-12). Thus,/
Helms testified that after the missile crisis the U.S. continued to conduct

covert actions whose purpose was "to. overthrow Castro." (Helms, 6/13/75,

p. 24.) /Helms was asked whether it was his opinion that the offer of the poison
pen to AM/LASH was authorized because it came within the scope of the 1963 pro-
gram against Castro. Helms. responded:

/*U think the only way I know how to answer that is that I

do not recall when things got cranked up in 1963 any dramatic
changes or limitations being put on this operation. There

was still an effort by whatever device, and perhaps only
slightly differently oriented at this time, to try to get rid
of Castro...But I do not recall specific things being said,
now, (we are not) going to'do this, we're not going to do that,
and we're not going to do the other thing, and we will do just
these things."'/

(b) Testimony of Administration Officials

As with the Mongoose period, the Administration officials agreed that
they were not informed about any assassination plot and that there was no order that
Castro be assassinated. Again, they disagreed with Helms position that an assassi-
nation plot could be undertaken without express authority. The only added part
relating to the AM/LASH plot was certain testimony which asserted that it was in-
conceivable that the President would have approved.an assassination plot at the very

same time he had authorized talks to explore the possibility of improved relations

with Castro.*/

*/Rusk testified that "I find it extraordinarily difficult ‘to believe" and that "I
{ just can't conceive" President Kennedy would have authorized the passage of an assas~
sination device for use against Castro while Atwood was exploring the possibility

HW 50955

Sage

Since Helms did not claim any higher specific

knowkedge of the AM/LASI assassination plot, however, the additional issue

posed by that testimony does not really arise.

(continued)

of normalizing relations with Castro. (Rusk, 7/10/75, p. 85). Similarly, Bundy
testified he "absolutely" did not believe President Kennedy would have authorized
or permitted an assassination device to have been passed at the same time a
possible rapprochment with Castro was being pursued. (Bundy, 7/11/75, p. 151).

On the other hand, when the possibility of exploring better relations with
Castro was initially raised (but before any talks were begun) Bundy indicated
that it could be explored on a "separate track" while other proposed actions,
such as sabotage, were going on. (Agenda for Special Group meeting of 4/29/63,
p. 2.)

DocId:32423524 Page 240


Subcommittee Meeting
9/9/75. Approved Draft. -

d.° The Question of Authorization in the Johnson Administration

1. Summary

of the Assassination Activity. As discussed above (see pp. )»

the Agency delivered: arms to AM/LASH in Cuba in March and-June 1964. In early

1965 after AM/LASH became more insistent that.a Castro assassination was neces-

sary and had asked for a silenced weapon, the Agency put AM/LASH in contact with

the leader of an anti-Castro group, B-1, with the intention that AM/LASH obtain

such a weapon.

Thereafter, the Agency learned that AM/LASH had received a

silencer and other special equipment from B-1 and was preparing to assassinate

Castro.

2, The Issue of Authorization. The issue of authority in the Johnson Admini-

stration is similar to that in the Kennedy Administration. During this phase of

the AM/LASH plot, Helms continued as Deputy Director for covert operations, and

the principal members of the Kennedy Administration continued in their positions

in the relevant

period of the Johnson Administration (Robert Kennedy left the

Administration in the midst of this period, on ).* Helms' testimony

‘that he believed a Castro assassination was within the scope of the CIA's authority

in view of Administration policy towards Cuba applied to the AM/LASH operation in

both 1963 and 1964-65. (Helms, 6/13/75, p. 137-138.) Again, there was no evidence

that McCone or anyone above the Agency specifically authorized or knew about the

Administration: ,

1964-65 plot. We discuss below four other matters occurring during the Johnson

(1) the covert. action program against Cuba in 1964-1965; (2)

the Special Groups' action in investigating reports of Cuban exile underworld

*Rusk (Secretary of State), McNamara (Secretary of Defense), McCone (Director
of Central Intelligence); and Bundy (Special Assistant for National Security

and Chairman of

plots to assassinate Castro; (3) Helms' report to Rusk that CIA was not in-
volved with AM/LASH in a Castro assassination plot; and (4) Helms' briefing

of President Johnson on the 1967 IG Report on alleged CIA assassination plots.

3. The Covert Action Program Against Cuba in 1964-1965. According to the

minutes of a Special Group meeting on April 7, 1964, which he chaired, President
Johnson decided to discontinue the use of CIA-controlled sabotage raids against
Cuba.* (Memorandum of Special Group Meeting, April 7, 1964, p. ___.) A memoran-
dum by McCone indicated that in deciding this question, President Johnson abandoned
the objective of Castro's overthrow.**

At the April 7, Special Group meeting, Rusk had emphasized his opposition to
the use of sabotage raids, stating his belief that they were unproductive,. and
had a “high noise level" that called attention to them. In addition, Rusk stated
that "he suspects the Cuban exiles who actually conduct the raids of possible
wishing to leave fingerprints pointing to U. S. involvement in order to increase

_ that involvement." (Memorandum of Special Group Meeting, April 7, 1964, page.2.)

*A memorandum by Bundy on April 7, 1964, listed seven aspects. of the covert action
“program which had been in effect. These were: (1) collection of intelligence;

(2) covert propaganda to encourage low risk forms of active and passive resistance;
(3) cooperation with other agencies in economic denial; (4) attempts to identify
.and establish contact with potential dissident-elements inside Cuba; (5) indirect
economic sabotage; (6) ClA-controlled sabotage raiding; and (7) autonomous opera-
tions. (Memorandum for the Record of the Special Group, April 7, 1964, p. 1-2.)

**at the April 7, 1964, meeting Rusk and Bundy opposed continuation of sabotage

if actions by CIA-controlled assets as "unproductive" and impractical. McCone dis-
agreed, noting that the covert action program relied on a "well-planned series
of sabotage efforts". (Memorandum of Special Group Meeting, April 7, 1964, p. 3.)
In this connection, Bundy noted that since. the approval of the current sabotage
in June 1963 "policymakers...had turned sabotage operations on and off to such
an extent that (the sabotage program) simply does not, in the nature of things,
appear feasible’. (Id., p. 2.) :

HW 50955 Docld:32423524 Page 242

4. The Special Group Investigation of Reported Castro Assassination Plots

by Cuban Exiles. On June 10, 1964, Helms informed McCone by memorandum that
Agency officials had learned of several plots of Cuban exiles to assassinate
Castro and other Cuban leaders. (Memorandum, Helms to McCone, June 10, 1964.)
Several of the plots, according to the memorandum, involved "people apparently
associated with the Mafia". Reportedly the exiles had offered people associated
with the Mafia $150,000 to perform the deed. In his memorandum, Helms statéd that
the sources of the reports were parties to the plots and in submitting the in-
formation to Agency officers were presumably seeking legal immmity should the
plots succeed. (Id., p. 1.)

Helms' memorandum, however, made no mention of any of the CIA assassination

plots against Castro.*

(Footnote continued. from previous page.)

In a memorandum the day after President Johnson's decision to stop CIA-controlled
sabotage operations, McCone stated: "the real issue to be considered at. the
-meeting and by the President was a question of whether we wished to implement

the policy (outlined in certain memoranda) or abandon the basic objective of bring-
ing about the liquidation of the Castro Communist ‘entourage and the elimination

of Communist presence in Cuba and thus rely on future events of an undisclosed
nature which might accomplish this objective. (Memorandum by McCone, April 8,
1964, p. __.)

In the context of the Special Group's discussion, McCone's use of the words "liqui-
dation" and elimination’! appears to be anothér example of inartful language. A
literal interpretation of these words leaves one with the impression that assassina-
tion was contemplated. But the context of. the discussion does not bear out such an
interpretation. Thus in specifying what he meant by "future events of an undisclosed
nature'' McCone pointed to "extreme economic distress caused by a sharp drop in

sugar prices", and "other external factors". (Id, p. 8.) McCone testified that
such references as the "elimination't or "liquidation" of the Castro regime did not
refer to assassination. (McCone, p.-_.)

**Moreover, according to Bundy, no one from the CIA or anyone else informed him at
the meetings that "in earlier years there had been a relationship with...persons

allegedly involved with the criminal syndicate--in order to accomplish the assassi-
nation of Fidel Castro". (Bundy, p. 71.)

HW 50955 Doold:32423524 Page 243


Indeed, it stated that "Agency officers made clear to each of the sources that
the United States Government would not under any circumstances, condone the
planned actions". (Id., p. 1.)

When the Special Group considered the information in Helms memorandum on
June 18, 1964, McCone stated he was "somewhat skeptical" and proposed additional
investigation, but "others, including Mr. Bundy, felt that the U. S. was being
put on notice and should do everything in its power to ascertain promptly the
veracity of the reports and then undertake prevention". (Memorandum of Special
Group Meeting, June 18, 1964.) In a memorandum on the June 18 meeting, McCone
indicated he had dissented from the Special Group's decision, stating his be-
lief that the Special Group was "overly exercised" and that he was inclined to
dismiss the matter as "Miami cocktail party talk". McCone noted, however, that
the Special Group "was more concerned than I and therefore.planning to discuss
the subject with the Attorney General and-possibly Mr. Hoover", (Memorandum

.- June 18, 1964, p. 1.)

The Special Group decided that the reports be transmitted to the Attorney
_General "as.a matter of law enforcement". (Id.) Robert Kennedy was informed of
this matter a few days later and stated that the Justice Department would investi-
-gate. (Memorandum of Meeting, 22 June 1964.) Thereaftér the FBI conducted an
investigation, the results of which were submitted to the Special Group on
August .19, 1964, by McCone.* (Memorandum, ‘August 19, 1964, McCone to Bundy.)
*McCone’s memorandum summarized seven FBI reports on its investigation. The FBI
found that several of the persons it interviewed stated they had knowledge of

the exile's plots and had reported the information to the CIA. Others inter-
viewed denied knowledge of the plans.

5, Nelms' Report to Rusk that CIA was not Involved with Amlash in a

Castro Assassination Plot
In March 1966, Helms, reported to Rusk by memorandum on the CIA's re-
lations with Amlash. (Rusk Ex. 7, Memorandum, March 7, 1966, Helms to Rusk). on
In this report, Helms stated that the CIA's contact with Amlash was for “the
express purpose” of intelligence collection. (Id.). Noting Cuban press
claims that Amlash and a second Cuban had been involved with the CIA ina ~ *_
Castro assassination plot, Helms stated:
The Agency was not involved with either. of
‘these two men in a plot to assassinate
Fidel Castro, as claimed in /a Cuban news
release/ nor did it ever encourage either
of these two persons to attempt such an act.
(Rusk Ex. 7, p..1).
The Helms memorandum to Rusk made no mention of the fact that CIA officers,
} with Helms' knowledge, had offered a poison pen to Amlash on November 22, 1963,
that CIA had supplied arms to Amlash in 1964, or that CIA had put, Amlash in touch
with B-1 to enable him to obtain a silenced weapon to assassinate Castro.
In his testimony, Helms stated that this memorandum to Rusk was "inaccurate"
~ and "not truthful". (Helms, 6/13/75, p. 115.)
The CIA's ‘copy. of the Hélms' memorandum to Rusk contains a typed notation
“in which Heims' signature was recommended by the CIA's then Deputy Director for
Plans, Thomas Karamessines. (Rusk Ex, 7, p. 2.) Helms testified that the day
‘ before his June 13, 1975, testimony to the Committee he had asked Karamessines
why the memorandum to Rusk had been written as it was. Helms stated he and Kara-
messines concluded they: did not know the reason but Helms speculated that "it
may be until we conducted (the 1967 IG investigation) somewhat later we didn't
have the facts straight, or maybe we had the facts straight then but we did not

aU “have them straight later". “(Helms, 6/13/75, p. 115.)

6. Helms’ Briefing of President Johnson on the 1967 Inspector General's

Report. Drew Pearson's article in the spring of 1967 alleging U. S. involve-

ment in plots to assassinate Fidel Castro prompted President Johnson to re-

quest Helms , who by then had become the DCI, to conduct an investigation. The
result was the Inspector General's Report of May 23, 1967. (Helms, 6/13/75, p. 35.)
After receiving the report, Helms briefed the President "orally about the contents".
(id. at 36.) During his testimony, Helms was shown his handwritten notes apparently
prepared for his briefing of the President. Those notes carried the story through
mid-1963. When asked if he told President Johnson that, according to the 1967
study, the efforts to assassinate Fidel Castro had continued into Johnson's
presidency, Helms replied, "I just can't answer that, I just don't know. I can't
recall having done so". (Id. at 38.) He did note that it would not have

occurred to him to brief President Johnson on the 1964 AM/LASH gun deliveries
because "I don't think one would have approached the AM/LASH thing as an assassina-
tion plot against Castro". (Id. at 39.) Helms had testified that AM/LASH was an
intelligence and political action agent. (Helms, _, p. ___-) The IG Report

- however, treated the AM/LASH operation as an assassination plot. (IG, p. -__.)

7. Helms -Testimony-on Authorization inthe Johnson Administration. In his

testimony, Helms was asked if the Agnecy regarded "whatever marching orders
they had obtained prior to the dealth of ‘President Kennedy as still being valid

and operative" when President Johnson succeeded to the office. Helms replied:

HW 50955 Docld:32423524 Page 246


vi UWI

Wlbu URS

This is not very clear to me at this stage. A lot
of the same officers were serving President Johnson
as they served President Kennedy, and...I can't re-
call anymore whether there was any specific issue
about whether this was taken up with President
Johnson at any meeting or any session. If it had
been, I would have thought there would have been
records someplace." (Helms, 6/13, p. 139.)

When asked whether President Johnson had been informed of or had authorized
continuing efforts to assassinate Castro, Helms replied indirectly that "the
Special Group would have continued to consider these.matters, and I would have
assumed that whoever was chairing the Special Group would have in turn reported
to the President, which was the usual practice’. (Id.)

But the records of the Special Group do not show any consideration of a
Castro assassination or of the AM/LASH plot. during the Johnson Administration
(or earlier). And, as discussed above, there was no evidence that McCone or
anyone above the Agency was informed of or specifically authorized the AM/LASH ,

plots.

DRAFT: OCTOBER 6, 1975 ‘FOP SECRET

Frederick D. Baron For Internal Committee

Use Only

D. CONGO

1. Introduction

‘The Committee has received solid evidence of a CIA
plot to assassinate Patrice Lumumba. The plot procéeded to
the point where lethal ‘substances and instruments specifically
intended for use in an assassination were placed in the hands
of the CIA Chief of Station in Leopoldville by an Agency
scientist. ane |

Although these instruments of assassination were never

used, a number of questions are presented by the Lumumba case
which reflect general issues that run throughout the Committee's
assassination inquiry. First, did CIA officers and operatives

in the Congo take steps to attempt the assassination of Lumumba?

Second, how high in the United States. government -was the
source of authorization for the CIA assassination plot? Finally,
was the CIA connected in any way’ to the events that actually led
to the death of Lumumba while in Congolese custody?

A thread of historical background is necessary to weave these
broad questions together with the documents and testimony re-

ceived by the Committee.

a

In the summer of 1960, there was a great deal of -concern.
at the highest levels in the United States. government about the
rolé of Patrice Lumumba in the Congo.* Lumumba, who served briefly
as Premier of the newly independent nation, was viewed with alarm
by United States foreign policymakers because of what they perceived
as his magnetic public appeal and his leanings toward the Soviet
Union.

Under the leadership of Lumumba and the new President,
Joseph Kasavubu, the Congo declared its independence. from Belgium
on June 30, 1960. In the turbulent month that followed, Lumumba
threatened to invite Soviet troops to hasten the withdrawal of
Belgian armed forces. The United Nations Security Council re-
quested a Belgian withdrawal and dispatched a neutral force
to the Congo to preserve order. In late July, Lumumba visited
Washington and received pledges of economic aid from, Secretary
of State Christian Herter. At.the beginning of September,

Soviet airplanes, trucks, and technicians were arriving in the
province where Lumumba's: support was strongest.

By mid-September, Lumumba sought protection from the UN
guard in Leopoldville after losing a struggle over the leadership
of the government with Kasavubu and Joseph Mobutu, Chief of Staff
of the Congolese armed forces. In early December, Mobutu's troops

captured Lumumba while he was traveling toward his stronghold at

Since the period in which the events under examination occurred,

- the names of many geographical units and governmental institutions
have changed. For instance, the nation formerly known as the Republic
of the Congo is now the Republic of Zaire and the present capital city,
Kinshasa, was known then as Leopoldville. For the sake of clarity in
dealing with many of the documents involved in this section, the names
used in this report are those which applied in the early 1960's, con-
temporaneously with the events under consideration.

Stanleyville, and he was imprisoned. The central government of
the Congo transferred Lumumba on January 17, 1961 to the custody
of guthorities in the province of Katanga, which was asserting its
own independence at that time. Several weeks later, the Katangese
authorities announced Lumumba's death.

There are various accounts of the circumstances and timing
of Lumumba's death. The United Nations investigation of the inci-
dent concluded. that Lumumba was killed on January 17.* :

2. Dulles Cables Leopoldville That "Removal". of Lumumba

is an Urgent Objective in “Wigh Quarters’

Shortly after the Congolese’ declaration. of independence

from Belgium on June 30, 1960, the CIA assigned a new Chief of
Station to the Congo. The Chief of Station said that’ the briefings :
he received at CIA headquarters in preparation for his departure’ ie
contained no discussion of the possibility of assassinating Patrice
Lumumba (Hedgman, 8/21/75, p. 8). On his brief return to head-
quarters in connection with Lumumba's visit to Washington in Late
July, the Chief of Station again heard no discussion of assassi-
nating Luiaumba (Hedgman, 8/21/75, p. 9).

During August, great concern about, Lumumba's political
strength in the Congo was growing among the foreign policy-makers

of the Eisenhower Administration.** This concern was nurtured

by intelligence reports such as that cabled to CIA headquarters

by the new Chief-of Station:.

THERE MAY BE LITTLE TIME. LEFT IN WHICH TAKE ACTION

Leopoldville to Director, 8/18/60.) ~

This cable also stated the Chief of Station's operational “OBJECTIVE
[OF] REPLACING LUMUMBA WITH PRO WESTERN GROUP" (CIA Cable, 8/18/60).
Bronson Tweedy, then Chief of the Africa Division of CIA's clan-
destine services, replied the same day that he was seeking State
Department approval for the proposed operation based upon "OUR
BELIEF LUMUMBA MUST BE REMOVED IF POSSIBLE" (CIA Cable Out 59741,
Tweedy to Leopoldville, 8/18/60). On.August 19, Richard Bissell,
Director of CIA's covert opérations branch, signed a follow-up
cable to Leopoldville: "YOU ARE AUTHORIZED PROCEED WITH OPERATION"
(CIA Cable OUT 59959, Director to Leopoldville, 8/19/60).

Several days later, the Chief of Station reported that a plan
to assassinate Lumumba had been proposed to President Kasavubu by

Congolese leaders:

ANTI-LUMUMBA LEADERS APPROACHED KASAVUBU

WITH PLAN ASSASSIWATE. LUMUMBA ... KASAVUBU
REFUSED AGREE SAYING HE RELUCTANT RESORT
VIOLENCE AND NO OTHER LEADER SUFFICIENT
STATURE REPLACE LUMUMBA. (CIA Cable IN 42761,
Leopoldville to Director, 8/24/60.)

DocId: 32423524 Page 254


This incident indicates that the CIA was aware that there was
some Congolese support for the assassination of Lumumba, but. that
the. moderate President of the Congo still respected Lumumba and
refused to consider assassination.

On August 25, 1960, Allen Dulles attended a meeting of the
Special Group -- the National Security Council subcommittee re-
sponsible for the planning of covert-operations:* In response to
the outline of some CIA plans for political actions against :
Lumumba, such as arranging a vote of no confidence by the Congolese
Parliament, the Special Assistant-to the President for National
Security Affairs reported that the President

had expressed extremely strong feelings
on the necessity for very straightforward
action in this situation, and he wondered

whether the plans as outlined were sufficient :
to accomplish this. (Special Group Minutes, 8/25/60.)

After this discussion, the Special Group

finally agreed that planning for the Congo
would not necessarily rule out "consideration"
of any particular kind of activity which might
contribute to getting rid of Lumumba.

(Special Group Minutes, 8/25/60.)

* This Special Group meeting and the testimony about its
significance on the issue of authorization is discussed in detail
in Section 5 (iii), infra.

HW 50955 Docld:32423524 Page 255


The next day, Allen Dulles personally signed a cable* to
the Leopoldville Chief of Station which stressed the urgency. of

"removing" Lumumba:

IN. HIGH QUARTERS** HERE IT IS THE CLEAR-
CUT CONCLUSION THAT IF LLL ~[LUMUMBA] CON-
TINUES TO HOLD HIGH OFFICE, THE INEVITABLE
RESULT WILL AT BEST BE CHAOS AND AT WORST
PAVE THE WAY TO COMMUNIST TAKEOVER OF THE
CONGO WITH DISASTROUS CONSEQUENCES FOR THE
PRESTIGE OF THE UN. AND FOR THE INTERESTS OF
THE FREE WORLD GENERALLY. CONSEQUENTLY
WE CONCLUDE THAT. HIS REMOVAL MUST BE AN
URGENT AND PRIME OBJECTIVE THAT UNDER EXISTING
CONDITIONS THIS SHOULD BE A HIGH PRIORITY OF
OUR COVERT ACTION. (CIA Cable, OUT 62966,
Director to Leopoldville,. 8/26/60.)

Dulles cabled that the Chief of Station was to be given "WIDER
AUTHORITY" -- along the lines of the previously authorized opera-
tion to replace Lumumba with a pro-Western group -- “INCLUDING
EVEN MORE AGGRESSIVE ACTION IF IT CAN REMAIN COVERT" (CIA Cable,
8/26/60). "WE REALIZE THAT TARGETS OF OPPORTUNITY MAY. PRESENT
THEMSELVES TO YOU,'' the cable continued (CIA Cable, 8/26/60).

* Cables issued under the personal signature of the DCI are
a relative rarity in CIA communitations and call attention to the
importance and sensitivity of the matter discussed.

** As discussed in Section 5(c), infra, Richard’ Bisell testified

that Allen Dulles would have used the phrase "higher quarters" to
refer to the President (Bissell, 9/10/75, p. 48). nna

HW 50955 Docld:32423524 Page 256


Dulles also authorized the expenditure of up to $100,000 "To
CARRY OUT ANY CRASII PROGRAMS ON WHICH YOU DO NOT HAVE THE OPPOR-
TUNITY TO CONSULT HQS" (CIA Cable, 8/26/60). He assured the °
Chief of Station that the message had been "SEEN AND APPROVED AT
COMPETENT LEVEL" in the State Department (CIA Cable, 8/26/60).
But the Director of Central Intelligence made a special point
of assuring the Chief of Station that he was authorized to act
unilaterally in a case where the United States Ambassador to the

Congo would prefer to remain uninfotmed:

TO THE EXTENT THAT AMBASSADOR MAY DESIRE

TO BE CONSULTED, YOU SHOULD SEEK HIS CON-

CURRENCE.. IF IN ANY PARTICULAR CASE, HE

DOES NOT WISH TO BE CONSULTED YOU CAN ACT

ON YOUR OWN AUTHORITY WHERE TIME DOES NOT

PERMIT REFERRAL HERE (CIA Cable, 8/26/60).
This mandate raises a question as to whether the DCI.was contem-
plating a particular form of action against Lumumba which the
Ambassador would want to be in a position to “plausibly. deny"
United States involvement. DDP Richard Bissell testified that he
was “almost certain" that he was informed about the Dulles cable
shortly after its transmission and that it was his "belief" that
the cable was a circumlocutious means of indicating that the

President wanted Lumumba to be killed (Bissell, 9/10/75, pp. 33
64-65) .* :

* See Section 5(c), infra, for additional testimony by Bissell
on the question of authorization for. the assassination effort
against Lumumba.

3. CIA Encourages Congolese Efforts to "Eliminate"
Lumumba, Whois Viewed as a "Grave Danger” Even After
- Being Deposed and Placed in UN Protective Custody

On September 5, 1960, President Kasavubu dismissed
Premier Lumumba from the government despite the strong support
for Lumumba that existed. in the Congolese Parliament. After losing
the ensuing power struggle with Kasavubu and Mobutu, who seized
the government by a military coup on September 14, Lumumba sought
protection from the United Nations peace-keeping: force. The
evidence indicates that the ouster of Lumumba from the government
did not alleviate the concern about. him in the United States govern- ~
ment.

Rather, the CIA and high Eisenhower Administration
officials* continued to view him as a threat, at least until ~
early December when he was captured by Mobutu's troops and im-
prisoned. During this period, CIA officers in the Congo advised
and aided Congolese contacts known to have any intent to kill
Lumumba. They also opposed the resumption of the democratic process
after the coup -- ‘by reopening the Parliament -- because of the
likelihood that this would.return Lumumba to power.

The day after Lumumba was deposed by Kasavubu, two CIA
officers met with a high level Congolese politician who had a
close relationship to the Leopoldville Station. The Station. re-

ported to CIA headquarters that the politician had made a response

* A detailed treatment of the expressions of continued concern
over Lumumba at the National Security Council level is set forth
in Section , infra.

to a remark by the Chief of Station that implied that ‘he might
assassinate. Lumumba:

TO COS COMMENT THAT LUMUMBA IN OPPOSITION IS

ALMOST AS DANGEROUS AS IN’ OFFICE, [THE

CONGOLESE POLITICIAN] INDICATED UNDERSTOOD

AND IMPLIED MIGHT PHYSICALLY ELIMINATE

LUMUMBA. (CIA Cable, IN 49679, Leopoldville

to Director, 9/7/60.)

The cable continued to report that the Chief of Station had offered
to assist this politician “IN-PREPARATION NEW GOVERNMENT PROGRAM"
and assured him that the United States would supply technicians
(CIA Cable, 9/7/60).

As the chaotic struggle for power raged, the Chief of ~
the Africa Division succinctly summarized the prevalent U: S.
apprehension’ about Lumumba's ability to influence évents in the
Congo by virtue of personality, irrespective of his official
position:

LUMUMBA TALENTS AND DYNAMISM APPEAR OVER-

RIDING FACTOR IN REESTABLISHING HIS POSITION

EACH TIME IT SEEMS, HALF LOST. IN OTHER WORDS

EACH TIME LUMUMBA HAS OPPORTUNITY HAVE LAST

WORD HE CAN SWAY EVENTS TO HIS ADVANTAGE.

(CIA Cable, OUT 69233, Director to Leopoldville,

9/13/60).

The day after Mobutu's coup, the Chief of Station reported
that he was serving as an advisor to a Congolese effort to "elimi-
nate" Lumumba due to his "fear" that Lumumba might, in fact, have

- been strengthened by placing himself in UN custody, which afforded

a safe base of operations:

(CIA Cable, IN 13374, Leopoldville to Director,

On September 17, another CIA operative in the Congo met
with a leading Congolese senator. At this meeting, the senator
requested a clandestine supply. of small arms to equip some
Congolese Army troops. The cable to CIA headquarters concerning .

the. meeting reported:

that they should

* This recommendation proved to be in line with large scale
planning at CIA headquarters for clandestine paramilitary support
to anti-Lumumba elements. On October 6, 1960, Richard Bissell and
Bronson Tweedy signed a cable concerning plans which the Chief of
Station was instructed not to discuss with State Department repre-
sentatives or operational contacts:

Throughout the fall of 1960, the CIA continued to view
Lumumba as a serious political threat while he remained in UN
protective ‘custody.* One concern was that if the Parliament --

which had been closed by the coup -- were re-opened and the moderates

* Both Richard Bissell and Bronson Tweedy, then Chief of the
CIA Africa Division, confirmed that the CIA continued to view
Lumumba as'a threat even after he placed himself in UN custody =
(Bissell, 9/10/75, pp. ; Tweedy, 9/9/75, pp. ). Both ape
Bissell and Tweedy.referred to two factors to substantiate this
view: first, Lumumba was a spellbinding orator with the ability
to stir masses of people to action; and second, the UN forces did
not restrain Lumumba's freedom of movement and the Congolese army
surrounding them were often lax in maintaining their:vigil.

at CIA headquarters was that foreign powers would intervene in
the Congo and bring. Lumumba to power (CIA Cable, OUT 81720, Director
to Leopoldville, 10/17/60). . Similarly, throughout this period
Lumumba was viewed by CIA officials and the Eisenhower Adminis-
tration** as a stalking horse for "what appeared to be a Soviet
effort to take over the Congo" (Hedgman, 8/21/75, pp. 10, 45).

During this period, the Leopoldville station continued to
maintain close operational relationships with, and offer aid to,

Congolese contacts who expressed a desire to assassinate Lumumb

although there is no direct evidence that aid was provided for the

specific purpose of assassination.

* A CIA Cable (IN 37289) from Leopoldville to the Director
on November 3, 1960 returns to this theme: the opening of the
Congolese Parliament by the United Nations is opposed because it
“WOULD: PROBABLY RETURN LUMUMBA TO POWER."

meetings.

4. The Plot to Assassinate Lumumba

In the. fall of 1960, a scientist from CIA headquarters
delivered to the Chief of Station in Leopoldville lethal bio-
logical substances to be used to assassinate Patrice Lumumba.
The Chief of Station testified that after requesting and receiving
confirmation from CIA headquarters that. he was to carry out the
scientist's instructions, he proceeded to take “exploratory steps"
in furtherance of the assassination plot. The Chief of Station
testified that in the coursé of his discussion with the CIA
scientist, Sidney Gottlieb, he was informed that President Eisenhower |
had ordered the assassination mission against Patrice Lumumba,
Gottlieb's mission to the Congo was both preceded and followed by 2
general cables urging the “elimination” of Lumumba sent from CIA

headquarters in an extraordinarily restricted "Eves Onlv" chamiel --

including two messages under thel personal signature of Allen Dulles.

The lethal substances were never used by the Chief of
Station. But despite the fact that Lumumba had placed himself in
the protective custody of the UN peace-keeping force shortly
before the poisons were delivered to the Chief of Station, there
is no clear evidence that the assassination. operation was termi-
nated before Lumumba's death. There is, however, no direct evidence
of a connection between the CIA assassination plot and the events

which actually led to Lumumba's death.*

ig See Section 6, infra, for a discussion of the evidence about
the circumstances that led to Lumumba's death in Katanga.

(a) Dulles Cables Again for "Elimination'' of Lumumba,
- and_a Messenger is Sent to Congo With a Highly

Sensitive Assignment
On September 19, 1960, several days after Lumumba placed him-

self in the protective custody of the United Nations peacekeeping
force in Leopoldville, Richard Bissell and Bronson Tweedy signed
a cryptic cable to Leopoldville to arrange a clandestine meeting

between the Chief of Station and "Sidney Braun,"' who was traveling

to the Congo on an unspecifiéd assignment:

("SID"] SHOULD ARRIVE APPROX 27 SEPT... . WILL

ANNOUNCE HIMSELF AS "SID-FROM PARIS". . . IT

URGENT YOU SHOULD SEE ["SID"] SOONEST POSSIBLE

AFTER HE PHONES YOU. HE WILL. FULLY IDENTIFY

HIMSELF AND EXPLAIN HIS ASSIGNMENT TO YOU. E
(CIA Cable, OUT 71464, Bissell/Tweedy to Chief we
of Station, 9/19/60.)

The cable bore a highly unusual sensitivity indicator --
"PROP" -- that restricted circulation at CIA headquarters to the

Chief of the Africa Division.*

* .In’a letter of September 23, 1975, the Chief of the CIA Review
Staff informed the Committee that "PROP" was normally used "to

denote sensitive personnel matters" (Seymour R. Bolton to Frederick
A. 0. Schwarz and Frederick D. Baron, 9/23/75. It appears that this
sensitivity indicator, while created for other purposes, was utilized
by Bissell, Tweedy, and. the Chief of Station to restrict distribution
of their communications about an assassination operation. The cable
traffic cited in this report that was sent through the PROP channel
did not touch upon personnel matters except in terms of recruiting
additional CIA officers and agents for the assassination operation.

HW 50955 DocId:32423524 Page 265


-16-

The Bissell/Tweedy cable informed the Chief of Station that
he was to continue to use this indicator for
ALL [CABLE] TRAFFIC THIS OP, WHICH YOU

INSTRUCTED HOLD ENTIRELY TO YOURSELF.
(CIA Cable, 9/19/60.)

The Chief of Station -- referred to herein as "Hedgman'"* --
testified to a clear, independent recollection of receiving such
a-cable, Hedgman stated that in September of 1960 he received a
"most unusual" cable from CIA headquarters (Hedgman, 8/21/75, .pp.
43). The cable advised, in his words, that:

someone who I would have recognized would

arrive with instructions for me....

believe the message was also marked for my

eyes only ... and contained instructions

that I was not to discuss the message with

anyone. (Hedgman, 8/21/75, pp. 12-13.)
Hedgman said that the cable did not specify the kind of ‘instruc-
tions he was to receive, and it "did not refer to Lumumba in any
way" (Hedgman, 8/21/75, p. 12).

Three days after the Bissell/Tweedy message that Hedgman was
to meet "Sid" in Leopoldville, Bronson Tweedy uses the same sensi-
tivity indicator on a cable sent to Hedgman on an "Eyes Only"

basis (CIA Cable, OUT 74837, Tweedy to Leopoldville, 9/22/60).

1l

* Due to fear of reprisal from Lumumba's followers, the Chief,

of Station for the Congo from mid-summer 1960 through 1961 testi-
fied under the alias "Hedgman" (iledgman, 8/21/75, p. 2; 8/25/75,
p. 4).

Tweedy's cable indicated that a third country national would be
required as an agent in the PROP operation:

IF DECIDED SUPPORT FOR PROP OBJECTIVES,

BELIEVE ESSENTIAL SUCH BE PROVIDED THROUGH

THIRD NATIONAL CHANNEL WITH [AMERICAN]

ROLE COMPLETELY CONCEALED.. (CIA Cable,

9/22/60.)
Tweedy expressed reservations about two agents that the station
was using for other operations and said "WE ARE CONSIDERING A
THIRD NATIONAL CUTOUT CONTACT CANDIDATE AVAILABLE HERE WHO MIGHT
FILL BILL"* (CIA Cable, 9/22/60). Despite Tweedy's concern about
the two existing station contacts, he indicated that the Chief of
station and his "colleague" -- presumably the man identified as
"Sid" who was to arrive in the Congo shortly to. explain the PROP
operation to Hedgman -- were to be afforded considerable Latitude
in exercising their judgment on the conduct of the operation:

YOU AND COLLEAGUE UNDERSTAND WE CANNOT READ

dispatched to the Congo. His mission is discussed in Sections
y and , infra.

On September 24, Allen Dulles personally issued a cable to

Leopoldville expressing in absolute terms his desire to “eliminate"’

Lumumba:

WE WISH GIVE EVERY. POSSIBLE SUPPORT IN
ELIMINATING LUMUMBA FROM ANY POSSIBILITY
RESUMING GOVERNMENTAL, POSITION OR IF HE
FAILS IN LEOP[OLDVILLE], SETTING HIMSELF
IN STANLEYVILLE OR ELSEWHERE. (CIA Cable,
QUT 73573, Dulles to Leopoldville, 9/24/60.)

Dulles had expressed a similar view three days before in the
presence of the President at an NSC meeting, stating:

Mobutu appeared tobe the effective power in
the Congo for the moment but Lumumba was not
yet. disposed of and remained a grave danger
as long as he was not disposed of. (NSC LA
Minutes, .9/21/60)

(b)- Gottlieb Delivers Lethal Substances to the Chief of
Station in the Congo for the Assassination of Lumumba

The Chief of Station reported through the PROP channel to Bronson
Tweedy that he had made contact with the man dispatched to Leopoldville
with a highly sensitive assignment on September 26. (CIA Cable
IN 18989, Leopoldville to Tweedy, 9/27/60) This was the same
week in which Dulles cabled about the "elimination" of Lumumba
and made his statement to the NSC about the “grave danger" that
existed as long as Lumumba was not "disposed of".

Hedgman testified about the identity of "'SID" -- the messenger
referred to in the first cable through the PROP channel:

Q: Who was the messenger who arrived?

Hedgman: Mr. Sidney Gottlieb

HW 50955 DocId:32423524 Page 268


NW 50955

aries eee

Q; And at that time, you knew who-he was?

Hedgman; I recognized him as an officer of the
Bency . . . . I believe he referred to the
fact that I had received a message and that he
was the person concerned. . (Hedgman, 8/21/75,
pp. 15-16)

The message carried by Gottlieb, then Science Advisor to

DDP Richard Bissell, was unmistakeably. clear according to Hedgman:

Hedgman: It is my recollection that he advised me, or
my instructions were, to eliminate Lumumba.

Q: By eliminate, do you mean assassinate?

Hedgman: Yes, I would say that was .. . my under*
standing of the primary means. I don't think it was
probably limited to that, if there was some other way
of doing it.

Q: Of doing what?

Hedgman: Of removing him from a position of political
threat. (Hedgman, 8/21/75, pp. 17-18.)

Hedgman said that he and Gottlieb also may have discussed non-
lethal means of removing Lumumba as a "political threat", but
he said, "I cannot recall with certainty on that'' (Hedgman,
8/21/75, p. 28).

He clearly recalled the discussion of assassination,
however:

Q: And what did Mr. Gottlieb indicate with regard to
the possibility of physically eliminating him?

Hedgman: It was my understanding that that was
probably expected of me. (Hedgman, 8/21/75, p. 18.)

And again:
Q: I take it that once you started discussing these
Tethal agents, there was no doubt in your mind that

the kind of elimination he was there particularly to
discuss was killing Lumumba?

Docld:32423524 Page 269


a ~20-

Hedgman: There was no doubt in. my mind that
this was one of the way[s], and probably what
they thought was the only way that would work
(Hedgman, 8/21/75, p. 25).

Hedgman explained Gottlieb provided him with poisons as a means

of assassination:

ee And what did he tell you with regard to
ow that might be accomplished?

Hedgman: ... He brought some biological agents.
Tvassume that that's the correct word. But in
any case, poisonous agent with him, which he
passed to me.... :

Q: These were lethal biological substances?

Hedgman: Yes. That was my understanding
as a non-expert. (Hedgman, 8/21/75, pp. 18-19.)

Hedgman testified that he received "rubber gloves, a mask, and a
syringe" along with the poisons and that Gottlieb instructed him
in their use (Hedgman, 8/21/75, pp. 20-21).- Hedgman indicated that

this paraphernalia was for administering the poisons to. Lumumba:

Q: [W]hen he [Gottlieb] came to the Congo
to give you lethal biological agents for

the assassination of Lumumba, was it clear
at that time that the means for administering
those biological agents was to inject them
into a substance that was to be ingested. by
Lumumba, whether. it be food,.or drink, or
toothpaste or any other substance that was

to be ingested?

Hedgman: That's my recollection, yes.
Gieigman, 8/21/75, p. 82; accord. p. 24.)

Hedgman said that the means of assassination was not restricted
to use of the poisons provided by Gottlieb:
This was not a sine qua non that I employ this.

If there were another method, another way, it
would have been acceptable, (Hedgman, 8/21/75, p. 19.)

HW 50955 DocId:32423524 Page 270


HW 50955

421-

For example, Hedgman testified that he may have "suggested" ~

shooting Lumumba to Gottlieb as an alternative to poisoning

(Hedgman, 8/21/75, pp: 27-29).
There was a firm requirement, however, that the means of assassi-
nation should not be traceable to the United States: .:
The biological substance, or specimens, what
have you, I think it was up’to my. judgment,
and if there was a better way -- certainly.
(T]he point I now recall was in.no way, if I
implemented these instructions, no way could
it be traced back--to the United States. It
had to be a way which could not be traced
back ... either to an American or the United
States government, (Hedgman, 8/21/75, p. 19.)
Hedgman said Gottlieb assured him that’ the poisons were pro-

duced to meet. this requirement:

I believe I raised the point that poisons left
traces in the human body, which could be found
on autopsy ... I believe that I was assured
that these ... lethal agents would [leave]
‘normal traces found in people that die of
certain diseases. (Hedgman, 8/21/75, p. 23.)

Hedgman said that he had an "emotional reaction of great sur-
prise" when it first became clear that Gottlieb was there to discuss
an assassination plan (Hedgman, 8/21/75, p. 30). But the Chief of
Station said that he did not give any indication that he would not
carry out the instructions (Hedgman, 8/21/75, p. 46). Instead, he
told Gottlieb he "would explore this" (Hedgman, 8/21/75, p. 46)
and left him with the following impression:

I think it would be a fair impression that he would

take away the thought that I was going to look into it
and try and figure if there was a way ... I believe I

DoclId:32423524 Page 271


~22-

stressed the difficulty of trying to carry
out such an operation. (Hedgman, 8/21/75,
- p. 47.)

The cable that Hedgman sent to headquarters reporting his
initial contact With Gottlieb was clearly an affirmative response
to the assignment. The Chief of Station said that he and Gottlieb
were "ON SAME WAVELENGTH." (CIA Cable IN 18989, Leopoldville to
Tweedy, 9/27/60.) Hedgman-was “afraid" that Mobutu's government
was "weakening under" foreign pressure to effect a reconciliation ~

with Lumumba, and said:

HENCE BELIEVE MOST RAPID ACTION CONSISTENT
WITH SECURITY INDICATED. (CIA Cable, 9/27/60.)

(c) Hedgman Testified That Gottlieb Told Him That
President Eisenhower Had Ordered the Assassination
of Lumumba

Hedgman testified that in the course of their meeting in
Leopoldville, Dr. Gottlieb informed him that President Eisenhower

had authorized the assassination of Lumumba:

Did you raise with him the question of authori-
zation of such instructions to you?

Hedgman: Yes, I did. That's my quite strong
recollection, that I did.

Q: What do you recall in essence was what you
said to him?

Hedgman: In essence, I- think I must have ... pointed
out that this was not a common or usual Agency tactic,
and I may have probably said that I never heard of

fu i it being done, which I had not, never in my training
or previous work in the Agency had I ever heard any
references to such, in my recollection at least, such
methods. And it is my recollection I asked on whose
authority these instructions were issued.

Q:. And what did Mr. Gottlieb reply?

HW 50955 Docld:32423524 Page 272


nok

Hedgman: It is my recollection that he identi-
- fied the President, and I cannot -- the President
of the United States -- and I cannot recall
whether he said "the President," or whether he
identified him by name. (Hedgman, 8/21/75,

pp. 30-31.)

Hedgman continued to explain that he was told "something to the
effect that the President had instructed the Director" (Hedgman,
8/21/75, pp. 32, 34). Hedgman was clear that the ultimate source
of. authority for the assassination mission was~the President:

Q: Your understanding then was that’ these

instructions were instructions coming to you

from the office of the President?

Hedgman: That's correct.

a Or that he had instructed the Agency, and
they were passed on to you?

Hedgman: That's right.

Q: You are not the.least unclear whether or
not you became aware with a very clear im-
pression that the President's name had been
invoked in some fashion?

Hedgman: Yes. I came -- certainly that is. my
recolléction.

Q: You have no doubt about that?
Q: At the time.
Hedgman: At the time, I certainly felt that I

was under instructions from the President, yes.
(Hedgman, 8/21/75, pp. 32-33.)

HW 50955 DocId:32423524 Page 273


HW 50955

-24-

Hedgman cautioned that he was récalling events long past:

Hedgman: Gentlemen, after fifteen years, I cannot
be f00 per cent certain, but I have always, since
that date, had the impression in my mind that these
orders had come from the President. (Hedgman,
8/21/75, ps 34.)

But he left no doubt about the strength of his “iimpression":

You have a very firm recollection that: he
feotelieb] represented to you that the President
of the: United States directed the assassination of
Patrice Lumumba, is that correct?

Hedgman: That's my recollection. Yes. (Hedgman,
Baty 75. p. 102; accord, p. 34.)

(d) Headquarters Makes the Assassination Plot “Highest
Priority” and Authorizes Steps in Furtherance of ft

On the basis of his talks with "Sid," Hedgman listed a
number of "possibilities" for covert action against Lumumba. At
the top of the list was the suggestion that a particular agent
be used in the following manner:

HAVE HIM TAKE REFUGE WITH BIG BROTHER.

WOULD THUS ACT AS INSIDE MAN. TO BRUSH UP

_ DETAILS TO RAZOR EDGE. (CIA Cable, 9/27/60.)
Hedgman indicated that he would begin to follow this course by re-
calling the agent to Leopoldville. (CIA Cable, 9/27/60.) We in-
formed headquarters: PLAN PROCEED ON BASIS PRIORITIES AS LISTED
ABOVE, UNLESS INSTRUCTED TO CONTRARY" (CIA Cable, 9/27/60).

On September 30, the Chief of Station urged that head-~

quarters authorize "exploratory conversations" with this agent so

DocId: 32423524 Page 274


HW 50955

~25-

that he could proceed with the plan that was his top priority:

TIVE CO} SJeea 6 Bes s 8, Bessrsteetee

.-. REQUEST HQS REPLY [IMMEDIATELY]. (CIA

Cable, IN 20857, Leopoldville to Tweedy,

9/30/60.)
Hedgman's cables -- sent for Tweedy's "Eyes Only" in the PROP
channel -- indicated that the assassination operation had been
mounted. . They show that a specific. operational plan had been set
in motion to the extent that Hedgman, thought that it would have
to be. clearly "cancelled" by headquarters before he would stop
proceeding with the plan. -Hedgman's description ofthe means
of maintaining the security of the operation could be taken as
a reference to a lethal biological agent which would be slow to
take effect or which would leave no traces:

ALTHOUGH TOO EARLY SEE SPECIFIC. DETAILS

[AGENT'S] PART IN OP, BELIEVE RISK MINI-

MIZED IF HE LEAVES AREA BEFORE EFFECTS. OP

ARE APPARENT. (CIA Cable, IN 20857,
Leopoldville to Tweedy.)

Docld:32423524 Page 275


The same day, through the PROP channel, Hedgman received
authorization from headquarters to proceed with his top priority
plan:

YOU ARE-AUTHORIZED HAVE EXPLORATORY TALKS --

WITH SCHOTROFFE TO ASSESS HIS ATTITUDE

TOWARD POSSIBLE ACTIVE AGENT OR CUTOUT ROLE.

... APPRECIATE MANNER YOUR APPROACH TO

PROBLEM. (CIA Cable, OUT 75900, Fields to

Leopoldville, 9/30/60.)
In this cable, Glenn Fields;~Assistant Chief of the Africa Division,
expressed a "HOPE ... FOR MODERATE HASTE" (CIA Cable OUT 75900,
Fields to Leopoldville, 9/30/60.)

According to the report of the Chief of Station, Gottlieb
left the Congo to return to headquarters on October 5 ih view of
the "EXPIRATION DATE HIS MATERIALS". (CIA Cable IN 24171, Leopold-
ville to Tweedy, 10/7/60). The "expiration". of Gottlieb's
"materials" probably refers to the date beyond which the substances

“ would no longer have lethal strength: Although the relation of
the "expiration date" to Gottlieb's departure is unclear from the
cables, it probably signifies that some of the biological substances
had lost their toxicity. Nonetheless, the Chief of Station indi-
cated that Gottlieb left some biological ‘substances that were still
lethal and that he intended to proceéd with the assassination
operation: i
{SID] LEFT CERTAIN ITEMS OF CONTINUING USE-
ea FULNESS. [CHIEF OF STATION] PLANS CONTINUE

TRY IMPLEMENT OP. (CIA Cable IN 24171,
Leopoldville to Tweedy, 10/7/60.)

HW 50955

S7e

By this point, Hedgman had conducted his “exploratory con-
versation" with the agent who was his best candidate for gaining
access to Lumumba (Hedgman, 8/21/75, p. 60). lIedgman testified
that the subject he "explored" was the agent's ability to find a
means to inject poison into Lumumba's food or toothpaste (Hedgman,

8/21/75, p. 60):

I believe that I queried the agent who had |
access to Lumumba, and his entourage, in
detail about just-what that access, what
access he actually had, as. opposed to speak-
ing to people. In other words, did he have
access to the bathroom, did he have access
to the kitchen, things of that sort. E

I have a recollection of having queried him
on that without specifying why I wanted to
know this. (Hedgman, 8/21/75, p. 48.)

On October 7, the Chief of Station reported to headquarters

on this meeting:
|

|
; CONDUCTED EXPLORATORY CONVERSATION WITH
{AGENT} ... AFTER EXPLORING ALL POSSIBILITIES
{AGENT] SUGGESTED SOLUTION RECOMMENDED BY
HQS. ALTHOUGH DID NOT PICK UP BALL, BELIEVE
HE PREPARED TAKE ANY ROLE NECESSARY WITHIN
LIMITS SECURITY ACCOMPLISH OBJECTIVE.

Hedgman testified that his exploratory steps left him with

doubts about the wisdom or practicality of the assassination plot

(C]ertainly I looked on it as a pretty wild
scheme professionally. I did not think that
it... was practical professionally.

Certainly ... to keep the U.S. out of it....

I explored it, but I doubt that I ever really
expected to carry it out. (Hedgman, 8/21/75, Pee)

DoclId:32423524 Page 277


~28-

However, his cables indicate that he was planning to con-
tinue. to implement the operation and sought the resources to do
it successfully. Ie urged headquarters to send him an alternate
operative for the assassination mission in the event that they

found his first choice unacceptable:

IF HQS BELIEVE [AGENT'S CIRCUMSTANCES }
BAR HIS PARTICIPATION, WISH STRESS NECES-
SITY PROVIDE STATION WITH QUALIFIED THIRD
COUNTRY NATIONAL. (CIA Cable. IN 24171,
Leopoldville to Tweedy, 10/7/60.) °--

Tweedy cabled the Chief of Station the same day that he "HAD
GOOD DISCUSSION YOUR COLLEAGUE 7 OCT" -- presumably referring to
a de-briefing of Gottlieb upon his return.to the United States.
(CIA Cable OUT 78336, Tweedy to Leopoldville, 10/7/60.) Tweedy
indicated that he was

CONSIDERING DISPATCHING THIRD COUNTRY
NATIONAL OPERATOR WHO, WHEN HE ARRIVES,
SHOULD THEN BE ASSESSED BY YOU OVER
PERIOD TO SEE WHETHER HE MIGHT PLAY
ACTIVE OR CUTOUT ROLE ON FULL TIME BASIS.
(CIA Cable OUT 78336, Tweedy to Chief of
Station, 10/7/60.)

This expression of support for the operation was followed by
an: extraordinary pair of cables from headquarters on October 15,
1960. One.of these cables was issued by a desk officer in CIA's
Africa Division and released under Bronson Tweedy's signature, as

Division Chief, and sent to Leopoldville through standard CIA

channels, which would allow for distribution of the message to

HW 50955 Docld:32423524 Page 278


~29-

appropriate personnel in the CIA station and the United States
embassy. This cabie ... generally discussed the possibility of
covertly supplying certain Congolese leaders with funds and
military aid (CIA Cable OUT 81476, Director to Leopoldville,
10/15/60). This cable also delimited the kind of action against

Lumumba that would be authorized:

ONLY DIRECT ACTION WE CAN WOW. STAND BEHIND
IS TO SUPPORT IMMOBILIZING OR ARRESTING
{[LUMUMBA], DESIRABLE AS MORE DEFINIEIVE
ACTION NIGHT BE. ANY ACTION TAKEN WOULD
HAVE TO BE ENTIRELY CONGOLESE. (CIA Cable
OUT 81476, Director to Leopoldville,
10/15/60.)

On the same day that this message was dispatched, a second
cable was sent to Leopoldville. This cable was issued personally
by Bronson, Tweedy and sent in the special PROP channel for
Hedgman's "EYES ONLY" (CIA Cable OUT 81396, Tweedy to Chief of
Station, 10/15/60).

YOU WILL NOTE FROM CABLE THROUGH NORMAL
CHANNEL CURRENTLY BEING TRANSMITTED A’ PARA[GRAPH]
ON PROP TYPE SUGGESTIONS. YOU WILL PROBABLY RE-
CEIVE MORE ALONG THESE LINES AS STUMBLING BLOC
{LUMUMBA] REPRESENTS INCREASINGLY APPARENT ALL

POSITION SPONTANEOUSLY BECOMES NUMBER ONE CON-
SIDERATION.

APPARENT DUPLICATION. THIS CHANNEL REMAINS FOR
SPECIFIC PURPOSE YOU DISCUSSED WITH COLLEAGUE AND ~
ALSO REMAINS HIGHEST PRIORITY. (CIA Cable OUT
81396, Tweedy to Chief of Station, 10/15/60).

ey
Thus, Tweedy resolved the apparent duplication of cables by indi-

cating that communications about the assassination mission were

HW 50955 DocId:32423524 Page 279


~30-

.restricted to the PROP channel and that the assassination
mission was to move forward. He went on to request Hedgman's
reaction to the prospect of sending a senior CIA case officer to
the Congo on a ‘DIRECTED ASSIGNMENT ... TO CONCENTRATE ENTIRELY
THIS ASPECT" (CIA Cable OUT 81396, Tweedy to Chief of Station,
10/15/60). This referred to CIA officer Justin O'Donnell, who
testified that in late October he was asked by Richard Bissell to
undertake the mission of assassinating Lumumba.*

In the course of suggesting the assignment of an additional ~
officer’ to the Congo, the cable provided insight into the reason
that the assassination mission had not progressed more rapidly

under the Chief of Station:

SEEMS TO US YOUR OTHER COMMITMENTS TOO HEAVY
GIVE NECESSARY CONCENTRATION PROP. (CIA
Cable OUT 81396, Tweedy to Chief of Station,
10/15/60.)

Again, in contradiction of the limitations on anti-Lumumba
activity outlined in the cable sent through normal channels,

Tweedy's cable also proposed a plan to kidnap Lumumba:

POSSIBILITY USE COMMANDO TYPE GROUP FOR
- ABDUCTION [LUMUMBA], EITHER VIA ASSAULT
ON HOUSE UP CLIFF FROM RIVER OR, MORE
PROBABLY, IF [LUMUMBA] ATTEMPTS ANOTHER
BREAKOUT INTO TOWN ... REQUEST YOUR VIEWS.
(CIA Cable OUT 81396, Tweedy to Chief of
Station, 10/15/60.)

This series of cables sent - during, and after
Gottlieb's visit. to the Congo’ demonstrated a clear intent at CIA
headquarters to authorize and support. rapid progress on the assassi-
nation mission. The cables also show an intent to severely re-
strict, knowledge of the assassination operation amongofficers in
CIA's Africa Division and among United States personnel in the
Congo, including those who were aware of and involved in other
covert activities.

(e) The Chief of Station Moves Forward With Assassination
PIot

The testimony of the Chief of Station, taken fifteen
years after the events in question and without benefit of review
of the cables discussed above, was compatible with the picture =
derived from the cables of a fully authorized and tightly restricted
assassination operation, Hedgman's testimony is at variance from
the cables only with respect to the lack of vigor with which he
claims to have pursued the assignment which he dealt with in an

affirmative, aggressive manner in the cables.

(i) The Chief of Station Testified That He Requested
and Received Confirmation of the Assassination

Plan from Headquarters

Hedgman testified that, after receiving Gottlieb's

instructions, he cabled CIA headquarters seeking confirmation that

he was to carry out Gottlieb's instructions (Hedgman, 8/21/75,

p. 36). Hedgman did not recall whether he identified Gottlieb by
= name, and he doubted that he "would have" mentioned the President

in such a cable (Hedgman, 8/21/75, pp. 36, 43).

Hedgman described the extradrdinary security precautions he
took cabling his. request for confirmation of the assassination in-
structions :’

There was some special channel ... because __
it was handled differently than any other
normal méssage. For example, it was not put
. on a regular cable form, which, you know,
you have ‘several copies for your various files.
And it was my recollection that I personally
carried the message to the communicator to
encrypt, and that was worded in-a doublt-talk
way that even the-communicator would not
necessarily know what it was about."
(Hedgman, 8/21/75, pp. 42-43.)
This description approximates the PROP channel that was used for
all cables relating to the assassination mission.

Hedgman testified that soon after cabling his request for con-
firmation that he was to carry out the assassination assignment
he received an affirmative reply from headquarters:

I'believe I received a reply which I interpreted
to mean yes, that he was the messenger and his
instructions were ... duly authorized.
(Hedgman, 8/21/75, pp. 37-38.)
Despite the cryptic nature of the cables, Hedgman said "I was con-
vinced that yes,. it was right." (Hedgman, 8/21/75, pp. 44, 50.)
Hedgman did not recall receiving any indication, either from
Gottlieb or by cable, that he was to’ await further authorization
eS
before using the poisons (Hedgman, 8/21/75, p. 38). Hedgman ex-
oo pressed some uncertainty about whether he “had an absolute free

hand" to proceed with an assassination attempt without receiving

“final confirmation" (Hedgman, 8/21/75, pp. 38, 47, 53).

Hedgman summarized his testimony on this-question in his

second appearance:

I, probably had authority to act on my own
but ... it was possible that I had to go
back and get clearance for'my action. e
(Hedgman, 8/25/75, p. 11; see also 8/21/75,
p. 39.)

Hedgman testified, however, that a "policy decision" had been
made -- that assassination had been "approved" as "one means" of
eliminating Lumumba as a political threat (Hedgman, 8/21/75, p. 52).

I thought the policy decision had been made

in the White House, not in the Agency, and

that the Agency had been selected as’ the

Executive Agent, if you will, to carry out

a political decision. . (Hedgman, 8/21/75, p. 52.)
Although Hedgman assumed that the President had not personally
selected the means of assassination, he testified that he was under
the impression ‘that the President had authorized the CIA to do so
and to proceed to take action:

Hedgman:. ... L doubt that I thought the

President had said, you use this system.

But my understanding is the President had

made a decision that an act should take

place, but then put that into the hands of

the Agency to carry out his decision.

Q: Whatever that act was to be, it was

clearly. to be assassination or the death : -
of the foreign political leader?

Hedgman: Yes.
Q: Instigated by the CIA, initiated by the CIA?
Hedgman: Certainly if those -- if Dr, Gottlieb's

Tethal agents were employed, that would have been «
the result, yes. (Hedgman, 8/21/75, p. 104.)

DocId:32423524 Page 283


LV Aas

Nonetheless, Hedgman said he had no "desire to carry out
these instructions" (Hedgman, 8/21/75, p. 106). Whether or. not
he felt there was authority to attempt an assassination without

seeking final confirmation, he said that he would have checked

with headquarters before taking action:

I think probably that. I would have gone back
and advised that I intended to carry out and
sought final approval before: carrying it out
had I been going to do it, had there been a
way todo it. I-did not see it as -.. a
matter which could be accomplished practically,
certainly. (Hedgman, 8/21/75, pp. 51-52.)

He proceeded to affirm that his reason for seeking a final approval
would have been to receive assurances about the practicality of the.
specific mode of assassination that he planned to use (Hedgman,
8/21/75, p. 53).

(ii) The Chief of Station Took “Exploratory Steps" in

Furtherance of the Assassination Plot and Testified
That He Destroyed Cable Traffic Related to the Plot

Hedgman ‘testified that after Gottlieb's visit, he locked
the lethal substances in the bottom drawer of his safe, “probably”
sealed in an envelope marked "Eyes Only" with his name on it
(Hedgman, 8/21/75, pp. 48-49) . He said that his secretary was
the only other person with access to the safe and that she would
not have examined a package marked in this fashion (Hedgman, 8/21/75,
p. 49). i ‘

Hedgman testified that it was "possible" that he pre-

served the poisons in his safe until after Lumumba's death; at any

HW 50955 DocId:32423524 Page 284


HW 50955

rate, they were not disposed of before Lumumba was "successfully
neutralized" by being captured and imprisoned by the Congolese
government ‘(Hedgman, 8/21/75, pp. 85-86) at the beginning of
December, 1960. Hedgman said that he does. not recall taking the
poisons out of his. safe on any occasion other than when he disposed
of them on the banks of the Congo River:

I think that I took them out probably ina

briefcase; or an air bag of some sort, and

I believe that the things like the rubber

gloves and the mask were thrown away in a

bushy area or something where; you know, if

they were found, it didn't matter that much.

I believe I buried the other matters.

(Hedgman, 8/21/75, p. 84.)

Hedgman testified, however, that in. the intervening months,
while the poisons were in his safe, he took "exploratory steps"
in furtherance of the assassination plot (Hedgman, 8/21/75, p. 60).
He said that he sent several cables to CIA headquarters, after his
request for confirmation of the assassination instructions, which
“probably reflected further steps I had taken" (Hedgman, 8/21/75,
pp. 59-60).

Hedgman stated that his cables to headquarters on this matter
were essentially “progress reports" on his attempts to find a means
of access to Lumumba (Hedgman, 8/21/75, p..50). He also said that
he "would bet on the fact that there was’ at least one or two more

[cables] back" to him from CIA headquarters in response (Hedgman,

8/21/75, p. 50).

The cable traffic ‘conforms to Hedgman's recollection, For
two months.after: Gottlieb's arrival in the Congo, a regular stream
of messages flowed between the Leopoldville Chief of Station and
headquarters through the PROP channel. In late September and’ early
October’ the cables concerned the initiation of Hedgmati's top priority
plan ~- recruiting the aid ofa particular agent thought to have
sufficient access to Lumumba's entourage to be able to poison
Lumumba.* _ In mid-October, Tweedy notified the Chief of Station
that the’ assassination mission remained "HIGHEST PRIORITY", ° and
he suggested sending additional. personnel to Leopoldville to in- :
tensify "CONCENTRATION" on this operation (CIA Cable OUT 81396, Tweedy
to Chief of Station, 10/15/60) .**

IN 28936, Chief of Station to Tweedy,

Hedgman testified that this operative left Leopoldville "sometime
in October" which terminated their discussions about gaining access +
to Lumumba for the purpose of assassinating him (Hedgman, 8/21/75,
p. 61). The Chief of Station continued to communicate with head-

quarters about finding a means to move forward with the assassina—

tion operation and securing the necessary manpower to do so.

Hedgman confirmed Tweedy's’ view that although the assassination
operation was still his highest priority, he was overburdened with .
responsibility for other operations so that he could not concentrate
on the progress of the assassination mission:

ALTHOUGH MAINTAINING PRIORITY INTEREST THIS
OP, ABLE DEVOTE ONLY LIMITED AMOUNT TIME,
VIEW MULTIPLE OPS COMMITMENTS. (CIA Cable,
IN 28936, 10/17/60.)

Due to his workload, the Chief of Station responded enthusiastically

to Tweedy's suggestion of an additional case officer:
BELIEVE EARLY ASSIGNMENT SENIOR CASE OFFICER

OFFICER AVAILABLE [CHIEF OF STATION] WOULD
DEVOTE AS MUCH TIME AS POSSIBLE TO ASSISTING -

a AND DIRECTING HIS EFFORTS. (CIA Cable
IN 28936,. 10/17/60.)

HW 50955 Docld:32423524 Page 287


-38-

The Chief of Station concluded this cable with the following
cryptic recommendation, reminiscent of his testimony that he
may have "suggested" shooting Lumumba to Gottlieb as an alternative
to poisoning (liedgman, 8/21/75, pp. 27-29):

IF CASE OFFICER SENT, RECOMMEND HQs

POUCH SOONEST HIGH POWERED FOREIGN MAKE Lt

HUNTING GOOD HERE WHEN LIGHTS RIGHT.

HOWEVER AS HUNTING RIFLES NOW FORBIDDEN,

WOULD KEEP RIFLE IN OFFICE PENDING OPENING

10/17/60.)

The first sentence of Hedgman's recommendation clearly refers
to sending a sniper rifle to the Congo via diplomatic pouch. The :
rest of the message is probably an oblique reference to the
possibility of shooting Lumumba ‘at the "OPENING OF HUNTING SEASON" --
in other words, at the first opportunity to find Lumumba outside
the residence where he remained in UN protective custody. This
interpretation is bolstered by a report sent the next month by
the Chief of Station through the PROP channel for Tweedy's "EYES
ALONE." Hedgman's cable described the stalemate which. prevailed from
mid-September until Lumumba's. departure for Stanleyville on
November 27; Lumumba was virtually a prisoner in UN custody, but
inaccessible to CIA agents and the Congolese:

Hedgman testified that all of his cable traffic about the
assassination question would-have been sent with the same
extraordinarily stringent security precautions -- presumably re-
ferring to the PROP channel -- which concerned Gottlieb's visit
and the confirmation of authorization for his instructions:
I would have sent in a special channel
anything dealing with Lumumba, at least

that would touch upon his removal in one
way or another. (Hedgman, 8/21/75, p. 62.)

The Chief of Station also testified that sometime. before
leaving the Station, he destroyed all cable traffic relating to
the assassination mission (Hedgman, 8/21/75, p. 89). Hedgman 's
best recollection was that he had received instructions to destroy
those cables (Hedgman, 8/21/75, p.'96). Hedgman said he had never
before in his tenure as Chief of Station in the Congo. destroyed
cable traffic because of its sensitivity (Hedgman, 8/21/75, p. 91).
But he stated that the cables relating to assassination were

destroyed because of their extremely sensitive nature.* He said

* It is possible that copies of cables dealing with such a
sensitive operation were also destroyed at CIA headquarters.

DocId:32423524 Page 289

that eventually

I destroyed a great deal of traffic, because
the Congo was a highly sensitive area in
which -- at one period I recall we had all
of our files in the burn barrels. I mean,
when you wanted a file, you went over and
dug it out of the burn barrell. (Hedgman,
8/21/75, p. 91.)

At the conclusion of his testimony about.the assassination
plot, the Chief of Station was asked to give a general characteri-_
zation of the advisability “of the plot and the tenor of the times
in which it took place. His response indicated that although he-

-was willing to carry out what he considered a duly authorized
order, he was not convinced of the necessity of assassinating

Lumumba:

I looked upon the Agency as an executive
arm of the Presidency.... Therefore, I
suppose I thought that it was an order
issued in due form from an authorized
authority.

On the other hand, I looked at it as a
kind of operation that I could do without,
that I thought that probably the Agency
and the U.S. government could get along
without. I didn't regard Lumumba as the
kind of person who was going to bring on
World War III or something.

I might have had a somewhat different
attitude if I thought that one man could
bring on World War III and result in the :
deaths of millions of people or something,
but I didn't see him in that light. I saw
him-as a danger to the political position
= of the United States in Africa, but
nothing more than that. (Hedgman, 8/21/75,
pp. 110-111.)

~ (£) Testimony of Bissell and Tweedy About the Degree
of Support for and Ferpetration of the Assassination
P

Tot /

There is a great variance between the testimony of Richard
Bissell and Bronson Tweedy and the picture of the assassination
plot presented by the Chief of Station and the cable traffic from
the period. While the weight of the evidence demonstrates that
the assassination effort was the “highest pricrity'' at CIA head-
quarters among operations in the Congo, Bissell has no direct
recollection of Gottlieb's mission to the Congo and Tweedy can
recall nothing more than consideration of the feasibility of an
assassination attempt.

(i) Tweedy Had No Recollection of the Operation
To Poison Lumumba

As Chief of the Africa Division, Bronson Tweedy was .the ea
liaison at CIA headquarters with the:Chief of Station in Leopoldville
for all instructions, plans, and progress reports concerning the
effort to assassinate Lumumba, which were communicated through the
special PROP channel. Most of the reports and recommendations
cabled to headquarters by the Chief of Station on the assassination
operation were marked for Tweedy's "Eyes Only."

Tweedy: personally signed both the cable which initially informed
the Chief of Station that "SID" would arrive in. Leopoldville, with

an assignment (CIA Cable OUT 71464, Bissell/Tweedy to Chief of

HW 50955 DocId:32423524 Page 291


-42-

Station, 9/19/60) and the cable of October 7 indicating that he
had debriefed Gottlieb upon his. return from the Congo (CIA Cable
OUT 78336, Tweedy to Chief of Station, 10/7/60). ‘Tweedy was also
the "Eyes Only" recipient of.Hedgman's reports on Gottlieb's
arrival in the Congo (CIA Cable IN 18989, Chief of Station to
Tweedy, 9/27/60) and the subsequent communications about the plan
which emerged from the discussions between Gottlieb and Hedgman
as the top priority -- infiltration of an agent into Lumumba's en-
tourage to administer a lethal poison to the Congolese leader (CIA
Cable IN 20857, Chief of Station to Tweedy, 9/30/60; CIA Cable,
Chief of Station to Tweedy, 10/7/60; CIA Cable, Chief of Station
to. Tweedy, 10/17/60).
Tweedy testified, however, without benefit of reviewing these

cables, that he had no knowledge of the plot to poison Lumumba:

9. Do you have any knowledge of a messenger

from CIA headquarters having to go to the Congo

to provide the Chief of Station in the Congo

with instructions to carry out the assassination

of Lumumba, if possible, and also provide him

with the tools to carry out such an assassination,

namely, poisons and medical equipment for admin-
istering them?

Mr. Tweedy. No, I do not. (Tweedy, 9/9/75, pp. 30-31)

See Sections 4(a) - 4(e) for full treatment of the cables sent
in the PROP channel between Tweedy and the Chief of Station in
Leopoldville.

HW 50955 DocId:32423524 Page 292


-43-

When asked his opinion about the truth of the testimony received
by the Committee that poisons were delivered to. the Congo by
Gottlieb, who carried instructions that they were to be used in
the assassination of Lumumba, Tweedy replied: a

There is nothing in my experience with the

Agency which would really bear on that

point whatsoever. (Tweedy, 9/9, pp. 29-39)

Tweedy added that if Gottlieb went to the.Congo as a courier,

"I will bet I knew it, but I°don't recall it" (Tweedy, 9/9, p. 35).
Tweedy testified that it was "perfectly possible" for lethal bio-

logical substances to have been sent to the Congo, "but I don't

recall it" (Tweedy, 9/9, p. 30).

In response to a question about whether he knew about a cable
from headquarters informing Hedgman that a messenger was to come to
the Congo with instructions for him, Tweedy said that he would be
“very surprised if I didn't [know], but I certainly have no recoll-
ection of it whatsoever (Tweedy, 9/9, p. 31).

Tweedy said that he "was not going to gainsay" the testimony of
the Chief of Station that a cable was sent to headquarters through
a special channel requesting confirmation that the instructions
were to be carried out but he did not recall it (Tweedy, 9/9, pp.
32-33).

Tweedy commented that rather than questioning the truth of the

testimony of the Chief of Station,* the discrepancies in their

*

Tweedy expressed a high regard for the general credibility of the
Chief of Station. Tweedy said that he never had occasion to doubt
Hedgman's veracity or integrity, adding, "I would trust his memory
and I certainly trust his integrity." (Tweedy, 9/9, p. 36)

HW 50955 Docld:32423524 Page 293


~44-

testimony could be attributed to his own lack of recall:

IT’really am having trouble with this. I had to

be reminded of so many things. . .[T]he things
that I recall the most vividly about’ all my
African experiences were. . . the.things I was

basically concerned with all the time, which was
putting this. division together and the rest of
it. When it comes to operational detail I start
fuzzy and you would have thought with something
like thinking about Mr. Lumumba in these terms,
that I would have gone to bed and got up thinking
about Lumumba, I can assure you this wasn't the
case. (Tweedy, 9/9, p. 34)

Tweedy was firm, however, in his disbelief that ."Gottlieb would
have left instructions with the Chief of Station which would have
empowered [him]. . . to go out and assassinate Lumumba, without any

further recourse or reference to headquarters" (Tweedy, 9/9, pp. 32

36). Tweedy said:

In such a matter of-this kind, headquarters would
have wanted to have a last word up to the last
minute. (Tweedy, 9/9, p. 36)

(ii) Tweedy. Testified That He Discussed With Bissell
the Feasibility of Assassinating Lumumba and He
Cabled Hedgman About Gaining Access to Lumumba
For the Purpose of Assassination ~

Despite Tweedy's lack of recollection about the acttial plot to
poison Lumumba, he did recall exploring the feasibility of an assass-
ination attempt.

Tweedy testified that he had discussed the subject of assassinating
Lumumba "more than once" with Richard Bissell in the fall of 1960

(Tweedy, 9/9, pp. 14-15). Tweedy stated that he did not know

HW 50955 Docld:32423524 Page 294


whether Bissell had consulted with any “higher authority" about
exploring the possibilities for assassinating Lumumba: (Tweedy,
9/9, p. 28). ° Generally, Tweedy said, when he received an instruc-
tion: from Bissell he would proceed to implement it om-the assump-
tion that it was fully authorized above the level of DDP:

I would proceed with it on the basis that he
was authorized to give me instructions and it
was up to him to bloody well know what he was
empowered to tell_me to do. (Tweedy, 9/9, p.13) -

Tweedy characterized his discussions with Bissell about assass-
inating Lumumba as "contingency planning" (Tweedy, 9/9/75, p. 28):~

Tweedy. . . .I think it. came up in the sense that
Dick would have said we probably better be
thinking about whether it might ever be necessary
or desirable to get rid of Lumumba, in which case
we presumably should be in position to assess
whether we could do it or not successfully.

Q. Do it, meaning carry off an assassination?

Tweedy. Yes, but it was never discussed with him
in any other sense but a planning exercise, ...
never were we instructed to do anything of this.
kind. We were instructed to ask whether such a
thing would be feasible and to have the Chief of
Station be thinking along those lines ‘as well.
(Tweedy, 9/9, p. 15)

Tweedy said that the planning that ‘he undertook pursuant to his con-
versation with Bissell included "a few'' cables that he remembers
sending to the Chief of Station asking him

to keep in mind what sort of access one might ever”

have had to Lumumba. . .[in] the eventuality that

we might wish to get-rid of Mr. Lumumba personally.
a (Tweedy, 9/9, pp. 19-21)

HW 50955 DocId:32423524 Page 295


-46~

Tweedy did not recall inquiring about gaining access to Lumumba. for,
the purpose of abducting him from UN. custody. (Tweedy, 9/9, p.. 24);
rather he "supposed" that various means of assassination were

being explored: ee

Q. Would this be access to shoot him or would this
be access to his personal food or, drink or toiletries?

Tweedy. JI suppose all. those types of things might
have been considered. (Tweedy, 9/9, p. 23)

Q. . In your discussions with Bissell; about.the
feasibility of an assassination operation, did
poisons come up as one means that was.being con-
sidered and which the Chief of Station should explore?

Tweedy. JI am sure it must have. After all, there
are not many ways of doing it. Shoot a man; poison
him, of course you could, I suppose, stab him or ereeee
something like that. But basically you are talking

about a contingency plan which I assume has. the best
possibility of protecting the involvement of the U.S.
Government and if you want to do it in a manner which
would be as distant, if that is the right word, as
possible, I think poison would then stand high on

the list of possibilities.

Tweedy did not "recall specifically" the response from the Chief
of Station, but said he was "sure" that he received "a serious
answer. . . a disciplined reply to an instruction from headquarters”
(Tweedy, 9/9, pp. 23,27).

Although Tweedy did not recall sending or receiving cables ina
special channel concerning the "messenger" to the Congo or confirm-
ation of his instructions, he acknowledged that the cables exploring

access to Lumumba for the purpose of assassination would have been

HW 50955 DocId:32423524 Page 296


-47-

sent in’a channel that was even more closely restricted than -the~

normal CIA ‘cable traffic (Tweedy, 9/9, pp. 22, 32-33). Tweedy
said destruction of such cable traffic would have been left to the
discretion of the Chief of Station and he did not, know whether
Hedgman destroyed the Station's copies (Tweedy, 9/9, p. 22).
Tweedy said "I would be surprised if I didn't" have a conver-

sation with Sidney Gottlieb about "anything in his inventory. that

could possibly be used, inéliding lethal biological stibstances
(Tweedy, 9/9, pp. 68-69). Tweedy "suspected" that “the first
conversation along these lines would undoubtedly have been held

between Dick Bissell and Sidney Gottlieb," which Tweedy then would

have "followed-up" (Tweedy, 9/9, p. 69).

Tweedy maintained that the period in which he explored the
means of access for assassinating Lumumba remained "a planning
interval and at no point can I recall that I ever felt it was im-
minent that somebody would say ‘go'" (Tweedy, 9/9.. pp. 18-19):

Tweedy. It was always my assumption that at the .
time anything like this should occur there would
have been some kind of real focus on the problem
at. probably .a very considerable policy level with-
in the Agency. . . and it never occurred to me that
I would get a call or Bissell would ask me to come
down ‘to his office and-sya go.to it. Nor were we
ever in a position where he said that I would
merely implement plan so-and-so, We never got
that far.

°Q. You didn't have any action plans for the

assassination of Lumumba that you had prepared or
na were aware of?

HW 50955 DocId:32423524 Page 297


-48-

Tweedy.. No. Planning, yes, but nothing that
- ever got anywhere. (Tweedy, 9/9, p. 19)

It is difficult to reconcile the cable traffic with Tweedy's
testimony that no action plans were launched and that no authoriz-
ation for implementing the assassination operation, authorization
for Hedgman's approach to his agent to explore access to. Lumumba's
entourage is in accord with Tweedy's description of his inquiries
about gaining access to Lumumba .

However, the fact that Tweedy was personnaly informed that the
Chief of Station "PLANS CONTINUE TRY IMPLEMENT OP" (CIA Cable IN”
24171, Chief of Station to Tweedy, 10/7/60) is harder to reconcile
with his statements that a "go ahead" on the operation was never eet
imminent, especially in light of Tweedy's PROP cable the next week
which told the Chief of Station that Lumumba's ,

CONSIDERATION. . . THIS CHANNEL. REMAINS FOR
SPECIFIC PURPOSE YOU DISCUSSED WITH COLLEAGUE
AND ALSO REMAINS HIGHEST PRIORITY (CIA Cable
OUT 81396, Tweedy to Chief of Station, 10/15/60)
(iii) Bissell Testified That He Did Not Recall
Whether The Assassination Operation Had
Moved From Planning To Implementation

But It Was Not Against Agency Policy to
Send Poisons to The Congo —

Richard Bissell testified that he did not remember discussing

Bissell said he

‘may have" given Tweedy specific instructions about

not remember to do so (Bissell, 9/10,p.4). Bissell said that
exploring access to Lumumba --"almost certainly" seeking information
from the Chief of Station about access for poisoning -- would have
been a "key part" of his "planning and preparatory activity" but

he had no specific recollection of cable communicacione on this
subject (Bissell, 9/10, ppx 6-8). Bissell remembered that he was —
aware that the Chief of Station had an agent thought to have direct
access to Lumumba (Bissell, 9/10, p. 80). '

Bissell testified that hé "most certainly" approved any cables
that Tweedy sent to the Chief .of Station seeking information about
gaining access to Lumumba but it was so sensitive a matter (Bissell
9/10, p. 8) Bissell added:

I think Mr. Tweedy, on the basis of an oral author-
ization from me, would have had the authority to
send such a cable without my signing off on it.
(Bissell, 9/10, p. 8)

Bissell believed that Tweedy would have known of Gottlieb's trip
to. the Congo, although it was possible that Tweedy was "cut out of
knowledge of the specific operation" (Bissell, 9/10, p. 21).
Bissell's lack of recollection of discussing his, assignment to

Justin O'Donnell*with Tweedy was the reason for his speculation that

* Bissell's assignment to O'Donnell is discussed in Sections 5(a)

(i) and 5(a) (ii), infra.

Tweedy might have been unaware of the true purpose of Gottlieb's
visit (Bissell, 9/10, pp. 20-22).

Bissell did not. recall cables concerning the dispatch of a
messenger and subsequently confirming that his instructions were
to be followed, but he said "This sounds highly likely. . ..I
would expect, given the background, that the confirmation would
have been forthcoming" (Bissell, 9/10, p. 43).

"according to Bisséll, that he discussed

It was ."'very probable,
the assassination of Lumumba with Sidney Gottlieb, who was then :
his Science Advisor (Bissell, 9/10, p. 14). Bissell said that on a
number of occasions he discussed with Gottlieb "the availability
of means of incapacitation, including assassination" (Bissell, 9/10,
p. 60).

Although he had no "specific recollection," Bissell assumed
that, if Gottlieb went to the Congo, he had approved the mission,
(which "might very well" have dealt with the assassination of
Lumumba) (Bissell, 9/10, pp. 18, 20, 44). Despite his absence of
specific recollection of these events, Bissell said, "'There is
nothing in mind that I remember that would be in conflict" with the
testimony of the Chief of Station that Gottlieb carried poisons to
the Congo (Bissell, 9/10, p. 35).

Bissell testified that it would not have been against CIA policy

in the fall of 1960 to send poisons to the Congo (Bissell, 9/10, p. 35).

Docld:32423524 Page 300


aol

He classified “the act of taking the kit to the Congo. ... as still
in the planning stage" (Bissell, 9/10, p..49). Bissell acknowledged,
however, that the dispatch of poisons and paraphernalia with which
to administer them was an extraordinary event: bit
It would indeed have been rather unusual to send
such materials -- a specific kit. . . of this : =
sort -- out to a relatively small ‘station, unless
planning for their use were quite far along.
(Bissell, 9/10, p. 37).
Nonetheless, Bissell said that he "probably believed" that. he i
had sufficient authority at that point to direct CIA officers to
move from the stage of planning to-implementation (Bissell, 9/10,
pp. 60-61).. In light of his absence of a specific recollection of ~
these events, he stated that "if it be taken as established that Me.
Gottlieb took specific instructions ‘to implement,' ' Gottlieh
would not have been acting beyond the mandate given to him:by
Bissell and it would show that the assassination plot “had then passed

into an implementation phase" and that "authorization was given"

(Bissell, 9/10/ pp. 39, 41, 49).

5. The Question of a Connection Between the Assassination
Plot and Other Actions of CIA Officers and Operatives
in _the Congo

Justin O'Donnell, a’senior CIA officer in the clandestine
operations division in 1960, testified that during this period he
had been asked by DDP Richard Bissell to go to the Congo to carry
out the assassination of Lumumba (O'Donnell, 6/9/75, pp. 11-12). -
O'Donnell said that he refused to participate in an assassination
operation, but proceeded to the Congo to attempt to draw Lumumba
away from the protective custody of the UN guard and place him in
the hands of Congolese authorities (O'Donnell, 6/9/75, pp. 13-14). -
Shortly after O'Donnell's arrival in the Congo he was
joined by a CIA agent with a criminal background who was used the _.
following year by the CIA as part of a program to develop a stand-by
assassination capability. Late in 1960, one of the operatives of
the Chief of Station in Leopoldville approached this agent of
O'Donnell's with a proposition to join an “execution squad" (CIA
Cable IN 18739, Leopoldville to Director, 12/7/60).
Despite the fact that O'Donnell was initially approached
to be part of the plot to assassinate Patrice Lumumba, it is un-
likely that. O'Donnell was actually involved in the implementation
of that plot by the Chief of Station. -Whether there is any connec-
tion between the assassination plot and either of the two operatives --

QJWIN and WIROGUE -- is less clear.

(a) Q'Donnell's Operations in the Congo

7 (i). Tweedy and the Chief of Station Agreed That a
: Senior Case Officer Should be Sent to the Congo
to Concentrate on the Assassination Operation

In early October, 1960, several cables sent.in the
specially restricted PROP channel dealt with a plan to send a "senior
case officer" to the Congo to aid the Chief. of Station with the
assassination operation.* On October 7, Bronson Tweedy informed
Hedgman that he “WOULD EXPECT DISPATCH TDY [ TEMPORARY DUTY] SENIOR _
CASE OFFICER.RUN THIS OP" by supervising a third country national
operative (CIA Cable OUT 78336, ‘weedy to Chief of Station, 10/7/60).
On October 15, Tweedy requested Hedgman's reaction to the sugges-
tion of dispatching the senior case officer as soon as possible to He
concentrate on the assassination operation (CIA Cable OUT 81396,
Tweedy to Chief of Station, 10/15/60). Two days later, the Chief
of Station replied affirmatively:

BELIEVE EARLY ASSIGNMENT SENIOR CASE OFFICER

HANDLE PROP OPS EXCELLENT IDFA. (CIA Cable~

IN 28936, Chief of Station to Tweedy).
The Chief of Station advised that his responsibilities for "MULTIPLE
OPS" had restricted the amount of time he was able to devote to the

assassination operation (CIA Cable, 10/17/60).

* See Section 4(e), supra, for full treatment of these cables.

(ii) Bissell Discussed Assassination of Lumumba With
O*DonnelT and Sent Him to Congo: October-November 1960

: Probably shortly after the Chief of Station's cable of
October 17 requesting the assignment of a senior case officer to
concentrate on the assassination operation, Richard Bissell broached
the subject with CIA officer Justin O'Donnell.

At that time, O'Donnell was the Deputy Chief of a com-
ponent of the Directorate of Plans -- the CIA's covert action arm
O'Donnell, 6/9/75, p. 8). ~~ -

Justin O'Donnell testified that in October of 1960, he
was asked by Richard Bissell to undertake the mission of assassi-
nating Patrice Lumumba (O'Donnell, 6/9/75, pp. 11-12; 9/11/75, .
pp. 19, 43):

O'Donnell: ile called me in and he told me
he wanted to go down to the Belgian Coneo,
the former Belgian Congo, and to eliminate
* Lumumba .

Q: What did you understand him to mean by
eliminate?

Q'Donnell: To kill him and thereby eliminate

his influence.

Q: What was the basis for your internreting his
remarks, whatever his precise language, as
meaning that he was talking about as Ssination
rather than merely neutralizinz him through
some other means?

O'Donnel It was not, neutralization
Clearly the context of our talk was to k

him.- (O'Donnell, 6/9/75, pp. 11-12.)

al

O'Donnell reacted strongly to Bissell's instruction:

I told him that I would absolutely not
have any part. of killing Lumumba. He said,
IT want you to go over and talk to Sidney .
Gottlieb. (O'Donnell, 6/9/75, p. 12.)

HW 50955 DocId:32423524 Page 304


~55~

Gottlieb was a CIA scientist who was at that time the Science
Advisor to Bissell (Bissell, 9/10/75, p. 14).

O'Donnell. said it. was "inconceivable that Bissell would direct
such a mission without the personal permission of Allen Dulles"
(O'Donnell, 9/11/75, p. 44). But the question of authorization:
was never raised by Bissell:

I assumed that he had authority. from Mr. Dulles
in such an important issue, but it was not dis-
cussed, nor did he-purport to have higher

authority to do it. (O'Donnell, 6/9/75, p. 15.)

O'Donnell promptly met with Gottlieb and testified that he rl
“sure that Mr. Bissell had calléd Gottlieb and told him I was coming ~~
over" (O'Donnell, 6/9/75, p. 13; 9/11/75, p. 7). O'Donnell said i
that Gottlieb told him "that there were four or five .., lethal
means of disposing of Lumumba" (O'Donnell, 6/9/75, p. 13). O'Donnell
recalled that "one of the methods was a virus and the others in-
cluded poison" (O'Donnell, 6/9/75, p. 12; 9/11/75, p. 7). O'Donnell
said that Gottlieb "didn't even hint ... that he had been in the
Congo and that he had transported any lethal agent to the Congo"
(O'Donnell, 9/11/75, p. 7-A).

After speaking with Gottlieb, O'Donnell said:

I then left his office, and I went back to

Mr. Bissell's office and I told him in no a
way would I have any part in the assassina-

tion of Lumumba ... and reasserted in

absolute terms that I would not be involved
- ina murder attempt. (O'Donnell, 9/11/75, p. 43.)

HW 50955 DocId:32423524 Page 305


NW 50955

~56-

‘O'Donnell said that in one of his two conversations with
Bissell about Lumumba, he raised the prospect "that conspiracy
to commit murder being done in the District of Columbia might be
in violation of federal law'' (O'Donnell, 6/9/75, p. 14). He said
that Bissell “airily dismissed" this prospect (O'Donnell, 6/9/75,

p: 14). :

Despite his refusal to participate in assassination, O'Donnell
agreed to go to the Congo on a general mission to “neutralize”
Lumumba "as a political factor" (O'Donnell, 9/11/75, pp. 43-44) :

I said I would go down and I would have no
compunction about operating to draw Lumumba
out [of UN custody], to run an operation to >
neutralize his operations which were against -*

Western interests, against, I thought,
American interests. (O'Donnell, 6/9/75, p. 13.)

O'Donnell added that his objective was to

neutralize’ Lumumba's influence ... and his

activities against [a'Congolese leader],

whom at that time you might say was our close.

instrument, he was the man we had put our

chips on. (O'Donnell, 9/11/75, Di20)
Bissell also recalled that, after their discussions about assassi-
nation, O'Donnell went to the Congo "with the assignment ... of
looking at other ways of neutralizing Lumumba" (Bissell, 9/10/75,
p. 53). 2

Although O'Donnell did not formulate a precise plan until he

reached the Congo, he discussed a general strategy with Bissell:

DocId:32423524 Page 306


-S7-

Mr. O'Donnell: I told Mr. Bissell that IL
would be willing to go down to neutralize

” his activities and operations and try to bring
him out [of UN custody] and turn him-over ‘to
the Congolese authorities, that is correct.

Senator Mondale: Was it discussed then that
his Iife might be taken by the Congolese a
authorities? E EE

Mr. O'Donnell: It was, I think, considered
in the --not to have him killed, but then
it would have been a Congolese being judged
by Congolese for Congolese crimes. Yes, I
think it was discussed. (O'Donnell, 6/9/75,
p. 38.) ac ~

There was a "very, very high probability" that Lumumba would re- ~
ceive capital punishment at the hands of the Congolese authorities,
according to O'Donnell (O'Donnell, 9/11/75, p. 24). But O'Donnell — =
“had no compunction about bringing him out: and then having him
tried by a jury of his peers" (O'Donnell, 6/9/75, p. 14).
Although O'Donnell had expressed his aversion to assassination
to Bissell and had undertaken a more general mission to "neutralize"
Lumumba's influence, it was clear to him that Bissell was still
interested in the assassination of Lumumba:
in leaving at the conclusion-of our second
discussion ... he said, well, I wouldn't
rule out that possibility -- meaning the
possibility of the elimination or the killing
of Lumumba -- I wouldn't rule it. In other
words, even though you have said this, don't
rule it out.... There is no question about
it, he said, I wouldn't rule this other out,
meaning the elimination or the assassination
(O'Donnell, 9/11/75, p. 45).

O'Donnell had a distinctive recollection that after his second dis-

cussion of Lumumba with Bissell, he met with Richard Helms in order

HW 50955 DocId:32423524 Page 307


-58-.

to make his opposition to assassinating Lumumba a'matter of

recerd (O'Donnell, 9/11/75, pp. 44-45):

{I]n the Agency, since you don't have
documents, you have to be awfully canny +
and you. have to get things on record, and
I went into Mr. Helms' office, and I

said, Dick, here is what Mr. Bissell
proposed. to me, and I told him that I
would under no conditions do it, and ilelms
said you're absolutely right. (O'Donnell,
6/9/75, pp. 15-16).

Richard Helms testified that it was "Likely" that he had such a

conversation with O'Donnell and he assumed that O'Donnell 's version

of their conversation was. correct (Helms, 9/16/75, pp. 22-23).*
William Harvey testified that O'Donnell had. informed him

about the conversations with Bissell:

Mr. O'Donnell came to me. and said that he
had been approached by Richard Bissell ...
to undertake an operation in the Congo, one
of the objectives of which was the elimina-
tion of Patrice Lumumba. He also told me
that he had declined to undertake this
assignment. (Harvey, 6/25/75, p. 9.)

Harvey said that in a later conversation with Bissell, Bissell told

him that he had asked O'Donnell to undertake such an operation

(Harvey, 6/25/75, p. 9). ,
O'Donnell said that within forty-eight hours of his second dis-

cussion with Bissell, he departed for the Congo (O'Donnell, 9/11/75,
pp. 45-46).

* Welms testified that he did not follow-up on this conversa-
tion in any way. He did not recall why O'Donnell had gone to the
Congo or what his mission was (llelms, 9/16/75, pp.°32-33).

(iii) Bissell Testified That he Asked 9'Donnell to Plan
and Prepare for an Assassination Operation

" Bissell remembered "very clearly" that he and O'Donnell
discussed the assassination of Lumumba in the fall of 1960 ‘(Bissell,
6/9/75, p. 75) and that O'Donnell reacted negatively (Bissell,
9/11/75, p. 18). According to Bissell, O'Donnell said that he
thought that assassination “was an inappropriate action and that
the desired object could be accomplished better in other ways"
(Bissell, 6/11/75, p. 54).~-- ~

Bissell also confirmed the fact that he had asked
O'Donnell to see Sidney Gottlieb (Bissell; 9/10/75, p. 44).

Bissell differs with O'Donnell's account on only one
important point -- the degree to which Bissell's initial assign-
ment to O'Donnell contemplated the mounting of an operation as
opposed to contingency planning. O'Donnell flatly testified that
Bissell requested him to attempt to kill-Lumumba. In his first
testimony on the subject, Bissell said that he asked O'Donnell
“to investigate the possibility of killing Lumumba" (Bissell,
6/11/75, p. 54; see also pp. 55, 75). In a later appearance,
however, Bissell stated that O'Donnell "had been asked to plan
and prepare for" the assassination of Lumumba (Bissell, 9/10/75
p. 24).

Bissell said that after his conversations with O'Donnell, he

felt that it would be necessary to "postpone" the assassination

operation because, "given O'Donnell's reaction, there was a risk

DoclIda:32423524 Page 309


HW 50955

-60-

that the planning of such an operation would be blown" (Bissell,
9/10/75, p. 25).- Despite his impression that he might have de-
activated assassination operations against. Lumumba at that time,

Bissell could not preclude the possibility that the Hedgman/

Gobblieb poison plot. continued to move foward:

{T]his had been in my mind a very sensitive : ;
assignment to him, limited -- with the .

knowledge of it limited very narrowly even

within the Agency. And it is difficult to

separate recollection from inference on

occasion. But I seem to recollect that

after this. conversation with him, I wanted

this put very much on the back burner and

inactivated for quite some time. Now that

doesn't rule out the possibility that some

action through completely different channels

might have gone forward. But the best of

my recollection is I viewed this not only fe
as terminating the assignment for him, but

also as-reason for at least postponing any~-

thing further along that line. (Bissell,

9/10/75, pp. 25-26).

In Tweedy's mind; O'Donnell's eventual mission to the Congo was
linked to assessing the possibility for assassinating Lumumba

rather than to a general plan to draw Lumumba out of UN custody

(Tweedy, 9/9/75, p. 26).

(iv) O'Donnell Arrived in the Congo and Learned That
a Virus Was in the Station Sate

On October 29, the Chief of Station was informed through
the PROP. channel that Justin O'Donnell was soon to arrive in-Leo-
poldville "IN FURTHERANCE THIS PROJECT" (CIA Cable OUT 86798, Fields

to Chief of Station, 10/29/60). On November 3, O'Donnell arrived

Docld:32423524 Page 310


HW 50955

~61-

in Leopoldville (CIA Cable IN 38052, Leopoldville to Director,
11/4/60). -Chief-of Station Hedgman testified that he had been
made aware by cable that O'Donnell was coming to the Congo
(Hedgman, 8/21/75, p. 40). Wedgman said it was “very possible"
that as a new Chief of Station he took the dispatch to the Congo
of a senior officer like O'Donnell as a signal that CIA headquarters
was "dissatisfied with my handling" of Gottlieb's instructions
(Hedgman, 8/21/75, p. 42).
Medgman had a general picture of 0'Donnell's mission:
I understood it to be that -- similar to
mine, that is, the removal or neutrali-
zation of Lumumba ... I have no clear :
recollection of his discussing the assassi- . Bue
nation. (Hedgman, 8/21/75, p. 54.)
Hedgman said that he had no recollection of O'Donnell indicating
one way or the other whether he was considering assassination as

a means of "neutralizing" Lumumba (Hedgman, 8/21/75, p. 55).

: Hedgman said, "in view of my instructions, I may have assumed that

he was" considering assassination (Hedgman, 8/21/75,-p. 55). Gen-
erally, however, Hedgman perceived O'Donnell as being unenthusiastic
about his mission (Hedgman, 8/21/75, pp. 56, 88-59).

When O'Donnell arrived in the Congo, he met with the Chief of
Station, who informed him that there was "a virus in the safe"
(O'Donnell, 9/11/75, p. 7-A; 6/9/75, p. 16). O'Donnell said he
assumed it was a "lethal agent" (O'Donnell, 6/9/75, p. 37), although

Hedgman was not explicit:

I knew it wasn't for somebody to get his polio
shot up to date. (O'Donnell, 6/9/75, p. 16.)

DocId:32423524 Page 311


-62-

He added that if the virus was to be used for medical purposes,
“it.would have been in the custody of the State Department"
personnel, not the CIA station. (O'Donnell,. 6/9/75, p. 364).
O'Donnell said that he did not recall that -lledgman mentioned
the source of the virus (O'Donnell, 9/11/75, p. 8).* “But O'Donnell
assumed that it had come from Sidney Gottlieb's office:
It would have had to have come from Washington,
in my estimation, and I would think, since it
had been discussed -with Gottlieb that it
probably would have emanated from his office. .
(O'Donnell, 6/9/75, p. 28.) :
Hedgman did not recall discussing Gottlieb's trip to the Congo
with O'Donnell, but "assumed" that he did so (Hedgman,.3/21/75
pp. 60-61).
O'Donnell was "certain" that: the virus had arrived before he
did (O'Donnell, 6/9/75, p. 24). He was surprised to learn that
such.a virus was being held at the Leopoldville station because
he had refused an assassination mission before departing for the
Congo (O'Donnell, 6/9/75, p. 17).
O'Donnell stated that he knew of no other instance where a
lethal biological substance was in the possession of a CIA station
(O'Donnell, 9/11/75, p. 50). He assumed that its purpose was

assassination:

oa * When O'Donnell was. informed about Hedgman's testimony on
the visit of Gottlieb to the Congo and the plot to poison Lumumba,
he said, "I believe absolutely in its credibility" (O'Donnell,
9/11/75, p. 53). O'Donnell found nothing in the facts as he knew
them, nor in Hedgman's character to raise a question about that
testimony. O'Donnell regarded Hedgman as. "an honest and a decent
man" (O'Donnell, 9/11/75, p. 19) -- "a totally truthful man"

(O'Donnell, 9/11/75, p. 56).

HW 50955 Docld:32423524 Page 312


~63-

My feeling definitely is that it was for a
specific purpose, and was just not an all-
purpose capability there begin held for tar-
gets of opportunity, unspecified targets.
(O'Donnell, 9/11/75, p. 49.)
At several points, O'Donnell stated that he did not think that
Lumumba was the target specified for the use of the virus (O'Donnell,
6/9/75, p. 17; 9/11/75, p. 48). But he allowed for that possibility: ~
I. supposed it was for a lethal operation, very
possibly Lumumba,.but very possibly in connec-
tion with other people. (O'Donnell, 6/9/75,
p. 24; accord. 6/9/75, p. 17.)
His final word on the subject was that he assumed that the "specific
purpose" of the virus was the assassination of Lumumba (O'Donnell
9/11/75, p. 50). :

O'Donnell said that the Chief of Station never indicated that
O'Donnell was to employ the virus (O'Donnell, 9/11/75, f disseny) arteeeeen
fact, O'Donnell testified that Hedgman "never discussed his assassi-
nation effort, he never even indicated that this was one." (O'Donnell
9/11/75, p. 54.)

While Nedgman has no direct recollection of discussing his
assassination operation with O'Donnell, he "assumed" that he had
at least discussed with O'Donnell the problem of gaining access to
Lumumba for the purpose of assassinating him (Hedgman, 8/21/75,
pp. 55, 60). O'Donnell testified, however, that because he. was

“morally opposed to-assassination" he would “absolutely not" have

HW 50955 DocId:32423524 Page 313


-64-

explored the means by which such access could be zained, nor would
he have undertaken a mission to the Congo if it involved assess-
ment of the’ situation for an assassination. operation by someone
else (O'Donnell, 9/11/75, p. 26).

O'Donnell was "sure'' that he "related everything™ to Hedgman
about his conversations with Bissell concerning the assassination

of Lumumba (O'Donnell, 9/11/75, p. 46). Hedgman, however, had no

recollection of learning this .from O'Donnell (iedveman, 8/21/75,

p. 56).
Beyond this, O'Donnell said that his discussions of assassi-
nation with Hedgman were general and philosophical, dealing with

"the morality of assassinations” (O'Donnell, 9/11/75, vp. 46, 54):

From my point of view I told him I had
moral objections to it, not just qualms,
but objections. I didn't think it was
the right thing to do. (9'Donnell,
9/11/75, p. 9).

When asked to characterize Hedgman's attitude toward assassination

based on those discussions, 9'Donnell said:

I will answer your question just as fairly
and as scrupulously as I can, I have a
great deal of respect for Hedgman. And if
he said something, I would believe hin to
be speaking the truth as he knew it without
shading it.... The best I could say, I
think, would be this, that he would not have
been opposed in principle to assassination in
the interests of national security.... I
know that he is a man of «reat moral per-
ception and decency and honor, and so forth.
a And that it would disturb him to be enraged in
something like that. But I think I would
have to say that in our conversations, my
memory of those, at no time would he rule it
out as being a possibility. (O'Donnell,
9/11/75, p. 18.)

(v) O'Donnell Planned to "Neutralize" Lumumba by Turning
lim" Over to Congolese Authorities and Requested the
Assignment of Agent OJWIN to Leovoldvilte as

~ Alter Ego oie

After Justin O'Donnell arrived in the Congo, he formu-
lated a plan for "neutralizing" Lumumba by drawing him away from

the custody of the UN force which was guarding his residence:

O'Donnell: [W]hat I wanted to do was to
get him out, to trick him out, if I could,
and then turn him over ... to the lezal
authorities and let him stand trial. Be-
cause he had atro¢ity attributed to ‘him for
which he could very well stand trial.

Q: . And for which he could very well have
received capital punishment? -

O'Donnell: Yes. And T am not opposed to
capital punishment. (O'Donnell, 9/11/75,
pp. 20-21.)*

To implement his plan, O'Donnell made arrangements to rent "an ob-

servation post over the palace in which Lumumba was safely ensconced”

* According to an earlier report from the Chief of Station, it
was the view of the Special Representative of the Secretary General
of the United Nations that arrest by Congolese authorities was "JUST
A TRICK TO ASSASSINATE LUMUMBA" (CIA Cable Leop Chief
of Station to Director, 10/11/60). The Chief of Station proceeded
to recommend Lumumba's arrest in the same cable:

STATION HAS CONSISTENTLY URGED [CONGOLESE] LEADERS
ARREST LUMUMBA IN BELIEF LUMUMBA WILL CONTINUE BE
THREAT TO STABILITY CONGO UNTIL REMOVED FROM
SCENE (CIA Cable, 10/11/60).

(O'Donnell, 6/9/75; p. 20).* O'Donnell also "spotted" a member
of the UN guard and made his acquaintance to recruit him for an
attempt to lure Lumumba outside UN protective custody (O'Donnell,

6/9/75, p. 20; 9/11/75, p. 21).

O'Donnell said that he cabled progress reports on his plan to
CIA headquarters (O'Donnell, 9/11/75, p. 26). Me also said that
he informed the Chief of Station about his plan (O'Donnell, 9/11/75,
p. 56).

In connection with his effort to draw Lumumba out of UN cus-
tody, O'Donnell arranged for a CIA agent. whose code name was
QJWIN, to come to the Congo to work with him (O'Donnell, 9/11/75,
p. 19):

What I wanted to use him for was
counter~espionage[.]... I had to screen
the U.S. participation in this ... by
using a foreign national whom we knew,
trusted, and had worked with ... the
idea was for me to use him as an alter
ego. (O'Donnell Tr., pp. 19-20.)

In mid-November, two cables from Leopoldville. urged CIA head-
quarters to send QJWIN as soon as possible (CIA Cable IN 41261
Leopoldville to Director, 11/11/60) with this message:

LOCAL OPERATIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES REQUIRE

IMMEDIATE EXPEDITION OF QJWIN TRAVEL TO

LEOPOLDVILLE. (CIA Cable IN 41556,
Leopoldville to Director, 11/13/60.)

* A cable from the Chief of Station to Tweedy in mid-November
reported that the double guard of United Nations and Congolese
troops around Lumumba's residence thwarted this plan: "CONCENTRIC
RINGS OF DEFENSE MAKE ESTABLISHMENT OF OBSERVATION POST IMPOSSIBLE"
(CIA Cable IN 42478, Chief of Station:-to Tweedy, 11/14/60).

HW 50955 Docld:32423524 Page 316

The cables contained no exploration of this sense of. urgency about

the_"operational-circumstances."

(b) Agent QJWIN's Mission in the Congo: November-Decembér

QJWIN was a foreign citizen with a criminal background,
recruited in Europe (Memorandum to CIA Finance Division, Re:
Payments to QsWIN, 1/31/61), and supervised by CIA officer Arnold
Silver. In November 1960, at-O'Donnell's request (O'Donnell, 6/9/75,
p. 19), agent QJWIN was dispatched to. the Congo by, Silver, to under-
take a mission that "might involve a large element of personal risk."
(CIA Cable IN 36814, 11/2/60.)* :

A dispatch from the CIA headquarters on his pending trip

to Africa made clear thé high degree of sensitivity accorded to

his mission:

In view of the extreme sensitivity of the ob-
jective for which we want him to perform his
task, he was not told precisely what we want
him to do.... Instead, he was told ... that
we would like to have him spot, assess, and
recommend some dependable, quick-witted
persons for our use.... It was thought best
to withhold our true, specific requirements
pending the final decision to use [him].

(CIA Dispatch, AUDW-147, 11/2/60.)

* Part of the purpose in dispatching QJWIN to Africa was to
send him from the Congo to another African country for an unspeci-
fied mission. QJWIN's mission to this country is not explained
in the cable traffic between CIA headquarters and the various sta-
tions that dealt with him.

aaa There is no indication in CIA files as to whether QJWIN com-
pjeted this mission. O'Donnell said he had no knowledge of any
mission that would have taken QJWIN to this country (O'Donnell,
9/11/75, pp. 32-33).

HW 50955 DocId:32423524 Page 317


-68-

This message itself was deemed too sensitive to be retained -
at the station: ."this dispatch should be reduced to cryptic
necessary notes and destroyed after the first reading." (CIA
Dispatch, AUDW-147, 11/2/60.)

QJWIN arrived in Leopoldville on November 21, 1960 (CIA Cable
IN 49486, 11/29/60) and returned to Europe in late December 1960
(CIA Cable OUT.54710, Director to. Leopoldville, 12/9/60).

The CIA Inspector General's Report said that QJWIN

had been recruited earlier by Arnold.Silver

for use in a special operation in the Congo

{the assassination of Patrice Lumumba] tobe

run by Justin O'Donnell. (1.G.. Report, p. 38.)
However, both O'Donnell and Bissell testified that O'Donnell re-
fused to be associated with an assassination operation.*: Instead,
O'Donnell said he went to the Congo to attempt to snatch Lumumba
from the protective custody of the U.N. guard and place him in
the hands of the Congolese army. (O'Donnell, 6/9/75, pp. 13-14,
37.)

According to O'Donnell, QJWIN was a man who was capable of

“undertaking an assassination mission:

O'Donnell: ... I would say that he would not

be a man of many scruples.

Q: So he was a man capable of doing anything?

Q'Donnell: I would think so, yes.

Q: “And that would include assassination?

O'Donnell: I would think so.
(O'Donnell, 9/11/75, pp. 35-36.)

* See, Sections 5(a) (ii) and 5(a)(iii) above.

HW 50955 DocId:32423524 Page 318


~69-

But O'Donnell had no knowledge that QJWIN was ever used for an
assassination mission (O'Donnell, 9/11/75, pp. 36, 42).

“O'Donnell said that, as far as he knew, he was the only CIA
officer with supervisory responsibility for QJWIN and QJWIN did
not report independently to anyone else (O'Donnell, 9711/75, p. 28). -
When asked if it was possible that QJWIN had a mission independent
of that he was. performing for O'Donnell, he:said:

O'Donnell: Yes, that is possible --.or
it could have been that somebody contacted
him after he got down there, that they.
wanted him to do something along the lines

of assassination. I-don't know. (O'Donnell,
9/11/75, p. 29.) :

But he discounted this possibility as "highly unlikely" because it
would be a departure from standard CIA practice -- placing an agent
in.a position of knowledge superior to that of his supervising
officer (O'Donnell, 9/11/75, p. 29).

Despite O'Donnell's doubt that QawIn had an independent line
of responsibility to the Chief of Station, a cable of November 29
shows that Hedgman was aware of WIN's activities.

In that cable, the Chief of Station reported through the PROP
channel to Tweedy that QJWIN had begun ‘implementation of a plan to
“PIERCE BOTH CONGOLESE AND UN GUARDS" to enter Lumumba's residence
and "PROVIDE ESCORT OUT OF RESIDENCE" (CIA Cable IN 49486,- Chief
of Station to Tweedy, 11/29/60). O'Donnell said that he had directed

- QJWIN to make ‘the acquaintanceship of the member of the UN force

whose help he sought for the plan to snatch Lumumba from UN custody

HW 50955 Docld:32423524 Page 319


-70-

(O'Donnell, 9/11/75, p. 21). But Lumumba had left UN custody at i
this point to travel toward his stronghold at Stanleyville. ‘his
did not deter QJWIN:

VIEW CHANGE IN LOCATION TARGET., QJWIN

ANXIOUS GO STANLEYVILLE AND EXPRESSED

DESIRE EXECUTE PLAN BY HIMSELF WITHOUT

USING ANY APPARAT (CIA Cable, 11/29/60).
It is unclear whether this latter "plan" contemplated assassina-
tion as well as abduction. _An affirmative reply from headquarters ~
came through the PROP channel the next day which was also suscep-
tible of interpretation as an assassination order: :

CONCUR QJWIN GO STANLEYVILLE.... WE ARE

PREPARED, CONSIDER DIRECT ACTION BY QJWIi

BUT WOULD LIKE YOUR READING ON SECURITY

FACTORS. HOW CLOSE WOULD THIS PLACE [UNITED

STATES} TO THE ACTION? (CIA Cable OUT.98314,

Chief of Africa Division to Chief of Station,

11/30/60.)

O'Donnell said that agent QJWIN's stay in the Congo was "co-
extensive with my own, allowing for the fact that he came after I
did." (O'Donnell, 6/9/75, p. 19.) O'Donnell said he left the
Congo around the time of Lumumba's death in Katanga at the hands
of Congolese authorities. (O'Donnell, p. 20.) .QJWIN left in
December shortly after Lumumba was captured by the Congolese army.

In a memorandum to arrange the accounting for QJWIN's activities
in the Congo, William K. Harvey -- under whom O'Donnell had worked

Ca before being detached for assignment to the Congo -- noted the

success of QJWIN's mission: "QJWIN was sent on this trip for a

HW 50955 Docld:32423524 Page 320


7a

specific, highly sensitive operational purpose which has been
completed" (Memorandum for Finance Division from William’K. Harvey,
1/11/61). O'Donnell explained Harvey's reference to the fact that
QJWIN's mission had been "completéd" by saying that once Lumumba

was in the hands of the Congolese authorities "the reason for

the mounting of the project ... had become moot" (O'Donnell,

9/11/75, p. 35). When asked if he and QJWIN were responsible for
Lumumba's departure from UN custody and subsequent capture, O'Donnell
said: “Absolutely not" (O'Donnell, 9/31/75, Mi 35). Harvey did not
recall the meaning of the memorandum; but-he assumed that O'Donnell!s
return from the Congo constituted the “completion” of QJWIN's
mission (Harvey, affidavit, p: ).

Despite the indication in the Inspector General's Report that
QJWIN may have been recruited initially for an assassination mission
and the suggestive language of the cables at the end of November,
there is no. clear evidence that QJWIN was actually involved in any
assassination plan or attempt. The CIA officers who wete involved
in or knowledgeable of an assassination plot against Lumumba’ gave
no: testimony that tended to show that QUWIN was related to that plot.

The Chief of Station had a “vague recollection" that QJWIN
was in the Congo working. for Justin O'Donnell. (Hedgman, 8/21/75,

p. 95.) But Hedgman did’not recall why QJWIN was in the Congo.
(Hedgman, 8/21/75, p. 95.) QJWIN was not a major operative of
Hedgman's. (Hedgman, 8/21/75, p. 95.) Richard Bissell and Bronson

Tweedy did not recall anything about QJWIN's mission in the Congo

HW 50955 DocId:32423524 Page 321


Bo 0

(Bissell, 9/10/75, pp. 54-57; Tweedy, 9/9/75, pp. 54, 61).
. William Harvey, from whose division QJWIN was on loan for
his- Congo assignment, had no specific knowledge of WIN's activities

in the Congo:

I was kept informed of the arrangements for
QJWIN's trip to the Congo and, subsequently,
of his presence in the Congo. I do not know
specifically what QJWIN did in the Congo.. IL
do not think that I ever had such knowledge....
If QJWIN were to be used on an assassination
mission, it would.have been cleared with me.
I was never informed that he was to be used
for such a mission. (Harvey affidavit, p. )

He stated that Arnold Silver probably wrote the memoranda con-

cerning QUWIit and submitted them for HARVEY's signature (ilarvey
affidavit, p. Da

(c) QJWIN's Connection to Project ZRRIFLE

After leaving the Congo in early. 1961, QJWIN was used by
CIA officer William Harvey as the principal asset in Project ZRRIFLE,
a project which included research into a capability to assassinate
foreign leaders.* QJWIN's role in Project ZRRIFLE was to "SPOT"
figures of the European underworld who could be utilized as agents
by the CIA if required. Harvey stated that before the formation
of Project ZRRIFLE:

ial * For a full treatment of Project ZRRIFLE, see Section
infra, on the "Executive Action Capability."

HW 50955 DocId:32423524 Page 322


-~73-

Arnold Silver had not previously used
QJWIN as an. assassination capability or
« even viewed him as such. (Harvey affi-
davit, p. )
Although Harvey also had discussions with Sidney Gottlieb in connec-
tion with Project ZRRIFLE, he believed that, Gottlieb never mentioned
to him either QJWIN's activities in the Congo or Cottlieb's own

trip to Leopoldville. (Harvey affidavit, p. ). Harvey had con-

sulted with Arnold Silver about the initiation of Project ZRRIFLE

(Harvey, 6/25/75, Di92)
The Chief of Station in Leopoldville testified that he had

never heard of Project ZRRIFLE, nor was he aware of any CIA project

to develop the capability of assassinating foreign leaders. a

(Hedgman, 8/21/75, p. 93.) Furthermore, Hedgman said that he was
“quite certain" that.he never discussed assassination capabilities
or assets with Harvey at any time. (Hedgman, 8/21/75, p. 95.)
Hedgman ‘testified that Arnold Silver came to the Congo’ on a counter-
intelligence mission during his tenure, but they did not discuss
the plan to assassinate Lumumba. (Hedgman, 8/21/75, p. 92.)

An interesting note on the value accorded QUWIN by the CIA.
and the inherent predicament for an intelligence agency that employs
hoodlums is found in a cable from CIA headquarters to Arnold Silver
in 1962. The CIA had learned that QUWIN was about to go on trial
in Europe on smuggling charges. ‘The cable suggested:

oa IF .... INFOR TRUE WE MAY WISIl ATTEMPT QUASH

CHARGES OR ARRANGE SOMEHOW SALVAGE QJWIN FOR
QUR PURPOSES. (CIA Cable OUT 73943, 4/18/62.)

(d) Agent QJWIN Was Asked By.Hedgman's Operative WIROGUE
to Join an "Execution Squad”: December

The one incident where there is an explicit reference to
assassination in connection with QJWIN involved his contact with
WIROGUE, another. asset of the Congo station. i i

Wo,

WIROGUE was an “essentially stateless" European who was
"a forger and former bank robber" and had fought with the French
Foreign Legion. (Inspector General Memorandum, 3/14/75.) He was
sent to the Congo after being given plastic surgery and a toupee
by the CIA so that he would not be recognized by Europeans traveling
through the Congo: (1.G. Memorandum, 3/14/75.) WLIROGUE was ;
assessed by the CIA as a man who "LEARNS QUICKLY AND CARRIES OUT
ANY ASSIGNMENT WITIOUT REGARD FOR DANGER" (CIA Cable OUT 86554,
Africa: Division to Leopoldville, 10/27/60).

The Chief of Station described WIROGE as "a man with a
rather unsavory reputation, who would try anything once, at least."
(Hedgman, 8/21/75, p. 96.) Hedgman used him as "a general utility
agent" because "I felt we needed surveillance capability, develop-
ing new contacts; various things." (Hedgman, 8/21/75, p. 96.)
Hedgman supervised WIROGUE directly. and did not put WIROGUE in
touch with Justin O'Donnell. (Medgman, 8/21/75, p. 97.)

A-report on agent WIROGUE, prepared for the CIA Inspector
General's office in 1975, described the training and tasking -he

received:

RW 50955 DocId:32423524 Page 324


~75-

On. 19 September 1960 two members of Africa
Division met with him to discuss. ''an opera-

” tional~assignment in Africa Division." In
connection with this assignment, WIROGUE/1
was to be trained in demolitions, small arms;
and medical immunization.... In October 1960
a cable to Leopoldville stated that
Headquarters [had] ... intent to use him as--
utility agent in order to '(a) organize and
conduct.a surveillance team; (b) intercept
packages; (c) blow up bridges; and (4) execute ~
other assignments requiring positive action.
His utilization is not to be restricted to
Leopoldville." (I.G. Memorandu, 3/14/75.)

WIROGUE made his initial contact with Hedgman in Leopoldville on
December 2, 1960 (CIA Cable IN 18739, 12/17/60).- He was given two - :

instructions by Hedgman: (1) to. “build cover during initial period;"

and (2) to "spot persons for [a] surveillance team" of intelligence ~~
assets in the province where Lumumba's support was strongest. (CIA
Cable IN 18739, 12/17/60.)

Soon .after receiving these instructions, agent WIROGUE approached
QJWIN and asked him to join an “execution squad." This incident is
described by Leopoldville Chief of Station Hedgman in a cable to

CIA headquarters (Hedgman, 8/21/75, p. 99):

_ QJWIN WHO RESIDES SAME HOTEL AS WIROGUE REPORTED
“LATTER TOLD HIM HE HAD LIVED ALASKA, JAPAN, SOUTH
AMERICA, GERMANY AND OTHER PARTS EUROPE. QJWIN
SAID WLROGUE SMELLED AS THOUGH HE IN-INTEL BUSINESS.
STATION DENIED ANY INFO ON WIROGUE. 14 DEC QJWIN
REPORTED WIROGUE HAD OFFERED HIM THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS
PER MONTH TO PARTICIPATE IN INTEL’ NET AND BE MEMBER
“EXECUTION SQUAD." WHEN QJWIN SAID HE NOT INTERESTED ,
WIROGUE ADDED THERE WOULD BE BONUSES FOR SPECIAL JOBS.
UNDER QJWIN QUESTIONING, WIROGUE LATER SAID HE WORK-

te INF FOR [AMERICAN] SERVICE.

. IN DISCUSSING LOCAL CONTACTS, WLROGUE MENTIONED
QJWIN BUT DID NOT ADMIT TO HAVING TRIED RECRUIT HIM.
’ THEN [CHIEF OF STATION] TRIED LEARN WHETHER WIROGUE
HAD MADE APPROACH LATTER CLAIMED HAD TAKEN. NO STEPS.
(CHIEF OF STATION] WAS UNABLE CONTRADICT, AS DID NOT
WISH REVEAL QJWIN CONNECTION [CIA]. (CIA Cable,
Leopoldville to Director, 12/17, 60.)
NW 50955 DocId:32423524 Page 325


-76-

The cable also expressed Hedgman's concern about WIROGUE's

actions:

. LEOP CONCERNED BY WIROGUE FREE WHEELING
AND LACK SECURITY. STATION HAS ENOUGH HEAD-
ACHES WITHOUT WORRYING ABOUT AGENT WiO NOT ”_
ABLE HANDLE FINANCES AND WHO NOT WILLING
FOLLOW INSTRUCTIONS. IF HQS DESIRES, WILLING
-KEEP HIM OWN PROBATION, BUT IF CONTINUE HAVE
DIFFICULTIES, BELIEVE WIROGUE RECALL BES’
SOLUTION. (CIA Cable, Leopoldville to. Director,
12/17/60.)

WIROGUE's attempt to recruit QIWIN for' an. execution squad ‘is
explained. by Hedgman as a mistake and by the actions of QJWIN as -
an unauthorized, unexpected contact’ which he did tiot initiate.

The Chief of Station testified that he had not instructed ee
WIROGUE to make this kind of proposition to QJWIN or anyone else.
(Hedgman, 8/21/75, p. 100.) He added:

I would like to stress that I don't know what

WIROGUE was talking about as a[n] "execution

squad,'' and I am sure he was never tasked to

go out and execute anyone. (iledgman, 8/21/75,

p. 100.)
Hedgman suggested that -‘WIROGUE may have concocted’ the idea of an
execution squad: :

His idea of what an intelligence operative

should do, I think, had been gathered by

reading a few novels or something of the
sort. (Hedgman, 8/21/75, p. 100.)

Justin O'Donnell had no knowledge of an attempt by anyone

connected to the CIA to recruit an execution squad and no recollec-

HW 50955 DocId:32423524 Page 326


hrs

tion of WIROGUE (O'Donnell, 9/11/75, pp. 39-42). O'Donnell men-
tioned that. agent QJWIN was considered for use on a "strong arm
squad," but’ said that this was for purposes more general than
assassinations:

surveillance teams where you have to go

into. crime areas ... where you need a

fellow that if he gets in a box can fight

his way out of it. (O'Donnell, 9/11/75,

p. 36).

Richard Bissell recalled nothing of the WIROUGE approach to

QUWIN: (Bissell, 9/11/75, p. 71). Bronson Tweedy did recall that

WIROGUE was ''dispatched-on a general purpose mission" to the Congo

(Tweedy, 9/9/75, p. 63).° But Tweedy testified that WIROGUE would

“absolutely not" have been used on an assassination mission against
Lumumba because "he was basically dispatched, assessed and dealt
with by the balance of the Division" rather than by the two people
in the Africa Division -- Tweedy himself and his deputy, Glenn
Fields -- who would have known that the assassination of Lumumba
was being considered (Tweedy, 9/9/75, pp. 64-65). :

The Chief of Station said that if the WIROGUE incident was
connected to an actual assassination plan, he would have transmitted
a message in a more narrowly restricted channel than that in which
this cable was sent. His cable om WIROGUE's approach to QJWIN was
sent to headquarters with a security designation that allowed much
wider distribution than the PROP cables that he sent and received
concerning the Gottlieb assassination assignment. (Hedgman, 8/21/75

p. 102.) In contrast, he limited distribution of the cable about

HW 50955 Docld:32423524 Page 327


-78-

WIROGUE. only as a CIA officer would "normally do ... when you
speak in a derogatory manner of an asset."  (Hedgman, 8/21/75
p. 101)

The Chief of Station. maintained that WIROGUE's proposition

to QJWIN to join an “execution squad" could be attributed to

WIROGUE's "freewheeling" nature. Hedgman’ said: -
I had difficulty controlling him in that he
was not a professional intelligence officer
as such. lie seemed-to act on his own without
seeking guidance or authority ... I found
he was rather an unguided missile ... the
kind of man that could get you in trouble be-

fore you knew you were in trouble....
(Hedgman, 8/21/75, pp. 96-97).

But Hedgman did not disavow all responsibility for.WIROGUE's actions:

(I]£ you give a man an order and he carries it
out and causes a problem for the Station, why
then as Chief of Station, well, you accept
responsibility. (Hedgman, 8/21/75, p. 97.)

In sum, the Chief of Station testified that despite the fact
that the CIA was interested in the assassination of Lumumba during
this period, agent WIROGUE's attempt to form an "execution squad"
was an unauthorized, maverick action, unconnected to the CIA assassi-
nation plan.

Nonetheless, the fact that WIROGUE was to be trained in "medical
immunization" (1.G. Memorandum, 3/14/75) raises the possibility
that he was connected to the plot to assassinate Lumumba by means

or lethal biological substances. The 1975 report on WIROGUE's case

HW 50955 DocId:32423524 Page 328


-79-

by the Inspector General's office leaves this question open. The
repert concludes-with the statement that "WIROGUE/1 spent most of
his time trying to develop contacts and was not directly involved
in any particular operation." (I.G. Memorandum, 3/14/75.) - But,
when the report was circulated in the Inspector General's office,

the following comment was handwritten by Scott Breckinridge, one

of the principal authors of the 1967 report on CIA involvement in

assassination attempts: "ROGUE's pitch is too clear to be dis-
carded out of hand as ‘exceeding instructions.'" (1.G. Memorandum,
3/14/75)

6. The Question of Whether the CIA Was. Involved in Bringing.
About “Lumumba"s Death in Katanga

There is no direct evidence of CIA involvement in bring-
ing about Lumumba's death in Katanga. The CIA officers most closely
connected to the plot.to poison Lumumba testified uniformly that
they knew of no CIA involvement in Lumumba's death.

(a) Lumumba's Escape from UN Custody, Capture by.

Congolese Army, and Imprisonment at Thysville:
November 27-December 3, [960

The strongest hint that. the CIA inay have been involved
in the capture of Lumumba by Mobutu's troops after his departure
from UN custody on November 27, was contained in a PROP cable from
the Chief of Station to Tweedy on November 14 (CIA Cable IN 42478,
Chief of Station to Tweedy, 11/14/60). In the cable, Hedgmart’ re-
ported that an agent of his had learned: that Lumumba's

POLITICAL FOLLOWERS IN STANLEYVILLE DESIRE THAT
HE BREAK OUT OF HIS CONFINEMENT AND PROCEED TO

THAT CITY BY CAR TO ENGAGE IN POLITICAL ACTIVITY.
(CIA Cable, 11/14/60.)

HW 50955 Docld:32423524 Page 329


HW 50955

-80-

The Chief of Station was confident that he would have foreknowledge
of Lumumba's departure and that action plans were prepared for that
eventuality:
DECISION ON BREAKOUT WILL PROBABLY BE MADE -..
SHORTLY. STATION EXPECTS TO BE ADVISED BY
[AGENT] OF DECISION WHEN MADE.... STATIOU
HAS SEVERAL POSSIBLE ASSETS TO USE Il EVENT -
OF BREAKOUT AND STUDYING SEVERAL PLAINS: OF
ACTION. (CIA Cable, 11/14/60.)

There is no other evidence, however, that-the CIA actually
gained prior knowledge of Lumumba's plan to depart for Stanleyville.
In fact, a cable from Leopoldville on the day after Lumumba's
escape betrays the station's complete ignorance-about the circum- ~
stances of Lumumba's departure (CIA Cable IN 48484, Leopoldville :
to Director, 11/28/60).

But the same cable raises at least a question as to whether
the CIA was involved in the capture of Lumumba enroute by Congolese
troops:

[STATION] WORKING WITH. [COMGOLESE GOVERNMENT ]
TO GET ROADS BLOCKED AND TROOPS ALERTED
[BLOCK] POSSIBLE ESCAPE ROUTE. (CIA Cable,
11/28/60.)

A cable of December 2 reporting Lumumba's capture militates
against CIA involvement, however, because it portrays the Congolese
forces as the source of the station's information (CIA Cable IN 10643,
Leopoldville to Director, 12/3/60).

The Chief of Station testified that he was "quite certain that

there was no Agency involvement in any way' in Lumumba's departure

DocId:32423524 Page 330


-81-

from Uil custody and that he had no foreknowledge of Lumumba's
plan (Hedgman, 8/21/75, pp. 63-64). He stated that. he consulted
with Congolese officers about the possible. routes Lumumba might
take to Stanleyville, but he was "not a major assistance” in track-
ing down Lumumba prior to his capture (Hedgman, 8/21/75, p. 65).
Despite the fact that O'Donnell had planned to draw Lumumba
: out of UN custody and turn him over to Congolese authorities, he
insisted that Lumumba éscaped by his own devices and was not tricked
by the CIA (O'Donnell, 9/11/75, p. 22). i

(b) Transfer of Lumumba to Katanga Where He Was Killed:
January. 17, 1960

The contemporaneous cable traffic shows that. the CIA was
kept informed of Lumumba's condition and movements in January of

a serious political threat. But there is no direct evidence of

CIA involvement in bringing about Lumumba's death in Katanga.

7. The Question of the Level at which the Assassination Plot
- Was Authorized :

The chain of events revealed by the documents and testimony
is strong enough to permit a reasonable inference that the assas-
sination plot was authorized by the President. It is clear that
Allen Dulles authorized the plot.

At the least, the chronological relationship between strong
Presidential or other. White House expressions of hostility. to
Lumumba and CIA steps toward the assassination of Lumumba is close
enough to make it appear that Dulles thought he was acting in re-
sponse to pressure from above in approving assassination as one
means of removing Lumumba from the political scene. nat

Nevertheless, there is enough countervailing testimony by
Eisenhower Administration officials and enough ambiguity in the
records of high-level policy meetings to raise a doubt as to whether
President. Eisenhower intended an assassination effort against Lumumba.

The chain of significant events in the Lumumba case begins with
the testimony that President Eisenhower made a statement at a meet-
ing of the National Security council in the Summer or early Fall of
1960 that came across to one staff member in attendance as an order

; for the assassination of Patrice Lumumba. The next link is a memo-
randum of the Special Group meeting of August 25, 1960, which indi-
cated that when the President's “extremely strong feelings on the

necessity for very straightforward action" were conveyed, the Special

Group
agreed that planning for the Congo would not necessarily
rule out "consideration" of any particular kind of ac-'
tivity which might contribute to getting rid of Lumumba.
(Minutes of Special Group Meeting, 25 August 1960)
The next day CIA Director Allen Dulles, who had attended the Special
Group meeting, personally cabled to the Chief of Station in Leopold-
ville that Lumumba's "REMOVAL MUST BE AN URGENT AND PRIME OBJECTIVE ae
. A HIGH PRIORITY OF OUR COVERT ACTION" (CIA Cable OUT 62966,
Dulles to Leopoldville, 8/26/60). Dulles added; "YOU CAN ACT ON
YOUR OWN AUTHORITY WHERE TIME DOES NOT PERMIT REFERRAL HERE."
Although the Dulles cable does not explicitly mention assassina-
tion, Richard Bissell -- the CIA official under, whose aegis the as- -~
sassination effort against Lumumba took place -- testified that, in
his opinion, this cable was a direct outgrowth of the Special Group
meeting and signaled to him that the President had: authorized assas-
sination as one means of removing Lumumba (Bissell, 9/10/75, pp- 33-
34, 61-62; see Section 7(c), infra). Bronson Tweedy, who bore the
primary administrative responsibility for activities against Lumumba,
testified that the Dulles cable confirmed the policy that no measure,
including assassination, was to be overlooked in the attempt to re-
move Lumumba from a position of influence (Tweedy, 10/9/75, pp. 4-5).
On September 19, 1960, Bissell and Tweedy cabled the Chief of
Station to.expect a messenger from CIA headquarters. Two days later,

in the presence of the President at a meeting of the National Security

-84-

Council, Allen Dulles stated that Lumumba "would remain a grave
danger as long as he was not yet disposed of" (Memorandum, 460th
NSC Meeting, 9/21/60). Five days after this meeting, a CIA scien-
tist arrived in Leopoldville and provided the Chief of Station

‘ with lethal biological substances, instructed Him to assassinate
Lumumba, and informed him: that the President had authorized this
operation.

Two mitigating factors wéaken this chain just enough so that
it will not support an absolute finding of Presidential authoriza-
tion for the assassination effort against Lumumba.

First, the two officials of the Eisenhower Administration re-
sponsible to the President for national. security affairs testified
that they knew of no Presidential approval for, or knowledge of, an
assassination plot.

: Second, the minutes of discussions at meetings of the National
Security Council and its Special Group do not record an explicit
Presidential order for the assassination of Lumumba. The Secretary
of the Special Group maintained that his memoranda reflect the ac-
tual language used at the meetings without omission or euphemism
for extremely sensitive statements (Parrott, 7/10/75, pp. 18-19).
NSC staff executives stated, however, that there was a strong pos-
sibility that a statement as sensitive as an assassination order
would have been omitted from the record or handled by means of euphe-

and planning for covert operations testified that the language in
these minutes clearly indicated that assassination was contemplated
at the NSC as-one means of eliminating Lumumba as a political
threat; other officials testified to the contrary... ‘

(a) High-Level Meetings at which "Getting Rid of Lumumba" ;
Was Discussed

(i) Dillon Testified that the Question of Assassina-
tion Was Raised at Pentagon Meeting: Summer 1960-

In late July 1960, Patrice Lumumba visited the United
States and met with Secretary of State Christian Herter and Under-
secretary of State C. Douglas Dillon. While Lumumba was in Washing-
ton, D.C., Secretary Herter pledged aid to the newly formed Govern- ~ a
ment of the Congo (New York Times, 7/28/60, p- )-

According to Dillon, the impression that Lumumba left

with the Government officials was that of an irrational, almost

psychotic personality:

When he was in the State Department meeting, either with
me or with the Secretary in my presence . . . he would

never look you in the eye. He looked up at the sky. And
a tremendous flow of words came out. He spoke in French,
and he spoke it very fluently. And his words didn't ever
have any relation to the particular things that we. wanted

ae to discuss ... . You had a feeling that he was a per-
son that was gripped by this fervor. that I can only char-
acterize as messianic... - [H]e was just not a rational

being. (Dillon, 9/2/75, p. 24.)
Dillon said that the willingness of the United States Government to

work with Lumumba vanished after these meetings:

HW 50955 DocId:32423524 Page 335


HW 50955

-86-

[T]he impression that was left was »- . . very bad, that
” this was an individual whom it was impossible to deal

with. And the feelings of the Government as a result

of this sharpened very considerably at that time .

We [had] hoped to see him and see what we could do to

come to better understanding with him. (Dillon, 9/2/75,

pp. 23-24.) coe

Dillon testified that shortly after Lumumba's visit to Washing-
ton, in late July or August, he attended a meeting at the Pentagon
where representatives of the State Department, Defense Department,
Joint: Chiefs’ of Staff, and the CIA were present (Dillon, 9/2/75, PD:
17-20, 25-26) :

“According to Dillon, "a question regarding the possibility of
an assassination attempt against Lumumba was briefly raised" at the
meeting (Dillon, 9/2/75, p. 15; see also 17, 25). Dillon did not
recall anything about the language used in raising the question
(Dillon, 9/2/75, p. 30). Dillon assumed that when the. subject a
Lumumba's assassination was raised, "it was turned off by the CIA"
(Dillon, 9/2/75,-p. 30).. Dillon said that "the CIA people, whoever
they were, were negative to any such action" (Dillon, 9/2/75, p..18).
This opposition "wasn't moral," according to Dillon, but rather an
objection on the grounds that it was “not a possible thing" (Dillon,
9/2/75, p. 18). Dillon said the CIA reaction "might have been" made

out of the feeling that the group was too large for such a sensitive

* Dillon was unable to recall the precise date of this meeting (Dil-
lon, 9/2/75, pp. 25-26).

Docld:32423524 Page 336


-87-

discussion (Dillon, 9/2/75, p. 60).

7 Dillon was clear about the fact that "top level" CIA people
were in attendance, although he did not remember who lodged the
negative reaction to the assassination question (Dillon, 9/2/75
pp. 22, 25). He said it "would have to have been either Allen
Dulles, or possibly [General] Cabell . . . most likely Cabell"
(Dillon, 9/2/75, p. 25). He added that it was "very likely" that
Richard Bissell was in attendance (Dillon, 9/2475, p. 21).

Dillon stated that this discussion could not have served as
authorization for an actual assassination effort against Lumumba
(Dillon, 9/2/75, p. 31). But he believed that the expression of ~
concern typified a prevalent. attitude toward Lumumba that might
have justified the CIA's development of a capability to assassinate
him:

I think they could have decided they wanted to develop

the capability . . . just by knowing the concern that

everyone had about Lumumba. . . . They wouldn't have

had to tell anyone about that. That is just developing

their own internal capability, and then they would have

to come and get permission. (Dillon, 9/2/75, p. 30)
Dillon testified that he had never heard any.mention of the plot to
poison Lumumba; nor, by implication, had he heard even a hint that
the CIA asked permission to mount such an operation (Dillon, 9/2/75,

p. 50). But after being informed of the poison plot, Dillon made

the following comment about the Pentagon meeting he attended:

NW 50955 DocId:32423524 Page 337


-88-

I think it is . .. likely that it might have been
a! the beginning of this whole idea on the CIA's part that
they should develop such a capacity. . And maybe they
didn't have it then and went to work to develop it. be-
ginning in August. (Dillon, 9/2/75; p. 61)
Dillon said that it was unlikely that formal notes were taken at the
meeting or preserved because it was a small “ad hoc" group rather
than an official body (Dillon, 9/2/75, p. 18). Such interdepartmen-
tal meetings were “not unusual," according to Dillon (Dillon, 9/2/
75, p. 20). me a
The only officials Dillon named as probable participants other
than the CIA representatives were Deputy Secretary of Defense James
Douglas and Assistant Secretary of Defense John N. Irwin II (Dillon,
9/2/75, pp. 19, 21). Douglas stated that it was possible. that he “
attended such a meeting at the Pentagon, but he does not recall it
(Douglas affidavit, 9/5/75). Nor does he recall the question of
Lumumba's assassination ever being raised in his presence (Douglas
affidavit, 9/5/75). .Likewise, Irwin stated that it was "likely"
that he attended the meeting to which Dillon referred; but he did
not remember whether he was present "at any meeting at the Pentagon
where the question of assassinating Patrice Lumumba was raised"
(Irwin affidavit, 9/22/75, p.-3).

(ii) Robert Johnson Testified That He Heard the Presi-
dent Order Lumumba’s Assassination at an NSC

Meeting

Robert H. Johnson, a member of the National Security

“~89-

Council staff from 1951 to January 1962, offered what he termed a
"clue" to the extent of Presidential: involvement in the decision to
assassinate Lumumba (Johnson, 6/18/75, pp. 4-5).* Johnson re-
counted the following occurrence at an NSC meeting,in ‘the Summer
of 1960 which began with a briefing on world developments by the

Director of Central Intelligence:

* “Robert Johnson introduced his testimony with the following state-

ment:

I would like to preface my remarks by pointing out
that my decision to offer testimony to this committee has
involved forme a profound personal, moral dilemma. In
my role as a member of the NSC Staff for ten and one-half
years, I was privy to a great deal of information that in-
volved relationships of confidentiality with high officials
of the United States government. I have always taken very
seriously the responsibilities implied in such relation-
ships.

These responsibilities extend, in my view, far beyond
questions of security classification or other legal or
foreign policy concerns. . They relate to the very basis of
human society and government -- to the relationships of
trust without which no free society can long survive and
no government can operate.

I have been forced by recent developments, however, to
weigh against these considerable responsibilities my broad-
er responsibilities as a citizen on.an issue that involves
major questions of public morality, as well as questions
of sound policy. Having done so, I have concluded, not
without a great. deal of reluctance, to come to your commit-
tee with information bearing upon your inquiry into govern-
ment decisions relating to the assassination of foréign
leaders. (Johnson, 6/18/75, pp. 4-5)

After his tenure on the staff of the National Security Council
Robert Johnson served from 1962 to 1967 on the Policy Planning Coun-
cil at the Department of State.

HW 50955 DocId:32423524 Page 339


-90-

At some time during that discussion, President Eisen-
a hower said something -- I can-no longer remember his words
-- that came across to me as an order for the assassina-
tion of Lumumba who was then at the center of political
conflict. and controversy in the Congo. There was no dis-
cussion; the meeting simply moved on. I remember my sense
of that moment quite clearly because the President's state-
ment came as a great shock to me. .I cannot, however, re-

,construct the moment more specifically.

Although I was’ convinced at the time -- and remained
convinced when I thought about it later -- that the Presi-
dent's statement was intended as an order for the assas-
sination of Lumumba, I must .confess that in thinking about.
the incident more recently I have had~some doubts. As is
well known, it was quite ‘uncharacteristic of President
Eisenhower to make or announce policy decisions in NSC
meetings. Certainly, it was strange if he departed from
that normal pattern on a subject so sensitive as this.
Moreover, it was not long after this, I believe, that Lu-
mumba was dismissed as premier by Kasavubu in an action
that was a quasi-coup. I have come to wonder whether what ~~
I really heard was only an order for some such political
action. All I can tell you with any certainty at the
present moment is my sense of that moment in the Cabinet
Room of the White House. (Johnson, 6/18/75, pp. 6-7)

Johnson "presumed" that the President made his statement while "look-
ing toward the Director of Central Intelligence" (Johnson, 6/18/75,
p. 11). .He was unable to recall with any greater specificity the
words used by the President (Johnson 9/13/75, p. 10).

When asked about the strength of the possibility that he had
heard only a general directive for the political overthrow of Lumumba,
Johnson testified that it was his clear impression at the time of the
meeting, and has remained so for the fifteen years since, that he had-
heard an assassination. order:

A Would it be fair to say that although you al-
Tow for the possibility that a coup or some more general

HW 50955 DocId:32423524 Page 340


-91-

political action was being discussed, it is your clear
impression that you had heard an order for the assassi-
nation of Lumumba?

Johnson: It was my clear impression at the time.
Q: And it remains your impression now? a

Johnson: It remains my impression now. I have reflect-

ed on this.other kind of possibility, but that is the

sense ... . that persists. (Johnson, 9/13/75, pp. 24-25)
Johnson explained that his allowance for the possibility that he had
heard an order for a-coup did not disturb his recollection of hear-
ing an’ assassination order:

It was a retrospective reflection on what I had heard

and since this coup did occur, it occurred to me that

it was possible that that is what I heard, but that

would not change my sense of the moment when I heard

the President speak, which I felt then, and I continue

to feel, was a statement designed. to direct the dispos-

al, assassination, of Lumumba. (Johnson, 9/13/75, p. 12)

“Johnson, stated that the incident provoked a strong reaction

from him:

I was surprised . . .. that I would ever hear a President

say anything like this in my presence or the presence of

a group of people. I was startled. (Johnson, 6/18/75,

p. 13)

A succinct summary of Johnson's testimony was elicited by Senator

Mathias in the following exchange:

Mathias: . . . What comes across is that you do have a

memory, if not of exact words, but of your own reaction

really to a Presidential order which you considered to

be an order for an assassination.

Johnson: That is correct.

Mathias: And that although precise words have escaped

HW 50955 Docld:32423524 Page 341


~92-

you in the passage of fifteen years, that sense of shock
remains?

" Johnson: Right. Yes, sir. (Johnson, 6/18/75, p.. 8)
After the meeting, Johnson, who was responsible for writing the
memorandum of the discussion, consulted with a senior official on
the NSC staff to determine how to handle the.President's statement
in the memorandum and in the debriefing of ‘the NSC Planning Board
that followed each meeting: __

I suspect -- but no longer have an exact recollection --
that I omitted it from the debriefing. I also do not re-
call how I handled the subject in the memo of the meet-

ing, though I suspect that some kind of reference to the
President's statement was made. (Johnson, 6/18/75, p. 7)

In his second appearance, Johnson reiterated that it was "quite like="
ly that it was handled through some kind of euphemism or may have

been omitted altogether" (Johnson, 9/13/75, p. 21).*

*- In 1960, Johnson was Director of the Planning Board Secretariat --
third in command on the NSC staff. He attended NSC meetings to take
notes on the discussions whenever one of the two senior NSC officials
was absent.

Johnson testified that the person with whom he consulted about the
manner of recording the President's statement in the minutes was one
of the two top NSC staff officials at that time: NSC Executive Secre-
tary James Lay or Deputy Executive Secretary Marion Boggs (Johnson,
9/13/75, pp. 12-13)... Johnson could not recall which of the two offi-
cials he had consulted, but he "inferred" that it must have been the
“top career NSC staff person present" at the meeting where he heard
the President's statement (Johnson, 9/13/75, p- 12). At both of the
NSC meetings where the President and Johnson were present for a dis-
cussion of Lumumba -- August 18 and September 7 =- James Lay was ab-
sent and Marion Boggs served as Acting Executive Secretary.

Marion Bogg's statement about his method of handling the situation
described by Johnson is in accord with Johnson's testimony:

HW 50955 Docld:32423524 Page 342°


-93-

As Johnson stated, his testimony standing alone is."a clue,
- :
rather than precise evidence of Presidential involvement in decision-
making with respect. to assassinations!’ (Johnson, 6/18/75, p. 5). To

determine the significance of'this "clue,"

it must be Placed in the
context of the records of the NSC meetings attended by Johnson,
testimony about those meetings, and the series of events that pre-

ceded the dispatch of poisons to the Congo for Lumumba's assassina-

tion.

In the Summer of 1960, there were four NSC meetings where de-
velopments in the Congo were discussed at which Robert Johnson was
present. The President was not in attendance at two of those occa-

sions -- July 15 and July 21 (NSC Minutes, 7/15/60; NSC Minutes,

I have no independent recollection of being consulted by
Mr. Johnson about how to handle in the memorandum of dis-
cussion any sensitive statement regarding Lumumba. I am
not saying I was not consulted; merely that I do not re-
member such an incident. If I had been consulted, I
would almost certainly have directed Mr. Johnson to omit
the matter from the memorandum of discussion. (Boggs
affidavit, 10/10/75, p. 2)

James Lay, who attended other NSC meetings where. Lumumba was discuss-
ed (e.g., September 21, 1960), also confirmed the fact that NSC min-
utes would not be likely to record a statement as sensitive as a

Presidential order for an assassination, if such an order were given:

If extremely sensitive matters were discussed at an
NSC meeting, it was sometimes the practice that the
official NSC minutes’ would record only the general.
subject discussed without identifying the specially
sensitive subject.as the discussion. In highly
sensitive cases, no reference to the subject would
be made in the NSC minutes. (Lay affidavit, 9/8/75,
p. 2)

HW 50955 Docld:32423524 Page 343


-94-

7/21/60). Nonetheless, the attitude toward Lumumba even at these
early, meetings was vehement:
Mr. Dulles said that in Lumumba we were faced with a
person who was a Castro’or worse . . . Mr. Dulles went
on to describe Mr. Lumumba's background which™he de-
scribed as "harrowing". ... It is safe to go on the
assumption that Lumumba has been bought by the Commun-
ists; this also, however, fits with his own orienta-
tion. (NSC Minutes, 7/21/60)
The President presided over the other two NSC meetings. After look-
ing at the records of those meetings, Johnson Was unable to deter-
mine with certainty which one was the meeting at which he heard the_
President's statement (Johnson, 9/13/75, p. 16).

However, the chronology of meetings,.cables, and events in the
Congo during this period makes it most likely that Johnson's testi-
mony refers to the NSC meeting of August 18, 1960.

The meeting of August 18 took place at the beginning of a series
of events that preceded the dispatch of a CIA scientist to Leopold-
ville with poisons for the assassination of Lumumba.* The Septem-

ber 7 meeting took place in the midst of this.series of events

* The major events in the series, each of which is discussed in de-
tail in other sections of the report,. may be summarized as follows:
The week: following the NSC meeting of August 18, the Special Group
was informed.of the President's “extremely strong feelings about the
necessity for very straightforward action" and the Group agreed to
consider "any particular kind of activity which might contribute to
getting. rid of Lumumba" (Special Group Minutes, 8/25/60). At this
meeting, DCI Allen Dulles commented that "he had taken the comments
referred to seriously and had every intention of proceeding as vig-
orously as the situation permits" (Special Group Minutes, 8/25/60;
see Section 7(a)(iii), infra). The next day, Dulles sent an "Eyes
Only" cable under his personal: signature to the Chief of Station in

HW 50955 DocId:32423524. Page 344

The NSC meeting of August 18, 1960, was held three weeks before
the "quasi-coup" in the Congo -- the dismissal of Lumumba by Kasavubu
It which Johnson remembers as taking place "not long after" he heard
the President's statement. The only other meeting .at which Johnson
could have heard the statement by, the President was held on Septem-
ber 7, two days after this event.

Robert Johnson's memorandum of the meeting of August 18, 1960,

indicates that Acting Secretafy of State C. Douglas Dillon* introduced

* Leopoldville, indicating that it had been concluded in "HIGH QUAR- -
TERS" that. Lumumba's "REMOVAL MUST BE AN URGENT AND PRIME OBJECTIVE
AND THAT... . THIS SHOULD BE A HIGH PRIORITY OF OUR COVERT ACTION"
(CIA Cable OUT 62966, Dulles. to Chief of Station, 8/26/60). The Dul-~
les cable added: cred

WE WISH GIVE YOU WIDER AUTHORITY . .°. INCLUDING EVEN MORE
AGGRESSIVE ACTION IF IT CAN REMAIN COVERT . .-. YOU CAN
ACT ON YOUR OWN AUTHORITY WHERE TIME DOES NOT PERMIT RE-
FERRAL HERE. (CIA Cable, 8/26/60) (See Section 2, supra,
for more complete treatment of this cable.) ¢ :

On September 19, a CIA scientist was dispatched from headquarters
to the Congo on an extraordinarily sensitive assignment (CIA Cable
OUT 71464, Bissell/Tweedy to Chief of Station, 9/19/60; see Section
4(a), supra). On September 21, in the presence of the President at
an NSC meeting, Allen Dulles stated that Lumumba "remained a grave
danger as long as he was not disposed of" (NSC Minutes, 9/21/60; see
Section 7(a)(iv), infra). Finally, on September 26, the CIA scien-
tist arrived in the Congo, provided the Chief of Station with lethal
biological substances, instructed him to assassinate Lumumba, and in-
formed him that the President had ordered the DCI to undertake an as-
sassination effort (see Sections 4(a)-4(c), supra). The Chief of
Station stated that he received confirmation from CIA headquarters
that he was to follow the instructions he had been given (see Section
4(e) (i), supra). ne

changed to Deputy Secretary of State. In this position, he frequently

the discussion of U.S. policy toward the Congo. In the course of

his remarks, Dillon maintained that the presence of United Nations
troops in the Congo was necessary to prevent Soviet intervention at
Lumumba's request: See
If. . . Lumumba carried out his threat to force the UN
out, he might then offer to accept help from anyone.
The elimination of the- UN would be a disaster which,
Secretary Dillon stated, we should do everything we
could to prevent. If the UN were forced out, we might
be faced by a situation where the Soviets intervened by
invitation of the. Congo. (NSC Minutes, 8/18/60)
The discussion then continued to raise ‘the spectre of an alliance be-
tween Lumumba and the Soviet Union:

Secretary Dillon said that -he [Lumumba] was working to oH

serve the purposes of the Soviets and Mr. Dulles pointed —-=
out that Lumumba was in Soviet pay. (NSC Minutes, 8/18/
60)

In this context, the following exchange between President Eisenhower

and Secretary Dillon was recorded:

The President said that the possibility that the UN would
be forced out was simply inconceivable. We should keep
the UN in the Congo even if we had to ask for European
troops to do it. We should do so even if such action was
used by the Soviets as the basis for starting a fight.
Mr. Dillon. indicated that this was State's feeling but
that the Secretary General and Mr. Lodge doubted whether,
if the Congo put up really determined opposition to the
UN, the UN could stay in. In response, the President
stated that Mr, Lodge was wrong to this extent -- we were
talking of one man forcing us out of the Congo; of Lumum-
ba supported by the Soviets. There was no indication, the

kept informed about NSC and Special Group meetings. Dillon

later served as Secretary of the Treasury under President Kennedy.
(Dillon, 9/2/75, pp. 2-4.)

President stated, that the Congolese did not want

UN support and the maintenance of order. Secretary
Dillon reiterated that this was State's feeling

about the matter. The situation that would be

created by a UN withdrawal was altogether too

ghastly to contemplate. (NSC Minutes, 8/18/60)

This is the only statement about Lumumba which the memorandum of
the meeting attributed to the President.

As reported, it clearly does.not contain an order for the
assassination of Lumumba. But the statement does indicate extreme
Presidential ‘concern focused on Lumumba: The-President was so
disturbed by the situation in the Congo that he was willing to
risk a fight with the Soviet Union and he felt that Lumumba was
the "one man" who was responsible for this situation, a man who mau
did not represent the sentiments of the Congolese people in the
President's estimation.

After reviewing NSC documents and being. informed of Robert
Johnson's testimony, Douglas Dillon stated his “opinion that it
is most. likely that the NSC meeting of August 18, 1960 is the
meeting referred to by Mr. Johnson." (Dillon affidavit, 9/15/75.)
However, Dillon testified that he did not "remember such a thing"
as an explicit. Presidential order for the assassination of
Lumumba (Dillon, 9/2/75, p. 32). ‘Dillon explained how he thought
the President may have expressed himself about Lumumba:

Dillon: . . . . It could have been in view of this
feeling of everybody that Lumumba was [a] very |
difficult if not impossible person to deal with, and
was dangerous to the peace and safety of the world,

Docld:32423524 Page 347

that the President expressed himself, we will have
to do whatever is necessary to get rid of him. I
don't know that I would have taken that as a
clearcut order as Mr. Johnson apparently did. And
I think perhaps others present may have interpreted
it other ways. (Dillon, 9/2/75, pp. 32-33.)

Q: Did you ever hear the President make such a .
remark about Lumumba, let's get rid of him,. or let's
take action right away on this?

Dillon: I don't remember that. But certainly this
was the general feeling of Government. at that time,
and it wouldn't have been if the President hadn't
agreed with it. (Dillon, 9/2/75, p: 33.)

Dillon said that he would have thought that such a state-
ment ‘was not a direct order to have an assassination" (Dillon,
9/2/75, p. 33). - But he testified that it was "perfectly
possible" that Allen Dulles would have translated such strong
Presidential language about "getting rid of" Lumumba into
authorization for an assassination effort (Dillon, 9/2/75,
pp. 34-35):

I think that’ Allen Dulles would have been quite
responsive to what he considered implicit autho-
vization, because he felt very strongly that we
should not involve the President directly in
things of this nature. And he was perfectly
willing to take the responsibility personally
that maybe some of his successors wouldn't have
been. And so I think that this is a perfectly
plausible thing, knowing Allen Dulles. (Dillon,
9/2/75, p. 34.)

Marion Boggs, who attended the meeting of August 18, as
Acting Executive Secretary of the NSC, stated after reviewing

the Memorandum of Discussion at that meeting:

HW 50955 DocId:32423524 Page 348


-99-

I_recall the discussion at that meeting, ‘but. have no
independent recollection of any statements or dis-
cussion not summarized in the memorandum. -Specifically,
I have no recollection of any statement, order or
reference by the President (or anyone else present
at the meeting) which could be interpreted as favor-
ing action by the United States to bring. abdit the
assassination of Lumumba.* (Boggs affidavit, 10/10/75,
pp. 1-2.) :
The Memorandum of Discussion at the NSC meeting of Septem-
ber 7, 1960--the only other. meeting at which Johnson could have
heard the President's statement--records only a brief, general
discussion of developments in the Congo (NSC Minutes, 9/7/60).
As part of Allen Dulles' introductory intelligence briefing on
world events, the Memorandum related his remarks on the situation
in the Congo following Kasavubu's dismissal of Lumumba from his
position in the government (NSC Minutes, 9/7/60, p. 4). Neither
the length nor the substance of the record of this. discussion
indicates that Lumumba's role in the Congo received the same

intense kind of consideration as the NSC had given it on August

18.%** There is no record of any statement by the President

* Boggs added:

"Based on my whole experience with the NSC, I would have
considered it highly unusual if a matter of this nature

had been referred to in a Council meeting where a number
of persons with no.'need to know' were present." (Boggs
affidavit, 10/10/75, p. 2.)

wk The NSC minutes of the meeting of September 7, deal with

the discussion of the Congo in two pages (NSC Minutes, 9/7/60,
pp. 4-5). By.comparison, the August 18:meeting required an

during this discussion (NSC Minutes, 9/7/60, pp. 4-5).

Nevertheless, in’ the course of his briefing Dulles
expressed his continuing concern over the amount of personnel
and equipment that was being sent to the Congo. by the -Soviet
Union, primarily to aid Lumumba (NSC Minutes, 9/7/60, p..5).
Dulles concluded this part of his briefing with an observation
that demonstrated that Lumumba's dismissal from the government
had not lessened the extent’ to, which he was regarded at the
NSC as a potent political threat. in any power struggle in the
Congo:

Mr. Dulles stated that Lumumba always seemed to
come out on top in each of these struggles.
(NSC Minutes, 9/7/60, p. 5.)

The day after this NSC meeting, Cordon Gray made a pointed
reminder of the President's concern about the Congo to Allen
Dulles at a meeting of the Special Group:

Mr. Gray said that he hoped that Agency people in
the field are fully aware of the top-level feeling

in Washington that vigorous action would not be
amiss. (Spécial Group Minutes, 9/8/60.)

There are three possible interpretations of the failure
of NSC records, to reveal whether the President ordered the

assassination of Lumumba at one of these meetings. First, an

extraordinarily lengthy (fifteen pages) summary of discussion
on the Congo and related policy problems in Africa, indicating
that this topic was the focal point of the meeting (NSC
Minutes, 8/18/60, pp. 1-15).

DocId:32423524 Page 350


~l01-

assassination order could have been issued but omitted from
the ‘records. Robert Johnson testified that it was "very
likely" that the Presidential statement he heard would have
been handled by means of a euphemistic reference or by_
complete omission "rather than given as [a] . ... direct quo-
tation" in the Memorandum of Discussion (Johnson, 9/13/75,
p. 14). Second, as illustrated by Douglas Dillon's testimony,
the President could have made-a general statement about "getting -
xvid of" Lumumba with the intent to convey to Allen Dulles that
there was implicit authorization for an assassination effort
Third, despite general discussions about removing Lumumba, the
President may not have intended to order the assassination of
Lumumba even though Allen Dulles may have thought an assassina-
tion effort had been authorized. The three White House staff
members responsible to the President’ for national security
affairs testified that there was no such order. Gordon Gray,
Andrew Goodpaster, and John Eisenhower were all in attendance
at the NSC meetings of August.18 and September 7.*

(iii). The President's "Extremely Strong Feelings" Led

The Special Group to Consider Anything That Might
Get Rid of Lumumba: August 25, 1960

On August 25, 1960 five men** attended a meeting of the

See. Section 7(b), infra, for a general treatment of the
testimony of Gray, Goodpaster and Eisenhower.

** There were four standing members of the Special Group at
this time: Allen Dulles, Director of Central Intelligence; Gordon

Special Group, the gubcommittee of the National Security
Couficil responsible for planning covert operations. Thomas
Parrott, a CIA officer who served as Secretary to the Group,
began the meeting by outlining the CIA operations that_had
been undertaken in "mounting an anti-Lumumba- campaign in the
Congo" (Special Group Minutes, 8/25/60). This campaign involved
covert operations through certain labor groups and "the planned
attempt . . . to arrange a.vote of no confidence in Lumumba"
in the Congolese Senate (Special Group Minutes, 8/25/60).

The outline of this campaign evoked the following dialogue: |

The Group agreed that the action contemplated is
very much in order. Mr. Gray commented, however,
that his associates had expressed extremely strong
feelings on the necessity for very straightforward
action in this situation, and he wondered whether the
plans as. outlined were sufficient to accomplish this.
Mr. Dulles replied that’ he had taken’ the comments
referred to seriously and had every intention of pro-
ceeding, as vigorously as the situation permits or
requires, but added that he must necessarily put himself
in a position of interpreting instructions of this kind
within the bounds of necessity and capability. It was
finally agreed that planning for the Congo would not
necessarily rule out ‘consideration' of any particular
kind of activity which might contribute to getting rid
of Lumumba. (Special Group Minutes, 8/25/60, p. 1.)

Both Gordon Gray and Thomas Parrott testified that refer-

“ence to Mr. Gray's "associates" was a euphemism for President

Gray, Special Assistant to the President for National Security
Affairs;.Livingston Merchant, Undersecretary of State for Political
Affairs; and John N. Irwin II, Assistant Secretary of Defense.

Also in regular attendance was Thomas A. Parrott, Secretary to

the Special Group.

Eisenhower which .was employed to preserve "plausible deniabil-
ity” by the President of discussion of covert operations
memorialized in Special Group Minutes (Gray, 7/9/75, p. 27;
Parrott, 7/10/75, pp. 8-9). é aa

The four living participants at the meeting have all stated
that they do not recall any discussion of or planning for the
assassination of Lumumba (Merchant affidavit, .9/8/75, p- 1;
Irwin affidavit, 9/22/75, pp? 1-2;-Gray, 7/9/75, pp. 27, 32;
Parrott, 7/10/75, pp: 25-26). Gray said that he ‘did not con-
sider the President's desire for "very straightforward. action"
to include "any thought in his mind of assassination" (Cray,
7/9/75, p. 32). Parrott testified to the same effect, maintain-
ing that he would have recorded a discussion of assassination
in explicit terms in the Special Group Minutes if such a dis-
cussion had taken place (Parrott, 7/10/75, pp. 26-27).

John N. Irwin II acknowledged, however. that while he did
not have “any direct recollection of the substance of that meet-
ing", the reference in the minutes to the planning for "getting
rid of Lumumba" was "broad enough to cover. a discussion of
assassination" (Irwin affidavit, 9/22/75, p. 2).

Irwin's interpretation is shared by Douglas Dillon and
Richard Bissell--two high government officials who were not-
participants at. this Special Group meeting but who were involved
in the planning and policymaking for covert operations in the

Congo during this period.

DoclId:32423524 Page 353


-105-

As a participant in National Security Council meetings
of this period, Dillon said that he would read the Special
Group minutes of August 25, 1960, to indicate that -assassina-
tion was within the bounds of the kind of activity that might
be used to "get rid of" Lumumba (Dillon, 9/2/75, p. 42).
Dillon noted that the reference in the minutes to the fact
that Allen Dulles stated that he “had taken the comments
referred to seriously" probably pointed to the President's
statement at the previous NSC meeting at which Robert Johnson
took notes (Dillon, 9/2/75, pp. 39-40).

When asked whether the CIA would have the authority to
mount an assassination effort against Lumumba on the basis of
the discussion at the Special Group, Dillon said:

They would certainly have: the authority to plan.
It is a close question whether this would be
enough to actually go ahead with it. But cer-
tainly the way this thing worked, as far as I
know, they didn't do anything just on their own.
I think they would have checked back at least
with the. senior people in the State Department
or the Defense Department. (Dillon, 9/2/75

p. 43:) :

Dillon said that if the CIA checked with the State Depart-
ment, it might have been done in such a way that it would not
appear on any récord (Dillon, 9/2/75, p. 43). Dillon added that
“to protect the President as the public representative of the

U.S. from any bad publicity in connection with this", Allen

Dulles "wouldn't return to the President" to seek further

HW 50955 DocId:32423524 Page 354

approval if an assassination operation were-mounted (Dillon,

9/2/60, pp. 42-43).

‘Richard Bissell stated that in his opinion the language
of the Special Group Minutes of August 25, 1960. indicated
that the assassination of Lumumba was part of a general
strategy at. the NSC and within the CIA for removing Lumumba
from the political scene (Bissell, 9/10/75, pp. 29, SZ)
Bissell added:

The Agency had put~a top priority, probably, on
a range of different methods of getting rid of
Lumumba in the sense of either destroying him
physically,incapacitating him, or eliminating
his ee influence. (Bissell, 9/10/75,

p. 29.

Bissell pointed to the Special Group Minutes of August 25,
1960 as a "prime example" of the circumlocutious.manner in
which a topic like assassination would be discussed by high
government officials:

Bissell: When you use the language that no particu-
Tar means were ruled out, that is obviously what it
meant, and it meant that to everybody in the room.
Meant that if it had to be assassination, that that
was a permissible means.

You don't use language of that kind except to mean
in effect, the Director is being told, get rid of
the guy, and if you have to use extreme means up

to and including assassination, go ahead. (Bissell,
9/10/75, pp. 32-33.)

Bissell added that this message was, "in effect'', being given

to Dulles by the President through his representative Gordon
Gray (Bissell, 9/10/75, p. 33).
(iv) NSC Meeting of September 21, 1960: Dulles Said

Lumumba Would Remain a Grave Danger Until
sposed Of"

In the course of his intelligence briefing to the NSC

HW 50955 DocId:32423524 Page 355


~107-

on September 21, 1960, Allen Dulles stressed the danger of
Soviet influence in the Congo. Despite the fact that Lumumba
had been deposed from his position as Premier and was in UN
custody, Dulles continued to regard him as a threat, éSpecially
in light of reports of an impending reconciliation between
Lumumba and the post-coup Congolese government:

Mobutu appeared to be the effective power in the

Congo for the monent but Lumumba was not yet

disposed of and remained a grave danger as long

as he was not disposed of. (NSC. Minutes,

9/21/60.)

Three days after this NSC meeting, Allen Dulles sent a
personal cable to the Chief of Station in Leopoldville which
included the following message:

WE WISH GIVE EVERY POSSIBLE SUPPORT IN ELIMINATING
LUMUMBA FROM ANY POSSIBILITY RESUMING GOVERNMENTAL
POSITION OR IF HE FAILS IN LEOP[OLDVILLE] , SETTING
HIMSELF IN STANLEYVILLE OR ELSEWHERE. .(CIA Cable,
OUT 73573, Dulles to Leopoldville, 9/24/60.)

On September 26, Sidney Gottlieb, under assignment from
CIA headquarters, arrived in Leopoldville (CIA Cable IN 18989,
Leopoldville to Director, 9/27/60), provided the Chief of
Station with poisons, instructed him to assassinate Lumumba,
and assured him that there was Presidential authorization for
this mission (see Sections 4(b)-4(c), supra).

Marion Boggs, NSC Deputy Executive Secretary, who wroté

the memorandum of the discussion of September 21, did not

interpret Dulles' remark as referring to assassination:

HW 50955 DocId:32423524 Page 356


-108-

I, have .examined the memorandum (which I prepared)
summarizing the discussion of the Congo at the
September 21, 1960 meeting of the NSC. I recall the
discussion and believe it is accurately and adequately
summarized in the memorandum. ‘I have no recollection
of any discussion of a possible assassination of Lumumba
at this meeting. With specific reference to the-state-
ment of the Director of Central Intelligence. . - I
believe this is. almost a literal rendering of what Mr.
Dulles said. My own interpretation of this statement .
was that Mr. Dulles was speaking in the context of
efforts being made within the Congolese government to
force Lumumba from power. I did not interpret it as
referring to assassination’ (Boggs affidavit 10/10/75,
pp. 2-3.) a

Boggs was not, however, in a position to analyze Dulles’

remark in light of the actual planning for covert operations

‘that took place during this period because Boggs was not privy 2
to most such discussions (Boggs affidavit, 10/10/75, p. 2).

C. Douglas Dillon, who attended this NSC meeting as
Acting Secretary of State, said that he. did not recall the dis-
cussion (Dillon, 9/2/75, p. 47). Dillon said that the minutes
“could mean that" assassination would have been. one acceptable
means of "disposing of" Lumumba, although he felt that "getting
him out [of the Congo] or locking him up'' would have been a
preferable disposition of Lumumba at that point since hé was

* NSC Executive Secretary James Lay, who was also present

at the meeting of September 21, 1960, stated: ‘I cannot recall
whether there was any discussion of assassinating Lumumba’ at
any NSC meetings." (Lay affidavit, DiS alo ip e).

already out of office (Dillon, 9/2/75, p. 48).* . When reminded
of the fact that Lumumba's movement and communications were

not restricted by the UN force and. that the Congolese army
continued to seek his arrest long after the NSC meeting, Dillon
acknowledged that during this period Lumumba continued to be
viewed by the United States as a potential threat and a volatile

force in. the Congo:

eae . He had this tremendous ability to stir up
a crowd or a group. And if he could have gotten
out and started to talk to a battalion of the
Congolese Army, he probably would have had them
in the palm of his hand in five minutes. (Dillon,
9/20/75, p. 49.)

John N. Irwin IL, who attended the NSC meeting as Assistant
Secretary of Defense, stated that although he had no recollection
of the discussion, the language of the minutes was "broad enough
to cover a discussion of ant (Irwin affidavit,
9/22/75, p. 2).

Richard Bissell testified'that, based upon his understanding
of the policy of the NSC toward Lumumba even after Lumumba was
in UN custody, he would read the minutes of September 21 to indi-

cate that assassination was contemplated "as one possible means"

* See Section 3,supra,for discussion of CIA cable traffic
indicating that Lumumba continued to be regarded as capable..
of taking over the government after he was deposed.and that
pressure to "eliminate" him did not cease until his death.

of "disposing of": Lumumba. (Bissell, 9/10/75, p. 70.) Bissell
was not present at the NSC meeting (NSC Minutes, 9/21/60)
Bissell's opinion stands in opposition to that of Gordon
Gray, the President's National Security Advisor, who Tikewise
testified that he could not remember the NSC discussion in which
he participated (Gray, 7/9/75, p. 57). When asked to interpret
the reference to "disposing of" Lumumba, Gray said he “put it in
the same category as ‘get rid of", ‘eliminate’ (Gray, 7/9/75,
p. 57). Early in his testimony, Gray stated that “assassination
could have been on the minds of some people when they used
these. words "‘eliminate' or ‘get rid of'" (Gray, 7/9/75, p. 17).
Nonetheless, when asked to comment on the minutes of the NSC
meeting of September 21, he said: "It was not my impression
that we had in mind the assassination of Lumumba" (Gray, 7/9/75,

p- 57).*

* John Eisenhower, who attended the NSC meeting as Assistant
White House Staff Secretary, said that he had no "direct
recollection" of the discussion but he found the minutes of
the meeting consonant with his "recollection of the atmosphere"
at the time: "the U.S. position was very much anti-Lumumba"
(Eisenhower, 7/18/75, p.9). He said:

I would not conjecture that the words "disposed of"
meant an assassination, if for no other reason than

if I had something as nasty as this to plot, I wouldn't
do it in front of 21 people . . . the number present
[at] the meeting. (Eisenhower, 7/18/75, p- 10.)

. (b) Testimony of Eisenhower White House Officials That
They Knew of No Presidential Consideration of
Assassination

The two-members of President Eisenhower's staff who were
responsible for national security affairs--Gordon Gray and
Andrew Goodpaster--both made general disclaimers of any knowledge

- of Presidential consideration of assassination during their
tenure.

Gordon Gray served as Special Assistant to the President
for National Security Affairs, in which capacity he coordinated
the National Security Council and represented the President at
Special. Group meetings. Gray testified that he did not recall
President Eisenhower "ever saying anything that contemplated
killing Lumumba" (Gray, 7/9/75, p. 28).* When asked to inter-
pret phrases from the minutes of. particular NSC and Special
Group meetings such as "getting rid of" or "disposing of"
Lumumba, Gray stated:

It is the intent of the user of the expression or
the phrase that is controlling and ‘there may well
have been in the Central Intelligence Agency plans
and/or discussions of assassinations, but... at
the level of the Forty Committee [Special Group]
or a higher level than ‘that, the National Security
Council , there was no active discussion in any way
planning assassination.

I agree that assassination could have

* At the outset of his testimony’on the subject, Gordon Gray
acknowledged that he did not have a-clear, independent recollec-
tion of Lumumba's role in the Congo (Gray, 7/9/75, pp. 25-26)

been on the minds of some people when they used
these words ‘eliminate’ or 'get rid of' ...1
am just trying to say that it was not: seriously
considered as a program of action by the Presi-
dent or even the Forty [Special] Group. (Gray,
7/9/75, p. 17.) :

Andrew, Goodpaster, the White House Staff Secretary to
President Eisenhower, said that he and Gray were the "principal
channels" between the President and the CIA, outside of NSC
meetings (Goodpaster, 7/17/75, p. 4). Goodpaster was responsi- f
ble for “handling with the President all matters of day-to-day
operations in the general fields of international affairs and
security affairs" (Goodpaster, 7/17/75, p. 3). He regularly
attended NSC meetings and was listed among the participants at
the NSC meetings of August 18, 1960 and September 21, 1960.

When asked if he ever heard about any assassination effort
during the Eisenhower: Administration, Coodpaster replied
unequivocally:

tiie at no time and in no way did I ever know
of or hear about any. proposal, any mention of
such an acitvity. . . . [I]t is my belief that
had such a thing been raised with the President
other than in my presence, I would have known
about it, and. . +. it would have been a matter
of such significance and sensitivity that I am
confident that . . . I would have recalled it had
such a thing happened. (Goodpaster, 7/17/75
p. 5.)

John Eisenhower, the President's son: who served under Good-

paster as Assistant White House Staff Secretary, stated that

the use of assassination was contrary to the President's philos-

HW 50955 Docld:32423524 Page 361


-113-

ophy that "no man is indispensable" (Eisenhower, 7/18/75, pe 14.)#
As a participant at NSC meetings who frequently attended dis-
cussions in the Oval Office relating to national security affairs,
John Eisenhower testified that. nothing that came to his atten-
tion in his experience at the White House "can be construed in

my mind in-the remotest way to mean any Presidential knowledge

of or concurrence in any assassination plots or plans" (Eisenhower,

7/18/75, p. 4). ae 7

Douglas Dillon testified that the subject of assassination

never arose in lis "direct dealings with either President

Eisenhower or President Kennedy (Dillon, 9/2/75, p. 22). He was
asked by a member of the Committee; however, to speculate upon

the general philosophical approach that Presidents Eisenhower eebees
and Kennedy would have taken to decisionmaking on the question

of using assassination as a tool of foreign policy:

Senator Hart (Colorado): I would invite your speculation at
this point as a sub-Cabinet officer under President Eisen-
hower, and as a Cabinet Officer under President Kennedy, I
think the Committee would be interested in your view as to
the attitude of each of them toward this subject, that is
to say, the elimination, violent elimination of foreign
leaders? :

Dillon: Well, that is a difficult thing to speculate on
in a totally different atmosphere. But I think probably
both of them would ‘have approached it in a very pragmatic
way, most likely, simply weighed the process and con-
sequence rather than in a way that was primarily of a
moral principle. . That is what would probably have been
their attitude in a few cases. Certainly the idea that
this was going to be a policy of the U.S., generally
both of them were very much opposed to it. (Dillon,
9/2/75, pp. 22-23.)

Dillon served as Undersecretary of State in the Eisenhower
Administration and as Secretary of the Treasury under Kennedy.

~ Other Eisenhower Administration officials who were active
in the Special Group in late 1960--Assistant Secretary of
Defense John N. Irwin II, Undersecretary of State for Political
Affairs Livingston Merchert, and Deputy Secretary of Defense
James Douglas--stated that they did not recall any discussion
about assassinating Lumumba (Irwin affidavit, 9/22/75, pp. 1-2;
Merchant atfidavit, 9/8/75, p. 1; Douglas affidavit, 9/5/75).
(c) Richard Bissell testified That; Despite His Lack of
a Specific Recollection, He “Strongly Inferred”

That. the Assassination Effort Against Lumumba Was
Authorized by President Eisenhower and Allen Dulles

Richard Bissell's testimony on the question of high-level
authorization for the effort to assassinate Lumumba is. prob-
lematic. Bissell insisted that he had no direct recollection
of receiving such authorization and that all of his testimony
on this subject "has to be described as inference" (Bissell,
9/10/75, p. 48). Bissell began’his testimony on the subject
by asserting that it was on his own initiative that he instructed
Justin O'Donnell to plan the assassination of Lumumba (Bissell,
6/11/75, pp. 54-55). Nevertheless, Bissell's conclusion--based
on his inferences from the totality of circumstances relating
to. the entire assassination effort against Lumumba--was that an
assassination attempt had been authorized at the highest levels
of the government (Bissell, 9/10/75, pp. 32-33, 47-49, 60-62,
65).

HW 50955 DocId:32423524 Page 363


-115-

As discussed above, Bissell testified that the minutes
of meetings of the Special Group on August 25, 1960 and the
NSC on September 21, 1960 indicate that. assassination was con-
templated. at the Presidential level as one acceptable means
of "getting rid of Lumumba" (see Sections 5(a) (ii) and 5(a) (iii)
supra) .

There was "no question", according to Bissell, that the
cable from Allen Dulles to the Chief of Station. in Leopoldville
on August 26, which called for Lumumba's removal and authorized
Hedgman to. take action without consulting headquarters, was a
direct outgrowth of the Special Group meeting Dulles had
attended the previous day (Bissell, 9/10/75, pp. 31-32).. Bissell aa

“was “almost certain" that he had-been informed about the Dulles
cable shortly after its transmission (Bissell, 9/10/75, p. 12).
Bissell testified that he assumed that assassination was one of
the means of removing Lumumba from the scene that is contemplated
within the language of Dulles' cable (Bissell, 9/10/75, p. 32):

It is my belief on the basis: of the cable drafted
by Allen Dulles that he regarded the action of
the Special Group as authorizing implementation
{of an assassination] if favorable circumstances
presented themselves, if it could be done covertly.
(Bissell, 9/10/75, pp. 64-65.)

Dulles' cable signalled to Bissell that there was Presi-

dential authorization for him to order action to assassinate

Lumumba (Bissell, 9/10/75, pp. 61-62):

HW 50955 DocId:32423524 Page 364


NW 50955

-116-

Q: Did Mr. Dulles tell you that President Eisenhower
- wanted Lumumba killed?

Mr. Bissell: I am gure he didn't.

: Did he ever tell you even circumlocutiously
through this kind of cable?

Mr. Bissell: Yes, I think his cable says it in effect.
(Bissell, 9/10/75, p. 33.)

As. for discussions with Dulles about the source of autho-

rization for an assassination effort against Lumumba, Bissell

stated:
I think it is probably unlikely that Allen Dulles
would have said either the President or President
Eisenhower even to me. I think he would have said,
this is authorized in the highest quarters, and I
would have known what he meant. (Bissell, 9/10/75,
p. 48.)

When asked if he had sufficient authority to move beyond the

consideration or planning of assassination to order implementa-

tion of a plan, Bissell said, "I probably did think I had [such]

authority" (Bissell, 9/10/75, pp. 61-62).
When informed about the Chief of Station's testimony
about the instructions he received from Gottlieb, Bissell said
that despite his absence of a specific recollection:
I would strongly infer in this. case that such an
authorization did pass through me, as it were,
if Sid Gottlieb gave that firm instruction to the
Station Chief. (Bissell, 9/10/75, p. 40.)

Bissell said that the DCI would have been the source of this

authorization (Bissell, 9/10/75, p. 40).

Bissell did not. recall being informed by Gottlieb that
Gottlieb had represented to the Chief of Station that there
was Presidential authorization for the assassination of Lumumba
(Bissell, 9/10/75, p. 46). But Bissell-said that assuming he
had instructed Gottlieb to carry poison to the Congo, "there
was no possibility" that he would have issued such an instruc-
tion without authorization. from Dulles (Bissell, 9/10/75,

p. 47). . Likewise Bissell said he "probably did" tell Gottlieb
that the mission had the approval of President Eisenhower
(Bissell, 9/10/75, p. 47). This led to Bissell's conclusion
that if, in fact, the testimony of the Chief of Station about
Gottlieb's actions is accurate, then Gottlieb's actions were
fully authorized:

Q: In light of the entire atmosphere at the Agency

and the policy at the Agency at the time, Mr.

Gottlieb's representation to the Chief of Station

that the President had instructed the DCI to

carry out this mission would not have been beyond

the pale of Mr. Gottlieb's authority at that

point?

Bissell: No, it would not. (Bissell, 9/10/75,
p. 65).

Bissell further stated:
Knowing: Mr. Gottlieb, it is literally inconceivable
to me that he would have acted beyond his instruc-
tions. (Bissell, 9/10/75, p. 41.)
With respect ‘to his assignment to Justin O'Donnell to "plan

and prepare for" the assassination of Lumumba (Bissell, 9/10/75

p. 24) Bissell testified that "it was my own idea to give

O'Donnell this assignment" (Bissell, 9/10/75, p. 50). But he
said that this specific assignment was made in the context

that an assassination mission against Lumumba already had autho-
rization above-the level of DDP. (Bissell, 9/10/75, p. 50; see
also pp. 32-33, 47-48, 60-62).
