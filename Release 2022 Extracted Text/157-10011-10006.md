In response to the increast noireen sothe operation tent

code and cipher materials, division d in 1960 began spotting of agent assets as

ity. During the same period requirements from NSA became more

refined and in many respects more sentative because most agencies are not equipped

to conduct this type of operation, and because of the desirability to completely centralize

control over this entire effort, it was determined that division d which was the closest-

touch with NSA on procurement requirements, could best conduct the activity. The spotting

activity has now advanced far enough to justify removing from the OOA category. (exhibit

With regard to paragraph 2 of Lansdale's memorandum to SGA dated 14 Nov.

1962 Harvey states:

"The statement that Operation Mongoose had had no information on

this operation since early October was patently false.

Specific references made to the

pen ultimate paragraph and Lansdale's memorandum concerning a report for the CIA which he

used as a basis for memorandum dated 31 Oct. 1962 to Oswald Kirkpatrick. This refers to

a telephonic conversation on the evening of 30 Oct. 1962 between Lansdale and Cheever

which is referred specifically in paragraph 2 on pages 7 and 8 of my reference memorandu.

I have discussed this matter in detail with Cheever and clearly recollects that his

conversation with Lansdale on that date took place as reflected in my reference memorandum.

During this conversation there was no discussion of previous operations except a brief

solection, the spera a question come mi assete inside or or operation ever's

SOURCE: would logically have led to the discussions at the timp sTArF:

of the Matahambre operation."
