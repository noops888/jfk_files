GUARDS DID NOT FIRE ON THE ATTACKERS BECAUSE THEY WERE AFRAID THEIR
SHOTS MIGHT SET OFF EXPLOSIVE CHARGES UNDER THE ROCKETS. THE PORT
OF CABANAS, ALTHOUGH REINFORCED SINCE RECENT ATTACKS, WOULD BE AN
EASIER TARGET FOR A RAID THAN THE ISLA DE PINOS AREA, THE PORT
1S PROTECTED BY ONLY A FEW GUARDS ON SATURDAYS AND SUNDAYS, AND IT
IS PARTICULARLY VULNERABLE BETWEEN THE HOURS OF MIDNIGHT AND 3 A.M.
