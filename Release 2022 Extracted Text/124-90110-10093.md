learned from LEOPOLDO ARAGON that the proposed meeting

had taken place on 12/11/59 in the office of I. IRVING

DAVIDSON as scheduled. MIRO had been turned down by

DAVIDSON but would possibly attempt to go to Nicaragua.

HEURTEMATTE stated that MIRO apparently convinced DAVIDSON

that he was not a communist and was anti-CASTRO. HEURTEMATTE

commented that this was not true and stated that he con-

that MIRO usingthe name CARLOS VASQUEZ placed a caltafrom

DAVIDSON's office to Panama telephone number 3-7001 and

attempted

concerning further investigative

efforts regarding MIRO.

Due to the fact that ARAGON

does not desire to testify for fear of reprisals by MIRo,

it is felt that successful prosecution of the subject

It is noted

that ARAGON has furnished the only documentary evidence
