Good. He pointed out that one of the first revolutions to take placo in
rodern times was the Mexican revolution ef Pancho Villa.” Re scit that hts
fenily had been intinately connected with this revolution and that he found
nany points of sluilarity between the aftermath of the Kextcan Revolution —
nationalication, agrdten“Yorn -- and Castro's present moverxats. He pointed
out that this vas nota surprising situation as Castro hirself spent @

came up with a number of sugsostions which I believe can best be gone into |

at any briefing scssicna-held between wii und Tichborn, One potat which =.

particularly inprossed ne vss Tichborn's eppreciation of thie situation, also
his early recognition of the fact that one of our prime targets should be
mombers of the 26 July Movenent who lave bicome disenchanted as 4 result of

Castro!s danagosie actions.

onough thought, I intend to propose to sH Divisicn that Tichburn cane east
next week for two or three days, to discuss the Cuban situation with -
reprosontatives of WH, at the end of this, he will return to Los Angelos,
get the case underway and hopefully will be avalleble to go to Cuba Figh

after the first of January, as soon as I have cleared’ this ‘with: Wij
