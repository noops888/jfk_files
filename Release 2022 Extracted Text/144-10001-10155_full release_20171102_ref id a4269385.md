MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

Reportion Examination of Naterial

Related to Lee Barey Oswald Case

The undersigned have examined all the material relating

to the lee Harvey Oswald case provided to us by the warren

cumission and have found no indication that any of the

...A.L.

Items was used for a cryptographic purpose or for passing

secret information:

a. A detailed examination of the dictionaries failed

to show any indication that they had been used in connection

with a dictionary code.

b. A revlew of the letters of all the correspondents

related to the case, as well as of the Oswald Diary and

other documents, provided no suggestion of the use of an

open code.

c. Perforations which suggested the use of a grille

system appeared on two pages of the Russian novel, GLAZA

KOTORYE: SPRASHIVAXUL,

"Questioning Eyes"- However, the

manner of perforating only a few letters does not conform

to any known systen. For purposes of further study, we

would like to obtain the original of the novel on long-ter

or permanent loan. Ne belleve, nevertheless, that it is most

Itkely that the letters were cut out for some purpose

related to oswald's photographic experiments.

d. The appearance of the term "niero dots" on page 44

of Lee Oswald's address book aroused our suspicions.:

particularly in that it was associated with the address of

the photographic firm where he was once employed. There

was nothing to indicate to us that micro dots vere actually

used and we have had to assuma that appropriate technical

tests were made by the FBI or CIA.

Oswald's soviet made portable radio recelver and

Its assoclated power supply were examined and tested by

R34 with negative results. The radio (for purposes of the

tests the power supply was considered an integral part)

conformed closely to one examined by the British In 1959.

A COPY of R34's findings 1s attached.

f, The names appearing in Lee's and Marina's address

books have been checked against NSA files but no CoMtiT

references have been aiscovered. Collateral references

held in the tiles have only confirmed knovn information.

A copy of the report 18 attached.

In addition to the Information on the addresses

developed in the personality check, a separate study of

NSA address files is being made.

• White this study is

not yet complete, results have so far been negative and

there is no reason to expect that anything beyond what

the personality check has already turned up will be

discovered.

MEMORINDUM FOR DRO TORDELLA

SUBJECT: Letter for the President's Commission

1. Please note that I have eliminated two items from the original

Memorandum for the Record on the examination of the Oswald materials:

These are the reference to micto dots" (paragraph d) and the COMINT

reference in paragraph 1.

l suggest that you informally (possibly by telephone) call the

Commission's attention to the appearance of the term micro dots" on

page 44 or Oswald's address book. You might Indicate that this reference

aroused our suspicion but that we do not feel competent to make an

exhaustive examination of the materials for the presence of micro dots -

such examination should be conducted by the FBI or CIA. If micro dots

are actually found, we would be happy to collaborate to the füllest

degree required in the analysis of these dots.

=3:

I do not believe a statement that we have checked the names

against the NSA files needs to be made since:

a. The results were negative and

b. It identifies the existence of sensitive COMINT records.

Of course, we had found something, a positive report would have been

required:

4- Mr. Amold has reviewed the text of the letter and accepts it

as unclassified under the circumstances.

Assassination of President Kennedy

200 Maryland Avenue N.E,

20002

ATIN: Mr. J. Lee Rankin

General Counsel

Doar Mi. Rankin;

skilled cryptologists at NSA carefully examined the materials

relating to the lee Harvey Oswald case provided by the Warren Con-

mission. The results are as follows:

a, A detailed examination of the two dictionaries revealed

no indication of their use for aryptographic purposes.

b. In the correspondence, the Oswald Diary, and the other

documets examined there were no evidences of the use of any type

of cryptography, to include the use of an open code.

C:

Certain letters had been removed from pages 150 and 152

of the Russian novel, GLAZA KOTORYE SPRASHIVAYUI, "Questioning

Eyes." Eight letters had apparently been out from page 152 as follows:

Line 10

Line 11

Line 13

Line 16

Line 24

Line 25

Line 27

One letter had been removed from page 150; however no significance

Is attributed to the removal of this letter since it corresponds in exact

position to one of the letters removed from page 152, It was con-

cluded that this letter had been accidently removed by the cutting

process applied to page 152 and that its removal resuited from the

application of excessive pressure on the cutting tool when the latter

on page 152 was taken out.

The sample is considered too small for any valle conclusions to

be reached as to the purposes for which the above noted letters were

removed. It is considered most unlikaly that this process of letter

removal has any cryptographic implication.

d. The Russian "Tourist" portable radlo was examined for

cryptologie evidence. The radio appears to be a normal raceiver and

there was no evidence of its use for any other purpose.

The names appearing in Lee's and Marina's address

books were checked, No evidence of cryptologie Implication was

found.

Although the results of the examination of the materials provided

by the Commission are essentially negative, further study of these

materials will be made. Il any rasults are obtained, the Commission

will be advised. However, It Is considered most unlikely that any-

thing beyond what is reported above will be discovered.

Sincerely,

GORDON À, BLAKE
