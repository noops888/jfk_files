acquainted with many KGB employees and could ddentify them
He alse would be intimately acquainted with a large number
of Soviet agents working inside the USSR against American

When GOLITSYN asked him where he was working in 1959, NOSENKO
replied that he was assigned to the Seventh Department.
“ NOSENKO served in the American Embassy Section from 1953

until 1957 or 1958, and was specifically responsible for

KGB coverage of American military personnel in Moscow during
-1953. For the. remainder of his service in the Embassy Section

personnel or correspondents, but he vas definitely in the

1958 NOSENKO vas transferred to the Seventh Department, and
was a senior case officer there as of 1959. NOSENKO did not
work in the Arerican Department of the Second Chief Directorate
American Department at any time during 1960; GOLITSYN visited
the Embassy Section on at least. three occasions from early

Sanit of the NOsENKO defection. When MOSENKO was being
considered for ass‘gauent to Geneva (in 1964), a Summary
statement of his activities was prepared in tke Second Chief
Directorate and oent to GRIBANOV. This summary contained
consijersble. “coupromtsing information", concerning NOSENKO;
if acted upon properly, it would have removed hin from
consideration for this trip. GRIBANOV read the summary -
material, ran a line through all of it, and, added the nota-
tion: "Send him to Geneva." The general feeling is that
GRIBAKOV was willing to overlook a lot of NOSENKO's :
deficiencies because of GRIBANQV's Long-time friendship |
with NOSENKO's father.

was responsible for sending him to Geneva in
