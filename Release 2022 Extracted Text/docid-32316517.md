} and FRA SKPERRARO would be taking over.

Informant also advised on this date that AY v
he had obtained $100,000 from FAT TONY! 2NO_ f
in the form of an interest,ifmee the loan“which money
was to be used by ANTHO: USSO.

Also on 3/3/64, informant related that
the subject was intending to sell his home in Englewiaotk oliffs, |
New Jersey, and although it is worth $100,000, the subject
would take as little as $62,000 for it just to get his
money out of the country. EBOLI stated that he would take
this money along with $30,000 or $35,000 that he has in
AT&T stock, and place it possibly in a bank in Nassau where
it could earn him 6 or 7% interest. His concern centered
around the fact, that according to the informant, he
was being audited by Internal Revenue Service for the
years 1960 and 1961 and feared that the Government
would put a lien on his money, He was heard to make
a remark that “any minute something is going to
cave in."

SAS participating in the physical surveillance
of the subject on 3/4/64 were LEONARD H, MC COY, PATRICK
3. MOYNIHAN, JOHN D. SWIFT, JEROME N. BOWERS, RICHARD P, CAREY
and Inspector WILLIAM SULLIVAN.
