Re: Request - J. Seelmaecker (IRS 75-2105)

Re request for copy of the study entitled: “Soviet Use of Assassination.

and Kidnapping." (NOTE: Requestor states he is a German national).

‘There is. attached a sanitized version of the study, which was
apparently prepared in or prior to February 1964, and transmitted to
the Warren Commission at that time. However, the report as trans-
mitted was classified SECRET. There is some indication that the
document has since been declassified, and National Archives may have
a declassified version.

Would it be appropriate at this point to initiate inquiry with
Natinal Archives to.determine.if, in fact, Archives does have this
declassified version, and to provide us a copy of the study and details
relating to the declassification, so that CI may amend its record for
FOIA requests relating to this subject matter.

A copy of the sanitized version (with deletions on pages 25 and
26) is attached, and we will await your advice before we consider this
study as actually released. It would apprear. appropriate that this
study should be routed through SE/CI (J. Flaherty) for. coordination
prior to release. A copy of the transmittal letter to the Warren

Introduction Doo
Ithas long been known that the Soviet state security service

(currently the KGB) resorts to abduction and murder to combat what

are considered to be actual or potential threats to the Soviet regime.

These techniques, frequently designated as "executive action"? and known

within the KGB as. "liquid affairs" (Mokryyc Dela), can be a are employed

abroad as well as within the borders of the USSR. They have been used

against Soviet citizens, Soviet emigres and even foreign nationals, A list

of those who have fallen victim to such action over the years would be a very

long one and would include even the co-founder of the Soviet state, Léon .

TROTSKY. Several well known Soviet assassination operations which have

occurred since the rise of KHRUSHCHEV attest to the fact that the present

leadership of the USSR still ees this method of dealing with its enemies.
The sudden disappearance or unexpected death of a person known to

possess anti-Soviet convictions immediately raises the suspicion of Soviet

involvement. Because it is often impossible to prove who is responsible

1. Strictly speaking, the term "executive action" encompasses
diversionary activitics (such as sabotage) as well as terroristic activilics.

This paper, however, discusses only the terroristic aspect of Sovict

executive action, namcly kidnapping and assassination.



13-00000

for such incidents, Sovict intelligence is frequently blamed and is
undoubtedly credited with successes it actually has not achieved. On the
other hand, even in cases where. the Soviet hand is obvious, investigation
often produces only fragmentary information, due to the KGB ability to
‘camouflage its trail, In addition, Soviet intelligence is doubtless involved
in incidents that never become officially recognized as executive action,
such as assassinations which are recorded as accidents, suicide, or
natural deaths,

All of the factors cited above have helped to obscure Soviet practices
in regard to assassinations and abductions outside the USSR. Certain
observations can be made, however, which will help to put these practices
into their proper perspective. These observations are set forth in the
following paragraphs and are based on information produced by the investigatior
of known or suspected Soviet operations which have occurred since World
War Il, as well as from information supplied by defectors during this period.
Targets

The large numbers of former citizens of the USSR (and of imperial
Russia) living abroad in protest against the Sovict regime have been a

continuing cause for concern to the Soviets since the carly twenties,

authurity oft



13-00000

Reducing and keeping to a minimum the potential threat to the regime

represented by these cmigres is one of the functions of the state security
service. Soviet intelligence seeks to neutralize, discredit and destroy

anti-Soviet groups by luring emigres back to the USSR, by penetrating

. emigre organizations, and by kidnapping or murdering individual emigres

considered to be particularly dangerous.

Emigre leaders who participate in anti-Soviet activities have been
primary targets of Soviet abduction or assassination operations. Such
operations are sometimes designed to demonstrate. that the Soviet regime
can strike its enemies anywhere in the world. The Soviets hope thereby
to create fear, unrest, confusion and dissension within emigre organizations
and at the same time deter other emigres from joining their ranks. The
planned assassination of NTS leader Georgiy S. OKOLOVICH in February
1954 represented a particularly significant step toward achieving this goal,
but the act was not carried out because of the defection of state security
Captain Nikolay KHOKHLOV.

On the other hand, assassinations of some emigre leaders have been
carxied out so skillfully as to leave the impression that the victims died
from natural causes. Details of some of the techniques uscd to achicve
this were brought to light in 1961 when professional KGB assassin Bogdan

STASHINSKIY defected to the West and revealed that he had successfully

performed two such missions, In 1957 he killed Ukrainian emigre writer
Lev REBET in Munich with a poison vapor gun which left the victim dcad
of an apparent heart attack, In 1959, the same type of weapon was used on
Ukrainian emigre leader Stepan BANDERA, although BANDERA's death
was never fully accepted as having been from natural causes, These
cases are discussed in more detail later in this paper.

Executive action is also triggered by any signs of possible disloyalty
on the part of Soviet officials abroad. The Soviets have gone to great lengths
in the past to silence their intelligence officers who have defected, as
evidenced by the assassination of former state security officer Ignace
REISS in 1937 and the unexplained "suicide" of former Soviet military
intelligence officer Walter KRIVITSKY in 1941. In the post-war era, their
determination to prevent such defections was vividly demonstrated by the
unsuccessful attempt to force fe wife of Vladimir PETROV to return to
the Soviet Union from Australia after his defection in April 1954. The

‘practice of physical restraint applies with equal force to other Soviet
officials who attempt to defect or are suspected of being on the verge of

doing so. Examples were witnessed in Calcutta, India in January 1958

and Rangoon, Burma in May 1959. The respective victims, Aleksandr

FF. ZELENOVSKHIY and Mikhail I. STRYGIN, were both portrayed by the
Sovicts as mental cases, were taken into custody by means of strong-arm
tactics, and were forcibly removed to the USSR ina matter of days.

Foreign nationals are sometimes victims of Soviet tetas action.
The targets who fall into this category may be indigenous agents who have
become suspect a former citizens of Satellite countries who have turned
against the Soviet regime. In the latter. case, actions against such individuals
are usually carried out through the corresponding Satellite intelligence
service, aided and abetted by soviet state security, The abductions of
Dr. Walter LINSE and Bohumil LAUSMAN exemplify this type of operation. i
LINSE had fled East Germany in 1947 and later became a leader of the
"Society of Free Jurists," an ‘anti-Communist organization that the Soviets
considered particularly dangerous. He was kidnapped from West Berlin
in July 1952 by agents of the East German security service, with the full
knowledge and approval of sovict state security; he was later turned over

to Soviet authorities in Karlshorst, East Berlin and eventually sentenced

to imprisonment in the USSR.” LAUSMAN, a prominent Czcch anti-Communist
who had fled to the West in 1949, disappeared from Vienna in 1953. It was
Jater learned that he had been kidnapped by agents of Czech intelligence, with
the official sanction of Moscow. The soviet state security rezidentura in

Vienna also had been directed to assist the operation by supplying a car

‘for transporting LAUSMAN to Praguc and arranging for the vehicle to have

free passage through the Soviet Zone of Austria.

Foreign political leaders are also potential targets of Soviet executive
action operations and, according to recent information, tite KGB's executive
action component includes such persons among its targets. There is, however,
no evidence proving that any Western leader has been the victim of Soviet

executive action.

2. LINSE died ina Soviet prison camp 15 December 1953, according
to a statement issued by the Soviet Red Cross on 8 June 1960, a virtual ©
admission of Soviet responsibility for the kidnapping. The cited date of
his death is at variance, however, with information from fellow prisoners.
of LINSE who reported having seen him in 1954 and 1955.

Organization

The executive action component of the Sovict government is currently
designated the Thirteenth Department of the KGB intelligence directorate
(First Chicf Directorate), The earliest known predecessor of the Thirteenth
Department was the so-called "Directorate of Special Tasks" reportedly
established within the NKVD in December 1936 for terror purposes. During
World War II terror missions were performed by the NKGB Fourth Directorate
which was responsible for partisan activity behind German lines. In late 1945
or early 1946 this directorate was replaced by a unit of the MGB known as
Spets Byuro #1 which was organized to retain Fourth Directorate personnel
to support and direct partisan activities behind enemy lines in the event of
a future war. In-the summer of 1952, however, the long-range aspects of
Spets Byuro #1's mission were abandoned, and emphasis was shifted to
using all available agents for Gaboe as and other violent activities, Spets
Byuro #1 was given a new, and at present still unknown, designation sometime
in 1953 and assigned to carry out "special action tasks,'' such as sabotage,
political murders and kidnappings. With the creation of the KGB in 1954, the
executive action component was redesignated as the Thirteenth Department,
Although the jurisdiction of the department is global, its main target arcas
are the United States and members of Western trcaty organizations. There

is no evidence of the existence of any unit within the Sovict military intclli-
gence component (the GRU) responsible for the type of executive action
discussed in this paper, although the GRU reportedly can undertake such
operations under certain circumstances. Z

The Thirteenth Department is believed to be divided into sections
(otdeleniye) or directions (napravleniye) by countries or groups of countries,
such as, for example, the United States ("the principal enemy"), England,
Latin America, etc. At Moscow headquarters the department has approxi~
mately 50-60 experienced employees, and was last known to be fieara by
General (fnu) RODIN, who under the alias KOROVIN had previously been the
KGB resident in Great Britain. Secrecy about the work of this department
is maintained through the careful selection and training of its personnel;
the officers do not discuss their experience among others; department
documents are not circulated.

In addition to headquarters personnel, the 13th Department has its
own support officers in legal residencies in Western countries and in some
Satellite countries. Such support officers work under the instructions of
the legal resident and the 13th Department. One of the more active groups
is a unit in East Germany which numbers perhaps 20-30 persons, As. of :
1960 there was a group in China, .but it probably no longer exists. Prior
to 1955 there was also a group in Austria. In a country in which a support

officer of the 13th Department is stationed, the legal resident and the
headquarters department for that country arc aware of the targets of
the 13m Department in that country, although they are not aware of
illegal agents who are in direct contact with the 13th Department.

Although the Thirteenth Department is the KGB's executive action
component, the Emigre (Ninth) Department directs all operations, including
assassination operations, against Soviet emigres. The Emigre Department's

assassination operations, however, are believed to be conducted jointly

with the Thirteenth Department and sometimes other KGB components;
for example, the counterintelligence directorate (Second. Chief Directorate).
‘The 13th Department also supports the Disinformation (12th) Depart-
ment of the First Chief Directorate in the latter's covert propaganda
campaigns aimed at the creation of confusion and panic in Western countrics.
An example is the campaign conducted, in 1959 and later, for the purpose of
creating adverse world opinion toward West Germany. This campaign
included setting fire to synagogues and painting swastika signs in public
places and attributing these acts to West Germans. Other operations in
which both the Thirteenth Department and the Disinformation Department
are involved include attempts to remove the threat to Sovict interests posed
by certain members of Western governments. Sometimes this entails
arranging for the dismissal of such persons from public’‘office, but, in

the puyratJqastnaph sould mean "climinating" them physically.

the cxecutive action department. One produced special weapons and explosive

“The explosives laboratory was located near Kuchino, outside Moscow, and
was responsible for the development and production of weapons, from
drawing up blueprints to melting and pouring bullets. In no a was assistance

The laboratory for poisons was supposedly a large and super-secret

Other sources, however, have reported the existence of.this type of laboratory
dating back to the purges in the late 1930's. A report from one source in
1954 described an experimental laboratory within Spets Byuro #1 known as
the "Chamber" (Kamera"), This laboratory conducted experiments on
prisoners and persons subject to execution to test the effectiveness of
different powders, beverages and liquors and various types of injections, as

in October 1953, according to an announcement made to

and operation of the laboratory solely to BERIYA and his cohorts. Whether
or not this step actually was taken does not rule out the possibility, however,

Training for exccutive action operations was conducted at'a base in
Moscow bya staff of instructors who specialized in such subjects as the use
of small arms, jujitsu, codc, wireless, driving, surveillance, and photography.

Although executive action operations outside the USSR are planned,
directed, and sometimes carried out by state security staff personnel, a
mission may also be performed by one or more agents recruited. specifically
for this purpose. KHOKHLOV himself, for instance, was categorically
forbidden to assassinate OKOLOVICH personally. Two German agents,
Hans KUKOWITSCH and Kurt WEBER, were to carry out the deed under
KHOKHLOV's supervision. This reflected Soviet theory that indigenous
personnel would have better ‘access to the target, and also had the advantage
of avoiding direct Soviet attribution. It appears from the STASHINSKIY case,
however,. that security considerations ruled out. the involvement of non-Sovicts
in more recent operations.

Even though some sources have made statements to the contrary, it

mission of this nature.” KHOKHLOV spoke of special eeeenve action

units known as '"'boyevaya gruppa" (literally, combat groups) which

consisted of indigenous agents and/or Soviet iliegal staff officers situated

outside the borders of the USSR on the territory of hostile governments or in
" close proximity thereto. . Such groups were armed and prepared to perform

executive actions when required to do so, either in time of peace or war.

A group of this type under the direction of the executive action department

base at Karlshorst ostensibly was involved in the kidnapping of Dr. Alexander

TRUSHNOVICH, an NTS leader in West Berlin, in April 1954.. KHOKHLOV

believed the abductors to have been recruited and organized by the East

German security service at the request of the KGB chief at Karlshorst.

The same type of group was mentioned in connection with the abduction of

Dr. LINSE; the actual abduction was reportedly performed by four German

members of a "'boyevaya gruppa" from East German. It is probable that

such teams are a modern Peres of the "mobile groups" described by a

pre-war source as units dispatched from Moscow to foreign countries to

assassinate Trotskyites and state security officers who refused to return

to the USSR, as in the case of REISS and possibly KRIVITSKY.

Techniques HE

Many known or suspected executive action cases in the post-war
period have involved the use of poison rather than guns 7 explosives.
It is conceivable that the Sovicts tend to favor poisons because murders
can be accomplished more surreptitiously in this manner and in some
instances without leaving easily recognizable traces of foul play. Drugs
are also used to incapacitate a person temporarily for abduction purposes,
as reportedly happened in the TRUSHNOVICH case and in the kidnapping of
another NTS member, Valeri P. TREMMEL, from Linz, Austria in June
1954. There are, however, many unknown, uncontrollable factors in the use
of poisons and drugs which limit and often preclude their usage. Probably
the most important is. the narrow span between.a dose that will cause disability
and one that will cause death. ‘Dosages vary from one individual to another
depending upon the person's weight, state of health, and the way the poison
enters the body. The type used obviously is determined by the result desired.
It is no problem to cause death, but often difficult to control dosage success-
fully when the objective is to incapacitate an individual only temporarily.

There appears to be no consistency in the use of poisons by Sovict
intelligence to cause disability or death, or in the repetitious use of any

one drug. Chemicals which have been used in cases known or suspected

(fo person ti

to be Sovict instigated include arsenic, potassium cyanide, scopolamine,

and thallium. Other likely substances are atropine, Meveauaratse. chlo-
ral hydrate, paraldchydce and Warfarin. Combinations of two or more
substances may also be used, which further complicates diagnosis and
tracing. -

One well publicized poisoning case involved the defector Nikolay
KHOKHLOV. KHOKHLOV suffered a sudden and severe illness while
attending an anti-Communist meeting in Frankfurt, Germany in September
1957. ‘A positive diagnosis was precluded by the initial Gestion given
him at a German hospital, .but there was evidence of his having been
poisoned by a thallium derivative of arsenic and/or other chemical agents,
and.a strong possibility that the poison had been administered at RIS.
instigation. KHOKHLOV himself believed, and allegedly had supporting
medical opinion, that he had been poisoned by radio-activated thallium.

He believed that the poison was of Russain origin because it was such a
complicated substance that it was difficutl to analyze and had been carefully
prepared to leave virtually no trace. A unique mechanism for administering
poison was described by a knowledgeable source as a pneumatically operated
poison ice "atomizer" which leaves no wound or other evidence of the cause
of death. The equipment and techniques used in the poisoning of REBET and
BANDERA are treated below in some detail as examples of the most recent

’

and sophisticated mcthods in use by the KGB.

Specific Cases .
I. . STASHINSKIY

In November 1961] a Sovict intelligence. officer, Bogdan STASHINSKIY,
surrendered to the West German police, stating that he had, acting under

official orders, assassinated two individuals during the previous few
years: Lev REBET, a Ukrainian emigre ren Stepan BANDERA, a
leader of the Ukrainian Nationalist movement. In both canes a similar
type of weapon had been used: a gun which fired vaporized poison which
Killed almost instantly upon being inhaled. The properties of the killing
agent were such that, until the defection of the assassin, both victims
were officially believed to have died from heart attacks. In the case of
BANDERA, however, there was some unconfirmed suspicion of potassium
cyanide poisoning although there was insufficient evidence to prove it.
The Weapon

The weapon used to assassinate REBET was a light-weight aluminum
cylinder, 15-18 cm. long and approximately 3 cm. in diameter, and .
weighing about 200 grams. The cylinder was divided into three separate
chambers, one of which contained liquid poison scaled hermetically into
a plastic-type ampule container under low pressure. (At normal temperatures
the poison would evaporate, disappearing without trace in about two minutes, )
The three components could be assembled by means of a thread which allowed

-15-

"aimee


13-00000

one part to screw into the other. The first component was the poison
ampulc portion, the front end of which had a fine metallic screen. The
poison ampule fitted solidly against the walls of the metal cylinder. The
center component contained a piston and a piston arm which extended into
the third or activating component. The latter contained a spring-mounted
activating arm which, when drawn back, armed the weapon. A releasing
arm was appended to the third component at an angle and wa attached to
the activating arm by means of a releasing catch. A small safety arm
permitted the weapon to be placed in the safety position. The third component
also contained a few grams of powder.

The maximum effective range of the weapon was about one-half
meter; at one and one-half meters the effect of the vapors would be
questionable; and at two and one-half meters, the vapors would be totally
ineffective. (The assassin was instructed to fire the weapon only inches
from the face.)

The weapon was activated as follows: The activating arm was pulled
back and the safety released. The weapon was then activated. It was
held in the palm of the hand in such a fashion that it fired when the user
pressed the releasing arm towards the activating arm, The releasing
arm, when pressed, acted upon the releasing catch, permitting the spring-held

CLASSIFICATION CANCELED eee

sshority of EME &



oe

— : cee
activating arm to fly forward against the small charge of powder, The
exploding powder (which made a noise approximating the sound ofa loud
handclap with the hands cupped) drove the piston arm forward, causing the
piston to strike against the poison ampule. The poison was thus driven out
through the fine screen in the form of a que spray. -

The weapon used for the second assassination was similar, except
that it was double-barrelled. Each barrel contained a charge of poison
similar to that contained in the ‘single-barrelled weapon; however, the
two barrels could be discharged separately or together as a.unit. Thus,
in the event the first charge did not kill the victim, a second attempt could
be made. The two barrels were welded together and the weapon had two
releasing arms, two releasing catches, two safeties, and two activating arms.
The effect of the poison was the same.

Utilization of the Weapon

For maximum effective results it is recommended that the liquid
poison be shot directly into the face of the victim, in order to introduce
the vapors most quickly into the respiratory system. Since the vapors
rise upwards very rapidly, the poison is still effective when aimed at the

chest; conceivably, this would be sufficient time to allow the victim time

to scream.

; Effects of the Poison
The effect of the poisonous vapors is such that the arteries which

feed blood to the brain become paralyzed almost immediately. Absence
of blood in the brain precipitates a normal paralysis of the brain or _
heart attack, as a result of which the victim dies. The victim is
clinically dead within one and one-half minutes after inhaling these
poisonous vapors. After about five minutes the effect of the poison
wears off entirely, permitting the arteries to return to their normal
condition, leaving no trace of the killing agent which precipitated the
paralysis or the heart attack.

Allegedly, no foreign matter can be discovered in the body or on
the clothes of the victim, no matter how thorough an autopsy or examination.
The liquid spray can be seen as it leaves the nose of the weapon, however,
and droplets can also be seen on the face of the victim.

STASHINSKIY claimed that, before using the weapon on his first victim,
he tested it ona dog. He fired the gun directly into the dog's face, holding
his hand approximately one and one-half feet from its nose. Almost
immediately after the liquid spray had hit its face the dog rolled over,
without making any sound whatever. It continued to writhe for almost three
minutes, however. STASHINSICY was told that the poison affected a human
much sooner, causing death within one and one-half minutes.

Safcty Precautions fur the User

STASHINSKIY was told that neither the poisonous liquid nor the fatal
fumes affected any portion of the body other than the respiratory system,
and that, since it could not enter the body through the skin or the pores,
one could safely place his hands into a pail of the poison.. Inasmuch as
the weapon was held at arm's length when fired and the liquid spray ejected
forward in a conical pattern, the user, under normal conditions, is safe
from the effects of the poisonous vapors,. Nevertheless, as an extra
precaution, STASHINSKIY was provided with counteractive agents to
use if he so desired.

Concealment Methods

For transportation, the weapon was transported hermetically
sealed in a container, and inserted between sausages in a can which
was itself hermetically sealed. It was suggested to STASHINSKIY that
he should carry the weapon to the site of the planned assassination
wrapped in a light newspaper, in which he had torn a small hole to
enable him to reach the safety quickly just before using the weapon.

Method of Attack

In the first assignment, STASHINSKIY observed REBET debarking

from a streetcar at about 0930 hours. Observing that the victim was heading

for his office, the assassin preceded him into the building and climbed the

circular staircase to the first floor, On hearing REBET's footsteps on
the staircase, STASHINSKIY turned and started walking down, keeping to the
left, and carrying the weapon, wrapped in newspaper, in- his right hand, The
two met about halfway between the two floors. Firing directly into REBET's
face from a distance of approximately one~half meter, STASHINSKIY continued
walking downstairs without even breaking his pace. The victim lurched
silently forward and fell on the staircase. While still in the building,
STASHINSKIY shook off the liquid drops from the weapon and put it in the
breast pocket of his suit. (A laboratory examination of the suit later revealed
nothing of significance.) Although he had no reason to believe that he had in-
haled the poisonous fumes, he used the counteractive measures provided.
He later disposed of the murder weapon ina shallow canal in the city.

In carrying ‘out his second mission, STASHINSKIY used a similar
approach, Having previously abandoned an attempt to corner BANDERA
in the latter's garage, the assassin gained entry into the victim's apartment
house by reproducing a key which he had observed being used in the front
door lock, On the day of the assassination, having seen BANDERA drive
into his driveway, STASHINSKIY let himself into the apartment building
and waited, BANDERA, carrying several packages of fruit and vegetables
inhis right hand, entered the front door with the aid of a key which was on

a key ring together with other keys. As he was attempting to disengage the

key from the lock, STASHINSKIY moved away from the clevator, where
he had been standing, foward the front door, The weapon was in his hand
with the safety released. As he walked past the victim, who was still
trying to extracate the key from the lock, the assassin took the door
handle with his left hand, as if to assist BANDERA, asking him "Doesn't
it work?" By this time, BANDERA had succeeded in pulling the key out
of the lock. Almost at the instant he replied "Yes, it works, " STASHINSKIY
fired both barrels simultaneously into his face at almost point-blank
range. Seeing the victim lurch backwards and to the side, the assassin
walked out of the apartment building and closed the front door. Although
he did not wait to see BANDERA drop to the ground, STASHINSKIY is certain

that, contrary to press reports, the man did not scream or otherwise call

for help. STASHINSKIY later threw the murder weapon into the same canal

in which he had discarded the first weapon,

Although the press reported that BANDERA had been attacked physically
before he was poisoned, STASHINSKIY insisted that he had used no force,
since it had not been necessary todo so. Some newspapers also reported
that BANDERA had died of potassium cyanide poisoning. STASHINSKIY claims
that he was told, and believes, that the chemical was not potassium cyanide,
since (1) he thinks that substance could not have heed introduced into the body

by the method employed, and (2) he believes the RIS would have no reason to

deceive him on this matter, especially since he had to be provided with
counteractive precautions. STASHINSKIY. claimed that one of his Sovict
contacts was pleased to learn that the police suspected potassium cyanide,
since this allegedly indicated that the truc cause of the victim's death
was not evident.

W, RADIO FREE EUROPE

The New York Times reported on an attempt to poison the staff
of RFE on November 21, 1959, by placing atropine in the salt shakers
of the cafeteria used by RFE personnel. Atropine is a derivative from the
deadly nightshade plant; it can cause paralysis or death if taken in sufficient
quantity. The amount of poison in each salt shaker was said to be 2.36% by
weight of the contents. White crystalline alkaloid is indistinguishable from
salt. (Unclassified, from NYT, 17 December 1959.)

Il: STEIN

In March 1955, Lisa STEIN, an interviewer with RIAS, the American
propaganda radio station in West Germany ("Radio in American Sector"), was
fed candy containing the highly dangerous poison scopolamine. . (scopolamine
is used in the so-called "twilight sleep." Given in small doses it induces a
kind of euphoria; in larger doses it is supposed to be a deadly poison.)
It. was intended that Frau STEIN would become ill and would be abducted. The

plan was that the agent - someone whom Frau STEIN trusted and with whom

she was mcecting ina West Berlin cafe - would offer the poisoned candy
toward the end of the meeting. The lady was expected to become ill while
walking frum the cafe to her nearby residence. On becoming unconscious,
she was-to be picked-up by a waiting car which would appear to be passing

by chance. The plot was not carried to fruition, however, because Frau

STEIN did not become ill until she was near her apartment, at which point
neighbors came to her aid and she was moved to a hospital. “She was

the pistol would poheeais the victim's clothing and enter the skin. There

is allegedly no danger to the user.
Trends
Since World War I, and especially in the years since Stalin's death,
assassination attempts abroad have become increasingly rare. Currently
the’ emphasis in the executive action field is placed on sabotage and sabotage
planning ee than terrorism against individuals, The Soviets now apparently
resort to murder only in the case of persons considered especially dangerous
to the regime and who, for one. reason or another, cannot be kidnapped. A
kidnapped person is obviously more valuable inasmuch as the Soviets may
be able to extract from him information of interest, as well as use him for
‘propaganda purposes. by making it appear that he defected to the Soviet side of
his own free will, This course was followed in the case of Dr, TRUSHNOVICH.
It is also likely that the Soviets find it increasingly difficult to find persons
willing to undertake murder assignments, while the same may not be true
of abduction operations, It can further be conjectured that the Soviets are
now more concerned about the adverse publicity generated by Soviet assassina-
tions in general than they were in previous years.

In this connection, comments made by statc security defectors Pctr
DERYABIN and Yury RASTVOROV in 1954 about what the Soviets would or
would not do are still of interest. Both believed that the Soviets would
murder one of their officials on the verge of defecting if that were the only
way of preventing the act. The same would apply toa Soviet official who had
just defected if thereby state secrets could be preserved and if they believed
that killing him would not bring about a more adverse situation in terms. of
politics and propaganda than already existed. DERYABIN and RASTVOROV
doubted, however, ‘that the Soviets would murder an official who had been in
non-Communist hands long enough to have been exploited for intelligence and
propaganda purposes. While both granted that in particular. cases the Soviets
might go to any extreme, they both believed, generally speaking, that the
adverse propaganda resulting from such an act would negate its original purpose
On the other hand, KHOKHLOV, who might have been in a better position to
know, has stated without qualification that the Soviets would continue to
assassinate defectors in the future. The threat of Soviet executive action
against defectors is also considered a real one by Reino HAYHANEN, who
defected from the KGB in 1957. A still more recent Soviet intelligence source
also believes that standard Sovict practice is to mount a kidnapping or
assassination operation "through all intelligence opportunitics" against

'
defectors from the Soviet intelligence scrvices.

DERYABIN and RASTVOROV further agreed that the Soviets, without
hesitation, would forcibly return to the USSR someone on the verge of
defecting at a mission abroad. This was borne out by the aforementioned
STRYGIN and ZELENOVSKIY cases. DERYABIN and RASTVOROV also
believed that the same policy would apply to a Soviet official who had just
defected, or ane who had been in non-Communist hands long enough to have
been exploited for intelligence and propaganda purposes, if the capability
existed for returning him physically to the USSR.

Lastly,: DERYABIN believed that the assassination of an Allied official
would be highly unlikely and probably unprofitable. He also doubted that
the Sovicts would attempt to kidnap any U.S. officials unless they were
particularly knowledgeable. Such an incident would not be worth the trouble
for an average official, ican important person conceivably would have

sufficient information to make it worthwhile.
