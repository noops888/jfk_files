SUMMARY OF EXPECTED TESTOMONY OF NYSNTOMEDS

DH.
JUSTIN O'DONNELL a
ceed caus reresesod itd sosslTEHFEOSSIHIESCESITE BY.

At 2:00 p.m., before hearing Mr. Bissell, the Committee will hear
briefly the testimony of Mr. Justin O'Donnell regarding Lumumba.

O'Donnell was in OSS and CIA for almost 30 years and Station Chief
for CIA in Bolivia, Thailand, Turkey and Holland. When he came back
to headquarters in early 1960 he became Deputy Chief of Staff D of
the Directorate of Plans. The Chief was William Harvey.

In the Fall of 1960, Patrice Lumumba had been dismissed as Premier
of the newly independent and troubled Congo. He was under house deten-
tion, but was being guarded -- and protected -- by U.N. forces, and
thus was beyond the immediate reach of President Kasavubu and emerging
strong man Col. Mobutu.

At this time (Fall of 1960) Mr. Bissell was DDP.(As Station Chief
in Turkey in the late 1950's O'Donnell had come to know Mr. Bissell.)
Bissell called ‘O'Donnell in and asked him to assassinate Lumumba --

Bissell sent him to a scientist in the Technical Services Division
who, in effect, described various chemical and bilogical techniques
and said "pick your poison."

O'Donnell went back to Bissell and refused to do it because he
was opposed to assassination. O'Donnell then went immediately next
door to Helms' office (Helms was then Bissell's deputy) and told him
what had transpired. Helms agreed O'Donnell had been right to refuse.
These events all occurred on the same evening within an hour.

O'Donnell did agree to go to the Congo to run a. political operation
to neutralize Lumumba. His plan was to entice, or snatch, Lumumba out
of is protective U.N. detention and turn him over to Mobutu for trial
under Congolese law for crimes he had allegely committed. O'Donnell
was in the Congo for 3 months.

In the Congo, O'Donnell was told by the Station Chief Lawrence
Devlin that there was a virus in the Station Chief's safe. O'Donnell
clearly understood this to mean a lethal one for use against Lumumba.
He heard no more about it. He does not know if we had anything to. do
with Lumumba's actual death, but does not think we did.

Subsequently, while in the Congo he spoke about assassination, in
the context of the Congo, with Devlin and with Bronson Tweedy, the
Africa Division Chief.

Giancana/Maheu. “Dulles was completely
unaware"

Said B told AG during recent briefings to
RFK end Taylor that “some of CIA activity
involved use of G and underworld.

Does this mean he didn't recall the WH part?

N.B. at this time E was telling the FBI only
