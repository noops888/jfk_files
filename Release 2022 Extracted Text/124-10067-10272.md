Memorandum to Mr. T. W. Leavitt

Be Lee Harvey Oswald CONFIGENTIAL

, In the above instance, Legat, Mexico City would not
have been able,to respond to the American Ambassador in a
timely manner Yyitnout the aid of CIA. Fortunate for the
Legat, CIA pladed enough importance on the release to have
it flown to Mexico by courier... In this instance, the
Legat's office was in real jeopardy. (the Government of
Mexico will cooperate as long as the Cooperation is not
made a matter of public record. The Mexican Government is
very nationalistic, and makes te ffort in public to

appear free of U. S. influence Gu

i Legat, Mexico y has now alerted us.of a teletype
which was sent 1/15/78ffrom CIA Headquarters |to their (9
a

of Station in Mexico Yy,Jconcerning release under the

FOIA of documents in captioned matter. Legat, Mexico fone
expressed his concern over the adverse publicity likely~to
result and the impact on our relations with Mexico. He

again cited the need to advise in advance the U. S. Ambassador
in Mexico City and the Legat's contacts there, which is m
difficult by the insufficient lead time granted in this 2)
matterge By teletype to all SACs and Legats dated 1/16/78,
notification was made that the above material was to be

released 1/18/78.

The two above-cited instances point out the necessity
of prior notification and the dire consequences of failure
to notify the host government and the American Embassy concerned.
Failure to properly inform the American Ambassador in advance
places our. Legat in’ a most embarrassing position which could
possibly be avoided. Failure to promptly provide similar in-
formation to the Legal Attache could easily jeoparize our
entire Legal Attache operation, taking into account (

u)

sensitivities of the host country government.

RECOMMENDATION:

Wee Yrnat in order to avoid placing our foreign operations
in*jebpardy,} future releases effecting our Legats be coordinated

in advance with the Intelligence Division.
