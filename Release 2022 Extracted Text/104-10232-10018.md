tion approxizately $700 per ronth for their operating expen:

some a little rore ~ (MRR, Reacute, 30 do Nov, 20 de Kayes
fontes, Kontecristi). I

Won I questioned whethor the Ponteorieti oryanizaticr vac util? in
the CRC, he caid it. vas, that only Justo Curillo had dropred out of the
CRC but the croup rerained in and had @ nov head, He added that he had
just had a requoat from Carillo to provide hi (Corillo) with a thousand
dollars; that Carillo had photographic copies of sone checks thit he had
paid.to Waldo Frank for propacanda activities ecainst Cute and that
Cartllowas asking rointureerent but kiro aatd he didn't consider he hod

to give it to Carille. H

Returning to tho budgot, Miro Said, “There are tho verio:s erployees}
there is the iter of trips; there are the military jeople grouped under
the military commisaion ~ I cannot let the. suffer Upsatde There ere no
studenta on the payroll beceuse they are being su;ndrted by you (the
Ageney). And right there a difference is eetublished between those in
the Counc!1 and those wo recoive money (ror. the Agency directly, which
4@ more then thet received by ry people, See how yau (the Agency) with=
out intending to, and for reasons of insecurity, are going to destroy
the Council,” He then stated that ho had placed Alvarez Vias, who had
boon Kiniater of Finance, in charge of finance matters because he (Miro)
could not be everywhere, and to make certain that no exienses were paid
on which they were not in egreeront, and which Paul would oarry out,

I quarried whether Paula vould evrtinue as accountant, ani Miro said,
"certainly, ag accountant." He anid that everyons has baen coring to him
(Mire) with all kinds of pleas for monay and therefore it was nocessary
to have Alvares Diaz in there so that he and Paula night resolve the finance
matvera. Miro added vorda of praise for Paulu, "It's like I want to heave
for each section of the Council, ike I wanted Conte! Aguero to handle
propaganda, but since he is receiving roney fron you (the agerey) he
doesn't want to. I have to have soreone to take this load off of re; firet
as in Naval affairs, sceone to lock for boats, arma, etc.”

I asked atout Kestre for proparanda and Miro replied that testre is
no good, never was of valus; thut he liad teen put in charce of the proca=

that Svan te stor:ad but, since they work directly, theas peoplo ore
v‘efended. He added wryly ‘that he wishod ‘thoy (the Ayer.cy) would defend
Lim (Vivo) that way.

He said thoy (the Aseney) had posed the wrotle: five zonths ago in
Viart relative to Joaquin, Jagerio, a Cuban who wa working with the
Counai2 and hae worked rognificently, but then he uecepted work with the
€.1,A. and continues doing this (aril do a vhotever he clusnen)  intele
Lyence, arra, recruiting, atc. -~ and vill have rotting to do with the
Councils °

Again Miro declored thut ke had the hiheat regard for Paulo and
couldn't deanonse with hir 5 had ‘even propowd his nare to Le the lagistrate
of the Tribural «f Accounta in tho futuro soverrmzent of Cuba, I udded
ny widerotardin: that Prslo had done an excellent Job, varticularly
sentioniny his handling of paying cerender.ta, a meticulous and arduous
task. Firo exciairod that he had never ecnsidercd replacing Paula but
corely neaded Alvarez fiuz to handle details with Paula. He anid every=

and thon people will uuk “fron. whers docs this roney ects,4 since the
Cubano have no roney,” t

Then Dr, Miro gaid he would like to clarify any doubtful questions, I
asked whether he hnd received any other eonmunication frox the Escanbray
group, He revlied thet io had rot, but that the ona had cora through the
Momteeriat’ groun ani thay cortinued toaek hi: for this are ald, I
asked whether any chany.s ore dditiongs had teen rade in the Coune!] at the
October 10th reeting. He replied that the PRP had not answered hie ine
vitation bucause they wore vorkiny with the Avency, and that the new
group, the Union Levoluctonario, had relied that they did not, tecause
they have a colognte- in vashington who 1s seeing cirect contact with
U.S. Goverrzent Agezelea,

Miro then declared that in ordor to call a Counoil recting, he had to
have @ press confererce or a présa rolense (about esliing « CRC revting)

"The fastistianos are vory well orgarized and x1s0 the Frio follovers,
waiting for re to do oorething, und I connot do anytlings I'r like St.
Lawrence, roasted on une sido and Cried on the other.”

T asked whether the Cou-oi] vas locked tron too ruch as a political
entity rather than a unifyin; nedium, Miro rerlied, "Thove people (Frio,
Alabau, ete.) want to obstruct the ones who are fightin; Castro through
the xedium of the Counes}, They arc divided into two crours: (1) i
Politictars; Prio, Alonso Pujol; thoso thit vart to te the directoray
(2) The :roupa that want to act within Cuba vho don't vant to Join CRG
but rather to deal directly wit!: you neonle in order to have the power
tomorrow tn Cuba; vecple only of action, byt sot of corzon sense and who
cannot roan ruch to the future of Cuba; aldeg would cause another era
like that of Fidel, who is rothing but a student. That‘ts extrerely
dangerous, You give these peoxle the resns and if one of them over=
throws Fidel he {s the ome vio assumes rowr, He ray be a sood ran of
action but only 24 or 25 yenrs old uni not one who can orient Cuba in
the way of derocracy, After reaching 40, reople think differently.
Fighters are capable of curry {ng cut the action you give ther to do, but
not to govern, :

Dr. Miro continued to cwell on |:1a concern ae to the future if these
young fighters are given a free hand to do as they please; that care must
be taken aa to who in sunzorted, that these people are the onea who don't
want to work with us; thet the +? hopes that it will be the ore who will
lead tororrow in Cuba; that onos of the future will be sorething te which
you the U.S, has contributed by suprorting auch clerents.

Dr. Miro corrented in further detail his views and again hx tered on
the ranner of uring funds to avoid being like the ostrich, "Everyone
knova where the roney 1s coming frot: and io hava to be carefil of the
form. Everyone doow not know of you, but of whore the help is coming
from”

"Wo are tha pulitices of the war against Castrc," affirmed Ir. Miro.
let ecilitary rar fumetion aa chief of staff os lony sa te rilitary action
against Castro continues, but then the civil action sust. be carricd out.
by nonerilitary ren,”

He added that durin: the softeniny-un action ayainst Castro, ve
rust take good care of the ranner in vhich th. «ction is taxen to avoid
exrosing the 1.S, suvort; and that he considered that the collsteral,
Ancependent grouns were not safeguarding it; so wo are losing tie now
‘ag you (U3. Avercien) deal with each, of those crouns, Arc te rust not
lose, ve rust win,



I told Lr. Viro that I uns anxious to werk cut sore ranner of linkirg
these groupe vith ir. Miro and the Council, without having to channel
direction and funce through Dr. Miro, since these groupe are now function=
ing well uncer existing arrangerents.

Dr. ¥ire #44 he vould te rlessed to meet vith ther outside of the
Council, and they ray continus to function
independently; tut tiat they realize that
Viro ad’ed treat like the independent ragistrates with their attitule —

they, are fajurtez the Council.

Dr. Firo cazented that he wanted the raziatrates to have on election
and select treir leacer according to the resusts of a vote. He reiterated
that a21 the ccllewral organisations runt operate within the orbit of tw
Council; and that be vould be glad to discuss with ther their opinions
just as he * professor had core with sturerte--often tines resulting
in excellent i2eaa end viewpoints.

Than I recticned that I hud read in one of cur magazines a laucaterz
item describing sis dexonstrated capabilities as « rediator botween
political groans end individuals. .

Dr. Hiro again returned to his belief tiat funds of all crganizatiors
should furnei through the Council because every Cuban has a sense of szell
that incléres biz to go where he knows the xoney is dispensed; thet this 1s
ead but trues and that those who are still outside and hope to get direct
suoport,jithey maw that te roney waa here (in tie hands), would core
running withost urging. He then said that ke had seven hundred collars,
more or less, for each organization's operating oxpenses. He concluded
by saying thet te dida't wich to cperate without us (Agency) or without
any of the Avency ononle, but merely desired to pull together the diverse
groups and ot:er activities, -

He then referred to his conversations with Mr, Berle and General
Taylor, ond bis view expressed to them that in the April affair he felt
that the Agency te¢ functioned more or lees effectively — soretires
their people kad teen “rough®, or "tough", but that he had no complaints
that the lack of sir cover no doubt caused defeat. When he had been
querried by reverters end other on specific uesticns designed to pry
secreta out of ciz, he had replied, "I didn't see ther," or eiriliar
evasious, and thus had endeavored to be loyal to use

He said his son had been certain that hia father would be with the
expeditionary force, and, in route to the Bay of Pigs from Guaterala
the gon bad searched for hir. on he boats, and was disillussioned because
hie Cather vasn't there. i



Again he ecphasizsed his viev that the stu‘onts sent to Latin Arerican
countries on propagands cissions should be indoctrinated by veople in the
Council to prepare thom for the eross exmining that they vould undergo,
and thereby prepare ther. against trans and foolish statertnts; and to
insure that no Batista suoporters sent out. He erphazised that one
of the first questions asked of these provaganda erissuries vould te
“hith vhat roney do you cone here?" "chat Yankeo oryanization is behind
you." He added, "The peonle have to be wll vrepared to answr; just as
T bad to undergo a succession of penetrating questions vhen T first vent
into exile in Argentina and could ansver ther without hesitation becnuse

of a clean record,

Again ho cane back to his urgurent that the collateral organizations
should function through the Council = nok "forgetting the Acency, tut not
being forsotten by the Agency." I told Dr. Miro that T honed during the
course of the week to have a serios of conversations inthe course of
Which certain decisions and solutions would te reached that vould ensble
me to sit down with hin the following seek and work out sore cetetls on
propagana and other ratters.

fr, Miro thon asked, "How best canthe occurity of this nation be
insured - the Acenoy dealing directly with those noople ur vorking with
the: through Firo7® dud he erchesized that he vas concerned toth with
the security of Cuba and of the United States, and that those people
(Cubans with whor the Ayoney {a dealing directly) at any mozent vhen
they felt they were losing out or were not sufficiently pald = would
aok for nore, and, being Cutana, right ta very indisereto; but that if
they had to deal with Miro they gould be obligated to go to hig with
their corplaints. He said that just as a deo seeking swects will go to
any source, but if there is only cne source it will go to that ones and
that thus all crouns .ust look to the Council, :

Again Dr. Miro returned to his thouia thet sooner'or luter there rust
be var to overthrow Custro, end that Cutans and Arericans rust realise
thia; that aa & preliminary the Cubsna must carry out sabotage, ates,
but just us blockades didn't overthrov Francs or Musgolint, reither would
they cause the fa11 of Cantroy further that if auborage wee conducted withe
out being @ part of an uvera:] plan of rissions, the people inaide Cubs
would cose to react adversely to the subotage and align therselves with
Castro, :

Re then exoressed hia view that tire is teing sadly wasted in trying
to bring the Latin Arericen countries into agreerent with the U.S, against
Castro, because, unortunately, rary are ruled by dictators and they fear
Concerted action against therselves, but if the U.S, attacks and destroys
Castro they vill aoplaud, ro Tepeated thst the Punta del Esto
agreerent bight well cause tany countries to say, "Thank you Fidel, and
not, thank you Pr. Kennedy,” ;

Dr. Miro emphasized that he vanted to collaborate vith ue fully, Thea

the ecoversation turned to the dissolution of the FRD by Varona, and Dre
Miro declared that this steo was difficult for-Varona, to take because he

replied, "and they shut up. i

Kiro ariéed that Varons had declared last niphl, "Let then give us
