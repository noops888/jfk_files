vag much apr ted. We vere puzzled, however, by the request for PRQ Parts I
and I on GICIZ30H~4 since all biographic ant operational cata on hin with the
exception of Zeferences and DIRECTCR 006731 is on record only at Headquarters as
fer as ve are avare unless Kexico City has retained their old file cn hin, .Fara-
greph 3 of Reference B specifically requested that pertinent material from Subject's
_ 201 be forvaried to Bogot&, but we bave never received it.

2 Errol G Jethoe.demite bs old friendship with Subject, bas no preseat
justifiable rezson to question nix regarding all the blo~
Graphic detaiis required for preparation of a full FRQ Fart 1, Nor could Lythgoe
Jogically elicit frea Sabject tht ansvere to suca PAQ Part II items as “dow, whea,
where, why and by whom Subject was first contacted or developed” by KVROCK, "List
other case officers vho have handled Subject or vhom he knows or has known..." snd
the like.

3. Subject's propesed present operational-use is detailed in Reference 5, and
Headquarters hes the rest of the besic data necessary for reparation of both parts
ofthe PRQ. It is therefore suggested that this be dons at Headquarters, with .
copies. being forvarded to Scgotf fcr updating. .
