SUBJECT : Quebec Separation Moverent

1. Iwas in Wilmington, Delaware, .on Saturday attending a
meeting of an organigati which. bélong.. One of the members
of the group, {€ yJwho-I have. known for several years,
approached me concerning information a friénd of his has on the Quebec
separation movement.

2. Forbes is a straightforward man, and he believes that the
information his friend has would be of interest to someone concerned
with ramifications of the Quebec separation group. He says that his
friend has contacts with radical members in inner circles of the group.

OF,

orbés |has suffered some sort of injury to his spine, and has :
been a semi-invalid in.recent years, so I do not know.his current
employment.status. He is a graduate of Toronto University in Canada,

and his wife is Canadian. His source was a classmate at Toronto U.,

‘a retired major now in charge of the school’s alumni program. This

alumni. work has brought him in contact with a wide range of persons,
apparently out of which has come his contacts and this information.

I gather that he does not want to tell it to official Canadians,

but seems concerned with what ‘he knows and feels that it should be reported
to someone in official U.S. circles.

os :
4. 1 told(Forbes) that I would report his willingness to speak
with Agency re vesentatives., but that I could n say that he would be
contacted. (fork can be ne as follows: O8
