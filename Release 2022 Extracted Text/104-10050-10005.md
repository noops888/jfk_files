Subject: Background on iexico Station Support Assets
(Coverage of Soviet and Cuban Enbassies)

1. Unilateral coverage. From the time the viexico Station vas opened in
April 1947 (by Bill Doyle) until arrival of Win Scott as COS in 1958, Charles
Anderson III (still in LA/HQ) had developed a surport apparatus to aR
exploit leads from the Soviet Embassy, This umbrella type project (LIFEAT)
consisted of milti line phone taps, three photo sites, a mobile surveillance
team and a mail intercept operation,

a. Fhone taps were placed by an employee of the telephone company

nates ok we Ria le,
who was hendled by Davia WILSTED (pseudo). The number of lines
tapped wes limted at availability of a Matentng eet nearby

(ehich 2 that tine felt was good security in that

b. Three photo sites were handled by Anderson with the kelp
of Harry Mahoney (retired, living in Chicago) end TDY TSD
people checking the best type of camera, film, and concealment
devices. These had sub-cripts under LIFEAT (LIMITED, LILYRIC,
and LICALLA). LIMITED was a fixed site bang opposite across
the street fron the front gate of the Soviet Enbassy which had
both a vehicle and foot entrance. The Soviet gate'was on the

Northiiest corner.of their compound and LIMITED was diagonally

for a long term lease on the top floor of a new apartment blding to te built
on this site). LILYRIC was plenned es an alternate photo base to LIMITED,

It was in an upper storey (3rd floor -check) on the same side of the street
as LEATED but in the middle of the block South. It had a slantéd view of

the front gate of the Soviet Znbassy, The agents in LIMITED and LILYRIC (both

Mexican families) as far as we knew, were not acquainted with each other.

LILERIG was a rented apartzent, LICALLA, the third phgbs. §ite,) was located

in one of @ row of four houses on the South, a yk the Soviet Exbassy compound

was for LICALLA film to ve processed, iasic Sen fron 1957 to 1959 (Harper
Bolt - resigned) could not handle the volume end as the unprocessed film began

to accumilate, the inside CO (i‘ahoney) became disgusted and took the film out

for Ranon's brother-in-law to process (probatly early 1959). Thus Ranon becane

2. Liaison coverage was unreliable and insecure as characterized by the nature

of the

Mexican President elect, Adolfo Lopex Mateos. During this period, the U.S.
Anbassador Robert C. Hill (reflecting the policy of then Sec State J.F. Dulles)

was energetic in organizing groups to “fight cormunism". One of these seeds

grew into a proposal Miguel Aleman (jr. son of forner

iexi President), acting

for Lorez ‘Mateos, made to Win Scott for a joint telephone tap operation. This

project (LIZNYOY) went through about four distressing years of a shakedown,
The Mexican in control (LIELEGANT) was inexperienced, old, and greedy. His

3. My menory is a little vague about the origins of the Cuban Enbassy but I

think the staff first developed from a pro-Castro group celebrating on New

Years eve 1959. As I recall, it was a xakeshift arrangerent of volunteers

through most of 1960 and €1 with Tom Hazlitt producing voluminous reports on
their activities and recruiticg agents right and left exong Cuban nationals in
Mexico City.

4. Personnel assignments. Of interest to us now is who was in Mexico during

Warren Commission. To deter-tine wro vas there and what they vere doing I

About nid 1962 (check date) LIF!YOY outside Mexi rept asked
for the telephone nunbvers of the Soviet, Cuban, and Satellite Exbassies.

With this forevarning, LIFEAT (unileteral coverage) wes disconnected. Fowever,

as I recail, the Mexicans connected 5 Cubon lines, 5 Soviet lines, 3 Czech,

2 Polish, and 1 Yugoslev line, The basekouse listening post had a live
—

monitor who mede short summaries of

teresting conversations for a daily
resume vhich vas received each day arourd 8 a.n. (passed by Flick to Goodgasture
to get to Scott vefore 9 a.m.) Later (when the reel was completely recorded)
full transcripts were typed and passed to the station in the same way, however,
there was usually a time lag of a day or so, Those transcripts which had
Russien or another languege besides Ssenish or English vent out of the listening

post the day after the transcript (of other conversations .ett Byrearss

typed. These reels were taken to another docat jaan there

end typed. In the case of the Husotag. bigs ns Boris Taresoff usually ren
about a week behind the sagan Bh goeriion because of the volume of

_ Russian conversations ag BS atbers of the Soviet Exbassy. During this
period (fall of 1963).the reels were probably being brought into the station
and carried to Boris by one of the people from the Soviet Section or they nay
have been carried to him by Flick but I think I brought the reel in and gave
it to Herbert Manel to take to Boris, Herbert Henell and his wife Berbera
handled ell of the processi:g of Soviet transcripts. My job involved screening
the photographs as soon es we learned thet the man calling hinself Oswald was
probably an Ariericen, However, here again there was a backlag because the
photos were picked up three tines a week but the ones picked up were usually
for dates a few days previously because the doctor processed the film ona
night time basis. Photographs were made usually until one roll vas used but
later we got it changed to one day coverage on each roll - in other words the

operators’ cleared the ci

ra each day whether there vas anyngiinxnxgas a full

roll of film exposed. Instructions were to cover office hours, photograrh each

I am certain thet the Osvald call cane to our attention from the
Soviet line. It was picked uz end taken to Boris for a transletion because
the caller was trying to speak Russian. Any delay ves caused by waiting to
