am not too far off in what I am about to tell you. The contract|
was structured in such,a way ithat as the bottoms of other
companies became obsolete, they could only be replaced with
Onassis' tankers. _Even ARAMCO had to, by attrition, within a
period of four-and-a-half to five-and-a-half years, would have,
if their tankers became obsolete, they could only be replaced

by Onassis tankers.

Our statistics, after having studied the contract and
making what we considered to be proper projections, indicated
that at the completion of approximately five-and-a-half veares
Mr. Onassis would control more dead weight tonnage than the
United States controlled in its entirety, that he would control
on the high seas annually more oil by tens of thousands of
gallons more than were used by all of the Allied nations during
the most severe year of the Korean War, that in the first year
his profit would be approximately $17 million dollars, that
after five-and-a-half years his annual profit would be in the
area of $200 million.

While this analysis is going on, we also found that a

million dollar pay-off had been made to one of the top ministers

in Saudi Arabia and we had the evidence | _

Mr. Maheu. -=- of the Uhited States, and within a matter,
I believe, of forty-eight hours, our State Department
denounced the agreement. It was the first time that anyone
had actually seen what this meant, and frankly, there was an
innate fear that with the initial $17 million, then there would
be no way of stopping, I mean, he might go to Venezuela and
do the same thing, and there were also other inputs about the
background of Mr. Onassis that I would just as soon not make
a matter of record, but they were not too favorable, that we
presented to the - National Security Council verbally but not
in writing.

Mr. Madigan. Who made the presentation?

Senator Schweiker. What subsequently happened then with
the Security council denunciation, et cetera?

Mr. Madigan. The State Department denounced the agreement

and that same evening we were told that two

officials were on their way to Saudi Arabia.

Then I proceeded to dig up the gentleman by the name of
Carl Twitchell by virtue of reading about the country, because
I'm not about ready to go there and not know about the customs
and the formation of the country. I dug up a man by the name

of Carl Twitchell who was living in Connecticut who turned out

to be the first American who had ever really been accepted by

old King Saud. Pieanccioe Sey had spent time in the country
as a mining engineer to help them in the exploitation of
mines. It was in fact to chee Rwittehell>that the old king gave
the power of attorney to come to the United States government
or come back to the United States and try to form a consortium
for the exploitation of oil from which emanated ARAMCO.

Eo the type of man who was only reimbursed for his

expenses. I think his total expenses were slightly in excess
of $8,000. He didn't even keep the banking and percentage

for himself, or a piece of the action, so to speak, and he was
highly, highly loved by the Saudis and although the old king

was then gone and King Saud, the son,. was in power, Mr¥

gusecher? had the same respect and reverence from the present
leaders as he did from the father and I convinced MED ASST

that -- he already had a clearance, a satisfactory clearance,
and I convinced him to precede me to Saudi Arabia to try to
lay the groundwork.

Senator Schweiker. What year was this, roughly?

Mr. Maheu. This, I believe, was in '54 or '55, yes.

Anyway, I finally ended up going to Saudi Arabia, having
a Meeting with the King's confidential assistant, presenting al]
of this evidence, frankly at the time not knowing if the King
himself had a piece of the action --

Senator Huddleston. Had some of this evidence come from

the wiretap?

Mr. Maheu. That tap was entirely unproductive, entirely
unproductive.

Senator Schweiker. What happened then at your meeting?

Mr. Maheu. Well, it's very interesting, if we could take
a little time, I mean, I was scheduled to have the meeting
“with the King," but he doesn't show, he stays somewhere else
and the confidential assistant shows up and one trusted
minister that he had with Coen present.

And my meeting was scheduled for 8:00 p.m. one night, and
this happaned to be the last day that the King was supposed to
be in Jidda, he was then leaving for the capital further
inland, Jidda being the only major port in Saudi where he
spends his summers, and they were having a big parade for him,
and from the balcony of the hotel, I'm watching the parade go
by, and finally the King's car comes and he is arm and arm with
the: nan on whom I'm going to give the evidence that night, and
I frankly was not too comfortable, particularly in view of the
fact that in those days -- and I don't know whether it has
changed, but in Saudi, the same document did not give you
permission to enter and leave; you had to make application for
an exit visa after you arrived, and I was in constant contact
with the then-United States Ambassador. He made it very clear
that the government approved of everything I was doing, but if
something went wrong they could not come to my rescue, I would

have to be the fall guy, and I was prepared to do it. That was

Saudi Arabian government would have its flag flying the high

fl
seas, and at the time that all of this is going on they are
building what then, upon completion of production, had been
the biggest tanker in the world at that time, a ship named
after the old King, a tanker which was scheduled to go and take
a maiden flight and take off, and it turned out the biggest
problem that we had was to find a save-face gimmick. But
finally the whole thing was accomplished, and it took two and
a half years to do it.

Senator Schweiker. I didn't mean to get you off the
track.

Mr. Maheu. Well, I'm sorry I am so verhose.

Senator Huddleston. You said you bought a paper in
Athens? You mean by that you actually bought the paper or just
paid them to run the story?

Mr. Maheu. We bought a newspaper.

You'll have to understand, Senator, that in Rome, in those
days, there were fifty newspapers. I mean, the big circulation
in those days, ‘big circulation in Rome was 20,000. It's hard

for us to visualize that.

Mr. Maheu. That name is familiar, yes, now that you
mention it.

Mr. Madigan. Do you think SeeBiight have been the person?

Mr. Maheu. I think’ might have been, yes.

Mr. Madigan. Did you contact Howard Hughes with regard
to that assignment?

Mr. Maheu. No, I did not. However, Mr. Bautzer was, in
those days, Mr. Hughes’ personal.attorney.

Mr. Madigan. Would you date thatgp signment as

being around 1959?

Mr. Mahsu. I don't recall. It was before 1960, but that
would sound approximately right.

Mr. Madigan. Did you ever have your office in Washington
used for cover purposes by the CIA?

Mr. Maheu. Yes, I have.

Mr. Madigan. Do you know on how many occasions?

Mr. Maheu. On several occasions.

Mr. Madigan. Do you know what the purpose of the agent
that would be using it for cover was? -

Mr. Maheu. My racollection is that my rola was limited
simply to fund their income. In other words, they would be on
the payroll of Robert A. Maheu Associates and that I would be
reimbursed the exact amount of their pavroll.

As to the specific assignments, I have no recollection.

Mr. Madigan. During the 1969's did you employ. a fellow

Mr. Maheu. I believe that from time to time a Jack
Buckley did work for Robert A. Maheu Associates. I don't
believe he was an employee.

Mr. Madigan. Would he be on a kind of an intermittent
contract basis like Frank was? You would use him every once in
awhile?

Mr. Maheu. My recollection is that he did some work for
Robert A. Maheu Associates and, as I say, not an employee.

Mr. Madigan. Do you know what types of assignments he

being involved -- or at least I think we discussed it -- in any

Hughes. I believe it was in September of 1969 that I finally
called Mr. Meier in and requested his resignation and then

I informed Mr. Hughes that he had resigned.

After the departure of Mr. Meier, while going through his
files, Mr. Ellson ran into soms documents that indicated some
very serious double escrows on mining properties and we
recommended to Mr. Hughes that all the information be made
available to the authorities and let the chips fall where they
may.

Mr. Liebengood. Do you know why Mr. Hughes was not inclind
to follow your recommendations with regards to Meier's termina-
tion at earlier dates?

Mr. Maheu. He was afraid that Meier would embarrass him.
At least, that is what he told me.

Mr. Liebengood. You are aware of no CIA interest in
Meier?

Mr. Maheu. The only thing I know is that Meier was cut

in on the cover and was aware of

that operation.

Mr. Liebengood. How did that come about? How was he
cut in on that?

Mr. Maheu. Because it was he wha initially had worked on

a deal for a venture in Mexico on the part of Hughes Aircraft

collapsed, the person who was to be the partner of Hughes
Aircraft in that particular venture threatened to sue Howard
Hughes and all of the Hughes interest for non-fulfillment of
contract, and I made a recommendation to that person whose
name slips my mind, but I believe his last name was Jamie,
J-a-m-i-e or something like that, I don't recall. But to try
to discourage him from filing such a lawsuit I suggested that
he and I put up $10,000 in Bega and check into the
possibility of developing business there.

I put up my ten, he never put his up, and Msiar was the
one who was involved. But when the Agency needed a cover for

Meier was made privy of this by the

Mr. Liebengood. Just to be certain I understand, this
was because of Meier's role in reestablishing the operation

Is that correct?

Mr. Maheu. Well, of trying to save the lawsuit, yes.
That's right.

Mr. Liebengood. And you think the name of this would-be
partner was Jamie?

Mr. Maheu. I don't remember whether that was the first

name or last name.

Mr. Liebengood. How did [Raine whatever way do you
spell his last name, do you recall?

Mr. Liebengood. As far as you know, they had nothing to
do with any Agency interest in that?

Mr. Maheu. No, sir, not as far as I know.

As a matter of fact, it's my recollection I found out
about this afterwards.

Mr. Liebengood. Who else was witting of the cover
arrangements that you had with the Agency through Robert A.

one. Did you have other employees who were witting of the
