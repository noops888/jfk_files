INTERVIEW AND MEETING wn CrERET Page (of A

Papich began with a brief summary of his experi-
ence in the FBI. During World War II and there-
after he ran certain operations in Latin America.

In 1945-47, he ran counterintelligence operations

in Brazil against the Communist Party of Brazil

and bloc intelligence agents. In 1952 he became

FBI liaison with CIA charged with coordinating

and planning, including the development of sources.
He also had special assignments overseas for Hoover.

Papich presented the following overview of the
issues. He has a high respect and regard for the

Soviet intelligence service, its efficiency, andg@
effectiveness. He must be shown that their

philosophy has changed since 1970. The p, gt
intelligence community re

premises were false. Papie ed "they've taken
us to the cleaners in the las® few years". There
is no estimate of how many Soviet illegals are in
the United States. The old view was that illegals
would aim at middle-class government and business
positions. It has been discovered that they take
jobs like dishwasher to develop an employment
background. There is no knowledge of Soviet
objectives. Illegals may do nothing for years so
they can be tapped for the future. There may be
100, 500, or 5,000 of them. Some were sent in as
early as the 20's and 30's. They are the Rudolph
Abel-type. His network was never identified.
Therefore, Papich is clearly unhappy with U. S.
results in identifying Soviet operations in the
United States.

Papich stated that he played a controversial

“devil's advocate" role between the FBI and the
CIA. He did not confer with Attorney General
Mitchell after Helms called his name to Mitchell's
attention. Papich assumes Helms wanted Mitchell
to get a review of the history of FBI-CIA relations.
Papich would not have gone to Mitchell without
checking with-other FBI officials.

the foreign intelligence field in World War II.
Overnight the FBI had to generate the capability

to move into Latin America against the German
espionage operation which included business covers,
padio networks, and influence in Latin American
governments. The FBI had no precedent or guidance.
Assistant FBI Director Hugh Klegs conferred with
the British in London for assistance. FBI agents
went into Latin America first under pusiness covers,

In 1943-45, the government began looking toward
a worldwide intelligence system. The alternatives
were the military, OSS, State, and FBI. FDR
allegedly assured Hoover that he would be respon-
sible for setting up the post-war system. Papich
never saw any documents showing that Hoover wanted
this job. The Latin American operation was
successful but Hoover never understood or had a
feel for the problems. He felt insecure. He never
traveled outside the U. S., and only saw things
from Washington, D. C.

Under President Truman, Hoover did not have a
"warm" relationship with the President. When the

U. S., for instance, if Hoover had a problem with

a police chief, he just cut off relations. He
couldn't do that with foreign police. A foreign
intelligence service cannot operate like a domestic
intelligence agency.

In 1952, when Papich became FBI-CIA liaison, rela-
tionships between the agencies were a mess. Beedle
Smith was CIA director. There were many flaps
between FBI and CIA over CIA political and psycho-
logical warfare, especially regarding the funding
of labor groups, student groups, and political
parties. At the time of the 1947 Act, these tech-
niques of "covert action" were the subject of
tremendously heated battles between CIA and State.
There were fewer flaps in the counterintelligence
field.

In the field of political and psychological warfare
operations, the CIA didn't want stereotyped people.
The CIA was not disciplined and ignored jurisdictional
agreements. It would contact a U. S. newsman about a

the FBI to ask what was going on, this would go
to Hoover, who would raise hell with the CIA
director. But Beedle Smith was tough. Communi-
cation between the FBI and CIA was almost non-
existent by 1952.

Papich had no CIA counterpart since the CIA is

so compartmented. He had contacts at all levels,
exchanging ideas for operations. He would push
CIA ideas in the FBI. Flaps would come up. He
would stamp them out and say "get on with the job".

reasons for doing what he did. He had his own
conversations and contacts in the White House,
Congress, and his personal sources. He knew what
he was doing and had "a nose and ear for the
political climate in Washington". This was true
for "risky" operations.

Papich believes it would be disastrous to give
both foreign and domestic intelligence duties to
a CIA. While there would be advantages in
coordinating fragmented sources, it is a risk to
liberty, like a national police.

Papich did not recall any significant plan to
improve coordination in 1958 when FBI joined USIB.
FBI was part of the USIB predecessor group.

The CIA would suggest joint field operations but
Hoover would rarely buy it. This was like his

reluctance to join any operation with any other
agencies. He thought the FBI should always have

In summary, the sources of Mriction were

more than three to six instances of disagreement.
The FBI never helped the CIA create an organization
for deep cover. It never needed FBI help because
it moved on its own. The CIA Office of Security
advised Papich that they had a relationship with
“the National Student Association. This never gave
the FBI a problem.

The Katzenbach report would not give the FBI prob-
lems but many good CIA contacts overseas went down
the drain when contacts through student groups were
curtailed. Papich believes that if these contacts

very little. The immediate problem was the pro-
posal for a joint approach. When Papich was there,
it got no further than discussion. If the CIA did
set up cover in the U. S., the FBI provided no
support. However, if the CIA desired to use a

Regarding FBI service and support to other agencies,
Hoover was "goddamned careful". He was sensitive
to any "risks" and thus any request for FBI support
had to be established firmly. Hoover never
responded "let them do it" within the United

INTERVIEW AND MEETING SUMMARY

Regarding the CIA and domestic dissidents, in

the 50's the CIA's general attitude was not to
investigate or surveil Americans overseas, FBI-
CIA communications rarely involved U. S. citizen
targets unless they clearly involved a KGB agent.
In the 1960's, Papich recalls two early incidents
of FBI requests for CIA coverage overseas. One
was the Republic of New Africa, a black group
with contacts with Communists and foreign radicals
(note by Elliff -- the individual was Robert
Williams?). The second was Stokely Carmichael, who
traveled around the world. The FBI asked the CIA
for coverage of Carmichael's contacts overseas

but there were no results since the'CIA had no
capability. In retrospect, Papich thinks his
importance was exaggerated.

Papich does not recall any case or interest of the
CIA regarding Dr. King. The FBI levied no requests
on the CIA regarding Dr. King. Papich recall

was not a CIA priority. CIA was satisfied with FBI
coverage of the Communist Party. If the KGB was
using it for espionage or influence, the FBI would
uncover it. The FBI would inform CIA of CPUSA
activities. Regarding CPUSA, FBI determined that
there was Soviet financial support into the 1960's
The FBI attitude as early as the 50's was that the
CIA did not have the capability to discover CPUSA
links to the Soviet Union. There were no leads for
the CIA to explore in France, Czechoslovakia, etc.
If a Communist Party member went to Rome or London,
then FBI would ask CIA coverage, but the CIA gave
it low priority and produced little. This led to
FBI dissatisfaction with CIA, so FBI went through
its legal attaches, who would contact foreign
security services. Normally, the CIA was informed
but sometimes the CIA was not notified if the FBI
called it "an internal security" matter. Papich

ference between "internal security" and "counter-—

Regarding the legal attaches, Papich was in Rio
de Janerio after World War II. The FBI had moved
out when the CIA moved in, but Hoover wanted to
have someone there anyway. Papich stayed a year

When the legal attache asks a foreign intelligence
service for coverage of an FBI target, it asks for
any information rather than specifying the data.

Papich recalls beginning to request CIA coverage
of New Left travel abroad about 1967. He does not

Papich did not know of the 1967 White House request
to CIA nor did he know when Ober's unit was set up.
He had no discussion with Ober on setting up his

unit but he did know of its existence after it was
established. The FBI was asking CIA about particular

The accepted view at CIA was that it was impor-
tant to determine if there was foreign support or
sabotage training. After 1967, FBI-CIA contacts
on this topic developed rapidly. There were few
really valuable CIA results nor was much obtained
through the FBI, the legal attaches, or informants
going abroad.

Papich referred to the climate of press commentary,
assassinations, allegations of sabotage plans, and
bombings. There was "a potential for panic within

the intelligence community" since no one had the
coverage they thought they needed. Travel of U.S.
antiwar leaders to Communist nations seemed impor-
tant, although sometimes after inquiry the individuals
were found not to be important. Therefore, time was
spent on targets who should not have been targets

but this was a new task.

Hoover did not understand the issue. He thought
New Left CPUSA links were most important. Papich
_ never thought the CPUSA responsible for development
@ of the New Left or SDS. CPUSA did try to use the
New Left. Hoover assumed the Soviets controlled \
CPUSA day to day. Some of his assumptions had
been proved wrong. In World War II days, yes,
the Soviets used CPUSA for recruitment. [In the
late 40's and 50's, the Soviets changed their
policy, no longer using CPUSA for this purpose.
Hoover was never convinced of this change. Papich
recognized the possibility that there might be a
reversal of Soviet policy regarding CPUSA but

INTERVIEW AND MEETING SUMMARY

Papich had no personal involvement with White
House requests. There was discussion both in the
FBI and between CIA and FBI on expanding coverage
and development of sources. For example, does
CIA have anybody who can have an entree into SDS?
The Katzenbach report had limited the CIA to
foreign sources or to U. S. students recruited
abroad. Papich dealt mainly with Ober on this,
but also with Angleton and Tom Karamenses (DDP).
Papich believes anything Ober said and did

of what Oswald did in the Soviet Union. Did he
get any guidance? Why did they permit him to
leave? Papich had frequent discussions with
Dulles and the CIA regarding the Warren Commission
although he thinks the formal FBI liaison was Jim
Malloy. The question as to whether Oswald was a

U. S. intelligence asset never arose. Critics at
the time said the FBI should have surveilled
Oswald. Papich recalls discussions of a plan to
have a CIA or FBI man defect to Moscow but no such
plan was ever implemented to his knowledge. It was
not worth the risk. He does not know whether the
CIA did it. He stresses that the FBI was not likely
to use "nuts".

Regarding the Riha incident, Papich says this was
not the reason for his retirement. Instead, there
were problems with Hoover on operations and policy
decisions. Pa A 1S} an aggressive stand

Hoover would agree to expand on certain issues

but proposals for major new operations went to
PFIAB for support. Clifford was chairman. Papich
doesn't know what Hoover said to Clifford, but the

When Papich lectured to CIA recruits he attempted
to orient CIA to the FBI's limits. On the other
hand, FBI did not understand CIA functions abroad.

Returning to the Riha incident, Papich stressed
that he clashed with Hoover every year and that
@ their relationship had declined steadily after

1966. By fall of '69, he saw his value as nil.
In December '69, he decided to retire the follow-
ing.spring. In February 1970, while winding up
his normal business, the Riha incident arose.
Professor Riha disappeared from the university.
There was faculty and press interest in Boulder,
Colorado, and a Congressional inquiry came to FBI.
But FBI opened no case or- investigation. In March
of 1970 the president of the University of Colorado
came to a CIA man in domestic contact service in
Boulder to inquire about the disappearance. The
CIA man called two friends in the Denver FBI office.
FBI agent agreed to contact Denver police and dis-
covered that marital problems had led to the dis-
appearance. CIA man told the university president
what he learned from "reliable government sources".
The president told the press. The local district
attorney called the president and asked his source.
The president went back to his CIA source. The CIA
source then promptly contacted the CIA officer in
Denver, who contacted the Denver FBI SAC. The CIA
officer suggested that he and the SAC go to the
district attorney to say that the original source

@ was local police, but the SAC rejected the idea and

INTERVIEW AND MEETING SUMMARY

wanted to know the identity of the FBI agent

who gave the information. The CIA officer
refused and there was a bitter clash. (Things
like this had happened in the past. FBI field
agents had contacted Papich and Papich had always
told them to get on with the job.) The SAC sent
a teletype to Hoover. Hoover said to Papich, go
to Helms and get the identity of the FBI sourge.
Helms called in the CIA man, who refused tgp
identify him. Helms sent Hoover a lettag
this and said he was "taking the
trative action". Hoover noted o "“dis-
continue liaison with CIA". . é

Papich then wrote a long
Hoover instead of his O%&
note. He strongly appg®@ o Hoover to reconsider
and keep communications oBen. He also raised
serious questions concerning Hoover's past decisions.
Hoover was not happy. Papich says there had been

“ dozens of incidents like this before. He did not
confer with anyone in the FBI about his letter.

@ W. C. Sullivan was angry with Papich for stirring
things up. (Papich says if it is OK with the FBI
it's OK with him for the Committee to get the
letter, although he considers it personal to Hoover.
The letter reviews FBI-CIA relations.)

Regarding the CIA and cal police, the only thing
Papich recalls is discussion of the CIA's relation-
ship with New York City police. The purpose was
not operations, but protection of CIA New York
facilities. He was also aware of relationships
between Washington, D. C., and suburban police for
protection of CIA facilities and personnel. He
knew that some CIA employees joined questionable
groups and that the CIA was concerned about its
personnel associating with radicals and protesters.
The CIA Office of Security informed the FBI in
1967-1970 that it had developed from two to six
sources to assess involvement of CIA personnel in
protest groups. The information provided to the
FBI from these sources about such groups was "crap".
Papich was not involved in any meetings with CIA
sources. He is not aware of any CIA activity re-
garding Women's Strike for Peace, nor was he aware
of any CIA intelligence operations for the purpose
of protecting CIA from violent demonstrations.

CIA should have relied on FBI.

Bill Creager was succeeded as liaison with Office
of Security by Fred Cassidy. They provided memo-
randa to the FBI Intelligence Division on all trans-
actions with CIA. Creager kept Papich advised,
especially of the potential for flaps and for
successful operations. Papich believes Office of
Security was restricted both in number of personnel
and by CIA rules. It could claim a need to protect
its own facilities and personnel but it didn't

have significant capability. If it did, it would
have been detected by the FBI.

Regarding the Dominican Republic in 1965, Papich
recalls the fear of another Cuba by the President
and the National Security Council. Johnson may
have asked the FBI for help. An FBI agent from
the office in San Juan, Puerto Rico, and possibly
from Mexico City, were sent to the Dominican
Republic. This was done with CIA approval and the
joint effort was successful. There were no flaps.
The FBI agent had sources all over Central America
going back to World War II. Other FBI activities
in the Caribbean grew out of the FBI's role in
Havana before Castro, Jamaica, Miami, and San Juan.
In all these areas the FBI's capability was based

on personal relationships going back to World
War II. In the late 1960's, the FBI went into
El Salvador and Papich thought this was a waste
of FBI manpower.

Regarding Cubans in Miami, there were many flaps
with CIA. For example, CIA would attempt to .
recruit an exile for an operation in Cuba, the
exile would ask the FBI about it, and Hoover would
get mad. The FBI would not be informed about CIA
cover companies screening exiles. The FBI investi-
gated one cover company until it discovered the
CIA cover. CIA tried to recruit FBI sources with-
out checking out FBI. Papich is sure CIA “must
have" used agents to cover local Miami Cubans.
But FBI had excellent coverage and would protest
when CIA took an interest in somebody FBI was
investigating. There would be general protests
to CIA to stay out of counterintelligence. Some

oma Regarding CIA counterintelligence against Cubans
in New York, Papich said the policy was no
counterintelligence by CIA. He has no recollection
of CIA implication in anti-Castro Cuban illegal
activities, but Papich admits he would have learned
only if there was a flap.

Regarding CIA Domestic Operations Division, Papich
formulated the 1966 agreement to ease FBI relation-
ships. The problem, as noted earlier, was CIA

Domestic Operations Division attempted to recruit
and failed to advise FBI. If CIA was interested
in a Soviet bloc intelligence service recruitment,
FBI said no. If either Domestic Operations Division
or the counterintelligence staff was interested in
any Soviet in the U. S., they touched base with FBI.
@ But they felt that if FBI had allowed them to
recruit they could have succeeded.

Regarding CIA Domestic Contact Service, FBI would
get positive intelligence reports, for example,

on an alien coming to the United States. The FBI
was interested in his training in Russia as a
possible source regarding Soviet intelligence
activities. The CIA Domestic Contact Service would
provide reports to FBI headquarters or the field

on antiwar, Black Power, and protest groups. They
got the information from faculty and students regard-
ing future riots.

The Domestic Contact Service programs and priorities
were set by the intelligence community, for
example, gather whatever they can about missiles.
The FBI would not task DCS. If DCS went into opera-
tions, FBI itself was upset. But DCS had good
officers who would note potential for counter-
intelligence use. There was no increase in DCS
traffic regarding dissidents in 1967 to 1969.

The creation of DCS in 1947 worried Hoover, who
feared an internal security role. It was set up
by NSCID. Until the 1960's, there was no contact
between FBI and the DCS at the fieid level. The
procedure developed that if DCS wanted to interview

an alien, a form was submitted by FBI.
got FBI data on the alien and FBI had notice so
it could protect any operation.

Regarding possible spies in foreign intelligence
agencies, if the FBI discovers any it evaluates

the potential for a double agent or the possibility
of recruitment. FBI usually goes to the agency and
tells them the situation to prevent access to
sensitive information. Also, the agency can give
FBI assistance. The CIA Office of Security is
"paranoid" on this subject. It is very concerned
if there is a report on a CIA employee associating
with bloc nationals. Before telling the FBI, it
would do as much as it could on its own so there
would be something to discuss. In one case the

CIA was absolutely convinced an employee was a spy,
predicated on its analysts’ conclusions from a
photograph. FBI refused to move on the basis of
this alone. There were other cases where FBI and
CIA had different evaluations of evidence. It
depended on what CIA gave FBI. CIA was "jumpier"

@ than FBI.

If CIA did any electronic surveillance of its own
employees, it never checked with FBI. The same was
true for physical surveillance of its own employees.
If the FBI had known, it would have raised hell,

but it never came to FBI attention and there was

no policy discussion of the subject. If the CIA
wanted to do something with its own assets with
Attorney General or White House approval, it would
not check with FBI. But it would coordinate with
FBI if it saw a risk that FBI would discover.

Papich recalls no CIA surveillance of newsmen.
Papich adds his view that every newsman assigned
to Moscow is useful to the KGB. A newman who may
have been recruited by KGB in Moscow may become a
target in the U. S.

Papich did not recall any problem of CIA activity
"tainting" a criminal case. CIA would make sources
s available for criminal prosecutions.

Regarding CIA Far East Division, Papich recalls
proposals for developing cover in the U. S. for
going overseas. Ober advised Papich of the develop-
ment of sources in the U. S. to cover overseas
targets. Papich would write a memo on the situa-
tion and provide any relevant FBI information. He
also discussed with Ober giving FBI assets to CIA
if they travel overseas. Papich stresses that FBI
sources are sent overseas. He encouraged working
through CIA but never got very far. Papich gives
the example of an FBI source who went to Italy and
reported back through CIA.

Ober asked FBI to use its sources to gather
information on policy guidance, funding, and train-
ing of U. S. dissidents overseas. There was a large
volume of communication covering names like
Carmichael and leaders in domestic groups.

FBI told CIA that if there was ever an investiga-
tion regarding a possible U. S. crime, CIA must
recognize the evidentiary rules. If there were
prosecutions (very few), it was never necessary to

@ disclose CIA data. CIA sources were not in a
position to testify. Papich does not recall ask-
ing CIA if information sent to FBI from CIA might
have originated with electronic surveillance over-
seas.

any

If Ober gave FBI information regarding domestic
matters, FBI would ask for everything CIA knew

about the sources. CIA memos would be very brief
Papich would insist on identification of the
sources, since the FBI might want to use it. FBI
did get access to sources, sometimes working through
a CIA intermediary if source would not talk to FBI.

Regarding the several million dollar fund transfer
to FBI, Papich recalls this was an effort of the
g entire intelligence community, including the White

istance where TSD provided documents to FBI and
he has no knowledge of any COINTELPRO-type use of
CIA alias documentation or other document forging.
If this had been done, it would have had to go
through Papich.

Papich knew nothing about Vesco.

On Ober memgs to EBL, Papich recalls a code &
designati {he purpose was so 8) ) se
that when came “wack to CIA from FBI
it could be sent directly to Ober. The counter-
intelligence staff had an office to log communica-
tions. The determination as to what FBI informa-
tion would go to Ober was first based on Ober's
@ request for specifics and second based on FBI
criteria which considered whether there would be
any possible CIA results. FBI would alert Ober
regarding an individual and ask for any informa-
tion generally about his overseas activity.

Papich does not recall any CIA breaking and enter-
ing operations in the 1960's.

Regarding CIA security research staff, Papich
recalled that it concentrated on developing counter-
intelligence equipment. It also was "an Angleton-
type" operation, doing research on penetration of
the CIA. It also analyzed and evaluated the
exposure to the agency of OSS personnel who might
have been Communists or have had World War II
Communist contacts. For example, in Germany until
the mid-50's, CIA was vulnerable to recruitment

by Communist intelligence. CIA brought in brilliant
minds who might still have strong identification
with their home countries in eastern and middle
Europe.

Finally, Papich and Creager felt that "the guts of
liaison" was with DDP on counterintelligence, not
on their internal security problems. With Office
of Security there was a small number of investiga-
tions overlapping FBI.
