TERMINATION SECRECY AGREEMENT

CLASSIFIED SENSITIVE COMPARTMENTED INFORMATION'

1.

I acknowledge that, by viture of my duties, I have received or been exposed

to classified sensitive compartmented information, the unauthorized disclosure or

negligent handling of which could adversely affect the interests of the United States

Government. I am aware that the unauthorized disclosure of classified information is

prohibited by the Espionage Laws (Title 18, U. S. Code, Sections 792-798) and the In-

ternal Security Act of 1950, Section 19, P. L. 831, (81st Congress) and that a viola-

tion of these laws may subject me to prosecution by the U. S. Government.

2.

I hereby reaffirm my pledge that I will never publish or reveal by any means

classified sensitive compartmented information.

nor will I ever, possess any right, interest,

title or claim whatsoever to such infor-

mation.

I recognize the full and vested property right of the United States in such

matters.

3. I certify that I have surrendered and no longer have in my possession or

custody any classified compartmented information or material acquired as a result of

this association.

4: I further acknowledge and agree that I have a continuing individual respon-

sibility to the United States Government for the protection of classified sensitive

compartmented information and that the termination from this relationship with my em-

ployer and/or the United States Government does not relieve me of my obligations under

this agreement or any other previously executed Secrecy Agreements. I understand that

I will not be relieved of these obligations except when specifically advised in writing

by the sponsoring activity of the U. S. Government.

5. I understand that this document may be retained by the U. S. Government for

its future use in any manner within the scope of this agreement.
