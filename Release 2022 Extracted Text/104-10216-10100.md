relative to the Davideon matter. Ainsley read the Washington FO memo ‘
a. Per instructions from Mr. Colby, the CIA is
major responsibility for procuring Soviet, Bloc, and

SUBJECT: 1. Irving Davidson .: —

ce. In view of this fact, Morgen offered the opinion “4
that froa a logistical point of view it would be advantageous :
.to purchase the entire 25 million rounda from Davidson (at i
@ cost he estimated to be in the range of $3,125,000.00). }
‘This would provide the Agency with a five-year supply and |
eliminate the necessity for Alusley running the security i

4

gauntlet every few months to replenish the fnventory.

4. Nevertheless, because of Davidson's unsavory
Feputation and his close connection vith columist Jack
anderson, it was generally agreed that hiu utilizstion }
would be risky in the extrees.

2. Afneley encoosted that we run the probles by his bees, ?
Michal Malanick, Chief, Office of Logistics. Accordingly we net with f
Melanick and his Deputy, Janes KeDonald. After a thorough rehash of the
matter, it was agreed that: q

e@. Morgen will confer with SOG and deteraine
the feasibility of. taking the entire 25 nillion rounds.

b. Ainsley end Morgen vill check with their
legitinste ares dealers and see if any of then have
ever heard of Davideon. If so, one of them will
epproach hin and ask (innocently) if he knows of
eay 7.62 amo available.

€. There is also 2 possibility that one of
Afneley's regular contects might have some ides as
to vho Davidson's source is. In that case the source
will be approached directly aod Davideon will be cut
out of the pattern.

4. DCD will instruct the Washington Field Office
to tell Davidson that there is no CIA interest in this
ecquisition end bow out of this affair.
