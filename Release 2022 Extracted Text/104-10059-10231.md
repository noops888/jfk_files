MEMORANDUM FOR THE-RECORD ©

SUBJECT: James A. Everett. 1

at Ay. Everett met with the IG and the undersigned for over an hour ™

and a half yesterday afternoon. He was separated from the Agency, asia
Staff Agent, in, June 1973, and now, seeks a review of that action.:

.

2. Everett stated that he sexved fox - fourteen years with ‘the :

Agency,” starting, with CT training in 1959, He joined the > Agency ..

tex 8-1/2" years in the ministry, and was "clean" for purposes’ of
deep cover. He served always under. cover, “and the meeting with ‘us
was the first time he ever had been in the Headquarters Building. *
He had spent four years in Norway, and spoke the Janguage, which
he felt made him a natural for his original. choice of "deep « cover," - 5
which he now thinks may have been wrong. . 7

3. Everett states’ that he w was with the Agency im Swéden for”
7 years - 1960-67 - first under cover with an export-import firm |
based in New York The.last three to three and a half years were
with Robert R. Mullen & Co. He says hef#¥4S the number two man
in LPGLOBE,\ which he understands has since been incorporated -
into. CGS. He retained his cover in Mullen (which was two blocks .
: away from the SLPGLOBE offices), being responsible for the Africa
area, Then he went to the Netherlands for four. years; he doubted | ~
the viability of that assignment, yet there were four. People there a
without enough to do.
4.° Two things happened. . First there was the Western ‘”
Hemisphere flap, related to the Agee case, He had been a CT
classmate of Agee's, although they were in different parts of the ,:
@ivided class. He knew Agee, having a casual but familiar association :
with him dering training. He says Agee has a phenomenal memory.
He has not seen Agee since training. He says that Agee was Kirdschi's
. case officer in Mexico City, when Kindschijwas under Mullen cover,
"and that Agee listed Kindschijin a book Agee has written, repotting

“Was not mentioned.in Agee's. book, but it" raised a d a further eae
about his es to Agee. Seereieniirgeee

" 5. Everett “returned to Washington 17 June 1972--he noted the
irony of the date, being the one-of thé Watergate arrests. He met

“ . Howard Hunt (for the first time).on 19. June at the Mullen office, at

: Jwhich Hunt met him like a long. lost brother,. based on his own earlier
CIA- employment. Now they were both vice presidents of the same: |
company. The window of the office was across the street from that

of the.office of headquarters of the Committee to Re-elect the President. -°
Everett éommented that’ they must be uneasy "over there," and | :
: coramented on the stupidity of what had been’ ‘done in view of the over-
‘whelming. strength of the President. ..He could seé something like that

oe happening in 1937 (sic), when theré was the i issue of peace, Hunt did

, not comment, but in about 2 half hour thexé was. a phone call indicating
that the police had a lead, Hunt extlaimed, "My God,-no!" and left.

'. They met.on the street shortly thereafter, but Hunt. didn't even see

him he was so preoccupied. He returned” to the office’ and left’ again

and Everett never saw him again. Everett observed that his association
with Hunt ,_ although clean, was enother weakness in his cover. His
‘cover, “which haa been strong was now gone," Now. deep. cover was -
pver a fea him,’ and the question became what to do.. ae

6, At this point Everett gave his personal view that an intelli-
. gence organization has special res ponsibilities towards its employees.
- "If it doesn't react with integrity towards its employee hat will be
the dezth of it. ; ne pinnae :

_.as affecting the Ag ‘s ability to adjust to its responsibilities.

He (Everett) had loc ea for another line of work in the Agency, and

 fimaliy found a place in DO Division {although it has become FR -

. Division. and may have doné so by then}... The job was in Chicago, . 7
and he talked twice to the Chief of Station, .2s he texrzned him, whese | ..: -...

“and there was practically no chance of a tie-in-to the past.. Everett

says he did not have a “signature on paper, "! but he considered it
practically dgreed, the previso being approval.of the Division Chief,”
Nor somecne above him." He only had to come in on a Monday, :
efter'which he would go to. Chicago to lock for housin No-one kept
fonday appointment at the sat: use. Again, on ne”
He became worried about the ‘off ag: :
nature of this. On Friday another appbintenent was rnade , bat instead.”
bl someone from the Division showing up, it was Jack Kindschi and ©.
barlie Beckman from CCS, the latter saying it wes his Fespansibitity
eckman described
alternatives that Beckman characterized as being "very generous,
along with 2 ‘number of horror stcries to keep'me feeling 2 little “

“ moze comfortable." ‘There were three limitations on a settlement: *

(1) Everett could not use his former Agency employment as a reference
{2) he ‘could not use his former Mullen association as a reference, and
{3) he could not seek employment on the East coast. He-would be paid ae
a year's salary, wth taxes deductible. Evereit said he could not -

accept the offer. He was an executive who would have to seck empioy~ ;

ment with no record of what he had done for the past fourteen years,

Beckman was “quoted as seying itis "the best anybody’ s Lia offered." .

i “3. Everett talkea. with Matien,” “who he said was shocked. =
Mullen had helped Bissell, and had done more for the Agency than.
many in it,: and could not understand this approach," Beckman
(2pparently) off-set this reaction with statements of the Agency's
authority to hire and fire, and told him of the lack of success far i
eleven who had. taken the issue, to court. -

Geert Ei jexett waited a Fea sum ‘payment, unaccountable, and
in a few day8. 15 July was thé deadline. "They" returned on 15 July
and said OK, byt on 30, July, they. said the payment would haye to be
taxéd. This meant an extra $5,000 out of his pocket. Everett then
cited some $18-19, 000 for his salary, plus some $10,800 from his
xetirement and accumulated leave. He did not complete summarizing |
all the details.." He said they tried their best to go back and.re~
calculate the past five years to help on the tax, -and the Agency is
responsible for doing the tax "this year. and until the taxes level off."

7 : 10. .Everett said he had talked with Pete Wheeler at the time
who was incensed, and who said "we'll get you something," and "as



. long as Iam in this Agency you will have a job.'"'. This was in June-
July 1973, and Wheeler "fought it up to and including Schlesinger."'.
Everett said his record was. superior--he had never been in a flap,
“1 although he had takén over people's flaps, he had never had a moncy
problem, he had never raped a secretary, while others who had-
eroblems staved on. Waceler argued £ if acid had been throws in
his. face he would have been retized on medical disability, and that
“now he suffered a sécuriiy disability which, for our Agency, was just
as much a disability, and he should be retired with an annuity. “Wheeler
queted Schlesinger to Everett as dismissing it out of hand, and Colby
' as not,wanting to touch it.. Wheeler said he had no where else to go,
and it was s. final. Everett then went t to Mullen.

een dy Mallen then undertook to take on the responsibility, although
it was not his. -He said there would be ncthing for 1973, but that then
he could expect $25, 000.2 year, followed by $35,000.. Unfortunately

. Watergate hasnot gone away--it has been hammer, hammer, hammer.
| Innocent people have been hurt, and Mullen has lost business because
, of it, .The largest account has been lost, for Rehabilitation of the
Handicapped at $98,000 a year. He also named General Foods to the

: tune of $50-60, 000 a year, the Mormon Church and International

. Rotary Club.” Mullen sold out to Robert Bennett, to be paid $150, 000,

: bat in view of what has happened to the company he has waived the
payment.:. Everett still wants to stay with Bennett, but Bennett is
looking around, ‘for a ace to get out, which would mean the company
is through

verett spoke of his status, in which his fernily, the Dutch
hy ete., have not knows his 2usociation with CIA. The publicity -
of the Mullen Amsterdam office.can mean only him; as he was the
Amsterdam office. With the Muilen Compeny he brought in 2 $30, 009
acount--$25,000 this year=—but now it seems to be under some hold-

if he loses the account because of publicity who is to pay?

14. In his tales with "a good friend on the Hill," he was s asked,
about his separation from CIA, about what the IG said about it. He
said he never knew, as he never talked to him, . Then he cailed

would have to inguire into how the matter was handled. oe

16. Everett said that kis appeal was essentially for. one sof two fat
alternative things: (1) a return to the Agency, deep cover is out,- but

possibly something. like the IG, but no make-work job. "He might be :

given an overseas post in an embassy under official cover; or (2) he
feels he has earned 14/20 of retirement, under the security disability
