day-to-day basis in connection with spot surveillances of the

establishments frequented by the subject when he is in the

furnishing of his racket information to the pittsburgh office.

Real Estate Department of the Fidelity Trust Co., Potter Branch,

in Pittsburgh, will keep the Pittsburgh office advised of any
