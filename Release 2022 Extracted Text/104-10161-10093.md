THE VENEZUELAN GOVERNMENT, ON ITS OWN INITIATIVE AND

WITHOUT ANY PROMPTING FROM WASHINGTON, FOUGHT COMMUNIST INSURRECTION

TO A STANDSTILL HERE IN THE EARLY SIXTIES. THERE WAS NO NEED

OF ANY PAYMENT FROM THE CIA FOR ANYTHING. THE VENEZUELAN GOVERN-

MENT WAS WHOLEHEARTEDLY IN THIS FIGHT FOR ITS OWN REASONS, TO

PROTECT ITS OWN INTERESTS, USING ITS OWN RESOURCES. "

2, NOTE IN THE ABOVE THAT THE JOURNAL HAS MADE THE

SAME ERROR AS THE GOVERNMENT OF VENEZUELA IN ATTRIBUTING INFO

FROM "INTELLIGENCE SOURCES" AND "AN OLD OFFICIAL OF THE CIA" AS

COMING FROM DAVID PHILLIPS. SINCE ONE OF THE FAVORITE STUNTS IN

THIS COUNTRY IS TO QUOTE STATEMENTS OUT OF CONTEXT AND/OR MISQUOTE

ACCIDENTALLY OR ON PURPOSE, SUCH STATEMENTS RARELY CLARIFY ANYTHING;

THEY ONLY COMPLICATE, ALMOST ALWAYS TO OUR DISADVANTAGE.

3, NO FILE. EZ- IMPDET•

*Advised that New York Times article of 1 March has blown the lid off the

situation in Caracas again.
