1. INTRODUCTION. As a follow up to reference, Maj. Watlington
arrived in Niami on 6 June 1962. After Maj. Watlington had an op-
portunity to discuss the local situation with Lt. Col, Carlos Causes *
the local ACSI representative, arrangements were made for a lengthy
session on the subject of Agreed Activities. It was agreed that
this discussion would take place at 1000 hours on 7 June 1962 at a
JENAVE safehouse facility. This meeting subsequently took place as
scheduled and was participated in by Lt. Col. Causes, Kaj. Watlington,
Budley R. JENTONS, Charles B,.WIESINGER and Andrew K. REUTEMAN.
fhe specific points which were outlined in this discussion are
covered in the following paragraph.

- DISCUSSIONS. In the course of the 7 June 1963, conversations
ACSI representatives the following topics worthy of recording
discussed.

a. Opa Locha Refugee Referral Procedures. la).
Watlington made the point that in accordance with the
agrecrents which had been reached between ACSI and
KUBARX, 2ocal procedures were to be agreed upon in
order that ACSI might obtain refugee referrals froa
Opa Locita which could be used as a basis upon which to
mount OB collection operations. taj. Watlington under-
scored the point that ACSI had no interest or charter
to rua other than OB collection operations. At the
cane time if any of their operations produced intelli-
Gence on subject natter other than OB, this intelligence
would be reported via existing ACSI reports channels.
REUTELAN indiated that JLMAVE, acknowledged the validity
of ACSI's mission in the OB field, and we were therefore
willing pagegeera te fully in this regard. On the other

safeguards bo built into any Opa Locka rgferral in. order
that we could minimizo the possibilities for duplication
‘of effort and/or wiro crossing. This concept was readily
accoptod by Haj. Watlington. It did not, however, strike
a totally responsive chord in Lt. Col. Causes. This was
noted but in order to proceed with preliminary arrange-
“ nents, REUTENAN put forth the proposal that ACSI register
a. list of igent requirements with Opa Locka and that this
list could then be used as a basis upon which refugee
screenings could be conducted, It was suggested that col.
Kail would be the logical point of reference in Opa Locka 7
through which the referral system could be managed. In ap
“this connection it was pointed out that once Col. Kail
identified an individual whom he considered to ‘be pri- —
marily of ACSI interest, he could arrange for this indi-
vidual to be referred to Lt. Col. Causes’ covert unit.
At the same time Col. “ail would make arrangements to pass
to KUBARK representatives at Opa Locka and to Station
JMWAVE a copy of the Opa Locka debriefing of the individual
who had been referred to ACSI. Upon receipt of this in-
formation KUBARK representatives at Opa Locka and at
Station JMWAVE would review the referral, Ifi this review
revealed that the individual was not of operational
anterest to JMWAVE and his primary access was not in fields
other than OB, no objections would be expressed relative
to ACSI retention and full exploitation of the body. Haj.
Watlington expressed satisfaction with this proposal and
“gtated that he would be prepared to discuss it further
once he had an opportunity to personally review the func-
tioning of tho, Opa Locka center. :

Lt. Col. Causes stated that he felt that ho had
established his equity in Ordonez through the namo *
trace procedure. Despite this, he had found that
Ordonez had disappeared from circulation; and, there-
fore, he assumed that we were debriefing this man.

e. Third Country Diplomats, REUTEMAN asked the
ACSI representatives whether they were currently in
touch with any third country diplomats. aj. Watlington
stated tha tencSt had previously tried to harness thepy

that at thy present time ACSI was not in touch with any

interested in pursuing the third country diplomatic
channel pis a medns of establishing communications with
inside dssets. At this point Lt. Col. Causes stated
that he was very disappointed at KUBARK's refusal to

whim to use the facilities of the,

ts reaction; however, the KUBARK

positio: was based on sound security principles and
could not be altered. The additional explanations which
were made relative to the security implications which
were inherent in the use of third country diplomats and
how misuse could affect long standing government to
government or service to service agreements between
ODYOXE and free world countrics did not make any impact
on Lt. Gol. Causes. This gentleman was predisposed to

area was to restrict and inhibit ACSI operational activity.
Once this attitude was identified no further attempts were
made to persuade Lt. Coi. Causes that our actions had

been taken in the best interests of‘ the intelligenco
community.

eet, mo Yagiltration of ACSI Anents. A dis-
cussion of @ Gupport services which KUEAK might
ronder to ACSY operations revealed that Lt. Col. Causes
was stiil interested in having JMWAVE infiltrate two of
his agents lnto PBRUMEN. In this connection the poiut
was made by ACSY that under optimum circumstances they
would prefer that JMVAVE assume responsibility for the
agents in. the Miami area and then deliver them through a
secure mechanism to liavana, if this were not possible
ACSY would reluctantly accept infiltratibn of their agents
into any point in PBRUMEN, Lt. Col. Causes was toid in
very precise terns that JLMWAVE would not undertake to
Anfiltrate any of his agents into Havana, On the other
hand, we would consider any proposal’ for tho infilitrataon
of selected agents to a beach ayea in PBRUWEN, The point
was made that in this connection Lt. Col, Causes had to

- understand that our maritime capabilities were linited
and we were currently committed to the full exploitation
of these assets for at icast six weeks in advance. As a
resuit any operational plan which he might subnit to us
should be keyed to the agaumption that approximately six
to eight ‘weeks would paGs before we could realistically
consider the servicing of his request. Lt. Col. Causes

agreed to project his operational plans within this frane
of reference. a

: G. Docunontation. A discussion of tho documontation
problom reYative to iigent infiltrations revoaled that at
the nomeat ACSI Gid not have any.documentation problems
which they felt warranted discussion at this session.

h. ’ Coordination Forms. The discussion of opsra-
tiopal coordination yovealed that ACSI was willing for
SLAVE to coordinate locally those operational. proposals
which might be received from,Lt. Col. Causes. Once this
coordination was effected and if there were disagreement,
then the operation could be referred to the Washington
headquarters of both ACSI and JMWAVE, Maj. Watlington >
stated that the forms for effecting coordination in ac-
cordance with procedures which had been agreed upon at
Washington would be sent to both JMWAVE and the ACSI unit
in Miami in the near future. In view of this Maj. Ee
Watlington suggested that we not initiate the coordination
mechanism until these forms were on hand circa 1 July 1962.

i. W/T Assets. The discussion of the use of W/T
facilities in terms of PDRUMEN operations revealed that
the Miami ACSI unit did not have any W/T assets in
PDRUMEN at this time. On the other hand, Lt. Col. Causes
was‘ interested in establishing W/T assets in PBRUMEN. In Pisstetan
view of Ghis he asked if JMWAVE would continue to assess,
polygraph and train those individuals that ACSI thought z
wore suitable W/T candidates. It was indicated that we 7
were cortainly prepared to review all appropriate cases
and would render whatever support was required. This then
resulted in a discussion of. whether JMWAVE would be willing
to monitor ACSI W/T transmissions from PBRUMEN in those
\ instances where the W/T operator had not been assessed,
yb polygraphed or trainod by KUBARK. We indicated that we
would be glad to moniter,such transmissions if we were
told in advance of the date, time and frequencies on which
the breadcasts were to be made. This then led to a dis-
cussion of whether JIMWAVE would be willing to transmit
C/li messages for ACSI agents. Here again, we stated that
we would favorably consider any requests for C/V trans-
missions providing that we knew the content of the message,
the identity of the agent who was to receive it, and the
« _.@gent's Location and equipment which he might be using.
Lt. Col. Causes stated that in view of this discussion we
could anticipate that he weuld be levying requirenents on
us in the near future for support in the W/T field.

A,

d je Secret Writing. A discussion of S/W teéhniques ‘

revealed a request for the issuance of S/W were

Gg recoived from theix Miami representative it would be ve-
viewed, and if ACSY approved the operation KUBARK would
be asked to issue a system. If JMWAVE agreed via iecal
coordination that the operation in question required the
use of S/W, then this recommendation would ba cabled to
our Washington Headquarters where coordination would be
effocted with ACSX. Once this was accomplished, KUBARK

i Washingtgn would cable to JMWAVE the number of the system

+ which was\to be issued. JLMVAVE would then issue the
system to the ACSI representative in Miami.

3. COMMENT, At the conclusi6a of the above discussion arrange-
ments wore made for lunch, but Lt. Col. Causes chose not to partici-
pate in the luncheon session, During -the luncheon conversation
’ Eaj. Watlington indicated that he did not believe that Lt. Col.
Causes would cooperate within the spirit of the DCID's. As a result
he asked that JMWAVE be extremely patient with ACSI until such time -
as Lt. Col. Causes retired and could be replaced. Haj. Watlington

indicated that the retirement was scheduled to take place. at the
end of Saptember 1962, At the end of thé luncheon session ar-
rangeneats wore made for JENTONS to take Maj. Watlington on a ~
cea ef Opa Locka, Based on this tour additional discussions

ore to be held with Maj. Watlington particularly in regard to
tho development of proceduves for referral of agents to ACSI
from the Opa Locka flow.

4. OPA LOCKA, Maj. Watlington and JENTONS subsequently
went out To the Interrogation center at Opa Locka, Here they
had an interview with Col. Kail, “the tenor of which was, on the
part of Naj. Watlington, to assure himself that the ACSI repre-
sentative, Francasi, was having adequate access to operational
leads. Col. Kail said that operational leads were shared ac-
cording to their abilities between the KUBARK representative and
the, ACSI man. However, there were occasional difficulties in
assuring that the men best qualified received the body in question,
In addition, he said KUBARK.occasionally pulled a man out of the
Center without his completing the full treatment which precluded
the ACSI representative's getting his hands on someone who might
be well qualified for their operations. Maj. Watlington believed
that assurance that the ACSI representative got a fair deal
might be achieved through a more complete briefing of Col.
Trudencio Ulibarri, who is in charge of the preliminary screening
so that he would more fully understand what was needed. JENTONS
said that this would be a very good idea, but that it would be
better if it were a dul briefing with a KUBARK representative
being present as well. Maj. Watiington said that he would ask
his headquarters for permission to have such a briefing given.
Col. Kail expressed his opinion that the assignment of JENTONS
to formal liaison with the ACSI representatives would do much to
eliwinate present difficulties and all present echoed this pious
thought.

5. AGREEMENT, When JENTONS turned Maj. Watlington over to
Lt. Col, Causes after the meeting at Opa Locka, the two ACSI
representatives said that they believed that, for the time being,
it would be better to continue the system as at present, pending
JENTONS' permanent arrival at the beginning of July 1962. As. Lt.
Col. Causes is obviously skeptical about the outcome, this was
agreed to as a stopgap measure.
