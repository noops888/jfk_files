“'404-10213-10087) {2022 RELEASE UNDER THE PRESIDENT JOHN F. KENNEDY ASSASSINATION RECORDS ACT OF 1992 J

MEMORANDUSA FOR: Director of Central Intelligence

FROM : John H, Waller
Inspector General

SUBJECT : Washington Star Story, 1 October 1576

1, This is for your information only.

2, On 1 October 1976 the Washington Star published a news 7
story with an Associated Press crecit line, headlined CLA
Viewed Oswald As Information Source (copy attached). Tre
lead stated:

Contrary to sworn testimozy, the CIA once con-
sidered using presidential assassin Lee Harvey
Oswald as a source of intelligence information
about the Soviet Union, according to a newly .
released CIA document,

In sworn testimony before the Warren Commission,
former CIA Director Richard Helms said the
Agency never had "or even coatemplated" any
contacts with Oswald.

‘The news story, in another section, made the following
statement:

The November 25, 1983, memo explained that
the Agency's interest in Oswald as a potential
intelligence source was due to his “unusual :
behavior in the USSR, "' to which he had defected
in 1959.

+ PR TIED tt pigonts ogee ne,



officer then stationed in Pat
Writing three days after Pre: dent
this case officer recalled that the

There was such a memorandum, written by a case
» recently released under FOIA,
Xeunedy's assessination,
had been interest in Oswald,

As soon as I had heard Oswald's name, U recalled
that as Chief of the 6 Branch I had discussed --
sometime in the summer of 1940 -- with the then
Chief and Deputy Chief of tne $ Rese: 2°.ion
the laying on of interview (s) through :WTUM or
other suitable channels...

I remember that Oswald's unusual behavior in the
USSR had struck me from the moment I had rend
the first ODACID.dispatch oa him, and I told my
subordinates something amcunting to "Don!: push
too hard to get the informaticn we need, because
this individual look: odd."

+ 4 + Ido not know whst action eeveloped there-
after...

The Helms testimony before the Warren Commission

on this subject was as follows:

,

Mr. Helms. On Mr, McCone's behalf, I had all

our records searched to see if there had been

any contacts at any time prior to President Kennedy's
assassination by anyone in the Central Intelligence
Agency with Lee Harvey Oswald. We checked our
card files and our personal files and all our records.

Now this check turned out to be negative. In addition

I got in touch with those officers who were in’ positions

of responsibility at the times in question to sec if : :
anybody had any recollection of any contact having
even been suggested with this man, This also turned
out to be negative, so there is nd material in the
Central Intelligence Agency, either in the records or
in the mind of any of the individuals, that there was
any contact had or even contemplated with kim.



5. Mr. Helms did state exactly the words quoted in the
news story -- “or even contemplated." But the context of
those words was what was reported to him as the result of
@ search of records and memories. To this day those
familiar with the extensive Gswald records state that there
is no reflection in those records that anyone even underto:
to propose or approve a contact with Oswald, It would have
been natural to do so, but apparently any such thoughts did
not progress to formal action. From the memorandum
quoted, it is apparent that someone at Branch level ‘id thin'e
about it, even if uothing ever came of it. This hardly con-
stitutes a responsible or official or serious "contemplation"
of the idea. Mr. Helms' full statement on this point seems
literally correct in the full context of his statement, although
more refined qualifications might have reiterated the basis
for his concl:sions. The news story is misleading on this
point.

6 The news story statement that Oswald was considered
due to his “unusual behavior in the USSR," is exactly the
opposite of the statements of the quoted memorandum, which
reported the care that should be used if Oswald ware approached,
because of his strange conduct.

7. The statement in the news story about Mr. Dulles
consulting with Agency personnel on how to answer questions
is basically true, The interpretation to be placed on this
counseiling will depend on the interpreter, The infercace of
the news story is that Mr. Dulles was counselling slanted
responses on the Oswald issue, thereby tending to reinforce
the interpretation of deception attributed to Mr. Helms.
