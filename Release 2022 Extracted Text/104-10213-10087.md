3. There was such a memorasdurs, wiitten by & case

officer then stationed in Par':, recently relcased wider FOlA.

Writing three days alter Prè: dest ircuredy's assassination,

this case officer recalled that their had bes interest in Oswald.

As soon as I had heard Oswald's name, l recalira

that as Chiei of the 6 Branch I had dis-ussui ..

sometime in the summer of 1960 -- ivith the tren

Chief and Deputy Crief of the 5 Riscatch scion

the laying on oi interview (s) through i ll or

other suitable channels . . .

I remember that Oswald's unusual behavior in ilia

USSR had struck me from the moment I had re:d

the hrst ObACID dispatch on him, and I told my

subordinates something aricuating to "Don': push

too hare to get the information ise need, because

this individual looks sdd."

I do not know what action dereloped there-

after

4.

The Helms testimony before the Warren Cormission

on this subject was as follows:

Mr. Helms. On Mr. McCone's behalf, I had all

our records searched to see if there had been

any contacts at any time prior to President Kennedy'.

assassination by anyone in the Centrul Intelligence

Agency with Lee Harvey Oswald. We checked our

card files and our personal files ard all our records.

Now this check turned out to be negative. In addition

I got in touch with those officers who were in positions

of responsibility at the times in question to see it

anybody had any recollection of any contact having

even been suggested with this man. This also turned

out to be regative, so there is no material in the

Central Intchligence Agency, either in the records or

in the mind of any of the individuals, that there was

any contaci had or even contemplated with bim.

5. Mr. Helms did state exactly the words quoled in the

news story -- "or even contemplaied."

But the context of

those words was what was reported to him as the resull of

a search of records and memories. To this day those

familiar with the extensive Oswald records state that there

is no reflection in those records tha: anyone even undertoo!:

to propose or approve a contact with Oswald. It sould have

been natural to do so, but apparently any such thoughts did

not progress to formal action.

From the memorandum

quoted, it is apparent that someone at Branch level tid think

about it, even if nothing ever came of it. This hardly con-

stitutes a responsible or official o= serious "contemplation"

of the idea. Mr. Helms' full statement on this point seems

literally corsect in the full context of his statement, although

more refined qualifications might have rciterated the basis

for his conclisions. The news story is mislcading on this

point.

6. The news story statement that Oswald was considered

duc to his "unusual behavior in the ÜSSR, " is exactly the

opposite of the statements of the quoted memorandun, which

reported the care that should be used if Oswald were approached,

because of his strange conduct.

7. The statement in the news story about Mr. Dulles

consulting with Agency personnel on how to answer questions

is basically true.

The interpretation to be placed on this

cousseiling will depend on the interpreier. The infercace of

the news story is that Mr. Dulles was counselling slanted

responses on the Oswald issue, thereby tending to reinforce

the interpretation of deception attributed to Mr. Helms.
