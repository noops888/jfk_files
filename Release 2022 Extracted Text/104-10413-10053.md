fy te 2. {WILSTED emphasized that the whole tolephone system in Mexico
"Obtyy is:undergoing a reformation. The company Telefonos de Mexico, S.A.,

: > has-sub-oontracted this work of cleaning up and reorganizing the phone
“eystem: to the independent firm, Intel. They are cleaning up unused and
,Old-lines, putting in new and spare lines, redefining exchange areas,
laying. underground cables, etc. Eventually we should be better off be-
‘gause: there should be more surplus lines. The renovation vork has
‘hampered much of the LIFEAT work, principally because many of the lines
‘now ate underground and we camot get access to them before they enter
,Mho-cantral. This is particularly trun with respect to the Czech Eme

““ passy, to whose telephone lines we cannot obtain access from the vantage
ae we now occupy.

cay 3. WILSTKD seid that we try to keep track of the activities of
Intel" but since they seem to attack "Colonias" at random, we have no
“prior warming of their presence in a certain area.

4. In the recent past, ‘axico has been using houses for listing
posts for security reasons. ‘e have more control over the access of
phone company inspectors or repairman to houses. flowever, under new

a regulations, all new apartmant buildings must havo telephone lines in-
e atalled in the building by the phone company during the construction
phase. This means that tho lines and their destination are concealed,
WILSTED proposed that this will mean we can again use apartments since
we can siphon off a line destined for use by another tenant in such a
way that the phone company cannot trace ites destination without tearing
the building apart and we can then install a separate line to the build-
ing and hook up the subscriber to this line which, if checked, will
belong to a legitimate subscriber.

5e One system which has been used effectively is to take one-half
of two separate pairs which have one faulty line each. These two half
pairs then form one good pair which we can use.

6 WIISTED explained that it cost about 3000 posos to get a
regular telephone. This entails the purchase of a telephone company '
pond, which later can be sold.
