i @ ~The cancellation cadhat onthe envelope 1s identical in
all respects (format, postaaric, nuiber etyle ond length of killer
vars) to exemplars availubleiini.cu-office.: :

f. The postage is correct fox Swedish internal mail and the
postage Stamp is of current iaaue.

& A possible irregularity is the time leg between the internal
deste of the letter, the date of the postmarz end the date of receipt
in the American Embessy. ‘The total timo from the internal date of
the letter to the tine of recaipt is wight days, the tine between
the date of posting and the date of receipt is more then three days.
This transit time of more than three days for intra-city mail appeors
irregular when compared with the average transit time of only two-

i three: days ‘for errival betwoos Stockholm and the United States.

3. tho ‘text of the letter warrants scme coments beccuse 6 mumber
of paculferities were noted ~ aside from yure spelling or typing errors -
which seem to indfcate.a Swedish writer. ‘he following words represent
either Swedish spelling or modification: “reserv”, “etablisned”, “murded”,
“Krustjey". , Other examples of Swedich granmsr and syntax vould be:

met" (os past tense}, “in Sowiet" (Svedich form but not spelling),
“he was epy". (without indefinite sirtciels), “FEI, USA" (without definite
orticle),."shoula” (rather than "voula"}, "outemggled” (Syedich past
participle. fora), ond waols the voyxhd" (pure Swedish form).

4, Another significont detail te the name given, “Ryo Liang Yoan".
“Ryo" 1a not a standard spelling in any known Romanization system used
for Chinese.  “R" 1s seen in the new Chinese Commmist nationsl systen,
but never in combination with “yo*. “°Ryo" 1s e Japanese spelling. In
the nam? given 4t is not known whether thea Chinese or Western presen-
tation is used, in other words, whether “Ryo“ or “Yuan is meant to be
the surname. Among Chinese syllakies which could be represasted by the
Jayesess “Ryo” are Liao, Liang wri Lung. Cf these Lung (10:7893) end
Ifang ('09:2733) ere used as surnamed, In either case, "Ryo" is hardly
& nsme by which a real Chiness would iduntify himself,

5. In eumery, and based on the above taformation, it in concluded
that the letter was tranmitted vin normal Swedish postal charnels. The
letter 1s probably a “crank letter", mowt likely written by a Side,
using a Swedich-keyboard typewriter and Swedish stationery.
