C. Silvia Durdn Tur Stunt)

When President John F. Kennedy was assassinated

on November 22, 1963,,the United States investigative
agencies--FBI, CIA, Secret Service, etc.--were asked to
investigate the assassination. When the Central Intelli-
gence Agency's Mexico City Station remembered that Lee
Harvey Oswald had visited Mexico City during late Septem-
ber and early October, it reviewed the electronic surveil-
lance files and found evidence of phone calls to the So-
viet Embassy made September 27th, September 28th, and
October Ist, that could have been made by Oswald. 685/
Review of the electroic surveillance files also produced
telephone calls on September 27, 1963 between the Russian
Consul and Silvia Duran, a secretary at the Cuban Consu-
late, where Oswald was discussed. 686/ In addition,
the Mexico City Station found a September 28, 1963 phone
call from Silvia Duran to the Soviet Consulate where Silvia
Duran stated that there was an American citizen at the
Cuban Consulate who had previously visited the Soviet Con-
sulate. 687/ A final phone call was made on October 1, 1963
where the “alleged” Oswald identified himself was also
found. 688/

mined that it would request the Mexican government--

with whom it had a good relationship--to arrest Silvia
Duran (as Silvia Duran was a Mexican citizen, she did not
have diplomatic immunity) because she might shed some light
on the circumstances surrounding the assassination. 688a/

The Mexico City Station sent a note to the Gober-
nacion head, Luis Echevarria, with Silvia Duran's address,
her mother's address, her brother's address, her license
plate number, her home phone number, her place of work and
a request that she be arrested immediately. 689/ The Mexi-
co City Station also suggested that Duran he held incommuni-
cado until she could be questioned on the matter. 690/

The Mexico City Station did not receive prior au-
thorization from CIA Headquarters to request the arrest of
Silvia Duran by Mexican authorities. 691/ Headquarters
feared that a request to arrest Ms. Duran would jeopardize
the clandestine relationship between certain Mexican govern-
ment officials and the CIA if it were disclosed that Americans
were behind Duran's arrest. 672/ John Scelso, Chief of Western
Hemisphere/3, stationed at Langley Headquarters, telephoned
Winston Scott, the Mexico City Chief of Station, and requested
that Silvia Duran not be arrested. 693/ Scott told Scelso that
he could not rescind the request, and that Headquarters should

already have Cae doascable stating that Silvia Duran had

been arrested. 694/ After Winston Scott's conversation
with John Scelso, Scott called Luis Echevarria and stated
that the Mexico City Station desired that all information
received from Duran be forwarded immediately to the Mexico
City Station, and that her arrest and statements not be
communicated to any leftist groups. 695/

On November 27, 1963, the Mexican government for-
warded to the Mexico City Station a copy of Silvia Duran's
ten-page signed statement. 696/ It said,

"Upon learning about the assassination

she and her husband speculated that Presi-

dent Kennedy might have been assassinated

for racial reasons. When she became aware

that the assassin was Lee Harvey Oswald, she
ascertained that it was the same man who ap-
proximately two months prior had been to the
Cuban Consulate to solicit an intransit visa

to Russia. Having taken his name from the
special documentation he presented she knew
that he was married to a Russian woman and
belonged to the "Fair Play for Cuba Committee."
She checked the data in the Consulate archives
and became certain that it was the same indi-
vidual who was blonde, short, dressed unelegant-
ly and whose face turned red when angry. The
Consul had denied the visa because to obtain

an intransit visa from the Cuban government,

jt was imperative that he previously obtain a
visa from the Soviet Consulate. Since obtain-
ing a visa from the Soviets took four months
and Oswald's Mexican visa expired soon Oswald
was advised: that he see the Soviet Consul, and
calling the person in charge of that office.
The Soviet official told her that they would
have to consult Moscow which would take four
months. That afternoon, Oswald reruns to the

Cuban Consulate and Silvia Duran confirmed
that he could get a Cuban visa only after he
received a Russian visa. She gave Oswald her name
and business phone number but never gave him her .:,
address because she had no reason to give it to
him. The only aid she could give Oswald was advising j
that he see the Soviet Consul and calling the person
in charge of that office. She knew that phoning the
Soviet Consulate was not one of her duties and that
if she did so she did it only to help Oswald. She
gave Oswald her business phone number only because he
would have to call subsequently to check whether he
had obtained a visa. He never called back."
Silvia Duran, released on November 24, 1963, was rearresteaf
November 27, 1963, when the Mexican government alleged that she
was attempting to leave Mexico for travel to Havana. 698/
According to the Mexican officials who detained Duran a second
time, there was no addition to her story. 699/

The Mexico City Station forwarded Duran's ten-page signed
statement to Headquarters on November 27, 1963. 700/ The
following day, Headquarters sent a clarification cable to the

Mexico City Station seeking to insure that neither Silvia

the Americans were behind her rearrest. The cable stated,
"We want the Mexican authorities to take the responsibility
for the whole affair." 701/

with the Warren Commission, Headquarters cabled the Mexico

City Station that its plan in passing information to the

Warren Commission was to eliminate mention of telephone
taps in order to protect their continuing operations. 702/
Headquarters cabled that it would rely on Silvia Duran's
statements and on the Consular files which the Soviets
gave the State Department. 703/ Headquarters stressed
that exact, detailed information from LITAMIL-7 and
LITAMIL-9--penetration agents in the Cuban Embassy--on
what Silvia Duran and other officials had said about Os-
wald's visit and his dealings would be valuable and usable
corroborative evidence. 104/

When the Central Intelligence Agency forwarded to
the Warren Commission a copy of Duran's signed statement.
It read as follows:

.She remembered..(that Lee Harvey Oswald)
was the name of an American who had come to
the Cuban Consulate to obtain a visa to travel
to Cuba in transit to Russia, the latter part
of September or the early part of October of
this year, and in support of his application
had shown his passport, in which it was noted
that he had lived in that country for a period
of three years; his labor card from the same
country written in the Russian language; and
letters in that same language. He had presented
evidence that he was married to a Russian woman,
and also that he was apparently the leader of
an organization in the city of New Orleans claim-
ing that he should be accepted as a "friend" of
the Cuban Revolution. Accordingly, the declarant,
complying with her duties, took down all of the

information and completed the appropriate
application form; and the declarant, ad-
mittedly exceeding her responsibilities,
informally telephoned the Russian Consulate,
with the intention of doing what she could

to facilitate issuance of the Russian visa

to Lee Harvey Oswald. However, they told

her that there would be a delay of about

four months in processing the case, which
annoyed the applicant since, according to

his statement, he was in a great hurry to
obtain visas that would enable him to travel
to Russia, insisting on his right to do so

in view of his background and his loyalty
and his activities in behalf of the Cuban
movement. The declarant was unable to re-
call accurately whether or.not the applicant
told her he was a member of the Communist
Party, but he did say that his wife***was
then in New York City, and would follow
him,*** (Senora Duran stated) that when Os-
wald understood that it was not possible to
give him a Cuban visa without his first hav-
ing obtained the Russian visa,*** he became
very excited or angry, and accordingly, the
affiant called Consul Ascue (sic),*** (who)
came out and began a heated disucssion in En-
glish with Oswald, that concluded by Ascue
telling him that "if it were up to him, he
would not give him the visa," and “a person
of his type was harming the Cuban Revolution
rather than helping it," it being understood
that in their conversation they were talking
about the Russian Socialist Revolution and
not the Cuban. Oswald maintained that he had
two reasons for requesting that his visa be
issued promptly, and they were: one, that his
tourist permit in Mexico was about to expire;
and the other, that he had to get to Russia
as quickly as possible. Depsite her annoyance,
the decalarant gave Oswald a paper*** in which
she put down her name, "Silvia Duran," and
the number of the telephone at the Consulate,
which is "11-28-47" and the visa application

was processed anyway. It was sent to the

Ministry of (Foreign) Relations of Cuba; from

which a routine reply was received some fifteen

to thirty days later, approving the visa, but on

the condition that the Russian visa be obtained

first, although she does not recall whether or

not Oswald later telephoned her at the Consulate

number that she gave him. 705/

The Central Intelligence Agency had relied on Duran's
statements but had deleted Duran's description of Oswald as
blonde and short. 706/ It had also excised Duran's statement--
"The only aid she could give Oswald was advising that he see
the Soviet Consul, and calling the person in charge of that
office" which alluded to Oswald asking for some type of aid at
the Cuban Consulate. 707/ In addition, Ms. Duran's strong state-
ment "He never called her back" 707a/ was changed to “she does
not recall whether or not Oswald later telephoned her at the

»
Consulate number that she have him.707b/ Had the statements
been included, the Warren Commission's conclusions would not have
seemed as strong.

The Warren Commission staff was not completely satis-
fied with Ms. Duran's ten page signed statement obtained by
the Mexican authorities. W. David Slawson wrote:

We then discussed...the problem of (inter-

viewing) Silvia Duran. We pointed out that

our only interest in witnesses (in Mexico)

other than Duran was to get their formal testi-

mony for authentication purposes...This was

not true of Duran, however, because she had Seen
been interviewed only by the Mexican police dud

and we considered that interview inadequate.
(1 should point out that we do not consider
jt totally inadequate, however. It is only
on details such as Oswald's physical
appearance, side comments or remarks he
May have made, etc., that we would like to
interrogate Mrs. Duran further. On the
essential point of whether ornot his con-
tacts with the Embassy consisted of anything
other than an attempt to travel to Cuba,
Silvia Duran's knowledge has probably been
exhausted.) 708/

The Warren Commission staff's attempts to inter-
view Ms. Duran never succeeded. 709/ Ms. Duran was not
interviewed by Americans until 1976, when two reporters
from the Washington Post interviewed her. 710/ On
June 6, 1978, representatives of the House Select Committee

(on Assassinations interviewed Ms. Duran in Mexico City.

government complied on 6/6/78. Ms. Tirado told the House
Select Committee on Assassinations the following:

Lee Harvey Oswald visited the Cuban Consulate three
times on September 27, 1963, not twice as the Warren Com-
mission previously reported. 712/ Oswald first visited
the Cuban Consulate at approximately 11:00 a.m., requesting
an intransit visa to Cuba with Russia as the final destina-
tion. 713/ He showed her some documents, then left to
obtain photographs needed for his application. 714/

Oswald returned at approximately 1:00 p.m. with

four photographs. 715/ Ms. Tirado typed the application

Wald sign each in her presence. 716/ As identification,
Oswald showed her documents he had brought: his Russian
labor card, marriage certificate with the name of his
Russian wife, his American Communist Party membership card
and his “Fair Play for Cuba" membership card. 717/

Ms. Tirado found Lee Harvey Oswald's behavior suspi-
cious because normally a Communist traveled only with his
passport as belonging to the Communist Party was illegal
in Mexico in 1963. 718/

There was a procedure whereby the American Communist

Party would arrange visa matters for their members with the

Cuban Communist Party. 719/ The American would then

oR

come to Mexico, visit the Cuban Consulate, and receive
his visa immediately. 710/ When Tirado asked Oswald why f
he did not have the American Communist Party arrange his
trip to Cuba, he stated that he had not had the time. 721/
After explaining to Oswald that he had to acquire f
a Russian visa before he could receive a Cuban visa, Tirado
jotted her name and business phone number on a piece of f
paper and gave it to Oswald who then left to get his Rus-
sian visa. 722/ f
Oswald returned to the Cuban Consulate between
5:00 p.m. and 6:00 p.m., which was after normal working f
hours, 10:00 to 2:00 p.m. 723/ The guard called Tirado,
stating that someone who didnot speak Spanish was at the
gate inquiring about a visa. 724/ As routine procedure, f
she asked the guard to escort the individual to her office. 725/
Oswald told her that he had acquired a Russian visa. 726/

Since he did not produce it when asked, she called the

Russian Consulate. 727/ The Consul told Duran that Oswald |
had been to the Consulate requesting a visa and had been

told that the reply would take approximately four months. 728/

of the Cuban Revolution he should receive a visa. 729/
Oswald stated that he could not wait that long because
his Mexican visa expired in three days. 730/ At this
point, Ms. Tirado informed Consul Eusebio Azcue of the
situation. 731/ Azcue had been in his private office
which he shared with his upcoming replacement, Alfredo
Mirabal. 732/ Azcue politely explained the requisites
‘for an intransit visa to Oswald. 733/ When he noticed
that Oswald was a stubborn man he told Oswald that he
was obviously not a friend of the Cuban revolution be-

cause he would otherwise understand that Cuba had to be

try. 734/ Azcue and Oswald yelled at each other. 735/

Then Azcue went to the door, opened it and asked Oswald
to leave. 736/ Oswald did not revisit or telephone the
Consulate. 737/ Ms. Tirado described Lee Harvey Oswald
as approximately five feet six, with sparse blonde hair,

weighing about 125 %: pounds. 738/

The source, LIRING/3, stated that he had recently re-
ceived a call from Silvia Duran. 740/ A telephone tap
on LIRING/3's telephone confirmed that Silvia Duran had
called LIRING. 741/ LIRING/3 reported that he had visited
Silvia to renew acquiaintancees. 742/ During the visit,
Duran told LIRING/3 that she had met Lee Harvey Oswald
at the Cuban Consulate when he applied for a visa and
had dated him on several occasions. 743/ Duran admitted
that she had had intimate relations with Oswald, but in-
sisted that she had no idea of his plans. 744/ In addi-
tion, Duran told LIRING/3 that when the news of the as-
sassination became public knowledge, the Mexican govern-
ment arrested her and during the interrogation beat her
until she admitted that she had had an affair with Lee
Harvey Oswald. 745/ Rowton 746/ counseled LIRING/3
against any further contact with Duran because the Cubans
or the Mexican police might become suspicious of him. 747/
There is no indication in Rowton's report as to why con-
tact with Silvia would make the Cubans suspicious.

The CIA Mexico City Station reported this informa-
tion to Headquarters:

with Lee Harvey Oswald on several occasions

when the latter was in Mexico is probably

new, but adds little to the Oswald case.

Second, the Mexican police did not report

the extent of the Duran-Oswald relationship

to this Station. 749/

In the chronology of the Mexico City investigation
of Oswald, Raymond Rocca notes: "Why didn't Mexico
‘police give us all info?" 750/ This was not the first
report of such a relationship between Oswald and Duran.
Elena Garro had reported the same information to Charles
Thomas in 1965. 751/

That the Mexican government did not disclose all

raises one of three possibilities:

1) the Mexican government did not want to disclose
that one of its citizens had had intimate rela-
tions with the assassin of John Kennedy; or

2) Silvia Duran was a Mexican penetration agent
in the Cuban Consulate and the Mexican govern-
ment was protecting its informant by minimizing
her relationship with Oswald; or

3) they forgot, i.e., a pure and simple mistake.

b. The possibility that Silvia Duran was an
agent for either American, Mexican or Cuban

Intelligence

Since the publication of the Warren Commission
Report in September 1964, critics have written about the
possibility that Silvia Duran was an intelligence agent
for either the Americans, Mexicans or Cubans.

1) Was Silvia Duran an agent, asset or source

for Mexican or American intelligence?

In an effort to resolve this question, the House
Select Committee on Assassinations reviewed the United

States investigative agencies' files on Silvia Duran. 752/

Silvia Duran was either an American or Mexican intelli-
gence agent.

In addition, the Committee has interviewed most
of the Mexico City Station employees about the possibility.
Only David Phillips, Chief of Covert Action and the Cuban
Section in the Mexico City Station in 1963, a position
which made him very knowledgeable, considered that Duran
was possibly an agent or source. Mr. Phillips stated that

“at one time the agency pitched 753/ almost everyone
at the Cuban Embassy." 754/ Mr. Phillips stated that
he had first heard Duran's name from the telephone
intercept transcripts. 755/ But Mr. Phillips asserted
that the CIA had no interest in Ms. Duran because "she
wasn't friendly with anyone." 756/ Mr. Phillips had
previously mentioned the CIA Mexico City Station's in-
terest in recruiting a former Cuban Ambassador to Mexico
named Lechuga. 757/ Mr. Phillips was shown a memorandum
written by W. David Slawson of the Warren Commission staff
regarding a trip to Mexico by Warren Commission staff
members which said:

Mr. Scott's (Chief of the CIA Station in Mexi-
co City) narrative disclosed that the CIA's
action immediately after the assassination con-
sisted basically of alerting all its confiden-
tial sources of information throughout Mexico
to immediately channel all information into
their headquarters, and of compiling as com-
plete dossiers as possible on Oswaldi and every-
one else throughout Mexico who at that time

the CIA knew had had some contact with Oswald...
This meant especially Silvia Duran, who because
she had previously been having an affair with
Lechuga, the former Cuban Ambassador to Mexico
and presently the Cuban representative at the
United Nations, had previously been of substan-
tial interest to the CIA...758/

Mr. Phillips was surprised by this and stated

that "No one let me in on this operation." 759/ But

Mr. Phillips added that he doubted that Duran would
have been pitched because the Station could not identify
any of her weaknesses. The Committee staff members then
told Mr. Phillips about the reporting on file concerning
Ms. Duran from one of the Station's penetration agents,
LITAMIL/9, at the Cuban Embassy. At one point LITAMIL/9
had reported to his case officer that all that would
have to be done to recruit Ms. Duran was to get a blonde,
blue-eyed American in bed with her. 761/ With this, Mr.
Phillips said that it did indeed sound as if the Station
had targeted Ms. Duran for recruitment, that the Station's
interest had been substantial, and that the weaknesses
and means had been identified. 762/ Mr. Phillips
pointed out, however, that because Duran had been targeted
did not necessarily mean that she had been pitched. 763/
In addition, he stated that he had never heard that Duran
had been pitched. 764/

Mr. Phillips did state that he would expect that
Ms. Duran's file at the CIA would be "very thick" because
of all the telephone intercepts that concerned her and
the substantial interest that the Station had in her. 765/
He stated that much of the material in her file should

predate the assassination. 766/ Mr. Phillips stated that

he would be very surprised if Ms. Duran's 201 file was
small and contained only a few pre-assassination docu-
ments. 767/ This is in fact the case of the Headquarters
201 file. 768/ This Committee has asked the CIA to make
Ms. Duran's Mexican "P" 769/ (personality) file available
for review. The CIA informed the Committee that there
was no "P" file available on Ms. Duran. 770/

Another CIA employee, Dan Neiscuir, who worked on
an “Oswald Task Force" in late September or early October
of 1975 dealing with Freedom of Information Act law suits
brought against the Agency concerning the files on Lee
Harvey Oswald, stated that he believed that Ms. Duran may
have been a source of information for either the CIA or
the Mexicans. 771/ Mr. Neiscuir could not recall why he
specifically had this recollection, but thought that it
was due to something he had seen in Oswald's file. 772/
He said that it may have been the Agency's attempts to
protect Ms. Duran after the assassination and the heavy
cable traffic that those attempts generated that led him
to his inference that she was a source of information
for either the Agency or the Mexicans. 773/

Despite LIRING/3's case officer's asking LIRING/3

not to recontact Ms. Duran, Mr. Phillips’ statements, and

Mr. Neiscuir's hazy recollections, the ‘Committee cannot
definitely resolve whether Silvia Duran was a Mexican or

American intelligence agent or source.
(2) was Silvia Duran a Cuban intelligence agent?

In an effort to resolve this question, the HSCA
reviewed the United States investigative agencies’ files
on Silvia Duran. 774/ The Committee found no evidence in
the files that would indicate that Ms. Duran was associated
with Cuban intelligence.

In addition, the HSCA interviewed most of the Mexi-
co City Station employees about the possibility that Duran
worked for Cuban intelligence. Only Barney Hidalgo, a
CIA officer who travelled to Mexico City in 1963, considered
the possibility to be likely. 775/ Mr. Hidalgo, professing
not to remember all the details, stated that he thought

that Duran was a Cuban intelligence agent. 776/ Hidalgo

said:

At the time when this contact told me,of
Silvia Duran I tied the two together, yes,
sir. I don't know, how at that time it
was obvious to me as an intelligence agent
that there was some connection there but
it was of no interest whatsoever to me,
I do remember that when I next saw this
contact of mine I mentioned the fact to
him and let him proceed to do whatever he

wanted to. 777/ : |
Mr. Hidalgo further stated that he never resolved

the issue. 778/
With no corroborating evidence for Mr. Hidalgo's

memory, the Committee must conclude that Silvia Duran

was probably never employed by Cuban Intelligence.

the Cuban government had never been asked to make him

of the Cuban government, asked the Cuban government to
make Eusebio Azcue available for Committee and staff inter-
views. 781/ The Cuban government complied with the Commit-
tee's request on April 1, 1978. 782/

During that interview, Mr. Azcue alleged that the
man Jack Ruby shot in the Dallas Police Station was not
the same individual who had visited the Cuban Consulate
in 1963. 783/ In addition, Mr. Azcue stated that Alfredo

The individual then left: to obtain photographs needed

The man probably returned on September 27, 1963 789T/
with the photographs and completed the applications
in Ms. Duran's presence. 789g/ As the amount of time re-
quired to process this document could have taken as long
as twenty days or the response could have been negative,
Azcue told the man that he could grant him an intransit
visa to Cuba, without consulting his government, if he
had a Russian visa.789h/ The individual then left to
attempt to obtain his Russian visa. 789i/
After the man left the Cuban Consulate, Azcue re-

asked the individual to leave the Consulate. 795/ Oswald
did not revisit the Consulate. 796/

Mr. Azcue described the man who visited the Consu-
late as follows: a white male, between 5'6" and 5'7",
over 30 years of age, very thin long face, with straight
eyebrows and a cold look in his eyes. 797/ Azcue alleged
that he would never have identified Lee Harvey Oswald as

the man who visited the Cuban Consulate in 1963.
2. Alfredo Mirabal Diaz

Alfredo Mirabal Diaz told the House Select Committee
on Assassinations, at a public hearing on 9/18/78, 797A/
the! following:

Lee Harvey Oswald, seeking a visa, visited the
‘Cuban Consulate twice 798/ in September 1963. 799/ Since
Mirabal could not speak English though he was the new Con-
sul, ex-Consul Azcue handled the matter. 800/ On both
occasions there were such loud arguments between Oswald
and Azcue that Mirabal thought that the man's visit to
the Consulate was a case of provocation. 801/

Harvey Oswald's visa application was the same Lee Harvey
Oswald who visited the Consulate. 802/ Mirabel was about
4 meters away from Oswald each time he caught glimpses of
him. 802a/ Oswald was at the Consulate between 15 and 20

minutes on each visit. 802b/
C. Elena Garro de Paz

On October 5, 1964, eleven days after the publication
of the Warren Commission Report, Elena Garro de Paz' story
alleging Lee Harvey Oswald's presence at a party in Mexico
City attended by Cuban government personnel came to the attention

of the Central Intelligence Agency. 803/

1. Elena's story as reported October 5, 1964

Elena Garro de Paz 804/ and Deba Garro de Guerrero
Galvan, first cousins of Horatio, Ruben and Lydia Duran,
were invited to a twist party at the home of Ruben Duran
in the middle of the week in the fall of 1963. 805/ Lee
Harvey Oswald was alleged to have been at this party in
the company of "two other beatnik-looking boys." 806/
The Americans remained together the entire evening and
did not dance. 807/ When Elena tried to speak with the
Americans, she was “shifted" to another room by one of

her cousins. 808/ The memo does not state whether Elena

to the Americans. One of Elena's cousins told her at

the time that (he or she) did not know who the Americans
were except that Silvia Duran (an employee of the Cuban
Embassy and the wife of Horatio Duran), had brought
them to the party. 809/ i

The day after the party, Elena and Deba saw the
three Americans on the Insurgentes, a main avenue in
Mexico City. 810/ The Garros claimed that they had recog-
nized Oswald's photograph when it was published after
the assassination. 811/ Silvia Duran's arrest “under-
lined the Garros' certainty" that the man had been Lee
Harvey Oswald. 812/

The source of the memo was a witting 813/ Central
Intelligence Agency asset known by the cryptonym LICOOKIE/1
whom the Committee identified as June Cobb Sharp while
reviewing the LICOOKIE file. According to Elena, Ms.

Cobb was sent to her house shortly after the assassination
for a few days, by a mutual friend, a Costa Rican writer
named Eunice Odio. 814/ Ms. Garro asserted that while

at her house, Ms. Cobb expressed interest in the Kennedy
assassination. 815/ One night, Elena's sister Deba, who
was visiting, got drunk and told the whole story. 816/
Claiming to be a CIA agent, Cobb suggested that Elena and

Deba go to Texas to tell their story. 817/ Elena stated
that when Cobb's suggestion was rejected, Cobb stated
that she would arrange a meeting with the CIA Station
Chief. 818/ The meeting did not occur because Ms. Cobb
was asked to leave the Garro house evidently because
she kicked Elena's cat. 819/ A notation on the memo says
that LICOOKIE/1 never regained contact with Elena Garro
de Paz. 820/

The LICOOKIE memo was not inserted in either the
Elena Garro or Lee Harvey Oswald "P" 821/ (personality)
file but in a local leftist and Cuban project file. The
Committee learned about the memo from Wx-7241, a chrono-
logical history of the Oswald case prepared by Raymond
Rocca for the CIA in 1967. The memo was found in Decem-
ber, 1965 by Stanley Watson. A marginal notation on
Wx7241 says, "Why was this not sent to Headquarters?" 823/
The Committee has been able to determine that the memo

was forwarded to Headquarters shortly thereafter.

2. October 12, 1964 CIA Memo for the Record

her story to Eunice Odio. 824/

The Committee has not been able to determine if
Elena Garro told Ms. Odio the story personally or if
Ms. Cobb related the story to Ms. Odio who relayed it to
“Tichborn." 825/

The story is not as detailed as the 10/5/64 ver-
sion. There is no mention of Deba Garro Guerrero Galvan.
The story, perhaps because it is third hand, differs
from the previous story in two areas: It states that
the party was at the Cuban Embassy, as opposed to Ruben

Duran's; and that Elena talked to a Cuban Embassy offi-

Attached to the memo was a note from Flannery to
the Chief of Station, Winston Scott, which read, "Do you
want me to send the gist of this to Headquarters?" Scott
then noted that the memo should be filed. 826/ The file
indications show that the memo went into the Oswald "P"

file and the Elena Garro "P" file. 827/

Americans. 841/ Elena stated that in the course of

the party her daughter met a young man named "Alejandro"
at the party and danced with him. 842/ He was apparently
quite smitten with the daughter and tried to call her

on several occasions after the party. 843/ The daughter
did not take the calls and as a result "Alejandro" wrote
several letters to the daughter. 844/. Ms. Garro exhibited
two of the letters, as well as a business card which
identified the young man as Ario Alejandro Lavagnini
Stenius. 845/

The letter which Ms. Garro said was the first
written by the young man to her daughter bore the date
September 1, 1963 and the Mexico City Post Office post-
mark dated September 2, 1963. 846/ When this was pointed
out to Ms. Garro she commented that the Communists pro-
bably had facilities for falsifying postmarks. 847/

Ario Alejandro Lavagnini Stenius on November 27, 1964. 848/

fix the date of the party but felt it was probably early
in September because of a heavy rain which occurred as they
were leaving the party about 2:00 a.m. 851/

Lavagnini said that no Americans were present at
this party. 852/ He was familiar with the physical de-
scription of Lee Harvey Oswald because of publicity fol-
lowing the assassination of President Kennedy, but other-
wise had no knowledge of him and had never seen him except
for news photographs following the assassination. 853/

Lavagnini was the only person interviewed by
the Legal Attache representatives who attended parties at
the Duran house in the September-October time frame.

this information was given to the Central Intelligence

reluctant to talk but did. 858/

Elena's story reported here is the same as that
given in the LICOOKIE memo dated 10/5/64, but with more
details. She said that General Jose Jesus Clark Flores
{a friend of Ruben Duran's), Silvia Duran, Eusebio Azcue,
Emilio Carballido. (a pro-Communist writer-friend of the
Durans), and a Latin American Negro man with red hair
(unidentified) were at the party. 859/ A marginal com-
ment by this entry in Wx-7241 says, “How did Elena know
about a red-haired Negro?" 860/ Elena also told Thomas
that she had later learned that “Silvia Duran had been
Oswald's mistress while he was there." 861/ A note by
this entry in Wx-7241 says, "How did Elena Garro know
about Silvia being the mistress of Oswald? This is 1965."
862/ The Mexico City Station did not hear about the
Oswald-Duran "affair" until July 1967 when a CIA asset,

Elena told Thomas that she and her daughter had

"Assassins" and other insults at the Embassy employees. 864/

in the center of Mexico City. 865/ Calvillo kept Elena
Garro and her daughter there for eight days under the pre-
text that they were in danger of being harmed physically
by Communists. 866/ Elena claimed she told Calvillo

her story and that she wanted to tell it to the American
authorities at the U.S. Embassy 867/ but that Calvillo
dissuaded her by telling her that the American Embassy
was full of Communist spies. 868/ Elena said that some
of the other people who had been at the party were taken
to Veracruz where they were "protected" by Governor

Lopez Arias. 869/ She said that Ruben Duran, reportedly
"protected" by General Clark Flores, was very prosperous
and was driving a big car. 870/ Elena also claimed

that Ruben Duran told her months after the assassination
that he was not really a Communist and that killing Ken-
nedy had been a mistake. 871/ Ruben Duran claimed he

had no reason to tell Elena that killing Kennedy had been
a mistake since he had no involvement. 872/

person she has talked to...If memory serves me, didn't
LICOOKIE refer to Oswald and the local leftists and Cu-
bans in one of her squibs?" 875/

The Mexico City Station cabled the information in
Thomas' 12/10/65 memorandum of conversation to CIA Head-
quarters. 876/ The cable reported that Elena's story
would be checked with LICHANT/1, against the production
from the Cuban surveillance operation “and other

6. Charles Thomas' Meeting with Elena Garro on

December 25, 1965

Thomas met with Elena again on December 25, 1965.
On that date, he wrote a memorandum of conversation which
provided a much more detailed restatement of Ms. Garro's
alleged encounter with Lee Harvey Oswald. 885/

Elena admitted that she had spoken to two men at
the Embassy, “presumably from the Legal Attache's Of-
fice." 886/ Elena said that she did not tell them
the complete story because “the Embassy officers did not
give much credence to anything she and Elenita said." 887/

She stated that the party had been at Ruben Duran's
home. 888/ She was unclear about the date of the
party. 889/ She thought it had been a few days before
the Soviet Astronaut, Gagarin, visited Mexico; she thought
that this would put the party around September 2 or 3,
1963. 890/ She believed that the party was on a Monday
or Tuesday because it was an odd night for a party. 891/
Elena could not check her calendar to refresh her memory
at the time of this interview because the calendar was
in a desk that had been stored away. 892/

During the conversation, Elena desevibsd Oswald
and his companions. 893/ The man who she thought was Os-
wald wore a black sweater. 894/ She said he was quiet
“and stared a lot at the floor." 895/ One of his com-

hair and a rather long protruding chin." 896/ The other
companion was also tall, with short, light brown hair
and no distinguishing characteristics. 897/ The three
Americans did not dance or mix with the other guests. 898/
Elena saw the same three men on the street the next
day. 899/

Elena was certain that Eusebio Azcue, Horacio
Duran, Silvia Duran, Lydia Duran, Deba Guerrero, General
Clark Flores and his mistress, a doctor from Dalinde Hos-
pital, a young American couple who were honeymooning in
Mexico, and several other people were at the party. 900/
She said that Ricardo Guerra, whom she claimed converted
Horatio Duran to Communism, and his wife, Rosario Castel-
lanos, were supposed to be at the party but did not at-
tend. 901/

found the hotel, the Hotel Vermont. 917/ Elena said
that she assumed that Calvillo had registered them as rela-
tives or friends from San Luis Potosi. 918/ They stayed
at the hotel until the following Friday, November 30, 1963,
hardly leaving their rooms. 919/
Elena claimed that while she and Elenita were at
the hotel they saw the photos of Oswald and realized
that he had been the man at Ruben Duran's party. 920/
When Calvillo visited them at the hotel, Elena told him
that she wanted to report her story, which she related
to Calvillo, to the American Embassy. Calvillo, however,
dissuaded her by saying that the American Embassy was
full of Communists. 921/ Elena stated that when she
returned home, guards were posted outside her house. 922/
Elena alleged that after she returned home she
saw her sister, Deba Guerrero, who had independetly
come to the conclusion that Lee Harvey Oswald had been
at Ruben Duran's party. 923/ Deba was “terrified" be-

cause approximately two months after the assassination

prior to September 26, 1963 and that no information had
developed that would show that he had not been in New
Orleans in the early part of that month. 955/ The memo

the FBI because Elena's allegations had not been substan-
tiated by it. 956/ The Legal Attache forwarded a copy
of this memo to the Central Intelligence Agency's Mexico
City Station. 957/ A marginal comment made by Raymond
Rocca next to this entry in Wx-7241 says, “How can it
be ascertained that Oswald did not travel to Mexico
prior to early September 1963? There must be some basis
for Elena's reporting." 958/

10. Legal Attache Memo to Winston Scott re Elena's
Allegation that She Had Stayed at the Hotel

Vermont from the Day After the Assassination

Until November 30, 1963

On 10/13/66, the Legal Attache wrote a memo to
Win Scott reporting that a reliable confidential infor-
mant had reported that the records of the Hotel Vermont
disclosed that one “Elena Paz, housewife from San Luis
Potosi," had registered at the Hotel Vermont on November
23, 1963. 959/ She left on November 30, 1963. 960/
The memo said, “The above individual may or may not be
identical with Elena Garro de Paz." 961/ The House Se-
lect Committee on Assassinations has been unable to deter-
mine why the Central Intelligence Agency and the Federal
Bureau of Investigations waited until 1966 to investigate
this aspect of Elena's story.

Charles Thomas' 12/25/65 memo stating "She and
her daughter did not personally register at the hotel.
She thinks Calvillo registered them as relatives or

friends of his from San Luis Potosi, “ corroborates

Elena Garro's presence at the Hotel Vermont. 962/ The

11. ‘Charles Thomas’ September 30, 1969 Letter to

State Department and Legal Attache's Response

No further report on Elena's story was generated
until 1969 when Charles Thomas was “selected out" of the
United States Foreign Service. 964/ At that time, he
wrote a memorandum to the Secretary off State which in-
cluded a cover letter stating, “Since I was the Embassy
Officer in Mexico who acquired this intelligence informa-
tion, I feel a responsibility for seeing it through to
its final evaluation." 965/

Charles Thomas' memorandum stated that “he got
no reaction from Nathan Ferris and Winston Scott" regard-
ing his memorandum of December 25, 1965. 966/ In addi-
tion, Thomas wrote that the only person to speak to him
about the December 25, 1965 memorandum, Clarence Boon-
stra 967/ told him that Oswald had not been in Mexico
on the date given for the party. 968/ Thomas noted that

account, Boonstra stated that the date was wrong and dis-
whissed'the entire affair. 969/

One of the Mexico City Legat Officers, Nathan
Ferris, in reply to Thomas' letter and memorandum, asserted
that Thomas' office had been advised by memoranda dated
December 27, 1965 and February 23, 1966 that since Elena
Garro's allegations had previously been investigated
without substantiation, no further action was being taken
concerning her recent repetition of those allegations. 970/
In its report, the Legat's Office concluded that either
the Counselor for Political Affairs did not route the
memoranda to Charles Thomas or that Thomas did not re-
call receiving them. 971/

Thomas wrote that when he went to Nathan Ferris’
office to inform him that Elena had found her calendar 972a/
and had reconstructed the date of the party as late
September, Ferris replied that Elena had given the late
September date when she had originally reported her story
at the American Embassy. 972/ Thomas noted that Ferris
explained that someone who had been at the party had
stated that there had not been any Americans in attendance. 973/
Thomas wrote that he had assumed that Elena could have

clearly been mistaken about the identity of the Ameri-

some Americans. 974/ Thomas wrote that Ferris had sug-
gested that it was not necessary for Thomas to pursue
the matter since he considered the Oswald case closed
and had heard all the rumors before. 975/

The Legal Attache's reply to Thomas' memo stated
that Mr. Ferris had not told Thomas that someone who was
at the party had stated that there had not been any Ameri-
cans present. 976/ The Legal Attache's memo asserted
that Thomas had been told that it would not be necessary
for him to pursue the matter any further since Elena's
story had been investigated previously without being
substantiated. 977/ In addition, the memo stated that
Thomas had been told that Elena's story was considered

a closed issue, not that the Oswald case was closed. 978/

reviewed the CIA's, FBI's and State Department's files
on Elena Garro de Paz, Elenita Garro de Paz, Manuel Calvillo,
Noe W. Palomares, June Cobb Sharp, Victor Rico Galan,
Eunice Odio, Sylvia Duran, Lydia Duran, Ruben Duran, Betty
Serratos, Horatio Duran, Eusebio Azcue, and Emilio Car-
ballido. Only the Elena Garro’de Paz file contained in-
formation on her allegations. Though all the names listed
above played a role in Elena Garro de Paz' story, not one
of their files included a reference to Elena Garro de Paz.

Furthermore, the House Select Committee on Assassina-
tions requested and reviewed the Central Intelligence
Agency's LICOOKIE/1, LICHANT/1, LIRING/3, and TICHBORN
files. Once again, not one of the files included a men-
tion of Elena Garro's allegations. The House Select Com-
mittee on Assassinations learned that LICOOKIE/1, who first
reported to the CIA Elena's allegation, was June Cobb
Sharp. 979/ : LICHANT/1 was
Manuel Calvillo who had hidden Elena Garro and her daughter
in a hotel the day following the assassination. 980/
He also told Elena that Silvia Duran had been arrested
before this fact had become public knowledge. 981/

Emilio Carbillido and Betty Serratos. 982/ The Mexican
Government informed the House Select Committee on Assassina-
tions that Elena and Elenita Garro disappeared in 1968
during the student uprisings and have never returned to
Mexico. 983/ The officials stated that Elena and her
daughter might be in Spain. 984/ The Mexican government
reported that Emilio Carballido could not be found. 985/
The others were interviewed between June 1 and June 6,
1978. 986/

Betty Serratos, Lydia Duran, Ruben Duran and
Horatio Duran all stated that Elena was not the dancing
type and therefore did not attend any of the twist parties
at the Duran homes. 987/ When Silvia Duran was asked if
Elena or Elenita Garro ever attended twist parties at the
Duran homes, she recalled Elena attending one twist party
at Ruben's home in 1963 after the Garros returned to Mexico
from France. 988/ All the Durans denied that Lee Harvey
Oswald had attended any party at one of their homes. 989/

The Committee next asked the Central Intelligence
Agency to arrange interviews with LICHANT/1 (Manuel Calvillo),
LICOOKIE/1 (June Cobb), who may have had information related

to Lee Harvey Oswald's trip to Mexico City. 990/ The

Central Intelligence Agency declined to aid the Committee
in this aspect of the investigation. 991/

The Committee returned to Mexico City on August 7,
1978 and attempted to locate June Cobb Sharp and Manuel
Calvillo on its own. 992/

The Mexican government told the Committee that
June Cobb Sharp received a tourist permit, number 72781,
on June 27, 1947 when she entered Mexico through Nuevo
Lardeo. She asked, but was denied, permission to repre-
sent the magazine, Modern Mexico. On June 21, 1948, she
received a coutesy permiet, number 25556. Furthermore,
the Mexican government explained that she disappeared in
1954 and never returned to Mexico. 993/

The Committee believes that this information is
incorrect. According to Ms. Cobb's CIA file, she worked
for the agency as an asset in Mexico from 1961 through
1966. 994/ Elena also stated that Ms. Cobb resided at
her home in 1964. 995/

The Mexican government told the Committee that

Manuel Calvillo had ever resided there. When Committee
staffers gave the Mexican government Calvillo's pen
name, the Mexicans gave the same answers. 996/

The Committee believes that there is a possibility
that Mr. Calvillo lived at this address since it acquired
the address from a recent CIA document. 997/

The Committee believes that there is a possibility
that a U.S. Government agency requested the Mexican govern-
ment to refrain from aiding the Committee with this aspect
of its work. 998/ (See Procedural Write-up Trip 2 Mexico

Duran Navarro, the brother-in-law of Silvia Duran. In
addition, the House Select Committee on Assassinations

spoken to a reporter who allegedly had met Lee Harvey Oswald
at the National Autonomous University of Mexico City 1018/

a fleeting contact with Oswald, had claimed to have known
only about Lee Harvey Oswald's desire to travel to Cuba

A letter from B. J. Ruyle to the State Department

and some fellow students had met Lee Harvey Oswald as
they exited the Cineclub at the Escuela de Filosofia
(School of Philosophy) at the National Autonomous Univer-
sity of Mexico. 1026/ Oswald told the group that he had
gone to the National Autonomous University of Mexico
looking for pro-Castro students who might help him per-
suade the Cuban Embassy to grant him a visa. 1027/
Oswald claimed that he was from California and was a mem-
ber of a pro-Castro group in New Orleans. 1028/ Oswald
remained with the students the rest of that day and even-
ing, as well as the following day. 1029/ The reporter

The State Department forwarded a copy of Ruyle's
letter to the Central Intelligence Agency. 1031/ On
June 14, 1967, CIA Headquarters sent the Mexico City Sta-
tion a copy of Ruyle's letter to Bowles. 1032/ CIA
Headquarters considered Ruyle's report "the first piece
of substantive info about Oswald's sojourn in Mexico"
since the assassination. 1033/ Consequently, Headquarters
cabled that though it understood the source's reluctance
to become involved "the fact remains that this info
cannot continue to be withheld or concealed." 1034/
Headquarters instructed the Mexico City Station to eli-
cit the identity of the source from Ruyle. 1035/ In
addition, Headquarters asked the Mexico City Station to
bear in mind, while interviewing Ruyle's source, that
Lee Harvey Oswald was a homosexual. 1036/ The final
sentence of the dispatch, "It is our hope that the facts
obtained through these interviews will help to confirm
that several of Garrison's allegations about involvement
of anti-Castro Cubans, the CIA, etc. are false," 1037/

pursuing the story.

VII. Analysis of Lee Harvey Oswald's Activities in

Mexico City

A. Introduction

After the Warren Commission published its report
two very important allegations related to Lee Harvey Os-
wald's activities in Mexico City came to the attention of

the United States investigative agencies. In 1964, Elena

Garro de Paz reported that she had seen Lee Harvey Oswald,
accompanied by two other men, at a party at the home of

Ruben Duran Navarro, the brother-in-law of Silvia Duran. 1060/
In 1967, Oscar Contreras Lartigue reported: that he met

Lee Harvey Oswald on the campus of the National Autono-

mous University of Mexico. 1061/

In addition, the testimony of the Warren Commission's
primary witness related to Mexico City, Silvia Tirado
Duran, has been called into question by the critics
throughout the years. 1062/ Some of the information
that is inconsistent with Ms. Duran's original story--
that Oswald visited the Consulate on two occasions which
were the only times she saw him--was available at the
time of the Warren Commission's inquiry although it was
ignored. 1063/ Some of the information has developed
after the publication of the Warren Report. 1064/

The Garro and Contreras allegations, in conjunction
with the inconsistencies of Ms. Duran's story raise three ma-
jor questions: (1) did Lee Harvey Oswald or an imposter
visit the Cuban Consulate in Mexico City?; (2) other
than his visits to the Cuban Consulate, what were Lee Har-
vey Oswald's activities in Mexico City?; and, (3) was
Lee Harvey Oswald travelling alone in Mexico? These

three questions overlap somewhat in detail; e.g., if Os-
wald was not traveling alone, did one of his. companions
impersonate him at the Cuban Consulate? Nonetheless,
each of the three questions will be dealt with in separate
sections below.

In an attempt to answer these questions the House
Select Committee on Assassinations has: 1) interviewed
Mexican 1065/ and Cuban citizens 1066/ who could have
knowledge of Oswald's visits to the Cuban Consulate;
2) interviewed Mexican citizens 1067/ who could have know-
ledge of Oswald's activities and associations in Mexico
City; 3) conducted an extensive review of the files of
the Central Intelligence Agency and the Federal Bureau
of Investigation that pertain to Oswald's sojourn in

Mexico City. 1068/

B. Did Lee Harvey Oswald or an Imposter Contact

the Cuban and Soviet Consulates in Mexico City?

Lee Harvey Oswald himself probably visited the Cuban
Consulate at least once since his application for a Cuban
instransit visa bears his signature. 1069/ Though the

Cuban Consulate allowed visa applicants te take blank

applications out of the Consulate to be returned when
completed, 1070/ Silvia Duran stated she was certain that
Oswald signed the application in her presence. 1071/ Os-
wald's signature on the Cuban visa application, however,
does not by itself rule out the possibility that someone
impersonated Oswald in contacts with the Cuban and Soviet
Embassies.
An analysis of the telephone conversations which

the CIA's Mexico City Station intercepted by tapping the
Soviet Consulate and the Soviet Military Attache's tele-

Phone reveals that someone, later identified by the CIA as Oswald,

visited the Cuban Consulate at least two times and the f

Consulate. In this conversation she referred to an Ameri-
can seeking an intransit visa to Cuba. 1073/ The substan-
tive information given indicates that she was discussing f
Oswald. 1074/ At this time the individual using Oswald's
name already had been at the Soviet Embassy at least once, j
since Silvia requested the name of the Soviet Embassy offi-

stated that the American was, at that time, in the Cuban

Consulate. 1076/ At 4:26 p.m. a Soviet Consular official

returned Silvia Duran's call. 1077/ This official sta-
ted specifically that Oswald had visited the Soviet Con-
sulate. 1078/

On September 28, 1963, at 11:51 a.m. Silvia Duran
called the Soviet Consulate. 1079/ She put the American,
later identified as Oswald, on the telephone. 1080/ The
American, who was at the Cuban Consulate at the time,
said that he had just been at the Soviet Consulate. 1081/
The conversation ended with the American stating that he
was returning to the Soviet Consulate. 1082/

Analysis of Silvia Duran's and Eusebio Azcue's
testimony would tend to indicate that Oswald, or someone
impersonating him, visited the Cuban Consulate at least
one and possibly two additional times on September 27,
1963. Silvia Duran says that Oswald first visited the
Cuban Consulate at approximately 11:00 a.m. requesting
an intransit visa to Cuba with Russia as the final de-
stination. 1083/ Ms. Duran sent Oswald to obtain photo-
graphs that he needed for the visa application. 1984/
Eusebio Azcue recalls that this visit probably. occurred
on the date on the visa application, 9/27/63. 1085/

Ms. Duran also stated that Oswald returned at ap-

proximately 1:00 p.m. with four photographs. 1086/ Eusebio

Azcue also stated that the individual later identified
as Oswald returned to the Cuban Consulate about 1:00 p.m.
with the photographs probably on "the date that appears
on the application, that is to say on the 27th." 1087/
The Committee believes that there is a possibility that
the argument between Azcue and the individual occurred
during this visit. 1088/

Ms. Duran stated that Oswald's third and last
visit occurred in the late afternoon after working hours
on the 27th. 1089/ This visit is confirmed by the CIA's
tap on the Soviet Consulate. 1090/

In addition to the alleged Oswald visits to the
Consulates, there were other telephonic contacts that may
have been between Oswald, or an imposter, and the Consu-
lates. 1091/ Several details about Oswald's visits to
the Cuban Consulate, and telephonic contacts with both
Consulates suggest that the individual involved may not
have been Oswald.

Silvia Duran's description of Oswald did not re-
semble Oswald's true physical appearance. 1092/ This
description, which appeared early in the reporting of in-
formation obtained from Ms. Duran was deleted from subse-
quent reports and was not at all mentioned in the Warren

Report. 1093/ (See Section V, C, for details.) Eusebio
Azcue's description of Oswald was similar.to Silvia
Duran's, but more detailed. 1094/ Perhaps the most re-
markable thing about these descriptions is their simi-
larity to Elena Garra de Paz' description of one of Os-
wald's alleged companions. 1095/

Another possible indication that an imposter may
also have visited the Consulate is the 9/28/63 intercepted
conversation. 1096/ Silvia Duran adamantly denies that Oswald

or any other American visited the Cuban Consulate on Saturday,

of that date, Ms. Duran has either lied to the Committee
or the individual who visited the Consulate on September
28 was not Oswald. 1098/ Ms. Duran, in light of the in-
consistencies detailed in Sections V, C and VI, A above,
May not be the most credible witness, but there are indi-
cations that she was truthful when she stated that Oswald
did not visit the Consulate on September 28. The Septem-
ber 28, 1963 conversation was linked to Oswald because
of the marginal notations made by the CIA translator on
the transcript. 1099/ The translator noted on the trans-
cript that the caller spoke “terrible, hardly recognizable

Russian." 1100/ On October 1, 1963, a man called the
Soviet Consulate and identified himself as “Lee Os+
wald." 1101/ This man also stated that he had been at
the Consulate on Saturday, the 28th. 1102/ The transla-
tor noted that this was the same man who had called the
Consulate "a day or so ago" and had spoken in broken
Russian. 1103/ From this information, and possibly a
voice comparison 1104/, the 9/28 caller was identified
as Oswald. 1105/ The problem with assuming that the
caller on 9/28 and 10/1 was Oswald is that Oswald spoke
fluent Russian. 1106/ Granted, Ms. Duran's denial of
the Saturday visit and the proficiency of the caller's
Russian is not sufficient evidence to conclude that the
person who visited the Cuban Consulate on Saturday and
who called the Soviet Consulate on Saturday and on Octo-
ber Ist was an imposter. Yet the information is suffi-
cient to question the assumption that it was Oswald,
especially in light of Azcue's and Duran's descriptions
and Elena Garro de Paz' allegation.

The Committee notes the possibility, but does not
conclude, that the missing production from the pulse
camera and the LILYRIC base has something to do with the

possibility that someone impersonated Oswald in Mexico.

Three calls that also occurred early on September
27, 1963 may have been by an imposter. At approximately
10:30 a.m. a man called the Soviet Military Attache
looking for a visa to Odessa and was referred to the So-
viet Consulate. 1108/ At 10:37 a.m. a man called the
Soviet Consulate and asked for a visa to Odessa. 1109/
He was told to call back at 11:00. 1110/ At 1:25 p.m.
a man called the Soviet Embassy and was told the Consul
would return between 4:00 p.m. and 5:00 p.m. that day.

While only the callers' requests for a visa to
Russia 1112/ (Odessa) connect these calls to Oswald,
the HSCA believes that they do fit logically into a time
sequence created by what is known from testimony and the
electronic intercepts about his actions on that day.
For example, the following is a reasonable possible
chronology of Oswald's actions on 9/27/63 based on analy-
sis of the available evidence. Oswald probably arrived
in Mexico around 10:00 a.m. on September 27. 1113/ By
10:30 Oswald had time to arrive at the Hotel del Comercio
and to place a call to the Soviet Military Attache who
referred him to the Consul. 1114/ The military attache

also gave the caller directions to the Consulate. 1115/

During the 10:37 a.m. call to the Consulate, the caller
learned that he could contact the Soviet Consul at 11:00
a.m. 1116/ This done, Oswald then visited the Cuban
Consulate where he arrived around 11:00 a.m., on his way
to the Soviet Consulate. This meeting lasted only approxi-
mately fifteen minutes. 1118/ Oswald was then sent to
obtain photographs and to the Russian Embassy to get the
necessary Russian visa. 1119/ Oswald returned to the
Cuban Consulate around 1:00 p.m. 1120/ At this point he
had his encounter with Azcue and completed his application.
Oswald realized at this point that he would have problems
obtained the visas. 1122/ After this visit to the Cuban
Consulate, which lasted approximately fifteen minutes 1123/
Oswald tried to contact the Soviet Consul whom Oswald
claimed had assured him that he would have no problems
obtaining a visa. 1124/ Hence, the 1:25 call. 1125/
During this conversation Oswald learned that the Consul
would be in that evening between 4:00 p.m. and 5:00 p.m. 1126/
Oswald returned to the Cuban Consulate at 4:00 and Silvia
Duran called the Soviet Consul on his behalf. 1127/
Hence, the 4:05 and 4:26 p.m. calls involving Duran. 1128/
But there is a problem with attributing the first

three calls area! eek 27, 1963 to Oswald. The conversa-

tions are all in Spanish. With the exception of the
testimony of bia decmene evidence indicates that Os-
wald did not speak Spanisinm Hence, either the above
detailed calls were not made by Oswald or Oswald could
speak Spanish.

There is not enough evidence firmly to conclude
that some one did impersonate Oswald in Mexico. On the

other hand, the evidence is of such a nature that the

possibility cannot be dismissed.

C. What were Lee Harvey Oswald's Activities in

Mexico City?

When the Warren Commission wrote about Lee Harvey
Oswald's activities in Mexico City, it concluded:

The Commission undertook an intensive investi-
gation to determine Oswald's purpose and acti-
vities on this journey, with specific reference

to reports that Oswald was an agent of the Cuban
or Soviet Governments. As a result of its investi-
gation, the Commission believes that it has been
able to reconstruct and explain most of Oswald's
actions during this time.

By Saturday, September 28, 1963, Lee Harvey
Oswald had failed to obtain visas at both

the Cuban and Soviet Embassies. From Sunday,
September 29, through Wednesday morning, Octo-
ber 2, when he left Mexico City on a bus bound
for the United States, Oswald spent considerable
time making his travel arrangements, sightseeing
and checking again with the Soviet Embassy to

learn whether anything had happened on his
visa application. 1131/

Subsequent to the Warren Commission's Report,
the allegations of Elena Garro 1132/ and Oscar Contreras
Lartigue 1133/ came to the attention of the United
States investigative agencies. The main allegation of
both these people, that they met Lee Harvey Oswald
in Mexico City, remains to this day without direct corro-
boration. Yet the Committee feels that it cannot dis-
miss these allegations without giving them any considera-
tion.

The testimony of Silvia Duran and the Cuban Consu-
late Officials Azcue and Mirabal place Oswald's last
contact with the Cuban Embassy on Friday evening, Septem-
ber 27, 1963. 1134/ The transcripts from the CIA's wire-
taps on the Soviet Consulate place Oswald's last visits
to the Soviet and Cuban Consulates on Saturday morning,
September 28, 1963. 1135/ Oswald's last telephonic
contact with the Soviet Consulate came on Tuesday, Octo-
ber 1, 1963. 1136/ Oswald's activities on the days be-
tween September 28 and October 1 are not clearly recorded.
The Warren Commission speculated that he spent most

of this time sightseeing and making travel arrangements. 1137/

It is entirely possible that Oswald did spend some of
his time during this weekend sightseeing and making
his travel arrangements. It is also entirely possible
that, after his failure to obtain his visas on Saturday,
September 28, that Oswald did not give up completely
and did attend a party where he would have come into
contact with the Cuban Consular officials and, later,
sought help from pro-Castro students.

It is entirely possible that Ruben Duran had a
“twist party" on September 30, or October 1 1138/ as
Elena Garro has claimed. Ruben, Horacio, Lydia and Silvia
Duran all admitted that they frequently had twist par-
ties in 1963. 1139/ Only Silvia Duran recalled Elena
Garro attending any of the "twist parties" at the Durans'
home. 1140/ She recalled Elena and Elena's daughter,

Elénita, attending one twist party at Ruben's home in

ay

1963. 1141/ The other Durans adamantly denied that Lee
Harvey Oswald had attended a twist party at one of their
homes. 1142/

Many of the details of Elena Garro's allegations
have not been, or cannot be, corroborated. For example,
Elena's allegation that some of the people who had been

at the party were taken to Veracruz under the protection
of Governor Lopez Arias 1143/ has not been verified. Ruben
Duran denied that he had ever discussed the assassination
with Elena Garro. 1144/ Eusebio Azcue denied that he

had discussed President Kennedy with Emilio Carballido

at a party at the Durans' home as alleged by Elena

Garro. 1145/ The Committee has not been able to verify
whether or not guards were posted outside of Elena's

home in 1963 as she claims.

But other details of Elena's story are very credi-
ble. Perhaps the most striking is the suggestion that
Oswald's relationship with Silvia Duran was more exten-
sive than just the business contacts in the Cuban Consu-
late. 1146/ Another detail is the manner in which Elena's
allegations were handled, and the manner in which this
Committee's attempts to investigate those allegations
have been frustatred. 1147/

In 1965 Elena Garro reported that Silvia Duran
had been Oswald's mistress while he was in Mexico City. 1148/
In‘'1967 this report was confirmed by a CIA agent who
talked to Silvia Duran. 1149/ The CIA Station did not
consider the information significant and told the agent
to end his contact with Ms. Duran. 1150/ If that informa-

tion is accurate, then that Silvia invited Oswald to
a party would not have been surprising. Silvia Duran

6 admitted that the Mexican police had questioned her on
this point but denied that she had had an affair with

g Oswald. 1151/ Ms. Duran denied having any extra-marital
affairs while she was married to Horacio Duran. 1152/

6 This denial is not consistent with evidence of her reputa-
tion at the Cuban Consulate. A CIA penetration agent
there reported to his case officer that all that would

6 have to be done to recruit Silvia Duran, whom he referred
to by using the Spanish word for whore, would be to get

g a blond blue-eyed American into bed with her. 1153/

There is also CIA information that indicates that Silvia

6 Duran had an affair with a Cuban Ambassador to Mexico
in the early 1960's. 1154/

The HSCA attempted to interview the CIA penetra-

g tion agent about Ms. Duran. 1155/ An interview with the
agent was also desired so as to attempt to verify whether

6 Elena Garro had created a disturbance at the Cuban Embassy
on November 23, 1963. 1156/ The Committee's attempts

October 13, 1966. 1158/ Ms. Garro claimed that she had

- 255 -

been held there by Manuel Calvillo whom she believed
worked for the Mexican Ministry of Government. 1159/

In 1963, Mr. Calvillo was an unwitting asset of the Central
Intelligence Agency. 1160/ Ms. Garro claimed that she
told Mr. Calvillo her story on November 23, 1963. 1161/
Yet the CIA Mexico City Station did not receive a report
from Calvillo on this matter until November 24, 1964, the
same day that Elena first told her story to American of-
ficials. 1162/ For these reasons it was felt that

Manuel Calvillo could well be a key to determining the
veracity of Ms. Garro's story. The Committee's attempt
to interview Mr. Calvillo were also frustrated.

There is also circumstantial corroboration of Ms.
Garro's allegations regarding June Cobb Sharp. For exam-
ple, Ms. Cobb was indeed a CIA agent and she did file
the first report of Ms. Garro's story. 1164/ It should
be noted that this first report was accurate in its detail
in that Ms. Garro's story remained essentially the same
in subsequent repetitions. Ms. Garro claimed that she

kicked Ms. Cobb out of her house. 1165/ There is a nota-

access to Ms. Garro. 1166/ The Committee attempted to
obtain an interview with Ms. Cobb, but was once again
frustated. 1167/

Reviewing the manner in.which the CIA Mexico City
Station and the Legal Attache's office in Mexico City
handled Ms. Garro's allegations reveals that, at best,
her allegations were handled in an irresponsible manner
because they were dismissed after a superficial investi-
gation. The first report that came to the CIA was mis-

filed and forgotten. 1168/ The Legat, after talking to

whom she said may have been at the party. 1169/ The
manner in which the official American community handled
Charles Thomas' reporting is detailed in Section VI, C,

Garro's story had been largely ignored by the American
officials in Mexico:

It would appear that whereas the FBI has
discounted the Elena Garro allegations,

the CIA is still considerable disturbed

by them. The CIA may not have pressed for
further investigation, however, for a num-
ber of reasons: 1) considering the sensi-
tive overlap and subtle competition between
two intelligence collecting agencies, it
had to yield to the FBI's clear jurisdic-
tion; 2) there are obvious complications

It is possible that after Oswald's attempts to obtain
a visa by the first method were frustrated on Saturday,
September 28, that he made one final effort to locate
someone trusted by the Cuban Consulate to vouch for
him.

There is no direct evidence about how Oswald
could have learned of the pro-Castro group at UNAM.
There is a possibility that Ernesto Leffeld Miller,
a friend of the Durans who borrowed Horacio's car often
took Lee Harvey Oswald to the campus of the National
Autonomous University. On the days when Lee Harvey Os-
wald allegedly visited the Consulate, Mr. Miller did also.
It is possible that Silvia Duran asked him to escort
Oswald to the campus. Mr. Miller denied having ever
met Oswald. 1174A/ Oscar Contreras says that Oswald
first contacted him as he was leaving a round-table dis-
cussion at the school of philosphy. 1174/ It is known
that, in 1963, the Durans were close friends with the
Chairman of the Philosophy Department at UNAM, Ricardo
Guerra, who held seminars on Kant, Hegel and Marx in the
Durans' home. 1175/ It is possible, if Silvia Duran had

more than just a purely business relationship with Oswald,

staff that Victor Rico Galan had, at one time, been
arrested on political charges but that he was subse-
quently pardoned by either Diaz Ordaz or Luis Eche-
varria. 1199/ The Mexicans said that they were search-

by the HSCA.

The Mexican officials also offered their obser-
vations orally on the preliminary interviews conducted
the previous day. They pointed out that they found it
strange that Silvia had told Oswald he could not travel
while in Cuba. They wondered what Duran was trying to
tell Oswald and whether she thought that Oswald had
some objective in going to Cuba other than that ascribed
by the popular version. They also considered the manner
in which Silvia obtained employment at the Cuban Consu-
late unusual. Generally they noted that Silvia and
her brothers seemed to have almost programmed responses
and a defensive demeanor. They pointed out, however,
that all the Durans had been very interested in talking

to us. In their opinion, Ruben Duran was the most

credible of those interviewed by the HSCA the previous

day. Classification:

number is 545-9947. The landlady at his apartment explained
to the Mexican officials that Mr. Alberue had. left town
hurriedly on Monday, August 7, 1978. Mr. Martinez, wishing
to know when he returned, had placed a piece of scotch tape
on the bottom right edge of his door. Mr. Martinez explained
that he checked it every four hours and would notify us if
Alberue returned before we left.

Manuel Calvillo (LICHANT 1) did not live at Cauhtemoc
877-5 as the Committee had stated. The landlady for the
past twenty-five years at the apartments told Mr. Martinez
that Manuel Calvillo had never resided there. Committee

which would be forwarded to the Mexican officials the

Appendix 5: Biography: Elena Garro De Paz

Elena Garro de Paz was born of Spanish parents in
Puebla, Mexico on December 11, 1917. (ani information in
this section culled from Biography Data form prepared by
Charles Thomas.) Ms. Garro attended the National Autonomous
University of Mexico and later did graduate work at Berkley
in California and at the University of Paris. In 1963,

Elena had long been married to Octavio Paz, a career
diplomat who is also one of Mexico's finest poets and leading
intellectuals. When Octavio was named Mexican Ambassador

to India, the couple separated by mutual consent. Elena's
daughter, also named Elena, has always resided with her
mother.

Since Elena spent seventeen years of her early life
in Europe she had a rather un-Mexican objectivity about her
native land and had a reputation for being one of its more
articulate detractors. At the same time, Elena was considered
emotionally committed to many aspects of Mexican life and

made an important contribution to its artistic development

In the 1960's Elena became a significant writer.

Hogar Solido, El Rey Mago, La Senora en su Balcon, Ventura

Allende, Andaise por las: Ramas, Parada Empresa, and El Viaje

are plays that have had appreciative audiences in Europe,
where they were translated into German, as well as in Mexico.
Ms. Garro's short stories are collected in a volume called

La Semana de Colores. The Literacy Supplement of the London

Times has called her novel, Los Recuerdos de Porenir, “a

splendid success." Critics have said of her: "For Elena
Garro, there is no frontier between reality and fantasy;
in _ case, the latter is a second reality--perhaps more
intense--to which one may penetrate without passport or
forewarning, thanks to the effectiveness of a literature
fired with passion, flavor and life." Many people who
knew Elena have asserted that the frontier between reality
and fantasy is also difficult for her to distinguish in
real life. (Biography Data Form on Elena Garra de Paza

arm of the Partido Reformista (PRI). Because Ms. Garro
was a tireless propagandist and agitator on behalf of
the poorer Mexican peasants, she was on close personal
terms with and enjoyed the respect of peasant leaders
from all over the country. (Ibid. )

Elena was considered a witty, urbane and opinionated
woman with an unflagging sense of humor. Her forthright
opinions and sharp wit tended on occasion to ruffle feathers
in Mexico, but her important social, literacy, and political
connections rendered her fairly immune from serious cunter-
attack until 1968. Then, Ms. Garro was forced to flee the
country with her daughter, Elenita and her sister, Deba
Guerrero de Galvan, in the midst of the student strikes.

The House Select Committee on Assassinations has been unable
to determine the exact reason Ms. Garro had for fleeing
Mexico.

Before her disappearance from Mexico, Elena was well
disposed toward the United States and had been friendly
with Embassy officers. Her broad range of significant
