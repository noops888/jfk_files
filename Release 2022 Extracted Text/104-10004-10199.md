Ve Diseover Lee OSWALD in Mexico City

CIA a44 produce que very significant piece of infornation on Lee ~
EWALD before he shot President Kennedy. On 1 October 1963, our Mexico
oo City Station intercepted a telephone call Lee OSWALD sade frou someplace
in Mexico City to the Sovlet Eubassy there, using his own name. Speaking
broken Rusaien and using his true nase, OSWALD was talking te the Embassy
guard, OBYEDEOY, whe often enswera the phone. OGWALD said he had visited

_the Bubassy the previous Saturday (28 Septenber 1963) end eponen to a

ee

eee a “anything
pew." The guar€ said 1f the consul was dark it was (Valeriy Viedsirovich)
KOSTINGY. ‘The guaté checked with somsone else end sald that the message
head gone out but no anewer had been received. He then himg up.

This plece of information was proguced from a telephone tap center

which we operate jointly with the office of the President of Mexico. It

is highly secret and not known to Mexican security and lew enforcement
efficials, who have their own center. Our joint center produces creat
masses of telephone intercepts which are transcribed and reviewed by our

s@all staff in Mexico City. By 9 October, the OSWALD telephone converan-

tion of 1 Cctober had been transcribed and a summary of it cabled to

i Washington. ‘The name Lee OSWALD meant nothing special to our Mextco
City Station, but in their report they did judge him te be an American
i male.

_ The cabled report was received in Washingten on 9 October and checked

the Seviet Embassy in Nexice City was probably the Lee OSWALD who had
Gefected to the Soviet Union in 1959 end returned to the USA in 1962. On

10 Octeber 1963, the day after the report fram Mexico City, CIA Headquarters

sent out a cabled report about Lee OSWALD's phone call to the soviet
Embassy; the report went to the PBI, the Departeent of State (because
OSWALD was a US citizen), and to the Mavy Departwent (because he was a

former Marine.) The cabled report to these agencies highlighted the



13-00000

LikLibso’ that the Lee OSWALD mentioned was probably the former defectar.
A copy of thie cams cable was delivered by hand to the Immicration and
Neturalisation Service, with which ve have no cable link. The same day

a leng cable went cut to Mexico City informing our Station of the back-
ground of defector Lee OSWALD and asking for more information. Our Station
was instructed to pass its information on the phone call to the Mexico
City offices of the FBI, the Eubessy, the Raval Attache, and the Imuigra-
tion and Heturalization Services. This was éone.

In ite original report of 9 October, Mexico City had seid it had a

1 October 1963, the day OSWALD phone there. A very sensitive operation
in Mexies City provides us with secretly teken photographs of many but not
all visiters to the Soviet Bubasay there, taken with telephote lenses.
Accordingly, we cabled the Navy Deyertment on 2h October 1963 asking for
& paotograph of Lee COWALD fros his Marine Corps days so we could compare
photes. We hed not received this photogreph by 22 November 1963, but in

i any event, it tuned out that the man photographed outside the Soviet

Eubessy was not OSWALD anyway. As chance woulé have it, none of our
several photo obsemtion points in Mexico City had ever taken an identi-
fiable pieture of Lee OSWALD,

Our Mexico City Btetion very often produces infermation like this
on US citisens contacting Soviet bloo exbasafes in Mexico City. Frequently
the information we get is extreusly incriminating, and on one ar tivo
socasions we have even been able to apprehend end return to the USA
Averican military persounel who are attempting to defect. In all such

cases, our Headquarters desk requests and obtains the special permission ef

citizen to other covernsent egencies. Derogatory information on Amaricans
is not treated routinely; in each case the DDP or hia Assistant personally
scrutinize the infermmtion, make sure it is credible, and decide whether and
to whem 2t will be passed. Only in absolute emergencies is the Kexico City
Station authorized to pass euch informmtion directly to the FBI office in |

the U.S. Entasay.

At this writing (13 December 1963) we do not know what ection the PBL



13-00000

and other egencies way have taken based on our report. We cursise thet the
FRE my have made local checks through Mexican eutherities to see if
Lee OSWALD was actually in Mexico City on 1 Ccteber. Indeed, later in-
vestigation has confirmed ell the details of his trip, where he stayed,
ang what he did. fo avoid crossing lines with the FBI, our Mexico Station
undertook no local investigation ef its ew. As ve now know, OSWALD left
Meatico on 3 October and was no lenver there when our report was put cut.
Since this telephone tap operation is a joint one with the Mexican

Presidency, the Mexicans. aleo bad the 1 Octeber intercept on Lee OSWALD,

22 Hovenber_ 1963

When vord of the shooting of President Kennedy reached the offices
of our operating divisions and staffs on the afternoon of Friday 22 Hoven-
ber 1963, transistor radios were turned on everywhere to follow the .
tragedy. When the name of Lee OSWALD was heard, the effect was electric.

A phone message from the FBI came et about the seme time, neming OSWALD



13-00000

as the pousible assassin and asking for traces. The mesnage wee passed
en at once by the Chief CI, Mr. Angleton, to Mr. Birch O'Heal of his
a Special Investigations Unit. Mrs. Betty Egoter of this Unit immediately
receguised the name of Lee OSWALD ané went for his file. At the saze
time, Mre. Bustos of the Mexico Desk, who bad written our first feport on
OSWALD on 10 October recoynized the nana from rafis reports enf vent
efter the same file. itr. Reichhardt, Mexico Desk Chief, wae was heme on
leave, heard the news end phoned in a reminder thet we hed something on
CGUALD. While ve were preparing a cable to Mexico City esking then for
Yotce of America brosdenst and cabled to us a reminder of the information
the Station hed sent in an bin.

Vor the next week, @ dozen people in the Agency vere continusualy
engaged in bandMing ineoming messages on the ease, writing reports to be
cabled out, tracing the names mentioned, and researching files. Withina «©
week, 27 enblea reports bad gone out to the White House, the State Depart-

Rest, and the FBI. Many cables of guidance and inguiry had been sent to

our evarseas stations, and many pieces of information on OSWALD and his
wife had been received back. The Mexico City Station researched its
telephone taps very thoroughly end come up with several more conversations
prokably involving OSWALD, but not actually mentioning this name; these

counested him also to the Cuban Consulate in Mexico City. Several Mexicans

were arrested and questioned about bis activities, giving a geod picture
of whet he was really up to. Meny conferences were held with the FBI
Matson officer who asked us for cartain actions and passed us information

[ from the FBI investigation. Oncthe minus side, a hest of fabrientors,

most of which we investigated. ALL of these are seon discredited, but they
are still coming in.
H During this phase of our work, wo served primarily in support of the
FBI, which was entrusted by the President vith the major responsibility for
the investigation. The FBI was teo busy to supply us with much of its a
own information, but answers were given te specific questions we posed to

assist our investigation. the Departuent of State did photograph ite entire

Sovist Consular file on OSMALD which hed been publicly given by the Soviet

Attorney General Katsenbech invited us to review the FBI's conprehensive
repert en the case te make sure our sources ware not jeopardized and that
our information was correstly quoted. We found the report highly
interesting an@ no threat to eur eccurity, as long as it was read only

A particulerly sinister aspect of OSWALD's dealings with the Soviets

in Mexico City arises from the liklikood that he met vith Soviet Consul

Valeriy Viedisirovich KOSTINDY. In his 1 Gcteber phone call to the

Soviet Exkasey, the quatd OBYEDKOV suxgestes that the Congul OSWALD kad

talked te vas KOSTIKOV if he was dark. OSWALD seems to agree with this,

but the identification fe very casual. In his 9 Novedber letter te the

y in Waskingtea,
with as “KOSTIN,” but there ie no persen of that exact nase in the Soviet
Bsbessy in Mexico City. KOSTINOV 1s accredited as « Consular Attache and
doen actually do « let of consular vork, but he is believed te be a
Soviet KGS officer, and it is believed that he vorks for Department 13 of
the KGB, the Departwent charged with sabotage and ascagsinations. Tue
sispicion that KOSTIKOY is e KGB officer arose from his work habits, and

hie association with other KGS officers. It wae hardened when it was

found that he handled a Soviet egent vho was trained te do sebotage
work and that he tursed this agent ever te another KCB officer vio is
definitely know to vork for the 13th Departuent. It is generally true
in KGB work that sabotage agents ere handled only by 19"Departaent
officers.

Enbassy guard Ivan Ivanovich OBYSDXOT is himself beliaved te be a
KGB man from previous essigumnte as a bodyguard aad sureilant. But
unless some direct evidence of Boviet complicity is discovered, it is

most Likely that OSWALD's dealing with KGB men OBYSDKOV and KOSTIKOV was

savlg le ear

Soviet habit of placing intelligence wen in the Eubassies in positions
where they receive a large partion of the visitors and phone calls. All

of the five consular officers in the Seviet Embassy are know or suspected
intelligence officers. Certainly if OSWALD had been a Soviet agent in
training far an assassination assigment or even far sabotage work, the 2
Soviets would have stopped hin frou making open visits and phone calls to

the Soviet Enbassy in Mexico after ke tried it a couple of times. Our

experiance in Mexieo, studying the Soviet intelligence service at clese
Tenge, indicates that they do make sous mintakes and ara sometimes insecure
a im their methods, but that they do not persist in such glaring errors.
Bome insight on the Cuban attitude toward the arrest of Silvie DURAN
ana the involvement of the Cuban Consulate in the OSWALD case can be
gained from tvo intercepted phane calls made between Cuban President
Osvaldo DORTICOS and Cuban Ambassador to Mexico Joaquin HERWAMUEE Armes on
