THE VEW Li

A. Inc Campus. Ribicils - The Deciino of SOS As A Signiticant Force

The 1909 SDS Chriago convention irreparably split the organizi-

tion, for several years the spuarhead of the student radical move-.

Dedication to participatory democracy was

forgotten

. in a

power struggle between existing iscoiogical blocks.

Intoxicated by

victories achieved in part through violence at Columbia and Harvard,

ard misreading the conniurent of students who participated in campus

(he vast mazority were not dedicated revolutionaries) one

faction subsequintly centified as the Weathermen, sought after the

convention io emerge fron their campus cocoon as a full fledged rev-

olutionary force.

3Y guerrilla warfare they hoped to topple selected

existing

institutions of the capitalist system, if not the government

itself.

The second faction to emerge, Maoist and rigidly Marxist -

the Progressive Lahories - contemptuous of campus guerrillas as

"elitist" but committed

to a sonetime in the future revolution, held

that the time was not row, and that revolution could only be brought

about with support fIon blue collar workers.

The Revolutionary Youth

Movement, the third force, quickly disintegrated:

Each group by ukase

read the other out of SDs.

Disunity, the fatal disease of extremist

movements, is for SDS now in its terminal stage.

Or. Sunday, December 27, 1970 some 500 delegate members of the

PLP faction arrived in Chicago for what may'be SDS's last convention,

and a rank and fije increasingly disenchanted with violence,.un-

The four-day get-together, marked by more

acrimonious and seenirgly endless debase, stressed the need for fur-

ther missionary work among the working class. Attendance - down to

200 for the

concluding day - resembled a wake more than a convention.

Onetime SDSers and those who might have become involved with the

prototype SDS, now opt for membership in 10-15 member collectives or

cadres, ephemeral in duration

and vague of purpose.

The Trotskyite Young Socialist Alliance,

dedicated, doctrinaire,

disciplined and dull,

is emerging as the largest (5000) and most co-

hesive campus revolutionary group. Opposed to "picking up the

gun,

they are-determined to make

"every university a Red university;

YSA lacks the SDS popuiar appeal of a few years back, and has little

potential as a catalyst for student violence.

and in suppors of prison revolts" she wrote, "constitute the new

agenda."

Removed from scenes of action are schools, and the army

"they cannot do that which is necessary to radicalize people."

While the proposed change in Weatherman action may be nore

tactical than philosophical, it is a fact that many students, pro-

tessing dedication to the necessity of revolution now, have been

shocked by the results of some bombings.

Violence has not brought

about the predicted repression which in

turn, it was said, would

bring weathermen mass sympathy and support.

In all probability there

will be a change in the revolutionary weather, for how long we do not

know.

C. Campus Demonstrations - Winter Hibernation?

Spring, the traditional season for campus disturbances,

is some

months off.

Accordingly despite a marked lull in protests

since

September it may be premature to dogmatically state that a major

polarizing student offensive against U.S. Indo China policy or some

form of "Establishment" authority is not in the cards. Student domin

pression, are planning massive anti-war rallies on April

May 5th in Washington and other large cities.

Both endorse a G.I.

protest against the war scheduled for Armed Forces Day (May 16th).

than" The National Student Association, now considerably more leftist

•previously, is. formulating pians for yet another anti-war rall!

to publicize the

signing of a "peace treaty" by U.S., Saigon, Nuf

and DRV students.

Yet there are discernible signs that a national student protest

of such magnitude and intensity capable of polarizing the nation to

the extent that did the May 1970 dimonstrations is only a slight

possibility,

barring an event wit! the emotional charge of a major

military adventure in Indo China.

The Kert State killings had a

sobering effect on siudents, particuiarly the realization that it

could happen on their campus.

The senseless killing at Wisconsin

and other random bombings have undeniably diminished the romance of

violence as a condition precedent to a revolution which, incidentall!

now no longer seems inevitable o necessary.

Current strategy dictates working with and through' "the system" despit

a measure of stuient radicalization brought about by anti-war and othr

protests.

The push today is for environmental reform. And not to be

discounted is the fact that the vast majority of college students star

with their parents in middle America. After years of strife, they set

determined to get on with getting an education.

THE PANTHER LICKS HIS WOUNDS

As criminal trials in New York City and New Haven, Connecticut ar

proceeding against leading Panther functionaries and some rank and fil

police are conducting what in military parlance is called "mopping up

operations" against local headquarters

in various parts of the country

(Since the beginning of Panther-police confrontatións, some 500 Panthe

rank and file have been ayrested. Leader Huey Newton, at liberty on

bail, co-founder Bobby Seale, incarcerated, and party theoretician

clariage Cleaver, a fugitive

from justice presiding over the Party's

international headquarters in Algiers, all have become uncharacteristi

cally mute.

And whatever excitement their pronouncements once were

able to generate for the benefit of the Panthers has abated. The blaci

community has failed to rally around.

Financial

support from white liberals and the "radical chic," un-

der devastating attack from many quarters, has all but ceased.

Exposès

of the diversion of money collected for the once appealing frec break-

fast program for ghetto youth to other purposes has also hurt.

A withering attack by Eldridge Cleaver on the Communist Party USA

for "active collusion" with "U.S. fascists" in using the Angela Davis

case. as a "smokescreen to conceal the trial of Bobby Seale" will fur-

ther disrupt what was at best a marriage of political convenience.

Potentially more painful, however, than any other recent develop-.

ment is the precipitous loss of Panther prestige attributable to the

recent debacle heralded as a National Convention to Rewrite the Con-

co.

The Background

For a variety of reasons, not the least of which are the violence

of their revolutionary retoric, their image as a group with internal

discipline, and possessing the

"machismo" to "shoot it out" with the

police, the Black Panthers were internationally proclaimed by various

self-professed white revolutionaries as being the vanguard of "the

Revolution."

Panther leaders very wined, dined, and fussed over in

"Skip" Malone and Connie Mathews were official delegates to the

18-21, 1969 subvented in part by the Communist Party U.S.A. The

Socialist Workers Party pledged its "full solidarity" with the BPP.

SDS, despite huniliating rebuffs, embraced the Panthers, and SDS

founder Tom Hayden publicly endorsed the concept of a revolutionary

coalition of Panthers and white revolutionaries enunciated by El-

aridge Cleaver.

On November 26, 1970, J: Edgar Hoover,

appearing

before the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee, testified that "Arab

guertillas reputedly are heavily subsidizing the Panthers.!:." Wide-

spread publicity was given the November 1970 offer by the Black

Panthers to the Vietcong's Liberation Armed Forces to send fighting

troops to aid in. the struggle against U.S. imperialism.

Clearly, the Panthers had preempted the American field as a

swashbuckling, gun toting, "committed to the revolution" force,

¡dolized hy the majority of America's white radicals and extremists.

If their self-proclaimed "Marxism-Leninism" was diluted and sonothing

less than 99

and 99/100% pure, it was of no import.

By default, if

for no other reason, the

Black Panther Party had in fact become the

vanguard of the American Revolution.

The Constitutional Convention •

Some 6,000

people, 50% of whom were white, net in a spirit of

brotherly love in Philadelphia over the Labor Day weekend under

Panther auspices, ultimately to roar approval for a draft of a "new

constitution for

revolutionary people."

Work was to be completed at

a second Constitutional Convention in Washington over the November

28th weekend, and approximately 4,000 faithful if not disparate dele-

gates, some from far away, consisting of Weatherman, SDSers, Chicanos,

Young Lords, Gay Liberationists, and

assorted revolutionaries, again

mostly white, came prepared to pay à $10.00 registration fee as a

prelude to creating a historic document.

The Convention was dooned

from the outset. Efforts to secure a convention hall - first the

Washington Armory, then the Howard University auditorium - were un-

successful: Nothing appeared organized or structured to the purpose

of the meeting. Delegates wandered around Washington in aimless

old ghetto youths; Loss of the vanguard role; coming as it does, is a

severe set back for the Panthers, affecting the nature and extent of

dire straits will in all probability now take a long hard look before

THE TEMPLES OF ISLAM - A DURABLE INSTITUTION

With all the fanfare over the Black Power movement, the curiosity

created by Black Nationalisn, the publicity bestowed on

ephemeral al-

beit electrifying figures such ás

Stokely Carmichael and Rap Brown

and the excitement generated by the Black Panthers, the Black Muslims

have been all but ignored.

Long a potent force in the black community, the Temples of Islam,

better known as the Black Muslims, are one of the most stable, cohesive

black movements in the ünited States and its leader Elijah Muhammad one

of the most powerful black men in America.

Background

The Chicago based Nations of Islam, characterized by J. Edgur.

Hoover as the

"largest black extremist group in this country,"

teaches and preaches violent hatred of whites under the tutelage

and dictatorial controi of the wizened, sickly 74 year old Elijah

Muhammad, accepted completely by his followers as the authentic

contemporary voice of the Prophet Johammad.

Assiduously tithing

fron his followers (no reliable infornation is available as to Black

Muslim membership, with estimates varying from 10,000 to 100,000) he

has forged a powerful enterprise consisting of farm lands, equipment,

manufacturing establishnents, retail shops and real estate believed

have a net worth in excess of $50 million.

years there has been a gradual but perceptible enlargement of Black

Muslim concerns. Initially an ingrown, self-centered movement it is

now if not overly active on the world scene "it is at least passingly

concerned with geopolitics. A pro-Hanoi posture is now manifest in

wuhammad Speaks, the official Muslim newspaper. Of late there has

been

some cautious preliminary

University of Pennsylvania in May 1969 under

cals in attending the Labor Day 1970 weekend Revolutionary Peoples

Constitutional Convention held in Philadelphia under Black Panther

auspices (relationships with the Black Panthers are ill-defined;

while they speak no evil of the Panthers, neither do they praise

them.)

Further evidence of a gradual breakout from their traditional

isolationism and self-containment was the appearance by a Black Mus-

lim minister from Harlem at the Congress of African People meeting in

that the participating Muslim leader Louis Farrakhan drew an enthusi-

astic response "far greater than that accorded other black figures

who have spoken at the international congress."

Geographically dispersed with 120 Mosques from coast to coast

and regular radio broadcasts over more than 50 outlets and a news-

paper vigorously promoted on streets, subway stations and bus stops

THE NEO FASCISTS

A. Klan Kapers

As is the case with other nationwide. right wing extremist. nove-

the. Klan hangs on, with just chough activity to sustain oryan-

izational life.

United Klans of Anerica Imperial Wizard Robert Shul-

don, released from jail about a year ago, has been making strenuous

efforts to rebuild on the foundation of

the old Klan. A tireless

traveler, Sheldon has been on the lecture circuit, making radio and

television appearances (as the nation's #1 Klansman he apparently

warrants being put on exhibition) and meeting regularly with local

klavern leadership.

. The United Klans remains the largest in a still

highly fragmented Klan led by ambitious and competing Imperial Wizards.

Latest (March 1970) official estimate by FBI puts total Klan member-

ship at about

5500.

. But there are

recent stirrings, motivated by a

desire to capitalize on left-radicai inspired violence. Klan activity

has been apparent in Pennsylvania (North Philadelphia, York and Bucks

county) , Atlanta, Georgia, Wilnington, Delaware, North Carolina,.

Michigan and Florida.

On November 29th Alabama's Lieutenant Governor elect Jere L.

Beasley addressed the United Klans national "klonvokation" in

Birmingham, Alabamu and U.S. Senator James B. Allen in a telegram,

expressing

regret at his inability to attend because of his wife's

illness, pledged his continued

fight against the "Federal bureaucracy."

In early January, the Florida Klan (affiliated with the U.S. Klan)

conducted a vigorous orgunizing campaign in the Tampa area. ' Grand

Dragon John Paul Rogers, seeking to eradicate the night riders' ter-

rorist image, described

the klan

as i "Christian Crusade dedicated to

honoring the American flag, revering the Bible, destroying Communism,"

and "upholding White supremacy."

Rogers boasts that "within a few

years we'll be so strong that without our endorsement, no candidate

will 'stand a chance."

B. Minutemen Minutiae

With the surfacing in Washington, D.C. last December of 46 year

old George Van Ness, self-described East Coast leader of the Minute-

men, it became apparent that a split in the once monolithic Minute-

man

organization was in the making.

Never more than 5000 strong

nationally (present total membership ig believed to number 200) the

organization was run by founder Robert DePugh with an iron hand, and

card carrying members throughout the country were loyal to him.

For

the past few yoars DePugh has had troubles with Federal authorities,

and for 17 months was a fugitive from justice.

Taken into custody

by Federal agents in July 1969, DePugh was ultimately tried, convicted

and on October 9, 1970 sentenced to nine concurrent Federal prison

terms of 10 years

each on nine counts of violating Federal firearms

regulations.

Van

Ness, in

that the Minutemen would henceforth

a Hyattsville, Maryland news conference, declared

he would be the liaison between the

remain underground, and the general public.

Van Ness declared that

the organization still was preparing to thwart a Communist takeover;

that paramilitary maneuvers

"in the mountains" were still an integral

part of their training regimen; and secreted away for future use was

ammunition, two mobile field hospitals, four communications vehicles,

and machinery for an "intelligence network."

The new Minutemen credo

will avow their belief in white supremacy, with blacks and Jews

put.

on notice that

they would have to earn the right to equality.

Van Ness' Minutemen organization is in opposition to the apparatus

left behind by DePugh to carry on until his ultimate release from

prison.

Spokesman for the still loyal to DePugh faction is 25 year old

Balert Taylus, i momer at the nine man Minutomon Axeenlivo Council and

De Pugh, while a fugitive, was groping for a "philosophy" for the

of progressive education, and the sophistry of modern Christianity."

His quest ended with the discovery of "Imperium," the Francis Parker

Yockey anti-Semitic tome embraced by most of today's more erudite neo

Nazis.

The contending factions of the remains of the DePugh organizatio

seem destined to go their own route. Both'seem to endorse hostility

toward Jews.

Organizational meetings have taken place on college campuses in

62 campus chapters.

NYA publishes a monthly tabloid type newspaper

Attack ("'to serve as an agitational and recruiting tool among young

AmeriCans, mainly university students") with a claimed circulation

of 25,000

and a monthly newsletter Action with a claimed circulation

of 4,000.

In addition to membership recruitment, current emphasis is on the

welding together of "hard hitting action units" which will participate

in rallies and demonstrations and if need be physical confrontation

with campus left-wing radicals, and undertake the mass distribution of

racist,

anti-Semitic propaganda. A "Western Destiny" bookstore just

in Washington, D.C. stocks for mailorder, and over the counter

sales, books, tracts, and pamphlets. Inventory consists of anti-

Lionist, pro-Nazi and racist material, a portion of which was taken

over from the now closed bookstore maintained by the late Lincoln

Rockwell's National Socialist White Peoples

Party.

Recent issues of Action have become stridently anti-Semitic. The.

Fall 1970 lead article was headlined "Mideast War Next Vietnam for

of the Washington Post (January 6, 1971) stated that: "The NYA opposes

Zionism in America because Zionists, in their self-centered pursuit of

their own, extra-American goals, have not only shown a callous disre-

gard of American interests in favor of Zionist interests, but they have

habitually been willing to adopt anti-American policies

whenever this

suited their aims."

Of late NYA has been beset by internal difficulties, with some

defectors seeking to create a competing organization.

Byers, now as-

sisted by former American Nazi Party Iieutenant Robert A. Lloyd, remains

as the dominant influence.

The significance of an NYA lies in the fact that for the first time

in recent history, a canpus based, neo-Nazi movement is in existence.

It remains to be seen if this ultra-rightist group organized to combat

left-wing excesses can survive in its new form as a neo-Nazi, anti-

Semitic force on the college campus.
