a The Background

For a variety of reasons, not the least of which are “the violence
of their revolutionary rhetoric, their imagé as a group with internal
discipline, and possessing the "machismo" to "shoot it out" with the
police, the Black Panthers were internationally proclaimed by various
self-professed white revolutionuries as being the vanguard qf "the
Revolution." Panther leaders were winced, dined, and fussed over in
Pyongyang, North Korea, by an obvious government sanctioned group, a
"Committee for,the Peaceful Unification of the Fatherland." ene Party
has been lavishly praised by Maoist China, and eagerly courted by the
Russians. Arab guerrillas entertained visiting Panthers and reports

with and eljcited praise from Al Fatah representatives. Panthers .

European based Third World Peoples Liberation Struggle, and were

coalition of Panthers and white revolutionaries enunciated by El-
dridge Cleaver. On November 26, 1970, J. Edgar Hoover, ap earing
before the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee, testified that "Arab
‘5 guerrillas reputedly are heavily subsidizing the Panthers.{ en Wide-
“7 Spread publicity was given the November 1970 offer by the Black
“\ Panthers to the Vietcong's’Liberation Armed Forces to send fighting
: troops to aid in. the struggle against u. Se imperialisn.

Clearly, the Panthers had preempted the American field as a
“ swashbuckling, gun toting, "committed to the revolution" force, ae
idolized by the majority of America's white radicals and extremists.
If their self-proclaimed "Marxism-Leninism" was diluted and something
jess than 99 and 99/100% pure, it was of no import. By default, if
. for no other reason, the Black Panther Party had in fact become the
vanguard of the American, Revolution.

: ~Some 6,000 people, 50% of whom were white, met in‘a spirit of
ay love in Philadelphia. over ‘the Labor Day weekend under
Panther auspices, ultimately to roar approval for a draft of a "new
constitution for revolutionary people." Work was to be completed at

a ‘second Constitutional Convention in Washington over the November
28th weekend, and approximately 4,000 faithful if not disparate dele-
gates, some from far away, consisting of Weatherman, SDSers, Chicanos,

‘prelude to creating a historic document. The Convention was doomed

from the outset. Efforts to secure a convention hall - first the

successful. Nothing appeared organized or structured to the purpose

of the meeting. Delegates wandered around Washington in aimless
confusion, some to attend hastily scheduled impromptu meetings. many
to return home without participating. in uny activity at all. -The

The Chicago based Nations of Islam, characterized by J. Edgar
Hoover as the "largest black extremist group in this country," a
“teaches and preaches violent hatred of whites under the tutelage
and dictatorial controi of the wizened, sickly.74 year old Elijah
Muhammad, accepted completely by his followers as the authentic ~_
contemporary voice of the Prophet Mohammad, Assiduously tithing
from his followers (no reliable information is available as to Black
Muslim membership, with estimates varying from 10,000 to 100,000) he —.
‘has forged'a powerful enterprise consisting of farm lands, equipment, ~
manufacturing establishments, retail shops and real estate believed
to have a net worth in excess.of $50 million. Within the past few
yéars there has been a gradual but perceptible enlargement of Black
Muslim concerns. Initially an ingrown, self-centered movement it is
now if not overly active on the world scene “it is at least passingly
.concerned with geopolitics. A pro-Hdhoi posture is now manifest in
Muhammad Speaks, the official Muslim newspaper. Of late there has
een some Cautious preliminary contact with white radical groups,

while they speak no evil of the Panthers, neither do they praise

“ isolationism and self-containment was the appearance by a Black Mus- .
lim minister from Harlem at thé Congress of African People megting in .
2.) Atlanta, Georgia on September 6th, the latest ina series of annual
“. Meetings on black power first heid in 1966. Nedspaper accounts note
that the participating Muslim leader Louis Farrakhan drew an enthusi-
lastic response "far greater than that accorded other black figures
who have spoken at the international congress."

Geographically dispersed with 120 Mosques from coast to coast
and regular rddio broadcasts over more than 50 outlets and a news-
- paper vigorously promoted on streets, subway stations and bus stops

dedicated, and exemplars of a ciean, moral life, the Muslims are
respected in America's black cormunities. What they say about non-
doctrinal matters has impact deysad the Temples of Islam membership.

A Cause for Concern

Since the Suez crisis of 1956, the Black Muslims have shown ‘an
increasing sympathy foc Acabs wath whois they adentaty both aS blacks
and Muslims as against white, 37o-Anerican Israel and Zionist ex-

_that brutalities of the Israeli government have been finally admit-

Holy Cities have been turned into Sodoms and Babylons. :

Recent news stories allege that Egyptian Moslems in the UAR re-

Israel and the United States call: for the death penalty of hijackers
until Zionists are caught. Editorials proclaim that Zionism is a.
corrupt form of nationalism, that it is financed by and run in the |
interests of the greedy white financier-miljtarist-industrialist and

‘s THE NEO FASCISTS

: As is the case with other nationwide. right-wing extremist. yove-
ments, the Klan hangs on, with just enough activity to sustaip/organ-
izatfonal life. United Klans of America Imperial Wizard Robert Shel-
don, released from jail about a year ago, has beén making strenuous

“efforts to rebuild on the foundation of the old Klan.” A tireless

‘traveler, Sheldon has been on the lecture circuit, making radio and

"television appearances (as the nation's #1 Klansman he apparently
“warrants being put on exhibition) and meeting regularly with local

: ‘klavern leadership. The United Klans remains the largest in a still

a highly fragmented Klan led by ambitious and competing Imperial Wizards.
Latest (March 1970) official estimate by FBI puts total Klan member-

“ship at about 5500. But there are recént stirrings, motivated by a
desire to capitalize on left-radicai inspired violence. Klan activity
has been apparent in Pennsylvania (North Philadelphia, York and Bucks
County), Atlanta, Georgia, Wilmington, Delaware, North Carolina,

: Michigan and Florida. Some measure of political respectability ac-
crued to the Klan when the Michigan American Independence Party, sup-
porters of George Wallace, nominated the State Grand Dragon as its
Candidate for. Secretary of State in.last November's elections. (A
Klansman was a candidate for Pontiac's City Commission, but.withdrew
because of what he described as "tnreats.") :

. With the abet onan in Washington, D.C. last December of A6 year
old George Van NeSs, self-described East Coast leader of the Minute-
men, it became apparent that a split in the once monolithic Minute-
man organization was in the making. Never more than 5000 strong _
Nationally (present total membership is/ believed to number 200) the ~
organization was run by founder Robert DePugh with an iron hand, and
‘card carrying members throughout the country were koyal to him. For.
the past few years DePugh has had troubles with Federal authorities,
and for 17 months was a fugitive from justice.. Taken into custody «© °.
by Federal agents in July 1969, DePugh was ultimately tried, convicted
and on October 9, 1970 sentenced to nine concurrent Federal prison
terms of 10 years each on nine counts of violating Federal firearms
“regulations. ae : eae : eceeenot E

Van Ness, in a Hyattsville, Maryland news conference, declared
. that the Minutemen would henceforth be independent of DgPugh, and ‘that
he would be the liaison between. the membership, which hé said would
" remain underground, and the general public. Van.Ness declared that
the organization still was preparing to thwart a Communist takeover;:
that paramilitary maneuvers "in the mountains" were still an integral
part of their training regimen; and secreted away for future use was
ammunition, two mobile field hospitals, four communications vehicles, .
and machinery for an “intelligence network." The new Minutemen credo -
:. will avow their belief in white supremacy, with blacks and Jews put.
on notice that they would have to earn the right to equality. :

Van Ness' Minutemen organization is in opposition to the apparatus
left behind by DePugh to carry on until his ultimate release from
prison. Spokesman for the still loyal to DePugh faction is 25 year old
Boho i aomember of the nine man Minutemen -Bxecutive Council and
editor of On el, Che urficral pukttcation, with a claimed distribu
tion of 4000077 ~~ . : pee

Recently Taylor has concentrated on recruiting, and claims par-_
ticular success in the St. Louis atea. (Minutemen headquarters remains

in DePugh's hometown, Norborne, Missouri). Taylor stresses that the
Minutemen are now a youth oriented organization, and that although
weapons and explosives were "still part of their training" Minutemen
are under strict orders to refrain from acts of violence "at this
time." ca ie

DePugh, while a fugitive, was groping for a "philosophy" for the
“movement ," and for those who, like himself, had "somehow escaped’ the
brainwashing of the cstabiishment controlled news media, the horrors
of progressive education, and the sophistry of modern Christianity."
His quest ended with the discovery of "Imperium," the Francis Parker

“* CAMPUS JUGEND' - . ee ee

Tooling up for a counter attack against an*anticipated spring,
leftist inspired campus offensive, the now patently anti-Semitic
National Student Alliance has moved into larger national headquarters
at 1656 Wisconsin Avenue in Washington's historic Georgetown, section,

Founded in the spring of 1969 by’ then 37 year old Louis

_ of the 1968. "Youth for Wallace" movement; and a featured speaker at

_the- gutter-bigot National States Rights Party annual conventjion this
past summer, the NYA is closely allied with Liberty Lobby, one of. the
‘largest and most effective ultra-rightist pressure g#oups. Liberty
Lobby officials admit assistance to NYA in its foymative stages.

cipant in organized hate movements, and Austin Abp. former professor
‘or the Nazi regime in
Germany, all are or have been involved in Liberty Lobby activities,
and all, with the exception of App, are patently anti-Semitic. A
four man student "Advisory Council," whose precise role is as yet un-

announced, but presumably, together with the Advisory Board, deter-
mines NYA policy. :

_Byers' plan for a campus based organization was originally con-
ceived as a vehicle to mobilize cadres of rightist students on campus
to "crush" radical leftists. NYA evolved into a movement with a four
point program: (1) To oppose the.use of dangerous drugs and narcotics



“and to run those who push them off the campus; (2). To neutralize and

i
!
i

overcome Black Power; (3) To restore law and order to the campuses
and to America by stamping out anarchist groups and movements and (4}
To bring peace to America by resisting any attempt to involve us in a
foreign war. (Emphasis has been on the Middle East. rather than

Indo China).

Organizational meetings have taken place on college campuses in

-New York, Pennsylvania, Illinois and California. Byers claims, ex-

aggeratedly perhaps, a nationwide membership of more than 8,000 from
62 campus chapters. NYA publishes a monthly tabloid type newspaper
Attack ("to serve as an agitational and recruiting tool among young
Americans, mainly university students") with a claimed circulation

- of 25,000 and a monthly newsletter Action with a claimed circulation.

"of 4,000.

In addition to membership recruitment, current emphasis is on the
welding together of “hard hitting action units" which will participate
in rallies and demonstrations and if need be physical confrontation

“, with campus left-wing radicals, and undertake the mass distribution of
. racist, anti-Semitic propaganda. A "Western Destiny" bookstore just .

opened in Washingtaqn, D.C. stocks for mailorder,and over the counter
sales, books, tracts, and pamphlets. Inventory consists of anti-
Zionist, pro-Nazi and racist material, a portion of which was taken ~
over from the now closed bookstore maintained by the’late Lincoln mee
Rockwell's National Socialist White Peoples Party.” :

: Recent issues of Action have become stridently anti-Semitic. The.
Fall 1970 lead article was headlined "Mideast War Next Vietnam for
U.S.," with a sub-heading "Zionist Trap To Become New Slaughter of

1, American Youth," and featured alleged Zionist atrocities stories,

grotesque and anti-Semitic cartoons. Byers, in a Letter to the Editor’

“of the Washington Post (January 6, i971) stated that: "The NYA opposes
. Zionism in America because Zionists,.in their self-tentered pursuit of

their own, extra-American goals, have not only shown a callous disre-

. gard of American interests in favor of Zionist interests, but they have

habitually been willing to adopt anti-American policies whenever this

“ suited their aims."

“2/71

“Qf late NYA has been beset by internal difficulties, with some
defectors seeking to create a competing organization. Byers, now as-~-
sisted by former American Nazi Party lieutenant Robert A. Lloyd, remains
as the dominant influence. : aie

The significance of an NYA lies in the fact that-for the first time
in recent history, a campus based, neo-Nazi movement is in existence.
It. remains to be seen if this ultra-rightist group organized to combat
left-wing excesses can survive in its new form as a neo-Nazi, anti- -
Semitic force on the college campus. - .
