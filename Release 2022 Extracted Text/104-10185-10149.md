The three operational de-

Legal Centers (Contros Legales - NS). Illegal

(Ilegal), and Natiónal Liberation (Liberacion Nacional - LN);

the last two were formerly a single department, known as NA

(Intclligence)..

All three departments handle operations abroad

for the purpose of collecting information on the host country,

promoting Cuban political aims, and conducting subversive ac-

tivities.

Their operations are distinguished by two factors,

legal connectiors and Communist Party-leftist group liaison.

The Departmen: of Legal Centors is responsible for operations

conducted through Cuban official missions in countries with which

Cuba has diplomatic relations and has normally nothing to do with

illegal agents. The other two departments handle illegal agents,

both in countries with which Cuba has relations and in those with

which she has none.

• The Illegal Department has no connection

with Communist Parties or organized leftist groups abroad; the

National Liberation Department deals mainly with such parties

and groups; the Department of Legal Centers may work with them

or unilaterally.

All three departments are organized in geo-

graphical divisions with area

desks for each country within

their respective fields

or

responsibility; there is thus some

overlapping in desk coverage.

The DGI has two types of overseas intelligence operations (as

selected from all parts of the DGI organization; no distinction

is made,

for example, between officers from

the Illegal Depart-

ment and the National Liberation Department, but each person

assigned

overseas performs whatever duties

requires.

Field starion chiefs report directly to PINEIRO, but

administration goes through other

channels,

as explained below.

Field

stations valy

depending

on local objectives and

the quality of diplomatic relations.

In Soviet Bloc countries,

for example, field stations are usually small, with only one or

two officers, who have no intelligence collection or similar

responsibility but are ciarged principally with aiding travelers

to Cuba and with liaison with the local intelligence service.

In countries outside the Soviet Bloc, legal field stations have

various responsibilities; in Latin America, their principal ac-

tivities are promotion and direction of subversion and sabotage

and arransements for suerrilla warfare.

The largest field

station is in Mexico, which is important because it is a major

transit point for both personnel and materials, and because it

is a contact point for any lottist organization of any country

which has representatives in Nexico.

Operational Support Departments.

The operational support departments of the DGI are Technical

Operational Support (NI). Illegal Centers (MO). Special Schooly

(FE), and Information Services (SI). Ther handle such functions

as spotting prospective agents, providing operational information,

training both intelligence agents and guerrillas, providing chan-

destine communications between headquarters and agents in tho

field, procuring operational funds and supplies, etc.

The Department. o5 Illegal Centers (Departamento Centros. Ilegales' -

N0).

The depariment is not. as

its name implies, concerned

with

operation of illugal field stations, but is an information col-

lection and agent candidate spotting department. It has three

major responsibilitles:. collection of information from foreigners

visiting Cuba; assessment of visiting foreigners for candidates

for intelligence agents; and screcning of letters from abroad

volunteering

information, both to extract any useful data and to

assess the wilters as possible candidates for intelligence

use.

'Among visiting foreigners, the MO Department does not concern it-

self with diplomats, they are left to the DSE; nor with foreigners

who are established residents of Cuba, who are the responsibllity

of the Colonial Burcau

In debriefing foreign v1s1-

tors, the department often works through ICAP, which makes arrange-

ments for many visits to. Cuba; in many instances,

the visitors

supply

information unwittiugly and are never aware that they are

in contact with Cuban

intelligence.

The MO Department does not

itself recruit agents; it only

watches for, screens, and evaluates

foreign contacta as agent candidates.

If the persons it selecte

are mombers of a

Conmunist Party or leftist organization. they

nre referred to the LN Dupartment; if they are not members of
