Estimate for Processing Sequestered

Kennedy Documents

1.

At our meeting on 1 August, you reguested an estimate for

processing approximately 200,000 pages of documents sequestered by

the House Assassination Committee at the conclusion of its

investigation

of the Kennedy assassination.

At this point, with no

certain knowledge of the nature of the documents, our best

estimate

is five years.

2.

We have arrived

at that estimate by making a rough

comparison with the Missing in Action (MIA) case, which contained

66,382 documents:

That case reguired approximately two years for

pre-processing, i.e. to index all documents, remove duplicates,

refer non-Agency documents, remove classified marginal information

and attach addoc sheets to each document.

That procedure required

approximately 17 part-time clerks and analysts.

It is expected that

the MIA case will require an

excess of three years for the

completion of the substantive review.

This will bring the total

processing time of the MIA case to five years.

The substantive

review requires a team of three part-time analysts assisted by

several clerical processors.

3.

Upon receipt of your memorandum authorizing the processing

of the sequestered

documents, we plan to take the following action:

Conduct a survey in Warrenton of the seguestered

documents in order

to determine how the material was stored and in

what order procescing

b." Convert the 75 rolls of

c. Index all documents by document number, date, and title.

• d. Organize the case according to the agreement reached by

your office with the requester.

e. Begin the substantive processing.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT:

Sequestered Kennedy Assassination Records

1.

On 1 august;

OCC requested a meeting to discuss with

us the

processing of approximately 200,000 pages

of documents which had

been

sequestered by the House Assassination Committee in its

investigation of the Kennedy assassination.

The meeting was

attended for OGC by Launie ziebel

and Emilio Jaksetic.

Russ Holmes,

Lou Dube and I represented the Do.

CIA's efforts to have those

documents declared Congressional records, and therefore outside the

scope of the FOlA, failed

when Justice had refused to appeal

an

earlier court decision

declaring these documents to be searchable

under the Mark Allen FOIA request.

For background, the seguestered holdings consist of 75 rolls

of microfilm, each roll

containing 2,400

frames, or a total of

documents contain probably all the material

already processed in the

Oswald case and

in the Garrison investigation.

large number of documents have never been processed.

of these

documents originated from requests by the Committee for name checks

of Cuban and other nationals whose names night have come up in their

own investigation, or in other studies. All this material currently

is stored in the Warrenton archives.

On 4 August, OGC is scheduled to meet at

Justice with the

attorney for Mark Allen, Lasar to discuss the disposition of this

In this connection, the following points will be raised

by OGC in hopes

of reducing the total number

of documents that will

have to be processed:

We shall attempt to have all non-CIA documents deleted

This may amount to about one half of the oswald

documents which

were coordinated with us by

Since other

Government agencie's documents would be available to the requester

outside CIA, they may agree to that stipulation.

Delete all documents that already have been processed

and to a large extent released

in other Kennedy litigations,

particularly those being represented by Fensterwald.

amount to about 2,000 documents which were treated in the Oswald

(1650 documents) and Garrison case (362 documents).

The documents that originated

primarily the notes and memos of staff mombers, would be regarded

outside the FOIA and not be treated.

such documents would not be

OGC will attempt to have deleted from the case all

estimate of the time required to process

material.

For this purpose we were asked to assume that

all documents in this

case would be processed.

He explained that the only case that

nearly approaches the seguestered documents

collecting the information on the MIA case to provide

estimate of time.

The MIA case has taken us thus far

and we expect to take one more year to complete it.

5. We have suggested to OGC that in the context of their

discussion of this case

at Justice, they take some of the following

points into consideration:

a .

Although

a large number of documents are involved in

the seguestered material, no new information regarding the Kennedy

assassination can be

expected.

b.

The tax payer should not be required to spend.

an

inordinate

anount of

additional money on this project in light of

the cost of past investigations into the Assassination by Congress

and other

investigating committees.

c.

To the best of our knowledge,

only one person has

reguested

this material; it hardly can be regarded of overwhelming

interest to the public.

d. Therefore,

we should not waive fees for duplicating

costs, and explore ways of charging for converting the film

into

hard

paper copies.

6. We have reguested OGC to provide us with a memorandum

advising us that the seguestered material can be opened and

processed.
