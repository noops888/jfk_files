1. I checked into the alleged relationship between
Lee Harvey Oswald and the DRE with the following results.

2. The DRE was an anti-Communist student organization
funded covertly by CIA. It was known 2y the cryptonym
AMSPELL, In the fall of 1962, the DRE organization in Cuba
was penetrated and vrapped-up by the DSI. We continued to
provide nominal financial support tg the DRE until September
1966 anc terminated our relationshid completely on amiable

terms 1 January 1967. i

3. According to the Warren Co! sion Revort
(VOL. X, Pgs. 32-50), Lec Narvey Oswald approached Carlos
Bringuier, the New Orleans dclegate of the Cuban Student
Directorate on 5 August 1963 and voluntecred to join the
organization and to help train Cubans to fight against Castro.
Bringuier turned him down believing hin to be either an FET
informant or Comaunist penetration agent. On 9 August
some friends of uringuicr saw Oswald wearing a “ilands Off
Cuba" sign and distributing pro-Castro leaflets, They re-
ported it to Grinquier who angrily accosted Oswald on the
“street. A fight ensued and Brinquier and Oswald wore ar-
rested. On 21 Auqust 1963 the two engaged in a radio debate.
Oswald identified aimself as a Marxist and defended the
Castro cause. Bringuier is referred to later in the Yarren
Commission Report as the New Orleans delegate to the Pevo-
lutionary Student Directorate (VOL. XI, Pg. 159).

4, Tnere is no doubt that the Cornission actually Pv.

was referring to the Student Revolutionary Directorate or %

DRE as we term it, Another anti-Castro erqanization mentioned, X

in connection with the above incident was the Information
Council of tne Americas. According to Paul Oberst, of the
Cuzan Overations Group {COG/CA) CIA did not fund this
organization although we had contacts with some of its mem-

bers.

5. It is abundantly clear that the DRE had no part
in the Kennedy assassination. Oswald was never a member
of the DRE, whica in fact, rejected him. In ‘developing

information regarding poner] relations with the Pr, I con-

ferred withJiowara Srubaxer| the Cuban Operations Group
awno recently~returned from our with our ‘tiami station;

Carl Trettin, Deruty Chicf of the Ceuaterintclligence Branch
of the Cuban Operations Group who knew Dringuier and was
stationed in New Orleans at the tive of the above incidents;
and Margaret Porsythe also of the Cuban desk who is thoroughly

familiar with the DPE operation.
