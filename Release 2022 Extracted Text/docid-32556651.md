Consulate in Chicago.

The Swixx Central Police Bureau noted that

although they had previously recorded ALEX's birthdate

as April 1, 1914, in their records, it is April 1, 1916,

in his passport.

Chicago T-4 advised that he had learned in

May of 1965, that ALEX intended to appeal the banning

by the Swiss Government.

On March 1, 1965, the Police Judiciaire

(Criminal Police), Surete Nationale, furnished the following

additional information in the captioned

matter, which had

been developed by further

investigation:

According to the PJSN (Police Judiciaire,

Surete Nationale), subject registered at the Hotel Bristol,

At that time he gave his date

of birth as April 1, 1916, in Illinois, and presented U. S.

passport B 4019963, which was issued October 16, 1961 at

Chicago, Illinois.

He was accompanied by DIETGARD ROSE MARIE

FUEGER, who was born December 3, 1938, at Seewalchen, Austria.

According to the hotel records, FUEGER was listed as

in possession of French Identity Card RZ 45437, which was

issued August 12, 1961, and her home address was listed as

177 Promenade des Anglais, Nice, France.

It was subsequently ascertained by the PJSN

that through an error at the reception desk of the hotel,

the identifying information was erroneously attributed to

FUEGER at the time she registered.

The PJSN later inter-

viewed THERESE GARELLI, another customer of the hotel at

time, verified that the identity card in question

actually belonged to her, and established that she had no

knowledge of or connection with subject or FUEGER.

stated that subject and FUEGER departed

the hotel on January 20, 1965, for an unknown destination.

On May 14, 1965, Agent TOM MANSON, U.S.

Customs, 610 South

Canal, Chicago, was advised of FUEGER's

departure and requested to be alert for her return.

On

date JACK BURKE, Immigration and Naturalization

Dearborn, Chicago, was also

advised of FUEGER's departure and he stated he would

ascertain whether or not FUEGERs name is still on the

"look-

out list" and take the necessary precautions to have her

thoroughly interrogated upon her return to this country.

The Bundeskriminalamt (BKA - West German

Federal Criminal Police) has furnished the following

information:

A check of the records available through TWA

Airways in Frankfurt/Main, West Germany, failed to reveal

any information indicating that SUZANNE FUEGER arrived by

TWA from New York between May 12 and May 19, 1965. No

passenger lists are maintained on the local flights of

Lufthansa between Frankfurt/Main and Munich, Germany, and

therefore no record on FUEGER could be located for travel

between these points.

Further, FUEGER has not been located

at any hotel in Munich.

Inquiries in Munich have revealed that FUEGER'S

mother, ELSE ROSE FUEGER, sold her house in the village

of Riederau for a sum of 40,000 Marks,

and purchased a flat

at 12 Martha-Braeustrasse, Fuerstenfeldbruck, West Germany.

This is a town in the immediate vicinity of Munich.

Mr. and Mrs. PRASSE, son-in-law and daughter,

respectively, of Mrs. FUEGER, were residing with her in the

house in Riederau, and as of

May 18, 1965, were still in

the house, although they planned to

move shortly to Nuernberg,

West Germany. The inquiries indicated that the sale of

the house led to quarrels in the family.

Police efforts are continuing to obtain some

information regarding FUEGER's activities.

Investigation concerning the return to the

United States by FUEGER last winter in

possession of mink

coats and jewelry resulted in a request to the Police and

Judiciaire

(Criminal Police, Surete Nationale) (PJSN), on

March 24, 1965.

Contact has been maintained with the PJSN

regularly to obtain the results of their inquiry.

Mr. ALFRED GERTHOFFERT of the PJSN advised on

May 24, 1965, that investigation thus far had

failed to

locate

any record of three mink coats and jewelry having

been declared at the time FUEGER entered France.

Mr.

GERTHOFFERT stated that it appears that this material was

not questioned by the French Customs and that no record

was made of it at the time she entered France.

The investiga-

tion is continuing, however, Mr. GERTHOFFERT will furnish

the final results

in the near future.
