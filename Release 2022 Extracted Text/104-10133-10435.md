1. Mr. Cregar, FBI, on 4 December 1963 confirmed that the Subject

is the daughter of William Avery HYDE, SSD-157435â€¢ Cregar was furnished

a copy of two 1957 investigative reports on william HYDE for lead purposes

only and was informed that William HYDE was under consideration for a

covert use by this Agency in Viet Nam in 1957 but was not used. (This

information had previously been obtained from Oscar Sells, CI/SIG).

2. Subject is the individual who is taking care of the widow of

Lee Harvey Oswald and has apparently been quite well known to the widow

of Lee Harvey Oswald and possibly Lee Harvey Oswald for an undetermined

period of time.

The possibility that William Avery HYDE was the father

of Ruth PAINE was previously brought to the attention of Mr. Papich

through Mr. O 'Neal, CI/SIG. The Security File of William HYDE contains

a copy of a 1956 FBI Investigative Report (SECURITY OF GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES)

on Sylvia Ludlow HOKE, aka: Mrs. John I. HOKE, nee: Sylvia Ludlow FYDE, who

is the sister of Ruth PAINE.. The file of William HYDE also contains a 1956

OSI report on Sylvia HOKE.

Avery HYDE and wife Carol HYDE were associates in the late 1920's and

later of Talbot BIELFFHIT, #29931, who is currently employed by this

Agency in FDD. A certain amount of information concerning William HYDE,

Carol HYDE, and other associates of HYDE and BIHLEHIT during the latter

1920's was furnished by Talbot BIFFFFLl during interviews

several years

ago.
