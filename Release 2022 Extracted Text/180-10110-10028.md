ducted on April 13, 1978. We are taking testimony today in th

form of a deposition instead of at a formal Congressional
hearing.

My name is Michael Goldsmith and pursuant to the House

} Resolution 222, I am authorized to take your statement under

oath today.

Before I take your statement concerning the various
questions the committee has of you, let me take care of some
procedural matters.

Are you hear voluntarily today and without a subpoena?

Miss Goodpasture: Yes.

Mr. Goldsmith: Have you received -a copy of the Com-
mittee Rules and supporting resolutions?

Miss Goodpasture: Yes.

a right to receive a copy of the statement that you give us
at a deposition. I am going to ask you to give up that right
to receive a copy of your statement and let me explain to you
why. If you were appearing before the Committee at Executive
Session as you did in April, the Committee Rules do not pro-
vide for you to receive actually in your possession the trans-
cript from the hearings. As a matter of convenience to you

and also because of the Committee's relationship with the

ee

agency, we are taking this statement in the form of a depo-

0 jsition.
The agency has requested us to ask its present and former
employees to give up the right that they have under the Com-

{mittee Rules to receive a copy of the transcript because there

jwas classified information inthe transcript, and for you. to
thave the transcript in your personal possession would be

Tcontrary to security interests. |
Now, I want to make it very clear though that even }
{though we are asking you to give up your right to receive a

copy of the transcrivt, you are not giving up your right to

jget access to the transcript. In other words, you have the
right to read it and we can arrange for that at any time.
We are simply asking you to give up your right to receive a
copy of it. Do you understand that?

Miss Goodpasture: Yes. |

1 Mr. Goldsmith: Certainly.
@ 2 Miss Goodpasture: Can the agency receive a copy of the
transcript, the Inspector General's Office, so that they
would know in case I make a statement which is not true based
on faulty memory. If there is no objection to the Committee,
I would like for some responsible person in the agency to
know what my testimony is so that they could check to see

whether my memory is faulty.

14 [son such as the agency. The agency, if it is interested in

a

I should also add that if the Committee ultimately de-
pends to some extent upon your testimony and uses that testi-

mony to make a finding of fact, we would as a matter of

routine tell the agency in advance and if the agency has a

25 {problem with that, they can get back to us.

Miss Goodpasture: Yes.

EXAMINATION
By Mr. Goldsmith:
Q Miss Goodpasture, who was the Chief of Station in

litexico City in 1963?

A Winston M. Scott.

Q Did you have any special working relationship with
Scott while you were stationed in Mexico City?

A Yes.

Q In what way was your relationship a special work-~

ing relationship?

DocId:32263433 Page 9



1 A Well, I was responsible for the day-to-day handling
@ 2]}some projects that Mr. Scott had the major decisions on and
3jone of those projects was the liaison operations, the one

4 }that is of interest in this investigation.

g 5 Q Which liaison project are you referring to?

& 6 A The telephone tapping operation.

: 7} Q Did people in the Mexico City station and in head-
7 8]jquarters, especially those in Mexico City, consider you to

5 Qibe Win Scott's right-hand person?

10 A Well, now I cannot really answer that and I don't
ll jthink that. there would have been any reason for anyone to have
12 4considered me as nis deputy, which would be the right-hand
13 yperson because he had a deputy then. I had been in Mexico

‘longer than anyone else in the station except Mr. Scott and

jfor that reason, a lot of the people came to me and asked me

5 I saw a memorandum in the files written by Mr. Shaw i
5 jin which he referred to me as "Win Scott's secretary who has
. tbeen down there for a long time," but I never had that posi-
. tion.
RSS Q Now, as you know, Miss Goodpasture, the Committee's
fe investigation has focused in Mexico City in many ways and in

particular on the operations and workings of the Mexico City

station.
Let me ask you this: What was Mr. Scott's reputation
for professional competence, integrity and honesty?
A Well, reputation. To me, I felt that he was honest.
I had no reason to ever believe that he was dishonest. I
think he had a PhD. in history. He had extensive government
service before he was sent-there. He was assigned by the
Director, Mr. Dulles, at the time, over a number of people who
had been in Latin America in posts that they thought would
leave that Chief of Station assignment, so there was no
reason for me to ever doubt that he was highly qualified, in

my opinion. Now, I cannot speak for how other people felt

Q In your personal working relationship with him, did
you find him to be a very competent and honest man?

A Yes. The ambassador called on him almost every H

Q In 1963, tae the Mexico City station the largest
station in Latin America?

A I think Panama may have been the largest in size I
but .I believe Mexico City had the largest number of indepen-
dent operations. Outside of Panama, I think it may have been

the largest station but Panama had the most people.

retirement age, and he would have to have a special authori-
zation to remain longer. So, he decided to quit because he
felt he had already received that authorization and left in a
tiff.

Q So, how would you describe his position towards the
agency when he left?

A Well, at the time that he left, I think he felt
that he wanted to stay on in Mexico, that he was on good re-
lations as far as I know with the Director becausé he was
given a medal and he came up to receive that. The agency
also, I think, was considering using him in an undercover
capacity outside.

Q So although he was initially annoyed by having re-

|ceived this. administrative notice, by the time he left the

jJagency, he was favorably disposed towards it; is that correct?

A I think so. I think he just decided, well, he would

go ahead and retire while the present administration in
|Mexico was still there and they could help him with his im-

|migration papers, which took months to get under a new ad-

ministration, and it would be easier for him to get settled
in and if there was any question in Washington about whether
they wanted him to stay or whether they did not, it really __
didn't matter. I don't know but that is my feeling about
what happened.

Q After his retirement, Mr. Scott stayed in Mexico i

A That also has the Crimea in there.

I think he may have gotten that Crimea from another
transcript, another call that was made by a transportation
agency asking for requirements for a visa to Crimea that was
on the transcripts in between these calls, but we determined
it was not connected with Oswald.

Let me show you CIA Number 183, which is the head-

Henry Oswald and Win Scott apparently drew an arrow and wrote

" underlined, pointing to the middle name "Henry."
Now, the Committee has received testimony that this

notation was made prior to the assassination and we have

here on the one hand a manuscript where Scott says that

Oswald spelled his name slowly and clearly, and we have here

Scott aware apparently that Oswald's middle name was not

Henry. Does that suggest to you that perhaps there was a '

|you have referred to as being in conflict or--let me see if I

transcript where Oswald did spell his name slowly and clearly?

A Well, I don't think so because I saw those trans-
cripts before Mr. Scott did. The way the paper-work ran was
that those transcripts were given to the outside contact who
brought them to me. I looked at them and in case of someone
who was speaking in Russian or a language that the monitors
could not transcribe at the listening post, that one copy
of that transcript and the tape went immediately to the person
handling the other transcriber

In the case of the Soviets it would have been Mr

Manell. Sometimes the outside person could take that tape to
the transcriber but I don't recall any instance when Mr. Scott

saw the transcript before I did and I don't think that he

I remember it.
Q So, in summary, the sections of this manuscript that
can clarify this. |
Are you saying that they are inaccurate because of
cause they conflict with the record?
A Well, I think both.
Q Okay.
A Part of the things that I worked on when I came up

here in February, 1977 I did not remember until I saw the i

files. That newspaper clipping I didn't remember at all |

until I saw it at the hearing

Q And essentially you are indicating that this manu-
script prepared by Mr. Scott is exaggerated?

A In my opinion, it is. The only thing that we could
compare it with is the record of events.

Q Why would Mr. Scott have any reason to exaggerate

these things?

A Pardon me?

Q Why would Mr. Scott have any reason to exaggerate
these matters?

A He had written books for sale and I think that he

probably felt that it would have more sales appeal. That is

jmy guess. He had published. a couple of books. I don't know

how many books. he published but I received a flyer of two
books that he had published and I didn't bother to read
them.

Q So, in essence, then Mr. Scott, whom you have

{characterized to be an honest man, was not telling the truth

{when he read this first paragraph?

A No.
Q Let me read it to you.
"A great deal has been written about Lee Harvey

Oswald, the assassin of President John Fitzgerald Kennedy.

ad 241} Much of what has appeared in print was written by persons

who knew nothing. and who tried to conjure up from some

= 16 | A That is the way it appears to me.

5 74 Also, I would like to say that during the time i
Sli that I was there in my dealings with Mr. Scott, I felt that he
£ 19.jwas fair and honest with me. Now, there were times too when

5 20 jhe exaggerated things that I knew were, exaggerations.

: 21 Q Could you. give an example?

ae 22 : A Yes, I could give you an example. Suspect indi-

saying that went, here was a suspect Soviet agent when the |

25 iperson made their first contact with the Soviets. The second !

lor third or fourth contact they suddenly became known Soviet
@ 2]agents because they had been there so many times. I felt
34that was an exaggeration, that they may have been going there
4} to get propaganda, and I discussed those things with him.
7 5. Q Did Mr. Scott maintain a personal safe?
3 6. A He maintained several personal safes but I think he
a 7 qhad about three or four.
= 8 Q . Where? ~
& 9] A He kept them in the office. Some of them had very
2 10 {sensitive coded materials in them that he had custody of and
Z lljhe dealt directly with headquarters on. Some of those pro-
E 124 jects Iworked on that were not related to this investiga-
s

13.] tion. He also.had.a personal safe in his home.

14 | Q What type of materials did he keep in that safe?
15 | A Well, now I never inspected the materials in that

20 After he died, at the time of his-death, I went

213 to a man who was then Director of Counter-intelligence and

22 4told him that I thought there might be classified documents
in his home.. Some of those documents I was told were later

turned over to the Station Chief and sent back to Washington.

retrieve those documents?
A Yes, he went there to the funeral and I think he
talked to the Chief of Station at that time, Mr. John Horton.
Q After Mr. Scott's retirement, what would he have
been doing having classified materials at that time?
A He had no business having them in my way of think-
ing.
Q Now, the Committee has received testimony or state-

ments from agency employees; one, for example, was Mr. Stan-

Tey Watson. Did you know him?

A Yes.

Q What is your assessment of his competence and
honesty?

A Well, when Mr. Watson and I were in Mexico to-

gether, he was working on projects that I was not related
with. Then he was named deputy, I think, shortly.before I
Teft. I liked him socially but I didn't work with him.

Q How extensive was the "P" file that the Mexico
City station had on Lee Harvey Oswald?

A I would say they were voluminous. Are you refer-
ring to only. Oswald?

Q Yes.

A Or all of them?

Q I am referring to Oswald's.

A

There were several volumes; I am not sure how many.

1 Q Now, Mr. Watson has testified that when he saw the
2] Oswald "P" file it was rather thin and also that within the
34 file he saw a photograph-of Oswald that had been taken in

4.§ Mexico City.

5 I should correct that. He did not testify that;

74 that.

8 A That he saw a photograph of Oswald that had been
9] taken in Mexico City?

10 Q Yes.

ll A Well, I don't think that the Mexico City station

1274 ever made a photograph of Oswald. I think that he may have

13} been referring to the unidentified man but I don’t know.

14 Q . As a matter of. fact, he was shown the photograph of

15 | the unidentified man and he said no, that is not the one he

you know?

Q When they asked you to prepare the history, with
what goal in mind did they ask you to prepare it?

A Pardon me?

Q When they asked you to prepare the history, they
must have explained to you what purpose they had in mind, why
they wanted the history to be written.

, A They didn't ask me to prepare it; I was ordered to
prepare it and it was from a headquarters director

Q When they ordered you to prepare the history, they
must have told you what were important factors to consider in

writing a history. Did they just ask you to write a history

i without giving you.any guidance at all?

A . There.was a historian who was brought in, I think,

| from Michigan, one of the large universities, who had several
‘general discussions about how to write history and how to

1 coordinate material, but there was no one there immediately

| above me with any experience in research or in writing a

] history. I did it mostly on my own.

Q And you do not know why these station histories are
prepared?
A No, unless it was just to make it easy for briefing

material for people who were going there.
Q I would like to show you at this time CIA Number

164 and ask you if you can identify this document?

“of your prior testimony, starting at the top of page 30 and

23

A Yes.

Q What is it?

A This is a background draft that I was asked to writé
when I came to work in Washington for the Inspector General's
staff. They asked me to write down as much as I could remem-
ber or put together from the files which they had of what
had happened in Mexico, a resume.

Now, I was told that this would not be used in any
way except for background information; it would never leave
the agency.

Q When was this?

A The 10th of February, 1977. This is not the histor
of Mexico.

Q . IT understand. The history was prepared in approxi-
mately 1970 or 1971.

A This document, I objected strenuously to its being
used because I want to call attention to the names of people.
Many of these people are serving still, some of them in very
sensitive jobs, and they are not connected in any way with

this investigation. : |

Q No one is using those names, Miss Goodpasture.
A I know but they were released outside the agency.
Q That. is a problem you have with the agency, yes.

z 6j giving this testimony in April?

é 10} they are still valid as far as my memory goes now.

2 13 | A Yes. That second page, in the middle '60's there

Q Is there any of your prior testimony on pages 30
to 31 that I just showed you that you would like to modify in
light of CIA Number 4090 and 4091?

A No, because I think that they told me that they
thought I was best qualified to write that but I don't really
know except that I am sure that the other people did not want
to do it because they didn't want to be sitting here talking
to you and discussing it.

There were many people who could have done it.
The deputy Chief of Station knew more about it than I did. |

Q So, when you wrote this document you were doing it
in anticipation of meeting with a Congressional Committee?

A Pardon me?

Q So, when you wrote this document, you did it in

anticipation of meeting with a Congressional Committee and }

A Yes, because one of the first things I saw when I i
came back to work was the green book that the previous Com-
mittee had prepared.

Q Is this statement in your prior testimony true,

Miss Goodpasture?

Quoting your testimony: "I was told that all of

the people who were there at the time would be interviewed 1

do."

A Yes.

Q So, you were told that?

A I was told that but if I remember it, I think Mr
Leader talked with everyone who had been there and it was
for that reason that I tried to make up a complete list
here of all of these people.

Q And all of those people would be asked to write
a report as you were being asked to do?

A + That was my understanding, yes, that they would be
interviewed.

Q And write a report?

A And write a report or make a written preparation

} of their memory of the events at that time.

Q How many months did you work on this project?

A Well, it was interrupted by my mother's sudden

{ death. I think it was almost three.

Q And you felt that the agency.was going to have
all of these other people spend three months?

A Many of these people were still on the payroll but
the writing of it was only part of it. My main function up
there I felt was to get the files together, help to locate
the files and put them together for review by the Inspector

General's staff when they weré needed by the Congressional

deputies?

“Let me rephrase the question. Upon which indi-
viduals did he tend to rely the ‘most?

"Mr. Shaw: He had one deputy who was Alan White.
As far as reliance on other people, I would say he relied |
very heavily on Ann Goodpasture, not in any way in a command
function, but as a girl Friday."

Miss Goodpasture: I would rather be a girl
Friday than.a right-hand man.

Well, I made more of those statements as those
people saw it in their relationship with Mr. Scott's pro-
jects. They are true the way they saw it but I had no
responsibility outside the projects that we worked on, but '

the CIA, with regard to your testimony here? i

Russell Holmes who told me that he could not locate some
photographs and he wanted me to come up before.I testified,

that I would have to testify. Mr. Leader told me that I

Q After your testimony in April, did you have con-

I said. I didn't discuss the testimony with anyone I recall

over here. I discussed this document with the Inspector

I said, "I want to know why you released that

document instead of the official record copy," and he said

he did not-.release it; it had not been released. Then I said
"Well, you better discuss it with them."

I didn't discuss it with any of the others. I
saw Mr. White in a cocktail bar and he asked me about it.
I told him that I thought he would be called to testify and I
was not at liberty to discuss the questions that you asked.

Q Did anyone else ask you about the questions that

were asked?

A I.don't think so.
Q Did Mr. Breckinridge or his staff?
A I went to Mr. Breckinridge. He is the one I

talked to about these documents because I felt that you didn
have all the files.

Q Did you discuss the substance of your testimony
with Mr. Breckinridge?

A No. I discussed the documents generally but we
did not go. into individual questions. Then I told him that I
didn't think I made a very good impression, and it was a
pleasant experience. oe

stance of your testimony?

were in that meeting, so I think I might have said when I

went into Mr. Holmes' office that it was really rough or

something like that but we didn't go into many details.

Q Have you had any contact with the agency prior to
your testimony today?

A Yes.. I came in Tuesday, called you from the edge
of town. When I arrived at my friend's home she said,
"Someone is trying to call you; his name is George somebody."
The name didn't mean anything to me. The next morning a man
who identified himself as George Joannides called to tell me

that you had been trying to get in touch with me, and I told

-him that I had already talked with you and explained to him

that I had called your office before I left Dallas and I had
to go to.a family funeral.
He said, “That is all I want to know," and I had
no other discussions with him.
Q After your testimony in April, did you stay in
Washington or in Virginia and do-any work for the agency?

A In April, I went back to the agency the following

-day and I talked to Mr. Breckinridge and Mr. Leader, Mr

Holmes. I don't think I went back to the agency again.

Q So, you didn't do any work for them?

A No.

Q No research work, for example?

A No. When I came up before I talked with you, I

Q This duty which is listed as specific duty number 1
is not. an accurate summary then of what your responsibilties
were?
A He said that I was working with Tom Keenan but I
was in the secondary position rather than in the primary posi
tion. That. is what I am trying to say. I had been there so

long and I knew the history of the project

@ Did you establish, for example, the time of the

photo coverage, the scope of the photo coverage?

A I don't think I did. I think that the photo cover-
age had been established by the case officer who first set
it up on the basis it needs. Now, if we knew that someone
might come down there on a weekend, I would run in.and say,
"Tom, have. the boys work all weekend." We would arrange for
other people to be in the area working.

Quite frequently, I went out to the area to work.
Tom went out to the area to work on discounts but every other
case officer did the same thing if they had someone who might
go there.

Q Now,.I don't understand why, if you knew. this
description was inaccurate, you left this document go to
headquarters.

A I think it was made on the basis of trying to get

a promotion for me.

Q Fine. Thank you.
How many.photo bases did the Mexico City station
have surveiling the Soviet Embassy in 1963?

A Three. In 1963, I think they had three.

Q If I’ give you a piece of paper, would you be able
to draw the embassy and indicate the locationof the photo
bases?

A I think so.

.Q Please.

A This is the main building which went something
like this.. That building was located inside a compound
Now over here were other buildings and there were houses
There. In one of these houses--I am not sure now which one--
the photo. base was located in.

Q Let's number each of these bases 1, 2 and 3.

Where was photo base number 1 located in reference
|to the entrance to the embassy?

A This is the entrance right here. It was across
the street on the west

Q Would you indicate on this diagram what the
cryptonyms . were for each of these photo bases?

Are. you certain that what you have indicated as
photo base number 1 was LIMITED and that photo base number
2 was LILYRIC? Is it possible that you have them reversed?

A Well, let's see. After the Warren Commission re-

port, after the unidentified man was released to the public,

j the bases were closed. This building suffered damage.

Q Referring to building number 1.
A There was an old man here.

Q That is in building number 1?
A

j was after I had. nothing more to-do with the project, so that

yhere were moved from this location to this location.

Q So, the people in location number 2 ---

A So that the LILYRIC people who had a cryptonym were
operating first here and then they moved to this location.

Q When did they make that move?

A I don't remember. I don't know.

Q On what floor of the buildings were these photo
bases situated?

A This was a*house.

A That is the reason why it was LIMITED. A two-
story and the top part was used. It was a stone colonial
house and had a shell in-one of the parts of the outside
wall. Anyway, they built a small-room. I believe this was
a one-story house and they built a room up in the attic
but I was never in that building so I am not sure. It might
have been two stories.

Q You are referring to number 1?

A This was one the second or third floor of an apart-
mat building.

This was one the second floor of a small row house.

Q You are referring now to number 3.

A Yes. I think there were four houses there and I
don't remember which number it was in. Jt was in one of the
four. I believe it was number 3.

Q Which of these photo bases did you say was on the
second floor of the building?

A I think this was on the second floor or the third
floor.

A The apartment building.

Q Number 2?

A It was in the apartment building. This was a pri-
vate residence.

why don't you read paragraph B. This is requesting renewal

coverage?

A None that I can see.

A bit of history. It was my understanding that the

reason there were two bases so close.together at that time wag
so that in case something happened to one--if, for instance,
a police van moved up there and sat all day and this one had
to stop work, there would be an alternate or if something
happened, we would have another base that could take over.

Q But norinmally they both would not be working at the
same time?

A I think they were set up in a way that they alter-

nated. They provided the coverage at different hours.

Q It would not really make any sense any other way. j;
A No.
Q Let me show you some documents which seem to be

consistent with that; in other words, documents which seem to
be consistent with your. testimony. I am first going to show ;
you some pages from a document that is a “request for the
approval of a project for the period December, 1960 through i
30 November i961. |

approval of the project for 1961.
A I cannot remember who was--now, this was when?
Puckett was there as case officer before Tom Keenan came in.

Q I understand.
Now, drawing your attention to paragraph B, are the
contents of that paragraph accurate?
A I think so.
Q Now, let's take a look at CIA Number 4063 which is

the request for approval of the project for the following yea

j and I direct your attention to paragraph B-1. Does that

paragraph indicate that there has been no change in the cov-
erage as described in the 1960 request?
A Yes.

Q Now, CIA Number 4055, which is the request for the

| following year 1962. I draw your attention to paragraph B-1

Does that paragraph indicate that td avoid:'repetition the
station is omitting the usual description of the functions of
these three bases and though they contribute to the above
objective? This was described in detail in the 1960 request
for project renewal.
Is that indicated there? :

A It indicates that there was not any change.

Q Finally, this is the request for approval for the
year 1963, CIA Number 4047.

A Now, this is what I was talking about earlier.

Q Well, we have established from these documents that
the hours essentially were all daylight hours and these docu-
ments also indicate that there was Saturday coverage. Oswald
went there on. Friday and Saturday.

A This project outline was a proposal in theory that
the only way that you can determine when they were actually
working would be to take the location and check the logs
because every time they took a photograph, they turned ina
daily report. Every time they made a photograph they put
down the time, the exposure number and what happened. So,
to see when they made pictures, they may have been working an
not made a picture.

Q Well, at.the very least, we see that these docu- |
ments indicate that the station had informed headquarters that
by design these photo bases operate ina complementary manner
and also that Saturday ‘coverage was to be included.

Now, you are saying they may not have been working |
that way in fact but that is what the records indicate?

A That is right. The only way you can tell that they;
were actually working would be to check the logs.

Q Miss Goodpasture, are the logs from the LILYRIC
operation for 1963 available today?

A I believe that some of the LILYRIC logs. were not
in the files when I checked and we thought that they had

been destroyed when the files were reduced in size.

A I don't know but I will say this: That for the sized

of the files, the file room was about four times the size of

this room and you could not walk through there by the time

I left. There was a new Station Chief and he didn't have the

same feeling for all of those records that his predecessor

had had and he had a new staff with him.

When I went back there a few months after I had left

much paper that had been reduced.

was examined and testified as follows:
EXAMINATION
By Mr. Goldsmith:

re) I believe that you have a statement, Miss
Goodpasture, that you would like to clarify for the record
at this time?

A Yes. You asked me earlier if I had been in touch
with anyone from the agency after my last testimony in
April. In July 1978, I believe it was the 15th of July,

a very close friend of mine died, and I came to Washington
just for the funeral. While I was here, Scott Breckinridge
called the house and asked if he could come by and see me.
He and. Russ Holmes. came by, and he said that he wanted

to know where the records were, if I could give them any
information to locate any additional records on the photo-
graphs for Cuban and Soviet embassies. He was mainly
interested in Cuban embassy photographs because he thought
that I had given testimony before that was not consistent
with information in the files.

I didn't recall giving specific testimony on

what basis the report was made that the unidentified man had
been in contact with the embassy on October lst?

According to the log, it indicates he was there on
October 2nd.

A I think that the person that wrote the cable -- I a
not sure who wrote the cable, but I think that when they firs
looked at it, they thought that this was the lst of October,
that everything here was the first of October. He didn't

read the log here.
Q But in the original of that log, I should point out,
that each day is marked off with a red row. i
A. Yes.
fe) We have a. Xerox here which doesn't reflect the
fact that this was actually sort of a multicolored dene

A But. that is the:only explanation I have, just

that it was careless reading.. I don't know.
Q Were you.the person that went and retrieved that i
photograph and made the connection with the date, or wat

it someone else?

A It could have been me or it could have been the
person who sent the cable, but I usually gave copies of the
photograph to the analysts to do whatever they wanted to

with it.

Now, in this particular case, that photograph

. White or Mr. Manell.

could have.been given'to Mr. Scott, 3

Q Why would it have been given to Mr. Scott or Mr.
White?
A Because at the time that we got the intercept and |

we began to look at the photographs, any American that we i
thought we had identified, we passed it to the Chief of
Station and the Deputy Chief of Station, and thé men for
the Soviets, Mr. Manell.

Now, we were not supposed to report on American |
citizens unless they were subjects of ongoing investigation
and we had permission to pass that information to the FBI. qt

guess it was. because of the civil rights thing, but we just

had a standard regulation that we had to have permission from

headquarters to disseminate information on Americans.

Q Do you.recall who specifically found the photograph
of the tnidentified man, the photograph that was mistakenly i
tied to Oswald?

A Pardon me?

Q Do you recall specifically who it was that found
the photograph of the unidentified man, the photograph which
was mistakenly linked to Oswald?

A I am the person that first made the decision that

that man was probably an American. Now, I think Mr. Scott

was the one.who inserted in the cable or sent the message

that it was probably. Oswald, but I don't know. I can't Tr
don't remember who -- how that photograph was’ connected with
Oswald later. It was the only person, the only photograph
in the bunch that could have been a non-Latin that day.

Q Well, let me show you this here. On September 27th
'63, there were two other unidentified American males.

A But these people had been there several times
before. We knew who they were. =

Q How did you know that then?

A Because of that license plate. That car’: had been

there previously.

9 What about the individual on line 13?
A I think that they were Mexicans.
Q There is a notation here which .says this is a

Mexican man, Gutierrez, license plate changed in February

'64 to Mexican, so and so.

A Yes, we identified him and I believe he was in a
travel agency. I am not sure.
Q But was he identified in 1964, or was he still

unidentified as of September 27th, 1963?

A He had been identified, I think, before. TI don't
know, I would have to check. the records to.be sure. I think
that he had been identified through a. previous visit in the
same care with the same Texas plates, and this was another

visit that he had made there.

A This was made by the base house operator. We

Q Now, getting back to the first question that I
asked you.here, you are saying that whoever went to this log
just looked at the top of the page where it said October lst,
and went down the rest of. the page, and assumed that the man
had made contact with the embassy on the lst, even though

he appears under the 2nd.

A The 2nd.

over.a period of many years?

Q Let me show you CIA document No. 4033, which was

a contact report, and I would like to ask you.to read paragrap

No. 4.
(Pause) ;
A Okay.
Q Now, according to this document, a CIA source is

providing information that Oswald may have had sexual affairs
or relations with Sylvia Duran.

Do you recall when. the first time was that this
type of information concerning Oswald and Duran came to the
attention of the Mexico City Station?

A No.

My only connection with Sylvia Duran that I recall
was the Mexican police picked her up after the assassination
and interrogated her. The man who obtained the interrogation
report gave them to me to carry back. to the office. That '
was George Munro whom you mentioned earlier with Mr. White. 1
He handled that outside project. He was the outside case
officer.

Q Did he give you the interrogation report or did he
give you. transcripts as well?

A I.don't remember because I think that he only
gave me the interrogation reports in Spanish, and I think
Dave Phillips had someone do the translation.

He may have given me the initial report and then

Qo Do you recall what the headquarters reaction was?

A I don't think they liked. it, but I don't remember
exactly what the comment was.

Q Do you have any reason.to know why they didn't like
it? .

A Well, I think that they felt that the station was
stirring up an international problem, something with the Cuba
embassy, that there might be -- that the Cuban embassy might
lodge a protest.

Q Why did the ~- why did headquarters request the
Mexican Government to keep the arrest absolutely secret?

A I don't know.

Q Do you know why the Mexico City station did not
contact headquarters prior to requesting the Mexicans to
arrest Sylvia Duran?

A No.

Frequently Mr. Scott took independent action withou
getting headquarters' approval on some cases, and I believe

that he discussed this, but I am not sure. I'd have to

check the records, I think he discussed it with the Ambassador

before it occurred. The Ambassador Mann I think would

of Charles Thomas III, who was a Foreign Service officer in

the political section in Mexico, had a wife whose name was
Cynthia.. The two of them knew some Mexicans who were
literary types and little theater types. I believe that
Thomas and his wife were interested in little theater groups |
or art groups, and they had met Garro.at some function. He |}
wrote a memorandum with information. in it that she had given
him. I believe -- I think that the.minister -- that went

up to the ambassador's office, and the minister gave it to
Mr. Scott and asked Mr. Scott to confirm it. Mr. Scott asked
I think. he asked me ‘about it and I believe we asked the FBI
and the FBI came back that they were also working on it. They

had been asked to check it out

have gotten questions to give to Watson to ask Thomas.
LIONION -- well, that cryptonym LIONION there is used in-
correctly because cryptonym LIONION was the whole Cuban
embassy. LICHANT-1 was a source in the Cuban embassy, and
I think he was in touch with someone in the Cuban section.
Q Now, you mentioned Watson.
Was Watson.in Mexico City at this time?

A Yes, Watson was the man who was in touch with
Thomas, and.I think he was the one that Thomas unburdened
to first, and then they got a memorandum out.

Q I see.

Now,. LICHANT, the source, his name was Manuel

Calvillo.

A I didn't know him. He was -- he may have been in

touch with the Cubans or with Watson. I don't know who
handled him as a case officer.

By Mr. Goldsmith: (Resuming)
Q Please read CIA No. 718, Entry No. 425, this
paragraph here.
(Pause)
A Yes.
Q Now, Manuel Calvillo is LICHANT I, and in that
section that I just asked you to read, he is the person

that escorted Elena Garro de Paz to the small hotel.

but you can find out by getting his 201 file and finding’)

out to whom he reported, who wrote reports on him.

By Mr. Goldsmith:. (Resuming)
Q Okay.
A He would have a 201 file and he would have an
agent file, I think. To get the money to pay the man, they

had to submit an operational report on their contacts with

him.

Q Did you ever submit any questions to Watson
to pass on to Mr. Thomas?

A I am sure I did but I don't remember what they
were. I probably took the memo that Watson had written
and wrote up a list of questions that went something like,
"Who else was there when.Sylvia Duran -- when this occurred,
where, at what time” and.so forth, how did she communicate
with him, i

Q Did this man Calvillo, LICHANT-1, ever submit any i
written reports regarding Elena Garro de Paz?

A I don't know, but his file should indicate whether |
there were any. ag |

Q Is it possible that Calvillo was an unwitting

asset to the Agency?

A It's possible that Calvillo was a subagent of

George Munro and also at the same time being handled by }

someone in the station without our knowledge, I mean, a

subagent of George Munro without our knowledge. He may have

been-on a surveillance team directed by one of the people
that George Munro was handling. At the same time. he was
on that team, he may. have been reporting to Bob Shaw, or
Mr. Watson, or Mr. Phillips.
Q I see.
Let me show you CIA No. 725, and I would like to

ask you to read Entry No. 466. it

(Pause)
A Yes.
Q Does this entry appear to confirm that Elena Garro

de Paz did in fact stay at a small hotel in Mexico City
several. days immediately after the assassination?

A That's the notation made by Mr. Rocca, and this
memo was from the FBI office to Mr. Scott.

Q And the ‘substance of the memo appears to confirm
that aspect of her story, is that correct?

A Unless there ‘was another person by the same name
from San. Luis Potosi.at that hotel, which I doubt.

Q Well, so in substance, the memo tends to confirm
that aspect of. the story, is that correct?

A That .would be my deduction, yes.

ie} Do you know whether Calvillo, LICHANT-1, was

: questioned about this?

A No.

1 Q Even after this portion of his story ee ‘confirmed,
@ 2 he was not questioned about it? Or you don't know if he
3 was questioned about it?
4 A I don't know because I wouldn't have been the
2 5 person that would have been -- I should have seen ‘part of
7 6 it, but it would Ive been up to Stan Watson probably

. a to have confirmed this aspect of Elena Garro de Paz's story?
é 10} I might add that --
z ll A Well, you almost could never get an answer out
7 12 of Charlie Thomas when you asked him sometning. He wrote |
: 13] these memos. constantly. Then you would ask him. for additiong
@ g 14 information, it would be just like dropping a rock into H
5 15] ‘the ocean. It never came back up. But I don't know. i
E 16 Q So are you saying that because Mr. Thomas was i
é
g 17] slow in responding to inquiries by the station, that that is;
. , 18 why it took so long to confirm this aspect of his story? i
E 19 A Well, he reported information that he had heard,
5 20 and then I think that he was not always able to go back to
é 21 the source and say, you said such and such a time this.
. 22 Can you give me more information?.He didn't want to be
23 embarrassed by asking for additional information. He had

Q How seriously were Elena. Garro de Paz's allegations

taken in Mexico City?

A I don't think they were taken too seriously.

Q Why not? }

A Because she and. her husband was -- her ex-husband
was flighty, and they -- her general reputation was one i

that she dealt a lot in fantasy.

Q Now, after one aspect’ of Elena Garro de Paz's

A I don't know.

Q In other words, it seems that although she may have
been flighty, at least she appears to have been telling the

truth about staying at the hotel immediately after the

2 assassination.

i A Well, I don't think that the Agency had any assets;
