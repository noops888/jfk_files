1. In response to Reference A, the Station notified Headquarters
in Reference B that the $500 monthly subsidy to the LIU? student
organization would cease as of 30 April 1906. eedquarters believed
that the April subsidy payment reported in Reference C and charged to
Project LIRANCH vas to be the last payment.

2. Hovever, in both References D and E, subsidy paynerts of $500
were again given to the LIHUFF student orgenization for the months of
August end September. These expenditures were charged to LILISP-X.
‘The nost recent renewal requests for Projects LIZUFF ani LILISP-X do
not contain provisions for this subsidy. lMeadquarters was under the
impression that the subsidy would not be continued and would appre-
ciate the Station's comments.

Identity D has not been appotnted to any Cabinet or sub-minister-
lal position, Further, there Is no Indication that former
President Aleman Intends to re-activate the Frente Civico Into

contact with reference Identity B and the Frente Civico upon
his return from his U.S. trip In January 1965, Before his
departure ARLISS gave reference Identity B an advance of 4600
pesos to cover the two regular monthly payments of 2000 pesos
