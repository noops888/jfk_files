interested offices. This is particularly true of. information

valuable information who is closely associated with the

of D, J. VENUS, III by RICHARD HEAD, at the Sa-When
Lounge, west “of Biloxi, Mississippi, was to be "hushed
up" and that there was to be no prosecution. ADCOCK
advised he received these instructions in a telephone
call from Sheriff DEDEAUX on the night of 10/13/63
at which time DEDEAUX was obviously intoxicated. DEDEAUX
told ADCOCK that "they" had told him ADCOCK was "work ing
for the FBI". ADCOCK advised he told DEDEAUX this was
a lie and DEDEAUX told him to keep his mouth shut and
not to tell any one what happened in regard to the shaoting.
ADCOCK advised DEDEAUX obviously did not want any "heat"
to be put on RICHARD HEAD or VENUS for fear it might
become known that HEAD is DEDEAUX's "front man" with
lounge operators, all of whom must go through HEAD to
open a joint on the Coast involving the sale of whiskey,
gambling or: hustling women.

Lieutenant ADCOCK advised on. 10/18/63
that as a result of the shooting he had recovered from
HEAD a .380 automatic pistol which was believed to be
the weapon used by HEAD in shooting VENUS. ADCOCK advised
Sheriff DEDEAUX had specifically refused to allow him,
ADCOCK, to send this weapon to the FBI Laboratory for
ballistics tests and comparison with spent: bullets
recovered from the shooting scene.
