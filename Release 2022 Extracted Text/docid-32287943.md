of this report for fear of compromising the source is being

set out below for information of the Bureau and

interested offices.

This is particularly true of information

furnished by NO 1225-C, Gulfport,

Mississippi, an extremely

valuable information who is closely associated with the

criminal element in

the Mississippi Gulf Coast

area.

Where information attributed to NO 1225-C under T symbol

in the details is set out, careful consideration has

been given to paraphrasing this information to insure

that the informant's identity will not be compromised.

Lieutenant JAMES ADCOCK, Harrison County

Sheriff's Office, Gulfport, Mississippi, advised

confidentially on 10/14/63

that he had received specific

instructions from Harrison County, Mississippi Sheriff

CURTIS O. DEDEAUX that the October 12, 1963

shooting

of D. J. VENUS, III by RICHARD HEAD; at the Sa-When

Lounge, west of Biloxi, Mississippi, was to be "hushed

up" and that there was to be no prosecution. ADCOCK

advised he received these instructions in a telephone

call from Sheriff DEDEAUX on the night of 10/13/63

at which time DEDEAUX was obviously intoxicated. DEDEAUX

told ADCOCK that "they" had told him ADCOCK was

"working

for the FBI".

ADCOCK advised he told DEDEAUX this was

a lie and DEDEAUX told him to keep his mouth shut and

not to tell any one what happened in regard to the

shooting.

ADCOCK advised DEDEAUX obviously did not want any "heat"

to be put on RICHARD HEAD or VENUS for fear it might

become known that HEAD is DEDEAUX's "front man" with

lounge operators, all of whom must go through HEAD to

open a joint on

the Coast involving the sale of whiskey,

gambling or hustling women.

Lieutenant ADCOCK advised on 10/18/63

that as a result of the shooting he had recovered from

HEAD a .380 automatic pistol which was believed to be

the weapon used by HEAD in shooting VENUS.

ADCOCK advised

Sheriff DEDEAUX had specifically refused to allow him,

ADCOCK, to send this weapon to the FBI Laboratory for

ballistics tests and comparison with spent bullets

recovered from the shooting scene.
