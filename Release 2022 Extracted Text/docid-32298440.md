JOHN FONTANA!s function is to organize. numbers, ecard, dice
and barbout games for. KELLY MANNARINO in New Kensington
and attends the games periodically to make sure that. KELLY
and in turn, SAM. MANNARINO receive their fair share of

the percentages.

@-3 on February. 4,. 1958, described EARL "EARLY" FIELDS

as; the owner and operator of the Fields Hotel located at
12th and Fourth Avenues: in New Kensington, Pa. . T-3 stated
that FIELDS is reputed. to control the numbers writers _
and: control the colored vote in the New- Kensington ¢ area
for the MANNARINO brothers.

on January 14, 1958, MIKE ZERVIS, admitted New Kensington
numbers operator, advised SA JOHN S. -PORTELLA that

within the past month or two,.he had a.conversation with
KELLY.MANNARINO and KELLY told him that he considered MIKE
HAJADAKOS.as his right arm because -HAJADAKOS keeps the
books for the dice games, keeps complete records and
always gives MANNARINO an honest count. ZERVIS further
stated that HAJADAKOS has told him that he and JOHNNY

FONTANA receive $125 per week from the MANNARINO operation

plus six per cent commission of the take on the dice
tables. According to.ZERVIS, this percentage.can sometimes

‘run, up to $1,000 per week.

ZERVIS stated that HAJADAKOS has become.a wealthy man
through his.association with the MANNARINOs and-has made
several trips to his old home town in Peraila, Greece,
located:near ‘the Port of Athens, Greece. According to
ZERVIS, HAJADAKOS has. been, using the money to build
apartment buildings and office buildings in this home
town. -He further.stated that HAJADAKOS has told him that
on one particular rental property in foreuee Greece, he
receives $1,150 a month rent.

ZERVIS further advised that it is rumored that GABRIEL
MANNARINO is very friendly with AL ROSS of Pittsburgh
because AL ROSS supposedly served time for a crime KELLY
MANNARINO committed. ZERVIS stated that he would
endeavor to find out more about this rumor but doubted
that he could and said that he, himself, believed that
the rumor had no foundation.

PG 92-236

ZERVIS went on to advise about a raid made in New Kensington
by the Internal Revenue Service on January 6, 1958. He
stated that he had a conversation about these raids with
DAN ZELOYLE, Chief of Police of New Kensington, and ZELOYLE
made the remark that he was sick and tired of being
embarrassed because of GABRIEL MANNARINO. According to
ZERVIS, ZELOYLE told him that on the day of the raids, a
member of the Internal Revenue Service came to the New
Kensington Police Station and notified him that a raiding
party was. in New Kensington at that time and that they

were raiding various clubs in the city... ZELOYLE stated
that the inference he got from this action was that he
could not be trusted and according to ZERVIS, ZELOYLE
disliked this very much. ZERVIS stated however that he
does not believe ZELOYLE. will break .with. the MANNARINOS
over this issue but wished to point out that there appears
to be some ill feeling beginning to grow between them.

MIKE ZERVIS further stated that JOHNNY FONTANA can be

found almost any day at the dice tables in New Kensington
where he generally spends most of his day looking out

for the MANNARINOS'! interest from about 1:00 in the
afternoon until closing time. ZERVIS stated that in his
judgment, JOHNNY FONTANA is GABRIEL MANNARINO's most
trusted lieutenant who will someday take GABRIEL MANNARINO's
place.

JOHN FONTANA, 1237 Fifth Avenue, New Kensington, Pa.,
telephone Edison 9-9563 on January 29,.1958, was interviewed
by SAS RICHARD GORDON DOUCE and NORMAN T. THOMPSON as a
possible witness in connection with a White Slave Traffic
Act ‘investigation pending in the Pittsburgh office.

FONTANA furnished little or no information of value and at
the outset emphasized that he would not cooperate or assist
the FBI or anyither law enforcement agency in any matter
under investigation and under no circumstances would he
discuss SAMUEL or GABRIEL MANNARINO whom he indicated he
had known since childhood.

FONTANA pointed out.that since. being convicted and receiving
a suspended sentence in U. S. District’Court, Pittsburgh,
for his part in the vote fraud investigation conducted by
the FBI, he has attempted to go legitimate by working as a
salesman for the Marbet Heating Company of Pittsburgh, Pa.

MANNARINOs operate the numbers, dice and card games.
ZERVIS further stated that he learned .from HAJADAKOS

that TANNAS is generally referred'to as’a contact: man
because. of his many contacts. throughout the country

made as .a.result of his fight promotions; that WILLIE’
SAMS’ is probably the shrewdest sport bookie in the
country. .ZERVIS further stated that he knows from
personal knowledge that everyone who is writing numbers
in the New Kensington area and turning into the MANNARINOs
has been told by the MANNARINOs that if they are raided
and arrested they are to consider themselves on their own
and that ‘the group, meaning the MANNARINO group, would
not provide bond, money or an attorney for them.

In 1953, TOM TANNAS, City-Clerk of Arnold, Pa., the
adjoining community to New'Kensington, Pa., explained

that the top echelon of the MANNARINO organization was
comprised at that time of SAM MANNARINO, GABRIEL MANNARINO,
WILLIAM SAM and himself. TANNAS further stated that this
organization had an interest in.all phases of gambling,
slot machines, numbers, card games; bookmaking ‘and. employs
slot machine repairmen, collection men, numbers pickup
men, proféssional ‘card ‘sharks and bookmakers. i

years ago, a man named (FNU) ARABIA was found dead outside
New. Kensington, having been shot. in the head. 7-2

statéd that it was. his belief, although he could not™”
prove it, that this job was done at the request of the
MANNARINOs, and..that the man who did the shooting was

HENRY "SMASH" MC HENRY; who performed the job for $1,000.
7-2 further. stated that MC HENRY is presently serving
time-.in-a, penitentiary, unknown to him.

{-2 went.on to advise that in about 1937, he witnessed
an incident in.which KELLY MANNARINO at about "3:00 a.m.,
one-.morning, ‘shot ‘up a ‘two block section of store windows
on Fifth Avenue. between Eighth and Tenth Streets in New
Kensington from a moving automobile using a sub-machine
gun. T=2 stated however that another man, whose name he
could not récall, was arrested and took the rap for this
offénsé. .T-2 further stated that no one was injured due
only. to the time of this occurrence. 7-2 stated that he
felt certain that.the’ subject no longer has the sub-machine
gun and had néver been known to use or display one since
that incident.

will be made as to their possible usefulness in the investigations.

STANLEY KOWALSKY, the New Kensington Police Officer previously
described as a. possible source of information, is no longer being

lieutenants, is, in the opinion of the Special Agents who
interviewed him, a bitter and hardened criminal and is not
believed to be the type of person who could be developed as a PCI.

Leads have been set out in this report. to develop background
information regarding MIKE HAJADAKOS, who is deeply involved
in gambling activities with the MANNARINO brothers. .As soon
as sufficient background information is.obtained so that an
intelligent interview can be conducted, serious consideration
