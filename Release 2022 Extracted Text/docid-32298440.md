and barbout games for KELLY MANNARINO in New Kensington

and attends the games periodically to make sure that KELLY

and in turn, SAM. MANNARINO receive their fair share of

the percentages.

12th and Fourth Avenues in New Kensington, Pa. T-3 stated

that FIELDS 1s reputed. to control the numbers writers

and: control the colored vote in the New-Kensington area

for the MANNARINO brothers.

On January 14, 1958, MIKE ZERVIS, admitted New Kensington

numbers operator, advised SA JOHN S. PORTELLA that

within the past month or two, he had a conversation with

KELLY MANNARINO and KELLY told him that he considered MIKE

HAJADAKOS as his right arm because HAJADAKOS keeps the

books for the dice games, keeps complete records and

always gives MANNARINO an honest. count. ZERVIS further

stated that HAJADAKOS has told him that he and JOHNNY

FONTANA receive $125 per week from the MANNARIN® operation

plus six per cent commission of the take on the dice

tables:

According to ZERVIS, this percentage can sometimes

run, up to $1,000 per week.

through his association with the MANNARINOs and has made

several trips to his old home town in Perala, Greece,

located:near the Port of Athens, Greece. According to

apartment buildings and office buildings in this home

town. He further stated that HAJADAKOS has told him that

ZERVIS went on to advise about a raid made in New Kensington

by the Internal Revenue Service on January 6, 1958. He

stated that he had a conversation about these raids with

DAN ZELOYLE, Chief of Police of New Kensington, and ZELOYLE

made the remark that he was sick and tired of being

embarrassed because of GABRIEL MANNARINO. According to

ZERVIS, ZELOYLE told him that on the day

of the raids, a

member

of the Internal Revenue Service came to the New

Kensington Police Station and notified' him that a raiding

party was in New Kensington at that time and that they

were raiding various clubs in the city.: ZELOYLE stated

that the inference he got from this action was that he

could not be trusted and according to ZERVIS, ZELOYLE

disliked this very much. ZERVIS stated however that he

does not believe ZELOYLE will break with the MANNARINOS

over this issue but wished to point out that there appears

to be some i11 feeling beginning to grow between

them..

MIKE ZERVIS further stated that JOHNNY FONTANA can be

found almost any day at the dice tables in New Kensington

where he generally

spends most of his day looking out

for the MANNARINOS' interest from about 1:00 in the

afternoon until closing time. ZERVIS stated that in his

judgment, JOHNNY FONTANA iS GABRIEL MANNARINO's most

trusted

lieutenant who will someday take GABRIEL MANNARINO'S

place.

elephone Edison 9-9563 on January 29, 1950, was interviewe

by SAS RICHARD GORDON DOUCE and NORMAN T. THOMPSON as a

possible witness 'in connection with a White Slave Traffic

Act investigation pending in the Pittsburgh Office.

FONTANA furnished little or no information of value and at

the outset emphasized thät he would not cooperate or assist

the FBI or anycher law enforcement agency in any matter

under investigation and under no circumstances woula he

discuss SAMUEL Or GABRIEL MANNARINO whom he indicated he

had known since childhood.

FONTANA pointed out that since being convicted and receiving

a suspended sentence in U. S. DistrictiCourt, Pittsburgh,

for his part in the vote fraud investigation conducted by

the FBI, he has attempted to go legitimate by working as a

salesman for the Marbet Heating Company of Pittsburgh, Pa.

the man who did the shooting was

HENRY "SMASH" MC HENRY

who performed the job for $1,000.

T-2 further stated that MC HENRY is presently serving

time in a penitentiary, unknown to him:

one morning, shot up a two block section of store windows

on Fifth Avenue between Eighth and Tenth Streets in New.

Kensington from a moving automobile using a sub-machine
