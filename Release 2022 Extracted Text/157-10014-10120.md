Re:

Oswald in New Orleans.

This morning I called (504/821-2000) "Chief"

Giarruso of the NOPD for the purpose of determining whether

Oswald was arrested in New Orleans other than on August 9,

1963. Lt. Hunt transferred me to Major Earl Burmaster's,

explaining that he was the "keeper of records".

After explaining that we were merely asking a

question that had not been asked (and not investigating

the NOPD) I inquired as to whether there were any other

arrests (or records). on Oswald.

Burmaster called me back

and suggested that I call Sgt. Wenstein in the Intelligence

Unit (ext. 311).

I spoke with Sgt. Wenstein who promised

to get back to me.

At 3:30 p.M. I called Wenstein again. He was

out of the office, but had left the matter with sgt.

Loicano. He was most cooperative and with the Oswald file

in hand stated that the "rap sheet" revealed only the

August 9, 1963, arrest.

(Included in the documents per-

taining to said arrest was a memorandum by It. August

Lang, and an August 12, 1963, "inter-office memo" to

Major Prossens.

I thanked the Sgt. for his cooperation, leaving

my phone number should anything else come to this attention.

RE:

LBJ LIBRARY/KENNEDY ASSASSINATION

Sharon Faucet of the LBJ Library called me back this

morning about my inquiries of May 12, 1976.

Ms. Faucet checked

Library materials to determine if there were any records in-

dicating what was discussed at a May 10, 1967, meeting attended

by Johnson, Helms, and George Christian. Faucet told me that the

"Diary Back-Up" Records have a note about the May 10, 1967,

meeting which reads "Richard Helms wants to see you

about Drew

Pearson column."

Faucet also reported that there were no memos reflecting

a March 22, 1967, meeting between Johnson and Helms, Cater,

McPherson, and Gardner.

Faucet said the meeting probably was

about the Katzenbach

academic study and possibly about the Guam

conference which occurred the week before.

I again listed the materials Faucet promised to send the

Committee:

1). List of Helms' meetings in the White House during

the Johnson administration;

2) Copies of Johnson's Daily Diary Logs for March

19-22, 1967, and April 24-May 23, 1967;

I called Sharon Faucet (sic) of the LBJ Library in

Austin this morning and informed her that Epstein and I saw

Marvin Watson at his home in California, and that Mr. Watson

showed us about four file cabinets in the basement of his

home which he represented to contain his papers from the White

House. I also informed Ms. Faucet that Watson had said he was

moving back to Texas at the end of May and would deposit those

files in the Johnson Library.

I also requested Faucet send the Committee the Library's

public statement regarding Johnson's taping system and the list

of Marvin Watson memos/FBI memos dealing with the Garrison in-

vestigation withheld

1 from research because of derogatory material.

I also asked Ms. Faucet to check the Library's materials

for any meetings involving Helms between March 19-23, 1967, and

April 24-May 22, 1967. Faucet promised to check and call me back

at mid-day.. She also mentioned that the President met with

Defense, State, and CIA every Tuesday to discuss national security

affairs, but there were no memos of these meetings until late

1967.

Ms. Faucet also informed me that Dick Jacobs, Deputy

Archivist for Presidential libraries, was the Archives' official

in Washington

who would be handling our document request from

Austin.

Paul Wallach

From: Bob Kelley

As I mentioned to you, Senator Mathias is making an in-

vestigation of his own as a member of the Select Committee, as

permitted by Committee procedures, into the aspect of the possi-

ble connection between Operation Mongoose and the JFK assassina-

tion.

In this connection, he is interested in obtaining any FBI

documents concerning contacts between a Cuban exile, Jose Alemar

and FBl agents, among which were SA George Davis and Paul Scran-

ton. He understands that in 1962-1963, Aleman had regular meet-

ings with Santos Trafficante which Aleman reported to SA Davis

Scranton.

In particular, Senator Mathias is interested in

any documents relating to a meeting between Aleman and Davis

and Scranton on November 22 or 23, 1963. (the day or the day

after the JFK assassination).

Also, Aleman may have had a meet-

ing with FBI agents on April 17, 1971 (the day of the Bay of Pigs

Invasion) :

I would appreciate. it if you would make a request to the

FBI for material relating to the above.

was also dispatched to Greenspun on 3/8/76 indicating the Committee's

interest in discussing the evidence in his possession. The full

Committee unanimously approved a subpoena for Greenspun.

The Committee also approved a subpoena for Washington

attorney Edward Pierpoint Morgan. Morgan was the attorney of

record for Messrs. Roselli and Maheu in 1967. It would appear

that he was the source of the Drew Pearson 1967 assassination

article which preceeded (some might say precipitated) the 1967

1G report. It was

also Morgan's information that led Pearson

to go to Chief Justice Warren on January of 1967. Recently

received FBI reports indicate that at President Johnson's urging

the Bureau reluctantly interviewed Morgan in April of 1967.

His mental attitude and long sustained depression was inconsistent with

What might have been eating at the vitals of Robert Kennedy was the cer-

possibly to his own death.

period and limited to the

narrow. confines of the subject stated above.

We had neither the intention nor the capability to follow

every rumor, analyze every theory, investigate every charge, or

We were not oiven such latitude

Thus, our Subcommittee Report does not attempt to provide

a comprehensive evaluation or

critique of the Warren Commission

Report.

It does, however, set forth information

-- pertaining

particularly to

certain U. S. and Cuban activities

-- which was

not made available to the Warron Commission but which appearsto

have been

relevant to the Warren Commission

inquiry.

Our Subcommittee Report raises new questions in the following

broad areas:

Telephone Conversation re: Kennedy Assassination

Plot

DI. Harrison (phone: 659-8374), who is working on a

history project with Senator McGovern, called to pass on

information he obtained

on an assassination plot against

Kennedy. A woman he talked to claims that the CIA and

OAS (the OAS was

the French Secret Army Organization

opposed to DeGaulle) plotted to assassinate Kennedy and

DeGaulle in 1961 during Kennedy's trip to France.

death would be made to appear accidental

Kennedy's

but the OAS would

claim credit for DeGaulle's.

A "hit man" was

selected and

his name is Romundo (phonetic).

The woman had planned to interview Romundo in October

or November 1972 for CBS because Romundo identified Bernard

Barker and another of the Watergate conspirators as two of

the people who contacted him about the plot.

She claims

Romundo identified these two from photographs of a group

of people, none of whom were identified for him.

General

Salan, head of the OAS, called off the assassination.

The woman originally was told by CBs that ban Kather

would go to Paris with her to interview Romundo.

Rather

backed out. She then teamed up with a man named Baer

(phonetic) who was Newsweek Bureau Chief in Paris in 191L.

She claims Baer was working for CIA and attempted to hin-

der the attempts

to interview Romundo.

She never got the

interview because

Romundo left Paris before she got to

talk to him and made off with the advance he was paid.

She talked to Peter Kalisher in Paris who gave her

some help.

He told her she was free to file a story but

because she had no verification, Kalisher did not think it

would be printed. Therefore, she has not filed a story on

this information.

He again was cooperative

and agreed to come to D.C. as long

as it was cleared with his superiors.

Roache explained that in 1963 he was in charge of

IN&S' New Orleans Border Patrol Station; i.e., Station senior,

which was not in the Customs House.

The Station reported

directly to the New Orleans District Office, which at that

time was run by Edward I. Cupp.

Bob Brewer was then in charge

of the B.R. section in the Regional IN&S Office in Richmond,

Va.

According to Roache, INGS' role is to determine who

is an alien, and prevent unauthorized border crossings.

However, frequent additional requirements were levied upon

IN&S (such as supplementing federal marshalls). In the

instant area, IN&S New Orleans was charged with the responsi

bility of surveilling various

Cuban "groups" in New Orleans.

Although Roache cannot specifically recall who initiated the

requirement, he assumes it came through Justice and stated

that Cupp should be clearer on the details.

Included in this surveillance was the group of "nuts"

headed by David Ferrie. Roache knew the details on Ferrie

i.e., dismissal from Eastern Airlines, homosexual with per-

verse tendencies ("nuttier than a fruitcake"), etc.

He stated

that Ferries' office - on a side street between St. Charles

and Camp -- (we'll have a street map for him) was under

surveillance lalthough he never surveilled it, another inspector

drove him past it and identified itl; that Lee Harvey Oswald -

who was identified by IN&S as

an American when he first appeared

on the New Orleans street scene (he does not recall the cir-

cumstances surrounding the identification) - was seen going

into the offices of Ferries'group, and "Oswald was known to

be one of the men in

the group."

Roache was aware that Ferries' group was anti-Castro,

that Ferrie had a plane at the airport la C-5

or 5wl and that

it was believed that Ferrie was going to take his brigade --

which was "being trained by a 6-foot ex-Marine" -- at

Lake Poncetrain.

He further stated that Ferrie like young

men and was known to "give these guys all sorts of pills

at the training camp and take movies of them."

Roache stressed that the NOPD (specifically the

intelligence division) and the East Metie's (phonetic)

Sheriff's Office had reports on Ferries' group. He added

that "Garrison had something; I read his reports in the

newspaper and they were correct, "he

received good intelli-

gence information, whether he was using it for politics

Roach also noted that (1) Garrison was all eyes

and ears in the French Quarter and (2) that he had heard

Ferrie was running when he was killed.

Roache did not know:

(1) Whether Oswald ever visited the training camp;

(2) about any organized crime tie-ins;

(3) about Oswald being arrested for getting into

a fight;

(4) about Oswald's alleged anti-Cuban politics;

(5) whether Oswald had any contacts with other

law enforcement and/or intelligence agencies;

(6) of a restaurant called "Pedro's";

(7) specific dates for any facts described herein.

Roache himself had seen Oswald on only one occasion:

when Oswald was passing out handbills at a point not too far

from Jackson Square (also not too far from the Trade Mart) •

A most interesting occurence was touched on by

Roache .

He related that Ron Smith happened to receive a call

from the N.O.P.D., which at that time had Oswald in custody.

Apparently Oswald would only speak Russian and the N.O.P.D.

deducted that he was Russian.

Smith went to the N.O.P.D. and

Roache believes that he identified Oswald as an American citizen.

After that, Oswald spoke in

English.

Roache does not know if

Smith filed a report. He did state

that he talked to Smith

about it two weeks ago, adding that he had no objection to

my telling Smith

that he had referred me to him.

We generally discussed IN&S record keeping. Apparen-

tly almost all of Roache's reports to Cupp were oral. He

does not believe that any reports were written on the afore-

## Page 36

- 3

mentioned points, with the exception of the levying of

requirements on IN&S.

Roache had limited, if any, contact with De Oweys,

or any other FBI (or CIA)

agent "I knew him."

He also

told me that IN&S did not have informants in these groups.

(No idea of anyone that had.)

I asked Roache who else beside Cupp, Smith and he was

likely to have known about Oswald.

(I assume we can get

IN&S records. He suggested Russell Bruce.

IN&S local investigations office (no BP office)

would have checked out Cubans, etc. in Dallas. (Let's get

their agents' lists too.)

Re ::

Pat Shea

Paul Wallach

Carver Gayton

As we discussed, I would appreciate your interview-

ing ex-FBI agent Gayton in Seattle on Friday, January 16, 1976.

There will be two general areas of inquiry. The

first is Warren Commission related, and more specifically in-

volves James Gouchenaur's statements (which have

a ring of

plausibility) that SA James P. Hosty told Gayton that Oswald

was a psi who's "status had changed". Gouchenaur also related

that Hosty had been trying to develop Oswald as a psi, that

Oswald had a mail drop and was being pressured to inform (on

what is a good question) and that Hosty even went to Oswald's

apartment to leave a note (against Bureau regulations) when

he hadn't heard from Oswald. According to Gouchenaur, these

statements were made to Gayton after "Hosty blew an organized

crime stake out in Kansas City and Gayton helped him cover up."

Gouchenaur would also have us believe that Gayton

left the Bureau primarily because of his dissatisfaction with

their handling of the "king case" and investigation of his assas-

sination. In this regard Gayton is alleged to have stated that

although the Bureau had been tailing King for years, the tail

was pulled off the morning of the assassination; that

the King

assassination was an embarrassment to the Bureau.

As I mentioned, it is imperative that we proceed

cautiously as there is some question as to Gouchenaur's credi-

bility. Mike and I will talk to you about this and other mat-

ters before your departure.

Re: Telephone Conversation with Wendall C. Roache

Yesterday's interview with Orest Pena produced two

names

for us to follow up on (1) Wendall Roache (ISNS), and

(2) David Smith (U.S. Customs) • I immediately contacted Steve

Blackhurst and Bob McBrien, Justice and Treasury Departments

respectively, to facilitate the location of these persons.

This morning John Matson (I&NS) called and informed me

that Roache was presently with the Border Patrol in Celexio,

California (714-357-1143]. I informed Matson that I would

be in touch with

Roache; Matson suggested that I just touch

base with Roache's supervisor, Eldon Wooley.

Wooley informed me that Roache was on the 4 to 12

shift and would call me as soon as he came into the office.

Roache called at approximately 3:55 (E.S.T.). I

provided him with some background on the Committee; he knew

who we were and stated "you fellows

are doing the partial

reopening of the Warren Commission." I also told him that

although we had contacted I&NS headquarters to secure his

name, we do not discuss what a witness tells us with anyone

outside the Committee.

It is my impression that Roache was not surprised to

hear from us.

(Possibly notified by I&NS in D.C., but that

doesn't follow from my conversation with Matson.] I also

believe that Roache was relieved to hear from us. ["I've

been waiting twelve years to talk to someone about this."]

He expressed a desire to cooperate fully; willing to come to

D.C. at our convenience.

Roache immediately stated: "You want to talk to Ron I.

Smith too, don't you?"

I hedged

and asked him why did he

think that.

He responded that "Ron had gone down to the

police station after receiving a call from the police IN.0.P.D.1,

something about Oswald arrested and they thought him to be a

Russian."

Roache informed me that Smith is presently with

Roache began talking about Oswald. He "saw him around

talked to someone lit was probably his supervisor

whose voice I heard in the backgroundl and then asked couldn't

we come there. I said that although it wasn't a usual practice,

it might be practical in view of our desire to also speak to

Mr. Smith.

then suggested to Roache that he let us get in

touch with Smith.

I left it with Smith that we would be

getting back to him within two days.

In view of the Smith and Roache interviews -- along with

the possibility that James Smith (U.S. Customs) is in San

Diego - it would expedite matters to have someone go out to

California. I mentioned this to Ed; we agreed to firm things

up tomorrow.

Ronald L. Smith

Ron Smith (INS) finally returned my call this

afternoon (714-352-6307; 352-0521) •

Ron did not want to

come in to testify, primarily because "he would have

nothing to add."

I stressed that our fact finding mission

required that we evaluate and put the pieces of testimony

together.

Ron agreed to come in.

Ron was a Boarder Patrol Inspector with the New

Orleans Station in 1962 and 1963, transferring to Blain

of 1963.

One seemingly

uneventful day, he received a not so unusual radio call

requesting verification of an alien, i.e., the First

Precinct of the N.O.P.D. had an individual in custody who

claimed to be Cuban.

Responding to the call, Ron proceeded

to the First Precinct where he interrogated a prisoner

(in fact, not sure if booked or aware of charges) named

Lee Harvey Oswald, who was claiming to be Cuban. (Ron does

not recall if he was speaking Spanish - and has no recol-

lection on his own of Oswald speaking Russian.) Ron could

not give me a date, the names of any persons

at the jail,

nor the specifics (or even generalities) as to what Oswald

After five minutes of "interrogation," Oswald admitted

that he was an American citizen and Smith took off.

He does not recall discussing this event with anyone,

including co-workers at INS; however, when Oswald's picture

brother told him that Orest was working for for was going to

I called Hollenbaugh again today to inquire as to when

Shanklin

before the Committee.

For the record, I orginally contacted

Hollanbaugh early this week after Paul Daly had informed

me that he was representing Shanklin. Hollanbugh came on

quite strong and informed me that he wanted to review our

documents prior to Shanklin's testimony before Edwards'

to Shanklin and reach a determination as to whether or not

Shanklin would appear here.

in Shanklin's deposition would be available to him prior

to the deposition for his review but that I in turn wanted

Hollenbaugh cited some

I then discussed the issuance of a subpoena with Messrs.

Schwarz and Smothers who concurred in my decision and authorized

the securing of such subpoena from the Chairman. However,

in the interim -- after I had contacted the FBI's Paul

Scheduled Interview of Alonso Hudkins on November 20, 1975

I.

Background Information

A. Alonso Hudkins:

Personal Background

A Secret Service report indicated that Hudkins started

his employment with the Houston Post (the newspaper for which

he reported the President's assassination) about one month

before the assassination.

It is unknown how long he has been

affiliated with the Baltimore News American.

(George O'Toole

alleged that Hudkins was once employed by H.L. Hunt during which

time he was contacted by the CIA to undertake

an assassination

effort.)

Allegation that Oswald Was an FBI Informant

The Warren Commission met in Executive Session on January

22, 1964 to discuss the allegation that Lee Harvey Oswald was

an FBI informant.

J. Lee Rankin, General Counsel of the Warren

Commission explained that Waggoner Carr, Attorney General of

called him that morning and told him about the rumor.

are identified the source of the rumor as Dallas District Attorney:

Henry Wade:

On January 24, Chief Justice Warren and Rankin met with

Carr, Wade, Assistant District Attorney William Alexander and

Leon Jaworski and Robert Storey.

The Texas group reported that

the rumor may have originated with Alonso Hudkins, reporter for

the Houston Post.

In an undated memo for the record (probably written shortly

after the 24th), Rankin states that he discovered a Secret Service

report of S.A.

Bertram dated 1/3/64 on January 23. The report

stated that on December 18, Hudkin advised Secret

Service that

1962 by the FBI "as an informant in connection with their sub-

versive investigation"

• Hudkins also reported that the number

## Page 59

Page 2

assigned to Oswald was S-172.

Rankin's memo further notes

that the Secret Service ad-

vised on January 24 that Chief Sweatt stated he heard the In-

formant rumor from Assistant DA, Alexander:

The routes that the FBI-Oswald rumor followed are pe-

culiar.

The Warren Commission was informed by Carr, who heard

the rumor from Wade.

Wade's assistant attributed the rumor to

Alexander, who said he received it from Hudkins.

However,

Hudkins maintains he heard the allegation from Sweatt, who

maintained he heard it from Alexander. (N.B.

Neither Hudkins

or Alexander testified before the Warren Commission)

Hudkin's involvement in publicizing the allegation

since

1963 is more confounding.

the Philadelphia Inquirer that he had invented the numbers S-172

and S-179 (also connected with an alleged Oswald informant

status) and leaked the information during a phone conversatior

in order to determine if the FBI had tapped his telephone.

In an article published in the March 19, 1975, Hudkins

wrote that the S-172 number was "made up" by himself, Assistant

DA, Bill Alexander and Hugh

Aynesworth (who was a reporter for

the Dallas Morning News).

Hudkins arranged a conference call,

the three

30 minutes" an FBI agent visited Hudkin's office

to ask him

questions

about the Oswald story. From this exercise, Hudkins

determined that the FBI had tapped one of the three's

respective

phones.

Hudkin's Allegation That Oswald Learned of a Plot to

Assassinate Castro While Oswald Was in Mexico City

A Secret Service report by S. A. Bertram (12/14/63)

states that on December 12, 1963 Hudkins advised that he received

information from Felton West, Houston Post Washington Bureau

representative,

that Oswald heard of an American plot to assassi-

nate Castro while he was in Mexico City, September 27-October 2,

Alledgedly, Oswald was also informed that President Kennedy

and Vice President Johnson knew of the plot.

Secret Service Director Thomas Kelley talked to Felton

West in Washington.

West denied having informed Hudkins about

any allegation involving Oswald's knowledge of an assassination

plot against Castro. Director Kelley concluded Hudkins was a

usually unreliable source of information.

D. Hudkin's Opinion That Jack Ruby's Roommate, George

Senator, Might Have Some Connection with the Murder

of Oswald

A Secret Service report of S. A. Bertram dated 1/3/64

reports that on December 16, 1963 Hudkin's called the Dallas

Secret Service office and opined, that George Senator had some-

thing

to do with the murder of Oswald.

Hudkins said that Ruby

had a brother and a nephew who worked

for Jimmy Hoffa in Detroit

and that it was his "wild guess" that the Hoffa organization

might somehow be involved in the assassination. Hudkins also

noted that Ruby's attorney, Melvin L. Belli was an associate of

Atty Abt who was the first attorney Oswald requested after he

was taken into custody.

Furthermore, Hudkins reported that Atty. Thomas Howard and

Ruby were present for the Oswald

outside of Captain

Fritz's office in the Dallas. Police Headquarters on the evening

of November 22, 1963. Hudkins noted that Howard applied for a

writ of release for Ruby "two minutes before Oswald got to the

hospital"

after the shooting by Ruby. Hudkins also noted he

knew Ruby.

II. Proposed Questions

1. Did Hudkins, in fact, participate in the conference call

as decribed in Hudkins' March story in the Baltimore News Ameri-

can. What was the approximate date of the conference call?

2. What indications did Hudkins have that would lead him

to suspect his phone was tapped by the FBI?

3. Did Alexander and Aynesworth also participate in the

conference call?

4. Who was the FBI agent that visited Hudkins "30 minutes"

after the conference call?

4a. Hudkins states in the 3/10/75 Baltimore News

American article that he participated in the conference call

at his "desk at the Houston Posti'

Where were Alexander and

Aynesworth?

Were they subsequently interviewed by FBI agents?

What assurances from this experiment did Hudkins obtain that

it was his phone and not Aynesworth's or Alexander's that was

tapped?

5. Was Hudkins ever asked to testify before the Warren

Commission?

Was Hudkins ever interviewed by a member of the

Warren Commission staff? If so, by whom?

NH 50955 DocId: 32123508 Page 60

## Page 61

Page 4

6.

How long was

Hudkins associated with the Houston Post

before the President's assassination?

How long did Hudkins re-

main with the Post after the assassination?

7. Why did Hudkins wait until 1973 to "clarify" his role

in the rumor that Oswald was an FBI agent?

8. Who initiated the idea for the informant story? Hud-

kins?

Aynesworth?

Alexander?

Sweatt?

Why was the number S-172

(or S-179) used (especially in light of Alexander's presumed

experience with Bureau procedures)?

9. Did Hudkins ever receive any information from Felton

West regarding Oswald's alleged knowledge of an assassination

plot against Castro?

Why, in 1963, would Hudkins place any

credence in reports of American assassination plots against

Castro?

10. Did Hudkins make up S-179?

11. What function did Ruby's relatives serve in the Hoffa

organization?

12.

Was Ruby present in Dallas Police Headquarters on Friday

evening of the 22th?

With whom did he associate while there?

13.

Did Hudkins know Ruby? If so, for how long? Have any

of Hudkin's notions about Ruby and the underworld been confirmed

since his reporting in 1963?

14.

(O' Toole alleged that Hudkins was recruited by CIA to

undertake assassination while with H.L. Hunt oil company). De-

velop more background on Hudkins. Was

he ever employed by H.

L. Hunt?

Re: Oswald File at Secret Service

Ed and I completed review of over one-half of the

documents contained in the Secret Service files on Oswald.

The following are notes on areas of interest in the documents

and

recommendations for appropriate document requests.

"Report of the Secret Service on the Assassination of

President John F. Kennedy."

This is the report that Mr. Kelly

said was given to the National Archives.

It has two volumes;

the first being an overview of preparation made by the Secret

Service in liaison with Bureau and Dallas officials for the

President's trip, the second being appendices including

individual reports of Special Agents

discussing the special

action they took after the President's assassination.

particular interest are reports of activities at Parkland

Hospital and the transferral of physical evidence from Dallas

to Washington.

It does not seem unreasonable to request a

complete copy of the Report. Specific points of interest are

outlined below.

A. A report by Chief James J. Reilly dated 12/18/63

states that on 10/30/63 the Dallas FBI office gave the local

Secret Service office the name of a right-wing individual in

the Dallas area that it considered Dangerous.

The report states

that S.A. Howlett met the informant of the right-wing group in

Denton, Texas (where right-wing protesters demonstrated against

Adlai Stevenson during his visit a few weeks before) on 11/15/63.

On 11/20/63 the informant visited TV Station KRLD in Dallas

with Howlett and a representative of the Criminal Investigation

Division of Dallas Police, when film of the Stevenson demon-

stration was viewed.

informant identified the ringleaders;

stills of these were given to Secret Service agents.

Recommendation: Howlett's part of protective research

indicates that the Secret Service developed information on in-

dividuals in the general vicinity of Dallas who might be dangerous.

Request any and all memoranda relating to Howlett's investi-

gation of right-wing groups.

B .

Secret Service Agent Roger C. Warner filed a state-

ment on 11/22/63 in which he stated that Special Agent James

H. Howard arrived with Special Agent William Duncan at Park-

land Hospital about 1:30 p.m. on 11/22/63.

Howard informed

Warner that a suspect had been captured by Fort Worth Police.

Howard and Warner went to FWPD and questioned Donald Wayne

House of Ranger, Texas.

Recommendation: This is the first substantive report

about another suspect that has come to SSC attention.

Request

of questioning of Donald House.

C. In a statement dated 11/30/63, Special Agent Andrew

Berger recounted his experiences while guarding the ER with

SA Johnson at Parkland Hospital. Berger stated that an un-

1a cat that it reen 9, brain entered the opteh d

saying he was "sent

by Hoover."

Nelson entered the ER at 1:30 p.m.

An unidentified individual

(WM, 45 yrs, 6'2") attempted to forcibly enter the ER claiming

he was an FBI agent. SA Berger and SA Johnson had to forcibly

prevent the man

from entering the ER.

SA Killerman spoke to

the man and asked him to go to the end of the hall. This event

was witnessed by Congressman Olin Teague.

SA Johnson's statement of 11/30/63, affirms Berger's

recounting of the incident.

Recommendation: Request the Bureau to grant SSC access to

reports field by SA Vincent Drain on investigation at Parkland

Hospital on 11/22/63.

II. A report filed by SA William H. Peterson on 11/25/63

reveals that Marina told Dallas Police during questioning that

she was interviewed by the FBI 10 days before the assassination.

Additionally, Peterson recounted talking to an unidentified

FBI agent present

at the Dallas Station.

The FBI agent, who

was on the subversive desk, said that Oswald had contacted two

known subversive agents 15

days before the assassination.

Recommendation: Request Peterson's memo.

Be on the lookout

for references to FBI's knowledge of Oswald's subversive contact

Re: Telephone conversation with David Lifton

Yesterday afternoon I spoke with David Lifton (213-826-

1610; 11818-1/2 Dorothy Street, Los Angeles, California) who

you recall had been mentioned to us by George O'Toole as the

Cartoore as the

"Warren Commission expert on the Secret Service."

Dave is presently working on a manuscript which he

hopes to have completed by the end of the year. Although he

is quite protective of his

work, he did begin to freely discuss

certain areas that he thought we should be looking into.

The first such area centers on the windshield of the

President's car. Lifton explained

that the reporters at Park-

land Hospital are quoted as

having said

that there was a bullet

hole in the windshield of the President's car.

Apparently

pictures were taken at that time but they were not dispositive

of the "bullet hole" issue.

In any event, the car was brought

aboard the plane the next day and taken to the White House.

After midnight on November 24, 1964, top FBI officials met in

the garage and examined the automobile for over three

and one-

half hours.

They were accompanied by two Secret Service agents

who did no

more

than watch the FBI conduct the examination.

T'he Secret Service agents' report allegedly states "of parti-

cular note to the FBI was the hole in the windshield."

According to Lifton, there is no Bureau report on the

examination of the car. Four days later "a windshield of the

car was removed and stored in the White House garage." Approxi-

mately four months later the Warren Commission

asked the Bureau

for a report on the windshield.

The Bureau said that it did not

have one.

However, it informed the Warren Conmission

that the

Secret Service had the windshield.

However, this windshield had

no hole in it.

(There is a question as to whether or not this

is the same windshield that was examined in the car.)

During the Warren Commission sessions; agent Frazier --

an FBI lab expert - testified and according

to the colloquy

apparently had a

"report" with him on the stand.

During the

exchange before the Commission, Specter

stated "this will become

HAW

50955 DooId: 32423508

Page 66

---

## Page 67

a part of our record." Although to date no "report" has

been found, Lifton

told me that handwritten notes on the

Bureau's examination of the windshield have been located.

Subsequent to the Commission's investigation, Arlan

Specter, in an interview for Life Magazine, is quoted as

stating that. "the window report was key."

As stated previously,

during Frazier's testimony Specter stated "this report will

remain a permanent part of the Archives."

Lifton feels it

is important that it was not stated that this would become an

important part of the Warren Commission's record.

Another matter that Lifton has concerned himself with

is the question of why the Dallas Secret Service agents did

not file reports until some five days (i.e. November 29, 1963)

after the events in Dallas.

Lifton told me that the report

was scattered throughout the indexes of the warren Commission

materials; he referred

me to a summary (CD-3) which he des-

cribed as an enlightening document.

Lifton mentioned an incident in which secretary tillon

-- who was heading

for Japan with numerous other officials -

returned hom when he heard of Kennedy's death and subsequently

bawled out Secret Service Chief James Reilley: Lifton thinks

it would be interesting for us to get into Reilley's and

Dillon's files.

Meeting in Paul Daly's Office

Dan, Ed and I met with Paul Daly, Tom Bresson, and

Bill Nettles (324-4256) in an introductory session to our

Warren Commission-related

review.

We were informed that the Bureau did not have an

index of documents provided to either the Warren Commission

or Archives, and that the preparation of such an index would

be an extensive undertaking; i.e., producing one as requested

in my letter of October 14, 1975 would take some

45 days.

However, Bresson agreed that it would not be difficult to

cull out and produce for us all agreements between the Warren

Commission and FBI pertaining to the dissemination of documents.

Daly professed. complete cooperation while at the

same time commenting upon our Committee's finite existence.

We explained that we would be making numerous categorical

document requests in the very near future..

More specifically,

we agreed that in the first instance we would be requesting

access thereby vitiating the need for extensive sanitization

by the Bureau.

Re :

Meeting at George Kalaris' Office (Chief, CI Staff)

Yestereay afternoon Ed, Dan and I met with George

Kalaris and Bob Wall to discuss the document production

problems that had arisen.

Although the CIA had originally

accorded us total review of the unexpurgated documents, they

changed in midstream taking the position that we can only

review highly sanitized versions.

Kalaris explained that the reason for the change

was that he had not realized the magnitude of classified

documents in the files; he stressed the need to protect

sensi

tive

sources and

I told him that this was

completely unacceptable to the Committee, noting that the

Rockefeller Commission had been allowed lin the person of David

Belin

to review unsanitized documents and reiterating that

we had ourselves for some six or seven days had access to

these documents.

His explanation was that it was a "mistake"

for this to have been allowed.

Our present document agreement

stands as follows:

We have the right to review all' but the

most highly sensitive documents at the Agency in

Kalaris will personally

summarize the very few highly sensitive documents.

We will be able to check any of the summaries

Mr. Wall called Mr. Paul Hartman to clarify the identification

of the five documents found in the Oswald 201 in 11/22/63.

Mr. Hartman advised that the two FBI documents were the following:

1) 5/12/60 Report of SA. John W. Fain "Fund Transmitted

to Residents of Russia"

Received: 5/25/60 (original

file location is noted as

74-500)

2) 10/31/63 Report of SA Kaa Ck, re Oswald FPCC activities

New Orleans

Mr. Wall promised to make more efforts to determine which two

Bureau reports were included in the 201.

II.

Two CIA documents that were forwarded to the Warren Com-

mission and that are now of interest to the SSCI surfaced

during a discussion with Don Nischer. They should be included

in a

document request.

1)

3/6/64 Memo from Helms to Rankin, complete inventory

of 30 items in possession of the CIA on 11/22/63.

2) 1/31/64 Memo from Helms to Rankin "Information Developed

by the CIA on Activity of Lee Harvey Oswald in Mexico City,

9/28-10/3/63. "'

In a tootnote, Helms explains that the

Oswald 201 was opened on 12/9/60 shortly after the CIA

had received a memorandum from the State Department

which listed a number of recent American defectors to the

USSR.

Memorandum for the Record

From:

Faul Wallach

Date:

October 28, 1975

Re:

Meeting with James Angleton in Senator

Schweiker's office, October 3, 1975C

On Friday afternoon, October 3, 1975,

ä meeting

attended by

Senator Schweiker, Senator Hart (after the first 30 minutes) .

Rick Inderfurth, James Angleton and his attorney

The meeting was

essentially a question and answer

session between ourselves and Angleton and later evolved

into a lecture by Mr. Angleton.

Angleton focused on our

inquiry into the Warren Commission's report from his counter-

intelligence standpoint.

The first subject raised by Angleton was Nesanko's

defection.

Angleton

explained that the Agency at first had

a passing contact with him in Geneva when he claimed that he

would provide cestain information for a few hundred dollars

to take care of gambling losses.

He asked never to be con-

tacted again. Subsequently, he defected to the West and

according to Angleton, his defection was not bona fide.

(Apparently the only agency that

thought he was bona fide was

the FBI.)

Angleton mentioned Cheraponov (phonetic) who apparently

had given information to numerous tourists while they were in

MOSCOW.

The CIA had reason to believe that Cheraponov had

been identified, captured and executed. When Nesanko came out

of the East the only docunent had wịth

him was one depicting

the capture of Cheraponov at the frontier.

Angleton added

that this struck at his own bona fides and he had to correct

himself.

Apparently Nesanko was tortured upon his defection,

anâ Angleton commented that this type of pressure was not one

that a bona fide defector would have ever allowed himself to

be subjected to.

Nesanko told the Agency that an internal

dossier of Oswald's crossed his desk and that "he was a living

witness" as to Oswald's connection with the KGB.

Angleton

stressed the major defector that the Agency

had had in the early

'60's. He recounted a conversation he

had

with the major defector on the day the President was shot

during which the major defector said

"I have bigger fish.to

fry and I don'i: vant to jet involved in the Oswald case.

S

However, the major defector said that the norma

handling

of military men who defected to the west went eventuatly

through Department 13 where the defector would belinterrogated

with respect to his army weapons experience.

However, nowhere

in Nesanko's papers and/or his statements, did he mention

that Oswald had gone through Department 13. (Angleton's

statements are unclear here, let's ask him again about all this.)

Angleton commented on Des Fitzgerald's trip to Paris

where he met with a Cuban agent who subsequently returned to

Cuba. This agent was never heard from again.

Angleton told us that the man sent to Cuba as the

Russian Ambassador - Alexiev

(phonetic) - was a KGB escort

officer for Raoul Castro.

This led Angleton into a discussion

of two photographs, the first being a photo found by the Mexican

police, of Leninoff (phonetic), a Mexican KGB agent with Castro,

and the second, a

Angleton told us that it was "news to him that the

Bureau had any relationship with Oswald."

He suggested that we speak to ex-FBI agent Burt

Turner (who now practices law in D.C.) about Cuba and any

possible Oswald relationship to Cuba.

Angleton told us that Eon Andronov (phonetic) wrote a

travel article on New Orleans and did an interview with Garrison.

Angleton also told us #bout Kruschev's visit with Nasser

during which visit Kruschev told an American journalist that it

was a "right wing conspiracy in the U.S. which led to President

Kennedy's assassination."

Angleton stressed that in the U.s.s.R.

(unlike the U.S.), the leadership receives strong guidance from

the intelligence community and that it is unlikely that Kruschev's

statements would have been off-the-cuff.

Angleton then noted Hammer's nephew's trip to New York

City, the ostensible purpose of which trip was to write about

the JEK assassination. The nephew is a well-known KGB agent.

My notes read "R.s. -- question re Oswald and his

defection - nothing happened - jurisdiction to Pentagon --

that's breakdown."

Angleton stated that in the old days, Oswald's return

Angleton again mentioned the double agent to) Mexico

- in complex with Leanovov (phonetic).

Angle

tioned the threat by Castro against the Preside

He told us that Des Fitzgerald would not have met the

agent in Paris unless he had specific instructions to do so.

As you will recall, Angleton told us that this agent returned

to Cuba and never reappeared.

Angleton believes this would

have given the Soviets an understanding of the seriousness of

the U.S. threat to Castro.

Angleton told us of a series of arguments he had with

Dulles when he was sitting on the Warren Commission.

He

essentially argued that we should not "close the door in the

future."

He stressed that the Soviet Union has Department 13

working under its directorate and that it is well known that

Department 13 once upon a time conducted political assassinations.

The 1961 defector told the Agency of Department 13's plan of

assassinating world leaders.

My notes state "General Rodin

was head of - his file in

Department 13 -- therefore expected

executive action to assassinate him -- 1961 defector defected

in Helsinki -- said go easy on telegrams, said agent within

•CAA organization - new man in CAA had a code name but was a

German

Angleton stressed the importance of the 1961 defector.

It broke down the Soviet's departmentalization; as the man had

been involved in various intelligence activities and Angleton

estimated that it would take the Soviets years to write a

damage report.

Therefore the second defector could have been

either to mitigate the damage or strictly vis-a-vis Oswald.

That key detecto ta no be inter gate a bea

ment 13 and this was not in Oswald's official file.

Angleton believes that Miboutou's assassination in

Kenya was by the KGB.

Angleton reiterated what he believes to be a Cuban

connection with Oswald. He noted again the name Leninov (phonetic)

and two photos of Castro with Leninov, including a photograph of

Soviet expert.

(Apparently Turner had a run-in with Hogver.)

My notes say

"Did not want to believe responsible fo

sassination

Angleton suggested that it was "conceivable that the

1961 Russian could be brought in to testify."

Angleton told us that Cuban intelligence calls itself

He feels that RFK's assassination was brought on by'

the underworld's animosity.

accountable for these deeds.

D. Accuses President Johnson for the fact that the U.S.

organized a plan to assassinate leaders and proclaim

V Warren Commission

A. Assassination information was withheld from the

Warren Commission.

B. David Belin agreed that the assassination information

investigation.

The Warren Commission found no substance in allegations that

the Cuban government was connected with Oswald.

D. The New Orleans Times - Picayune dated September 9, 1963

carried Castro's statement of September 7, 1963.

DWYER/GREISSING

OCTOBER 28, 1975

SUBJECT: CIA'S POSITION ON SSC ACCESS TO OSWALD'S 201 FILE

Mr. Wallach and Mr. Elder initially agreed that members of

the SSC could review the Oswald 201 file at the Agency. Accord-

ingly, Dwyer and Greissing met with Mr. John O'Reilly of the

review staff on October 3, 1975. Mr. O'Reilly introduced Dwyer

and Greissing to Mr. Paul Hartman of the CI staff whose respon-

sibilities have included maintenance of the Oswald 201 since the

assassination of the President.

During the two weeks following October 3, Dwyer and Greissing

conducted a partial review of the Oswald 201 in the presence of

Mr. Hartman. (The Oswald 201 fills seven file drawers and pur-

portedly includes all materials, generated by the CIA, other

government agencies and the Warren Commission, which relate to

Oswald.

and the investigation of the President's assassination.)

Mr. Hartman, during these review sessions, outlined his involve-

ment in maintaining the files and was most cooperative in ident-

ifying cryptograms and personnel and answering questions relative

to routing materials within the CIA and filing procedures. The

last date on which Dwyer and Greissing conducted review of the

Oswald 201 was Thursday, October 16.

On Saturday, October 18, Mr. Elder advised Wallach that Mr.

Hartman needed more time to review

the Oswald 201 before Dwyer

and Greissing had an opportunity to review them. Dwyer then

called Elder that afternoon. Elder told Dwyer that Hartman

had to review documents for "sensitive methods and techniques."

Dwyer asked if this would prevent the SSC from reviewing files

that had previously been reviewed without the sanitization of

files that Elder implied would henceforth be undertaken. Elder

approved this and advised Dwyer to call Hartman about returning.

to the CIA on Tuesday, the 21st, as had been planned at the

meeting with Hartman on

the 16th.

On Sunday, October. 19, Dwyer called Hartman who advised that

Elder instructed him to pull all documents which involve "sen-

sitive methods and techniques" and the dissemination of informa-

tion to "foreign service." Hartman told Dwyer that the SSC could

not return to the CIA until his review of the Oswald 201 was com-

pleted. Hartman indicated this would take one week.

On Monday, October 20, Dwyer called Elder to clarify the

weekend discussion with Hartman. Elder advised that the files

that had already been reviewed by SSC would not have to be inspected

by the CIA. Elder said he felt "nothing would be taken out."

Elder said that the SSC could return to the CIA on the 2lst or

22nd. Hartman was subsequently contacted; he said that any

arrangements would have to be negotiated with Elder.

Wallach spoke to Elder on Thursday, October 24. Greissing

then spoke to Elder. Elder said he would make arrangements for

Greissing and Dwyer to return to the CIA on Tuesday morning, the

25th.

Dwyer and Greissing spoke to Elder's

secretary on Tuesday

morning, the 28th. She directed them to a review room where she

said the documents would be ready. None of the documents were

there. Elder's office was notified; the documents were purportedly

on their way. Mr. Hartman arrived about 45 minutes later:

He

advised that the CIA had a task force headed by Mr. O'Reilly who

was reviewing all the Oswald 201. Hartman advised that most of

the documents were being declassified and prepared for public

release, except those that reflected "sensitive methods and

sources" and "liaison relationships." These kinds of documents

were being whited out; they then would be ready for SSC review.

Hartman said that this project has been conducted all weekend

and that it would be completed by next Monday. Dwyer and Greissing

informed Hartman that it was, at least, reasonable to expect a

notification from the CIA that materials would not be ready,.

especially in light of arrangements made by Elder on last Thursday.

(Hartman denied any knowledge of these arrangements.) More im-

portantly, Dwyer and Greissing told Hartman that these terms of

review were unacceptable.

The SSC should demand access to all CIA materials in their

unsanitized form. Otherwise, it is impossible to determine what

materials, if any, were not made available to the Warren

Commission.

Additionally, those materials, so far reviewed, involving

"sensitive methods and sources," contain information that was

critical to the Warren Commission's

analysis of Oswald's visit to

Mexico City. The Warren Commission

stated Oswald was in Mexico

from September 26, 1963, to October 3, 1963. One of the unanswered

questions in the Warren Commission report is the identity of the

individual pictured in Commission Document 237. The CIA denied

any knowledge of the identity of the individual.

The Mexico City section of the Oswald 201 includes informa-

tion obtained through "sensitive methods and sources." This in-

formation indicates that the unidentified individual visited the

Soviet Embassy

on October 1 and October 4, 1963, and impersonated

Lee Harvey Oswald. A dispatch from Mexico City to Headquarters

reveals that J. C. King, the Western Hemisphere Chief, knew the

identity of the individual. The "sensitive methods and sources"

the CIA wants to protect, in this case, are camera surveillance

techniques and electronic surveillance of conversations in the

Cuban and Soviet Embassies in Mexico City, both techniques

employed to record events which occurred nearly twelve years

ago.

Any agreement

between the CIA and SSC which precludes a

complete review of Oswald materials in their raw form by the

SSC is dangerous then for two reasons: 1) it will automatically

preclude any complete review of materials the CIA had that might

have been critical to the Warren Commission findings; 2) it would

set a precedent preventing any future investigative body to

utilize all information developed by the Agency with regard to

Oswald.

PROPOSED AREAS OF INVESTIGATION IN THE CIA/WC STUDY

The following memo is a brief outline of proposed areas

where the CIA might not have admitted either "direct or indirect"

contact with Lee Harvey Oswald.

I. Mexico City

1.

One of the issues that was never resolved by the CIA

(or FBI) for the Warren Commission is the indentity of the individual.

Publicly surfaced on 11/23/63 when SA Bartwell Odum showed the

photograph (with an identifying background trimmed off) to

Odum asked Marguerite if she had ever

seen

the man in the photograph.

Marguerite told Odum she hadn't

(but erroneously commented a few days later after seeing picutres

of Oswald's assassin in the newspaper that the photograph must

have been of Jack Ruby.

2.

Richard Helms (in addition to maintaining that the CIA

had no indirect or direct ties

to Oswald)also submitted an

affidavit stating that the CIA had forwarded a photograph of the

unidentified individual to the FBI on 11/23/63 and that the

photograph was taken outside the Untied States between July and

November, 1963.

.. Hord tu 1010/43?

Helms supplied OUT message #74673, dated 10/10/63 and

Illed to State, Navy and FBI, to the Warren Commission.. It reads,

"On 10/1/63 a reliable and

sensitive source in Mexico reported

that Lee OSWALD contacted the Soviet Embassy in Mexico City

inquiring whether the Embassy had received any news concerning

The physical description supplied for Lee Oswald Is:

obviously, incorrect. Oswald was 5'9"

23 years old.

Helms also supplied OUT Message 77978; dated 10/23/63

and forwarded to Navy, to

the Warren Commission Headquarters,

requested "two copies

of the most recent photograph you have of

subject.

"(The Oswald 201 reveals that Navy did not provide

a photograph of Oswald to the CIA until 11/26/63.)

3. Materials now contained in the Oswald 201 at the CIA

reveal critical information about the "mistaken identity" of

Oswald.

According to Mr.

Hartman, in whose presence SSCI

members have been reviewing the file, none of the following

material referred to was filed in Oswald's 201 on the day of the

President's assassination.

The following information has been

obtained from "sensitive

sources and methods"which are camera

surveillance on entrance, to the Soviet and Cuban Embassies in

Mexico City and taps on phone lines of the Embassies.

The CIA Station was never forwarded a photograph of

Oswald despite Headquarters request to Navy on 10/23/63 which

was predicated by a teletype from Station to Headquarters on

10/15/63 requesting "pouch photo Oswald." The Station confirmed

that the individual (who had been incorrectly referred to as

Lee Oswald on 10/1/63 by "reliable" sources in Mexico) was not

Lee Harvey Oswald from wire photos of the accused released after

he was taken into custody by Dallas police.

The material now in the Oswald 201 reveals that CIA

Station developed information on Lee Harvey Oswald on 9/28/63

when he visited the Cuban Embassy to obtain a Cuban intransit

visa to Russia. The

"sensitive source" of this information

was electrical

surveillance on the Cuban Embassy. Cables from

CIA Station to Headquarters state, however, that

the Station could

find no photographic evidence that Oswald visted the Cuban

Embassy on the 28th because it was a Saturday and, since the

Cuban Embassy was closed for operational purposes, camera surveillance

was not being conducted.

Another cable reveals that the tape of

the intercepted conversation inwhich Oswald participated was

erased.

During the two day period of 11/22-23/63, Station cabled

Headquarters that a check of all records of photographic surveillance

* on the Cuban and Soviet Embassies from August until November re-

vealed no record of Lee Harvey Oswald visiting either Embassy.

The 201 file contains another intercepted conversation

with Soviet Consular officials in which a man identifies himself as

Lee Oswald and asks to speak to the Russian he had spoken to the

day before. (Date of conversation uncertain.) Another cable to

There are also photographs in the 201 file of the same

Finally, the FS Dispatch dated 11/23/63 was pouched to

on 10/4/63÷

Attached to this material is a letter addressed to

J. C. King, Chief WH Division from Winston Scott, Chief of Station,

Mexico City, in which Scott, in reference to pouched photos,

describes the unidientified individual as a man "who is known

to you.". (George O'Toole, author of Assassination Tapes and

former Chief of Problems

and Analysis Section, told the Boston

Phoenix that a CIA contact of his knows the identity of the

individual (Boston Phoenix, 5/27/75)).

The implications of these findings have great potential.

The following should be pursued.

a. Insistence on access to unsanitized material

The Washington Post reported in 10/20/75 that during the

Kennedy administrations, "CIA had 3,700 employees operating

under diplomatic or other official US titles overseas."

officials were known as CAS -- Controlled American Sources.

Most of Oswald's contacts with the American Embassy in Moscow

were with Richard Snyder.

The SSCI should ask the CIA for a list

A CIA report prepared in 1967 at the time of the Garrison

trial in New Orleans reveals that Carlos Bringuier, New Orleans

leader of the (anti-Castro) Cuban Revolutionary Council, had

been in contact with the Domestic Operations Division of the CIA

in New Orleans until April 1967. (The report also states that the

CRC was funded by the CIA.)

The Warren Commission Report records two events in which Oswald

and Bringuier had contact.

Oswald visited Bringuier in his shop

and asked him general questions about the CRC. Bringuier was also

one of the anti-Castroites with whom Oswald had a scuffle and was

arrested for disturbing the peace on August 9, 1963.

The SSCI should request access to all records reflecting all

Dan Dwyer

SUBJECT: FBI Investigation of the President's

Assassination

nomad if

-gora to ver-Javice

On September 18, 1975, Ed Greissing and Dan Dwyer reviewed the

Justice Department's anti-Castro files covering the late 50's

through early 70'g. The files of particular interest were those

of 1962 and 1963 during which time Lee Harvey Oswald was a member

of the Fair Play for Cuba Committee (FPCC) and allegedly attempted

to infiltrate anti-Castro organizations in New Orleans, and possibly

in Miami and/or Mexico City.

Attached is a list of those reports contained in the anti-Castro

Department of Justice file which relate to the FBI investigation

of the President's assassination. This list is important for two

main reasons. First, the reports represent a far more detailed

knowledge: of anti-Castro activities than was admitted to the Warren ..

Commission. by the Bureau: On May 5, 1964, Rankin sent a letter to

Hoover requesting all documents relative to FPCC, JURE Daban Revo:

lutionary, Junta), DRE (Cuban Student Directorate), Alpha. 66 and 30ths

of November Movement. for Dallas--Fort Worth in 1963 and related ac-.

tivities in New Orleans, Miami, Las Vegas and

other major U. S..

cities.:

At this- point, it has been determined that Hoover responded...

to Rankin!s: request by submitting a report which simply named of-

ficial directors and key activists of each organization in each:

locality and which-briefly outlined each organization's main ac-

tivitles.

Second, the Department of Justice files are important be-

cause they contain reports on individuals allegedly involved in

arconspiracy to assassinate the President. Specifically, some of

the names mentioned of particular interest are Gerald Patrick

Hemmings, Henry Williams, Frank Sturgis', Hargraves; Augustinovich,

BiblESeynour, the McLaney brothers and Tom. Kane (an alleged alias

?

of: Oswald).

Additionally, the Department of Justice files contain reports

by SAsHarten DeBrueys,

who is alleged to have been Oswald: s«FBI

contactainethe New: Orleans area: Finally, these FBI reports refer

to a raid conducted by the FBI on an anti-Castro training camp near

New Orleans on July 31, 1963 during which ten people were arrested

and ammunition was seized. It is very probable that this was the

raid referred to by William Morrow, a former CIA contract employee

and counterfeiter for the Cuban underground (cf IX-C-2-a-w (Morrow)).

Morrow maintains Oswald was involved in this training camp and

that Ruby was involved in an underworld operation that used it

as

a transfer point for narcotics from the Carribean to Texas.

These latter considerations fall into "conspiracy" territory

which is not the direct focus of the investigation.

However, the

individuals and events mentioned in these reports have been im

plicated with Oswald's connections with anti-Castro groups and

lower CIA echelons.

These Department of Justice files should be included in a

SUBJ:

John F. Kennedy Assassination

This memorandum will outline the major contemporary allegations regarding.

the intelligence communities' activities prior to and after the assassination.

of President John F. Kennedy. These major allegations were derived from the

study of the following sources: the Warren Commission Report and its 26

volumes of testimony and exhibits, the review of both FBI and CIA documents

at the Archives withheld from the public, the opinions of independent researchers,

and the information volunteered from individuals previously testifying before.the,

Warren Commission:

To further substantiate those allegations which have some foundation, it

would be necessary to pursue the following courses of action; request both FBI

and CIA documents available to the SSC through the third agency rule, interview

individuals who

have been involved in anti-Castro activities, and interview in-

dividuals who have knowledge of the FBI and Secret Service investigation of the

assassination.

This pursuit will elevate the Select Committee's inquiry one phase further

and careful consideration should be given to this additional pursult.

I. Allegation Lee Harvey Oswald was an: Informer

Background:

On January 22, 1964, J. Lee Rankin, General Counsel for the Warren

Commission, received a call from Wagonner Carr', Attorney General of Texas..

Carr advised Rankin that Henry Wade, District Attorney for Dallas, had In-

formed Carr that Lee Harvey Oswald was being paid $200 a month by the FBI

for information, from September 1962 unt1l President Kennedy's assassination.

At an emergency meeting of the Warren Commission held on the afternoon of the

to do. The Commission supports: their conclusions, and we can go home. and that

is the end of It.!! Although records of this meeting were ordered destroyed,

classyied.

some copies of the transcripts were salvaged, with this information retrieved..

On January 27, 1964, the Warren Commission, with additional members present,

again met In Executive Session. At this meeting, the problem posed by. this

allegation was discussed. Allen Dulles stated that, even if Oswald was an

Informer, FBI agents would deny it, even under oath. As a result, the Commission

only confirmed the Bureau's contemporaneous investigation of the assassination

and did not attempt to Investigate the veracity of this allegation.

There 1s also some evidence that indicates Oswald may have been an FBI

informant in New Orleans. Orestes Pena 1s a Cuban-American who owned the Habana

Bar in New Orleans in the early 1960s and was a member of the Cuban Revolutionary

Council (CRC) and Junta Revolucionaria (OURE), both anti-Castro organizations.

An FBI report of December 5, 1963 states that Lee Harvey Oswald and an

unidentified Mexican Cuban visited the Habana bar in September 1963. Pena claims

he told Carlos Bringuler, head of the Cuban Student Directory (DKE), about Oswald's

visit to his bar, however, an FBI report by S. A. Warren C. DeBreuys dated June 19,

1964 records that Pena had no personal knowledge of Oswald in the bar and that

he never Informed Carlos Bringuier about Oswald's appearance.

Pena's testimony to the Warren Commission on July 21, 1964 clearly con-

tradicts the points outlined by DeBreuys in the June 19 report, and that, in

fact, Pena testified he had reported Oswald's appearance and behavior at the bar.

Pena's testimony also reveals that he was heavily involved in anti-Castro

activities in New Orleans.

He testified he put up the bond money for Bringuier's

release after he had been taken into custody for fighting with Oswald in August

1963, while Oswald was attempting to distribute pro-Castro propaganda..

Pena's testimony before the Warren Commission suggests he was an FBI

informer, and that Warren DeBreuys visited him quite often after Pena Joined

the anti-Castro organizations, continually asking him for information about

Mexicans, and finally instructed Pena to refrain from becoming involved in

politics and to get information.

Additionally, Pena applied for a passport to Mexico on the same day as

Oswald. DeBrenys was transferred from New Orleans to Dallas to investigate

the assassination and then returned to New Orleans.

The SSC has recently been forwarded a letter through Senator Church's

office dated June 30, 1975 written by Orestes Pena. Prior to his: testimony*

before the Warren: Commission, Pena states: that he was threatened by : DeBreuys

and warned not to disclose Information regarding his role as an informer or

to mention: DeBrêuys name Pena volunteered to testify that Oswald was employed

by the Federal Government at the Custom's House in New Orleans; and offered

information regarding the Federal Agents with whom Oswald associated.:

Recommendations:

1. Interview Orestes: Pena regarding his anti-Castro activities

In New Orleans, his knowledge of Oswald's relationship with

anti-Castro groups and the FBI In New Orleans, and his re-

lationship with DeBrenys.

2. Interview Warren C. DeBreuys now located in the Washington area.

To further substantiate the allegation that Oswald was an FBI In-

formant, It is fact that S/A James P. Hosty!s name, address, phone number

and license plate number appeared in Oswald's notebook. (Hosty was the

agent in charge of the Oswald case in Dallas). In his explanation to the

Warren Commission, Hosty testified that he was "trying to learn the where-

abouts of Lee Oswald.....to determine whether or not he was employed in a

sensitive industry."

In his attempt to locate Oswald, Hosty Visited a Mrs. Ruth Paine,

on 1 November 1963, believing Marina Oswald was living with her at that time.

Mrs. Paine Informed Hosty of Oswald's occupation in the Texas School Book

Depository, which was certainly "a non-sensitive position." Hosty stated

that upon his departure he left his name and phone number with Mrs. Paine,

the rationalization for his name being is Oswald's book.

It should be noted that Hosty again visited Mrs. Paine on November 5;

1963, and was, at all times, acting independently in his attempt to procure

this Information, not under the specific direction of the Bureau. The Warren

Commission as well, offered no explanation for the appearance of all the in-

formation on Hosty listed In Oswald's notebook.

James. Gouchenaus, an independent researcher, is a potential source of

Information regarding Hosty's relationship with Oswald. While living in Seattle,

Gouchenaur had the occasion to meet Carver Gayton, an ex-FBI agent. Gayton

met Hosty while serving with him in Kansas CIty: (Hosty was: transferred to.

Kansas City after the assassination). Gayton related the following information

to Gouchenaur based upon conversations he had with Hosty in Kansas City. Hosty

had been Oswald's "handler" and the FBI listed Oswald as a "Potential Security

Informant." Hosty allegedly offered money to Oswald if he reported on a

regular basis. Oswald resisted this approach and Hosty tried to pressure.

Marina so that Oswald would comply. (Oswald, in fact, did write a letter

to

the State Department in the fall of 1963, requesting a Russian visa and

protesting the FBI's harassment of his wife).

Recommendations:

1. Interview Hosty.

2. Interview Gouchenaur about his conversation with

Carver Gayton.

3. Interview Gayton about his knowledge of the relationship

between Hosty and Oswald.

II. Allegation: A theory has been presented that by the end of the Eisenhower

Administration, the lower echelons of the anti-Castro forces established train-

ing camps throughout the Southeast. The groups were trained by ex-Batista

soldiers, as well as CIA contract agents.

Initially, the plan was to take over Cuba through the Bay of Pigs operation.

However, they failed to receive air support, causing this attempt to fail. The

groups began to distrust the Kennedys and the feeling spread through the camps.

Another plan to attack Cuba was halted when the President requested the

Lake Pontchartrain. camp be raided.

Thus; we have the allegation that the Kernedy Administration made efforts

in 1963 to dismantle CIA funded anti-Castro training groups.

On August 7, the SSC staff interviewed Robert D. Morrow who maintains

he was under contract with the CIA from 1961-1963 and headed the counterfeiting

TOP SECRET

operation for the Agency's Cuban underground organization. Morrow was re-

cruited by Mario Kholly who was employed by the CIA as a consultant. Kholly

was responsible for organizing the Cuban underground.

According to Morrow, Kholly tried to inform Attorney General Kennedy

of missile installations as early as 1961. Kholly also tried to inform that

there would be no underground support for Cuban force Invading the Bay of Pigs.

Morrow also maintains Kholly's information about the missiles since it would

be a source of humiliation to the Administration. Furthermore, after the

missile crisis, the Administration made efforts to dismantle Kholly's operations.

(This alleged effort initiated by the Administration may possibly be related

to testimony delivered to the SSC during assassination hearings that by 1963

the CIA had lost control of the lower echelons of the anti-Castro forces).

Morrow maintains that a CIA funded training camp for anti-Castro forces

on Lake Pontchartrain, Louisiana was operated by. Frank Sturgis, Carlos Bringuier

(Oswald's alleged associate from New Orleans), Clay Shaw, David Ferrie, and Jack

Ruby: (Allegedly, Ruby was shipping narcotics from Lake Pontchartrain to Dallas).

Morrow maintains some of the individuals Involved in the Lake Pontchartrain opera-

tion were involved in a conspiracy to assassinate the President.

Morrow maintained the Lake Pontchartrain camp was raided by the FBI, the

Secret Service and local law enforcement officials per order of the President

on August 1, 1963. Allegedly, ammunition was confiscated and I1 people were

arrested. As a result the anti-Castro Cubans sought to retaliate against the

President, thus bringing about his assassination.

Morrow was arrested on counterfeiting charges in Baltimore on October 1,

1963. Morrow, in the process of procuring kholly's diary, has already acquired

Kholly's secret papers on the organization of the Cuban underground.

Recommendations:

1. Interview Morrow in greater detail about the Cuban underground

operations.

2.

Procure Kholly's papers, memoranda and diary from Morrow.

Determine if individuals alleged to be Involved In a conspiracy

were under contract with Agency.

3. Examine materials at the Kennedy Library relating to Kholly's

meetings with the Attorney General.

4. Examine materials at the Kennedy Library relating to the

August 1, 1963 raid on the Lake Pontchartrain camp.

5. Examine FBI reports on surveillance of anti-castro groups

available at the Kennedy Library.

III. Allegation: The Secret Service obstructed the medical investigation:

of President Kennedy's assassination.

Jim. Gouchenaur also reported to the Committee that he had information

regarding the destruction and alteration of evidence in the investigation of

President Kennedy's assassination. Gouchenaur: befriended Elmer Moore, a

Secret Service agent of the Dallas office. Moore confided: to Gouchenaur

that he was ordered by the Inspector General's office of the Secret Service-

to destroy a: photograph glven to him by Eva Grant, Jack Ruby's sister. (We

have no other: information regarding the photo)

Moore also told Gouchenaur that he had been ordered to tell Dr. Perry;

who first treated the President at Parkland Hospital, to change his medical

report, which initially indicated that a bullet penetrated from the front.

Moore also indicated that he helped to prepare the original report on the

direction of the shots, and that the initial finding was that it was impossible

to determine from which direction the shots had originated.

Moore told Gouchenaur that: whatever he: had contributed to a cover-up.

at the time of the assassination was done on orders: from Washington and Mr.

Kelley of the Secret Service headquarters.

Recommendations :

1. Interview Gouchenaur about his discussions with Elmer Moore.

2. Interview Elmer Moore about his participation in the

Investigation of the President's assassination.

3. Procure Moore's report on the direction of the shots.

4. Interview Mr. Kelley of the Secret Service.

IV. Allegation:: The CIA withheld substantive: information from the Warren

Commission.

A.

It has recently been determined by the SSC that Oswald was a target

of the CIA mail cover operation after he had defected to Russia. Hoover sent

a confidential memo to the State Department on June 3, 1960 which raised the

possibility that an imposter may be using the credentials of Lee Harvey Oswald.

Recommendations :

Request the Agency to provide all Information regarding data

compiled on Oswald from the mail cover operation. Determine

if the FBI was forwarded copies of Oswald's mail.

B. The SSC:has determined that the CIA withheld information about Castro

assassination plots: from the Warren Commission? Richard Helms testified that

he did not think information regarding Castro

assassination plots was important

to the Commission's Investigation; he assumed Dulles would have Initiated the

inquiry since Helms believed Dulles was privy to assassination plots. This.

seems

Ironic in Light of an Investigation outlined in Warren Commission Document=

935 (withheld from public review). The CIA had a "well placed individual who

has: been In close: and prolonged contact with ranking officers of the Cuban DGI.

The source "did not know whether Oswald was an agent of the daI or any other.

directorate or department of the Cuban government," but that "(the agency) has .

queried him in detail on possible contacts between Lee Harvey. Oswald and the :

DGI prior to the assassination of President Kennedy. I-

Helms: also reported to the Warren: Commission that strict security measures

were taken upon news of the assassination by Cuban intelligence... The source;

believes these orders were issued "because of the possibility that the U.s.

might have taken some- type of action against Cuba and the DGI itself."

It should be noted that David Belin, Assistant Counsel to the Warren

Cormission, has stated that Information on assassination plots might have In-

fluenced the overall investigation.

The question of Cuban Involvement in the President's assassination might ..

be viewed in light of Castro's statement of September 7, 1963. The Cuban leader

said::

- таки - 4.

'ios

"We: are prepared to fight: them and answer in kind.....

United States leaders should think that: if they are

aiding terrorist plans: to eliminate Cuban: leaders,

they themselves will not be safe."e

Recommendations:

Request CD 935 and other documents listed in Appendix B

relevant to the CIA's Investigation of the President's assassination.

MEMORANDUM

To: Paul Wallach

From: Dan Dwyer and Ed Greissing

Subject: CIA/FBI Investigation of the President's

Assassination

I. DOCUMENT REQUESTS

This part of the memo will summarize and sexpand those

considerations relative to the initial request to the Agency

and the Bureau discussed on September 19th.

A. It was proposed that briefings can be arranged at

the Agency

and the Bureau to clarify the SSC's

investigation and, thereby, hopefully, facilitate

document requests

in the future.

A review of the

internal memoranda of the Warren Commission indicates

that the following personnel assisted Hoover and

Helme in handling document requestarof, the Warren

Commisston:

1. Bureau Personnel

Belmont, Al

Cadigan, James C.

Cunningham, Cortlandt

-2-

B.

C.

The Agency and especially the Bureau forwarded thousands

of documents to the Warren Commission. Although the Archives

has provided an inventory of all documents collected by

the Warren Commission from the Bureau and Agency the

SSC is assuming an overwhelming responsibility in account-

ing for that information provided to the Commission.

Therefore it seems reasonable that the SSC's initial

request, augmented

by briefing with the CIA and FBI, focus

on the following:

l.. An inventory from the FBI and the CIA of

all documents

forwarded to the Warren Commission.

2. Copies ofrakkrequests.forard defrom Ran nettinover

and Helms.

(N.B.

It is unclear at this point

whether these letters should be requested from the

Archives or from the appropriate intelligence agency

to which they were forwarded.)

This approach does not seem unreasonable; the Bureau

and the Agency undoubtedly have maintained inventories

described above.

Additionally, this approach would be

advantageous for the following

reasons:

1.

It would free the SSC from the immediate task of

accounting for documents forwarded to the Warren

Commission.

2.

It would transfer the burden of responsibility for

clarifying what documents were given to the Commission

to the FBI and CIA..

3. It would provide a relatively simple way to determine

what documents were not provided to the Commission.

4.

It would preclude, to a certain degree, serious

confrontationbetween the SSC and the FBI or the CIA

on whether documentation had previously been provided

to the Warren Commission.

Futurerdocuments requests to the FBI might then centes

otherfollowings

Any and all documents relating to the destruction

of a letter hand delivered to the Dallas FBI

office by Oswald about 10 days prior to the assass-

ination including namesof individuals involved in

the letter's destruction.

* David Aaron

: May 20, 1975

SUBJECT: Warren Commission and the Intelligence Community - April 9, 1975

In discussion with Mr. Crosby from Minneapolis, he made the

following comments:

The Miami Police had a tape recording of November 9, 1963

which was released in 1967 concerning (Oswald and a Cuban?).

Crosby drew

attention to a note in the Archives concerning

a J. A. Miltier, a threat contained in the FBI file, not in the

26 volumes. The file 1s CD1347, filed Internal Security: Oswald

in Russia.

The Archives and the FBI deny knowledge of the tape

recording. Miltier denied the threat that was to be made on

Kennedy's life on December 1 to the FBI. In the threat, Miltier

apparently made some comment about Brown of the National States

Rights Party being Involved in a plot.

Comment:

I don't quite know how all this fits together,

or whether it does. But the thrust of Crosby's point was that

Oswald may have been in contact with Cubans in Florida, or some-

one posing as Oswald. He also may have been in contact somehow

with Miltier and Brown:

MEMORANDUM

TO : David Aaron

FROM : Dan Dwyer and Ed Greissing

DATE

: May 29, 1975.

SUBJECT: Initial Overview of Warren Commission

The Warren Commission contains a massive amount of information

regarding intelligence operations.

Therefore, this initial overview

focuses on three main Investigative areas relating to CIA operations

and Department of State communications: (1) Oswald's Russian ex-

perience; (2) Oswald and the Fair Play for Cuba Committee; and (3)

Oswald's trip to Mexico City.

Reviewing the Commission Exhibits and Hearings necessitated a

careful reading of the Report, with particular attention to the

chronology of events and intelligence operations responses. This

approach afforded an opportunity to develop a working knowledge of

the chronology of events and an understanding of how the Report is

organized, the thrust of the Commission's analysis, and how the Com-

mission utilized Documents and Exhibits.

Focusing on limited areas of investigation proved to be a

workable and efficient research technique.

It seems reasonable

to continue with this technique but to further define specific

areas of investigation. The Mexico City case, for example, in

vites inspection of declassified Commission Documents not avail-

able in the Commission Volumes but which could easily be requested

(ef. references to these sources in Mexico City case).

Lt. Martello advised that on August 9, 1963, Lee

H. Oswald was arrested for disturbing the peace;

and desired to see an FBI agent.

Oswald was interviewed by S. A. Quigley - August 15, 1963.

Stated four months ago he met his wife, married her

in

Fort Worth, and moved to New Orleans.

After coming to

New Orleans, he began reading literature distributed by

the FPCC, and it was his understanding from this that

the 0:3.

the main goal and theme of the committee is to prevent

the U.S. from invading Cuba or interfering in the

political affairs of that country. Doesn't consider

FPCC to be communist.

On August 21, 1963, Lee H. Oswald appeared on Radio Station

WDSU's "Conversation Carte Blanche" with Edward S.

Butler, Staff Director of the Information Council of

the Americas. This organization specializes in the

distribution of anti-communist education material to

Latin American countries.

Oswald stated that the FPCC

is not communist-controlled and that he, Oswald, is a

Marxist.

On August 30, 1963, Bill Stuckey had a conversation with

Oswald after the broadcast at which time Oswald

said he

had met his wife in Russia and married her there.

Oswald stated Russians had gone soft on communism

and that Cuba is the only real revolutionary country

in the world today.

Informant No. T-7, familiar with Cuban activities in

New Orleans, on September 9, 1963 said Oswald was un-

known to him.

Frank Bartes, a delegate to the Cuban Revolutionary

Council In New Orleans on September 10, 1963 said

Oswald was unknown to him.

Informant No. T-8, acquainted with some phases of the

Communist Party activity In New Orleans, advised on

October 1, 1963 that Oswald was

unknown to hi.

Special Agent Hosty gave in his testimony that they

didn't have any Information concerning the FPCC in

Dallas or Oswald's distribution of leaflets on April 21,

1963 until early June, and no action was taken.

Mrs. Oswald said the name. A. J. Hidell was signed by her

when forced by her husband.

According to his wife, Lee H. Oswald was the lone

member of the FPCC in New Orleans. He had himself

arrested so he would become known believing this would

help when he got to Cuba--took clippings of arrest

to Mexico with him.

No record of Dr. A. J. Hidell.

signature of Lee H. Oswald and A. J. Hidell states

they are the same.

QUESTION 16

What action was taken by the Department of State,

when

it received information from

the CIA in

October 1963 concerning

the appearance

of Oswald at the Soviet and Cuban Embassies in

Mexico City?

Did the Department of State at this time under-

take to prepare a look-out card or take any action intended co

result in the cancellation of Oswald's passport? If so, please

describe the actions taken.

ANSWER - A CIA report concerning (Lee Henry) Oswald's

appearance at the

Soviet Embassy

in Mexico City

only

(the report did not contain any infornation regarding

his appearance at the Cuban Embassy in Mexico City)

was received in the Passport Office

on October 16,

1963.

Records show that the passport file

Lee Harvey Oswald

was obtained and that the CIA report

was read by

Mr. James F. Richie, an attorney, and by Mr. Carroll H.

Seeley, Jr.,

a supervisory attorney

in the Legal Division,

on October

22, 1963.

Since the report indicated no

ground for determining that Oswald

was Ineligible for a

passport, & determination was made that no action by the

Passport Office was required.

No action was, therefore,

taken to prepare a lookout card, nor was any action

taken intended to result in the

cancellation of Oswald's

passport.

ATTACHMENT B

QUESTION 17

He would like a description of the procedures, 1f any,

within the Department for revoking a passport already issued

should the Department determine or be informed that there are

grounds for doing

so,

and a memorandum on the differences, 1f

any, between the

grounds for refusing to issue a passport and

the grounds for revoking a passport already issued in the kinds

of situations which might reasonably have applied to Lee Harvey

Oswald®

ANSWER - The attached reprint from the Federal Register

of January 12, 1962. sets forth the

substantive and pro-

cedural regulations governing the

denial and revocation

of a passport.

The grounds for the revocation of a

passport and

the refusal of a passport are identical.

There are no differences between the substantive

or regulatory grounds for refusing

to issue a passport,

and the grounds for revoking a passport.

When grounds

are discovered for the revocation of a passport, a letter

of tentative withdrawal is prepared, setting forth the

specific regulation under which the

action is'taken,

and the basis for the action. The bearer of the passport

1e requested to surrender his passport and is informed

of his right to seek a review

of the Department's setion,

1n

accordance with the Department's Passport Regulations.

(See Attached Reprint from the Federal Register.)

There were no grounds consonant with the Passport

Regulations to

take adverse passport action against

Oswald prior to November 22, 1962.

1. On 1 October 1963 a reliable and sensitive source in

Mexico reported that an American male, who identified himself

as Lee OSWALD, contacted the Soviet Embassy in Mexico City

inquiring whether the Embassy had received any news con-

cerning a telegram which had been sent to Washington. The

American was described as approximately 35 years old, with

an athletic build, about six feet tall, with a receding hairline.

2. It is believed that OSWALD may be identical to Lee

(Henry)OSWALD, born on 18 October 1939 in New Orleans,

Louisiana. A former U.S. Marine who defected to the Soviet

Union in October 1959 and later made arrangement through the

United States Embassy in Moscow to return to the United

States with his Russian-born wife, Marina Nikolaevna Pusakova,

and their child.

Scope

The purpose is to determine whether the intelligence agencies of the Federal

Government reported to the Warren Commission fully and accurately on their

relationship, contact and knowledge concerning Lee Harvey Oswald.

It would

not address other alleged questions. concerning the Warren Commission Report

and the assassination of President Kennedy.

Approach

The first step will be to examine the early Warren Commission material, the

new information that has come to light, and the charges concerning Oswald's

relationship to the federal intelligence agencies.

we will determine whether it's useful to interview additional people or con-

duct a broader investigation.
