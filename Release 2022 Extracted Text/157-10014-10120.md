Re: Oswald in New Orleans

This morning I called (504/821-2000) "Chief"
Giarruso of the NOPD for the purpose of determining whether
Oswald was arrested in New Orleans other than on August 9,
1963. Lt. Hunt transferred me to Major Earl Burmaster's,
explaining that he was the "keeper of records".

After explaining that we were merely asking a
question that had not been asked (and not investigating .
the NOPD) I inquired as to whether there were any other *
arrests (or records).on Oswald. Burmaster called me back
and suggested that I call Sgt. Wenstein in the Intelligence
Unit (ext. 311). I spoke with Sgt. Wenstein who promised
to get back.to me. :

At 3:30 p.m. I called Wenstein again. He was
out of the office, but had left the matter with Sgt.
Loicano. : He was most cooperative and with the Oswald file -
in hand stated that the "rap sheet" revealed only the
August 9, 1963, arrest. (Included in the documents per-
taining to said arrest was a memorandum by Lt. August
Lang, and an August 12, 1963, "“inter-office memo" to

Major. Prossens.)

I thanked the Sgt. for his cooperation, leaving
my phone number should anything else come to this attention.

RE: LBJ LIBRARY/KENNEDY ASSASSINATION

Sharon Faucet of the LBJ Library called me back this
morning about my inquiries of May 12, 1976. Ms. Faucet checked
Library materials to determine if there were any records in-
dicating what was discussed at a May 10, 1967, meeting attended
by Johnson, Helms, and George Christian. Faucet told me that the
"Diary Back-Up" Records have a note about the May 10, 1967,
meeting which reads "Richard Helms wants to see you about Drew
Pearson column."

Faucet also reported that there were no memos reflecting
a March 22, 1967, meeting between Johnson and Helms, Cater,
McPherson, and Gardner. Faucet said the meeting probably was
about the Katzenbach academic study and possibly about the Guam
conference which occurred the week before.

I again listed the materials Faucet promised to send the
Committee:

1) List of Helms' meetings in the White House during

the Johnson administration;

2) Copies of Johnson's Daily Diary Logs for March

19-22, 1967, and April 24-May 23, 1967;

3) Pink sheet listing Marvin Watson/FBI memos regarding

I called Sharon Faucet (sic) of the LBJ Library in
Austin this morning and informed her that Epstein and I saw
Marvin Watson at his home in California, and that Mr. Watson
showed us about four file cabinets in the basement of his
home which he represented to contain his papers from the White
House. I also informed Ms. Faucet that Watson had said he was
moving back to Texas at the end of May and would deposit those
files in the Johnson Library.

I also requested Faucet send the Committee the Library's
public statement regarding Johnson's taping system and the list
of Marvin Watson memos/FBI memos dealing with the Garrison in-
vestigation withheld from research because of derogatory material.

I also asked Ms. Faucet to check the Library's materials
for any meetings involving Helms between March 19-23, 1967, and
April 24-May 22, 1967... Faucet promised to check and call me back
at mid-day. She also mentioned that the President met with
Defense, State, and CIA every Tuesday to discuss national security
affairs, but there were no memos of these meetings until late
1967. :

Ms. Faucet also informed me that Dick Jacobs, Deputy
Archivist for Presidential libraries, was the Archives' official
in Washington who would be handling our document request from

Austin.

MEMORANDUM
To: Paul Wallach
From: Bob Kelley

As I mentioned to you, Senator Mathias is making an in-
vestigation of his own as a member of the Select Committee, as
permitted by Committee procedures, into the aspect of the possi-
pie connection between Operation Mongoose and the JFK assassina-
tion.

In this connection, he is interested in obtaining, any FBI
documents concerning contacts. between a Cuban exile, Jose Aleman
and FBI agents, among which were SA George Davis and Paul Scran-
ton. He understands that in 1962-1963, Aleman had regular meet-
ings with Santos Trafficante which Aleman reported to SA Davis
and Scranton. In particular, Senator Mathias is interested in
any documents relating to a meeting between Aleman and Davis
and Scranton on November 22 or 23, 1963.(the day or the day
after the JFK assassination). Also, Aleman may have had a meet-
ing with FBI agents on April 17, 1971 (the day of the Bay of Pigs
Invasion) .

I would appreciate. it if you would make a request to the
FBI for material relating to the above.

Re: Executive Session Testimony of Edward P. Morgan
and Hank Greenspun

Attached for your review is a copy of an article captioned
“Fidel Castro ordered Jack Kennedy's Death", as it appeared in
the March 1, 1976 edition of the Las Vegas Sun. You will
note that Hank Greenspun wrote "evidence in my possession...
provides a clearly marked trail leading to logical conclusions
as to why the Kennedy brothers were killed. That path leads
straight to the door of a vengeful Castro."-

At the instruction of theCommittee, Fritz and I have
for the past two weeks attempted on a daily basis without
success to contact Greenspun telephonically. A telegram
was also dispatched to Greenspun on 3/8/76 indicating the Committee's
interest in discussing. the evidence in his possession. The full
Committee unanimously approved a subpoena for Greenspun.

The Committee also approved a subpoena for Washington
attorney Edward Pierpoint Morgan. Morgan was the attorney of
-xecord for Messrs. Roselli and Maheu in 1967. It would appear
that he was the source of the Drew Pearson 1967 assassination
article which preceeded (some might say precipitated) the 1967
IG report. It was also Morgan's information that led Pearson
to go to Chief Justice Warren on January of 1967. Recently
received FBI reports indicate that at President Johnson's urging
the Bureau reluctantly interviewed Morgan in April of 1967.

The reports recount that Morgan's clients had told him in detailed

(49

err
fashion of "Castro's retaliation plots against Kennedy", and that
Morgan knew that "two of Castro's men were living in New
Jersey."

The return date for Morgan's subpoena is March 19. [1l0am;
Room 608], and for Greenspun's, March 24 [2pm;S-407]. Senator's
Schweiker and Hart will be presiding at these executive sessions.
If your Senator would like to attend, please let me know at.
the earliest possible moment. Additionally, certain underlying
reports should be reviewed prior to the Morgan session. These

will be available for your review.

‘CURTIS R.

March 22, 1976

The Honorable Frank Church
Chairman, Senate Select Committee

To Study Government Operations

With Respect To Intelligence Activities
Washington, D. C. 20510

Dear Mr. Chairman:

We will soon submit our Subcommittee Report to the full
Senate Select Committee on Intelligence on the performance of
the intelligence community in connection with the phidihdit Saba tie
of the assassination of President John Kennedy.

As you know, this work was carried out by a very few staff
members over a three-and-a-half month period and limited to the
narrow. confines of the subject stated above.

We had neither the intention nor the capability to follow
every rumor, analyze every theory, investigate every charge, or
study every alleged conspiracy. We were not given such latitude
by either our fellow committee members or Senate Resolution 21
establishing the Select Committee.

Thus, our Subcommittee Report does not attempt to provide
a comprehensive evaluation or critique of the Warren Commission
Report. It does, however, set forth information -- pertaining
particularly to certain U. S. and Cuban activities -- which was
not made available to the Warren Commission but which appears to
havé been relevant to the Warren Commission inquiry.

Our Subcommittee Report raises new questions in the following
broad areas:

* The details of Lee Harvey Oswald's contacts with
Soviet and Cuban embassy officials in Mexico;

* Oswald's contacts with anti-Castro groups;

* Oswald's contacts with pro-Castro groups;

142.

HW.50955 DocId:32423508 Paye 16


The Honorable Frank Church
March 22, 1976
Page 2

* The degree to which knowledge of efforts to
assassinate Castro by agencies of this government
were deliberately concealed from the Warren
Commission;

* The degree to which attitudes prevalent in the
FBI in the sixties affected either the assassina-
tion investigation or the FBI dissemination of
information to the Warren Commission.

We believe such questions can only be answered by further
investigation. Such investigation could be carried out by a
small unit of the present Select Committee, by the Government
Operations Committee or any other appropriate standing committee
of the Senate, or by Senate resolution establishing a new Select
Committee for this purpose. In-any case, the knowledge and
expertise of our own staff members active in this matter should
be preserved and exploited. We believe a three to six month
period would be required to pursue these questions.

We request a meeting of the full Committee at the earliest
possible occasion to present our Subcommittee Report, to. discuss
its release by the Committee, and to seek guidance on further
action to be taken.

Sincerely,

Schweiker

MEMORANDUM

To: Paul Wallach

From: Jim Johnston

Date: November 7, 1975

Subj: pee Conversation re: Kennedy Assassination
° :

Dr..Harrison (phone: 659-8374), who is working on a
history project with Senator McGovern, called to pass on
information he obtained on an assassination plot against
Kennedy. A woman he talked to claims that the CIA and
OAS (the OAS was the French Secret Army Organization
opposed to DeGaulle) plotted to assassinate Kennedy and
DeGaullé in 1961 during Kennedy's trip to France. Kennedy's
death would be made to appear accidental but the OAS would
claim credit for DeGaulle's. A “hit man" was selected and
his name is Romundo (phonetic).

The woman had planned to interview Romundo in October
or November 1972 for CBS because Romundo identified Bernard
Barker and another of the Watergate conspirators as two of
the people who contacted him about the vlot. She claims
Romundo identified these two from photographs of a group
of people, none of whom were identified for him. General
Salan, head of the OAS, called off the assassination.

The woman originally was told by CBS that Dan Rather
would go to Paris with her to interview Romundo. Rather
backed out. She then teamed up with a man named Baer
(phonetic) who was Newsweek Bureau Chief in Paris in 1972.
She claims Baer was working for CIA and attempted to hin-
der the attempts to interview Romundo. She never got the
interview because Romundo left Paris before she got to
talk to him and made off with the advance he was paid.

She talked to Peter Kalisher in Paris who gave her
some help. He ‘told her she was free to file a story but
because she had no verification, Kalisher did not think it
would be printed. Therefore, she has not filed a story on
this information.

want to talk to any authorities about this. If we are

the practice of the FBI
to interview immigrants
from behind the Iron Cur-
tain on a selective basis
and that Marina Oswald was
one of these persons to
be interviewed (528.R)

MEMORANDUM

To: Files
From: Paul Wallach
Date: December 3, 1975

Re: Telephone conversation with Wendall Roache

Following up on yesterday's initial phone contact,
I spoke with Roache this afternoon for about 20 minutes.
He again was cooperative and agreed to come to D.C. as long
as it was cleared with his superiors.

Roache explained that in 1963 he was in charge of
IN&S' New Orleans Border Patrol Station; i.e., Station senior,
which was not in the Customs House. The Station reported
directly to the New Orleans District Office, which at that
time was run by Edward L. Cupp. Bob Brewer was then in charge
of the B.R. section in the Regional IN&S Office in Richmond,
Va.

According to Roache, IN&S' role is to determine who
is an alien, and prevent unauthorized border crossings.
However, frequent additional requirements were levied upon
IN&S (such as supplementing federal marshalls). In the
instant area, IN&S New Orleans was charged with the responsi-
bility of surveilling various Cuban "groups" in New Orleans.
Although Roache cannot specifically recall who initiated the
requirement, he assumes it came through Justice and stated
that Cupp should be clearer on the details.

Included in this surveillance was the group of "nuts"
headed by David Ferrie. Roache knew the details on Ferrie
i.e., dismissal from Eastern Airlines, homosexual with per-
verse tendencies ("nuttier than a fruitcake"), etc. He stated
that Ferries' office - on a side street between St. Charles
and Camp -- (we'll have a street map for him) was under
surveillance [although he never surveilled it, another inspector
drove him past it and identified it]; that Lee Harvey Oswald --
who was identified by IN&S as an American when he first appeared
on the New Orleans street scene (he does not recall the cir-
cumstances surrounding the identification) -- was seen going
into the offices of Ferries'group, and "Oswald was known to
be one of the men in the group."

Roache was aware that Ferries’ group was anti-Castro,

that Ferrie had a plane at the airport [a C-5 or 5W] and that
it was believed that Ferrie was going to take his brigade --

q
HW 50955 DocId:32423508 Page, 34 /*


which was "being trained by a 6-foot ex-Marine" -- at
Lake Poncetrain. He further stated that Ferrie like young
men and was known to "give these guys all sorts of pills
at the training camp and take movies of them."

Roache stressed that the NOPD (specifically the
intelligence division) and the East Metie's (phonetic)
Sheriff's Office had reports on Ferries' group. He added
that "Garrison had something; I read his reports in the
newspaper and they were correct, "he received good intelli-
gence information, whether he was using it for politics
or not." Roach also noted that (1) Garrison was all eyes
and ears in the French Quarter and (2) that he had heard
Ferrie was running when he was killed.

Roache did not know:
(1) Whether Oswald ever visited the training camp;
(2) about any organized crime tie-ins;

(3) about Oswald being arrested for getting into
a fight;

(4) about Oswald's alleged anti-Cuban politics;

(5) whether Oswald had any contacts with other
law enforcement and/or intelligence agencies;

(6) of a restaurant called "Pedro's";
(7) specific dates for any facts described herein.

Roache himself had seen Oswald on only one occasion:
when Oswald was passing out handbills at a point not too far
from Jackson Square {also not too far from the Trade Mart).

A most interesting occurence was touched on by
Roache. He related that Ron Smith happened to receive a call
from the N.O.P.D., which at that time had Oswald in custody.
Apparently Oswald would only speak Russian and the N.O.P.D.
deducted that he was Russian. Smith went to the N.O.P.D. and
Roache believes that he identified Oswald as an American citizen.
After that, Oswald spoke in English. Roache does not know if
Smith filed a report. He did state that he talked to Smith
about it two weeks ago, adding that he had no objection to
my telling Smith that he had referred me to him.

We generally discussed IN&S record keeping. Apparen-

tly almost all of Roache's reports to Cupp were oral. He
does not believe that any reports were written on the afore-

HW 50955 DocId:32423508 Page 35 2


fies fay

mentioned points, with the exception of the levying of
requirements on IN&S.

Roache had limited, if any, contact with De Oweys,
or any other FBI (or CIA) agent "I knew him." He also
told me that IN&S did not have informants in these groups.
(No idea of anyone that had.)

I asked Roache who else beside Cupp, Smith and he was
likely to have known about Oswald. (I assume we can get
IN&S records.) He suggested Russell Bruce.

IN&S local investigations office (no BP office)
would have checked out Cubans, etc. in Dallas. (Let's get
their agents' lists too.)

Re: Carver Gayton

As we discussed, I would appreciate your interview-
ing ex-FBI agent Gayton in Seattle on Friday, January 16, 1976.

There will be two general areas of inquiry. The
first is Warren Commission related, and more specifically in-
volves James Gouchenaur's statements (which have a ring of
plausibility) that SA James P. Hosty told.Gayton that Oswald
was a psi who's "status had changed". Gouchenaur also related
that Hosty had been trying to develop Oswald as a psi, that
Oswald had a mail drop and was being pressured to inform (on
what is a good question) and that Hosty even went to Oswald's
apartment to leave a note (against Bureau regulations) when
he hadn't heard from Oswald. According to Gouchenaur, these
statements were made to Gayton after "Hosty blew an organized
crime stake-out in Kansas City and Gayton helped him cover up."

Gouchenaur would also have us believe that Gayton
left the Bureau primarily because of his dissatisfaction with
their handling of the "King case" and investigation of his assas-

sination. In this regard Gayton is alleged to have stated that

HW 50955 DocId:32423508 Page 37


although the Bureau had been tailing King for years, the tail

- was pulled off the morning of the assassination; that the King

assassination was an embarrassment to the Bureau.

As I mentioned, it is imperative that we proceed
cautiously as there is some question as to Gouchenaur's credi-
bility. Mike and I will talk to you about this and other mat-

ters before your departure.

Re: Telephone Conversation with Wendall C. Roache

Yesterday's interview with Orest Pena produced two
names for us to follow up on (1) Wendall Roache (I&NS), and
(2) David Smith (U.S. Customs). I immediately contacted Steve
Blackhurst and Bob McBrien, Justice and Treasury Departments
respectively, to facilitate the location of these persons.

This morning John Matson (I&NS) called and informed me
that Roache was presently with the Border Patrol in Celexio,
California [714-357-1143]. I informed Matson that I would
be in touch with Roache; Matson suggested that I just touch
base with Roache's supervisor, Eldon Wooley.

Wooley informed me that Roache was on the 4 to 12
shift and would call me as soon as.he came into the office.

Roache called at approximately 3:55 (E.S.T.). TI
provided him with some background on the Committee; he knew
who we were and stated "you fellows are doing the partial
reopening of the Warren Commission." I also told him that
although we had contacted IsNS headquarters to secure his
name, we do not discuss what a witness tells us with anyone
outside the Committee.

It is my impression that Roache was not surprised to
hear from us. [Possibly notified by I&NS in D.C., but that
doesn't follow from my conversation with Matson.] I also
believe that Roache was relieved to hear from us. ["I've
been waiting twelve years to talk to someone about this."]
He expressed a desire to cooperate fully; willing to come to
D.C. at our convenience.

Roache immediately stated: "You want to talk to Ron L.
Smith too, don't you?" I hedged and asked him why did he
think that. He responded that "Ron had gone down to the
police station after receiving a call from the police [N.O.P.D.],
something about Oswald arrested and they thought him to be a
Russian." Roache informed me that Smith is’ presently with
IsNS' El Centro Office. :

HW-50955 Docld:32423508 Page 39 : i


a2 =

Roache began talking about Oswald. He “saw him around
frequently," and recalled "that he had an office in... ."
I cut him off, politely suggesting that we go over all of
this in an interview session.

I asked Roache to let me know a convenient date for
his trip. He talked to someone [it was probably his supervisor
whose voice I heard in the background] and then asked couldn't
we come there. I said that although it wasn't a usual practice,
it might be practical in view of our desire to also speak to
Mr. Smith. I then suggested to Roache that he let us get in
touch with Smith. I left it with Smith that we would be
getting back to him within two days.

In view of the Smith and Roache interviews -- along with
the possibility that James Smith (U.S. Customs) is in San
Diego -- it would expedite matters to have someone go out to
California. I mentioned this to Ed; we agreed to firm things
up tomorrow.

Re: Ronald L. Smith

Ron Smith (INS) finally returned my call this
afternoon (714-352-6307; 352-0521). Ron did not want to
come in to testify, primarily because “he would have
nothing to add." I stressed that our fact finding mission
required that we evaluate and put the pieces of testimony
together. Ron agreed to come in.

Ron was a Boarder Patrol Inspector with the New
Orleans Station in 1962 and 1963, transferring to Blain
(phonetic), Washington, in April of 1963. One seemingly
uneventful day, he received a not so unusual radio call
requesting verification of an alien, i.e., the First
Precinct of the N.O.P.D. had an individual in custody who
claimed to be Cuban. Responding to the call, Ron proceeded
to the First Precinct where he interrogated a prisoner
(in fact, not sure if booked or aware of charges) named
Lee Harvey Oswald, who was claiming to be Cuban. (Ron does
not recall if he was speaking Spanish -- and has no recol-
lection on his own of Oswald speaking Russian.) Ron could
not give me a date, the names of any persons at the jail,
nor the specifics (or even generalities) as to what Oswald
said. After five minutes of "interrogation," Oswald admitted
that he was an American citizen and Smith took off.

He does not recall discussing this event with anyone,
including co-workers at INS; however, when Oswald's picture
hit the press, Ron. immediately told his wife "this is the
guy I interviewed in New Orleans."

Ron admitted frequent contact with Orest Pena. Pena's
brother told him that Orest was working for (or was going to
work for) the FBI. He also recalls Custom's David Smith.

Re: Conversation with Mark Hollanbaugh (Shanklin's attorney)

I called Hollenbaugh again today to inquire as to when
Shanklin would be appearing for his executive testimony
before the Committee. For the record, I orginally contacted
Hollanbaugh early this week after Paul Daly had informed
me that he was representing Shanklin. Hollanbugh came on
quite strong and informed me that he wanted to review our
documents prior to Shanklin's testimony before Edwards'

House Subcommittee; after which testimony we would then talk
to Shanklin and reach a determination as to whether or not
Shanklin would appear here. I.told him that this was not
acceptable, that as I had mentioned to him in original
conversation, whatever documents we:were going to use

in Shanklin's deposition would be available to him prior

to the deposition for his review. but that I in turn wanted

a commitment as to whether or not Shanklin would appear.
Hollenbaugh cited some statutory authority for his position,
continued screaming.

I then discussed the issuance of a subpoena with Messrs.
Schwarz and Smothers who concurred in my decision and authorized
the securing of such subpoena from the Chairman. However,
in the interim -- after I had contacted the FBI's Paul
Daly to secure Shanklins' address for the purpose of serving
the subpoena -- Hollenbaugh called me back and said that
Shanklin would be as cooperative with the Committee and that

he would be in at. the earliest possible date.

in New Orleans in the early 1960's and who is still with
INS -~ was up on temporary assignment in Washington and

: that we could, if we desired, interview him before he left

he provided the following information: J. H. Gunther (retired
from Los Angeles office 4 years ago); Albert Thurmond (OIC

MEMORANDUM

TO: Paul Wallach

FROM: Dan Dwyer

DATE: November 19, 1975

RE: Scheduled Interview of Alonso Hudkins on November 20, 1975

I. Background Information

A. Alonso Hudkins: Personal Background

A Secret Service report indicated that Hudkins started
his employment with the Houston Post (the newspaper for which
he reported the President's assassination) about one month
before the assassination. It is unknown how long he has been
affiliated with the Baltimore News American. (George O'Toole
alleged that Hudkins was once employed by H.L. Hunt during which
time he was contacted by the CIA to undertake an assassination
effort.)

B. Allegation that Oswald Was an FBI Informant

The Warren Commission met in Executive Session on January
22, 1964 to discuss the allegation that Lee Harvey Oswald was
an FBI informant. J. Lee Rankin, General Counsel of the Warren
Commission explained that Waggoner Carr, Attorney General of
Texas, had called him that morning and told him about the rumor.
Carr identified the source of the rumor as Dallas District Attorney,
Henry Wade.

On January 24, Chief Justice Warren and Rankin met with
Carr, Wade, Assistant District Attorney William Alexander and
Leon Jaworski and Robert Storey. The Texas group reported that
the rumor may have originated with Alonso Hudkins, reporter for
the Houston Post.

In an undated memo for the record (probably written shortly
after the 24th), Rankin states that he discovered a Secret Service
report of S.A. Bertram dated 1/3/64 on January 23. The report
stated that on December 18, Hudkin advised Secret Service that
Allan Sweatt, CHief Criminal Division, Sherriff's Office, Dallas.
mentioned that Oswald was being paid $200 a month since September
1962 by the FBI "as an informant in connection with their sub-
versive investigation". Hudkins also reported that the number

100

HW 50955 DocId:32423508 Page 58


page 2

assigned to Oswald was S-172.

Rankin's memo further notes that the Secret Service ad-
vised on January 24 that Chief Sweatt stated he heard the in-
formant rumor from Assistant DA, Alexander.

The routes that the FBI-Oswald rumor followed are pe-
culiar. The Warren Commission was informed by Carr, who heard
the rumor from Wade. Wade's assistant attributed the rumor to
Alexander, who said he received it from Hudkins. However,
Hudkins maintains he heard the allegation from Sweatt, who
maintained he heard it from Alexander. (N.B. Neither Hudkins
or Alexander testified before the Warren Commission)

Hudkin's involvement in publicizing the allegation since
1963 is more confounding. In 1973 Hudkins told a reporter for
the Philadelphia Inquirer that he had invented the numbers $-172
and S-179 (also connected with an alleged Oswald informant
status) and leaked the information during a phone conversation
in order to determine if the FBI had tapped his telephone.

In an article published in the March 19, 1975, Hudkins
wrote that the S-172 number was "made up" by himself, Assistant
DA, Bill Alexander and Hugh Aynesworth (who was a reporter for
the Dallas Morning News). Hudkins arranged a conference call,
the three talked about Oswald's informant status, and "within
30 minutes" an FBI agent visited Hudkin's office to ask him
questions about the Oswald story. From this exercise, Hudkins
determined that the FBI had tapped one of the three's respective
phones.

C. Hudkin's Allegation That Oswald Learned of a Plot to
Assassinate Castro While Oswald Was in Mexico City

A Secret Service report by S. A. Bertram (12/14/63)
states that on December 12, 1963 Hudkins advised that he received
information from Felton West, Houston Post Washington Bureau
representative, that Oswald heard of an American plot to assassi-
nate Castro while he was in Mexico City, September 27-October 2,
1963. Alledgedly, Oswald was also informed that President Kennedy
and Vice President Johnson knew of the plot.

Secret Service Director Thomas Kelley talked to Felton
West in Washington. West denied having informed Hudkins about
any allegation involving Oswald's knowledge of an assassination
plot against Castro. Director Kelley concluded Hudkins was a
usually unreliable source of information.

D. Hudkin's Opinion That Jack Ruby's Roommate, George

Senator, Might Have Some Connection with the Murder
of Oswald

A Secret Service report of S. A. Bertram dated 1/3/64
reports that on December 16, 1963 Hudkin's called the Dallas
Secret Service office and opined, that George Senator had some-
thing to do with the murder of Oswald. Hudkins said that Ruby
had a brother and a nephew who worked for Jimmy Hoffa in Detroit
and that it was his "wild guess" that the Hoffa organization
might somehow be involved in the assassination. Hudkins also
noted that Ruby's attorney, Melvin L. Belli was an associate of
Atty Abt who was the first attorney Oswald requested after he
was taken into custody.

Furthermore, Hudkins reported that Atty. Thomas Howard and
Ruby were present for the Oswald “show-up" outside of Captain
Fritz's office in the Dallas.Police Headquarters on the evening
of November 22, 1963. Hudkins noted that Howard applied for a
writ of release for Ruby "two minutes before Oswald got to the
hospital" after the shooting by Ruby. Hudkins also noted he
knew Ruby.

II. Proposed Questions

1. Did Hudkins, in fact, participate in the conference call
as decribed in Hudkins' March story in the Baltimore News Ameri-
can. What was the approximate date of the conference call?

2. What indications did Hudkins have that would lead him
to suspect his phone was tapped by the FBI?

3. Did Alexander’ and Aynesworth also participate in the
conference call?

4. Who was the FBI agent that visited Hudkins "30 minutes"
after the conference call?

4a. Hudkins states in the 3/10/75 Baltimore News
American article that he participated in the conference call
at his "desk at the Houston Post". Where were Alexander and
Aynesworth? Were they subsequently interviewed by FBI agents?
What assurances from this experiement did Hudkins obtain that
it was his phone and not Aynesworth's or Alexander's that was
tapped?

5. Was Hudkins ever asked to testify before the Warren
Commission? Was Hudkins ever interviewed by a member of the
Warren Commission staff? If so, by whom?

NW 50955 Docid:32423508 Page 60 7 fy


Page 4

6. How long was Hudkins associated with the Houston Post
before the President's assassination? How long did Hudkins re-
main with the Post after the assassination?

7. Why did Hudkins wait until 1973 to "clarify" his role
in the rumor that Oswald was an FBI agent?

8. Who initiated the idea for the informant story? Hud-
kins? Aynesworth? Alexander? Sweatt? Why was the number S-172
(or S-179) used (especially in light of Alexander's presumed
experience with Bureau procedures)?

9. Did Hudkins ever receive any information from Felton
West regarding Oswald's alleged knowledge of an assassination
plot against Castro? Why, in 1963, would Hudkins place any
credence in reports of American assassination plots against
Castro?

10. Did Hudkins make up S-1797

1l. What function did Ruby's relatives serve in the Hoffa
organization?

12. Was Ruby present in Dallas Police Headquarters on Friday
evening of the 22th? With whom did he associate while there?

13. Did Hudkins know Ruby? If so, for how long? Have any
of Hudkin's notions about Ruby and the underworld been confirmed
since his reporting in 1963?

14. (O'Toole alleged that Hudkins was recruited by CIA to
undertake assassination while with H.L. Hunt oil company). De-
velop more background on Hudkins. Was he ever employed by H.
L. Hunt? :

Re: Oswald File at Secret Service

Ed and I completed review of over one-half of the
documents contained in the Secret Service files on Oswald.
The following are notes on areas of interest in the documents
and recommendations for appropriate document requests.

I. "Report of the Secret Service on the Assassination of
President John F. Kennedy."' This.is the report that Mr. Kelly
said was given to the National Archives. It has two volumes;
the first being an overview of preparation made by the Secret
Service in.liaison with Bureau and Dallas officials for the
President's trip, the second being appendices including
individual reports of Special Agents discussing the special
action they took after. the President's assassination. Of
particular interest are reports of activities at Parkland
Hospital and the transferral of physical evidence from Dallas
to Washington. It does not seem unreasonable to request a
complete copy of the Report. Specific points of interest are
outlined below, :

A. A report by Chief James J. Reilly dated 12/18/63
states that on 10/30/63 the Dallas FBI office gave the local
Secret Service office the name of a right-wing individual in
the Dallas area that it considered Dangerous. The report states
that S.A. Howlett met the informant of the right-wing group in
Denton, Texas (where right-wing protesters demonstrated against
Adlai Stevenson during his visit a few weeks before) on 11/15/63.
On 11/20/63 the informant visited TV Station KRLD in Dallas
with Howlett and.a representative of the Criminal Investigation
Division of Dallas Police, when film of the Stevenson demon-
stration was viewed. The informant identified the ringleaders;
stills of these were given to Secret Service agents.

Recommendation: Howlett's part of protective research
indicates that the Secret Service developed information on in-
dividuals in the general vicinity of Dallas who might be dangerous.
Request any and all memoranda relating to Howlett's investi-
gation of right-wing groups.

~~

Docld:32423508 Page 63


B. Secret Service Agent Roger C, Warner filed a state-
ment on 11/22/63 in which he stated that Special Agent James
H. Howard arrived with Special Agent William Duncan at Park-
land Hospital about 1:30 p.m. on 11/22/63. Howard informed
Warner that a suspect had been captured by Fort Worth Police.
Howard and Warner went to FWPD and questioned Donald Wayne
House of Ranger, Texas.

Recommendation: This is the first substantive report
about another suspect that has come to SSC attention. Request
any and all memoranda of Howard and Warren that reflect results
of questioning of Donald House.

C. In a statement dated 11/30/63, Special Agent Andrew
Berger recounted his experiences while guarding the ER with
SA Jonnson at Parkland Hospital. Berger stated that an un-
identified individual, who displayed CIA credentials, approached
Berger in the hospital and said he would be available. Berger
also stated that FBI SA Vincent S. Drain entered the hospital
saying he was "sent by Hoover." Accompanying Drain was an
individual whom Drain identified as a "doctor friend." Nurse
Nelson entered the ER at 1:30 p.m. An unidentified individual
(WM, 45 yrs, 6'2") attempted to forcibly enter the ER claiming
he was an FBI agent. SA Berger and SA Johnson had to forcibly
prevent the man from entering the ER. SA Killerman spoke to
the man and asked him to go to the end of the hall. This event
was witnessed by Congressman Olin Teague.

SA Johnson's statement of 11/30/63, affirms Berger's
recounting of the incident.

Recommendation: Request the Bureau to grant SSC access to
reports field by SA Vincent Drain on investigation at Parkland
Hospital on 11/22/63.

IL. A report filed by SA William H. Peterson on 11/25/63
reveals that Marina told Dallas Police during questioning that
she was interviewed by the FBI 10 days before the assassination.

Additionally, Peterson recounted talking to an unidentified
FBI agent present at the Dallas Station. The FBI agent, who
was on the subversive desk, said that Oswald had contacted two
known subversive agents 15 days before the assassination.

Recommendation: Request Peterson's memo. Be on the lookout
for references to FBI's knowledge of Oswald's subversive contact

Re: Telephone conversation with David Lifton

Yesterday afternoon I spoke with David Lifton (213-826-
1610;. 11818-1/2 Dorothy Street, Los Angeles, California) who
you recall had been mentioned to us by George O'Toole as the
“Warren Commission expert on the Secret Service."

Dave is presently working on a manuscript which he
hopes to have completed by the end of the year. Although he
is quite protective of his work, he did begin to freely discuss
certain areas that he thought we should be looking into.

The first such area centers on the windshield of the
President's car. Lifton explained that the reporters at Park-
land Hospital are quoted as having said that there was a bullet

d hole in. the windshield of the President's car. Apparently
pictures were taken at that time but they were not dispositive
of the "bullet hole" issue. In any event, the car was brought
aboard the plane the next day and taken to the White House.
After midnight on November 24, 1964, top FBI officials met in
the garage and examined the automobile for over three and one-
half hours. They were accompanied by two Secret Service agents
who did no more than watch the FBI conduct the examination.

The Secret Service agents' report allegedly states "of parti-
cular note to the FBI was the hole-in the windshield."

According to Lifton, there is no Bureau report on the
examination of the car. Four days later "a windshield of the
car was removed and stored in the White House garage." Apnroxi-
mately four months later the Warren Commission asked the Bureau
for a report’ on the windshield. The Bureau said that it did not
have one. However, it informed the Warren Commission that the
Secret Service had the windshield. However, this windshield had
no-hole-in it. (There is a question as to whether or not this
is the same windshield that was examined in the car.)

During the Warren Commission sessions, agent Frazier --
an. FBI lab expert -- testified and according to. the colloquy
apparently had a "report" with him on.the stand. During the
exchange before the Commission, Specter stated "this will become

GL

HW 50955 Docld:32423508 Page 66


HW 50955 DocId:32423508 “Page 67

a ‘part of our record." Although to date no "report" has
been found, Lifton told me that handwritten notes on the
Bureau's examination of the windshield have been located.

Subsequent to the Commission's investigation, Arlan
Specter, in an interview for Life Magazine, is quoted as

stating that “the window report was key." As stated previously, °

during Frazier' s testimony Specter stated "this report will
remain a Se miatct part of the Archives. Lifton feels it
is important that it was not stated that this would| become an
important part of the Warren Commission's record.

Another matter that Lifton has concerned himself with
is the question of why the Dallas Secret Service agents did
not file reports until some five days (i.e. November 29, 1963
after the events in Dallas. Lifton told me that the report
was scattered throughout the indexes of the Warren Commission
materials; he referred me to a summary (CD-3) which|he des-
cribed as an enlightening document.

Lifton mentioned an incident in which Secretary tillon
-- who was heading for Japan with numerous other officials —
returned hom when he heard of Kennedy's death and subsequently
bawled out Secret Service Chief James Reilley- . Lifton thinks
it would be interesting for us to Gee into Reilley' $ and
Dillon's files.

Re: Meeting at George Kalaris' Office (Chief, CI Staff

Yestereay afternoon Ed, Dan and I met with George
Kalaris and Bob Wall to discuss the document production
problems that had arisen. Although the CIA had originally
accorded us total review of the unexpurgated documents, they
changed in midstream taking the position that we can only
review highly sanitized versions.

- Kalaris explained that the reason for the change
was that he had not realized the magnitude of classified
: documents in the files; he stressed the need to protect sensi-
@ tive sources and techniques. I told him that this was
completely unacceptable to the Committee, noting that the
Rockefeller Commission had been allowed (in the person of David
Belin) to review unsanitized documents and reiterating that
we nad ourselves for some six or seven days had access to
these documents. His explanation was that it was a "mistake"
for this to have been allowed. :

Our present document agreement stands as follows:

We have the right to review all but the
most highly sensitive documents at the Agency in
their original form. Kalaris will personally
summarize the very few highly sensitive documents.
We will be able to check any of the summaries
against the original documents. if we deem it neces-
sary and, more over, have the right to right to
réview the sensitive documents in their entirety
should we desire to do so. I believe this’ is a
satisfactory agreement. -We will begin our full-
scale review on Monday morning.

I. The CIA has not yet been able to precisely define those

5 documents that were filed in Oswald's 201 file as of November
22, 1963. The CIA has no doubt that there were 2 documents
from State, 2 from the FBI and 1 from Navy; the question is
which 2° FBI documents were in the file. The three documents
that were definitely filed in the 201 are the following:

1) State--Foreign Service Dispatch #806; "Citizenship
and Passport: Lee Harvey Oswald"; 3/24/61

References: State A-173, 4/13/61

Mr. Wall called Mr. Paul Hartman to clarify the identification
of the five documents found in the Oswald 201 in 11/22/63.

Mr. Hartman advised that the two FBI documents were the following:

Received: 5/25/60 (original file location is noted as
74-500)

2) (10/31/63 Report of Sa~ Kaa ck, re Oswald FPCC activities
in New Orleans

Mr. Wall promised to make more efforts to determine which two
Bureau reports were included in the 201.

II. Two CIA documents that were forwarded to the Warren Com-
mission and that are now of interest to the SSCI surfaced
during a discussion with Don Nischer. They should be included
in a document request.

1) 3/6/64 Memo from Helms to Rankin, complete inventory
of 30 items in possession of the CIA on 11/22/63.

2) 1/31/64 Memo from Helms to Rankin "Information Developed
by the CIA on Activity of Lee Harvey Oswald in Mexico City,
9/28-10/3/63." In a footnote, Helms explains that the
Oswald 201 was opened on 12/9/60 shortly after the CIA

had received a memorandum from the State Department

Tox Memorandum for the Record
From: Paul Wallach

Date: October 28, 1975

Re: - Meeting with James Angleton in Senator
Schweiker's office, October 3, 1975.

On Friday afternoon, October 3, 1975 r meeting
was held in Senator Schweiker's office attended by
Senator Schweiker, Senator Hart (after the First 30 minutes),
Rick Inderfurth, James Angleton and his attorney .

The meeting was essentially a question and answer
session between ourselves and Angleton and later evolved
into a lecture. by Mr. Angleton. Angleton focused on our
inquiry into the Warren Commission's report from his counter-
intelligence standpoint.

The first subject raised by Angleton was Nesanko's
defection. Angleton explained that the Agency at first had
a passing contact with him in Geneva when he claimed that he

would provide ce:tain information for a few hundred dollars

to take care of gambling losses. He asked never to be con-
tacted again. Subsequently, he defected to the West and
according to Angleton, his defection was not bona fide.
(Apparently the only agency that thought he was bona fide was
the FBI.)

Angleton mentioned Cheraponov (phonetic) who apparently
had given information to numerous tourists while they were in
Moscow. The CIA had reason to believe that Cheraponov had
been identified, captured and executed. When Nesanko came out
of the East the only document had with him was one depicting
the capture of Cheraponov at the frontier. Angleton added
that this struck at his own bona fides and he had to correct
himself.

Apparently Nesanko was tortured upon his defection,
and Angleton commented that this type of pressure was not one
that a bona fide defector would have ever allowed himself to
be subjected to. Nesanko told the Agency that an internal
dossier of Oswald's crossed his desk and that "he was a living
witness" as to Oswald's connection with the KGB.

Angleton stressed the major defector that the Agency
had had in the early '60's. He recounted a conversation he
had with the major defector on the day the President was shot
d@aring which the major defector said "I have bigger fish, to
fry and I don't: want to get involved in the Oswald cass.

ES

ee

DocId:32423508 Page 74


However, the major defector said that the norm Randling’*~

of military men who defected to the West went e Npusidy

through Department 13 where the defector would interrogated
with respect to his army weapons experience. However, nowhere
in Nesanko's papers and/or his statements, did he mention

that Oswald had gone through Department 13. (Angleton's
statements are unclear here, let's ask him again about all this.)

Angleton commented on Des Fitzgerald's trip to Paris
where he met with a Cuban agent who subsequently returned to
Cuba. This agent was never heard from again.

Angleton told us that the man sent to Cuba as the
Russian Ambassador -- Alexiev (phonetic) -- was a KGB escort
officer for Raoul Castro. This led Angleton into a discussion
of two photographs, the first being a photo found by the Mexican
police, of Leninoff (phonetic), a Mexican KGB agent with Castro,
and the second, a

Angleton told us that it was "news to him that the
Bureau had any relationship with Oswald."

He suggested that we speak to ex-FBI agent Burt
Turner (who now practices law in D.C.) about Cuba and any
possible Oswald relationship to Cuba.

Angleton told us that Eon Andronov (phonetic) wrote a
travel article on New Orleans and did an interview with Garrison.

Angleton also told us about Kruschev's visit with Nasser
during which visit Kruschev told an American journalist that it
was a "right wing conspiracy in the U.S. which led to President
Kennedy's assassination." Angleton stressed that in the U.S.S.R.
(unlike the U.S.), the leadership receives strong guidance from
the intelligence community and that it is unlikely that Kruschev's
statements would have been off-the-cuff.

Angleton then noted Hammer's nephew's trip to New York
City, the ostensible purpose of which trip was to write about
the JFK assassination. The nephew is a well-known KGB agent.

My notes read "R.S. -- question re Oswald and his
defection -- nothing happened -- jurisdiction to Pentagon --
that's breakdown."

Angleton stated that in the old days, Coupe return

to the U.S. after his redefection would have beer ofthe highest
priority for the intelligence community. How Ww Al

Belmont left the Bureau, its counterintelli et ernal

Angleton again mentioned the double igen es Sico
-- in complex with Leanovov (phonetic). Angl fen men-
tioned the threat by Castro against the Presi ‘

He told us that Des Fitzgerald would not have met the
agent in Paris unless he had specific instructions to do so.
As you will recall, Angleton told us that this agent returned
to Cuba and never reappeared. Angleton believes this would
have given the Soviets an understanding of the seriousness of
the U.S. threat to Castro. :

Angleton told us of a series of arguments he had with
Dulles when he was sitting on the Warren Commission. He
essentially argued that we should not "close the door in the
future." He stressed that the Soviet Union has Department 13
working under its directorate and that it is well known that
Department 13 once upon a time conducted political assassinations.
The 1961 defector told the Agency of Department 13's plan of
assassinating world leaders. My notes state "General Rodin
was head of -- his file in Department 13 -- therefore expected
executive action to assassinate him -- 1961 defector defected
in Helsinki -- said go easy on telegrams, said agent within
-CAA organization -- new man in CAA had a code name but was a
German -- 7

Angleton stressed the importance of the.1961 defector.
It broke down the Soviet's departmentalization; as the man had
been involved in various intelligence activities and Angleton
estimated that it would take the Soviets years to write a
damage report. Therefore the second defector could have been
either to mitigate the damage or strictly vis-a-vis Oswald.

Thus the fact that stands out in Angleton's mind was
that this 1961 key defector told them it was "standard operating
procedure" for an ex-army officer to be interrogated by Depart-
ment 13 and this was not in Oswald's official file.

Angleton believes that Miboutou's assassination in
Kenya was by the KGB.

Angleton reiterated what he believes to be a Cuban
connection with Oswald. He noted again the name Leninov (phonetic)
and two photos of Castro with Leninov, including a photograph of
Castro being arrested. With respect to this Cuban connection,
Angleton once again suggested that we speak to Burt Turner who
was on the Soviet desk and in Angleton's opinion is,an™
Soviet expert. (Apparently Turner had a run-in with Ho er.)

My notes say "Did not want to believe responsible sassination
of President."

HW 50955 DocId:32423508 Page 76


Angleton suggested that it was “conceivable that the
1961 Russian could be brought in to testify."

Angleton told us that Cuban intelligence calls itself
DGI. :

He feels that RFK's assassination was brought on by
the underworld's animosity.

MEMORANDUM

TO: PAUL WALLACH
FROM: DWYER/GREISSING
DATE: OCTOBER 28, 1975

SUBJECT: CIA'S POSITION ON SSC ACCESS TO OSWALD'S 201 FILE

Mr. Wallach and Mr. Elder initially agreed that members of
the SSC could review the Oswald 201 file at the Agency. Accord-
ingly, Dwyer and Greissing met with Mr. John O'Reilly of the
review staff on October 3, 1975. Mr. O'Reilly. introduced Dwyer
and Greissing to Mr. Paul Hartman of the CI staff whose respon-
sibilities have included maintenance of the Oswald 201 since the
assassination of the President.

During the two weeks following October 3, Dwyer and Greissing
conducted a partial review of the Oswald 201 in the presence of
Mr. Hartman. (The Oswald 201 fills seven file drawers and pur-
portedly includes all materials, generated by the CIA, other
government agencies and the Warren Commission, which relate to
Oswald and the investigation of the President's assassination.)
Mr. Hartman, during these review sessions, outlined his involve-
ment in maintaining the files and was most cooperative in ident-
ifying cryptograms and personnel and answering questions relative
to routing materials within the CIA and filing procedures. The ™
last date on which Dwyer and Greissing conducted review of the

Oswald 201 was Thursday, October 16.

HW°50955 DocId:32423508 Page 80

74


On Saturday, October 18, Mr. Elder advised Wallach that Mr.
Hartman needed more time to review the Oswald 201 before Dwyer
and Greissing had an opportunity to review them. Dwyer then
called Elder that afternoon. Elder told Dwyer that Hartman
had to review documents for "sensitive methods and techniques."
Dwyer asked if this would prevent the SSC from reviewing files
that had previously been reviewed without the sanitization of
files that Elder implied would henceforth be undertaken. Elder
approved this and advised Dwyer to call Hartman about returning
to the CIA on Tuesday, the 2lst, as had been planned at the
meeting with Hartman on the 16th.

On Sunday, October 19, Dwyer called Hartman who advised that
Elder instructed him to pull all documents which involve "'sen-
sitive methods and techniques" and the dissemination of informa-
tion to "foreign service."" Hartman told Dwyer that the SSC could
not return to the CIA until his review of the Oswald 201 was com-
pleted. Hartman indicated this would take one week.

On Monday, October 20, Dwyer called Elder to clarify the
weekend discussion with Hartman. Elder advised that the files
that had already been reviewed by SSC would not have to be inspected
by the CIA. Elder said he felt "nothing would be taken out." i
Elder said that the SSC could return to the CIA on the 2lst or

22nd. Hartman was subsequently contacted; he said that any

HW 50955 DocId:32423508 Paye 81 7 2é


SECKEY

arrangements would have to be negotiated with Elder.

Wallach spoke to Elder on Thursday, October 24. Greissing
then spoke to Elder. Elder said he would make arrangements for
Greissing and Dwyer to return to the CIA on Tuesday morning, the
25th.

Dwyer and Greissing spoke to Elder's secretary on Tuesday
morning, the 28th. She directed them to a review room where she
said the documents would be ready. None of the documents were
there. Elder's office was notified; the documents were purportedly
on their way. Mr. Hartman arrived about 45 minutes later. He
advised that the CIA had a task force headed by Mr. O'Reilly who
was reviewing all the Oswald 201. Hartman advised that most of
the documents were being declassified and prepared for public
release, except those that reflected "sensitive. methods and
sources" and "liaison relationships." These kinds of documents
were being whited out; they then would be ready for SSC review.
Hartman said that this project has been conducted all weekend
and that it would be completed by next Monday. Dwyer and Greissing
informed Hartman that it was, at least, reasonable to expect a
notification from the CIA that materials would not be ready,
especially in light of arrangements made by Elder on last Thursday.
(Hartman denied any knowledge of these arrangements.) More im-

portantly, Dwyer and Greissing told Hartman that these terms of

HW 50955 Docld:32423508 Page 82 72


HW 50955

SECRET

review were unacceptable.

‘The SSC should demand access to all CIA materials in their
unsanitized form. Otherwise, it is impossible to determine what
materials, if any, were not made available to the Warren
Commission.

Additionally, those materials, so far reviewed, involving :
"sensitive methods and sources," contain information that was
critical to the Warren Commission's analysis of Oswald's visit to
Mexico City. The Warren Commission stated Oswald was in Mexico

from September 26, 1963, to October 3, 1963. One of the unanswered
questions in the Warren Commission report is the identity of the
individual. pictured in Commission Doc 2 7. The CIA denied

any knowledge of the identity of the individual.

The Mexico City section of the Oswald 201 includes informa-
tion. obtained through "sensitive methods and sources." This in-
formation indicates that the unidentified individual visited the
Soviet Embassy on October 1 and October 4, 1963, and impersonated
Lee Harvey Oswald. A dispatch from Mexico City to Headquarters
reveals that J. C. King, the Western Hemisphere Chief, knew the
identity of the individual. The "sensitive methods and sources"
the CIA wants to protect, in this case, are camera surveillance
techniques and electronic surveillance of conversations in the

Cuban and Soviet Embassies in Mexico City, both techniques

Docld:32423508 Page 83 wa,


employed to record events which occurred nearly twelve years
ago. :

Any agreement between the CIA and SSC which precludes a
complete review of Oswald materials in their raw form by the
SSC is dangerous then for two reasons: 1) it will automatically
preclude any complete review of materials the CIA had that might
have been critical to the Warren Commission findings; 2) it would
set a precedent preventing any future investigative body to
utilize all information developed by the Agency with regard to

Oswald.

On October 20, 1975, I conducted a telephone conversa~

Upon Lt./Col. McCann's arrival in early 1960, he assumed
the position of Assistant Attache and Yemained in this
capacity until his departure to the United States in

late 1962.

Lt./Col. McCann requested that we not discuss sensitive
details, contacts, etc., over the telephone and to save
such questions for a later time. He reminded me that he
has been debriefed, whereby, he is to forget all swe in-

TO: Paul Wallach

FROM: Dwyer/Greissing

DATE: October 22, 1975

SUBJECT: PROPOSED AREAS OF INVESTIGATION IN THE CIA/WC STUDY

The following memo is a brief outline of proposed areas
where the CIA might not have admitted either "direct or indirect"
contact with Lee Harvey Oswald.

I. Mexico City

1. One ‘of the issues that was never resolved by the CIA
(or FBI)for the Warren Commission is the indentity of the individual
pictured in Warren Commission Exhibit 237. The photograph first

Publicly surfaced on 11/23/63 when SA _Bartwell Odum showed the
photograph (with an identifying background trimmed off) to
Marguerite Oswald. Odum asked Marguerite if she had ever seen
the man in the photograph. Marguerite told Odum she hadn't

(but erroneously commented a few days later after seeing picutres
of Oswald's assassin in the newspaper that the photograph must
have been of Jack Ruby.)

2. Richard Helms (in addition to maintaining that the cIA
had no indirect or direct ties to Oswald)also submitted an
affidavit stating that the CIA had forwarded a photograph of the
unidentified individual to the FBI on 11/23/63 and that the
photograph was taken outside the Untied States between July and
November, 1963. wl wo fale *

Helms supplied OUT message #74673, dated 10/10/63 and
filed to State, Navy and FBI, to’ the Warren Commission. It reads,
"On LO/1/63 a relieable and sensitive source in Mexico reported
that Lee OSWALD contacted the Soviet Embassy in Mexico City
inquiring whether the Embassy had received any news concerning
a telegram sent to Washington. The American was described as
approximately 35 years old, with an athletic build, about 6'

ncore of tall with a receding hairline.". The cable reported that Lee Oswald

i may be identical to "Lee Henry Oswald", a former Marine, who had

defected to the Soviet Union.

HW 50955 Docld:32423508 Page 86


HW 50955

= =

CM PiOET
2 SWINE |

The physical description supplied for Lee Oswald is,
obviously, incorrect. Oswald.was 5'9", 160 lbs., medium build and
23 years old.

Helms also supplied OUT Message 77978, dated 10/23/63
and forwarded to Navy, to the Warren Commission Headquarters,
requested "two copies of the most recent photograph you have of
subject." (The Oswald 201 reveals that Navy did not provide
a photograph of Oswald to the CIA until 11/26/63.)

3. Materials now contained in the Oswald 201 at the CIA
reveal critical information about the "mistaken identity" of
Oswald. According to Mr. Hartman, in whose presence SSCI
members have been reviewing the file, none of the following
material referred to was filed in Oswald's 201 on the day of the
President's assassination. The following information has been
obtained from "sensitive sources and methods"which are camera
surveillance on entrance to the Soviet and Cuban Embassies in
Mexico City and taps on phone lines of the Embassfes.

The CIA Station was never forwarded a photograph of
Oswald despite Headquarters request to Navy on 16/23/63 which |
was predicated by a teletype from Station to Headquarters on

10/15/63 requesting "pouch photo Oswald." The Station confirmed
that the individual (who i rrectly referred to as

Lee Oswald on 10/1/63 by "reliable" sources in Mexico)was not
Lee Harvey Oswald from wire photos of the accused released after
he was taken into custody by Dallas police.

The material now in the Oswald 201 reveals that CIA
Station developed information on Lee Harvey Oswald on _9/28/63
when he visited the Cuban Embassy to obtain a Cuban intransit
visa to Russia. The “sensitive source" of this information
was electrical surveillance on the Cuban Embassy. Cables from
CIA Station to Headquarters state, however, that the Station could
find no photographic evidence that Oswald visted the Cuban
Embassy on the 28th because it was a Saturday and, since the
Cuban Embassy was closed for operational purposes, camera surveillance
was not being conducted. Another cable reveals that the tape of

the intercepted conversation invhich Oswald participated was

erased.

During the two day period of 11/22-23/63, Station cabled
Headquarters that a check of all records of photographic surveillance
on the Cuban and Soviet Embassies from August until November re-
vealed no record of Lee Harvey Oswald visiting either Embassy.

The 201 file contains another intercepted conversation
with Soviet Consular officials in which a man identifies himself as
Lee Oswald and asks to speak to the Russian he had spoken to the
day before. (Date of conversation uncertain.) Another cable to

FO

Doclda:32423508 Page 87

identical to Oswald is the individual "described a 6' tall,
athletic buidl." The files record the date of this photograph
as 10/1/63. 4 7
Soar enterny 2

There are also photographs in the 201 fife of the same
unidentified individual leaving the Soviet Union' on 10/4/63.
(The Warren Commission states Oswald left Mexico City on 10/2/63.)
(It has not been determined at this point if a transcript of an
intercepted conversation exists for 10/4/63 in which an "Oswala™
identifies himself.) A photo of the same unidentified individual

” has recently been ddded to the 201. It is dated 10/15/63 and
aa pictlires the individjal leaving the Cuban Embassy (holding something
us that resembles a visa.)

Finally, the FS Dispatch dated 11/23/63 was pouched to

Headquarters and included 4 photos of the unidentified individual taken
on 10/4/63¥ Attached to this material is a letter addressed to é
J. C. King, Chief WH Division from Winston Scott, Chief of Station,
Mexico City, in which Scott, in reference to pouched photos,
describes the unidientified individual as a man "who is known
to you." (George O'Toole, author of Assassination Tapes and

yw former Chief of Problems and Analysis Section, told the Boston
wo Phoenix that a CIA contact of his knows the identity of the

gut’ individual (Boston Phoenix, 5/27/75)).

4. The implications of these findings have great potential.
The following should be pursued.

a. Insistence on access to unsanitized material
b. Identification of all relevant cables, etc.
Requisition of those relevant‘ documents.

c.
i Preparation of a chronology of all known visits of an

*and 4 photos of the same individual taken on 10/1/63.
IL. Soviet Union

The Washington Post reported in 10/20/75 that during the
Kennedy administrations, "CIA had 3,700 employees operating
under diplomatic or other official US titles overseas." These Cla
officials were known as CAS -- Controlled American Sources.

Most of Oswald's contacts with the American Embassy in Moscow
were with Richard Snyder) The SSCI should ask the CIA for a list
of CAS in Moscow from 1959 until 1962 to determine if Embassy
officials whom Oswald contacted were associated with the CIA.

(NB 10/24/75. A list is unecesaary. Embasyy officials in Moscow wke</

had contact with Oswald should be identified. Then the CIA could ie

a SEGRE!

A CIA report prepared in 1967 at the time of the Garrison
trial in New Orleans reveals that Carlos Bringuier, New Orleans
léader of the (anti-Castro) Cuban Revolutionary Council, had
been in contact with the Domestic Operations Division of the CIA
in New Orleans until April 1967. (The report also states that the
CRC was funded by the CIA.)

The Warren Commission Report records two events in which Oswald
and Bringuier had contact. Oswald visited Bringuier in his shop
and asked him general questions about the CRC. Bringuier was also
one of the anti-Castroites with whom Oswald had a scuffle and was
arrested for disturbing the peace on August 9, 1963.

The SSCI should request access to all records reflecting all

vy  pringuier's contacts with the DCD in New Orleans.

FROM : Dan Dwyer

SUBJECT: FBI Investigation of the President's Assassination

On September 18, 1975, Ed Greissing and. Dan Dwyer reviewed. the
Justice Department's anti-Castro files. covering the late 50's «
through early 70'st The files of particular interest were, those
of 1962 and 1963 during which time Lee Harvey Oswald was a member
of the Fair Play for Cuba Committee (FPCC) and allegedly attempted
to infiltrate anti-Castro organizations in New Orleans, and possibly
in Miami and/or Mexico City.

Attached is a list of those reports contained in the anti-Castre

Department of Justice file which relate to the FBI investigation

of the President's assassination. This list is important for two
. main reasons. First, the reports represent a far more detailed ~
knowledge: of..anti-Castro: activities than was: admitted to the Warren
Commission. by the Bureau. On May 5, 1964, Rankin sent a letter to -
Hoover: requesting all documents relative to FPCC, JURE @uxban Revo--
lutionary Junta), DRE (Cuban Student Directorate), Alpha.66 and 30the
of November Movement. for Dallas--Fort Worth in 1963 and related ac~
tivities: in.New Orleans, Miami, Las Vegas and other major U. S.
cities.. At this. point, it has been determined that Hoover responded...
to Rankin! s:> request: by submitting a report: which. simply named of--
ficial. directors. and. key activists of each organization in each
locaiity: and-which-briefly outlined each organization's main ac~
tivities.

yu Second, the Department of Justice files are important be-
yp 8 cause they contain reports on individuals allegedly involved in
ry" azeonapiracy.to-.assassinate the President. Specifically, some of
the names mentioned of particular interest are Gerald Patrick
Hemitnge, HenrysWilliams, Frank Sturgis’, Hargraves; Augustinovich,
BikiiSeymoyr, the-McLaney ‘brothers and Tom.Kane (an alleged alias rf
of. Oswald). (Coup d'Etat in America, by Mike Canfield and A. J. H
Weberman, outlines these individuals’ alleged role in a conspiracy.) ge PL

ae eer

Additionally, the Department of Justice files contain reports
by SMEWEEFERDeBrueys, who is alTéged to have been Oswalidis< EB
contagtzinethesNew:Orleans-areay Finally, these FBI reports refer
to a raid conducted by the FBI on an anti-Castro training camp near
New Orleans on July 31, 1963 during which ten people were arrested
and ammunition was seized. It is very probable that this was the
raid referred to by William Morrow, a former CIA contract employee

ore and counterfeiter for the Cuban underground (cf IX-C-2-a-w (Morrow)).
ea af Morrow'maintains Oswald was involved in this training camp and
e 7 V 00k oo that Ruby was involved in an underworld operation that used it as
Pane a transfer point for narcotics from the Carribean to Texas.

These latter considerations fall into "conspiracy" territory
which is not the direct focus of the investigation. However, the
individuals and events mentioned in these reports have been im-
plicated with Oswald's connections with anti-Castro groups and
lower CIA echelons.

These Department of Justice files should be included in a

MEMORANDUM

TO: Bob Kelley

FROM: Dan Dwyer and Ed Greissing
DATE: August 22, 1975

SUBJ: John F, Kennedy Assassination

This memorandum will outline the major contemporary allegations regarding
the intelligence conmmunities' activities prior to and after the assassination -
of President John F. Kennedy. These major allegations were derived from the
study of the following sources: .the Warren Commission: Report. and its: 26°
volumes of testimony and exhibits, the review of. both FBI. and: CIA documents+
at the. Archives. withheld from the public, the opinions: of. independent. researchers,
and-the information volunteered from individuals: previously..testifying before:.the,
Warren Commission.

To further substantiate those allegations which have some foundation, it
would be necessary to pursue the following courses of action; request both FBI
and CIA documents available to the SSC through the third agency rule, interview
individuals who have been involved in anti-Castro activities, and interview in-
dividuals who have knowledge of the FBI and Secret Service investigation of the
assassination.

This pursuit will elevate the Select Committee's inquiry one phase further
and careful consideration should be given to this additional pursuit.

I.  Allegationg/ Tees Harvey. Oswald: was an: Informer

Background:

On January 22, 1964, J. Lee Rankin, General Counsel for the Warren

Commission, received a call from Wagonner Carr’, Attorney General of Texas.

TOP SES:

DocId:32423508 Page 98 . $7



-2-

Carr advised Rankin that Henry Wade, District Attorney for Dallas, had in-
formed Carr that Lee Harvey Oswald was being paid $200 a month by the FBI

for information, from Septenber 1962 until President Kennedy's assassination.
At an emergency meting of the Warren Conmission held on the afternoon. of the
22nd,. Rankin states, "(the FBI): found. the man (Oswald). There is: nothing more,
en to do. ‘The Commission: supports: their conclusions, and.we. can go home. and. that
é eka is the end of it." Although records of this. meeting were. ordered destroyed,
ca Sy we some. copies. of the transcripts were salvaged, with this. information -retrieved..

On January 27, 1964, the Warren Commission, with additional members present,
again met in Executive Session. At this meeting, the problem posed by. this
allegation was discussed. Allen Dulles stated that, even if Oswald was an
informer, FBI agents would deny it, even under oath. As a result, the Commission
only confirmed the Bureau's contemporaneous investigation of the assassinatim
and did not attempt to investigate the veracity of this allegation.

There is also some: evidence: that indicates Oswald may have been an FBI
informant in New Orleans. Orestes Pena is a Cuban-American who owned the Habana
Bar in New Orleans in the early 1960s and was a member of the Cuban Revolutionary
Council (CRC) and Junta Revolucionaria (OURE), both anti-Castro organizations.

An FBI report of December 5, 1963 states that Lee Harvey Oswald and an z
unidentified Mexican Cuban visited the Habana bar in Septenber 1963. Pena csime ,
he told Carlos=Bringuter, head of the Cuban Student Directory (DKE), about Oswald's
visit to his bar, however, an FBI report by S. A. Warren C.:DeBreuys dated June 19,
1964 records that Pena had no personal knowledge of Oswald in the bar and that
he never informed Carlos Bringuier about Oswald's appearance.

Pena's testimony to the Warren Commission on-July 21, 1964 clearly con
tradicts ‘the points outlined by DeBreuys-in the June 19 report, and that, in

fact, Pena testified he had reported Oswald's appearance and behavior at the bar.

“HW 50955 DocId:32423508 Page 99 i CF SEGR



-3-

Pena's testimony also reveals that he was heavily involved in anti-Castro
activities in New Orleans. He testified he put up the bond money: for Bringuier's
release after he had been taken into custody for fighting with.Oswald in August _
1963, while Oswald was attempting to distribute pro-Castro propagandas

Pena's testimony before the Warren Commission suggests he was an FBI
informer, and that Warren DeBreuys visited him quite often after Pena joined
the anti-Castro organizations, continually asking him for information about
Mexicans, and finally instructed Pena to refrain from becoming involved in
politics and to get information.

Additionally, Pena applied for a passport to Mexico: on-.the: same: day. as,
Oswald: DeBrenys was transferred from New Orleans to Dallas to investigate

_ the assassination and then retumed to New Orleans.

The SSC has recently been forwarded a letter: through:Senator- Church!s
office dated June 30, 1975 written by Orestes: Pena."" Prior: to: his: testimony~
before the Warren: Commission, Pena states: that..he. was. threatened: by... DeBreuys

by the Federal. Government at the Custom's. House in New Orleans,.-and offered
information: regarding the. Federal Agents with whom: Oswald.-associated.~-
Recommendations:

1. Interview Orestes: Pena regarding his anti-Castro activities
in New Orleans, his knowledge of Oswald's relationship with
anti-Castro groups and the FBI in New Orleans, and his ‘re-
lationship with DeBrenys.

2. Interview Warren C.- DeBreuys now located in the Washington area.

To further substantiate the allegation that Oswald was an FBI in-
formant, it is fact that S/A James P.. Hosty's name, address, phone number
and license plate number appeared in Oswald's notebook. (Hosty was the
agent in charge of the Oswald case in Dallas). In his explanation to the
Warren Commission, Hosty testified that he was "trying to learn the where-
abouts of Lee Oswald.....to determine whether or not he was employed in a
sensitive industry."

In his attempt to locate Oswald, Hosty visited a Mrs. Ruth Paine,
on 1 November 1963, believing Marina Oswald was living with her at that time.
Mrs. Paine informed Hosty of Oswald's occupation in the Texas School Book
Depository, which was certainly "a non-sensitive position." Hosty stated
that upon his departure he left his name and phone number with Mrs. Paine,
the rationalization for his name being is Oswald's book.

It should be noted that Hosty again visited Mrs. Paine on Novenber 5,
1963, and was, at all times, acting independently in his attempt to procure
this information, not under the specific direction of the Bureau. The Warren
Commission as well, offered no explanation for the appearance of all the in-
formation on Hosty listed in Oswald's notebook.

James Gouchenaus, an independent researcher, is a potential source of
information regarding Hosty's relationship with Oswald. While living in Seattle,
Gouchenaur had the occasion to meet Carver Gayton, an ex-FBI agent. Gayton
met ‘Hosty..while.serving:with him in Kansas City (Hosty was: transferred to
Kansas: City after the assassination). Gayton related the following information

to Gouchenaur based upon conversations he had with Hosty in Kansas City. Hosty

had been Oswald's-"handler" and the FBI listed Oswald as a "Potential Security

Informant. a Hosty allegedly offered money to Oswald if he reported on a

_Yegular basis. Oswald resisted this approach and Hosty tried to pressure .

Marina so that Oswald would comply. (Oswald, in fact, did write a letter to
the State Department in the fall of 1963, requesting a Russian visa and
protesting the FBI's harassment of his wife).
Recommendations :

1. Interview Hosty.

2. Interview Gouchenaur about his conversation with

Carver Gayton.
"3, Interview Gayton about his knowledge of the relationship

between Hosty and Oswald.

II. Allegation: A theory has been presented that by the end of the Eisenhower
Administration, the lower echelons of the anti-Castro forces established train-
ing camps throughout the Southeast. The groups were trained by ex-Batista
soldiers, as well as CIA contract agents.

Initially, the plan was to take over Cuba through the Bay of Pigs operation.
However, they failed to receive air support, causing this attempt to fail. The
groups began to distrust the Kennedys and the feeling spread through the camps.

Another plan to attack Cuba was halted when the President requested the
Lake Pontchartrain camp be raided.

Thus; we have the allegation that the Kennedy Administration made efforts
in 1963 to dismantle CIA funded anti-Castro training groups;

On August 7, the SSC staff interviewed Robert D. Morrow who maintains

he was thder contract with the CIA from 1961-1963 and headed the counterfeiting

operation for the Agency's Cuban underground organization. Morrow was re-
eruited by Mario Kholly who was employed by the CIA as a consultant. Kholly
was responsible for organizing the Cuban underground.

According to Morrow, Kholly tried to inform Attorney General Kennedy
of missile installations as early as 1961. Kholly also tried to inform that
there would be no underground support for Cuban force invading the Bay of Pigs.
Morrow also maintains Kholly's information about the missiles since it would
be a source of humiliation to the Administration. Furthermore, after the
missile crisis, the Administration made efforts to dismantle Kholly's operations.
(Mis alleged effort initiated by the Administration may possibly be related
to testimony delivered to the SSC during assassination hearings that by 1963
the CIA had lost control of the lower echelons of the anti-Castro forces).

Morrow maintains that a CIA funded training camp for anti-Castro forces
on Lake Pontchartrain, Louisiana was operated by. Frank Sturgis, Carlos Bringuier
(Oswald's alleged associate from New Orleans), Clay Shaw, David Ferrie, and Jack
Ruby. (Allegedly, Ruby was shipping narcotics from Lake Pontchartrain to Dallas).
Morrow maintains some of the individuals involved in the Lake Pontchartrain opera-
tion were involved in a conspiracy to assassinate the President.

Morrow maintained the Lake Pontchartrain camp was raided by the FBI, the
Secret Service and local law enforcement officials per order of the President
on August 1, 1963. Allegedly, ammunition was confiscated and 11 people were
arrested. As a result the anti-Castro Cubans sought to retaliate against the
President, thus bringing about his assassination.

Morrow was arrested on counterfeiting charges in Baltimore on October 1,

1963. Morrow, in the process of procuring Kholly's diary, has already acquired

NET

Kholly's secret papers on the organization of the Cuban underground.

TOP $F

HW 50955 DovId:32423508 Page 103


HW 50955 DocId:32423508 Page 104

Recommendations:

1. Interview Morrow in greater detail about the Cuban underground
operations.

2. Procure Kholly's papers, memoranda and diary from Morrow.
Determine if individuals alleged to be involved in a conspiracy
“were under contract with Agency.

3. Examine materials at the Kennedy Library relating to Kholly's
meetings with the Attorney General.

4, Examine materials at the Kennedy Library relating to the
August 1, 1963 raid on the Lake Pontchartrain camp.

5. Examine FBI reports on surveillance of anti-Castro groups
available at the Kennedy Library.

Moore: told: Gouchenaux that: whatever he: had contributed: to-a: cover-up

Recommendations:

2. Interview @lmer Moore about his participation in the

investigation of the President's assassination.
3. Procure Moore's report on the direction of the shots.

4, Interview Mr. Kelley of the Secret Service.

IV. Allegation:: The. CIA withheld substantive: information. from. the-Warrer
Commission.
A. It has recently been determined by the SSC that Oswald was a target
of the CIA mail. cover operation after he had defected to Russia. Hoover sent
a confidential memo to the State Department on June 3, 1960 which raised the
possibility that an imposter may be using the credentials of Lee Harvey Oswald.
Recommendations:

Request the Agency to provide all information regarding data

compiled on Oswald from the mail cover operation. Determine

if the FBI was forwarded copies of Oswald's mail.

B.  ‘The® SSCEHas#determined that. the CIA withheld:information about Castro
assassination plots: from: the Warren. Commission? Richard Helms testified that
he did not think information regarding Castro assassination plots was important
to the Commission's investigation; he assumed Dulles would have initiated the

inquiry since Helms believed Dulles was privy to assassination plots. This

The source "did not know whether Oswald was an agent of the DGI or any other .

might. have: taken: some- type of action against Cuba and the  DGI itself."

It should be noted that David Belin, Assistant Counsel to the Warren
Commission, has stated that information on assassination plots might have in-
fluenced the overall investigation.

document requests in the future. A review of the

B. The Agency and especially the Bureau forwarded thousands
of documents to the Warren Commission. Although the Archives
has provided an inventory of all documents collected by
the Warren Commission from the Bureau and Agency the
ssc is assuming an overwhelming responsibility in account-
ing. for that information provided to the Commission.
Therefore it seems reasonable that the SSC's initial
request, augmented by briefing with the CIA and FBI, focus
on the following:

1.. An inventory from the FBI and the CIA of all documents
forwarded to the Warren Commission.

and:Helm®. (N.B. It is unclear at this point
whether these letters should be requested from the
Archives or from the appropriate intelligence agency
to which they were forwarded.)

This approach does not seem unreasonable; the Bureau
and the Agency undoubtedly have maintained inventories
described above. Additionally, this approach would be
advantageous for the following reasons:

1. It would free the SSC from the immediate task of
accounting for documents forwarded to the Warren
Commission.

2. It would transfer the burden of responsibility for
clarifying what documents were given to the Commission
to the FBI and CIA.

3. It would provide a relatively simple way to determine
what documents were not provided to the Commission.

4, It would preclude, to a certain degree, serious
confrontatianbetween the SSC and the FBI or the CIA
on whether documentation had previously been provided
to the Warren Commission. :

the form of a TWX message which appeared on
November 17, 1963 on the FBI teleprinter in
New Orleans relayed from Dallas via Washing-
ton. William S. Walters, FBI security clerk
in New Orleans, allegedly retained a copy
and gave it to D. A. Garrison.

forms J. Lee Rankin that Lee Harvey Oswald was
employed by the FBI at $200 a month from
September 1962 up to the time of assassina~
tion. Top Secret Executive Session of Warren

states it is a "dirty rumor" and that it
“must be wiped out."

a. FBI agent James Hosty's name, address,

MEMORANDUM

TO 3 File

(
FROM : David Aaron (4)
DATE : May 20, 1975

SUBJECT: Warren Commission and the Intelligence Community ~ April 9, 1975

In discussion with Mr. Crosby from Minneapolis, he made the
following comments:

The Miami Police had a tape recording of November 9, 1963
which was released in 1967 concerning (Oswald and a Cuban?).

Crosby drew attention to a note in the Archives concerning
: a J. A. Miltier, a threat contained in the FBI file, not in the

‘ 26 volumes. The file is CD1347, filed Internal Security: Oswald
in Russia. The Archives and the FBI deny knowledge of the tape
recording. Miltier denied the threat that was to be made on
Kennedy's life on December 1 to the FBI. In the threat, Miltier
apparently made some comment about Brown of the National States
Rights Party being involved in a plot.

Comment: I don't quite know how all this fits together,
or whether it does. But the thrust of Crosby's point was that
Oswald may have been in contact with Cubans in Florida, or some~

one posing as Oswald. He also may have been in contact somehow
with Miltier and Brown.

MEMORANDUM

TO : David Aaron : ~~
FROM : Dan Dwyer and Ed Greissing
DATE : May 29, 1975

SUBJECT: Initial Overview of Warren Commission

The Warren Commission contains a massive amount of information
regarding intelligence operations. Therefore, this initial overview
focuses on three main investigative areas relating to CIA operations
and Department of. State communications: (1) Oswald's Russian ex-
perience; (2) Oswald and the Fair Play for Cuba Committee; and (3)
Oswald's trip to Mexico City.

Reviewing the Commission Exhibits and Hearings necessitated a
careful reading of the Report, with particular attention to the
chronology of events and intelligence operations responses. This
approach afforded an opportunity to develop a working knowledge of
the chronology of events and an understanding of how the Report is
organized, the thrust of the Commission's analysis, and how the Com-
mission utilized Documents and Exhibits.

Focusing on limited areas of investigation proved to be a
workable and efficient research technique. It. seems reasonable
to continue with this technique but to further define specific
areas of investigation. The Mexico City case, for example, in-
vites inspection of declassified Commission Documents not avail-
able in the Commission Volumes but which could easily be requested
(cf. references to these sources in Mexico City case).

Meetings were held in residences of various members.
Different individuals at both of the meetings he
attended. No regularly scheduled meeting.

Mail card stamped June 11, 1963. Box No. 30061.
Others entitled to receive mail - A. J. Hidell and
Marina Oswald. This box was closed September 26, 1963.
Forward to 2515.W Fifth Street, Irving, Texas.

Informant No. T-2 on June 26, 1963 stated that Lee H.
Oswald, P. 0. Box 30061, New Orleans, La., wrote a let~
ter on June. 10, 1963 to "The Workér" in New York. Oswald
claimed to be a long time subscriber to the magazine

and stated he was forming a FPCC in New Orleans and re-
quested some literature.

Stated on August 7, 1963 received a note through the

mail from Hidell asking him to distribute Fair Play
literature. Hidell knew he wasn't working and had the
time. He denied being paid for this as it was a patriotic
duty. Around 1:00 p.m. on August 9, 1963, he went down
on Canal Street by himself and started distributing com-
mittee literature. Made and placed a placard around his
neck and on the bottom in black print the words "Viva
Fidel." o

As well as leaflets and applications,he had a thirty-nine
page pamphlet entitled "The Crime Against Cuba" by
Corliss Lamont. Gave a copy. of each to the agent at the
interview. Around 4:00 p.m., three Cubans approached
him and he gave each one of the leaflets. They became
angry and destroyed the throwaways and began to argue;
caused a distuubance and they were arrested.

Informant No. T-6 stated he observed on August 9, 1963
an unknown individual handing out leaflets with "Hands
off Cuba, viva Castro."


II, Fair Play for Cuba Committee

CE 826 (p. 5) Lt. Martello advised that on August 9, 1963, Lee
H. Oswald was arrested for disturbing the peace;
and desired to see an FBI agent.

CE 826 (p. 6) Oswald was interviewed by S. A. Quigley - August 15, 1963.
Stated four months ago he met his wife, married her in
Fort Worth, and moved to New Orleans. After coming to
New Orleans, he began reading literature distributed by
the FPCC, and it was his understanding from this that
the main goal and theme of the committee is to prevent
the U. S. from invading Cuba or interfering in the
political affairs of that country. Doesn't consider
FPCC to be communist.

CE 826 (p. 11) On August 21, 1963, Lee H. Oswald appeared on Radio Station
WDSU's "Conversation Carte Blanche" with Edward S.
Butler, Staff Director of the Information Council of
the Americas. This organization specializes in the
distribution of -anti-communist education material to
Latin American countries. Oswald stated that the FPCC
is not communist-controlled and that he, Oswald, is a
Marxist.

On August 30, 1963, Bill Stuckey had a conversation with
Oswald after the broadcast at which time Oswald said he
had met his wife in Russia and married her there.

CE 826 (p. 12) Oswald stated Russians had gone soft on communism
and that Cuba is the only real revolutionary country
in the world today.

Informant No. T-7, familiar with Cuban activities in
New Orleans, on September 9, 1963 said Oswald was un-
known to him.

Frank Bartes, a delegate to the Cuban Revolutionary
Council in New Orleans on September ‘0., 1963 said
Oswald was unknown to him.

Informant No. T-8, acquainted with some phases of the

Communist Party activity in New Orleans, advised on
October 1, 1963 that Oswald was unknown to him.

Special Agent Hosty gave in his testimony that they
didn't have any information concerning the FPCC in
Dallas or Oswald's distribution of leaflets on April 21,
1963 until early June, and no action was taken.

Mrs. Oswald said the name A. J. Hidell was signed by her
when forced by her husband.

According to his wife, Lee H. Oswald was the lone
member of the FPCC in New Orleans. He had himself
arrested so he would become known believing this would
help when he got to Cuba--took clippings of arrest

to Mexico with him.

No record of Dr. A. J. Hidell.

Testimony of Alwyn Cole on April 30, 1964 concerning
signature of Lee H. Oswald and A. J. Hidell states
they are the same.

QUESTION 16

What action was taken by the:Department of State, when
it received information from the CIA in October 1963 |¢oncerning
the appearance of Oswald at the Soviet and Cuban Embassies in
Mexico City? Did the Department of State at this time under-
take to prepare a look-out card or take any action intended to
result in the cancellation of Oswald's passport? If ,60, please
describe the actions taken. :

ANSWER - A CTA report concerning (Lee Henry)Oswald's

appearance at the Soviet Embassy in Mexico City only

(the report did not contain any information regarding

his appearance at the Cuban Embassy in Mexico City)

was received in the Passport Office on October 16, 1963.

Records show that the passport file on Lee Rarvey Oswald

was obtained and that the CIA report was read by

Mr, Janes F, Richie, an attorney, and by Mr. Carroll H.

Seeley, Jr., a supervisory attorney in the Legal Division,

on October 22, 1963. Since the report indicated no

ground for determining that Oswald vas ineligible for.a

passport, a determination was made that no action by the

Passport Office was required, No action was, therefore,

taken to prepare a lookout card, nor was, any action

taken intended to result in the cancellation of Oswald's

passport.

ATTACHMENT _B .

QUESTION 17 {

We would like a description of the procedures, if any,
within the Department for revoking a passport. already issued
should the Department determine or be informed that there are
grounds for doing s0, and a memorandum on the differences, tf
any, between the grounds for refusing to issue a passport and
‘the grounds for revoking a passport already issued in the kinds
of situations which might reasonably have applied to Lee Harvey
Oswald. . :

ANSWER » The attached reprint from the Federal Register
of January 12, 1962 sets forth the substantive and pro~
cedural regulations governing the denial and revocation
of a passport, The grounds for the revocation of a
passport and the refusal of a passport are identical.

There are no differences between the substantive
or regulatory grounds for refusing to issue a passport,
and the grounds for revoking’a passport. When grounds
are discovered for the revocation of a passport, letter
of tentative withdrawal is prepared, setting forth the
specific regulation under which the action is"taken,
and the basis for the action, The bearer of the passport
is requested to surrender his passport and is: informed
of his right to seek a review of the Department's action,
in accordance with the Department's Passport Regulations.
(See Attached Reprint from the Federal Register.)

There were no grounds consonant with the Passsport

Regulations to take adverse passport action against
Oswald prior to November 22, 1962.

: “Scope
The purpose is to determine whether the intelligence agencies of the Federal
Government reported to the Warren Commission fully and accurately on their
relationship, contact and knowledge concerning Lee Harvey Oswald. It would
not address other alleged questions concerning the Warren Commission Report
and the assassination of President Kennedy.

Approach

The first step will be to examine the early Warren Commission material, the
new information that has come to light, and the charges concerning Oswald's
relationship to the federal intelligence agencies. After this examination,
we will determine whether it's useful to interview additional people or con-
duct a broader investigation.
