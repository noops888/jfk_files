She is a former girlfriend of LOUIS MARTINEZ, having
broken up with him in September, 1958, after going with him
for three years, She has known for some time that MARTINEZ
has been working on behalf of the Cuban Rebel forces to obtain
arms and equipment for them. MARTINEZ, who is an attorney, has

py this individual or.lost in some manner because MARTINEZ
has been held responsible by the Cuban Rebels for its loss,
and they have apparently been pressing him for the money or
the arms.: Informant said that in June, July, or August, 1958,
MARTINEZ was in British Honduras checking on the $30,000 for
the man who had it had disappeared either from New York or
Washington, D. C. Informant said on one occasion MARTINEZ

purchase of ten surplus fighter planes. MARTINEZ had invited
her to meet him in Toronto, which she did. She said she saw
these planes, which were silver in color, at. whe Municipal
Airport in Toronto. MARTINEZ had engaged four Panamanian
pilots to fly the planes from Canada; but although they were
permitted to travel to the United States, the Canadian
Authorities would not allow thei to enter Canada to pilot tne
planes from Toronto. Informant stated that 1t is her under-
standing that the planes are now in New Jersey, possibly. around
LEBLOVICH's home, but she was unable to furnish information as

While in Toronto, two men from Milwaukee were there
with MARTINEZ, One whom she knew as "VIC" had his wife with
him. "VIC" was five feet three inches tall, sixty years of age,
thin build. The other she knew as MERLIN, She gathered from
their conversation that both were American industrialista, and
that possibly the surplus planes had been purchased from "vic."

time, formerly served in the Canadian Air Force, and had an
expensive home now in Milwaukee.

and usually stayed at the Edison Hotel. In May, 1958, she
went to New York -and presumed she would stay at the Edison
Hotel; however, MARTINEZ obtained a room for her at the
Manhatten Hotel. She stated that the reason for this was
that MARTINEZ was meeting with a group of men whom she
assumed to be Cuban Rebels at the Hdison Hotel, and for this

one" was hauling guns’ from New York to Miami in her suit>
cases and was supposed.to make these trips frequently. She
said "BLANCA" and JOSE MORALES. were in Canton-in April or
May, 1958, and.stayed at the Ambassador Motel. She stated
MORALES is also working for the Cuban Rebels cause. MORALES
and MARTINEZ left the motel while she and "BLANCA" stayed at
the motel.

a plane from Canton-Akron, Ohio, Airport if he was flying to
New York,

Spanish Center in Canton, Ohio, when he was in Canton and once
during the past summer when the Spanish Fiesta was held,
MARTINEZ was accompanied by a young boy who made a speech
in an effort to solicit funds for what he termed a Guban
Educational Fund for-students. The collection was not. fruitful
and MARTINEZ later made a comment to her that those in
attendance were not interested in helping their own kind.

: p
J Informant advised that'a man she knew as MIKBADUGAN or
AOUNCAN was also in Toronto with MARTINEZ and his grotp when they
purchased the surplus planes. She stated this man was from
White Plains, New York, Telephone No. WH 8-9430. Informant

so that he could contact her for MARTINEZ if necessary. She

in Brooklyn, New York, for the purchase of B.A.R. rifles for the
Cuban Rebels.

Informant indicated that MARTINEZ had. mentioned that
he intended getting medicinal supplies in New York for
MORALES and was going to pass MORALES off as a medical student.
Informant said she presumed from the ‘conversation that this was
to involve a large shipment of supplies to be destined forthe
Cuban Rebels.

Informant stated that MARTINEZ was promoting the
building of a Pan American Building in Cleveland, Ohio, but
that Cleveland officials were not interested and he later
tried to get such a building erected in Miami. MARTINEZ advisea
such a structure would promote better harmony among the
American countries. The backing for such a building was to come

from insurance companies in~South America or the United States,
MARTINEZ made frequent trips to Caracas, Venezuela, and in
July or August, 1958, he called from Miami and said he was
going to go “across the water" which she took to mean Cuba.

She said MARTINEZ has stated that he met with CASTRO, the head
-of the Cuban Rebens, in the past.

Informant said that although she had no definite
information she would presume that any arms which were trans-
ported to Miami from New York would end up at the Trade Winds
Hotel, Miami, which is where FRANCISCO BARONA ALONSO stays
while he is in Miami. It is informant's opinion that ALONSO
spends most of his time in Florida.

: Informant said MARTINEZ has an associate in
Westchester, New York, by the name of TOATER (Phonetic).

Informant stated MARTINEZ. owes her $340, which she
has loaned him-over a period of time and she has been seeking
repayment of this debt since’ she broke up with MARTINEZ.

She said MARTINEZ called on. September 9, 1958, and
said he was going to up-state New York and then to Miami
and would be in Canton on Monday or Tussday, October 13 or
14, 1958, and he did not want her to tell. anyone where he was
going to be, Informant stated that MARTINEZ was explicit in
telling her that he was going to be in up-state New York and
then Miami, then Canton, and she did-not know why he made such
a point of making this clear to her. At this time MARTINEZ
also asked her to obtain twenty dollars which a friend owed
him and send it by Money Order to him at the Main Office of
Western Union, New York, which she did. He promised to send
informant the $340 he owed her on October 11, 1958, but to
date it has not been received.

Informant said that she had no definite information

that MARTINEZ was responsible for the theft of instant

weapons at the Canton Armory but when she read it in the news-
. paper she immediately thought that he would be the logical

person to dispose of such a quantity of arms and that he

possibly had done so to make up for-the weapons he failed to

get when he lost the $30,000 given him by the Cuban Rebels for

this purpose.

MARTINEZ' company the week end before. in New York, which in-
formant stated was true. When she refused to tell them
anything they slapped her around before letting her.go. When

report it to the police, to which she replied if she had done
so she wokld have had to tell them all she knew about him.

plane because he. flew from Miami to New York cn: the occasion
that he went to Toronto. . While in Toronto they stayed at the

name in registering at any hotel and she has always called him

Wooster several days after his arrival on 10/29/58-at New York.

" MARTINEZ told KRAJCIK that he knew who took the guns from the
Canton Armory and that the. individual had already received the
money for the job. KRAJCIK said on this occasion that the
telegrams that were found in MARTINEZ' possession in New York :
at the time of his arrest by the New York City Police Department
were of a personal nature and had no connection with instant
theft. She was unable to explain the contents of the telegram
signed THOMPSON except that it referred to her encounter with
individuals she believed to be THOMPSON and MARDIGO at Wooster
when she was stopped in her automobile and ‘slapped around"
by these individual for her failure to reveal the whereabouts
of LOUIS MARTINEZ.

recent contact with MARTINEZ and if MARTINEZ did not soon cail
him he was going to “sing like a canary.”

KRAJCIK talked to RUTHFORD. again. on November 10,
1958, and stated that RUTHFORD's demeanor had changed towards ”
MARTINEZ, which lead. her to-believed he had talked to MARTINEZ
and been reassured by MARTINEZ that he had told nothing to the
FBI. The former stated that it was possible that RUTHFORD
and MARTINEZ may suspect that the information furnished to the
FBI.came from her, as she would be the only logical source.

VICTOR CARLUCCI, neither one of whom she could identify. She
further added that, she knows of no associates of MARTINEZ

military service due to the fact that his left side is
paralyzed and has been from birth and stated he has purchased
no new Cadillac. MARTINEZ used informant's car while in.
Canton and Wooster in the past week and had little or no
money in his possession.

In his recent visit MARTINEZ mentioned the possibility

Canada to transport the planes the group mentioned getting in
touch with a "Dock"-from Miami, who would come to New York
if necessary to straighten out the trouble. ‘The 'Dock"
seemed quite important to the group’ and there is a possibility
that he was called while they were in Toronto.

Service Director, made a trip to New York on 10/21/58 to secure
some monetary figures for the new city hall, and no such
trip was needed. He advised he did not know if this had any
connection with MARTINEZ or not,
