The Direccion General de Inteligencia (General Directorate of

Intelligence - DGI) overseas field-station chief has no respon-

sibility for physical or other security of the Cuban Embassy or

Mission, nor

does any member of his staff.

The DGI would not use a regular foreign-service officer in the

field because

he has not been cleared and briefed and is

therefore, considered qualified for intelligence tasks.

foreign-service officer

is briefed, it may be assumed

and that he is thereafter considered a

of the DGI (at least by the DGI).

On returning to Havana per-

manently,

a foreign-service officer briefed for a field

assignment normally would be sent to DGI Headquarters rather

to the Ministry of Foreign Relations.
