2022 RELEASE UNDER THE PRESIDENT JOHN F. KENNEDY ASSASSINATION RECORDS ACT OF 1992

SECRET

NROC-104-98

12 June 1998

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, Information Review Group, OIM

Proposed Declassification of Information on

Anatoliy Golitsyn

1.

(S) Action Reguested: Reguest that the JEK

Assassination Review Board| (ARB) not declassify and release

information officially confirming that MI. John William Stone was

one of Anatoliy Golitsyn's former resettlement identities.

Additionally, request the ARB not release the alien registration

numbers issued to MI. Golitsyn and his family members.

2. (5) Background: Mr. Golitsyn, a 71-year-old former

high-level Soviet KGB officer

who defected in 1961, entered the

United States (U.S.) under

PL-110, and became a naturalized U.s.

citizen in 1976.

The Counterintelligence Center (CIC) handled

Mr. Golitsyn from 1961 until 1991 when the

(NROC) assumed management of the case. In the

years immediately following his defection, Mr. Golitsyn was

allowed to have direct access to high-level U.S. Government (USG)

officials and a substantial amount of classified material both of

this Agency and other western intelligence services.

Since his

defection, this Agency has attemptea to keep Mr. Golitsyn

favorably disposed toward the USG and the Agency to prevent any

possible disclosure of his

role with us and other intelligence

services.

(S) In early May

1998 DO/IMS advised NROC that the ARB

intends to declassify,

release to the public, information

that Mr. Golitsyn initially used the "pseudonym", Mr. John

William

Stone, upon arrival in the U.s. DO/IMS further advised

that Mr. Golitsyn's alien registration number, the previous full

"Stone" names and alien registration numbers of his two

dependents would also be declassified. NROC understands. that the

rationale for the ARB's release of this information is public

availability of the name "John Stone" in Tom Mangold's book, The

Cold Warrior.

(S)

NROC strongly believes that the rationale for

declassifying MI. Golitsyn's use of "John

William Stone," is

inadequate given that:

--The classified information scheduled for declassification

and release to the public contains the resettlement "pseudonym"

of not only Mr. Golitsyn, but also his two family members who

resettled in the U.s. with him.

Those family members' names were

not repeat not exposed in Mangold's book.

--In any case, MI. Mangold erred in identifying the name,

"John Stone," as a

"pseudonym." The name Stone was a

resettlement identity assigned to the Golitsyn family which was

used to establish

their new lives.

In contrast to pseudonyms

(which have no basis in reality and have no backstopping) and

even operational aliases (which may have minimal backstopping and

could be used for a few operations and then discarded),

resettlement identities are living identities. If the

resettlement identity "Stone" was once publicly affiliated with

the Golitsyn family, the personal history of all three Golitsyn

family members (not

just MI. Golitsyn) would be highly vulnerable

to being researched since, as resettlees build their new lives,

they establish public records.

Many of these records are now

readily available and exploitable on the Internet.

--Even if the Golitsyns have changed their resettlement

identities through the years, one important piece of identifying

data has remained constant, 1.e. their alien registration

i dentstying

numbers.

If these numbers are declassified and made publicly

available, then the Golitsyns' other resettlement identities,

including their current names, can be made known. The release of

the Golitsyns' full names, (note that MI. Mangold did not expose

Mr. Golitsyn's full name) or alien registration numbers will

compromise their current resettlement identities and places of

residence held throughout all their resettlement identities.

5. (S) Mr. Golitsyn, like other resettlement cases, places

a unique trust in the Agency: That it will protect his identity,

security and not publicly disclose his unique relationship with

the USG. MI. Golitsyn, as other resettlees, lives life in fear

of retribution from his former government..

official USG

, confirmation of his relationship with the Agency may undermine

his and other's confidence in the Agency's commitment to be

vigilant regarding their security. Mi. Golitsyn is in his senior

years and in poor health.

Should he perceive the release of this

information as a lessening of the Agency's security commitment,

it may exasperate his worsening medical condition.. Should the

use action lead to his compromise, we are obliged to expend funds

to resettle him once again.

In the case of Mr. Golitsyn, this

means resettling two entre housenolas at high cost.

6.

(5) Furthermore,

the recruitment of sources of high

intelligence value has always been this Agency's top priority.

ublic disclosure of this intormation could do irreparable damage

o our ability to attract individuals who admire the u.s. anc

might be disposed to collaboration.

Disclosure of cooperation

with the USG would cause ahy potential source to think twice

before placing his life in the hands of an organization who

cannot protect his information.

For those individuals such as

Mr. Golitsyn, who placed their trust in this country in the past,

entered our resettlement program, and are now U.S. citizens, the

release of information with no real relevance to any national

issue, seriously erodes this Agency's credibility and undermines

our Resettlement. Program.
