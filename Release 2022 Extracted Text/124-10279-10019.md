WHEN WORD WAS RECEIVED THAI THE COPRA WORKERS WERE MARCHING ON

AÇAPULCO TO DEMAND AND END TO THE ILLEGAL LEVY WHICH THEY HAVE

BEEN FORCED TO PAY IO UNION LEADERS AND THE GOVERNOR...

NOTED THAI ALL MAJOR INDUSTRIAL, AND ORGANIZED AGRICULTURAL

AND MINING ENTERPRISES DELIVER ILLEGAL PAYMENIS IO IHE GOVERNOR

WITHOUT EQUIVOCATION, AND THAT IT IS MOST IMPROBABLE THAT THE

COPRA WORKERS WOULD EVER HAVE CONSIDERED PROTESTING THEIR OWN

LEVY HAD THEY NOI BEEN INCITED IO DO SO BY CESAR DEL ANGEL

FUENTES, FEDERAL DEPUTY FROM VERACRUZ.

3.

STATED THAT IT WAS MOST UNLIKELY THAT THE ACAPULCO

KILLINGS WOULD COST ABARCA THE GOVERNORSHIP SINCE THERE IS NOT

ENOUGH "PUBLIC EVIDENCE" OF ABARCA'S INVOLVEMENI.

EX-

PLAINED THAT UNLESS EVIDENCE POSSESSED BY FEDERAL AUTHORITIES

WERE PUBLISHED, PRESIDENT GUSTAVO DIAZ ORDAZ WOULD HAVE

NO

REASON TO ORDER ABARCA OUT OF OFFICE.

STATED THAT

ABARCA WAS FULLY AWARE OF IHE EXIENT OF THE GOVERNMENT'S IN

FORMATION ABOUT HIS INVOLVEMENT AND WAS WISELY PLAYING THE

ROLE OF INNOCENI SCAPEGOAI.

OFFERED THE OPINION THAT

THE GOVERNMENT WOULD PLACE GREAT PRESSURE ON CESAR DEL ANGEL

THAT THE GOVERNOR WAS FORCED TO ELIMINATE HIM WHEN BUSINESSMEN-

PROTESTED THAT THEY WERE BEING FORCED TO PAY GRAFT TO TWO
