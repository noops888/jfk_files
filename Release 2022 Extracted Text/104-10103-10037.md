1 The files of the immediate office of the Chief, OPS/0SG

have been checked for material relevant to the subject of this
memorandum. The check included chronological cd ty communi- Sal

cations of which I was the author while assigned td Madrid, Spain
in the period July 1970 to July 1973. Nothing pertinent was found.

2. I have attempted to recollect any other details which
conceivably could b peri nt and which relate to the period
of my assignment Madr'fa~] The only points which I recall but
on which I have no documentation are these: .

by American residents of neat about the reported presence

in Spain of E. Howard Hunt in 1972. My standard reply was

that I knew only what I had heard rumored. For the record,

at no time did Hunt contact me, and I have never known of his
having tried to contact any Station personnel in Spain during
the period 1970-73. I made no effort personally ascertain |.
whether or not Hunt was in Spain, and I had no effort made by ~~
any. Station member. : sirareecoereaieinsiie

b. A Statjon.officer, possibly Richard Guderkirk] now
assigned to[Gu emala,| was given some information by~an
informant in 1972 coricerning reported activities in Spain

by Robert Vesco. I suggested that the information be given
informally to the Embassy's Economic Section chief, John
Oliver.. That officer was charged with keeping abreast of
developments related to Vesco. The Station did not pursue
that subject, as I recall, because it was not a topic of echt
reportable interest, according to requirements of the period.
