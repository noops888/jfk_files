we will have political stability will be decided by the results of
these elections. Through its election activities during the 30
days, the party in office, the Democtatic Republican Party, has
appeared for a guarantee of a stabilizing force in the future-to
carry out its firm policies, The flood of opposition parties,
including the Civil Rule Party, opened a fierce struggle to block
the guarantee of a majority policy by the party in power under the
slogan "Check government dictatorship." In their general election
campaign they did not confront the [Democratic Republican Party]
policy and they began an attack which offered no counterproposals,
The Central Election Management Committeechas made every prepara-
tion to manage this historic day's election cleanly and fairly.
When voting has been completed at the 7400 polling places through-
out the country it has been decided that the ballot counting will
begin immediately at the 196 vote counting stations. It is felt
that the results of the elections will be fully confirmed on the
afternoon of 27 November, (Seoul Sinmun)

Management Committee on the afternoon of 25 November, the number
of voters in the 26 November National Assembly general elections

was set at 373,701 persons, The nationalppopulation as of today
is 26,278,025, The number of voters represents 50.76 percent of

the population. (Seoul Sinmun)

4. On the morning of 25 November Prosecutor General CHO'NG
CH'ANG UN told a press conference, "It is extremely regrettable
that the disclosures of public officials’ election violations in
such places as Mokp'o, Hamp'yo'ng, P'aju, and P'yo'ngt'alk were
originated by a number of overly loyal officials who disregarded
the real meaning of the Government's pledge that the elections
would be unprecedentedly clean, "He went on to say, "It is a
fact that the P'aju - Hamp'yo'ng case had already taken shape and
the people knew everything; however, because the Mokp'o Police
Superintendent said that he alone had taken part in the Mokp'o
case, evidence on the Police Superintendent is now being collected
so that public action may be taken, This not expected to extend

beyond the Police Superintendent. It is extremely regrettable that
the Ministry of Home Affairs and the Director of the Police Bureau
took the moral responsibility for this matter and resigned. I

hope that these cases williserve as a warning to overly loyal public

servants," (Seoul Sinmun) :

5. KANG KI CH'O'N, the Chairman of the SCNR Legislation and
Justice Sub-Committee saidion the morning of 26 November that steps
