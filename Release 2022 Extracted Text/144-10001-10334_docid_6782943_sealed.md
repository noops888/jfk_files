we will have political stability will be decided by the results of

these elections. Through its election activities during the 30

days, the party in office, the Democtatic Republican Party, has

appeared for a guarantee of a stabilizing force in the future to

carry out its firm policies. The flood of opposition parties,

including the Civil Rule Party, opened a fierce struggle to block

the guarantee of a majority policy by the party in power under the

slogan "Check government dictatorship." In their general election

campaign they did not confront the [Democratic Republican Party]

policy and they began an attack which offered no counterproposals.

The Central Election Management Comitteechas made every prepara-

tion to manage this historic day's election cleanly and fairly.

When voting has been completed at the 7400 polling places through-

out the country it has been decided that the ballot counting will

begin immediately at the 196 vote counting stations. It is felt

that the results of the elections will be fully confirmed on the

afternoon of 27 November. (Seoul Sinmun)

3. According to what was learned from the Central Election

Management Committee on the afternoon of 25 November, the number

of voters in the 26 November National Assembly general elections

has confirmed as 13,344,022. The total number of absentee voters

was set at 373,701 persons. The nationalppopulation as of today

is 26,278,025. The number of voters represents 50.76 percent of

the population. (Seoul Sinmun)

4. On the morning of 25 November Prosecutor General CHO 'NG

CH'ANG UN told a press conference,

"It is extremely regrettable

that the disclosures of public officials' election violations in

such places as Mokp'o, Hamp'yo'ng, P'aju, and P'yo'ngt 'alk were

originated by a number of overly loyal officials who disregarded

the real meaning of the Government's pledge that the elections

would be unprecedentedly clean. "He went on to say, "It is a

fact that the P'aju - Hamp'yong case had already taken shape and

the people knew everything; however, because the Mokp'o Police

Superintendent said that he alone had taken part in the Mokp'o

case, evidence on the Police Superintendent is now being collected

so that public action may be taken. This not expected to extend

beyond the Police Superintendent. It is extremely regrettable that

the Ministry of Home Affairs and the Director of the Police Bureau

took the moral responsibility for this matter and resigned. I

hope that these cases will serve as a warning to overly loyal public

servants." (Seoul Sinmun)

5. KANG KI CH'O'N, the Chairman of the SCNR Legislation and

Justice Sub-Committee said.on the morning of 26 November that steps

would be taken to lift restrictions on 266 persons including former

President SYNGHAM RHEE and former Prime Minister CHANG MYO 'N, who

had been constrained under political law. Chairman KANG said that

the SCNR Home Affairs Committee is now giving final consideration to

a list of persons. He said that in accordance with the instructions

of Chairman PAK these persons would be freed no later than

17 December. (Kyo nghyang Sinmun)

6. On the morning of 25 November Democratic Republican Party

spokesman SO' IN SO'K stated, "prior to election day the opposition

parties have been acting to disclose a plan for election violations

by public officials." The following are examples of this.

a.

With two documents drafted by KIM YO'NG SIK an Andong

City Hall official the Civil Rule Party is scheduled to make two

disclosures of election violations by public officials.

b. He said, "The Civil Rule Patty is planning to make

disclosures by two unidentified officials in addition to the above-

mentioned KIM YO 'NG SIR.!" He maintained that it was evident that

most of the above facts were brought about by bribes and were un

true.
