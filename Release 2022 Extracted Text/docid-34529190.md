MANUEL MARTI, ) Civil case Num. CS-62-6720
Petitioner, ) Concerning:
EX-PARTE. ) Ad Perpetuam Rei Memoriam
RESOLUTION

This case was held before tle undersigned Judge on 31 August 1962, with
the intervention of the Prosecuting Attorney, having proved tothe satis-
faction of the Court the following: that the petitioner was born on 11
August 1910, in Utuado, Puerto Rico, the natural son of Juana Marti; that on
birth certificate 636, page 237, book 44, for the year 1910, in Utuado,the
petitioner appears with the first name Adrian; that this circumstance consti-
tutes an error because the true and authentic first name of the petitioner
is Manuel, which first name he has used since his birth; that the petitioner
has two legitimate sons named Ivan and Manuel, who appear on their respective
birth certificates with the surname Sotomayor, which constitutes an error be-
cause the legal surname of the aforementioned minors is Marti; that the peti-
tioner used the surname Sotomayor erroneously because he believed that he
had been recognized by his father.

In support of the allegations of the application, the petitioner pre-
sented attested and documentary proof to the complete satisfaction of the
Court.

The births of the aforementioned children, Ivan and Manuel, are filed
in San Juan, Puerto Rico, under numbers 213 and 2765 of District 164, file
numbers 12969 and 36046, years 1945 and 1946, respectively.

Considering and analysing the evidence in this case, the Court, by the
present, declares the application made by the petitioner to be_in order and
orders the Bureau of Demographic Registry and Statistics of the Department
of Health of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico to proceed with the correction
of the petitioner's first name in order that it appear on his birth certi-
ficate’with his true first name of Manuel and in order that his two afore-
mentioned minor sons appear in their respective birth certificate with the
paternal surname Marti, and also to correct the name of the father of the
said minors so that it appears as Manuel Marti instead of Adrian Sotomayor;
all this in accordance with what is set forth in Law 119, approved on 26
April 1950.

Given in San Juan, Puerto Rico, today the 12th day of February 1963.
