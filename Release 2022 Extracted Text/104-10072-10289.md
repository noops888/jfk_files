1, INTRODUCTION, In Reference E, JMWAVE forwarded a review
of the nature of its relationship with AMCARBON-2, This review
indicates that the relationship with AMCARBON-2 evolved from that
action which was taken in September 1962 to insure that a security
breach would not occur as a result of an investigation which was
being carried out by the'Identity 1 relative to the fact that the
establishment|of the Identity 2 was being kept from the YOBELT
South Campus as a result of security restrictions which were in some
way related to JMDUSK, While the relationship with AMCARBON-2
stenmed from the remedial action which had been taken in a crisis
situation, the establishment of a working relationship with the
Identity'3 was an.objective which JMWAVE had always hoped to obtain.
As a matter of fact, in Reference A, the recommendation was made
that JMWAVE be given approval to contact the major South Florida
news media in|an attempt to work out a relationship with these news
media which would insure that they did not turn the publicity
spotlight on those KUBARK activities in South Florida which might
come to their/attention, . Thus, when a relationship was established
with AMCARDON;2, it was carefully cultivated in order that JMWAVE
might be able;to use this contact at the Ldentity 3 as a means of
achieving the objective of having a relationship with the Identity 3,
which would simultaneously insure the security of JMWAVE's operations
and give JMWAVE an outlet into the press which could be used for
surfacing certain select propaganda items, In the period October to

| So

yecember 1962,) all of JMWAVE's business with the Identity 3

ras handled via AMCARBON-2, In mid-December 1962, AMCARBON-2
vade the suggestion that he introduce REUTEMAN to AMCARBON-1

n order that there be a backup contact, in the event that
‘MCARBON-2 were out of town or unavailable at such times as
(EUTEMAN might| require assistance from the Identity 3, REUTEMAN
igreed to ANCARBON-2's suggestion, and, as a result, AMCARBON-2
iosted a luncheon on 12 December 1962 at the Miami Club in the
fotel Columbus, Miami, Florida, at which ANCARBON-2 introduced
\MCARBON-1 to REUTEMAN, As a result of this initial meeting op
[2 December 1962,.an operational relationship has developed with
\NCARBON-1, and it is believed that this rolationship contributes
to the fulfillment of the over-all JMWAVE mission, In view of
this, a special activities report is being submitted to cover the
jature of JMWAVE's yelationship with AMCARNON-1 during the

period December 196% to March 1964.

2, FRAME OF REFERENCE FOR JMWAVE'S RELATIONSHIP WITH AMCARBON~1
ICARBON-2 SOS

'

When AMCARBON=2 intioduced ANCARBON-T to RUUTEMAN,

reviewed the ground rules under which he had been cooperating

with REUTEMAN, This: review was conducted Zor AMCARBON-1's
benefit, in order that he might clearly understand the frane of
peferenge which should prevail in his relavionships with REUTEMAN,
In this review, AMCARBON-2 pointed out that it was the policy

of the Identity 3 that it would take no action which would ~
purposely, embarrass KUBARK or its South Florida operations. As

a result, if any embarrassing items relative to KUBARK's operations
fn South’Florida did come to the attention of the Identity 3, this
material would be brought to REUTEMAN's immediate attention.
AMCARBON-2 made it clear to AMCARBON-1 that such items should be
discussed with REUTEMAN in a frank manner, In addition, AMCARBON-2
made the point that, after an item was discussed, AMCARBON-1
Should follow REUTENAN's guidance relative to how any particularly
cnbarrassing item might be handled by the (dentity 3, so that it
yould not expose KUBARK operations and, at-the same time, would
not jeopardize the journalistic reputation of the Identity 3.

In addition, AMCARBON-2 pointed out that, if AMCARBON-1 brought

a potentially embarxassing item to REUTEMAY's attention and
remedial action on the matter was not takea by REUTEMAN withia

a reasonable period of time, then the Identity 3 would feel free
to expose any ineptness on KUBARK's part, AMCARBON-Z pointed

out that in return for this cooperation from the Identity 3,
REUYEMAN had agreed that he would be available for contact by
telephone or periddic personal meetings at which AMCARBON-1

and ANCARBON-2 could discuss broad trends and developments in
Latin American affairs, AMCARBON-2 advised AMCARBON~1 that this
arrangement did not mean that AMCARBON-1 could expect te obtain
any classified infocmation from REUTEMAN, The point was also
are that ANCARBON-L should not press for the obtaining of
wiassified information, but he should be alert to stvering tips
chick REUTEMAN might furnish him on fast-breaking news stories.
AMCARBON-1 indicated that he understood the frame of reference
which had been Outlined by AMCARBON-2, This frame of reference
has prevailed throughout JMWAVE's relationship with AMCARBON- 1
during the period December 1962 to March 1964.

3, AMCARBON-1'S JOURNALISTIC CAREER, ANCARBON~1 originally
started to work for the Tdentity 3 in 1957 on the City Desk,
and subsequently advanced from this assignment to an assignment
nich entailed covering major political developments in Florida,
At a later date, AMCARBON-1 became a feature writer tor the
Tdentity 3. Thon in July or August 1062, AMCARBON-1 was made

promotion for AMCARBON-1, and it veflgcted confidence in him by
the Identity 3 management, AMCARBON-1 is by no means an expert

on Latin Amevica, but he is developing his knowledge on the area
and, at the 1oment, he gives every Indication of wanting to be a
long-term Lavin American specialist, QDELF has been questioned
about AMCARBON-1, and he has indicated that AMCARBON-1 is regarded
in the ‘journalistic trade as an extremely likeable fellow who has
a keen mind but who lacks experience in depth on Latin American
affairs, It is QDELF's opinion that given an appropriate lapse

of time, AMCARBON-1 will develop into one of the leading Latin
American specialists in U.S, journalistic circles, AMCARBON-1

has a working command of Spanish, and he is constantly attempting
to improve his language fluency, It is REUTEMAN's opinion that
ANCARBON-1 has developed rapidly as a Latin American specialist,
and he will continue to grow in this field, Thus, he is a contact
who should be developed and harnessed for exploitation, bearing

in mind that he does have long-term potential,

4, AMCARBON-1'S CONTACTS AND SOURCES, In keeping with the
traditional pattern of source protection which is common to
hewspapermen, intelligence officers and law enforcement officers,
ANCARBON-1 attempts to guard the true identity of all of his
aeeeteg. On the other hand, when pressed, ANCARBON-1 has identified
Source df nis sources to REUTEMAN, in order’ that meaningful evaluations
sored be made of that information which AMCARBON-1 had passed to
KUBARK, As a result of these occasional witting identifications
of his ‘sources, and, as & result of general conversations with
QNCARBONG]. REUTEMAN has learned that AMCARBON-1's sources include
the following person:

5. OPERATIONAL SUPPORT, On occasion, AMCARBON-1 is used

to carry out certain operational support tasks» In such instances
ANCARBON-1 makes his inquiries or carries out the required action
within the context of his normal journalistic activities, The

use of AMCARBON-1 for operational support tasks enables JMWAVE to
harness the investigative facilities of tho Identity 3, Several >
examples of how ‘AMCARBON-1 has been used in eee at?

tasks are outlined below: yo"

| vw

_ | a, Andrew ORDONO Camps. 1p March 1963, Andrew! *ORDONO
camps, pPOB 30 September 1014, Gibara, Cubs, ‘A 13 837 617, arrived
same idmi and was given routine CAC processines The details of this
in oeossing are contained in MIAM-OO85, dated 2 March 1963, After
being released by CAC, ORDONO was interviewed by the Identity 3, and
a sensational story was developed. In view of this story, JMWAVE
tried to locate ORDONO for debriefing. This effort was not productivd
thus AMCARBON-1 was asked to locate ORTONO. AMCARBON-1 did locate
onpoxo CAR MOuaton, Texas, See WAVE-6307, dated 25 March 1963, for
jetails.

b. Discrediting Carlos BANDIN of the MRR Splinter Group.
In UFGH-2555, dated IJ September 963, Headquarters suggested that
SMWAVE Imight be able to discredit Carios BANDIN Cruz (201-309611)

of the MRR splinter group 48 ear gcult of BANDIN's overinflated clains
telative to his faction invading Cuba, Headquarters' interest in
discrediting BANDIN was also stimulated by the fact that BANDIN'S
Srresponsible publicity stunts were causing problems for AMBIDDY-1,
ee in this matter, REUTEMAN had

a luncheon session with SNCARBON-1 on 24 September 1963, at which
ANCARBON-1 was advised that the BANDIN faction of the MRR was less
than agcurate in its claims relative to its activities in Cuba.

fan jew of this, REUTEMAN suggested that the Identity 3 might want
to soft peddle any future way eenmuniques which the BANDIN faction
might felease, AMCARBON-1 tated that, in view of REUTENAN's
comments, the-Identity 3 would not only soft peddle, but would
{gnore| the BANDIN faction in ‘the future, Once BANDIN was discredited
with ANCARBON-1, the word was soon leaked by AMCARBON-1 to other”
hewspapermen that BANDIN was nota reliable source. As a result

of this action, the BANDIN group has received minimal media coverage
in South Florida since September 1963.

d, OPERATIONAL INTELLIGENCE. | Te the period February 1963
to Fenyuary 1964, BNCARBON-I hast urnished JNWAVE with operational
intelligence as dutlined below:

| a, In WAVE 4836, dated 21 February 1963, ANCARBON-1
reported that AMBEND-1 was pack in Miami and was the object of
a great deal of press jnterest in view of AMBEND-1/s release from
& Gavana prison, AMCARBON-1 215° Yndicated that ANBEND-1 would
probably pee Knowledgeable source on the current activities of the
PR iniCGuba, This operational {ntelligence was most helpful +)
terms| of keeping JMWAVE informed on AMBEND-1's movements. Subsequent
developments revealed that QHCARBON-1 could not, contact AMBEND-1,
sepa Cicisheer ch aaetal bag ‘the United States did not cause the
publicity stir that was initially anticipated,

: pb. In WAVE 6176, dated 22 March 1963, AMCARBON-1
yeported that the Identity 3 was ‘attempting to research a full
feature article on the Bay of Pigs invasion. The intent of this
article was to furnish @ Fecapitulation of the entire tactical
situation. In this connection, ANCARBON-1 pointed out that he was

.thinking about exposing the role of Miami attorney Alex 2. BcaRison
residing 145 Curtiss Parkway, Miami Springs, Florida, in the i
Bay of Pigs operation, AMCARBON-1 stated that, if CARLSON were
of any current interest to REUTEMAN, then the Identity 3 would
soft peddle the CARLSON angle, REUTEMAN advised AMCARBON-1 that
he had no interest in CARLSON but knew of him and was of the
opinion|that CARLSON was a sound and honest attorney, The receipt
of this |operational intelligence enabled JMWAVE to brief CARLSON
on the Identity 3's over-all interest in the role that. CARLSON had
played in the Bay of Pigs invasion, This briefing, in turn,
enabled |CARLSON to more adequately prepare himself for a meeting
with AMGARBON-1, While AMCARBON-1 did attempt to pursue this
Bay of Pigs story, he never did put anything into print as the story
was overtaken by other developments before AMCARBON-1 could finish
hig research, .

:

3

7" 5, Im WAVESgp4, dated 9 July 1963, AMCARBON-1 advised
SMWAVE that Mr, Trevor WARMBRISTER, an associate editor for the
Saturday Evening Post, was in Miami during July 1963 attempting
to research a story regarding the possibility that strategic
missileg were hidden in Cuban caves, This information enabled
JMWAVE to keep Headquarters informed on sensational-type articles
which might be appearing relative to Soviet missiles in Cuba,

: d., In WAVE 4701, dated 20 September 1963, AMCARBON-1
gave JMWAVE his .resume of the discussions which he had with
AMBIDDY=1 at the Miami Playboy Club on 19 September 1963, This
information was useful in obtaining an insight into what AMBIDDY-1
was telling the press.

|e, In WAVE 5661, dated 10 October 1963, AMCARBON-1
reported on a discussion that he had had on 10 October 1963 with
AMBIDDY+1's public relations man, This operational intelligence
was useful in terms of keeping KUBARK advised as to what AMBIDDY-1's
representatives-were telling the outside world about their
operatiqnal activities, 5

£, In WAVE 6910, dated 31 October. 1963, AMCARBON-1

informed JMWAVE about the flood of telephone calls which were
being received at the Identity 3 relative to so-called KUBARK
vessels which were located in South Florida waters, This
information .alerted JMWAVE to the fact that press scrutiny was
going to be directed toward the Identity 5, Armed with this warn-
ing, JMWAVE was able to take action which minimized the publicity
repercussions from a renewed press interest in the Identity 5,

g. In WAVE7671, dated 16 November 1963, AMCARBON-1
reported to JNWAVE the fact that he had received a letter from
Peru which contained an interesting operational lead to one
Carlos MONTALVANO in Puno, Peru. This lead was examined by JMWAVE,
Headquarters and the Lima Station, This examination revealed
that the letter was written by a crackpot; thus, there was no |
real operatioaal potential in this lead, This incident did underse
the fact that AMCARBON-1 is willing to bring potentially significan
operational leads to JMWAVE's attention,

he In WAVE 1614, dated 6 February 1964, AMCARBON-1
advised JMWAVE that he had received numerous telephone calls
indicating that Armando Andres GUIROLA Forte, who had aefected
from a Cuban fishing vessel might be an individual who had previously
iegn seen in Miami during November or December 1963, At the same
time, AMCARBON-1 pointed out that he was suspicious and thought
that these telephone calls indicated that GUIROLA was rot a bona
fiae defector, but was either a GOC agent or a KUBARK plant, ‘who
ae peing used as a means of creating an incident which would
embarrass the GOC, as a result of their fishing boats penetrating

United States territorial waters, REUTEMAN advised AMCARBON-1
that KUBAR had played no role in mounting a provocation operation
against the GOC, At the same time, REUTEMAN pointed out that
it was highly unlikely that GUIROLA was a GOC agent, As a result
of this conversation, arrangements were made for JMWAVE to check
out certain aspects of the GUIROLA story, At the same time,
AMCARBON-1 was prevailed upon not to write a story which might
lead the public to speculate on waether GUIROLA was an agent or a
plant in @ propaganda play designed to embarrass the GOC,

(7. PROPAGANDA OUTLET, AMCARBON-1 has been used successfully
during the period covered by this report, as a propaganda outlet
through which items of interest to KUBARK could be surfaced in
the free world press, Examples of how AMCARBON-) has been harnessed
in this field are outlined below:

| a, AMNCRAB-1, The AMCRAB-1 defection story originally
surfaced ir the Wiami area on 13 October 1963 via the Diario de
las Americas, which played up an API release from Montevideo,

‘The API Montevideo story highlighted AMCRAB-1's information
relative tc GOC activities in Uruguay, The story in the Diario

de las Americas had an extremely iimited impact on Spanish readers
in the Miami area, As a result, i:t was decided to do a series

of feature stories on AMCRAB-1, pointing up the fact that AMCRAB-1
was typical of the veterans of the Granma expedition, who felt

they had been betrayed by CASTRO znd had been relegated to positions
of obscurity once the revolution had put CASTRO in power, AMCARBON-
was briefed in detail on the AMCRAB-1 story, and he was given an
opportunity to debrief AMCRAB-1 urder controlled conditions in a
JMWAVE safehouse, After completirg his debriefing, AMCARBON-1
wrote a series of feature articles on ANCRAB-1, The first article
in the series received front page headline play, The series of
articles on AMCRAB-1 were well written, and they- provided an
excellent peg for JMWAVE to mount-a replay operation via other
propaganda assets, AMCARBON-1's story on AMCRAB-1 was picked tp

by UPI, API and others, and it was played throughout Latin America
The details of this surfacing’ can be found in WAVE 5&26, dated

14 October 1963; WAVE 6092, dated 19 October 1963; and, WAVE 6174,
dated 21 October 1963,

b. Charles GRIFFIN Shrimp Boat Story, On 26 February 1964
SJMWAVE learaed that when Mr, Charles GRIFFIN’s sons went to Cuba
to reclaim the hijacked shrimp boat, JOHNNY NEB, they found that
select items were missing from the boat when it was turned over
to them, It was believed that this information would make a good
human interest story which JMWAVE assets could use to counter GOC
propaganda claims that United States officials had stolen items
from the Cuyan fishing boats which had violated United States
territorial waters, In view of this opinion, a steering tip was
given to ANCARBON-1 to have the Identity 3 representative in
Key West interview Mr, GRIFFIN, This interview was carried out,
and an article outlining the points which were of interest to
JMWAVE was published in the 27 February 1964 edition of the
Identity 3,

c. LAYC Story, The March 1964 LAYC meeting in Santiago,
Chile, was not recéiving appropriate coverage in the South Florida
newspapers; as a result, REUTENAN contacted AMCARBON-1 on 5 March
1964 and sugested that’ the LAYC mzeting was a story which the
Identity 3 should pursue, AMCARBON-1 was grateful for this steering
tip, and he assigned the task of preparing the story on the LAYC
to éne of the members of his staff, A story on the LAYC was |
subsequently published in the 6 Macch 1964 edition of the Identity de

8.| POSITIVE INTELLIGENCE. Attempts have been made to
obtain apron nung Dae tea oREO eee from AMCARBON-1 during
the period covered by this report, This attempt has been generally
unsuccessful, in that AMCARBON-1 does not have a great number of
contacts in Latin America who would give him access to worthwhile
intelligence appreciably in advance of the information appearing
in the gvert press, As a result, AMCARBON-1 is usually not aware of |in
inside developments in any Latin American country; consequently,
he is not a worthwhile source of positive intelligence, As a
matter of fact, AMCARBON-1 is less valuable as a source of positive
intelligence than most journalists, This is attributable solely
to his lack of long-standing contacts in the Latin American politica
scene, |It is believed that AMCARBON-1 will ultimately overcome
this shortcoming; thus, we will continue to attempt to harness him for
the collection of positive intelligence.

9, COMMENT, In the period covered by this report, ANCARBON-1
has beeh Found to be a straight-forward individual who is honest
cooperative and who understands the need for security, Our
relationship also indicates that AMCARBON-1 is an accurate reporter
of that|information which he passes to KUBARK, In view of this,
JMWAVE plans to continue to harness AMCARBON-1 in the same manner
that he'has been used in the past, It is believed that our rela-
tionship with AMCARBON-1 enhances our ability to conduct our
operational mission in a secure manner, In addition, ‘this relation-
ship tends to minimize the possibility that JMWAVE might have diffi-
culties with the media outlets in the South Florida area, As a
result of our continuing relationship with AMCARBON-1, a special
activities report will be forwarded at appropriate intervals,

|

10, It is requested that a 201 number be ussigned AMCARBON-1
and that JMVAVE be advised of the number,
