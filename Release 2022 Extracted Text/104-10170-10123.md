2022 RELEASE UNDER THE PRESIDENT JOHN F. KENNEDY ASSASSINATION RECORDS ACT OF 1992

COUNTRY: Cuba

IYIM UO1(5) 383104618-71

SUBJECT:

Counter-Revolutionary Organization, 19 February 1971

Alpha 66, and 1ts Activities

" I.

A rellable source of the Miami Field Office furnished the following

information.

Alpha 66 was founded in Late 1962 or eariy 10i3 by Eloy Gutierrez

Menoyo, Armando Fleites, Antonio Veciana, Andres Jasario Sargent, Dr. Diego

Medina and others, at a cover for the Second Natimal front of Escambray.

3. In 1966 it separated from the Second Nativnal Front of Escambray.

On 6 Jan 71 Andres Nazario Sargent became the "jugrice Leader" of Alpha 66.

They are alleged to have 300 active members and 3,140 inactive members. Up

to 6 Jan 71 there vere no ex-members of Brigade aló registered as active or

Inactive members.

There are frofessionals, former dealthy men ind farmers who

are active members.

Raids against Cuba commenced in 1963, the Last raid was in October

1970 in Banes, Oriente Province, where 15 men allegerily Landed.

[C/s Comment:

Sources, arriving on the airlilt, have reported that of these 15 men five

were killed and two taken prisoners at Baire.

Trel also said rumors were

that the remaining cight were cither killed or trien prisoners.] There have

ocen three landings,

one in 1967 and two in 1970, also 14 raids from 1963 to

October 1970. Tiey have also attacked une ship on the high seas and two ships

while in Cuban harbors. During the attack ou the high seas 1l fishermen wore

taken. prisoners and brought to the US.

They nem luter returned to Cubi.

These lindings; raids and attacks on ships have teen allegedly corducted to

awaken the dormant status of counter-revolutioran activities and to create

a state of revolutionary conscience within the Cilins who still remain in Cuba.

5.

Sme people consider Alpha 66 to be a cositer-revolulionazy organization

with a leftist tendency.

There are sumors that it nas a clandestine group, with-

in Cuba, who gathers intelligence infurinition for it. However, to my knowledge

these rumors have not been confirmed.

6. In mid-1970 the Miani FBI raided the Alpia dó office, and took part of

their files with them.

Apparently Alpha 6ú had diplicates hiduen because today

duplicates of the files which the fBI renoved are in their filing cabinets.

7. On occasions some of their leaders have teen arrested, or interrogated,

but have been

set free soon thereafter.

At the present time alpha 66 dues not

have the full cooperation nor licking of the majurig of the Cuban exiles. In

fact it is very licited.

•To my knowledge there is no prominent exile connected

with Alpha 66; the reason being that they are urder the impression the organ-

ization, da a whole, has leftist tendencies.

1s fax as I know there is no established siltionship betreen Alpha có

and the "Truth about Cuba Cormittee"

, nor do I hare aüy knowledge that it is

organizing any type of "Cuban Mafia".
