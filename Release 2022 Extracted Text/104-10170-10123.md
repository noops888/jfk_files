{2022 RELEASE UNDER THE PRESIDENT JOHN F. KENNEDY ASSASSINATION RECORDS ACT OF 1992 |

COUNTRY: Cuba : NUM OAA(S) 322/04618-71

SUBJECT: Counter-Revolutionary Organization, 19 February 1971
Alpha 66, and its Activities
“lL. A reliable source of the Miami Field Office furnished the following
information.

2, Alpha 66 was founded in late 1962 or eariy 1863 by Eloy Gutterrez

Menoyo, Arwando Fleites, Antonio Vectana, Andres Nazario Sargent, De. Diego

- Medina and others, asa cover for the. Second Nativail Front of Escambray.

3. In 1966 it separated from the Second Nativasl Front of Escambray.”
On 6 Jan 71 Andres Nazario Sargent. became the "Suprece Leader" of Alpha 66.
They are alleged to have 300 active members and 35 (WO inactive members, Up
to 6 Jan 71 there were no ex-members of Brigade sh08 registered as active or
inactive meabers, There are professionals, former wealthy wen and farmers who
are active meabers.

4. Raids against Cuba commenced in 1963, the last raid was in October
1970 in Banes, Oriente Province, where 15 men allegedly landed. [C/S Comment:
Sources, arriving on the airlift, have reported that of these 1S won five
were killed and two taken prisoners at Baire. They also said rumors.were
that the remaining eight were cither killed or. taken prisoners.) There have
been three landings, one in 1967 and two in 1970, also 14 raids from 1963 to
October 1970. They have also attacked one ship oa the high seas and two ships
while in Cuban harbors. During the attack on the high seas 1 fishermen were
taken prisoners and brought to the US. They were later returned to Cuba.
These lindings, raids and attacks on ships have been allegedly conducted to
awaken the dormant status of. counter-revolutionary activities and to create
a state of revolutionary conscience within the Cedaas who still renain in Cubs.

S. Some people consider Alpha 66 to be 4 comter-revolutionary organization
with a leftist tendency. There are rumors that it has a clandestine group, with-
in Cuba, who gathers intelligence information for it. However, to my knowledge
these rumors have not been confirmed.

6. In mid-L970 the Miami FDI raided the Alpta 06 office, and took part of
their Elles with them. Apparently Alpha 66 had dxplicates hidden because today
duplicates of the files which the FBI removed are in tneir filing cabinets.

7. On occasions some of their leaders have teen arrested, or interrogated,
but have been set free soon thereafter, At the present time Alpha 66 dues not
have the full cooperation nor backing of the majority of the Cuban exiles. In
fact it is very ligited. To my knowledge there is no prominent exile connected
with Alpha 66; the reason being that they are under the inpresston the organ-
ization, aa a whole, ‘has leftist tendencies.

8. As far as I know there is no established svtationship between Alpha 66
and the "Truth sbout Cuba Committee", nor do I have any knowledge that it is
organizing any type of "Cuban Mafia". :
