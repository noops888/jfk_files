never got to know Ferrie very well. He went to one social
party that was given at either Ferrie's house or Col, Jim
Salmon (James Salmon was killed in a plane accident 10-15-78).
The party was all guys and when they started drinking he left.
He was about 16 and his father didin't allow him to drink,
Salmon and some others were seniors and Atzenhoffer didn't
get to know them, He remembers that Ferrie flew at blue
tinson that he kept at Mo&sant Airport, (Now New Orleans
isabel and they don't allow private planes there any
more).

Ferrie never indicated that he was homosexual in any way.
The only thing that he can remember that was not of CAPC was
Ferrie wanting the kids to participate in some kind of ex-
periment for Tulane University. They didn't do it.

Atzenhoffer was shown the photo book and related the
‘following:

#5. Clay Shaw knew from newspapers.
#27, Looked familiar but name didn't mean anything.

friends. He remembers that Seeling's father owned a
large dairy farm in Kenner, La. Last saw him a’ few years
ago. Seeling is in the Air Force and is stationed in
Corpus Christi, Texas, Garrion's men showed him a mug
shot of Seeling and he was suprised to learn that he
had been arrested.

arrested on August 30, 1961 and booked with Vagrancy,
