contaminated diving suit* (Colby, 5/21, pp. 38-39).

The Inspector General's Report dates this
operation in January 1963, when Fitzgerald replaced Harvey as
Chief of Task Force W, although it is unclear whether Harvey or
Fitzgerald conceived of the plan (I.G., p. 75). It is likely
that the activity took place earlier, since Donovan had completed
his negotiations by the middle of January 1963. Helms characterized
the plan as “eockeyed" (Helms, 6/13, p. 135).

TSD bought a diving suit, dusted the inside
with a fungus that would produce a chronic skin disease (Madura
foot), and contaminated the breathing apparatus with a tubercule
bacillus (I.G., p. 75). The Inspector General's Report states

‘o that the plan was abandoned because Donovan gave Castro a different

diving suit on his own initiative (I.G., p. 75). Helms testified

that the diving suit never left the laboratory (Helms, 6/13, Pp. an

D. CONGO
i. Introduction

The Committee has received solid evidence of a CIA
plot to assassinate Patrice Lumumba. ‘The plot proceeded to
the point where lethal substances and instruments specifically
intended for use in an assassination were placed in the hands
of the CIA kates of |scation in Leopoidville by an Agency
selentist.

Although these instruments of assassination were never
used, a number of questions are presented by the Lumumba case
which reflect general issues that run throughout the Committee’s
assassination inquiry. First, did CIA officers and operatives

C in the Congo take steps to attempt the assassination of Lumumba?

Second, how high in the United States government was the
source of authorization for the CIA assassination plot? Finally,
was the CIA connected in any way to the events that actually led
to the death of Lumumba while in Congolese custody?

A thread of historical background is necessary to weave these
broad questions together with the documents and testimony re-

ceived by the Committee.

Stanleyville, and he was imprisoned. The central government of
the Congo transferred Lumumba on January 17, 1961 to the custody
of authorities in the province of Katanga, which was asserting its
own independence at that time. Several weeks later, the Katangese
authorities announced Lumumba's death,

There are various accounts of the circumstances and timing
of Lumumba's death. The United Nations investigation of the inci-
dent concluded that Lumumba was killed on January 17.*

2. Dulles Cables Leopoldville That Removal" of Lumumba
isan Urgent Objective tn High Quarters

Shortly after the Congolese declaration of independence
from Belgium on June 30, 1960, the-cIa assigned a new Chieg of|
Station to the Congo. The (thief of| Station said that the briefings
he received at CIA headquarters in preparation for his departure
contained no discussion of the possibility of assassinating Patrice
Lumumba (Hedgman, 8/21/75, Pp. 8). On his brief return to head-
quarters in connection with Lumumba's visit to Washington in late
July, the fries of |Station again heard no discussion of assassi-
nating Lumumba (iedgman, 8/21/75, p. 9).

During August, great concern about Lumumba's political
strength in the Congo was growing among the foreign policy-makers

of the Eisenhower Administration.** This concern was nurtured

anti-Lumumba attitude In the United States government as shown by

co by intelligence reports such as that cabled to CIA headquarters
by the new hie of \Station:

THERE MAY BE LITTLE TIME LEFT IN WHICH TAKE ACTION

Leopoldville to Director, 8/18/60.)

This cable also stated the (chier of| Station's operational "OBJECTIVE
{OF] REPLACING LUMUMBA WITH PRO WESTERN GROUP" (CIA Cable, 8/18/60).
Bronson Tweedy, then Chief of the Africa Division of CIA's clan-
destine services, replied the same ‘day that he was seeking State
Department approval for the proposed operation based upon "OUR
BELIEF LUMUMBA MUST BE REMOVED IF POSSIBLE” (CTA Cable (out 39741),
Tweedy to Leopoldville, 8/18/60). on August 19, Richard Bissell,
Director of CIA's covert operations branch, signed a follow-up

cable to Leopoldville: "YOU ARE AUTHORIZED PROCEED WITH OPERATION"
{CIA Cable OUT 59959, Director to Leopoldville, 8/19/60).

Several days later, the bniee of| Station reported that a plan
to assassinate Lumumba had been proposed to President Kasavubu by
Congolese leaders;

HW 50955

The next day, Allen Dulles personally signed a cable* to

the Leopoldville (ier of| Station which stressed the urgency of

"removing" Lumumba:

IN HIGH QUARTERS** HERE IT IS THE CLEAR-
CUT CONCLUSION THAT IF LLL [LUMUMBA] cCoN-
TINUES TO HOLD HIGH OFFICE, THE INEVITABLE
RESULT WILL AT BEST BE CHAOS AND AT WORST
PAVE THE WAY TO COMMUNIST TAKEOVER OF THE
CONGO WITH DISASTROUS CONSEQUENCES FOR THE
PRESTIGE OF THE UN AND FOR THE INTERESTS OF
THE FREE WORLD GENERALLY. CONSEQUENTLY
WE CONCLUDE THAT HIS REMOVAL MUST BE AN
URGENT AND PRIME OBJECTIVE THAT UNDER EXISTING
CONDITIONS THIS SHOULD BE A HIGH, PRIORITY OF
OUR COVERT ACTION. (CIA Cable, (QUT 62966),
Director to Leopoldville, 8/26/60.)

Dulles cabled that the (chiet of| Station was to be given "WIDER
AUTHORITY" -- along the lines of the previously authorized opera-
tion to replace Lumumba with a pro-Western group -- “INCLUDING
EVEN MORE AGGRESSIVE ACTION IF IT CAN REMAIN COVERT" (CIA Cable,
8/26/60). "WE REALIZE THAT TARGETS OF OPPORTUNITY MAY PRESENT
THEMSELVES TO YOU," the cable continued (CIA Cable, 8/26/60).

* Cables issued under the personal signature of the DCI are
a relative rarity in CIA communitations and call attention to the
importance and sensitivity of the matter discussed.

** As discussed in Section 5(c), infra, Richard Bisell testified
that Allen Dulles would have used the phrase “higher quarters" to
refer to the President (Bissell, 9/10/75, p. 48)..

Dockd:32202487 Page 11


‘ter

Dulles also authorized the expenditure of up to $100,000 "TO
CARRY OUT ANY CRASH PROGRAMS ON WHICH YOU DO NOT HAVE THE OPPOR-
TUNITY TO CONSULT HQS"' (CIA Cable, 8/26/60). He assured the
[chiet of\ Station that the message had been "SEEN AND APPROVED AT
COMPETENT LEVEL" in the State Deparrment (CIA Cable, 8/26/60).
But the Director of Central Intelligence made a special point
of assuring the (chief of\ Stacion that he was authorized to act
unilaterally in a case where the United States Ambassador to the
Congo would prefer to remain uninformed:

TO THE EXTENT THAT AMBASSADOR MAY DESIRE

TO BE CONSULTED, YOU SHOULD SEEK. HIS CON~-

CURRENCE. IF IN ANY PARTICULAR CASE, HE

DOES NOT WISH TO BE CONSULTED YOU CAN ACT

ON YOUR OWN AUTHORITY WHERE TIME DOES NOT

PERMIT REFERRAL HERE (CIA Cable, 8/26/60).
This mandate raises a question as to whether the DCI was contem-
plating a particular form of action against Lumumba which the
Ambassador would want to be in a position to “plausibly deny"
United States involvement. DDP Richard Bissell testified that he
was "almost certain" that he was informed about the Dulles cable
shortly after its transmission and that it was his “belief" that
the cable was a circumlocutious means of indicating that the
President wanted Lumumba to be killed (Bissell, 9/10/75, pp. 33,
64-65) .*

* See Section 5(c), infra, for additional testimony by Bissell
on the question of authorization for the assassination effort
against Lumumba.

€ to a remark by the Chief of Station that implied that he might
assassinate Lumumba;

CONGOLESE POLITICIAN} INDICATED UNDERSTOOD

AND IMPLIED MIGHT PHYSICALLY ELIMINATE

LUMUMBA. (CIA Cable, (IN 49679,) Leopoldville

to Director, 9/7/60.) ’ : -
The cable continued to report that the Chief of Station had offered
to assist this politician "IN PREPARATION NEW GOVERNMENT PROGRAM"
and assured him that the United States would supply technicians
(CIA Cable, 9/7/60).

As the chaotic struggle for power raged, the Chief of a
the Africa Division succinctly summarized the prevalent U, Ss.
apprehension about Lumumba's ability to influence events in the

’ Congo by virtue of personality, irrespective of his official
position:

LUMUMBA TALENTS AND DYNAMISM APPEAR OVER-

RIDING FACTOR IN REESTABLISHING HIS POSITION

EACH TIME IT SEEMS HALF LOST. IN OTHER WORDS

EACH TIME LUMUMBA HAS OPPORTUNITY HAVE LAST

WORD HE CAN SWAY EVENTS TO HIS ADVANTAGE ,

(CIA Cable, (OUT 69233,) Director to Leopoldville,

9/13/60).

The day after Mobutu's coup, the Chief of Station reported
that he was serving as an advisor to a Congolese effort to "elimi-
nate" Lumumba due to his "fear" that Lumumba might, in fact, have

- been strengthened by placing himself in UN custody, which afforded

a safe base of operations:

(CIA Cable, (IN 13374 ,) Leopoldville to Director,
9/15/60.) :

On September 17, another CIA operative in the Congo met
with a leading Congolese senator. At this meeting, the senator
requested a clandestine supply of small arms to equip some

Congolese Army troops. The cable to CIA headquarters concerning

the meeting reported:

[CONGOLESE SENATOR] REQUESTED CLANDESTINE

that they should

* This recommendation proved to be in line with large scale
planning at CIA headquarters for clandestine paramilitary support
_€0 anti-Lumumba elements. On October 6, 1960, Richard Bissell and
Bronson Tweedy signed a cable concerning plans which the |Chief of~
Station was instructed not to discuss with State Department repre-
sentatives or operational contacts:

4. The Plot to Assassinate Lumumba

In the fall of 1960, a scientist from CIA headquarters
delivered to the phiet of|\Station in Leopoldville Lethal bio-
logical substances to be used to assassinate Patrice Lumumba.

The Chief of Station testified that afrer requesting and receiving
confirmation from CIA headquarters that he was to carry out the
scientist's instructions, he proceeded to take “exploratory steps"

in furtherance of the assassination plot. The [enter of |\Station

testified that in the course of his discussion with the CIA

scientist, aney « “Gorelicb | he was informed that President Eisenhower
had ordered the assassination mission against Patrice Lumumba.
footttien)s mission to the Congo was both preceded and followed by
general cables urging the ' "elimination" of Lumumba sent from CIA
headquarters in an extraordinarily restricted "Eves Only" channel --

including two messages under the personal signature of Allen Dulles.

The lethal substances were never used by the ichiet of
Station, But despite the fact that Lumumba had placed himself in
the protective custody of the UN peace-keeping force shortly
before the poisons were delivered to the /Chief of| Station, there
is no clear evidence that the assassination operation was termi-
nated before Lumumba's death. There is, however, no direct evidence
of a connection between the CIA assassination plot and the events

which actually led to Lumumba's death.*

*® See Section 6, infra, for a discussion of the evidence about
the circumstances that Ted to Lumumba's death in Katanga.

(a) Dulles Cables Again for "Elimination" of Lumumba,
and a Messenger is Sent to Congo With a Highly

Sensitive Assignment

On September 19, 1960, several days after Lumumba placed him-

self in the protective custody of the United Nations peacekeeping
force in Leopoldville, Richard Bissell and Bronson Tweedy signed
a cryptic cable to Leopoldville to arrange a clandestine meeting
between the (chief of) Station and "Gianey) Braun," who was traveling

to the Congo on an unspecified assignment:

cer") SHOULD ARRIVE,APPROX 27 SEPT. . . WILL
ANNOUNCE HIMSELF AS '(SID} FROM PARIS". . . IT
-URGENT YOU SHOULD SEE ['{SIDB"] SOONEST POSSIBLE
AFTER HE PHONES YOU. HE’ WILL FULLY IDENTIFY
HIMSELF AND Gurtie HIS ASSIGNMENT TO YOU.

@

(CIA Cable, (OUT 71464) Bissell/Tweedy to Chief
of Station, 9/19/60.)
con The cable bore a highly unusual sensitivity indicator --
“PROP" -- that restricted circulation at CIA headquarters to the

Chief of the Africa Division.*

* In a letter of September 23, 1975, the Chief of the CIA Review
Staff informed the Committee that "PROP" was normally used "to

denote sensitive personnel matters" (Seymour R. Bolton to Frederick
A. 0, Schwarz and Frederick D. Baron, 9/23/75. It appears that this
sensitivity indicator, while created for other purposes, was utilized
by Bissell, Tweedy, and the Chief of Station to restrict distribucion
of their communications about an assassination operation. The cable
traffic cited in this report that was sent through the PROP channel
did not touch upon personnel matters except in terms of recruiting
additional CIA officers and agents for the assassination operation.

The Bissell/Tweedy cable informed the €nieg of station that

he was to continue to use this indicator for
ALL [CABLE] TRAFFIC THIS OP, WHICH You
INSTRUCTED HOLD ENTIRELY TO YOURSELF.
(CIA Cable, 9/19/60.)

The (Chieg of)station -- referred to herein as "Hedgman"* --
testified to a clear, independent recollection of receiving such
a cable. Hedgman stated that in September of 1960 he received a
"most unusual" cable from CIA headquarters (Hedgman, 8/21/75, pp.
43). The cable advised, in his words, that:

someone who I would have recognized would

arrive with instructions for me.... I

believe the message was also marked for my

eyes only... and contained instructions

that I was not to discuss the message with

anyone. (Hedgman, 8/21/75, pp. 12-13.)
Hedgman said that the cable did not specify the kind of instruc-
tions he was to receive, and it "did not refer to Lumumba in any
way" (Hedgman, 8/21/75, p. 12).

Three days after the Bissell/Tweedy message that Hedgman was
to meet "Sid" in Leopoldville, Bronson Tweedy uses the same sensi-
tivity indicator on a cable sent to Hedgman on an “Eyes Only"

basis (CIA Cable, bor 74837, Tweedy to Leopoldville, 9/22/60).
a

* Due to fear of reprisal from Lumumba's followers, the(chies
of) Station for the Congo from mid-summer 1960 through 1961 testi-
fied under the alias "Hedgman" (Hedgman, 8/21/75, p. 2; 8/25/75,
p. 4). . .

C Tweedy's cable indicated that a third country national would be
_ required as an agent in the PROP operation:
IF DECIDED SUPPORT FOR PROP OBJECTIVES,
BELIEVE ESSENTIAL SUCH BE PROVIDED THROUGH
THIRD NATIONAL CHANNEL WITH [AMERICAN]
ROLE COMPLETELY CONCEALED. (CIA Cable,
9/22/60.) '
Tweedy expressed reservations about two agents that the station
was using for other operations and said "WE ARE CONSIDERING A
THIRD NATIONAL CUTOUT CONTACT CANDIDATE AVAILABLE HERE WHO MIGHT
FELL BILL"* (CIA Cable, 9/22/60). Despite Tweedy's concern about
the two existing station contacts, he indicated that the (Chief of)
station and his "colleague" -- presumably the man identified as .
(vsia") no was to arrive in the Congo shortly to explain the PROP
C operation to Hedgman -- were to be afforded considerable latitude
in exercising their judgment on the conduct of the operation:
YOU AND COLLEAGUE UNDERSTAND WE CANNOT READ

STANDING OPPORTUNITY EMERGES WHICH MAKES

On September 24, Allen Dulles personally issued a cable to

Leopoldville expressing in absolute terms his desire to “eliminate”

Lumumba:

(b) (Gottrieb\petivers Lethal Substances to the (Chief of)
Station “in the Congo for the Assassination of Lumumba

The (hiet of) Station reported through the PROP channel to Bronson
Tweedy that he had made contact with the man dispatched to Leopoldville
with a highly sensitive assignment on September | 26. (CIA Cable

(ay 18989), Leopoldville to Tweedy, 9/27/60) This was the same
week in which Dulies cabled about the “elimination” of Lumumba
and made his statement to the NSC about the "grave danger" that
existed as long as Lumumba was not "disposed of".

Hedgman testified about the identity of("sz0") ~~ the messenger
referred to in the first cable through the PROP channel:

Q: ‘Who was the messenger who arrived?

Hedgman: ur. (Sidney Gottlieb.)

Doclda:32202467 Page 20


- 19 -

C ; Qs; And at that time, you knew who he was?

Hedgman, I recognized him as an officer of the
gency... . I believe he referred to the
fact that I had received a message and that he
was the person concerned. (Hedgman, 8/21/75,
pp. 15-16)

The message carried by (Gottlieb, then Science Advisor to

DDP Richard Bissell,) was unmistakeably clear according to Hedgman:

Hedeman: it is my recollection that he advised me, or
my instructions were, to eliminate Lumumba.

Q: By eliminate, do you mean assassinate?

Hedgman: Yes. I would say that was . . . my under-
standing of the primary means. I don't think it was
probably limited to that, if there was some other way
of doing it.

Q:. OF doing what?

o Hedgman: Of removing him from a position of political
threat. (Hedgman, 8/21/75, pp. 17-18.)

Hedgman said that he and (Gottlieb) also may have discussed non-
lethal means of removing Lumumba as a "political threat", but
he said, "I cannot recall with certainty on that" (Hedgman,

8/21/75, p. 28).

He clearly recalled the discussion of assassination,

however: .
Q: And what did Mr. (Gottlieb indicate with regard to
thé possibility of physically eliminating him?

Hedgman: It was my understanding that that was
probably expected of me. (Hedgman, 8/21/75, p. 18.)

And again:

Q: I take it that once you started discussing these
Tethal agents, there was no doubt in your mind that
the kind of elimination he was there particularly to
discuss was killing Lumumba?

Hedgman: There was no doubt in jmy mind that
this Was one of the way{s], and probably what
they thought was the only way that would work
(Hedgman, 8/21/75, p. 25).

. Mus oe
Hedgman explained (ort1ied provided him with poisons as a means

of assassination:

ne And what did he tell you with regard to
ow that might be accomplished?

Hedgman: ... He brought some biological agents.

I assume that that's the correct word, But in

any case, poisonous agent with him, which he

passed to me.... ‘

Q: These were lethal biological substances?

Hedgman: Yes. That was ny understanding

asa non-expert. (lledgman, 8/21/75, pp. 18-19.)
Hedgman testified that he received "rubber gloves, a mask, and a
syringe" along with the poisons and that Gottiied instructed hin:
in their use (Hedgman, 8/21/75, pp. 20-21). Hedgman indicated that

this paraphernalia was for administering the poisons to Lumumba:

\

Q: {When ne({Gottlieb}) came to the Congo

to give you lethal biological agents for

the assassination of Lumumba, was it clear

at that time that the means for administering
those biological agents was to inject them” *
into a substance that was to be ingested by
Lumumba, whether it be food, or drink, or
toothpaste or any other substance that was

to be ingested?

Hedgman: That's my recollection, yes,
CH aaa, 8/21/75, p. 82; accord. p. 24.)
Hedgman said that the means of assassination was not restricted
to use of the poisons provided by (GoctLiey):
This was not a sine qua non that I employ this. :

If there were another method, another way, it
would have been acceptable. (Hedgman, 8/21/75, p. 19.)

HW 50955 Docld:32202487 Page 22


-21-

‘For example, Hedgman testified that he may have "suggested"
shooting Lumumba fo Gotcliey) as an alternative to poisoning
(Hedgman, 8/21/75, pp. 27-29). ;
: There was a firm requirement, however, that the means of assassi-

nation should not be traceable to the United States:

The biological substance, or specimens, what .
have you, I think it was up to my judgment,

and if there was a better way -- certainly,

[T]he point I now recall was in no way, if I

implemented these instructions, no way could

it be traced back to the United States. It

had to be a way which could not be traced

back ... either to an American or the United

States government. (Hedgman, 8/21/75, p. 19.)

Hedgman said (Gorelied] assured him that.the poisons were pro-

duced to meet this requirement:

a | I believe I raised the point that poisons left
wens traces in the human body, which could be found
on autopsy ... I believe that I was assured

that these ... Lethal agents would [leave]
normal traces found in people that die of
certain diseases, (Hedgman, 8/21/75, Pp. 23.)

Hedgman said that he had an “emotional reaction of great sur-
prise’ when it first became clear that Gottlieb) was there to discuss
an assassination plan (Hedgman, 8/21/75, p. 30). But the (chiet of)
Station said that he did not give any indication that he would not
carry out the instructions (Hedgman, 8/21/75, Pp. 46). Instead, he
told Govelieb jhe “would explore this" (Hedgman, 8/21/75, p. 46)
and left him with the following impression:

I think it would be a fair impression that he would

take away the thought that I was going to look into it
and try and figure if there was a way ... I beljeve I

stressed the difficulty of trying to carry
out gush an operation. (Hedgman, 8/21/75,
p. 47.

The cable that Hedgman sent to headquarters reporting his
initial contact with (Gottlieb was clearly an affirmative response
to the assignment. The( Chief of) Station said that he and (Gottlieb)
were “ON SAME WAVELENGTH." (CIA Cable IN 18989, Leopoldville to
Tweedy, 9/27/60.) Hedgman’ was "afraid" that [Hobutu's |government
was "weakening under" foreign pressure to effect a reconciliation

with Lumumba, and said:

HENCE BELIEVE MOST RAPID ACTION CONSISTENT
WITH SECURITY INDICATED. (CIA Cable, 9/27/60.)

(c) Hedgman Testified that (Gottlieb) Told Him That
President Eisenhower Had Ordered the Assassination
of Lumumba

Hedgman testified that in the course of their meeting in~
Leopoldvilte, (pr. Gottlieb} informed him that President Eisenhower

had authorized the assassination of Lumumba:

Did you raise with him the question of authori-
zation of such instructions to you?

Hedeman: Yes, I did. That's my quite strong
recollection, that I did.

Q: What do you recall in essence was what you
said to him?

Hedgman: In essence, I think I must have ... pointed
out that this was not a common or usual Agency tactic,
and I may have probably said that I never heard of
- it being done, which I had not, never in my training
or previous work in the Agency had I ever heard any
xveferences to such, in my recollection at least, such
methods. And it is my recollection I asked on whose
authority these instructions were issued.

HW 50955 Docld:32202487 Page 24 . _


-24-

( . Hedgman cautioned that he was recalling events long past:

Hedgman: Gentlemen, after fifteen years, I cannot
be per cent certain, but I have always, since
that date, had the impression in my mind that these
orders had come om the President. (Hedgman,
8/21/75, p. 34.) :

But he left no doubt about the strength of his "impression":

: You have a very firm recollection that he
(Teoteiich| represented to you that the President
of the-United States directed the assassination of
Patrice Lumumba, is that correct?

Hedgman: That's my recollection. Yes. (Hedgman,
8721775, p. 102; accord, p. 34.)

(d) Headquarters Makes the Assassination Plot "Highest
Priority” and Authorizes Steps In Furtherance of Tt

On the basis of his talks wien("sia,’ Hedgman listed a

number of "possibilities" for covert action against Lumumba. At
the top of the list was the Suggestion that a particular agent
be used in the following manner:

, HAVE HIM TAKE REFUGE WITH BIG BROTHER.

WOULD THUS ACT AS INSIDE MAN TO BRUSH UP

DETAILS TO RAZOR EDGE. (CIA Cable, 9/27/60.)
Hedgman indicated that he would begin to follow this. course by re-
calling the agent to Leopoldville. (CIA Cable, 9/27/60.) He in-
formed headquarters: ''PLAN PROCEED ON BASIS PRIORITIES AS LISTED
ABOVE, UNLESS INSTRUCTED TO CONTRARY" (CIA Cable, 9/27/60) «

- On September 30, the Cniet of) Station urged that head-

quarters authorize "exploratory conversations" with this agent. so

¢ The same day, through the PROP channel, Hedeman received
authorization from headquarters to proceed with his top priority

plan:

ACTIVE AGENT OR CUTOUT ROLE.
. APPRECIATE MANNER YOUR APPROACH TO
PROBLEM. (CIA Cable, OUT 759060,/Fields)to

{
In this cable, \Glenn Fields,\ Assistant Chief of the Africa Division,
a
expressed a "HOPE ... FOR MODERATE HASTE" (CIA Cable (ovr 75900,)
Fields to Leopoldville, 9/30/60.) .

According to the report of the (Chief of) Station, (covelieb)
left the Congo to return to headquarters on October 5 in view of
the "EXPIRATION DATE HIS MATERIALS" {CIA Cable (a 2a171) Leopold-

C ville to Tweedy, 10/7/60). The "expiration" of Gotttied's)
“materials! probably refers to the date beyond which the substances
would no longer have lethal strength. Although the relation of
the "expiration date" to (Gottlieb 's) departure is unclear from the
cables, it probably signifies that some of the biological substances
had lost their toxicity. Nonetheless, the €niet of) Station indi-
cated that Gortliet) Lert some biological substances that were still
lethal and that he intended to proceed with the assassination

operation:

‘a By this point, Hedgman had conducted his “exploratory con-
versation" with the agent who was his best candidate for gaining
access to Lumumba (Hedgman, 8/21/75, Pp. 60). Hedgman testified
that the subject he "explored" was the agent's ability to find a
means to inject poison into Lumumba's food or toothpaste (Hedgman

8/21/75, p. 60):

I believe that I queried the agent who had
access to Lumumba, and his entourage, in
detail about just what that access, what
access he actually had, as opposed to speak-
ing to people. In other words, did he have
access to the bathroom, did he have access
to the kitchen, things of that sort.

IT have a recollection of having queried him
on that without specifying why I wanted to
know this. (Hedgman, 8/21/75, p. 48.)

Hedgman testified that his exploratory steps left him with
doubts about the wisdom or practicality of the assassination plot:
[Clertainly I looked on it as a pretty wild
scheme professionally. I did not think that
it ... was practical professionally.
~ Certainly ... to keep the U.S. out of it....

I explored it, but I doubt that I ever really
expected to carry it out. (Hedgman, 8/21/75, p. 111.)

However, his cables indicate that he was planning to con-
tinue to implement the operation and sought the resources to do
it successfully. He urged headquarters to send him an alternate
operative for the assassination mission in ‘the event that they
found his first choice unacceptable:

IF HQS BELIEVE [AGENT'S CIRCUMSTANCES ]
BAR HIS PARTICIPATION, WISH STRESS NECES-
SITY PROVIDE STATION WITH QUALIFIED THIRD
COUNTRY NATIONAL. (CIA CablefIN 24171,
Leopoldville to Tweedy, 10/7/60.)

Tweedy cabled the (nies of }Station the same day that he "HAD
GOOD DISCUSSION. YOUR COLLEAGUE 7 OCT" -~ presumably referring to
a de-briefing of(cotetied) upon his return to the United States.
(CIA Cable (ur 78336), Tweedy to Leopoldville, 10/7/60.) Tweedy
. (we indicated that he was

PERIOD TO SEE WHETHER HE MIGHT PLAY
ACTIVE OR CUTOUT ROLE ON FULL TIME BASIS.
(CIA Cable OUT 78336, Tweedy to (Chief of)
Station, 10/7/60.) .

This expression of support for the operation was followed by
an extraordinary pair of cables from headquarters on October 15,
1960. One of these cables was issued by a desk officer in CIA's
Africa Division and released under Bronson Tweedy's signature, as
Division Chief, and sent to Leopoldville through standard CIA

channels, which would allow for distribution of the message to

HW 50955 Docld:32202467 Page 28


appropriate personnel in thé CIA étatién and the United States
embassy. This cable ... generally discussed the possibility of
covertly supplying certain Congolese leaders with funds and
military aid (CIA Cable bur #1476) Director to Leopoldville,
10/15/60). This cable also delimited the kind of action against

Lumumba that would be authorized:

ONLY DIRECT ACTION WE CAN NOW STAND BEHIND
IS TO SUPPORT IMMOBILIZING OR ARRESTING
[LUMUMBA], DESIRABLE AS MORE DEFINITIVE
ACTION MIGHT BE. ANY ACTION TAKEN WOULD
HAVE TO BE ENTIRELY CONGOLESE. (CIA Cable
(OUT 81476,) Director to Leopoldvilie,
10/15/60.)

On the same day that this message was dispatched, a second
cable was sent to Leopoldville. This cable was issued personally
o by Bronson Tweedy and sent in the special PROP channel for
Hedgman's "EYES ONLY" (CIA Cable bur 81396) Tweedy to hies of)
Station, 10/15/60). ,

Thus, Tweedy resolved the apparent duplication of cables by indi-

cating that communications about the assassination mission were

restricted to the PROP channel and that the assassination
mission was to move forward. He went on to request Hedgman's
reaction to the prospect of sending a senior CIA case officer to
the Congo on a "DIRECTED ASSIGNMENT ... TO CONCENTRATE ENTIRELY
THIS ASPECT" (CIA Cable (our 81396) Tweedy to (nies of) Station,
10/15/60). This referred to CIA officer/Justin O'Donnel] who
testified that in late October he was asked by Richard Bissell to
undertake the mission of assassinating Lumumba.*

In the course of suggesting the assignment of an additional
officer to the Congo, the cable provided insight into the reason
that the assassination mission had not progressed more rapidly
under the Chief o£)Station:

SEEMS TO US YOUR OTHER COMMITMENTS TOO HEAVY
GIVE NECESSARY CONCENTRATION PROP. (CIA
Cable OUT 81396), ‘Tweedy to (Chief of) Station,
10/15/60.) : .

Again, in contradiction of the limitations on anti-Lumumba
activity outlined in the cable sent through normal channels,
Tweedy's cable also proposed a plan to kidnap Lumumba:

POSSIBILITY USE COMMANDO TYPE GROUP FOR

ABDUCTION [LUMUMBA], EITHER VIA ASSAULT

C _ This series of cables sent during, and afrer
(coreLied)'s visit to the Congo demonstrated a clear intent at CIA
headquarters to authorize and support rapid progress on the assassi-
nation mission. The cables also show an intent to severely re-
strict knowledge of the assassination operation among officers in
CIA's Africa Division and among United States personnel in the
Congo, including those who were aware of and involved in other
covert activities.

(ey) The (chief of) Station Moves Forward With Assassination

ot*

The testimony of the Cries of) Station, taken fifteen
years after the events in question and without benefit of review
of the cables discussed above, was compatible with the picture

derived from the cables of a fully authorized and tightly restricted

assassination operation. Hedgman's testimony is at variance from
the cables only with respect to the lack of. vigor with which he
claims to have pursued the assignment which he dealt with in an

affirmative, aggressive manner in the cables.

(i) The Ghiet of )Station Testified That He Requested
and Receive onfirmation of the Assassination

Plan From Headquarters

Hedgman testified that, after receiving Goreiied's

instructions, he cabled CIA headquarters seeking confirmation that

he was to carry out Gortliet)'s instructions (Hedgman, 8/21/75,

Pp. 36). Hedgman did not recall whether he identified Gotetied) by
~ name, and he doubted that he "would have" mentioned the President

in such a cable (Hedgman, 8/21/75, pp. 36, 43).

HW 50955 Dockd:32202467 Page 31 . oo


~32-

C Nedgman described the extraordinary security precautions he
took cabling his request for confirmation of the assassination in-
structions:

There was some special channel ... because
it was handled differently than any other
normal message. For example, it was not put
on a regular cable form, which, you know,
you have several copies for your various files,
And it was my recollection that I personally
carried the message to the communicator to
encrypt, and that was worded in a doublt-talk
way that even the communicator would not
necessarily know what it was about."
(Hedgman, 8/21/75, pp. 42-43.)
This description approximates the PROP channel that was used for
all cables relating to the assassination mission.
Hedgman testified that soon after cabling his request for con-

{ firmation that he was to carry out the assassination assignment,
he received an affirmative reply from headquarters:

I believe I received a reply which I interpreted

to mean yes, that he was the messenger and his.

instructions were ... duly authorized.

(Hedgman, 8/21/75, pp. 37-38.)
Despite the cryptic nature of the cables, Hedgman said "I was con-
vinced that yes, it was right." (Hedgman, 8/21/75, pp. 44, 50.)

,- Hedgman did not recall receiving any indication, either from
OT ky
Gottlieb lor by cable, that he was to await further authorization
before using the poisons (Hedgman, 8/21/75, p. 38). Hedgman ex-
~ pressed some uncertainty about whether he “had an absolute free

hand" to proceed with an assassination attempt without receiving

“final confirmation" (Hedgman, 8/21/75, pp. 38, 47, 53).

HW 50955 Dockd:32202487 Page 32 + -


-33-

C Hedgman summarized his testimony on this question in his

second appearance:

I probably had authority to act on my own
but ... it was possible that I had to go
back and get clearance for my action.
(Hedgman, 8/25/75, p. 1L; see also 8/21/75,
p. 39.)

Hedgman testified, however, that a “policy decision” had been
made -- that assassination had been "approved" as “one means" of

eliminating Lumumba as a political threat (Hedgman, 8/21/75, p. 52).

i thought the policy decision had been made

in the White House, not in the Agency, and

that the Agency had been selected as the
Executive Agent, if you will, to carry out

a political decision. (Hedgman, 8/21/75, p. 52.)

Although Hedgman assumed that the President had not personally
selected the means of assassination, he testified that he was under
the impression that the President had authorized the CIA to do so

and to proceed to take action:

Hedgman: ... I doubt that I thought the
Président had said, you use this system.
But my understanding is the President had
made a decision that an act should take
place, but then put that into the hands of
the Agency to carry out his decision.

Qs Whatever that act was to be, it was
clearly to be assassination or the death
of the foreign political leader?

Hedgman: Yes. +
Q: Instigated by the CIA, initiated by the CIA?

pegpmen: Certainly if those -- if Dr. Gottlieb|'s
ethal agents were employed, that would have been
the result, yes. (Hedgman, 8/21/75, p. 104.)

HW 50955 Dockd:32202487 Page 33


of,

Seo"

-34-

Nonetheless, Hedgman said he had no “desire to carry out

these instructions" (Hedgman, 8/21/75, p. 106). Whether or not
he felt there was authority to attempt an assassination without
seeking final confirmation, he said that he would have checked
with headquarters before taking action:

I think probably that I would have gone back

and advised that I intended to carry out and

sought final approval before carrying it out

had I been going to do it, had there been a

way to do it. I did not see it as ... a .

matter which could be accomplished practically,

certainly. (Hedgman, 8/21/75, pp. 51-52.)
He proceeded to affirm that his reason for seeking a final approval
would have been te receive assurances about the practicality of the
specific mode of assassination that he planned to use (Hedgman,
8/21/75, p. 53). :

(ii) The (Chief of)/Station Took “Exploratory Steps! in
urtherance Of the Assassination Plot and Testitied
That He Destroyed Cablé Traffic Related to the Plot
Hedgman testified that after Gottlieb 's) visit, he locked

the lethal substances in the bottom drawer of his safe, "probably"
sealed in an envelope marked "Eyes Only" with his name on it
(Hedgman, 8/21/75, pp. 48-49). He said that his secretary was
the only other person with access to the safe and that she would
not have examined a package marked in this fashion (Hedgman, 3/21/73,
p. 49).

Hedgman testified that it was "possible" that he pre-

served the poisons in his safe until after Lumumba's death; at any

The cable traffic conforms to Hedgman's recollection. For
two months after Gotciieb's arrival in the Congo, a regular stream
of messages flowed between the Leopoldville Chief off Station and
headquarters through the PROP channel, In late September and early
October the cables concerned the initiation of Hedgman's top priority .
plan -- recruiting the aid of a particular agent thought to have
sufficient access to Lumumba's entourage to be able to poison
Lumumba.* In mid-October, Tweedy notified the Chief of) Station
that the assassination mission remained "HIGHEST PRIORITY", and

he suggested sending additional personnel to Leopoldville to in-

.tensify "CONCENTRATION" on this operation (CIA Cable OUT 81396, Tweedy

to Chief of Station, 10/15/60) .**
These cables were followed by Hedgman's report to Tweedy on

October 17 that the agent he had picked for the assassination mission

Hedgman testified that this operative left Leopoldville “sometime
in October" which terminated their discussions about gaining access
to Lumumba for-the purpose of assassinating him (Hedgman, 8/21/75,
p. 61). The (nies of) Station continued to communicate with head-
quarters about finding a means ‘to move forward with the assassina-

tion operation and securing the necessary manpower to do so.

Hedgman confirmed Tweedy's view that although the assassination
operation was still his highest priority, he was overburdened with
responsibility for other operations so that he could not concentrate
on the progress of the assassination mission:

ALTHOUGH MAINTAINING PRIORITY INTEREST THIS
OP, ABLE DEVOTE ONLY LIMITED AMOUNT TIME,

Due to his workload, the Ghiet of) Station responded enthusiastically

to Tweedy's suggestion of an additional case officer:

The (hiee of)Station concluded this cable with the following
cryptic recommendation, reminiscent of his testimony that he
may have "suggested! shooting Lumumba to Gottlied as an alternative
to poisoning (liedgman, 8/21/75, pp. 27-29):

IF CASE OFFICER SENT, RECOMMEND HQS

POUCH SOONEST HIGH POWERED FOREIGN MAKE

RIFLE WITH TELESCOPIC SCOPE AND SILENCER.

HUNTING GOOD HERE WHEN LIGHTS RIGHT.

HOWEVER AS HUNTING RIFLES NOW FORBIDDEN,

WOULD KEEP RIFLE IN OFFICE PENDING OPENING

OF HUNTING SEASON, (CIA Cable (qi 28936.)

10/17/60.)

The first sentence of Hedgman's recommendation clearly refers
to sending a sniper rifle to the Congo via diplomatic pouch. The
west of the message is probably an oblique reference to the
possibility of shooting Lumumba at the "OPENING OF HUNTING SEASON” --
in other words, at the first opportunity to find Lumumba outside
the residence where he remained in UN protective custody. This
interpretation is bolstered by a report sent the next month by
the (nies of) Station through the PROP channel for Tweedy's "EYES
ALONE." Hedeman's cable described the stalemate which prevailed from
mid-September until Lumumba's departure for Stanleyville on
November 27; Lumumba was virtually a prisoner in UN custody, but
inaccessible to CIA agents and the Congolese:

Hedgman testified that all of his cable traffic about the

assassination question would have been sent with the same
extraordinarily stringent security precautions ~~ presumably re-

ferring to the PROP channel -- which concerned Gotttieb') visit

and the confirmation of authorization for his instructions:
:

I would have sent in a special channel
anything dealing with Lumumba, at least
that would touch upon his removal in one
way or another. (Hedgman, 8/21/75, p. 62.)

The (nies of Station also testified that sometime before
leaving the Station, he destroyed all cable traffic relating to
the assassination mission (Hedgman, 8/21/75, p. 89). Hedgman's
best recollection was that he had received instructions to destroy
those cables (Hedgman, 8/21/75, p. 96). Hedgman said he had never
before in his tenure as Ghiet of Station in the Congo destroyed
cable traffic because of its sensitivity (Hedgman, 8/21/75, p. 91).
But he stated that the cables relating to assassination were

destroyed because of their extremely sensitive nature.* He said

* Ie is possible that copies of cables dealing with such a
sensitive operation were also destroyed at CIA headquarters.

( that eventually

I destroyed a great deak of traffic, because
the Congo was a highly sensitive area in
which -- at one period I recall we had all
of our files in the burn barrels. 1 mean,
when you wanted a file, you went over and
dug it out of the burn barrell. (Hedgman,
8/21/75, p. 91.)

At the conclusion of his testimony about the assassination
piot, the bnies of} Station was asked to give a general characteri-
zation of the advisability of the plot and the tenor of the times
in which it took place. His response indicated that although he
was willing to carry out what he considered a duly authorized
order, he was not convinced of the necessity of assassinating

Lumumba :

I looked upon the Agency-as an executive
arm of the Presidency.... Therefore, I
suppose I thought that it was an order
issued in due form from an authorized
authority,

On the other hand, I looked at.it as a
kind of operation that I could do without,
that I thought that probably the Agency’
and the U.S. government could get along
without. I didn't regard Lumumba as the
kind of person who was going to bring on
World War III or something.

I might have had a-somewhat different
attitude if I thought that one man could
bring on World War III and result in the
deaths of millions of people or something,
but I didn't see him in that light. I saw
him'as a danger to the political position

7 of the United States in Africa, but
nething more than that. (Hedgman, 8/21/75,
pp. 110-111.)

(£) Testimony of Bissell and Tweedy About the Degree
gf Support for and Ferpetration of the Assassination
Prot

There is a great variance between the testimony of Richard
Bissell and Bronson Tweedy and the picture of the assassination
plot presented by the (hier of) Scation and the cable traffic from
the period. While the weight of the evidence demonstrates that
the assassination effort was the "highest priority" at CIA head-
quarters among cperations in the Congo, Bissell has no direct
recollection of fovclieb 3) mission to the Congo and Tweedy can
recall nothing more than consideration of the feasibility of an

assassination attempt.

q) Tweedy Had No Recollection of the Operation
To Potson Lumumba

As Chief of the Africa Division, Bronson Tweedy was the principal
liaison at CIA headquarters with the nies of) Station in Leopoldville
for all instructions, plans, and progress reports concerning the
effort to assassinate Lumumba, which were communicated through the
special PROP channel. Most of the reports and recommendations
cabled to headquarters by the Chiet of) Station on the assassination
operation were marked for Tweedy's “Eyes Only.”

Tweedy personally signed both the cable which initially informed
the bhiet of) Station that “SID") would arrive in Leopoldville, with |

had debriefed Gotersed) upon his return from the Congo (CIA Cable

the "Eyes Only" recipient of Hedgman's reports on (Gottlieb's)
arrival in the Congo (CIA Cable (IN 18989} (Chief of)Station to
Tweedy, 9/27/60) and the subsequent communications about the plan
which emerged from the discussions between Gotetiet) and Hedgman

Tweedy testified, however, without benefit of reviewing these

cables, that he had no knowledge of the plot to poison Lumumba:

%. Do. you have any knowledge of a messenger

from CIA headquarters having to go to the Congo

to provide the Chief of)Station in the Congo

with instructions to carry out the assassination

of Lumumba, if possible, and also provide him

with the tools to carry out such an assassination,

namely, poisons and medical equipment for admin-
istering them?

Mr. Tweedy. No, I do not. (Tweedy, 9/9/75, pp. 30-31)

When asked his opinion about the truth of the testimony received
by the Committee that poisons were delivered to the Congo by
(covtliet), who carried instructions that they were to be used in
the assassination of Lumumba, Tweedy replied:

There is nothing in my experience with the

Agency which would really bear on that

point whatsoever. _ (Tweedy, 9/9, pp. 39-39)

Tweedy added that if Gottlieb) went to the Congo as a courier,
“I will bet I knew it, but I dom'e recall it" (Iweedy, 9/9, p. 35).
Tweedy testified that it was "perfectly possible" for lethal bio-
logical substances to have been sent to the Congo, "but I don't
recall it" (Tweedy, 9/9, p. 30).

In response to a question about whether he knew about a cable
from headquarters informing Hedgman that a messenger was to come to
the Congo with instructions for hin, Tweedy said that he would be
“very surprised if I didn't [know], but I certainly have no recoll-
ection of it whatsoever (Tweedy, 9/9, p. 31).

Tweedy said that he “was not going to gainsay" the testimony of
the fhiet of) Station that a cable was sent to headquarters through
a special channel requesting confirmation that the instructions
were to be carried out but he did not recall it (Tweedy, 9/9, pp.
32-33), ; ;

Tweedy. commented that rather than questioning the truth of the

testimony of the (hier of Station,» the discrepancies in their

x Tweedy expressed a high regard for the general credibility of the
(chief of} Station. Tweedy said that he never had occasion to doubt
Hedgman's veracity or integrity, adding, "I would trust his memory
and I certainly trust his integrity." (Tweedy, 9/9, p. 36)

testimony could be attributed to his own lack of recall

I’really am having trouble with this. I had to

be reminded of so many things. . .[T]he things
that I recall the most vividly about all my
African experiences were. . . the things I was

basically concerned with all the time, which was
putting this division together and the rest of
it. When it comes to operational detail I start
fuzzy and you would have thought with something
like thinking about Mr. Lumumba in these terms,
that I would have gone to bed and got up thinking
about Lumumba, I can assure you this wasn't the
case. (Tweedy, 9/9, p. 34)

e ¥

Tweedy was firm, however, in his disbelief that "Goreliel would
have left instructions with the (niet of) Station which would have
empowered [him]. . . to go out and assassinate Lumumba, without any
further recourse or reference to headquarters" (Tweedy, 9/9, pp. 32,
36). Tweedy said:

In such a matter of this kind, headquarters would
have wanted to have a last.word up to the last
minute. (Tweedy, 9/9, p. 36)

(ii) Tweedy Testified That He Discussed With Bissell
the Feasibility of Assassinating Lumumba and He
Cabled Hedgman About Gaining Access to Lumumba
For the Purpose of Assassination

Despite Tweedy's lack of recollection about the actual plot to

poison Lumumba, he did recall exploring the feasibility of an assass-

- ination attempt.

Tweedy testified that he had discussed the subject of assassin:
Lumumba "more than once" with Richard Bissell in the fall of 1960

(Tweedy, 9/9; pp. 14-15). Tweedy stated that he did not know

Dockd: 32202487 Page 43 — .



WW 50955

whether Bissell had consulted with any “higher authority" about
exploring the possibilities for assassinating Lumumba (Tweedy,

28).

tion from Bissell he would proceed to implement it on the assump -

p.

-45-

tion that it was fully authorized above the level of DDP:

inating Lumumba as "contingency planning" (Tweedy, 9/9/75, p. 28):

I would proceed with it on the basis that he
was authorized to give me instructions and it
was up to him to bloody well know what he was
empowered to tell me to do. (Tweedy, 9/9, p.13)

Tweedy characterized his discussions with Bissell about assass-

Tweedy. . . .L think it came up in the sense that
Dick would have said we probably better be
thinking about whether it might ever be necessary
or desirable te get rid of Lumumba, in which case
we presumably should be in position to assess

whether we could do it or not successfully.
Q. Do it, meaning carry off an assassination?

Tweedy. Yes, but it was never discussed with hin
in any other sense but a planning exercise, . .
never were we instructed to do anything of this
kind. We were instructed to ask whether. such a
thing would be feasible and to have the Chief of
Station be thinking along those lines as well
(Tweedy, 9/9, p. 15)

versation with, Bissell included “a few cables that he remembers

sending to the Chief of) Station asking him

to keep in mind what sort of access one might ever
have had to Lumumba, . .{in] the eventuality that
we might wish to get rid of Mr. Lumumba personally.
(Tweedy, 9/9, pp. 19-21)

Doclda:32202487 Page 44 -

Generally, Tweedy said, when he received an instruc-

Tweedy said that the planning that he undertook pursuant to his con-


Co

HW 50955

-46-

Tweedy did not recall inquiring about gaining access to Lumumba for

the purpose of abducting him from UN custody (Tweedy, 9/9, p. 24);

rather he "supposed" that various means of assassination were
being explored:

Q. Would this be access to shoot him or would this
be access to his personal food or drink or toiletries?

Tweedy. I suppose all those types of things might
have been considered. (Tweedy, 9/9, p. 23)

Q. In your discussions with Bissell, about the
feasibility of an assassination operation, did
poisons come up as one means that was being con-
sidered and which the (niet of) Station should explore?

Tweedy. TI am sure it must have. After all, there
are not many ways of doing it. Shoot a man, poison
him, of course you could, I suppose, stab him or
something like that. But basically you are talking
about a contingency plan which I assume has the best
possibility of protecting the involvement of the U.S.
Government and if you want to do it in a manner which
would be as distant, if that is the right word, as
possible, I think poison would then stand high on
the list of possibilities.

Tweedy did not "recall specifically” the response from the (cies
of )Station, but said he was "sure" that he received "a serious
answer. . . a disciplined reply to an instruction from headquarters"
(Tweedy, 9/9, pp. 23,27).

Although Tweedy did not recall sending or receiving cables in a
special channel concerning the "messenger" to the Congo or confirm-
ation of his instructions, he acknowledged that the cables exploring

access to Lumumba for the purpose of assassination would have been

Dockd: 32202487 Page 45 -


-47-

sent in a channel that was even more closely restricted than the
normal CIA‘cable traffic (Tweedy, 9/9, pp. 22, 32-33). Tweedy
said destruction of such cable traffic would have been left ta the
discretion of the (Chief o£) Station and he did not know whether
Hedgman destroyed the Station's copies (Tweedy, 9/9, p. 22).

Tweedy said "I would be surprised if I didn't” have a conver-
sation with Gidney Gottlieb) about "anything in his inventory that
could possibly be used, including lethal biological substances
(Tweedy, 9/9, pp. 68-69). Tweedy "suspected" that “the first
conversation along these lines would undoubtedly have been held
between Dick Bissell and Gidney Gottlieb}," which Tweedy then would
have "followed-up" (Tweedy, 9/9, p. 69).

(oe Tweedy maintained that the period in which he explored the
means of access for assassinating Lumumba remained “a planning
interval and at no point can I recall that I ever felt it was im-
minent that somebody would say 'go'" (Tweedy, 9/9. pp. 18-19):

Tweedy. It was always my assumption that at the
time. anything like this should occur there would
have been some kind of real focus on the problem
at probably a very considerable policy level with-
in the Agency. . . and it never occurred to me that
I would get a call or Bissell would ask me to come
down to his office and sya go to it. Nor were we
ever in a position where he said that I would
merely implement plan so-and-so, We never got
that far.

Q. You didn't have any action plans for the

assassination of Lumumba that you had prepared or
~ were aware of?

HW 50955 Docld:32202487 Page 46 : ~


~48-

Tweedy. No. Planning, yes, but nothing that
ever got anywhere. (Tweedy, 9/9, p. 19)

It is difficult to reconcile the cable traffic with Tweedy's
testimony that no action plans were launched and that no authoriz-
ation for implementing the assassination operation, authorization
for Hedgman's approach to his agent to explore access to Lumumba's
entourage is in accord with Tweedy's description of his inquiries
about gaining access to Lumumba.

However, the fact that Tweedy was personnaly informed that the
(chiet of) Station "PLANS CONTINUE TRY IMPLEMENT OP" (CIA Cable Gs
24171)(chiet of) Station to Tweedy, 10/7/60) is harder to reconcile
with his statements that a “go ahead" on the operation was never

CS imminent, especially in light of Tweedy's PROP cable the next week
which told the (caiet of) Station that Lumumba's
DISPOSITION SPONTANEOUSLY BECOMES NUMBER ONE
CONSIDERATION. . . THIS CHANNEL REMAINS FOR
SPECIFIC PURPOSE. YOU DISCUSSED WITH COLLEAGUE
AND ALSO REMAINS HIGHEST PRIORITY (CIA Cable
(our 81396), Tweedy toChiet o£)Station, 10/15/60)
(iii) Bissell Testified That He Did Not: Recall
Whether The Assassination Operation Had
Moved From Planning To Implementation

But Tt Was Not Against Agency Policy to
Send Poisons to The Congo

Richard Bissell testified that he did not remember discussing
the feasibility of assassinating Lumumba with Bronson Tweedy, but it
seemed "entirely probable" to him that such discussions took place

~ (Bissell, 9/10, pp. 3-4).

HW 50955 Dockd:32202467 Page 47


-49-

‘Bissell said he "may have" given Tweedy specific instructions about
steps he was to take to further an assassination plan, but he did
not remember to do so (Bissell, 9/10,p.4). Bissell said that
exploring access to Lumumba --"almost certainly" seeking information
from the Chiet of) Station about access for poisoning -- would have
been a "key part" of his "planning and preparatory activity” but

he had no specific recollection of cable communications on this
subject (Bissell, 9/10, pp. 6-8). Bissell remembered that he was
aware that the Chiet of) Station had an agent thought to have direct
access to Lumumba (Bissell, 9/10, p. 80).

Bissell testified that he “most certainly" approved any cables
that Tweedy sent to the fortes of) Station seeking information about
(ce gaining access to Lumumba but it was so sensitive a matter (Bissell,
9/10, p. 8) Bissell added:

I think Mr. Tweedy, on the basis of an oral author-
ization from me, would have had the authority to
send such a cable without my signing off on it.
(Bissell, 9/10, p. 8)

Bissell believed that Tweedy would have known of (Gotetiet)'s trip
to the Congo, although it-was possible that Tweedy was “cut out of
knowledge of the specific operation" (Bissell, 9/10, p. 21).
Bisseli's lack of recollection of discussing his assignment to

Gustin O'Donnel with Tweedy was the reason for his speculation that

~ * Bissell's ‘assignment co(0"Donnet}) is discussed in Sections 5(a)

(i) and 5(a) (ii), infra.

HW 50955 DocId:32202487 Paye 48 : -


-50-

Tweedy might have been unaware of the true purpose of (Covttieb )s
visit (Bissell, 9/10, pp. 20-22).

Bissell did not recall cables concerning the dispatch of a
messenger and subsequently confirming that his instructions were
to be followed, but he said "This sounds highly likely. . . 1
would expect, given the background, that the confirmation would
have been forthcoming’ (Bissell, 9/10, p. 43).

,

It was ‘very probable," according to Bissell, that he discussed

the assassination of Lumumba with (sidney Gott lied), who was then
[nis Science Advisor |(Bissell, 9/10, p. 14). Bissell said that on a
number of occasions he discussed with Goreliet) “the availability
of means of incapacitation, including assassination" (Bissell, 9/10,

Cw p. 60).

Although he had no "specific recollection," Bissell assumed
that, if Goectiet) went to the Congo, he had approved the mission,
(which “might very well" have dealt with the assassination of
Lumumba) (Bissell, 9/10, pp. 18, 20, 44). Despite his absence of
specific recollection of these events, Bissell said, "There is
nothing in mind that I remember that would be in conflict" with the
testimony of the (hice of) Station that Goceties) carried poisons to
the Congo (Bissell, 9/10, p. 35).

Bissell testified that it would not have been against CIA policy

in the fall of 1960 to send poisons to the Congo (Bissell, 9/10, p. 35).

HW 50955 DocEd:32202487 Page 49


-3L-

He classified "the act of taking the kit to the Congo. . . as still
in the planning stage" (Bissell, 9/10, p. 49). Bissell acknowledged,
however, that the dispatch of poisons and paraphernalia with which
to administer them was an extraordinary event:
It would indeed have been rather unusual to send
such materials -- a specific kit. .-. of this ~
sort -- out to a relatively small station, unless
planning for their use were quite far along.
(Bissell, 9/10, p. 37).
7 Nonetheless, Bissell said that he “probably believed" that he
had sufficient authority at that point to direct CIA officers to
move from the stage of planning to implementation (Bissell, 9/10,
pp. 60-61). In light of his absence of a specific recollection of
these events, he stated that "if it be taken as established that Mr.
‘or fGocerset) took specific instructions ‘to implement,’ " Gotrtiet)
would not have been acting beyond the mandate given to him by
Bissell and it would show that the assassination plot “had then passed

into an implementation phase" and that "authorization was given”

(Bissell, 9/10/ pp. 39, 41, 49).

C 9. The Question of a Connection Between the Assassination
Plot and Other Actions of CIA Officers and Operatives

in the Congo

(Gusein O'Donnel), a senior CIA officer in the clandestine

operations division in 1960, testified that during this period he
had been asked by DDP Richard Bissell to go to the Congo to carry
out the assassination of Lumumba 'Donnel), 6/9/75, pp. 11-12). .
(o"donneti) said that he refused to participate in an assassination
“operation, but proceeded to the Congo to attempt to draw Lumumba
away from the protective custody of the UN guard and place him in
the hands of Congolese authorities (@'Donne1i), 6/9/75, pp. 13-14).
Shortly after (0'Donnel}'s arrival in the Congo he was
joined by a CIA agent with a criminal background who was used the
following year by the CIA as part of a program to develop a stand-by
‘oo assassination capability. Late in 1960, one of the operatives of
the Cries of)Station in Leopoldville approached this agent of
(Q'Donne1t s with a proposition to join an “execution squad" (CIA
Cable cc 18739, Leopoldville to Director, 12/7/60).
Despite the fact that ('Donne11) was initially approached
to be part of the plot to assassinate Patrice Lumumba, it is un-
likely that (0'Donnet}) was actually involved in the implementation
of that plot by the (niet of) Station. Whether there is any connec-
tion between the assassination plot and either of the two operatives --

QIWIN and WIROGUE -- is less clear.

In early October, 1960, several cables sent in the

concentrate on the assassination operation, Richard Bissell broached
the subject with CIA officer (usein 0'Denne1}).

(

such a mission without the personal permission of Allen Dulles"

[(o'Donne11,| 9/11/75, p. 44). But the question of authorization

was never raised by Bissell:

cussed, nor did he purport to have higher

authority to do it. é Penney) 6/9/75, p. 15.)

we (0*domne1i) said that in one of his two conversations with

we

Bissell about Lumumba, he raised the prospect "that conspiracy
to commit murder being done in the District of Columbia might be
in violation of federal law" (6'Domet}), 6/9/75, p. 14). He said
that Bissell “airily dismissed" this prospect @'donneti) 6/9/75,
p. 14). -
Despite his refusal to participate in assassination, (°'Donnex?)

agreed to go to the Congo on a general mission to “neutralize”
Lumumba "as a political factor" @'Donne2}, 9/11/75, pp. 43-44);

I said I would go down and I would have no

compunction about operating to draw Lumumba

out [of UN custody], to run an operation to

neutralize his operations which were against

Western interests, against, I thought,
American interests. ({ ‘Dennel)), 6/9/75, p. 13.)

(0'Donne1i) added that his objective was to

neutralize Lumumba's influence ... and his
activities against [a Congolese leader},
whom at that time you might say was our close
instrument, ps was the man we had put our

. chips on. « "Donel, 9/11/75, p. 20.)

Bissell also recalled that; after their discussions about assassi-

nation, (O'Donnell) went to the Congo "with the assignment ... of
looking at other ‘ways of neutralizing Lumumba" (Bissell, 9/10/75,
p. 53).

Alchough (0'Donne1} did not formulate a precise plan until he

- reached the Congo, he discussed a general strategy with Bissell:

HW 50955 Dockd:32202487 Page 55


~5]~

Mr. l0'Donnel): I told Mr. Bissell that I
wou. e willing to go down to neutralize

his activities and operations and try to bring
him out [of UW custody} and turn him over to
the Congolese authorities, that is correct,

Senator Mondale: Was it discussed then that
1s ite might be taken by the Congolese
authorities?

Mr. 0'Donnel)): It was, I think, considered -
in the -- not to have him killed, but then
it would have been a Congolese being judged
by Congolese for Congolese, crimes. Yes, I

think it was discussed. (O'Donnel), 6/9/75,
p. 38.) \

There was a "very, very high probability" that Lumumba would re-
ceive capital punishment at the hands of the Congolese authorities,
\ .
according to @'Donnet2 (O'Donnell), 9/11/75, p. 24). But (O'Donnell)
y \ y
“had no compunction about bringing him out and then having him
tried by a jury of his peers" (@' Bonnet) 6/9/75, p. 14).
Although 0" Donte LI) had expressed his aversion to assassination
?
Co Bissell and had undertaken a more general mission to "neutralize"
Lumumba's ‘influence, it was clear to him that Bissell was still
interested in the assassination of Lumumba:
in leaving at the conclusion of our second
discussion ... he said, well, I wouldn't
rule out that possibility -- meaning the
possibility of the elimination or the killing
of Lumumba -- I wouldn't rule it. In other
words, even though you have said this, don't
rule it out.... There is no question about
it, he said, EZ wouldn't rule this other out,
meaning the elimination or the assassination
(© 'Donnel1) 9/11/75, p. 45).
(0'Donneti) had a distinctive recollection that after his second dis-

cussion of Lumumba with Bissell, he met with Richard Helms in order

{ to make his opposition to assassinating Lumumba a matter of

record (6' bonnel) 9/11/75, pp. 44-45):

{I]n the Agency, since you don't have
documents, you have to be awfully canny
and you have to get things on record, and
I went into Mr. Helms' office, and I
said, Dick, here is what Mr. Bissell
proposed to me, and I told him that I
would under no conditions do it, and Helms
said you're absolutely right. (O'Donnel),
6/9/75, pp. 15-16). }

Richard Helms testified that it was “likely” that he had such a

conversation with fo'Donnet} and he assumed that (0’Donne1i)'s version
. . é

of their conversation was correct (Helms, 9/16/75, pp. 22-23) .*

William Harvey testified that 6 Donne?) had informed him

about the conversations with Bissell:

( ,
— Mr. 0'Donnel1) came to me and said that he
had‘been approached by Richard Bissell ...
to undertake an operation in the Congo, one
of the objectives of which was the elimina-
Cion of Patrice Lumumba. He also told me
that he had declined to undertake this
assignment, (Harvey, 6/25/75, p. 9.)
Harvey said that in a later conversation with Bissell, Bissell told
him that he had asked (0'Donnel1) to undertake such an operation
(Harvey, 6/25/75, p. 9).

cussion with Bissell, he departed for the congo JO" Bonnett, |9/11/75,;

* Helms testified that he did not fo low-up on this conversa-

; tion in any way. He did not recall why (O'Donnell) had gone to the
ie Congo or what his mission was (Nelms, 9/16/75, pp. 32-33).

(iii) Bissell Testified That he Asked (0'Donnelt) to Plan
and Prepare for an Assassination Operation

_ Bissell remembered "very clearly" that he and 0 'DonneL1)
discussed the assassination of Lumumba in the fall of 1960 (Bissell,
6/9/75, p. 75) and that Q'Donnel}) reacted negatively (Bissell,
9/11/75, p. 18). According’ to Bissell, 6 ‘Donnet1 said that he
thought that assassination “was an inappropriate action and that
the desired object could be accomplished better in other ways"
(Bissell, 6/11/75, p. 54).

Bissell also confirmed the fact that he had asked

6"Donnet to see {Sidney Gottlieb. (Bissell, 9/10/75, p. 44).
if ] \ :

Bissell differs with (©'Donnelt)'s account on only one
important point -- the degree to which Bissell's initial assign-
ment to (0'Donne1i) contemplated the mounting of an operation as
opposed to contingency planning. ('Donnett) flatly testified that
Bissell requested him to attempt to kill Lumumba. In his first
testimony on the subject, ‘Bissell said that he asked 6'ponne11\
“to investigate the possibility of killing Lumumba" (Bissell,
6/11/75, p. 54; see also pp. 33, 75). In a later appearance,
however, Bissell stated that P’Donne11) “had been asked to plan
and prepare for" the assassination of Lumumba (Bissell, 9/10/75,
p. 24),

Bissell said that after his conversations with lo*donne11), he
felt that it would be necessary to "postpone" the assassination

operation because, “given (0'bonneti}'s reaction, there was a risk

HW 50955 Dockd:32202487 Page 58 . -


-60+

é that the planning of such an operation would be blown" (Bissell,
9/10/75, p. 25). Despite his impression that he might have de-
activated assassination operations against Lumumba at that time,

Bissell could not preclude the possibility that the Hedgman/

(cobb1ieb\ poison plot continued to move foward:

\

{T]his had been in my mind a very sensitive
assignment to him, limited -- with the
knowledge of it limited very narrowly even
within the Agency. And it is difficult to
separate recollection from inference on
occasion, But I seem to recollect that
after this conversation with him, I wanted
this put very much on the back burner and
inactivated for quite some time, Wow that
doesn't rule out the possibility that some
action through completely different channels
might have gone forward. But the best of
my recollection is, I viewed this not only
. as terminating the assignment for him, but

‘a also as reason for at least postponing any-

Neste thing further along that line. (Bissell,
9/10/75, pp. 25-26).

In Tweedy's mind, (e*Donnett)’s eventual mission to the Congo was
linked to assessing the possibility for assassinating Lumumba

rather than to a general plan to draw Lumumba out of UN custody

(Tweedy, 9/9/75, p. 26).

(iv) (O'Donnell) Arrived in the Congo and Learned That
a Virus Was In the Station Safe

On October 29, the Chiet of Station was ‘informed through **-"*:
the PROP channel that (Justin 0'Donnel}) was soon. to arrive in Leo-
poldville “IN FURTHERANCE THIS PROJECT" (CIA Cable our 86798) Fields)

- to (chiet of) Station, 10/29/60) . On November 3, (0'Donnei}) arrived

in Leopoldville (CIA Cable fe 38053), Leopoldville to Director,
11/4/60). (Chief of) Station Hedgman testified that he had been

made aware by cable that (0"Donnell) was coming to the Congo

(Hedgman, 8/21/75, p. 49). Hedgman said it was "very possible"
that as a new Chief of) Station he took the dispatch to the Congo

of a senior officer Like (0'Donneli) as a signal that CIA headquarters
was "dissatisfied with my handling" of Gerelied)'s instructions
(ledgman, 8/21/75, p. 42). ;

Hedgman had a general picture of (0'Donnel})'s mission:

I understood it to be that -- similar to
mine, that is, the removal or neutrali-
zation of Lumumba... I have no clear

recollection of his discussing the assassi-
nation. (ledgman, 8/21/75, p. 54.)

Hedgman said that he had no recollection of ©'Donnel}) indicating
one way or the other whether he was considering assassination as
a means of "neutralizing" Lumumba (Hedgman, 8/21/75, p. 55).
Hedgman said, “in view of my instructions, I may have assumed that
he was" considering assassination (Hedgman, 8/21/75, p. 55). Gen-
erally, however, Hedgman perceived Q*Donne1} as being unenthusiastic
about his mission (Hedgman, 8/21/75, pp. 56, 88-89).

tren (0° Ponnet) arrived in the Congo, he met with the (cies of)
Station, who informed him that there was “a virus in the safe"
(@'Donnelll, 9/11/75, p. 7-A; 6/9/75, p. 16). (o" Donnell said he
assumed it was a “lethal agent" cd Donnell, 6/9/75, p. 37), although

Hedgman was not explicit:

I knew it wasn't fox somebody to get his polio
shot up to date. @ Donnell), 6/9/75, p. 16.)

.

HW 50955 DocId:32202487 Page 60


-~62-

He added that if the virus was to be used for medical purposes,
"it would have been in the custody of the State Department"
personnel, not the CIA station (@' Donnell), 6/9/75, p. 36).
(0'Donneti) said that he did not recall that Hedgman mentioned
the source of the virus (O'Donnel), 9/11/75, Pp. 8).* But (0'Donne12)
assumed that it had come from(Sidtiey Gottliei)'s office:
Tt would have had to have come from Washington,
in my estimation, and I would think, since it
had been discussed with Gottlie} that it
probably would have emanated’from his office.
@'DonnelL, 6/9/75, p. 28.) .
Hedgman did not recall discussing GottLied)'s trip to the Congo
with @'Donnely), but “assumed" that he did ‘so (Hedgman, 8/21/75,
pp. 60-61).
@'Donnet i was "certain" that the virus had arrived before he
did (@'Donneit) 6/9/75, p. 24). He was surprised to learn that
such a virus was being held at the Leopoldville station because
he had refused an assassination mission before departing for the
Congo (P'Donnelt), 6/9/75, p. 17).
(o'Donnell) stated that he knew of no other instance where a
lethal biological substance was in the possession of a CIA station
(6*Donnely, 9/11/75, p. 50). He assumed that its purpose was

assassination:

*

* When fo'Donfiell|was informed about Hedgman's testimony on
the visit of (Gottlieb) to the Congo and the plot to ppison Lumumba,
he said, "I believ, absolutely in its credibility” (O'Donnel D
9/11/75, p. 53). O'Donnell) found nothing in the facts as he knew
them, nor in Hedgman's character to raise a question about that
testimony. (O'Donnell) regarded Hedgman as “an honest and a decent
man" (O'Donnel), 9/11/75, p. 19) -- "a totally truthful man"

(O'Donnel), 9/11/75 p. 56).

MW 50955 QO Ponned 487" Page 61 .



-63-

My feeling definitely is that it was for a
€ specific purpose, and was just not an all-
Sess purpose capability there begin held for tar-

gets of opportunity, unspecified targets,

(0 ‘Donne 9/11/75, p. 49.)

At several points, (0'Donne1}) stated that he did not think that
Lumumba was the target specified for the use of the virus (0'Donnelt)
6/9/75, p. 17; 9/11/75, p. 48). But he allowed for that possibility:
I supposed it was for a lethal operation, very
possibly Lumumba, but very. possibly in connec-
tion with other people. €©'Donnell), 6/9/75,
p. 24; accord. 6/9/75, p. 17.)
His final word on the subject was that he assumed that the “specific
f
purpose" of the virus was the assassination of Lumumba (O'Donnell)

9/11/75, p. 50).

(0'Ponnets) said that the (niet of\ Station never indicated that

" @'Donnelt\was to employ the virus (O'Donnell, 9/11/75, p. 52). In
fact, (0'Ponnet1} testified that Hedgman “never discussed his assassi-
nation effort, ‘he never even indicated that this was one.” Donne),
9/11/75, p. 54.) :

While Hedgman has no direct recollection of discussing his
assassination operation with-(0'Donne11), he “assumed" that he had
at least discussed with (o'Donne1) the problem of gaining access to
Lumumba for the purpose of assassinating him (Hedgman, 8/21/75,
pp. 55, 60), ("onne11) testified, however, that because he was

“morally opposed to assassination" he would “absolutely not" have

explored the means by which such access could be gained, nor would
he have undertaken a mission to the Congo if it involved assess-
ment of the situation for an assassination operation by someone
else (0 Donnell), GALL/75, p. 26).
(o'Donneti) was “sure” that he "related everything" to Uedgman
about his conversations with Bissell concerning the assassination .

/ . .
of Lumumba (O'Donnell, 9/11/75, p. 46). Hedgman, however, had no

recollection of learning this from (‘Donnet) (liedgman, 8/21/75,
p. 56).
Beyond this, 6‘Donnet1) said that his discussions of assassi-

nation with Hedgman were general and nhilosophical, dealing with

“the morality of assassinations" © Donner) 9/11/75, pp. 46, 54):

C From my point of view I told him I had

Naar moral objections to it, not just qualms,
but objections. I didn't think it, was
the right thing to do. (O'Donnel),
9/11/75, p. 9). :

When asked to characterize Hedgman's attitude toward assassination

based on those discussions, (0"DonneLy) said:

I will answer your question just as fairly
and as scrupulously as I-can. I have a
great deal of respect for Hedeman. And if
he said something, L would believe him to
be speaking the truth as he knew it without
shading it.... The best I could say, I.
think, would be this, that he would not have
been opposed in principle to assassination in.
the interests of national security.... I
know that he is a man of preat moral per-
ception and decency and honor, and so forth.
~ And that it would disturb him to be engaged in

something like that. But I think I would
have to say that in our conversations, my
memory of those, at no time would he rule it ~

f out as being a possibility. (O'Donnel2}

- (v) (0 Donne) Planned to "Neutralize" Lumumba by Turning
( Wim Over ‘to Congolesé Authorities and Requested the
Assignment of Agent OIWIW to Leopoldville as His
Alter Ego
After Gustin 0'Donnel1) arrived in the Congo, he formu-

lated a plan for "neutralizing" Lumumba by drawing him away from

the custody of the UN force which was guarding his residence:

(0' Donne) (W]hat I wanted to do was to
get him out, to trick him out, if I could,
and then turn him over .., to the- legal
authorities and let him stand trial. Be-

cause he had atrocity attributed to him for
which he could very well stand trial.

Q: And for which he could very well have
received capital punishment?

(o:ponneit Yes. And ZT am not opposed to
\€apital punishment, (@'Donnely, 9/11/75,
pp. 20-21.)* 4 :

To implement his plan, b:Donne1}) made arrangements to rent ‘an ob-

servation post over the palace in which Lumumba was safely ensconced"

* According to an earlier report from the Gries of} Station, it
was the view of the Special Representative of the Secretary General
of the United Nations that arrest by Congolese authorities was "JUST
A TRICK TO ASSASSINATE LUMUMBA" (CIA Cable Leop L (Chief
of) Station to Director, 10/11/60). The (Chief of) Station proceeded
to recommend Lumumba's arrest in the same cable:’ .

attempt to lure Lumumba outside UW protective custody Donne),
6/9/75, p. 20; 9/11/75, p. 21). .
(o'Donne1) said that he cabled progress reports on his plan to

CIA headquarters ('Donnety, 9/11/75, p. 26). lie also said that

Va
he informed the (chiet of Station about his plan (®'Donaet}), 9/11/75,
p. 56). ; —

In connection with his effort to draw Lumumba out of UN cus-
tody, fo*Donne11 arranged for a CIA agent, whose code name was
QJWIN, to come te the Conge to work with him (© 'Donne11), 9/11/75,
p. 19):

What I wanted to use him for was

counter-espionage[.]... I had to screen

the U.S. participation in this ..; by

using a foreign national whom we knew,

trusted, and had worked with ... the

idea was for me to use him as an alter

ego. (0'Donnell) Tr., pp. 19-20.) ~
In mid-November, two cables from Leopoldville urged CIA head-

f

quarters to send QJWIN as soon as possible (CIA Cable [N 41261,
Leopoldville to Director, 11/11/60) with this message:

LOCAL OPERATIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES REQUIRE

IMMEDIATE EXPEDITION OF QJWIN TRAVEL TO

LEOPOLDVEILLE. (CIA Cable IN 41556),
Leopoldville to Director, 11/13/60.)

* A cable from the (Chief of] Station to Tweedy in mid-November
reported that the double guard of United Nations and Congolese
troops around Lumumba's residence thwarted this plan: “CONCENTRIC
RINGS OF DEFENSE MAKE ESTABLISHMENT OF OBSERVATION POST IMPOSSIBLE"
(CIA Cable (In 42478), (Chief of] Station to Tweedy, 11/14/60).

The cables contained no exploration of this sense of urgency about
the "operational circumstances."

(b) Agent QJIWIN's Mission in the Congo: November-December

QIWIN was a foreign citizen with a criminal background,

recruited in Europe (Memorandum to CIA Finance Division, Re:

Payments to QJWIN, 1/31/61), and supervised by CIA officer é
In November 1960, at(0' Donnett}'s request ('Donnel)), 6/3/75,
3. :

p. 19), agent QJWIN was dispatched to the Congo by (BEBE to under-

take a mission that "might involve a large element of personal risk."
(CIA Cable/IN 36814, 11/2/60,)*

\ “

A dispatch from the CIA headquarters on his pending trip

to Africa made clear the high degree of sensitivity accorded to

C his mission:

In view of the extreme sensitivity of the ob-
jective for which we want him to perform his
task, he was not told precisely what we want
him to do.... Instead, he was told ... that
we would like to have him Spot, assess, and
recommend some dependable, quick-witted
persons for our use.... It was thought best
to withhold our true, specific requirements
pending the fi cision to use [him].

(CIA Dispatch, & 147, 11/2/60.)

22

* Part of the purpose in dispatching QJWIN to Africa was to
send him from the Congo to another African country for an unspeci-
fied mission, QJWIW's mission to this country is not explained
in the cable traffic between CIA headquarters and the various sta-
tions that dealt with him. oo

~ There is no indication in CIA files as to whether QJWIN com-
pleted this mission, (0' Donnell) said he had no knowledge of any
mission that would have taken QJWIN to this country ( “Donnell}
- 9/11/75, pp. 32-33). \, :

This message itself was deemed too sensitive to be retained
at the station: "this dispatch should be reduced to cryptic
necessary notes and destroyed after the first reading.” (CIA
Dispatch, Qe 147, 11/2/60.)

QJWIi arrived in Leopoldville on November 21, 1960 (CIA Cable
ftw 49436) 11/29/60) and returned to Europe in late December 1960
(CIA Cable (ur 54710), Director to Leopoldville, 12/9/60).

The CIA Inspector General's Report said that QJWIN

,

2
had been recruited earlier by Gamma)
for use in a special operatio nm the Congo

[the y(dastin 0'Bo of Patrice Lumumba] to be

run by/Justin O'Donnel i}. (1.G. Report, p. 38.)

However, both (O'Donnell) and Bissell testified that (0'Donnel)) re-
fused to be associated with an assassination operation.* Instead,
(0'Donnei1) said he went to the Congo to attempt to snatch Lumumba
from the protective custody of the ULM. guard and place him in
the hands of the Congolese army. @'donnelt), 6/9/75, pp. 13-14,
37.) ,

According to (bonnet), QJWIN was a man who was capable of

undertaking an assassination mission:

(o'Donnel!: .-. I would say that he would not
‘bé a man of many scruples.

Q: So he was a man capable of doing anything?
('domnel i: I would think so, yes.

C But (0 Donne1}) had no knowledge that QUWIH was ever used for an
: assassination mission (bonne), 9/11/75, pp. 36, 42).
(0'Donnie11) said that, as far as he knew, he was the only CIA
officer with supervisory responsibility for QJWIN and QJWIN did
not report independentiy to anyone else @'Donnety), 9/L1/75, p. 28).
When asked if it was possible that QJWIN had a mission independent
of that he was performing for 6'bennelt), he said: ;
Goasanet Seg thE settle = or
him after he got down there, that they
wanted him to do something along the lines
of assassination. I don't know. (0' Donnell),
9/11/75, p. 29.) \
But he discounted this possibility as "highly unlikely" because it
ra would be a departure from standard CIA practice -- placing an agent
ina position of knowledge superior to that of his supervising -
officer (6'Donner, 9/11/75, p. 29).

Despite 0'Donnel}'s doubt that QJWIN had an independent line
of responsibility to the Chiet of) Station, a cable of November 29
shows that Hedgman was aware of WIN's activities.

In that cable, the (Chief of) Station reported through the PROP
channel to Tweedy that QJWIN had begun implementation of a plan to
"PIERCE BOTH CONGOLESE AND UN GUARDS" to enter Lumumba's residence
(Chief
of) Station to Tweedy, 11/29/60). (o"Donnelt) said that he had directed

(Q' Donnell; 9/11/75, p. 21). But Lumumba had left uN custody at
this point to travel toward his stronghold at Stanleyville, This
did not deter QJWIN:

it is unclear whether this latter "plan" contemplated assassina-
tion as well as abduction. An affirmative reply from headquarters
came through the PROP channel the next day which was also suscep-
tible of interpretation as an assassination order:

December shortly after Lumumba was captured by the Congolese army.
In a memorandum to arrange the accounting for QJWIN's activities
in the Congo, William K. Harvey -- under whom 6'Donnet}) had worked
” before being detached for assignment to the Congo -- noted the

success of QJWIN's mission: "QJWIN was sent on this trip for a

C specific, highly sensitive operational purpose which has been
completed" (Memorandum for Finance Division from William K. Harvey,
1/11/61). (0'Donneti) explained Harvey's reference to the fact that
QJWIN's mission had been "completed" by saying that once Lumumba
was in the hands of the Congolese authorities "the reason for
the mounting of the project ... had become moot" (p'DonneLt),
9/11/75, p. 35). When asked if he and QJWIN were responsible for
Lumumba's departure from UN custody and subsequent capture, (O'Donnell
said: “Absolutely not" @ DonnelY, 9/11/75, p. 35). Harvey did not
recall’ the neaning of the nenorandun, but he assumed that (o" Donnelly s
return from the Congo constituted the "completion" of QJWIN's
mission (Harvey, affidavit, p. ).

Despite the indication in the Inspector General's Report that

Nose QJIWIN may have been recruited ‘initially for an assassination mission
and the suggestive language of the cables at the end of November ,
there is no clear evidence that QUWIM was actually involved in any
assassination plan or attempt, The CIA officers who were involved
in or knowledgeable of an assassination plot against Lumumba gave

_ ne testimony that tended to show that QJWIN was related to that plot.
The (niet of \Station Rea a "vague recollection" that QUWIN
was in the Congo working for Gustin o' Donnell), (Hedgman, 8/21/75
p. 95.) But Hedgman did not recall why QJWIN was in the Congo.
(Hedgman, 8/21/75, p. 95.) QJWIN was not a major operative of
Hedgman's. (Hedgman, 8/21/75, p. 95.) Richard Bissell and Bronson

Tweedy did not recall anything about QJWIN's mission in the Congo

(Bissell, 9/10/75, pp. 54-57; Tweedy, 9/9/75, pp. 54, 61).
William Harvey, from whose division QJIWIN was on loan for
his Congo assignment, had no specific knowledge of WIN's activities

in the Congo:

I was kept informed of the arrangements for
QJWIN's trip to the Congo and, subsequently,
of his presence in the Congo. I do not know
specifically what QJWIN did in the Congo. . I
do not think that I ever had such knowledge... .
T£ QJWIN were to be used on an assassination -
mission, it would have been cleared with me.

I was never informed that he was to be used
for such a mission. (Harvey affidavit, p. )

Oo
He stated chat (EERENS EE) prob abiy wrote the memoranda con-

cerning QJWIN and submitted them for HARVEY's signature (larvey
affidavit, p. >.

(c) QJWIN's Connection to Project ZRRIFLE

After leaving the Congo in early 1961, QJWIN was used by
CIA officer William Harvey as the principal asset in Project ZRRIFLE,
a project which included research into a capability to assassinate
foreign Leaders.* QJWIN's role in Projéct ZRRIFLE was to "SPOT"
figures of the European underworld who could be utilized as agents
by the CIA if required. Harvey stated that before the formation
of Project ZRRIFLE:

infra; on the "Executive Action Capability."

CEREUS eer had not previously used .

SJWIN as an assassination capability or

even viewed him as such. (Harvey affi-

davit, p. )
Although Harvey also had discussions with (Sidney Gottlieb) in connec-
tion with Project ZRRIFLE, he believed that Gottlied) never mentioned
to him either QJWIN's activities in the Congo or Gottlied)'s own
trip to Leopoldville (Harvey affidavit, p. ). Harvey had con-~
sulted with GigcveMESaem about the initiation of Project ZRRIFLE
(Harvey, 6/25/75, p. 52).

The Chief of) Station in Leopoldville testified that he had
never heard of Project ZRRIFLE, nor was he aware of any CIA project
to develop the capabilicy of assassinating foreign leaders.
(Hedgman, 8/21/75, p. 93.) Furthermore, Hedgman said that he was
“quite certain” that he never discussed assassination capabilities
or assets with Harvey at any time. (Hedgman, 8/21/75, p. 95.)

Hedgman testified tharé pcame to, the Congo on a counter-

intelligence mission during his tenure, but they did not discuss
the plan to assassinate Lumumba. (Hedgman, 8/21/75, p. 92.)

An interesting note on the value accorded QaWiN by the CIA.
and the inherent predicament for an intelligence agency that employs
hoodlums is found in a ‘cable from CIA headquarters co Genesio)
in 1962, The CIA had learned that QJWIN was about to go on trial
in Europe on smuggling charges. The cable suggested:

IF ... INFOR TRUE WE MAY WISI ATTEMPT QUASIL

~The

(d) Agent QJWIN Was Asked By Hedeman's Operative WIROGUE
to Join “an “Execution Squa 1 becember 1960

The one incident where there is an explicit reference to
assassination in connection with QUWIN involved his contact with
WIROGUE, another asset of the Congo station. .

WIROGUE was an "essentially stateless" European) whe was

"a forger and former bank robber" ona had‘ fought with the French
Foreign Legion (Inspector General Memorandum, 3/14/75.) He was
sent to che Congo after being given plastic surgery and a toupee
by the CIA so that he would not be recognized by Europeans traveling
through the Congo. (1.G, Memorandum, 3/14/75.) WIROGUE was
assessed by the CIA as a man who "LEARNS QUICKLY AND CARRIES OUT
ANY ASSIGNMENT WITHOUT REGARD FOR DANGER" (CIA Cable (our 86554
Africa Division to Leopoldville, 10/27/60). : :

the Chief of} Station described WIROGE as "a man with a
rather unsavory reputation, who would try anything once, at least."
(Hedgman, 8/21/75, p. 96.) Hedgman used him as "a general utility
agent" because "I felt we needed surveillance capability, develop-
ing new contacts, various things." (Hedgman, 8/21/75, p. 96.)
Hedgman supervised WIROGUE directly. and did not put WIROGUE in
touch with Justin O'Donnel}. (Hedgman, 8/21/75, p. 97.)

A report on agent WIROGUE, prepared for the CIA Inspector
General's office in 1975, described the training and tasking he

received:

Dockd:32202487 Page 73 . : a

!

( On 19 September 1960 two members of Africa
. Division met with him to discuss “an opera-

tional assignment in Africa Division.” ~

connection with this assignment, WIROG /l 4

was to be trained in demolitions, small “artis,

and medical immunization.... In October 1960

a cable to Leopoldville stated that ...

Headquarters [had] ... intent to use him as

utility agent in order to "(a) organize and

conduct a surveillance team; (b) intercept

packages; (c) blow up bridges; and (d) execute -

other assignments requiring positive action.

His utilization is not to be restricted to

Leopoldville." (I.G. Memorandu, 3/14/75.)

WIROGUE made his initial contact with Hedgman in Leopoldville on
December 2, 1960 (CIA Cable (x 18739), 12/17/60). He was given two
instructions by Hedgman: (1) to "build cover during initial period,"
and (2) to "spot persons for [a] surveillance team" of intelligence _

assets in the province where Lumumba's support was strongest. (CIA

Cable an 18739) 12/17/60.)

Soon after receiving these instructions, agent WIROGUE approached
QJWIN and asked him to join an "execution squad." This incident is
described by Leopoldville (chies of} Station Hedgman in a cable to
CIA headquarters (Hedgman, 8/21/75, p. 99):

WIN WHO RESIDES SAME HOTEL AS WIROGUE REPORTED |

-76-

( The cable also expressed Hedgman's concern about WIROGUE's

actions:

. LEOP CONCERNED BY WIROGUE FREE WHEELING
AND LACK SECURITY. STATION HAS ENOUGH HEAD-
ACHES WITHOUT WORRYING ABOUT AGENT WHO UOT
ABLE HAUDLE FINANCES AND WHO NOT WILLING
FOLLOW INSTRUCTIONS. IF HQs DESIRES, WILLING
KEEP HIM ON PROBATION, BUT IF CONTINUE HAVE
DIFFICULTIES, BELIEVE WIROGUE RECALL BEST
SOLUTION. (CIA Cable, Leopoldville to Director,

12/17/60.)

WIROGUE's attempt to recruit QJWIN for an execution squad is
explained by Hedgman as a mistake and by the actions of QJWIN as
an unauthorized, unexpected contact which he did not initiate.

The Chief of) Station testified that he had not instructed
WIROGUE to make this kind of proposition to QJWIN or anyone else.

C. (Hedgman, 8/21/75, p. 100.) He added:
I would like to stress that I don't know what
WIROGUE was talking about as a{n] “execution
squad," and I am sure he was never tasked to

go out and execute anyone. (iledgman, 8/21/75,
p. 100.)

Hedgman suggested that WIROGUE may have concocted the idea of an

execution squad:

His idea of what an intelligence operative
should do, I chink, had been gathered by
reading a few novels or something of the
sort. (Hedgman, 8/21/75, p, 100.)

Gustin 0'Donne11) had no knowledge of an attempt by anyone

connected to the CIA to recruit an execution squad and no recollec-

tion of WIROGUE bonnet) 9/11/75; pp: 39-42). (0'Donne1? men-
tioned that agent QJWIN was considered for use on a “strong arm
squad," but’ said that this was for purposes more general than

. + )
assassinations:

surveillance teams where you have to go
into crime areas ... where you need a
fellow that if he gets in a box can fight
his way out of it. (O'donnel t 9/11/75,
p. 36).

Richard Bissell recalled nothing of the WIROUGE approach to
QUWIN (Bissell, 9/11/75, p. 71). Bronson Tweedy did recall that
WIROGUE was ‘dispatched on a general purpose mission" to the Congo
(Tweedy, 9/9/75, p. 63). But Tweedy testified that WIROGUE would
“absolutely not" have been used on an assassination mission against
Lumumba because “he was basically dispatched, assessed and dealt
with by the balance of the Division" rather than by the two people
in the Africa Division -- Tweedy himself and his deputy Glenn
Fields =} who would have known that the assassination of Lumumba
was being considered (Tweedy, 9/9/75, pp. 64-65).

The (hice of Station said that if the WIRQGUE incident was
connected to an actual assassination plan, he would have transmitted
a message in a more narrowly restricted channel than that in which
this cable was sent. His cable on WIROGUE's approach to QJWIN was
sent to headquarters with a security designation that allowed much
wider distribution than the PROP cables that he sent and received
concerning the Gottriey) assassination assignment. (Hedgman, 8/21/75,

p. 102.) In contrast, he limited distribution of the cable about

Dockd:32202487 Page 76 . -

ca

-78-

WIROGUE only as a CIA officer would “normally do ... when you
speak in a derogatory manner of an asset." (Hedgman, 8/21/75,
p. LOL)

The Chief of)Station maintained that WIROGUE's proposition
to QUWIN to join an "execution squad" could be attributed to

WIROGUE's "freewheeling" nature. Hedgman said:

T had difficulty controlling him in that he
was not a professional intelligence officer
as such. ile seemed to act on his ow without
seeking guidance or authority ... I found

he was rather an unguided missile ... the
kind of man that could get you in trouble be-
fore you knew you were in trouble.,..
(Hedgman, 8/21/75, pp. 96-97).

But Hedgman did not disavow all responsibility for WIROGUE's actions:

(I}£ you give a man an order and he carries it
out and causes a problem for the Station, why
then as (Chiet of) Station, well, you accept
responsibility.“ (Hedgman, 8/21/75, p. 97.)

In sum, the nies of) Station testified that despite the fact
chat the CIA was interested in the assassination of Lumumba during
this period, agent WLROGUE's attempt to form an “execution squad"

was an unauthorized, maverick action, unconnected to the CIA. assassi-

nation plan.

Nonetheless, the fact that WLROCUE was to be trained in "medical
immunization" (1.G, Memorandum, 3/14/75) raises the possibility
that he was connected to the plot to assassinate Lumumba by means

of lethal biological substances. The 1975 report on WIROGUE's case

HW 50955 Dockd:32202487 Page 77 -.


-79~

( by the Inspector General's office leaves this question open. The
: report concludes with the statement that "WIROCUE/1 spent most of
his time trying to develop contacts and was not directly involved
in any particular operation." (1.6. Memorandum, 3/14/75.) But,
when the report was circulated in the Inspector General's office,
the following comment was handwritten by Scott Breckinridge, one -

of the principal authors of the 1967 report on CIA involvement in

assassination attempts: "'ROGUE's pitch is too clear to be dis-
carded out of hand as ‘exceeding instructions. '" (I.G. Memorandum,
3/14/75)

6. The Question of Whether the CIA Was Involved in Bringing
About Lumumba "s Death in Katanga

There is no direct evidence of CIA involvement in bring-

ing about Lumumba's death in Katanga. The CIA officers most closely

connected to the plot to poison Lumumba testified uniformly that

they knew of no CIA involvement in Lumumba's death.

(a) Lumumba's Escape from UN Custody, Capture b
Congolese Army, and Ymprisonment at Thysvilte:
November 27-December 3, 1960

The strongest hint that the CIA may have been involved

in the capture of Lumumba by Mobutu's troops after his departure
from UN custody on November 27, was contained in a PROP cable from’
the Cnies of) Station to Tweedy on November 14 (CIA Cable IN 42478,
Chiet of) Station to Tweedy, 11/14/60). In the cable, Hedeman re-
ported that an’agent of his had learned that Lumumba's

POLITICAL FOLLOWERS IN STANLEYVILLE DESIRE THAT

HE BREAK QUT OF HIS CONFINEMENT AND PROCEED TO

THAT CITY BY CAR TO ENGAGE IN POLITICAL ACTIVITY.
(CIA Cable, 11/14/60.)

HW 50955 Dockd:32202487 Page 78


-80-

C

The chief of) Station was confident that he would have foreknowledge
of Lumumba's departure and that action plans were prepared for that
eventuality:
DECISION Oi] BREAKOUT WILL PROBABLY BE MADE
SHORTLY. STATION EXPECTS TO BE ADVISED BY
{AGENT] OF DECISION WHEN MADE.... STATION
HAS SEVERAL POSSIBLE ASSETS TO USE IN EVENT -
OF BREAXOUT AND STUDYING SEVERAL PLANS OF
ACTION. (CIA Cable, 11/14/60.)

There is no other evidence, however, that the CIA actually
gained prior knowledge of Lumumba's plan to depart for Stanleyville.
In facet, a cable from Leopoldville on the day after Lumumba's
escape betrays the station's complete ignorance about the circum-

\
stances of Lumumba's departure (CIA Cable (Ii! 48484, Leopoidville
- to Director, 11/28/60). ‘

But the same cable raises at least a question as to whether
the CIA was involved in the capture of Lumumba enroute by Congolese
troops:

[STATION] WORKING WITH [CONGOLESE GOVERNMENT]
TO GET ROADS BLOCKED AND TROOPS ALERTED .
[BLOCK] POSSIBLE ESCAPE ROUTE. (CIA Cable,
11/28/60.) .

A cable of December 2 reporting Lumumba's capture militates
against CIA involvement, however, because it portrays the Congolese
forces as the source of the station's information (CIA Cable fan 10643),
Leopsidville to Director, 12/3/60).

The (niet of) Station testified that he was "quite certain that

there was no Agency involvement in any way" in Lumumba's departure

HW 50955 Docld:32202487 Page 79 -


NW 50955 Docid:32202467 Page 80

from Ui custody and that he had no foreknowledge of Lumumba's
plan (Hedgman, 8/21/75, pp. 63-64). He stated that he consulted
with Congolese officers about the possible routes Lumumba mighe
take to Stanleyville, but he was "not a major assistance" in track-
ing down Lumumba prior to his capture (lledgman, 8/21/75, p. 65).
Despite the fact that (0"Donnel) had planned to draw Lumumba
out of UN custody and turn him over to Congolese authorities, he
insisted that Lumumba escaped by his own devices and was not tricked
by the CIA cf Donnety) 9/11/75, p. 22).

(b) Transfer of Lumumba to Katanga Where He Was Killed;
January T77” 1960

The contemporaneous cable traffic shows that the CIA was

kept informed of Lumumba's condition and movements in January of
1961 by the Congolese and that the CIA still considered Lumumba
a serious political threat. But there is no direct evidence of

CIA involvement in bringing about Lumumba's death in Katanga.

* Excerpts from cable traffic of January 1961 and from the
testimony of CIA officers Hedgman, Tweedy, O'Donnell,) and Helms
(investigative report) should be inserted.

Group
agreed that planning for the Congo would not necessarily
rule out "consideration" of any particular kind of ac-
tivity which might contribute to getting rid of Lumumba.
(Minutes of Special Group Meeting, 25 August 1960)
The next day CIA Director Allen Dulles, who had attended the Special
Group meeting, personally cabled to the (hiet of) Station in Leopold-
ville that Lumumba's "REMOVAL MUST BE AN URGENT AND PRIME OBJECTIVE
. A HIGH PRIORITY OF OUR COVERT ACTION" (CIA Cable bur 62966)
Dulles to Leopoldville, 8/26/60). Dulles added: "YOU .CAN ACT ON
YOUR OWN AUTHORITY WHERE TIME DOES NOT PERMIT REFERRAL HERE."
Although the Dulles cable does not explicitly mention assassina-

tion, Richard Bissell -- the CIA official under whose aegis the as-

sassination effort against Lumumba took place -- testified that, in

his opinion, this cable was a direct outgrowth of the Special Group
meeting and signaled to him that the President had authorized assas-
sination as one means of removing Lumumba (Bissell, 9/10/75, pp. 33-
34, 61-62; see Section 7(c), imfra). Bronson Tweedy, who bore the
primary administrative responsibility for activities against Lumumba,
testified that the Dulles cable confirmed the policy that no measure,
including assassination, was to be overlooked in the attempt to re-
move Lumumba from a position of influence (Tweedy, 10/9/75, pp. 4-5).
On September 19, 1960, Bissell and Tweedy cabled the (chiez o£)
Station to expect a messenger from CIA headquarters. Two days later,

in the presence of the President at a meeting of the National Security

HW 50955 Docld:32202487 Page 81


84.

Council, Allen Dulles stated that Lumumba "would remain a grave
danger as long as he was not yet disposed of" (Memorandum, 460th
NSC Meeting, 9/21/60). Five days after this meeting, a CIA scien-
tist arrived in Leopoldville and provided the (niet of) Station
with lethal biclogical substances, instructed him to assassinate
Lumumba, and informed him that ‘the President had authorized this
operation.

Two mitigating factors weaken this chain just enough so that
it will not support an absolute finding of Presidential authoriza-
tion for the assassination effort against Lumumba. :

First, the two officials of the Eisenhower Administration re-
sponsible to the President for national security affairs testified

that they knew of no Presidential approval for, or knowledge of, an

assassination plot.

Second, the minutes of discussions at meetings of the National
Security Council and its Special Group do not record an explicit
Presidential order for the assassination of Lumumba. The Secretary
of the Special Group maintained that his memoranda reflect the ac-
tual language used at the meetings without omission or euphemism
for extremely sensitive statements (Parrott, 7/10/75, pp. 18-19).
NSC staff executives stated, however, that there was a strong pos-
sibility that a statement as sensitive as an assassination order
would have been omitted from the record or handled by means of euphe-

mism. Several high Government officials involved in policy-making

me 7/21/60). Nonetheless, the attitude toward Lumumba even at these
early meetings was vehement:
Mr. Dulles said that in Lumumba we were faced with a
person who was a Castro or worse . . . Mr. Dulles went
on to describe Mr. Lumumba's background which he de-
scribed as "harrowing" . . . It is safe to go on the
assumption that Lumumba has been bought by the Commun-
ists; this also, however, fits with his ow orienta-
tion. (NSC Minutes, 7/21/60)
The President presided over the other two NSC meetings. After look-
ing at the records of those meetings, Johnson was unable to deter-
mine with certainty which one was the meeting at which he heard the
President's statement (Johnson, 9/13/75, p. 16).
However, the chronology of meetings, cables, and events in the
Congo during this period makes it most likely that Johnson's, testi-

mony refers to’the NSC meeting of August 18, 1960.

The meeting of August 18 took place at the beginning of a series
of events that preceded the dispatch of a CIA scientist to Leopold-
ville with poisons for the assassination of Lumumba.* The Septem-

ber 7 meeting took place in the midst of this series of events.

* The major events in the series, each of which is discussed in de-
tail in other sections of the report, may be summarized as follows:
The week following the NSC meeting of August 18, the Special Group
was informed of the President's "extremely strong feelings about the
necessity for very straightforward action” and the Group agreed to
consider “any particular kind of activity which might contribute to
getting rid of Lumumba" (Special Group Minutes, 8/25/60). At this
meeting, DCI Allen Dulles commented that "he had taken the comments
referred to seriously and had every intention of proceeding as vig-
orously as the situation permits" (Special Group Minutes, 8/25/60;
see Section 7(a) (iii), infra). The next day, Dulles se an "Eyes
Only" cable under his personal signature to the/Chief of jstacion in

HW 50955 Dockd:32202467 Page 83


The NSC meeting of August 18, 1960, was held three weeks before
the “quasi-coup" in the Congo -- the dismissal of Lumumba by Kasavubu
-- which Johnson remembers as taking place "not long after" he heard
the President's statement. The only other meeting at which Johnson
could have heard the Statement by the President was held on Septem-
ber 7, two days after this event.

Robert Johnson's memorandum of the meeting of August 18, 1960,

indicates thar Acting Secretary of State C. Douglas Dillon* introduced

AND THAT . THIS SHOULD BE A HIGH PRIORITY OF OUR COVERT ACTION"
{CIA Cable OUT 62966, Dulles to(chice of) Station, 8/26/60). The Dul-
les cable added:

on September 21, 1960, Allen Dulles stressed the danger of
Soviet influence in the Congo. Despite the fact that Lumumba
had been deposed from his position as Premier and was in UN
custody, Dulles continued to regard him as a threat, especially
in light of reports of an impending reconciliation between
Lumumba and the Post-coup Congolese government;
Mobutu appeared to be the effective Power in the
Congo for the monent but Lumumba was-not yet
disposed of and remained a grave danger as long
as he was not disposed of, (NSC Minutes,
9/21/60.)
Three days after this NSC meeting, Allen Dulles sent a

Personal cable to the! Chief of Station)in Leopoldville which
included the following message:
. WE WISH GIVE EVERY POSSIBLE SUPPORT IN ELIMINATING
ow LUMUMBA FROM ANY POSSIBILITY RESUMING GOVERNMENTAL
POSITION OR IF HE FAILS IN LEOP{OLDVILLE] , SETTING
HIMSELF IN STANLEYVILLE OR ELSEWHERE. (CIA Cable,

CIA headquarters, arrived in Leopoldville (CIA Cable (tn 18989,

Station with poisons, instructed him to assassinate Lumumba ,
and assured him that there was Presidential authorization for
this mission (see Sections 4(b)-4(c), upra).
Marion Boggs, NSC Deputy Executive Secretary, who wrote
the memorandum of the discussion of September 21, did not

interpret Dulles’ remark as referring to assassination::.

Other Eisenhower Administration officials who were active
in the Special Group in late 1960--Assistant Secretary of
Defense John N. Irwin II, Undersecretary of State for Political
Affairs Livingston Merchert, and Deputy Secretary of Defense
James Douglas--stated that they did not recall any discussion
about assassinating Lumumba (Irwin affidavir, 9/22/75, pp. 1-2
Merchant atfidavit, 9/8/75, p. L; Douglas affidavit, 9/5/75).

(c) Richard Bissell Testified That, Despite His Lack of

a Specific Recollection, He "Strongiy Inferred”

That the Assassination Effort Against Lumumba Was
Authorized by President Eisenhower and Allen Dulles

Richard Bissell's testimony on the question of high-level
authorization for the effort to assassinate Lumumba is prob-
lematic. Bissell insisted that he had no direct recollection
_ of receiving such-authorization and that all of his testimony

on this subject "has to be described as inference" (Bissell,
9/10/75, p. 48}. Bissell began his testimony on the subject

by asserting that it was on his own initiative that he instructed
(sustin O'Donnell) to plan the assassination of Lumumba (Bissell
6/11/75, pp. 54-55). Nevertheless, Bissell's conclusion--based
on his inferences from the totality of circumstances relating

to the entire assassination effort against Lumumba--was that an
assassination attempt had been authorized at the highest levels.

of the government (Bissell, 9/10/75, pp. 32-33, 47-49, 60-62,
65).

As discussed above, Bissell testified that the minutes
of meetings of the Special Group on August 25, 1960 and the
NSC on September 21, 1960 indicate that assassination was con-
templated at the Presidential level as one acceptable means
of "getting rid of Lumumba" (see Sections 5(a) (44) and $(a) (iii),
supra).
There was "no question", according to Bissell, that the
cable from Allen Dulles to cne(cntes of Station in Leopoldville
on August 26, which called fer Lumumba's removal and authorized
Hedgman to take action without consulting headquarters, was a
direct outgrowth of the Special Group meeting Dulles had
attended the previous day (Bissell, 9/10/75, pp. 31-32). Bissell

was “almost certain" that he had been informed about the Dulles

cable shortly after its transmission (Bissell, 9/10/75, p. 12).
Bissell testified that he assumed that assassination was one of
the means of removing Lumumba from the scene that is contemplated
within the language of Dulles' cable (Bissell, 9/10/75, p. 32):

It is my belief on the basis of the cable drafted

by Allen Dulles that he regarded the action of

the Special Group as authorizing implementation

{of an assassination] if favorable circumstances

presented themselves, if it could be done covertly.

(Bissell, 9/10/75, pp. 64-65.)

Dulles' cable signalled to Bissell that there was Presi-

dential authorization for him to order action to assassinate

Lumumba (Bissell, 9/10/75, pp. 61-62):

Q: Did Mr. Dulles tell you that President Eisenhower
wanted Lumumba killed?

Mr. Bissell: I am sure he didn't.

Q: Did he ever tell you even circumlocutiously
through this kind of cable?

Mr. Bissell: Yes, I think his cable says it in effect.
Bissell, 710/75, P- 33.)

As for discussions with Dulles about the source of autho-
rization for an assassination effort against Lumumba, Bissell
stated:

I think it is probably unlikely that Allen Dulles
would have’ said either the President or President
Eisenhower even to me. 1 think he would have said,
this is authorized in the highest Quarters, and I
would have known what he meant. (Bissell, 9/10/75,
p. 48.)
When asked if he had sufficient authority to move beyond the
wor consideration or planning of assassination to order impLlementa-
tion of a plan, Bissell said, "I Probably did think I had (such]
authority" (Bissell, 9/10/75, pp. 61-62),
When informed about the (hiet of station's testimony
about the instructions he received fron Goee1 el), Bissell said
that despite his absence of a specific recollection:
T would strongly infer in this case that such an
authorization did pass through me, as it were,
if Gid Gottlieb gave that firm instruction to the
StationfChief- (Bissell, 9/10/75, p. 40.)

Bissell said that the DCI would have been the source of this

authorization (Bissell, 9/10/75, p. 46).

HW 50955 Dockd:32202487 Page 88


Bissell did not recall being. informed by (eee es) that
fecetied)nad represented to the(Chiet of) Station that there
was Presidential authorization for the assassination of Lumumba
(Bissell, 9/10/75, P- 46). Bur Bissell said that assuming he
had instructed Gottiier)eo carry poison to the Congo, "there
was no possibility" that he would have issued such an instruc-
tion without authorization from Dulles (Bissell, 9/10/75,

P. 47). Likewise Bissell said he "probably did" tell Gottlieb)
that the mission had the approval of President Eisenhower
(Bissell, 9/10/75, p, 47). This led to Bissell's conelusion
thac if, in fact, the testimony of the( chies of) Station about
(Coreried)s actions is accurate, then Gortlied}'s actions were

fully authorized:

that the President had instructed the DCI to
carry out this mission would not have been beyond
the pale of Mr, Goeciiety's authority at that
point? Bie.

Bissell: No, it would not. (Bissell, 9/10/75,
P- A

Bissell further stated:
Knowing Mr. Gott1ieb) it is literally inconceivable
to me that hé would have acted beyond his instruc-
tions. (Bissell, 9/10/75, p. 41.)
With respect to his assignment to Gusein 0" Donel) to "plan
and prepare for" the assassination of Lumumba (Bissell, 9/10/75,

P. 24) Bissell testified that "it was my own idea to give

-118-

C (0° boner this assignment" (Bissell, 9/10/75, p. 50). But he

said that this specific assignment was made in the context

that an assassination mission against Lumumba already had autho-

rization above the level of DDP (Bissell, 9/10/75, p. 50; see

also pp. 32-33, 47-48, 60-62).

HW 50955 DoclId:32202487 Page 90


that, while he could have created the capability on his own, any
urgings would have come from Bundy or Walt Rostow, In a later
appearance, however, Bissell said he merely informed Bundy of
the capability and that the context was a briefing by him and
not urging by Bundy. Bundy said he received a briefing and
gave no urging, though he raised no objections. Rostow said he
never heard of the project.

William Harvey testified that he was “almost certain"
that on January 25 and 26, 1961, he met with CIA officials Sidney

Gore lied | the new Chief of CIA's Technical Services Division, and
o

OMe) a CLA recruiting officer, to discuss the feasibility
of creating a capability within the Agency for “executive action"

least, had to eT know Bissell already had

Harvey had also testified that, after receiving Bissell's initial in-
structions to establish an executive action capability:

the firse thing I did... was discuss in theoretical
terms with a few officers whom I Crusted quite implicitly
the whole subject of assassination, our possible assets,
our posture, poing back, if you will, even to the funda-

The Inspector General's Report connected CLiven) and YGoutlied| to the
early stages of the executive action Project as follows:

Tt is evident from the testimony of Harvey and, Bisseli that the curn-
over to Harvey of the Roselli contact in November 1961 was discussed
as part of ZRRIFLE (see Section (d), infra). Thus their initial

iscussion of executive accion can, at the least, be dated before
November 1961 and the "25/1" and "26/1" Rotations would have to
refer to January 1961.

bring a CIA officer together with the criminal syndicate (Bissell,
6/11/75, pp. 19-20). Harvey did not recall any mention of the
White House or any higher authority than the DDP in his November
meeting with Bissell (Harvey, T/LL/75, pp. 60-61).

Although Richard Helms was briefed and given
administrative responsibility (as DDP) for Project ZR/RIFLE three
months later, he did not vecall that ZR/RIFLE Was ever contemplated
as a capability to assassinate Castro (Helms, 6/13/75, p. 55).
Asked whether the actual assassination efforts against Castro were
related to ZR/RIFLE (executive action), “Helms testified: “In my
mind those lines never crossed" (Helms, 6/13/75, p. 52). However,
Bissell's testimony leaves more ambiguity: "the contact with the
syndicate which had Castro as its target . . | folded into the
ZR/RIFLE project . . . and they became one" (Bissell, 6/11/75,

Pp. 47). When asked by Senator Baker whether the executive action
“capability + +. for assassination" was “used against Castro",
Bissell replied that it was "in the later Phase", (Bissell, 6/11/75,
P. 47). The instruction from Bissell to Harvey on November 15;
1961, however, Preceded the reactivation of the CIA-syndicate assag-
ination operation against Castro by approximately five months.

of Project ZR/RIFLE in 1961 was restricted to the "spotting" of

There are two factors which may raise a question as
to whether QJ/WIN was being used in an ad hoc capacity to develop
an assassination capability before ZR/RIFLE was formally initiated.
First, there is a similarity in the cast of characters: Harvey,
QJ/WIN, Gare) and \Gorttieb|were connected with the Lumumba matter
and reappear in connection with the subsequent development of
ZR/RIFLE. Second, Bissell informed Harvey that the development of
an assassination capability had already been discussed with
and Gottlieb |before Harvey's assignment to ZR/RIFLE (Harvey, 6/25/75
p. 52; I.G. Report, Pp. 37-38).

Documents indicate that consideration was given within

the CIA to airdropping rifles into the Dominican Republic.
or
At a June 21, 1960, meeting with tof the CIA

Western Hemisphere Division, Ambassador Farland reportedly
suggested possible sites for the drops.
(CIA memo, 6/21/60)

Documents also indicate that a meeting was held
around the end of June 1960 between Assistant Secretary
ef State for Inter-American Affairs Roy R. Rubottom and
Col. J. GC. King, Chief of CIA's Western Hemisphere Division.
Apparently King sought to learn the Assistant Secretary's view
regarding “To what extent will the u.s. government participate
in the overthrow of Trujillo.” A number of questions were
raised by King, among them:

"co. would it provide a small number of sniper rifles

or other devices for the removal of key Trujillo people

from the scene?"
King's handwritten notes indicate that Rubottom's response to
that question was "yes" (CIA memo of 6/28/60; King affidavits

On July 1, 1960, a memorandum directed to General Cabell, the Acting

Director of Central Intelligence, was prepared for Colonel King's
signature and, in his absence, signed by his principal deputy,
[Ruay Gomez \(I.G. Report, P. 26). Whe memorandum stated that
a principal leader of the anti-Trujillo opposition had asked
Ambassador Farland for a limited number of arms to precipitate

Trujillo's overthrow, and recognized that such aris

Trujillo government could be successful unless it involved
Trujillo's assassination.

He communicated this opinion to both the State Department and
the CIA. In July 1960, he advised Assistant Secretary Rubottom
that the dissidents were

activity in the foreseeable future except the
assassination of their Principal enemy."
{Dearborn to Rubottam letter, 7/14/60
Te is uncertain what portion of the information provided
by Dearborn to State was Passed above the Assistant Secretary
level. Through August of 1960, only Assistant Secretary Rubottom,
his Deputy, Lester Mallory, and Staff Assistant [Frank Devine,
were, within the Latin American Division of the Department,
aware of Dearborn's "current projects," (bevine| to Dearborn
letter, 8/15/60) *
By September 1960, Thomas Mann had replaced Roy Rubottom
as Assistant Secretary for Inter-~ werican Affairs, and Prank
Devine| had become a Special Assistant to Mr. Mann. While
serving as Special Assistant to the Assistant Secretary, [Devine|
reportedly spent ninety percent of his time coordinating State

activities in Latin America. It was in this Capacity that

Devine maintained almost daily communication with

“and other officials of the CIA's Western Hemisphere Division

(Devine, p.7)

*Déarborn's candid reporting to State during the summer of 1960
raised concern with the Department and he was advised that certain
specific information should more appropriately come through "tne
other channel" (presumably, CIA communications). Dearborn was
advised that his cables to State were distributed to at least 19
different recipient offices, (Id.)

have asked us for a few sandwiches, hardly

more, and we are not prepared to make them
available. Last week we were asked to furnish
three or four pineapples for a party in the
near future, but I could remember nothing in my in~
structions that would have allowed me to contri-
bute this ingredient. Don't think I wasn't
tempted. I nave rather specific suidelines

to the effect that salad ingredients will be
delivered outside tho picnic grounds and will

be brought to the area by another club.
(Dearborn letter to [Deving, 3/16/61)

After reviewing his “picnic" lettér, together with the requests
in the March 14 and 15 cables discussed above, Dearborn con-
cluded during his testimony before the Committee that the
“pineapples” were probably the requested fragmentation

grenades and the restriction on delivering salad ingredients
outside of the Picnic grounds was, almost certainly, meant to
refer to the requirements of the January 12 Special Group
Order that arms be delivered outside the Dominican Republic.
(Dearborn 7/29, PP. 25-27)

2. The Passage of Pistols

a. Pouching to the Dominican Republic

03
In a March 15, 1961 cable, {chief of| Station (Qa) reported

that Dearborn had asked for three .38 caliber pistols for issue
to several dissidents. In reply, Headquarters cabled: "Regret
no authorization exists to suspend pouch regulations against
shipment of arms" and indicated that their reply had heen coor-
dinated with State. (HOS to Station cable, 3/17/61) The
Station [ohies \then asked Headquarters to seek the necessary
authorization and noted that at his last two posts, he had

received pistols via the pouch for “worthy Purposes" and,


therefore, he knew it could be done. {Station to Hgs cable,
3/21/61) Two days later, Headquarters cabled that the pistols
and ammunition were being pouched. However, the Station
[ented] vas instructed not to advise Dearborn. (Ags. to Station
cable, 3/24/61)*

b. Reason for the CIA Instruction
3 Not to Tell Dearborn

testified that he believed the "don't tell Dear-
born the pistol is being pouchea" language simply meant that
‘the sending of firearms through the “iplomatig pouch was not
something to be unnecessarily discussed, Ge pp. 78,79)

Dearborn said he never doubted the Pouch was used, since he knew

had no other means of receiving weapons. (Dearborn,
7/29, p. 33)

c. Were the Pistols Related to Assassination?

Dearborn testified that he had asked for a single pistol
for purposes completely unrelated to any assassination con-
sideration. (Dearborn, 7/29, pp. 29-31) He said he had been
approached by a Dominican contact who lived in a remote area
and was concerned for the safety of his family in the event

of political reprisals. Dearborn testified that he had believed

* The Inspector General's Report, issued in connection with
a review of these events, concludes that:

“There is no indication in the EMDEED operational files
that the pistols were actually pouched. The request

for pistols appears to have been overtaken by a sub-
Sequent request for submachine guns."  (I.G. Report, p. 60)

This conclusion is difficult to understand in light of the March
24, 1961, Headquarters to Station cable, which provides:

"Cc. Pouching. revolvers-and ammo-requested TRUI 0462
{in 20040} on 28 March. Do not advise(name Dearborn deleted)
pocra: 59403 Bat @uga bebe ing pouched. Explanation follows."


os

the man's fears were well-founded and had promised to seek a
pistol.*

Although there is no direct evidence Linking any of these
pistols to the assassination of Trujillo, a June 7, 1961, CIA
memorandum, unsigned and with no attribution as to source,

states that two of the three pistols were passed by [owen| to

Winog" Bare United States citizen who was in direct

contact with the action element of the dissident group. It

should also be noted that the assassination was apparently con-
ducted with almost complete reliance upon hand weapons. Whether
one or more of these .38 caliber Smith & Wesson pistols
eventually came into the hands of the assassins

and, if so, whether they were used in connection with the

assassination, remain open questions.

Both Dearborn and/ QBS) ces tities that they regarded the pistols:

as weapons for self-defense purposes and they never
considered them in any way connected with the then-current

assassination plans. (Dearborn 7/29, p.76; fowsen

However, none of the Headquarters cables inquired as to the

03-4
purpose for which the handguns were sought and Ge: cable
Stated only that Dearborn wanted them for Passage to dissidents.

(Station to Hos cable, 3/15/61) Indeed, the March 24, 1961,

The pistols were, however, apparently sent in one package

fied that, what he believed to be the one gun, came “wrapped
and that he passed it. . (Dearborn, -7/29,p.30)

for permission to pass to the dissidents three 30 caliber M1

Navy personnel after the U.s. broke formal diplomatic relations
in Auyust 1960. Dearborn testified that he knew of and concurred
in the proposal to supply the carbines to the dissidents.
(Dearborn 7/29, pp. 42,43) On March 31, 1961 CIA Headquarters

ce. Failure to Disclose to State Department
Officials in dasnington

There is no indication that the request or the passage
of the carbines was disclosed to State Department officials in
Washington until several weeks after the passage. In fact, on
April 5, lieadquarters requested its Station to ask Dearborn
not to comment in correspondence with State that the carbines
and ammunition were being passed to tae dissidents. This cable
was sent while eB vs in Washington, and it indicated that
upon his return to the Dominican Republic, he would explain
tne request. The Station replied that Dearborn had not com-
mented on the carbines and ammunition in his correspondence

with State and he realized the necessity not to do so. (Station

to HQS cable, 4/6/61)

Dearborn testified, however, that he believed, ar the
time of his April 6 cable, that someone in the State De-
partment had been consulted in advance and had approved the

passage of the carbines (Dearborn 7/29, p. 44)

Docld:32202487 Page 101


3. Requests For and Pouching of the Machine Guns

2)
a. GER Reaveses Machine Guns (for Use

Ssassination)

The Station (nies) Suggested that Headquarters consider
; 2

pouching an M3 machine gun on February 10, 1961 PP. 63,64;

Station to HQS cable, 3/15/61). The request was raised again

in March but no action was taken. On March 20, 1961, cabled

a dissident request for five M3 or comparable machine guns
specifying their wish that the arms be sent via the diplomatic
pouch or similar means. The dissidents were said to feel that
delivery by air drop or transfer at sea would overly-tax their
resources. (Station to HQS cable, 3/20/61)

The machine guns sought by the dissidents were clearly
identified, in (omen s cable, as being sought for use in connec-
tion with an attempt to assassinate Trujillo. This Plan was to
kill Trujillo in the apartment of his mistress and, according

9
to cable:
4

" To do they need five M3 or comparable machine-
guns. and 1500 rounds ammo for personal defense in
event fire fight. Will use quiet weapons for basic
job." (Id.)

In essence, CIA's response was that the timing for an
o3
was told that precipitious or

assassination was wrong.
uncoordinated action could lead to the emergence of a leftist,
Castro-type regime and the “mere disposal of Trujillo may create
more problems than solutions.” tt was Headquarters’ position
that:
"\..we should attempt to avoid precipitous action
by the internal dissidents until opposition group
and HQS are better Prepared to support /assassination/*,

effect a change in the regime, and cope with the after-
math." (HQS to Station cable, 3/24/61)

to deliver machine guns and ammunition to the dissidents when
they developed a capability to received them, but that security
considerations precluded use of U.S. facilities as a carrier.*

carbines passed from the American Consulate, together with
whatever else was available, (Id.)

In response to the April 26 cable, Headquarters restated
that there was no approval oe pass any additional arms to the

dissidents and requested

to advise the dissidents that the
United States was simply not prepared at that time to cope with
the aftermath of the assassination. (See C/S comments,

an effort be made to turn off the assassination attempt and
testified that efforts to carry out the instructions were
unsuccessful. In effect, che dissidents informed him that
this was their affair and it could not be turned off to suit

the convenience of the U.S. government.

fact, we feel that the transfer of arms would

Kennedy, was sent to Dearborn on May 29, 1961. (State Dept.

to Dearborn cable, 5/29/61)

VII, May 30, 1961 and Immediately Thereafter:

A. Trujillo Assassinated

Late in the evening of May 30, 1961, Trujillo was ambushed
and assassinated near San Cristobal, Dominican Republic. The
assassination closely paralleled the plan disclosed by the
action group to American tTepresentatives in the Dominican Republic
and passed on to officials in Washington at both the CIA and
the State Department. (Dearborn cable to State, 5/30/61) The
assassination was conducted by members of the action group, to
whom the American carbines had been passed, and such sketchy
information as is available indicates that one or more of the
carbines were in the Possession of the assassination group when
Trujillo was killed. (1. 6. Report, pp. 60-61). This evidence indicat.
however, that the actual assassination was accomplished by
handguns and shoteuris. (I.G. Report, p.61)

B. Cables to Washington

After receiving the May 29 cable. from Washington, both consul

o

General Dearborn and Station [cates GBD sent replies. According
to Dearborn's testimony, he did not regard the May 29 cable
as a change in U.S. policy concerning support for assSasSinations,

(Dearborn 1/29/75, p. 74),

5 Docld:32202487 Page 108

He interpreted the May 29 cable as saying:

"...we don't care if the Dominicans assassinate
Trujillo, that is all right. But we don't want
anything to pin this on us, because we aren't
doing it, it is the Dominicans who are doing
it." (Dearborn, 7/29, p. 104)

Dearborn testified that this accorded with what he said had
always been his Personal belief; thae the U.S. should not be
involved in an assassination and that if an assassination
occurred it would be strictly a Dominican affair. (Dearborn

7/29, pp. 100, 101) 5

°
In contrast the CIA Station |[cnier, @MMN| aia regard the

cable as manifesting a change in U.S. policy, particularly on

the questionor supplying arms. (Prases P. 120) He believed the
May 29 cable was the final word in U.S. policy on this matter

and consequentiy felt that the government had retreated from

its prior position, of offering material support to the Gissi-
dents, and had adopted a new position of withholding such sunnort.

responsive cable to Headquarters stated:

"HQS aware extent to which U.S. government already
associated with assassination. If we are to at least
cover up tracks, CIA personnel directly involved in
assassination preparation must be withdrawn."

\

As Evolution of CIA Strate;
eR OF CLA Strategy

The President's instruction to the CIA on September 15 to prevent
Allende's assumption of power was given in the context of a broad U.S. _
Government effort to achieve that end. The September 15 instruction
te the CIA involved from the beginning the Promotion of a military coup
d'etat in Chile. Although there was talk of a coup in Chilean military
circles, there was little indication that it would actually take place 6
without active U.S, encouragement and support.

There was much talk among Chilean officers about
the possibility of some kind of coup...but this
was not the kind of talk that wa being backed by,

you know, serious organizational Planning.
(Karamessines testimony, Aug. 6, 1963, p. 32)

1. The “Constitutional Coup" Approach —

Although efforts to achieve a political solution te the Allende
victory continued simultaneous with Track TI, the Agency premised its

activities on the assumption that the political avenue was a dead end.

On September 21, CIA Headquarters cabled its Station in Santiago:

Purpose of exercise is to prevent Allende assump—
tion of power, Paramilitary legerdemain has been
discarded. Military solution is objective.
" (iqs. 236, Sept. 21, 1970, para. 3)
The initial strategy attempted to enlist President Frei in promoting
a coup to perpetuate his presidency for six more years. The Agency
decided to promise “help in any election which was an outgrowth of a
successful military takeover." (Nov. 18, 1970 Helms memo to Kissinger)
.
Under this plan Frei would invite the military to take over, dissolve the
KA,
Congress, and proclaim a new election. (s private U.S. eltizen who had ice
a

been a conduit for CIA funds to Frei's 1964 campaign was sent to see nie ) .
J i

(itn this message on:September 24. (Task Force Log, September >)
a _ Thomas Karamessines, the Deputy Director for Plans, testified:

MPS So this was in a sense not Track Il, but in a
sense another aspect of a quiet and hopefully
non-violent military coup....This was abandoned
when the military were reluctant to push Frei
publicly...and, number two, Frei was reluctant
to leave on his own in the absence of pressure
from the military....There was left as the only
chance of success a straight military coup.
(Karamessines testimony, Aug. 6, 1975, p. 6)

At the same time, the Station in Santiago reported:

Strong reasons for thinking neither Frei nor —_
Schneider will act. For that reason any scenario
in which either has to play an active role now
appears utterly unrealistic. Overcures to lower
echelon officers (e.g., Valenzueka) can of course
be made. This involves promoting Army split.
(Sen. to Hqs. 424, September 23, 1970) a

2, Military Solution
President Frei's failure even to attempt to persuade his own party
. ( convention on October 3-4 from reaching a compromise with Allende ended
od

all hope of using him to prevent an Allende presidency. (November 18

memo, Helms to Kissinger, page 16) Thus, by the beginning of October,
it was clear that a vehicle for a military solution would have to be
found in the second echelon of Chilean officers, and that the top leader-
ship of the Armed Services, particularly General Rene Schneider, consti-

tuted a stumbling block. (Santiago 424, September 23, 1970; Santiago 439,

September 30, 1970) The Agency's task was to cause a coup in a highly
unpromising situation and to overcome the formidable obstacles represented
by Frei's inaction, Schneider's strong constitutionalism, and the absence
of organization and enthusiasm among those officers who were interested

in a coup,

pon

sibility for Chile. The task force had a special communications channel to

Santiago and Buenos Aires to compartment cable traffic about Track It
(November 18, 1970, Helms to Kissinger memo, page 3) Most of the
significant operational decisions were made by Phillips, Broe and
Karamessines, who met on a daily basis.

It should be noted that all those involved with the task force de:
cribed the pressure from the White House as intense, Indeed, Karames.
has said that Kissinger “left no doubt in my mind that he was under ¢!
heaviest of pressure to get this accomplished, and he in turn was pla
ing us under the heaviest of pressures to get it accomplished." (Kar:
messines testimony, August 6, 1975, page 7) The Deputy Chief of the
Western Hemisphere Division) Janes Flannery, | testified that pressure

"as tough as I ever saw it in my time there, extreme," (Ftannery| tes
mony, July 15, 1975, page 20) Broe testified that "I have never gone
Chrough a period as we did on the Chilean thing. I mean it was juse
constant, constant,...Just continual pressure....It was coming from ¢)

White House." (Broe testimony, August 4, 1975, page 55)

of Station, the CIA decided to entise|Cotonel Wimere \in collecting in-

telligence concerning the possibility of a coup and to use him as a
channel to let the interested Chilean military know of U. $. support

To obtain fismert's services, CIA officials prepared a Suggested mes-

sage for the Director of DIA to send to the[ Amy [Attache in Santiago
through CIA communications channels. Because the DIA Director, General
Bonald V, Bennett, was in Europe on official business, the Deputy
Director of Central Intelligence, General Cushman, invited DIA Deputy
Director Lt. General Jammie M. Philpott to his office on September 28,
1970.* During that meeting, General Cushman Yequested the assistance of

This message is for your eyes only, and should not be dis~
cussed with any person other than those CAS officers who will
be knowledgeable. CAS will identify them. (Headquarters 380
to Santiago)

For this and ail subsequent messages intended for che aeny Attache,
the secret CIA communications channel was used.

Both General Philpott and Thomas Karamessines testified that ini-
tially the [army Attache would be used only to “obtain or procure” in=
telligence on Chilean military officers.* (Philpott, p. il; Karamessines,
Pp. 6) The September 28, 1970 message to the/‘acay] Accache, however, did
in fact trigger his deep involvement in the coup attempt. According to
the Attache's testimony, he received day-to-day instructions from the
Chief of Station, and on occasion, the COS would show hin messages
ostensibly from Generals Bennett and/or Philpott, directing him to
take certain actions. The CO$ also transmitted messages from the [arwy }
Attache to these Generals.

General Bennett testified that he never had knowledge of Track 11
and that he never received any communication relating thereto, nor did
he ever authorize the transmission of any messages to the farayJaccache.
General Phiipoce also testified that he had no recollection of anything
connected with Track II after his initial meeting with General Cushman
on September 28, (Philpott, p. 16)

U. S. Army Colonel Robert C. Roth, who in September and October 1970
was the Chief of the Human Resources Division, Director of Collection, DIA,

testified that he recalled working for Generals Bennett and Philpott on
“a priority requirement to identify Chilean personalities who might be
helpful in preventing the election of Allende as President of Chite.”
(Roth, Vol. I, p. 6) Though Roth recalls no mention of Track II as such,
the goal of this mission is identical to that described in the message
of September 28 bearing Philpote's signature.

Beginning on October 15, Roth kept a chronology of his activities
connected with Chile. This chronology reflects that there was a meeting
on October 21 tegarding the preparation of biographic material on Chilean
generals which focused on their willingness to participate in a military
coup. Generals Bennett, Philpott, and a CIA representative attended,

The chronology also shows that on October 21, Roth delivered a message to
Mr. Broe to be sent by CIA channels.* A message was sent to feos. Wimert \

‘
\
a
that same day, ostensibly from General Bennett, which authorized:

FYI: Suspension temporarily imposed on MAP and FMS has
been rescinded. This action does not repeat not imply
change in our estimate of situation, On the contrary,

dt is intended to place us in a posture in which we can
formally cut off assistance if Allende elected and situa~
tion develops as we anticipate. Request up date on situa-
tion. (Santiago 446; Ref: Headquarters 762) (Headquarters
934, 21 October 1970)

Roth testified that this DIA project ended on October 23 when he
followed Philpott's instructions to deliver biographic information on

Chilean figures to Mr. Broe at CIA. Philpott also instructed him that

"any further action on the subject would henceforth be the responsibility

of the CIA and that DIA would perform normal support functions." (Roth,

p. 8)*
Both Bennett and Philpote testified that the activities described

by Roth were routine DIA activities. However, Colonel Roth testified:

ful, and so forth. I have nothing specific as to the nature of
the instructions or the channels through which they came,

Colonel Roth. That was my impression at the time.

Q. You understand from your work in the Defense Department

that the highest level of government usually indicated the

President of the United States?

Colonel Roth. I would assume that.

The CIA produced copies of several messages which identify
Generals Bennett and Philpott as either the sender or recipient. Among
these documents is a message relating to Track II which bears Philpott's
Purported signature. (Undated message. ca. 14 October 1970) General
Philpott admitted that the signature appears to be his but doubted that
it was and he could not recall signing it, or having seen it. (Bhilpote,
pe ) CIA also produced messages of. October 14 (Headquarters 762)
and October 21 (Headquarters 934) conveying instructions from General
Bennett to the iArmy|aceache. General Bennett testified he did not
authorize these nessages:

It is beyond the responsibilities which I hed in the military

assistance area. It goes beyond the Tesponsibility which I
had in terms that I would have to get the authority or the

According to Karamessines, only the White House had the authority to
issue the directives contained in those messages (Karamessines testi-
mony, p. 84)
The Department of Defense was unable to provide any documents bear-
ing on the issue of fimere} Track II instructions or responses. A
DOD file search under the direction of General Daniel 0. Graham, the
present Director of DIA, produced no copies of communication documents
for the September-October 1970 period. (Graham, p. 6) However, Roth

testified that detailed memoranda for the record which he prepared on

his activities are missing from the files. (Roth, ,Vol: Il, p.)

messages to Generals Bennett and/or Philpott and in never sending a
message without Proper authorization. Mr. Karamessines was Particularly

forceful in this regard:

++-T can recall no iastance in my experience at the Central
Intelligence Agency in which a Message was received for an
individual, an officer of the governmenc. anywhere, in what-
ever department, which was not faithfully, directly, promptly
and fully aad accurately delivered to that officer, or to hig
duly authorized representative.

(Karamessines testimony, p. 79)

We may have played tricks overseas, but it stopped at the

water's edge, and we didn't play tricks among ourselves or

among our colleagues within the Agency or in other agencies,
(Karamessines testimony, p. 79) .

We could not remain in business for a day...if this had been

the practice of the Agency. [er would have been no time at

all before we would have been found out, a single instance

of the kind of thing you are Suggesting might have taken

Place would have Put us out of business.

(Karamessines testimony, p. 80)
Ry

Dr. Kissinger denied he was ever informed of the Army ‘Attache's

ee:
\
role or that he authorized any messages to be sent to the [tray etache.
(Kissinger testimony, p, 22)

The investigation to date has not resolved the conflict between the
Statements of the sentor CIA, DIA and White House officials, There are
four possibilities chat could explain the conflict. First, Generals
Bennett and Philpott were cognizant of Track Il and communicated their
general instructions to the facay javeache. This Possibility would be

contrary to their sworn testimony, Second, General Bennett was not aware

of Track II but General Philpott was and communicated general instructions to
the [hemy jactach This possibility is Supported by Roth's testimony
but would be contrary to Philpote's sworn testimony and his duty to

keep General Bennete informed. Third, the CIA acted on its own + and,

after receiving initial authority, from General Philpott, co-opted and ordured



the Pen pevache without further informing any member of the Department
€ of Defense of the white House. This possibility would be contrary to
the sworn testimony off Davia Phittips | William Broe, Thomas Karamessines,
and William Colby. Fourth, members of the White House staff authorized —
the CIA to convey orders to the farmy| Attache on the basis of high or
highest government authority. Further, that the White House staff
directed that the krny lAttache's superiors in the Pentagon not be in-
formed. This possibility would contradict the sworn testimony of Dr. ”

Kissinger and General Alexander Haig.

D. The /False Flag Base )

In order to minimize the risks of making contact with the dissident
Chilean officers, the task force decided in late September to set up a

"nationals of other countries to supplement folonel Wimert's contacts

The False Flaggers were compartmencted from each other and reported
separately on their contacts to a "deep cover" CIA officer |in Santiago
who in turn reported to the Station. According to the testimony of the
Chief of Station, they received their instructions from Washington and ~ —
not from him. (Chief of Station testimony (Felix), August 1, 1975, p. 27) 3
E. Chief of Station

Although most of the Station officers in Santiago did not know of

Track II, the Chief and Deputy Chief of Station were knowledgeable and .
the Chief of Station initiated contacts on his own with Chilean officers.. i e
The COS has testified that he regarded Track LI as unrealistic:

E had left no doubt in the minds-wf my colleagues
and superiors that I did not consider any kind of \
intervention in those constitutional processes
desirable....And one of the reasons certainly for my
last recall (to Washington) was to be read: the riot
act--which was done in a very pleasant, but very
intelligible manner. Specifically, I was told at
that time that the Agency was not too interested in
continuously being told by me that certain proposals
which had been made could not be executed, or would
be counterproductive. (Chief of Station (Felix)

testimony, August 1, 1975, p. 10) . -
The Chief of Station's objection to Track IL did not go unnoticed.
The following instruction to the COS was sent on October 7: “Report
should net contain analysis and argumentation but simply report on .
action taken." (Headquarters 612, 7 October) Very simply, Headquarters
wanted the Station to take orders quietly as was the Agency itself. 1

4 A. The Chilean Conspirators

Anti-Allende coup plotting in Chile centered around several key
individuals. One of these was retired General Roberto Viaux, the General
who had led the "Tacnazo" insurrection a year before. Following the
“Tacnazo” revolt, and his dismissal from the Army, Viaux retained the
support of many non-commissioned and junior officers as well as being
the recognized leader of several right-wing civilian groups. (CTA nt
Briefing Paper, "Special Mandate from the President on Chile," July —_
15, 1975)

Another individual around which plotting centered was General Camila
Valenzuela, Commander of the Santiago Garrison. General Valenzuela was 2

There was considerable communication among the various plotting

elements. As Thomas Karamessines testified:
++.I might add here that it seemed that a good
dozen or more, maybe 20 Chilean senior officers me
were privy to what was going on (in addition to
President Frei and)they were all talking to one
another exchanging views and trying to see how

best to mount the kind of coup that they wanted
to see take place. (Karamessines testimony, p. 10)

B. contacts Prior to October 15
The CIA's initial cask in Chile was to assess the potential within
the Chilean military to stage a coup. [t recognized quickly that anti-
Allende currents did exist in the military and the Carabineros (police),
but were immobilized by "the tradition of military respect for the
Constitution" and "the public and private stance of General Schneider,
Commander in Chief of the Army, who advocated strict adherence to the
Constitution.” (CIA Report on Chilean Task Force Activities, 18 Novem-
, ber 1970, p. 17) The Agency's task, then, was to overcome “the apolitical,
constitutional-oriented inertia of the Chilean military." (Ibid, p. 2)
Since the very top of the Chilean military, embodied by General &
Schneider and his second-in-command, General Prat, were hostile to the
idea of a coup against Allende, discreet approaches were made to the
second level of general officers. They were to be informed that the U.S.
Government would support a coup both before and after it took place.*
(Headquarters to Station 611, 7 October 1970) This effort began in

ia \ .
earnest on October 5 when Colonel Wimert)informed both an Army General

The military officers were told, for example, that should Allende be
prevented from taking office, "The Chilean military will not be ostra-

cized, but rather can continue to count on us for MAP support and main-
tenance of our close relationship." (Hqs. 075517, 7 Octeber 1970)

Ao the next day, October 8, Headquarters cabled the Station in response

to che teare GE Gas) meetin. Headquarters took note of Schneider's
\
vesistance to coup plans and stated:

+.-This would make it more important than

ever to remove him and to bring this new

state of events...anything we or Station

can do to effect removal of Schneider? We

know this rhetorical question, but wish

inspire thought on both ends on this matter.
(Hqs. 628, 8 October)

During the first week of intensive efforts chances of success

Looked unusually bleak. The Chile Task Force Log commented:
President Frei and |the highest levels of the
irmed forces unable to pull themselves together
to block Allende. The Chilean mfMlitary's tradi-
tion of non-intervention, Frei's reluctance to
tarnish his historical image, General Schneider's
firm constitutional stand, and most importantly,
the lack of leadership within the government and
military are working against a military takeover.

(Task Force Log, 8 October)

The following day the Station made reference to the “rapid(ly) waning
chances for success." (Santiago 487, 9 October) This pessimism was not
dispelled by their simuitaneous judgment: "Station has arrived at Viaux
solution by process of elimination.” (Santiago 504, 10 October) Three
days later the Task Force agreed: "We continue to focus our attention
on General Viaux who now appears to be the only military leader willing

to block Allende." (Task Force Log, 13 October)

If Viaux was the CIA's only hope of staging a coup, things were bleak

4 \
indeed. His own colleagues, Generals and Walenzuela described him

as "a General without an army." (Santiago 495, 9 October) Yet in the

first two weeks of October he came to be regarded as the’ best hope for.

Although Gotonel Wimert }vas instructed not te invelve himse LE with

Viaux because of the high risk involved (Santiago 461, 5 October), he
fh

served initially as a contact to Viaux through jan military
it ~
Attache. The Ireported on October 5 that Viaux wanted several

hundred paralyzing gas grenades to launch a coup on October 9. (Santiago
476, 6 October) Headquarters turned down the request, concluding that
a “mini-coup at this juncture would be counterproductive" and Viaux
should postpone his plans, “while encouraging him in a suitable manner
to maintain his posture so that he may join larger movement later if
it materializes." (Headquarters 585, 6 October)

The primary purpose of the {False Flag dase"|vas to contact Viaux,

. f eh
and it very rapidly relieved (Wimert and the Attache) of that

task. Viaux reiterated his demand for an air drop of weapons to the
“False Flagger)"" and again the response was the same: reject the demand
for arms, but encourage him to keep planning. In essence the Agency
was buying time with Viaux: “We wish to encourage Viaux to expand and
refine his coup planning. Gain some influence over his actions."
(Headquarters 689, 10 October) To achieve this latter purpose, Head-
quarters authorized passing $20,000 in cash and a promise of $250,000
in life insurance to Viaux and his associates, as a demonstration of

U.S. support. (Headquarters, 729, 13 October)
On October 13, Headquarters again indicated its concern over Schneider
by asking: "What is to keep Schneider from making statement in early

hours which will freeze those military leaders who might otherwise join

Viaux?" (Headquarters 729, 13 October) The Station's response later that

same day was "Viaux intends to kidnap Generals Schneider and Prats within |

the next 48 hours in order to precipitate a coup." (Santiago 527,

(Task Force Log, 14 Octobér)
C. October 15 Decision
To summarize, by October 15, General Viaux had advertised to his con-
tact a desire to proceed with a coup, had ifidicated he would deal with
the Schneider obstacle by kidnapping him, had met at least once with Gen=
oraié| ind ‘Valenzuela and had once postponed his coup plans.*
Qn October 15 Thomas Karamessines met Henry Kissinger and Alexander
: Haig at the White House to discuss the situation in Chile. According

to the Agency's record of this meeting, Karamessines “provided a run-

down on Viaux, the meeting with, and, in some detail,

the general situation in Chile from the coup-possibility viewpoint."
(Memorandum of Conversation/Kissinger, Karamessines, and Haig, 15 October
1970) A decision was made at the meeting "to de-fuse the Viaux coup plot,
at least temporarily:"

* The reason for Viaux postponing his coup plans was the subject of a cable
from Santiago to Headquarters:

We discount Viaux's statement that he had called off his coup at=
tempt because of (False Flag Offices's impending visit. Other re-
porting indicated Viaux probably nét able or intending move this
weekend. (Santiago 499, 10 October)

There is also reason to believe that General Valenzuela was instrumental
in persuading Viaux to postpone. According to the Chile Task Force Log:

Station reported that on 12 October General Valenzuela met
with General Viaux and attempted to persuade him not to at-
tempt a coup." (Chile Task Force Log, 14 October)

. “a \ Te was decided by those present that the Agency
T. "must get a message to Viaux warning him against
al any precipitate action. In essence the message
should state: "We have reviewed your plans and
based on your information and ours, we come. to
the conclusion that your plans for a coup at
this time cannot succeed. Failing, they may re-
duce your capabilities in the future. Preserve _
your assets. We will stay in touch. The time
will come when you with all your other friends
can do something. You will continue to have
our support." (15 October Memorandum of Conver-
sation, Kissinger, Karamessines, Haig)

a

The meeting concluded, according to the Agency's record, "on Dr. .
Kissinger's note that the Agency should continue keeping the pressure _—
on every Allende weak spot in sight--now, after the 24th of October,
after 5 November, and into the future until such time as new marching
orders are given. Mr. Karamessines stated that the Agency would comply."'* vee

The following day CIA Headquarters cabled the results of the White
House meeting to the Station in Santiago:

2. Ie is firm and continuing policy that Allende
be overthrown by a coup....We are to continue to

generate maximum pressure toward this end utiliz-
ing every appropriate resource.

3. After the most careful consideration it was
determined that a Viaux coup attempt carried out nm
by him alone with the forces now at his disposal

would fail. Thus it would be counterproductive

to our Track Two objectives. It was decided that

CIA get a message to Viaux warning him against

precipitate action. (Headquarters 802, 16 Octo~ .
ber)

The message was supplemented by orders to "continue to encourage him
(Viaux) to amplify his planning; encourage him to join forces with other

coup planners," (Headquarters 802, 16 October) The message concluded:
: a

"There is great and continuing interest in the activities of

Valenzuela et al and we wish them optimum good fortune." (Ibid.)

f Eigen:
killing, neither the Army @@MMCOloner nor the Navy

Shortly after 8 am,General Schneider's car was intercepted, on his

way to work, by the abductorsand he was mortally wounded when he drew

his handgun in self-defense. The Military Court determined that hand

gure had been used to kill General Schneider, although it also found . 7

that one unloaded machine gun was at the scene of the killing.”
The first Station reports following the Schneider shooting said

"a Litary Mission sources claim General Schaeider machine gunned on

way to work" (Santiago 587, 22 October) and "Assailants used grease £

guns." (Santiago 589, 22 October) ‘The submachine guns had previously

been described as "grease guns." Thus the initial reaction of the Station

‘ater was that Schneider had been shot with the same kind of weapons delivered

several hours earlier to the Army (i mn

Santiago then informed
Headquarters "Station has instructed(Col. Winerd to hand over $50,000

if Gen. Valenzuela requests " (Santiago 592, 22 October), thus indicating
that the Station thought the kidnapping had been accomplished by Valen-

zuela's paid abductors. Later that day, the Station cabled Headquarters:

* The Military Court determined that those who participated in the
shooting of General Schneider on October 22 were part of the Viaux-led
conspiracy. The Court also found that this same group had participated
in the October 19 and 20 kidnap attempts.

"

In June 1972 General Viaux was convicted for complicity in the plot
culminating in the death of General Schneider. He received a 20-year
prison sentence for being "author of the crime of kidnapping which re- —
sulted in serious injury to the victim," and a five-year exile for con-
spiring to cause a military cgup. Also convicted on the latter charge

(Santiago 598, 22 October)

FP. Post October 22 Events

The shooting of General Schneider resulted immediately in a declara-
tion of martial law, the appointment of General Prats to succeed Schneider
as Commander in Chief, and the appointment of General Valenzuela as chief ,
of Santiago province. These measures, and others taken, caused the Chile‘
Task Force to make the following initial judgment:

With only 24 hours remaining before the Congressional
tunoff, a coup climate exists in Chile....The attack
on General Schneider has produced developments which
closely follow Valenzuela's plan. »..Consequently the
plotters' positions have been enhanced.

(Chile Task Force Log, 22 October)

On October 23, Director Helms reviewed and discussed Track Ii:

It was agreed...that a maximum effort has been achieved,

and that now only the Chileans themselves can manage a

successful coup. The Chileans have been guided to a

point where a military solution is at least open to cme
them. (Task Force Log,~24 October): .

A. September bts eb eRet

September 18

Helms and Karamessines met with Kissinger at the White House. As

Helms' notes of the September 15 meeting indicate, Kissinger wanted a
plan within 48 hours. ‘In the meeting on the 18th, according to CIA _
records, there was little discussion of a military coup. Rather the
conversation focused on "what economic leverage could be exercised in
the Chilean situation...." (Mfemorandum/Meeting with DDP, 18 September)

The efficacy of economic pressure continued to be a subject of con- SI
cern during the Last days of September. Apparently that pressure was

viewed as another inducement to Frei to opt for the "Frei gambic."

September 21
The 40 Committee met. The Select Committee has no confirmation
that Chile was on the agenda at this meeting. Karamessines' calendar . eed
confirms that he attended; presumably Kissinger, the 40 Committee chair-
( j man, also attended, although the Committee has not been able to review
his calendar. All that can be said about this meeting~-and the meetings
‘
of the Senior Review Group, which Kissinger also chaired--is that the .
meetings afforded Karamessines and Kissinger an opportunity to meet
privately and discuss Track II if they desired. In all these instances

save the 40 Committee meeting on September 22, the Committee has no
evidence to confirm that such a private Kissinger/Karamessines meeting
actually took place. That the CIA prepared a memorandum of conversa~
tion for the private meeting on the 22nd but has been able to find none
for other meetings may provide some support for the argument that no

other such private meetings occurred.

in his testimony before the Committee, regarded the CIA

Kissinger,

memorandum of conversation as substantially correct, although somewhat

C more detailed than he would have remembered. (Kissinger testimony, p. 52

He believed the Agency had been cold to “stand down and preserve your
assets,"
Kissinger believed that the gist of the October 15th meeting as
Tecorded in the CIA memorandum was incompatible with the order the CIA
issued to its Station the next day, an order ostensibly based on the
October 15th meeting. And, he noted, in writing its memorandum of the —
meeting of the 1Sth, the CIA had a “high incentive to preserve the maxi-
mum degree of authority." (Ibid., pp, 55-56) The October 16th order ‘
indicated that Track II had been reviewed at "high USG level" the previous c

day, and stated:

2. It is firm and continuing policy that Allende
be overthrown by a coup. It would be much prefer- 2
( able to have this transpire prior to 24 October
a but efforts in this regard will continue vigorously
beyond this date....

4. There is axgard/ana%, g interest in the
activities of valensuela et al —_
and we wish them optimum good fortune.

(Headquarters 802, 16 October 1970)

Kissinger recalled the October 15th conversation as “turning off
the coup plans rather than giving a new order to do them." (Kissinger
testimony, p. 56) Haig agreed in his testimony.

The conclusions of that meeting were that we had te
better not do anything rather than something. that

was not going to succeed....My ‘general feeling

was, I left that meeting with the impression that

there was nothing authorized." .

In a cable on August 25, CIA chief of \Station john Richardson\
reported the result of a conference among himself, Lodge, True-
heart, General Harkins (Commander, Milicary Assistance Command,
Vietnam (MACV) and General Weede (Chief of Staff, MACV). They
accepted Deptel 243 "as a basic decision from Washington and
would preceed to do their best to carry out instructions", (1.G.,
C, pp. 7-8) but believed that Diem would refuse to remove his
brother from his position in the government.

Early in the morning of August 26, 1963, the Voice of America
in South Vietnam placed the blame on Nhu for the August 21 raids.
and absolved the army. The broadcast also reported speculation
that the United States contemplated suspending aid to the South
Vietnamese Government (Pentagon Papers, p. 212) .% -Later on that
same day, Lodge presented his credentials to Diem. CIA officers
Conein and [Spera|vere told to see Generals Khiem and Khanh,
respectively, and to convey to them the substance of Deptel 243,
but to remind them that "we cannot be of any help during initial
action of assuming power of state, Entirely their own action,
win or lose’ (bare 030d, 8/26/63).

A message from the White House on August 29 authorized
Harkins to confirm to the Vietnamese Generals that the United
States would support a coup if it had a good chance of succeeding,
but did not involve United States armed forces. Lodge was autho-
rized to suspend United States aid at his discretion. (Deptel 272,

8/29/63.) A cable from the President to Lodge on the same day stated:

¥In a cable to Harriman, Lodge conplained that the VOA broadcast
had “complicated our already difficult problem“ by eliminating
“the possibility of the generals' effort achieving. surprise."
Lodye further warned that “the US must not appear publicly in
the matter, thus giving the ‘kiss of death' to its friends*
(Cable, Ledge to Narriman, 8/26/63).

against a coup, but suggested that alternative leadership should be
identified and cultivated. The recommendations were promptly id
approved by the President. (Pentagon Papers, pp.215-}16)

On October 3 Conein contacted Minh. Minh explained that a
coup was being planned, and requested assurances of American
Support if it were successful. tinh outlined three courses of
action, one of which vas the assassination of gien's brothers,

Nhu and Can (Conein, p.25; cable, Saigon to Di ector, 10/5/63) ."

The {acting Chief of the cta\station,

October 5 that he had recommended to Ledge that “we do not set
ourselves irrevocably against the assassination plot, since the
other two alternatives mean either a blood bath in Saigon or a
protracted struggle" (Cable, Saigon to Director, 10/5/63).

A cable from the Director, CIA to Saigon responded that:

“(w)e certainly cannot be in the position of stimulating,
approving, or supporting assassination, but on the other
hand, we are in no way responsible for stopping every

such threat of which we might receive even partial know-
ledge. We certainly vould not favor assassination of Dien.
We believe engaging ourselves by taking position on this
matter opens door too easily for probes of our position

re others, re support of regime, et cetera. Consequently
believe best approach is hands off, llowever, ,ye naturally
interested in intelligence on any such plan."

————
* The other courses of action were the encirclement of Saigon

by various military units and direct confrontation between military
units involved in the coup and loyalist units.

** Colby, who was then Chief, Far Eastern Division, drafted
this cable for McCone. Colby testified:

"Q: So you were on notice as of that date that the Director
personally opposed any involvement by the CIA in an assas-
sination?-

"Colby: I certainly was." (Colby, p. 57)

Docld:32202487 Page 143

McCone testified that he met privately with the President and
the Attorney General, taking the position that "our role was
to assemble all information on intelligence as to what was
going on and to report it to the appropriate authorities, but
to not attempt to direct it" (McCone, P. 62). He believed the
United States should maintain a "hands off attitude" (McCone,
P. 62). McCone testified:
"I felt that the President agreed with my position, des-
pite the fact that he had great reservations concernin
Diem and his conduct. I urged him to fry to bring all
the pressure we could on Diem to change his ways, to
encourage more support throughout the country. My precise
words to the President, and I temember them very clearly,
was that Mr. President, if I was manager of a baseball

team, I had one pitcher, I'd keep him in the box whether
he was a goed pitcher or nor, By that I was Saying that,

in Vietnam and it might last several years and indeed

it did." (MeCone, pp. 62-63.)

McCone stated that he did net discuss assassination with
the President, but rather “whether we should let the coup go
or use our influences not to". He left the meeting believing
that the President agreed with his “hands off" recommendation

RIEER on October 6:

“McCone directs that you withdraw recommendation to
ambassador (concerning assassination plan) under MeCone
instructions, as we cannot be in position actively con-
doning such course of action and thereby engaging our
responsibility therefore" (CIA to Saigon, JOrR 73661,) 10/6/63) .

(McCone, pp. 62-63). MeCone cable

In response, the CIA Station in Saigon cabled headquarters:

“Action taken as directed. In addition, since DCM
Trueheart was also present when original recommendation
was made, specific withdrawal of recommendation at McCone's
instruction was Also conveyed to Trueheart. Ambassador
Lodge copmented that he shares NcCone's opinion." (Saigon
to CIA, [sare 1463, 10/7/63)

None of the informed sources give any indication of direct or

indirect involvement of the United States.¥*

* It must be noted that on October 30, 1963, Ambassador Lodge
notified Washington that there might be a request by ked leaders
for evacuation, and suggested Saipan as a point for evacuation
(Saigon Station Cable /No. 2036), 10/30/63). Conein was charged
with obraining the airplane... Between 6: eG none 7:00 on the
morning of November 2, Minh and Don aske:
aircraft. Conein relayed the request to &
Chief of {Station at the Embassy, who replied that 1t would not
be possible to get an aircraft for the next twenty-four hours,
since it would have to be flown from Guam. Conein testified
that Smith told him that Diem could be flown only to a country
that offered him asylum and that the plane could not land in
any other country. There were no aircraft immediately avail-
able that had sufficient range to reach a potential country
of asylum (Conein, p..54).

4 United States "as {a] matter of general policy cannot condone
assassination", although he did state that if the coup succeeded;
the United States would support the plotters.

d. Lumumba
The chain of events revealed by the documents and
testimony is strong enough to permit a reasonable inference
that the assassination plot was authorized by the President.
It is absolutely clear that Alien Dulles authorized the plot.
The juxtaposition of discussions concerning "disposing of"
Lumumba and taking “straightforward action" against him at NSC

and Special Group meetings with Dulles’ cable to the Congo,

c

Bissell's representation to {eeeeried| about “highest authority",
C and the delivery of poison to the Congo can be read to support
an inference that the President and the Special Group urged
the assassination of Lumumba.

Robert Johnson's testimony that he understood the President
to have ordered Lumumba's assassination at an NSC meeting does,
as he said, offer a “clue” about Presidential authorization
which, however, should be read in light of the uncertain record
of the meetings Johnson attended and the contrary testimony of

others in attendance at the meetings, including the President's

national security advisors. The fact that beth the(Chief of |

Ces .
Station and )Gortl é6\were under the impression that there was

Presidential authorization for the assassination of Lumumba

is not in itself direct evidence of such authorization because

this impression was derived solely from) Gottli
ettied [nor the {Chief ‘of

Station had first-hand knowledge of Allen Dulles' statements

with Bissell and Tweedy. Neither [6

about Presidential authorization. Richard Bissell assumed
that such authorization had been conveyed to him by Dulles,
but Bissell had no specific recollection of any event when
this occurred.

The evidence leads us to conclude that DDP Bissell and
DCI Dulles knew about and authorized the plot to assassinate
Lumumba. However, we are unable to make a finding that
President Eisenhower intentionally authorized an assassination
effort against Lumumba because of the lack of absolute certainty

in the evidence.

C First, it assumes that Dulles himself knew of the plots, a
matter which is not certain. Second, it assumes that Dulles
went privately to the two Presidents--a course of action
which Helms, who had far more covert action experience than
Bissell, testified was precisely what the doctrine of
plausible denial forbade CIA officials from doing. Third,
it necessarily assumes that the Presidents would understand
from a "circumlocutious" description that assassination was
being discussed.

The chain of assumptions is far too speculative for the
Committee to make findings inplicating Presidents who are not
able to speak for themselves. Moréover, it is inconsistent

( with Bissell's other testimony that "formal and explicit"
approval would be required for assassination,* and contrary
to the testimony of ail the Presidential advisors, the men

closest to both Eisenhower and Kennedy.

* If the evidence concerning President Eisenhower's order
to assassinate Lumumba is correct, it should be weighed against
Bissell's testimony concerning circuwlocutious briefings of the
Presidents in the Castro case. First, the Lumumba case would
imply that President Eisenhower and Dulles did discuss such
matters bluntly and not circumlocutiously. Second, the Lumumba
example indicates that the President would discuss such matters
openly in an appropriate forum, and would not need to be
approached privately. Third, it can be inferred from Bissell's
testimony in the Castro case that if President Eisenhower had
told Dulles that he approved of the plot, Dulles would not have
told anyone else of that fact. Yet JGottli b¥s| testimony in the
Lumumba case states that he had been told of Presidential autho-
vization for assassination by Bissell, who in turn assumed he
was told by Dulles. :
