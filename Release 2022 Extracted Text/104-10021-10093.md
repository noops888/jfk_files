Detainment on 23 November 1963.

With regard to the assassination of the President of the United States,
John F. Kennedy, it was learned that Lee Harvey OSWALD had been in
Mexico previously and accordingly this investigation was undertaken with
the following results:

Lee Harvey OSWALD was in fact in Mexico entering through
Nuevo Laredo, Tamaulipas. On 26 September 1963 as a tourist from New
Orleans and leaving through this same port of entry on 3 October 1963.

It was confirmed that he had come to Mexico to obtain a visa
from the Cuban Embassy to transit Cuba enroute to Moscow.

In this connection he made contact with Silvia Tirado De DURAN,
Mexican, (Silvia DURAN) with whom he met on two occasions since she is
the Consulate employee in charge of carrying out the necessary procedures
for this type of visa and filling out the cards with data about the requester,
an essential requirement to obtain a Cuban visa.

By direction from her, he contacted the Russian Consulate for
the same purpose. On learning that Silvia DURAN has been one of the
contacts Lee Harvey OSWALD made in Mexico, this woman and her husband,
Horacio DURAN Navarro, were detained for interrogation. They made the
following declarations:

1. Horacio DURAN Navarro: Mexican by birth, the son of a
Chilean father and Mexican mother. He said that he is an industrial
designer, having received his degree at the Escuela Nacional De Artes

of Cultural Relations, Jose MARTI, and for the last four months has
worked for Consul Euseblo AZCUE and now with MIRABAL receiving a
monthly salary of 1500.00 pesos. He admitted that his ideology is
leftist and that he ts sympathetic to the Cuban revolution giving ils aa
a reason why he permitted his w Ke to engage In the activities which it
promotes.

5. He stated that in talking to his wife about the assagsination of
President Kennedy she recognized the name of the accused Lee Harvey
OSWALD and immediately said that she thought that she had dealt with
the same Individual who {n the last days of September or first days of
October had been tn the Cuban Consulate requesting a visa for Cuba in
transit to Russia. That she personally attended to him and gave directions
regarding the visa request but indicating that It was necesearyto first
have a visa from the Russian Consulate and that he should send his request

never seen or known Lee Harvey OSWALD personally and that in

They paid for their own tickets.

daughter named Patricia three and one-half years old; that in July or
August of 1961, she was offered employment as coordinator at the .

10. With respect to the attempt on President Kennedy, when she
heard the news she became depressed and thought that the author was
some maniac and when she knew that it was an element of ''The Fair
Play for Cuba", she did not bdieve it at first. During President Kennedy's
visit to Mexico, she did not attend any of the functions that were held in
his honor and did not otherwise participate. In talking with her husband
when they learned of the assassination she said it could have been done by
radicals and when Lee Harvey OSWALD entered Into the discussion, she
recognized him as the same person that had come to the Cuban Consulate
about two months previous to request a transit visa to Russia.

1l. She remembered his name because of his unusual characteristics
and the circumstances of his visit L.e., he was married to a Russlan and
sald he belonged to the "Falr Play for Cuba"; that she checked his data in
the Consulate's archives and she was then sure that it was the same person.
That he ts blond, short, poorly dressed, that his face gets red when he
talks; that he was denled a visa because the Consul told him that in order
to obtain one he would first need a visa from the Russian Consulate and this
procedure would take about four months and urged OSWALD to leave
Mexico. OSWALD became angry and for this reason she had to call the
Consul with whom he had an argument. That OSWALD was told that the
aid which could be given to him was to advise him to go to the Russian Con-
sulate. The Consul then spoke by telephone to the person in charge of that
office, and was informed that the case would have to be referred to Moscow
and that there would be a four month delay. That In the afternoon of the
same day Lee Harvey OSWALD returned to the Cuban Consulate and that
she confirmed that he would only be given a visa when he had one from the
Russian Consulate glving him, on # plece of paper, her name Silvia DURAN
with the office telephone number but that OSWALD was not given her address
since he had no reason to have it. That it was not her place to telephone
the Russian Consulate and If she did it was in an official form and to help
Lee OSWALD in the interest of performing her duties. That if she gave
him her telephone number It wag so that he could later ask if the visa had
been obtained, but he never called again.

12. It should be mentioned that in the home at which the DURANS
were detained, Herodoto No, 14, Dept. "A", house of the brother-in-law
of Silvia DURAN, Ruben DURAN Navarro, the persons that were visiting

_this home were detained; thelr antecedents follow:
