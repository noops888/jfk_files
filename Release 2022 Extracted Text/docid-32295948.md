instituted by. CARLOS MARCELLO to protect his gambling
operations at the Riverside. Drive Inn. which is the

was arranged by MARCELLO but assumed it was through
contacts which MARCELLO has in Baton Rouge, Louisiana,
whose identities are not known to T-2. ‘He advised

e, Jefferson Parish, who may have seme interest

tween CARLOS MARCELLO and ROME” According to T-2, :
