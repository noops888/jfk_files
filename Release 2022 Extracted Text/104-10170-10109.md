(U) Background:

a .

Subject submitted a request under FOlA, on

22 March 1976, for any and all information the

held on "A Quaker Action Group" also known as "AOAG."

In the 20 July 1976 initial response, 24 newspaper

"clippings

and one leaflet were released to him; two

ducuments were denied.

On 23 August 1976 Subject appealed,

requesting

that further information be relcased to him on

the group.

c. During

the appeals review ll additional documents

were located and are included in the recommendations

below. These documents were not considered during the initial

they were not considered to meet the criteria

"records" extant at that time and they contained only

incidental references to the subject of the request.

d.

During the appeals review we were unable to

identify any Air Force documents concerning the subject

of this request.

The requester should be told that this

was apparently an error.

c.

During the appeals review we were unable to

identify any Department

of State documents concerning

The requestor should be

classification review has been conducted and all documents

are considered properly classified and marked in accordance

with E. 0. 11652, as amended.

b. I recommend that the two documents denied in toto

under the initial review continue to be denied.

One of
