2. (U) Background:

a. Subject submitted a request under FOIA, on
22 March 1976, for any and al! information the Agency
held on'"A Quaker Action Group" also known as "AQAG.”
In the 20 July 1976 initial response, -24 newspaper

“Clippings and.onefeafltet were released to him; two

documents were denied.

b.- On-23 August 1976 Subject appealed, requesting
that further. information be released to him on the group.

iDuring the appeals review 11 additional. documents

“were docated-and are included in-the recommendations

below. These documents were not considered during the initial
Teview since thcy were not considered to meet the criteria

for “records” extant at that time and they contained only
incidental references to the subject of the request.

d, During the appeals review we were unable to
identify any Air Force documents concerning the subject
of this request. ‘The requester should be told that this

was apparently an error.

ec. During the appeals review we were unablo to
identify any Yepartment of State documents concerning
A Quaker Action Group. Two State documents located, and
possibly referred to in the initial response, do not
concern A Quaker Action Group. The requestor should be
informed that this was also apparently an error.

|
|

3. (C) Recommendations:

Ja. “My specific recommendations are shown on the
Appeals Reviow Form attached to each document. A
classification review has been conducted and all documents
are considered properly classified and marked in accordance
with E,Q, 11652, as amended,

b.. T recommend that the two documents denied in toto
under the initia! review continue to be denied. One of
them (Tab 3) could identify a still active and sensitive
source, The other (Tab 4) was obtained through a sensitive
operation conducted jointly by. American and German
authorities.
