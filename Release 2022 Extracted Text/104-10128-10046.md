COMMUNICATIONS INTELLIGENCE DEBRIEFING OATH

I am aware that, since it has been determined that I no longer
require Communications Intelligence in the performance of my official
duties, my right to see this material and have access to information
pertinent to it has ceased. Pursuant to the obligation which I incurred,
under oath, at the time of my indoctrination for Communications Intel -
ligence, I reaffirm that I will never hereafter divulge any information
which I have acquired as an authorized recipient or producer of Com-
munications Intelligence, nor discuss with any person any of the infer-
ences concerning Communications Intelligence which I have been enabled
(through knowledge acquired by me by virtue of that status)sto form, unless
and until freed from this obligation by unmistakable categorical official
notice from authority competent in the premises.

Sworn to before me this
