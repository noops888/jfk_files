In a meeting with KRHOLLY/8 on 17 December, in addition to the

routine discussion and passage of information on the Soviet Bloc people,

presented KRHOLLY/& with a memo (based on Headquarters 776)

requesting information on and

destined for Africa and were likely to visit Lagos. This was given after

members of the "Curiel Apparat" and were using Nigeria,

and any other group or person, such as NKRUMAH, to further their Commnistic

goals and that he would be well advised to look into the activities of these

people and contacts, since they were undoubtedly involved in subtersion and

using their jobs and assistance to the FMG as a cover for their real aims.

HRHOLLY/8 was aroused and said that he would definitely get onto this matter.

He then volunteered that a "Carmichael" had been in Lagos a few months ago

involved with MICHAOS target personalities.

Our records indicate the Charge'

at the present time is:

James Duro Olufemi SOKOYA; born 1933 at Ojowo,

Iebu-Igbo; one of ten Nigerians to attend a course for diplomats (Interna-

tional law and French lessons) in Geneva, based on a bilateral program for

technical assistance.

SOKOYA was Assistant Chief of Protocol before his

present assignment and, according to the INCUFF Assistant Political Officer,

was very friendly and helpful to INCUFF.
