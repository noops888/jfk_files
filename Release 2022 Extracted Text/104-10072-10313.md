1, Following recent visit, the Station had a much better
of MECHAOS activities. This dispatch is a round-up of our most recent
ns against this targe

2. In a meeting with KRHOLLY/8 on 17 December, in addition to the
reutine discussion and passage of information on the Soviet Bloc people,
presented KREOLLY/8 with a memo (based on Headquarters 776)
requesting information on and of the MHCHAOS group who were
Gestined for Africa and were likely to visit Lagos. This was given after
had briefed KRHOLIY/8 on the

icating the advocation of violence of eath group and the nééd-forts to

p track of their external movements to enable_us to tect the stability
of our country as he was trying to do in his,

cubyheiposss. y of

OLLY/S said that this would be a difficult problem because
y US people picked up visas in other countries such as Italy, France,

ana, etc. then asked if he could, at a minimum, push for the

lation of just as he did with the Soviets, since

in soze cases the could present a threat to his country as

well as our own am tha’ y compiling such travel data and monitoring their

vities centrally, perhaps we would both benefit from the effort. He

seemed agreeable and said he vould attempt to do what he could personally
and would bring Ss up with his hierarchy.

working with them vie Sam IKCKU and the Ministry of Information) were Imo:
neabers of the "Curiel Apparat" and were using Nigeria, =
and eny other group or person, such as NKRUMAH, to further their Commmistic
goals and that he would be well advised to look into the activities of these
and contacts, since they were undoubtedly involved in subversion and
g their jobs and assistance to the FMG as a cover for their real ains.
LLY/8 was aroused and said that he would definitely get onto this matter,
a volunteered thet a "Carmichael" had been in Lagos a few months ago
» upon guestioning, he said he didn't know if it was "Stokely" or his
then told him that this was a case in point and that if
he bad any system of monitoring these people he could help us run down Inéwn
als, just as we would help them run down any criminals that landed in

" our country.

4, As noted above, KRHOLLY/8 seemed eager and willing to assist, but
it is dubious that he will be able to make eny real progress on his om or
convinee his superiors to make a concerted and formal effort to provide us
with the information we would like to have, especially the follow-up locally
of activities of MICHAOS people when they arrive and start moving around

However, the initial reaction was positive and perhaps if we keep
ing away, we can make a break-through in this area.

5. reported that the Nigerian Charge' in Algiers had been
involved with MECHAQS target personalities,
at the present time is:
Tev

Our records indicate the Charge’
James Duro Olufemi SOKOYA; born 1933 at Ojows,
-Igbo; one of ten Nigerians to end a course for diplomats (Interna-
ral law and French lessons) in Geneva, based on a bilateral program for
tectmical assistance. SOKOYA was Assistant Chief of Protocol before his
present assignment and, according to the INCUFF Assistant Political Officer,
was very friendly and helpful to LNCUFP.
