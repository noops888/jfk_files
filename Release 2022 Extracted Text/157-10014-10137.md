Box v9

The “Executive Action" Capability

Along with the question of authorization for actual assas-
sination attempts, the Committee considered the extent and nature
of authorization for a cIA project which included, as one element,
“the deve lopment of an assassination capability. ,
(a) Introduction
Sometime in early 1961, Richard Bissell (Deputy Director

of Plans) instructed William Harvey, who was at chat time the
Chief of one of CIA's Foreign Intelligence staffs, to establish

an “executive action capability” which included research into a
capability to assassinate foreign leaders. (Bissell 6/9/75, p. 51;
Harvey. 6/25/75, pp- 36-37.) At some time within the same period,
Bissell and McGeorge Bundy (Special Assistant to the President for

National Security Affairs) had a conversation about the matter,

Bissell, Harvey and Helms all agreed that the “seneralized”

capability was never used" (Bissell 6/9/75, p. 87; Harvey 6/25/75,
7p. 45; Helms 6/13/75, p. 52).
“Executive action" isa CIA euphemism, défined by the
” testimony before the Committee as a project for ‘research into :
developing means for ‘overthrowing foreign political leaders, inelud-
ing a “capability to perform assassinations". (Harvey 6/25/75, :
p. 36.) Bissell indicated that executive action covered a "wide
spectrum of actions” to “eliminate the effectiveness" of foreign

,

Leaders, with assassination as the "mest extreme" action on the

spectrum (Bissell, 7/22/75; p. 32). The Inspector General's Réport

described executive action as a “general stand-by capability to
carry out. assassination when required (1.G., p. 37). The project
was given the code name ZR/RIFLE by the CIA.*

A single agent ("asset"), given the eryptonym Q3/WIN,
was placed under Harvey's supervision for the ZR/RIFLE project;
but never used in connection with any actual assassination efforts.
Richard Helms described. QJ/WIN's "capability":
“If you needed somebody to carry out murder, I guess you
had_a_man who might be prepared to carry it out." (Helms,

6/13/75, p» 53).

Harvey did use agent QJ/WIN, however, to spot “individuals

-with criminal and underworld connections in Europe for possible

multi-purpose use" (Harvey, 6/25/75, p. 50). For example, QJ/WIN:
reported that a potential asset in the Middle East was "the leader

of a gambling syndicate" with "an available-pool of assassins"

(CIA file, 2R/RIFLE/Personality Sketches). . . : i

However, Harvey testified that:

“during the entire existence of the ‘entire ZRRIFLE project
we no agent was recruited for the purpose of assassina-
tion, and no even tentative targeting or target list was
ever drawn." - (Harvey, 6/25/75, p.. 45.)

Project ZR/RIFLE involved,’ generally, assessing the
problems and requirements of assassination and developing a-stand-

* 2R/RIFLE was a cryptonym relating to two programs. One was
the executive action assassination capability. The other was
another program which is not part of the subject matter of this
report: (William Harvey had been in charge of the CIA section
with general responsibility-for such programs.) This second
program was genuine, but it was also to provide a.cover. for: any
executive action operation. (Harvey, 6/25/75, p.'49.) —

MW 50955 Dochd:3242352% Page 4


by assassination capability; more specifically, it involved.
“spotting” potential agents and “researching” assassination:
techniques that might be used (Bissell, 7/17/75, p. 11 and 6/9/75,
p. 73; Harvey, 6/25/75, pp. 37-A, 45). Bissell characterized
Project ZR/RIFLE as “internal and purely preparatory" (Bissell,
7/22/75, p. 32). The 1.G. Report’ of 1967 found “no indication

in the file that the Executive Action Capability of ZR/ RIFLE -
QU/WIN was ever used", but said that "after’ Harvey took over the
Castro operation, he ran it as one aspect of ZR/RIFLE". (1.6.

pp. 40-41.)*

(b) The Question of White House Initiation, Authorization,
or Knowledge of the Executive Action Project

There is. general agreement on one fact: at some point in
early 1961 Bissell discussed the executive action capability with.

_ Bundy. The timing of that conversation and whether "the White i

House" urged that a capability be created were matters on which

_the evidence varied widely. :
Harvey testified that Bissell had told him that "the
-White House" “had twice urged the creation of such a capability.
and the Inspector General's Report quoted notes of Harvey's (no
longer in existence) to that effect. Bissell did not recall. any
specific conversation with the "White House". ‘However, his initial
testimony assumed the correctness of Harvey" s notes,. and stated
Soe A discussion of whether. ZR/RIFLE was related to the actual

gogessination ¢ efforts against Castro is found at Section (d),
anira .

HW 50955 DocId:32423525 Page 5


that, while he could have created the capability on his own, any
-urgings would have come from Bundy or Walt Rostow. In a later
appearance, however, Bissell said he merely informed Bundy of
the capability and that the context was a briefing by him and
not urging) by Bundy. Bundy said he received a briefing and?!
gave no urging, though he raised no objections. Rostow said he
never heard of the project.

William Harvey testified that he was "almost certain"
that on January 25 and 26, 1961, he met.with CIA officials Sidney
Gottlieb, the new Chief of CIA's Technical Services Division, and
Arnold Silver, a CIA recruiting officer, to discuss the feasibility
of creating a capability within the Agency for "executive action".
(Harvey, 6/25/75, p. 52). After reviewing his notes of those

meetings,*: Harvey testified that they took place after his initial

i

* As to the date ef these notes, Harvey was asked whether his no-
tations "25/1-Sid G" and "26/1-AS" indicate that he spoke to Sidney

Gottlieb and Arnold Silver in 1961, as opposed to 1962, Harvey testi-
fied as follows: . :

Q: “And is it your judgment that that is January 26, 1961 and
is about the subject of Executive Action? :

Harvey: Yes, it is.

Q: And it followed your conversation with Mr. Bissell. that jl
you have recounted?

Harvey:” . .,. [W]ell, when I first looked at this, 1 thought .
this, well, this has got to be '62, but I am almost certain

now that it is not. If this is true, this might place the

first discussion that I. had with Dick Bissell in early
" January and this is difficult to pinpoint because there were

several such discussions in varying degrees of detail during

the period in’ the spring, and very early in '61 to the fall

of '61 period, but i did find out fairly early on that Silver

HW 50955 - DocTd:32423525 Page 6 ~


discussion of executive action with Bissell, which, he said,
might have transpired in “early January" (Harvey, 6/25/75, p.
52). When Bissell was shown these notes, he ‘agreed with Harvey

about the timing of their initial discussion (Bissell, 7/17/75,

p. 10).

had -~°or that Bissell had discussed the question of assassi-
nation with Arnold Silver, and this discussion, at the very
least, had to take place after I know Bissell already had
discussed the matter with Silver. (Harvey, 6/25/75, p. 52).

Harvey had also testified that, after receiving Bissell's initial in-
“structions to establish an executive action capability:

the first thing I did’. .°. was discuss in theoretical
terms with a few officers whom I trusted quite implicitly
the whole subject. of assassination, ‘our possible assets;
our posture, going back, if you will, even to the funda-
mental questions of A, is-assassination a proper weapon
of an American intelligence service, and IB, even if you
assume that it is, is it within our capability within

the framework of this government to do it effectively.
and properly, securely and discreetly. -(Harvey, 6/25/75,
pp. 37-A, 38). : :

~ the Inspector General's Report connected Silver and Gottlieb to the
early stages. of the executive action project as follows:

. Harvey says that’ Bissell had already discussed certain
aspects of the problem with Arnold Silver and with Sidney
Gottlieb. Since Silver was already cut in, Harvey -used
him in developing the Executive Action Capability. ...
Harvey's mention of him [Gottlieb} in this ‘connection
may explain a notation by ‘Dr. Gunn that Harvey instructed
Gunn to discuss techniques with Gottlieb without associa-
ting the discussion with the Castro operation. ((1.G.
Report, “pp. 37-38).

It is evident from the testimony of Harvey and Bissell that the turn-
= over to Harvey of the Roselli contact in November 1961 was discussed
‘aS part of ZRRIFLE (see Section (d), infra). Thus, their initial
discussion of- executive action can, at the Least, “be dated before
November 1961 and the "25/1" and "26/1" notations would have to.
refer to.January 1961.

HW 50955 DocId:32423525 Paye 7


Harvey testified that the “executive action! capability.
was intended to include assassinations (Harvey, 6/25/75, p. 35).
His cryptic handwritten notes of the January 25/26 meetings, pre-'
served at the CIA, contain phrases which suggest a discussion of .
assassination--and Harvey confirmed this interpretation: “last
resort beyond last resort and a confession of weakness", "the
“magic button", and "never mention.word assassination’. (Harvey,

Ex. 1,.6/25/75)

The Inspector General's Report did not mention these
notes, or their dates. -However, in describing Richard Bissell's
initial assignment of the “executive action" project te Harvey, -
it referred to another set of Harvey's notes, which were destroyed
after the preparation of the Repore. The excerpt from these notes

quoted Bissell as saying to Harvey, "The White House had twice

urged me to create such a capability" (1.G:, P. 37). “Harvey ‘also!

testified that this "urging" was mentioned in his initial d s-

: cussion of "executive action" with Bissell (Harvey, 6/25/75, ‘p. 37).
However, the- testimony from Bissell and White House aides ‘in the
“Kennedy and Eisenhower Administrations “is in conflict with Harvey!s.
testimony as to whether such ‘urging’ had in fact been given to

Bissell.

* Harvey's notes also contained a-phrase which suggests his con-
cern that any U.S. assassination attempts might breed retaliation
from other governments: “dangers of RIS (Russian Intelligence
Service) countér-action and monitor if they are blamed." (Harvey,
Ex. 1, 6/25/75; Bissell, Ex. 1, 7/17/75). :

HW 50955 Docld:32423525 ‘Page 8


The following testimony regarding the relationship
between "the White House" and the executive action capability
was obtained by the Committee: , :

- | Harvey: Harvey testified that his missing notes indica=-
ted that Bissell mentioned white House urgings to develop an execu-
tive action capability (Harvey, 6/25/75, p. 37). Harvey said that
he “particularly remember[ed]" that Bissell said that he received
“more than one" urging from the White House (llarvey, 6/25/75,
pp. 36-37; 7/1is75, p.-59).. However, he had no direct evidence
that Bissell actually had any such discussion with “the White House."
Wo specific individual in the White House was named to Harvey
(Harvey, 6/25/75, p. 31). Moreover, he said that it would have been

y “improper" for him to have asked Bissell who he had talked to and’
“grossly improper" for Bissell to have volunteered, thar name i
+ Qlarvey, 6/25/75, p. 37). : -

Bissell: - Bissell specifically, vecalled asst

“to investigate the capability (Bissell, 6/9/75, p. 51). However,
_Bissell did not recall "a specific conversation with anybody in
the White House. as the origin" of his instruction to, Harvey (Bissell,
6/9/75, p. 51).
During the course of several appearanées before the
Committee, Bissell's testimony varied as to whether or not he had
been urged by rhe White House to develop an executive action

capability.

HW 50955 DocTd:32423525 Page 9


In his initial appearances before the Committee on June 9 and
11, 1975, Bissell made statements that tended to indicate that White
House authorization had been given. In response to the ' “twiée urged"

: quotation of Harvey's notes in the Inspector General's Reporc,
Bisseli said, “I have no reason to believe that Harvey's quote is
wrong.” (Bissell, 6/9/75, p. 51). Bissell accordingly said jin his .
initial testimony that as far as he knew, it was true that he was
asked by the White House to create a general stand-by, assassination
capability. (Bissell, 6/9/75, p. 49).

Based again upon Harvey's missing notes ("White House urging")
and his initial statement chae he had no reason to challenge their
accuracy, Bissell initially gave the opinion that HeGeorge Bundy
(Id., 6/9/75, p. 49), Special Assistant to President Kennedy for
National Security Affairs, and Wait Rostow (Id., p, 51), Deputy

S“ Assistant to President. Kennedy during 1961, were the two people from
whom such a request was most Likely to have’ come da., Pp: 53) because
"they were. "the two members of the White House staf£ who were closest
to CIA operations," 7 Cd., p. 54)2 .

. At another point in his initial testimony, Bissell. said that

the creation of the capability "may have been initiated within the

Agency" (Id., p. 81). And still later he said: “there is little ;

doubt in my mind that Project RIFLE was discussed with Rostow and

possibly Bundy" (Bissell, 6/11/75, p. 46).

When Bissell returned to the Committee on July 17 and 22, his

testimony, given in light of information gained since his’ earliér

RW.50955 DocId:32423525 Page 10


appearances, was that there was no White House urging. for the creation

of the executive action project, although tacit approval for the

“research” project was probably given by Bundy after it was 3 established.
First, he was shown the Harvey notes ‘which had bee preserved

and which, without any mention of the White House, indicated liarvey

had received his assignment prior to January 25/26, 1961. ‘Those

dates -- just 5 days after the change of administration -- made
Bissell conclude that-it was "very unlikely that that, assignment

to {Harvey was taken as a result of White House urging or consul-
tation" (Bissell, 7/17/75, p. 10). Bissell said that Bundy. did

not have any influence on the performance of his’ Agency duties before
the Presidential inauguration (Bissell, 7/22/75, p. 23). Bissell
added that he did not remember meeting with anyone in the new ad-
ministration on matters prior to the inauguration (Bissell, | 7/22/75,

p23).

Second, when he returned in July, Bissell also said he was con-

vinced -by telephone conversations with Kostow and Bundy that ‘based

“upon Rostow's duties. -- which, in 1961, had nothing to do with

covert action ~- he ‘mever discussed" executive action with Rostow

(Bissell, 7/17/75, p. 10; “7/27175, p. 22).

As for bundy, Bissell's final testimony (after telephone con-
tact with Bundy) was that he believed that he had informed Bundy ‘
about the capability after at had been’ created (Bissell, 7/17/75,
pp. 1o- Ll; 7/22/75, Pp. 21-22). “Bue Bissell confirmed his original °

testimony (6/9/75, pp. ) that he did not brief Bundy on ‘the

actual assassination plots against Castro already undertaken by the
CIA (Bissell, 6/11/75, p. 47; 7/22/75, p. 31). Bissell was "quite
certain” that he would not have expected Bundy to mention the
executive action capability to the President. (Bissell, 7/22/75,
p. 35). “Bissell testified:

Q. Would you think the development of a capability. to

kill foreign leaders was a matter of sufficient impor~-_. ~

tance to bring to the attention of the President? . .

Bissell: In that context and at that time and given the

limited scope of activities within that project, I would

not." (Bissell, 7/22/75, p. 35).

Bissell said that he and Bundy . spoke about an untargeted
“capability" rather than the plan or approval for an assassination
operation (Bissell, 7/17/75, p. 11). Bissell said that although:

he does not have a specific recollection, he "might have" mencioned

Castro, Lumumba, and Trujillo in the course of a discussion of

executive action "because these were the sorts of individu.

that moment in ‘history. against whom such a capability might. possibly

have been employed." (Bissell, 6/11/75, pp. 50-51).
; Bissell said his impression was that “Bundy, in addition to ex-
. pressing no unfavorable reaction to thé project, might have actually
given a more affirmative reaction (Bissell, 7/22/75, pp. 25, 28).
Bissell testified that he might have interpreted Bundy 's reaction

as approval for the executive. action concept (Bissell, 7/22/75, Pp. 30).
Q: oe I.think the testimony of this witness is foing
further in saying what you received from (Bundy) was,
in your view, tantamount: ‘to approval?

- Bissell: I, at least, interpreted it as you.can call -
it approval, or you could say no objection. He (Bundy)

: Cx

HW 50955 Docid:32423525 Page 12


-il-

was briefed oh something that was being done, as I now
believe, on the initiative of the Agency. llis (Bundy 's)
comment is that he made no objection to it. I suspect
that his reaction was somewhat more’ favorable than that,
but this is a matter that probably someone listening to
the conversation on which such a person could have had
differing interpretations. (Bissell, 7/22/75, p. 33).°

Bissell's testimony on any conversation with Bundy regarding!
executive action was. speculative reconstruction from first appearance 7
to last because he had no “clear recollection" of the events (Bissell,
7/22/75, pp. 29, 36). Bue ‘Bissell maintained that more "formal and
specific and explicit approval would have been required" before any
“actual overt steps in use of .the capability." (Bissell, 7/22/75,

“p. 31). : ‘

Bissell said that Harvey's notation about White House urgings
to develop an executive action capability may have been a slightly:
confused account of a conversation subsequent to the initiation of i
=. the project in which Bissell relayed Bundy's reaction to larvey

(Bissell, 7/22/75, p. 25). :
_ Bissell testified that the development of an executive action
,capability was “undoubtedly” initiated-within the Agency (Bissell,
7/22/75,.p. 22)... He had acknowledged of his first day of testimony

that this’ would not have been ‘unusual:

it was the normal practice in the Agency and an impor-
tant part of its mission to create various kinds of
capability long before there was any reason to be certain
whether those would be used or where or how or for what -
purpose. -.The whole ongoing job of ..) a secret intelli-

~ gence service of recruiting agents is of that character...,
‘So it would not be particularly surprising to.me if the «

HW 50955 Docld:32423525 Page 13


-12-

decision to create ... this capability had been taken
without an outside request. (Bissell, 6/9/75, pp. 67-68)

Bund, : - ticGeorge Bundy also testified that he had a conversation
with Bissell, during which the executive action capability was dis~
cussed (Bundy, pp. 4-5). - Bundy's testimony comports with
Bissell's on the fact that they spoke about an untargeted capability,
rather ‘than an assassination. operation (Bundy, pp. 4-5). But Bundy

said that the capability included "killing the individual" .(Bundy,

p. 5) Bundy's impression was that the CIA was "testing my reaction,"

not "seeking authority” (Bundy; p. 1d). Bundy summarized his testi-

‘mony by saying:

I am gure I gave no instruction. But it.is only fair to
add that I do not recall that I offered any impediment
either. (Bundy, p. 10) ,
Bundy said that he did not take steps to halt the development ‘of
the executive action capability or "pursue the matter at all" (Bundy,

p. 19) because he was satisfied

that this was not ‘an operational activity, and would not |
become such without two conditions: . first, that there

be a desire or.a request or a guidance that there. should
be planning against some specific individual; and second,
that there should be a decision to move against the indi-
vidual. (Bundy, p. 7). :

* For example, Bissell testified that on his own initiative, he
had requested a CIA officer to go to. the Congo to "make plans ‘and

develop the-~¢apability" for an assassination attempt inst
if ordered (Bissell, 6/11/75, p. 55). De 2g atns Manama

- ** Bundy also testified that he had a vague recollection of hearing
about poison in relation to Cuba, but he did-not connect this to the
“conversation about executive action. (See footnote, p. 6, Kentedy
Pre-Bay of Pigs section, supra.)

Bundy testified that he believed that neither of these conditions had
been fulfilled (Bundy, p. 7).

Bundy recalled the conversation as taking place “sometime in the
early months of 1961." (Bundy, p. 4). When questioned about the,
dates in Harvey's notes, Bundy rated the chance that the conversation
about executive. action took place before January 25 -- when Harvey
was already discussing the project at the CIA pursuant to Bissell’s
directive -- as "near gerd" because the new Administration had:been
in office less than a week and he had been preoccupied with other
problems, including the Berlin crisis and reorganizing the National
Security staff (Bundy, p. 9). :

Bundy testified that he did not brief the President on the
executive action project: . . - : :

Chairman; And you have testified that you did. net take
the-matter to the President? ., te

Bundy: As fat as T can recall, Mr. Chairman.
(Bundy, p. 16) -

Bundy explained that the division of responsibility for national
_security affairs excluded Rostow fron jurisdiction over covert opera-
tions, making it unlikely that Rostow would be briefed on a “project”
like ZRRIFLE (Bundy, p. Li; Rostow, p. 11).

Rostow: Rostow testified that he was “morally certain" that
during his eritire tenure in government, he never heard a reference
to executive action or "such a capability or such an intention to

act by -the U.S." (Rostow, pp. 10, 13):

“HW 50955 Docld:32423525 Page 15

Goodpaster_and Gray: The responsibility for national security
affairs during the latter part of the Eisenhower Administration. was
borne by Andrew Goodpaster and Gordon Gray. However, there was no
evidence which raised the name of either man in connection with the
development of an executive action capability. Both Goodpaster and
.Gray testified to having no knowledge of it. (Goodpaster, p. 11;

Gray, p.. 56.)

“(e) Authorization or Knowledge of Executive Action Project
by DCL :
Richard Bissell’'said he was "quite certain" that Allen
Dulles had fuil knowledge of the executive. action project for two.
reasons: first, it "would have come to the DCI's attention" at the.
time of the transfer of Willian Harvey between components of the

J Agency to work on Cuban operations ;* and second, Bissell “would

imagine’ it was mentioned to Dulles at the initiation of thé project
. : i

(Bissell, 7/22/75, p. 35}. Bissell and Harvey briefed Richard lielms
on Project ZRRIFLE when he became -DDP (Bissell, 6/VL/75, peiS3t Harvey,
“7/11/75, p.' 63). But Bissell did not recall briefing John MeCone’
_about the project when McCone tock over as DCL (Bissell, 7/17/75,
p 11). McCone testified chat he had'no knowledge of such a project
(McCone, p.° 43). a
William Harvey said it was assumed that the project was
within the parameters permitted by the DCL, But Uarvey testified

that officially advising the DCL of the existence of the project

late in 1961. ; :

. (d) The Question of Whether Project ZRREELE was Connected
Co Any Actua Assassination Plots

4 velopment’ of an executive action capability was related ‘in any way. to
= the actual assassination efforts. One question raised by this
i inquiry is whether the Participants ip the &8sassination Operations
might have Perceived the executive action capability as in’ some way
j lending legitimacy to the actual assassination efforts
~ (i) Conversation Between Bissell and Bundy

eo “and Trujillo with anyone in the White House in the Course of discussing
‘the Project to develop an executive action capability (Bissell, 16/11/75,
RP. 51), However, Bissell testified that it was "perfectly Plausible
that I would have used examples” (Bissell; 6/11/75, P. 51). Ne con-

tinued:

in such a discussion of a Capability, 7 might well have
used the three names that I just Save, because these were °
the sorts of “individuals at that moment in history against
whom such 4 Capability might POSsibly have been employed |"
: (Bissell; 6/11/75, PB. 51), :

Bissell and Bundy both testified, however, that

tion did not involve any mention of actual assassination Plans or

‘is no testimony to the contrary. The account of this conversa-—
tion raises a question as to whether Bissell. acted properly ‘in
withholding, from Bundy the fact that assassination efforts ;
against Castro had already been mounted and were moving forward.
Bundy was responsible to a new President for national security
affairs and Bissell was his principal source of information about.

covert operations at the CIA.

(ii) Bisséli's Instruction to Take Over Responsibility:
. for Underworld Contact: “November 1967 °

Both Bissell and Harvey recall a meeting in November

1961 in which Harvey was imstructed to take over the contact with

John Roselli (Bissell, 6/11/75, pp. 19, 47; Harvey, 6/25/75, p. 86;

‘and 6/11/75, p. 19)--which had been used for the initial poison pill
_ plot as part of Project ZR/RIFLE. Warvey's notes placed the meeting
on November 15, 1961.(1.G., p. .39), during the period in which Harvey
was freed from his duties on another Agency staff to take over
"direction of Task Force W, the locus of CIA activity against ‘the :
_Castro regime. ts : —

According ‘to Bissell and Harvey, the November meeting
involved only. the planning and research ofa capability rather than
a targeted operation against castro (Bissell, 7/17/75, p. 13;

.Harvey, 7/11/75, p. 60). But Bissell acknowledged that the purpose |

of the Roselli contact: had been to assassinate Castro, and that. "it,

is a fair inference that there would have been no reason to maintain

it [the contact] unless there was some possibility of reactivating,
that operation" (Bissell, 6/11/75, p. 19). Bissell stated that

because the assassination plot against Castro involving the syndicate

had been stood down after the Bay of Pigs . . . and there
was no authorization to pursue it actively ... . the re
.sponsibility that was given to him [Harvey] was that of
taking over an inactive contact.” (Bissell, 7/17/75, p. 14)

Bissell said that he had, in effect, asked Harvey to stand watch over

the contact in case any action should be required and further testi-

fied that it was never required:

The Inspector General's Report stated: “after
Marvey took over the.Castro operation, he ran it as one aspect
of ZRRIFLE.""” (1.G., P. 40) . Harvey recalled that during a dis-
cussion with Bissell of the creation of an executive action capability,

Bissell advised him of "a then going: operation" involving the’ names

“of Maheu and possibly Roselli‘ and Giancana, “which was a part. of the

Agency's effort to develop... a capability for executive action."

“(larvey, 7/11/75, pp. 55, 61). Harvey said that at the time of

this discussion, the operation had been "in train" for "approxi-
mately two years or perhaps -18 months." (larvey, 7/11/75, p. 54)<
Although his "net impression" was that both the

“exploratory project" and the"specific operation" were “Fully

‘ authorized and approved", Harvey said he could not testify that

“specific White House authority for this given operation was implied
or stated". (Harvey, 7/11/75, p. 54.) Bissell does net recall

telling anyone in the White House that something had been done ‘to

WW 50955 DocId:32423525 Page 19


-18-

bring a CIA officer together with the criminal syndicate (Bissell,

6/11/75, pp. 19-20). Harvey did not recall any mention of the

White House or any higher authority than the DDP in his Novémber

meeting with Bissell (Harvey, 7/11/75, pp. 60-61). , ,

. Although Richard. Helms was briefed and given
administrative responsibility (as DDP) for Project ZR/RIFLE: three
months later, he did not recall that- ZR/RIFLE was ever contemplated
as a capability to assassinate Castro (Helms, 6/13/75, p. 55).
Asked whether the actual assassination efforts against Castro were
related to ZR/RIFLE (executive action), Helms testified: "In my.
mind those lines never crossed" (Helms, 6/13/75, p. 52). However,
Bissell's testimony leaves more ambiguity: "the contact with the
syndicate which had Castro as its target . . . folded into the

: 2R/ RIFLE project’. .. and ‘they became one" (Bissell, 6/11/75,

- p. 47). -When asked by Senator Baker whether the executive action; !

“capability . .. for assassination" was “used against Castro"
_Bisseli replied that it was "in the later phase". (Bissell, '6/11/75,
p. 47). The instruction from Bissell to Harvey on November 15,
-1961, however, preceded the reactivation of the CIA-syndicate assas~

‘ination operation against Castro by approximately five months .

(iii) Use of Agent. QJ/WIN in Africa
QJ/WIN was a foreign citizen with a criminal back-
ground’ who had’ been recruited by the CIA for certain sensitive ~

. programs involving surreptitious entries which pre-dated Project

HW 50955 DocId:32423525 Page 20


“19-

ZR/RIFLE. Harvey testified that QJ/WIN’s function after the advent
of Project ZR/RIFLE in 1961 was restricted to the "spotting" of
potentiai assets for "multi-purpose" covert use.

However, in the Fall of 1960--before Harvey was
assigned to create Project ZR/RIFLE by Richard Bissell--agent
QJ/WIN had been dispatched to the Congo by Arnold Silver, his
supervising CIA case officer in Europe. William Harvey, as: the
Chief of the CIA Foreign Intelligence staff on which Silver, worked
had ordered QJ/WIN's mission to the Congo (CIA Dispatch AUDW-L47,
11/2/60) and arranged the financial accounting for the mission
afterward (Memorandum to Finance Division from William K. Harvey,
T/11/61). (QJ/WIN's activities in the Congo are treated in detail
in the discussion of the Lumumba case; see Section _, supra. ]

There are two factors which may raise a question as

«- to whether QJ/WIN was being used in an ad hoc capacity to develop”

an assassination capability before ZR/RIFLE was formally initiated.

_ First, there is a similarity in the cast of characters: Harvey,
QU/WIN, Silver, and Gottlieb were connected with the Lumumba matter
-and reappear in connection with the subsequent development of
“ZR/RIFLE. Second, Bissell informed Harvey that the development of
an assassination capability had already been discussed with Silver
and Gottlieb before Harvey's assignment to ZR/REFLE (Harvey, 6/25/75,
p. 52; L.G. Report, pp. 37-38).

Nevertheless, there does not: appear to be any firm
evidence of (a connection’ between QJ/WIN and the plot to assassinate

Lumumba.

Summary : August 28, 1975*

FINAL ‘DRAFT.

“Rafael Trujillo was assassinated by a group of Dominican dissidents on
May 30, 1961... ,

.. Trujillo was a brutal dictator, and both the Eisenhower and
Kennedy Administrations encouraged the overthrow of his regime by Dominican
dissidents. Toward that end the highest policy levels of both Administrations
approved or condoned supplying aims to the dissidents. Although there is no
evidence that the United States instigated any assassination activity, certain
evidence tends to link United States officials to the assassination
plans.

‘Material support, consisting of three pistols and three carbines, was
supplied “to various dissidents. While United States' officials knew that the
dissidents intended to overthrow Trujillo, probably by assassination, there
is no direct evidence that the weapons which were passed were used in the -

S assassination. The evidence is inconclusive as to how high in the two
Administrations information about the dissidents’ assassination plots
“had been passed prior to the spring of 1961.

Beginning in March of 1961, the dissidents began asking United States
officials for machine gums. By the time four M-3 machine guns were shipped to
the CIA Station Chief in the Dominican capitol in April, it was well know :
that the dissidents wanted them for use in connection with the assassination.
‘Thereafter, however, permission to deliver the machine gums to the dissidents
was denied, and the guns were never passed. ‘Two days before the assassination,

President Kennedy personally authorized a-cable to the U.S. Consul General

in the Dominican Republic stating that the United States government, as a
matter of general principle, could not condone political assassinations, but
at the same time indicating the United States continued to support the dissi-
dents“ and stood ready to recognize them in the event they were successful

in their endeavor to overthrow Trujillo.

HW 50955 Dockd:32423525 Page 23


i. Background

Rafael Trujillo came to power in the Dominican Republic
in 1930. For most of his tenure, the United States government
supported him and he was regarded throughout much of the’
Caribbean and Latin America as a protege of the united States.
Trujillo's rule, always harsh and dictatorial, became more
arbitrary during the 1950's. As a result, the United States ;
States' image was increasingly tarnished in the eyes of many
Latin Americans.

Increasing American awareness vf Trujillo's brutality:
and fear that it would lead to a Castro-type revolution caused
U.S. officials to consider various plans to hasten his abdi-
cation or downfall. ;

“As early as February 1960 the Eisenhower administration

gave high level consideration.to a program of covert aid to

“Dominican dissidents. (Special Group minutes, 2/10/60).

In April 1960 President Bisenhower approved a contingency plan
for the Dominican Republic which provided, in part, that if the
situation deteriorated still further:

".,.the United States would immediately take political action to
remove Trujillo from the ‘Dominican Republic as soon

as a suitable successor regime can be induced to take over
with the assurance of U.S. political, economic, and

~~ if necessary -- military support." (Memo. from
Secretary of State Herter to the President, 4/14/60;
Presidential approval indicated in Herter letter to
Secretary of Defense Gates, 4/21/60.)

Simultaneously, the United States was trying to organize

hemispheric opposition to the Castro regime in.Cuba.. Latin«

a

HW 50955

American leaders, such as President Betancourt of Venezuela,
pressed the United States to take affirmative action against
prujillo to dispel criticism that the U.S. opposed. dictator-
ships of the left only. A belief that Castro's road to power
was paved by the excesses of Batista led to concern that the
Dominican Republic might also eventually fall victim to a

Castro-style Communist regime. (Rusk, pp. 8,9}

Ii. Initial Contact with Dissidents and Request for Arms

During the spring of 1960, the 0.8. ambassador to the
Dominican Republic, Joseph Farland, made initial contact with
dissidents who sought to free their country from Trujillo's
grasp. They asked for sniper rifles. Although documentary
evidence indicates that a recommendation to provide these
rifles was approved both within the State Department and the

CIA, the rifles were never provided.

A. Dissident Contacts

Ambassador Farland established contact with a group of
' dissidents regarded as moderate, pro-U.S. ana desirous of
establishing a democratic form of government. * (Farland
affidavit) Prior to his final departure from the Dominican
Republic In May 1960, the Ambassador introduced his Deputy-Chief-

of-Mission, Henry Dearborn, to the dissident leaders, indicating: that

¥ Ghis Toosely-organized group, with which contact was es-
tablished, was referred to in cables, correspondence, and
memoranda as “the dissidents" and is so referenced herein.

‘|
uh

Dockd:32423525 Page 25


Dearborn could be trusted. Then on June 16, 1960, CIA
Headquarters* cabled a request that Dearborn become the "communi-
cations link” between the dissidents and CIA. The cable /Stated/
that Dearborn's role had the "unofficial approval of /Assistant
Secretary of State for Inter-American Affairs, Roy R,J Rubottom''
(Emphasis in original.) (HOS to Station cable 6/16/60).
Dearborn agreed. He requested, however, that the CIA
‘confirm the arrangement with the dissidents as being that the
U.S. would “clandestinely" assist the opposition to "develop
effective force to accomplish Trujillo overthrow," but would
not “undertake any overt action itself against Trujillo
government while it is in full control of Dominican Republic”

(Station to HQS cable. 6/17/60). CIA Headqaurters confirmed

Dearborn's understanding of the arrangement (HQS to Station

cable 6/19/60).

B. The Sniper Rifles
During the course ofa cocktail party in the Dominican
Republic, a leading dissident made a specific request to Ambas-
sador Farland for a limited number of rifles with telescopic
sights. The Ambassador promise@ to pass on the request {Farland

affidavit) He apparently did so after returning to Washington

in May 1960 (CIA memorandum for the record, 6/7/61),

. * As used herein “Headquarters” refers to wWeadquarters of the
\ Central Intelligency Agency; "Department" indicates the
Department of State. .

HW 50955 DocId:32423525 Page 26


Documents indicate that consideration was given within
the CIA to airdropping rifles into the Dominican Republic.
At a June 21, 1960, meeting with Ned Holman of the CIA
Western Hemisphere Division, Ambassador Farland reportedly
suggested possible sites for the drops.
(CIA memo, 6/21/60)
Documents also indicate that a meeting was held
around the end of June 1960 between Assistant Secretary
of State for Inter-American Affairs Roy R. Rubottom and
Col. J. C. King, Chief of CIA’s Western Hemisphere Division.
Apparently King sought to learn the Assistant Secretary's view
a regarding "To what extent will the U. S$. government participate
in the overthrow of Trujillo." A number of questions were
raised by King, among them:
. “e. Would it provide a small number of sniper rifles
or other devices for the removal of. key Trujillo People
from the scene?"
King's handwritten notes indicate that Rubottom's response to
that question was "yes" (CIA memo of 6/28/60; King affidavity~
On July 1, 1960, a memorandum directed to, General Cabell, the Acting
Director of Central Intelligence, was prepared for Colonel King's
signature and, in his absence, signed by his principal deputy,
Rudy Gomez (r. G. Report, p. 26). The memorandum stated that
a principal leader of the anti-Trujillo opposition had asked
Ambassador Farland for a limited number of arms to precipitate

Trujillo's overthrow, and recognized that such arins”

-* Neither King nor Rubottom: recalls such a meeting, nor does
either recall any proposal for seppnyang sniper, rifles.

HW 50955 Dockd:32423525 Page 27


HW 50955

“presumably would be used against key members of the Trujillo
regime.” The memorandum recommended that the arms be provided,
since the fall of the Trujillo regime appeared inevitable,

and therefore U.S. relations with the opposition should be as
close as possible. "Providing the arms as requested would

contribute significantly toward this end."

(CIA memo, 7/1/60)

Specifically, the recommendation was to deliver to dissidents

in the Dominican Republic 12 sterile* rifles with teles-
copic sights, together with 500 rounds of ammunition.
Paragraph 4 of the memorandum stated:
"4. Approval for delivery of these arms has
been given by Assistant Secretary of State
Roy Rubottom, who requests that the arms be

placed in hands of the opposition at the earliest
possible moment." (Id.}

Gomez’s’ recommendation was concurred in by Richard
Helms, as Acting DDP, and approved by General Cabell,
(1.G. Report, p. 26).

The kind of arms approved, “sterile rifles with
telescopic sights, together with thé statement that they would
be presumably used against key members of the Trujillo regime
clearly indicated the "targeted use“ for which the weapons were
intended. (Bissell, 7/22/75, p. 77).

On Taly 1, 1960, a cable was sent to Dearborn by CIA

Headquarters informing him of the plan to airdrop 12

telescopicaliy~sighted rifles into the Dominican Republic. The

"Sterile" rifles are “untraceable” rifles. (Bissell, 7/72/75,p.69)

Dockd:32423525 Page 28


cable inquired whether the dissidents had the capability to
realign the sights if thrown off by the drop. On July 14,
1960, Dearborn replied that the dissident leaders were against
any further action in the Dominican Republic until after re-
solution by the OAS of a Venezuelan complaint then pending
against Trujillo. The dissidents reportedly believed that
sufficiently strong action by the OAS could bring Trujillo's
downfall without further effort on their part. (Station to
HQS cable, 7/14/60) The 12 sniper rifles were never furnished
to the dissidents. :

On August 26, 1960, Dearborn cabled Deputy Assistant
Secretary of State Lester Mallory reporting on a meeting between
a dissident leader and John Barfield, the Consulate'’s political
officer. The dissident leader was reported to have lost
enthusiasm for an assassination attempt and was then speaking
of an invasion from Venezuela. However, by September 1, 1960,

- dissidents were again speaking about the possible provision to
them of arms. This time the request was for 200 rifles. For
the next several months, consideration centered on providing

200 to 300 guns.

‘IZ. Summer and Fall of 1960

In Angust 1960, the United States severed diplomatic
relations with the Dominican Republic and recalled most of its
personnel. Dearborn was left as Consul General and de facto

CIA Chief of Station. Consideration was given both ‘to providing

HW 50955 Docld:32423525 Page 29


arms and explosive devices and to the use of high level

emissaries to persuade Trujillo to abdicate. By the end of
the year, a broad plan of general support to anti-rujillo
forces, both within and without the country, was approved.

A. Diplomatic Development --
Withdrawal of U.S. Personnel

Events occurring during the summer of 1960 further in-
tensified hemispheric opposition to the Trujillo regime. In
June agents of Trujillo tried to assassinate Venezuelan Presi-
dent Betancourt. As a result, the OAS censured the Trujillo
government. At the same time, in August 1960, the United
States broke interupted diplomatic relations with the Dominican
Republic and imposed economic sanctions.

With the severance of diplomatic relations, the United

States closed its Embassy. -Most American personnel, including

‘the CIA Chief of Station, left the Dominican Republic. With
the departure of the CIA Chief of Station, Dearborn became

; de_ facto CIA Chief of Station and was recognized as such by
both CIA and the State Department. ~ Although on January 20,
1961, a new CIA Chief of Station came to the Dominican Republic,
Dearborn continued to serve as a link to the dissidents.

B. Dearborn Reports Assassination May be Only
Way to Overthrow Trujillo Regime

_ Dearborn came to believe that no effort to overthrow the

HW 50955 DoclId:32423525 Page 30


Trujillo government could be successful unless it involved
Trujillo's assassination.

He communicated this opinion to both the State Department and
the CIA, In July 1960, he advised Assistant Secretary Rubottom
tnat the dissidents were

«+. in ne way ready to carry on any type of revolutionary
activity in the foreseeable future except the
assassination of their principal enemy.”

(Dearborn to Rubottam letter, 7/14/60)
It is uncertain what portion of the information provided

by Dearborn to State was passed above the Assistant Secretary

level. Through August of 1960, only Assistant Secretary Rubottom,

his Deputy, Lester Mallory, and Staff Assistant Frank Devine,
were, within the Latin American Division of the Department,

aware of Dearborn’s “current projects." (Devine to Dearborn

letter, 8/15/60)*

By September 1960, Thomas Mann’ had replaced Roy Rubottom

as Assistant Secretary for Inter-American Affairs, and Frank

Devine had become a Special Assistant to Mr. Mann. While

serving as Special Assistant to the-Assistant Secretary, Devine

reportedly spent ninety percent of his time coordinating State
activities in Latin America, It was in this capacity that

Devine maintained almost daily communication with Ned Holman

and other’officials of the CIA's Western Hemisphere Division

(Devine, p.7)

raised concern with the Department and he was advised that ¢ertain
specific information should more appropriately come through "the
other channel” (presumably, CIA communications). Dearborn. was
advised that his cables to State were distributed to at least: 19
different recipient offices. (Id. )

HW 50955 DocId:32423525 Page 31


tw

Mann solicited Dearborn's comments concerning plans-

re wa
Qi Bian We es ohn J

under discussion for forciny Trujillo from power. Dearborn
replied in a detailed letter which concluded:

“One further point which I should probably not even

- Make. From a purely practical standpoint, it will
be best for us, for the OAS, and for the Dominican
Republic if the Dominicans put an end to Trujillo
before he leaves this island. If he has his millions
and is a free agent, he will devote his life from
-exile to preventing stable government in the D.R., to
overturning democratic governments and establishing
dictatorships: in the Caribbean, and to assassinating
his enemies. If I were a Dominican, which thank
heaven I am not, I would favor destroying Trujillo as
being the first necessary step jn the salvation of
my country and I would regard this, in fact, as my
Christian duty. If you recall Dracula, you will
remember it was necessary to drive a stake through
his heart to prevent a continuation of his crimes.
I believe sudden death would be more humane than
the solution of the Nuncio who once told me he thought
he should pray that Trujillo would have a long and
lingering illness." (Dearborn to Mann letter, 10/27/60

Cc. Efforts to Convince Trujillo to Abdicate

- Throughout the fall of 1960, efforts were made on both the
diplomatic and economic fronts aimed at pressuring Trujillo
into relinquishing control, and ideally, leaving the Dominican
Republic. The use of high level emissaries, both from within
and without the ranks of government, was considered, - (Special
Group Minutes, 9/8/60; Mann to Dearborn corres., 10/10/60
None of the efforts proved successful, and at the end of 1960

Trujillo was still in absolute control.

D. CIA Plans of October 1960

A CIA internal memorandum dated October 3, 1960 entitled

HWY 50955 DocId:32423525 Page 32


oo siee ia

"Plans of the Dominican Internal Opposition and Dominican

Desk for Overthrow of the Trujillo Government” set forth plans
which "have been developed on a tentative basis which appear
feasible and which might be carried out..coyertly by CIA with
a minimal risk of exposure." These plans provided, in part,
for the following:

“a. Delivery of approximately 300 rifles and pistols,

together with ammunition and a supply of grenades, to
secure cache on the South shore of the island, about

14 milesEast of Ciudad Trujillo.

"b. Delivery to the same cache described above, of an
electronic detonating device with remote control
features, which could be planted by the dissidents in
such manner as to eliminate certain key Trujillo
henchmen. This might necessitate training and intro-
ducing into the country by illegal entry, a trained

. technician to set the bomb and detonator." (Emphasis
added) (CIA Memorandum, 10/3/60)

E. December 1960 Special Group Plan of Covert Action

On December 29, 1960, the Special Group considered and
approved a broad plan of covert support to anti-Trujillo forces.
The plan, presented by Bissell, envisioned support to both
Dominican exile groups and internal dissidents. The
exile groups were to be furnished money to organize and under-
take anti~frujillo propaganda efforts and to refurbish a yacht

for use in paramilitary activities. Bissell emphasized

HW 50955 Dockd:32423525 Page 33


to the Special Group that "the proposed actions would not,
of themselves, bring about the desired result in the near
future, lacking some decisive stroke against Trujillo himself.”

(Special Group Minutes, 12/29/60)

Iv. January 12, 1961 Special Group Approval of “Limited
Supplies of Small Arms and Other Material"

On January 12, 1961, with all members present,” the
Special Group met and, according to its Minutes, took the
following action with respect to the Dominican Republic:

"Mr. Merchant explained the feeling of the Department
of State that limited supplies of small arms and other
material should be made available for dissidefits in-
side the Dominican Republic. Mr. Parrott said that we
believe this can be managed securely by CIA, and that
the plan would call for final transportation into the
country being provided by the dissidents themselves.’
F The Group approved the project.” (Special Group Minutes, 1/12/61)

A. Hemoranda Underlying the Special Group Action

oa On January 12, 1961, Thomas Mann sent a memorandum to
Under. Secretary Livingston Merchant. The memorandum,sent
through Joseph Scott, Merchant's Special Assistant, reported
on the disillusionment of Dominican dissidents with the United
States for its failure to furnish them with any tangible or
conerete assistance. Further, it reported: ;

Opposition clements have consistently asked us to supply
them with ‘*hardware*’ of various types. This has included
quantities of conventional arms and also, rather persis-
_tently, they have asked for some of the more exotic items
and devices. which they associate with revolutationary
effort. (Mann to Merchant memo of 1/12/61)

¥ The members of the Spécial Group were at the time: Livingston
Merchant, Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs; Gordon
{ Gray, Advisor to the President for National Security Affairs;
N John N, Irwin, Deputy Secretary of Defense; and Allen Dulles,
Director of the Central Intelligence Agency.

HW 50955 DocEd:32423525 Page 34


"Mann suggested for Merchant.'.s consideration and, if he
approved, for discussion by the Special Group, the provision
of token quantities of selected items desired by the dissidents.
Mann specifically mentioned small explosive devices which would
pldce some “sabotage potential” in the hands of dissident
elements, but stated that there "would be no thought of
toppling the GODR (Government of Dominican Republic)
by any such minor measure." (Mann to Merchant memo, 1/12/61)
This memorandum was drafted on January 11 by Mann's Special

Assistant for CIA liaison, Frank Devine.

A covering memorandum from Scott to Merchant, forwarding
Mann’s memo, was apparently taken by Merchant to the Special
Group meeting. Merchant's handwritten notations indicate that
the Svecial Group “agreed in terms of Tom Mann's meno"

“and that the Secretary of State was informed of that
decision by late afternoon on January 12, 1961. (Scott
to Merchant memo, 1/12/61)

There is no evidence that any- member of the Special Group,
other than Allen Dulles, knew that the dissidents: had clearly
and repeatedly. expressed a desire for arms and explosives to
be used by them in assassination efforts.” While it is, of
course, péssible that such information was passed orally to
some or all of the members of the Special Group, and perhaps

even discussed by them on January 12, 1961, there is no

¥Jarious CIA cables, including those dealing with the sniper
Me rifles, indicate that copies were sent to the DCI, Allen Dulles.

documentary evidence of which the Committee is aware which
would establish this to be the case.

On January 19, 1961, the last day of the Eisenhower
administration, Consul General Dearborn was advised that
approval had been given for supplying arms and other material
to the Dominican dissidents (HQS to Station cable, 1/19/61).
Shortly thereafter, Dearborn informed Devine that the
dissidents were “delighted” about the decision to deliver

"exotic equipment." (Dearborn to Devine cable, 1/31/61

Vv. January 20, 1961 - April 17, 1961
(the Kennedy Administration Through the Bay of Pigs)

On January 20, 1961, the Kennedy administration took
office. Three of the four members of the Special Group (all

except Allen Dulles) retired.

Prior to’ the failure of the Bay of Pigs invasion on April
17, 1961, a number of significant events occurred. These
events included meetings with Dominican dissidents in
which specific assassination plans were discussed, re-
quests by dissidents for explosive devices, the passage. by
U.S. officials of pistols and carbines to dissidents inside
the Dominican Republic, and the pouching to the Dominican.

Republic of machine guns which had been requested by the-

dissidents for use in connection with an assassination attempt. *

As indicated in the post-Bay of Pigs section, cinfra, permission
to pass those machine guns was denied and the guns were never
passed,

These events are discussed below under subheading A.

A, Specific Events Indirectly Linking U.S.
to Dissidents' Assassination Plans

1, Assassination Discussions and Requests for Explosives

At meetings held with dissident leaders in New York city
on February 10 and 15, 1961, CIA officials were told repeatedly
by dissident leaders that “the key to the success of the plot
{to overthrow the Trujillo regime] would be the assassination of
Trujillo.“ (CIA memo for the record, 2/13/61) Among the requests
made of the CIA by dissident leaders were the following:
(a) Ex-FPBI agents who would plan. and execute
the death of Trujillo.
(b) Cameras and other items that could be used
to fire projectiles.
(c) A slow-working chemical that could be rubbed on the palm
of one's hand and transferred to Trujillo in
oo a handshake, causing delayed lethal results.
(d) Silencers for rifles that could kill from a
distance of several miles. (Id.)

Other methods of assassinatiny Trujillo proposed by dissidents

Dockd:32423525 -Page 37


at the February 10 or February 15 meetings included poisoning
Trujillo's food or medicines, ambushing his automobile, and
attacking him with firearms and grenades. (CIA memo for the
record, 2/13/61; 2/16/61)*

The dissidents' “latest plot", as described in the February
CIA memoranda, was said to involve the planting of a powerful
bomb, which could be detonated from a nearby electric device,
along the route of Trujillo's evening walk. (Id.)

On March 13, 1961, a dissident in the Dominican Republic
asked for fragmentation grenades "for use during the next week
or so." This request was communicated to CIA Headquarters
on March 14, 1961, and was followed the next day by an additional
request for 50 fragmentation grenades, 5 rapid-fire weapons,

and 10 64 mm anti-tank rockets. ‘his furtner request was also

~ passed on to CIA Headquarters. (Station to HOS cable, 3/15/61)
There is no evidence that any of these arms were supplied to
the dissidents.
The documentary record makes clear that Frank. Devine at.
the State Department was also advised of related developments
in a March 16, 1961, “picnic” letter from Dearborn who complained
that his spirits were in the doldrums because:

+ + the members of our club are now prepared»

“tin their minds. to have a picnic but do not have
the ingredients for the salad. Lately they have
developed a. plan for the picnic,which just might
work if they could find the proper food. They

* There is no record that the CIA responded affirmatively to”
any of these requests and the CIA officer who drafted the
February 13 memorandum stated the view that some of the ques-
tions raised by the dissidents @id not reguire an answer.

HW 50955 Dockd:32423525 Page 38


have asked us for a few sandwiches, hardly
more, and we are not prepared to make them
available. Last week we were asked to furnish
three or four pineapples for.a party in the
near future,but I could remember nothing in my in-
structions that would have allowed me to contri-
bute this ingredient. Don't think T wasn't
tempted. I have rather specific guidelines

to the effect that salad ingredients will be
delivered outside the picnic grounds and will
be brought to the area by another club.
(Dedrborn letter to Devine, 3/16/61)

After reviewing his "picnic” lettér, together with the requests
in the March 14 and 15 cables discussed above, Dearborn con~
cluded during his testimony before tke Committee that the
“pineapples” were probably the requested fragmentation

grenades and the restriction on delivering salad ingredients
outside of the picnic grounds was, almost certainly, meant to
refer to the requirements of the January 12 Special Group

order that arms be delivered outside the Dominican Republic.

(Dearborn 7/29, pp. 25-27) .
2, The Passage of Pistols
a. Pouching to the Dominican Republic

In a March 15, 1961 cable, Chief of Station Owen reported
that Dearborn had asked for three .38 caliber: pistols for issue
to several dissidents. In reply, Headquarters cabled: "Regret
no authorization exists to suspend pouch regulations against
shipment “6£ arms" and indicated that their reply had been coor-
dinated with State. (HQS to Station cable, 3/17/61) the
Station Chief then asked Headquarters to seek the necessary
authorization and noted that at his last two posts, he had

received pistols via the pouch for “worthy purposes” and,

50955 Docld:32423525 Page


therefore, he knew it could be done. (Station to Hqs cable,
3/21/61) Two days later, Headquarters cabled that the pistois
and ammunition were being pouched. However, the Station .
Chief was instructed not .to advise Dearborn. (Hqs. to Station

cable, 3/24/6i)*

b. Reason for the CIA instruction
Not _to Tell Dearborn

Owen testified that he believed the "don't tell Dear-
born the pistol is being pouched" language simply meant that.
the sending of firearms through the diplomatic pouch was not
something to be unnecessarily discussed. (Qwen, pp. 78,79)
Dearborn said he never doubted the pouch was used, since he knew
Owen had no other means of receiving weapons. (Dearborn,
7/29, p. 33)

c. Were the Pistols Related to Assassination?

” Dearborn testified that he had asked for a single pistol
for purposes completely unrelated to any assassination con-
sideration. (Dearborn, 7/29, pp. 29-31) He said he had been
approached by a Dominican contact-who lived in a remote area
and was concerned for the safety of his. family in the event

ef political reprisals. Dearborn testified that he had believed

* The Inspector General's Report, issued in connection with
a review~of these events, concludes that:

"There is no indication in the EMDEED operational files
that the pistols were actually pouched. The request

for pistols appears to have been overtaken by a sub-
sequent request for submachine guns." (1.G. Report, pe» 60)

This conclusion is difficult to understand in light of the March
24, 1961, Headquarters to Station caples a ich provides:

"C.  Pouchingi.revolvers: sand. amnoweguested 4 TRUI 0462
(in 20040) on-28 March. Do not advise(name Dearborn deleted)
this material being pouched. Explanation follows."

NW 50955 Docid:32423525 Page 40


a
the man's fears were well-founded and had promised to seek a
pistol.”

Although there is no direct evidence linking any of these
pistols to the assassination of Trujillo, a June 7, 1961, CIA
memorandum, unsigned and with no attribution as to source,
states that two of the three pistols were passed by Owen to
Lorenzo "Wimpy" Berry, a United States citizen who was in direct
contact with the action element of the dissident group. It
should also be noted that the assassination was apparently con-
ducted with almost complete reliance upon hand weapons. Whether
one or more of these .38 caliber Smith & Wesson pistols
eventually came into the hands of the assassins
and, if so, whether they were used in connection with the

assassination, remain open questions.

Both Dearborn and Owen testified that they regarded the pistols
as weapons for self-defense purposes and they never
considered them in any way connected with the then-current

. i
assassination plans. (Dearborn 7/29, p.70; Owen, pp.38,73)

However, none of the Headquarters cables inquired as to the
purpose for which the handguns were sought and Owen's cable
stated only that Dearborn wanted them for passage to dissidents.

(Station to HQS cable, 3/15/61) Indeed, the March 24, 1961,

*Dedrborn is clear in his recollection that he asked Owen to
request only one pistol. (Dearborn, 7/29, pp.30,31) Owen,
on the other hand, testified that if his cables requested three
pistols for Dearborn then Dearborn must have asked for three
pistols. (Owen, p.72) ~ : -
The pistols were, however, apparently sent in one package
i (HOS to Station cables,3/27/61 and 3/24/61) and Dearborn testi-
oe fied that, what he believed to be the one gun, came “wrapped
up" and that he passed it. ._ .(Dearborn,-7/29,p.30) .

HW 50955 Docld:32423525 Page 41


cable advising that the pistols were being pouched is thé

very cable which’ was sent in response to a request by the
dissidents for machine guns to be used in an assassination

effort which had been previously described to Headquarters.

As with the carbines discussed below, it appears that little,

if any, concern was expressed within the Agency over passing these

weapons to would-be assassins.

3. Passing of the Carbines

a. Request by Owen and Dearborn and Approval by CIA

In a March 26, 1961 cable to CIA Headquarters, Owen asked
for permission to pass to the dissidents three 30 caliber M1
carbines. The guns had been left behind in the Consulate by
Navy personnel after the U.S. broke formal diplomatic relations

in August 1960. Dearborn testified that he knew of and concurred

in the proposal to supply the carbines to the dissidents.

{Dearborn 7/29, pp. 42,43) On March 31, 1961 CIA Headquarters
cabled approval of the request to pass the carbines. (Hqs to

Station cable, 3/31/61)

b. Were the Carbines Related to Assassination?

The carbines were passed to the action group contact, Wimpy Berry, on April 7,
1961. (Station to HQS cable, 4/8/61) Eventually, they found

their way into the hands cf one of the assassins, Antonio

de la Maza. ‘(Station to HQS cable, 4/26/61; I.G. Report
pp. 46, 49)
\ carbines were at!all.

HW 50955 Docld:32423525 Page 42


HW 50955

of support, indicating U.S. support of the dissidents' efforts
to overthrow Trujillo. (Dearborn 7/29, pp. 46-48; Owen p. 39)

c. Failure to Disclose to State Department
Officials in Washington

“ there is no indication that the request or the passage
of the carbines was disclosed to State Department officials in
Washington until several weeks after the passage. In fact, on
April 5, Headquarters requested its Station to ask Dearborn
not to comment in correspondence with State that the carbines
and ammunition were being passed to tke dissidents. This cable
was sent while Owen was in Washington, and it indicated that
upon his return to the Dominican Republic, he would explain
the request. The Station replied that Dearborn had not com-
mented on the carbines and ammunition in his correspondence

with State and he realized the necessity not to do so. (Station

to HQS cable, 4/6/61)

Dearborn testified, however, that he believed, at the
time of his April-6 cable, that someone in the State De-
partment had been consulted in ‘advance and had approved the

passage of the carbines (Dearborn 7/29, p. 44)

Dockd:32423525 Page 43


3. Requests For and Pouching of the Machine Guns

a. Owen Requests Machine Guns for Use
in Assassination

The Station Chief suggested that Headquarters consider
pouching an M3 machine gun on ‘February 10, 1961 (Owen, pp. 63,64;
Station to HQS cable, 3/15/61). The request was raised again
in March but no action was taken. On March 20, 1961, Owen cabled
a dissident request for five M3 or comparable machine guns
specifying their wish that the arms be sent via the diplomatic
pouch or similar means. The dissidents were said to feel that
delivery by air drop or transfer at sea would overly-tax their
resources. (Station to HQS cable, 3/20/61)"

The machine guns sought by the dissidents were clearly
identified, in Owen's cable, as being sought for use in connec-
tion with an attempt to assassinate Trujillo. This plan was to
kill Trujillo in the apartment of his mistress and, according

to Owen's cable:

"4&4. To do they need five M3 or comparable machine-
guns. and 1500 rounds ammo for personal defense in
event fire fight. Will use quiet weapons for basic
job." (Id.)

In essence, CIA's response was that the timing for an
assassination was wrong. Owen’ was told that precipitious or
uncoordinated action could lead to the emergence of a leftist,
Castro-type regime and the "mere disposal of Trujillo may create
more problems than solutions." It was Headquarters' position
that:

"we should attempt to avoid precipitous action
by.the internal dissidents until opposition group _
and HQS are better prepared to support /assassination/®,

effect a change in the regime, and cope with the after--
‘ math." (HQS to Station cable, 3/24/61)

® Word supplied by CIA in previously sanitized cable.

WW 50955

~22-

The cable also stated that Headquarters was prepared

to deliver machine guns and ammunition to the dissidents when
they developed a capability to received them, but that security
considerations precluded use of U.S. facilities as a carrier.*
Soon, thereafter, on April 6, 1961, while Owen was in Washington
for consultation with Headquarters, he reported on events in
the Dominican Republic and

"especially on the insistence of the mNOTH [dissident]

leaders that they be provided with a limited number

of small arms for their own protection (specifi-

cally, five M3 caliber .45 SMG's)." (CIA memo

for the record, 4/11/61)

b. Pouching the Machine Guns is Approved
by Bissell

Accordingly, on April 7, 1961, a Pouch Restriction Waiver

Request and Certification was submitted seeking permission to

pouch "four M3 machine guns and 240 rounds of ammunition on a

priority basis for issuance to a small action group. to be used

for self protection." (Pouch Restriction Waiver Request 4/7/61)

The request, | submitted on behalf of the Chief, Western

Hemisphere Division, further provided:
“*B. A determination has been made that the issuance
of this equipment to the action group is desirable

if for no other reason than to assure this important
group's continued cooperation with and confidence in
this Agency's determination to live up to its earlier
commitments to the group. These commitments took

that the revolvers and ammunition were being pouched.

the form of advising the group in January
1961 that we would provide limited‘ arms
and assistance to them provided they develop
the capability to receive it. Operational
circumstances have prevented this group from
developing the assets capable of receiving
‘the above equipment through normal clandestine
channels such as air drops or sea infiltra-

a tion.”

The Waiver Request was approved by Richard Bissell, as Deputy
Director (Plans), on April 10, 1961. (Za.)

The machine guns were pouched to the Dominican Republic and
were received by the station on April 19, 1961.* (1.G, Report,
p. 42; Station to Headquarters cables 4/19/61).

On Avril 10, Walter Elder, Assistant to the Director, had issued
a memorandum which stated:

“Mr. Dulles wants no action on drops of leaflets

er arms in the Dominican Republic taken without

his approval." (Elder memorandum of 4/10/61) .**
The Eider memorandum suggests that Dulles did not know that an
air drop of arms was regarded as unfeasible and that pouching

had been approved.

‘B. Knowledge of Senior American Officials (pre-Bay of Pigs

On February 14, 1961, prior to the passage of weapons,
_ but a month after the generalized approval of the passage _
of arms by the prior administration, a meeting of
the Special Group was held with Messrs. McNamara, Gilpatric,

Bowles, Bundy, Dulles, Bissell, and General Cabell in attendance.

*® Permission to pass the machine, guns was never obtained and the guns
never passed into the hands of the dissidents. The matter is discussed
in detail beginning at page; 7

— ** Elder testified that this note, sent the weekend before the Bay of Pigs
invasion of Cuba, was intended to make sure that there were no ‘unusual
planes shot dom or any unnecessary noise in the Dominican Republic"
prior to the Cuba invasion. (Elder, p. 51) .

HW 50955 Docld:32423525 Page 46


The minutes state that:

"Mr, Dulles, assisted by Mr. Bissell, then summarized
for the benefit of the new members of the Special

Group the specific actions taken by the predecessor
group during the past year, and also a list of signi-
ficant projects which antedate the beginning of 1960
and which it is planned to continue." (Special Group Minutes
of 2/14/61)

In the course of the discussion, the following point, among

others, was made:

"(a) Dominican Republic -- Mr. Bundy asked that a
memorandum be prepared for higher authority on the
subject of what plans can be made for a successor
government to Trujillo." (Id.)

The request attributed to Bundy suggests that the Domini-
can Republic had been one of the matters on which Dulles and

Bissell briefed the new members. - . —

What is unclear from the February 14 minutes (just as
it is unclear from the January 12 minutes) is the degree to

which the Special Group was informed concerning the means by

which the dissidents planned to accomplish the overthrow of
the Trujillo regime. Specifically, it is not known if
the new members of the Special Group were told that the

dissident group had expressed the desire to assassinate

Trujillo. Nor is it known if the Special Group was .

HW 50955 Docld:32423525 Page 47


aoe
advised that the State Department representative in the
Dominican Republic had made the assessment that the Dominican
government could not be overthrown without the assassination
“of Trujillo.

Bissell testified that he had no clear recollection
of the details of the February 14 briefing and he was unable
to say whether or not the method of overthrow to be attempted
by the dissidents was discussed. (Bissell, 7/22, pp. 101, 102)

_ Robert McNamara, one of the new members of the Special Group
in attendance for the briefing, has no recollection as to the
specificity in which the Dominican Republic was discussed at the
February 14 meeting. He does not recall any mention by eitner
Dulles or Bisseli of dissident plans to assassinate ‘'rujilio.
(McNamara affidavit).

February Memoranda

The Secretary of State sent the President a memorandum

on February 15, 1961, in response to a request concerning pro-
gress to assure an orderly takeover “should Trujillo fall.”
The memorandum advised that:

"Our representatives in the Dominican Republic

have, at considerable risk to those involved,

established contacts with numerous leaders of the
underground opposition .. . [and . . . the CIA

_,has recently been authorized to arrange for delivery
“to them outside the Dominican Republic of small arms
and sabotage equipment.

This reference to recent authorization for delivery of
arms indicates that Secretary Rusk had received some briefiig.

concerning events in the Dominican Republic and the January 1961

Special Group decision to ‘provide arms to anti-Trujillo
elements. Assistant Secretary for Inter-American Affairs,
Thomas Mann; Deputy Assistant Secretary William Coerr; and
Special Assistant Frank Devine continued in their respective
positions throughout the transition period. The Comaittee has
been furnished no documents indicating that Secretary Rusk or
Under Secretary Bowles were specifically advised as to the
intentions of the Dominican dissidents to kill Trujillo; intentions
of which the Bureau of Inter-American Affairs certainly
had knowledge. indeed, Secretary Rusk testified that he was not
personally so advised. (Rusk, 7/10, pp. 41,42)

On February 17, 1961, Richard Bissell sent a briefing paper
on the Dominican Republic to McGeorge Bundy, President Kennedy's
Hational Security Advisor. ‘The paper made note of the out-

standing Special Group approval for the provision of arms and

equipment to Dominican dissidents and stated that the dissidents
- . had been. informed that the U.S. was prepared to provide such

arms and equipment as soon as they developed the capability to

receive them.

The briefing paper also indicated that dissident leaders
had informed CIA of "their plan of action which they felt could
be implemented if they were provided with arms for 300 men,
explosives, and remote control detonation devices." Various

witnesses have testified, however, that supplying arms for 300

men would, standing alone, indicate a "non-targeted"- use fo# the

HW 50955 DocEd:32423525 Page 49


arms (i.e., a paramilitary or revolutionary implementation as
opposed to a specifically targeted assassination use). (Bissell,

7/29, p.80),
Concerning the briefing paper, Bissell testified that:

“.,. it is perfectly clear that I was aware at the
time of the memorandum to Mr. Bundy that these
dissident groups were, and had for a long time,

been hoping they could accomplish the assassination
of Trujillo. As a matter of fact, the requests since
some seven or eignt months earlier was a perfectly
clear indication of that, so that fact was not new
knowledge." (Bissell 7/22, p.102)

When asked why the memorandum djd not include the fact that

the dissidents intended the assassination of Trujillo, Bissell

replied:

"ZT cannot tell you, Mr. Chairman. I do not
remember what considerations moved me. I don't
know whether it was because this was common
knowledge and it seemed to me unnecessary to
include it, or as you are implying, there was
an element of concealment here. TI would he very
surprised if it were the latter, in this case."
(Bissell, 7/22, p.101)

In response to questions concerning the lack of information
in the February 17, 1961 briefing paper concerning the uses to
- which the requested arms might likely be put by the dissidents,
Bissell stated:
“. 2. I would say that the Agency's failure,
if there be a failure here was [not] (sic) to’‘state
in writing that the plans of the dissidents
~.would include assassination attempts."
(Bissell, 7/22, p.99)
Bissell's briefing paper for Bundy concluded with the

assessment that a violent clash might soon occur between Tryjillo

HW 50955 Docld:32423525 Page 50


and the internal opposition, “which will end either with the
liquidation of Trujillo and his cohorts or with a complete
roll up of the internal opposition." In this regard, the fear
was expressed that existing schedules for the delivery of
weapons to the internal opposition might not be sufficiently
timely, and it was therefore recommended that consideration be
given to caching the requested arms and other materials.
(Bissell to Bundy memo, 2/17/61

thus, by the middle of February 1961, the senior
members of the new administration, and in view of the "for
higher authority" nature of Bundy's request, presumably
President Kennedy himself, were aware of the outstanding Special
Group approval for the passage of arms and other materials to
opposition elements within the Dominican Republic. There was

no modification or recision of the “inherited” Special Group

approval and.it would seem fair, therefore, to regard the
approval as having been at least acquiesced in by the new

administration.

- During March and early April71961, operational levels”
within both the CIA and the State Department learned of in-
creasingly detailed plans by the dissidents to assassinate
Trujillo. There is no evidence that this information was

passed to the White House or to any member of the Special Group,

HW 50955 Docld:32423525 Page 51


HW 50955

except Allen pulles.* Similarly, there is no evidence that
the passage of the pistols or the carbines or the pouching

of thé machine guns to the Dominican Republic was disclosed
to anyone outside of the CIA during this period.”

VI. April 17, 1961°- May 31, 1961
(Bay of Pigs Through Trujillo Assassination.

Following the failure of the Bay of Pigs invasion, attempts
were made by State and CIA representatives in the Dominican
Republic to dissuade the dissidents from a precipitous assassina-
tion attempt, These efforts to halt the assassination of Trujillo
were the result of instructions from CIA Neadquarters and were
prompted by concern ever filling the power vacuum which would
result from Trujillo's death.

The machine guns arrived in the Dominican Republic but
permission to pass them to the dissidents was never given and
the guns never left the Consulate.

Dearborn returned to Washington for consultation and a

contingency plan for the Dominican Republic was drafted.

Two days before Trujillo's assassination, Dearborn received
a cable of instructions and guidance from President Kennedy.
The cable advised that the U.S. must not run the risk of associ-
ation with political assassination, since the U.S., as a matter

of general policy, could not condone assassination. The cable

** Although a copy of the CIA cable advising that the pistols
were being pouched was sent to the Director's office, Dulles
apparently did not receive copies of the cables approving
passage of the carbines x pouch £*the machine guns.

further advised Dearborn to continue to hold open offers of
material assistance to the dissidents and to advise them of
U.S. support for them if they were successful in overthrowing
the Trujillo government. The cable also reconfirmed the
decision not to pass the machine guns.

A. Decision Not to Pass the Machine Guns and Unsuccess~
» ful U.S. Attempt to Stop Assassination Effort

By April 17, 1961, the Bay of Pigs invasion had
/Speration was a failed/. As a vesuit, there developed a general
realization that precipitous action should be avoided in the
Dominican Republic until Washington was able to give further —
consideration to the consequences of a Trujillo overthrow and
the power vacuum which would be created. (Bissell, 6/11,
p.113) A cable from Headquarters to the Station, on April 17,
1961, advised that it was most important that the machine guns
not be passed without additional Headquarters approval.

The machine guns arrived in the Dominican Pepublic on April
19, 1961, and Headquarters was so advised. ‘The earlier ad-
monition that the machine guns should be held in Station custody
until further notice was repeated in a second cable from tlead-
quarters, sent April 20, 1961. ‘This decision was said to have
been “based on judgment that filling a vacuum created by assas~
sination Yow bigger question than ever view unsettled conditions
in Caribbean area.” (HQs. to Station cable, 4/20/61)

The dissidents continued to press for the release of the

machine guns and their requests were passed on to Headquarters

Doclda:32423525 Page 53


HW 50955

in cables from Dearborn and Owen. {Station to HQS cables
4/25/61} On April 25, 1961, Owen advised Yleadquarters that
Wimpy Berry had informed him that Antonio de la Maza was
going to attempt the assassination between April 29 and May 2.
Owen also reported that this attempt would use the three
carbines passed from the American Consulate, together with
whatever else was available. (Id.)

In response to the April 26 cable, Headquarters restated
that there was no approval to pass any additional arms to the
dissidents and requested Owen to advise the dissidents that the
United States was simply not prepared at that time to cope with
the aftermath of the assassination. (See C/S comments,
Station to HOS cable, 4/27/61). The following day, April 27,
1961, Owen replied that, based upon further discussions with
the dissidents, “we doubt statement U.S. government not now
prepared to cope with aftermath will dissuade them from
attempt." (Station to HOS cable, 4/27/61)

Dearborn recalis receiving instructions that

an effort be made to turn off the assassination attempt and

testified that efforts. to carry out the instructions were
unsuccessful. In effect, tne dissidents informed him that
this was their affair and it could not be turned off to suit

the convenience of the U.S. government. . ,

(Dearborn, 7/29, p.52)

Dockd:32423525 Page 54


HW 50955

On April 30, 1961, Dearborn advised Headquarters that
the dissidents had reported to him the assassination attempt

was’ going to take place during the first week of May. The

action group was reported to have in-its possession three carbines,
four to six 12-gauge shotguns and other small arms. Although
they reportedly still wanted the machine guns, Dearbérn advised
Headquarters that the group was going to go ahead with what they
had, whether the U.S. wanted them to or not. (Station to HQS
cable, 4/30/61) a -

Dearborn's cable set forth the argument of the action
group that, since the U.S. had already assisted the group te
some extent and was therefore implicated, the additional assistance
of releasing the machine guns would not change the basic re-
lationship. The cable concluded: . ;
‘Owing to far-reaching political implications
involved in release or non release of re-

quested items, Headquarters may wish discuss fore-
going with State Department.” (Id.)

B. Further Consideration of Passing Machine Guns

In reponse, a cable was drafted at CIA Headquarters authori-
zing passage of the machine guns. The cable which was sent
to Allen Dulles, with Bissell’'s recommendation for. its dispatch,
provided:

"Since it appears that opposition group has
committed itself to action with or without

Dockd:32423525 Page 55



HW 50955

additional support, coupled with fact ref

Cc items [the carbines] already made available

to them for personal defense; station authori-

zed pass ref. A items [the machine guns] to

opposition member for their additional pro-

tection on their proposed endeavor." (Draft of HOS
- to Station cable, 5/2/61). .

The cable was never sent.

In his testimony before the Committee, Bissell characteri-
zed his reasoning for recommending release of the machine guns
as:

. . « having made already a considerable
investment in this dissident group and its
plans that we might as well make the addi-
tional investment." (Bissell, 7/22, p.127)

The following day, May 3, 1961, Ray Herbert, Deputy Chief
of the Western Hemisphere Division ef CIA, who frequently acted
as liaison with the State Department in matters concerning
covert operations in the Dominican Republic, met with Adolph
Berle, Chairman of the State Department's Interagency Task Force
on Latin America.

A Berle memorandum of the meeting states that Herbert
informed Berle that a local group in_the Dominican Republic
wished to overthrow Trujillo and sought arms for that purpose.
The memorandum continued:

"On exoss examination it developed that the

real plan was to assassinate Trujillo and’ they
-wanted guns for that purpose. flerbert wanted

to know what the policy should be,

"I told him I could not care less for Trujillo

and that this was the general sentiment. But

we did not wish to have any thing to do with any «
assassination plots anywhere, any time. Herbert

said he felt the same way." (Berle, Memo of
Conversation, 5/3/61)

Dockd:32423525 Page 56


copies cf Berle’s memorandum were sent to Wymberly Coerr;
the Acting Assistant Secretary for Inter-American Affairs,
and to Special Assistant Frank Devine.

Both Herbert and Devine, who had been in almost daily
contact with each other since August of 1960, had been advised.
of the assassination plans of the dissident group. In fact,
Herbert, along with Bissell, had signed off on the proposed
cable of May 2, releasing the machine guns for passage.

C. Special Group Meetings of May 4 and May 16, 1961.

On tne day following the Berle-Ilerbert meeting, the

Special Group met and, according to the minutes:

"The DCL referred to recent reports of a new
anti-Trujillo plot. He said we never know if
one of these is going to work or- not, and asked
what is the status of contingency planning should
the plot come off. Mr. Bundy said that this point
is covered in the Cuba paper which will be discussed

oo : at a high level in the very near future.” (Special
~ Group Minutes, 5/4/61)

Allen Dulles referred to “recent reports" of a new anti-Trujillo
plot. Certainly, the most recent report of such a plot was
bearborn's April 30 cable -- disclosing an imminent assassination
attempt potentially utilizing U.S.-supplied weapons.

“On May 18, 1961, the Special Group again considered the

situation in the Dominican Republic and, according to the

minutes:

" Cabell [Deputy DCI] noted that the
internal dissidents were pressing for the
release to them of certain small axms now in
U.S. hands in the Dominican Republic. He

- inguired whether the feeling of the
Group remained that these arms should not be
passed.” ‘The members showed no inclination to
take a contrary position at this time."
(Emphasis supplied). (Special Group Minutes,
5/18/61) . .

D. Final Requests by Dissidents for Machine Guns

On May 16, 1961, Dearborn cabled the State Department,
attention Acting Assistant Secretary Coerr, with an urgent
request From the dissidents for the machine guns. The cable
advised that the assassination attempt was scheduled for the
night of May 16 and that, while the chances of success were
50 percent, provision of the machine guns would reduce the
possibility of failure. The dissidents reportedly stressed
to Dearborn that if the effort failed,due to U.S. refusal to
supply the machine guns, the U.S. would be held responsible
and would never be forgiven. Dearborn reported that he had
informed the dissidents that, based on his recent conversations
in Washington, he was reasonably certain that authorization
could not be obtained for handing over machine guns. (Dearborn
to State cable, 5/16/61

A return cable from the State Department to Dearborn, sent

the same day, confirmed Dearborn's judgment.’ It instructed him

* Phere was no meeting of thé Special Group at which the Domini-
can Republic was discussed between May 4 and May 18. ‘The language
attributed to General Cabell as to whether the feeling of the
Group remained not to pass the arms, tends to suggest that the
guestion of passing these arms must have been raised prior to
the May 18 Group meeting... perhaps at the:May'4, 1961 meeting.

to continue to take the same line until he received contrary
instructions which clearly indicated they had béén cleared in
advance by the State Department itself. This cable from State was
approved by Under Secretary Bowles. (Department to Dearborn, 5/16/61)
: Ray Herbert referred to Dearborn's May 16 request in a
memorandum he sent to Devine on the same date and asked to be
advised as to the Department's policy concerning passage of
the machine guns. Herbert noted that when. this request was
last taken to the Department, Berle made the decision that the
weapons not be passed. (Memo to ARA Exom CIA, 5/16/61)
: Devine responded to Herbert's memorandum on the same day,
advising Herbert that the Department's policy continued to be
negative on the matter of passing the machine guns.* Herbert's
attention was directed to the January 12, 1961 Special Group

limitation concerning the passage of arms outside of the

Dominican Republic. A copy of Devine's memorandum to Herbert
was forwarded to the Office of the Under Secretary of State,
to the attention of. his personal assistant, Joseph Scott.
(Devine to Herbert memo, 5/16/61)

E. Dearborn in Washington for Consultation --
Drafting of Contingency Plans

At a meeting of the National Security Council on May 5, 1961,
the question of U.S. policy toward the Dominican Republic was
considered and it was:

"Agreed that the Task Force on Cuba would
prepare promptly both emergency and long- | =

range plans for anti-communist intervention
t -in the event of crises in Haiti or the

= ee a a

By May 27, 1961 Dearborn was advising the State Department that
the roup was no longer requesting the arms and had accepted the
fact that it must make do with what it had. (Dearborn to’ State
‘cable, 5/27/61)

HW 50955 Dockd:32423525 Page 59


Dominican Republic. Noted the President's
view that the United States should not
initiate the overthrow of Trujillo before
we Knew what government would succeed him,
and that any action ayainst Trujillo should
be multilateral." (Record of Actions bv
Wational Security Council, 5/5/61)

- (Approved by the President, 5/16/61)

Although the precise dates are uncertain, Dearborn was
recalled to Washington to participate in drafting of these
contingency plans and recommendations. Dearborn was in Washing-
ton at least from May 10 through May 13, 1961.

While in Washington, Dearborn met with State
Department personnel and with Richard Goodwin and Arthur
Schlesinger of the White House staff. When testifying before

the Committee, he was unable to recall the substance of

his discussions with Goodwin and Schlesinger, aside from his

general assumption that the current situation in the Dominican

Republic was discussed. He did not recall.any discussion with

Goodwin or Schlesinger concerning arms, either those which had
been passed to the dissidents or those which were being sought.

{Dearborn, 7/29, pp. 58-61) Dearborn left the meeting at the

White House, however, with the firm impression that Goodwin had been

reviewing cable traffic between Washington and the Dominican

Republic and was very familiar with events as they then stood.

{Dearborn, 7/29, p.62)

HW 50955 DocId:32423525 Page 60


On May li, 1961, Dearborn prepared a two-page draft~
document which set forth ways in which the U.S. could overtly
aid and encourage the opposition to Trujillo. The draft noted

that means of stepping up the covert program were considered

in separate papers. (Dearborn draft document of May 11, 1961)

This Dearborn draft of May 11, 1961, was apparently used as a
basis for portions of the “Dominican Republic -- Contingency
Paper” discussed below.
Two documents entitled, “Program of Covert Action for the

Dominican Republic" were provided to the Committee staff from
State Department files. Each appears to be a draft of the
covert activities paper described in Dearborn's May 11, 1961

4 memorandum. One draft recommended an expanded U.S. offer to
deliver small explosive devices and arms, (Document indicating

it was attached to "Dominican Republic ~- Contingency,” dated

5/12/61 and bearing Nos. 306-308) . The other draft is very

.-, Similar except that it concludes that delivery of arms within
the Dominican Republic to members of the underground is not

- recommended. (Document from State Dept. files bearing No. 310).

Attached to the second draft was a one-page document which

Frank Devine believes he wrote. It listed eight numbered
points including the following:

a The USG should not lend itself to direct

political assassination.

"2. US moral posture can ill afford further -

tarnishing in the eyes of the world.

HW 50955 “Docld:32423525 Page 61


739 a
"3. We would be encouraging the action, supplying
the weapons, effecting the delivery, and then
turning over only the final execution to
(unskilled) local triggermen.
"4. So far we have seen no real evidence of action
capability. Should we entrust ourselves and
our reputation to this extent in the absence
thereof? 1
"7, Can we afford a precedent which may convince
the world that our diplomatic pouches are used
to deliver assassination weapons?" (Document
from State Department files bearing No. 313)
The other points raised in documént No, 313 related to the
likelihood that any such involvement by the U.S. would ultimately
. be revealed.
On May 15, 1961, Acting Assistant Secretary Coerr sentto
Under Secretary. Bowles a document entitled "Covert Action Pro-

_  &rams Authorized With Respect to the-Dominican. Republic". That
document ‘outlined the existing Special Group approvals for covert
assistance to Dominican dissidents and, while making no recommen-
dation as to further policy, suggested that the Special Group
review the outstanding approvals and communicate to interested
agencies the status of such authorizations. (State Dept. document

from Coerr to Bowles, 5/15/61)

During this period a document dated May 13, 1961, was

HW 50955 Dockd:32423525 Page 62


prepared at the request of Richard Goodwin and was thereafter
*

circulated within the State Department. This document,

entitled “Program of Covert Action for the Dominican Republic”

reported:
“CIA has had in the direct custody of its Station
in Ciudad Trujillo, a very limited supply of
weapons and grenades. In response to the urgent
requestsfrom the internal opposition leaders for
personal defense weapons attendant to their
projected efforts to neutralize TRUJILLO, three

accompanying ammunition have been passed by secure.
means to the opposition. The recipients have
repeatedly requested additional armed support.”

This memorandum is the first direct evidence of disclosure to

anyone on the White House staff of the fact that arms had been

passed to disSidents in the Dominican Republic,

The original ribbon copy of the memorandum has the above

quoted material circled in pencil and the word “neutralize”

is underscored. Goodwin testified before the Conmittee that

- to him and struck him as significant. (Goodwin 7/18, pp. 48,49)

Under the heading of “Possible Covert Actions Which Require

Additional Authorization," the memorandum to Goodwin indicated
that the CIA had a supply of four 45 caliber machine guns and
a small number. of grenades currently in the direct custody o£
the Station in Ciudad Trujillo and that a secure means of passing

these weapons to the internal opposition "for their use in -

randum made no recommendation to approve or disapprove passage
of these weapons. (Id.)

2 On May 15, 1961, Bundy forwarded to Goodwin another
memorandum. This one, entitled "The Current Situation in and
Contingency Plans for the Dominican Republic," had been received
by Bundy from the State Department. Attached was an under-

lying document which began:

"Recent reports indicate that the internal
Dominican dissidents are becoming increasingly
determined to oust Trunillo by any means, and
their plans in this regard are well advanced.”
The May 15 memorandum stressed that it was highly desirable
om for the U.S. to be identified with and to support the elements
seeking to overthrow Trujillo. The attachment
recommended that Consul General Dearborn inform the dissidents
that if they succeed "at their own initiative and on their own
- responsibility in forming an acceptable provisional government
they can be assured that any reasonable request for assistance
from the U.S. will be promptly and favorably answered." (Documents

from State Dept. files bearing Nos. 279-286).

F. Drafts Leading to and Final Cable of May 29, 1961

A copy of Dearborn's cable of May 16, 1961, requesting
urgent State Department guidance, was forwarded to Richard .
Goodwin. At the specific request of Goodwin,

the State Department replied to Dearborn on May 17,

HW 50955 Dockd:32423525 Page 64


-42-

and advised him to keep in mind the President's view, as
expressed at the May 5 National Security Council Meeting, that
the United States should not initiate the overthrow. of Trujillo
before knowing what government would succeed him. (Depart-
ment to Dearborn, 5/17/61)

Dearborn responded on May 21, 1961, pointing out that
for over a year State Department representatives in the

Dominican Republic had been nurturing the effort

to overthrow frujillo and had assisted the dissidents in
numerous ways, all of which were known to the Department. It
was, Dearborn stated, “too late to consider whether United

: States will initiate overthrow of Trujillo." Dearborn invited
further guidance from State.

- In response to Dearborn's request for guidance, the State
Department drafted a reply on May 24. The draft discussed a
conflict between ‘two objectives: _

"(1) fo be so associated with removal Trujillo

regime as to derive credit among DR dissidents
and liberal elements throughout Latin America;

"(2) To disassociate US from any obvious inter-

a vention in Dominican Republic and even more so
from any political assassination which might
occur.”

HW 50955 Docld:32423525 Page 65


HW 50955

It was said to be the Department's considered opinion that
“former objective cannot, repeat not, easily override latter.”
(State Dept. to Dearborn cable, 5/24/61 ~- not sent)

This State Department draft was forwarded to Under Secretary
Bowles with the comment that Goodwin considered it "too negative"
and that he would try his hand on a draft "for Bundy to present
tomorrow morning." (Memo from Achilles to Bowles, 5/24/61)

A May 26, 1961, memorandum from Bowles to Bundy begins:

“Following up on our discussion of the Dominican
Republic at yesterday's meéting of the Special
Group,’ I am forwarding you a draft telegram which
we would like to’ send to Henry Dearborn, our Consul
General in Ciudad Trujillo, supplementing the
guidance he will be receiving on the recently
approved contingency plans."

Minutes,of the Special Group meeting on May 25, 1961 do not,

however, reflect any discussion of the Dominican Republic.

If, as Bowles' memorandum suggests, a discussion concerning

the Dominican Republic did occur at the May 25 meeting, it is

not known what the discussion involved or what decisions,

if any, were made.

Richard Goodwin personally prepared alternate drafts to
the proposed State Department cable to Dearborn. Goodwin testi-
fied that it was his intent in revising the cable to communicate
to Dearborn, President Kennedy's personal belief that the United
States:

“ ., . didn't want to do anything that: would
involve us further, the United States further,

in any effort to assassinate Trujillo."
(Goodwin, 7/10, p.32}

Dockd:32423525 Page 66


At the same time,Goodwin's draft raised the issue of
further covert action and transfer of arms to the dissidents
and advised Dearborn to hold out the arms as being available
tothe dissidents pending their ability to receive them.

It was the twofold intent of the cable as revised by
Goodwin, (1) to express the desire to remain in the good graces
of the dissidents who, it was believed, would constitute the
new government following Trujillo's assassination, and (2)
to avoid any action which might further involve the United
States in the anticipated assassination. This dual purpose
is clearly evident in the cable which advised:

+ +. we must not run risk of U.S. association
with political assassination, since U.S. as matter
of general policy cannot condone assassination. _
This Last principal is overriding and must prevail
in doubtful situation." (Emphasis added)

ee

“Continue to inform dissident elements of U.S.
support for their position."

According to Goodwin, the underscored material was inserted in
the cable at the specific direction of President Kennedy.
{Goodwin, 7/10, pp. 22, 23).

With. respect to the four machine guns which were in the
Consulate and which had been repeatedly requested by. the
dissidents, the cable advised pearborn that the U.S. was unable
to transfer these arms to the dissidents: Dearborn was
instructed to:

“tell them that this is because of our suspicion
that method of transfer may be unsafe. In actual

HW 50955 DocId:32423525 Page 67


fact, we feel that the transfer of arms would
serve very little purpose and expose the United
States to great danger of association with
assassination attempt."
The cable, as revised by Goodwin and approved by President
Kennedy, was sent to Dearborn on May 29, 1961. {State Dept.

to Dearborn cable, 5/29/61) ~ _—

Vit, May 30, 1961 and Immediately Thereafter:

A. Trujillo Assassinated
Late in the evening of May 30, 1961, Trujillo was ambushed

and assassinated near San Cristobal, Dominican Republic. The

assassination closely paralleled the plan disclosed by the

action group to American representatives in the Dominican Republic

and passed on to officials in Washington at both the CIA and

the State Department. (Dearborn cable to State, 5/30/61) The

. - assassination was conducted by members of the action group, to
whom the American carbines had been passed, and such sketchy
information as is available indicates that one or more of the
carbines were in the possession of the assassination group when
Trujillo was killed. (I. G. Report, pp. 60-61). This evidence indicate
however, that the actual assassination was accomplished by
handguns and shotsuns. (I.G. Report, p.61)
B. {ables to Washington
After receiving the May 29 cable from Washington, both Consul
General Dearborn and Station Chief Owen sent replies. According
to Dearborn's testimony, he did not regard the May 29 cable
% as a change in U.S. policy concerning support. for assassinations.
(Dearborn 7/29/75y/ p. 74).
mo :
ae

HW 50955 Dockd:32423525 Page 68

He interpreted the May 29 cable as saying:

",,.we don't care if the Dominicans assassinate
Trujillo, that is all right. But we don't want
anything to pin this on us, because we aren't
doing it, it is the Dominicans who are doing
it." (Dearborn, 7/29, p. 104)
Dearborn testified that this accorded with what he said had
always been his personal belief; tha& the U.S. should not be
involved in an assassination and that if an assassination
occurred it would be strictly a Dominican affair. (Dearborn
7/29, pp. 100, 101)
In contrast the CIA Station Chief, Owen, did regard the

cable as manifesting a change in U.S. policy, particularly. on

the questionof supplying arms. (Qwen p. 120) He believed the
May 29 cable was the final word in U.S. policy on this matter
.and consequently felt that the government had retreated from

its prior position, of offering material support to the dissi-
dents, and had adopted a new position of withholding such sunnort.
Owen's responsive cable to Headquarters stated:

"HQS aware extent to whieh U.S. government already
associated with assassination. If we are to at least
cover up tracks, CIA personnel directiy involved in

assassination preparation must be withdrawn."
(Station to HQS cable, 5/30/61)

HW 50955 Docld:32423525 Page 69


Immediately following the assassination, all CIA
personnel in the Dominican Republic were removed from the
country and within a few days Consul General bearborn was
back in Washington. ‘The State Department cabled the CIA station
in the Dominican Republic to destroy all records concerning
cojfitacts with dissidents and any related matters, except not to
destroy the contingency plans or the May 29, 1961 cable to Dear~
born. QS to Station cable, 5/31/61.

Cc. Immediate Post-Assassination Period

The U.S. Consulate in the Dominican Republic was quick
to dispatch its early reports that Trujillo had been assassinated,
and the U.S. communications network transmitted the report to
’ President Kennedy in Paris. The President's Press Secretary,
Pierre Salinger, made the first public announcement of the
assassination, preceeding by several hours release of the news
a in the Dominican Republic. Secretary of State Rusk testified
that when he learned of Salinger's announcement he was most con-
cerned. Rusk said that Trujillo's son Ramfis was also in Paris
and he was afraid that Ramfis, upon first learning of his
- father's death from the press secretary to the President of the
U.S., might try to retaliate against President Kennedy. (Rusk,

32, 33.)

* SCHNEIDER REPORT

I. Summary .

“On September 4, 1970, Dr. Salvador Allende Gossens won a plurality

in Chile's Presidential election.* Since no candidate had received a

¢

xi

majority of the popular vote, the Chilean constitution required that

a joint session of its Congress ‘decide between. the first and second place
finishers. This constitutional requirement had, in the past, been pro-

forma. The Congress had always selected the candidate who received

highest popular vote. The date set for the Congressional joint session

was October 24, 1970.
On September 15, 1970, President Richard Nixon informed CIA Director
Richard Helms that an Allende regime in Chile would not be acceptable to

the United States. The CIA was instructed by President Nixon to play a

direct role in organizing a military coup d'etat in Chile to prevent
Allende's accession to the presidency. The Agency was to take this action

without coordination with the Departments of State or Defense and without |
informing the U.S. Ambassador in Chile. While coup possibilities in

general and other means of seeking to prevent Allende's accession to

power were explored by the 40 Committee throughout this period, the 40
Committee was never informed of this direct CIA role. Nor did it ever :

approve that role. ‘The only institution to which the Agency was to re-

port, both for informational and approval purposes, was the White House.

‘pr. Allende, a long-time Senator and founder of the Socialist Party in
Chile, was a candidate of Popular Unity Coalition. The Coalition was made '
up ef Communists, Socialists, Social Democrats, Radicals, and dissident !
Christian Democrats. Allende was a self-proclaimed Marxist and was making r
his fourth try for the presidency. His opponents were Radomire Tomic Romero, i
candidate of the ruling Christian Democratic Party, and Jorge Alessandri !
Rodriquez, candidate of the right-wing National Party. Dr. Allende won
__ 36.3% of the popular vote; Alessandri was second with 35.34% of the vote.
“pr. Allende's margin of victory was 39,000 votes out of ‘a‘total of 3 mil-
lion votes cast in the election. The incumbent President, Eduardo Frei
Montalvo, a Christian Democrat, was ineligible for re-election. Chilean
law prohibits Presidents from succeeding themselves.

NW 50955 Docid:32423525 Page 73

- In practice, this meant that the CIA was to keep the President's Assis~

tant for National Security Affairs, Henry Kissinger, informed of its

activities.

Between October 5 and October 20, 1970, the CIA made 21 contacts
with key military and Carabinero (police) officials in Chile. Those
Chileans who, were inclined to stage a coup were given assurances of
strong support at the highest levels of the U.S. Government, both be-
fore and after a coup.

One of the major obstacles faced by all the military conspirators
in Chile was the strong opposition to a coup by the Commander-in-Chief
of the Army, General Rene Schneider, who insisted the constitutional
process. be followed. As a.result of his strong constitutional stand,
the removal of General Schneider became a necessary ingredient in the
coup plans of all the Chilean conspirators. Unable to have General
Schneider retired or reassigned, the conspirators decided to kidnap
him. An unsuccessful abduction attempt was made on October 19, 1970,
by a group of Chilean military officers whom the CIA was actively sup-
porting. A second kidnap attempt was made the following day, again un-
successfully. In the early morning hours of October 22, 1970, machine

guns and ammunition were passed by the CIA to the group that had failed

on October 19! ‘That same day General Schneider was mortally

wounded in an attempted kidnap on his way to work. The attempted
kidnap and the shooting was apparently conducted by conspira~

tors other than those to whom the CIA had provided weapons earlier

in the day. i

2425925 Page 74



yo

A Chilean military court found that high-ranking military officers,

both active and retired, conspired to bring about’ a military coup and

to kidnap General Schneider. Several of the officers whom the CIA had io
contacted and encouraged in their coup conspiracy were convicted of con-
spiring to kidnap General Schneider. Those convicted of carrying out

the “actual kidnap attempt and the killing of General Schneider were assoc—

iates of retired General Roberto Viaux, who had initially been thought by

the CIA to be the best hope. However, later the CIA discouraged General
Viaux because the Agency felt other officers, such as General Camilo

Valenzuela, were not sufficiently involved. General Viaux was convicted by the

military court and received a twenty-year prison seatence for being

the "intellectal author" of the Schneider kidnap attempt. General we
Valenzuela was sentenced by the military court to three years in exile —
for taking part in the conspiracy te prevent Allende'’s assumption of

office. The military court found that the two Generals had been in i

contact throughout the coup plotting.

The principal facts leading up to the death of General Schneider (all
of which are discussed in more detail below) aré as follows:

Il. By the end of September 1970, it appeared that the only feasible
way for the CIA to implement the Presidential order to prevent Allende from

coming to power was to foment a coup d'etat.

2. All of the known coup plots developed within the Chilean mili-
. tary entailéd the removal of General Schneider by one means or another.

3. United States officials continued to encourage and support Chilean
powrage and aM ae
plans for a coup after it became known that the:first step would be to

kidnap General Schneider.

BERS eee

4. Two unsuccessful kidnap attempts were made, one on October 19,
the other on October 20. Following these attempts, and with knowledge
of their failure, the CIA passed three submachine guns and ammunition +
to Chilean officers who still planned to kidnap General Schneider. :
5. In a third kidnap attempt on October 22, apparently conducted
by Chileans other than those to whom weapons had been supplied, General
Schneider was shot and subsequently died. The guns used in the abor-

tive kidnapping of General Schneider were, in all probability, not those

supplied by the CIA to the conspirators, The Chilean military court
which investigated the Schneider killing determined that Schneider had
been murdered by handguns, although one machine gun was at the scene of

the killing.*

6.’ While there is no question that the CIA received a direct -
instruction from the President on September 15th to attempt to foment
a coup, the Committee received sharply conflicting testimony about

whether the White House was kept informed of, and authorized, the

coup efforts in Chile after October 15. On one side of the conflict

is the testimony of Henry Kissinger and General Alexander Haig; on the
other, that of CIA officials. Kissinger testified that the White House
stood down CIA efforts to promote a military coup d'etat in Chile on _
October 15, 1970. After that date, Kissinger testified--and Haig. agreed-~

thus authorized by the White House.”
This conflict in testimony, which the Committee has been unable

to resolve through its hearings or the documentary record, leaves un-

answered the most serious question of whether the CIA was acting
pursuant to higher authority (the CIA's view) or was pursuing coup
activities in Chile without sufficient communication (the Kissinger/

Haig view).

*

The basic. issue is whether or not the CIA~informed.the White House of ”
its activities. In context, informing was tantamount to being authorized.
No one who testified believed that the CIA was required to seek step-by-
step authorization for its activities; rather the burden was on.the White
House to object if a line of activity being pursued by the CIA seemed .
unwise. Both Kissinger and Haig agreed that if the CIA had proposed a persua- |.

sive plan to them, it almost certainly would have been approved, The CIA
did not believe it needed specific White House authorization to transfer wea~

pons to the’Chileans; in fact, CIA Deputy Director (Plans) Thomas
‘Karamessines testified that he did not formally approve the transfer,
but rather that in the context of the project it was clear that the
Agency had the authority to transfer weapons and that it was clear to
Karamessines'- subordinates that he would approve their decision to do
so. He believed he probably was informed before the weapons actually
were sent. ~ . ~~ _ :

President's Initial General Instruction and Background

A. September 15 White House Meeting

Qn September 15, 1970,’ President Nixon met with his Assistant for

ae
Day

National Security Affairs, Henry Kissinger, CIA Director Richard Helms, —
and Attorney General John Mitchell at the White House. The topic was

Chile. Handwritten notes taken by Director Helms at that meeting re-

flect both its tenor and the President's instructions:

1 in 10 chance perhaps, but save Chilet
worth spending

not concerned risks involved

no involvement of Embassy

$10,000,000 available, more if necessary
full-time job--best men we have

game plan -

make the economy scream

48 hours for plan of action

In his testimony before the Select Committee, Director Helms recalled
coming away from the meeting on September 15 with:
.-. (the) impression...that the President came down

very hard that he wanted something done, and he .
didn't much care how and that he was prepared to ‘

make money available....This was a pretty all- ‘
inclusive order....If I ever carried a marshall's r
baton in my knapsack out of the Oval Office, it . —

was that day.* (Helms testimony, July 15, pp. 6,10,11)

* Director Helms also testified that the September 15th meeting with
President Nixon may have been triggered by-the presence of Augustin
Edwards, the publisher of the Santiago daily El Mercurio, in Washing-
ton. That morning, at the request of Donald Kendall, President of
Pepsi Cola, Henry Kissinger and John Mitchell had met for breakfast
with Kendall and Edwards. (Mitchell calendar) The topic of conversa-
tion was the political situation in Chile. and the plight of El Mercurio :
and other anti-Allende forces. ‘According to Mr. Helms:

-F recall that prior to this meeting (with the President)
the editor of Ei Mercurio had come to Washington. and -

I had been.asked to go and talk- to him at one of the
hotels here, this having been arranged through Don
Kendall, the head of the Pepsi Cola Company..,.I have

this impression that the President called this meeting “ men
where I have my handwritten notes because of Edwards!
/ presence in Washington and what he heard from Kendall
R about what Edwards was saying about conditions in
Chile and what was happening there.
(Helms testimony, July 15, pp. 4-5)



Hloweyers;noné of ithe CIA officers believed that assassination was within

“i the guidelines Helms had been given.

Senator Hart of Colorado. ...did the kind of carte
blanche mandate you carried, the marshall’s baton

that you carried out in a knapsack, to stop Allende
from assuming office, include physical elimination?

Mr. Helms. Well, not in my mind, because when I be~
came Director, T had already made up my mind that we
weren't going to have any of that business when I was

. Director, and I had made that clear to my fellows, and
I think they will tell you this.

The following day, September 16, Director Helms called a meeting

at the CIA to discuss the Chilean situation. At this meeting, he re-

lated to his colleagues his understanding of the President's instruc-
tions:

2. The Director told the group that President
Nixon had decided that an Allende” regime in Chile
was unacceptable to the United States. The Presi-
dent asked the Agency to prevent Allende from com-
ing to power or to unseat him. The President
authorized $10,000,000 for this purpose, if needed. ~ . ad
Further, the Agency is to carry out this mission

without coordination with the Departments of State

er Defense.

Henry Kissinger's recollection of the September 15 meeting with

President Nixon is in accord with that of Richard Helms* Although
- Dr. Kissinger did not recall the President's instructions to be as
precise as those related by Director Helms, he did testify that: i

- ...the primary thrust of the September 15th meeting
was to urge Helms to do whatever he could to prevent
Allende from being seated. (Kissinger testimony, p. 13)

x
The documents, and the officials from whom the Committee has heard

testimony, are in substantial agreement about what President Nixon
authorized on September 15, namely CIA involvement in promoting a
military coup d'etat in Chile. There is not, -however, agreement
about what was communicated between the CIA and the White House-—
and hence what was authorized by the latter--in the week, between -
October 15 and the death of General Schneider, October 22. This

. matter will be discussed in Part V of this report on the Schneider

i killing.

“It is clear that President Nixon wanted him (Helms)
to encourage the Chilean military to cooperate or
to take the initiative in preventing Allende from
taking office. (Kissinger testimony, p. 12)

Operationally, the CIA set the President's instructions into motion
on September 21. On that day two cables were sent from CIA Headquarters ©

to Santiago informing the CIA Chief of Station (COS) of his new directive:

3. Purpose of exercise is to prevent Allende as-
sumption of power. Parliamentary legerdemain has
been discarded. Military solution is objective.

(Hqs. to Stn. 236, 21 September 1970)

B. (Track Two)--This is authority granted to CIA
only, to work toward a military solution to problem.
As part of authority we were expltcitly told that
40 Committee, State, Ambassador and Embassy were
not to be told of this.Track Two nor involved in any
matter. (Hqs. to Stn. 240,. 21 September.1970)-

B. Background: Tracks I and IL

United States Government concern over an Allende regime in Chile

did not begin with President Nixon's September 15 instruction to the

CIA. * For more than a year, Chile had been on the 40 Committee's agenda.
At an April 15, 1969, meeting of the 303 Committee (the predecessor of
the 40 Committee) the question arose as to whether anything should be

done with regard to the September 1970 Presidential election in Chile.

* a2 :
Covert U.S. Government involvement in large-scale political action
programs in Chile began with the 1964 Presidential election. As in
1970, this was in response to the perceived. threat of Salvadore
Allende. Over $3 million was spent by the CIA in the 1964 effort.

2ffective unless an early enough start is made. On March 25,

the 40 Committee approved a joint Embassy/CIA proposal recom

mending that "spoiling" operations~-propaganda and other activities--

be undertaken by the CIA in an effort to prevent’ an election victory

by Allende's Popular Unity (UP) Coalition. A total of $135,000 was

“authorized by the 40 Committee for this anti-Allende activity. on

June 18, 1970, the U.S. Ambassador to Chile, Edward Korry, submitted a ‘

two-phase proposal to the Department of State and the CIA for review,

The first. phase involved an increase in support to the anti-Allende,

campaign. The sécond was a contingency plan to make "a $500,000 effort
in Congress te persuade certain: shifts in voting on 24 October 1970."

Phase ii was, stated simply, a proposal to bribe Chilean Congressmen to

vote against Allende should he win a plurality in the September 4 elec-

“tion. On June 27, 1970, the 40 Committee increased funding for the

anti-Allende "spoiling" operation to $390,000. A decision on Ambassador
Korry's bribe proposal was deferred pending the results of the September 4: ;

election. : H

The 40 Committee met twice between the time Allende received a plural-—
ity of the popular vote on September 4 and President Nixon issued his
insttuction to Director Helms on September 15** At both ‘these meetings the : po
question of U.S. involvement in a military ‘coup against Allende was raised . ;

**Following the September 4 election, the C1A's Directorate.of Intelli~
gence circulated an intelligence community assessment of the impact of
an Allende government on U.S. national interests. That assessment,
dated September 7, 1970, stated: .

Regarding threats to U.S. interests, we conclude that:

i. |The U.S. has no vital national interests within Chile.
There would, however, be tangible economic losses.

2. The world military balance of power would not be sig-
nificantly altered by an Allende government.

3. An Allende victory would, however, create consider~ :
able, political and psychological costs: .

a. Hemispheric cohesion would be threatened by
the challenge that an Allende government .
would pose to the OAS, and by the reactions
that it would create in other countries.
We do not see, however, any likely threat
te the peace of the region.

b. An Allende victory would represent. a defin-
ite psychological set-back to the U.S. and
a definite psychological advance for the
Marxist idea. (Intelligence Memorandum/ . :

I, think the meeting of September 15th has to be
seen in the context of two previous meetings of
~ the 40 Committee on September 8th and September
Sy gad 14th in which the 40 Committee was asked to Look
at the pros and cons and the problems and pros~
pects of a Chilean military coup to be organized
with United States assistance.
(Kissinger testimony, p. 5)

Actording to the summary of the 40 Committee meeting on September

8, the following was discussed:

++-all concerned realized that previous plans for

a Phase II would’ have to be drastically redrawn....
The DCI made the point, however, that congressional
action against Allende was not likely to succeed
and that once Allende was in office the Chilean : :
opposition to him would disintegrate and collapse
rapidly. While not advocating a specific course

of action, the Director further observed that a
military golpe against Allende would have very
little chance of success unless ‘undertaken soon.
Both the Chairman and the Attorney General supported
this view....At the close of the...meeting the
Chairman directed the Embassy to: prepare a "cold-
blooded assessment" of:

’ 1) the pres and cons and problems and pros-
: pects involved should a Chilean military : :
coup be organized now with U.S. assistance, , :

and 2 i y

2) the pros and cons and problems and pros— : a

. future Chilean opposition to Allende. " =

Ambassador Korry responded.to the 40 Committée's request for a
“cold-blooded assessment" on Septembér 12. He stated that "We /the
‘Embassy] believe it now clear that Chilean military will not, repeat

not, move to prevent Allende's accession, barring unlikely situation

of national. chaos and widespread violence." The Ambassador went on to

say that "Our own military people /are/. unanimous in rejecting possi- =

bility of meaningful: military intervention in political situation.”

He concluded by stating: "What we are saying in this ‘cold~blooded
assessment’. is that opportunities for further ‘significant USG action

with the Childan military are nonexistent."

(Memorandum/Ambassador' s
Response to Request for, Analysis of Military Option in Present Chilean
Situation, 12 September 1970)

The. CIA's ‘response was in the same vein. Viron Vaky, Kissinger's
assistant. for Latin American affairs. on the NSC staff, summarized the-
CIA's "cold-blooded assessment" in a memo,to his boss: "Military act
‘tion is impossible; the military is incapable and unwilling to seize
power. We have no capability to motivate or instigate a coup." (Memo-

“randum for Dr. Kissinger/Chile--40 Committee Meeting, Monday-~September 14,

September 14, Viron P. Vaky)

On September 14, the 40 Committee met to: discuss these reports and
what: action was to be taken:

Particular attention was devoted to a CIA prepared :
review of political and military options in the :
Chilean electoral situation based on the Embassy’
and Station's "cold-blooded assessment." The Com-
mittee focused on the so-called "Rube Goldberg"
gambit which would see Alessandri elected by the
Congress on October 24th, resigning thereafter to
leave Frei constitutionally free-to run in a second
election for the presidency. . . i

“Frei ‘to see if he would be willing to commit himself to

that a propaganda campaign be undertaken by the Agency

Following the September 14 Forty Committee meeting and President
Nixon's September 15 instruction to the CIA, U.S. Government efforts

x
to prevent Allende from assuming office proceeded on two tracks. Track

I comprised all covert activities approved by the 40 Committee, in~
cluding the $250,000 contingency fund to bribe Chilean congressmen as
well as propaganda and economic activities. These activities were

designed to induce the opponents to Allende in Chile to prevent his

assumption of power, either through political or military means. Track

*the terms Track T and Track IL were known only to CIA and White House
tee officials who were knowledgeable about the President's September 15 order

. quiring if they were, in fact, not knowledgeable of the Track II activities.
Those letters were sent to Secretary of State William Rogers, Secretary of
Defense Melvin Laird, Deputy Secretary of Defense David Packard, Under-
secretary of State for Political Affairs U. Alexis Johnson, Chairman of
the Joint Chiefs of Staff Admiral Thomas Moorer, NSC Staff Member for
Latin America Viron P. Vaky, Director of the State Department's Bureau

in Santiago Harry W. Shlaudeman. Thus far the Committee has received
written responses from Messrs. Moorer, Johnson, Vaky, Shiaudeman and Cline.
All except Cline have indicated that they had no knowledge of the Track IT
activity at the time; Cline indicated he heard of the activities ina
general way, from his subordinate who handled 40 Committee work and from

former associates at the CIA. In oral communications with Committee :

eof Wactivities <in Chile were undertaken in response to President Nixon's
its :

September 15 order and were directed towards actively promoting and

encouraging the Chilean military to move against Allende. In ‘his testimony ial

before the Committee, Kissinger stressed the links between Tracks L

’ T and Il:

...There was work by all of the agencies to try to
prevent Allende from being seated, and there was
work by all of the agencies on the so-called Track
I to encourage the military to move against Allende
...the difference between the September 15th meet-
ing and what was being done in general within the
government was that President Nixon was encouraging
4 more direct role for the CIA in actually organiz-
ing such a coup. (Kissinger testimony, p- 13)

Tracks I and II did, in fact, move togefher in the month 4

September, 15. The authorization to Ambassader Korry, who was formally
excluded from Track II, to encourage a military coup became broader and —
broader. In the 40 Committee meeting on September 14, he and other

"appropriate members of the Embassy Mission” were authorized to inten- i

sify their contacts with Chilean military officers to assess their

willingness to support the "Frei gambit"--a voluntary turn-over of

power to the military by Fret, who. would then have been eligible to

run for President in new elections. (tenotandum/Policy Decisions Related

- to Our Covert Action Involvement in the Séptember 1970 Chilean Presiden-
tial Election, 9 October 1970) ,

in a situation report to Dr, Kissinger and Assistant Secretary

Charles Meyer on September 21, Ambassador Korry indicated that in order

to make the Frei gambit work, "if necessary, General Schneider would

HW 50955 DocId:32423525 Page 86


ys Uhave to be neutralized, by displacement if necessary."

eo 13.

* (Korry to

Meyer and Kissinger/Situation Report, 21 September 1970) In testifying,
Kissinger felt the Korry report indicated "the degree to which Track
i and Track II were merging, that is. to say, that individuals on Track
I were working on exactly the same problem as the CIA was working on
Track Il." (Kissinger testimony, p. 21)

ambassador Korry's activites in Chile between September 4 and
October 24 support Kissinger's view that the Line separating Track I
and Track It often became blurred. For example, the Ambassador was
authorized to make his contacts in the Chilean military aware that if
Allende were seated, the military could exp®ct no further military
assistance (MAP) from the United States. Later, in response to his own
tecommendation, Korry was authorized to inform the Chilean military that
all MAP and military gales were being held in abeyance pending the outcome
of the Congressional election on October 24. On October 7, Ambassador

Korry received the following cable from Kissinger and Under Secretary

“In this same situation report, Ambassador Korry related a message that
he had sent te President Frei through his Defense Minister indicating
the economic pressures that would be brought to bear on Chile should
Allende assume office.

Frei should know that not a nut-er bolt will be
allowed to reach Chile under Allende. Once
Allende comes to power we shall do all within
our power to condemn Chile and the Chileans to
utmost deprivation and poverty, a policy designed
for a long time to come to accelerate the hard
features of a Communist society in Chile. Hence,
for Frei to believe that there will be much of
“Zn alternative to utter misery, such as seeing
Chile muddle through, would be strictly illusory.

The use of economic instruments as levers on Frei and.the Chilean
military was a persistent subject of White House/CIA discussions

and of instructions to the field. Helms’ notes‘ from the September “
15 meeting with the President and Kissinger included the notation

"make the economy scream." Economic leverage was the primary

topic of a September 18 White House meeting involving Kissinger,

Helms and Karamessines.



-14-

2. ..-you are now authorized to inform discreetly
the Chilean’ military through the channels available
to you that if a successful effort is made to block
Allende from taking office, we would reconsider the
cuts we have thus far been forced to make in Chilean
MAP and otherwise increase our presently programmed
MAP for the Chilean Armed Forces.... If any steps
the military should take should result in civil dis-
~ order, we would also be prepared promptly to deliver
support and materiai that might be immediately re-
quired. (igs. to Stn. 075517, 7 October 1970)

The essential difference between Tracks I and II, as evidenced by
instructions to Ambassador Korry during this period, was not that Track

IL was coup-oriented and Track I was not. Both had this objective in

mind. The difference between the two tracks was, simply, that the CIA's

direct contacts with the Chilean military, and its active promotion and

support for a coup, were to be known only to a small group of individuals
in the White House and the CIA. Kissinger testified that Track If
matters were to be reported directly to the White House "for reasons

of security." (Kissinger testimony, p. 14) Thomas Karamessines, the
CIA's Deputy Director for Plans at the time and the principal CIA
contact with.the White House on Track II matters, testified on his
understanding of why State, Defense, the 40 conmi ttee and Ambassador
Korry were-excluded from Track II: oe

That was not a decision that we made. But the

best I can do is suggest that there was concern
about two things. Number one, that there might

be serious objections lodged, for example, by

the State Department particularly if Track 2

were to be laid out at a Forty Committee meeting.
“And the only other thing I can contribute to that

is that it was felt that the security of the
activity would be better protected if knowledge

of it were limited. (Karamessines testimony, p. 122)

pol oe,
C. CIA Views of Difficulty of Project
i

.\On one point the testimony of CIA officials who were involved in

‘track II is unanimous: they all said they thought Track II was unlikely R
to succeed. That view ran from the working levels of the Agency to the
top. They all said they felt they were being asked to do the impossible,
that the risks and potential costs of the project were too great. At
the same time, they felt they had been given an explicit Presidential

order, and they tried to execute that order.

A few excerpts from the testimony follow:

Richard Helms, CIA Director -

-..my heart sank over this meeting, because...the
possibility of bringing off somefhing like this
seamed to me at that. time to be just as remote as
anything could be. In practical terms, the Army
was constitutionalist....And when you look here at

the time frame in which the man was suddenly asking Cea
you to accomplish something, it seemed really almost
inconceivable....

y What I came away from the meeting with
the distinct impression that we were being
asked to do almost the impossible and trying
to indicate this was going to be pretty tough.
(elms testimony, July 15, 1975, pp. 6-7)

David Phillips, Chief, Chile Task Force -

«.-it is my feeling that the odds are unaccept-
able, it is something that is not going to work,

. . and we aré going to be burned if we get into it
».-what are the chances of pulling off a coup
successfully, or in any way stopping Allende from
assuming the presidency?...we never even got to
two chances out of 20. (Phillips testimony, p. 16)

-»».L assure you that those people that I
_was in touch with at the Agency just about univers-
ally said, my God, why are we given this assignment?
(Phillips testimony, p. 53)

James Flannery, Deputy Chief, Western Hemisphere Division -

There was just no question that we had to make

. this effort, no matter what the odds were. And

£ I think that most people felt that the odds were
N just pretty-long. (Flannery testimony, p. 20)



5 -16-

Further, CIA officials believed their judgment of the endeavor's
difficulty was known to the White House. Helms commented on the Septem-
ber 15th meeting: "So realizing all of these things, I'm relatively
certain that day that I pointed out this is going to be awfully tough."
(Helms testimony, July 15, 1975, p. 16) Karamessines recalled pointing
out to the President that "the Chilean military seemed to be disorganized

and unwilling to do anything. And without their wanting to do something,

there did not seem to be much hope." (Karamessines testimony, p. 10)

“Implementation of Track IT

&. Evolution of CIA Strategy

The President's instruction to the CLA on September 15 to prevent
Allende's assumption of power was given in the context of a broad U.S.
. Government effort to achieve that end. The September 15 instruction
to the CIA involved from the beginning the promotion of a military coup
d'etat in Chile. Although theré was talk of a coup in Chilean military
circles, there was little indication that it would actually take place
without active U.S. encouragement and support.

There was much talk among Chilean officers about
the possibility of some kind of coup...but this
was not the kind of talk that was being backed by,
you know, serious organizational planning.

{Karamessines testimony, Aug. 6, 1963, p. 32)

1, The “Constitutional Coup" Approach

Although efforts to achieve a political solution to the Allende
victory continued simultaneous with Track IL, the Agency premised its

activities on the assumption that the political avenue was a dead end.

On September 21, CIA Headquarters cabled its Station in Santiago:
Purpose of exercise is to prevent Allende assump-
tion of power, Paramilitary legerdemain has been

discarded. Military solution is objective.
(Hqs. 236, Sept. 21, 1970, para. 3)

The initial strategy attempted, to enlist President Frei in promoting
a coup to perpetuate his presidency for six nore years. The Agency
decided to promise "help in any election which was an outgrowth of a
successful military takeover." (Nov. 18, 1970 Helms memo to Kissinger)
Under this plan Frei would invite the military to take over, dissolve the

Congress, and proclaim a new election. A private U.S. citizen who had

been a conduit for CIA funds to Frei's 1964 campaign was sent to see him

with this message on\September 24. (Task Force Log, September 23)

: Thomas ‘Karamessines, the Deputy Director for Plans, testified:

So this was in a sense not Track II, but in a
sense another aspect of a quiet and hopefully fe
non-violent military coup....This was abandoned —
when the military were reluctant to push Frei
publicly...and, number two, Frei was reluctant
to Leave on his own in the absence of pressure

” from the military....There was left as the only
chance of success a straight military coup.

(Karamessines testimony, Aug. 6, 1975, p. 6)

At the same time, the Station in Santiago reported:

Strong reasons for thinking neither Frei nor

Schneider will act. For that reason any scenario

in which either has to play an active role now

appears utterly unrealistic. Overtures to lower

echelon officers (é.g., Valenzueha) can of course

be made. This involves promoting Army split.
(Stn. to Hqs. 424, September 23, 1970)

2. Military Solution
President Frei's failure even to attempt to persuade his own party
convention on October 3-4 from reaching a compromise with Allende ended

all hope of using him to prevent an Allende presidency. (November 18

5 memo, Heims to Kissinger, page 16) Thus, by the beginning of October, ge
it was clear that a vehicle for a military solution would have to be

found in the second echelon of Chilean officers, and that the top leader-
ship of the Armed Services, particularly General Rene Schneider, consti- o
tuted a stumbling block. (Santiago 424, September 23, 1970; Santiago 439,
September 30, 19706) The Agency's task was to cause a coup in a highly

unpromising situation and to overcome the formidable obstacles represented
by Frei's inaction, Schneider's strong constitutionalism, and the absence

of organization and. enthusiasm among those officers who were interested

in a coup.

A three-fold program was set into motion:

B. The Chile Task Force

Because of the highly sensitive nature of the operation, a special
task force was created in the CIA's Western Hemisphere Division to manage it.
The task force was placed under the daily direction of the Deputy Direc~

tor for Plans, Thomas Karamessines, and a group of the Agency's most

experienced and skilled operators. were detailed to the task force.

*A cable sent from CIA Headquarters to Santiago on October 19 focused
on creating an appropriate justification for a coup. The cable stated:

i. It still appears that Ref A coup has no pretext or justification
that it can offer to make it acceptable in Chile or Latin America. It
therefore would seem necessary to create one to bolster what will prob-
ably be their claim to a coup to save Chile from communism...You may —
wish include variety of themes in justification of coup to military for "

- . their use. These could include but are not limited to: A) Firm intel,
that Cubans planned to reorganize all intelligence services along
Soviet/Cuban mold thus creating structure for police state....B)Economic
situation collapsing:...C)By quick recognition of Cuba and Communist
countries Allende assumed U.S. would cut off material assistance to
Armed Forces thus weakening them as constitutional barriers. Would then
empty armories to Communist Peoples Militia with task to run campaign of
terror based on alleged labor and economic sabotage (Use some quotes
from Allende on this.)

2. Station has written some excellent prop guidances. Using themes

at hand and which best known to you we are now asking you to prepare
intel report based on some well known facts and some fiction to justify
coup, split opposition, and gain adherents for military group. With
appropriate military contact can determine how to "discover" intel’ report
which could even he planted during raids planned vby. Carabineros.

3. We urge you to get this idea and some concrete suggestions to plot
ters as soon as you can, Coup should have a justification to-prosper. =

David'A. Phillips, Chief of Station in Rio de Janeiro, was summoned -

back to Washington to head the operation. With the exception of the

Division Chief, William Broe, his deputy James Flannery and the head

of the Chile Branch, no other officers in the Division were aware of the —
task force's activities, not even those officers who normally had respon~
sibility for Chile. The ‘task force had a special communications channel to

Santiago and Buenos Aires to compartment cable traffic about Track IL.

(November 18, 1970, Helms to Kissinger memo, page 3) Most of the
significant operational decisions were made by Phillips, Broe and
Karamessines, who met on a daily basis.

It should be noted that all those involwed with the task force des—

cribed the pressure from the White House as intense. Indeed, Karamessines

has said that Kissinger "left no doubt in my mind that he was under the
heaviest of pressure to get this accomplished, and he in turn was plac~
‘ing us under the heaviest of pressures to get it accomplished." (Kara-

messines testimony, August 6, 1975, page 7) The Deputy Chief of the

Western Hemisphere Division, James Flannery, testified that pressure was
"as tough as I ever saw it in my time there, extreme." (Flannery testi-

‘mony, July 15, 1975, page 20) Broe testified that "I have never gone

through a period as we did on the Chilean thing. I mean it was just

constant, constant. -It was coming from the

«Just continual pressure.

White House." (Broe testimony, August 4, 1975, page 55)

Cc, The Use of the Army Attache and Interagency Relations

sy

The CiA*Station in Santiago had inadequate contacts within the
Chilean military to carry out its task. However, the U.S. Army At-

tache in Santiago, Colonel Paul Wimert, knew the; hilean ‘military

MW 50955 Dockd:32423525 Page 94


aa)

<?contuéts among the Chilean officers. Following a proposal by the Chief

of Station, the CiA decided to enlist Colonel Wimert in collecting in-

telligence concerning the possibility of a coup and to use him as a
channel to let the interested Chilean military know of U. S. support
for a coup. Karamessines described this procedure for the Committee:

We also needed contact with a wider segment of the military,
the senior military which we had not maintained and did not
have, but which we felt confident that our military represea-
tative in Chile had....And we got the approval of the DIA to :
enlist the cooperation of Colonel Wimert in our effort to pro- —
cure intelligence.

(Karamessines testimony, August 6, 1975, p. 6)

To obtain Wimert's services, CIA officials prepared a suggested mes-
sage for the Director cf DIA to send to the Army Attache in Santiago

through CIA communications channels. Because the DIA Director, General

Donald V. Bennett, was in Europe on official business, the Deputy —

Director of Central Intelligence, General Cushman, invited DIA Deputy

Director Lt. General Jammie M. Philpott to his office on September 28,

1970.* During that meeting, General Cushman requested the assistance of Fe

the Army Attache, and General Philpott signed a Letter which authorized —
- transmission of a message directing the Army Attache: : .

to work closely with the CAS chief, or in his absence,
his deputy, in contacting and advising-the principal mili-
tary figures who might play a decisive role in any move which
might, eventually, deny the presidency to Allende.

Do not, repeat not, advise the Ambassador or the Defense At-
tache of this message, or give them any indication of its
portent. In the course of your routine activities, act in
accordance with the Ambassador's instructions. Simultaneously,

be knowledgeable. CAS will identify them. (Headquarters 380
to Santiago)

For this and all subsequent messages intended for the Army Attache,
the secret CIA communications channel was used.

. Both General Philpott and Thomas Karamessines testified that ini-
tially the Army Attache would be used only to “obtain or procure” in-

telligence on Chilean military officers.* (Philpott, p. 11; Karamessines,

p- 6) The September 28, 1970 message to the Army Attache, however, did —
in fact trigger his deep invoivement in the coup attempt. According to
the Attache's testimony, he received day~to-day instructions -from the

Chief of Station, and on occasion, the COS would show him messages

ostensibly from Generals Bennett and/or Philpott, directing him to

take certain actions. The COS also transmitted messages from the Army —
Attache to these Generals.
aa General Bennett testified that he never had knowledge of Track IL
- and that he never received.any communication relating thereto, nor did ee
he ever authorize the transmission of any messages to the Army Attache. - —

- - General Philpett also testified that he had no recollection of anything

connected with Track II after his initial meeting with General Cushman

on September 28. (Philpott, p. 16)
U. S. Army Colonel Robert C. Roth, who in September and October 1970

was the Chief of the Human Resources Division, Director of Collection, DIA,

* In this connection it should be noted that when questioned about
this letter, General Philpott testified that he recalled,signing oo
an authorization such as that contained in the first. ‘paragraph of fer
Headquarters 380 but that he did not’ recall..the! au horizations and ne
—

ae :

%

HW 50955 Dockd:32423525 Page 96


testified that he recalled working for Generals Bennett and Philpote on
“a priority requirement to identify Chilean personalities who might be

helpful in preventing the election of Allende as President of Chile."

(Roth, Vol. I, p. 6) Though Roth recalls no mention of Track II as such,
the goal of this mission is identical to that described in the message
‘ of September 28 bearing Philpott's signature.

Beginning on October 15, Roth kept a chronology of his activities

connected with Chile. This chronology reflects that there was a meeting
on October 21 regarding the preparation of biographic material on Chilean
generals’ which focused on their willingness to participate in a military
coup. Generals Bennett, Philpott, and a CIA representative attended.

The chronology also shows that on October 21, Roth delivered a message to

Mr. Broe ‘to be sent ‘by CIA channels.* A message was sent to Col. Wimert
that same day, ostensibly from General Bennett, which authorized: i

FYI: . Suspension temporarily imposed on MAP and FMS has

Chilean figures to Mr.-Broe at CIA. . Philpott also instructed him that

* Roth believes that General Philpott directed him to deliver this
message and also pressed him on several occasions to seek a re-
~ sponse from Broe to an earlier message to Colonel Wimert. (Roth,
Vol. II, p. ) : s

“any further action on the subject would henceforth be the responsibility

of the CIA and that DIA would perform normal support functions." (Roth,

p. 8)*
Both Bennett and Philpott testified that the activities described °
by Roth were routine DIA activities. However, Colonel Roth testified: -

I believe my impression at the time, or my recollection, is

that I was informed that there was concern at the highest

U.S. Governmental level over the: possible election of Allende,
that DIA then had a priority responsibility of coming up with
the identities of ‘key Chilean personalities that would be help- .
ful, ‘and so forth. I have nothing specific as to the nature of
the instructions or the channels through which they came.

Q. It was your sense at the time that you were working on a
project that if it had not been initiated by, at least had
the attention of or concern of, the highest level?

* Roth's chronclogy also indicates that Philpott had asked that Broe
be queried Gn two or three occasions regarding a report from Wimert
and that Philpott instructed that only he (Philpott) would commini-
cate with Cushman if the need arose. (Roth, p. 11) Roth also testi-,
_ fied that Philpott advised him that communications with Wimert would
be by CIA channels. (Roth, P- 41)

Cotonel Roth. That was my impression at the time.

Q. You understand from your work in the Defense Department

‘that the highest level of government usually indicated the

President of the United States?

Colonel Roth. I would assume that.

-The CIA produced copies of several messages which identify
Genérals Bennett and Philpott as either the sender or recipient. Among
these documents is a message relating to Track TI which bears Philpott's
purported signature. (Undated message. ca..14 October 1970) General
Philpott admitted that the signature appears to be-his but doubted that
it was and hé could not recall signing it, or having seen it. (Philpott,
“p. } CIA also produced messages of October 14 (Headquarters 762)
and October 21 (Headquarters 934) conveying instructions from General
Bennett to the Army Attache. General Bennett’ testified he did. not
authorize these messages:

It is beyond the responsibilities which I had in the military

assistance area. Lt goes beyond the responsibility which I

had in terms that 1 would have to get the authority or the

approval of the Secretary through the Chairman for covert

action of this magnitude. This message would not have been
signed by me. (Bennett testimony, p. 21) .

- . According to Karamessines, only the White House had the authority to |

issue the directives contained in those messages (Karamessines testi~

“nony, p. 84)
The Department of Defense was unable to provide any documents bear~

ing on the issue of Wimert’s Track II instructions or responses. A

DOD file search under the direction ef General Daniel 0. Graham, the

present Director of DIA, produced no copies of commmication documents

for the September-October 1970 period. (Graham, p. 6) However, Roth

testified that detailed memoranda for the record which he prepared on «

SCIA officials maintain that they acted faithfully in transmitting |
messages to Generals Bennett and/or Philpott and in never sending a

message without proper authorization. Mr. Karamessines was particularly

forceful in this regard:

+..I can recall no instance in my experience at the Central
Intelligence Agency in which a message was received for an
“individual, an officer of the government anywhere, in what-
ever department, which was not. faithfully, directly, promptly
and fully and accurately delivered to that officer, or to his
duly authorized representative.
(Karamessines testimony, p. 79)

We may have’ played tricks overseas, but it stopped at the

water's edge, and we didn't play tricks among ourselves or.

among our colleagues within the Agency or in other agencies.
_ (Karamessines testimony, p. 79)

We could not remain in business for a day...if this had been
the practice of the Agency. It would have been no time at
all before we would have been found out, a single instance
of the’ kind of thing you are suggesting might have taken
place would havé put-us out of business.

(Karamessines testimony, p. 80)

Dr. Kissinger denied he was ever informed of the Army Attache’s' \

role or that he authorized. any messages to be sent to the Army Attache.

(Kissinger testimony, p. 22)

The investigation to date has not resolved the conflict between ‘the i .~
statements of the senior CIA, DIA and White House officials. There are '

. four possibilities that could explain the éonflict. First, Generals
Bennett and Philpott were cognizant of Track II and communicated their
general instructions to the Army Attache. This possibility would be”

contrary to. their sworn testimony. Second, General Bennett was not aware

of Track If “but General. Philpott was and communicated general instructions to-”

—

: : : i
the Army Attache, This possibility is supported by Roth's testimony Fe
but would be contrary to Philpott's swora testimony and his duty to —_

, -keep General Bennett informed. Third, the CIA acted on its own, and,

lpott, co-opted.and ordered

HW 50955 Docld:32423525 Page 100


Uthe ‘Army Attache ‘without further informing any member of the Department
of Defense of the White House. This possibility vould be contrary to
the sworn testimony of David Phillips, William Broe, Thomas Karamessines,
and William Colby. Fourth, members of the White House staff authorized —
the CIA to convey orders to the Army Attache on the basis of high or

highest government authority. Further, that the White House staff

directed that the Army Attache's superiors in the Pentagon not be in-

formed. This possibility would contradict the sworn testimony of Dr.

Kissinger and General Alexander Haig.

D. The False Flag Base

In order to minimize the risks of makin§ contact with the dissident

Chilean officers, the task force decided in late September to set up a

"False Flag Base,” i.e., to send four staff officers to Chile posing as —

nationals of other countries to supplement Colonel Wimert's contacts

st “with Chilean military officers.” Given the limitations of the Station's

resources and Colonel Wimert’s visibility, Headquarters felt the use of

. aa
“False Flag Officers" was necessary because "We don't want to miss a .
pommeee
. |
— |. chance." One. of these officers posed as a intelligence officer :
i
so that “any flap would be a one." (Headquarters 363, .

+ September 27, 1970) —

*The ‘use of,"False Flag Officers" is not, according to David Phillips,
"an unusual practice," either by the CIA or for, eign. inte} Ligence boy

services. (Phillips testimony, pp. 47-48)

NW 50955 Docild:32423525 Page i01


-27- +

The False Flaggers were compartmented from each other and reported
separately on their contacts to a "deep cover" CIA officer in Santiago

who in turn reported to the Station. According to the testimony of the

Chief of Station, they received their instructions from Washington and —
not from him. (Chief of Station testimony (Felix), August 1, 1975, p. 27)
VE, Chief of Station
Although most of the Station officers in Santiago did not know of

Track II, the Chief and Deputy Chief of Station were knowledgeable and

the Chief of Station initiated contacts on his own with Chilean officers.
The COS has testified that he regarded Track II as unrealistic:

I had left no doubt in the minds-»f my colleagues
and superiors that I did not consider any kind of
intervention in those constitutional processes
desirable....And one of ‘the reasons certainly for my
last recall.(to Washington) was-to be read the riot
act--which was done in a very pleasant, but very
intelligible manner. Specifically, I was told at
that time that the Agency was not too interested in :
continuously being told by me that certain proposals .
which had been made could not be executed, or would i
be counterproductive. (Chief of Station (Felix) :
testimony, August 1, 1975, p. 10) . z

The Chief of Station's objection to Track II did not go unnoticed.

The following instruction to the COS was sent on October 7: "Report
should not contain analysis and argumentation but simpiy report on
action taken." (Headquarters 612, 7 October) Very simply, Headquarters

wanted the Station to take orders quietly as was the Agency itself. 1

Three examples of the Chief of Station's reporting bear out his

claim to have dissented:

Bear in mind that parameter of action is exceed-
ingly narrow and available options are quite
limited and relatively simple.

It is essential that we not become victims of our

coup attempts. (Santiago 477, October 7, 1970, p.2)

HW 50955 DocId:32423525 Page 103


A. The Chilean Conspirators

Anti-Allende coup plotting in Chile centered around several key
individuals. One of these was retired General Roberto Viaux, the General
who had led the "Tacnazo" insurrection a year before." Following the
"Taenazo" revolt, and his dismissal from the Army, Viaux retained the

support of many non-commissioned and junior officers as well as. being

the recognized leader of several right-wing civilian groups. (CIA
Briefing Paper, "Special Mandate from the President on Chile,” July
15, 1975)

Another individual around which plotting centered was General Camilo

Valenzuela, Commander of the Santiago Garrison. General Valenzuela was Sk
in league with several other active duty officers, including
_
i
e
(CIA Report on Chilean Task Force Activities, November 18, a

1970) All of these officers, with the possible exception of

KE
were in contact with Viaux as well.

*This revolt was engineered by Viaux ostensibly for the purposes of drama~
tizing the military's demand for higher pay, but was widely interpreted as
an abortive coup. oe

**The record of meetings between Viaux, and the active duty military officers
is incomplete. Thé record does show, however, that Viaux met with
around October 7. (Chile Task Force Log, October 7). On October 12
Viaux met with General Valenzuela (Chile Task Force Log, 14 October). One

cable from Santiago indicates that may have been a member
of Viaux's inner circle of conspirators. (Station 545, 16 October 1970),
At the very least, as in contact with Viaux.

Although a distinction can be made between théesViaux and Valenzuela groups,
as CIA witnesses did throughout their testimony: before the Committee, the
ry principal distinction between the two was that the latter was led-by active duty
military officers. The two groups were in contact with each other. The
record also indicates that they worked together in at least two of the three
Schneider kidnap attempts.

2423525 Page 104


.

There was considerable communication among the various plotting

elements. As Thomas Karamessines testified:

..-T might add here that it seemed that a good
dozen or more, maybe 20 Chilean senior officers
were privy to what was going on in addition to
President Frei and they were all talking to one
another exchanging views and trying to ‘see how
best to mount the kind of coup that they wanted
a to see take place. (Karamessines testimony, p. 10)

B. Contacts Prior to October 15

The CIA's initial task in Chile was to assess the petential withia
the Chilean military to stage a coup. It recognized quickly that anti-
Allende currents did exist in the military and the Carabineres (police),
but were immobilized by "the tradition of military respect for the
Constitution” and "the public and private stance of General Schneider,
Commander in Chief of the Army, who advocated strict adherence to the

Constitution.”

{CIA Report on Chilean Task Force Activities, 18 Novem-
ber 1970, p. 17) The Agency's task, then, was to overcome “the apolitical,
constitutional-oriented inertia of the Chilean military." (Ibid, p. 2)
Since the very top of the Chilean military, embodied by General.
Schneider and his second-in-command, General Prat, were hostile to the
idea of a coup against Allende, discreet approaches were made to the
second level of general officers. They were to be informed that the U.S.
Government would support a coup both before and after it took place.*
(Headquarters to Station 611, 7 October 1970) This effort began in

earnest on October 5 when Colonel Wimert informed both an Army General

("Station's.priority contact") an an Air Force.Gengral of the pro-coup
P + Forge General, of the p
fogiia sf oa

ie
*The military officers were told, for example, that should Allende be

prevented from taking office, "The Chilean military will not be ostra- «
cized, but rather can continue to count on us for MAP support and main-
tenance of our close relationship." (Hqs. 075517, 7 October 1970)

ULSitpolicy. (Santiago 469, October 5; Santiago 473, October 6)*

Three days later the Chief of Station told|

of the Carabineros that “the U.S. Government favors a military selu~

tion and is willing’to support it in any manner short of outright —

military intervention." (Task Force Log, 9 October)

informed the COS that there was no chance of a coup by the Chilean
Army high command. (Task Force Log, 10 October)

On October 7, Colonel Wimert approached members of the War Academy

in Santiago who in turn asked him to provide light weapons. This was

Colonel Wimert's first contact with the Army Lt. Colonel to whom he
ae
would ultimately pass three submachine gunseon October 22. — At this

a

meeting, the Lt. Colonel told Colonel Wimert that he and his colleagues

were
—
trying to exert force on Frei to eliminate
Gen. Schneider to either replace him, send
him out of the country. They had even stud-
ied plans to kidnap him. Schneider is the ‘
main barrier to all plans for the military E
to take over the government to prevent an
Allende presidency. (Santiago 483, 8 October)
: —
*aceording to the CIA's wrap-up report on Track IL, between October 5
and October 20, the CIA Station and the Army Attache~-for the most part
the latter--made 21 contacts with key military and Carabinero officials. Coane
. (CIA Report on Chilean Task Force Activities, 8 November 1970) e

*“*In his testimony, Colonel Wimert indicated that the Lt. Colonel was
affiliated with General (Wimert testimony, p. 52) In a cable
sent to Headquarters on October 18, in which the Lt. Colonel's request
for three submachine guns was made, the Station indicated that Wimert
believed the Army officer, and his companion, a Navy Captain, were in
league with-Admiral| (Station 562, October 18) At another point
in his testimony, Wimert stated, "There was Valenzuela here and the Navy
Captain and the Army Lt. Colonel and the Air Forge General over here."
(Wimert testimony, p. 107) The Committee has been unable to determine
the exact affiliation of the Army Lt. Colonel. However, as previously
stated, both General a] miral were affiliated with « —
General Valenzuela and Admiral| was in contact with General Viaux.

WH 50955 Docld:32423525 Page 106


The next day, October 8, Headquarters cabled the Station in response
to the Wimert-Lt. Colonel meeting. Headquarters tock note of Schneider's

resistance to coup plans and stated:

...This would make it more important than _
ever to remove him and to bring this new
state of events...anything we or Station
can do to effect removal of Schneider? We .
aa know this rhetorical question, but wish
inspire thought on both ends on this matter.
(Hqs. 628, 8 October)

“During the first week of intensive efforts chances of success
looked unusually bleak. The Chile Task Force Log commented:

President Frei and the highest levels of the
armed forces unable to pull themselves together
to block Allende. The Chilean mflitary's tradi-~
tion of non~intervention, Frei's reluctance to
tarnish his historical image, General Schneider's
firm constitutional stand, and most importantly,
the lack of leadership within the government and
military are working against a military takeover.
(Task Force Log, 8 October)

The following day the Station made reference to the "rapid(ly) waning
B day P. y

chances for success." (Santiago 487, 9 October) This pessimism was not

dispelled by their simultaneous judgment: "Station has arrived at Viaux
solution by process of elimination." (Santiago 504, 10 October) Three ‘
days later the Task Force agreed: "We continue to focus our attention
. on General -Viaux who’ now appears to be the-only military leader willing

to block Allende." (Task Force Log, 13 October)

If Viaux was the CIA's only hope of staging a coup, things were bleak

indeed. His own colleagues, Generals' and Valenzuela described him

as "a Genef4l without an army.” (Santiago 495, 9 October) Yet in the

first two weeks of October he came to be regarded as: the’best hope for.

carrying out.the CIA's Track Li mandate. r aA

‘Colonel Wimert was instructed not to involve himself with

a Viaux because of the high risk involved (Santiago 461, 5 October), he

served initially as a contact to Viaux through an military

Attache. The reported on October 5 that Viaux wanted several —

hundred paralyzing gas grenades to launch a coup on October 9. (Santiago
476; 6.October) Headquarters turned down the request, concluding that

a "mini-coup at this juncture would be counterproductive" and Viaux
should postpone his plans, "while encouraging him in a suitable manner
to maintain his pasture so that he may join larger movement later if

it materializes.’ (Headquarters 585, 6 October)

The primary purpose of the "False Flag Base” was to contact Viaux,

and it very rapidly relieved Wimert and the Attache of that

task. Viaux velterated his demand for an air drop of weapons to the

"False Flagger," and again the response was the same: reject the demand
for arms, but encourage him to keep planning. In essence the Agency

was buying time with Viaux: "We wish to encourage Viaux to expand and

< refine his coup planning, Gain some influence over his actions."
(Headquarters 689, 10 Octeber) To achieve this latter purpose, Head-
quarters authorized passing $20,000 in cash and a promise of $250,000
in life insurance to. Viaux and his associates, as a demonstration of

U.S. support. (Headquarters 729, 13 October)

On October 13, Headquarters again indicated its concern over Schneider
by asking: "What is to keep Schneider from making statement -in early
hours which:will freeze those military leaders who might otherwise join

Viaux?" (Headquarters 729, 13 October) The Station's response later that

same day was "Viaux intends to kidnap Generals Schneider and Prats within

the next 48 hours in order to precipitate a coup."' (Santiago 527,

HW 50955 Docld:32423525 Page 108


tion "as part of a coup that included Valenzuela." (Station 529, 13 October)

“At about this time the Station began to receive encouragement from its

other contacts. On October 14, ten days before the Chilean Congress was
to vote, the Task Force Log concluded:

Now we are beginning to see signs of increasing
coup activity from other military quarters,

specifically Army General (name deleted),
Admiral the forces in Concepcion and . a
Valdivis and perhaps even Frei and Ossa. ‘
(Task Force Log, 14 October) we
C. October 15 Decision
To summarize, by October 15, General Viaux had advertised to his con-
tact a desire to proceed with a coup, had ifdicated he would deai with
ie
the Schneider obstacle by kidnapping him, had met at least once with Gen- a
erals and Valenzuela and had once postponed his coup plans.* _—
On October 15 Thomas Karamessines met Henry Kissinger and Alexander
Haig at the White House to discuss the situation in Chile. According
to the Agency's record of this meeting, Karamessines “provided a run-

down on Viaux, the meeting with and, in some detail,

the general situation in Chile from the coup-possibility viewpoint."
(Memorandum of Conversation/Kissinger, Karamessines, and Haig, 15 October
1970) A decision wa made at the meeting "to de-fuse the Viaux coup plot,
at least temporarily:"

* The. reason for Viaux postponing his coup plans was the subject of a cable ,
from Santiago to Headquarters:

We discount Viaux's statement that he had called off his coup at-
tempt because of False Flag Officer's impending visit. Other re=
porting indicated Viaux probably not able or intending move this
weekend. (Santiago 499, 10 October) . .

There is also reason to believe that General Valenzuela was instrumental
in persuading Viaux to postpone. According to the Chile, Task Force Logr

Station reported that on 12 October General Valenzuela met
with General Viaux and attempted to persuade him not to at-
tempt a coup." (Chile Task Force Log, 14 October)

“Ie'was decided by those present that the Agency
“must get a message to Viaux warning him against
any precipitate action. In essence the message
should state: "We have reviewed your plans and
based on your information and ours, we come to
the conclusion that your plans for a coup at
this time cannot succeed. Failing, they may re—
duce your capabilities in the future. Preserve
your assets. We will stay in touch. The time
will come when you with all your other friends
can do something. You will continue to have -
our support.” (15 October Memorandum of Conver~ .
sation, Kissinger, Karamessines, Haig)

The meeting concluded, according to the Agency's record, “on Dr.
Kissinger's note that the Agency should continue keeping the pressure
on every Allende weak spot in sight--now, after the 24th of October,

after 5 November, and into the future until such time as new marching

orders are given. Mr. Karamessines stated that the Agency would comply."*
The following day CIA Headquarters cabled the results of the White
House meeting to the Station in Santiago:

2. It is firm and continuing policy that Allende
be overthrown by a coup....We are to continue to
generate maximum pressure toward this end utiliz-—
ing every appropriate resource.

3. After the most careful consideration it was
. determined that a Viaux coup attempt carried out
by him alone with the forces now at his disposal
. would fail. Thus it would be counterproductive
to our Track Two ebjectives. It was decided that
CIA get a message: to Viaux warning him against
precipitate action. (Headquarters 802, 16 Octo-
ber)

The message was supplemented by orders to “continue to-encourage him
(Viaux) to amplify his planaing; encourage him to join forces with other
coup planners." (Headquarters 802, 16 October) The message concluded:

"There is great and continuing interest in the activities of

alenzuela et al and we wish them optimum good fortune." (Ibid.)

Secretary Kissinger's recollection of the October 15 meeting is not

. in accord with that of Mr. Karamessines or the cable (Headquarters 802)
that was sent the following day to the Station in Santiago. This mat-
ter will be discussed in Part V of this report.

Coup Planning and Attempts After October 15

The decision to "de~fuse"” General Viaux was passed to Viaux's

on October 17. The responded that it did not

matter because they had decided to proceed with the coup in any case.

(Santiago 533, 17 October) At the final meeting of the CIA "False

Flagger" and Viaux's| on October 18, the Agency was in-

formed that the coup would proceed on October 22, "and that the abduc—

tion of General Schneider is first link in chain of events to come."
(Santiago 568, 19 October) An “emergency channel" of communication

with Viaux was maintained. (Report on CIA Chilean Task Force Activities,
18 November 1970, ane 21) -

As previously stated, by mid-October things suddenly Looked brighter

*
for a coup being mounted by the high-level Chilean military contacts.

As a CIA overview statement in Track EI stated:

Coup possibilities afforded by the active
duty military group led by General Valenzuela
and Admiral had always seemed more
promising than the capabilities of the Viaux
group. These military officers had the abil-
ity and resources to act providing they de~
cided to move and organized themselves ac-
cordingly.
(CIA Briefing Paper, "Special Mandate from
the President on Chile," July 15, 1975, p. 5)

By mid-October those military officers appeared to be moving in
this direction.
Qn the evening of October 17, Colonel Wimert met with the Army Lt.

Colonel and the Navy Captain. They requested 8 to 10 tear gas grenades,

*Two coup plotters, Generals|__| and | made one last attempt to, |
persuade General Schneider to change his anti-coup position on October 15,
The Station reported that the meeting turned out! to be a "complete fLasgo.
Schneider refused to listen to General eloquent presentation of
Communist action in Chile...and adament in maintaining his non-involvement
stance." (Santiago 548, 16 October)

‘three “4S-caliber machine guns and 500 rounds of ammunition. The Navy

x
:\ Captain said he had three machine guns himself "but can be identified

by serial numbers as having been issued to him. Therefore unable to

use them." (Santiago 562, 18 October) Colonel Wimert and the Chief —
of Station have testified that the officers wanted the machine guns
for self-protection. The question, of course, is whether the arms were

. intended for use, or were used, in the kidnapping of General Schneider.

The fact that the weapons were provided the Lt. Colonel and the Navy

Captain and that Viaux associates were convicted of the Schneider killing
suggests that the guns were not involved.

The machine guns and ammunition were seat from Washington by diplo-—

matic pouch on the morning of October 19, although Headquarters was
puzzled about their purpose: "Will continue make effort provide them
but find our credulity stretched by Navy Captain leading his troops
with sterile guns. What is special purpose for these guns? We will

try send them whether you can provide explanation or not." (Headquarters

854, 18 October) ‘The first.installment was delivered to’ the Army Lt.
Colonel and the Navy Captain late in the evening of October 18 and con-

sisted of the six tear gas grenades intended originally. for Viaux:*

* As previously stated, after October 15 CIA efforts to promote a coup in
Chile focussed on the active duty military officers--Valenzuela, et. al.--
rather than Viaux. An example of this shift in focus was the decision to
provide the Army Lt. Colonel and the Army Captain the tear gas grenades
originally intended for Viaux. A cable from Santiago explained the purpose of
this action: “

“Station plans give six tear gas grenades to
Colonel Wimert for delivery to Armed Forces
officers (deletion) instead of having False oo
Flag Officer deliver them to Viaux group. . ‘
Our reasoning is that Wimert dealing with ~
active duty officers. Also False Flagger - . ”

" Forces officers be strengthened.
(Santiago 562, 18 October)

‘That same’ day, ‘General valenzuela informed Colonel Wimert that he,
General Huerta, Admiral Tirado and an Air Force General were prepared
to sponsor a coup. (CIA Report on Chilean Task Forcé Activities, 18
November 1970) Their plan was to begin with the kidnapping of General
Schneider on the following evening, October 19, at a military

dinner being given for Schneider,* after which Schneider would be flown
to Argentina, Frei would resign and leave Chile, admixal| ould
head the military junta, and dissolve Congress. With respect to the

kidnapping of Schneider, the cable reports:

General Viaux knowledgeable of above operation
but not directly involved. Ne has been sent to
Vina to stay with prominent physftian. Will be
seen in public places during 19 and 20 October

to demonstrate fact that above operation not his
doing. Will be allowed to return to Santiago at .
end of week. Military will not admit involve-
ment in Schneider's abduction which is to be
blamed on leftists. (Santiago 566, 19 October)

The kidnapping of the evening of October 19 failed because General Schneider

left in a private vehicle, rather‘than in his official.car, and. his police guard

failed to be withdrawn, but the Army Lt.Colonel assured Colonel Wimert that an-
- . other attempt would be made on October 20. (Santiago 582, 20 October)

Colonel Wimert was authorized to pay Valenzuela $50,000 "which was the price

agreed upon between the plotters and the unidentified team of abductors,"

* The "False Flag Officer” who.was in contact with Viaux at the time
the Valenzuela plan was given to Colonel Wimert apparently undetstood
that Viaux was involved in the October 19 attempt. He stated:

Q. Were you told any of the details of how
the (Viaux) kidnapping would be carried out?

Mr. Sarno. They indicated it was going to be
at some sort of a banquet which the General °
(Schneider) would be attending.

but Wimett\insisted that the kidnapping be completed before he paid the
money. (Task Force Log, 20 October) At the same time General Valenzuela

assured Colonel Wimert that the military was now prepared to move. (Task

Force Log, 20 October) The second abduction attempt on the 20th also

failed and the Task Force concluded
~ Since Valenzuela's group is apparently having
considerable difficulty executing even the first
step of its coup plan, the prospects for a coup
succeeding or even occurring before 24 October
now appears remote. (Task Force Log, 22 October)

E. The Killing of General Schneider

In the early morning hours of October 22 (2 am), Colonel Wimert
delivered the three submachine guns with ammunition to the Army Lt.

Colonel in an isolated section of Santiago.* &

*al though Colonel Wimert's testimony and the cable traffic do not
3 clearly establish the identity of the group to which the Lt. Colonel
. was affiliated (see page 31) two CIA statements on Track II tie the
weapons, and therefore the Lt. Colonel, to the. Valenzuela group:

..-Three sub-machine guns, together with six gas
cannisters and masks, were passed to the Valen-
zuela group at 2 am on 22 October. The reason
~why they still wanted the weapons was because

there were two days remaining before the Congress

a At about? am ‘that day the group that intended to kidnap General

Schneider met to discuss last-minute instructions. According to the
findings of the Chilean Military Court which investigated the Schneider
killing, neither the Army Lt. Colonel nor the Navy Captain were there.
Shortly after 8 am,General Schneider's car was intercepted, on his
way to work, by the abductorsand he was mortally wounded when he drew
his handgun in self-defense, The Military Court determined that hand
gus had been used to kill General Schneider, although it also found
that one unloaded machine gun was at the scene of the. killing.”

The first Station reports following the Schneider shooting said
"Military Mission sources claim General Schneider machine gunned on
way to work" (Santiago 587, 22 October) and "Assailants used grease
guns." (Santiago 589, 22 October) The submachine guns had previously
been described as "grease guns." Thus the initial reaction of the Station
was that Schneider had been shot with the same kind of weapons delivered
several hours earlier to the Army Lt. Colonel. Santiago then informed
Headquarters “Station has instructed Col. Wimert to hand over $50,000
if Gen. Valenzuela requests " (Santiago 592, 22 October), thus indicating

that the Station thought the kidnapping had been accomplished by Valen-

zuela's paid abductors. Later that day, the- Station cabled Headquarters: caw

* The Military Court determined that those who participated in the
shooting of General Schneider on October 22 were part of the Viaux-led
conspiracy: The. Court also found that this same group had participated
in the October 19 and 20 kidnap attempts.

in June 1972 General Viaux was convicted for complicity in the plot

culminating in. the death of General Schneider. He received a 20-year

prison sentence for being “author of the crime of kidnapping which re-

sulted in serious injury to the victim," and a five-year exile for con-

spiring to cause a military coup. Also. convicted on the latter charge

(Santiago 598, 22 October)

TP, Post October 22 Events
The shooting of General Schneider resulted immediately in a declara~
tion of martial law, the appointment of General Prats to succeed Schneider

as Commander in Chief, and the appointment of General Valenzuela as chief

Ee

of Santiago province. These measures, and others taken, caused the Chile
Task Force to make the following initial judgment:

With only 24 hours remaining before the Congressional
runoff, a coup climate exists in Chile....The attack
on General Schneider has produced developments which
clesely follow Valenzuela's plan....Consequently the .
plotters’ positions have been. enhanced.
(Chile Task Force Log, 22 October)

On October 23, Director Helms reviewed and discussed Track II:

It was agreed...that a maximum effort has been achieved, ‘
and that now only the Chileans themselves can manage a :
~-successful coup. The Chileans have been guided to a b
point where a military solution is at least open to _ F

“v. CLA/White House Communication During Track If

The testimony given to the Committee by Henry Kissinger and General

Haig conflicts with that given by CIA officials.

Kissinger and Haig testified that on October 15, 1970, the White —
House .stood downCIA efforts to promote a military coup d’etat in Chile.
Both testified that after that date they were neither informed of, nor
authorized, CIA Track II activities, including the kidnap plans of

General Schneider and the passage of weapons to, the military plotters.

By contrast, CIA officials testified that they operated before and
after October 15 with the knowledge and approval of the White House.
The conflict pertains directly to the period after October 15, but

it bears on the degree of communication between the White House and the

CIA in the earlier period as well. For instance, Henry Kissinger. testi-
fied that he was informed of no coup plan which began with the abduction
of General Schneider. He was aware of General Viaux's plan--which he

and Karamessines decided on October 15 to try to forestall--but did not

know that it was to begin with Schneider's abduction. !
CIA officials, especially Thomas Karamessines, stated that there was
close consultation throughout Track II between the Agency and the White
: House. Kevamessines testified that he mét with Kissinger some six to '
ten times during the five weeks of Track II (Karamessines testimony,
page 66); and that he kept Kissinger generally informed of developments.
(ibid., page 56) The Committee has records of two meetings between
Karamessines and Kissinger and of one telephone conversation between

Karamessines and Kissinger's deputy, General Alexander Haig. Karamessines!

daily calendar indicates that three other mectings with General Hai .
ON Pe

eres
took place--but does not establish with ne

Wed” Ba URED es



met on three other occasions and so might have had the cpportunity to

discuss Track II.

Henry Kissinger's testimony before the Committee differs
from Karamessines in two respects: He believed Track IL was "turned off"
on October 15; and,after that date,he was informed neither of the coup
plans of the Chilean conspirators nor of the passage of weapons to then.

He said that Track II was

in the nature of a probe and not in the nature of
a plan,...no plan for a coup was ever submitted to
the White House. So my recollection of events,
this was a request by President Nixon for Track II
which led to two or three meetings which then on
October 15th led to being turned off by the White
House, after which Track II was dead as far as my
office was concerned, and we never received another b
report on the subject. (Kissinger testimony, p. 15) ?

hk

In my mind Track II was finished on October 15th
and I never received any further CIA information
- Gy after October 15th on the basis of any records that +
~ I have been able to find. (Ibid., p. 59) . i

General Haig’s testimony generally coincided with Kissinger's

recollection:

- - T left (the October 15th meeting) with ‘the distinct k
impression that there was nothing that could be !
done in this covert area that offered promise or i
hope for success. I had the distinct impression .
that was Dr, Kissinger's conclusion, and that in
effect these things--and I wasn't even really
familiar with what these two groups were to do and
how they were to do it, but they were to cease and
desist. (Haig testimony, pp. 26-27)

RK

“My recollection would be that we had no hope for a.
viable, covert plan of action. That is the impres=
sion I-got. (Ibid., p. 29)

records, there was little discussion of a military coup. Rather the
conversation focused on "what economic leverage could be exercised in

the Chilean situation...." (Memorandum/Meeting with DDP, 18 September)

that Chile was on the agenda at this meeting. Karamessines' calendar —

his calendar. All that can be said about this meeting--and the meetings

of the Senior Review Group, which Kissinger also chaired--is that the
meetings afforded Karamessines and Kissinger an opportunity to meet
privately and discuss Track II if they desired. In all these instances
- save the 40 Committee meeting on September 22,-the Committee has no
evidence to confirm that such a private Kissinger/Karamessines meeting
actually took place. That the CIA prepared a memorandum of conversa-

CIA had ealled off a coup it regarded as premature. He stated:

My perception at that period was that if they
had a coup they would come...back to us before
triggering it...at no time during the period :
did they, in facet, tell us...that they had a - .
coup that might be ready to go. And, indeed,
they generally told us the opposite...

. (Kissinger testimony, pp. 25-26) :

As Karamessines’ calendar indicated, there was a 40 Committee meet~
ing on October 6. He attended this meeting, along with Richard Helms:

and William Broe of the CIA. According to the winutes.of that meeting,

CIA efforts to promote a military coup in Chile were not discussed.
However, in an exchange with Charles Meyer, who was then the State De-
partment's ‘Assistant Secretary for Latin. American Affairs, Dr. Kissinger
stressed the desire of “higher authority" (President Nixon) to prevent
Allende’s assumption of office. According to the minutes:

voy Mr. Meyer pointed to the need to determine a post-Allende

“ position such as proposed in NSSM 97. Tt was agreed that
a an early NSC meeting was desirable on that subject. Mr. :
Kissinger said this presumed total acceptance of a fait :

ing before the 24th; on the contrary, he wanted no stone
left unturned. (Memorandum for the Record/Minutes of the

contacts.

HW 50955 Docld:32423525 Page 122



It seems to me, although the records don't re-
flect it, that there was a meeting in September,
a very brief one, in which I must ‘have been
told that there was a specific program going
underway. That probably would have been by
Henry (Kissinger) and perhaps with Karamessines
there. I am not sure. (Haig testimony, p. 12)

Octobér 10
Karamessines discussed the Chilean situation by telephone with General

Haig. He indicated that the Station had “made direct contact with a number

of the senior military officers, especially those who had been reportedly
very activist-minded and had received pessimistic reactions from all."
(Memorandum/FUBELT, by William Broe, 10 October 1970)

Haig recalled the telephone conversation with Karamessines on the 10th.

His recollection accords with the CIA memorandum of conversation.

I do know, and I know that from looking at the

} record this morning, that Karamessines made a

telephone call to me in which he gave a progress '
report. I recall that. It was in effect a nega-

tive progress report, that they were’ just not com-

role at the time was one of a conduit to Kissinger:

Q. If Mr. Karamessines was unable to see Dr.

to him what had been given to me. (ibid., p. 15)

A cable to Santiago for Colonel Wimert, ostensibly from General
Bennett, authorized Wimert to select two Chilean general officers and

convey to them the following message

“High authority in Washington i

tion to Chilean Armed Forces in any endeavors they may undertake to

prevent the election of Allende on October 24...." (Headquarters to —

for no one else could have given Wimert such broad authorization.
Karamessines presumed that the message had been drafted in, or at :
least cleared with, the White House. (Karamessines testimony, p. 91) A

The 40 Committee met to discuss, among.cther topics, Chile. In ad-

ditiok to the 40 Committee principals (Kissinger, John Mitchell, David

Karamessines, William Broe and General Robert Cushman of the CIA, Charles
Meyer from State, Viron Vaky, and Ambassador Korry, who had returned to
Washington from Santiago for a short period ef consultation. ;

According to the minutes of that meeting, Kissinger asked Karamessines

to give a rundown on the latest devélopments and present situation in Chile.

Karamessines pointed out that "a coup climate does not presently exist."
He noted that "the unpredictable General Viaux is the only ‘individual. seen-
ingly ready to attempt a coup and...his chances of mounting a successful:
one werd slight.". Ambassador Korry agreed with Karamessines' assessment
and stated that "as of now it seemed almost certain that Allende would

be voted, into office on October 24th." "Kissinger then observed that
“there presently appeared to be little the U.S. can do to influence’ the
Chilean situation one way or another." Other-participants at the meet~.

ing concurred. (Memorandum for the Record/Minutes of the Meeting of the

Karamessines met with Kissinger and Haig at the White House to dis—

cuss Track II, According to the CIA memorandum of conversation, Karamessines

gave a run-down on Viaux, and and "the general situation in,

Chile from the coup-possibility viewpoint." It was concluded that’ Viaux
did not have more than one chance in twenty--perhaps less--to launch a

successful coup. Kissinger ticked off the list of negative repercussions

from an unsuccessful coup. The CIA record of the meeting continues:

5. Tt was decided by those present thatthe
Agency must.get.a message to Viaux warning him
against any precipitate action. In essence our
message was to state: "We have reviewed your
plans, and based on your information and ours,
we come to the conclusion that your plans for a
coup at this time cannot succeed. Failing,
they may reduce your capabilities for the future. .
+ Preserve your assets.. We will stay in touch. t
The time will come when’ you with all your other ' i
| friends can do something. “You will continue to
i have our support." :

6. After the decision to de-fuse the Viaux coup : ii
plot, at least temporarily, Dr. Kissinger instruc-— :
ted Mr. Karamessines te preserve Agency assets in

Chile, working clandestinely and securely to main-

Allende in the future.

8. The meeting concluded on Dr. Kissinger's note
- ‘that the Agency should continue keeping the pres-
. sure on every Allende weak spot in sight--now,
after the 24th of October, after 5 November, and
into the future until such time-as new marching
orders ‘are given. Mr.,Karamessines stated that
‘the Agency would comply.

memorandum of conversation as substantially correct, although somewhat

more detailed than he would have remembered. (Kissinger testimony, p. 52)

He believed the Agency had been told to “stand down and preserve your
assets.”
-Kissinger believed that the gist of the October 15th meeting as

recorded in the CIA memorandum was incompatible with the order the CIA

issued to its Station the next day, an order ostensibly based on the

October 15th meeting. And, he noted, in writing its memorandum of the
meeting of the 15th, the CIA had a "high incentive to preserve the maxi-
mum degree of authority.” (Ibid., pp. 55-54) The October léth order

indicated that Track II had been reviewed at "high USG level" the previous

day, and stated:

2. It is firm and continuing policy that Allende
be overthrown by a coup. Et would be much prefer-
able to have this transpire prior to 24 October
but efforts in this regard will continue vigorously
beyond this date....

4. There is great_and continuing interest in the

activities of Valenzuela et al

and we wish them optimum good fortune.
(Headquarters 802, 16 October 1970)

Kissinger recalled the October 15th conversation as “turning off :
the coup plans rather than giving a new order to do them.” (Kissinger
testimony, p. 56) Haig agreed in his testimony.

The conclusions of that meeting were that we had.
better not do anything rather than something that
pas not going to succeed....My general feeling
was, I left that meeting with the impression that
there was nothing authorized."

Karamessines and one or two others went with Kissinger to speak with

the President, after a larger meeting. Karamessines believed this meeting

took place between October 10 and 24, (Karamessines testimony, p. 89) —
According to Karamessines, the "President went out of his way to impress

all of those there with his conviction that it was absolutely essential

that the election of Mr. Allende to the presidency be thwarted."” As

they were leaving the Oval Office, the President took Karamessines aside

to reiterate the message. (Katamessines testimony, p. 8)
October 19

Station cabled Headquarters early in the morning, advising that

the tear gas had been passed and outlining the Valenzuela coup plan, : r
beginning with the kidnap of Schneider. In testimony before the Com _
mittee, Karamessines indicated he certainly would have reported the

; Valenzuela plan to Kissinger “very promptly, if for no other reason
than that we didn't have ali that much promising news to report to :
the White House...."  (Karamessines testimony, p. 72) b

And as I say, if for no other reason we would have
wanted to get this kind of hopeful report to the
White House as soon as possibile, and it would be my
_best estimate now that that is precisely what we

7 did. (p. 72)

In the afternoon of the 19th, Karamessines met with General Haig

for an hour at the White House. (Karamessines calendar) By then,

rT

Karamessines would have had in hand the cable outlining the Valenzueia

te the meeting with the President occurred after October 15, that
would lend credence to the testimony of CIA officials that they were
not directed to end their coup efforts in the October 15th meeting.
Unfortunately, the Committee has not had access to the daily calendars
of President Nixon or Secretary Kissinger, which might pinpoint the
date of the President's conversation with Karamessines. - Those calen-
t dars, along with other White House documents bearing on Track Il, have
been subpoenaed.

plan, since the cable had arrived that morning. However, General Haig
had no recollection of the meeting with Karamessines on the 19th. Nor

dfd he believe he had been informed of the Valenzvela-plan, "This

is all very new to me. I hadn't seen any of this, and I was not familiar
with this particular plan...or $50,000, or any of the characters that
aré described in here.” (Haig testimony, pp. 38-39)

Similarly, Kissinger testified that he had not been informed of

the Valenzuela plan. He said he "was informed of nothing after October

i5th...." (Kissinger testimony, p. 65) He indicated that, according
to his daily calendar, he had no conversation with either Karamessines
or Helms between the i5th and the 19th. (Ebid., p. 53) He indicated

that he never knew that the CIA was in the process of passing guns and

tear gas to Chilean military conspirators. He said "...there was no
further meeting on that subject. In anybody's record, mine or theirs
(the CIA's), none of the information from the 16th on was familiar to me."

(Ibid., p. 62)

Kissinger further testified he did not know that the United States 1
was dealing with Chilean officers who plotted a coup which involved
the abduction of General Schneider:

Senator Hart of Colorado. I-am-not sure that

the record clearly shows you answer to the direct
question of whether you knew or did net know that
we were negotiating with military officers with
regard to a plot that did involve the abduction
of General Schneider.

Secretary Kissinger. 1% said I did not know.

Nor did General Haig believe he had been informed of any abduction be
plans before the fact. F

Ror! the plans to kidnap General Schneider?

General Haig. I was aware after, the fact..

Q. But you were never informed prior to his .

. General Haig. I don't believe I was at all.

October 20

A cable to the Station indicated that “while awaiting word on whatever

ie
k

events may have occurred 19 October, please let us know what you can on
interim basis....Headquarters must respond during morning 20 October te
queries from high levels." (Headquarters 883, 20 October 1970) Karamessines
testified that the references to "high leveds" in the cable of the 20th
meant White House officials, probably Kissinger. He felt quite certain

that Kissinger would have been briefed in advance about Valenzuela's plan

for the 19th and so would have been expected to ask what happened on the
morning of the 20th. (Karamessines testimony, p. 73) In contrast, Kissinger

interpreted that cable in precisely the opposite light. He’ felt it indicated

that he had not been informed of the Valenzuela plan in advance. When
news of the Schneider kidnap reached the White House, Kissinger believed
he would have had “somebody pick up a telephone and say, ‘What is this
all about?'" (Kissifger transcript, p. 68)-
October 22

Kardmessines met with Haig at the White House. (Karamessines calendar) H
General Haig remembered that word of the shooting of Schneider came as i

“a great stock" to him, and he believed that Karamessines had told him

about it in their meeting on the 22nd. He thought that Kissinger either fs
was present at the meeting or that he, Haig, had gone immediately in to

Kissinger's office to relate what Karamessines’ Had" told him/, (Haig test:

Cc. December

December 2

A memorandum, dated December 2, 1970, from Helms to Kissinger stated

that Helms had given a recapitulation on Track’II to Attorney General

Mitchell, who would deliver it personally to Kissinger. A handwritten
note on the memorandum reads: “sent to Kissinger via DCI (Helms)."
(Helms memorandum for Kissinger, 2 December 1970) The report, which

was dated November 18, 1970, contained a full account of CIA activities ot

during Track Il, including the several plans to kidnap Schneider and
the passage of weapons te the Chilean conspirators. (Report on CIA
Chilean Task Force Activities, 15 September to 3 November 1970, 18

November 1970)

In his testimony to the Committee, Kissinger did net recall receiv-

ing the report, although he. doubted that he would have read such an
“after action" report in any case. He testified that he could not find
it in his files, in contrast to his finding a CIA report on Track I,

dated November 19, 1970. Kissinger was puzzled by a number of aspects of |

the memorandum and report: why there were two reports, why the report
of the 18th apparently was only called to his attention on the 2nd of
December, and why it was to be delivered through Mitchell. (Kissinger
- testimony, ‘pp. 71, 74) _ _
~D, Did Track IZ End?.

The Committee’ also received conflicting testimony about whether or

not Track II ever ended, formally cr in fact. As noted above, Kissinger indi-

. cated that “Track II was supposed to have ended, as far as he was concerned, on
October 15. It was formally terminated, according to Kissinger, by a new Presi-

dencial

Dy

‘the! Committee’ does not have this new "marching order" in its possession.

2

However, CIA officials from whom the Committee took testimony believed
that there had been no such definitive end to Track IT. It merely
tapered off, to be replaced by a longer-term effort to effect a change —

of government in Chile. Karamessines' testimony was most explicit:
Mr. Karamessines. TI am sure that the seeds that
were laid in that effort in 1970 had their impact
in 1973. i do not have any question about that
in my mind either. (Karamessines testimony, p. 26)
feck
Q. Was Track II ever formally ended? Was there
a specific order ending it?

Mr, Karamessines. As far as I was concerned,
Track II was really never ended. What we were
told to do in effect was, well, Allende is now
President. So Track II, which sought to prevent
him from becoming President, was technically out,
it was done. But what we were told to do was to
continue our efforts. Stay alert, and to do what —
we could to contribute to the eventual achieve-
ment of the objectives and purposes of Track IT.
That being the case, I don't think it is proper
te say that Track II was ended.

(ibid. ,- pp. 128-129)

When informed of Karamessines’ testimony that Track II was never
ended, Kissinger testified: ~

The Chairman. Would you take issue with that,
with the (Karamessines) testimony? _

Secretary Kissinger. Totally....It is clear
that...after October 15th that there was no
separate channel by the CIA to the White House
and that ali actions with respect to Chile were
taken in the 40 Committee framework. There was
no 40 Committee that authorized an approach to
“or contact with military people, no plots which
I am familiar with, and aii the covert operations
in Chile after Allende's election by the Congress
were directed towards maintaining the democratic
opposition for the 1976 election. And that was ne
the exclusive thrust, and if there was:any further's,
contact with military plotting, it wastotally”
unauthorized and this is the first that I have
f heard of it. (Kissinger testimony, pp. 75~77)

(Draft--9/8/75)

A. Summary

South Vietnamese President Ngo Dinh Diem and his brother,
Ngo Dinh Nhu, were assassinated during a coup by Vietnamese
generals on November 2, 1963. Evidence before the Committee
indicates that the United States Government offered encourage-
ment for the coup, but neither desired nor was involved in the
assassinations. Rather, Diem's assassination appears to have
been a spontaneous act by Vietnamese generals, engendered by
anger at Diem for refusing to resign or put himself in the
custody of the leaders of the coup.

On one occasion, General Duong Van Minh ("Big Minh") out-
lined to a CIA officer the possible assassination of Nhu and
another brother, Ngo Dinh Can, as one of three methods being
considered for changing the government in the near future.

6 Ambassador Henry Cabot Lodge and Deputy Chief of Mission William
Trueheart were informed of this possibility by the Saigon Chief
“of Station, who recommended that “we do not set ourselves
irrevocably against. the ‘assassination. plot, since the other two
alternatives mean either a bloodbath in Saigon or a protracted
struggle which would rip the Army- and the country asunder" (CIA
-cable SAIG 1447, Saigon Station to DCI, 10/5/63). Upon being
informed, Birector McCone sent two cables. The first stated
“[wle cannot be in the position of stimulating, approving, or
supporting assassination", and the second directed that the
recommendation be withdrawn because “we cannot be in position

M actively condoning such course of action and thereby engaging

HW 50955 Docld:32423525 Page 133


our responsibility therefor" (CIA cable, DCI to Saigon 10/5/63);
CIA cable DIR 73661, DCL to Saigon, 10/6/63).

B. The Abortive Coup of August 1963

On May $, 1963, South Vietnamese troops in the City of Hue
fired on Buddhists protesting against the Diem Government, killing
nine and wounding fourteen. This incident triggered a nationwide
Buddhist protest and.a sharp loss of popular confidence in the
Diem regime.”

On May 18, United States Ambassador Frederick B. Nolting
met with Piem and outlined steps.which the United States desired
him to take to redress the Buddhist grievances and recapture
public confidence. These steps included admitting responsibility

for the llue incident, compensating the victims, an@ reaffirming

religious equality in the country. (Pentagon Papers, p.208) On
June 3, Madame Nhu, the wife of Diem's brother, Whu, publicly
- . accused the Buddhists of being infiltrated with Communist agents;

Truenart protested her remarks to Diem and threatened to dis

associate the United States from any repressive measures against
the Buddhists in the future (Pentagon Papers, p.308).. Shortly

thereafter, Madame dhu commented on the self-immolation of Quang

ment Histoty of United States Decisionmaking on Vietnam, pp. 297-

Saigon, John Mecklin),in his book, Mission in Torment, An Intimate
Account of the U.S. Role in Vietnam, Doubleday and Company, ‘1965,
(hereinafter cited as Mecklin, at pages 158-606 described the“vul-
nerability of the Buddhists to Communist infiltration during this
period noting that ate “offered a classic opportunity for a Communist
sleeper ploy."

Duc and other Buddhist monks by stating that she would like to
furnish mustard for the monks' barbecue. On June 12, Trueheart
told Diem that Quang Duc's suicide had shocked the worid and
again warned that the United States would break with his govern-
ment if he did not solve the Buddhist problem. (Pentagon Papers,
p. 208.) ;

Lucien Conein, a CIA officer in Saigon,* testified that the
Buddhist uprisings were the catalyst that ultimately brought
down the Diem regime (Conein, pp. 42-44). These events led the
United States to apply "direct, relentless, and tablehammering
. pressure on Diem such as the United States has seldom before

attempted with a sovereign friendly government." (Mecklin, p. 169)

By July 4, 1963, Generals Minh, Don, Kim, and Khiem had

agreed on the necessity for a coup.**

In his final meeting on August 14 with Ambassador Nolting,
_Diem agreed to make a public statement offering concessions to

the Buddhists. This statement took the form of an interview

* Conein testified that he had known the Generals involved
in the coup .
“For many years, Some of them I had known back even in
World War Il. Some of them. were in powerful positions,
and I was able to talk to them on a person to person basis,
not as-a government official." (Conein, p. 17.)

Conein's After-Action Report stated that:

“The majority of the officers, including General Minh,
. desired President Diem to have honorable retirement from,
the political scene in South Vietnam and exile. As to

: Ngo-Dinh Nhu and.Ngo Dinh Can, there was never dissention.
AL The attitude was that their deaths, along with Madame Ngo
Dinh Nhu, would be welcomed." (Conein After-Action Report,

p. 10.)

with the columnisc, Margurite Higgins, in which Diem asserted
that his policy toward the Buddhists had always been conciliatory

and asked for harmony and support of the government.

Shortly after midnight on August, 21, 1963, Nhu ordered forces
loyal .to him to attack pagodas throughout Vietnam, arresting monks
and sacking the sacred buildings. Over thirty monks were injured
and 1,400 arrested. ‘The American Embassy was taken by surprise
and viewed the attacks as a shattering repudiation of Diem's

promises to wvolting. - (Pentagon Papers, p.21U)

On August 24, 1963, the State Department sent a cable
(Deptel 243) to the new ambassador in vietnam, Henry Cabot Lodge.
The teleyram was prepared by Roger ilsman, Assistant Secretary
of State for far Eastern Affairs, and Under Secretary of State
Averell Harriman, and was approved by President Xennedy. (Pentagon

Papers, p.235) Deptel 243 told Lodge to press Diem to take

“prompt dramatic actions" to redress the grievances of the
Buddhists.

"We must at same time also tell key military leaders

that US would find it impossible to continue support

GV (Vietnamese Government) militarily and economically
unless above steps are taken immediately which we
recognize requires removal of the Ahu's from the scene.
We wish give Diem reasonable opportunity to remove Nhu's
but if he remains obdurate, then we are prepared to accept
the obvious implication that we can no ‘longer support
Diem. You may also tell appropriate military commanders
we will give them direct support in any interim period

of breakdown central government mechanism... ..- Con-
currently with above, Ambassador and country teams should
urgently examine all possible alternative leadership and
make detailed plans as to how we might bring Diem's
yeplacement if this should become necessary . - - a

In a cable on August 25, CIA Chief of Station John Richardson
reported the result of a conference among himself, Lodge, True-
heart, General Harkins (Commander, Military Assistance Command ,
Vietnam (MACV) and General Weede (Chief of Staff, MACV). They
accepted Deptel 243 “as a basic decision from Washington and
would proceed to do their best to carry out instructions", (1.G.,
C, pp. 7-8) but believed that Diem would refuse to remove his
brother from his position in the government.

Early in the morning of August 26, 1963, the Voice of America
in South Vietnam placed the blame on Nhu for the August 21 raids
and absolved the army. The broadcast also reported speculation
that the United States contemplated suspending aid ‘to the South
Vietnamese Government (Pentagon Papers, p. 312) Later on that
same day, Lodge presented his credentials to Diem. CIA officers
Conein and Spera were told to see Generals Khiem and Khanh,

— respectively, and to convey to them the substance of Deptel 243,
but to remind them that “we cannot be of any help during initial
* action of assuming power of state. Entirely their own action,
win or lose" (SAIG 0304, 8/26/63).
A message from the White House on Augist 29 authorized
Harkins to confirm to the Vietnamese Generals that the United
States would support a coup if it had a good chance of succeeding,
but did not involve United States armed forces. Lodge was autho-
rized to suspend United States aid at his disctetion. (Deptel 272,

8/29/63.) A cable from the President to Lodge on the same day stated:

*®In a cabie to Harriman, Lodge complained that the VOA broad@ast
had “complicated our already difficult problem" by eliminating
“the possibility of the generals’ effort achieving surprise."
Lodge further warned that. "the US must not appear publicly in
the matter, thus giving the 'kiss of death' to its friends"
(Cable, Lodge to Harriman, 8/26/63).

“I have approved all the messages you are receiving from
others today, and I emphasize that everything in these
messages has my full support. We will do all that we can
to help you conclude this operations successfully ....
Until the very moment of the. go signal for the operation
by the Generals, I must reserve a contingent right to
change course and reverse previous instructions. While
_ fully aware of your assessment of the consequences of
such a reversal, I know from experience that failure is
more destructive than an appearance of indecision. TI
would, of course, accept full responsibility for any such
change as I must also bear the full responsibility for this
Operation and its consequences." (Cable, 8/29/63).

In a reply cable, Lodge stated:
“LT. 2 fully understand that you have the right and
responsibility to change course at any time. Of course
I will always respect that right.
2. To be successful, this operation must be essentially
a Vietnamese affair with a momentum of its own. Should
this happen you may not be able to control it, i-.e., the
“go signal" may be given by the generals." (Cable, Lodge
to President, 8/30/63)

A cable from Saigon dated August 31, 1963, stated:
"This particular coup is finished... . Generals did
not feel ready and did not have sufficient balance of
forces... . ‘Where is little doubt that GNV. (South

Vietnamese Government) aware US role and may have con-
. siderable detail... ." (SATG 0499, 8/31/63)

Deptel 243 and the VOA broadcast set the tone for later
relations between the United States representatives and the.

generals. Big Minh, who had initial doubts about the strength

of American support, grew in confidence.

Cc. The November 1963 -Coup

American ‘dissatisfaction with the Diem regime became
increasingly apparent. On September 8, AID Director David Bell,
in a television interview,. stated that Congress might cut aid

to South Vietnam if the Diem government did not change its course

Doeld:32423525 Page 136


-7-

(Pentagon Papers, p. 214). Lodge suggested a study to deter-
mine the most effective methods of cutting aid to topple the
regime (Pentagon Papers, p. 214). On September 12, with White
House approval, Senator Church introduced a resolution in the
Senate condemning the South Vietnamese Government for its
repressive handling of the Buddhist problem and calling for an
end to United States aid unless the oppressive measures were
curtailed (Pentagon Papers, pp. 214-215).

In mid-September 1963, two proposals for dealing with Diem
were considered by the Administration. The first contemplated
increasingly severe pressure to bring Diem in line with American
policy; the second involved acquiescing in Diem's-actions,
recognizing that Diem and Nhu were inseparable, and attempting
to salvage as much as possible. It was decided to adopt the

ca first proposal, and to send Secretary of Defense McNamara and
General Taylor on a fact-finding mission to Vietnam. (Pentagon

Papers, p. 215.) ¢

On October 2, McNamara and Taylor returned to Washington
and presented their findings to the National Security Council.
Their report confirmed that the military effort was progressing
favorably, but warned of: the dangers inherent in the political
turmoil and recommended bringing pressure against Diem. This
pressure would include announcing the withdrawal of 1,000
American troops by the end of the year; ending support for the
forces responsible for the pagoda raids, and continuing Lodge's

na policy of remaining aloof from the regime. The report recommended

RW 50955 DocId:32423525 Page 139


-8-

against a coup, but sugyested that alternative leadership should be
identified and cultivated. The recommendations were promptly *
approved by the President. (Pentagon Papers, pp.215-}16)

On October 3 Conein contacted Minh. Minh explained that a

coup was being planned, and requested assurances of American

support if it were successful. Minh outlined three courses of

action, one of which was the assassination of bien's brothers,

Nhu and Can (Conein, p.25; cable, Saigon to Director, 10/5/63)."
The Acting Chief of the CIA Station, David R. Smith, cabled on
October 5 that he had recommended to Lodge that “we do not set
ourselves irrevocably against the assassination plot, since the
ether two alternatives mean either a blood bath in Saigon or a
protracted struggie" (Cable, Saigon to Director, 10/5/63).

A cable from the Director, CIA to Saigon responded that:

“(w)e certainly cannot be in the position of stimulating,

approving, or supporting assassination, but on the other

hand, we are in no way responsible for stoppiny every

such threat of which we might receive even partial know-

ledge. We certainly would not favor assassination of Diem.

We believe engaging ourselves by taking position on this

matter opens door too easily for probes of our position

re others, re support of regime, et cetera. Consequently

believe best-approach is hands off. However, ,ye naturally
. interested in intelligence on any such plan."

* The other courses of action were the encirclement of Saigon
by various military” units and direct confrontation between military
units involved in the coup and loyalist units.

** Colby, who was then Chief, Far Eastern Division, drafted
this cable for McCone. Colby testified:

"Q: So you were on notice as of that date that the Director
personally opposed any involvement by the.CIA in an assas~-
sination?

~ "Colby: I certainly was." (Colby, p. 57)

HW 50955 Docld:32423525 Page 140


McCone testified that he met privately with the President and
the Attorney General, taking the position that "our role was
to assemble all information on intelligence as to what was
going on and to report it to the appropriate authorities, but
to not attempt to direct it" (MeCone, p. 62). He believed the
United States should maintain a “hands off attitude" (McCone,
p. 62). McCone testified:

"I fele that the President agreed with my position, des-
pite the fact that he had great reservations concerning
Diem and his conduct. I urged him to try to bring all
the pressure we could on Diem to change his ways, to
encourage more support throughout the country. My precise
words to the President, and I remember them very clearly,
was that Mr. President, if I was manager of a baseball
team, I had one pitcher, I'd keep him in the bex whether
he was a good pitcher or not... By that I was ‘saying that,
if Diem was removed we would have not one coup but we
would have a succession of coups and political disorder
in Vietnam and it might- last several years and indeed

it did." (McCone, pp. 62-63.)

+ MeCone stated that he did not discuss assassination with
the President, but rather "whether -we should let the coup go
‘or use our influences not to".. He left the meeting believing
that the President agreed with his “hands off" recommendation

(McCone, pp. 62-63). McCone cabled Smith on October 6:

“McCone directs that you withdraw recommendation to
ambassador (concerning assassination plan) under NeCone
instructions, as we cannot be in position actively con-
doning such course of action and thereby engaging our
responsibility therefore” (CIA to Saigon, DIR 73661, 10/6/63).

In response; the CIA Station in Saigon cabled headquarters:

"Action taken as directed. In addition, since DCM
“Prueheart was also present when original recommendation «
« was made, specific withdrawal of recommendation at McCone's
{ instruction was Also conveyed to Trueheart. Ambassador
. Lodge commented that he shares McCone's opinion." (Saigon
to CIA, SAIG 1463, 10/7/63) .

RW 50955 DocId:32423525 Page 141

Conein, the CTA official who dealt directly with the Generals,*
testified that he was first told of McCone's response to the
assassination alternative by Ambassador Lodge around October 20
(Conein, p. 35). ‘Conein testified (but did not so indicate in
his detailed After-Actio: Report) that he then told General Don
that the United States opposed assassination, and that the
General responded, “alright, you don't like it, we won't talk
about it anymore" (Conein, p. 36).

The United States increased pressure on Diem to mend his
ways. On October 17, General Richard Stillwell (MACV J-3)
informed Secretary Thuan that the United States was suspending
aid to the special forces units responsible for the pagoda
raids until they were transferred to the field and placed under
Joint General Staff (JGS) command (Pentagon Papers, p. 217).

On October 27, Lodge traveled to Dalat with Diem, but did
not receive any commitment from Diem to comply with American
; requests (Pentagon Papers, p. 219).

On October 28...Conein met with-General Don, who had

received assurance from Lodge that Conein spoke for the United

States. Don said that he would make the plans for the coup

* Conein described his role as follows:

"My job was to convey the orders from my Ambassador and
the instructions from my Ambassador to the people who
were planning the coup, to monitor those individuals who

available to the Ambassador four hours before it took place,
and suggested that Lodge not change his plans to go to the
United States on October 31. (1.6., C, p. 37; Pentagon Papers,
p. 219.)

~ On October 30, Lodge reported to Washington that he was
powerless to stop the coup, and that the matter was entirely
in Vietnamese hands. General-Harkins disagreed and cabled his
opposition to the coup to General Taylor (Pentagon Papers,
p. 220). A cable from Bundy to Lodge dated October 30 expressed
White House concern and stated that “[w]e cannot accept conclu-
sion that we have no power to delay or discourage a coup"
(Cable, Bundy to Lodge, 10/30/63). A subsequent cable on that
same day from Washington instructed Lodge to intercede with
the Generals to call off the coup if he did not believe it

would succeed. The instructions prescribed "strict noninvolve-

ment and somewhat less strict rieutrality". (Pentagon Papers,
p. 220.)

Late in the morning of November 1, the first units involved
in the coup began’to deploy around-Saigon, The Embassy was
given only four minutes' warning before the coup began (MACY
cable to Joint Chiefs of Staff 8512, 11/1/63).. An aide to
Don told Conein to bring all available money to the Joint
General Staff headquarters. Conein brought 3 million piasters
(Approximately $42,000) to the headquarters, which was given

to Don to procure food for his troops and to pay death benefits

to those killed in the coup (Conein, 6/20, p. 72).*

Conein was at the Joint General Staff Headquarters during
most of the coup (1.G., C, pp. 41-42). At 1:40 p.m., the
Generals proposed that Diem resign immediately, and guaranteed
him and Nhu safe departure (Conein After-Action Report, p. 15).
The palace was surrounded shortly afterwards, and at 4:30 p.m.
the Generals announced the ‘coup on the radio and demanded the
resignation of Diem and Nhu. Diem called Lodge and inquired
about the United States’ position. Lodge responded that the
United States did not yet have a view, and expressed concern
for Diem’s safety (Pentagon Papers, p. 221).

According to Conein’s report, Minh told Nhu that if he and
Diem did not resign within five minutes, the palace would be
bombed. Minh then phoned Diem, Diem refused to talk with him
and Minh ordered the bombing of the palace. Troops moved in
on the palace, but Diem still refused to capitulate. Minh
effered Diem a second chance to surrender half an hour later,
telling him that if he refused he would be "blasted off of the
earth''. Shortly before night fall ‘an air assault was launched
on the Presidential. Guard barracks. (Conein After-Action Report,
pp. 17-18.) :

At 6:20 on the morning of November 2, Diem called General

CIA had apparently considered passing money to the coup
leaders in early October (Colby, 6/20, p. 21). On October 29,
Lodge calbed that a request for funds should be anticipated~
(Lodge to State, No. 2040, 10/29/63; and 2063, 10/30/63).
Conein received the money on October 24, and kept it in a safe

Don at the Joint General Staff headquarters and offered to .
surrender if he and Nhu were given safe conduct to an airport.
Shortly afterwards, Diem offered to surrender unconditionally
and ordered the Presidential Guard to cease firing. According
to Conein, an escort for Diem appeared in front of the palace

at 8:00 a.m., but Diem and Nhu were not present (Conein After-
Action Report, p. 24).

At 10:30 a.m. the bodies of Diem and Nhu were reported to
be at the Joint General Chiefs' headquarters. Conein declined
to view the bodies because he feared that doing so might damage
United States interests (Conein, p. 57).

The details of Diem's and Nhu's deaths are not known.*

* Conein specualted that Diem and Nhu escaped through a tunnel
from the palace and.fled to a Catholic Church in Chalon. He
opined that an informant must have identified them and called the
General Staff Headquarters (Conein After-Action Report, p. 23).
Another CIA source states that Diem and Nhu had left the palace

“ the previous evening with a Chinese businessman and arrived at
the church at 8:00 on the morning. of November 2. Ten minutes
later.they were picked up by soldiers and forced into an army
vehicle (Cable, Saigon to State, No. 888). Minh originally told
Conein that Diem and Nhu had committed suicide, but Conein
doubted that Catholics would have taken their own lives in a
church (Conein, p. 56). The Inspector General's Report: states
that on November 16, 1963, a field-grade officer of unknown
reliability gave the CIA two photographs of the bodies of Diem
and Nhu in which it appeared their hands were tied behind their
backs (1.G., C, pp. 43-44). The source reported that Diem and
Nhu had been shot and stabbed while being conveyed to the Joint
General Staff headquarters.

None of the informed sources give any indication of direct or -

indirect involvement of the United States.*

* It must be noted that on October 30, 1963, Ambassador Lodge
notified Washington that there might be a request by ked leaders
for evacuation, and suggested Saipan as a point for evacuation
(Saigon Station Cable No. 2036, 10/30/63). Conein was charged
with obraining the airplane. Between 6:00 and 7:00 on the
morning of November 2, Minh afd Don asked Conein to procure an
aircraft. Conein relayed the request to David Smith, Acting
Chief of Station at the Embassy, who replied that it would not
be possible to get an aircraft for the next twenty-four hours,
since it would have to be flown from Guam. Conein testified
that Smith told him that Diem could be flown only to a country
that offered him asylum and that the plane could not land in
any other country. There were no aircraft immediately avail-
able that had sufficient range to reach a potential country
of asylum (Conein, p. 54). _

to possible reconsideration}

IV. Findings and Conclusions

In evaluating the evidence and arriving at findings and
conclusions, the Committee. has been guided by the following
standards. We believe these standards to be appropriate to
the constitutional duty of a Congressional committee.

1. The Committee is not a court. Its primary role is
net to determine individual guilt or innocence, but rather
to draw upon the éxperiences of the past to better propose
guidance for the future.

2. It is necessary to be cautious in reaching: conclusions
because of the amount of time that has passed since the events
reviewed in this report, the inability of three Presidents and
many other key figures to speak for themselves, the conflicting
and ambiguous nature of much of the evidence, and the problems
in assessing the weight to be given to particular documents
and testimony. :

3. The Committee has tried to be fair to the persons
involved in the events under examination while at the same

- time resporiding to a need to understafid the facts in sufficient
detail to lay a basis for informed recommendations.

With these standards in mind, the Committee has arrived at

the following findings and conclusicns.

RW 50955 DocId:32423525 Page 149.


A. Findings Concerning the Plots. Themselves

1. Officials of the United States Government: Initiated

Plots to Assassinate Fidel Castro and Patrice Lumumba

The Committee finds that officials of. the United States
Government initiated and participated in plots to assassinate
Patrice Lumumba and Fidel Castro.

The plot to kill Lumumba was conceived in-the latter half
of 1960 by officials of the United States Government, and ‘quick-
ly advanced to the point of sending poisons to the Congo to be
used for the assassination.

The effort to assassinate Castro began. in 1960 and continued
until 1965.. The plans to assassinate Castro using poison cigars,
exploding seashells, and a contaminated diving suit did not ,
advance beyond the laboratory phase. The plot involving under-

world figures reached the stage of producing poison pills,

establishing the contacts necessary to send them into Cuba,
procuring potential assassins within Cuba, and, according to one’
witness, delivering the pills to the island’ itself. .In the

1960 plot involving a Cuban pilot and in the AM/LASH episode
from 1963-1965, the CIA gave active support and encouragement ©
-to Cubans whose “intent to assassinate Castro was known, and
provided the means for carrying out the assassination.

ae

HW 50955 Docld:32423525 Page 150


2. No Foreign Leaders Were Killed As a Result of Assas-

sination Plots Initiated by Officials of the United

States

The poisons intended for use against’ Patrice Lumumba
were never administered to him, and there is no evidence that
the United States was in any way involved in Lumumba's death
at the hands of his Congolese enemies. The effort to assas-

sinate Castro failed.

3. American Officials Encouraged or Were Privy to

Coup Plots Which Resulted in the Death of Trujillo,

Diem, and Schneider

American’ officials clearly desired the overthrow of
Trujillo, offered both encouragement and guns to local dissi-
dents attempting his overthrow, and supplied them with pistols

and rifles,

American officials offered encouragement to the Vietnamese
- generals who plotted Diem's overthrow, and.a CIA official in

Vietnam gave the generals money after the coup had begun.
‘However, Diem's assassination was neither desired nor suggested
by officials of the United States.

The record reveals that the United States officials
offered encouragement to the Chilean dissidents who plotted
the kidnapping of General Rene Schneider, but did not desire
or encourage his death. Certain high officials did know that

the dissidents planned to kidnap General Schneider.

HW 50955 Docld:32423525 Page 151


~BA-

une

As Director Colby testified before the Committee, the death of

a foreign leader is a risk forseeable in any coup attempt. In
the cases we have considered, the risk of death was known in
varying degrees. It was widely known that the dissidents in

the Dominican Republic intended to assassinate Trujillo; the
contemplation of coup leaders to assassinate Nhu, President
Diem's brother, was communicated to the upper Levels of the
United States Government; while the CIA and perhaps the White
House knew that the coup leaders in Chile planned to kidnap
General Schneider, it was not anticipated that he would be killed,
although the possibility ‘of his death should have been recognized

as a.forseeable risk of his kidnapping.

4. The Plots Occurred in a Cold War Atmosphere Perceived

i” to be of Crisis Proportions

The Committee fully appreciates the importance of
evaluating the assassination plots in the historical context
within which they occurred. In the preface to this report, we
described the perception, generally shared within the United
States during the depths of the Cold War, that the country
faced a monolithic enemy in Communism. That, attitude helps
explain the assassination plots which we have reviewed,
although it. does not justify them. Those involved neverthe-
less appeared to believe they were advancing the best inter-

ests of their country.

RW 50955 DocId:32423525 Page 152


2. American Officials Had Exaggerated Notions About

Their Ability to Control the Actions of Coup Leaders

Running throughout the cases considered in this report
was. the expectation of American officials that they could
control the actions of dissident groups which they were support-
ing in foreign countries. Events demonstrated that the United
States had no such power. This point is graphically demonstrated
by cables exchanged shortly before the coup in Vietnam.
Ambassador Lodge cabled Washington on October 30, 1963, that he
was unable to halt a coup; a cable from Bundy in response stated
that “We cannot accept conclusion that we have no power to delay

or discoutage. a coup." The coup took place three days later.

Shortly after the experience of the Bay of Pigs, GIA
; headquarters. requested operatives in the Dominican Republic
: to tell the dissidents to "turn off" the assassination attempt,
because the United States was not prepared to "cope with the
aftermath." “The dissidents replied that- the assassination

7 was their. affair cand that it could-not be turned off to suit

the convenience of the United States Government.

HW 50955 Docld:32423525 Page 153


6. CIA Officials Made Use of Known Underworld Figures

in Assassination Efforts

Officials of the CIA made use of persons associated
with the criminal underworld in attempting to achieve the
assassination of Fidel Castro. These underworld figures were
relied upon because it was believed that they had expertise and
contacts that were not available to law-abiding citizens.

Foreign citizens with criminal backgrounds were also used
by the CIA in two other cases that we have reviewed. In the
development of the Executive Action capability, one foreign
national with a criminal. background was used to "spot" other
members of the European underworld who might be used by the CIA
for a variety of purposes, including assassination if the need
should arise. In the Lumumba case, two men with criminal back-

grounds were used as field operatives by CIA officers in a

volatile political situation in the Conge.

B. Conclusions Concerning the Plots Themselves

1. The United. States Should Not..Engage. in Assassination:

We cannot condone the use of assassination as a tool
of foreign policy. Aside from pragmatic arguments against the
use of assassination supplied to the Committee by witnesses with
extensive-.experience in covert operations, we find that assas-

sination violates moral precepts fundamental to our way of life.

HW 50955 DocId:32423525 Page 154


In addition to considerations, there were several
practical reasons advanced for net assassinating foreign
leaders. These reasons are discussed in the section of
this report recommending a statute making assassination
a crime.

a. Distinction Between Targeted Assassinations

Instigated by the United States and Support

for Dissidents Seeking to Overthrow Local

Governments

Two of the five principal cases investigated
by the Committee involved plots to kill foreign leaders
(Glumumba and Castro) that were instigated by American
officials. Three of the cases (Trujillo, Diem, Schneider)

a involved killings in the course of coup attempts by local

dissidents. These latter cases differed in the degree to
which assassination was contemplated by the leaders of the
coups and the degree to which United States officials

- motivated the coups. —_

The. Committee concludes that targeted assassinations

instigated by the United States must be prohibited.

HW 50955 Docld:32423525 Page 155


i -7-

Coups involve varying degrees of risk of assassination.
The possibility of assassination in coup attempts raises
questions concerning the propriety of United States involve-
ment in coups, particularly in those where the assassination
of.a foreign leader is a Likely prospect.
This country was created by violent revolt against a
regime believed to be tyrannous, and our founding fathers
(the local dissidents of that era) received aid from foreign
countries. Given that history, we should not today rule
out support for dissident groups seeking to overthrow tyrants.
But passing beyond that principle, there remain serious
questions: for example, whether the national interest of
the United States is genuinely involved; whether any such
support should be overt rather than covert; what tactics
~ should be used; and how such actions should be authorized
and controlled by the coordinate branches of government .
The Committee believes that its recommendation on. the question
of covert.actions-in support of coups must ‘await the Committee's
final report which will be issued after a full review of

covert action in general.

HW 50955 Docld:32493425 Page 156

b. The Setting In Which the Assassination Plots

Occurred Explains, But Does Not Justify Them

‘The Cold War setting in which che assassination
plots took place does not change our view that assassination
is unacceptable in our society. In addition to the moral and
practical problems discussed elsewhere, we find two principal
defects in any contention that the tenor of the period justifi-
ed the ‘assassination plots: :

First, the assassination plots were not necessitated by
imminent danger to the United States. Among the cases studied,
Castro alone posed a threat to the United States, but then
only during the period. of the Cuban missile crisis. Castro's
assassination had been planned by the CIA long before that
crisis, and was not advanced by policymakers as a possible
course of action during the crisis.

Second, we reject absolutely any notion that the United
States should justify its actions by the standards of totali-
taxians. Our standards must be higher, and this difference is

. what the struggle is all about. Of course, we must defend our
democracy. But in defending it, we must resist undermining
the very virtues we are defending.

WH 50955 Docld:32423525 Page 157


Two documents which have been supplied to the Committee
graphically demonstrate attitudes which can lead to
tactics that erode and couid ultimately destroy the very
ideals we must defend.

: The first was written in 1954 by a special committee form-
ed to advise the President on covert activities. . The United
States may, it said, have to adopt tactics "more ruthless than
[those] employed by the enemy" in order to meet the threat from
hostile nations. The report concluded that “long standing
American concepts of American fair play must be reconsidered. '"*

Although those proposals did not involve assassinations,
the attitudes underlying them were, as Director Colby testified,
indiéative of the setting within which the assassination plots

were conceived. (Colby, 6/4/75,-p. LL7)

* The full text of the passage is as follows:

another important requirement is an aggressive
covert psychological, political, and paramilitary
organization far more effective, more unique, and,
if necessary, more ruthless than that. employed by the
enemy. No one should be permitted to stand in the
way of the prompt, efficient, and secure accomplish-
ment of this mission. .

The second consideration, it is now clear that we
are facing an implacable enemy whose avowed objective
is world domination by whatever means at whatever
cost. There are no rules in such a game. Hitherto
acceptable norms of human conduct do not apply. If
the U. S. is to survive, long standing American con-
cepts of American fair play must be reconsidered.

HW 50955 Docld:32423525 Page 158


We do not think that traditional American notions of
fdir play need be abandoned when dedling with our adversaries.
It may well be ourselves that we injure most if we adopt

tactics “more ruthless than the enemy".

A second document which represents an attitude which we
. find improper was sent to the Congo in the fall of 1960 when
the assassination of Patrice Lumumba was being considered. The
chief of CIA's Africa Division recommended a_particular agent -- ~
WIROGUE -~- because

He is indeed aware of the precepts of right
and wrong, but if he is given an assignment
_which may be morally wrong in the eyes of the
- world, but necessary because his case officer
_ ordered him to carry it out, then it is right,
and he will dutifully undertake appropriate
action for its execution without pangs of con-
science. In a word, he can rationalize all
actions. (Memo dated / /60; Bissell Tr.,

6/11/75, p. )

The Committee finds this philosophy is not in keeping with the 4
ideals of our nation. . \

2. The United States Should Not Make Use of Underworld

Figures for Their Criminal Talents

We conclude that agencies of the United States must not
use underworld figures for their criminal talents* in carrying

out their operations. In addition. to the corrosive effect

‘*Pending our investigation of the use of informants by the FBI and
other agencies, we reserve judgment on the use of known criminals
as informants. We are concerned here only with the use of persons
known to be actively engaged in criminal pursuits for their
expertise in carrying out criminal acts.

HW 50955 Docld:32423525 Page 159 -


upon our government ,* the use of underworld figures involves
the following dangers:

, a. The use of underworld figures for "dirty business"
gives them the power to blackmail the government and to avoid
prosecution, for past or future crimes. For example, the
figures involved in the Castro assassination operation used
their ‘involvement with the CIA to avoid prosecution. The CIA ,
also contemplated attempting to quash criminal charges against
QJWIN in a foreign tribunal.

b. The use of persons experienced in criminal tech- "

niques and prone to criminal behavior increases the likelihood

that criminal acts will occur.. Agents in the field are neces-
sarily given broad discretion. But the risk of improper
activities is increased when persons of criminal background
are used, particularly when they are selected precisely to take

advantage of their criminal skills or contacts.

*The corrosive effect of dealing with underworld figures is
graphically demonstrated by the fact that Attorney General Robert
Kennedy, who had devoted much of his professional life to fight-
ing organized crime, did not issue an order against cooperating
with such persons when he learned in May 1961 that the CIA had.
made use of Sam Giancana in a sensitive operation in Cuba.

In May 1962, when the Attorney General learned that the
operation had involved assassination, he did, according to
a CIA witness, inform those briefing him that underworld
figures should not be used before checking with him first,
but failed to direct that they must never be so used.

HW 50955 Docld:32423525 Page 160


-~ 12 -

c. ‘There is the danger that the United States Govern-
ment will’ beconie an unwitting accomplice to criminal acts and
that criminal figures will take advantage. of their associa-
tion with the government to advance their own projects and
interests.

d. There is a fundamental impropriety in selecting
persons because they are skilled at performing deeds which the
laws of our society forbid. | ; _

The use of underworld figures by the United States Govern-

ment for their criminal skills raises moral problems comparable’

to those recognized by Justice Brandeis in a different context

five decades ago: . car

Our government is the potent, the omnipresent
teacher. For good or for ill, it teaches the
whole people by its example. Crime is con-
tagious. If the Government becomes a law-
breaker, it breeds contempt for law; it in-
vites every man to become a law unto himself.
To declare that in the administration of the
criminal law the end justifies the means --
to declare that the Government may commit
crimes in order to secure the conviction of
the private criminal -- would bring terrible
retribution. Against this pernicious doctrine
this Court should resolutely set its face.

Cw. Findings and Conclusions Relating to the Issues of Authori-

zation and Control

In the introduction to this report, we set forth in
summary form our major conclusions concerning whether the
assassination plots were authorized. The ensuing discussion

elaborates and explains those conclusions.

The Committee analyzed the question of authorization for

the assassination activities from two perspectives. First,

the Committee examined whether officials in policymaking . oe

positions authorized or were aware of the assassination

activities. Second, the Committee inquired whether the et
officials responsible for the operational details of the

plots perceived that assassination had the approval of

their superiors, or at least was the type of activity that

their superiors would not disapprove.

“No doubt, the CIA's general efforts against the regimes
discussed in this report were authorized at the highest

levels of the government. . But the record leaves serious

WW 50955 DocTd:32423525 Page 162°


-14-

doubt conterning whether assassination was authorized by
the Administrations. Even if the plots were not expressly
authorized, it does not follow that the Agency personnel
believed they were acting improperly. : ~

‘1. The Command and Control System for Assassina-

’ tions Was Such That the Plots Could Have

Been Undertaken Without Express Authorization .
As emphasized throughout this report, we are
unable to draw firm conclusions concerning responsibility

for the assassination plots. Even after our long investiga~-

tion, it is unclear whether the conflicting and inconclusive -
state of the evidence is due to the system of plausible
denial and its attendant doctrines, or whether there were.
in fact serious shortcomings in the system of authorization
which made it possible for assassination efforts to have
been undertaken by agencies of the United States Government
without express authority from officials outside of those
agencies.

‘Our preeminent finding is that assassination could have
been undertaken by an agency of the United States Government

without it having been uncontrovertibly clear that there was

RW 50955 DocId:32423525 Paye 163


~15-

explicit authorization from the highest level. The command
and control system revealed by the record made it possible for
the CIA to have engaged in assassination activities without
express authorization by officials outside the Agency.

The ambiguity and imprecision in the record illustrates
the dangers of a “plausible denial" system in which the precise
level of authorization may be difficult to ascertain. While
there is no evidence that -the "plausible denial" system has
succeeded in shielding decision makers in the cases. considered
in this report, the possibility that a’ system exists which

might permit those.responsible. for authorizing major operations

to escape responsibility is disturbing. Responsible government
requires that public officials be held accountable for their
“decisions.

2. Findings Relating to the Level at Which the Plots Were

Authorized
a. Diem
We find that neither the President nor any other
official in the United States Government authorized the assas-
sination of Diem and his brother Nhu. Both the DCI and top
State Department officials did know, however, that the death
of Nhu at least at one point had been contemplated by the coup

leaders. To the contrary, when the possibility that the coup

leaders were considering assassination was brought to the

HW 50955 DocId:32423525 Page i164.


-16-

attention of the DCL, he directed that the United States
would have no part in such activity, and this information
was relayed to the coup leaders.
b. Schneider
We find that neither the President nor any other
official in the United States Government authorized the assas-
sination of General Rene Schneider. The CIA, and perhaps the
White House, did know that coup leaders contemplated kidnap-
ping, which, as it turned out, resulted in Schneider's death.
ve. Trujillo
The Presidents and other senior officials in
- the Eisenhower and Kennedy Administrations sought the overthrow
of Trujillo and approved general actions to obtain ‘that end.
The DCI and the Assistant Secretary of State for Inter-.
American Affairs knew that the Dominican dissidents intended

to assassinate Trujillo, but the date at which the dissidents’

intent to assassinate was communicated to higher levels of

the government xesponsible for formulating policy is less
“clear. The record does establish that in the Spring of 1961

senior American officials, including the President, learned

that the dissidents intended to assassinate Trujillo. and that

they desired machine guns for that purpose. The Special Group

disapproved passage of those weapons’ and the President himself,

in a telegram, reaffirmed that decision, indicating that the

United States "as [a] matter of general policy cannot condone
assassination", although he did state that if the coup succeeded,
the United States would support the plotters.
d. Lumumba ,

The chain of events revealed by the documents and
testimony is strong enough to permit a reasonable inference
that the assassination plot was authorized by the President.

It is absolutely clear that Allen Dulles authorized the plot.
The juxtaposition of discussions concerning "disposing of"
Lumumba and taking "straightforward action" against him at NSC
and Special. Group meetings with Dulles' cable to the Congo,
Bissell's representation to Gottlieb about "highest authority",
and the delivery of poison to the Congo can be read to support
an inference that the President and the Special Group urged
w- the assassination of Lumumba.

Station and Gottlieb were under the impressiori that there was
Presidential authorization for the assassination ef Lumumba

is not in itself direct evidence of such authorization because

this impression was derived solely from Gottlieb's meetings
with Bissell and Tweedy. Neither Gottlieb nor the Chief of
Station had first-hand knowledge of Allen Dulles’ statements
about Presidential authorization. Richard Bissell assumed
that such authorization had been conveyed to him by Dulles,
but Bissell had no specific recollection of any event when
this occurred.

The evidence leads us to conclude that DDP Bissell and
DCI Dulles knew about and authorized the plot to assassinate
Lumumba. However, we are unable to make a finding that
President Eisenhower intentionally authorized an assassination
effort against Lumumba because of the lack of absolute certainty

in the evidence.

e. Castro

am ‘There was no evidence from which the Committee
could conclude that Presidents Eisenhower, Kennedy, or Johnson,
their close advisors, or the Special Group authorized the
assassination of Castro.

We find that the effort against Castro was clearly autho-
rized through the level of DDP. It is not certain whether
Allen Dulles knew about the plots, although Bissell and
Edwards were of the opinion that he did, and the credibility
of their beliefs is buttressed by the fact that Dulles knew
about the Lumumba assassination plot, which was planned and
attempted at the time of the early Castro plots. We can find
no evidence that McCone was aware of the plots which occurred
during his tenure. His DDP, Richard Helms, testified- that

“he never discussed the subject with McCone and was never

expressly authorized by anyone to assassinate Castro.

The only suggestion of express Presidential authorization
for the plots against Castro was Richard Bissell's opinion
that Dulles would have circumlocutiously informed Presidents
Eisenhower: and Kennedy after the assassination had been plan-

. ned and was underway. The assumptions underlying this opinion

are too attenuated for the Committee to adopt it as a finding.

First, it assumes that Dulles himself knew of the plots, a
matter which is not certain. Second, it assumes that Dulles
went privately to the two Presidents--a course of action
which Helms, who had far more covert action experience than
Bissell, testified was precisely what the doctrine of
plausible denial forbade CIA officials from doing. Third,
ic necessarily assumes that the Presidents would understand
from a "circumlocutious” description that assassination was
being discussed.

The chain of assumptions is far too speculative for the
Committee to make findings inplicating Presidents who are not
able to speak for themselves. Moreover, it is inconsistent
with Bissell's other testimony that "formal and explicit”
approval would be required for assassination,* and contrary

a to the testimony of all the Presidential advisors, the men

élosest to both Eisenhower and Kennedy.

* If the evidence ‘concerning President Eisenhower's order
to assassinate Lumumba is, correct, it should be weighed against
Bissell's testimony concerning circuulocutious briefings of the
Presidents in the Castro case. First, the Lumumba case would
imply that President-Eisenhower and Dulles did discuss such
matters. bluntly and not circumlocutiously. Second, the Lumumba
example indicates that the President would discuss such matters
openly in an appropriate forum, and would not need to be
approached.privately. Third, it can be inferred from Bissell's
testimony in the Castro case that if President Eisenhower had
teld Dulles that he approved of the plot, Dulles would not have
told anyone else of_that t.. Yet Gottlieb's testimony in the
Lumumba case states that he had been told of Presidential autho- °
rization for assassination by Bissell; who in turn assumed he
was told by Dulles. .

Helms and McCone testified that the Presidents under
which they served never asked them to consider assassination.
There was no evidence whatsoever that President Johnson

Presidency.

3. CIA Officials Involved in the Assassination Opera-

tions Perceived Assassination To Have Been A Permis-

sible Course of Action

The CIA officials involved in the targeted assassination
attempts testified that’ they had believed that their activities
had been fully authorized.*

: In the case of the Lumumba assassination operation,

Richard Bissell testified that he had no direct recollection

of authorization, but after having reviewed the cables and
Special Group minutes, testified that authority must have
flowed £rom Dulles through him to the subordinate levels in
the Agency.

In the case of the assassination effort against Castro,
Bissell and Sheffield Edwards testified they believed the
operation involving underworld figures had been authorized
by Dulles when they briefed him shortly after the plot had been

initiated. William Harvey testified he believed that the

* The lower level operatives, such as O'Connell and the ~
AM/LASH case officers, are not discussed in this section, since
they had clear orders from their immediate superiors. .

-21-°

plots "were completely authorized at every appropriate level
within and beyond the Agency", although he had "no personal
knowledge whatever of the individuals’ identities, times,
exact words, or channels through which such authority may
have passed”. Harvey stated that he had been told by Richard
Bissell that the effort against Castro had been authorized
“from the highest level", and that Harvey had discussed the
plots with Richard Helms, his immediate superior. Helms
testified that although he had never discussed assassination
with his superiors, he believed:

" that in these actions we were taking against

Cuba and against Fidel Castro's government in Cuba,

.that they were what we had been asked to do. . . . In
other words we had been asked to. get rid of Castro.
and . . . there ‘were no limitations put on the means,

and we felt we were acting well within the guidelines
that we understood to be in play at this particular
time. .

The evidence points to a disturbing situation. Agency
officials perceived the effort to assassinate Castro to have
been within the parameters of permissible action, but Adminis-

. tration officials “Cincluding McCone) “responsible for formulat-
ing policy were not aware.of the effort and did not authorize
it. The explanation may lie in the fact that orders concerning
overthrowing the Castro regime were stated in broad terms that
were subject to differing interpretations by those responsible
for carrying out those orders

The various Presidents and their senior advisors

HW 50955 Docld:32423525 Page 171


~22-

strongly opposed the regimes of Castro and Trujillo, the
accession to power of Allende, and the potential influence

of Patrice Lumumba. Orders concerning action against those
foreign leaders were given in vigorous language. For example,
President Nixon's orders to prevent Allende from assuming
power left Helms feeling that "if I ever carried a marshali's
baton in my knapsack out of the oval office, it was that day."
Similarly, General Lansdale described the Mongoose effort
against Cuba as "a combat situation", and Attorney General
Kennedy emphasized that "a solution to the Cuban problem
today carries top priority". Helms testified that the
pressure to "get rid of |Castro and the Castro regime]" was
intense, and Bissell testified that he had been ‘ordered to
“get off your ass about Cuba".

It is possible that there was a failure of communica-
tion. between policymakers and the agency personnel who were
experienced in ‘secret, and often violent, action. Although
policymakers testified that assassination was not intended
by such words as “get vid of Castro", some of their sub-
ordinates in the Agency testified that they perceived that
assassination was desired and that they should proceed with-
out troubling their superiors.

The 1967 Inspector General's Report on assassinations

appropriately observed:

HW 50955 DocId:324293525 Page 172


~23-

The point is that of frequent resort to synechdoche --
the mention of a part when the whole is to be under-
stood, or vice versa. Thus, we encounter repeated
references to phrases such as "disposing of Castro",
which may be read in the narrow, literal sense of assas--
‘sinating him, when it is intended that. it be read in
the broader, figurative sense of dislodging the Castro
“xvegime. Reversing the coin, we find people speaking
vaguely of “doing something about Castro” when it is
clear that what they have specifically in mind is
killing him. In a situation wherein those speaking
may not have actually meant what they seemed to say or
may not have said what they actually meant, they should
“not be surprised if their oral shorthand is interpreted
differently than was intended.

Differing perceptions between superiors and their sub-
ordinates were graphically illustrated in the’ Castro context, *
MeCone, in a memorandum dated April 14, 1967, reflected as
follows:

Through the years the Cuban problem was discussed in

. terms such as "dispose of Castro", "remove Castro",
rd “knock off Castro", ete., and this meant the overthrow
of the Communist government in Cuba and the replacing
of it with a democratic regime. Terms-such as the
above appear in many working papers, memoranda for the
record, etc., and, as. stated, all. refer to a change in
the Cuban government.

* "Senator Mathias: Let me draw an. example from history.
When Thomas A'Béckett was proving to be an annoyance, as
Castro, the King said, ‘who will rid me of this turbulent

_ priest?'. He didn’t say, ‘go out and murder him’. He said,
‘who’ will rid me of this man', and let it go at that.

t
‘Mr. Helms: That is a warming refererice to the problem.

"Senator Mathias: You feel that spans the generations
and the centuries? .

"Mr. Helms: JI think it'does, sir.

“Senator Mathias: And. that is typical of the kind of .
thing which might be said, which might be taken by the

~24-

: Helms, who had considerable experience as a covert operator,
gave precisely the opposite meaning to the same words, interpret-
ing them as conveying authority for assassination.

Helms repeatedly testified that he felt that explicit
authorization was unnecessary for the assassination of
Castro in the early 1960's, but he said he did not construe
the intense pressure from President Nixon in 1970 as pro-
viding authority to assassinate anyone. As Helms testified,
the difference was not that the pressure to prevent Allende
from assuming office was any less than the pressure to remove
the Castro regime, but rather that "I had already made up ny
mind that we weren't going to have any of that business when

i was Director.”

Certain CIA contemporaries of Helms who were subjected
to similar pressures in the Castro case rejected the thesis
that implicit authority to assassinate Castro derived from
“the strong language of the policymakers. Bissell testified
that he had believed that "formal and explicit approval”

would be required for assassination, and McManus testified

director or by anybody else as presidential authorization to
go forward?

"Mr. Helms: That is right. But in answer to that, I
realize that one sort of grows up in.tradition of the time
and I think that any of us would have found it very difficult
to discuss assassinations with a President of the U.S. I
just think we all had the feeling that we were hired out to «
keep those things out of the oval office.

NW 50955 Docid:32423525 Page 174


-25-

that "it never occurred to me" that the vigorous words of
the Attorney General could be taken as authorizing
assassination. The differing perceptions may have resulted
from their different backgrounds and training. Neither
Bissell (an academician wnose Agency career for the six years
before he became DDP had been in the field of technology) nor
McManus (who had concentrated on intelligence and staff work)
were experienced in covert operations.*

The perception of certain Agency officials that assas-
sination was within the range of permissible activity was

reinforced by the continuing approval of violent covert actions

against Cuba that were sanctioned at the Presidential level
and by the failure of the successive administrations to make
clear that assassination was not permissible. This point is

.~ one of the subjects considered in the next section.

* Of course, this analysis cannet be carried too far. In
the Lumumba case, for example,- Johnson and Dillon, who were
Administration officials with no covert operation experience,
construed remarks as urging or permitting assassination, while
other persons who were not in the Agency did not so interpret
them. ”

4. The Failure In Communication Between Agency Officials

In Charge Of The Assassination Operations And Their Superiors

In _ The Agency And In The Administration Was Due To:

(a) The Failure of Subordinates To Disclose The

Operations To Their Superiors; and

(b) The Failure of Superiors to Give Frecise Orders

Regarding the Nature of Permissable Operations and to Make

Clear That Assassination Was Precluded in the Climate of

Violence Engendered by the Aggressive Covert Actions

Sanctioned by the Administrations.

While we cannot find that officials responsible for
making policy decisions knew about or authorized the assassina-
‘tion attempts (with the possible exception of the Lumumba case),
Agency operatives at- least through the level of “DDP neverthe-
“~ less perceived assassination to have been permissible: This
failure in communication was inexcusable in light of the gravity

Agency officials to inform their superiors was reprehensible,
and that the reasons that they offered for having neglected
to inform their superiors are unacceptable. The Committee
further finds that Administration officials failed to be
sufficiently precise in their directions to the Agency and
that their attitude toward the possibility of assassination

was ambiguous in the context of the violence of other activities

that they did authorize.

- (a) Agency Officials Failed On Several Occasions To Reveal

The Plots To Their Superiors, Or To Do So With Sufficient

Detail and Clarity

_Several of the cases considered in this report raise
questions concerning whether officials of the CIA sufficiently
informed their superiors in the Agency or officials outside the
Agency about their activities.

Castro

The failure of Agency officials to inform their superiors
of the assassination efforts against Castro is particularly
troubling.

Richard Bissell testified that he and Sheffield Edwards
told Allen Dulles only "circumlocutiously" and only after

_ the project had begun about the operation which used members

of the underworld. Both Bissell and his successor as DDP,
Richard Helms, testified that they never discussed the opera-
‘tion with John McCone or any officials outside the CIA. The
two officials directly responsible for the operation--Edwards
and William Harvey--testified that they never discussed the
operation with McCone or any Government official above. the
level of DDP. McCone testified that he was never consulted about
the operation, and that Dulles never briefed him on its
; existence. On the basis of the testimony and documentary

evidence before the Committee, it is uncertain whether Dulles

to

RW 50955 DocId:32423525 Page 177


-28-

was ever made aware of the true nature of ‘the underworld
operation, and virtually certain that it continued into
McCone's term without his or the Administration's knowledge
or approval. ;

“on the occasions when Richard Bissell had the opportunity
to inform his superiors about the assassination effort against.
Castro, he either failed to inform them or misled them.

Bissell testified that he and Edwards told Dulles and
Cabell about the assassination operation using underworld
figures, but that they did so "circumlocutiously", and then
only after contact had been made with the ‘underworld and 4

price had been offered for Castro's death.

Bissell further testified that he never raised the issue
of assassination with officials of either the Eisenhower or
Kennedy Administration. His reason was that since he was under
Dulles in the chain of command, he would normally have had no
duty cto discuss the matter with the Presidents or other Adminis-
tration officials, and that he assumed that Dulles would have
circumlocutiously spoken with Presidents Eisenhower and Kennedy
.about the operation. These reasons are insufficient. It was
inexcusable to withhold such information from those responsible
for formulating policy on the unverified assumption that they

might have been circumlocutiously informed by Dulles, who

HW 50955 Docld:32423525 Page 178


ee,

-29-

himself had not been straight-forwardly told about the operation.*
The failure to either inform those officials or to make -

certain that they had been informed by Dulles was particularly

reprehensible in light of the fact that there were many occasions

on which Bissell should have informed them, and his failure to

do so was misleading. In the first weeks of the Kennedy Adminis-

tration, Bissell met with Bundy and discussed the development

of an assassination capability within CIA--executive action.

But Bissell did not mention that an. actual assassination attempt

was underway. Bissell appeared before the Taylor-Kennedy Board

of Inquiry which was formed to report to the President on the :

Bay of Pigs and the Cuban situation, but testified that he did

‘not inform the Commission of the assassination operation. As

chief of the CIA directorate concerned with clandestine operations

and the Bay of Pigs, Bissell frequently met with officials in

the Eisenhower and Kennedy Administrations to discuss Cuban

operations, and his advice was frequently sought. He did not
tell them that the~CIA had undertaken-an effort to assassinate

Castto, and did not ask if they favored proceeding with the

* Even assuming that Bissell correctly perceived that Dulles
understood the nature of the operation, it was inexcusable for
Bissell not» to have. briefed Dulles in plain language. Further,
even if one accepts Bissell’s assumption that Dulles told the
Presidents, they would have been told too late, because Bissell
"guessed" they would have been told that the operation “had
been planned and was being attempted".

HW 50955 Doold:32423525 Page 179


~30-

effort. He was present at the meeting with Dulles and Presi-
dent Kennedy at which the new President was briefed on covert
action in Cuba, but neither Dulles nor Bissell mentioned the
assassination operation that was underway.

The failures to make forthright disclosures to policy-
makers continued during the time that Richard Helms was DUP,
Helms ‘+ failure to inform McCone about the underworld operation
when it was reactivated under Harvey and poison pills were
sent to Cuba was a grave error in judgment, and Helms' excuses
are unpersuasive. In May of 1962, the Attorney General was
told that the CIA's involvement in an assassination plot had
terminated with the Bay of Pigs. Not only did Edwards, who
had briefed the Attorney General, know that the operation had
not been terminated, but Helms did not inform the Attorney
General that the operation was still active when he learned
that the Attorney General had been’ misled. Helms did not
inform McCone of the plot until August 1962, and did so then
in @ manner which indicated that the plot had been terminated
before MeCone became Director. -Helms' denial that AM/LASH
had been involved in an assassination attempt in response to
Secretary of State Rusk's. inquiries was, as Helms testified,
“not truthful". ,

When Helms briefed President Johnson on the Castro plots,
he apparently described the activities that had occurred during

prior administrations but did not describe the AM/LASH ‘opera-

H¥ 50955 DocId:32423525 Page 180


-31-

tion which had continued until 1965. Helms also failed to
inform the Warren Commission of the plots because the precise
question was not asked.

Helms told the Committee that he had never raised the
assassination operation with McCone or Kennedy Administration
officials because he had assumed that the project had been
previously authorized, and that the aggressive character of
the Kennedy Administration's program against the Castro regime
made assassination permissible even in the absence of an
express instruction. He added that he had never been convinced
that che operation would succeed, and that he would have told
MeCone about it if he had ever believed that it would "go
anyplace".

Helms’ reasons for not having told his superiors about

=~ the assassination effort are unacceptable; indeed, ‘many of: them

were reasons why he should have sought express authority.
As Helms himself testified, assassination was of a high order
of sensitivity. Administration policymakers, supported by
intelligence estimates furnished by ‘the Agency, had emphasized
on several occasions that successors to Castro might be worse
than Castro himself. In addition, the Special Group Augmented
required that plans for covert actions against Cuba be sub-
mitted in detail for its approval. Although the Administration

was exerting intense pressure on the CIA te do something about

‘Castro and the Castro regime, it was a serious error to have ~

HW 50955 Docld:32423525 Page 181


~32-

undertaken so drastic an operation without obtaining full and
equivocal permission.

“Willian Harvey, the officer in charge of the CIA's attempt
using underworld figures to assassinate Castro, testified that
he never discussed the plot with McCone or officials of the
Kennedy Administration because he believed that it had been
fully authorized by the previous Director, because he was
uncertain whether it had a chance of succeeding, and because
he believed that it was Helms‘, not his, duty to inform higher

authorities.

Nonetheless, the Committee believes there were occasions
on which it was incumbent on Harvey to have disclosed the
assassination operation. As head of Task Force W, the branch
of the CIA responsible for covert operations in Cuba, Harvey
reported directly to General Lansdale and the Special Group
Augmented. The Special Group Augmented had made known ‘that

_ covert operations in Cuba should be first approved by it, both
by explicit instruction and by its practice that particular

operations be submitted in "nauseating detail". Yet Harvey

HW 50955 Docld:32493425 Page 182


-33-

did not inform either General Lansdale or the Special Group
Augmented of the assassination operation, either when he was
explicitly requested to report to McConé, General Taylor,
and the Special Group on his activities in Miami in April
1962, or when the subject of assassination was raised in the
: August 1962 meeting and McCone voiced his disapproval.

The Committee finds that the reasons advanced for not
having informed those responsible for formulating policy
about the assassination operation were inadequate, misleading,
and inconsistent. Some officials viewed assassination as ,
too important and sensitive to discuss with superiors, while
others considered it not sufficiently important. Harvey
testified that it was premature to tell McCone about the
underworld opération in Aprii 1962, because it was not
sufficiently advanced, but too late to tell him about it in
August 1962, since by that time he had decided to terminate
it. On other occasions, officials thought disclosure was
someone else's responsibility; Bisseli said he thought it was
up to Dulles’, Harvey believed it was up to Helms, but Heims
remarked that Harvey “kept Phase II pretty much in his back

* pocket".

Po

HW 50955 DocId:324293425 Page 183


~34-

The Committee concludes that the failure clearly to
inform policymakers of the assassination effort against
Castro was grossly improper. The Committee believes that
it should be incumbent upon the DDP to report such a
sensitive operation to his superior, the DCI, no matter how -
grave his doubts might, be about the possible outcome of the
operation. It follows that the DCI has the same duty to
accurately inform his superiors.

Trujillo

In the Trujillo case there were several instances in
which it appears that policymakers were not given sufficient
information, or were not informed in a timely fashion.

At a meeting on December 29, 1960, Bissell presented a
plan to the Special Group for supporting Dominican exile groups
and local dissidents, and stated that the plan would not bring
down the regime without "some decisive stroke against Trujillo
-himself". At a meeting on January 12, 1961, the Special Group
authorized the passage of "limited supplies of small arms and
other material'' to Dominican dissidents under certain conditions.
At this time; the fact that the dissidents had been contemplating
the assassination of Trujillo had been know in the State Department
at the level of the Assistant Secretary of State for Inter-
American Affairs, and by senior officials of the CIA, including the DCI.

Yet the memorandum supplied to. Under Secretary Merchant, which

a

HW 50955 Docld:32423525 Page 184


= 35-

was said to have been the basis upon which the: Special Group
agreed to the "limited supply" of small arms, did not mention
assassination. To the contrary, it spoke of "sabotage potential"
and stated that there “would be no thought of toppling the
[government] by any such minor. measure [as the supplying of
small arms]."

On February 17, 1961, Richard Bissell ‘sent a memorandum
on the Dominican Republic to ‘McGeorge Bundy. Bissell knew
that the dissidents planned to assassinate Trujillo,- but his
memorandum did not mention assassination. It indicated that
the dissidents’: "plan of action" included arms for 300 men.
Those involved agreed that support of this nature suggested a
non-targeted paramilitary plan, not an assassination.

The passage of the carbines was approved by CIA head-

Pam quarters on March 31, 1961. The State Department was apparently
“unaware of this passage for several weeks. The pouching of the
-machine guns was not disclosed outside the CIA.

‘The State Department official from whom the CIA sought
permission to pass the machine guns stated that on "cross -
examination" the CIA official conceded that the purpose. was
assassination. The GIA official then agreed the United States
should have nothing to do with assassination plots “anywhere,
anytime", even though the previous day he and Bissell had signed
a draft cable permitting the passage of the machine guns for

use in connection with a planned assassination. -

Schneider

_ The issue here is not whether the objectives of the CIA were
contrary to those of the Administration. It is clear that Presi-
dent-Nixon desired to prevent Allende from. assuming office, even
if that required fomenting and supporting a coup in Chile. Nor
did White House officials suggest that tactics employed (includ-
ing as a first step to kidnapping General Schneider) would have
been unacceptable as a matter principle. Rather, the issue posed
is whether White House officials were consulted, and thus given
an opportunity to weigh such matters as risk and likelihood of suc-
cess, and to apply policy-making judgments to particular tactics.
The record indicates that up to October 15 they were; after Octo-
ber 15 there is some doubt.

The documentary record with respect to the disputed post-
October 15 period gives rise to conflicting inferences. On the one
hand, Karamessines' calendar shows existence of at least one White
“House contact in the critical period prior to the kidnapping of
General Schneider en October 22. However, the absence of any sub-
stantive memoranda in CIA files--when contrasted with several such
memoranda describing contacts with the White House between Septem-
ber 15 and October 15--may suggest a lack of significant communi -

“gation on the part of the CIA as well as a lack of careful super-

vision on the part’ of thé White House.

HW 50955 DocId:32423525 Page 186


-37-

The standards applied within the CIA itself suggest a
view that action which the Committee believes called for
top-level policy discussion and decision was thought of as
permissible, without any further consultation, on the basis
of the initial instruction to prevent Allende from assuming
power. Machine guns were sent to Chile and delivered to
military figures there on the authority of junior CIA officers
without consultation even with the CIA officer in charge of
the program. We find no suggestion of bad faith in the action
of the junior officers. But it necessarily establishes that
there was no advance permission from outside the CIA for the
passage of machine guns. And it also suggests an attitude
within the CIA toward consultation which was unduly lax.
Further, this case demonstratedthe problems inherent in giving

~ - an agency a "blank: check"! to engage in covert operations

without specifying which actions are and are not permissible,
-and without adequately supervising and monitoring these

activities once begun. ©

(b) On Occasion, Administration Officials Gave Vague

Instructions to Subordinates and Failed:to Make Sufficiently

Clear That Assassination Should Be Excluded From Consideration.

While.we cannot find that high Administration officials
expressly approved of the assassination attempts, we have

_ noted that certain agency officials nevertheless perceived

NW 50955 DocId:32423525 Page 187°


~38-

assassination to have been authorized. Although those officials
were remiss in not seeking express authorization for their
activities, their superiors were also at fault for giving
vague instructions and for not explicitly ruling out assassina-
tion. No written order prohibiting assassination was issued
until 1972, and that order was an internal CIA directive issued
by Director Helms.

Schneider

As explained above, there is no evidence that assassina-
tion was ever proposed as a method of carrying out the Presi-
dential order to prevent Allende from assuming office. The
Committee believes, however, that the granting of carte.
blanche authority to the CIA by the Executive in this case
may have contributed to the tragic and unintended death of
General Schneider. This was also partially due to impositing
an impractical task to be accomplished within an unreasonably
‘short time. Apart from the question of whether any inter-
vention was justified under the circumstances of this case,
the committee believes that the Executive in any event should —

have defined the limits of permissible action.

Lumumba

Weare unable to make a finding that President
Eisenhower intentionally authorized an assassination
effort against Lumumba because of the lack of absolute

certainty in the evidence. However, it appears that the

HW 50955 DocId:32423525 Page 188


~39-

strong language used in discussions at the Special Group and
NSC, as reflected in minutes of relevant meetings,
led Dulies to believe that assassination was desired. The
minutes contain language concerning the need to “dispose of"
Lumumba, an "extremely strong feeling about the necessity
for straight forward action", and a refusal to rule out any
activity that might contribute to “getting rid of" Lumumba.
Castro
The effort to assassinate Fidel Castro took place in an
atmosphere of extreme pressure by Eisenhower and Kennedy
Administration officials to discredit, and overthrow the Castro
regime. Richard Helms recalled that:
"T remember vividly [that the pressure] was very
intense. And therefore, when you go into the record,
you find a lot of nutty schemes there and those nutty
schemes were borne of the intensity of the pressure.
a And we were quite frustrated."
Bissell recalled that:
“During that entire period, the administration was
extremely sensitive. about the defeat that had been
afflicted, as they felt, on the U.S. at the Bay of
Pigs,. and were pursuing every possible means of
getting rid of Castro."
Another witness, Samuel Halpern, stated that sometime in
the Fall of 1961 Bissell was
"chewed out in the Cabinet Room in the White House by
both “the President and the Attorney General. for, as he
put it, sitting on his ass and not doing anything about

getting rid of Castro and the Castro Regime."

General Lansdale. informed the agencies cooperating in Operation

Mongoose that "you're in a combat situation where we have
been given full command". Secretary of Defense McNamara
confirmed that "we were hysterical about Castro at the time
of the Bay of Pigs and thereafter"...

Many of the plans that were discussed and often approved
contemplated violent action against Cuba. The operation
which resulted in the Bay of Pigs was a major paramilitary
onslaught that had the approval of the highest government
officials, including the two Presidents. Thereafter, Attorney

General Kennedy vehemently exhorted the Special Group Aug-

“mented that ‘a solution to the Cuban problem today carried

top priority . . . no time, money, effort--or manpower is

to be spared. Subsequently, Operation Mongoose involved
propaganda and sabotage operations aimed toward spurring a
revolt of the Cuban people against Castro. Measures that

were considered by the top policymakers included incapacita-

'. ting sugar workers during harvest:season by the use of

chemicals; blowing up bridges and production plants; sabotaging

merchandise in third countries--even those allied with
the United States--prior to its delivery to Cuba; and arming

insurgents on the island. Programs undertaken at the urging

in the recruitment and development of assets within Cuba,

of the Administration included intensive efforts to recruit
and arm dissidents within Cuba and raids on plants, mines,
and harbors.

Discussions at the Special Group and NSC meetings might
well have contributed to the perception of some CIA officials
that assassination was a permissible tool in the effort to
overthrow the Castro regime. At a Special Group meeting in
November 1960, Under Secretary Merchant inquired whether

: any planning had been undertaken for "direct, positive action"
against Che Guevarra, Raul and Fidel Castro. Cabell replied
that such a capability did not exist, but might well have

“left the meeting with the impression that assassination was
mot out of bounds. One phase of Lansdale's plans, which

was submitted to the Special Group in January 1962, aimed

ao at inducing "open revolt and overthrow.of the Communist

regime", and included in the final phase an “attack on the

. cadre of the regime, including key leaders". The proposal

stated that "this should’be a ‘Special Target'' operation
Gangster elements “night provide the best recruitment potential
against police. . ." Several minutes from Special Group
meetings contain language such as "possible removal of

Castro from the Cuban scene". Although Lansdale's proposal
was shelved, the type of aggressive action contemplated was
not ruled out.

On several occasions, the subject of assassination was .

HW 50955 Doold:32423525 Page 191


-42-

discussed in the presence of senior Administration officials.
While those officials never consented to actual assassina-
tion efforts, they.also failed to indicate that assassination
was impermissible as a matter of principle.

In early 1961, McGeorge Bundy was informed of a CIA
project described as the development of a capability to
assassinate.* Bundy raised no objection and, according to
Bissell, may. have been more affirmative. Although Bissell
stated that he did not infer authorization from Bundy's
remarks for the underworld plot against Castro that was then
underway, the fact that he believed that the development
of an assassination capability had been approved by the White
House (which he subsequently told to Harvey) may well have,

contributed to the general perception that assassination was

not prohibited.
Documents indicate that in May 1962, Attorney General
" Kennedy was told that the CIA had sought to assassinate

officials present at the briefing, the Attorney General

* Bundy, who was National Security Advisor to the President,

matter, even though it was only a discussion of a capability
to assassinate. His failure to do.so was a serious error:

HW 50955 DocTd:32423525 Page 192


-43-

indicated his displeasure about the lack of consultation

on the impropriety of the attempt itself.* There is no
evidence that the Attorney General told the CIA that it must
not-.engage in assassination plots.

At a meeting of the Special Group Augmented in August
1962, well after the assassination efforts were ‘underway ,
Robert McNamara is said to have raised the question of
whether the assassination of Cuban leaders should be explored,
and General Lansdale issued an action memorandum assigning
the CIA the task of preparing contingency plans. for the
assassination of Cuban leaders. While McCone testified
that he had immediately made it clear that assassination
was not to be discussed or condoned, Harvey's testimony

. and documents which he wrote after the event indicate that
Harvey may have been confused over whether McCone had
objected to the use of assassination, or whether he was only

concerned that the subject not be put in writing. In any

* Documents show that the Attorney General, Robert Kennedy,
learned in May of 1961 that the CIA had used underworld
figures in.an operation against Cuba. The documentary record
further reflects that the Attorney General was not told that
the operation had involved assassination efforts until May
of 1962, and that the operation was then described-to him
as having-been terminated in May 1961. There is no evidence
that the Attorney General suspected the true nature of the
operation until that briefing, ox that he learned that it
had not infact been terminated. While it is curious that
the Attorney General would not have inquired further into

the nature of the operation when he discovered that Sam “
Giancana had been involved in it, there is no evidence that
he did.

HW 50955 Docld:32423525 Page 193

“event, McCone went no further. He issued no general order
banning consideration of assassination within the Agency.

One of the. programs forwarded to General Lansdale by
the Defense Department in the Mongoose program was entitled
“Operation Bounty” and envisioned dropping leaflets in Cuba
offering rewards for the assassination of Government leaders.
“Although the plan was vetoed by Lansdale, it indicates that

" persons in agencies other than the CIA perceived that assas-
sination might be permissible.

While the ambivalence of Administration officials does
not excuse the misleading conduct by Agency officials or
justify their failure to seek explicit permission, it dis-
played an insufficient concern about assassination which
may have contributed to the perception that assassination
was an acceptable tactic in accomplishing the Government's
general objectives.

With the exception of the tight guidelines issued by

the Special Group Augmented concerning Operation Mongoose,

precise Limitations were never imposed on the CIA requiring
prior permission for the details of other proposed covert
operations against Cuba. No general policy banning assas-
sination was promulgated until Helms" intra-agency order

- in 1972. “tn light of the number of times in which the
subject of assassination arose, Administration officials

were remiss in not explicitly forbidding such activity. -

* * KO * *

The Committee notes that many of the occasions on
which CIA officials should have informed their superiors
of the assassination efforts but failed to do so, or did
so ina misleading manner, were also occasions on which
Administration officials paradoxically may have reinforced
the perceszion that assassination was permissible.

For example, when Bissell spoke with Bundy about an
executive action capability, Bissell failed to indicate that
an actual assas$ination operation was underway, but Bundy

failed to rule out -assassination as a tactic.

In May of 1962 the Attorney General was misleadingly told

about the effort to assassinate Castro prior to the Bay of Pigs,

“but not about the. operation that was then going on. The Attorney
General, however, did not state that assassination was improper.
When a senior administration official raiged the question
of whether assassination should be explored at a Special Group
meeting, the assassination operation should have been revealed,
but a firm written order against engaging in assassination should

also have been issued by MeCone if, as he testified, he had ex-

hibited strong aversion to assassination.

6. Practices Current at the Time in Which the Assas-

sination Plots Occurred Were Revealed by the Record to

Create the Risk of Confusion, Rashness, and Irresponsibility

in the Very Areas Where Clarity and Sober Judgment Was

Most Necessary.

Various witnesses described elements of the system
within which the assassination plots were conceived. The
Committee is disturbed by the custom that permitted the
most sensitive matters to be presented to the highest levels
of Government with the least clarity. We find this dis-
turbing, and view the following concepts as particularly
dangerous :

(1) The extension of the doctrine of “plausible denial"
beyond its intended purpose of hiding the involvement of ©
the United States from other countries to an effort to
shield higher officials from knowledge, and hence, responsi-
bility for certain operations.

(2) The use of circumlocution or euphemism to describe
serious. matters--such as assassination--when precise meanings
ought to be made clear. ;

(3) The theory that general approval of broad covert
action programs is. sufficient to justify specific actions

such as assassination or the passage of weapons.

HW 50955 Docld:32423525 Page 196


-47-

(4) The theory that authority granted, or assumed to
be granted, by one director or one administration could be
presumed to continue without the necessity for reaffirming
the authority with successor officials.

~ €5) .The creation of capabilities without careful
review and authorization by policymakers, and the risk that
such capabilities might be used without further authoriza-

tion.

(a) The Danger Inherent in Overextending the Doctrine
of Plausible Denial

The original concept of plausible denial envisioned
implementing covert actions in a manner calculated to conceal
American involvement if the actions were exposed. The
doctrine was at times a delusion. and at times a snare. It

was naive for policymakers to assume that sponsorship of

. actions as big as the Bay of Pigs invasion could be concealed.
The Committee's inquiry into assassination ‘and the public
disclosures which preceded it demonstrate that when the
United States resérted to cloak and dagger tactics, its hand
was ultimately exposed. In addition, the likelihood of
reckless action is substantially increased when policymakers

: believe that their decisions will never be revealed.

Whatéver can be said in defense of the original pur-
pose of plausible denial--a purpose which intends. to conceal

U.S. involvement from the outside world--the extension of

gy

HW 50955 DocId:324293525 Page 197


~48-

the doctrine to the internal decision-making process of

the Government is absurd. Any theory which, as a matter

of doctrine, places elected officials on the periphery of
the decision-making process is an invitation to error, an
abdication of responsibility, and a perversion of democratic
government,

(b) ‘The Dangers of Using "Circumlocution" and

“Euphemism"™
According to Richard Bissell, the extension of plausible
denial to internal decisionmaking required the use of cir-

cumlocution and euphemism in speaking with Presidents and

"- other senior officials.

Explaining this concept only heightens its absurdity.

On the one hand, it assumes that senior officials should be
shielded from the truth to enable them to deny knowledge if
the truth comes out. On the other hand, the concept assumes

’ that senior officials must be told enough, by. way of double
talk, to grasp the subject. As a consequence, the theory
fails to accomplish its objective and only increases the
risk of misunderstanding. Subordinate officials should des-
ceribe their proposals in clear, precise, and brutally frank
language; busy superiors are entitled to and should demand
no less.

Euphemism may actually have been preferred--not because

WH 50955 " Docld:32423525 Page 198


-492

of plausible denial--but because the persons involved

could not bring themselves to state in plain language what
they intended to do and may. have, in.some instances, assumed,
“rightly or wrongly, that the listening superiors did not
want the issue squarely placed before them. Assassinate,
murder and kill are words many people do not want to speak
or hear. They describe acts which should not even be pro-
posed, let alone plotted. Failing to call dirty business

by its rightful name may have increased the risk of dirty

business being done.

{(c) The Danger of Generalized Instructions.

Permitting specific acts to be taken on the basis of
general approvals of broad strategies (e.g., keep Allende
from assuming office, get rid of the Castro regime) blurs

a responsibility and accountability. Worse still, it increases
the danger that subordinates may take steps which would
have been disapproved if the policymakers had been informed.
A further danger is that policymakers might intentionally
use loose general instructions to evade responsibility for
embarrassing activities.

In either event, we find that the gap between the
general policy objectives and the specific actions under-
taken to achieve them was far too wide.

It is important that policymakers review the manner in

BW 50955 Doold:32423525 Page 199


-50-

y which their directives are implemented, particularly when
the activities are sensitive, secret, and immune from
public scrutiny.

(d) The Danger of "Floating Authorization”

One justification advanced by Richard Helms and William
Harvey for not informing John McCone about the use of under-
world figures to assassinate Fidel Castro was their assertion
that the project had already been approved by McCone's
predecessor, Allen Dulles, and that further authorization was
unnecessary, at least until the operation had reached a more
advanced stage.

Similarly, most of the actions taken in the Trujillo
case during the early months of the Kennedy Administration
were authorized by the Special Group on January 12, 1961,

ca at the end of the Eisenhower Administration.
The idea that authority might continue from one adminis-
. tration or director to the next and that there is no duty
to reaffirm authority with successors inhibits responsibie
decisionmaking. Circumstances may change or judgments differ.
New officiais should be given the opportunity to review
significant programs.

(e) The Problems Connected with Creating New Covert

Capabilities
The development of a new capability raises numerous

problems. Having a capability to engage in certain covert “

HY 50955 Docld:32423525 Page 200


-51-

activity increases the probability that it will occur,
since the capability represents a tool that is available
for use. There is the further danger that authorizing a
capability may be misunderstood as authorizing its use
without need for obtaining explicit authorization.

Of course, an assassination capability should never

have been created in the first place.

: (with possible reservation
V. RECOMMENDATIONS . as to language of statute)

During our iong investigation of. assassination, a number of vital issues
came into sharp ‘focus.” :
Above all, stood the question of-assassination. Our recommendations on
other issues should await the completion of our continuing investigations and
our final report.’ But we need no more information to convince us that a: lat
ban against assassination should be written into law. ~

We condemn assassination and reject it as an instrument of American

policy. Surprisingly, ‘at present there is no statute making it a crime to assas~

- sinate a foreign official outside the United States. Hence, for the reasons
set forth below, the Committee recommends the prompt enactment of a statute mak-- -
ing it a Federal crime to commit or attempt an assassination, or to conspire to |
do so. .

A. General agreement that the United States must net engage in assassina- |

tion. Our view that assassination has no place in America's arsenal is shared by
the Administration,
President Ford, in the same statement in which he asked this Committee to
deal with the assassination issue, stated:
I am opposed to political assassination. This administration

has. not and will not use such means. as instruments of national

policy. Presidential Press Conference, June 9, 1975, Weekly
Compilation of Presidential Documents, Vol. II, No. -24, p. 611.

The witnesses we examined uniformly condemned assassination. They denounced
it as immoral, described it as impractical, and reminded us that an open society,
most of all, runs the risk of the assassination of its own leaders. As President ~
Kennedy was reported to have said: “we can't get into that kind of thing, or we
would all be targets." (Goodwin 7/18/75, p. 4) ,

The current CIA Director and his two predecessors testified emphatically

that assassination should be banned. Thus, Colby said:

WW 50955 Doeld:32423525 Page 202 —


-2-

With respect to assassination, my position is clear. I
just think it. is wrong. And I have said so and made it
~ very clear to my subordinates. © (5/21/75, p. 89)

Colby's predecéssor, Helms, although himself involved in an-earlicr plot,

‘said he had concluded assassination should be ruled out for both moral and

practical reasons:

As a result of my experiences through the years, when I be-
came Director I had made up my mind that this: option...of
killing foreign leaders, was something that I did not want
to happen on my watch. “My reasons for this were these:

There are not only iéral reasons but there-are also
some other rather practical reasons. -

It is almost impossible in a democracy to keep any~
thing like: that secret.... Somebody would go to a Con-
gressman, his Senator, he might go to a newspaper man, what-
ever the case may be, but it just is not a practical alterna-
tive, it seems to me, in our society.

Then there is another consideration. if you are going
to try by this kind of means to remove a foreign leader,
then who is going to take his place! running that country,
and are you essentially better off as a matter of practice
when it is over than you were before? And I can give you I :
think a very solid example of this which happened ‘in Vietnam
when President Diem was eliminated ‘from the scene. We then
had a revolving door of prime ministers after that for quite.
some period of tiem, during which the Vietnamese Government
at a time in its history when it should have been strong was
nothing but a caretaker government....In other
words, that whole exercise tarned out to the disadvantage of
the United States.

«+sthere is no sense in my sitting here with all the ex-
perience 1 have had and not sharing with the Committee my
feelings this day. It isn't because I have lost my cool,
or because I have lost my guts, it ‘simply is because I don't
think it is a viable option in the United States of America these
days. .

Chairman Church. Doesn't it also. follow, Mr. Uelns
_ . agree with what you have said fully ---but doesn't it
also follow on the practical side, apart from the moral side,
that since these secrets are bound to come out, when they do,
they do very grave political damage to the United States in
the world at large? I don't know to what extent the Russians

involved themselves ‘in political assassinations, but under .
their system they at least have a better. prospect of keep~ '
ing it concealed. Since we do like a free soctety and

Since these secrets are going to come out’ in due course, the
revelation will then do serious injury’ to the good name and
reputation of the United States,

Would you agree with that?

Mr. Helms. “Yes, I would. : : ~

Mr. Helms. Yes, sir. (6/13/75, pp. 76-78)

Similarly, John NcCone said he was opposed to assassinations

because:

i didn't’ think it was Proper from the standpoint of the U.S.
Government and the Central Intelligence Agency. (6/6/75, p, 15)

B. CTIA Directives Bannin; Assassination. In 1972 and 1973, Helms and!
ee _Senning Assassination. :

then Colby issued internal CIA orders banning assassination. In his order, Helms
said: . .

It has recently again been alleged in the press that CIA
engages in assassination, As you are well aware, this is nor
the case, and Agency policy has long*been clear on this issue.
To underline it, however, I direct that no such activity or
operation be undertaken, assisted or suggested by any of our
personnel..., (Memorandum, Helms to Deputy Directors; 3/6/72)

Colby, in one of a series of orders in August 1973 arising out of the Adency's
own review of prior "questionable activity," issued an order. which stated:
CIA will not engage in assassination nor induce, assist or

Suggest to others that assassination be employed. (Memorandum, Colby
_ to Deputy Directors, 8/29/73)

HW 50955 DocId:32423525 Page 204

C. The need. for a statute. Commendable and welcome as they are, these

CIA ‘directives are not ‘sufficient. Administrations change, CIA directors change,
and goneday in the future what was tried in the past may once again become a teaipt~
ation. Assassination plots did happen. It would be irresponsible for us not to do
all that we can do to prevent their happening again. Laws express eur society's.
values; they deter those who might be tempted and stiffén the will of: those who!
want to resist.

The statute we recommend, which is printed as an appendix to this report,
makes it a criminal offense for persons subject to the jurisdiction of the United
States 1) to ‘conspire, within or outside the United States, to assassinate a
foreign official; 2) to attempt to assassinate a foreign official, or 3) to assas~

sinate a foreign official. oo coos

Present law makes it a crime to kill, or to conspire to kill, a foreign
official or foreign official guest while such.a person is in the Unired States.
18 U.S.C. 116; 18 U.S.C. 1117. However, there is no Law which makes it ‘a.crime
to assassinate, or to conspire or attempt to assassinate, a foreign offteial
while such official. is outside the United States. Our proposed statute. is thus :
designed to close this gap in the law. ‘

Subsection (a) of the proposed statute would punish conspiracies formed
within the United States; subsection {b) punishes conspiracies outside of the
United States. Subsection (b) is necessary to eliminate the loophode which would
otherwise permit persons to simply leave the United States and conspire abroad. .
Subsections (c) and (d), respectively, make it an offense to attempt to kill or _
to kill a foreign official outside the United States.

Subsections (a) through (d) specifically apply to any “officer or employee

of the United States" to make clear that the statute punishes conduct by U.S.

HW 50955 Docld:32423525 Page 205


-5-

" government personnel, as well as conduct by private citizens having no relation:
to the-U.S. government: In addition, subsection (a), dealing with conspiracies

within the United States, applies to “any other person," whether or not a United

States citizen. Noncitizens whe conspire within the United States to assassi~

“nate a foreign official clearly come within the jurisdiction of U.S. law! Sub-
sections (b) through (d), which deal with conduct outside the United States, apply -
to U.S. citizens, and to officers or employees of the United States, whether or.
hot they are citizens. Criminal liability for conduct cutside the United States
of persons who are not us. citizens of-whe do not hold 2 position as a officer
or employee of the United States are matters for the law of the place where such-
conduct takes place. . :

The term "foreign official" is defined in subjection (4) (2). The defini-

tion makes it clear ‘that the offense may be committed even though the official :

belongs to an insurgent force, an unrecognized government, or a non-governmental
political party. Our investigation -- as well as the reality of international |
f

politics -- has shown ‘that. officials in such organizations are potential ‘targets

for assassination.*/ : i

The offenses are limited to conduct aimed at such persons because of their
official duties or status, or their political views, actions, or statements. Thus,

. for example, a conspiracy to kill or the killing of a foreign official, which is

not politically motivated would not be: punishable under this statute.
The definition of official in section (4) (2) also provides that such per~

son must be an official of a foreign government or movement "with which the

United States is not at war or against which the United States Armed Forces have

*/For example, Lumumba was not an official of the Congolese government at the
time of the plots against his life, and Trujillo, though the dictator, held no
official governmental position in the latter perfod of his regime.

not been introduced into hostilities or situations pursuant to the provisions of
the War Powers Resolution.” This definition makes it clear that, absent ‘a decla-
ration of war or the introduction of United States Armed Forces pursuant :to the ,
War Powers Resolution, the killing of. foreign officials is a criminal offense.

finsert discussion of paramilitary aspect]

kA KK

In the course of our hearings, some witnesses, while strongly condemning -
assassination, asked whether, as a matter of theory, assassination should absolutely
be ruled out in a time’of truly unusual national emergency. Adolf Hitler was cos

cited as’ an example. Of course, the cases with which we were concerned were not,

of that character.*/ In a grave emergency, the President has a limited power to

act, not in violation of the law, but in accord with his own responsibilities

under the Constitution to defend the Nation. As the Supreme Court has declared,; the

Constitution "is not a suicide pact." Kennedy v. Nendoza-Martinez, 372 U.S. 146,

160 (1963).

Abraham Lincoln, in an unprecedented emergency, claimed unprecedented ‘

power based on the need to preserve the nation:

++-my oath to preserve the Constitution to the best of
my ability, imposed upon me the duty of preserving, by
every indispensable means, that government -- that
nation -~- of which that Constitution was the organic law.
Was it possible to lose the nation, and yet preserve the
Constitution? By general, law life and limb must be pro- ‘
tected; yet often a limb must be amputated to save a life;
but a life is never wisely given to save a limb. I felt -
that measures, otherwise unconstitutional, might become
lawful, by becoming indispensable to the preservation of

_ the Constitution, through the preservation of the nation

. The Compiete Works of Abraham Lincoln, Vol. X,

pp- 65-66 (Nicolay and Hay, Eds. 1894).

*/Indeed, in the only situation of true national crisis’--. the Cuban missile
crisis -- assassination was not even considered.

Of course, whatever the extent of the President's own constitutional
powers, it is a ‘fundamental principle of our constitutional: system that these

powers are ‘checked and Limited by the Congress, including the Congress’ power

of impeachment. As a necessary corollary, any action taken by a President pare;

suant to his limited inherent powers and in appazent conflict with the law

must be disclosed to the Congress. Only then may the Congress judge whether the acm >

tion truly represented, in Lincoln's phrase, an "indispensable necessity" to

the life of the Nation. . 7 . : -

for ratification: "In full view of his great responsibility he has, so far,
