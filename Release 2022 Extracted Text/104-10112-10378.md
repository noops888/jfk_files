FROM 1 H. Pme )

supyect: CONEIN, Tacien Emile
#502

1. SI clearance recommendation has been requested concerning
Subject.

2. Subject served in a military capacity with the Agency and
its predecessors from 1943 to 1956. Since his retirement from the mili-
tary in 1961 Subject has deen assigned in FE Division as a(Career
GS-13. Investigations were conducted concerning Subject by OSS. in 1943
and CIA in 1948, and NAC's were completed in 1961. He was polygraphed
with favorable results in 1951 and 1953 and the last polygraph in 1961
revealed noteworthy information which pertains to Subject's attempt at
smoking opium on two occasions while stationed in Indo China in 19)5.

7 3. Subject was born in France of French-born parents and ac-
quired U. S. citizenship in 1942. His mother was naturalized a U. S.
citizen in 1959. Subject has one brother who is a French citizen, re-
siding in France, concerning whom Subject in 1953 reported no personal
contact since 1946 or 1947. His present wife wes born in Vietnam of
French-born parents and acquired U. §. citizenship in 1959. Subject re-
portedly has no contact with his father-in-law who retains his French
citizenship and resides in New Caledonia. Subject's father and mother-
in-law are deceased.

4. In addition to the above relatives, Subject was married at
Paris in 1946 to Monique Veber, a native-born French citizen of French
parents. Subject divorced Miss Veber in December 1947. Subject ad-
vised during 1951 polygraph that Miss Veber had been sympathetic to
Commmism; however, no further amplification was made (Cf. Memo 29 Oct.
1951). In 1962 Division reported,that Miss Veber was the mistress
of an individual in whom IO Division tad expressed an interest, land it
was "rumored" that Monique Veber's family might be involved in some
kind of Commie-type activity. It is noted that a Source K check in

-1961 reflects information that one Monique Veber, the mistress of Gabriel

a'Arboussier, was temporarily residing with Ruben Um Nyobe, Secretary
General of Union of Cameroon Peoples.

5. The French citizenship of Subject's brother and father-in-
law is not believed to preclude SI consideration in view of Subject 's
limited association with them. Subject's former relationship with Monique
Veber and the possible involvement of her family in Commmnist activity
are not believed to bar SI consideration in the absence of information
indicating his former relatives could constitute a source of pressure. It
is recommended, therefore, that:

A. No objection be interposed to Subject's clearance for
SI information

B. OCI be advised of the information concerning Subject's
foreign relatives.
