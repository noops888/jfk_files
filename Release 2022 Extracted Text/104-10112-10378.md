1. SI clearance recommendation has been requested concerning

Subject.

2.

Subject served in a military capacity with the Agency and

its predecessors from 1943 to 1956. Since his retirement from the mili-

tary in 1961 Subject has been assigned in FE Division as a Career Agent,

GS-13. Investigations were conducted concerning Subject by OSS in 1943

and CIA in 1948, and NAC's were completed in 1961. He was polygraphed

with favorable results in 1951 and 1953 and the last polygraph in 1961

revealed noteworthy information which pertains to subject's attempt at

smoking opium on two occasions while stationed in Indo China in 1945.

3.

Subject was born in France of French-born parents and ac-

quired U. S. citizenship in 1942. His mother was naturalized a U. S.

citizen in 1959. Subject has one brother who is a French citizen, re-

siding in France, concerning whom Subject in 1953 reported no personal

contact since 1946 or 1947•

His present wife was born in Vietnam of

French-born parents and acquired U. S. citizenship in 1959.

citizenship and resides in New Caledonia. Subject's father and mother-

in-law are deceased.

Paris in 1946 to Monique Veber, a native-born French citizen of French

parents. Subject divorced Miss Veber in December 1947. Subject ad-

vised during 1951 polygraph that Miss Veber haà been sympathetic to

5. The French citizenship of Subject's brother and father-in-

law is not believed to preclude SI consideration in view of Subject's

limited association with them. Subject's former relationship with Monique

Veber and the possible involvement of her family in Communist activity

are not believed to bar SI consideration in the absence of information

indicating his former relatives could constitute a source of pressure. It

is recommended, therefore, that:

A. No objection be interposed to Subject's clearance for

SI information

B. OCI be advised of the information concerning Subject's

foreign relatives.
