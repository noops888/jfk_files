MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, Technical Services Division

ATTENTION t Chief, TSD/AN8
SUBJECT + Request for TOY Replacement for Arnold Fe
ARENART.

1, SH Division requests your cooperation fn providing &
THY replacement for Arnold Fy ASEHART as Case Fficer and
technician for the PTENYGY tap center in ‘lexico City, AREVART
has requested three weeks hore leave, from 10 to 28 September,
to drive his olter son to the States to enroll in his
freshnan year of college. ARFEART has kept his leave plans
toa windmum so that his TY replacenent ubll need te be on
Joan from Neadquarters for as short A time as possible,

2. The Pivision had offered to provide an eperations
officer ns a TDY replacerent but Mexico City Station has re-
quested that a technician be sent instead since the burden of
AREHART?S Job is the maintenance of ecauiprent alone with the
protection of CTA's interests inside the UP. ¥ ivision supe
gests that your rolease of ‘ir. Charles Deck for this assigns
nent would be ideal if ne is available, as no overlap would
he required since he is already knowledseable cf this operas
tion, The Station was also very pleased with the work done
by Yr. Yeck on his last TPY to Mexico,

3, Beenuse of the critical role the LTFAVCY Project
plays in the Station's whole operational picture, and hecause
of the importance the senoth-functioning of the tf is to car
Linfson with top-level Yexican officials, your assistance is
requested, If Ur, feck 4s not available, any other suitable
enndidate would be acceptable. Please inform “tr, Sustes,
U/L Mexico, X-4556, °4597 of your decision, as we sould like
to be able to inform Meztco as soon as possible as te whether
a THY replacement will be available.

Reference: HMMA 23522

1. Referenced dispatch which reflected the Station's apprecia=
tion of Newten T. RUTSAY's high level of performance during his
recent TRY in Nexico and requested his return TDY was brought to
the attention of the appropriate KURTOT officials.

2. Unfortunately, RUTSAY will not he available to replace
ARENART during the latter's hone leave period in the fall of 1964;——-
and KURIOT has ne one else they can release for a prolonged period
this fall. Since the leave probably will only be about two ronths,
Peadouarters wonders whether a technician is absolutely required,

Dees the Station believe that an operations officer, with some
Spanish and who could worcly take over the administrative work and
bake the Station contacts, couid ill in during this period?

3, We are not sanguine that a replacerent can be made avail~
able particularly since the man will of necessity need to be
exposable” to liaison, but will try our hest to find onc. | In the
reantire, please forward the exact dates it is desired the hoped
for man should be in Mexico to allow for adequate overlap.

sensitive tape was the obvious answer to this
problem, but the first ten rolls of pressure

tape were received after nearly four years of
struggling with the defective ports. It is
recommended that pressure sensitive tape be

The tea rolls of pressure sensitive tape

The Rapacki Plan :

1, The Polish proposal tor a Central European
nuclear-free zone was introduced at the 2 October 1957
session of the UN General Assembly by the Polish Foreign
Minister, Adam Rapacki. Acting as spokesman for the
Polish Government, he formulated the proposal: should
both East and West Germany agree to a ban on the produc-
tion and storage of nuclear weapons on their territories,
Poland would simultaneously introduce an identical ban on
her territory. Rapucki did not mention Czechoslovakia,
but the head of the Czechoslovak UN delegation, speaking
after Rapacki, supported his proposal, declaring that his
couatry would join the agreement, extending the ban over
her territory, too. The East Germans subsequently warmly
endorsed the proposal.

2. Rapacki's proposal had obviously been cleared ard
coordinated with Soviet leaders prior to its introduction.
Moscow promptly reported the proposal approvingly and the
Soviet press stressed that such an agreement would te wel-
comed by the peoples of Europe, would facilitate agreement
on disarmament and cessation of nuclear tests, and would
‘help improve relations and bring closer together" the two
German states.

3. The proposal was formalized in a 9 December 1957
Polish government memorandum, which was presented by Rapacki
to the US, British, and French ambassadors in Warsaw. The
then Soviet Premier, Bulganin, promptly endorsed the pro-
posal in a sertes of letters to heads of governments through-
out, the world.

4, In 1958 Rapacki modified his plan, allegedly to make
it more palatable to the Western powers. The new version
of the plan, published in November 1953, called for a two-
stage program, in which: (1) current nuclear stockpiles and
bases would be frozen and production of nuclear weapons woul
be banned in Poland, Czechoslovakia, East and West Germany,
and (2) existing nuclear stockpiles and weapons would &



eliminated as a part of a general disarmament agreement
for the four-nation area, The revised version of the

plan also called for "air and ground control’ with NATO
and Warsaw Pact countries participating in the control

system,
5. Polish leaders have since 1957 pressed for a formal

agreement on the Rapacki plan. Shortly after the opening
of the Geneva disarmament conference in March 1962, the

-Polish delegation submitted a memorandum urging creation

of a nuclear-free zone tn Central Europe, The memorandum"
basically follows the lines of the former proposals of the
Rapacki plan. The Soviet delegation is currently urging
that the Geneva disarmament conference take up the question
of nuclear-free zones in various areas of the world.

6. Since the Rapacki plan was introduced, it has had
strong support from Moscow. The Soviets have even urged
extending the zone to include Baltic and Ba}kan countries.
Soviet leaders undoubtedly view the proposal as a moans of
eliminating German power in Contral Europe--one of Moscow's
major foreign policy objectives.

7. The US strongly opposes the Rapacki plan, viewing
it as a Bloc device to neutralize Germany, to decpen and
even perpetuate the division of Germany, and to secure
de facto recognition of East Germany. Inplementation of the
proposal would also be militarlly disadvantageous to the
West. US military power in Furope would be diminished with-
out a concurrent decrease of Soviet strength, It would
weaken NATO,

8, The West German government is also vigorously op-
posed to the Rapacki plan and all such "disengagement" plans
in Central Europe for the same reasons. Bona also considers
such proposals as sinister and subtly intimidatory to the
West Germans, who do not choose to be dealt-with as if they
were inert objects, and who detect in such schemes a creation
of conditions for their eventual communization.

9. Public endorsement of the Rapacki plan by the Mexican
president would mark the first such specific approval by a
government leader outside the Soviet Bloc. His endorsement
would be widely propagandized by the Poles and the Soviets
and could set a precedent for them to secure such approval '

by other nonbloc leaders,

“ACTION REQUIRED: For Your Information
- REFERENCE :  DIRECTOR-65355, 12 January 1969

1. As indicated in Reference and other communications, a
training request was made by the Station and approved by Headquarters,
to train a group under the LIENVOY Project to follow up on leads
produced by the joint LIENVOY operation and presumably other
Mexican Government unilateral sources. Lee R. MYLECHRAINE, WOSMOLD
instructor who was assigned to the Mexico City Station until ® {
8 July 1968, was selected as the instructor, MYLECIRAINE arrived
in Mexico City on 9 January 1969; the training began on 13 January |
and ended on 10 February 1969. The training was conducted at 7 |

Mexico City, provided by LIENVOY-2 and LIELEGANT; the building in

which the training site apartment is located is owned by LIELEGANT,
and the latter and LIENYOY-2 have their offices there. The unit,
upon completion of the training, will use the apartment in which
the training was conducted for their offices.

2. The LIENVOYs had originally requested that five (5) of
their men be trained, However, upon arrival in Mexico City and
just prior to the scheduled beginning of the training they
requested that they be permitted to add one man and that two men
be included in the class from the Direccion Federal de Seguridad
(DFS). In the latter case. they submitted tnree names but said
that only two of the three would be expected to attend the class.
As it turned out' all thre of the latter group turned up, thus
bringing the class to nine (9) students, five (5) Army officers,
one civilian from the LIENVOY group, and the three DFS men,
Following is a list of the trainees:

(1) Felix LOZANO Rangel. DFS, age 35.
———-- (2) Javier MANCERA Fuentes, DFS, age 33.
(3) Esteban GUZMAN Salgado, DFS, age 33.
(4) Leonardo LOPEZ y LOPEZ, age 23.
(5) Felipe TREJO Gonzalez, Lt. Col., Mexican
Army, age 46,
(6) Mariano CHANTRES Molina, Captain, Mexican
Army, age 39.
(7) Ladislao SALINAS Alor, Captain, Mexican
Army, age 31.
(8) Jorge MARGAIN Ortiz, Captain, ‘Mexican
Army, age 29.
(9) Rogelio Rafael GARZA Hernandez, Lieutenant,
Mexican Army, age 26,

3. The training objective of the program was to familiarize
the trainees with the basic tradecraft principles and techniques
involved in the conduct of clandestine activities, with primary
emphasis on the work and activities of security services, Although
largely tutorial in nature, numerous exercises were conducted in
Mexico City, including two live problems which will bevaxplained
later in this dispatch, to further familiarize the trainees with the
techniques involved in surveillance, counter-surveillance, personal
meetings,. d&addrops, interrogation, and investigation, The course
included discussion and reading material on opposition to clandestine
activities, organization and functions of a security service.
personal, physical and organization security; cover, concealment
and compartmentation, as well as the basic operational skills of
observation, description. casing, surveillance, and elicitation
and interviewing, Considerable time was spent on reporting and
clandestine communications, as well as on agent acquisition and

agent handling.

4, With the agreement of LITEMPO-12 {who said verbally that
he had consulted with LITENPO-4) and LIENVOY-2, the three DFS
trainees detained Hector SENTIES Rodriguez, who is known to have
had clandestine contact with the Sovicts, for interrogation, He
zas dctained on the street near his home on the early morning of
4 February 1969 and interrozated throughout the day at a motel,
the Palo Alto, located at Km 14 on the Mexico City-Tolucahighway,
The other six (5) trainees were able to overhear the entire inter-
rogation but did not actually take part for security reasons. They
did not see SENTIES, nor did the latter see them, In line with
the discussions and reading material, this live interrogation was of
great value to them. Also. on 3 February 1969 LIENVOY-2 passed

long to MNYLECHRAINE a gocd lead concerning Carlos PEREZ Aguirre,
a young Mexican who also has cont

this lead, but even this was of value to the trainees. One trainee
was required to mike a pretext telephone call, another team of two
made a neighborhood check, and the remainder were divided into teams
to check with Transito, the Ministry of Defense, the Social Security
Institute and tho Metropolitan Police, Except for the last team,
all picked up some information of value, and the information and

its significance in terms of the projected investigation of PEREZ
was discussed with them,

5, The performance of the class as a whole was remarkably
good. The threc DFS men,-because of their previous training and
experience, were ablo to absorb and understand the lectures and
reading. material much more quickly than the others, None of the
others had any provious training or experience in intelligence or
security work,, However, they were keenly interested, actively
participated in classroom discussions and field exercises, and all
prepared their written work in an acceptable manner. The instructor
reviewed all written work with them, as woll as plans for meetings,
ete., and this proved most helpful, Somewhat unusual for Latins,
all students wore punctual; there were some very small and unimpor-
tant delays, but for the most part these were due to the exceedingly
difficult traffic situation in Mexico City or to other reasons
apparently beyond their control, No student was absent from classes
during the ontire training period, and no student was late for

more than 45 minutes or an hour,

6. In summary, the instructor and the Station (col that the
training objective was accomplished, and that the trainees, although
hot yot experienced operators, have a sufficient enough understanding
of the basic tradecraft principles and techniques to permit thom to
begin operations. They are all intelligent and alert men, and
except for LOPEZ y LOPEZ all have an Army background, CHANTRES 1s
quite imaginative and resourceful, but. also quite cautious and
concerned about the possibility of flaps and compromises, He gets
along woll with all his fellow workers, and undoubtedly has real
leadership qualities. TREJO is somewhat talkative, opinionated and
argumentative, and may have trouble supervising others, but he,
too, demonstrated considerable imagination and resourcefulness,
GARZA, the youngest of the Army group, appeared to be the most pro-
American, is very imaginative, and possesses considerable drive and
energy. |On one occasion he had tho instructor out to lunch at his
home, where he lives with his wife (they have no children), He
commented on numerous occasions about his many (almost annual)
shopping trips to San Antonio, where his wife has a number of close
relatives. GARZA, it is believed, would probably be the most
susceptible to development and possible recruitment of the group.

7. Except for the remarks in paragraph 6 above. no individual
assessment will ho forwarded herewith, Tho instructor has prepared
& memorandum on each man, including the DFS group, setting forth
his observations and opinions, as well as any information he was

able to obtain on the trainees.

8, MYLECHRAINE used the name "Sr, Tomas" with the trainees;
so far as is known they did not learn his true name, nor were they
aware where he was living in Mexico City, Likewise, they are not
aware that he has served previously in Mexico, There were no
incidents involving security during the training period, and no
other incidents or events that should be reported.
