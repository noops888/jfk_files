been retained as counsel for the subject, had appeared in the

Superior Court on that morning and, without forewarning, had been

confronted by the subject in company with ZUSSMAN and FRANK COOPER,

Phoenix bondsman, and had at this time been informed that his

services on behalf of the subject were no longer desired.

She

stated that according to CONNORS, COOPER seemed to be directing the

subject's

actions and was responsible for the change in attorneys.

She stated that CONNORS had considered his dismissal as highly

irregular, and he felt that ZUSSMAN's action in the matter was

some -

what unethical. She

stated that under

the circumstances however,

there was little that CONNORS could do She advised that CONNORS

did not know just what COOPER's position was in the matter and what

could be gained by the appointment of new counsel other than time.

Phoenix T-1, who has furnished reliable information in

the past, advised that following

the subject's arrest at Jackson,

Mississippi, FRED LOZANO, SR., the Dallas bondsman who held the

primary liability on the

subject's phoenix bond, had sent his son,

FRED LOZANO, JR., and & (FNU) WHITE, who transports prisoners for

bondsmen for a fee, to Jackson where they paid the subject's fine.

Phoenix T-1 stated

that the subject was then forced to accompany

them to Dallas and upon arrival there, WHITE was given $400.00 for

delivery of the subject to Phoenix for

surrender to the Maricopa

County Superior Court.

Phoenix I-l stated that WHITE reportedly

left Dallas with his

wife and the subject on about June 17, 1959,

and their whereabouts was not again known to either LOZANO

or him-

self until the subject appeared in court on June 24, 1959.

Phoenix T-1 stated that he did, however, on June 18, 1959, receive

& call from COOPER, who until this time had no known interest in the

matter, and was informed by COOPER that neither he nor LOZANO bad

need to worry about the subject's appearance in court and their

bond, since he could assure his presence on June 24, 1959.

Phoenix T-1 stated that from his conversations with

LOZANO, he feels certain that LOZANo did not know that the subject

was being turned over to COOPER, since WHITE had been specifically

ordered to surrender him to the

court. He stated that he there-

fore has no knowledge of how the deal was made with COOPER to

write a new bond and obtain the services of a new attorney. He

stated that LOZANO had informed him when he had originally written

the subject's bond,

that COOPER had also approached the subject

and HARRY RAYMOND POPE, who was arrested with the subject at

Phoenix, and had informed CARTER that he could get the charge against

him fixed for $5000.00.

He stated that he was later informed that

the original figure

had been reduced to $2500,00, but he personally

feels that COOPER has no chance to make such a "fix" in view of the

seriousness of the charges pending against both the subject and POPE.

Phoenix T-l advised however that in spite of bis feelings in the

matter,

the subject has apparently "bought" COOPER's proposition.

He stated that COOPER to his knowledge made the new bond for

the

subject without the benefit of any cosigners, and he would assume

that the subject's collateral for the bond was therefore very solid,

if not cash.

Phoenix T-l stated that upon learning that ZUSSMAN had

been appointed as counsel for the subject, be asked ZUSSMAN if he

had gotten any fee from the

subject, whereupon ZUSSMAN is reported

to have told hin that he had no worry about his fee from the subject

since he was part of

a criminal syndicate that would take care of

the fee if it was not taken care of by the subject himself.

Phoenix T-1 stated that ZUSSMAN did not enlarge upon this statement

and he therefore had no knowledge as to what, it any, credence

should be given to such an assertion.

nach no kno desertion.

Phoenix T-1 stated that the

subject to his knowledge did not remain in the Phoenix area follow-

ing his release under his new bond, and it is his feeling that he

Captain FRANK POPELLO, Maricopa County Sheriff's Office,

Phoenix, on June 25, 1959, advised that he had overheard a conver-

sation between LOUIS ZUSSMAN and an unidentified person in which they

were discussing the bond which FRANK COOPER had made on behalf of the

subject.

POPELLO stated that ZUSSMAN informed the unidentified

party that COOPER had no worries on the bond since even though the

subject did not appear, he had connections that would take care of

On July 24, 1959, the Minneapolis Office furnished the

following information:

that there was a memorandum in the JARRELL LEE CARTER file dated

MIssissippi.

BERNATH said that the file reflected that Detective

Captain WILLIAM MAHMKE of the Minneapolis Police Department con-

sulted with Hennepin County Attorney ARNOLD MESHBESHER.

At that

time BERNATH stated that the memorandum reflects that there was

not sufficient evidence in MESHBESHER's opinion to extradite

CARTER, but MESHBESHER was of the opinion that if the case was

worked up further it would probably be possible to extradite CArTER.

BERNATH explained that the original warrant issued for

CARTER was a John Doe Warrant and the warrant was later ammended

tO CARTER's true name.

BERNATH stated thathe will find out if the case has

been handled by the Detective Bureau of the Minneapolis Police

Department. He said that as of July 20, 1959, the warrant out-

standing charging CARTER with Grand Larceny, Second Degree, was still

in effect and that the detainer filed on CARTER at Phoenix was still

in force.

It should be noted that on August 12, 1959, Dallas T-2,

who has furnished reliable information in the past, advised that one

JIMMY DOLAN, FBI No. 733252A, of Dallas, had told I-2 that he had

contacts in Minneapolis who

he was using in an effort to have

Minneapolis authorities drop charges against CARTER or take no

action on the charges presently outstanding against CARTER. T-2

further stated that while bond arrangements were being made for

CARTER and POPE at Phoenix in November and December, 1958,. DOLAN

had told the person making the arrangements that if there were

any questions asked by the Phoenix attorney, HARRY STEWART, that

the names PAUL CLINITE and BILL SWIFT should be mentioned to

STEWART to guarantee STEWART's fee.

that while he was in jail in Phoenix he was advised by JAMES

KANATH HOLMAN, FBI No. 1537971, to get in touch with PAUL CLINITE

of Phoenix if he desired to arrange a "fix" for CARTER's charges in

Phoenix.

T-2 stated that CARTER had subsequently contacted

CLINITE and that the price of the "fix" was originally set at

$3500.00.

The information received from Dallas T-2 was furnished

to Phoenix by Dallas on August 14, 1959, in a matter captioned

HARRY RAYMOND POPE, Aka. -FUGITIVE, ET AL, UFAP-BURGLARY; ASSAULT

WITH A DEADLY WEAPON."

POPE was formerly listed as one of the

Bureau's ten most wanted fugitives.

On September 21, 1959, the Phoenix Office furnished the

following information:

Lieutenant MARTIN PINTZ, Warrant Detail, Maricopa County

Sheriff's Office, Phoenix, on September 18, 1959, advised that he

had received a warrant from Richmona, Texas, which was to be served

in the event that subject appeared at Phoenix. He stated that in

conversations with officers at Richmond, Texas, he has been in-

formed that the subject is being charged with grand theft auto,

rather than burglary. PINTZ stated that he has no recent infor-

mation concerning the subject and is not aware of his present where-

abouts.
