peen retained as counsel for the subject, had appeared in the
Superior Court on that morning and, without forewarning, had been
confronted by the subject in company with ZUSSMAN and FRANK COOPER,
Phoenix bondsman, and had at this time been informed that his
services on behalf of the subject were no longer desired. She
stated that according to CONNORS, COOPER seemed to be directing the
subject's actions and was responsible for the change in attorneys.
She stated that CONNORS had considered his dismissal as highly
irregular, and he felt. that ZUSSMAN's action in the matter was some-
what unethical, She stated that under the circumstances however,
there was little that CONNORS could do. She advised that CONNORS
did not know just what COOPER's position was in the matter and what
could be gained by the appointment of new counsel other than time.

Phoenix T-1, who has furnished reliable information in
the past, advised that following the subject's arrest at Jackson,
Mississippi, FRED LOZANO, SR., the Dallas bondsman who held the
primary liability on the subject's Phoenix bond, had sent his son,
FRED LOZANO, JR., and a (FNU) WHITE, who transports prisoners for
bondsmen for a fee, to Jackson where they paid the subject's fine.
Phoenix T-1 stated that the subject was then forced to accompany
them to Dallas and upon arrival there, WHITE was given $400.00 for
delivery of the subject to Phoenix for surrender to the Maricopa
County Superior Court. Phoenix T-1 stated that WHITE reportedly
left Dallas with his wife and the subject on about June 17, 1959,
and their whereabouts was not again known te either LOZANO or him-
self until the subject appeared in court on June 24, 1959.

Phoenix T-1 stated that he did, however, on June 18, 1959, receive
a call from COOPER, who until this time bad no known interest in the
matter, and was informed by COOPER that neither he nor LOZANO had
need to worry about the subject's appearance in court and their
bond, since he could assure his presence on dune 24, 1959.

‘ Phoenix T-1 stated that from his conversations with
LOZANO, he feels certain that LOZANO did not know that the subject
was being turned over to COOPER, since WHITE had been specifically
ordered to surrender him to the court. He stated that he there-
fore has no knowledge of how the deal was made with COOPER to

write a new bond and obtain the services of a new attorney. He
stated that LOZANO had informed him when he had originally written
the subject's bond, that COOPER had also approached the subject

and HARRY RAYMOND POPE, who was arrested with the subject at
Phoenix, and had informed CARTER that he could get the charge against
him fixed for $5000,00. He stated that he was later informed that
the original figure had been reduced to $2500.00, but he personally
feels that COOPER has no chance to make such a "fix" in view of the
seriousness of the charges pending against both the subject and POPE.

Phoenix T-1 advised however that in spite of his feelings in the
matter, the Subject has apparently "bought" COOPER 's proposition,
He stated that COOPER to his knowledge made the new bond for the
subject without the benefit of any cosigners, and he would assume
that the subject's collateral for the bond was therefore very solid,
if not cash,

Since he was Part of a criminal Syndicate that would take care of
the fee if it was not taken care of by the subject himself,

Phoenix T-1 stated that ZUSSMAN dia not enlarge upon this statement
and he therefore had no Knowledge as to what, if any, credence
should be given to such an assertion. Phoenix T-1 Stated that the
subject to his knowledge did hot remain in the Phoenix area follow-
ing his release under his new bond, and it is his feeling that he
undoubtedly returned to Dallas,

Captain FRANK POPELLO, Maricopa County Sheriff's Office,
Phoenix, on June 25, 1959, advised that he had overheard a conver-
Sation between LOUIS ZUSSMAN and an unidentified persen in which they

On July 24, 1959, the Minneapolis Office furnished the
following information:

, inspector KRUGENE BERNATH, Hennepin County Attorney's
Office, Minneapolis, on duly 20,1959, advised SA KARL M, ZEIMES
that there was a memorandum in the JARRELL LEE CARTER file dated
June 16, 1959, reflecting CARTER was in custody at Jackson,
Mississippi.

BERNATH said that the file reflected that Detective
Captain WILLIAM MAHMKE of the Minneapolis Police Department con-
sulted with Hennepin County Attorney ARNOLD MESHBESHER. At that
time BERNATH stated that the memorandum reflects that there was
net sufficient evidence in MESHBESHER ' s opinion to extradite
CARTER, but MESHBESHER was of the opinion that if the case was
worked up further it would probably be possible to extradite CARTER.

BERNATH explained that the original warrant issued for
CARTER was a John Doe Warrant and the warrant was later ammended
to CARTER's true name.

BERNATH stated thathe will find out if the case has
been handled by the Detective Bureau of the Minneapolis Police
Department. fle said that as of July 20, 1959, the warrant out-—
standing charging CARTER with Grand Larceny, Second Degree, was still
in effect and that the detainer filed on CARTER at Phoenix was still
in force.

It should be neted that on August 12, 1959, Dallas T-2,
who has furnished reliable information in the bast, advised that one
JIMMY DOLAN, FBI No. 7332524, of Dallas, had told T-2 that he had
contacts in Minneapelis whom he Was using in an effort to have
Minneapolis authorities drop charges against CARTER or take no
action on the charges presently outstanding against CARTER, T-2
further stated that while bond arrangements were being made for
CARTER and POPE at Phoenix in November and December , 1958,. DOLAN
had told the person making the arrangements that if there were
any questions asked by the Phoenix attorney, HARRY STEWART, that
the names PAUL CLINITE and BILL SWIFT should be mentioned to
STEWART to guarantee STEWART's fee. CARTER had subsequently told T-2
that while he was in jail in Phoenix he was advised by JAMES
KANATH HOLMAN, FBI No, 1537971, to get in touch with PAUL CLINITE
of Phoenix if he desired to arrange a "fix" for CARTER’s charges in
Phoenix. T-2 stated that CARTER had subsequently contacted
CLINITE and that the price of the "£ix" was originally set at
$3500.00.

The information received from Dallas T-2 was furnished
te Phoenix by Dallas on August 14, 1959, in a matter captioned
HARRY RAYMOND POPE, Aka.-FUGITIVE, ET AL, UFAP-BURGLARY; ASSAULT
WITH A DEADLY WEAPON." POPE was formerly listed as one of the
Bureau's ten most wanted fugitives.

On September 21, 1959, the Phoenix Office furnished the
following information:

Lieutenant MARTIN PINTZ, Warrant Detail, Maricopa County
Sheriff's Office, Phoenix, on September 18, 1959, advised that he
had received a warrant from Richmond, Texas, which was to be served
in the event that subject appeared at Phoenix. He stated that in
conversations with officers at Richmond, Texas, he has been in-
formed that the Subject is being charged with grand theft auto,
rather than burglary, PINTZ stated that he has no recent infor-
mation concerning the subject and is net aware of his present where-
abouts.
