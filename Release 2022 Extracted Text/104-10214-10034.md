The assassination of the Daninican Republic's Rafael L.
‘Trujillo was carried out with assistance from the US Central
Intelligence Agency. Arms for the May 30, 1961 Slaying of the
69-year-old dictator on a lonely stretch of highvaymear nis
capital were smuggted by tne CIA into tke country at the
request of the assassins,

Toe CIA began shipping arzs to the Dosinicen Republic in
late 1960, following a series of talzs between US Consul Henry
Dearborn, Caief Polizical Officer John Parfield of the U3
Consulate, and Luis Aciama Tio. Also involved in the plot vas
Antonio Inbert, who tad been Governor of Porto Plata province.

talks continued between Dearbon, Parfield and leaders o? the
anti-Trujillo conspirecy. Tovard the end of 1960, contact vas

named Plato Cox.

U.S. policy with respect to the overtaroy of Trujillo. We also can
ascertain from the files the nature and the extent of U.S. support
of che plotters, including the passing to tiem of veapons out of the
U.S. Consulate in Ciudad Trujilic. What ve cannot discover from the
files, despite quite massive documentation, is how the coup group
was organized. The best single account ve find, and it is not wholly
accurate, is in a book by Robert Crassweller.* The main flaw in
the story is its failure to identify the individuals with whom the
U.S. Cover-ment was actually vorking. Excerpts follow:
The plot was organized on the basis of tvo groups of
conspirators linked together by a liaison that later proved

too fragile to bear the stresses laid upon it. Each group
had its purpose and its separate personnel.

The function of the Action Group was to assussinate
Trujillo and immediately present proof of its succes, in
the fora of Trujillo's corpse, to the second group, the
Political Group. ‘he latter vould then launch a coup, .
taking over the machinery of the goverment and the Armed
Forces.

The Action Group consisted of eight men. It appears to
have been Organized originally ty Generel Antonio Inbert
Barreras and Salvador Estrella. . ... . . They were joined
by Lieut. Amado Garcia Guerrero, a member of the military
corps attached to Trujillo in the National Palace; Antonio

ai-official letter from

Ambassador Farland wrote an "Officieal-Informal” memorandum

to Rubottom reporting that "the uzderground is more active today
than ever in the history of the Trujillo regine." He described the
principal opposition group es being about 2,000 strong. He said:

"s+ + within this group there is groving militant anti-
Aerican feeling based on the premise that the United States
should actively aid the Dominican revoluticnary (sic) for the
Gyerthrey of the Trujillo regize. Discussions I have heard on
tals subject show aa eppalling lack of understanding of the
position of the Unived States and its adogted doctrine of non-
intervention. . . . . . This group is in possession of
Clandestine broadcasting equipment which will go into operation
when the strike is rade. CAS has been informed and joins with
me in suggesting that you pass this information to J. C. King."
