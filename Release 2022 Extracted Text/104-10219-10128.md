Floyd felt that in erder to shc« mitual trust he nad to furnish : u
these additional names to Nicelai, Nilclait told Floyd that the
Soviets belinve they can trust him. Floyd noted that all the
materjal he had written for tal was taken by Nixolal and

Floyd felt that thts could te used in the future as a blackmail.
threat against him.

The meeting with Nikclai ended between 6:00 and 6:30

p.m, and Ployd was driven back to the border between East’ and
West Berlin.

Prior to leaving for East Berlin on the morning of

the next day Ployd considered taking some tranquilizer villa

but then rejected this because he felt their effoct might te noticed
by Nikolai. On Fonday morning, January 23, 1961, Floyd again
went to East Berlin and waa driven to the eame apartment where

he arrived about 12:00 noon. Nixolai again stressed the mitual
trust angie, pointing out that the Soviets had shown their trust
by their payments to him in the past even though very little of
the information Floyd had obtained was of value to them, Nikolai
dictated and Ployd wrote down that he could show mutual truat

by doing constructive work for the Soviets with the understanding
‘that he would be well paid for.the information he got and Ployd .
jogreed that he would extend hia efforts since the Sovists had

. ,f shown their mutual trust by their past payments to. him. Floyd:
+, eigned the ‘statement and Nikolai -took.4¢ from him,
