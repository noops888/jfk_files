CUADTRN0S ascersing the prasont stare of the Cubsn revolution,

Be personally believed that this would be a useful thing for
CUALERNOS to undertake, and at no time cecaed anxious to Limis -

im CUADERNOS, or our possible work in the Douinican Republic,
be agreed that objectivity vas the only basis upon which we
cen workend thet the open ‘epprosch wes best. X found thet
