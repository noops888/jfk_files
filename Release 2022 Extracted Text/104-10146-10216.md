Tony:

Ihave gone back and forth with Bob Blakey
on the fully and truthfully language on our general
warrant letter to Stokes. I now believe I have
taken out the worst aspect of the reference of the
word truthfully by placing the sentence in the
last paragraph, In my mind then I can tie the
language to those individuals covered by the
letter who might think that they are under a
secrecy agreement but actually are not and never
had a relationship with us. I also then see it
as the quid for the third paragraph as making
clear that individuals covered by secrecy
agreements who seek our guidance in responding
on sensitive areas will do just that and not
use this discretion to mislead, I am willing to
recommend approval on that basis if it is okay
with you.
