was not aware if the subject sent additional telegrams.

CSUKAS stated he subsequently had contacted Western Union

and he made these

The sender was shown as MARIANO TEJEDA, 1151 Southwest

11th Terrace, telephone 444-5026.

CSUKAS could not furnish any information as to

the significance of the above messages or if, in fact,

any one of them was actually written by the subject.

It is to be noted the sender of all the above

messages furnished the same telephone number and house

number, but used different names and street addresses.

Bresser's Cross Reference Telephone Directory

for Miami shows telephone number 444-5026 is actually

listed to one JULIO GUTIERREZ, retired, wife CONNIE,

1867 Southwest 17th Terrace,

Miami. A call to this

number revealed no one named

"RENE" was known there.

On February 23, 1968, MM T-3, who is identical

with the above-mentioned

source of U..S. Customs Agent

CSUKAS, furnished the following information:

MM T-3 has known EPIFANIO ROMERO DELGADO about

two years.

ROMERO has lived

I in the apartment of ADOLFO

BORGES GALINDO, 1050 Southwest First Street, Miami, for

about one year

and reportedly pays $40 per month rent to

BORGES.

ROMERO owns a 1965 black Mustang automobile and

is currently unemployed. He was previously employed as

but nor at a sure Erocery

grocery store called "Oso Blanco"

on West Flagler Street, Miami, for about two weeks prior

to his arrest on March 23, 1967, for assaulting a federal

officer.

The subject was

sentenced in early May, 196?,

to 15 months in prison and was released on parole in

August, 1967, after having served three months,

The

subject has

not been employed since his release from

prison.

MM Tw3 first began

to suspect the subject was

in contact with Cuban G-2 while he was still in prison.

In about June, 1957, MY To? observed a letter sent to

the subject from Cuba, which letter had been sent via

Costa Rica. The letter, which was unsigned, stated

- 13 =

MM 105-14883

"they" were ready to talk to the subject and requested that

he let them know where he could meet them in Florida.

The

author of the letter stated he understood the subject

could not leave the state of Florida for more than five

days because of his problem and therefore, they were ready

to meet him somewhere in Florida. MM T-2 advised the sub-

ject received this letter at the Federal Correctional

Institution, Eglin Air Force Base, Fort Walton Beach,

Florida, where he was incarcerated:

MM T-3 explained that the subject had been free

on bail while awaiting trial from March until May, 1967,

and had been unable to leave Florida during this period.

The source theorized this letter from Cuba was in

answer

to a letter written by the subject during this period.

On a later occasion, while the subject was still

in prison, MM T-3

was visiting the home of JOSE QUINTANA,

a butcher at the "Oso Blanco," who is well acquainted

with the subject.

The telephone rang and was answered

by MM T-3. The caller identified himself as "MONTES DE

OCA" and asked to soeak with EPIFANIO ROMERO. MM T-3

advised the caller ROMERO was not there, after which the

caller hung up.

After ROMERO was released from prison in about

August, 1967, according to information furnished the source

by ADOLFO BORGES, the subject began receiving regular calls

late at night from one

accordi to practo

"MONTESDE OCA" from New York. These

calls were received at the home of BORGES. BORGES indicated

to the source that he had never overheard

sations since EPIFANIO talked in private.

subject's conver

In about October, 1967, the subject made a trip

to New York over a week end, He made a second such trig

on about December 22, 1967,

and returned on December 23,

1967. In a subsequent conversation with MV T-3, the sub

ject stated he had

been in New York City. MN I-3 advised

that during early 1968, the subject had refused to accept

calls from MONTE DE OCA at the home of BORGES but follow

ing receipt of these calls, the subject drove to the

Segundo Rancho Luna Restaurant at 22nd Avenue and West

Flagler Terrace, where he waited for a call at the public

telephone booth behind this restaurant.

MM 105-14883

A few days before his trip on December 22, 1967,

the subject received $75 by money order from New York in

the mail. According to information provided by ADOLFO

BORGES, BORGES' mother was

present when the subject opened

the letter and she saw the

New York postmark, as well as

the $75 money order.

This money order was subsequently

cashed by the subject at the "Oso Blanco."

MM T-2 advised that the subject was believed to

have received another large sum of money, over $200, on

February 2, 1968.

MM T-3 advised the subject was arrested about

February 16, 1968, by the Miami

police, at which time he

was riding with his girl friend, ZETA, who is employed at

Burdine's downtown department store, at the cosmetics

counter: ROMERO was charged with drunken driving and

driving without a license and he reportedly posted $300

bond in

The source believed

that ROMERO gave the

wrong name to the police, since he

later advised JULIA

ALVAREZ, 330 Southwest 30th Avenue,

mother of another

girl friend of the subject, NILA ALVAREZ, of the fact

that

he had used another name at the time of this arrest.

MM T-3 advised that about six weeks prior to

this interview, JOSE LUIS FORNELL wrote his father from

Cuba and stated

he had been in hiding for over six months

and wanted to return to the United States. FORNELL'S

father contacted the subject and he agread to try to rescue

FORNELL. The subject thereafter met with STEVE CSUKAS,

U. S. Customs Agent, and requested his permission to travel.

to Cuba and attempt

to rescue FORNEIL. CSUKAS told him he

could not authorize such a trip and particularly, could not

authorize the departure of the subject while he was on

parole.

Regarding this proposed trip, the subject related

to MM T-3 that he bad hoped to go to Cuba and contact a

particular G-2 official with whom he was well acquainted

and to "recruit him" to work for MN T-1, the U.S. Covert

ment agency.

After this, the subject planned to return

the United

States and obtain money fron MV T-l for this

information.

According to MV I-3, the subject did not state

he had been instructed by the Cubans to do this and did not

mention any contact in connection with this plan with MARIO

ANDRES ROMERO ARIAS, JOSE BENITO CLARK SANCHEZ Or ADOLFO

BORGES GALINDO. MM T-3 stated he did not feel the subject

would confide in these three individuals because they are

violently anti-CASTRO and anti-communist.

MM T-3 further stated that although the subject

had not told him he had been instructed by the Cubans to

carry out the above-mentioned plan, it was the theory of

MM T-3 that the sukject had been so instructed.

MM T-3 advised he did not know the subject to

be a user of drugs or to be involved in the trafficking

of drugs, although he was known to be associated with

JESUS ALVAREZ, a well-known narcotics pusher.

On March 1, 1968, STEPHEN CSUKAS, U. S. Customs,

Miami, made available a copy of a Western Union money order

message received by the subject from New York. CSUKAS stated

this message had been obtained by him from a source close to

the subject on February 27, 1968. According to his source,

ROMERO received a $200 money order with this message on

February 26, 1968. The message is as follows:

"NUMBER NQB 003 10:17 A.M. EST.

TO EPIFANIA ROVERO, 1050 NW 1st

The money order paid you herewith is

and included the following message:

On March 1, 1968, PAUL NUIR, Western Union office,

Miami, advised that the number "NQB 005" is the designation

for a

Western Union branch office located

at 346 West 34th

contain an original application for a money order dated

February 26, 1968, in the amount of $200, payable to

EPIFANIO ROMERO, Apartment 3, 1050 Northwest First Street,

Miami, Florida.

The sender on the application is shown

as JULIAN MONTES, 207 West 113th Street, New York, New

York,

and the only message with the money order was "Saludos."

Western Union records also contain an original

draft, number FS 25199, dated February 26, 1968, in the

amount of $200, payable to EPIFANIA ROMERO. The original

application and draft are maintained at the Money Order

Audit Bureau.

The original application and draft, should they

be needed for prosecutive purposes, may be obtained only

upon the issuance of a subpoena duces tecum, which should

be directed to the manager of the Western Union office in

the city where prosecution is had.

MM T-4, a Cuban National who has

resided in the

United States for a number of years, and who is well

acquainted with the subject, furnished the following

information on April 4, 1968:

MM T-4 met the subject in 1964 when the subject

and informant were together in a training camp of the

Junta Revolucionaria Cubana (Cuban Revolutionary Board)

(JURE), an anti-CASTRO organization, which camp was located

near Tampa, Florida.

The subject, in about 1965, began

making "family runs" to Cuba and had no difficulty until

February, 1967, when he was arrested

and sentenced to 15

months following an altercation with U.S. Customs Agency.

The subject served three months of this 15-month sentence

and was released in about August, 1967, when he returned

to live in Miami.

According to MM T-4, the subject approached him

in December, 1967, and advised him of his contacts with

an individual in New York connected with the Cuban G-2.

According to the subject's story, this indivisual called

on numerous occasions, identifying himself first as

"JULIAN" and later as

"MONTES DE OCA." He persuaded

the subject to come to New York and sent him money for this

trip.

The first such trip to New York by the subject

of which MM T-4 was aware occurred about the end of Decem-

ber, 1967. At this time, the subject received $100 from

his New York contact and purchased a ticket to New York

in the name of ADOLFO BORGES, believed by the source to

be a friend of the subject.

Subject on this occasion was

driven to the airport by JOSE BENITO CLARK SANCHEZ, a

Cuban National and friend of the subject. ROMERO remained

in New York over a week and

and contacted MM T-4 upon his

return to Miami. ROMERO related that he had been met by

a Cuban at a designated spot in New York, after which they

had entered several taxis and a movie theater in an effort

to assure they were not being followed. VM T-4 had no

aste an a new honore had 20

details as to how they met or where they finally talked.

According to the subject, the Cuban in New York asked the

subject if he wanted to work for Cuban G-2 and the subject

gave him a noncommital reply.

ROMERO indicated to MM T-4

the Cuban G-2 official desired information concerning the

operations of MM T-1, the U.S. Government agency.

MM T-4 stated the subject's second trip to New

York was sometime in February, 1968, exact date unknown

On this occasion, ROMERO was driven to the Miami

Airport by ADOLFO BORGES and it was the informant's under-

standing that ROMERO had been sent several.

by the G-2 official in New York prior to his departure.

MM T-4 stated he had no information as to how long the

subject remained in New York on this occasion but believed

that he returned

sonetime during early March. According to

information provided by the subject to MY T-4, the subject's

New York contact identified himself on this occasion as

JESUS JIMENEZ, First Secretary of the Cuban Mission 10 the

united Nations (chund, and memoer of the Lepartamento ce

Seguridad del Estado (Cuban Department of State Security)

(DSE). He reportedly offered to send the subject to Cuba,

he would be placed in contact with DSE officials.

The subject reportedly was told he would be contacted by

telephone after his return to Miami concerning this matter.

MM T-4 stated that about a week ago, the subject

received a call from his New York Cuban contact in which

wants to make a "family run" to Cuba in effort to bring

out relatives :of

several Cuban refugees here in the

United States, none of whom are aware of his Cuban G-2

contacts.

The subject has a number of legitimate con-

tacts in New York who are interested in having their

relatives brought to the United States from Cuba and

has a number of letters in his possession from these

Cubans. He is currently attempting to locate a boat

to make this trip.

MM T-4 advised that he has

no infor-

mation and has been furnished no information by subject

to the effect

that he had been instructed by the Cubans

to "penetrate" any United States Government agency. (U.)

MM T'-4. advised he feels ROMERO holds no loyalty

for the Cuban Government or for democratic principles of

the United States Government but is an opportunist who

would work for the one who would pay him the most money.

MM T-4 also advised that he is of the opinion subject has

confided in no one except himself, MM I-4, concerning his

Cuban G-2 contacts (4)

On April 3, 1968, MM T-1 advised that the subject

had contacted this agency, exact date of contact not

revealed, and had furnished the following information: <u)

ROMERO advised MM T-1 that during November,

1967, he received a

long distance telephone call from

a man

who identified himself only as "MONTE DE ORO." This

man asked ROMERO to come to New York and "talk business"

with him. He offered to provide ROMERO with funds reces-

sary for the trip from Miami to New York.. ROVERO accepted

the offer and in late November, he received a $300 money

instructions for the trip to New York,

He

traveled by Eastern Airlines to New York and once in

He claimed he did not commit himself but asked what

answer and was told he would be advised at a later date.

During the first meeting, ROMERO was questioned about his

previous employment in the United States and about several

individuals in the Miami area.

He claimed to MM T-1 that

he denied any previous association with any United States

Government agency and denied knowing any of the individuals

named. (4)

ROMERO stated he returned to Miami after the

initial meeting and did not hear from anyone until early

February, 1968, at which time he received another long

distance

telephone call from the same individual.. He

was again instructed to travel to New York and meet with

the caller. He departed for New York on March 9, 1968.

In New York he met the same individual and was taken to

He again

claimed to have denied any association with any United

He stated it was after he was paroled

that he received his first telephone call from the Cuban

G-2 official in New York. (U)

ROMERO stated that after the second meeting

above, he decided he should speak with some United States

Government agency concerning his meetings in New York and

thus contacted MM T-1. ROMERO indicated willingness to

continue the association with Cuban G-2 and to work with

the United States Government in this matter. MM T-2

advised ROMERO was told this matter relates

responsibility of the FBI.

He was told to bring all

not as yet have a boat for the planned trip and needed

financial assistance for the purchase of a boat.. ROMERO

was advised that he would again be contacted within eight

days for further instructions and possible financial

assistance. During the course of this conversation, the

ADOLFO BORGES GALINDO, in whose apartment ROMERO is

residing, met with Agents HERBERT

of U. S. Customs on March 8, 1968. The meeting was

arranged with Customs Agents at the request of ROMERO

and the meeting concerned ROMERO's efforts to travel by

boat to Cuba..

ROMERO reportedly requested U. S. Customs'

permission to travel to Cuba to rescue a friend, JOSE LUIS

FORNELL, who is reportedly hiding in Havana.

CSUKAS stated

ROMERO's request was denied. CSUKAS also stated he felt

ROMERO's true purpose in this proposed travel to Cuba may

concern efforts to bring back the narcotic cocaine for

sale in the United States.

CSUKAS: said the subject made

no mention at this time of his plan to travel to New York

on the following date.

On March 9, 1968, MM T-3 advised the subject

planned to travel to New York on that date, using a ticket

issued in the name of JOSE A. GALINDO. The source stated

the subject would meet in New York with one JULIAN flast
