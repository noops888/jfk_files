a friend of his in hidi in Havana. This friend is JOSE

number, but used different names and street addresses.

Bresser's Cross Reference Telephone Directory
for Miami shows telephone. number 444-5026 is actually
listed to one JULIO GUTIERREZ, retired, wife CONNIE, ©
1867 Southwest 17th Terrace, Miami. A call to this
number revealed no one named "RENE" was known there.

On February 23, 1968, MM T-3, who is identical
with the above-mentioned source of U..S. Customs Agent
CSUKAS, furnished the following information:

MM T-3 has known EPIFANIO ROMERO DELGADO about
two years. ROMERO has lived in the apartment of ADOLFO
BORGES GALINDO, 1050 Southwest First Street, Miami, for
about one year and reportedly pays $40 per month rent to
BORGES. ROMERO owns a 1965 black Mustang automobile and
is currently unemployed. He was previously.employed as
a butcher at a Cuban grocery store called "Oso Blanco"
on West Flagler Street, Miami, for about two weeks prior
to his arrest on March 23, 1967, for assaulting a federal
officer. The subject was sentenced in early May, 1967,
to 15 months in prison and was released on parole in
August, 1967, after having served three months, The
Subject has not been employed since his release from
prison,

MM T-3 first began to suspect the subject was”
in contact with Cuban G-2 while he was still in prison.
In about June, 1967, MM T~2 observed a letter sent to
the subject from Cub2, which letter had been sent via
Costa Rica. The letter, which was unsigned, stated

, "they" were ready to talk to the subject and requested that

he let them know where he could meet them in Florida. The
author of the letter stated he understood the subject
could not leave the state of Florida for more than five
days because of his. problem and therefore, they were ready
to meet him somewhere in Florida. MM T-2 advised the sub-
ject received this letter at the Federal Correctional
Institution, Eglin Air Force Base, Fort Walton Beach,
Florida, where he was incarcerated.

MM T-3 explained that the subject had been free
on bail while awaiting trial from March until May, 1967,
and had been unable to leave Florida during this period.
The source theorized this letter from Cuba was in answer
to a letter written by the subject during this period.

On a later occasion, while the subject was still
in prison, MM T-3 was visiting the home of JOSE QUINTANA,
a butcher at the "Oso Blanco," who is well acquainted
with the subject, The telephone rang and was answered
by MM T-3.- The caller identified himself. as-"MONTES DE
OCA" and asked to speak with EPIFANIO ROMERO. MM. T-3
advised the caller ROMERO was not there, after which the
caller hung up.

After ROMERO was released from prison in about
August, 1967, according to information furnished the source
by ADOLFO BORGES, the subject. began receiving regular calls
late at night from one "MONTESDE OCA" from New York. Thess
calls were received at the home of BORGES. BORGES indicated
to the source that he had never overheard subject? 5s conver-
sations since EPIFANIO talked in private.

In about October, 1967, the subject made a trip
to New York over a week end. He made a second such trip
on about December 22, 1967, and returned on December 23,
1967. In a subsequent conversation with MM T+3, the sub~
ject stated he had been in New York City, “MM T-3 advised
that during early 1968, the subject had refused to accept
calls from MONTE DE OCA at the home cf BORCES but folicw-
ing receipt of these calls, the subject drove to the
Segundo Rancho Luna Restaurant zt 22nd Avenue and West
Flagler Terrace, where he waited for a call at the public
telephone booth behind this restaurant.

MM 105-14883

A few days before his trip on December 22, 1967,
the subject received $75 by money order from New York in
the mail. According to information provided by ADOLFO
BORGES, BORGES' mother was present when the subject opened
the letter and she saw the New York postmark, as well as
the $75 money order. This money order was subsequently
cashed by the subject at the "Oso Blanco."

MM T-2 advised that the subject was believed to
have received another large sum of money, over $200, on
February 2, 1968.

MM T-3 advised the subject was arrested about
February 16, 1968, by the Miami police, at which time he
was riding with his girl friend, ZETA, who is employed at
Burdine's downtown department store, at the cosmetics
counter. ROMERO was charged with drunken driving and
driving without a license and he reportedly posted $300
bond in cash. The source believed that ROMERO gave the
wrong name to the police, since he later advised JULIA
ALVAREZ, 330 Southwest 30th Avenue, mother of another
girl friend of the subject, NILA ALVAREZ, of the fact that
he had used another name at the time of this arrest.

MM T-3 advised that about six weeks prior to
this interview, JOSE LUIS FORNELL wrote his father from
Cuba and stated he had been in hiding for over six months
and wanted to return to the United States. -FORNELL's
father contacted the subject and he agreed to try to rescue
FORNELL. The subject thereafter met with STEVE CSUKAS,
U. S. Customs Agent, and requested his permission te travel
to Cuba and attempt to rescue FORNELL. CSUKAS told him he
could not authorize such a trip and particularly, could not
authorize the departure of the subject while he was on
parole,

Regarding this prooosed trip, the subject related
to MM T-3 that he had hoped to go to Cuba and centact a4
particular G-2 official with whom he was well acquainted
and to "recruit him" to work for MM T-1, the U. S. Govern-
ment agency. After this, the subject planned to return to

_ the United States and obtain money from MM T-1 for this

information. According to MM T-3, the subject did not state
he had been instructed by the Cubans to do this and did not
mention any contact in connection with this plan with MARIO
ANDRES ROMERO ARIAS, JOSE BENITO CLARK SANCHEZ or ADOLFO
BORGES GALINDO.. MM T-3 stated he did not feel the subject

‘would confide in these three individuals because they are

violently anti-CASTRO and anti-communist.

MM T-~3 further stated that although the subject
had not told him he had been instructed by the Cubans to
carry out the above-mentioned plan, it was the theory of
MM T-3 that the subject had been so instructed.

MM T-3 advised he did not know the subject to
be a user of drugs or to be involved in the trafficking
of drugs, although he was known to be associated with
JESUS ALVAREZ, a well-known narcotics pusher.

On March 1, 1968, STEPHEN CSUKAS, U. S. Customs,
Miami, made available a copy of a Western Union money order
message received by the subject from-New York. CSUKAS stated
this message had been obtained by him from a source close to
the subject on February 27, 1968. According to his source,
ROMERO received a $200 money order with this message on
February 26, 1968. The message is as follows:

"NUMBER NQB 003 10:17 A.M. EST.

MM T-4, a Cuban National who has resided in the
United States for a number of years, and who is well
acquainted with the subject, furnished the following
information on April 4, 1968:

MM T-4 met the subject in 1964 when the subject
and informant were together in a'training camp of the
Junta Revolucionaria Cubana (Cuban Revolutionary Board)
(JURE), an anti-CASTRO organization, which camp was located
near Tampa, Florida. The subject, in about 1965, began
making "family runs" to Cuba and had no difficulty until
February, .1967, when he was arrested and sentenced to 15
months following an aitercation with U. S. Customs Agency.
The subject served three months of this 15-month sentence
and was released in about August, 1967, when he returned
to live in Miami. i

According to MM T-4, the subject approached him
in December, 1967, and advised him of his contacts with
an individual in New York connected with the Cuban G-2.
According to the subject's story, this individual called
on numerous occasions, identifying himself first as
"JULIAN" and later as "MONTES DE OCA." He persuaded

-17-

MM 105-14883

the subject to come to New York and sent him money for this
trip.

The first such trip. to New York by the subject
of which MM T-4 was aware occurred.about the end of Decem-
ber, 1967. At this time, the subject received $100 from
his New York contact and purchased a ticket to New York
in the name of ADOLFO BORGES, believed by the source to
be a friend of the subject. Subject on this occasion was
driven to the airport by JOSE BENITO CLARK SANCHEZ, a
Cuban National and friend of the subject. ROMERO remained
in New York over a week end and contacted MM T-4 upon his
return to Miami. ROMERO related that he had been met by

a Cuban at a designated spot in New York, after which they

had entered several taxis and a movie theater in an effort
to assure they were not being followed. MM T-4 had no
details as to how they met or where they finally talked.
According to the subject, the Cuban in New York asked the
subject if he wanted to work for Cuban G-2 and the subject
gave him 2 noncommital reply. ROMERO indicated to MM T-4
the Cuban G-2 official desired information concerning ths
operations of MM T-1, the U. S. Government agency.

MM T-4 stated the subject's second trip to New
York was sometime in February, 1968, exact date unknown
to him. On this occasion, ROMERO was driven to the Migmi
Airport by ADOLFO BORGES and it was the informant’s under-
standing that ROMERO had been sent several hundred dollars

.by the G-2 official in New York pricr to his departure.

MM T-4 stated he had no information as to how long the
subject remained in New York on this occasion but believed
that he returned sometime during early March. According to
information provided by the subject to MM T-4, the subject's
New York contact identified himself on this occasion as
JESUS JIMENEZ, First Secretary of the Cuban Mission to the
United Nations (CMUN), and member of the Departamento de
Seguridad del Estado (Cuban Department of State Security)
(DSE). He reportedly offered to send the subject to Cuba,
where he would be placed in contact with DSE officials.

The subject reportedly was told he weuld be contacted. by
telephone after his return to Miami concerning this matter.

MM T-4 stated that about a week ago; the subject
received a call from his New York Cuban contact in which

Docld:34517392 Page 20


NW 64954

MM 105-14883

he was authorized to make the trip to Cuba. ROMERO now
wants to make a "family run" to Cuba in effort to bring
out relatives ‘of several Cuban refugees here in the
United States, none of whom are aware of his Cuban G-2
contacts. The subject has a number of legitimate con-
tacts in New York who are interested in having their
relatives brought to the United States from Cuba and

has a number of letters in his possession from these
Cubans. He is currently attempting to locate a boat

to make this trip. MM T-4 advised that he has no infor-
mation and has been furnished no information by subject
to the effect that he had been instructed by the Cubans
to "penetrate" any United States Government agency. (U)

MM T-4 advised he feels ROMERO holds no loyalty
for the Cuban Government or for democratic principles of
the United States Government but is an opportunist who
would work for the one who would pay him the most money.
MM T-4 also advised that he is of the opinion subject has
confided in no one except himself, MM T-4, concerning his
Cuban G-2 contacts {u)

On April 3, 1968, MM T~1 advised that the subject
had contacted this agency, exact date of contact not
revealed, and had furnished the following information: day

ROMERO advised MM T-1 that during November,
1967, he received a long distance telephone call from
a man who identified himself only as "MONTE DE ORO." This
man asked ROMERO to come to New York and "talk business"
with him. He offered to provide ROMERO with funds neces—
sary for the trip from Miami to New York.. ROMERO accepted
the offer and in late November; he received a $300 money
order and instructions for the trip to New York. He
traveled by Eastern Airlines to New York and once in
New York, he was instructed to proceed to 116th Street
an North River Drive in Manhattan, where he was. met by
an individual who identified himself as JULIAN HERNANDEZ
or GONZALEZ S2The individual also identified himself as
the originator of the long distance telephone call and
as a member of the DSE and CMUN.SXROMERO described the
individual as a Cuban male, 5'6", 28 to 30 years old,
hair cut short but full, eyes brown, weight 140 pcunds,
complexion light, spoke good English.

meeting, he was asked if he desired to work for the Cuban
G-2, He claimed he did not commit himself but asked what
was in it for him financially. He did not receive an
answer and was told he would be advised at a later date.
During the first meeting, ROMERO was questioned about his
previous employment in the United States and about several
individuals in the Miami area. He claimed.to MM T-1 that
he denied any previous association with any United States
Government agency and denied knowing any of the individuals
named. cu)

ROMERO stated he returned to Miami after the
initial meeting and did not hear from anyone until early

In New York he met the same individual and was taken to
a hotel, name and address unknown, ee the individual

questioned about his previous employment in the United
States.and certain persons. in the Miami area. He again
claimed to have denied any association with any United
States Government agency or acquaintance with any of the
persons named. ROMERO said he was asked if he was pre=
pared to take a trip to Cuba and meet with certain mem-
bers of Cuban G-2, possibly RAMIRO VALDES, head of Cuban
G-2. Answering in the affirmative provided the pay was
right and proper arrangements were made for the trip,
ROMERO was assured he would be contacted in the near future
concerning this matter. The meeting was terminated and
ROMERO returned to Miami on March 11, 1968. ROMERO indi-
cated he had been provided $200 for this second trip. (UW)

probation and the terms of his probation do not permit

his travel out of the state of Florida. ROMERO explained
that) he got into trouble with the U. S. Coast Guard and

U. S. Customs about. two years ago and tried to flee from
them. In the chase, shots were exchanged and ROMERO was
finally caught. He was later convicted and sentenced tc
two years in the penitentiary but was paroled after having
served three months. He stated it was after he was paroled
that he received his first telephone call from the Cuban
G-2 official in New York. (u)

ROMERO stated that after the second meeting
above, he decided he should speak with some United States
Government agency concerning his meetings in New York and
thus contacted MM T-1. ROMERO indicated willingness to
continue the association with Cuban G-2 and ‘to work with
the United States Government in this matter. MM T-2
advised ROMERO was told this matter relates to the
internal security of the United States and is the
responsibility of the FBI. He was told to bring all
the information available to him in this matter to the
immediate attention of the FBI and further contact with
MM T-1 was discouraged. (UD

MM T-1 further advised on April 3, 1968, that
on March 22, 1968, ROMERO contacted MM T-1 by telephone
and disclosed the following information:(\)

ROMERO advised that on March 20, 1968, he received
a long distance telephone call from his Cuban G-2 contact
in New York. The caller inquired if ROMERO was ready to
make a trip to Cuba and ROMERO advised the caller he did
not as yet have a boat for the planned trip and needed
financial assistance for the purchase of a boat. ROMERO
was advised that he would again be contacted within eight
days for further instructions and possible financial
assistance. During the course of this conversation, the
caller informed ROMERO that the stage was set for him in
Cuba and provided a telephone number and name for ROMERO

be back im Cuba. We emphasized that he plammed all along
to report to the U. S. authorities amd he believes this. is
an excellemt opportunity for the U. S. Government to pene-
trate the Cuban Imtelligemce Service. He said he is willing
