to get information concerning a "hot team." He said subject

also inquires of the line of him.

MALLARD advised also that in the past few months

he has called the subject, and these calls primarily were with

regard to a "heist" of MALLARD's poker game in Austin several

months ago.

He advised that subject was attempting to assist

him in determining the identities of the perpetrators of the

heist.

MALLARD advised that he has known subject only for

about one year; however, he is acquainted with people who have
