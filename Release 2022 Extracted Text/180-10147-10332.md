z 3 i It seemed to me that lack of notification of a surprise witness
a 3 of this sort changed the whole context of what I regard this
z 10 inquiry to be. Therefore, having had the experience with the
5 1; | Church Committee and not having had counsel in giving deposi- ;

tions and all of that and not having the right of discovery

|, during the course of the Church Committee hearings you might

say I learned a lesson.

Miss Brady. Your comments will be noted in the record.

Mr. Angleton, at this time; are you under any restriction

er privilege that would prevent you. from answering all ques-

12 | tions fully and accurately and without any intent to withhold

19 | information?

20 Mr. Angleton. As far as I know, if I understand the

<
é

correspondence between the Chairman of the Committee and

Admiral Turner, CIA, there are no restrictions although the ;
i cover letter signed by the Deputy Director Carlucci stated
i if I had any question I-was to refer them to Mr. Breckinridge.

Mr. Angleton. He was a part of the American delegation.
You mean the person being the American diplomat? He was a

member of the American delegation to the UN Conference or

whatever it was.

Miss Brady. In Geneva? i
Mr. Agleton. In Geneva.
Miss Brady. When did word of Nosenko's first contact

first reach the Counterintelligence Staff at Headquarters?

Mr. Angleton. Almost immediately.

to as "X". But in short, we did not have jurisdiction over
Nosenko, then or any other time.

Miss Brady. What role were you playina? WEre you in a
consulting role at that time? How was information about the
case disseminated to you individually?

Mr. Angleton. It was not unusual in cases that dealt
with Soviet intelligence that copies of the telegram would be
sent to us automatically.

Miss Brady. What action was taken by the Agency after
Nosenko was first contacted?

Mr. Angleton. There was no action taken. There was
great excitement. The first thing that one does in those
cases is to begin to run tracers against the registry and
files to see if there is any previous! knowledge of the indi-

vidual.

in terms of file and tracers.

i

Miss Brady. What significant information was provided by.

Nosenko at that time of the first contact?
Mr. Angleton. I have not seen those telegrams, I might

add, for several years but one of the more astonishing pieces

| o£ information which he gave was to the effect that a Soviet

by the name of Belitsky, who was in contact with the Agency

was in fact a plant. He gave the name of our case officers

| quite accurately who were handling Blitsky. He stated that

Belitsky was an agent of the Department of Disinformation.
Miss Brady. Within the KGB?
Mr. Angleton. Within the KGB.
Miss Brady. Was that the first allegation you had of a

|

serious Soviet penetration by the KGB?
i i
Mr. Angleton. From whom? I am afraid I don't understand,

your question.
Miss Brady. Was that the first information you had had |

either through your own intelligence or through any other

Soviet defector of a possible serious Soviet penetration?

Mr. Angleton. We had had hundreds of them, allegations.

Miss Brady. How would you characterize this allegation

by Nosenko. Was it more serious? Was it more substantive?

Mr. Angleton. The facts were, to explain this -- it is

a complex case, as you will find out all of these cases are,

they cannot be simply explained in a few words -- Belitsky

was a person connected with the media in the Soviet Union who.
: i
traveled extensively in the West and who had in fact attempted,
in our view to be recruited by another allied intelligence :

{
service. Eventually he fell into the hands of the CIA or the i
: i
Soviet Division who believed that they had made a-firm recruit

ment of this individual and therefore, for a great period of

| time, I don't know how many years, they were in fact running

| him as an agent.

He would travel to and from Moscow to the West. Therefore,

ee

from that point of view, to have it declared that their

ry

case officers whose names were given accurately by Nosenko,

rm

were in contact with a control agent of the KGB, particularly

the Department of Disinformation, they regarded that as an

ra

3

: Al Mr. Angleton. I am talking about Counterintelligence.

2 ea We found that the Foreign Service, whose favor Belitsky

3 i

7 nd had curried at one time, had put him under surveillance and

7 i i

¢ 2 | a number of other things while he was in their capitol. They
came to the conclusion that he was in fact what we would call |

coat dragging, he was trying to be recruited. Therefore,

that he was a suspected plant. So that was found in the files).

Sou,

Second, we had information -- I will put it another way
E 18 | -- when we had "X" in a safe house there was some kind of :
Z | entry made into his personal papers and we found, not the
€ 39 | Counterintelligence but either the Office of Security or the
i

Soviet Division found, on some notes that he had made

apparently he was jotting down things to talk about -- and on

that he had the name Belitsky; in other words, the files showed

that had any analyst gone to Belitsky and so on that this was

not startling news becasue here was, number one, a Foreign

we

3H At the same time, we had in our possesion information |

from "X" chat Blitsky was a plant.

&

Miss Brady. Based on that information, what conclusions |

3 5

G ra were you able to draw from Nosenko in terms of his giving this

3 =| information as a startling revelation?

z Mr. Angleton. We drew no conclusions. I gave you only

€

5 one piece of information that I can recall. It stands out |

ie 10 | because he also gave, I believe, the alias of Belitsky.

3 i

g nl Now, I would like to have seen the telegrams that came in at

g al that period because when he had met our people there, Bagley

i | |

3 iW | and whoever it was, he had made the statement that he would
a 3 ta i only give them three or four pieces of information in return

E i for about $200 or so, and that was. a one time affair. That |

S i

3 1g | was his original approach; and he needed that money in order

= 7 | to make up for a deficit of what he had been using in drinking.

13 | So, he gave other pieces of information, which may come

1

\

| back to my memory, but at the moment, as I recall, they were

4 i
|

|

|

i

not the most startling in the world. Nevertheless, that is not
\

the basic point. The basic point was that the information

which I have just. described on Belitsky would have made an
enormous impact on someone in Bagley's position if he was
unaware of the file checks.

Miss Brady. .You have mentioned the testimony of John

por

| Hart. I take it therefore you are familiar with the transcript

AT of that testimony?

| i

3 i Mr. Angleton. I am indeed. :

e | Miss Brady. Are you also familiar with Mr. Hart's alle- i
z gations or assertions that at the time of Nosenko's first
: | interviews in Geneva, in an effort to sooth himself and calm H
7 , | himself he had been drinking heavily and admitted later to |
z z | case officers he was drunk in the earlier interrgation? |
7 5 Mr. Angleton. I am familiar with it and I pceree | it i
: 7 i as part and parcel of the Hart myth.
3 | Miss Brady. What other information do you have on that :
2 ” i bearing on what the condition of Hart was at the time of the
Z 1 first interviews? i
ib 7 te i Mr. Angleton. I happen to know that there was some
: drinking being done. My own feeling is that the CIA people '

z wees doing as much, if not more; drinking than Nosenko.

E Miss Brady. Were there ever any reports, telegrams or :
E i

other type of information from those persons interviewing

him that he was in fact drunk.

Mr. Angleton. There may have been some description, :

'

| oprational description, that he had been in some bars or

| something of that sort. There may have been. You see, I have,
| to say to you that for many years, after I left the Agency, I
i have not left Counterintelligence. $0, I see my friends and
iwe still go over a lot of the same points and so on because we

er



12

have this unhappy choice of leadership in the Counterintelli-
gence and in the Agency.

So that when I make some of these comments they are com-
ments that may not have been known to me at the time of my
activity but which I have learned subsequently.

Miss Brady. Is your lasting impression of Nosenko's firs
contact that he was unstable or in any way unable to give

accurate information?

20024 (202) $54-23u5

ligence you don't draw any kind of inference at all. Conclu-
sions are the last thing you make based on a one time walk-in
who is only asking for $200.

There is a certain unreal air, to begin with, that a man

ts i whosesfather was a Minister of the Soviet. Union, to whom they

i had exected a statue as a hero of the Soviet Union, would have

9 | In other words, there is an unreal aspeet to that which
€ 20 | as illogical because he knows the trade, he could have asked

if he liked to drink and have girlfriends and all that type

! of thing, the thing simply doesn't jibe.

Miss Brady. What other factors about the circumstancds

‘ of his contact would you say had an air of unreality?

for several thousands. of dollars for one piece of information,

Mr. Angleton. If you have been 31 years in Counterintel-.

| Mr. Angleton. Because he alleged to be from the Second

Chief Directorate and the primary concerns of the Second Chief

n

i

i}
q
21 Directorate of the KGB are domestic, the same as the FBI.

Therefore, if he was going to be in Geneva it was illogical

up to a certain extent‘ because there is what is called the

on

"SK" ox the security part of the First Chief Directorate, CIA

part, who would normally be occupying that position.

Miss Brady. At that time was Nosenko challenged or

questioned about any of these circumstances about his contact?

Mr. Angleton. I think in all honesty that Pete Bagley

and to offer him all kinds of inducements so that there would

be a permanent relationship.

a ' But in this sense it stood to wason that if a man was

would have leverage over him in the ultimate if you desired i

Miss Brady. Was Bagley the case officer assigned to

Mr. Angleton. He was stationed in Switzerland and he was:

Mr. Angleton. I don't know whether he depended directly

on them or whehher he dependhd on the Western European Divi-

believed in using "litmus paper", in other words, having a

So that in the course of elicitation that thing is exposed

to an individual and he is unaware of the fact that we do know
the whole story, say, on that particular matter. i
Now, if he is in a position where he had had access and |!

that the person that he pointed out was a person who had been dn

was true because among the information that "X" had given us, |

went to his Soviet control and the Soviets kidnapped this indi+

i
Far East Desk handling that case. So we are dealing with an
expert therefore on what you do when you have defectors.

So, Golitzen told us that the first stage would be that
everything would be dropped to do a damage report, namely he :
, was 16 years in KGB, he had many jobs, it would be laborious, ;

; they would have to go through all the materials that he could

possibly have had access to.

Now it is not as difficult for KGB to make a damage

report as it would be in the United States Government.
Miss Brady. Why is that? :

ail Mr. Angleton. Because the controls over information

e

and the controls on access and all of that are so rigorous

that if a man saw a file there have to be signatures, and time

out and time in, and so on and files do not float around and they

i don't use Xerox machines, and I can go on and on. i

|

Compartmentation is the key to their security. Therefore,
1

20024 (202) S54-23n5

in making the damage :report their first concern would be to pro-
tect agents and to get at those matters where they knew that ne

would also know from the damage report there were things that

mercenary and he threatened us that if we did anything about |
Sasha, the Central -Committee had already approved a plan of
great retaliation, propagandawise and so on against the Boeaegt
and the country.

Miss Brady. Was that the reason for the inaction in the

Sasha case, that he was merely allowed to resign?

Mr. Angleton. Oh, no. This is after he had already i

He went on to say that they had 29 volumes of Sasha's
reports to them while working for us and all this material

was the:ammunition that would bé used in the event that Sasha

was hurt.

Now, the reason I explain this to you is that having

represented for. 31 years probably the most distinguished group '

working

of loyal people that I have ever known and the most hard

people, to have the Agency send as a representative of the

Agency an individual of Hart's character and inexpertise beford

that Committee to take up a case of this magnitude and to listen

allegation being investigated at the time of Nosenko's either

Nosenko said we were to look into one part of the embassy and |

Mr. Angleton. No. :

Miss Brady. Was that normal?

i

Mr, Angleton. Yes, because he said that he would not

and controls which they had in Russia. Therefore, he would

not risk his life in trying to communicate and we should not

try to communicate with him.

Miss Brady. Whom did he contact finally when he made the

actual defection in '64 and where did the contact take place?

In other words, Andropov, the-Chairman of State security, |

talking about the fact that he didn't know about certain things,

his things, that were unaware of this or unaware of that or

unaware of the other. Therefore, he )puts it in a prejorative

sense, that there were very few people who knew.

"knowledge," because an intelligence service has only one

other words, it is because of compartmentation that we didn't

But because Golitzen had made up his mind to defect many |

i knowing an agent in place trying to bring down their compart- |

mentation, therefore he got himself into positions which per-

‘mitted him to break down their compartmentation into fields

where they weren't realizing that he was doing this for' the
purpose of acquiring vast knowledge in other fields which were

not his duties, and amongst. those:was attending the higher

1 counterintelligence school where visiting KGB people would

1
. ; come in to speak and talk about their operations. |
é é Reading all of the KGB training books, knowing how those |
g 7 | training books were -- for example, a case would be given there,
g 2 | they would change the name of the locus of the operation, but

so and so, released by so and so, that that man was in the

occur in Turkey, as it was so stated in the training lectures,

| But was handled in Scandinavia or in West Berlin, by knowing 5

i the case officers, et cetera, were who approved that being {

submitted to the training school.
So that compartmentation was in the line of authority of

| the Director. It was not something which the CIA staff imposed.

i It was not. something that people without authority imposed. It

was the approved handling of the Directorship and the leader-

ship of the Agency and it is based on the need to know prin-

ciple in which you do not bring people in who have nothing

to contribute to the case. It is not a matter of cocktail

talk or what not. It is compartmented and it is compartmented |

hopefully in a way that if there is a leak at least you have a:

bigger list of people you know for your investigative leads.

In other words, if Golitzen gave a highly sensitive piece |

|
of information and there was evidence that that information fell

e

in the hands of the opposition, then we would be in a position |

7 s i to know that these are the X number of people alone who had
8 é acess to that information as a basis for a leakage or whatever j
3 7 ; it may be. So that I simply state that when I mentioned earligr

ie : j further and state that in my dealings with Colby and the first |
ue dealings when he took over as the Deputy Director of the Clan-

Happening, But this was the real world. It is the real

iIt was not a world which we created. In other words, we had

the first major defector in the West who was Gouzenko who

out with him when he’ defected, which lead to the huge atomic

I

espionage going on in Canada and the U.S. He was a code clerk

and he had that kind of access. That was the number one magic

a

eye opener to Western counterintelligence in the largest sense

«

of the word.

The second major defector was Petrov who was Chief of the

KGB in Australia, and his wife who was a code clerk in the

KGB and who had been in many stations. He defected. to the

ae,

So that, in other words, this is the world that spec-

lialists in counterintelligence live in which is the factual
world of what they do. So we are not dealing with Nosenko as
isome abnormality in the thing. It was simply a part of the
‘continuum which we had seen all the manifestations of during
‘

: {World War II when we were in counterintelligence working
against the Germans. We began to bump into the Soviets right
and left working against us.

In other words, we did not create a cold war or have a
paranoid attitude about the Soviets. They taught us. In other

ords, they did it by kidnapping people, by murdering people,

iby shooting down our aircraft as they did over Yugoslvaia and

ot giving up the bodies until Truman gave them an ultimatum

In other words, what I am trying to say is that there is

an attitude in the Agency that there is no regime and there-

i
start fresh again. But you can't undo all the cases of the con-

i
i

tinuum of penetration and of everything that has been going on

f

i
, from the days of Lenin. These cases keep going on.

i

I will give one example which I think is a very simply-
minded one but one that is true and which is illustrative of the
problem with Nosenko. Again it is illustrative of the Agency'd
inability and the Directorship over there to understand what
| intelligence and counterintelligence is all about.

:

Now during the war there emerged a General Turkul. General

Turkul had been a White Russian general who after the revolutidn

itary man, I think among other things he helped restore King

Zog to the throne in Bulgaria. He established a residence in

Istanbul and he became sort of a magnet for WhiteRussian or

i
janti-Soviets, He was I believe in the cavalry and he was very |

prominent and what not and he became quite a personality in hig
i |

own right. He made contact with the Fascists and with the 1
i i

German general staff and gave such high grade information

| regarding the Red Army that he was being paid fantastic sums

igence. Now his cover story or legend -- and keep in mind

| the highlights of it -- his cover story or his legend was that’
{ i

he had a network of agents throughout the Red military, through-

out the Red Army, and that the Chieff of the Signal Corps of |

the Red Army was his agent and that this network reported

|
H through well-handled cells, well compartmented cells, up to |

3 So. that the head of the Signal Corps, who also ran the school

Miss Brady. What was his status in the United States? '

Mr. Angleton. He had relatives and he just emerged and

4 Miss Brady. We-s the Turkul case and the Nosenko case

the two most obvious cases that were split on the bona fides

issues? Had other cases been significantly split within the |

ShN- 208

é || Agency than those two? :

Mr. Angleton. In the Agency there were practically few

4 (202)
~

; people who were involv-d in Turkul unless they were in oss

although later on we had people in Germany working still on

the turkul case when we became CIA. The point I am trying to |
say is that here you take all the years that Orlov told Rocca 1
2 1 you have to keep in mind this is going back and recreating
from the revolution all the way through NKVD, OGPU, all the |

i rest of it, building up machine computerized records of every |

a
iat

single Soviet case from the day of Lenin so that you would have

4 | a data base where you understood comprehensively all of the

activities, organizations, changes in modus operandi and so on.
|

In the course of all of this he took up the Turkul matte:

and Orlov read the critical fact which was that a man by the i
| name of Katz Nelson who was under Dzerzhinsky around 1934 cane!
| to Paris, I believe it was Paris, and one of the purposes of
| his trip was to meet with Turkul, Now Matz Nelson was the !

was the one who warned Orlov of the forthcoming purges and that

many attempts by, I think it was Jassov, head of the Service,

loyal to him, told him there was another member in the mission '
of the NKVD who was there unbeknownst to Orlov and probably for

purposes of assassinating him because of the fact that he had |

put off any recall to Moscow.

of this.

Miss Brady. Yes.

Mr. Angleton. I just want to repeat it because I am H

; my own view are more properly the field of the Senate Intelli-|

gence Committee rather than the Assassination Committee. But
had anyone patiently worked with Orlov, and I might add in

this respect that the Agency once contacted him and the

Division tried to have a contact with him and it fizzled out. |

It was only when Mr. Allen Dulles was writing his hook on the

the book in different ways -- and Mr. Dulles wrote a fine

tribute to General Orlov's book and so on.
One day Mr. Dulles called me to tell me that the Orlovs |

| were-in town and a General Orlov had called him to thank him
for the fine tribute, that he had invited him to dinner. Mr. |
Dulles was no longer Director or anything. He asked me whether

é Mr. Angleton. We were following up traces. Let me put

it this way. Much was made of the fact that out of X numbers

of days of incarceration he was only interrogated X number

1 of days. I worked it out that every three and a quarter days

fe was seen. Now let us logically look at it. The people i]

who would do the interrogation are people who also have other

Number two, they have to take the product of that interro-
gation back to headquarters from a distant location and do all
the research. and analysis and traces and dossiers on what has
been provided during that day's interrogation. :

I can assure you, having don this many times, myself, with

other defectors, having to travel to New York and spending

to get all the details out. It is only after you analyze all
@ 24 that that you see that you still don't have anything on which i

3 i you can break him. The fact that there was no telegram, the

fact that his rank might be wrong, or you can take all the

a

i
my attitude was that these were fundamental contradictions i

TESTIMONY OF JAMES ANGLETON RESUMED
Mr. Goldsmith. Dib the CIA conduct an investigation
into the assassination of President Kennedy?

Mr. Angleton. There was never any formal investigation

as such in the sense that there was never any thing like an
inspector general thing or task force.

Mr. Goldsmith. How would you characterize the responsi-
bility of the Agency vis-a-vis*the work of the Warren Commis-

sion?

Mr. Angleton. I think when the assassination occurred

the Agency had even been confronted with the assassination of

happened in the Agency always had some precedent. In this
area, there was complete chaos, so.to speak. So, the original
i

jurisdiction of course, devolved on the Bureau, the FBI.

When the Commission was set up I think it took it a long

time to get to focus: as such. In other words, I don't think

the community as a whole -- I mean Johnson in forming the H

Commission, obviously there was advice from a lot.of people --

my view is that he just simply hit on the Commission idea ~ i

characterize the role of the Agency vis-a-vis the work of the.

warren Commission?

Mr. Angleton. JI think it went through a metamorphosis
in the beginning. You had the Director, who was a very close
social and personal friend of the President and therefore dn
a sense he wasn't just the Director of Central Intelligence,
he was also a very close personal friend. So that I think he
had broad views on it htat went beyond the Agency and I think
his Agency responsibilities.

I think that the metamorphosized into a thing where it
began to focus more on it as an agency would facing any
problem, In the beginning you had the Director, you had
the Deputy Director, you had case officers» you had division
chiefs, all seeing the Warren Commission independently. You
had FBI liaisoning at many different levels.. We had liaison
offices. That would be the normal way of approaching any
kind of business.

In a sense, it took some time to get this thing to focus.
There was some control of knowing what different elements in
the Agencywere capable of doing or knew or whatnot.

Mr. Goldsmith. How long did it take to get focused so

there was an effective team of some kind at the Agency provid-

| ing the Warren Commission on a regular basis with information?

Mr, Angleton. I can't give you a time factor. I know,

and this is only memory without having seen any papers, from

the responsibility on to Rocca to the point of the legwork

18 The normal course of events, if he was going to go, if th

|| would normally be that he would be on the phone to me about it
and we would confer. He was given a lot of latitude. But I
have to explain something here.

Mr. Goldsmith. Please do.

Mr. Angleton. Our main concern -- when I say concern, I

don't mean it in the sense of importance or anything, but at
that time we were in the middle of the day of the assassina-

tion, I can recall it very distinctly, there was a high

before and had presented a letter of complaint to Mr. McCone

z || xvegarding an allegation as to one of his service's number two

man, a Soviet suspect. So he had come with this letter from

the Chief of that service to register this complaint.
If I recall corectly, he had lunch with the Director

* and then he was to meet with me and my Deputy. Now, this was

one of those ball-ups of an individual from that country, our

oe

representative, who had been back and had been privately

of him, in short.

primary concerns of Counterintelligence. So it was running in

In the meantime, the Western Hemisphere Division was

Mr. Goldsmith. I understand that you were working in the
context of a crisis situation by virtue of the facts that you
made.reference to. In light of that understanding, however,
my question is what responsibilities did you have with regard

to the work that the Agency was performing to assist the ©

Warren Commission?

Mr. Angleton. I didn't have and specific responsibility.

Mr. Goldsmith. The CI Staff became a point of record?

Mr. Angleton. That is right.

Mr. Goldsmith. You were head of the CI Staff?

Mr. Angleton. But that does not follow in that strict
sense, The Director could call or anyone could call Rocca
without reference to me. In other words, it*was a very
special situation. He was doing a job of common concern.

Mr. Goldsmith. To what extent did you get involved in

i

i

the work of the Agency? t
Mr. Angleton. I got very much involved in the immediate
question, having been 31 years in the business and probably

as much knowledge as anybody about the Soviet assassinations,

Mr. Goldsmith. Did he keep you apprised of the key

developments in the Kennedy case so far as the Agency was

Mr. Angleton. I think it was to be at least deposited

Mr. Goldsmith. Why was that?

Mx. Angleton. I am talking about the regular counter-
intelligence liaison. being centered in the Counterintelligence)

Staff.

Mr. Goldsmith. If I understand you correct, what you
are saying is that the CI Staff essentially was responsible
for liaison witht with the FBI. For that reason, you would

have wanted to be kept informed?

Mr. Angleton. That is right. Simply that my experience

NW 50955 DocId:32263411 Page 88


D.C, 20024 (202) S$54-2345

84

with liaison is that when you speak with him voices to an
organization you are bound to have misunderstandings. In
other words, if you have people who have never dealt with the
FBI, there is a art of dealing with any interagency or
investigative group, you know -- but Whitten was very promi-
nent because obviously the trip to Mexico and the telegrams
were coming in to SH Division as the action division.

Mr. Goldsmith. By Mexico you are referring to Oswald's
trip?

Mr. Angleton. Yes. The cable when it comes in has in
the upper left hand corner a place where it says "action".
It will designate the component. Then it will have another
line which shows dissemination. So that action would be
WH Division unless it was the Deputy Director himself who

on that cable at the designated point. Dissemination showed
everybody else who had a collateral interest of some sort.

All of a sudden you might see somebody on there that you
wondered why he was on it. Something like that might arounse
the question, why has the cable gone here, there and so on.

hard on that AP story that came out about Castro's warning
about attempted assassinations against him.

Mr. Goldsmith. When did you first learn of the anti-

Mr. Angleton. I had wind of something from time to time |
| but never one I didn't stick my nose into in the sense that

Mr. Goldsmith. When did you learn that?

Mr. Angleton. I learned that, and I can't give you a

date but it is obviously in the record someplace, I learned

it because the FBI lisison fellow was at my house one evening

when the Bureau was frantically trying to get hold of him.

Mr. Goldsmith. Can you think of any good reason for not

giving that information to the Warren Commission?
1

Mr. Angleton. What puzzles me is whether even if they had

that, whether they would have seen its significance. In other
words, I even wonder whether people in the Agency understood
the significance of what that assassination business meant. i

I think we would have seen it. probably more sharply. {

Mr. Goldsmith. By "we" you are referring to the CI i

Mr. Goldsmith. Do you think that the Cuban aspect of the,
assassination was thoroughly and adequately investigated by the

Agency and by the Warren Commission?

Mr. Angleton. No. I personally believe that the United
States intelligence services did not have tne capabilities to

ever come to an adjudication. I don't think the capabilities

penetration of the Austrian security service. It was a posi- |
tive type of allegation from a high grade source. So Stern
Magsen sent all kinds of people down there. They printed

and everybody reprinted the fact that the official finding
was food poisoning. Even the Vienna Institute of Forensic
Medicine, which is one of the most famous ones in the world,

supported the statement.

Some years later, we had another Hungarian defector. The
\
moment he got off the plane I got hold of him. I met him out |

I
in a safe house and one of the first things I hit him with was

about Lapusnyik. He gave the story that he nad access to that

file, that that file was in the custody of the Chief of

Ministry of the Interior and so on, and he explained in detail
1
that he had access ot it and they did not nave the means of
conducting an assassination but the Czechs had the agent and
the @zéchs were the ones-who'did the assassination. That was
on the eve of.the man: coming to the United states.

i Mr. Goldsmith. Turning to another area now, to what

7 ; Mr. Angleton. By quality what do you mean?

g I.don't know. I know that, my view is that no piece of infor-

5 Mr. Goldsmith. Do you know if in fact that was the
: 13 Agency's position that when information touching on sensitive |
7 1g sources and methods was involved it would be sanitized at least
. to those sensitive aspects and then given to the Warren

Commission?

Mr. Angleton. I don't know. What i am trying to say is

that I can see the Chief of the Division or somebody if

eo

with them. My personal view is that if we ever had information

supersede’all sources and methods.

would not have had an understanding. They were not on the

a

98

concerning whether he represented the interest of the Agency

on the Warren Commission?

Mr. Angleton. Explain that to me.

Mr. Goldsmith. For example, there would have been areas

that the Warren Commission and the Agency may have been some-

what at odds. One area that comes to minu is in the Nosenko

area where the Agency may have had a preference for having thej
|

Warren Commission not treat the Nosenko issue at all whereas

the Warren Commission may have wanted to deal with that issue

in some way. That would be a case where the Agency's interest

would be at stake.

|
My question is, do you know whether in a case of that kind

: i
Mr. Dulles would have made an effort to represent the Agency's |

position to the Warren Commission?

Mr. Angleton. No, I don't think so. I think that you

i
1
|

| have to first keep in mind that Dulles was oretty much his own,

man. He was an attorney with Sullivan and Cromwell. He was

about as independent a man as I know when it came to questions.
of his personal integrity. He wasn't a person who tried to
compromise a lot of things, if I can put it that way.

When it got down to something as serious as going on the

Commission he did not give the President an answer right away. |
1 In other words, he raised with the President, according to what
| he told me, because he called me the very day he got back from

| whereever he was up in New York and had received a call from



255
99

; | the President, and he recounted to me the fact that he had
2 | raised all these conflicts, possible conflicts, in the public
eye if he took that job. |

We kicked that around as to the pros and cons. I knew i

a

2 3 | he wanted the job. Like anyone in retirement this was a |
a \ i H
& 3 challenge to him and so on. But I think by way of character ,
5 7 | there would be no loyalties to the Agency or anybody else |
z a | superseding his mandate from the President. |
: $ i Mr. Goldsmith. Let me who you a document that corre- i
a 4 }
i 10 sponds with JFK Exhibit F-529 at the Committee's final hearings
5 i 7
g Il This document actually is one that we reviewed that was the
i 2 | basis for the question that I just asked you. I would ask you
a : a i to skim two paragraphs. Read the third one and the fourth
5 4 | a bit more carefully and then we will talk about it.

Mr. Angleton. I don't think that necessarily changes :
anything that I said. What I am trying to say is that I am
certain if he believed that this was a proper course on it»

and the doubts on Nosenko were expressed, whether it was the

Bureau talking to him or anybody else talking to him, that he

would still be persuaded by the facts, not by the fact that

1
it was the Agency. i
Mr. Goldsmith. The third paragraph there simply suggests:
! the possibility that Mr. Dulles was attempting to represent

| the interest of the Agency and the.Committee was concerned

| with (a), whether that. was more than just a possibility,

NW 50955 Docld:32263411 Page 104 ana


100

whether it was a fact, and (b), to what extent that was preva-.

lent? . i
i
{ Mr. Angleton. I will say this. If there was anything inj

that memorandum that he regarded as being detrimental to the |

unaware of the meeting that is being referred to here but I

itis Commission's work, my view is that there would have been an
i 6 explosion and he would have exploded.
3 7 Mr. Goldsmith. By that you mean then that he would be |
& z | giving priority to the work of the Commission rather than to
5 | the Agency?
: 10 Mr. Angleton. And I think in there he is giving priority,
3 i i
e nH to the Commission. Wheaver briefing he received -- I was |

am just saying that he was obviously persuaded, if there were

Mr. Goldsmith. Do you know whether Mr. Dulles had any
special arrangement with Mr. Helms? :

Mr. Angleton. No. I was never present with both of them
i

together. I don't know the content of any of their meetings

so far as I can recall. |

Mr. Goldsmith. What role did the Mexico City station

have in the Agency's investigative effort?
\

4 Mr. Angleton. It had a very important role for two

reasons. One, Win Scott was the Chief of the Mission down
there, was pwerhaps one of the more capable officers we had.
He had been in the FBI. He was a very highly intelligent man.

He had assets, to wit, the overage, sources. If you had to

grade stations across the board in terms of different kinds of

coverage or assets or agents or whatnot, I would give him a

very high batting average. He was a real professional.

Further, he had an excellent relationship with the FBI
which had a huge station down there, and I would say a lesser
man would not have been on speaking terms with them because
they had once owned the Western Hemisphere in terms of juris-

{
!
{
diction and it was with some reluctance, so to speak, that they

i

' transferred it to CIA. So he was highly regarded by the FBI
it people. That was-by force of his own personality.

Mr. Goldsmith. The Mexico City Station had a major role?
Mr. Angleton. Yes.

Mr. Goldsmith. I take it one reason is because Oswald
rc

had visited Mexico City?

Mr. Angleton. That is right.

Mr. Goldsmith. Did you review the cable traffic that

would telephone him directly.

Mr. Goldsmith. I take it after Mr. Helms'c order that the

| CI Staff would have been on the dissemination.

w

1 Mr. Angleton. We probably would have been. You see,

every station chief had the privilege of what is called “eyes |

a

on cable" in different categories of dissemination that cable
people only follow what the code word is. They don't know

“about Mr, Helms' order in that sense.

Mr. Goldsmith. You indicated that the cables were |

contentious. .Was there any conflict apparent in those cables

between Mexico City station and headquarters?

g 2 overdoing it but I can remember somebody saying, "have you |
Z id done this or that?" Or demanding that you send it up here

Mr. Angleton. It was very rare. i
Mr. Goldsmith. Did you ever communicate with them tele- i
{
phonically relative to the assassination?
Mr. Angleton. I don't think so, no. I mean, I wouldn't
have the right to. |
Mr. Goldsmith. Did the Mexico City station have any
: 1
surveillance operations in effect in 1963 against Soviet and f
Cuban Embassies and Consulates?
Mr. Angleton. Yes.
Mr. Goldsmith. Was information regarding Oswald obtained
as a result of these operations?

Mr. Angleton. Yes.

Mr. Goldsmith. Do you know what information was obtained?

Mr. Angleton. Unless I saw the cables I could not tell H
|
you precisely what was obtained. I know that there was infor-;

mation about his. going into the Soviet Embassy. In other
words, there was both telephonic and other surveillance of somb
|
sort.

| question about whether to. blackout the background behind

i :

Mr. Goldsmith. Your answer is that you do not know

whether or not the Warren Commission was told specifically

about the surveillance operation? |
Mr. Angleton. No. My feeling is that they must have

Mr. Goldsmith. The next paragraph makes reference to
background information concerning Oswald's defection. Would
i
that have escalated the significance of his contacts with the
Soviets in Mexico City, in your opinion?
Mr. Angleton. Let me see that again. I think that would

be a solid trace. In other words, it would be from Scott's

i
i
|
point of view a matter of considerable interest. |
Mr. Goldsmith. Why is that?
i
Mr. Angleton. Because it does not read like a lot of
third hand information. It looks like it is pretty solid
information. It is not a lot of allegations and so on.
Mr. Goldsmith. Why would Scott be concerned about the i

fact that Oswald was a defector? I guess I am asking you to

state the obvious.
. i 1
Mr. Angleton. He had been:in-countérintelligence all his

life and he had handled an awful lot of Soviet cases.

Mr. Goldsmith. The last sentence of pagraph five indi-
cates "Please keep headquarters advised of any further ~ g
contacts or positive identification of Oswald." t

Assuming that the Mexico City station, prior to the
assassination, knew that Oswald had also contacted the Cuban
Embassy, should that information have been communicated to
headquarters and by using the words or the phrase “assuming

that Mexico City station knew", I mean actual knowledge, they

Mr. Goldsmith. I note at the bottom left hand corner

of the document that Thomas Karamessines was the releasing

officer. Why would someone as high up in DDO as Karamessines

have been the releasing officer for a cable of this kind?

“a

ri the above referred to individual was not Lee Harvey Oswald."

In other words, the substance of this paragraph suggests

that there was a tape recording that was listened to after the

the Bureau was in possession of the tape.

youth in Alabama which were sort of Mark Twainish. He had
it privately printed.

one of the things that this Joe Trento, the reporter, gave out

i

that he learned form this Committee, he put it that he learned

from the Committee that they had a memorandum between. myself

and Dick Helms to the effect that I wrote a memo to Dick say-

ing that Howard Hunt was in Dallas at the time of the assassi-
nation and I was suggesting or proposing a cover-up.

Miss Brady. To whom?

Mr. Angleton. To Helms. Now, when I was called before
the Watergate Committee I was challenged about soom such and {
such in the Executive Office Building. I didn't even know |
what they were talking about. I determined that that is where}
all the Watergate people were hanging about, Hunt.

|

|

I kept getting all these threatening telephone calls from

couldn't honestly understand what they were talking about until

i

the whole Hunt thing hit the fan and they arrested Hunt and

so. on,

Then a journalist came to me and tole me that there was i

| in inspector Bast, he called himself Inspector Bast, who is i

private investigator in McLean, and he had invited Colson to

his. swimming pool and that he had a hidden microphone in the

i shrubbery and that Colson told him that Angleton had recruited

Hunt and was running Hunt in the White House as his agent and
that Hunt reported. to Angleton daily.
Bast was reported to have this tape recording which he |

made known to this journalist. The journalist was going to

print all of this.

Miss Brady. When was this? During the Watergate period?.

So, when Trento called me at the Army-navy Club, one of

the things he also said to me at that time was, "Has Hunt

Miss Brady. So it is fair to say, apart from whatever

was made known publicly about the Watergate incident, you had

no independent knowledge of Hunt's activities with the Agency?

Miss Brady.. Was there ever really any Agency document

about Hunt's whereabouts on November 22, 1963?

Mr. Angleton. I don't remember any such thing. As I
said, Hung didn't mean a thing to me until after the Watergate.

Miss Brady. Do you have any knowledge of the pre-Bay of

Mr. Angleton. By that name? What is it about?

Miss Brady. Given the lack of resources to go into those |

kinds of areas about Marine Oswald, do you have any opinion |

| about how thorough that part of the Warren Commission's inves-'

tigation was or are there still remaining questions as far as |
i
you are concerned about Marina Oswald? i
|
Mr. Angleton. My only concern I think is the concern of

everybody. It is the facility with which she was able to leave

| was recruited by the Soviet intelligence in order to get his i
wife out, a prominent man. He lived and died before we dis-
covered that he was a Soviet agent.

a result of making a deal.

stay in the Soviet Union?

Mr. Angleton. It was a long time ago. In other words,
this is the whole history of "oviet espionage making use of
hostages, people in the immediate familv as a wya of control and

i
as a leverage over agents. In other words, agents who were |

ideologically opposed to them, yet they operated very effec-

tively for them by virtue of hostages in the family, and even

some famous agents who did high grade work for KGB did it only

by virtue of the hostage situation. i

Miss Brady. Returning now to Golitzen, did you have any
i

knowledge during the initial briefing of Golitzen about a

story or allegation about him that the KGB had a plot in exis

tence priot to the 1960 election to assassinate Nixon if he were
elected?
Mr. Angleton. I don't know. I heard this before. I

don't think that is the way, to my memory, the way he put it.

That is again the trouble I find with the Hart testimony,

the inaccuracies of making those kinds of statements, whether he

so part of the de-Stalinization was to raise the XGB -- and

it took several years, six years, before this was culminated -T

Miss Brady. So, your recollection of the story of the

Mr. Angleton. All I am syaing is that having talked thou~
sands and thousands of hours with him I don't remember his

saying that to me about Nixon. All I am trying to say is that

that would have rung a lot of bells. Maybe he did say it. If!

i he did I don't think he ver said it to me because you had to keep

in mind that when he first came to the tnited States he was in’
the hands of the Soviet Division. Then there were a lot of
misunderstandings, and fauling out between the Divison and

Golitzen.

Miss Brady. Why was a decision madevultimately to turn the

Mr. Angleton. The Office of Security had a right to

sible for the personal security and physical security of instal-

close relationships in terms of daily visits back and forth on.

Miss Brady. Is it correct that that was after an early
assessment that he was not bona fide?

Mr. Angleton. That is right. I think the polygraphic
test showed that he wasn't and so on. So that when the Soviet
Division failed in breaking him through hostile interrogation,
and obviously his relationship with all those people had evap- |

orated, it was not illogical to let -- I mean if you are

up from there and sweeten the situation, particilarly because

they believed in him. Then they had a keen interest in arriving

Director who also is empowered to do certain things with the

Attorney General in terms of the status, citizenship, and bills
in Congress and so on.

I will put it this way, the FBI was disseminating his

| reports.- I have to backtrack on this. It is very difficult

to explain it, When McCone was before the hearings of the

i Church Committee he made the statement in an interview with

Daniel Schorr that the material had not: gone to the Warren

Commission, or words to that effect, because there were doubts
Hy i

/ as to the bona fides of Nosenko. But that since then he had been

| assured by the Agency or had been told by the Agency that the | -

i

i

i bona fides had been established. When I heard this on television
1

I immediately called the Agency and raisedia serious question i

on how they could make a statement that his bona fides had been

established.

There was a lot of waffling on this. ‘They said that had Keen

accepted when Security took over, or words to that effect. So

I called Tom Xaramessines, I said, "What is your understanding

of the status of the man Nosenko?" He said the man's bona

fides had not been established. So even in the FRI report
information disseminated by him was sourced as information from
a KGB, or whoever they might put down there, whose bona fides

| had not been established.

So that this was a determination hurried up by Colby and

: company because they had another embarrassment on their hands. ;



is-11 144

They had one journalist, TV commentator in Moscow, who had :

i
@ 2 | been named Sam Jaffee whose uncle was the famous Hollywood actor,
i
|
i

| he was a great character actor. Nosenko had accused him, had |

i

| made the statement that he was a Soviet agent while he was a TV

man in Moscow, and named his case officer. Jaffee got on i

us

this business and couldn't get jobs and therefore challenged the

| Agency as to whether he was bona fide or not. So, Colby sent i

him a letter stating that he wasn't a Pussian agent, et

aaah (202) Sen-2545

| cetera.

i
i

But the Bureau refused to give him such a letter. He is

still running around. He has been on the Tomorrow Show and a ;

ast

lot of other things. So he is still in the woodwork.

ING,

Miss Brady. The next area I would go into would be the whole
initiation of the Hart report. I think at this point I am i
i
going to defer again to Micky and then we can arrange our own !

time.

Mr. Angleton. Fine. Would you make a note there, that last

questionnaire, to go back gain, because I want to make it more

cogent than it remains at this moment.

Miss Brady. What was the general purpose of the CI/SIG
unit within the CI Staff?

ur. Angleton. The purpose of it basically was that the
Office of Security has jurisdiction, the Director of Security |

has jurisdiction over the physical installations of the Agency!

and has sole possession of security files and is responsible |

i
for the security clearance of personnel. That is an exclusive
jurisdiction.

In any intelligence organization the most sensitive thing
is the security file, particularly the CIA. It is a very
thorough thing from birth plus everything that every hostile
neighbor might have to say about somebody.

Now, I set it up in 1954 for the purpose of, one, that
no one in the Counterintelligence, which is part of Clendes-
tine Services, would ever have access to anybody's security
file. I chose an individual who had been ex-FBI and who had
worked in the Office of Security as the man to run that com- |
ponent. So that I never had access to the secuirty files nor |
did anybody else.

But in the event that there was an allegation about an
employee, he could review with the Security Officer the entire
file. But all that he would give to me or to any of my sub-
ordinates would be purely any relevant extract from that file,

which pertained to the lead as a way of sanitizing, I mean of

keeping inviolable the security file. Now, that was one of

their functions.

Second, prior te this there was no place in the govern-
ment where you could find a list of defectors from the United
States. Normally that should have fallen on the FBI to keep
a list of all defectors and so on. So when I took over the
Counterintelligence, my whole thing first was to build up a
data base and all those gaps in government tnat ‘one could
find where you should have eounterinte nee coverage and
that was, for example, among other things, all the German
captured documents.

Miss Brady. Have you finished with your answer?

Mr. Angleton. No, I am just saying -- you were asking
for the functions of the SIG and I was trying to explain what
they are.

Miss Brady. Yes, I asked for the functions in general
terms and your answer was responsive.

Mr. Angleton. It is not responsive because it had many

duties that had to do with other categories of sensitive cases

involving Americans and other things which were not being
handled by anybody else or just falling between stools and
so on.

Miss Brady. Would the organizational cnarter of the

i CI/SIG make reference to these various organizational

functions?

Mr. Angleton. It would probably in fairly camouflaged

and so on it was very much fuzzed over if anyone was laying |
out the CI Staff.

Miss Brady. Can you state with certainty that one of

the essential functions of the CI/SIG unit was to maintain

a current list of American defectors to other countries?

Mr. Angleton. It would fall within that but there was

major effort was done to try to get all this. It was also

to do all the defectors from the Soviet Bloc which had never

been done.

Miss Brady. Prior to the assassination this was not one

Mr. Angleton. I can't say that for a certainty. I can't:

say it for a certainty because it had so many duties. This :

time you are referring to -- to come back to reality, the
heaviest burden on them was Mr. "XxX", Golitzin, because there :

were bodies of sensitive intelligence that as far'as I know
have never been disclosed running into thousands of pages of
hard documents relating to Soviet intelligence, and they were

also primarily responsible for that.

Miss Brady. Let me show you a number 738. This is an

the opening of a 201 file. I ask you to review that particular

| question. According to this document the file was opened
; in December of 1960. Earlier I showed you a State Department

telegram reporting Oswald's intention to provide the Soviets

with military intelligence. That document was dated October

31, 1959. It has been alleged by critics of the Warren
Commission that there is something unusual about the delayed

cpening of the 201 file.

In your opinion, is there anything unusual about the

delayed opening of the 201 file?

e

Mr. Angleton. That date again is what?
Mr. Goldsmith.October 31, 1959.
Mr. Angleton. What time was it received by Egeter?
Mrv'Goldsmith. the earlier telegram is dated October 31,
1959, This is dated December 1960, more than a-.year later.
Is There anything unusual about that apparent delay in the
opening of the 201 file?
Mr. Angleton. Was she the only recipient of that tele-
gram?
Mr. Goldsmith. The telegram does not indicate who was the
recipient. In fact, I think it went to the Security Office.

Mr. Angleton. Normally there is a cover sheet, a

registry. When that telegram comes in -- let me see that

telegram again.

In other words, the procedure, when that telegram came i

n

in from Moscow that would go to the Soviet Division who should
have the action on that telegram. It would have probably

gone to the Office of Security simply because of the relation-
ship between the Security Office -- i

Mr. Goldsmith In fact, this document was obtained from

4 (202) S5u-2am5

the Security Office.

Mr. Angleton. I am trying to reconstruct what the
internal dissemination was. It might well have gone to Liaison
of some sort. We had a lot of liaison. But the action on !
that telegram would have been the Soviet Division to open a
201 file.

MriGoldsmith. Again, my question isiwhy would it have

taken more than a year to open the file on Oswald. Is there

anything unusual in your view?

SMe
i

Mr. Angleton. I don't know the circumstances. TI don't
understand why it would take that long. In my view that

should have hit the Soviet Division pretty hard.

Mry Goldsmith. Why would CI?SIG have responsibility for

opening the 201 file on Oswald at this time?

Mr. Angleton. That is what confuses me a bit, and I

am confused here because if there was anyone more meticulous

that I ever ran across it was Miss Egeter.

Mr..Goldsmith. Let me give you some background information.

According to the record, in late October of late 1960 the
Agency received from the Department of State a list of
defectors. I am referring now to CIA number A-21 and A-22.
A-22 has Oswald's name on it. You might want to read this
letter, A-21, skim it.

Mr. Angleton. I see that.

Mr. Goldsmith. Now, this information was all routed to
CI/SIG apparently but until today --

Mr. Angleton. Is there a routing slip?

Mr. .Goldsmith.
you are looking at right now, we don't have a routing slip.
I guess you will have to take my word for the record.

Mr. Angleton. All I am saing is that we had so many
cifficulties with Bissell as Deputy Director of Plans that I
am amazed it actually came to us.

Mri:iGoldsmith. According to the Agency's records, these
letters were routed to your office in 1960, late October
1960. Approximately. a month later the file was opened.
However, until you testified earlier, no one hae really
indicated to us that one of the purposes of the CI/SIG was

to monitor defectors.

Mr. Angleton. It was to build up the most sensitive

By opening Oswald's 201 file and marking it restricted,
would that normally mean that if someone else in the Agency

requested access to the file, Miss Egeter or someone else

Mr. Angleton. It is not a question of marking it

restricted so much. It is a question that if she entered,

would permit him to read it. It might be a superior interest
; and the file gets transferred to the next fellow. ;

copy of some index cards that were found in Oswald's 201 file.
I would like to refer you to the card on the top of the page |
which is marked “Secret Eyes"Only" and has Cswald's name on

9 November 1959. Do you know what that would be referring to?

Mr. Angleton. These were in what?

Mr..Goldsmith. Oswald's 201 file. The Committee is speci-
fically interested in whether Oswald was the subject of any
CI project. By that, was he actually a participant or was he i

under surveillance by any CI project? :

Mr. Angleton. I wouldhave to go back into all the symbol's

that they used down there to understand "RE" unless it had

. What is your opinion of his reliability?
Mr. Angleton. I have always regarded him as a little
bit of a romantic. I think he is a very honest, straight-

forward fellow who is not really much of a professional. I

think he is a very decent, upright, forthright person. But
I don't think any subtleties of the business ever penetrated.
Mr.iGoldsmith. Do you know an individual named Maurice
1
Bishop?
Mr. Angleton. No. i
Mr. Goldsmith. Have you ever heard reference to the term
"Black Tape 201 File?
Mr. Angleton. No.
Mr.°Goldsmith. Did you know Paul Harman? :
Mr. Angleton. Very well.’
Mr.Goldsmith, Will you give us your opinion as to his
reliability?
Mr. Angleton. Very high. Paul is a person who fell on
bad times when he was running operations in the German Divi-
sion or something when I salvaged him. i
Mr.‘Goldsmith. How many years did he work on your staff?
Mr. Angleton. I don't know. It seemed like eternally
but it wasn't. It was many years. I regard him as a very
unique individual.
Of course, Paul was trained by Rocca to begin with and !
that is very important because he learned everything from t
Rocca. He is the only man I ever knew in the Clendestine '
Service who never failed you on tracking down something or
finding it, whether it is a system in the Library of Congress;!

in other words, he made discoveries which had been there had

the Agency ever known it was there for anyone if they had the
imagination, the drive, the tctal dedication htat he had. i
Therefore, he made tremendous breakthroughs of bringing us
the efforts and labors of other people in government at no i
cost.

Mr. Goldsmith. Did he have a good memory?
; Mr. Angleton. A tremendous memory.
| Mr.! Goldsmith. Was he a record retrieval expert? i
Mr. Angleton. He was. He was a bird dog.
Mr. Goldsmith. Mr. Angleton, that just about exhausts ny
questions. I would like to thank you very much for your
assistance today.

Mr. Angleton. Thank you.

Mr.° Goldsmith. I also would like to add that normally when
the Counted takes a statement from a witness at a hearing,
at the conclusion of the hearing, the witness is given an
Opportunity to make a statement. This is not a formal hearing.

: i
and the same procedure does not autimatically apply. However,

if you would like to take advantage of the opportunity to make

a five minute statement for the record, please feel free to i

do so.

Also he is coming back another day to finish my questions,
Mr. Angleton. I simply want to recapitulate this would
i have been the end of my session had it not been for the

‘ surprise witness, John Hart. I don't think I can let 31 years

cf my life go down the drain listening to Hart. So that I

will be back when I have annotated what I regard to be one {

of the worst torpedoes that the Director has launched into

the depths and has missed the target and it may make a U turn.
|

I use nautical terms because he has been launching a lot of i
H

torpedoes in a very brief career.

)
So I will go on record with all my observations regarding

that and I want to point out first, so that you will under-
stand the depths of my feeling, that I was not notified by

the Committee and I was not notifed by the Agency that Mr. i
Hart was going to appear and therefore I had a great deal of
personal troubles that came about as a result of that surprise
testimony which I had not heard. It involves the reputations |
ef a great number of men.

Number one, the CI Staff did not have any jurisdiction
ever Nosenko. The CI Staff was never involved in any of the |;
administrative details, payments or whatever. Contrary to
Hart's statement, I never saw the installation or visited the |
installation with the Chief of the Soviet Division, which he
states as a categorical fact in his testimony. |

I never was consulted regarding hostile interrogation, !
to which I am very much opposed. I don't mean by that torture
or anything else. JI mean alerting Nosenko tnat there are
suspicions regarding his testimony. That is totally contrary

to my philosophy of counterintelligence. So that it was a

frolic of others. But I do not stand aside from those others |
because all those decisions went up through the channels of

command and were made and therefore I stand by what the

i
ultimate decisions were.

2] But he coalesced this into an accusation against the i

i

permitted to give that testimony in public and in that way he

has hurt a great number of people. I won't go into the big

3 | I want to be responsive to that.

My hope had always been with the Church Committee that

these matters would be pursued as they said they would be
pursued when they turned the files over to the Senate
Intelligence Committee. It was to be a continuity of these
matters that would be followed up. There has never been.
‘Ivmight also add if the Admiral had any judgment in my
view, he would have called together people wno were familiar
with these cases, with Hart present, and he would have had a
normal discussion or conference with them and I don't think he

would have put Hart up there for testimony. Because I

question, one, Hart's qualifications, his first job having
been as a very junior subordinate under me in Italy. I know 1
his career. I have been on all the senior promotion boards
from the very beginning and therefore, his file has crossed

my path many, many a time.

He was a Colby man when he was put He was put in

Therefore, those are my feelings about it. I never have

I think the Bureau showed great wisdom when they refused |

to send somebody because these are all continuing cases. Just!
