When queried about the Brazilian Senator, Merola said that he has not
et received details, but that Sam Kay, one of his ass

es in the Latin
serican contraband business, told him that the Senator was interested in
eveloping a project whereby large quantities of whiskey would be smuggled into
cazil.

He said that the Senator had visited Cuba following Castro's victory
ad had been the special guest of "Che" Guevara.

No other details were mde

lending aid to Castro.

9. We expressed appreciation for his offer of assistance but stated
that it was very unlikely that we would request any help; however, we would
be glad to hear details of any Latin American intrigue which comes to his
attention, and which could be of any significance.
