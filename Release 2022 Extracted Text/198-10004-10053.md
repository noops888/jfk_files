CUBA
THE EXCHANGE OF INTELLIGENCE
CONCERNING COMMUNIST SUBVERSIVE ACTIVITIES
I. Introduction

In combatting Castro-Communist subversion through-
out Latin America, there is a fundamental requirement
for intelligence -- a requirement which involves the
timely acquisition and processing of information as
well as its rapid dissemination, on a selective basis,
to countries concerned, While efforts are now being
made by CIA, AID, and the US Military Services to
improve Latin American intelligence systems, success
thus far has been limited, and much remains to be done.
It is not with this broad problem, however, that this
paper is primarily concerned, but rather with the
narrower matter of the need for a stronger program of
exchanging essential information regarding Communist
subversion in Latin America among those who need to
know it.

II. The Nature and Scope of the Problem

1, Limiting Factors

a. There are many inhibitions which tend to
discourage the exchange of intelligence on an
international basis, even among allies. National
privacy with regard to the inner workings of an
intelligence system must be preserved. Com-
pounding the problem further, where Latin. America
is concerned, is the divisive influence of the
long history of rivalries, wars, jealousies and
disputes which have characterized relations among
the nations concerned. The wounds of past conflicts
among pairs and groupings of nations are not com-
pletely healed. There is lingering hostility
between Peru and Ecuador deriving from their
boundary war. Chile and.Bolivia continue at
odds over the Rio Lauca and the question of
Bolivian access to the sea, and, even now,
Nicaraguan insurgents are harbored within the
borders of both Costa Rica and Honduras. It
could hardly be expected that these countries
would be eager to exchange intelligence on a full
and frank basis.

SECRET

HW 50955 DocId:32276038 Page 6


b. Beyond s, Latin America is not a homo-
geneous entity in social, political, or economic
terms, and attitudes toward the Castro-Communist
subversive menace vary widely. A completely
unified approach toward exchange of intelligence

concerning this menace, therefore, cannot be
regarded as attainable.

“* SECRET

ec. Additional impediments to intelligence ex-
change are the generally low level of competence
of most Latin American intelligence services, their
lack of rapid, secure means of communication, the
‘absence of adequate security systems, and the lack
of security consciousness, Deficiencies in
security safeguards must necessarily limit the
exchange of intelligence obtained covertly by any
of the nations involved, and particularly the
United States, which has the most sophisticated
system and hence the greatest need for protection,

dad. These defects promise to persist, since the
governments of some countries have little desire to
develop a competent career security service. There
is a fear that the existence of an efficient service
would constitute a threat to further activities of
members of the existing governments at such. time
as they might find themselves out of power. More-
over, many Latin American intelligence services
tend to label as "subversives" those of their own
nationals resident in other countries who are
opposed to the existing government.

e. These realities all underscore the fact that
multilateral intelligence exchange must be
approached on a most circumscribed basis. It
should not be concluded, however that nothing
of value can be accomplished multilaterally.

With proper definition, limiting the problem

of exchange to matters directly related to communist
subversive activities, such as the movement to and
from Cuba,.of subversives, the production and
movement of propaganda materials which threaten
internal stability, the movement of arms, and the
movement of funds, it should be practicable to
marshal a useful measure of cooperation. In
pursuing this effort, it will be important to

draw a sharp distinction between secret intelligence

SECRET

gained by covert means and information obtained
openly. The former involves the requirement to
protect national secrets both as to sources and
acquisition metnods employed. The latter, which
can be of great value, can be exchanged without
fear of compromise.

2. Categories of Exchangeable Intelligence

The following describe generally the categories
of exchangeable matter, and exemplify the types of material
under each:

a. Travel information - Unevaluated information
devoted solely to rapid reporting of the movement
of individuals between Latin America and Cuba or
Soviet Bloc countries. Such reports can be
reduced to a few elements such as identification
of the individual, point of departure, date and
time of departure or arrival, destination, and
earrier. When presented in an abbreviated form
such information offers minimum security problems
with respect to exchange with one or more countries.

b, Intelligence information reports - Un-
evaluated information derived from clandestine
collection operations or confidential sources
reporting on plans and activities of Cuban or
communist connected subversive individuals or
groups; on movement of arms, propaganda and funds;
on shipping and air movements and on results of
surveillance efforts. Because continued receipt
of such information by the United States. is dependent
on careful protection of sources and methods of
eollection, the exchange of this information with
other countries must be carefully controlled by
the collecting department.

ec. Intelligence reports and studies ~ Evaluated
intelligence in all of the above areas, prepared
by an appropriate element of the US government in
a'form which is releaseable to other Latin American
countries.

d. Selected overt materials - Articles or news
stories drawn from press, periodical and other
overt publishers. Selected for maximum impact on

SECRET 3

_ NW 50955 DocId:32276038 Page 8


other countries particularly where such infor-

mation isnot freely available to security services,
as in the, case .of foreign broadcast reports.

“". SECRET

3. Current Exchange Arrangements

a. At present there is little organized ex-
change of intelligence among the Latin American
nations, There is a limited amount of informal
exchange, often on a ba of personal relation-
ships between government officials having a
community o iterest with respect to a particular
matter,

b. The Central Intelligence Agency has e&tab-
lished working liaison arrangements in those

Latin American countries where such relations have
been considered to be in the best interest of the
United States. Most of the intelligence concerning
subversion in Latin America available to the CIA is
derived from covert operations or through contacts
with another intelligence or security service.

This inhibits the. passing of such information to
agencies of a third country. There is, however, a
substantial amount of intelligence available from
overt or non-sensitive sources which can be pro-
vided -to other countries n 1962, CIA received
information reports from services with which
liaison is maintained in Latin America and released
reports to recipients. Intelligence items
exchanged included collated studies, weekly intelli-
gence reviews, name traces and travel reports.

ce. The US Army, through its attaches, currently
has an informal arrangement involving bilateral
exchanges of intelligence with Argentina, Colombia,
Ecuador, Uruguay, Peru, Paraguay and Venezuela.
Information provided by the Army has been concerned
with subversive personalities, communist infiltration,
weapons movements and related matters. Reciprocal
intelligence received has been of small value, The
Army also provides selected information on sub-
versive activities to Brazil, Chile, Guatemala
and Mexico, without reciprocation. The Navy has
established a Navy-to-Navy program for the ex-
change of intelligence among nine South American
navies, the Mexican Navy and the US Navy.

SECRET

d. Exchanges of information are also effected

from time to time through channels of the Depart-
ment ef State.

e. As yet, however, the program for the pro-
vision by United States agencies of information on
subversion to Latin American governments has not
been developed to an adequate degree. Since the
United States possesses the most extensive
acquisition capabilities, as well as the only
secure and reliable means of rapid communication
throughout Latin America (currently in process
of improvement), the development of an integrated
United States system for bilateral exchange offers
the greatest possibility of achieving the results
desired,

f. United States experience in the matter of
intelligence exchange in Latin America, and in
other areas of the world, has led to the conclusion
that bilateral arrangements are more fruitful than
multilateral arrangements such as those established
within the framework of NATO, CENTO and SEATO.
Nevertheless, this experience has shown also that
multilateral arrangements can be of some use,
particularly in creating an awareness of the need
for intelligence exchange.

g. The concept of an exchange of information
among members of the OAS with regard to subversive
activities has been put forward at numerous Inter-
American meetings, but has not been implemented,
largely for the reasons set forth in Section II. l.
Under the Punta del Este decisions, the OAS members
were urged to cooperate in strengthening their
capacity to counteract threats or acts of aggression,
subversion or other dangers to peace and security.
The Council of the OAS is charged with maintaining
vigilance over Castro-Communist subversion, and
a "Special Consultative Committee on Security (SCCS)"
is established to give technical advice on request
to governments and the Council on matters relating
to subversion. All American governments have been
asked to furnish information .on Castro~Communist
activities to serve as the basis for studies and
recommendations by the Council of the OAS on how to

wi

DocId:32276038 Page 10


counteract them. Since the Punta del Este meeting,
the OAS hag been making slow progress in the
countersubversion field, but there has as yet been

no significant exchange of intelligence through
its machinery.

* SECRET

h, The Inter-American Defense Board (IADB) has
also demonstrated an awareness of the need for
exchanging intelligence regarding communist sub-
version. Annex 4 of the General Military Plan
prepared by the IADB requests the American States to
report information to the Board and to establish
agreements among themselves for exchanging infor-
mation of collective interest. The United States
has approved the Genéral Military Plan, but similar
action has not been taken by all member countries.

i. This brief summary serves to. illustrate that
there is much room for expansion of bilateral
intelligence exchange arrangements among the Latin
American nations themselves, which is now minimal
at best, as well as a need to create an expanded
program for bilateral intelligence exchange between
the United States and individual countries, and
finally, a requirement to develop the possibilities
of a multilateral approach within the recognized
limitations involved.

III, Existing Programs

Enumerated below are the principal programs now in
progress. They are subject to continuing improvement.

1. Bilateral exchange of intelligence is now being
conducted by CIA, DOD, and other US agencies with their
Latin American counterparts in instances where it has
been found possible to establish appropriate arrangements
for exchange of selected information consistent with
security requirements.

2, A study is currently underway to evaluate the
feasibility and desirability of establishing military
intelligence centers of the Caribbean Command and the
Caribbean Sea Frontier, Atlantic Command, for further
dissemination of intelligence as appropriate in con-
junction with our Military Alerting System, for rapid
processing and dissemination when appropriate, of
intelligence on subversive activities directly to. the
countries concerned through the US Ambassador.

SECRET 6

HW 50955 DoclIda:32276038 Page 11


3. Intelligence is being provided to the Caribbean
Command by CIA and other elements of the US Embassies
in Latin America as well as to CIA Headquarters for
further dissemination as appropriate.

““* SECRET

4, Various agencies of the-US Government are now
disseminating to Latin American governments unclassi-
fied studies and reports and other non-sensitive
information concerning Castro-Communist subversion.

5. US Government communications systems through-
out Latin America are being expanded and improved upon
on a high priority basis.

6. Programs now exist under AID, CIA, and DOD for
the training and equipping of Latin American internal
security and intelligence services. Additional programs
could be established in other countries where it is
found to be in the best interests of tthe United’ States and
acceptable to the country concerned.

7. All information received by CIA concerning
travel to and from Cuba is put into a computer system
capable of producing lists by name, by country, by point
of travel, or sorted on various other bases.

Iv. New Actions Recommended

1. Reinforce the present procedures for bilateral
exchange of intelligence, as described in Section III. 1.
by recommending that the US Ambassadors utilize the
existing Country Team mechanisms as an intelligence
advisory committee to coordinate procedures for ensuring
timeliness, completeness and freedom from duplitation
or false confirmation in. the bilateral exchange with
the host governments.

2. Encourage Latin American countries to engage
in bilateral exchange of intelligence on Castro-
Communist subversive activities.

3. Arrange for the electrical dissemination .to
appropriate Latin American governments of daily

summaries of radio broadcast material as monitored by
the FBID of CIA.

SECRET 7

HW 50955 DoclId:32276038 Page 12


4. Make available to as many countries as security
permits, sanitized results-of the extensive travel
coverage obtained by the Central Intelligence Agency,
already processed by machine. (See paragraph III. 7.)

“a « SRORET

5, Increase, where feasible, emphasis on the
provision of US intelligence advisors to Latin American
countries, Discourage the employment of intelligence
advisors from nations other than the United States
except in instances where the United States can arrange
to previde for the training and control of any third
country intelligence advisor.

6, Arrange for the preparation of periodic studies
of Castro-Communist subversion in Latin America which
can be disseminated to selected Latin American govern-
ments.

7. Undertake action in the OAS to stimulate govern-
ments to keep the Council and the SCCS fully informed
on a continuing basis of the nature and incidence of
subversive activities in their respective countries.

8. Encourage Latin American countries to approve
the General Military Plan of the Inter-American Defense
Board (IADB), and, in accordance with Annex 4 thereof,
furnish to the IADB intelligence information and
estimates concerning Castro-Communist subversive
activities,

9. Undertake action in the OAS to establish a
Security Intelligence Advisory Committee consisting of
senior representatives of the appropriate services of
each government to deal with all major aspects of sub-
versive activities in their respective countries, consider
new coordinated plans of action to counter and neutralize
subversion, and implement necessary actions to insure
the most effective and timely exchange of information
between the governments on subversive activities.

RY OF THE ARMY

Subject: Intelligence Paper on Cuba

1. Attached is a copy of the final paper prepared by
my committee on the exchange of intelligence. It reflects
the changes proposed by CIA in our earlier agreed paper,
as well as amendments to the CIA proposals arising from
the meeting of my committee last Saturday.

2. The only change of significance proposed by CIA is
found on page 3, paragraph 2, "Categories of Exchangeable
Intelligence." This paragraph, as submitted by CIA, would
have seriously limited the kinds of intelligence which we
would exchange with our Latin friends, so much so as to
make the paper relatively insignificant.

At my meeting last Saturday we made the additions
which are underlined in red on page,3. Those additions
are designed to vitiate the adverse restrictions involved
in the CIA proposal. As you will see, the additions
characterize the categories of exchangeable intelligence
only as examples, and add, specifically, all of the intel-
ligence areas in which we are interested.

3. The remaining changes proposed by CIA were relatively
insignificant - removal from the action category of certain
on-going programs and the addition of CIA's IBM computer
capability among the actions.

4, This paper, as you see it, was fully concurred in
by my committee, including the CIA man who, to my surprise,
agreed in the changes which broadened greatly the CIA
contribution. I have forwarded the paper to Cottrell.

intelligence among the Latin American nations.
There is a limited amount of informal exchange,
often on a basis of personal relationships between
government officials having a community of interest

with respect to a particular matter.

The Central Intelligence Agency has established
working liaison arrangements in some Latin American
countries where such relations have been considered
to be in.the best interest of the United States.
Most of the intelligence concerning subversion in
Latin America available to the CIA is derived from
covert operations or through contacts with another
intelligence or security service. This inhibits the
passage of such information to agencies of a third
country. There is, however, a substantial amount
of intelligence available from overt or non-sensitive
sources which can be provided to other countries.
In 1962, for example, CIA received information re-
ports fron| services with which liaison is main-
tained in Latin America and released reports tol
recipients. Intelligence items exchanged included
collated studies, weekly intelligence reviews, name
traces and travel reports.

The U.S, Army, through its attaches, currently
has an informal arrangement involving bilateral
exchanges of intelligence with Argentina, Colombia,
Ecuador, Uruguay, Peru, Paraguay and Venezuela.

Information provided by the Army has been concerned

with subversive personalities, communist infiltra-
tion, weapons movements and related matters.
Reciprocal intelligence received has been of small

value. The Army also provides selected information

on subversive activities to Brazil, Chile, Guatemala
and Mexico, without reciprocation, The Navy has
established a Navy-to-Navy program for the exchange
of intelligence among nine South American navies, the
Mexican Navy and the U.S, Navy.

Some information has been released from time to
time to Latin American countries by the Commander-
in-Chief, Caribbean Command, operating through the
Military Groups, and exchanges of information are
also effected from time to time through channels
of the Department of State.

As yet, however, the program for the provision
by United States agencies of information on subver-
sion to Latin American governments has not been
developed to an adequate degree. Since the United
States possesses the most extensive acquisition
capabilities, as well as the only secure and re-
liable means of rapid communication throughout Latin
America (currently in process of improvement), the
development of an integrated United States system
for bilateral exchange offers the greatest possi-

bility of achieving the results desired.

United States experience in the matter of intel-
ligence exchange in Latin America, and in other areas
of the world, has led to the conclusion that bilateral
arrangements are more fruitful than multilateral
arrangements such as those established within the
framework of NATO, CENTO and SEATO. Nevertheless,
this experience has shown also that multilateral
arrangements can be of some use, particularly in
ereating an awareness of the need for intelligence
exchange. :

The concept of an exchange of information among
members of the OAS with regard to subversive activi-
ties has been put forward at numerous Inter-American
meetings, but has not been implemented, largely for
the reasons set forth in Section II.1. Under the
Punta del Esta decisions, the OAS members were
urged to cooperate in strengthening their capacity
to counteract threats or acts of aggression, sub-
version or other dangers to peace and security.

The Council of the OAS is charged with maintaining
vigilance over Castro-Communist subversion, and a

"Special Consultative Committee on Security (Sccs)"
is established to give technical advice on request

to governments and the Council on matters relating

to subversion. All American governments have been
asked to furnish information on Castro-Communist

: activities to serve as the basis for studies and
recommendations by the Council of the OAS on how
to counteract them. Since the Punta del Esta meet-
ing, the OAS has been making slow progress in the
countersubversion field, but there has as yet been
no significant exchange of intelligence through its
machinery.

This brief summary serves to illustrate that
there is much room for expansion of bilateral in-
telligence exchange arrangements among the Latin
American nations themselves, which is now minimal
at best, as well as a need to create an expanded
program for bilateral intelligence exchange. be-
tween the United States and individual countries,
and finally, a requirement to develop the possibili-
ties of a multilateral approach within the recog-

nized limitations involved.

III. Actions Recommended ‘

1. Increase the existing bilateral exchange of in-
telligence conducted by CIA, DOD, and other U.S. agencies,
where it is found possible’ to establish appropriate
arrangements for the exchange of selected information con-
sistent with security requirements.

2. Establish military intelligence centers at the
headquarters of the Caribbean Command and the Caribbean
Sea Frontier, Atlantic Command, for further dissemination
of intelligence as appropriate in conjunction with our
Military Alerting System, for rapid processing and dissem-
ination when appropriate, of intelligence on subversive
activity directly to the countries concerned through the
American Embassies therein.

3. Increase and expedite the existing flow of in-
telligence on subversion from CIA and the other elements
of the American Embassies in Latin America to Caribbean
Command as well as to CIA headquarters for further
dissemination as appropriate.

4, Increase the dissemination to Latin American
governments, by all U.S. agencies concerned, of unclassi-
fied studies, reports and other non-sensitive information

concerning Castro-Communist subversion.

5. Encourage Latin American countries to engage in
pilateral exchange of intelligence on Castro-Communist
subversive activities.

6. Continue the development at high priority of
U.S. communications in Latin America.

7. Increase emphasis on the provision of U.S. in-
telligence advisors to Latin American countries. Dis-
courage their employment of intelligence advisors from
nations other than the U.S.

8, Intensify and increase existing AID, CIA, and
Military programs for the training and equipping of
Latin American internal security and intelligence services.
Establish such programs in additional countries where it
is found to be in the best interests of the United States
and acceptable to the country concerned.

9. Undertake action in the OAS to stimulate govern-
ments to keep the Council and the SCCS fully informed on
a continuing basis of the nature and incidence of sub-
versive activities in their respective countries.

10. Encourage Latin American countries to approve
the General Military Plan of the Inter-American Defense
Board (IADB), and, in accordance with Annex 4 thereof,
furnish to the IADB intelligence information and estimates

concerning Castro-Communist subversive activities.
