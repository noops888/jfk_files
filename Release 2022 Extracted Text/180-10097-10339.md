A.

What were your duties and responsibilities as Chief

of Soviet Operations with the CIA during the period

1954 until 1962?

Responsibility for Soviet operations, programs, policy

and personnel.

Did you direct all programs within that geographical

area?

Not entirely. I had knowledge of all programs.

HOW-

ever,

some were administered by other divisions. An

example would be the U-? program.

Did you ever hear the name of Lee Harvey Oswald prior

to the assassination of John F. Kennedy?

I do not remember hearing or seeing the name prior to

the assassination of President Kennedy. However, it

is possible as I was usually provided a list of

American defectors.

You do not remember seeing the name Lee Harvey Oswald

on the defector list.

NO.

Were any Intelligence projects in operation in 1959-62

involving the use of American defectors in the Soviet

Union?

Not to my knowledge. However, Central Intelligence

might have run a deception operation.

How

was information gathered on American defectors in

the

Soviet Union during that period?

Information is obtained, if possible, from sources

and

assets within the country.

What sources did you have within Russia at that time?

We only had one or two CIA people at the American

Embassy at that time and they were under very deep

cover.

They did utilize third country nationals as

sources. specifically, third country journalists.

Did you ever use American journalists or State Depart-

ment or Embassy personnel?

Not to my recollection.

Do you know Priscilla Johnson McMillan?

NO.

Do you know Alexis Davison?

No. Who was he? If you could tell me something about

him, I may recall.

Are you familiar with the Penkovsky case?

Yes.

Was Davison used as a cut-out for communication with

Penkovsky?

No, now I remember. He was the Embassy doctor.

Davison

was not the regular contact. If he was co-opted by

the CIA, it was an emergency situation.

Was Davison declared persona non grata by the Russian

government because of his assistance in the Perkovsky

case?

I am not sure. He may have been. I just do not

remember.

Was Davison co-opted by the CIA to establish contact

with Lee Harvey Oswald?

No - not to my knowledge. Lee Harvey Oswald was not

a CIA agent or source.

Would you have known it if another Division in CIA

was using Lee Harvey Oswald?

I think I would have been informed. I certainly would

have known about it at a later date. There is no way

the CIA could have kept something like that a secret

for this long a period without the information circu-

lating in CIA circles.

Was any intelligence ever developed during this period

of time about a possible threat to Presidents Kennedy

or Eisenhower involving the Soviets?

NO.

However, I do remember hearing about threats to

cre

Kennedy after the Bay of Pigs. I placed no cridence

to the stories.

Do you remember who told you about the threats?

No.

What type of analysis or evaluation was conducted

after Powers' U-2 was shot down in the Soviet Union?

I believe that the story Powers told was the truth.

The Bartleman Board was established and had hearings

on the subject. Penkovsky verified the conclusions

of the Board.

Would Lee Harvey Oswald have knowledge of the U-2 pro-

radio

gram as

reaio-radar operator at the Naval Base at

Atsugi?

He would not.

What was the scope and focus of KGB recruitment of

Americans in Moscow during the period of time that LHO

was in the Soviet Union?

Anybody they could get.

Did the KGB contact Lee Harvey Oswald?

They probably did.

Did the CIA have access to any KGB personnel during

1959-1962?

we did, but I don't remember their names at this time.

We had Penkobsky and Popov; however, they were both

GRU

(Russian Military Intelligence)

What conclusions were drawn about damage to the Soviets

after Golitsin's defection?

Immediately after Golitson's detection, he gave us

the identity of KGB personnel conducting espionage

operations.

His information was very valuable. However,

the value of his information decreased greatly thereafter.

angleton sincerely believed in Colitsin's bona rides.

Golitsin was one of the very few Soviet defectors that

Angleton did not think was a double agent.

A.

Do you think Nosenko was a double agent?

I don't know. Just because Nosenko lied about his

rank and his involvement with the KGB does not neces-

sarily mean he was a double agent. Most defectors

lie about the value and amount of information they

possess to obtain your support and assistance.

Nosenko may not have been aware of KGB activity which

may have been conducted by the KGB personnel under

the First Secretariat. Nosenko was under the second

Secretariat which dealt with internal intelligence,

but not foreign intelligence.

The above questions and answers were paraphrased by

the writer and they are not necessarily in the order asked or given.

However, the meaning is unchanged.
