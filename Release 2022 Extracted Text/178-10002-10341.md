SUBJECT : Recorded Interview with Mr. Will Wilson of
Austin, Texas.

Mr. Wilson served as an Assistant Attorney General in the
Criminal Division of the Department of Justice from January 20,
1969 (the actual confirmation date was sometime in February
1969) until his resignation in approximately October 1971.

Mr. Wilson, prior to coming to Washington, had been a judge

of the Supreme Court of Texas from 1950 to 1956,and he was
Attorney General of Texas from 1956 until 1962, and he practiced
law in Austin, Texas from 1962 until coming to Washington.
Since leaving Washington he has returned to Austin, Texas to
practice law.

The occasion of his leaving Washington was a resignation which
was an outgrowth of a former client who had been involved in
some banking difficulties in Texas, Frank Sharp, and Mr. Wilson
Says that he removed himself from any participation in any
Department of Justice decisions related to possible prosecution
of Sharp. Attorney General Kleindienst sought to grant immunity
to Sharp in exchange for testimony which might help convict the
Governor of Texas (Preston Smith), but according to Mr. Wilson
the matter was bungled and Sharp was granted immunity with vir-
tually nothing gained in exchange by the Department of Justice.
Also, prior to coming to Washington Sharp had desired to have

an approximate. $700 engineering bill submitted to Mr. Wilson's
law firm for payment and in turn have Mr. Wilson's law firm bill
the $700 sum as- attorney fees, which Mr. Wilson did. Mr. Wilson
said he did not know what the engineering fees were for at the
time. He said that it turned out they were for the installation
of a recording device in a conference room of the bank,which
was installed several years prior to his coming to Washington,
and which according to Mr. Sharp as related to Mr. Wilson was
installed because they thought there might be a bank employee
who was taking kickbacks, and according to Mr. Wilson the bank
employee actually was taking kickbacks. Subsequently Mr. Sharp's

Bank got into financial difficulties, and bank examiners used

the conference room. ‘This was several years after the re-
cording device had been installed. Mr. Sharp, unbeknownst

to the bank examiners, taped their conversation, and when

the Bank went into receivership .the Bank.examiners found out
that their conversations had Been recorded and they subsequently
found out that the recording device had been billed through

Mr. Wilson. Mr. Wilson was asked to resign,and he did this

and went back to Austin.

In early May Mr. Wilson contacted our office and said that he
had some information concerning allegations of CIA involvement
in assassinations or assassination attempts against Castro.

We asked him to come to Washington for an interview and he
consented and was first interviewed on May 14, 1975. The

following is a summary of this interview.

Mr. Belin: Mr. Wilson, I believe you said that during the

time that you were with the Justice Department
here in Washington you came across some files pertaining to
possible CIA involvement in assassination attempts against
Castro. Is that correct?

Mr. Wilson: Yes.
B: And could you just relate what you found?

Ws Yes. I was having a conference with Mr. J. Edgar
Hoover on the subject of using the grants of im-
munity on racketeers in Chicago and he narrated the background
of the grant of immunity to a racketeer named Giancana. They
had granted immunity, he had refused to testify and he was con-
fined for contempt for a number of months. That confinement
ran out due to the fact that grand jury expired out of which
the subpoena was issued, and they had up the question of start-
ing over and they were going --he was going to have the U.S.
Attorney subpeona Mr. Giancana before the grand jury and con-
front him with the same situation in the expectation that he
would refuse to testify after being granted immunity and that
they would again confine him for contempt. That was in progress
when Attorney General Bobby Kennedy came around to Mr. Hoover's
office and told him that they could not go forward with that
because Giancana knew too much. And it was then that Mr. Hoover
learned about the fact that a man named Maheu, who Mr. Hoover
told me he had fired out of the FBI and who subsequently went
to Chicago and formed an detective: agency or investigatory
agency-~private-- and that one of Maheu's clients was Giancana,
the racketeer, that he was informed. by Attorney General Kennedy
that the CIA had, through Mr. Maheu, made contact with Giancana.
and employed a hit man for the purpose of assassinating Castro,

and that this Giancana was well aware of this whole thing, having.

participated in it, and therefore that the Government could not



v3e
——

. go forward with its ‘second contempt proceeding against Gian-

cana. - Hoover stated Attorney General Kennedy was--seemed
to be rather angry or furious about. ‘the fact that a--
vacketeers had been involved in this situation but he felt
like he ‘could not do anything else at that time. Subsequently
to that decision made not to go forward with the contempt pro-
ceeding against Giancana Mr. Hoover told me that he--Giancana--
was released--I think he said--on the basis that he would leave
the country, and Giancana subsequently went to live in.Mexico.

After that conversation, my curiosity was piqued, and I went
back to the Department and requested all the files on the
matter and got a file marked "Secret" and read it twice that

I remember. I do not remember the specific content of the
file, but it was a rather detailed account of the employment
through Giancana of a hit man whose name has escaped me now,
but my memory is that he was to be paid $5,000, and was paid
$5,000 in a’ motel room in, I believe, Miami, Florida--some-
where in Florida. My memory is that there were at least two
meetings in a motel room in Florida, that the man made at least
One and possibly two trips to Cuba, that the project was aban-
doned and terminated and the file had a rather detailed account
of that, according to my memory.

B: All right, now, I think we are coming to the end

of this tape, so I'm going to -- before I ask the
next question change tapes here.. This is the second tape of
this May 15 interview with Will Wilson.

Mr. Wilson, you mentioned the payment of a sum of approximately
$5,000. Do you know if that was for expenses or if it was for
an actual accomplishing of the goal or, do you have any specific
recollection of that?

Ws Not a very good recollection, but to my recollection
is it was simply a fee for the payment for doing it.

B: Do you know when this conversation with J. Edgar
Hoover occurred approximately?

W: I can't place it, although when I checked out that

file I signed for. it and those--being a secret file
the signature should be on that in connection with that file
and I believe that the date I checked it out would show there
and that would have been shortly after the conversation with
Hoover-=not more than a day or so.

B: And Hoover in his conversation with you referred
to previous conversations that he had had with
Attorney General Kennedy. Is that correct?

Ws Yes. L

’ Bs Is there anything else that you can think of that
might be relevant to this subject matter of possible
CIA involvement im assassination attempts against Castro?

W: I believe that's all..of the--that's the basis of

the information I have. Now I might say that I
took that file to General Mitchell and went over it with him
and acquainted him with it and suggested that he make President
Nixon familiar with the matter and it was my imppession that he
did so.

Bs Any other thing that you think may be relevant to
the discussion of this matter?

W: I believe that's all I know that's directly rele-
vant to the Giancana thing. :

B: Anything else you might know about any other assassi-
nation attempts so far as Castro is concerned?

Ws No. Except, do you want me to mention the matter
of the man who resigned in the State Department?

B: . Well, I was going to come to that. Why don't you
talk about the man that resigned in the State
Department, if you would.

W: While I was there--
B: By "there," you mean the Attorney General's office--
W: Yes. While I was in the Attorney General's office

and sometime after this conversation with Mr. Hoover
7zand I can't get the juxtaposition of the time frames in my
mind but--there came across my desk a memorandum--I don't re-
member who it was from or who it was to, except that it was
a memorandum by some employee of the State Department who was
assigned to Mexico City to the Embassy there. He was--finished
his tenure and was resigning and he made a rather--memorandum
rather angry in tone in which he stated that as he resigned
as his last act he wanted to put this in the record and stated
that--as near as I can remember, I may not have the facts any-
where close to the way they are in the memorandum now, but my
recollection is that he stated that he had been at a cocktail
party in Mexico City at which Oswald had come as a guest and that
Oswald was in the company of two known agents of Castro, that
they came together and left together, and that he had attempted

AaVddIT auod *y aTwaaS FHT WONT Kan ars

to get that information to the Warren Commission but that he
felt like it had been suppressed by his superiors.

B: Did he say where the cocktail party took place?
Ws It was in Mexico City.
B: Did he know who was the host, who had invited

Oswald, supposedly?

Ws ' It seemed.to me that that was in there. Where it
was and all the details of it. But I don't re-

°H QTWYIS ANT WONT Kanan TOUT

member it that well now.
B: Do you remember approximately when it occurred?
W Well, it was some time before the Kennedy assassi-
nation and Beyond that I don't--don't remember
the content of the memorandum.
B: Do you have any recollection at all as to what
the first name was or the second name of this
person who signed the memorandum.
We Not at all.
Bs Any other facts that you think might be relevant
to that matter?
W: No, I do not have any other facts on that other 3
than that one memorandum, and I remember that I 2g
initialed that memorandum and it's probably filed somewhere
in the files of the Criminal Division. (>;
ow
Bs Did you discuss that memorandum with anyone else? £
W: I probably did. I discussed many things with s

Henry Peterson. He and I worked very closely
together, and I may have discussed it with Mr. Mitchell. I
__. don't remember now.

B: Before you leave Washington today, could you try
to get hold of Henry Peterson and see if he might
have any recollection of it?

Ws Yes. I'll do that.

B; We tried to --yesterday after our, discussion--tried

to run down some informatiSnGhete that file might
have been and also some information concerning what Castro file
there might have been that you might have seen, and we were at
least in part successful so far as the Castro file is concerned.
Is that correct?

Yes. It's now in the possession of Mr. Jack
Keeney, who is acting head of the Criminal Division.

And Keeney spells his name -- .
K-e~a-n-e-y or -y. Keany.

And I showed you some documents that we had re-
ceived from the PBI. which you said might or might

not have been what you saw.

W:

I perhaps--let me look at those documents again,
I didn't look at them very carefully and let me

look at those and I'll review those again and maybe I can tell
you more about them. .

B;

All right. Fine. Before I do that, is there any
other fact that you think might be in any way rele-

vant to the inquiries of this Commission, either on the subject
of Castro or the--what you see as a suppression or possible
suppression of matters going to the Warren Commission or any-

thing else?

W:

B:

B:

No. I don't think of anything right now.

By the way, how was it that you would have seen
a copy of this State Department employee's memo-
randum or letter?

It got to my in basket. I don't know how it got
there.

All right. Well, I'm going to end the interview
right now, and we'll take a look at those FBI
documents again.

Mr. Wilson, you have examined some of these docu-
ments and I have shown you one which is addressed

to the Attorney General from the Director of the FBI under date

of

March 6,

1967, and you say this may have been one of the

documents you may have seen. Is that correct?

W:

I feel sure
Yes. That probably is. It--what I saw/was the
Justice Department file on the subject and pro-
bably contains the. original: of that.

All right. Is there anything else you want to
add now for the record here?

No. I don't think of anything now.

All right, well, thank you very much for coming

here and we would appreciate your still trying
to get in touch with both Henry Peterson and Mr. Keaney if
you would.

if we want to matl a copy of this on a transcript
to you. .

W: Yes, but I don't remember it.
