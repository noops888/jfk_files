1, Case concerning SUBJECT is forwarded for appropriate action.

2, The Assistant Chief of Staff for Intelligence adheres to his determination,
as stated in Comment Number 1, that induction of SUBJECT into military service is
inconsistent with the interests of national security. However, the determination
of The Judge Advocate General that the proposed allegations should not be drawn
for the reason stated in Comment Number 2, precludes rejection of SUBJECT for
security reasons under present policy.

3, In the event it is determined that SUBJECT is declared acceptable for
induction, recommend that appropriate personnel records be annotated to preclude
HIS receiving access to classified information.

4, Request that the file be returned through the Director of Security,
Assistant Chief of Staff for Intelligence, to the Chief, United States Army
Personnel Security Group, Fort Holabird, Maryland 21219, upon completion of
your action, :
