MEMORANDUM FOR: The Inspector General

ATTENT TON : Scott Breckinridge
VIA : SA/ADDO
FROM : Raymond A, Warren

Chief, Latin America Division

SUBJECT : Follow-up to SLHORIZON-1 Report Mention-
ing Cuban Minister-Counselor Statement
on the Assassination of President Kennedy

REFERENCE : Memorandum LA/COG/235-77

1. As a follow-up to our Reference memorandum, this
is to advise that Kingston Station has queried SLHORIZON-1
again for further information on the subject of this memo-
randum. SLHORIZON-1 could provide no other facts regard-
ing the Cuban Minister-Counselor's statement concerning
the alleged role of Cuban exiles in the assassination of
President Kennedy. SLHORIZON-1 does not know the identity
of the Minister-Counselor's sub-source, although he had
the impression that the allegations were based on a recent
cable from the Cuban Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

2. A sanitized version of this memorandum and the
Reference memorandum is now being prepared for the Office
of the Legislative Counsel for passage to the House Select
Committee on Assassinations.

3. The FBI has already been fully informed of the
significant details in this matter.
