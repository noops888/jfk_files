1. The AMTURVY Operation was designed for the

purpose of conducting sabotage operations against cuha.

It. consisted. of a net of 13 AMTURVY assets whose primary

function, apart from sabotage, was the preparation of

target studies and analysis of sabotage operations. The

files contain only one reference to assassination, that

in 1963 and the continuation of the same plan through to

1965. Based on a review of the files, it is apparent

that the following

assassination plan could have been known to

the Cubans, including the overall purpose of the AMIRVY

Operation.

2. ASSASSINATION PLAN - AMTURVY -13.

AMTURVY-13 (Mario SALABARRIA) was closely

acquainted with Fidel Castro as far back as 1947 and there is son

some indication that they both may have been involved in the

1947 plan to topple the Trujillo Government in the hominican

Republic. However, in 1948, SALABARRIA was responsihle for

the arrest of Fidel Castro, this due to the latters agitation

on behalf of one Emilio TRD. Salabarria was later sentenced

to 30 years in prison for having murdered TRO/ He remained

in prison until 1961 wen he appealed for parole to one

Lionel SOTO Prito: (201-055332). As Salabarria had once

- saved Soto's life; the latter appealed the case to Raul

Castro. Salabarria was subsequently released from prison

in Februaay, 1961. The terms of his release from jail

are unknown.

3. By the summer of 1963 Salaharria was seeking

- weapons and funds for a proposed assassination attempt against

Fidel Castro.

Through his confidant

'AXTURO MAGi? JES4S. VERONA ALrSo, AMTURVY-4 Salabarria

sought contact with AMTURVY-½ Salabarria had known AMTURVY-1's *

brother, AMCONCERI-1 for twenty years and assumed that AMTUPVY-1

was in touch with the AGENCY (how hdassumed this is umknown).

At his first meeting with AMTURVY-1, in the summer of 1963,

Salabarria said he was a member of a group plotting Castro's

death, and needed money and weapons in order to carry out

the pian (AMCROÄK-1 was also a member of this group). In

return for this assistance, Salabarria offered to carry out

miñor sabotage operations for AMTURVY-l's "American contacts"

Thow he knew of these "contacts" is unknown, unless AMTURVY-1

told him).

4. In October 1963; when the Agency was satisfied

with Salabarria's bona fides "we" (the Agency ) managed to

get a few pistols, revolvers, and sahotage materials into

Salabarria's hands, through AMTURVY-4. At this time AMTURVY -4

was receiving materials from the Agency through the pouch of

the

Embassy in Havana. AMTURVY-4 was being assisted

in this matter by (QUANTUM-SI) Whether or not the materials

for Salabarrias assassination plan came through the

pouch is unknown.

'f. The following is an excerpt from UFGA 192]4,

of 28 December 1964, the debriefing of AMTURVY-1 who was

suscessfully exfiltrated from. Cuba in actober 1964: (el 1 114%),

6. By early 1064, however, the Agency had lecome

dissatisfied with Salabarria and his proposed assassination

plan, and had notified the AMTURVY net (in particular

AMTURVY-1, ANTURVY-4, and AMCRBAK-1) to cease working on

the assassination idea.

Salabarria's later attempt to

assáss inate Fidel Castro was not approved by the Agency,

and ke was in fact informed of the Agency's opposition of

to his plan.

7. COMMENTS

If as the file shows, the Ägency approved

of Salabarria's plan to assassinate Fidel Castro and provided

Salabarria with the weapons (this in October of 1963), Castro

could have been awäre of the plan, especially as Salabarria's

Case presents certain CI considerations. Salabarria had been

released from jail following a personal apeal through Raul.

Castro; and this when Fidel Castro was well aware of the

fact that Salabarria was responsible for the death of a

close friend; Emilio TRO; not to mention the fact that

Salabarria was responsible for Castro's arrest in 1948.

What deal, if any, was made with Salaharria in return for

his release from jail is unknown. Nonetheless, Ers Fidel

Castro has a recorded history of not being one to forgive,

especially when he has been affected personally as was the

case with Mario Salabarria.
