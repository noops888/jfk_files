1, The AMTURVY Operation was designed for the
purpose of conducting sabbtage operations against Cuba.
It consisted.of a net of 13 AMTURVY assets whose primary
function, apart from sabotage, was the preparation of
target studies and analysis of sabotage operations. The i
files contain only one reference to assassination, that
in 1963 and the continuation of the same plan through to
1965. Based on-a review of the files, it ‘ds apparent

that the following assassination plan could have been known to

re
the Cubans, including the overall purpose of the AMMURVY
Operation.

AMTURVY-13 (Mario SALABARRIA) was closely le

acquainted with Fidel Castro as far back as 1947 and there is sor

some indication that they both may have been involved in the
1947 plan. to topple the Trujillo Government in the Nominican
Republic. However, in 1948, SALABARRIA was responsible for
the arrest of Fidel Castro, this due to the latters agitation
on behalf of one Emilio TRO, Salabarrid was later sentenced

6. By early 1964, however, the Agency had hecome

dissatisfied with Salabarria and his proposed assassination -
plan, and had notified the AMTURVY net (in particular
AMTURVY-1, AMTURVY-4, and AMCROAK-1) to cease working on
the assassination idea. Salabarria's later attempt to
assass inate Fidel Castro was not approved by the Agency,
and we was in fact informed of the Agency's opposition sf

to his plan.

7. COMMENTS

If as the file shows, the Agency approved
of Salabarria's plan to assassinate Fidel Castro and provided
Saiabarria with the weapons (this in October of 1963), Castro
couid have’ been awdte of the plan, especially as Salabarria's
Gasé presets certain CI! considerations. Salabarria had been
released from jail following a personal apeal through Rau]
Castro; and this when Fidel €astro was well aware of the
fact that Salabarria was responsible for the death of a
close friend, Emilio TRO; not to mention the fact that
Salabarria was responsible for Castro's arrest in 1948.
What deal, if any, was made with Salabarria in return for
his release from jail is unknown. Nonetheless, Rax Fidel
Castro has a recorded history of not being one to forgive, L
