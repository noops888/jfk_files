Dear Jim

‘Tam forwarding a letter from a former Security Service member. to you.
It was furnished to us by the recipient, through his commander, at ona
of our subordinate units. —

After realizing the implications, true or otherwise, we immediately
notified our unit commander to turn it over to the OSI in Florida,
believing they would contact the Federal Bureau of Investigation,
since the writer is a civilian now. E

Yesterday, this office was contacted by an OSI agent at Lowry AFB, CO;
this agent happens to be an ex-Security Service man. He was instructed
by his headquarters to interview the writer of the letter to determi
the names of other individuals he had contacted. Apparently. Mr. Christen-
“sen has a- long history of alcoholism, family problems and now wants to

see a "cleared psychiatrist" as he attributes al] of his problems from

Oct 1963, per the OSI agent. In addition, he has indicated to the OS!
that he now fears for his life.

Z
I'am furnishing this to you as I feel the implication in the letter
should best be handled at the national Jevel and that you are in the
best position to contact the Bureau. I have no knowledge that OSI fas
not done this, but in view of the fect the subject was interviews
a civilian by an AF agent,-rather than an FBI agent, leads me to ¢
this. In addition, you are in a much better position to dete
the nearest psychiatrist, with access, is. located. For your informetion,
we placed the classification markings on the letter. :

i Ve were told by ir. Coombs; the OSI agent at OSI District 14, that the
ae doctor to contact at the VA hospital in Cheyenne, WY is a.Dr Sedel,
