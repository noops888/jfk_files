legitimately, NOLL is planning, with MANNARINO's sanction,

to set up a

card game in the back room of the restaurant,

as

well as a baseball pool when the season opens and in addition

I-4, on February 24, 1958, pointed out that he has

HAZIDAKIS since 1932, and added that for the past twelve.

fifteen years HAZIDAKIS has been a trusted lieutenant of the

MANNARINO organization, directly responsible to KELLY MANNARINO.

I-4 went on to say that at the present time HAZIDAKIS, along

next toy the

Kenmar Hotel and has the direct responsibility

and can:

for holding large amounts of cash and making a final account-

ing of the proceeds taken in each night to the MANNARINO

brothers.

T-4 mentioned the on many occasions KELLY MANNARINO has told

him that he trusts HAZIDAKIS implicitly in money matters and

has absolutely no hesitancy in relying on him to turn over

every cent made on the gambling

tables.

Byway of background information, I-4 explained that

around 1932, HAZIDAKIS was convicted in United States District

Court, Pittsburgh, for giving false testimony at a

naturalization hearing in which he testified that a fellow

countryman from Greece was deserving of citizenship in the

United States and had no prior convictions. According to I-4,

the individual seeking citizenship had several past arrests

which were brought to light and HAZIDAKIS was convicted and

sentenced to serve several months in the Westmoreland County

Jail.

T-4 pointed

out that HAZIDAKIS has a wife and teen-age son

living in Athens, Greece, and that HAZIDAKIS has told him-

on many occasions that he is very proud of the son's scholastic

ability and the progress he is making in high school. T-4

stated that from conversations with HAZIDAKIS he believes

the son, in addition to attending high school in Athens, is

receiving private instructions from a tutor, and that the boy

is apparently possessed with a very high Id.

I-4 went on to say that in his opinion HAZIDAKIS is worth

at least a half million dollars in American money and would

actually like to return to Athens, Greece, permanently if

it were not for KELLY MANNARINO and his influence over him.

T-4 explained that about a year ago HAZIDAKIS visited his

family in Athens and indicated to him before he left that

he might stay in Greece permanently.

:Ti4 stated that several

months later, after HAZIDAKTS returned from Greece and[from

conversations with him, he gathered that KELLY MANNARINO

either ordered HAZIDAKIS back to the United States or sent

someone over to Greece to bring nim back.

T-4 said that

HAZIDAKIS is actually terrified of KELLY "MANNARINO and in his

opinion only stays in the United States for fear of winding

up with a bullet in his head if he refuses to follow KELLY

MANNARINO's orders.

According to I-4, HAZIDAKIS is also afraid that he is aying

of cancer and has

consulted many doctors and visited

several of the major medical clinics in the United States

where he has been assured that he does not have cancer, but

he still continues to worry over the situation needlessly.

In regard to real estate holdings in Greece, T-4 stated

that he recently learned

that the office building owned

by HAZIDAKIS is located in Perias, Greece, rather than

Athens, and described the building as a large office-type

building, occupied for the most part by doctors and professional

men with the main floor of the building being leased

merchants.

extreme bitterness over the fact that JOHy ReNt, now a

Congressman in the U. S. House of Represenatives, who was

then in Harrisburg, Pa.

‚Üí had promised him a transfer to

T-4 said that EARL KIME (phonetic), the present District

Attorney for Westmoreland County, would like very much to

run for the vacancy on the County Bench created by the recent

death of County Judge BAUER, but that TANNAS has instructed

1263 Third Avenue

New Kensington, Fa.

On February 28, 1958, T-4. stated that for the past fifteen

to eighteen years, the MANNARINO brothers have had a complete

monopoly on the distribution of pinball machines in New

Kensington and Arnola, Pa.

T-4 estimated that the MANNARINO

brothers have from 300 to 400 pinball machines placed in

practically every restaurant, bar, hotel and other places of

business in the above area and that distribution is made

through the facilities of the Nu-ken Novelty Company. I-4,

who personally owns and operates a place of business in

New Kensington, Pa., explained that he has a pinball machine, belonging

to the MANNARINO brothers and distributed through the Nu-Ken

E MANGARINO Brotherained

Novelty Company, in his place of business.

T-4 explained that

the MANNARINO pinball machine in his place of business takes

in anywhere from $35 to $50 a week, adding that the MANNARINO

brothers for a number of years have been operating the following

scheme in regard to the collection of money from pinball

machines. According to T-4, the scheme is worked through the

collection men who make weekly calls to pick up money taken

in by the pinball machines during the week, and that lor

example, a particular machine brings in $50

a week, the

collection man writes out a receipt to the proprietor for

only $25.00, the

additional $25 being split between the

MANNARINO brothers and the

T-4 pointed out that

he has been operating under this type of an arrangment with

the MANNARINO brother's since 1952. T-4 went on to say that

as far as the receipt is concerned in the example given above,

the proprietor's profit for tax purposes: would be shown as

$12.50 while the Nu-Ken Novelty Company would d√©clare a taxable

profit of the same amount. T-4 added that operating under this

arrangement, the MANNARINO brothers have been able to make

tremendous amounts of money with a minimum amount of worry

over being discovered by the Internal Revenue Service since

it would be most difficult to prove the violation involvea.

T-9, on March 7, 1958, advised that the MANNARINO brothers

have around 300

MIKE ZERVOS, PCI

PCI WALTER J. SHARKEY has been confined to his home and

place of business since last contacted for the purpose of

assisting and caring for, his teenage daughter who is recuperating

from a serious leg injury suffered as a result of a fall while

horseback riding.

Consequently, SHARKEY has not been in a

position to actively develop information but he has indicated

that his daughter's health is improving to the point where ne

will soon be free to develop additional information in this

case.

The lead to recontact former PG 511-C has not been covered

due to the unavailability of the informant.

on March 12, 1958, advised SAS NORMAN T.

she pointed out

that because of constant arguments

with her

mother over the way in which she conducts her social life,

she plans to leave home within the next few weeks to live

with her brother and sister-in-law in Georgia permanently.

SUPRANO was very hostile and refused to enter into a

discussion concerning JOHN FONTANA or the MANNARINO brothers

adding that she did not want to become involved in the

situation and had no intention of cooperating with the FBI.

In the opinion of the interviewing agents, SUPRANO is a -

completely unreliable and unpredictable teenager.

Consequently,

she will not be recontacted for development as a

PCI.

CONNIE OLZEWSKI, beautician, Kaufmann's Department Store,

Pittsburgh, on March 11, 1958, was re-interviewed by

SAS THOMPSON and DOUCE for the purpose of further examining

her potential as an informant and also to develop; if

possible, further information regarding her dates with

GABRIEL MANNARINO as previously reported by PG 564-c on

December 11, 1957‚Ä¢ OLZEWSKI was extremely hostile and flatly

refused to enter into a discussion regarding GABRIEL MANNARINO

emphasizing that she was absolutely inno position to furnish

information regarding his activities. She again flatly

(denied ever accompanying GABRIEL MANNARINO on out-of-town

trips and made it very clear that she did not want to become

involved with anything that had anything to do with the

MANNARINO brothers.

OLZEWSKI explained that she is nearing

the completion of her apprenticeship at the Kaufmann Beauty

Salon and will soon receive her license after which she fully

intends to leave the city with one of her co-workers to open

a beauty shop, possibly in Florida.

Following the interview on March 11, 1958, several attempts

were made by the interviewing agents to make an appointment

with OLZEWSKI for an interview either at her home in

GLassmere, ra.:

or at the Pittsburgh office but she absolutely

refused to meet or cooperate with the interviewing agents.

In view of OLZEWSKI's attitude, no further attempts will be

made to develop her as an informant.
