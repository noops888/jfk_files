& fairly reliabie source, in a report dated 7 August 1963,
stated that she did not think FERNANDEZ was a Conmunist es he
bas always had Catholic tendencies but that he de a correct
soldier and puts the rilitary above everything. He is divorced
acd his ex-wife is living in Miami with their two daughters,
Francis, born in 1951, and Alic$e, bora in 1955.

- re) A
& source who is a &igh ranking Cuban military]Jofficer who has
good contacts among Cuban officials (be has not submitted many
reports, but they appear to have been accurate) reported in
September 1963 that Major Jose Ramon FERNANDEZ Alvarez, Chief
of Training, General Staff of the Cuban Rebel Arsy, is anti-
Communist and a military type in the strictest sense of the
word. He sticks to his military duties acd scrupulously
ayoids politic: he keeps himself completely isolated from
all political elements. He ia proud of his present status
and thankful to CASTRO for it; for fear of losing it he
appears uhwilling to undertake any kind of activity against
the CASTRO regime. CASTRO is undoubtedly knowledgeable of
FEANANDEZ' attitude and has sufficient confidence in him to.
Fetain him in his present position. CASTRO also is aware
that he has few officers with the military discipAine, --
know-how, and experience possessed by FERNANDEZ.
