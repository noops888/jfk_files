Ms. Penelope Grenoble, Editor

Los Angeles Free Press

5850 Hollywood Boulevard . 1

‘Los Angeles, California 90028

Dear Ms. Grenoble:

This letter is in response to the distortions and outright falsities.
printed about’ me in the article written by William Ww. Turner, titled.
BANK ROBBER,  'NANCHURIAN CANDIDATE’ LINKED TO JFK ASSASSINATION PROBE,
which appeared in the July 25-31 edition of tne Los Angeles Free Press

I request that the Free Press either print a retraction of such. Lies =
and distortions or publish this letter.

Mr. Turner, who spent ten years as a Special Agent of the FBI, is not»
unfamiliar to me. He has authored similar articles, both during my a
imprisonment in the United States and while I was detained in the
German Democratic Republic, in which he knowingly and purposefully

- cited numerous lies about me. He has proved himself adept at putting
words in my mouth and misquoting his sources of information to lend
credence to his major untruths, 2 skill he provably developed while ©
serving with the Bureau's intelligence-security division. © His recent
claims cause me to wonder whether or not he ever left the FBI. ‘

Professor Richard H. Popkin, from whom Mr. Turner obviously tollected

much of his latest baloney, is a character that feel should either

purchase a ‘hearing aid or consult a psychiatrist. Each of my. so- 4

called discussions with him (all but one occurred over the telepho:

were duly tape-recorded by me, and if he did in fact assert” “what” Mi
. furner has attributed to him about me, then he a liar.

I am listing the following facts in rebuttal tq \the T rner-Popkin
fables

The "papers" that I “carried” when arrested did\not show me to be a

“decorated hero of the Korean War," nor did they\reyéal anything
.about "a career in Army intelligence." More to the point, the docu-
ments found in my possession and under my coritrol (some of which were)
returned’ to me only last year by the FBI) ensured: my incarceration i
for a longer period than I had anticipated. .They also Suaranteed my
being held practically incommunicado for many months (for eleven '
months I was not even pérmitted to read.a newspaver), not to mention
the curtailment of my most basic constitutional safeguards.

My contacts with Lee Harvey Oswald did not entail any “friendship,”
nor were they effected for the purpose of establishing rapport.

After my acquittal (in 1968, not in 1967) I did not "drop from sight,

annie ine



13-00000

as Mr. Turner, the FBI and the CIA damn wel, knows

I have never stated to anybody, : either verbally or in writing, that
in 1963 I was an agent for the CIA, although in 1974 I did state,
under oath, that I thought I had been functioning for the CIA during

spart of 1963. Mr. “Purner is also aware that less than two months

after President Kennedy's death FBI agents confronted me with their
suspicion that I had “acted as.an unregistered agent for a foreign

ower," inferring that I was a spy for one of the Cuban intelligence | |
P

services (several years later the CIA, through one of its “former"
ease officers, accused me of having been a Soviet. spy: still later,
one FBI agent suggested that I had worked for the Chinese).

The registered letter that was dispatched at my instance to FBI
Director J. Edgar Hoover in September 1963 (not necessarily on the

°13th) revealed sufficient details to warrant an immediate investiga-

tion (if. not the arrest) of Lee Harvey Oswald and two. Cuban refugees.

I certainly "assumed" that some “action” would be taken by. the. FBI.

I was not the least bit “frantic” about anything in September 1963.
I did not set foot inside the Republic of Cuba during that month.

fo my knowledge I have never talked to any "Castro aides." The main
distinction between some American intelligence officers that .I knew
and hired killers were the procedures utilized in murdering their
victims and/or the methods used to disassociate’ pheno ee and the -
U. S. government from their crimes. :

I. had no fear of being implicated "in the. planned assassination" <

-the time of my arrest or prior thereto.

“fhe two letters that I mailed to James _L. Rankin, General Counsel to

I have never claimed. that I “squirreled away a snapshot of (mysel.

Bank robber, ‘Manchurian Candidate’

linked to JFK assassination probe

ED. NOTE: Recent exposure of
what many consider to be im-
proper CIA activity, both at
home and abroad, has
reawakened interest in decade-
old'challenges to official ver-
sions of the assassinations of
* Jahn Kennedy, Robert Kennedy
and Martin Luther King. As new.
facts also begin to emerge,
Congress taces growing
Pressure ta reinvestigate the

- JFK assassination.

What follows are the strange
Stories, disclosed here tor the
first time, of two figures —
Richard Case Nagel! and Luis
Angel Castillo — long of interest:
to assassination researchers.

WILLIAM W. TURNER
— On Sept.
20, .1963, a.rangy man with a
verfical scar on ‘his forehead

_ Strode into the State National

Bank in El Paso, Tex., and re-

- quested $100 in travelers’

schecks. Before the teller could
comply, he whipped out a pisto!
and fired two shots into the ceil-
ing. Then he waited to be
arrested.

Police quickly realized that
the suspect, Richard Case
Nagell, 32, was no ‘ordinary
bank robber. Papers he carried
showed that he was a decorated

~ hero of the Korean War who had

gone on to a career’ in Army
Intelligence before being dis-
charged with the rank of captain
in 1959.

Why had he petted the non-
robbery?

Last. week Or. Richard H.

Popkin, a philosophy professor

at Washington University in St. :

Louis, stepped off a plane in the
nation's capital lugging a brief-
ase containing documents -il-
luminating the strange case of
the man who shot a bank. Also
crammed into the briefcase was
a thick sheaf of papers relating
to a bizarre “Manchurian Can-
didate” episode in the Philip-
pines in 1967.

Both the El Paso and Manila
incidents, Popkin: said-in an in-
terview before ‘leaving for
Washington, were linked to the
Dallas assassination of John F.
Kennedy on Nov. 22, 1963. They
would “crack the case wide

« open,” he predicted.

The slight, bearded academi-
cian was stopping in
Washington to present his dis-
coveries. to Attorney General
Edward Levi and the Senate
Select Committee on
Intelligence Activities before go-
ing on to a conference of learn-
ed philosophers.

The Second Oswald

Popkin is no stranger to the
“JFK investigation. In. 1966 he
published The Second Oswald,
which chronicled several in-
stances of someone imper-
sonating the man later accused
of slaying the president. At the
time the book gained scant
attention, but recently it was dis-
closed that as early as June 3,
1960, FB! Director J. Edgar
Hoover himself .wrote an in-
terdepartmental_ memorandum

citing evidence of an- Oswald ©.

imposter. The FBI knew Oswald
at that
Russia,- and, some conspiracy
theorists believe, as a possible
CIA agent.

Popkin said he had. been in
touch with Richard Nagell, now
living near San Diego, and had
learned about Nagell’s
friendship with Lee Harvey
Oswald. Nageli has fascinated
assassination researchers ever
since an FBI report filed with the
Warren Commission. quoted
him as saying he had met with
Oswald in Mexico.City and Tex~
as. But the former intelligence
officer had been inacessibie. He.
remained in prison for the Et
Paso caper until his conviction
was reversed for insufficient
evidence in 1967, after which he
dropped from sight.

Nagell’s Version

Nevertheless, researchers.
were able to glean some picture
of Nagell's significance from his
defense pleadings and cryptic»
letters from prison. ee

In August 1963 Nagell, work~
ing as a CIA agent, learned of a
domestic plot to assassinate the
president, involving Oswald and
anti-Castro ‘Cubans. He in-

fe as a defector to.

formed his CIA superior . but .

feared nothing would be done
because he lacked details. On
Sept. 13 he dispatched a letter
warning J. Edgar Hoover of the
plot but again assumed no ac-

tion would be taken.
As Nagell understood. it,
Kennedy was to be shot.in
(please, turn to page 33)



. INATION

(continued trom’, _,2 4)
Washington about Sept. 26 (as
it turned out, JFK left Sept. 25
for a whirlwind tour of the West).
Frantic, Nagell flew to Havana
on Sept. 19 to see if Castro
aides could shed light on the
assassination plot, but the only
advice they could offer was to:
execute Oswald In the hope that
would stop the plan,

- But Nagell left Cuba deciding
that he “was an intelligence
agent, not a killer.” Flying to El
* Paso via Mexico City, he walked
into the bank the next day for
“the sole purpose of having
myself arrested and detained by
federal authorities" — ap-
parently. fearing that his
association with Oswald would

implicate himself in the planned .

assassination.
Nagell was in the Ei Paso Jail
when Kennedy was shot In
* Dallas two months later. He sent
an offer to testity before the
Warren Commission through
“private channels” but received
no reply.
Dedicated Leftist
In his recent discussions with
Popkin, Nageil has revealed
new details about Oswald. He
first met Oswald, he said, in the
late fifties at the U.S. naval base
at Atsugi, Japan, where Oswald
was a Marine Corps radar
_ Specialist. They became friends
but didn’t encounter one
another again until August 1963

when Nagell learned of the plot ”

against Kennedy.

‘Disputing claims that Oswald
had ties with the CIA, Nagell
belleves that Oswald was a
dedicated leftist who was duped
by anti-Castro exiles involved in
the conspiracy. Posing as
Castro G-2 intelligence agents,
the exiles wheedied Oswald into
becoming a “fall guy” by playing
on his Castro sympathies, pain-
ting Kennedy as anti-Castro and
promising that he would be
Spirited to Havana after the
assassination.

Nagel! told Popkin he met
with Oswald both in Mexico Clty
and New Orleans, hotbeds of
the anti-Castro movement.
“Nagell claims he has squirrel-
ed away a snapshot of himself
with Lee Harvey Oswald taken
in Jackson Square in New

Orleans in 1963," Popkin as-

‘serted. “in the picture are two
other men, both anti-Castro
Cubans, who were pretending

if this photograph does exis‘
it would tend credibility” to
Nagell's account. And Na” is.
willing to surface and te ais
‘story to Congress, Popkin says,
provided protective conditions
are met.

“Manchurian Candidate”

Popkin is also convinced that
the Manila “Manchurian Can-
didate” case was connected to
the JFK assassination. On
March 2, 1967, a man named
Luis Angel Castillo.was detain-
‘ed by the Philippine National
Bureau of Investigation after he
had contacted left-wing - Huk
guerrillas. Questioned under
truth serum and hypnosis.
Castillo blurted out a tale of hav-
Ing been taken to a building in
Dallas, Tex., the day Kennedy
was shot, handed a rifle
assembled from components
hidden in a bowling bag and in-
Structed to fire at a man in an
open car sitting next to a lady.
The signal to fire would be given
by mirror flashes.

The story caused a brief sen-
sation at the time. The Manila
Times bannered: “ ‘JFK Plotter’
in Manila!" Wire service dis-
patches to. the United States
said Castillo was a “Cuban-
trained Communist agent" who
hadn't shot because he heard
that a man named Joe “had
already shot the man in the
open car.” The story was so im-
plausible that it quickly died.

Not long ago the hypnotist
who conducted the interroga-
tion of Casilio for the Philippina
authorities arrived in this coun-
try under the name’ Vincente R.
Sanchez. When Popkin took a
fook at his reports, his eyes
popped.

The reports termed Castillo a
“zombie — a hyp-
noprogrammed robot.

Double-Agent Network

Sanchez extracted Castillo's
tambiing story over a period of
weeks. Castillo, then 28, was in-
ducted around 1960 into a
“Special Operations Group”
which afforded him paramifitary
training. In 1961 he participated
in the Bay of Pigs invasion, as a
pilot for the CIA. Thereafter he
infiltrated a double-agent
network, posing as a Com--
munist in Venezuela and {i-
quidating a. Communist agent in
Mexico. :

In talking about the JFK
assassination, Castillo —'
despite some disjointed
phrases — was nevertheless
able to describe in some detail

ordered, “They got him already.
Let's get out of here.” After the
rifle was disassembled and
stuffed in the bowling bag, he
was hustled into the car which
had brought him to tne building.
It stopped twice within blocks to
pick up other men.

In 1967, according to
Sanchez, Castillo was
programmed to assassinate
Philippine President Ferdinand
Marcos after openly associating
with the leftist Huks — which
would implicate them in the
assassination. Popkin points
out that this is a similar ploy to
the one Nagell attributed to the
anti-Castro Cubans’ use of
Oswald.~

Until recently, the Castitia
episode might have seemed a
logcial impossibility. But the
release of the Rockefeller
Report, with its revelations.
about secret CIA projects to in-
duce behavior modification in
unsuspecting subjects, make
the possibility of a “Manchurian
Candidate” more than mere
fantasy. (In the Robert Kennedy
assassination, Dr. Bernard Dia
mond, who examined Sirhan
Sirhan for the defense, testified
that he believed Sirhan was
hypnotized at the time of the
shooting.)

Although the current
whereabouts of Castillo is un-
known, the Sanchez reports
contain the names of six per-
sons who supposedly ran his
network, including the “control
officer” and a woman who hyp-
notized him. Popkin's own in-
vestigations have shown that
these peaple do exist.

Through Popkin their stories”

have now been passed on to the
Attorney General and the
Church Committee.

William Turner's latast book,
The Cuba Project, the story of
the CIA's secret war against
Castro, will be published this talt
by Houghton Mifflin.

SUBJECT: NAGELL, Richard Case

ALLEGATION:

Richard Case NAGELL,.“a
highly decorated infantry
Captain in the Korean War",
alleges that he became a
CIA agent. He said he
fired the gun in the bank at-
El Paso, Texas because he
wanted to be in custody when
the assassination of
President KENNEDY took
place. NAGELL charged
that "the FBI illegally
seized. from him evidence
erucial to his defense,
such as notebooks containing
the names of certain CIA
employees, photographs, two
Mexican tourist cards (one
in the name of Joseph KRAMER,
the other in the name of
Albert HIDEL) and receipts for
registered mail, including the one
for the letter sent HOOVER ~
warning of the assassination.
NAGELL: daimed he was in-
structed to "arrow" the
patsy, that is kill him
(OSWALD) after the assassi-
nation. He contended he
got cold feet and this was
his reason for the attempted
bank robbery, he would rather
be arrested than commit
murder and treason.The
article alleges that while it
was suggested in court that
an airplane crash NAGELL.
survived mentally affected him,
he was given intelligence
training after the crash.

- Also, NAGELL complains he has

been salted away because of
what he knows.

18 Jatiouey 1968

CIA CONNECTION:

None; although, Subject was of
interest to 0S in 1964 and early
1965 because of information
furnished ‘to the Agency by the
FBI that he had in his. possession
the names of six CIA employees
at the time of his arrest for bank
robbery at El Paso, Texas on 20
September 1963.



13-00000

SOURCE:

1968 RAMPARTS
Article by Willian
W. TURNER

QS INDICES RESULTS:

Subject became of interest to the Office of Security in March 1964
when the FBI informed the Agency that Subject had in his possession at
the time of his arest for bank robbery at El Paso, Texas on 20 September
1963 the name of Richard FECTEAU (an individual by this name was captured
by the Chinese Commmists and is now in prison in China) and of six Agency
employees. Research failed to reveal any reason why NAGELL had these
names in his possession. It was concluded that while NAGELL is unquestionably
unbalanced, his story of being involved in espionage is not fully contradicted
by evidence. He could have been contacted by a Soviet agent while in Washington,
D. C. in December 1962 or while he was in Mexico City in September and October
1962. His. file contains mostly FBI reports dated 1962 and 1964 and in these
are documented his history of mental instability and physical complaints
stemming foam the plaecrash. .Attached is:a chronology dated 3 March 1965
made from the information contained in the FBI reports. At the time this
security research was conducted, it was recommended that NAGELL be personally
interviewed by a representative of OS in the hope that NAGELL might reveal
how he came into the possessi: ese names but no further action is indicated
in his file and this interview was not undertaken.

DETAILS:
Subject's file reflects no Agency interest in him prior to March 1964

when the names of CIA employees were found in his possession when arrested
for bank robbery.

The RAMPARTS claim that he received intelligence. training after the plane...

erash is true. The crash‘occurred 28 November 1954 and he graduated from

Army Intelligence School, Ft. Holabird, Maryland on 15 August 1955. He

served in Korea and Japan as a member of the U. 6S. Army Counterintelligence
Corps, terminating-about 1958. A Lt. Col. Ned W. GLENN who served with

NAGELL personally in Korea advised that NAGELL was not stable mentally and
that this instability was probably due to brain damage suffered in the airplane
crash. :

The RAMPARTS article's claim that NAGELL said he fired the gun in the

‘bank at El Paso, Texas because he wanted to be in custody when the assassination

took place is not completely in conflict with a statement NAGELL made on
1 January 1964 which was, however, after the assassination. (see page 4 of

The RAMPARTS article's allegation. that the FBI took from NAGELL a note-~

An editor of 8 trade journel, ‘whom I first met. while on oy
“an 1 intelligence asvignnent in batia America, has urged me.
“tor some .time to - make public .the facts dealing with my: :
: vinvolvement in a. conspiracy. to murder the late Chief
Executive, Joba Fe Kennedy, in 1963 and the .circumstances
surrounding. my arrest and imprisonment’ in the, United States
and East. Germany. For reasons that, are more personal than
» advisable I can think of little else that I would like to do
better. Bat with the copious amount of documentation and S

- to in any valid treatise of. the subject, it would require ~
“writing no-less’ than @ tome, an undertaking for which I am =
hardly qualified. Then, too, there is a growing skepticism
on my pert. concerning the kind of reception that ‘a topic of
this sort would elicit ‘from a society long since inured to ~
‘violence, corruption and injustice. Still, after over six
“years of relative silence, I've decided that I must say .
something about all .this, if only to answer ‘the lies and
distortions concocted about me in the press.. Thus, I have
compiled this small booklet, a throwaway,. which ‘nay be
easily. discarded’ at the ‘whim of the reader. In it I've
“taken the liberty to set forth a reproduction of one of the

his citing a substantial number of inaccuracies, has nonetheless depicted a vast areé of
what may be termed the fundamental truth. With this in mind, I-have tried to set|the
record straight only insofar as it’ pertains. to ‘those inaccuracies - and omissions

In order to view Mr. Lucey's account in a somewhat different perspective, I shall
begin by advising that I first went. to work for the Central Intelligence Agency much
earlier than August 1962. It was during the winter of 1955-56, while assigned as a Case
Review. Officer with the Counter Intelligence: Corps at Los Angeles, that I was initially
recruited into- the CIA's farflung network.of informants and agents, one of a. number] I
suppose, within the Defense Department's .intelligence community who helped the Agency
_ keep an eye on its not always tame competitor. My recruitment was, handled by a Herbert
‘Leibacher, ‘an agent of the ClA‘'s Los Angeles office, and.a Joe DaVanon, later identified
‘to me through photographs. as en official from CIA headquerters, then loceted on/"E"

: latreet in Washington, D.C. Motiveted by a degree of naivete and the Agency's subtle

eminders' that I owed a greater duty. to my country than to the military establishment, I
ieerved as a- non-paid, confidential informant off and on until my resignation from |the
Army.in October 1959. A complete destription of the information I supplied to the Agency
‘during 1 my military career would only add to what must perforce become a lengthy addendum;
“may it suffice to say chat it_did not always seem germane to intelligence affairs, lbut
when it did it consisted mainly of an assortment of data that for so-called discretionary
reasons was seldom passed on to the . Agency. (or for that matter, to our own higher
echelons). through regular channels.

Mr. Lucey's statement, “Being merried “to a foreign national meant an automatic
removal from intelligence work so Nage]1 decided to leave the Army," is misleading jand
incorrect in its entirety. The only military intelligence organization from which an
individual is normally removed subsequent to marrying a foreign national is the CIC -

sensitive, MI organizations such as Field Operations’ Intelligence, then the clandestine
espionage department of military intelligence. - As for the reasons I left the Army, they
were clearly if euphemisticelly explained in my second letter of resignation, dated
81 August 1959, namely: "I desire to tender my resignation because I wish to further my.’
civilian education. It. is not possible for me to pursue the curriculum of which I am”
desirous while on active duty. Also, compessionate reasons of a personal nature exist
for desiring to tender my resignation at this time." ae

My Patronege under the CIA did not end with my. discharge from the Army and ensuing
employment in. December 1959 as an investigator forthe State of California; in fact,
henceforth I was offered-remuneration for my services, however nominal it sometimes was.
‘What my new .taske . comprised is of no real pertinence to this addendum or to later

_ developments, except perhaps to mention that one of my. contacts said he worked out of

"Domestic Intellirence," possibly the forerunner of the present-day Domestic Operations
Division, which. illegally keeps tabs on a wide range of American civilian organizations
and activities. I should also point out that I did not quit my position with the State
of California “to work for the CIA," as implied by Mr. Lucey. I was dismissed, in June
$1962, at my own option and in my opinion for doing my job. (The following month I wes
‘shot through the right chest during an altercation with a person whose identity I have
“never disclosed ... . not through the left chest by myself, my wife, an Alcoholic
.Beverage Control. inspector then under investigation or by a Los Angeles police officer
"because of communistic implications," as has been reported at verious times by various
sources). :

For the next year, from approximately the middle of August 1962 until my arrest in



13-00000

(
Texas on 20 September 191, I was employed by, the ‘agency in-a-capecity which can be
aécirately described as that of an egent, in every sense of the word. My assignménts
_ varied and necessitated travel to three Latin American nations and many states, .inclu ing
the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. They also necessitated my taking on cover employment
. for one week in’ New York and for about ten weeks in Los Angeles, though usually I Dpeed
as a tourist, an investigator for" the’ Immigration & Naturalization Service or 4s a
‘researcher for a private firm, the appropriate credentials being. furnished to me by|the
CIA... To sum it up briefly, I operated in Mexico City at the onset of the Cuban Missile
‘Crisis in an effort aimed chiefly at. the Soviet government; I conducted inquities
relative to "dissident": members of several Cuban refugee groups based in the United
States; I checked out’ an’ alleged connection between a Miami resident named Eladio |Del:
Valle and New Orleans CIA informant Sergio Arcacha=Smith; I investigated an associate of
- the now deceased right-wing .extremist David Ws Ferrie of New Orleans, as I did|the~
-activities. of left-wingers Vaughn L. Snipes’ and his wife, Priscille, near Venice,
California, and others; JI conducted a surveillance-on a man, said to have been an ex-=CIA
employee, observed talking to MRP leader Manuel Artime and former Cuban senator/racketeor
Rolando Masferrer; I inquired into an allegation that Marina Oswald intended. to divorce
her husband and return to the U.S.S.R. (although I never stated that I. met her personally,
a8 was reported by the FBI and Secret Service); and I performed courier duties and acted |
“as accut-out. At the time of my arrest I was operating in an undercover ‘role, having
become ‘involved in a. domestic-inspired plot to assassinate President Kennedy and,
leastwiae ostensibly, other highly-placed government officials. :

:: MF. Lucey goes on to state that my lest assignment at ‘the time “was to penetrate |the
Fair Play for Cuba Committee, where he met Oswald." Such statement is also incorrect. -I
“was never a member, bona-fide or otherwise,-of the FPCC. | And my conversations with HPCC
functionaries like Steve Roberts, -an .official of the Socialist Workers Party at Loa.
Angeles, could hardly: be construed as a penetration. Furthermore, I had been introduced
to Mr. Oswald long before the FPCC came into. existence, albeit under an assumed name.

As to the allusion that. I. told "Bob" I was an intelligence man, not a killer,
therefore: I couldn't: kill Mr. ‘Oswald, while the reference is true its connotation) is.
deceptive. I had killed before. and I had participated in homicides under the auspices; of
both MI and the CIA (one instance being the part I. played in the February 1958 abductipn- §
interrogation-murder of an FOI agent, a U.S. soldier, MSCT Emmett E. Dugan, from Crafton,
“Pas, suspected of. having defected in place to the Chinese), under the guise that; an
American variation: of the Soviet “wet affair” was the only alternative, that it was
either essential to some overall intelligence effort or in the best interests of our.
jnational security.’ And it was a similar-sounding argument, ultimately reduced to a...
threat, that was advanced to me by Robert Graham.as an incentive.to dispose of Mr. Oswald |
jin September 1963. . But my refusal to do so had absolutely no bearing on“the reason for
effecting my arrest in the manner I chose,..nor did it engender in me fear of reprisal by
ithe CIA. : : ale

Pertaining to my arrest. and convictions at El Paso, Texas, which the official
spokesmen andthe press have so neatly labeled as being for “bank robbery," let one of
the government's own spurious records,. the appelate court decision that finally yawned a |
judgement of acquittal in my case, give its version: “The charge was then, and is now, .
entering a federally insured bank with intent to rob." What the record aptly ignores is
the. fact that two juries, incensed by the prosecution's innuendoes in and out of the
courtroom (and by the ramifications of perjured testimony and a false Bureau of Prisons
“report made available to the jury during its deliberations at the second trial - though
never formally ‘admitted into evidence) that I was a Communist, no doubt a very red spy,
‘twice convicted me of having ,"intended" to take by force and violence one hundred dollars
worth of Travelers Cheques from a benk teller. . oe

i I shall ‘not herein’ attempt to list even generally the injustices to which I was
subjected by a corrupt judicial system, nor shall I bother-to enumerate the cruelties

“Writ Of Habeas Corpus, sworn to and subscribed before William R. Martin (a former member
of the CIA's Dirty Tricks Division, who by his own admission is still in “the reserve 8").
But I shall opine that if President Kennedy had not met his demise when and where he dia,
I would not have been brought to trial on charges of commiting'a felony.

While my return to the fold of the CIA in May 1968 may have been the only “practilcal
"thing" for me to do, it definitely was not predicated on my financial situation, as a lfew
old bank account passbooks will substantiate (I am not quite the mercenary that lr. Lucey
;.has-portrayed). Nor was it ‘because of any peculiar allegiance to those who had tossed me |

on the scrap heap for the sake of expediency 44 years earlier, love of country, ion a
tic tendencies or wont of further intrigue. . And’ while it remains axiomatic in my. mind
that the sole requisite for. one's use by the Agency is his qualification to fit into
whatever may happen to be.the scheme of things, even this did not apply in| my
circumstance, not really. I agreed to go back out into the cold, so to speak, strictly
for personal reasons and I think the explanation is wisely left at that for now.

bi My mission inside East. Germany - if indeed it wes a mission - was neither as well-
defined nor as elementary as Mr. Lucey tas perceived. I am sure the CIA knows alll it
needs to know about American defectors in Berlin and the modus operandi of the MfS. In
; fact, the mission was net directed against East Germany, per se. . Preparations bore the
trademarks of an authentic, even typical, Agency project targeted in the main to another
netion. That I was unable to comprehend the German language, that I had been a recent,
i unwilling guest of the U.S. Attorney General, branded a Communist in the public records,
: etc., merely served to strengthen an already plausible cover built up by chance rather
| than by design. Paradoxically, the chinks in the armor were that the cover was hot
wholly untrue, ‘the MfS (unlike the FBI) not in the least irresponsible to the laws and
policies of its government. In the past I had engaged in certain covert intelligence
activities hositle to other socialist states, to which - as an integral part of |ny
cover - I freely confessed. Oddly enough, however, my mentors from Langely had neglected
to tell me during the briefings that these previous activities constituted a violationjof
the criminal statutes of the GDR, warranting @ maximum penalty of death upon conviction. ©
By inadvertence or by plan I found myself in a not altogether unfamiliar predicament. |If
I had confessed to my real mission,: assuming that it was genuine, without doubt I a

have been spared execution, probably even escaped long-term imprisonment. Instead,
selected what I considered to be a better alternative... . and gained my freedom. we
for my treatment by the MfS, from begining to end it was far more gentle than that
experienced beneath the cudgel of the U.S. Department of Justice. : Bene eee | seri

i
i With regard to my marital status and my.children, the foremost area that Mr. Lucey
appears to have exploited, I have never claimed that "Uncle Sam hides my, family" or. |.
[eee that FBI and CIA agenta- ‘deliberately isolated me from my wife and children; nor

| have I claimed that the Agency used the promise of reuniting me with my family as part of

j the incentive for accepting the assignment.in the GDR. My accusations in this respect

‘ contered around my children .and they were leveled at. the State Department as the result
“pot a promise made to me shortly after. my release from the GDR. Since returning to the

| United States last spring a reliable source has informed me that my wife wes granted a
: final decree of divorce at some period during my imprisonment in the USA and although I
ihave never deen served with a copy of the decree or other notification of divorce (or
notice of a divorce hearing) I g9¢ no cause to dispute the advisement... :

Lastly, concerning the aspersions cast on my sanity, at this writing permit me to

: | jay only that. I have never. in my life been certified psychotic by any U.S. medical

jauthority or adjudicated montally-incompetent in a.court of law, notwithstanding the

conflicting legal. and medical opinions as to my mental condition on the day of ny orrest

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD:
SUBJECT: NAGELL, Richard Case -. #264170

REF: State Dept. Airgram No. A-903 from Berlin - Subject: Psychiatrist's
Report ‘on Richard Case NAGELL, U. S. Citizen Released by GDR

Reference airgram furnishes background information on Subject and
fills in gaps in the chronology of events in Subject's life of interest
to the Agency. Of particular note is the fact that Subject was acquitted
on 29 April 1968 after his.claim of temporary insanity at the time of
the crime found support in the expert testimony of a noted American
neurologist, Dr.-Edwin WEINSTEIN. An article in the January 1968 issue
of RAMPARTS by William W. TURNER implied that NAGELL had been involved
in the assassination plot against President KENNEDY and that he had been
“salted away". Subject denied any involvement in any conspiracy and denied
that he had any information of use to GARRISON. Subject alleged that his
fear that the CIA might try to “eliminate” him was planted in his mind by
Mr. GARRISON. (See page 2.of interview report). On page 3 of the interview
report Subject states he no longer believes that it is realistic to think that the

Berlin who in’ ewed Subject, was granted a continuing Liaison clearance -.- ~<"%
on 17 October 1968 « at the request of DDP/E/G/IS.

Dr. Edwin Ss security approved as a continuing contact—
through SECRET for the Medical Staff on 13 July 1965. WEINSTEIN is with the

interview, the Washington, D.C. law firm of NEW, MACKEY and

GEORGE. Newspaper. clippings from the WASHINGTON STAR for 17 March 1966

and the NEW YORK TIMES for 29 August 1965 reflect that NICEY has been
associated with East Berlin attorney, Wolfgang VOGEL and West Berlin

attorney, Juergen STANGE, in a number of cases involving the release

of Americans from East Germany. According to an FBI report dated 3

February 1967 these releases usually involved the payment of specified -
sums of money and VOGEL and STANGE were allegedly reaping large monetary
benefits for their services.

5. In December 1962 ané January 1963 Nagell was examined
at the VA hospital at Bay Pines, Florida. The diagnosis was
“chronic brain syndrome agsocieted with brain trauma with behavioral
reaction characterized by passive aggreséive and paranoid features."
{An FBI memorandum of 12 June 1964 noted that Nagell was considered
mentally disturbed by his mother, hie brother, an ex-wife, anda
friend. The mother, who said that she bad been under psychiatric care
fox several yeara, described Subject's brother, Louis, as an almost
hopelees alcoholtc. )

6. On 20 September 1963 Subject was arrested in El Pago,
Texas, on the charge of having tried to. sob the State National Bank.
‘A ceil mate concluded from Subject's remarke that he had become a
Communist Party member after his digcharge from the army, that he
had attempted suicide thres times after hie arrest, and that he had made
arrangements with the GP in Los Angelis to pick up his passport in
El Paso so that he could go to Czechoslovakia.

7. Ine letter of 6 January 1964 Nagell advised the FBI in
El Paso that in September of 1963 he hed been instracted by an agent
of a foreign government to comply with an agreement made in May 1963
to participate in a criminal offense againat the U.5.. or be exposed to
the FEL it was this threat, said Nagell, that ied him to try to hold up the

bank. The veference appeare te be te the agsastination of President
Kennedy. At any rates sometime after the sateasination Nagell claimed ~

that he had known both Oswald.and his wife. Pictures of Nagell were
shown to Marina Oswald on 18 January 1964. She said that ghe did mot
‘know him,

8. At the thme of his arrest Subject had in hia possession a
notebook which made reference to "Medical Aid to Cuba", the “Fair
Play for ‘Cuba Committee," the names of six persons alleged tobe
GIA agentes, and other information. The FBl informed the Office of
Security on 12 March 1964 that at the time of Arrest Nagel also had a
Met of elx names, marked CIA. The names were I‘, Parker, Mra.
Guthries,.C.. Churchill, 3. Sloss, E. Leibacher, and}. Davanon, ft
was later determined that Richard Fecteau alao appeared on this list,
where he was marked as “Lynn, Maes.", and "BAC (CIA)".

se

a. Our records show that Richard G. Fecteau was
aboard an American plane shot down over Manchuria in
November 1952 and that he ie serving in Pelping a twenty

| year sentence on spy charges. . Fecteau, an OPC employee,
wat quoted in the press as saying that he worked for CIA.

b. F. Parker was not identified. He may possibly be
Jebn Floyd Parker, an Agency employee in 1964 who was in
Japan in 1962.

€. There is no pertinent identifiable information about
Mre. fnu Guthries, She may be Frances Agnes Guthric, an
Agency employee in 1964.

a. GC. Churchill was uot identified. He may be Greighton
Churchill, whe waa in Japan in 1952,

@. J. Sloe may be John Richard Sloss, an Agency
employee in 1964.

é. E. Leibacher could be identical with Ernst Leibacker
who in 1964 wae in the Los Angeles field office of the DCS.

g- J. Davanon may refer to Joseph Frances Davanon,
also in the Los Angeles Held office at the time. 2

9. John Floyd Parker, Frances Guthrie, Ernst Lelbacker, .
Joseph Frances Davanon, ard John Richard Sloss all stated te the best
af their knowledge they had never met Nagell. It is possible, however,
that Magell knew or knew of Parker, Gharchill, and Guthrie through
their work in the Far Ezat.. Ac for Leibacker and Davanon, Nagel)
Mved in Los Angeles in 1962.

10. On 16 April 1964 Nagell sent to the FBI a letter claiming »
that in September 1963 he had sent to the Bureau a registered letter
signed "Jack Kramer". The 1964 letter implied that the 1963 letter
had warned the FBI about the impending assassination. The FBI, of
course, did not receive such @ letter.

il. In January 1968 William T. Turner stated in an article. in
Ramparts, "The Garrison Commission on the Assassination of



13-00000

President Kennedy", p. 56, that Nagell was then etill confined

at Leavenworth, that he had been a highly decorated infantry captain
in the Korean War, and that he clalmed to have become.a CIA agent
thereafter. Ramparta shifted the plane crash in which Nagell was
injured from 195¢ and Maryland to 1957 and Cambodia. The article
repeated the allegation that he staged a phony holdup in order to be
under arreat when the assassination occurred.

12. On 6 June 1968 the American Consulate in Zurich cabled
Washington to say that Richard Cane Nagell, passport J 543069, had
appeared at the consulate on 4 June and had said that he was working
for a secret U.S. Government agency on a mission to Geneva, where
he was to meet some Japanese. He asked for money. He returned to
the consulate the next day, was incoherent, and seemed psychetic. He
claimed that on 14-16 May 1968 he had been interviewed by District
Attorney Jim Garrison. He said that Garrison had warned him that he
was in danger of being killed and that ho wanted to inform CIA that he
was in Zurich.

13. On 7 September 1968 ancther William Turner piece was
printed by Ramparts under the heading “ / Assaseinations / Epstein's
Garrison.” it referred to Nagell as a former U.5. intelligence agent
and repeated much the same story that it had teld in January. Turner
and Ramparts may have been unaware that Nagell was out of jail by then.

14. On 25 October 1968 the Washington Post reported that aftes—---°--~
holding Nageli for four months, the East Germans had released him
on 23 October at an Kast-West Berlin crossing-point. Negell left-by
plane for the U.S. on 25 October. “Informed sources” said that Nagell
was taken off a train en route through East Germany to Berlin because
he made some remarke which the East Germans considered derogatory,

15. On 31 October 1968 State forwarded the text of 2 report by a
U. &. Army péychiatrist who examined Nagell on 23 October. Nagell
said that he was on active duty with the army from 1948 to 1959 and that
from 1953 to 1959 he was an officer in military intelligence. He also
provided accurate information about the 1954 plane crash and ite results -+
among them, in his own words, his "unstable persouality and immature
or ‘impulsive behaviour". He said that he draws 64% disability pay. He
lost bie job in California because one night in 1962, while drunk, he tried
to break down the door of the apartment of his estranged wife.

After his confused attempt in 1963 to rob the E] Pago bank, he
spent 41/2 yeare in prison. He was examined by Dr. Edwin Weinstein,



13-00000

a noted American. neurologist, ‘who found his electroencephalograms
abnormal, and as a result he was released from prison on 29 April 1968.

Nagell sald that because of the Ramparte article of January 1968 be
was-paid a visit by Jim Garrison. He told Garrison that he had no
information af gny use to him. The interview left him, however, with
twe fears: that Garrison might try to subpcena him and that CIA might
try to "sHminate* him. (By the time he was providing this information
da Berlin Nagell was well aware that he was not involved in any conspiracy
to assassinate President Kennedy.) He said that his fear of CIA was
planted in: hie mind by Mr. Garrison.

After hin release he went to New York, where.a sister Uves. He
was aimout hit by a cax driven without lights and decided to go to Europe
te etcape being killed hy CIA. In June he appeared in Zurich. He next
Set out for. West Berlin but was teken off the train on 11 June 1968.

SIRHAN’S MOTIVES

Unlike Lee Harvey Oswald, Sirhan Sirhan
has lived 10 tlt of his motivations—but he
hax chosen to remain silent, The only other
potential. source of info¥mation is his
© family, which had not spoken to the press.

Mahmoud’ Abdel-Hadl, an Egyptian
correspondent fir Akhbar Elyoum in
Cairo, recently gained access to Sirhan's

ily. Based upon information supplied

the family, he has written exclusive

ly ‘for Ramparts the following account

of Sithan’s motivations and the strategy
he plans for his trial.

Because of the forthcoming trial and
the difficulty of dealing with this subject
without emotional involvement, the editors
of Ramparts have elected to present this
information of historic interest to our
readers without display, and in as ob-
Jective a form as possible.

FCAUSE TAM AN ARAB T was able’ to
B breuk through the barrier of sus-
picion that had ‘stopped other
journalists coll and obtain the first in-
depth interviews the Sirhan family has
given since the assassination, From their
comments and from what Sirhan has said
to them, a picture of the man and his
motives begins to emerge, replacing the
misleading portraits which haveswamped

the U.S. press.
The fact that Sirhan has not publicly
discussed his tri ident. It is his
‘own strittegy.. something he developed
after thinking aboui it for Jong hours in
his specially made jail cell. In fact, he
has contided to his £ that he will
sitement unless speciu!
provisions are made for the courtroom
proceedings. What Sirhan wants is,
i publicity. He wants the
mn networks to be allowed
to broadcast the entire trial. If they do
this, he says, he will tell all. And if they
refuse?" his brother Adel recently asked

voracious reader, Sirhan is confident
about his own ability to cope with his
predicament. His eldest brother, Shereit
told me that Sirhan studies the intrica-
cies of his case as many as ten hours #
day in his cell. Shereif recalls that Sirhan
recently said to him, “I do not need a
lawyer. 1 understand my case und know
how to defend myself."’ But even so,
Attorney Russell Parsons is defending
his client, and doing it on Sirhan’s own
grounds, “The main issue," Parsons told
me, “is to answer this question: why, for
what reason, did Sirhan kill Robert
Kennedy? There are 100 witnesses who
saw Sirhan shooting Mr. Kennedy, but
No one seems to know why he did it.”

Sirhan and his attorney hope that the
defense—presuming that the television
networks are allowed into. the court-
room-—will show that Sirhan did not
have “malice aforethought" in shoot-
ing Kennedy because the act was a polit-.
ical gesture, and that Kennedy, to Sirhan
fat least, was merely a symbol. His
brother Adel notes that “if Sirhan was
just an assassin, he could have done it in
another way, just by having a gun with a
telescope. He went to the Ambassador
Hotel expecting to get caught; that is
why he left his notes at home. I believe
that Sirhan wanted to get caught so that
he could say what he believes.”

HEN I FIRST TRIED to meet with
(WV ste sian hy 1s

-fused, Security is extremely
heavy around them, and they are under-
standably wary of new faces. Later, when
1 finally obtained an invitation to meet
with them, Mrs, Sirhan apologized, I
believe for -having been inhospitable to
a fellow Arab.

This family, which fled Jordan to seek
greater safety and security than it had
known, is now living in terror. They are
somewhat at a loss to understand the
events which have suddenly catapulted
them into history. None of the four
brothers goes to hisjob; they all feel that.
death follows them everywhere, and they
move carefully, with a heavy guard,
“Why don’t you just leave this country?"
Pasked Shercif, “Where shall we go?"
he answered, “To. whom shall we leave
our brother? Our Jand is under Israel's
occupation.” Shereif clarified his state-
ment: “Our brother is in jail; we have to
stay.”

I sensed not only the Sirhans’ con-
fusion, but also some bitterness. They
have not-received any aid from the Arab
countries, as they originally thought they
might. Parsons is’ also somewhat ‘sur-
prised; he had hoped thit the various
local Arab cqnsulates would help defray
court costs. j

Indeed, Los Angeles’ Jordanian con-
sul, who visited Sirhan in jail at Sirhan’s
Tequest, indicated to me that the accused
assassin hadjexpected the Arab people
to treat him as a hero. However, except
for some Palestinian extremists, his act
has been universally repudiated by the
Arab world. One Arab newspaper has
said editorially, “We don’t feel any
responsibility for this. It is the society _
that fed him with hostility, the society
that gave him the gun, that is responsi-
ble.” Members of the Arab Students"
Association, ‘of which ‘Sirhan was once
an officer, feel that the killing of Kennedy
was u terrible mistake. One of them suid

‘What are we going to do. with
the rest of the American candidates? Kill
them all. because they want to help
Tsracl?”

Still, the Sirhans’ friends are primarily
Arab, and they live in an atmosphere
that is more: Arab than American. The
entire fumily spent a good deu! of time
discussing the Arab-Israeli conflict. The
mother says that Sirhan was the most
sensitive and the most involved, during
these discussions. Adel says that Sirhan
once saw a television report of Robert
Kennedy addressing the members of the
Neveh Shalom Temple in Portland,
Oregon. While in the synagogue, Ken-
nedy, wearing a yarmulke, declared that
the United States must help Israel
against aggression from whatever source.

“Unlike the South Vietnamese,” Ken-
nedy said, “the Israelis have shown they
are willing to fight for their own survival.
Indeed, Israel is the very opposite of
Vietnam: the Israeli government is very
democratic, effective and free of corrup-
tion. Its people are united in its support.”
‘The senator then urged the Johnson Ad-
ministration to proceed at once with the
sale of 50’ Phantom jet fighters to: the
taraell Air Force iend to cut off economic
aid to the Arab co this whole
episode made Sichuan very angry, Shereif
recalls, “He left the room putting his

hands on his ears and almost weeping.”

Cancinued from page 6

1 asked Sithun’s mother why she
thought her son had shot Kennedy.
“Everything in this country was helping
Sirhan,” she maintained. “It was push-
ing him to the danger point. Everything,
the propaganda of the Zionists, every-
thing, was against his country, against
his people.”

Adel described Sirhan’s current state
of mind: “He feels he has done a terrible
thing, but he feels now it is too late to be
sorry. Now he wants Americans to listen
to something they have never listened
to.”

And at their first meeting in the jail,
Sirhan’s mother said to him, “Shame on
you, Why have you done such a thing?”
He replied, “It's too kite to speak of it.
But all the Americans will know why."

EPSTEIN'’S GARRISON

WOSUMMERS AGO a tindem attack
T= the Warren Report all but rele-

gated that work to the fiction
seci of your local library. The first
was Mark Lane's Rush to Judgment,
which convincingly demonstrated—us-
ing the’ Warren Commission's own evi-
dence—that Oswald could not have done
it alone, and drew the first dim outlines
of the-conspiracy theory. The second
was.Edwatd Jay Epstein’s Inquest, which
exposed the rather shoddy inner work-
ings of the Commission and laid bare the

tortured logic it finally employed to dis-

pel notions of a conspiracy.

Both books became best sellers, but
their authors have since gone different
ways, Lane, who shuttered his lw prac-

nd steuggted for years to get his

ipt published inthe United

(it was first published in Britain),

has stumped the country in support of
District Attorney Jim Garrison's theory
that the assassinution was curried out by

Basin ers

vised by persons with c1A affiliations,
Epstein, whose book was a converted
Cornell University master’s thesis—the
subject was urged upon him by his men-
tor, Andrew Hacker—has emerged as
one of Garrison's most fervid accusers.
His vehicle is The New Yorker: in the
issue of July 13, he delivered a 25,000-

word blast at Garrison, calling the DA's.

investigation a fraud.

The New Yorker article had its genesis
over a year ago, when the author showed
up at Garrison's office in New Orleans.
According’ to Chief Investigator Louis
Ivon, Epstein spent about 48 hours in
town, some three hours at the office, and
hasn't been seen since, Much of what he
writes about has occurred since this
touch-and-go visit and is obviously hear-
say on his part, yet he writes with the
authoritative tone of a participant. Un-
doubtedly this technique is convincing
to his audience, which assumedly is un-
familiar with the intricacies of Garrison's
investigation. But to those familiar with
the facts, the article is badly slanted.

For example, Philosophy Professor
Richard. Popkin of the University. of.
California at San Diego, author of the
book The Second Oswald (propounding
the theory of an Oswald double) and
“Garrison's Case" in The New York
Review of Books (September 14, 1967),
recently commented on the article:

“I found it a queer mix of facts, half-
facts, rumors and very dubious informa-
tion from people hostile to Garrison.
Epstein has compressed all this to make
it loak like everything's on the same
level. 1 think it would take an awful lot
of work to disentangle what he’s saying
‘on almost any page as to how much of
it has a factual base, how much of it is
rumor that he has heard from people,
how much of it are charges that have
been made by people like [William] Gur-
vich [who volunteered to work on the
investigation without pay, passed him-
self off as. the Chief Investigator, then

«turned on Garrison] against. Garrison,

which haven't been substantiated any-
where except by Gurvich's statement of.
them. And also that he tends to take
facts and information and rumors and so.
‘on, that occurred over a year and a half’s
period, and compress them all into
simultaneous events, so that a statement
made ‘by Garrison at one’ time is
pounced upon on the bisis of informa-
tion or statements he made « year and a
half later in a totally different context,

_ever,”. writes: Epstein,

tion, which has some factual base, but
which also has a lot of very dubious
elements in it.”

One of the dubious elements is Ep-
stein’s version, of the testimony of Dean
Andrews Jr., a colorful attorney who
numbers among his former clients Os-
wald (who wanted his undesirable dis-
charge from the Marine Corps rectified)
and the late David William Ferrie, a
central figure in the Garrison investiga-
tion. The day after the assassination,
Andrews told the Commission he _re-
ceived a phone call from a man he knew .
as Clay Bertrénd, whom he described as
a “lawyer without a briefcase” for local
homosexuals.: Bertrand asked him to go
to Dallas and defend: Oswald. Garrison’
contends Bertrand is Clay Shaw, whom
he has charged with conspiracy.

According .to Epstein, Andrews ini-
tially gave'the Fi “several different de-
scriptions” of Bertrand, and finally ad-
mitted that .Bertrand “was merely a
figment of his imagination.” Later, be-
fore the ‘Commission, Andrews stated
that he had recently seen Bertrand in a
bar and, Epstein says, described him as
“a boy” who was “five feet eight inches”
and had “sandy hair.” “No other-clues
to Bertrand’s identity turned up, how-
“and Wesley J.
Liebeler, a Commission lawyer who con-
ducted the investigation in this arca, said
he was convinced that no such person
existed.”

An objective reading” of “Andrews” ~~
testimony, however, reveals that he
told the FBr that Bertrand was“approxi-
mately six feet one inch to six feet two
inches in height, brown hair, and well
dressed"—a description that closely .
matches thg tall, aristocratic Shaw. As
for Bertrand being a figment of his
imagination, Andrews declared, “That's
what the Feebees [Ft] put on,” He re-
counted that G-men had pestered him
to the point where he told them, “Write
what you want, that I am nuts. I-don’t
care.” As for his later remark: to the
Commission's Mr. Liebeler that Ber-
trand was only five feet, eight. inches,
Andrews explained that “this time I was
Jooking for the fellow, he was sitting
down.” Nowhere does he refer to Ber=
trand as a “boy.” Epstein was perhaps
confused by his exclamation: “I don’t
play Boy Scout and measure them.”

In his superficial examination of Gur-

in Mexico City in 1963, and had been
instructed by his spy superiors to deter-

attempt had any foundation. Nagell says
he learned that the first attempt against
Kennedy was scheduled for September
26 in Washington, D.C., and that Oswald
(who crossed the border into Mexico the
“rday’* before). was to. be* set tpas' the
“patsy” and shot in front of the Cuban

Embassy in Mexico City. When the anti-
Castro paramilitary team could not
penetrate the Presidential security in
Washington, Oswald got a reprieve. But
Nagell, who says he was sure the attempt
would come off but failed to get the Fat
o listen, faked a bank robbery in El
Paso on September 20 so that he would
be arrested and in federal custody when
the assassination:occurred.

Epstein dismisses.-Nagell as being
mentally unbalanced, noting that “court
records indicated that Nagell had suf-
fered brain damage in an airplane crash
in 1957” and that, following the bank
episode, he was.‘‘an inmate of a federal
institution for the criminally insane in
Springfield, Missouri.” As he does so
frequently throughout the article, Ep-
stein delivers. a version which if devel-
oped fully would throw a different light

“on the’ matter.’ Nagel was in a ‘plane

crash, but he-was given: Intelligence

that he had-no permanent brain injury.

The pul ion of the Fipstein article
came at an opportune lime for Clay
Shaw. Obtaining advance copies, his at-
torneys entered it as evidence before a
three-judge federal pancl which was hear-
ing arguments that the DA was “con-
ducting avrein of terror™ und “perse-
cuting” the defendant. Apparently the
panel was unimpressed, for it unani-
mously rejected the defense’s argument
and ordered the case to trial.

‘SUBJECT:

This past’ weekend, I visited a friend who had gust returned from New
. York City, bringing back a copy of a New York underground newspaper,
J the East Village Other, dated August 20, 1969.

Out of curiosity, I paged through the paper and, on page.17, found a E
“s: SQ~c¢alled classified section, consisting generally of ads for male and © <
... female artists models and offerings of books alleged to Getta one."
posdn the art of synthesizing hallucinogenics.

In the personal. colums of this section, the pernree was noted, a
y verbatim transcript of which is set forth:

"Caught In The Act, Notice to the CIA and all SY ie
eShitheads who participated in Project Purple Shaft: :
After that fiasco in the GIR you worms did your best a
to screw, blue and tattoo me. You even tried to have
my ass dusted in. Berlin . . o you furkups. Now its
my turn to do a little shafting.

BACKGROUND USEONLY °‘ CONFIDENTIAL

LIMIT DISTRIBUTION

Background

My initial contact with Mr. Nagell was when he was expelled
from the DDR by the East German officials who forcibiy
-propelled him toward us over «he borderline into West Berlin,
As we initially escorted Mr, Nagell back to US Army Lospital
Berlin in the US Mission vehicle, he seemed unsure of where

he was, and who we were, as well as being angry and belligerent
about his treatment by the East Germans. In the course of

the two hour interview which was then conducted ‘at the
hospital, Mr. Nagell gradually regained his composure and

gave a more cooperative and coherent history. At his
insistance, the interview took place in the presence of the
attorney Mr._Ricey S. New, Jrs, who acted in an unofficial
capacity as a legally oriented "friend."

The salient aspects of Mr, Nagell's history are as follows.

He says he was on active military duty (Army) from 1948 until
1959, For the first. three of. these years. he: was.an enlisted
man, and*for-the: last six he was an officer, working in
military intelligence, In 1954'he was the sole survivor in

a plane crash which resulted in a brain concussion, numerous
‘physical injuries, and prolonged military hospitalization.

Hr. Nagell now claims that he believes it was this head
injury which resulted in his “unstable personality and
immature or impulsive behaviour." lie attributes to this
instability his marital difficulties and his decision to
resign his commission in 1959, something which he now cco
unwise, At the time of his leaving the service he was not
awarded a disability pension, but he says that he was later
able to successfully petition the VA for a "b4% disaLility."
He claims that he had never seen a psychiatrist during
military ‘career, ES ieeceereceeree

From 1959 to 1962 he says that he worked for the State
California as.an investigator for various bureaus, iti
marital difficulties had increaseu and his wife ir
separation, keeping with her their two childre
says that one night in 1962 he became intoxicated,
to break down the door to her apartment. On this basis he

In September 1963 he was accused of committing an act which

he now says was bred out of his feeling of hopelessness

and desperation, Ne claims that in a confused way he
attempted while armed to rob a bank and was easily appre-
hended. For the next 4 1/2 years followed a complicated
series of trials, appeals and retrials, In addition to
spending these years in prison, he also-had at least three
prison hospitalizations for psychiatric observation. His
appeals apparently hinged on his contention that he was
"temporarily insane" at the time of the crime. lie was not

». considered insane. at any time during his imprisonment, and

his claim to temporary insanity found support in the expert

‘testimony of a noted American neurologist, Dr. Edwi

Weinstein. Dr. Weinstein apparently interpreted Nagell's

EEGts (electro-encephalograns) as being abnormal and argued

} ‘that Nagell had developed a "paranoid personality, and
instability" on the basis of his brain injury. This sy ot

~ tion was apparently disputed by other expert witnesses, but
» in, any case--Nagell..was officially: acquitted om April 29° of

this year,

Nagell says. he then went to the New York area, where his
sister (his closest relative) resides, but he claims an
additional complication in his life had risen in that he
had once been an "acquaintance" of Lee Harvey Oswald, and
had been implicated ina possible plot to assassinate
. President Kennedy in an article in RAMPARTS magazine which
“appeared in January ahi Hee Masel firmly denies that he

in fact imprisoned at the time noe the assassination, on
he basis of thi a i i i.

Mr. Garrison, the attorney general from New Orleans who is
arguing that a conspiracy existed in the assassination,. .-~-~
came up to New York to interview him. Nagell says that he

je hat_he had any information of use to Mr. Garrison,

but that the interview left him with two fears, One fear
was that might subpoena him to testify in

Orleans proceedings, and the other fear was that the cL A
might t a im, a suspicion which he says
was planted in his mind by Mr. Garrison, He says that soon
afterwards while walking down a street at night in New York

City he was almost run over by a car without lights. tle
interpreted this as being an attempt at murder by the CIA

and in some haste left the country for a tour of Europe,

ties In June,, shortly théreafter, he discussed with an American

i consular official in Zurich his recurrent fear that the

i CIA was going to "hit" him. His next travel point was to

! West Berlin, and on June 11, 1968, while his train was

\ traversing the. DDR, he says that he was taken off the
train and illegally detained. He is not certain why he
was taken off the, train but admits to having talked freely
on the train to other passengers about his life history,
and he was also carrying with him a -héavy portfolio of all
of his Army and government records involved with his service
career, disability, and imprisonment, For several mcnths
Nagell claims that he was interrogated by the Last Germans
and repeatedly asked to confess his role as a spy or govern-
ment agent. Eventually, Nagell says that he concluded the
only way to be released would be to feign mental illness,
which he says he proceeded to do, This was several weeks
ago and he says he was soon examined by an East German
psychiatrist and events were set in motion which culminated
in. his: release -today,. four and: one-half. months»after his:
detention began,

Mr, Nagell's: plans for the future center around returning,

to the United States and beginning an appeal to the govern-

ment to grant him a psychiatric disability pension, as well
i as for his physical disability, on the basis of his head
: injury. He no longer believes that it is realistic to think
that the CIA was trying to kill him,

Mental Status Exam

Mr. Nagell is a tall, 38 year old male who shows the evidence
of a prior head injury in the form of extensive scars on

} : the left side of his face, facial asymmetry cue to.seventh taoccn in
nerve injury, reconstructive surgery on his left ear, ete

In addition he shows some healed incisions on his left wrist
which he claims were superficial lacerations self-inflictea
at the time of his first. imprisonment in 1963, and again a
few weeks ago in the DDR. He denies that in either instance
he seriously intended to kill himself. He is of superior

a4 intelligence and shows- a remarkable memory for dates and

i : names. Initially hé was belligerent, angry,.and suspicious
Ie : of every effort made to help him. Over the span’of two
hours, he gradually became more cooperative and rational.

Ne is in his own terms a "chronically: paranoid person" by
‘which he means that he is always highly suspicious and tends
to impute intentions where none maycexist. Despite his

overall suspiciousness, and his fears about the CIA, there
i Swas no overt evidence of psychosis. His nutritional state
7 and general well-being both appeared to be good,

Summary ‘ i

i In summary then we seem to be dealing with a person who has
} had a personality disorder for a number of years, manifested
by emotional instability, impulsive behaviour, a tencency
to be litigious, and a general suspicious or paranoi¢
orientation, It is difficult to know how much of whet he
is saying is factual, but it may be that in June of this
a year he was becoming "borderline" or even delusional in his
cat thinking about possible attempts on his life, and this
probably explains his flight to Europe. Currently, ke is
not psychotic and seems competent in a legal and psychiatric
sense to negotiate his own affairs and’ be a free citizen
again, :

His own. closing words: provide:.a lighter note to what other-

. wise has been a complicated and serious mishap. "Well, I'll
tell you one thing, that's the last time I ever take a train
through East. Germany!"

#34490

GIST: SLOSS; a staff employee since 1948, has recently been
repolygrephed with inconclusive results, having reacted to questions
regarding disclosure of classified information, association with 4 com-
munist sympathizer, and homosexustty, He hae also been involved
with cooperation in an extramarital affeir which {chiminated in a black-
mail attempt on one of the parties. His name is perhaps identical with
& name among six names of Agency employees found on a mentally dis-
turbed and disaffected former CIC intelligence officerwho alleges contact
with Russisn and Cuban Intelligence gents. Detalles of these questionable
areas in regard te 61.056 are set forth below.. Recommend intenslve and
thorough investigation of SLOSS including surveillance of activities.

DETAILS: 1. Mr. John Richard SLOSS, born 24 September 1919
at Cleveland, Ohi Ghio, has been a staff employee of this Agency since 1948. .
Hig parents are American born... He graduated irom Yale University in

gence elements in the OCI overseas Maizen program. SLOSS was poly-
graphed in 1950 and 1953 with favorable results; in 1953 with unfavorable
resulte; and twice in 1964 with inconclusive results regarding giving CIA
eocuments or claesified information to unauthorized persons, contact
with a possible communist sympathizer, and engaging in homosexual acti-
vities since working for CIA.. He wae granted a "Q" Clearance in October

not fully contradicted by evidence. There is no'apparent explanation of .

furthers specific questioning on 22 May 1964 covering the various homosexual
areas however, there were no strong reactions to indicate that Subject might
be practicing deception on the specific question regarding engaging in home-
sexual activities since working for GIA,

8. In connection with the phave of questions concerning contact
with any possible communist sympathizer, the Subject reflected overall
distexbance indicating that all the questions obviously bothered him and
that deception was being practiced within that phase. The polygraph opera-
tor nected that there were outstanding reactione to the following ‘two questions:

20b "Other than your comments about FISHER, during your
undergraduate period at Yale did you have any contact
with any Communist or Communist sympathizer?

Answer: No, *

20¢ Buring your CIA employment, have you had any contact
: with any Comrounist or Gommunint aympathicer?

Anperex? No.

9 18. te particularly noteworthy that during his examination on
22 May 1964 when asked nine questions as to whether he had been agquaint-
ed with cortain individuals, ject only reacted whan he answered "ao"
te heving been sequainted with Jerry SEVERN and Lya WOOLSTON. These
names had béen submitted to Subject based upan pure conjecture that there
poseibly might have bean some connection with these individuals at Camp
Ritehie Military Intelligence Tratuing Genter. Since the fact that both
Jerry SEVERN and ya WOLSTON have cooperated with Soviet Intelligence _
should have been unknown te SLOSS and he declared he is act acquainted
‘with them,. there should have been no reason for him to.react to these names.
The polygraph operator states that SLOSS was not pressed further regarding
FISHER (whom he had characterized es “left of center") or hia own possible
knowledge of SEVERN or WOLSTAN since it was-obvious that SLOSS was. ~~
beginning to feel harassed on thie matter and stated that he did not enjoy:
being asked these questions.

10, During SLOSS! interview on 4 April 1964, SLOSS reflected
consistent reactinas on the questions:

"Since working for CIA,have you given CIA documents or
clasalfied information to unauthorized persons?"

-3-

00000-EL


13-00000

“Have you ever deliberately given classified information on
documents to any unauthorised person?"

In explanation, Subject aaid he wae bothered by this idea, but
that he had no:knowledge of any particular sttaation wherein he had di~
vulged information to anyone who wae unauthorized to receive it ex who
would have uged it against the Agency's interest, On the test administered
on 22 May 196¢ to resolve any possible compromise to communist or foreign
intelligence organipations, it was determined that there were no significant
reactions to relevant questions in thie area.

.. It should be especially noted that the polygraph operator.during
the 4 April 1964 interview, detected an odd amell on Subject's breath and
noted his flushed face, frequent silly grins and lethargic movements, sug-
gesting that the Subject may bave been slightly intuxtested.. The eperator
‘did not ask during this interview whether the Subject had taken any drag
oF alcohol priory to the interview but recalled an incident wherein the Sub-
ject when arrested for drunken driving in 1963 bad produced evidence that
he was a diabetic and bad taken medication prior to the incident. Gonee+
quently, dufing the second interview on 22 May 1964, Subject was questioned
regarding his physical health. He replied that he had blopped taking medi-
cation for diabetes in November 1963.. He explatiad that he took three or
four diuretic pille. He specifically denied that he had taken any other drug,
narcotic or alcohol. When this question was asked during interrogation,
he refiected reaction indicative of deception and then admitted that for
breakfaat he had taken one glass of vodke with seme orange Juice. He
stated that he drank vodka for breakfast sometimes whenever he was tense
or nervous over anything.

12.. The polygraph operator in his report concluded that the
“validity of fina] test charts ie held in question and there is no
strong evidence that the specific areas of concern have been
eonclusively resolved at this time. It is recommended that a
further study be conducted on this cave and that information
resulting from such o study be sent to IRD for possible reinter«
view of the Subject and polygraph resolution". :

33. SLOSS has indicated reactions indicative of deception during
the polygraph examinations. In one specific questian where these re-

actions were present, he admitted to lying.. This was in the question as
to whether or not he had taken any alcohol prior to the examination.:

GONGLUSION: ie

1, SLOSS has lied in hie most recent polygraph examination and
has evidenced indications of deception in areas concerning divulging
¢lassified information to unauthorised individuals, association with a

. Strmmuniat sympathizer and homosexual inclinations. SLOSS’ reaction
to the names of Jetry SEVERN and lya WOLSTON has not been fully ex~
plored. The phlygraph operator has recommended further investigation
and a Fepolygraph because the recent teste are inconclusive.

2. SLOSS hae been involved in an immoral and Wlegai extra-
marital activity between a Staff employee and a former Staff employee
where one of the parties wae subjected to a blackmail attenspt.

3. The name z. SLOSS (possibly identical to Subject) appeared
on a Hist of CIA employees found on the person of a sel{-designated "dis-
affected American" arrested by the FBI for bank robbery in September
1963, ‘This individual (mentally disturbed) with previous intelligence ex-
perience has declared that he was approached by Soviet Intelligence while
and/or after he was in Mexico City in September 1962..

4. It is suggested that the extent Of the adverse security implica-
tiene concerning SLOSS ie such, that if SLOSS is ever found to be a security
risk, the dallure at this time to purée an aggressive investigation of all
his contacts and activities te resolve all.areas of doubt could possibly lead
to & conclusion that we have been semias in our duties. The undersigned
recommends the following action:

February 28, ape y Special Agents Thomas J. Dowling
and Benjamin P. Grogan, who identified themselves to ;

She was told.that the Special Agents wished to talk to her
about her brother, Richard Case Nagell; that she would not
have to. speak with the interviewing agents; that ing
she might. say could be used in court; and that she
a right to counsel before making any statement, Nrs.
Gambert advised that she had no objeotion to. being interviewed
and that she would cooperate in any way possible,

she advised that her brother, Richard Case
Nagell, last resided with her in her home for a5 or 6 x
week period which ended just prior to Christmas, 1962.
While in New York, he was for the most partuomployed and
seeking a position. She noted that he.did obtain a
position as a store. detective but that this lasted
for only several days when he decided that. this was not
the type of investigative work he wanted to do.

When questioned as to whether or not she knew
of. activity on the part. of her brother which could
have of a subversive nature, she stated that she -
knew of no such activity; that. she did not believe her :
brother. capable of taking part in such activity; and
that if she ever became aware that he was engaging at
any time-in such activity she would have nothing to. do
with him.. At this point she noted that approximately.

brother. She stated that she expected to hear from her
brother immediately after he received her letter and the
fact that she has not heard has made her uneasy. She
noted that she offered, if permitted, to visit him, and
that she hoped to ascertain as a result of this visit,
the reason he attempted to rob a bank in El Paso, Texas,
on September 20, 1963. She advised that she has had no
reason to believe that her brother is not responsible for
his actions, .ané she noted that in one letter he wrote

to her that the bank robbery attempt was a pre-meditated
action on his part. She advised that her brother has
been in a depressed state of mind ever since he had been
accused of taking a bribe and fired from his position
with the California State Liquor Authority. She noted
that she believed, as her brother claims, that this
purported bribe was set up to remove her brother: from his
position with the. California State Liquor Authority
because of his honesty and failure to handle investigations

as insturcted by superiors.

When questioned as to whether or not her brother,
Richard Case Nagell,; maintains any type of property at her
residence, she advised that he does maintain a military
type. metal. foot locker, and that he has maintained it at
_ her residence.:since his discharge from the United
‘States Army. She noted that as this foo locker is
her brother's property, she is not‘aware of its contents,
although she believes it contains mementoes of his
military service, including his’ medals and a complete
uniform. She advised that she does ‘not even know whether or
not the foot locker is open or locked.

rt: is noted that during the course of the inter-
view of Eleanore Gambert, her husband, Lou,
was present.’

She repeatedly asked NAGELL to introduce her to his mother,. °.
but he always refused to do so, He

Mrs. NAGELL stated NAGELL never exhibited any
political interest, never mentioned communism or the "Fair
Play for Cuba Committee," or.Cuba. Once in the summer of
1963 NAGELL was mad about something unrecalled and jokingly
said he was thinking of going to Riissia, but Mrs. NAGELL is
certain this was said in jest.

Mrs, NAGELL is of the opinion there is something
mentally: wrong with NAGELL, He would fly into violent rages
without apparent reason, She pointed out that her television
set has a split plastic case and stated NAGELL hit the set -
with his fist once while angry and this resulted in this

damage.

Although NAGELL did not like his children, during
the marriage, he has frequently complained about not being
with them since the divorce, He sends them cards from various
places in the United States, but has never since the divorce
furnished support for the children or Mrs, NAGELL, As a con-_

that since the separation in April of 1962, NAGELL has sent
her a total of about $180.00.

On March.5, 1964, Mrs, FRANCES NAGEL furnished 7
the following information to SAs JAMES H, HOOSE, JR., and
PHILIP J, REILLY at her residence at 856 South Catalina
Avenue, Apartment 104, Los Angeles:

Mrs, NAGELL stated that for many years and-for
various reasons, none of which relate to this case, there
has been dissension in the family, However, until the time
that RICHARD NAGELL was in the airplane crash, they had gotten
< @long well together.. Since the crash ‘there has been a marked: |
_ change in RICHARD NAGELL, and Mrs, NAGELL is certain her son has -
some form of mental trouble,

She: saw RICHARD in Chicago, Illinois, in 1954, and
She moved to Los Angeles in May of 1955. It was then seven
years before she heard directly from him or saw him. She ran
into RICHARD by chance on the street in Los Angeles, saw that
he needed help, and thereafter tried to give him both moral and
financial assistance.

Mrs. NAGELL gave her son $1,000.00 on one occasion
and much smaller amounts on other occasions, He never expressed
appreciation for this help, RICHARD never seemed to have e! ough
money, She does not know if he had a bank account or’not. seatatenait

: Mrs, NAGELL was trying to locate RICHARD after he .
| . had disappeared for several days. She knew he could often

». be found ‘at The Happy Rabbit, a beer:joint at 2709 West Sixth
Street, Los Angeles. She went there and found RICHARD, and
he flew into an uncontrollable rage because she had gone inside
this bar, claiming it was no place for a decent woman.
Mes. NAGELL stated it was really not that bad a place. She
became. definitely convinced after this incident that there
was something seriously wrong with her son, But even prior
. to this time she observed RICHARD became extremely angry over
nothing, and he would cry without explaining what was troubling
hin,

LA 65-7445

After above mentioned incident, RICHARD again
would have nothing. to do-with her. She kept track of him
through her.other son, LOUIS, who is a year anda half older
than RICHARD, Mrs. NAGELL was in a way. happy to have the
boys get together after years of estrangement. She
described LOUIS as being an almost hopeless alcoholic,

She thought since both sons had serious problems, they might
be able to help each other, LOUIS has told her, however,
that he was never able to straighten out RICHARD.

She stated that RICHARD never ‘discussed communism,

‘never mentioned Cuba or the "Fair Play for Cuba Committee"

or gave any indleation he was in any manner involved in
espionage,

On March 9, 1964, Mrs, NAGELL informed SA HOOSE
that she. wanted to point out that RICHARD had never physically
abused her, that the abuse was always vocal. She also mentioned
that she herself has been under psychiatric care for ‘several
years, and she does not think her problem has yet been
eliminated,

following information to SAs JAMES H, HOOSE, JR., and PHILIP.
J. REILLY at his residence at 10130 Samoa Avenue, Tujunga,
California, telephone 353-1224:.

LOUIS stated he got in trouble at age 16 and since
that time has used his mother's maiden name as his last name.
He considers himself to be the "black sheep" of the family and
has had little contact; with other family members until the last
year or two. - At one time in Korea he discovered he was in the
same army outfit.as his brother, RICHARD, and looked him up.
RICHARD was an officer in intelligence while LOUIS was an
enlisted man, and RICHARD did not want to have much contact
with LOUIS. However, when their mother. told RICHARD that LOUIS

LA 65-7445

had cancer of the throat in 1962, RICHARD went to LOUIS and
offered to help him, LOUIS later discoveréd he did not have
cancer and also discovered that RICHARD was the one who needed
help. LOUIS frequently saw RICHARD in 1962 and until about
August of 1963 when RICHARD left the Los Angeles area.

LOUIS considers RICHARD to be mentally disturbed.
He recalled an afternoon when both were at The Happy Rabbit
and the newspapers carried an account of the burglary of the
local armory. RICHARD told LOUIS he had pulled the burglary
and had some machine guns in his car parked on the street

" near the. beer joint. LOUIS immediately said he would like

to see the machine guns and the two of them welked out to the
car... LOUIS. saw: no guns..and..upon asking, RICHARD :where: they. were.
the latter replied he did not know what LOUIS was talking about,
RICHARD said he had no recollection of telling LOUIS anything
about guns or burglarizing any armory. In addition to this
LOUIS said that RICHARD was usually in a state of deep
depression. RICHARD complained about his wife divorcing hin
and about his employment probiems. : :

RICHARD never spoke in favor of communism but he
did say that he thought the American government should do
more for him in view of his army service, He never mentioned
Russia. When RICHARD returned from Mexico City in 1962, he
told LOUIS he had gone to Cuba from Mexico, He gave no.-
reason for having made this trip, LOUIS has no information
indicating RICHARD was ever involved in espionage. He never.

LOUIS. does not know if RICHARD had a bank account;
he does know RICHARD usually was broke.

any members of NAGELL's: family nor does he know of any other
close friends of NAGELL,

he receives monthly, He also asked JOHN to mail him an almanac:
whenever it was convenient as he liked to refer to the almanac
from time to. time as a general source of information, JOHN

‘complied with both requests. Near the end of each month JOHN

has sent. the checks to NAGELL at a Post Office box in El Paso,

. Texas, He also sent him an almanac with.a yellow cover as he
vecallsa it, JOHN did not mark or alter this almanac.in any way.

‘JOHN. recently received a form letter from a hospital”

In addition, the subject had in his possession at
the. time of his arrest on September 20, 1963, a piece of

. paper containing the listing of what appeared to be United

States Army Officers. and their serial numbers. One section.
of this paper was listed under the heading “Third Operations

known the subject personally and had served in
the subject. GLENN noted that his name appeared in one of
the above mentioned photographs of papers which were found
in the possession of the subject.when arrested in El Paso *
on September 20, 1963, GLENN stated that he and the subject o
had been attached to an Intelligence Branch of the United

States Army in the Far East during the period of their acquaintance.

GLENN explained that the names in parentheses in
one of the above mentioned photographs were "code names" used

5.

EP 65-951

by members of Army Intelligence Units in Korea in order to
protect their-real identities from informants.

GLENN also advised that the subject was not
stable mentally and that this instability was probably due
to damage to brain tissues suffered in an airplane crash
during the Korean War in which the subject was the only -
survivor. GLENN stated that the subject, in fact, did have

-a brilliant war record, which was the reason for his

assignment to Army Intelligence in spite of what should
have been an obvious, psychological defect.

GLENN pointed out as an example of the subject's
instability that the subject had turned in allegations
againgt an Intelligence Officer in Korea, which became the
subject of extensive investigation. GLENN added that te
subject was subsequently transferred to another Army unit
and upon reporting to that unit, was greeted in a friendly
way by his new Commanding Officer, who told him he hoped
the subject would enjoy his new assignment and that he,

*the Commander, would do ail he could to make it a worthwhile

tour of duty for the subject.

To this, NAGELL allegedly ‘replied that the Commander’

had certainly better sce that this was the case as, NAGELL
told him, he made a practice of keeping a record of every.
move ‘made by his Conmanding Officer and if he stepped out
of line ‘onei whit at any time, it would be made the subject
of an immediate report to higher headquarters.

: GLENN made available. a letter from the Assistant
Chief of Staff, G-2/G-3, United States Army, Japan, which
was in answer to a request for information regarding the:
subject and which contained the following infomation:

SUBJECT, after graduation from the Army Intelligence
School, Fort Holabird, Maryland, in August 1955, served as an
advisor to the First Republic of Korea Army and subsequently
in Sendai, and Tokyo, Japan, terminating in about 1958.
These assignments were concerned with intelligence activities,



13-00000

EP 65-951

as an advisor to the ROK Army ia Korea, and as a member of the

‘ US Army Counterintelligence Corps in Japan. During the

latter tour of duty, the countexrintelligence unit was designated
the 3rd Operations Group, with Headquarters in Tokyo and
Detachment B in Sendai, as referred to in photographic inclosures
to your letter.

In assignments of this nature it is common practice
for members to become acquainted with personnel of various
Japanese security agencies, such as are mentioned in March
5 Memorandum of the FBI, El Paso, Tezas, It is not unusual
for individuals assigned couaterintelligence duties to retain
lists of these persons for reference in the event they are
again reassigned to the area, or for dispatching cards or
thank you notes from the United States. This would appear
to be the reason for SUBJECT having kept the list of agency
personnel, although to have retaiaed the list for a number of
years after leaving the service appears unusual. The names Kaji,
Wataru and Jack Cannon were known to the public as the results
of allegations of illegal intelligence operations that were
publicized in the Japanese press,: but SUBJECT'S reason for
including those names in HIS lists cennot be assessed. Also,
no reason can be given for the two or three miscellaneous eee
names in NAGELL'S file. :

The list of Americans mentioned in one of the photographic
attachments pertains to US personnel in the intelligence field.
It appears that the subject maintained a roster of those persoas
with whom he would or had coatact, which is sot unusual.
Information contained on those rosters, particularly that
portion indicating code names, was and is regardéd as classified
information by this office. err

Files, of the Counterintelligence Repository, USARJ,
disclosed no information relative to NAGELL or of his aliases.

States District Court, denied the motion for a new trial
and. sentenced the subject to serve ten years under the
provisions of Section 4208 (a) (II), Title 18, United States
Code, which provides that the subject can be released under
parole at any time it is deemed advisable. This sentence
was for violation of Section 2113, Title 18, United States
Code.

The June 17, 1964 issue of "The El Pdso Herald

Suicide Try", According te the article, the subject swallowed
several sleeping pills while lodged at the El. Paso County Jail

be kept under observation all night and was to be transferred
to the William Beaumont General Hospital from the La Tuna

- Federal Correctional Institution Hospital unless his condition
improved.

The article furthe stated that Deputy U.S. Marshal

"Ms, B. Parker" may be identical te John Floyd Parkes, cur-.
rent Agency employee, who was born 2 January 1898, Louisville,
Kentucky.

“Migs Guthries" may be identical to Francee: Agnes Guthrie,
born 29 February 1908, Charleston, West Virginia, who is ‘ateo cu cure.
xently employed by this Agency,

"Mr, G. Churchill" may be identical to Creighton Churchill
who was bors 1 October 1912, Coynish, New Hampshire, whose pres--
ent sddreas is not known and whose address in 1952 was 27 West 44th
Street, New York City.

Jobn Floyd Parker ang Frances Guthrie have been interviewed
in regard to any knowledge of Nagel? but neither individual has any
recollection of having ever met Rithard Gare Nagel. Guthrie was em-
ployed by this Agency in Japan in the 1950's. Creighton Churchill aod
Sohn Floyd Parker were in Japan in 1952 to interview and debrief
Snited States servicemen who had been held prisoners of war by the
Sommanists, . a

In view of the background of Nagel! in the Sar Eset; the possi

Bility exists that Nagell could have obtained the names of Parker,
Guthrie and Churchill in the spproximate 1982 period, although « apéci~
fic statement concerning thie caniot be made in view of the limited in-
formation concernin, ; Nagel...

"Mr. E. Leibacher' and'Mx,. Da Vanon" are believed to refer to
Ernst Leibacker and Joseph Frances Davanon of the Log Angeles Field
Office of this Agency... Your Loe Angeles Field Office haa been previ-
ously aware that Lefbacker.and Davanon have no personal knowledge of
Nagell.. ‘There is no record of any past interest in Nagel py thie

tegard te any y knowledge of Nagell and hea advised that he has no
recollection of having met any individual by that name. If John
Richard Sloss ia identical to “J. Sloss,” it is not possible from
available information to even speculate as to how the name came
inte the possession of Nagel.

In view of the fact that Richard George Fecteau ia curtently
in prison in China and the indication that the other six names: listed

does ndt appear that the above information could affect either the

propecution of or the defense of Nagell on the charge of bank reb-

It was good to hear from you, to learn
you are still at the old shop; etc.

Dear Floy:

I got your letter yesterday-in New York,
and while driving the 300-odd miles hoped that my
subconscious. would perhaps come out with a peal of
a bell regarding an individual named Ed Nagell. But
no bellsrang.

I have only a.small-hunch --'a piccolo-toot
in my memory. Whe. I worked for the shop I once went
to see Mr. James Bennett, Director of Federal Prisons,
( with whom I had once shared a table on an ocean
liner, years before). You can guess why I wanted to
sec Bennett: I was seeking ways for birds to fly out
of cages. Bennett mentioned a guy ( with a questionable
record, as far as he was concerned) who claimed to
know us, you and me, what we were doing., etc. etc.

He had aproached Bennett " as from us". Ed Nagell

-- the name -- rings a piccolo-toot on this, but~only
that. Incidentally, I filed a report on the incident
when I got back to the shop.

I am often in New York -- at the Harvard
Club -- and should you ever be in town, give me a ring.
It would. be fun to see you. I met Harry Csterweis in
a restaurant the other day -- fater some many, many
years. You.may remember him.

I have recently become an author an Wines.
After a year in France in 1959, I wrote a book on French
wines which was. published by Knopf, and am about to bring
out one on wines of the world with MacMillan in September.
That is about the extent of ‘my news.

ail

My best to you.

El Paso Herald-Post article states that NAGELL told
U.S. District Court that he did not attempt to hold up
the bank. "I had a motive for doing what I did" NAGELL
told Judge, "but my motive was not to hold up the bank,
I do not intend to disclose my motive at this time."

Subsequent to President's assassination, Subject claimed
acquaintance with OSWALD and wife. Marina OSWALD

NAGELL furnished a signed statement: :

",,. In September 1962,-while I was in Mexico City,a
representative of a foreign government preposed to me
that I participate in an act; such act being a criminal
offense and inimical to the best interest of the United
States. At that time, I refused such proposal. In May
1963, another representative of the same foreign govern-
ment made the same proposaltome. At that time, I
agreed to such a proposal."

"In September 1963, I was informed by an American,
known to me as an Agent of the same foreign government,
that arrangements for my participation in the aforementioned
act were completed. At that time, I refused the aforesaid
proposal,

Approximately one week later,.I was instructed by this
same person to either participate as previously agreed

or derrogatory information pertaining to me would be
disclosed to thé Federal Bureau of Investigation. There-
upon, I agreed to follow the instructions of this person,
although I did not intend todo so, This existing situation
actuated my conduct of September'20, 1963, for which I
was arrested and am presently charged.

I did not actually attempt to rob any bank. I thought that
my arrest.would provide an immediate, though temporary,
solution.to the problem with which I was confronted.

Iam not guilty as charged."

NAGELL arraigned in connection with indictment for
bank robbery and was committed for 30 days for the

purpose of psychiatric examination,

Sentenced in U.S, District Court, El Paso, Texas to
serve 10 years,

NAGELL swallowed several sleeping pills while lodged

at the El Paso ‘EERE Jail.

His name is perhaps identical with

3. The name of John SLOSS may be identical with the name J.
SLOSS found on the person of Richard Gaz NAGELL when arrested in con-
nection with a bank robbery in El Paso, Texas, on 20 September 1963. A
notebook found on NAGELL made reference to Fair Play for Cuba Commit-
"tee, the addresses of Foreign, Embassies, the names of purported CIA
agents and other information. Although NAGELL is unquestionably ment-
ally unbalanced, he tells a story of being involved in eapionage which is
not fully contradicted by evidence. There is no apparent explanation of
why the name J. SLOSS as well as five other names of CIA personnel
should have been in the possession of Richard Case NAGELL. .. The weird
story of NAGELL is contained in a chronological listing of hia activities
