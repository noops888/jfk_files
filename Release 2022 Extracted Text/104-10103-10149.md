MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT : Comments on George de Mohrenschildt
"Reputed Former CIA Agent"

REFERENCE: Memo for the Record, dated 4 April 1977.

1. In a UPI article (see Tab A) published in the
Washington Star of 4 April 1977, George de Mohrenschiidt
is referred to as a “reputed former CIA agent." This...
remark is a misinterpretation of the facts by the writer
of the article. A review of the de Mohrenschildt file.’:
reveals that.de Mohrenschildt had provided information,..in
December 1957, to a CIA representative in Dallas, Texas, in
response to the latter's request, on his trip to Yugoslavia
in 1957. on behalf of the International Cooperation Agency
(ICA). This action does not make de Mohrenschildt a "CIA
agent," rather, it makes him an unpaid informant.

: The circumstances pertaining to CIA's interest in |
a de Mohrenschildt's knowledge of conditions in Yugoslavia
cara are set forth in the following paragraphs.

2. On 3 June 1964, the Agency forwarded to J. Lee
Rankin, General Counsel, President's Commission on the
Assassination of President Kennedy; the following informa-
tion on George de Mohrenschildt.

"1, Reference is made to your memorandum of

31 March 1964 requesting any information on George
and Jeanne de Mohrenschildt that is available to

CIA files. Our review shows. that the files contain
reports received from other U.S. Government agencies,
primarily the FBI, as well as some information de-
_veloped by this Agency in 1957 and 1958. The review
also produced references to information and the Office
of Strategic Services. According to the records of
those agencies, George de Mohrenschildt had been con-
sidered for employment in 1942, but was not hired
because he was alleged to be a Nazi espionage agent.
No information developed by CIA or its predecessors

before the assassination of President Kennedy had
established any link between de Mohrenschildt and a
Lee Harvey Oswald and his family.

"2, CIA's initial interest in George de
Mohrenschildt developed as a result of his sojourn
in Yugoslavia in 1957 on behalf of the International
‘Cooperation Agency (ICA). In that connection CIA
headquarters sent a routine advisory to its Dallas
representative who called on the de Mohrenschildt's
in the early part of December 1957. In the course
of. several meetings the CIA representative obtained
foreign intelligence which was promptly disseminated
to other federal agencies in ten separate reports.
The Dallas representative continued informal, occasional
contact with the. de Mohrenschildt's until the autumn-
of 1961. He has not:seen them since that time, although

_ he received a Christmas: card from them during the holiday
period following the assassination. :

"3, On the 23rd or 24th of November 1963, after
the assassination, our representative in Dallas re-
ceived a telephone call from one of his contacts who
told him that several members of his firm had attended
a ‘social or a discussion group in January 1963 and that
Lee Harvey Oswald had also been there. Our repre-
sentative immediately arranged for the FBI to contact
the executive. It was later ascertained from the FBI,
and from one of our sources, that George de Mohrenschildt
was present at the meeting and had introduced Oswald to
the group. :

"4, At CIA headquarters the association between the
de Mohrenschildt's and the Oswald's was noted for the
first time in December 1963 when it was reported from
Haiti that the de Mohrenschildt's had appeared at the
Embassy and volunteered information about their rela-
tionship with the Oswald's. At about the same time the
details of their association began to appear in reports
made by other U.S. Government agencies engaged in in-
vestigating the assassination.

"5, During the contact with George de Mohrenschildt
latein 1957 and 1958, his background was investigated.
Inquiries produced a considerable amount of information
about him and his activities, including allegations
that during World War II he had engaged in espionage
activities on behalf of the Nazis; that he was a member


5)

of the Communist Party; and that after the war he

was sympathetic toward Communism and the U.S.S.R..

The investigation was extended to Belgium where .
George de Mohrenschildt claimed to have lived from
1930 until 1938. His educational background and his
work as a journalist were confirmed there. One record
of arrest came to light: on 4 November 1931 he was
sentenced by the Tribunal Correctionnel at Antwerp to
eight days in prison on charges of resisting a police
officer. and to eight days imprisonment or a fine of
132 francs on charges of drunkenness and use of a false
name. ‘Sentence was suspended pening completion of a
three-year probationary period.

"6. Throughout his adult life, George de
Mohrenschildt has used variations of his basic name,
including such variants as Jerry de Mohrenschildt;
Jerzey von Mohrenschildt; George von Mohrenschild;
and George Sergius de Mohrenschild. In like manner he
also seems to have varied his former ethnic origin from
Russian, to Polish, Swedish, Danish, and German. There
appear to be. two versions of his mother's maiden name:
Alexandra Latoskey and Alexandra Zapolski.

"7, FBI Special Agent James F. Morrissey came to
CIA on 19 March 1964 and reviewed this Agency's files
on the de Mohrenschildt's.

"8, On 17 March 1964 the FBI furnished to this
Agency a report dated 28 February 1964. The report..pro-
vides details about one Yuri (George) de Mohrenschild's
contact with Fedor Alekseevich Garanin, who was a Soviet
diplomat in Washington, D.C., in 1946. In that report
Yuri (George) de Mohrenschild was described as a petro-
leum engineer who had worked in. the Texas oil fields
and in Venezuela. Concerning Garanin, our records show
that he has been a member of the Soviet State Security
Service probably since the mid-1940's. He served in
Cuba in 1943; after World War II he also served in the
U.S., Hungary, and Finland. According to our records,
the information about Garanin and his association with
the Soviet State Security Service has also been known
to the FBI. : :

"9, You may also wish to make inquiries at the
Office of Naval Intelligence; the Assistant Chief of
Staff, Intelligence, Department of the Army; the Depart-
ment of State;~and the Civil Service Commission because


a2)

these departments also have information about
George de Mohrenschildt."

(Comment: This document was released under. the FOI Act
with portions deleted. The deleted portions include in-
formation which was received from a foreign liaison service
as well as information which might tend to identify an
Agency source, information which originated with the FBI
which the FBI will discuss directly with the requester, in-
formation identifying an FBI special agent, information
identifying Agency components, as well as information relating
to Agency internal filing instructions. The deletioris were
made under the authority of exemptions (b) (1), (b) (2),
(b) (3), and (b) (7) (F). See copy under Tab B.)

_3. As indicated above, the Agency was interested in
obtaining reports from de Mohrenschildt in 1957 relating to
his trip to Yugoslavia on behalf of the International Coopera-
tion Agency (ICA). Contact Division (now Domestic Collection
Division - DCD) had its representative in Dallas, J. Walton
Moore, contact de Mohrenschildt. The history of Moore's
relationship with de Mohrenschildt from 1957 to 1961 is
attached under Tab .C. ‘In his testimony taken on 23 April 1964
at 200 Maryland Avenue NE, Washington, D.C.; by Mr. Albert E.
Jenner, Jr., assistant counsel of the President's Commission,
de Mohrenschildt described his contact with Walter Moore,
whom he referred to as G. Walter Moore [sic - J. Walton Moore].
De see eraeeyai peatene ns concerning ore is bi enter :
on page of Volume IX of the Hearings before the President's

F Presiden

Commission on the Assassination 0 ent Kennedy. A copy
of page is attached under Tal .

4, As a routine action, Moore requested traces on
de Mohrenschildt. The traces (see Tab E) contained sufficient
derogatory information to preclude further extensive con-
tact with the de Mohrenschildt's. A summary of information
on de Mohrenschildt from the Office of Security appears
under Tab F.

5. Conclusion: George de Mohrenschildt was never a
"recruited agent" of the Central Intelligence Agency. For
approximately four years (1957 - 1961), a representative of
the Agency had had a periodic contact with de Mohrenschildt
for the purpose of obtaining overt information which the
latter obtained during his travels abroad. These contacts

: :
were not clandestine nor did such contacts involve the ~
clandestine procurement of secret foreign intelligence. *
So far as the Agency knows, de Mohrenschildt provided in-
formation in response to Moore's request as a patriotic
gesture, without thought. of monetary gain.

~At ‘this time I saw and met Hrs. Jan de Mohrenschildt, a white Russian

emigree from Shanghai. I saw the de Nohrenschildt'a several times in 1958
and 1959. In late 1959 or early 1960, Hr. and Mrs. de Mohrenschildt went
on an 18 sonth biking trip through Mexico and Central Amerles. An account
of this tripe as taken from the 18 Oct 61 issue of the Dallas Times Hetald,
ia enclosed.

f Be pees hee eee a eee
de Hohrenschildt’s are an interesting and umisual couple. This is, I
believe, the second marriage for both of thes. ra. de Hohrenschildt,
who has been a successful drass designer, has a grown, married daughter,
who is quite a fine artist. George de Mohrenschildt has several children
by his first wife (reportedly a very wealthy wonan now living in the
Middle East). One of his children dicd of cystic fibrosis and George

him, smoked a pipe. I would.dascribe his personality as friendly and out-
going although I have heard him referred to ae conceited. He reputedly.
has an eye for the ladies and I understand his interest does not go

" unreeiprocated. He leads a scnewhat unconventional life, plays tennis”

at 5 o'clock in the morning, he Ls rether outspoken, has a keen interest

both play handball. He mentioned the last tise I saw hin that de Mobren-.

for Haiti in about February of 1963 but I am very vague on this point.

I don’t know. Who does—you see. But he is a Government man in some
capacity. He interviewed me and took my deposition on my stay in Yugoslavia,
what I thought about the political situation there. And we became quite friendly
after that. We saw each other from time to time, had lunch. There was a

peculiar Incldent occurred.
Mr. Jenne, Which book?

pposedly,
noticed small marks on the pages—“No. 1” after five pages, “
with a pencil, another five pages, No. 8, and so on and so forth.

I told my wife “Jeanne, have you fiddled around with my book?’ She said,
“Of course not.” 1 said, “That's impossible.” And I forgot it for a while.

In the evening we got back home, and we stayed in bed, and all of a sudden
the Idea came back to me that somebody must have been in my apartment and
checked my book and read through that and took photographs. And it was such
a horrible idea that Jeanne and I just could not sleep all night. And the next
morning we both of ‘us went to see Walter Moore and told him, “Now, look
what happened to us. Have you Government people”—and I think I asked him
point blank, you know—“Have you FBI people looked through my book?” He
sald, “Do you consider us such fools as to leave marks on your book if we had?
But we haven't.” I satd, “Can't you give me some protection against somebody
who has?’ He sald, “Do you have any strong enemies?” I said, “Well, I
Possibly have. Everybody has enemies.” But I never could figure out who it was.
And it is still a mystery to me.

So I am not so sure whether I asked point blank Clark or Walter Moore

about Oswald. I probably spoke to both of them about him. My recollection
4s, and also my wife's recollection 1s, that either of them anid he is # harmlen,
Tunatle. Later on Max got disgusted with him and said that he is a no-gooq
b-----d, @ traitor, and so on and so forth. But by that time we already forgs,
Oswald—got Oswald out of your lives, you see, This is one-point.

‘The second point fs as you can see the whole of the Russian colony in Dalle;
were interested in Oswald one way or the other, because they represented
somebody who had been to their old country just recently, and could Bive
them the latest information on what was going on. As I said, the old guard
were naturally against them right away.. The others were just curious. By
this particular couple, Natasha and Igor Voshinin, refused to see them. And
I insisted several times, “Why don’t you see them? You love all the Bussians,
Why don’t you meet Marina Oswald?" And she said, “We don’t want ‘to, and
we bave our reasons for not meeting them.” And it kept on in my mind, 1
did not want to raise that question. But why didn’t they want to meet them?

Mr. Jexnen. Well, tell me what is your speculation as to why they did not
‘want to meet them? Z

‘Mr. De Mouzenscutror. I do not bave the slightest idea. Maybe they knew
something about Oswald, of some connection. a

Mr. Jenne, Or maybe they were alarmed, and didn’t want to take any
chances, -*

Mr. Dz Morzensoumpr. Maybe just that.” Es 7

.Mr, Jens. But they were pretty firm in not having any traffic with them.

Mr. De Monrenscumpr. Absolutely firm. The only ones. Maybe they were
Just more recently arrived in the United States’ and they were not so ‘secure
like we were, you see. And possibly they were just alarmed of meeting some.
body who just came from Soviet Russia. -

Mr, Jenner. I think I will ask you at this point, Mr. De Mohrenschildt, you
are a man of very superior education and extremely wide experience and ac
quaintance bere and in Europe, South America, West Indies—you have lived
an extremely colorful life. You are acquainted to a greater or lesser degree
with a great variety of people. 7

‘Mr. DE MouRenscumor. Yes.

Mr. Jennen. Did there go through your mind. speculations as to whether
Oswald was an agent of anybody?

Mr. De Mounenscurpr. No.

Mr. Jexnen. Why? Before I put it. that way—when you say “No,” am J
correct in assuming that you thought about the subject and you concluded he
was not an agent of anybody? Is that what you meant?

Mr. Dg MoHReNnscuitor. I never theught even about ft. I will tell you why
I thought he never was—because he was too outspoken. He was too outspoken
in his idéas and his attitudes. If he were really—if he were an agent, I
thought he would have kept quiet. This would be my idea.

‘Mr, Jennen. You say he was outspoken. What do you base that on?

Mr, Dr Monnenscuttor. For instance, he showed me his—he discussed very
freely with me, when he showed me his little memoirs.

‘Mr, Jexnes. I am going to show you those papers in a little while.

Mr, De Mounenscumpr. Those memoirs I think are very sincere. ‘They ex-
plain more or less the sincere attitude of a man, sincere opinion of a man.

‘Mr. Jexwes. Before I show you any papers, I want you to finish this reasoning
of yours. i

Mr. Dz Monnenecuizpr, I did not take him seriously—that is all,

Mr. Jenner. I know you didn’t. Why didn’t you? =

Mr. De Mounenscaipr. Well—

Mr. Jesner. You are a bighly sophisticated person.

Mr. Dz Monnexecuiior. Well, he was not sophisticated, you see. He was #
semieducated hillbilly. And you cannot take such a person serfously. All his
opinions were crude, you see. But I thought at the time he was rather sincere.

‘Mr. Jenner. Opinion sincerely held, but crude?

Mr. De MonneNnscutor. Yes.

Mr. Jenner. ‘He was relatively uneducated.

Mr. De Mourenscuitpr. Oh, yes.
