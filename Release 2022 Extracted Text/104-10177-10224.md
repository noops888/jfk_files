1, tleadquarters agrees that Subject 1s probably not identical with
Ivan {vanovich UBYESXCV (201-121531) as vas earlier believed, and has
accordingly assigned ivan imttriyevich 201-779495 « A full Headquarters
trace under that name tired up no inforwation other than that originating
from Nexico City Station, which has now been re-classified into the new
file, We axe puzzled by the fact that MEX1-1850, dated 1 Septeaber 1962, the
first piece of correspondence from Mexico City Station on Subject, reported
him as Ivan Ivanovich,

2. A photo comparison of the two individuals in this case fe not
satisfactory proof that they ex in fact two people because of the difference
in years and exposure in the photographs. The pre-ifexico City traces on
Ivan Ivanovich reflect only a date and place of birth as identifying data.

It Ls hoped that Mexico City Station can obtain soon identifying blographic
data on Ivan Daitriyevich in order to firaly resolve the matter.
