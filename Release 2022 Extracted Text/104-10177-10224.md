1- OBYEDKOV ACTED AS A GUARD AT THE SOVIET EMBASSY IN MEXICO

CITY, ALTHOUGH HE APPEARED TO BE BETTER. EDUCATED THAN HIS DUTIES AS

A GUARD WOULD DEMAND. AMONG HIS MAIN DUTIES, HE TENDED THE SOVIET

EMBASSY TELEPHONE, STOOD GUARD DUTY AT THE GATE, TOOK MESSAGES FOR SERER

OTHER SOVIETS, NOTIFIED THEM OF MEETINGS, AND ARRANGED APPOINTMENTS.

HE ALSO OCCASIONALLY DROVE ONE OF THE EMBASSY CARS ON ERRANDS.

DURING HIS TEHRAN TOUR, HE WAS ALSO LISTED AS A GUARD AT THE SOVIET

EMBASSY. HE WAS OBSERVED TO BE VERY SECURITY CONSCIOUS. Y

•

2. ON BOTH PRECEDING TOURS OBYEDKOV APPEARED TO FUNCTION AS A

LEGITIMATE GUARD AND WAS NEVER OBSERVED IN THE ACT OF PERFORMING

ANY INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES. BECAUSE A SOVIET IS LISTED AS A GUARD

AT A SOVIET EMBASSY, IT DOES NOT FOLLOW THAT HE IS NECESSARILY A

OFFICER. SINCE WE HAVE NO EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT

AN

AFFILIATION WE WILL NO LONGER CARRY HIM AS SUSPECT

10. PERSOVALITY, CHARACTER, AND HABITS:

Although Subject acted

as a guard at the Soviet Embassy

in Mexico, he appeared to be fairly well educated and was

not subservient to any of the other Soviets, with the

exception of Counselor Boris Aleksandrovich KAZANTSEV .

(201÷028975). On one occasion Subject was reported to be

helping the daughter of Commercial Counselor Georgiy

Stepanovich VISKO with her arithmetic homework. On another,

Subject was

asked

about methods of producing metal wire,

a subject

on which

Subject was well informed as a result of

his having once worked for a wire factory.

Subject had

a tape recorder at home which he liked to

• listen to.

le also occasionally went fishing with other Soviets. •

Subject told "Boris" in Moscow to build a large garage,

because he was bringing a big car back with him. He also

asked whether Boris had bought a refrigerator and TV for the

apartnent. On another occasion he was negotiating for a can

of paint to tako bagk to Moscow with him to repaint "che

Moskvich".

Subject and his wife were both buying watches

just before leaving Mexico. From the above it appears

that Subject was fairly well-off financially, for a guard.

accordingly assigned ivan Enltriyevich 201-779495. A full Headquarters

trace under chat name tired up no inforastion other than that originating

fron Nexico ilty Station, which has now been re-classified into the new

first plece of correspondance fron Mezdeo City Station on Subject, reported

A photo comparison of the two individuals in this case do not

satisfactory proof that they ar in fact two people because of the difference

in years and exposure in the photographs.

The pre-Mexico City traces on

Ivan Ivanovich reflect only a date and place of birth as identitying data.

It Is hoped that Mexico City Station can obtain soon identifying blographie

data on Ivan Daltriyevich in order to firaly resolve the matter.
