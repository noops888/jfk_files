concerning the origin of the paper, envelope, typewriter, and
ink used. If you have any capability for comparing this letter
with other correspondence originating with the Chinese Comaunist
Entassy in Stockholm, we would like your opinion on whether or
not the stationery, typewriter, and envelope are of the type
normally used by that Embassy.

2. Because of the sensational nature of the contents of
the letter and the necessity for our checking out such allega-
tions as quickly and thoroughly as possible, it is requested
; that this technical analysis be undertaken on a priority basis
Hy \ and that the undersigned by notified by phone as soon as any
conclusions are reached. ©

3- Please acknowledge the receipt of the attached letter
and ensure that its whereabouts, when in your custody, is a
matter of record. We prefer that the letter and envelope be
kept as intact as possible while undergoing technical analysis.

must assassinate Kennedy. We etablised contact with Oswald already
when he was in Sowiet but then to try to get him as a spy for China.

Later he was spy for us. When Lee H Oswald had returned fo USA we

for us" and told him what could happen to him if FBI got informed.
Now we had him. He got his last information in Mexico. /It was not
good to assassinate Kennedy in wexico/ “Fair Play for Cuba" was
started only to confuse and throw the blame on Castro Zor the as-
ssassineted. Our government thought that USA should attack Cuba
when Kennedy was murded as the orginaztion was behind the assassin-

himself. Iv that was so it would burden Sowiet that Oswald had visi-
ted. We should be allieted with Sowiet then we would ask them for A-
bombs and they should not be able to refuse us. We and Sowiet should
win this war and whole the world should be Commnistic. Then we should
assassinate Krustjev and other Sowiet leaders and we would be leader
