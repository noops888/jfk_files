LV T-87 advised that following the KEFAUVER hearings in

JERRY CATENA combine sent CHARLES TURNER, AARON WEISBERG, arid’ MYRON
FRIEDMAN to Las Vegas, to look after their interests.“ Informant’
advised in 1960, that TURNER was a small-time Elizabeth and Newark,
New Jersey gambler when chosen to go to Las Vegas, but has made a
lot of money and is a highly trusted employee.

LV T-51 advised in 1961, that he knows that TURNER is
DOC STACHER's representative in the Sands Hotel. .He. knows that
TURNER has a two per cent interest in the Hotel, and is not an
owner of record. In addition to his regular salary, he receives
a return on his two per cent undisclosed interest. TURNER is one
who counts two of three shifts daily, which indicates he is
trusted, as well as having power. He said in addition to STACHER
he believes that JERRY CATENA, Newark, New Jersey hoodlum, is
responsible for TURNER being at the Sands Hotel, ae

LV 7-13. advised that at one time CARL COHEN fired CHARLES
TURNER from the Sands Hotel. Within less than 24 hours, there was
a meeting at the Sands Hotel which was attended by DOC STACHER, ~
vho nearly tore COHEN apart verbally, and asked COHEN who in "hell"
did he think he was to fire a man like TURNER. | He was then :
instructed to go to TURNER, get down on his knees and apologize,
and to have TURNER on the payroll by evening. The informant said
COHEN did as instructed and was greatly upset over the fact that
he might have put himself and his career in dire jeopardy over the
incident.
