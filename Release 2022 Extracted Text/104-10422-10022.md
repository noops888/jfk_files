treated under Question (1) above. As this information was received

in Headquarters it was compared with existing information, if any,

synthesized, analyzed, and then made available to the White House,

the Department of State, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

Copies of these dessimentations were also forwarded to the Secret

Service:
fering guidance, and, when necessary, coordinating with the appro-

priate United States government agency - primarily the FBI.- when

the investigation involved an’ American citizen. “Most; if not all,

leads originating in the field were persons claiming to have know-

ledge of OSWALD or his wife. Investigation revealed that the

majority of these leads were fabricators.
