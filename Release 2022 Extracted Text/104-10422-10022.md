2022 RELEASE UNDER THE PRESIDENT JOHN F. KENNEDY ASSASSINATION RECORDS ACT OF 1992

(1) What Collection requirements were issued to the field with

regard 'to Kennedy's assassination?

As soonias the name of Lee OSWALD was mentioned in connection.

with the assassination of President Kennedy on 22 November. CIA

file checks were begun and the Mexico City Station was asked by

cable for more information on OSWALD. Within a week twenty-seven

cabled reports had been sent to the White House, the Department of

State, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

CIA field stations provided bits of information during the

week after the assassination. The Mexico City Station reviewed the

transcripts- of its telephone taps and came up with several more

conversations probably involving OSWALD, but not actually mention-

ing him by name; these transcripts connected him also to the Cuban

Consulate in Mexico City. Several Mexicans were arrested and

questioned

about his activities, giving a good picture of what he

was really up to.. A host of fabricators, some anonymous, bombarded

overseas embassies with spurious tips on the case. All of these

leads were soon discredited, but they were still coming in.

In light of OSWALD's defection to the Soviet Union where he

had remained for almost three years and his trip to Mexico City

where he had contact with members of the Cuban and Soviet Con-

sulates, the possibility that OSWALd had not aeted upon his own-

but may have been an agent in a plot under foreign direction could

not be dismissed without exhaustive exploitation of all available

foreign assets.

As the Agency responsible for the collection of foreign coun-

terintelligence information, it was the Agency's responsibility

to support the Federal Bureau of Investigation in its investigation

of the President's assassination by

a. Obtaining detailed information on every aspect of OSWALD's

activities and movements abroad;

b.. Studying this information in light of the Agency's know-

ledge of the mission and operations of foreign intelligence

services - particularly the Cuban and Soviet services, and

(2.)

What follow-up of these requirements was there during 1964?

(3)

What form did the follow-up take?

The initial response to headquarters' requirements levied

on the field, after the assassination of the President, has been

treated under Question (1) above. As this information was received

in Headquarters it was compared with existing information, if any,

synthesized, analyzed, and then made available to the White House,

the Department of State, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

Copies of these dessimentations were also forwarded to the Secret

Service.

Headquarters examined all new leads sent in by the field, of-

fering guidance, and, when necessary, coordinating with the appro-

priate United States government agency - primarily the FBI. - when

" the investigation involved an'

American citizen. "Most; if not all,

leads originating in the field were persons claiming to have know-

ledge of OSWALD or his wife. Investigation revealed that the

majority of these leads were fabricators.

In light of the urgency of the investigation being conducted

by the FBI, all correspondence between Agency Headquarters and Its

field units was in cable form. If necessary, messages could be

passed by telephone

Agency field representatives in the Mexico City Station and

the Miami Base worked closely with the local FBI representative

keeping the latter continually apprised of all information pertain-

ing to the investigation as it became

available, to-the-Station.

The Mexico City Station and Miami Base were able to respond immedi-

ately to requirements levied by the local FBI representative:. The

field reported to Headquarters on all information passed in the

field to the FBI or received from the FBI representative so that

Headquarters could make a formal dissemination to the appropriate

government agency or department in Washington.
