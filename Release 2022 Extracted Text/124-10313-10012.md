could have been obtained by people already in Mexico. Mora claimed

that date with Mora.

Prior to his departure from Mexico, Greenspan

got into a dispute with Mora who was trying to secure Mexican citizen-

ship.

One of Greenspan's children remarked,

"Do you know that Betty

Mora

can't be ot an use to my daddy until the tresident or Mexico

signs her citizenship papers which are on his desk?"

A large stack of

books and pamphlets which Mora described as of a very inflamatory nature

and some of which had been banned from Mexico, were delivered to Mora's

home for Greenspan.

Mora accused Greenspan of jeopardizing her position

in Mexico.

Greenspan gave her the money to pay for the pamphlets and

said he would pick them up.

He never came by for the pamphlets,

therefore Mora sold them and donated the proceeds to the PCM.

She said

she would write to Greenspan and thank him for the contribution.

Before she could complete the arrange-
