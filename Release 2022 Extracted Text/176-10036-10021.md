ACTION DEPARTMENT 631, INFORMATION LEOPOLDVILLE 535, USUN 387
LIMIT DISTRIBUTION S/S
In discussion with UK Consul Dodson and myself last night,

local UN representative Mathu bitterly criticized local In-
dian UN commander who he claimed “wanted start fighting so they

‘ could kill blacks and go back. home with decorations". Dwelt

particularly on September 12 patrol incident and October 8
Post Office patrol affair (CONTEL 569). Said-he considered
substance UN commpmiques both these occasions (which he signed) .
untruthful, I told. Mathu that.information on .which Noronha
acted night of October 8 was from Consulate sources

anfl that did not consider, given character of infor-
mation, that we had any real choice-but to pass it on-rapidly
as possibly} correct or Noronha. any choice -but to act on.it
same basis. Said did not believe slightest intention Noronha's
part provoke incident.

‘Mathu said he glad learn these supplementary facts which In-

dians had not given him. However, he then. resumed criticism
of Indians, claiming they told him nothing and harbored secret
designs.

‘It obvious Mathu smarting under criticism from Gardiner during

recent visit on failure maintain upper hand over UN military
here and similar criticism from Bunche, who apparently sent
Gardiner telegram after Post Office affair asking whether
Mathu boss in Elisabethville or Indians. As Consulate report-
ing as indicated, charge that Mathu has not firmly established

control over UN military, especially Indians, and.that this
is evidenced in.their repeated failure to’ inform. him promptly

-and: fully, is well based, Believe Gardiner-Bunche approach at

this point will help stiffen: Mathu and. tone down Indians.
However, aside from overly. professional military posture on
which we. have commented, have seen no evidence here during
past two months to justify charge of separate aggressive In-
dian policy on part local Indian officers. As. frequently,
outbreak of dispute over civilian control of military reflects

‘differing capacities of individuals involved. In addition,

as previously noted, Mathu lacks organizational. back-up to
cope with tight, professional Indian staff. _

Further, believe as stated Noronha patrol action October 8
justified by circumstances and in no sense evidence of aggres-
sive intent. Should note that attempt was made pass same
information Mathu but no answer (Mathu says previously unable
hear phone from library at night, had phone installed bedroom
two days ago) and that though Indian patrol stationary, rather
than mobile, men did not descemt from trucks,. take up positions,
or otherwige.act in menacing way. Noronha may. have ‘had obji-
gation make further effort reach Mathu -before ordering patrol
but.was late at night and operational. requirement was immed-
iate, He made typical error, however, of not fully informing
Mathu of patrol.until 1700 next day.

Above for background only; as far as local situation .concerned,
do not believe Mathu will at. this time take action aggravating
personal re/@tions now that has blown off steam. Possible :

_Embassy Leopoldville and USUN may wish consider giving Gardiner

and Bunche further details background October 8 patrol if they
believe this would reduce unnecessary friction among UN com-
ponents. :
