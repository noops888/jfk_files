aim going to talk about intelligence collection, the procese of targetting,

and the process of exploitation. However, in contrast to the other

speakere'in the seminar, I'am. going to discuss you as a target.

tor most of us serving inthe Directorate of Science and Tech-

nology or the Directorate of Intelligence, security on a daily basis

: ~ that your safe fe closed at night. During the day we associate with our
colleagues who wear badges to testify to the fact they -have been cleared.
Outsiders who come into view also wear badges indicating that they too
; have been cleared. Thus wrapped in thie cloak provided us by security,
few of us give much thought to the fact that a major power with endless
funda considers the United States and in particular the Central Intelli-
gence Agency to be the "main enemy, the primary adversary, the

prime target." There is documentary proof of this. Ian go on to
