Venezuela

a.

The country's six presiden-

tial

candidates have swung into the

nome stretch of their campaigns.

So have the terrorists, who are still

trying hard to sabotage next Sunday's

vote.

b. There is little doubt that

the terrorist effort has all-out

Cuban support.. Castro looks on

Venezuela as his prime target in

Latin America and would do everything

in his power to prevent president

Betancourt from finishing his term.

C.

So far, the terrorists have

tried to intimidate the candidates.

by harassing political rallies, bomb-

ing their party headquarters in

various cities, and threatening them

with assassination.

They have tried

to scare voters from the polls by

creating a general atmosphere of law

lessness. Kidnappings, like the one

yesterday morning of Colonel Chenault,

are part of the pattern.

d.

The government counterattack

Is under the personal direction of

Betancourt, who is as determined to

finish out

his term and turn over

power to a freely-elected successor

as Castro is to prevent this.

e.

Yesterday it was announced

that the carrying of firearms by

anyone outside the security forces

was forbidden until the elections

are over.

. Some 3,000 reservists have

been called up to protect the polls.

Leaves are being cancelled and all

security forces are maintaining a

high state of alert.

2.

We now have a fuller ac-

count from official US sources of

the Viet Cong attack on two mountain

villages mentioned in Tuesday's

Checklist.

b. This account makes it clear

that the earlier press

versions,

•which spoke of 1,000 missing vil-

lagers, were highly colored.

c. Our present information

is that the attack, in company

strength, was successfully repulsed.

The Viet

Cong suffered some 30 cas-

ualties; government losses were six

killed,

three wounded and 39 missing.

d. As is usual in these cases,

the villagers began to trickle back

once the Viet Cong left.

This episode aside,

a number of indications that the

Communists will try to sustain the

higher level of military activity

they have kept up since the coup.

f. The Communist radio has

called for more attacks in an effort

to destroy strategic hamlets and

"develop" Viet Cong forces.

there are some Indians who have

doubts about the Soviet willingness

to live up to the letter of their

military aid agreements with New

Delhi.

a. Ne Win has followed up his

action In breaking off talks with

the Burmese Communists by arresting

Ne Win had been trying to

lure the faction-ridden Communists

into a "national front." However,

he found the demands of the Commu-

nist negotiators, some of whom had

only just returned from long exile

in Peiping, to be impossible.

C. This will probably lead to

renewed fighting between the army

and Communist guerrillas in the hills.

d. More trouble can also be

expected from the rebellious ethnic

minorities like the Karens and the

Cambodia.

Kachins, whose demands for greater

autonomy have been rejected in Ran-

goon.

e.

Us officials on the spot

doubt that the army, hobbled by poor

leadership and its many political

responsibilities, will be any more

effective in dealing with the prob-

lem this time than in past anti-

insurgency campaigns.

a. Sihanouk has signed an ac-

cord setting up regular air service

between Cambodia and Communist China.

A similar agreement with Hanoi is

in the works.

b. These lines are significant

largely as gestures by Peiping and

Hanoi to bolster Sihanouk's sense

of importance. Neither would be a

paying proposition commercially and

both could flounder before the first

paying passenger enplanes unless

rights to overflv Laos

can be obtained.

a. It looks more and more as

If Papandreou, who squeaked through

to a narrow upset victory over ex-

premier Karamanlis in the 3 November

elections, will not be able

to form

a government.

b.

His party does not have

parliamentary majority, so

he needs

support from either Karamanlis

party on the right or from the Com-

munists.

Brazil

c. The military has

let

it be known that it would consider

Papandreou's acceptance of Communist

support as sufficient reason for a

coup d'etat.

d.

Should Papandreou fail to

form a government, the palace intends

to pass the mandate to Karamanlis,

believing that he too would fail.

e. This would then onen the

way

for a

compromise premier more amenable to

palace influence.

a. President Goulart and his

opponents are keeping political ten-

sions in Brazil high.

D. Comments by Goulart, thai

"social disaster" is sure if his

program is not passed soon, have drawn

sharp rejoinders from moderate and

conservative figures and have fed

rightist coup plotting.

C .

Strains are also growing in

the military following the arrest

of a young officer who refused last

month to execute an order to arrest

Governor Lacerda, a leading conserva-

tive spokesman and likely presidential

candidate.

Rumania-US

Rumanian officials are about to award

a US 11rm,

Ferguson and Company of Cleveland, Ohio,

a $32 million contract to help build the huge Galati

steel plant.

The Rumanians are pressing ahead with

this project in the face of Soviet efforts to dis-

courage it in various ways, most importantly by re-

fusing to underwrite the scheme to any substantial

degree.

The New Turkey Party has followed the

seem bent on making trouble between

Some 3,000 of their number were reported

yesterday

to be moving toward the frontier. They

have little military capability, but blood could

flow and require UN intervention.
