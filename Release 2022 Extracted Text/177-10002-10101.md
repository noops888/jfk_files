VENEZUELA

+ Selacted rand



1.

Venezuela

a. The country's six presiden-
tial candidates have swung into the
home stretch of their campaigns.

So have the terrorists, who are still
trying hard to sabotage next Sunday's
vote,

b. There is little doubt that
the terrorist effort has all-out
Cuban support. Castro looks on
Venezuela as his prime target in
Latin America and would ‘do everything
in his power to prevent President
Betancourt from finishing his term,

ce. So far, the terrorists have
tried to intimidate the candidates
by harassing political rallies, bomb-
ing their party headquarters in
various cities, and threatening them
with assassination. They have tried
to scare voters from the polls by
creating a general atmosphere of law-
lessness. Kidnappings, like the one
yesterday morning of Colonel Chenault,
are part of the pattern,

d. The government counterattack
is under the personal direction of
Betancourt, who is as determined to
finish out his term and turn over
power to a freely-elected successor
as Castro is to prevent this.

South Vietnam

e, Yesterday it was announced
that the carrying of firearms by
anyone outside the security forces
was forbidden until the elections
are over.

f£. Some 3,000 reservists have
been called up to protect the polls.
Leaves are being cancelled and all
security forces are maintaining a
high state of alert.

a. We now have a fuller ac-
count from official US sources of
the Viet Cong attack on two mountain
villages mentioned in Tuesday's
Checklist,

b. This account makes it clear

that the earlier press versions,
‘which spoke of 1,000 missing vil-

lagers, were highly colored.

ce. Our present information

is that the attack, in company

strength, was successfully repulsed.
The Viet Cong suffered some 30 cas-=
ualties; government losses were six
killed, three wounded and 39 missing.

dad. As is usual in these cases,
the villagers began to trickle back
+ once the Viet Cong left.

e. This episode aside, we see
‘a number of indications that the
Communists will try to sustain the
higher level of military activity
“they have kept up since the coup.

£. The Communist radio has
called for more attacks in an effort
to destroy strategic hamlets and
"develop" Viet Cong forces. |

3. Israel

4. USSR-India

ce
there are some Indians who have
doubts about the Soviet willingness
to live up to the letter of their
military aid agreements with New
Delhi.

5.

Burma

a. Ne Win has followed up his
action in breaking off talks with
the Burmese Communists by arresting
over 700 of their number.

b. Ne Win had been trying to
lure the faction-ridden Communists
into a "national front." However,
he found the demands of the Commu-
nist negotiators, some of whom had
only just returned from long exile
in Peiping, to be impossible.

c. This will probably lead to
renewed fighting between the army
and Communist guerrillas in the hills.

d. More trouble can also be
expected from the rebellious ethnic
minorities like the Karens and the

Cambodia

Greece

Kachins, whose demands for greater
autonomy have been rejected in Ran-
goon,

e. US officials on the spot
doubt that the army, hobbled by poor
leadership and its many political
responsibilities, will be any more
effective in dealing with the prob-
lem this time than in past anti-
insurgency campaigns.

a. Sihanouk has signed an ac~
cord setting up regular air service
between Cambodia and Communist China,
A similar agreement with Hanoi is
in the works.

b. These lines are significant
largely as gestures by Peiping and
Hanoi to bolster Sihanouk's sense
of importance. Neither would be a
paying proposition commercially and
both could flounder before the first
paying passenger enplanes unless

rights to overflv 7] can be obtained.

a. It looks more and more as
if Papandreou, who squeaked through
to a narrow upset victory over ex-
premier Karamanlis in the 3 November
elections, will not be able to form
a government.

8.

Brazil

b. His party does not have a
parliamentary majority, so he needs
support from either Karamanlis'
party on the right or from the Com-
munists

c. The military has let
it be known that it would consider |
Papandreou's acceptance of Communist
support as sufficient reason for a
coup d'etat.

Should Papandreou fail to :
form a government, the palace intends
to pass the mandate to Karamanlis,
believing that he too would fail,

en the
way) for a
compromise premier more amenable to

palace influence.

a. President Goulart and his
opponents are keeping political ten-
sions in Brazil high.

(Cont'd)

b. Comments by Goulart, that
"social disaster" is sure if his
program is not passed soon, have drawn
sharp rejoinders from moderate and
conservative figures and have fed
rightist coup ‘plotting.

c. Strains are also growing in
the military following the arrest
of a young officer who refused last
month to execute an order to arrest
Governor Lacerda, a leading conserva-
tive spokesman and likely presidential
candidate.

NOTES

USSR.

Rumania-US Rumanian officials are about to award
a US firm, Ferguson and Company of Cleveland, Ohio,
a $32 million contract to help build the huge Galati
steel plant. The Rumanians are pressing ahead with
this project in the face of Soviet efforts to dis-
courage it in various ways, most importantly by re-
fusing to underwrite the scheme to any substantial
degree, e

Turkey The New Turkey Party has followed the
Peasant Party in withdrawing from the present three-
party coalition government, This means that the
coalition has to all intents and purposes collapsed,
even though no formal action will be taken until
Prime Minister Inonu returns from Washington this
weekend,

Indonesia Djakarta is giving every indication that
It will hold up final action on the long-pending oil
contracts with US companies in an attempt to smoke
us out on the question of US aid policy toward Indo-
nesia,

Rwanda-Burundi Tribal refugees from Rwanda, now in
Burundi, seem bent on making trouble between the two
countries, Some 3,000 of their number were reported
yesterday to be moving toward the frontier. They
have little military capability, but blood could
flow and require UN intervention.
