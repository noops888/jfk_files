The 901 system pioNah Wy N — a person of specific in-
terest to the Operations oN etdrate and for controlling and filing all pertinent

information about that person. The systern also provides a means for identifying
subjects of 201 files from various categories of information about them and for
producing lisits of 201 personalities according to those categories. Only a rela-
tively small number of personalities indexed are of sufficient interest to justify
opening a 201 dossier. These are, normally subjects of extensive reporting and
Cl investigation, prospective agents and sources, members of groups and organi-
zations of continuing target interest, or subjects on whom a volume of corre-
spondence has accumulated.

2. THE 201 SYSTEM

The principal features of the 201. system are:

a. The 201 Number: a unique number, ie., 201-1234567, assigned to each
individual in the system to serve as mea ‘« ber for reporting'on that
individual.

b. The 201 Dossier: the o osticfal fle nal ing Ss 201 opening form (Form

©. The Master 20) Me aM generated by the opening of
a 201 file. This record produ cS 201 reference for the Main Index and
stores the pertinent informatidh which may later be retrieved! for special listings.

Index Search Request, is printed as illustrated below. When data are absent

within the record, succeeding data items or lines will be moved up and the ref-
erence consolidated.

Purging a 201 dossier is the responsibility of the desk officer. It requires
discrimination in recognizing operationally  weeful material, rather than the
simple distinction between official a ial papers; it will therefore take
place under the supervision of an icer. Purging should be done
periodically. A 201 dossier bé to Central Files for retention should
