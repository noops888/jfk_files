Now this would not mean, however, that the Secratary of

Mr. Inderfurth. 7 think that's in relation to helping

past, the board of. national estimates insrlated the DCI
from pressures.

Senator Iart. Chile, Ancola, all these cases where the
nCI comes in and says we don't really want to do that but the
President made us, does. he bring in the senior advisor to the
president and say, Llevely.: Vhompson doesn'*+ want us to, either.

Mr, Lombard. IT think park of the nroblem here. senator, |

in which foreian policy was evolved Turina that administmation |
Parbans as #® Matter of fach ik's been criticized as being overly
formalistic and the board of estimates was viewed as being

So it isn't really just 2 cuestion. To would ardue,

of seeing where the curr: system takes us. It's a matter of
Inoking at what we have learned as a result oi our inquiry

and saying, in fact. this. ts anina to be an imnediment and it

is my personal opinion and T think supnorted at least by some
testimony that that would he the case.

The second argument. 1 think, is a somewhat broader one,
and I-quess T'm not. prenare:| to make it. aoe we've had an
incuiry iyto the CIA, some of its problems. some of its
accountability problems. some of its manacement problems, and

as a result of this inquiry there is..at least it strikes fhe

as being some. inconsistency to he araued hetveen having this
broad inaniry and ending un vith a much stronger, larser,. and
more powerful Central Intelligence Aqency ‘n every respect
with areater authority. ever other elements of the intelligence
community.

Now vou can only carry that so far but it seems to me

that there 1s a serious nastion here as to, and it is seen in
nart by other elements of the intelligence community who really
are concerned. that by wearing the two bats’, the DCI will still
really be renreasenting the Aeancy vis a vis their particular

agencies like NSA and the others

the Committee would want to take a position about recruitment

Mr. diGenova. My position is this, Bill. The first

and corclusions. I never saw a hearing on it, I never saw a

document about it, I never had a chance to comment on it as

a desianee, and I never had a chance to bring it up with my

Senator.

to say this, without having snmething in a report about wit
the nractice is, how it's been conducted, who has obiested to
it. what's the extent of it. before we start making a

The next question that’ was put to, I believe, the chief

of the FRD was do you have any regulations that prohibited
you from doing.the same thing with an American company? And
the answer was no, we don't, although we don't do that or
we haven't done that or something to that effect.

That is essentially the story and how it came to pass.

Mr. Maxwell. There's some question on both of these

Then the question arose abcut the deadline on the 15th
and the-Chairman is going to ask that this deadline be set
aside because of the problems of not being able to finish:
security and those other matters.

So he is taking steps to do that now.

Senator Huddleston. Put I think it's still encumbent
on us to make a special effort to move as fast as al ssa nd
we plan to to ahead toniqht. i

Okay, now we get back,

Mr. Kirbow. Mr. Chairman, on that narticular thing, at
2 the staff level I had bracketed that entire paragraph hecause

4 there.

5 | This is probably the most difficult task that faces.

7. is to establish whether or not a defector. that you have just
8 | picked up is a double agent or -not. ;
9 I listened to the man who has done this all his adult

life at the Agency, Mr: Angleton, and he never made it clear

14 || just how you ever are sure that vou have a bona fide.

jal And then his follow-on said basically the same things j

CIA as to the hona fides a a defector and there's no way for
the government to come tc a decision about it.

And this really makes that point and leads to the a!
voint that we believe there ought to be some mechanism whereby
some decision can be reached. Now people may still have
reservations, as. they do about this particular individual we
refer to here. But in the end one has to make a decision and
simolv keeving him in a jail some place is vrohably net a
useful wav, to proceed, and in fact, this is the kind of
recommendation that comes from Mr. Angleton and seéms to be

supvorted by other neople. even his successor at the Agencd,.
A

Mr. Kirbow. Do we have any place in our findings Cite
discusses the so-called. this single case of some sort here?
Is there some evidence?

Mr. Aaron. Yes.

Mr. Kirbow. It's going to be in the report when somebody
else reads this? whey '14 be able to go some place else and
sage what von're talking ahout?

Mr. Aaron, That's correct. It will be in, I helieve it's
in the paper on counter-intelliaeance, It's. also addressed
in the Pockefeller Commission xrenert. :

Now as the first recommendation. I think that we have
anread at the staff level to hake out. the bracke!s and cut a

footnote which would make tb clear that while the nrimary

mission of che CIA would ha to collect dented or mrotected foreign

TOP SECRET

, intelliaaence information. that this would not, vou know. that

BN BR :

at the same time the Agency could be directed to perform such
other collection tasks as cdlirected by the NSC.

In other words, the point is that certainly they do

gnome overt collection. for example, foreign broadcast information

service is done by them as a service and so forth. But at. the»

same time the point of aiving the CIA a-charter' is to give ie:

on and as set forth NSCID 5,

a.charter for its primary mis
for exammle. that mission is to conduct esnionaqde.

Senator Mathias. What ahout the role of statistical
analysis? what kind of analysis that can be deduced ftom %
study of voluminous quantity of sconouic information much
of which is public?

I'll qo back to the hall bearings. the ball bearing
factory.

Mr. Aaron. Well, this gees to the point really of...

a organization of this section. There's a separate section

on the production of intellisence which would authorize the
CIA to produce national intsllicence. That kind of thing. The

Central Intelligence Agency as the producer of national

intelligence must he the vecinient of all intelligence flowing

into our overall national intelligence effort, and that -|-

intellicence ineludes crevt intelligence as collected from

the Treasury Nenartmant. from Commerce from Labor athaches

abroad. the full scone of fpfermation cellectina, mest of which

2 || vould be their job to comrile it.

ey And that does not’ exclude other functions. For example,

the analytical function is not mentioned here. This is simply

to dive it the collection function and that is because the

8 paper is simply organized in that fashion. It doesn't try to
7 step up to the whole charter, every aspect of it. We just try

to break it down.

cli Mr., Maxwell. Should there be a kind of overt foreign
o || intelligence which the NSC with the mechanism for allotating
VW priorities within the intelligence community should

12 || done by the CIA?

12 It could under the formulation now do that.

Mr. Aaron. That's why for examole there's one thing that!

.5 || they do that's overt. Even their clandestine people abroad

16 do an overt collection job and that is biographic information

i7 | and that, while tt was once in the State Department, was

1g || transferred to the CIA because they have a lot of clandestine
19 || bioaraphic information and as a matter of centralizing and H

an || dfficiency the decision was made to move it over there. :

further to say that there sould be an annual review of this
activity by the Senate oversight committee and by the
counter-intelligence committee which we proposed be established
and has been. agreed age as a recommendation of the National
Security Council.

Now the further sentence that is in brackets calls upon
the Attorney General to certify to the President and to:
the oversight committee that these actions are being tsken in
a manner that does not violate the Constitutional rights of
American citizens or anv other provision of lay.

Trving to keep track of the domestic intelligence
recommendations is a little hit Like painting a moving tratn,
but this cee to coincide with their recommendation, and the
nurnose of this is obviously to place a little tighter
restriction and more authoritv in the hands of the Attorney
General to ensure that these domestic espionage-related actions
that are conducted on a covert or clandestine basis are in
fact not infringing on Constitutional rights or attempting to

break the law in any way.

Mr. Kirbow. You're really talking about recruitments

now. You're not talkina shout other clandestine and covert

activities and operations?
Mr, Aaron, That's correct. It's not, for exemple, if
vou vere te establish a hase in Florida for the purvoges of

harassing Cuban shipping, That would not. come up hers.

Mr. Kirbow. And tha bracketed information, Mr. Chairman,
was that I didn't feel at the time we considered this and I
asked that it be bracketed, that the Attorney General who is “
never going to operate in this area alone, he is not going
to make these decisions without staff support of some descriptid
and if he's going to do that with people in the Department of
wJuistice, which.is where he gets the staff, the concern of. the
people in the Agency about broadening even within their own
agency these people that know about the agent orocurements and
where they are and whom they are is of vital concern. It's
probably one of the most carefully guarded secrets. Even the
axtent that Mr. Colby testified befor? this Committee anda
oath. he said, I don't want to know the names of the agents

because someone may want to decide some day to wrassie it

out of me. I
I don't know what the Attorney General. certifying here :

who is the President's principal man, you have the secretaries

It's a chicken and saq situation.

Mr. Kirbow. You think he should approve the policies or
the actual procurement SE the agent.

Senator Hart. The mrocedures. Nothing in here, I mean
we have araued this thing for 13 months, there's nothing here
that requires the Agency tec fc over names of their sources
or anything like that.

The Attorney General doesn't need to know the names
even more than Bill Colby does. or less. Just to find out Brat
the procedures of violating the laws of this country, thats
all.

Ms. Culbreth, Could I raise another point, Mr.
Chairman?

_It seems to me that one of the concerns that you have
with having the Attorney General certify in this specific

case to the President and also to the oversight’ committee

is a consistent problem that IT think runs throughout our

recommendations.

th the one hand, we are deserihing for accountability
within the Executive Branch of the prober neople, andon the
other hand we are afraid that if we make him accountable, we're

giving him so much nower that thay are going to disradard the

Senator Huddleston. If in his ovinion.

Senator Mathias: I wouldn't have any trouble with that.

Mr. Maxwell. I have one other point on that paragraph
and that is it provides for annual review by the counter-
intelligence committee of the National Security Council.

I had understood we were dealing with the recruitment -

| of aqents for the United Statas foreian intelligence purposes,

and the question is whether the counter intelligence committee
which was toa focus on resoliving issues involving the bona
tides of defectors, issues hetveen the FBI and CIA, would be

the body which would have the appropriate knowledae in the
positive intelligence value, or whether it should be assigned
+o a counter-intelligence function.

It's simply a question of where the responsibility

| should -be allocated for revieving those within the National

Security Council structure, and I wasn't clear whether the

counter-intelligence committee was the appropriate one.
Mr.-Aaron, Well, on that point,.the purpose of setting

Mr. Aaron. I think fhis is the auestion. It aces to
the point not of assistance to the government in general or
even covertly, but assistance to these varticular forces, and
that-I. think does narrow it dawn to the problem.

Senator Iluddlestoen. Chat kind of support do we give the

senurity forces?
Mr. Kirhow. Training.
Mr. Aaron. . We have ju othe nash. ve oon cive them

Mr. Kirbow. A whole spectrum excent for U.S. inilitary

Mr. diGenova.. Some of the nreorictaries were used

for exactly that purpose. to provide training and secure
nrocurement and sale and loan of devices which ultimately
found theix way into the hands of foreian torturers.

We get esinay don't denrive the Agency of any legitimate
source of intelligence bracanss thay themselves claim that they
have never angaded.in this activity knowingly and don't want
to.

They say they den kt vant anything to do with this type
