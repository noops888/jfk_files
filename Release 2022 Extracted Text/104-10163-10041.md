SUBJECT: AdIaida PADROM y Crus - Decision to Nove Her te

1, Brewing Mberally upon date supplied in-UFGA 16512, ;
we reuinded AMBIDDY-1 about our misgivings regerding his 1 t
essociation with Adelaide PADROM y Cruz. He conceded aware-

5. Our query why Adelaida, 1£ obe had ANBIDDY=1"s:
interests at heart, sppeared to have qualus about owning up
in respect to past events, vas Parried by AMBIDUY-1 by elaining
that Adelaide was of course aware of all these Tumors: and had
warned him of possible political embarrassment.

6. Svaluating UFGA 16512 on the basis of cur talk with
AMBIDDY-1, we conclude that its main source has a high batt
average. At least there appears to be « hard core of truth to
Practically all ullegations made, to the extent we ware able
tn check thes out. We would venture ths sivese that, despite
his protestatiuns to the contrary, AMBIDDY-1 is quite conversant

with Adelaida's past history, but can cee no practical gain in

0 telling us. He may reason that an avowal of intent to marry

@ wouen whose antevedents are in fact as described, would seriously

blenish his image and that by pleading ignorance now he can, if
hinge should get out of control, always strike a poece of injured
Amnecence and elicit « "here but for the Grace of God go." ree

, @stion from-his PEPRIME associates.

7. Agreement that all interested parties: would. benefit: by
Weving Adelaide's abode from tha WAVE area to Hicaragus was qeerseete
¥eached on. the basis of AMBIDD¥-1's acceptance of our flat states
‘Want that we view Adelaids as « potential haserd to AMWORLD's and
SUBASK's security. Ye based this Feascning upon numarous- indie -.

REFS: A. UFGA 16512, 15 June 1964
B. DIR 31528

1. Chief, WH requests that an investigation of the truth of
gone of the allegations cade in Ref 4 report be held in abeyance
pending determination whether Subject in fact has decided to leave
PRPRIMG for Nicaragua.

&. Headquarters continues to be interested in additional data
the house in the WAVE area which AMBIDDY-1 intends to
purehase in the name of Nile Messer.

3. If it should turn out that the conditions described in
Ref report are not drastically remedied and continue to poe a
festering threat to the security of ANWORLD, your Station may have
to be requested to investigate. In the meanwhile, ve are hopeful
that Bubject’s removal from the WAVE area will serve to attenuate
this bad situation.

; @. Thanke to Jef A report, ve were able (without going into
tee much sordid detail) to put AMBIDUY-1 on notice that we view his
association with Subject ia the WAVE area as a potential threat. to
AMWOALD's and KUBARK's security and that the political scandal
potential of the exiating situation is equally formidable. We -

EC orpee pepe t fel in. with ANBIDDY.1's suggestion, made during the
latest rreting in Panama city. that he rove the center of his illicit
affair to Manngua where it would be easter to contain unpleasant

promined to hosed our advice, that ne dot permit subject to take
aleng te Ricsragua menbera of her present entourage, singling out
Sdentity:O of Ref A an a particular case in point.

6. It should be xtreseed that AMBIDDY-1 is unwavering in his

Badly maligned and that he has a ready explanation for every “rusor.”
3¢ would have been unvise to attempt coercing hin into discontinuing

which AMYUN-19 belongs), liaison with AMWORLD conducted ne
through AMYUM-19 ipso facto involves KUBARK in factional

strife. We recall that some of the major troubles be- ‘

setting the action mechaniam prior Playa Giron stemmed

from the interference’ of political commissars. Without ri

derogating from the importance of the ideological - i

component in the struggle against AMTHUQ, in any showdown

between the military command and the political functionary

Corps, it behooves us to range KUBARK alongside the

former unless the points at issue manifestly implicate -

PEPRIME security. Under AMWORLD groundrules KUBARK -

eupports AMBIDDY-1 as the commander of an unconventional

varfare instrument, not an exile organization, let alone t
the ideology and aspirations which animate it.

@. The ANYUM opposition group represented by AMBUM-15
@learly desires a share in the decision-making Processes
which KUBARK has entrusted to AMBIDDY-1. While they pay
Aap service to the principle of non-interference in

@-. An emnsculated politics] apparatus in the WAVE
area will deprive AMBIDDY-1 of all excuse to divide his
a between Central America (where he belongs) and the

ares.

h. The tawdry aftermath of the ZENON II raid can
justly be blamed if not on AMYUM, at least on AMBIDDY-1's
political representation in the WAVE area. With that
representation effectively eliminated, one:.of the main
wources of ODYOKE discomfiture will have been effectively
dislocated. Impending changes should ai least eliminate
the AMYUM press and intel sections.

&. Should there be further unpleasantness in the
WAVE area, KUBARK will, once contacts with ANYUM-19 have
ceased, have a base for plausible denial ‘of responsibility
for not preventing it.

dj. , 3f we are to believe certain not altogether

dasged reports, AMBIDDY-1, through his mistress
Adelaida PADRON, has become linked with the exile demi-
monde which moves on. the fringes of common crime and
which is closely intertwined with the remnrate of Batista'’s _
Begine. While AMYUM, and particularly AMYUM-19, nay ‘to
@ome extent serve to. counteract and dlow down theve trends,
they are obviously unable to halt them entirely. Hence,
what little benefit we could have derived from a tie-in
Between AMYUM and AMWORLD hac not been forthcoming.

4t appears, has left AMBIDDY. th the completely erroneous
impression that we were taking sides in the factional dispute
involving AMYUM, in essence backing AMYUM-19 against AMBIDDY-1.
In advising AMBIDDY-1 on the pros and cons of dismissing
GAMBORA (P), AMYU4-19 told AMBIDDY-1 that dismissal would in
all probab@lity spell e break with KUBARK which he must have
known and of which he was subsequently reminded, ran completely
counter to KUBARK's oft. stated position that personnel matters

Bave reinforced AMBIDDY-1's suspicions that RAMBORA was. linked.

take into account that he is fully cognizant of the fact that

what he knows to unauthorised persons, is difficult to assay.
Should he in honest conviction reach the conclusion that he was
shunted aside because. KUBARK ‘considered him an obstacle to -
eatabliehing full sway over AMWORLD, he could easily rationalize
a betrayal. Other "ideological" considerations could be adduced
by him to justify actively opposing KUBARK. .Whatever he may Es
‘do along those lines would not be through inadvertence but by . tn

Gesign. We havewighed.and discarded the possibility of. . Ee

our reading of his prrsonality is correct. We can think of » ie “a

make him think twice before throwing down the gauntlet. ‘To:

provoke the enmity of both AMBIDDY-1 and KUBARK would. be an act
@f defiance of which we consider: AMYUM-19 incapable. Dczides,
AMYUM-19 strikes us as an indivuidal imbued with.a sense of baric
decency and of Christian morality.

Aiaison, even if it entails a rupture in relations with ANYUM-19, He

-Possible Basis for Entente between AMBIDDY-1 and SAMBORA

ACTION REQUIEFD: REFLRLNCES.

1. We advised SAMRORA at a Washington meeting with him,
16 June 1964, that from the way things look to us he had pai ited
himself into a corner from which he could not extricate himself.
Another’ error was to have permitted sumeone like MOLE to block
bis. path to the AMWORLD hierarchy. This in retrospect, however,
is all water over the dan.

2. If SAMBORA ts to perform his functions as we first con-
ceived them he should go to AMBIDDY-1 and arrive at a new understand!
SAMEORA was informed that we intend to meet AMBIDDY-1 before
SAMBORA returne to Miami. At this meeting we intend to state in
no uncertain terms that the security of the organization is ina
@oplorable condition, This perhaps may have the effect of placing

io a more favorable bargaining position. cet

3. We counseled SAMBORA to negotiate a hard contract which
would encompass at least the following terms:

a. He would not wort under nor be responsible to MOLE
‘but only to the highest echelons of AMWORLD hierarchy.

bd. Full access to all files, bases, information needed
to perform a professional job.

@. The complete and unhesitating support of AMBIDOY-1 in
all sacurity matters. A . :

If @ml ie unwilling to accept these terms or offers any restrictings

1. The following AMOT report concerning the not-so-private
affairs of AMBIDDY/1 and his fiaricee may be of interest to

_ BECKHOFF. According to AMYUM/19, AMBIDDY/1 intends to formalize
: his relationship with Iden B sometime within-the next few months.
The marriage wi>1l probably take place in Latin America and Iden
B will make her home there to avoid a public scandal which would
have a harmful effect on the AMYUM organization, Attention is
called to paragraphs 14, 17, and 26 which answer, in part, some of
aul questions raised in ref dispatch concerning ODYOKE involvement

» The Station has forwarded reports of this nature

anion concern claims by members of the Cuban exile community of
KUBARK sponsorship of AMBIDDY/1. Of the specifics cited by the -
Cuban, intelligent or otherwise, to support their allegations
those statements attribued to the AMWORLD principals thumzelves:
appear to be the only ones which can make a claim to “knowledge”
&8 oppesed to conviction based on AMWORLD's affluence. To date
no tangible evidence of KUBARK involvement with AMWORLD has come
to our attention. :

Iden A.

.Source states that she has known AMBIDDY/1 since they
were children in Esmeralda municipal term, Camaguey province, from
where both of them come originally, Source further states she is
also a close friend of Iden B, who is now AMBIDDY/1's mistress

and a homosexual like source (according to source's statements).

introduce to AMBIDDY/1 some important Venezuelans including
Colonel Pulido BARRETO, Carlos ‘SISO (mat. unk.) and Osvaldo

*BAJARES (Venezuclan sconowist). Source states that, at
AMBIDDY/1's request, three meetings were held with those
individuals in source's house. According to AMIDDY/1 the
objective of the meetings was to get support for his plans,
and the objective of the Venezuelans was to overthrow Romulo
BETANCOURT, and they were allied to the National Liberation
Armed Forces (FALN), . The conversations revolved around CASTRO
Leon, The Venezuelans believed they could make a pact with
the Communists and later eliminate them, At that time various
members of FALN came to Miami (source doesn't remember. when).
AMBIDDY/1 assured the Venezuelans he could influence GPFOCUS
and KUBARK to get support for their cause.

Carlos SISO told source he distrusted AMBIDDY/1 and
believed he was a KUBARK penetration to learn all. their plans.
SISO also told source that when Osvaldo BAJARES returned to
: Venezuela he had been arrested, and SISO believed AMBIDDY/1
i on had denounced BAJARES. In the last meeting, SISO told seurce
3 : that.he was going to put AMBIDDY/1 to a test. SISO asked him
“whether it was true he had gone to Haiti on an official mission
as an ODYOKE envoy." _ AMBIDDY/1 was very surprised and said he
had, but insisted in SISO telling him how he had learned that.
: The meetings with the groups of Venezuelans stopped since that
time.

After these happenings, AMBIDDY/1 informed source he
had written a report to the Americans about the Venezuelan .
problem, and that he had treated Rafael CALDERAS very well in
this report because CALDERAS had given him financial assistance.

course lasted 6 weeks and most of the times Iden B used to drive
AMBIDDY/1 in an automobile to.a place in Coral Gables where the q

never had blind confidence in anytiing hunen, because everything
that is done blindly is done badly, it is true that I had con-
fidence. in North Anerican material help, Reason: because we
were seeing it. (I do not think it was a secret to anyone where
the weapons. we used in the invasion came from.) I. had no sorue
ples. in accepting Anerican weapons to offset those from gussia
which Fidel Castro was receiving in gigantic shipments.

after leaving prison I lost coniidence in that assistance
Decause since then not only Lave I seen none, but also I have
not seen the possibility even of getting any.

Dut also my gratitude toward these people who have opened their
arms to offer us help when all doors were being closed against

In the case of the French government I was sorrowful be-
cause of the figure of Gen. DeGaulle. As a young Cuban I used
to hold im my heart the image of DeGaulle, hero of the Second
World war, leader of his country's resistance in the fight
against the foreisn invaders :

It:was hard for ne to realize that this. same man would
turn his back on the principles which made him beloved by the
free world, It ie unfortunate that such a brilliant career

7 should have been darkened at its ending.

In any care, some day Cuba will be free and those govern~

"mente oan be sure that, if they do not alter their conduct, they
“will then receive their payment in the same historical currency

that they have passed out to our martyred people.

are already being turned against. the red beost, The little
western David called Cuba has already let fly the stone which

will imook down the ugly Goliath of communism,



A CQITROVERSIAL F=REONALITY
It can be said of the Secretary General of the Kovezent
for Revolutionary Recovery, Manuel artine, that there is such
to say, but néyer that he has lacked spirit to fight for the
?
liberty of Cuba.
Combative and polemical, artine today occupies a singu-
- : lar position in the ficht against Castro in which he collects
furious insults and almost fanatical proselytiem in equal quan-
tities. Hir early struggle against Batista's dictatorship and
“che aotivity in Sierra Maestra in Colum One. commanded by Fidel
“Gastro, made hin an outstanding figure in the Revolution. His
“ Dreak with Castro and his demnotation of the olive green trea-
ohery “to the great romance of the> ‘cuban: people made him the
\ garget for ail attacks and insults, In the spring of 1960 Ar-
‘time went into exile. -In Mexico he wrote a-bock denouncing
. -Waith-other eminent dembcratic-leaders. he.

“erted intense propaganda and political activity throughout the
continent which oulminsted in the disastrous Bay of Pigs inva-
sion. his was one.of the most critical points in Manuel Ar-
tine'e civic career, His activity in it -- personally heroic
though it was -= helped throw on him the shadow of new attacks
“and suspieions.. But it also converted him'inte a leader of the
first rank which the maturity of:a pricon, ‘term and, his gonspi-
“patorial and revolutionary activities afterward only. enhanced.



Tacuel Artine hee becess todey, by virtue of the attack
of his troops on Puerto Pitén, the principal figure of ourrent
Cuban activity. His group has been hammered into one of the
most disciplined, one of the largest end mst efficient in the
heroic struggle of the people of Cuba for their liberty. Con~

sequently everything he does and says is of passionate interest:

for this people in exile, a people which wants to now closely
- and they should -- the thoughts and activities of the men
who will probably lead them in the future.

@his is why Manuel artine is brought to these, Cuban
pages of BOREITA, which have been, are now end will continue
to be the ideal civic rostrum for the people of Cuba.

would be meeting Al Burt at 1600, A-1 inyuived if it would ~
do any harm in seeing Mr. Summ of the State Department since i
the latter mentioned to AMJAVA-4 that he had not seen A-1
in over a year. A-1 felt that a courtesy visit was called . |
bah We advised A-1 that we could see no harm in visiting
: |

.@,. A-1 reported that one of his pilots, Ginebra, had
Yew-:ivéd an offer to fly planes’in the Congo. A-1 did not
know if Ginebra would accept the offer.

38. We told. A-1 that we had received a report that in
finca in Nicaragua called Marianita he had met several U, 8,
, @ir Force officers and asked if there were any truth to the
report, A-1 stated that ow of their houses is located in
Marianita but he had not met any U. S, officers there,

probably hiding in some small island o7f Puerto Rico.

2.- A-1 inquired if he could sue the Newsweek magazine.

_ We advised him that he could sue Sut the likelihood of him

winning the case was slight. A-1 was referring to the
article which stated he intended to draw the United States
4nto an open conflict with Castro, We asked if there were
any truth to the matter, A-1 laughed aud said, “Of course
not.

8, A-1 was advised that we consider 7 June a firm
date..for the Consejo meeting. The reason we are pinning

’ 4. It is the opinion of the Consejo that s frank,
off-the-record talk with Al Burt of the Miami press would
dono harm, We consider Burt to be a responsible newzpaper- —
man and he may be in a position to help A-1 put the.
Pilon raid in its proper pepspective, If A-1 thinks
this is a good idea he should speak openly to Burt about
the Pilon raid omitting the.embroidery that has accompanied
his recent press statements, A-i was reminded this intere
view, if given, snould not mention or allude to KUBARK
support. Since Burt is an ambitious Journalist he may §
probably ask A-1 iut a scap on his next. raid; again. we see

2 Mey 1966 :
AONORLD MESTING IK WASHIEGTON, D.C. 19 Hay 1966
SUBJECT: AMBIDDY'S PERSOMMEL POLICY

1. auava/4 offered the following analysis of
ABIV0T-1's personnel policy as a significant facct Bee
his relationship with others. ie

2. AMBIDDT-1 is a leader and a very proud leader
who does not like to fail in the presence of his associates.

3. ANJAVA/4 was glad that the Miaal incident (13 May
press conference) happened. "AMBIDDY-1 was really angry
th himself."

4. Prom the start ANJAVA/4 has tried to convince

fol thet Jose MOLE ROSALES is not qualified for
ligence - so far in vain. "To let MOLE fail in

doing the job is the way to convince AMBIDDY-1”"

‘ S. sMTmt-19 cannot handle MOLE or Edgar S070,
Because AMBIDDT<1 won't let him. “We shall have to weit

A

y

considered this en implied attack of ths ssunduess
the Pilon plan which ANBIDOY-1 himself hed dew up.

: 7. Weadqeartere rope pointed out that during the

“seat

t
hos


eritical perioc following the Missi press conrerence,
AMYUM-19 was the only available, cleared channel to
AGIOELD and time, in view of GiACID's unfavorable reaction,
was of the essence. AMJAVA/4 was asked to convey this .
explanation to. AMBIDDY-1 end to stress that ws consider
ANTUM-19 his senior rep in FBPRIME.

8. AWAVA/6 stated that there had been aany betrayals
end consequently AMBIDDY-1 was always carefal. At
he might even think that AMYUH-19 was not loyal which,
AUAVA/4 added, “Of course is not true." As NGIDWoT-1
analyzes hie om performance, he is satisfied that he is
performing well. %« has been in the resistance business
since Batista'’s days and many intimate friends have be-
trayed him. At the prescat moment, he doas not ‘have 1002,
confidence in anyone. verything he is told, he analyses.
As en exaeple, AUAVA/4 briefs Chaves (the Mcxican) on a
projected operation. AMBIDDY-1 will question “AAVA/S
@losely in order to meke sure that the instructions did
wot deviate from the plan as conceived by him. -

9. Among matters which should be teken up with
AMBIDDY-1 direct, no matter how ticklish, was. @.g. the.
ease of ...HOLE. ARUJAVA/4 and AMTUM-19: know. that KUBARK
have a poor opinion of hin. Then why beet around. the
Bush? AMJAVA/4 at least had not witnessed any sention

in fol's prosence.. Instead
* A@MYUH-19 bad reported ZLER's etateoent thet he con-
‘sidered KOLE a poor choice for the intelligence job to
AMBIDOT-1 and the latter hed jumped to: the conclusion that
- 21e was AMTM-19 putting words ieto GUSESELER's mouth.

| 10. BECKHOVF commented as follows: aYate-19 will have
eo tell GUEEZRLER or wyself if in a gives instance o
demarche. is indicated. There ere certain things which,

* wlth AMBIDDY-1 out of the country, simply camot. bs put
em the shelf. We have no choise but to tell GUXMIELER
to tell AMYUM-19 who, however, simuld feel free to. counsel
earnect te we hin as « channel.. Headquarters rep conceded
that AWIDDYeL coeld vightly resent enything which seecks
of a juntor officer (1.0. GUERTELER) giving orders to him
_ le AMYUMe19, an impression wo would do our: best to
eradicate, .

eo



“3%

1k. BECKHOVY stressed that wo were anxious uot to
give AHBIDDY-1 the impression that there exists any.
special relaticoship between us and AKYUH-19, AMJAVA/4.
Our relz’{onship was with AMBIDDY-1] who is the leader
of the movement. AMJAVA/4. replied that he had told. aMBIDOT<L
this and that BECKHOFF had asde this point very clear at
their first meeting in Puerte Rico (sce AGORLD Meeting
meno, 3-6 Septender 1963 Subject: Briefing of AWAVA/4.)
BECKROFF added that. he had told AMYUM-19 and wished to
repeat this in the presence of AMJAVA/4 that anything
discussed while AMBIDDY-1 was not present, could be told
hia. Rothing was “off-the-record" in the sense of to:
be withheld from AMBIDDY-1. : .

12. According t2 AMJAVA/4, AMBIDDY-1 knows. full
well that KUSASK considers him the Chief. If we decided
to conspire against AMBIDDY-1 in league with AMJAVA/4

1, According to ANYUS-19 (DOI 4 May), AMBIDOY-1 once sore 1s
giving serious thought to contracting marriage with Subject.

2. According to ANYUM-19, ANBIDDY-) suffers pangs of conscience
and has presonitions of hell. What ‘he has in mind is a church
wedding vith a11 the trimmings. Since Subject's previous marriage
was not solemnized by the Church, ae ‘conscience appears
unbothsred. iu

3. AMYUM-19 claims that AMBIDOY-1 brushes off allegations about
Subject’s ‘alleged affair with Fulgencio Batista as mere cal
He does not know whether AMBIDDY-1 has ever asked Subject to confira
or deny the rumor.

4. The root of the trouble, as ANYUN-19 sees it, is that ANBIDDY-}
in the person of Subject is encountering a seasoned pro who plays with
consummate skill upon his vanity and who exploits his naivete which
is that of "a 14 year old." AMBIDDY-1, in fashioning personal relation-
ships; "-s unable to make adjustments to the circunstance that, being
&@ person .of some importaice, his personal affections are not always
cultivated on purely unselfish grounds.

<§,. ANYUM-1¢ claius that Subject’s former husband, Roger Hermilic

Rojas Lavernib, is attempting to blackmail AMBIDDY~1 and that some of

AMBIDDY-1's seemingly closest associates may be harboring similar
designs.

6,. BECKHOFF restated the position of KUBARK as one of non-inter-
vention as long as matrimony is kept in abeyance. Conversely, marriago
and any ensuing scandal would force us to re-asseess our position and,
‘im extremes, might force KUBABK to withdraw ite backing of AMWORLD.

J%. ‘AEYUN-19 expressed the view that ANBIDDY-1 would probably

forego marriage if made aware of KUBARK’s position as stated above:

otherwise), would be told just that.

gUBSECT: Cackling Over Unlaic Ices -

2. AMYUM.19 confided > us that AMBIDDY-1 had, prior to
the launching of Operation ZKHON, prepared s “three and cae
half page” news rolease which laid exaggerated claim to
damages inClicted during the raid on Santa del Sur.

Only the last sentence etated, wore or leas as on afterthought,
that this should be considered just a minor MRR operatioa.
AMYUM-19 has told ANBIDDY-1 that in bis opinion any zuture
announcements should be held dow to one or two brief pare-
graphs.

2. Ve pointed out to ANTUM-19 that AMBIDDY-1 vas
evidently psying no more than lip service to our recomea-
@atioa that be under—rather than over--play his successes.

- Paring the Washington meeting (19-21 March 1964) we. had.
eriticized a statenent made by AMBIDDY-1 during 3 Miami press
eeuference to wit: "We do not bave enough boats. In one
aight ve can make tvo trips but not nore, but we are doing
4. ‘ge will £111 the country with enough arms to free the

yas from communisa." We took the position that if we were
is =1's shoes: we simply wouldo't let on about military:
pattess since this plgys into Castro's hands, giving hia.
gratuitous access te military anteiligesce.. AMBIDDY-1
Geatered by asking us hov-he could raise the moralo of the
people vithout saying anything end without talking about
q@uccessful ops 11

"| Ge, We mentioned to AMBIDDT-1 that any vital inforsa-
a tion act publicized makes the task of Castro's espiosase
garvicd that more difficult. Besides, things had now come
com pass Vhere little credence was placed in claina of

inflate the significance of his iuitial successes and to presest
then ia their proper perspective. He apould refer to tuseo
successes as were appetizers, with the main dish to follow
Yater. This approach rather then the clain of a big victory
would arvase the kind of interest, ‘and in Castru's case, the
kind of premonitioa chich ‘carries psychological impact.

4. Ve doubt whether AMBIDDT-] at this stage is presared

In the unhealthy climate of competition, ongeadered by the

“4, ‘The following was relayed to AMBIDDY-1: "We are —
glad you have second thoughts about Playa Giron. We have
. Feceived more information about military, eepecially maritime,

build-up in that sector which would make any landing attempt
virtually suicidal.” AMBIDDY-1 stated he would confer with ;
‘AMJAVA=-4 and AMYUM-19-and give us his final. decision as..to {
_ whether or not this operation would be run.‘ AMBIDDY-1 commented 5
‘that one life meant more to him than the entire operation. How

on Playa Giron on the 17th of April would have on the morale :
of the Cuban people. The undersigned replied that. there are
two sides to the coin; should their operation fail, this would
‘play into the hands of Castro, and it was: the opinion of ‘this
office that the alternate plan would also do:much to raise the

of the Cuban people.

source. A Cuban exile observer who was present during the speech.

Headquarters Comment. The following is a résumé of the political
philosophy of Wanuel Artime Buesa, leader of the Movimiento de
Recuperacion Revolucionaria (MRR, Movement for Revolutionary
Recovory) as prepared by Source. It is based on statements

made by Artime in his speech on 18 March 1964 to the Associacién
para Recuperacién Econémica de Cuba (AREC, Association for
Economic Recovery of Cuba), on his first publication entitled

Comunismo por qué? (Communism zor what?), which was written
nine months

@iore Castro came to power, and on Artime's book
Traicién (Betrayal).

Artime does rot believe in political extremes —~ neither the
left nor the right. He believes that extremes always end by
touching one another, If any extreme gains power in Cuba,

and in the case of the extreme right by imposing a dictatorship,
he will continue to fight with weapons in hand. Artime does
not believe in the classification of men by race, by political
ranks in former governments, or by money. He confesses ‘to. being
an opportunist in the sense that he is taking maximum advantage
of each opportunity, but not in the sense of chenging his
beliefs in acnord with opportunities,

The main theme of Comunismo por qué? was that more than a change
in government a chrnge in the conscience of men is needed. It

outlined the duties of the padrén (landowner) toward +he workers
go that the latter may live in dignity and honor, The padron

should feel that the problems of his workers are also his problems.

The worker, in turn, has certain obligations to the padron, If

this gene pro quo ig not adhered to, a (Christian) government
has the rig a intervene for the common good. In his letter
of resignation ts Fidel Castre 2:

because Castro had not been honest with the businessmen by
not telling them their property would be contfisca:ad.

3. The following excerpts from Artime’s book Traicion clearly . | \

None; for your information and files, |

1. INTRODUCTION: In the period 6 to 18 January 1964,
AMBIDDY-l" was given 83 hours of tutorial training, in JMWAVE safe-
house facilities, on existing operational doctrine and management
techniques applicable to a major clandestine effort against. PBRUMEN.
A copy of the training schedule which was used in this tutorial
training is attached. At the completion of the training course,
the various training instructors submitted an evaluation on
;-AMBIDDY-1. These evaluations are outlined in the following
paragraph. z

2. EVALUATIONS: The below-listed evaluations were prepared
by the instructors who participated primarily in Phase I of
-AMBIDDY-1's tutorial training, The Phase I instruction concentrated
on: imparting- to AMBIDDY-1 current operational doctrine relative to
unconventional warfare techniques. ‘The evaluations are as follows:

responded most. é: cally to all aspects the training on
gmall.unit techniques. He made detailed notes on the material
.coversd, and these notes included copies of training charts and
diagrams, AUBIDDY-1 displayed particularly intensive interest in
that portion of the training dealing-with the principles of
“gurvival and the issuance of individual equipment. In. the course

of the training, AMBIDDY-1 was given several practical tactical
problems to solve. AMBIDDY-1's solutions to these problems were
logical and reflected.a grasp of the techniques to which he had

been exposed during the training sessions. Thomas L. DARGUZIS was
the primary instructor in this phase of the training, and he assessed
AMBIDDY-1 as being an intelligent, alert, highly-motivated
individual who has a realistic appraisal of his own limitations |

and capabilities. a

training in #% Tradeoraft aubjects, including the nature and

organization of a basic net, communications and reporting techniques.
In the course of this training, AMBIDDY-1 expressed a particular
interest in the subjects of security, cover and compartmentation,
Charles F. MASENGILL was the pricary instructor for this bloc of
traning, and he reports that AXEIDDY-1 was a keen student who
appreciated the opportunity to learn as much as possible about
clandestine operations. MASENGILL believes that AMBIDDY-1 at the
completion of his training was probably weakest on the topic of

how to report intelligence information.

ec. Re: ce Activity and Guerrilla Warfa:
received training principles ‘concep:
organizing an infiltration team. In addition,
relative to the principles of organizing a resistance net.
Additionally, he was trained in caching, demolition and sabotage
techniques. AMBIDDY-1 also received instruction in the principles
and concepts of guerrilla warfare. AMBIDDY-1 was also given an -
opportunity to familiarize himself, through actual range firing,
with those weapons which are normally used by anti-AMTHUG-1 forces.
Alton T, PIRNACK was the principal instructor for this bloc of
training. PIRNACK reports tht AMBIDDY-1 was responsive to the
subject material which was presented to him. AMBIDDY-1 did not
hesitate to ask questions nor to seek clarification of points which
he did not clearly understand. AMBIDDY-1 did indicate that he was
& neophyte in the subject of PM operations, and, as a result, he
was mst appreciative of the training which he was receiving on
, these subjects. It was evident during this bloc of training that

EE “gaching = an entirely new facet of clandestine operations for

AMBIDDT-1

3. . COMMENT: _ Phase II of AMBIDDY-l's training concentrated
‘on exposing AMBIDDY-1 to those management techniques and principles
which are applicable to a aajor clandestine operation against a
target like PBRUMEN, This part of the training was carried out
exclusively by Andrew K, REUTEMAN and Stanley R. ZAMKA, In this
° phase of the training, AMBIDDY-1 constantly expressed a great deal
of enthusiasm for the subject material which was being presented.
t the training, AMBIDDY-1 gave every indication that he
wis absorbing the majc* portion of the training. At the sane
time,=.t was clear that he was. overwhelmed by the material and the
_ implications of what this training meant in terms of:his conduct in
\. @uture operations, After the management phase of AMBIDDY-1's
training was completed, REUTEMAN and ZAMKA reviewed the 83 hours
training program in its totality with AMBIDDY-l. In addition, the
program was reviewed with all of the instructors who participated
din the’training. As a result of this review, a consensus was -
freached that; while AMBIDDY-1 is an intelligent anc responsive
student, the training which he received does not qualify him for
the position of senior officer in a major clazdestine undertaking
against PBRUMEN, ‘The training did, however, alert. AMBIDDY-1 to a
number of problems and pitfalls whioh “he should avoid in his
activities.:: This training also provided certain guide posts for
AMBIDDY-1, but these guide pests were laid out in such a concentrated
dose that they cannot be considered a: adequate substitute
for experience or training in depth over an extended. period of
time. 7

AMBIDDY-1 goes on to mention his various publications. He

describes his first publication, “Communism por que?" (Communism -
what for?) which he wrote nine months prior to Castro coming to

power, The main theme of this pamphlet, according to A-1l, was

that more than changing a gov.rnment what is needed is-a change in
men's conscience. The pamphlet also outlined the duties of the : oe
padron (land owner) to the workers so that the latter may liveo

4m dignity and tm honor, ‘The ratron should feel that the problema :
of his workers are also his problems. The worker. in Xturn has
“eertain obligations to the patron. If this quid pro quo is not

of publicity but we cannot subordinate the war to publicity, we are
subordinating the interests of publicity to the war. In a free
