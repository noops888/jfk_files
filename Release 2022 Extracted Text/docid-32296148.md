on either side, and it has no street. or alley behind 1t. Customarily,
the back yard Ja clearly illuminated at night by several permanent
spot lights, GABRIEL MANNARINO, his wife, JEAN, and their tuo
teenage daughters. occupy the house.

: N

As the Bureau has been notified previously, GABRIEL MANNARINO's
cottage on Old Leechburg Read, in Allegheny Township, Westmoreland
County, Pa., 4s a one-story, frame building, which gits back
about 300 feet from the read on a 10 acre tract which slopes
from front to vear. It has a amall lake in front of it, and

ait ig surrounded by wooded area. It has 3 bedrooms, a

kitche, @ living-dining room, an@ 4 screened porch. Po the
right. rear\and about 20 feet from the house is a wire pen, which
holds three German Sheperd dogs. PCT HERBERT L. RAY, who

lives nearby, says there are no private telephone lines in

the area, and it is known that the cottage has no telephone.

From past experience, it 1s inown that GABRIEL MANNARINO almost
never hes visiters at his home, especially those having

any connections with racket activities, polities, or Jaw
enforcement. SAMUEL MANNARINO occasionally has visitors of

the above types, but the visite are so infrequent and unpredictable,
that is does not seem feasible toconsider establishing a highly
confidential source.

With regard to the MANNARINO offices at 1263 Third Avenue,

New Kensington, Pa., it is noted that this is a one story,

red brick building. It ts located completely inside a ton foot
metal fence which surrounds the serap metal yard, and it sets
back from the gate, which is locked at night, about 50 feet.

The area between the gate, the scrap piles and the office
building is brightly illuminated by a group of spotlights.
Recently, it has been determined that this office is protected
by the Silent Service System, an electronic burglar alarm systen
which is monitored directiy by the New Kensington Pp.

It would seem that the most likely spot to attempt to establish
a bighly confidential source would be at the MANNARINO cottage,
but efforts will have te be made te resolve some of the
problems, such ae monitoring (the cottage is about 35 miles
from the Pittsburgh Office); ingress (the dogs and a caretaker
whose schedule is irregular) and security (location and coverage
ef all possible visitors, and possibility that there is a
burglar-alarm installed).
