1. Headquartere regrets that it has been unable to learn the date and place
of birth of the Luis TEDISCHI who, according tu a ally reliable source, was being
considered ror recruitment in 1943 by the RIS, or was actually working for the FIS.
4s stated in Hislv=6515, our ‘source resorted that the address used by TEDiSCH1 during
the early part of 1943 was Pichincha 969, “uenos Aires.

2, Collateral inforsation cn Luis T!D<SCH of Pichincha 969, Suenos Aires,
haa been found in e 1912 document which avcears to have been based on censorship
reports. This document indicates that T: U's address, as given above, was a
cover address for a Union Derweratica ispanola) nanifeste sent from Cuba,
Also one TEUESCHI, Estados Unido 4366, Buenos Aires, was given as a cover address
ina secret writing meseage. A copy of the pertinent portions of this document
is attached.

3. Itis hoped that a unilatere) surveillance on the Iuis TEDEDCH Living at
Bl Domador 3150, Suenos Aires, if instituted as the station planned, will be

fruitful, Headquarters will be extremely interested in any further infornation on
this individusl you may be able to develop, as it is possible that he may be linked
with Communist and/or KIS activitios in Cuba as well as being weed locally by the RIS.

hh. As KUDESK 4a currently handling this case, it is requested that the slug
PEDHIOD not be used.

of small yerare=:wners, Koither he n.r any of :is fanily nave celonged to any
political party 2r syndicate although bie sympat:ies have aways veen on the left.

SPANISH ATTITUDE 10 TRE REGTME AND THE WAR. — He says that the imense

. ajority cf the Spanish peocle is against Franco end the Falange, workers, peasants,
i esployees, bourgeois, big and small end a large provortinn of the soldiers
end the Ryquetes. He cays that everyone hopes for the victory of the Allies.
Init there is a blind trust, especially when the U.S, entered the war as the
U.S. and England are the nost powerful countries in the world,especially with
‘the assistance of Russia. Only the Palanciste desire and plan for the victory
of Hitler, even though "there are many Felanzists too who taxe a vory black wew
of:Fin", Ba says the majority-of-people sympathise with England. They have | :
complete faith in the Bictory of the Democracies. There are sup orters of the |
USSR, but the inmense aajority, according to our informant, do not like Sconcuniea®
and prefer Democracy. iz obviously rather muddled by the Falangist pro. agmnda
against the U.S.3.R. Be says that the etrame of the U.3.S.R. into the war gave
Fise to harpiness all over the world, alth-ugh there had. been a creat deal of
confusion before, through the "Treaty of Aid between Russia ani dgrmany. But this -
confusion disappeared with German agsresaion against, the U.S.5.R. He says that
‘the German defeats on the Bussian front raised rorale. end: renewed’ everyone's:
e@onfidence in victory. Ritler's admission in his speech of how such-they het. -
suffered in Russia in winter, ami. that they were cn the edge of catastronhes.. |
produced great Joy snony the people. i says tiat the entry of the-U,8 inte

there ‘s serious danger of war for Spain. He says trat the Anglo-Soviet and the

them. They nade a very good ixpression on the pecple. Asked if he knew that
the ssid’ pact stivulated tat after the victory nations would have freedon to

published it. Ato-t tne Second Front .e says tiat everyone trinke of it, and

TH CHURCH. —- He says that it is not true that in the Church there are anti=
German and Anti-Falanzist croups. The supporteres’of the Re-ime are the Falange,
the Germans and‘t:e Clergy, in that order, The Church wishes for the triumph

of G,rmany, in spit.
that case they will be able to preserve their pcaition of influence. He says

that English and Russian news canbe heard althugh itis very difficult and is
forbidden although there is no watch or inspection. He says that everybody is
against the Falange ani submissione to Germany, includin; the nonarchists and the

Falangist loaders, The manoeuvre turned out very badly. Tits Division is the 7
most unpopular innovation of the Palenge. Our informant talked with 11 sur— : H

their wounds, One of thom was 18 whén be left as a volunteer, without the
congent of his family, He asked if he would return to the front again and he :
answered categorically *Wy oyos have been opened. I will rever return®, i"
They all speek of the bad food they are given - mainly vitamin pilis and pots
of jam. They speak of the courage and fighting spirit cf the Russian aray, but
above all of the contexpt with which the Ogrmans treated thea. They regarded
them as inforior beings and they aleo said that when they - aid compliments to
the Gergen women, a Spanish custom, they answered tiem disdainfully as if they :
despised them, There were cases of self-cutilation in the rms of tie Blue
Division. At any rate their panic was obvious, and they refused to return.

beatings in Madrid. He also sav how the people had lost their fear, In

the Gran Wia in Madrid a man cried out that he was not only red but communist,

and he wuld not endure this any nore. Apparently the people told him to be

silent put he did not take any notice. The R.A.F. bombardment of Cologne,

which was known in Spain fro: the English bpesdcaste, was colebrated almost all

over Spain by the people who stayed up much later than the usual time in the

better than mybody what the war in Russia had already cost the Germans. .
During the winter they had lost millions of men and a great deal of

it ie imposaible to get more détails. However they tell their friends in

out of those who were going to Russia, and saw thea off at the Station, now

only ones with which he was con-ected. For this reason tis report ia rather
incomplete, and in soce cases lacks objectivity. He is rather reserved,

ATTITUDE OF THB SPANIARDS TOWARDS THE ANTI-ITLSR WAR, — In the graphic
words of the informant, 90% of Spaniards are partigans of Ingland. . The
workers, peasants, petit—bourgeois, capitalists, and some of the clergy,
(later ha told us the majority of the Basque cures) are cn the sided England,
although in a passive way, and against Germany and the Falange.

The general opinion which is expressed in ccnvarsations between groups of
friends, ind lately also in the street, is that the defeat of Germany is ine
evitable, due, according to our informant, to the fact that the’Allies have
more econccic resources snd more priniry materials. It is thought that the
United States will be a very important factor in theredisation of victory,

Also the defeats cuffered by Germany on the Rastern front contribate to
stresaing this opinion.

In Spain everyone 1s tired of the war, and no one wiebes Spain to take part
in 4t, There people are in a real panic on thie acore. OXr informant thinks
that if Franco should.decide to ficht, in viewd the terrorist nature of the
Regine, the people wuld have to obey. Later in another conversation he said that
there were people who, in that case, would hide in the mountains,

:The defeats suffered by Ggrmany on the Kantern front were well knom
there ant contributed to increase the peoplefs confidence. Hes ays that they
said there that, in apite of their resistance, it was obvious that the Russians
were not sufficiently prepared to fa:e a power like Germany.

The entry of the United States into the war was received with ‘oy by the
people who interpreted it as an event destined to shorten the war, of which they
are all very tired over there,

into action in fact just before the Russian co-nter-offersive began, -and
received the full crunt. They had cany losees throuch bullets and the cold.
Some of those who came vack crippled have Ogrman iron erossec for which they
get a pension, our informant does not know the am tn},fros the Ggraan Sovernment,

SUPPORT QIV!N SY THS FRAWS(TST REITMB AD TV PALANGZ 7 HITLER, — our
informant does nut know in whatqtantity they send reinforcements to the Biue
Division. He thinks that there is soze exa’,eraticn on this nvint on the prt
of the Falangist Preas wrth tries in this way to encourage enthusiasm arong the
young men. He knows that the place they report to and tra‘h is San Sebastian,
and that from there they leave for thefrcnt. He thinks that they are still
sending people, but they are only ®reliefs® for those who cone h:me. Ha adds
that those wio go to the Division Asul today,with very few exceptions, do it
against their will, They get the majerity of those who go from the barracks,
He says that many workmen went to Germany on account of the lack of food and
work. Be dosent know how sany but he thinks a fair uantity. He says that the
people take these things calaly cenerally, because they cannot do anytthz
againat them. He only heard that in pun there had be2n some ecene with the
Blue Diviebn or with the-workera who wre going to (ermany but he zives noe
actual detsils, saying that it dangerous t» try and know too much,

In Spain the fost fervent supporters of the Nasls are - Suner, Minos Grande,
Mescardo and other generals, and especially the "idealist® Falancists, or those
who cuititted injustices or profiteered ani are afraid of "the tables being
turned®, ‘i

Be says that the Falange is only the shadow of what it was during the
war. That at the begin=ing many people jo.ned it for safety's sake, cut now
it isSdead thing that no one takes my notice of, The same happened with the
“Plechas", “Frente de la Juventud® ec, The syndicates have cany members,
because membership is obligatory in order to get work. The workera would not
join them if they could help it. He says that all the directors are Falandist
bureaucrats who take a.vantage of their position to steal all thay can. He
Cites-es-anexanple the fact that omloyers are obliged to pay sometrinz as
@ contribution to the subsidy allocated to workmen with large families, .ut he
says that the Folangists do not pay it to anybody, but spend it themselves.

For these and other ateilar reasons there is a lot of discontent among the
q@yloyers,

~Our informant saya tiat they are still sending large quantities of food
to Germany, also iron and othgr materials. The people know that if there is
‘fanifie in Spain it is becaus8/the Germans and the "Black Marketeer:

Aaked bbout the production of the metal factories in Bilbao, he says that
they are working at presgure, tut he does not know if it is xar material.

He knows that pig-iron is peing sent to Prance, he imagines it is intended
‘for Germany. Tron ore is also sent to France by sea,

Pucrion AMON THE RULINS CLASSES. — He knows that in the arzy there i urge

‘they belicve that th + come from outaide. According to our infors
rant, there is nc thought of fighting againstdbaregine, Wosays that the
workers in the factory in which he worked spoke openiy against the regige but
he does not imow that there was any activity. (Given the character of the
infcrmant we may sup ose that even if there was he would take pains to icnore

Assistance to the primners, according to our informant is given by relations
‘Thawe is no organised assistance, but he proceeds to tell us that
certainl; thera have been collections sometinas in the factory inf avour of the
but “by groups of friends", He does not know of the sctivity of any

are tae ones wo have some organisation,
+, They distributed there a speech maie by Aguirre in America. (ne of the
Prietots was aleo in cirezlation, He has no news of the other organisations
although he adaite that 1f they have any organisation they would not go and
tell him avout it.

When he is asked about the activity of the different organi sati ons of which
the Frente Popular is composed, and the attitude of the militant party members
of these orgatisations, he asserta categorically that there tne people are
completely united, and there is now no talk of socialists, anarchists, coaiunists,
Topublicans.etc. All treat each other as comrades, snd help each other as £
as thsy can. In Spain, according to our igformant, there are only now enscies
of Franco and the Palanze, tho maintain a strict unity among themselves; they
discuss the progress of the war together,cosent on the situation ete. Bg saya
that the people wish for unity, regret the disunion there was before in Spain.
and the quarrels between different parties and anti-fascist organisations,

Be did ri:t knew of the shooting of Larra or Diegues, The execution of Lara -
iupreseed him very much and he said heen in order to do what Larra had done one
would need plenty of gata.
