1, A meeting wae held on 27 January 1969 with Messrs.

Rocca, Houston, Warner and myself to discuss the ramifications

of the confrontation with the New York FBI office on 17 January.

It was concluded that additiona} information was required on

Security and requested the security files on these two individuals

and was advised that we could not. have the security files but that

Mr. Ward Greene would bring the files to the office and discuss

4. The facts in the attached chronology are subject to
question since they are the result of (Roberts own explanation of
his affiliation with Itkin rather than having been determined from
independent sources, The most critical aspect would appear to
be the knowledge or suspicion that Itkin may have known of

03 Qoberta) affiliation with CIA, Thie knowledge is borne out by
the strange way in which Itkin repeatedly brings (Roberts) name
into-the story which Itkin develops about his CIA affiliations, ~
One of the questions, to be answered by@. GLOBE personnel is
whether or not (Robert) reported his activities with Itkin in Geneva,
Switzerland, in March 1966, There appears to be no record of

what his financial contribution was to the |

5. Mr. Rocca was advised’ by Mr. Sam Papich of the FBI
that the New York District Attorney may be considering prosecution

negligence cases. We do not have sufficient information to evaluate
the likelihood of criminal prosecution. It may be necessary to
discuss this problem with representatives of Mr. Hogan's office.

two operational considerations, one having been a request to use
him with Project DTPILLAR from November 1953 to February
1955, and then a request in 1963 by the Domestic Operations
Division for hie use on Project, WUBRINY. In March 1964 DO
Division advised Security that | |wae not going to be used
on WUBRINY. Mr. Rocca commented that there are some rather ¢
ominous allegations against members of the firm of

indicating that one member of the firm was a card-
carrying member of the Communist Party. At the present time
Mr. Rocca is investigating the DTPILLAR use of Mr.
