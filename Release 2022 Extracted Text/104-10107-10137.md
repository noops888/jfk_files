The tacts in the attached chronology are subject to

question since they are the result of (Roberts) owe explanation of

his affiliation with Itkin rather than having been determined from

independent sources. The moet critical aspect would appear to

discuss this problem with representatives of Mr. Hogan's office.

In March 1964 DO

ominous allegations against members of the firm of

indicating that one member of the firm was a card-

carrying member of the Communist Party. At the present time

Mr. Rocca is investigating the DTPILLAR UBe Of MI.
