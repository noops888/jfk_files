II. John Wilson Hudson File

A review of Hudson's CIA DDO file indicates’ that in'a report

from[ Santiago chite]datea August 8, 1957 or 1951 a source

was of the opinion that "Wilson was very probably an intelligence

agent and that he is under direction of some service."
(Report from[Santiagoschile, )August 8, 1951,or 1957) On
October 6, 1959, a memorandum for the record reported that
Hudson was. arrested with Paul Hugues in Cuba and that
{ Wilson may be summarized as a
person of intelligence, but so
erratic as to be considered
mentally unbalanced at z
time. He is a soldier of. fortune, having 7
begun his career. in July 1936 when he left
Oxford to fight in Spain. He has been
accused of working for the intelligence
services of several countries, and he
himself has claimed to have acted on
behalf of different intelligence services.
He has been consistently anti-Unitéd States.

On 21 August 1959 the U.S. Consulate in
Kingston issued a single entry non-

"Interest of Carl J,.,Wilson Hudson in POlitical Intelligence")

a ‘Wilson indicated he had come to England early in the fall on

- business, but was planning to return to Chile. (Ibid.) The
comment made at the end of this report states

This is the second time Wilson has
approached me to.show an interest
in intelligence matters. The first
time was shortly after President
Kennedy was assassinated, when he

| said that he had been imprisoned in
Havana by Castro in 1959. He alleged
that’ while he was in prison, meals
for a fellow-prisoner, a former
gambling czar in Havana with early
associations with the Capone gang, had
been brought to the prison by a man
who identified himself as “Ruby" and who
bore a physical resemblence to the
man being tried for Oswlad's murder.
