CIA files relating to Ruby's Cuban activities

I. Jack Ruby's CIA file

Jack Ruby's CIA file contains a memorandum dated January

7, 1964 to the CIA from Hoover. This memorandum states

that

Carlos Villa furnished the FBI with a letter which had been

forwarded to a friend of his, Jose Antonio Juan. Mr. Juan

allegedly received the letter from his son in Cuba. The

letter states

it is known here that Rubenstein

was here a little less than a year

ago visiting a Mr. Pranski, owner

of shop dealing in Tourist articles

on Prado Street between Animas and

Trocadero opposite the Seville Biltmore.

(Memo, 1/7/64, To CIA from Hoover.) This memorandum also states

that the FBI has developed no information that Ruby visited.

Cuba except for one occasion in 1959. (Ibid.)

A memorandum for James Angleton from John Sherwood,

dated January 9, 1964, contained a translation of another

memorandum which was sent to Carlos Marquez Sterling. (FOIA

(Ibid.)

A CIA cable from Miami, dated January 30, 1964, (WAVE 1283)

II. John Wilson Hudson File

A review of Hudson's CIA DDO file indicates that in a report

from/Santiago, Chile]dated August 8, 1957 or 1951 a source

was of the opinion that "Wilson was very probably an intelligence

agent and that he is under direction of some service."

(Report from[Santiago, Chile,)August 8, 1951, or 1957) on

October 6, 1959, a memorandum for the record reported that

Hudson was arrested with Paul Hugues in Cuba and that

Wilson may be summarized as a

person of intelligence, but so

erratic as to be considered

mentally unbalanced at

time. He is a soldier of fortune, having

begun his career in July 1936 when he left

Oxford to fight in Spain. He has been

accused of working for the intelligence

services of several countries, and he

himself has claimed to have acted on

behalf of different intelligence services.

He has been consistently anti-United States.

(Memo for the record 6 Oct. 1959, subj: "Carl John Wilson

Hudson. )

A 201 file request was submitted from|Chile on October

29, 1959. (201 File Request, from|WH/I/Chile, 10/29/59)

Handwritten at the bottem of this request is the statement

"In contact with suspected Soviet Agents." (Ibid.)

The nest file reference is in a cable dated December

19, 1959 from Havana to the Director of the CIA which states

that in Ref B (HAVA 2296) Havana station reported that

[RAMCHITTER] (unidentified) is in contact with John Carl

Wilson. (Cable, 19 Dec 1959, To Dir from Havana, HAVA 3072)

AFter the assassination,

a classified message dated

November 28, 1963, to the White House, the State Department,

and the FBI from the CIA reported the Hudson allegation

regarding Ruby and stated, "His story is

being followed up."

(Classified Message, FOIA DOC.

# 206-83, 11/28/63, CIA

no. 85657) On November 29, 1963, the London Station reported

Altho station tracing John Wilson aka

Wilson Hudson with(JACUAR,) believe on

first returns, from FBI check he likely

be psychopath. Station gathers he gave

this impression when testifying before

Eastland Committee in 59. We are therefore

not pursuing further except thru JAGUAR for

any info they have on him.

(Cable to Dir from London,]29 November 1963, FOIA DOC. # 233-94,

[ LOND]6115).

On December 12, 1963 the Deputy Director of Plans sent

a memorandum to the FBI detailing Hudson's background. (Memo

to Director of FBI from DDP, 12 December 1963, FOIA DOC. 385-736) .

This memorandumreported the arrest of Hudson in Cuba. It also

stated that

On August 195y. WIlson walked

into the U.S. Consulate, Kingston,

Jamaica, and said he was a journalist

who had just been released after 54

days detention in Habana prison.

On 21 August 1959 the U.S. Consulate in

Kingston issued a single entry non-

immigrant visa. He was carrying passport

147356 issued in Habana 14 August in the name

of John Wilson. He was attempting to get

air passage to Miami in order to sell his

his story to the Miami Herald

and then to obtain a new visa from

Chilean consulate to return home.

(UK or Chile not specified but

apparently he returned to UK).

(Ibid. at : 8).

The last entry in the file was a memorandum of a conversation

between Wilson and the First Secretary of the American Embassy

in London, dated April 7, 1964. (Memo of Conversation between

Wilson and Richard A. Ericson, Jr., 4/7/64, London, Subj:

"Interest of Carl j. Wilson 'Hudson in POlitical Intelligence.")

Wilson indicated he had come to England early in the fall on

business, but was planning to return to Chile. (Ibid.) The

comment made at the end of this report states

This is the second time Wilson has

approached me to show an interest

in intelligence matters. The first

time was shortly after President

Kennedy was assassinated, when he

said that he had been imprisoned in

Havana by Castro in 1959. He alleged

that while he was in prison, meals

for a fellow-prisoner, a former

gambling czar in Havana with early

associations with the Capone gang, had

been brought to the prison by a

who identified himself as "Ruby" and who

bore a physical resemblence to the

man being tried for Oswlad's murder.

(Ibia.)

The Commitee has been provided with no evidence

to indicate any further"investigation was conducted by

the CIA with regard to Wilson Hudson.
