Spanish Names

Much of the confusion concerning Spanish names can be eliminated if

one basic fect is clearly understood: Spanish speaking people use their
mother's maiden name (matronymic) after their last name (patronymic).
For example, Fidel Castro's full name is Fidel Castro Ruz--Ruz being
the matronymic (and in this case seldom used). In this dossier the last
name is the one capitalized end will appear as

CURREN? POLITICAL RELIEFS:

Untt1 1961-62 Subject showed a pronounced anti-US and. pro-
Communist, pro-Castro bias. More recently, however, there har been
information indicating that he does not bold to his former views and
is thinking of leaving Cuba, The progression of bis political
thinking 1s visible in the following extracts. ~

1959: A US resident of Cuba whose source was a Cuban youth

leader reported that the swing to the left of the University Students

Federation (Pederacidh Estudiantil Universitaria ~ FEU) vas confirned
by the decision made at the end of November 1959 to become a full
menber of the Conmunist-run International Union of Students (IUS).
(Hovever, the FEU ulso retained‘its association with the Coordinating
Secretariat, of the National Union of Students - COSEC,)

Editorial Note: Since this sving to the left of the FEU happened
only"s month or so after Subject became president of that organization
it does not, seem likely that he could have so quickly influenced the
Predominantly Catholic university. On the other hand, one of the FEU
Vice presidents, Jos& VENEGAS Valdespino, tas by November heading

the latin Anerican Department of the FEU, an indication that the FEU
vas organizing its area departments along the exact lines of the area
departments in the Cuban Ministry of State (Foreign Ministry?).

1959-60: Subject and other FEU leaders entertained a group of
Red Chinese students in Ravana,

March 1960: An anti-Communist student-leader said that Subject
was neither pro- nor anti-Communist. The source felt that Subject's
only desire was to prevent discord during kis term of, office as FEU
president.

March 1960: In late March a Mixed Commission at the University ”
of Havana met to discuss’ the establishment of Disciplinary Tribunals.
The president of the commission, Rafael SANICS Jimenez, and others
Objected, saying the old disciplinary councils had been suspended
becduse more modern and efficient legislation was being studied by
the commission and it was only logical to wait until this legislation
wae Promulgated before establishing new tribunals. Ali the arguments
had no effect on Subject and Angel QUEVEDO Valdivia. Subject said he
had never seen so many Catholics and anti-Coummists present on campus
“attempting to deny the existence of fréedoa of speech and written
expression." He added that, "everyone knows that no one is more opposed

Santos changed his vote, and the tribunals were immediately established.

May 1960: Subject told a general assenbly of un{versity studznts
H that Communist Professot Carlos Rafael RODRIGUEZ Rodriguez vas doing

| his duty and must be given the same respect as other professors. He

i closed the meeting by scoring the counterrevolutionary attitude of
some students and said that the university could not be for “those

| traitors who prefer foreign intervention in Cuba."

May 1960: Subject and bis followers in the FEU leadership held
the floor at the macabre “burial” of the newspaper Diario
| and not only turned it into a vicious anti-American dispi t also
condemned the anti-Communist students at the university as enemies of
the revolution.

:
i May 1: The paper Informacion published a letter from Joaquin
PEREZ Rodrfguez, vice secretary of the School of Agronomy at the
University of Havana, in vhich he stated that so-called "terroristic He
activities" of anti-Communist students were nothing more than a pre- i

H could remain impassive when the Communist. youth from tie Instituto de

1 acts of violence against him (Pérez). He also asked vhat moral
i
'

authority Subject and Quevedo might hope to invoke when they went
across campus carrying arms in direct violation of university
regulations.

i Jane 1960: Subject was in Uruguay as a guest of the pro-
: Coumunist-Federation of Uruguayan Students. We held talks with i
! Communists and gave press conference statements which included such Hq
Coumunist-line items as “Fatherland or Death," "Death to Tra‘tors," :
“Anti-Castro students serve bastard interests," War criminals are :
being trained at the Yankee base of Guantanamo," etc.

| October 1960: After a short trip to New York City with the Cuban
delegation to the United States a responsible US consular official

if said that his presence in the United States was prejudicial ts the f t
national interest and recommended that his valid visa be revoked. |

October 1960: A State Department despatch noted that Subject's
action regarding the Enbassy evacuation notice, his violent :
denunciation of that notice, and his denunciation of the Embassy i
itself in the local press clearly pointed out his anti-US bias.

REGINE'S ATTITUDE TOWARD SUBJECT:

1959: Subject was recognized as a leader of the Revolutionary
Directorate (Directorio Revoluctonario - DR) group that fought in the
Sterra del Escambray. SS

March 1959: On 25 March the Gaceta Oficial announced that
Subject had been promoted from comundante in the rebel army to
comandante in the revolutionary army and that he had been appointed
to the post of Cuban military attaché to Spain by Fidel CASTRO, He
left on or about 27 March to take up this position, It was reported
that there had been some friction between the members of the DK and
members of the 26th of July Movement, Members of’ the DR felt ‘that
Fidel Custro and the 26th of July were not giving the DR enough
recogni'to: for their work in the combat against Batista, There was
also \hought that this appointment of Subject to Spain was the
beginnin, ci an attempt on the part of the Castros to separate the DR
leader, Subject had been second in command of the DR.

June 1959: An ex-DR leader was reported holding a position in
the Cuban Government. On Subject's return from Spain he had been
appointed to a position of Under Secretary in the Ministry of the
Interior.

September 1959: Armando HART Davalos proposed to Fidel Castro
that the Ministry of Education appoint a commissioner to supervise
university activities. Castro said no on the grounds that it would
be offensive to the students, that it would show direct government
intervention, and that the university had historically been autonomous.

As long as this continued the revolutionary authorities could not carry

out a university reform program, A practical approach was found when
the DR nominated Subject as a candidate for the presidency cf the
University Student Federation (Federacién Estudiantil Universitaria -
FEU). Castro and other revolutionary leaders saw Subject as a
candidate who could be influenced and won over to the 26th of July
Movement. Castro showed no open indication that he supported either
Subject of the 26th of July's candidate, Pedro Luis BOITEL; however,
it. was said that he had made a private deal with Subject to win con-
trol over the student body. US officials commented that this deal
seemed unlikely since Subject had previously told intimates he

would kill Castro if he, Subject, 1id not get out of Cuba soon. He
Said that he was disgusted with the regime. Another source gave the
Same account but said that it was Raul Castro rather than Fidel who
spproached Subject. Subject resigned from his post as Under Secretary
in the Interior Ministry to becoue a candidate for FEU president ana
was elected on 17 October 1959.

REGIME'S ATTTTUNR TONED suBIRCT;

December 1959: Subject and Ratl CASTRO vere reportedly
surprised in the latter's home in the Camp Colombia headquarters
taking obvious homosexual advances toward one another, Subject later
fell into disgrace with regime, It is not known whether this was due
to his unsatisfactory performance as 4 student leader or whether he
hai a falling cut with Raf Castro. It was supposedly common Z
knowledge that Subject had obtained the FEU presidency through Rad
Castro to whom he had sold out morally and politically, It was also
seid that he was picked for the FEU post because Fidel thought he
could be controlled. -

May 1960: As president of the FEU, Subject received the task i
(from the government) cf inciting and bruiting about the fact ‘that i
the powers-that-be disapproved of Aureliano SANCHEZ Arango. The {
latter and 4 thousand-odd well-wishers who had gathered at the air- . :
Port to greet him on his return from Caracas were set upon by a small
but well-organized pro-Comunist phalanx, The government also used
Subject and Angel QUEVEDO Valdivia, then secretary general of the FEU,
ty attuck (Manuel) Antonio de VARONA y Loredo, Aurelinno Sénchez
Arango and (Rafael) Mario LLERENA Rodciguez for their participation
in the Second Congress for Liberty and Democracy which was held’ in
Caracas in early May. | Subject and Quevedo issued a statement to the
effect that Varona, Sanchez and Lierena did not represent any element |
in Cuba. This was a.significant comment because (although it had been
known that the three had tacitly opposed the revolutionary government 's |
extremist trend) this was the firct strong stand the three leaders
made against the regine,

May 1960: Subject denounced the (US?) Enbassy “aviso"
(unidentified) as irrefutable proof of US plans to coumi! aggression
egainst Cuba. All government-aligned elements in the following days
Pointedly expressed their support for the FEU and the "thousand-tines
glorious” Comandante Cubela (Subject), its president.

August 1960: Contacts among student circles in Havana stated :
that Subject was likely to be removed from the presidency of the FEU H
because he had shown reluctance to adhere to Communist orders, It was

thought that he might be charged (presumably as an excuse to discharge

him) with using 1,000 pesos given to the FEY for the election of Mise

Universe, for personal entertainment of friends in Varaderc, Cuba.

OTHER PROFESSIOWAL BACKGROUND:

Subject 's professional background and military background are

somewhat difficult to clearly separate. Most of his activities
during the late 1950's and early 1960's were involved with the

University Students Federation (FederaciSa Estudian’

til Universitaria ~

FEU) end the Revolutionary Directorate (Directorio Kevolucionario -

DR).

1959; Subject was second in commnd of DR forces in the Escambray

Mountains,

In June 1959 an ex-DR leader was reported to be holding a
positicn én the Government of Cuba. It had been reported that
on Subject's return from Spain, vhere he was military attaché
briefly, he was appointed Under Secretary in the Ministry of the
Interlor,

In September Subject resigned us Under Secretary to become a
candidate for president of the FEU (see Unit 5, Regime's
Attitude towmrd Subject), He was elected on 17 October 1959.
A reliable source stated that his resignation from the Under
Secretary's post was due in part to the fact that the DR was
unbappy over his acceptance of the position. The public
reason given for his resignation--that he desired to run for
the presidency of the FEU--afforied a good excuse.

Shortly after his election Subject was one of the principal
speakers at a mass demonstration held to protest the incursion
of foreigh-based aircraft over Cuba, Subject said that the
university students would be organized into student brigades
and would receive military instruction, The brigades would he
called “Brigadas Fstudiantiles Universitarias José Antonio
Echeverr: Subject immediately implemented the establishuent
of these brigades,

In December a US resident of Cuba vho received his informtion
from a Cuban youth leader reported that the swing of the FEU tc
the left was confirmed by its decision at the end of Novemver
to become a full member of the Commumist-run International
Union of Students (IUS), although it also retained its
association with the Coordinating Secretariat of the National
Union of Students (COSEC), the free vorld's international
student organization.

PROFESSIONAL BACKGROUND: (Cont 'd)

In March Subject was successful in implementing the establich-
ment of new Disciplinary Tribunals to replace the old disciplin-
ary councils (see Unit 2, Current Political Beliefs). In April i
Subject was given a vote of confidence by the executive body of :
the FEU and was authorized to appoint students to serve on the
new tribunals, The FEU leadership in the 13 university a
faculties continued to voice its support for Subject ana the :
revolutionary government of CASTRO,

In July, according to a US State Department despatch, frecdom

of academic expression was erded at the University of Havana

when Subject's radical students and allied professors “took :
over" the university. The FEU directorate told the University i
Council it no longer had any authority on the campus and must
step aside to make way for a new "Superior Governing Board.”
The council refused. On 14 July fighting broke out at the

Law School between moderates and pistol-packing representatives
of the FEU. Havirg Castro's regime behind them, the FEU group
quickly "restored order" and took over the law school, locking
classrooms and ousting professors, Subject, three other
students, and four leftist professors (Hector GARCINI Guerra, :
Enrique JIMENEZ Lopez, Enriqué HECHAVARRIA Vaillant and : i
Abelardo MORENO Bonilla) formed the Superior Council of the 7
University Government, On 15 July university autonomy ended

and the University of Havana became another instrument of the f ‘
Castro regime,

On 16 December the government-controlled El Mundo announced f teers
that Subject had been named president of the newly established ! 7
Revolutionary Vigilante Comnttee in the University of Havana. ;
The US State Department called him Fidel Castro's "Sharpshooter :

in the University of Havana." |

Subject told an intimate friend prior to his departure for a

tour of various European, Eastern and Soviet Bloc countries {|
that he knew his usefulness to the regime was over and that if i
he remained in Cuba he would soon be liquidated. He said i H
he had had serious arguments with Fidel Castro and Ernesto "Che"
GUEVARA de Ja Serna over his successor as president of the FEU, |
He wanted to name his own successor and not accept their choice :
of Communist Ricardo ALARCON, then secretary general of the FEU.

MARITAL STATUS AND CHILDREN:

Subject married Mirtha Novoa Delgado around August 1959 and was
separated or divorced from her about three menths later, He reportedly
felt obligated to warry her, presumably because she became pregnant 1
prior to the warriage, They have one child, believed to be a girl, who ff
was born in 1959 or 1960, The reason for their divorce is not known,
although there were persistent rumors among Subject's friends that his A
wife had caught him in homosexual activities with another man, Some 7 i
said it was Ernesto "Che" GUEVARA de la Serna and others said it was :
Rai CASTRO Ruz (probably the latter, if the story is true). :

Subject reportedly likes and admires his wife and is concerned
for’ her welfare and happiness, although he does not love her in the
i husband-wife sense, according to a statement from Carlos TEPEDINO
| Gon2éiez (now in the United States in exile), a longtime friend of
| Subject. During summer 1962 Subject met with Tepedino in Europe and
there stated that he could not go back to his wife even 1f he wanted
tc because she had been too outspoken in her dislike for the Castro
eee regim:, He also mentioned her desire to get out of Cuba, This
coment was based on the supposition that Subject might be working
against the Castro regime in Cuba upon his return to that country,
Tevedino expressed the belief that Subject did want to return to his
: wire. There has also been the comment that some of Subject's ; F
i guilt" feelings come from the necessity of resolving the problem :
: of this separation.

i Editcrial Note: Since he still likes and admires his wife, Subject
| tay be more cautious in any anti-regime action while she, their child, :
and his mother remain in Cuba, ; H F

EXTRACMARITAL ACTIVITIES and/or ABERRATIONS;

Subject is either separated or divorced from his wife, He has - :
wany times been reported to be a homosexual, but has also apparently |
had various female friends,

In November 1955 Dr. Armando de CARDENAS y Aranguren, who
cefected to the United States in August 1961, was picked up by i }
Batista‘s Military Intelligence (SIM) agents and interrogated with i
. : regard tu Subject and Juan Pedro CARBO Servia (now deceased), in i
connection with the slaying of a SIM officer, Cérdenas admitted
under pressure that he was a homosexual and that Subject was his
intimite friend,

In 1999 Subject and Rati CASTRO were reportedly surprised in
the lavter‘s home in the Camp Colombia headquarters while making
obvious homosexual advances toward each other, There.were persistent ’
rumors later that his divorce occurred because his wife caught him in
homosexusl activities with another man, either Ernesto "Che" GUEVARA

: de la Serra or Rail Castro, In October 1960 a report stated that

Fhere vere current rumors that he was probably a sexual degenerate,

‘Two months later the statement was made. that it was common knowledge

that Subject had “sola out morally and politically" to Rail Castro. i
He had shared quarters with Castro and there was much talk of hono-

sexual relationships, According to Subject's friend Carlos TEPEDINO,

if Subject does have a bent toward homosexuality, he is not solely

So-inclined. According to Tepedino he presents a good appearance in a i ;
masculine way when dressed up and does quite well with women, A :

Janusry 1962 report noted that Subject was reliably reported by mary i
sources to be a pervert, t i

One of Subject's female friends is Loretta BERMEY, a Pan
Awerican Airlines stewardess of French descent who is based in Milani 7
: (as of 1962), While Subject was in Europe in 1962 he wanted her to a. i
come over there. He appears to have known her for some time, since
his friend Tepedino reported that the stewardess had made some comment
to Subject concerning the latter's political frame of mind in 1961

~ Which made Subject (or Tepedino) think that she was working for the
United States in some way.

SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS:
(Prejudices, disabilities, racial considerations, etc,)

In Septeuber 1959 Subject reportedly told intimates that he was
so disgusted: with the CASTRO regime that if he, Subject, did not get '
out of Cuba soon he would kill Castro himself, !

had made overtures to various Embassies for asylum, In August he said
he knew his usefulness to the regime was over und if he remained in
Cuba he would soon be liquidated, He said he wes too involved with
the actions of the Government of Cuba to tecome a defector but hoped
, to remain in France at the completion of his tour of the Soviet Bloc
and other countries to take postgraduate medical work, In February
1962 it was reported that even though he had been forced to resign as i
H president of the University Students Federation (FEU) in favor of a
Communist he seemed to have retained his position as a student leader
and carried more weight by far than his successor, Ricardo ALARCON,
f He was consulted uot only by student leaders but by university students
f. and government officials,
:

In February 1961 there was an unconfirmed report that Subject 4°

In March 1962 he and other arny coumanders were called in by j
Fidel Castro for support against a Communist takeover of the gover.-
ment, They agreed to back Castro but according to source they were i
really thought to be planning to assassinate Castro and his brother, H
Raul, and Ernesto “Che” GUEVARA de la Serna and take over the H
government themselves, (See Unit 4, Attitude tovard the Regime.) ' ,

Later in 1962 Subject reportedly told his friend Carlos i
TEFEDINO, now an exile in the United States, that he could not ! ,
return to his vife if he wanted to because of her outspokenness : .
against the regime and her desire to leave Cuba, This was based
on the supposition that he might be working against the Castro
regime in Cuba upon his return,

MOTIVATION:

Subject is obviously a contradictory and controversial figure.

He is a romntic idealist, but as a practical politician he is naive,
He appears to require a juychological impetus, preferably in the forn
of a strong and trusted person who can keep him sufficiently =
psychologically uotivated, At present, he appears determined to curry ‘i
out his plans, He taken pride in his reputation for bravery, but is eae
personally sensitive regarding the acts which have built up that $
reputation, e.g., his senuitivity to the use of the word assassin in

numerous references to liim made by Cubans and others.

An evaluation of Subject should be based on his personality,
his reputation es a milcrindo (a brash, spoiled, outspoken person),
aud his aversion to Bow tu the will of higher authorities, including
the CASTROS and Ernesto "che" GUEVARA, Under the surfece, hovever,
he appears to be a sensitive mn showing many indications of honesty,
patriotism, decency, and unselfishness. One minor example is the
incddeut of his engagemnt to his present wife, which vas announced
in 1959. He felt obligatad to marry her, and did so in August of that
year, possibly because she became preguant, Although separated fron
her tor some time, he hay more than once expressed his liking and
aduiration for her, and his concern for ber welfare and happiness. aaa
She is outspokenly anti-rogime ani wants to leave Cuba, Although it i
may seem normal that he murry her under the circumstances, there are } |
many Cubans who vould not have done so. eiiae

While Subject is mercurial in temperament, it has been proven 1 ‘
that anything he undertakes he performs with vigor and dedication, ‘ 1
and ususlly accomplishes his mission, An example of this fact is : H ;
his participation in the assassination in 1956 of Lieutenant Colonel i 1
Antonio BLANCO Rico, of Lutista's Military Intelligence (SIM), He i
defended that act at a press conference in Madrid (where he had been }
sent as Castro's military uttach¢) on 2 April 1959 ty describing +
Batista as a dictator, assussin, and despoiler of the riches of Cuba
who had left the revolutionary government the legacy of a Cuban
national debt of one billion dollars.

‘There is no indication that Subject has demanded anything
material for himself, either from the Castro regime or from the US : i
Government, with the possible exception of technical assistance from }
the latter, Nor dia he demand a high position when Castro took over, H
even though his fighting, leadership and courage in the Escaubray H !
contributed to the revolutionary victory and entitled him to sone

MOTIVATION:

major consideration. Rather, Subject's qualities of modesty, naivete
and honesty and his assets as a soldier were used by Fidel CASTRO and
“Che” GUEVARA as tools to persuade him to run for the presidency of the
FEU in order to win control over the anti-revolutionary, . apolitical
and Ronan Catholic groups predominant, at the University of Havana.
(Subjects own study of medicine at that institution had made him well
aware of the conditions existing there and he keenly felt the need for
revolutionary reforms.)

It is, of course, difficult to reconcile the brutality of some
of SubJect's actions as FEU president, particularly since he
indicated his dissatisfaction with the Castro regime within three
months of its implementation, He treated the entire student and
faculty body as enenies of the revolution, and it seemed apparent that
he was, after all, simply utilized as a Castro tool,

With regard to his political naivete, it appzars that Subject,
like many others, believed what he heard in the inner circles, in
which he vas an important Directorio Revolucionario (DR) leader.

He fought in the Escambray as he had fought for José FICUERES Ferrer,
President of Costa Rica when that country was invaded in 1955. An
idealist, he thought certain individuals vere actually revolutionary
leaders who aimed to help the poor. Subject was disillusioned much
sooner than some, to the extent that, some three months after the
Castros assumed power, he told an intimate friend that he was so
@isgusted with Castro that if he (Subject) did not.get out of the
country soon, he would kill Castro. Castro, however, knowing that

the leaders of the DR were in essence efther Communist or pro-Comnunist,
had already decided to separate ten, and he began by sending Subject
to Madrid as Cuban military attache, The reasons behind Subject's
acceptance of the post ure unclear, unless he simply wished to leave
Cuba in order to avoid killing Castro. In any case, he told a good
friend that he only planned to stay in Spain about a month and then
return to couplete his medical studies in Havana, As the report
indicated, Subject's plan to return was inconsistent with his reported
@issatisfaction with Castro. The newspaper Diario El Nacional reported
that Subject's departure was due to health, rather than political
reasons, (However, it may be that Subject was flattered by the appoint-
ment, a good one for a man of his age.) Subject returned shortly,
nevertheless, and was appointed Deputy Secretary of the Interior,
remaining in that post until he resigned to present his candidacy for
the presidency of the FEU. The election took place on 17 October 1959;

STRENGTHS ;

Subject takes personal pride in his reputation for bravery,
He has a reputation for being a maleriado (brash, spoiled, outspoken)
’ and for not bowing to the will of higher authorities. Under this
crust, however, he is a sensitive man showing miny indications of
honesty, patriotism and decency. .

He may at this time be anti-Communist and anti-Castro but it H
is difficult to draw any conclusion from the conflicting material i
available concerning his views.

WEAKNESSES:

Subject is personally sensitive with regurd to the acts wiich
have built up his reputation. He is particularly sensitive to the
use of the word assassin in numerous references to him ty Cubans and
others,

Subject has often been reported to be a pervert, a sexual
degencrate, 6nd a homosexuzl. Specific instances of alleged homo-
sexual activities are recorded in Unit 13, Extra-Marital Activities
and/or Aberrations,

In 1959 a Guatemalan youth leader who spoke to Subject at some
length after the latter's return from Communist China reportedly caid
that Subject was not too intelligent and vas primarily a.coldier in
attitude and outlook,

In November 1960 an unidentified source called Subject one of
many “suall time" student leaders who made their living by extortion
and blackmail, The principal victins were homosexuals who were
prominent in social, professional and business positicns, This
report called him an individual without principles or scruples, reedy,
aubitious, and one vho would betray the regime without qualms should
it suit his ow interests. Among his victims allegedly were Miguel
Angel QUEVEDO y Lastra, foruer editor cf the weekly magazine Bohenia
{now in exile in Venezula and formerly working for the United States
editing. Bohemia Libre) and one Dr. CARDENAS, chief surgeon of the
university hespital. However, Quevedo is and was openly known to te
a homosexual and Dr, Cardenas appears to be Dr. Armando de Cardenas
Aranguren, a pathologist who admitted homosexual relations with
Subject during an interrogation by Batista's military intelligence
after the killing of Lt. Ccl. Actonic BLANCO Rico. There ic no doutt,
however, that Cardenas stili considered himself a friend to Subject
and as late as 1961 was trying to help get Subject out of Cuba; this
does not seem to be a likely action for someone who had been black-
nailed for years by Subject.

According to one source Subject contemplated suicide in 1961.
He vas said to completely distrust security in any Miami contact
with Cubans and the Cuban comunity,
