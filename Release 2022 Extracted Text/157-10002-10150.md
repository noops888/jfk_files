TESTIMONY OF HOWARD J. OSBORN, ACCOMPANIED
BY JOHN W. DEBELIUS, COUNSEL

Mr. Osborn. My name is Howard J. Osborn,

Mr. Wallach. And Counsel, would you just state your name.

Mr. Debelius. The name is John W. Debelius, 570 North
Frederick Avenue, Gaithersburg, Maryland.

Mr. Wallac h. Once again, Mr. Osborn, as the Senator told
you, and as you have been told before, you do have the full
spectrum of rights available to you here that you have under
the Constitution, and in particular you do have the right’ to
remain silent if you choose to as to any particular question.
And in addition, you have the right to request that a Senator
be present if you desire that one be here.

Mr. Osborn. Yes.

Mr. Wallach. ‘Very briefly, before Mr. Rhea begins his

questions, I would like to ask if Mr. Debelius is here as your

personal counsel today?

Mr. Osborn. That is right.

Mr. Osborn. I take it, then that the CIA in no way secured)
Mr. Debelius' representation for you?

Mr. Osborn. I wish they were paying him, but they are not.
Tam.

Mr. Wallach. I will ask Mr. Rhea to begin his segment of

the examination.

Mr. Osborn. Not to the best of my recollection.

Mr. Rhea. That is all I have. Thank you very much.

(Off the record discussion.)

Mr. Wallach. Mr. Osborn, if you would, just very briefly,
on the subject matter that I am going to be directing your
attention to, the mail programs, the various mail programs that
you may have had knowledge of while you were with the CIA, I
would like to have you very briefly trace your career for us
in briefest terms with the Agency.

Mr. Osborn. All right.

I jointed the Agency on 10 October rod.

I worked in what was then known as the Office of Collection
and Dissemination, which concerned itself largely with the
collection of any information that had any foreign intelligence
import from other Government departments and agencies such as
the Department ‘of Commerce, the Department of Interior, the
Department of the Treasury, and so forth. It was essentially
a liaison job.

I served there about a year and a half, and I then jointed
the Contact Division of the Office of Operations, which was
concerned with the selection of foreign intelligence informatioh
from American businessmen and private organizations who had
business abroad.

I served there until roughly 1950, when I jointed the

Office of Special Operations

This division, as I recall, was the Plans Staff of the
Foreign Intelligence Division of the Clandestine Services which
is known as the Deputy Director of Plans, DDP.

I was promoted from that position to be Chief of the Plans
Staff. I served there until 1955, roughly 1955, when I became
Assistant to the Inspector General of the Agency.

I served there until 19 -- correction. I think I joined
the Inspector General's staff in 1954, and I left there in late

1955 to go abroad in the position of

[

After three years in that position I served brifely for

six months as

I left there in September 1960 to take the position of
Deputy Chief of the Soviet Russian Division in the Clandestine
Services of the Agency in Washington. I served in that
position for about a year and a half, and then became Chief of
the Soviet Russian Division. And I held that position until

Septemb er of 1963, when I accepted the position of Deputy

Director of the Office of Security of the Agency.

Mr. Wallach. Have you heard of any arrangements whereby
the German authorities actually provide the mail?

Mr. Osborn. I can't recall that, honestly. I may have,
but I can't recall it specifically.

Mr. Wallach. In other words, would it be fair to say that
you are not familiar with that operation?

Mr. Osborn. I am not familiar at all with it.

Mr. Wallach. As I stated before, we have some documents
here, and there are a couple that I think are relevant. And I
would like you to review them later, but I want to get your
state of recollection now. I realize that it is based on
memory of events years ago, and things you read in the paper.
And in no way am I questioning the truth of your memory.

Mr. Osborn. I understand.

Mr. Wallach. Could you just give us an overview
of your understanding as to how the -- we will call it the

New York intercept, PROC eeROy HT LINGUAL, whichever name
you want to use, developed in the fifties?

Mr. Osborn. I have no specific knowledge of this. It is
a little unusual, but even considering that this is one of the
things, of course, that we reported to Director Schlesinger,
I don't believe we reported this in any detail as to how it

started, because I am not really sure that any of us knew.

I don't recall exactly how it did start. But it was alsways

which time I was briefed on this particular operation.

Mr. Wallach. Did you know whether or not the Postmaster
General, the then Postmaster General, I am not sure who it
was in 1964, July, whoever it. was in that position, had
knowledge of the fact that mail was opened in New York City?

Mr. Osborn. To the best of my recollection, I never heard
that he was.

Mr. Wallach. Had you ever heard either way about the
Attorney General, be it Robert Kennedy or any of his
predecessors?

Mr. Osborn. Not. to the best of my recollection.

Mr. Wallach. When you visited New York on this inspection
trip that you described being possibly with Mr. White, do you

Mr. Osborn. I can't recall specifically, but I am sure

that he did.

Mr. Osborn. They had changed it.

I said, does Mr. Karamessines approve this?

They said,yes.

I said, does Mr. Helms approve it -- and they
said, we can assume that Mr. Karamessines has got Mr. Helms'
approval.

And I said, I can't assume it. I will have to get it
from him directly.

And I did. I sent one of my fellows, a senior fellow

named Jack Turton. I made arrangements through Mr. ore

the Chief Postal Inspector in San Francisco, and I believe
they set.it up so that representatives of the Far Fast
Division and the Technical Services Division, not the security
people -- I can't recall, but I believe that they were to pose
as Postal Inspectors, with access of certain categories of
mail from Communist China to this country, for the purpose of
photographing exteriors, examining it for possible eviddnce
of censorship,-but I did not know that they were going to open
it, I had novidéa they opened the mail. And I found out
socially and personally from one of the people involved about
a year ago that they opened the mail.

In other words, I am sure they didn't go to Mr. Cotter
every time they wanted something on a day-to-day relationship.

Mr. Wallach. I have just given Mr. Osborn a copy of
a memorandum dated December 24, 1974, which is in fact after
the time he left on sick leave; and‘there is no reason to
believe that he was seen it. I would just like him to re-
view it and possibly refresh his recollection.

Off the record.

(Discussion off the record.)

Mr. WAllach. Back on the record.

oe ae

I think I misspoke when I gave Mr. Osborn a memo. TI
is a three-page undated memo captioned "Project West Pointer."
I believe it was recently prepared.

But in any event I would like to call your attention
to the last paragraph on the third page which states:

"The main difference between G@@iigusWand West Pointer
is that the file shows specific reference to a statement by
the Postal authorities that mail not to go out of Post Office
control. While mail was opened and photographed by Agency
personnel in New York City under RQONWR, and not specific
post office approval was given, neither is there written order
not to do so. In West Pointer the opening of mail was
contrary to specific orders that mail was not to out of post
office control."

Mr. Osborn. There you are.

Mr. Wallach. Is that also your understanding, really?

Mr. Osborn. Yes, very definitely.. This fellow who is
a close friend of mine -- and I don't want to necessarily put
him on the spot, but he is retired: and is in Florida --
came back and spent time with me at my home. And at one
juncture, discussing such things as now, the Senate and the
House, and what is going to happen, he said, well, you know,
you remember that West Coast operation.

And I said, yes.

And he said, you didn't know we opened the mail, ae

did you?

And I said, no, I didn't know you opened the mail.

That was the first time I ever heard they opened it.

Mr. Dick. Are you referring to Mr. GE?

Mr. Osborn. Yes.

Mr. Dick. What division was Mr. QRENRS in?

Mr. Osborn. He was with@@Qo) at that time.

Mr. Wallach. I take it by your actions -- this might
be speculation, and if you don't want to answer, feel free
not to.

Mr. Osborn. If I do, I will establish that it is
speculation.

Mr. Wallach. You would not have approved the West
Coast operation if you knew it involved mail opening?

Mr. Osborn. I would not -have approved it -- the

Director might have approved it, but it wasn't the way
I briefed it, and it wasn't my understanding with Mr. Cotter.

Mr. Wallach. In other words, you did give Mr. Cotter
assurance that this was only a mail cover type of operation?

Mr. Osborn. That was the understanding I had with Mr.
Cotter, to the best of my recollection.

Mr. Wallach. Have you subsequently discussed the
West Coast operation with Mr. Cotter?

Mr. Osborn. Yes, I have. Since I am under oath,

I had lunch with Bill Cotter and Marv Gentile on Tuesday of:

this week, and we naturally discussed this stuff. We went
over the fact that he recalled me, and that both of us were
instrumental in terminating the New York project. And I have
forgotten the exact context, but the San Francisco thing
came up. And I told him, I didn't even know the mail was
being opened until I talked tofitinneey.

He said, you didn't?

And I said, no.

He said, well, it was. He said, I just found out about
it. I presume through testimony or something.

But that was the essence of my discussion.

Mr. Wallach. Did Mr. Cotter talk to you about any
FBI mail opening projects?

Mr. Osborn. No, he did not. We were’in a public res-

taurant. We doubletalked.

you have any knowledge of it?

Mr. Osborn. The first time I ever saw the Huston Plan
was in the newspapers.

Mr. Wallach. Didn't Mr. Helms know that mail was being
opened in New York in 1971?

Mr. Osborn. Of course he did.

Mr. Wallach. Did you know why Mr. Helms would have asked
the President for authority to open mail in 1971, then?

Mr. Osborn. I have no idea.

Mr. Wallach. Calling your attention to a memorandum dated
February 16, 1973, captioned "Visit to Headquarters re SR
EOIEER ," I will ask you to quickly read that over.

Mr. Osborn. TI must have been Iden 18:

Mr. Wallach. The first question would be, do you recall
a meeting in your office at which you notified Mr. Issaeff
that the project would be terminated?

Mr. Osborn. I don't think I dealt with Issaeff. I think
I would have Senit with one of my people. But it could have
been Issaeff. I don't know. I remember suspending it.

Mr. Wallach. And do you remember telling Mr. Issaeff in
words or substance that he should not tell anyone on the CI
Staff that you wanted to tell the Director of the CIA Staff
yourself?

Mr. Osborn. I very probably would have. I had very close

relationships with Jim Angleton professionally.
