Dear Mr. Attorney General: U chgee’

Enclosed is a photocopy of an article which was published’
by the Denver Post on December 28, 1969. I have been
requested by the Denver Post and friends of Dr. Riha,

who is @ constituent of mine, to do everything possible = ae 4

to assist in either locating the Professor or in determin- 8

ing additional facts about his disappearance. eal |
33

It seems to me that the interest of the nation in general ae ae i

and the credibility of the FBI in particular is not well Seo t

served by the proliferation of a belief that Professor Riha ggg 7

is the victim of some kind of international intrique, if a53 :

such is not the case. BEgs :
: ;

Despite the implications found in the Denver Post article, geet !

I think it is quite possible that Professor Riha left
* Boulder because of domestic complications ATTORNEY C
