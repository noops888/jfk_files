Enclosed is a photocopy of an article which was published'

by the Denver Post on December 28, 1969. I have been

requested by the Denver Post and friends of DI. Riha,

who is

à constituent of mine, to do everything possible

to assist in either locating

the Professor or in determin-

ing additional facts about his disappearance.

It seems to me that the interest of the nation in general

and the credibility of the FBI in particular is not well

served by the proliferation of a belief that Professor Riha

is the victim of some kind of international intrique, if

such is not the case.

Despite the implications found in the Denver Post article,

I think it is quite possible that Professor Riha left

In this spirit I last week asked

A, FEDERAL EU. OF IN. *91S

the fBIlto provide me,

either formally or informally, with a report on what the

Bureau has done to locate Professor Rihad I wANin@ $970

Last friday that, aside Irom a file of inquiries made in

Professor Riha's behalf, the Bureau has not, lookea into

the matter and is not conducting inquiries

I so informed

the

However, in the course of similar

federal

agencies, [I learned from the Central Intelligence

Agency that at one point last year it made some preliminary

inquiries, determined that no transactions within its

jurisdiction were involved, and turned over whatever files

were generated to the fbI.

CIA also informed me that it

understands, unofficially, that the FBI did look into

matter

the

and that the Bureau may well know the
