According to statements by a senior CIA officer in 1967, made
to the Inspector General, the Agency was instructed to develop a :
capability to conduct assassinations. Termed an "executive action
. capability, '' such a project was ‘initiated in 1961, aopceenely assuming
an existing cryptonym, ZRRIFLE. At the request of the case officer
(the same officer providing this information in 1967), a tiatdeatiie

asset in Europe, QJWIN, was to be used ‘in the project. The éase

officer understood that QUWIN-had been considered in 1960 for use
in the assassination of Patrice Lumumba, but that the proposed
operation was never carried out because the designated CIA case
officer declined the assignment.

The case officer in charge of ZRRIFLE also was involved in an

operation to assassinate Fidel coneeor running from early 1962 to

mid-1963. "However, QUWIN was not used i in this effort, reliance

being placed instead on a Cuban exile leader. QUWIN was never
briefed on the Castro operation, according to the officer handling
ZRRIFLE and the Castro operation.

Records do show that QIWIN was dispatched to the Congo in

1960, being there in November and December 1960, prior to the

death of Lumumba at the hands ‘of Congolese. However, there is no
evidence to suggest that QUJWIN was in any way involved in Lumumba's
demise. The case officer who was the source of the information of

the contemplated use of QIWIN in such an activity understood that he
was never used in this ee The following information reviews
existing knowledge beyond that summarized above.

A 13 October 1960 dispatch from -Rameytransmits notes to
headquarters from one of the two officers who subsequently met
QIWIN in Luxembourg. The oes list the names of police officials
and criminal elements and allude to the Pee cimteies of finding safe-
crackers and document-suppliers. : :

QUWIN was met in Luxembourg on 19 and 20 October 1960 by
two Agency officers and was asked if he would undertake a trip to
Africa, presumably Dakar. (The appropriate dispatch, dated
2 November 1960, lists only Luxembourg and Dakar as addressees.)

He was not given the true objective of his mission because of its.
extreme sensitivity and pending a final decision to use him. Instead,
he was told that the Soviets were operating in Africa among nationality
groups, specifically Corsicans, and he was being asked to spot,
assess, and recommend some dependable, quick-witted persons for

our use. He agreed to go on the trip. On 2 November QJWIN was

met in Frankfurt by an Agency officer, and he accepted an offer to



14-00000

proceed to Leopoldville. (P sddutahbty | the idea for sending him

there originated at headquarters because someone must have

considered him qualified to handle a potential operation there.) The
precise mission was not conveyed to QUWIN, and he was only informed :

that the mission might involve a large element of personal risk. We

_ do not know and at present are unable to determine what the assignment

was. Subsequent cable traffic discusses arrangements for QIWIN to go
first to Leopoldville and then to Dakar.

*. On 8 December QIWIN was in Leopoldville where he cultivated

a close personal relationship with a Yugoslav Air Force pilot. There
follow. suggestions in cable traffic on what approach QJ WIN should use
pl ‘recruit him.’ However, a special channel FI/D cable of 14 December
rates this target as marginal when considered against the framework of ©
plans for QUWIN and instructs him to desist if action has not already

been taken. The first paragraph of this cable states that we "would

like restrict QUWIN to activity directly pertinent his mission

-Leopoldville or forthcoming mission Dakar and possibly elsewhere

(e. g.,° Milan) for FI/D purposes. He our only asset of this type and

’ we wish keep him clean of any operational involvement other than that

originally planned for him." This cable would tend to rule out

involvement in an assassination plot, since it is highly unlikely that

BS eal

an individual picked for such a sensitive and dangerous assignment |
would be burdened with other chores or assignments immediately
thereafter.

Lumumba was still alive, albeit under arrest, as of the middle ~
of January 1961, and it seems clear that QIWIN had left the Congo
in December 1960. A 19 December cable to Leopoldville authorizes
his return to Luxembourg on 21 December and instructs Luxembourg
to pay him 1000 dollars for December salary, which is the final
payment for his sericea on this operation. Also, headquarters was
working out the details of a Congo assignment. An lI January 1961
headquarters memorandum, which refers to T/A's dated 21 December
1960, states that the referenced amounts were given to QUWIN by the
Chief of Station, Luxembourg. This suggests that QUWIN was in-
Luxembourg on or before 21 December.

Subsequently, it appears that QUWIN operated in Europe trying
to spot and assess individuals whom the Agency could use in safe-

‘cracking operations, in line with one of the principal missions of

FI/D. A24 May 1962 cable to Luxembourg mentions that a decision

‘was made to keep him in Europe and that the Leopoldville assignment
had been cancelled. Atransfer to Baden-Baden is deemed a good

choice. Also, a 24 April 1964 disptach from Luxembourg, which

- mentions the termination of QUWIN's contfact, refers to the fact
that his only assignment since January 1962 has been to establish
cover.

Agency officers who were handling ‘Qu WIN in Europe were almost
certainly unaware of the fact that he was being considered as an asset
by the senior Agency official who had begun to become active in E
February 1962 in the assassination plot against Castro. An 3

(EYES ONLY) memorandum from the Deputy Director. (Plans) refers

a
i : to a 19 February. 1962 memorandum and authorizes the retention of
the services of QIWIN in activities which we have identified as
coincidential with the assassination plot against Castro. The date of |
Be the reference memorandum coincides with the time that the senior

Agency official became actively involved in this enterprise. A
memorandum of 27 June 1963 dealing with the further handling of
QIWIN mentions that this enterprise has been terminated, except

for one precautionary "life line."

In summary, it is almost certain that QUWIN had nothing at all
to do with the assassination of Lumumba, pts though the contents ana
language of available files are often cryptic and imprecise. If he had
been, it is highly unlikely that the number of Agency officers handling

and contemplating assignments for him would have been so large. The



14-00000

@ | SeE
any y : i -
headquarters division for wat ie aC, was concerned, inter
alia, with obtaining foreign cipher and cade books, and it is reasonable
to conclude that QUWIN's primary and exclusive responsibility was to
find individuals who could do this kind of job. One of the officers who
first met QUWIN in Luxembourg was on a trip overseas to find safe-
Uckets and document-suppliers. The 14 December. 1960 cable
mentions keeping him clean and using him in Dakar and possibly Milan,
which was specifically mentioned in the 13 October dispatch af offering

good possibilities for finding safecrackers and document-suppliers.

- Further, good tradecraft practices would dictate that the last thing

that would keep an individual clean would be involvement in an

assassination plot. Although the Chief of FI/D coincidentally was

later assigned responsibility for the Castro operation, there is

no evidence to suggest that he was privy to assassination plots prior

to his briefing in late 1961.
While QJWIN was considered for use in the "executive action

capability", there is no information available to suggest that he had

ever been approached in this regard, much less used in any of the

planning.

Based on available evidence iv Gedms clear that the Agency
was in no way involved in'the assassination of Lumumba. However,
in the course of our research, two aspects of the Lumumba story
surfaced that indicate Agency involvement in a plot. In the one
instance, our 1967 source mentioned the name of an Agency officer
‘who was designated as the case officer for an assassination plot
against Lumumba, but reported that he had declined the assignment.
That officer was the originator of a 19 December 1960 cable to
Leopoldville in which he authorized the return of QUWIN to

Luxembourg on 21 December to await further instructions and the

payment of 1000 dollars to him for his December salary by the

Luxembourg Station. The last paragraph of the cable advises
Leopoldville that headquarters is working out the details of a Congo
assignment for QUWIN. The same officer was the originator of a
31 January 1961 memorandum dealing with payments to QUWIN.

In the ‘second instance, a 17 December 1960 cable from

Leopoldville deals with the activities of a newly recruited agent,

* WIROGUE, whose mission was to try to spot persons for a”

surveillance team, intelligence assets (with emphasis on Orientale

Province), and paramilitary assets. The second paragraph of the

cable mentions that he resided in the same hotel as QUWIN (although

neither knew of the others CIA connection) and that. he approached

the latter on 14 December with an offer Sf 300 dollars per month to
participate in an intelligence net and to be a member of an "execution
squad."" When QIWIN said that he was not interested, WIROGUE
added that there would be bonuses for special jobs. The cable .
mentioned in paragraph 6 that the Station was concerned with the free
wheeling of WIROGUE, his lack of security, his inability to handle
finances, and his unwillingness to follow instructions. The Station
was willing to keep him on probation, but believed his recall would -
be the best solution. : A suggested alternative a to put him in :
Stanleyville to try to obtain immediate intelligence on that ice

In an attempt to reconstruct events, ‘Africa Division was apprised
of the above and was asked to search its records in an attempt to
clarify what WIROGUE was up to in the Congo and his reference to an
Nexecution squad."' The research did not clarify the matter to any
great extent, although some assumptions can be made on the basis of
circumstantial evidence. On 19 September 1960, two members of
Africa Division met with WIROGUE to discuss an operational assign-
ment in that division. In connection with the assignment, he was to
be trained in demolitions, small arms, and medical immunization.

In October 1960, a cable to Leopoldville stated that he was being

prepared for a deep cover assignment to arrive Leopoldville late



14-00000

November. Headquarters ‘noted ‘en intent to use him as a utility :
agent in order to '(a) organize and conduct a surveillance team; (b)
intercept packages; (c) blow up bridges; and (d) execute other assign-
ments requiring positive action. His utilization is not to be restricted. .
to Leopoldville. Indeed, he may ibe subject to call by other African
stations although it is-expected for him to be resident in Leopoldville. if

: WIROGUE arrived in Leopoldville on 2 December 1960. His case
‘officer gave him the following ae retctioda! fa) to build cover pos sibly
by opening a photographic shop; and (b) to try to spot Seer fora '

surveillance team, intelligence assets and paramilitary assets.

Shortly after arrival, WIROGUE ran into QUWIN, who later told the

i
station that WIROGUE looked like an intelligence agent. In attempting
to recruit QUWIN for his “execution squad", WIROGUE exceeded his

instructions to avoid making approaches without checking with ie

Leopoldville Station.

ot In January 1961, at the request of the Leopoldville Station,

“WIROGUE was given permission to take flying lessons. By March,

he had obtained the position of adviser to the Congolese Air Force
aed ” ‘with the rank of majon; in that capacity he was used by CIA for the :
purpose of gathering intelligence on the Congolese Air Force, By

April, the Gongoles$ were trying to use him to obtain arms and

Congolese to fly aircraf t} He bucenchie ad eam e in July because

he had run into difficulty obtaining a residence permit, and his CIA

contract was terminated in September 1961.

Africa Division believes that WIROGUE was recruited for his
Congo assignment because of his third country national background .
in order to establish a support Seechgtleed in Leopoldville. At the
time the Congo was in chaos, we had few assets there, and the
likelihood existed that the political situation would degenerate .
quickly. The Station possibly also wanted to have a latent paramilitary
capability. An October 1964 assessment of WIROGUE indicates little
flap potential with him since he knew little about the Agency. He spent

most of his time trying to develop contacts and was not directly involved

-in any particular operation.
