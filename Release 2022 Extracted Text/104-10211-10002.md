FENORANDUM FOR: Chief, SR/OI
suasEcT 1 3-13 May Interrogation of NOSEWKO

1. Although I have attended all nine (5) sessions in the current
phaie ef KOSENKO's Interrogation, I as yet have been unable te deterrine
the reasons fer the interregatex]!) conduct and canner and the true purzese

of the phase itself,
| 24 he the interrogater noted in the beginning, he 4s te be concerned

only vith "certain personal matters." The interregation of HOSEIKO aleng — -e—

puch Lites and WSEWKO's responses — neither have produced any change in

gy opinion ef BOSERAO ner have appeared te have opened up any news useful

er valuable informtion to use

3. Perbaps, from the psychelogists! point of view, this interrogation
has beon ef sene value; but, even if this is se, I cannet seo it froma
review of his reports. These reperts all contain basic errers arising from
the psychelegist's lack ef knewlédge of Soviet reality ani his lack ef
experience with the trus nature ef Soviet man. The psychelogist is net
prepared te preperly deal with ami evaluate NOSEKEO because NOSENKO 4s
first, a Russian; second, a Ceviets third, a Communist) and, in adéition te

all of this, o highly trained intelligence agent.

he HOSEIKO 4s one of a Kind, It 1s quite Likely that the psychologist "7

never has exporierced such a persenslity tefore, Then, with the wide
@ifference in thei: backgrounds ani the psychelegist's resulting inability

te understund NOSENZO's character, it 4s understandable that be cannet

Eo e a : of

have backgrounds mere similar te that of NOSEN:O and experience vith persens

ef NOSENXO's type. This becemes mero ond rere ebvious to me as I beartim the
psycholegist say, "Well, he is probably telling the truth,” when ob I have
seen clearly that MOSENO hae been lying. There have been many such cases in
this Mi latest phase of the interregatien,
i 5» As a result of such instances — instances ef "soft interrogation,”
where BOSEHKO's ebvious liey have nst been challenged — rosereo can new enly
be getting the impression that there still 1s a way eut for bin, Ve mst
renenber that HOSENAO cane to us prepared only fer complete success er
failures; he expected that in the case of failure he would be subjected te
195969} hard interregatien, harsh treatment, strong punichrent. Yet he new
finds himself in the peculiar position ef having BOMensapnnassIlOM outwardly
failed in his prinsry assignnent, yet being faithy vell treated ani allowed te
continue with his lies and dezinferratsiya despite his detention, Hs can new
enly be thinking that there still 1s seme hepe for hin and for his mission, ©

wrote: "se. After apologizing fer having stenach trouble he becane rest

11. If HOSEMAO dees not renerter what his father did.— how be verked ond
studied, vhen the family neved, when he vas admitted te the CPSU — why does ne
net ssy se? Why is he apparently guessing at these things? Alse, why can’t ke
remexber these things vhen ke can rezenber being held acress his father's knees?

12. The psycholegists repert includes and assessment ef HOSEKKO's rether:
"gn hypothesis that could be rade based on the description of the mther, vould
be that she weild have dif:iculty adjusting avay from Nikelayev where she bad
een bern uni where she could depend on her rether." Of whem is this net tree?
Who dees net experience sexe difficulty in roving cvay from fariliar neighborhoods
and friends? . De ve really need this assessrent ef NOSEN<O'S rethers eretions ef

13. The psychelogist's report continues! “se. His (1SSHXO's) vother

where he started the first grade (in Spetenmber 1935). NOSENSO could not,
hev.ver, describe the scheol er name even ene ef bis teachers, When the
dactor insisted this tine that MOSENKG nate sone friends, he gave the
rickname, "Shturn,” but failed to give the bey's true nam he alse Wseal

20. General. During these latest sessi.ns, ICSENKO has been try:ng
very hard to put the recerd of his achoeling in proper erder. But in
view of what has been stated in the past/ biome and his present
errers, it must be said that be Je finding it impossible and he 1s somh
not at all convincing. In ry o;4nien everything he has teld us about
thie, starting from the 1941 peried, has been a lie. It is pessible that
he really vas in Kuybyshev and Balu for one reason cr another, but EMO his
tim description ef the circumstances oni situations is unbelievable tem and
fits ne Seviet pattern ef life. .

21. On 4 May MOSENKO said that while be attended the 585th Bigh Scheslza:.

these were not fricnis ho alse lived on Serafinevich Street, norwere they...

were children of high officiels, except SABUROV.

MEMORANDUM OF TRANSHITTAL
TO + ‘Chief, SDVCI/E :
“ATEN: ” ARDONOR. Interrogation Transcripts

1. Submitted herevith, as requested, are AEDIPPER/20's verbatin
‘transcripts (15; ‘Englishe-language) of his interrogation of AEDONOR,
26 July-13 August 1955; the first five (5) of these transcripts; are
accompanied by the corresponding verbatin Russian-language transcripts |
(Russian-language transcripts for Reels #s 6 and 7 are ready for :

typing, 1f required); an index to the names mentioned in all of the

transcripts also is submitted. Further, the original Englishelanguage

with this memo; the fifteen (15) corresponding tape recordings already

have been returned.
2, With regard to the remainder of the original Headquarters

request, it has been agreed that ABDIPPER/20's transcripts are self~ i
explanatory at most points and that his background comments on the
course and content of the interrogation will be reserved, to be
addressed to any future specific questions and requirements generated
in Headquarters review of those transcripts. :

3. It should be noted here, however -= in view of part three (3)
of Headquarters’ request == that AEDIPPER/20 did not use false or
unfounded statements for any reason in any of the interrogation -

sessions; it is believed possible that ideas to the contrary may

have arisen during review of-the original transcripts, which included
many instances of inproper interpretation of the Russian "double
negative", Reviewing the “{nterrogation, AEDIPPER/20 noted only tvo (2)
points at which he did not have a basis in detailed personal knowledge

(to 1954) or specific documents for statements made to ADCCNOR:
