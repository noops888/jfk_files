SUBJECT

s 3-13 May Intorrogation of NOSENKO

1a Although I haro attonded all nino (S) sossions in the curront

phaso of liOSElitO's Intorrogation, I as jot bave been unable to detorilno

tha reasons for tha Intorrogatory conduct and sanser and the true purposo

of the phase itsolf.

.2a As the Intortogator noted in the beginning, ho is to bo concorned

only vith "certain personal settors." The interrogation of NOSElKO along

such linos und iFSElKO's rasponses - neithor havo produced any chango in

Dy opinion oL NOSENiO nos havo appeared to havo opened up any new, useful

or vulliblo inforDition to uS.

3. Perbaps, Iron the psychologists" point of viou, this intorrogation

has beon of sove value; but, even 1f this 1s 30, I canrot sea 1t fros a

roview of his reports. Thase roports all contain basic arrors arising fros

psychelogist's lack of knovlidgo of Soviet saality and his lack of

experienco vith the true naturo of Sovlot san. The psychologiot 1s not:

prepared to proparly doal with ani avaluato NOSEITO becauso NOSENiO 15

first, a Russian; seconà, a Soviet; thire, a Communists and, In addition to

all of this, a highly tratica Intelligenco agent.

La ROSELLO 1s OnO of a lizá. It 1s quite likely that the psychologist si.

never has exporierced such a personality kofore.. Then, with the wide

differenco in their backgrewas and the psychologist's resulting inability

to uniorstind ISENZO's churactor, It 1s unierstaniablo that be cannot

properly Juaço NOSENKO and lils conduci. The Dost vo can bandiania 60 02 12

sura are the carefuily e nsidered opinions of thoso uba.

haro backgrounis noto similar to that of InSENiO and experienco uith persons

of HiStLikO's typo. This bocones sero aná sore obvious to so as I boarthra tho

psyckologist say, "Holl, he la probibly telling the trutb," when ste I havo

seon clearly that HOSElliO has been lying. There have bean sany such casos in

thís IN latest phase of the intorrogation.

So As a rosult of such instancos - Instances of "soft intorrogation,"

Whore SOSENKO's abulous Lloy hive sit been challenged - NOSEINO can you only

bo gotting the Inpression that there still 1s a way out for bin. le must

resenber that ROSENKO cars to us prepared only for completo succoss or

fallaro, ho espectod lhat in the caso of fulluro ho would bo subjected to

1s9egl bard Intorrogation, harsh treatsent, strong punishiont. let he sow

finds blesoll 1n the pocullar position of having ISURESHAMAsasAd autuardly

fallod In his prinary assignment, yet being faltty woll treatad asd allowed to

contimo with bis llos and dezinfortsiya despito his eetention. Ho can nou

only be thinkang that there still 15 sobe hope for biD and for b1s Idssion.

6. In his report on the 3 lay session (first sessina), the doctor

vroto: "... After apologizing fos having starach triublo he becase sast

recoptive and even eager to cooperato. In goneral bis sannor du-ing the

intertiou rosalned telered, siontanoous una ralevant.... As the Intortiou

progressed 1t lias auparent to so that de ves gottire considerable psychological t

relief fron tha ntervieu. At the tine he left, he actually told se goodbyo...."

This 1s typieal of sany such stetemonts ani Inchdatts which ano sy reasons for

asicinE - do ve rcally need this kind of InterrogatIon? HANaLrIEN

Tros oside the seart stroll we mast and lf to really ded to colder
