Re:

George N. Rosnek jads. state of Maryland

Dear Mr. Greaney:

This will confirm the fact that after discussions

with the investigating officer and Lieutenant Colonel Miller

of the Montgomery County Police

a single traffic

citation was issued to Mr. George N. Rosneke charging him

with failure to reduce speed to avoid a collision, which

is a violation of the motor vehicles laws.

On August 14, 1969, I met with (Mr. Rosnek jand representa-

cIves Ofyour agency at the Wheaton-Glenmont police station

and Mr.

Rosnek signed the traffic citation and posted anc

forfeited $18.00, representing a fine of $15.00 and $3.00

costs.

This is equivalent to a conviction, but avoids the

necessity of any Court appearance. When a record of this

conviction is forwarded to the Department Of Motor Vehicles

they will assess three points against Mr.

Rosneke but this

should not result in any action being taken against him by

the Department.

Following conversations with the owner of the

damaged vehicle, Mr. James E. Vest, we determined that a

fair and reasonable charge for repairs to his automobile

would be $188.90, and consequently we forwarded to him

by letter of August 1l our check in the amount of $189.90,

representing the agreed amount of damage together with

$1.00 for expenses in connection with Notary fees for

the execution of the general release which we prepared.

I enclose herewith the original and one executed

copy of the general

release, together with a copy of my

letter of August 11 to Mr. Vest, and copies of the two

estimates of damage which Mr. Vest forwared to us.

Mr. Vest was not at all vindictive, and in

fact indicated he was sorry he had caused Mr. Rosnek]ju

any difficulty, but had summoned the police upon the

advice of an Assistant State's Attorney of Montgomery

County who happened to be a witness to the accident.

Mr. Vest is completely satisfied with the adjustment

of his damages, and I explained to him that Mr. Rosnek !

was charged and elected to forfeit collateral, and I

feel certain that if Mr. Vest had had his way, there

would not have even been a necessity for a charge.

The Montgomery County Police Department was

most cooperative and the police officer is now in pos-

session of sufficient information to satisfy him con-

cerning the disposition which was made.

I am of the opinion that the disposition was

completely favorable, and I am pleased that we were able

to be of some assistancento you in this matter. I believe

I discussed with/Mr. Rosnek that an accident report would

probably have to be filed with the Department of Motor

Vehicles, and he may have attended to this. If not, I

suggest some representative of your office check with

the local police to determine whether an accident report

must be filed in this situation, and if so, that the same

be prepared and filed on behalf of Mr. Rosnek.joT

Inasmuch as nothing further remains to be done

by this office, we are closing our file, and we would

simply request that you issue your check in the amount

of $189.90, made payable to my firm as reimbursement for

et payabue

payment of damages made to Mr. Vest.

I prefer not to

make any charge for professional services rendered in this

particular matter.

With kindest regarden

• I. am,

Very truly yours,

Mr. James E. Vest

Silver Spring, Maryland

Dear Mr. Vest:

This will acknowledge receipt of copies of

the repair estimates which you received from Curtis

Chevrolet and Loving Chevrolet, Inc., in the amounts

of $187.49 and $188.90, respectively.

Confirming our

telephone conversation of this afternoon, we understand

you wish to have the repairs made by Loving Chevrolet,

and of course my client has no objection to this. Accord-

ingly. I enclose herewith my check in the amount of

9120 on representing pay end fu for the damage ry

fee in connection with your execution of the enclosed

release. I am forwarding two copies of the release

with the request that you have the original signed in

the presence of a Notary Public and return it to me in

the enclosed self-addressed envelope, retaining the

other copy for your files.

This is a standard form of

release used by this office, which I have altered to

exclude any reference to bodily injury since this was

solely a property damage accident. It is only neces-

sary that you have one witness, who can be the Notary.

17 Again, may I offer apologies on behalf of

Mr. Rosnek) for the inconvenience caused you.

Very truly yours,

John F. McAuliffe
