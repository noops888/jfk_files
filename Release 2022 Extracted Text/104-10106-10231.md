Re: (ccorse N. Rosnek\ads. State of Maryland
Dear Mr. Greaney:

This will confirm the fact that after discussions
with the investigating officer and Lieutenant Colonel Miller”
of the Montgomery Count: Police Pepartment, a single traffic
citation was issued oli. George N. Rosnek,] charging him
with failure to reduce-Speed to avoid a collision, which
is a violation of the motor vehicles laws of the State.

On August 14, 1969, I met with(Mr. R snekijand representa-
tives of. your agency at the fwheéaton-Glenmont) police station
ana. osnexd eigned the traffic citation and posted and
forfeited $18.00, representing a fine of $15.00 and $3.00
costs. This is equivalent to a conviction, but avoids the
necessity of any Court appearance. When a record of this
conviction is forwarded to the Department, pf Motor Vehicles
they will assess three points agains (Mr. "Rosnek. ut this
should not result in any action being taken against him by
the Department.

Following conversations with the owner of the
damaged vehicle, Mr. James E. vest, we determined that a
fair and reasonable charge for repairs to his automobile
would be $188.90, and consequently we forwarded to him
by letter of August 11 our check in the amount of $189.90,
representing the agreed amount of damage together with
$1.00 for expenses in connection with Notary fees for
the execution of the general release which we prepared.

I enclose herewith the original and one executed
copy of the general release, together with a copy of my


“deni

2.

letter of August 11 to Mr. Vest, and copies of the two
estimates of damage which Mr. Vest forwared to us.

Mr. Vest was not at all vindictive, and in
fact indicated he was sorry he had caused/Mr. Rosnek]| v7
any difficulty, but had summoned the police upon the
advice of an Assistant State’s Attorney of Montgomery
County who happened to be a witness to the accident.
Mr. Vest is completely satisfied with the adjustment o
of his damages, and I explained to him that/Mr. Rosnek
was charged and elected to forfeit collateral, and I
feel certain that if Mr. Vest had had his way, there
would not have even been a necessity for a charge.

The Montgomery County Police Department was
most cooperative and the police officer is now in pos- J
session of sufficient information to satisfy him con-
cerning the disposition which was made.

I am of the opinion that the disposition was
completely favorable, and I am pleased that we were able
to be of some assistanceyto you in this matter. I believe
I discussed with/Mr. Rosnek]that an accident report would
probably have to be filed with the Department of Motor
Vehicles, and he may have attended to this. If not, I
suggest some representative of your office check with
the local police to determine whether an accident report
must be filed in this situation, apd if so, that the same
be prepared and filed on behalf oflur. nosnek sfo7

Inasmuch as nothing further remains to be done
by this office, we are closing our file, and we would
simply request that you issue your check in the amount
of $189.90, made payable to my firm as reimbursement for
payment of damages made to Mr. Vest. I prefer not to
make any charge for professional services rendered-in this
particular matter. E

With kindest regards) I.am,

very truly yours,

fohn F. McAfliffe

Dear Mr. Vest:

This will acknowledge receipt of copies of
the repair estimates which you received from Curtis
Chevrolet and Loving Chevrolet, Inc., in the amounts
of $187.49 and $188.90, respectively. Confirming our
telephone conversation of this afternoon, we understand
you wish to have the repairs made by Loving Chevrolet,
and of course my client has no objection to this. Accord-
ingly, I enclose herewith my check in the amount of
ting payment in fll fe to
Car ped re eevee any’ Gxpehbes for" Sotaiey
fee in connection with your execution of the enclosed
release. I am forwarding two copies of the release
with the request that you have the original signed in
the presence of a Notary Public and return it to me in
the enclosed self-addressed envelope, retaining the
other copy for your files. This is a standard form of
release used by this office, which I have altered to
exclude any réference to bodily injury since this was
solely a property damage accident. It is only neces-
sary that you have one witness, who can be the Notary.
