SUBJECT 2 Proposed Eeactivation of Support to Manuel

1. This paper requests approval for CIA's recornondation

-_ 2. As of 1 May 1985, CIA ternirated its support of

isngahanganonasgapanecsonenfert

Manve! drtiee's paranilitary actavities. CIA is now proposing
that support to Artine ard his movement be. resumed ca a smaller
scale and for a‘totally distinc:, psychological baletdbastia purpore.
3. Artime‘s cooperation with CIA in the Liquidation of

bis paramilitary organization was exexplary, indicating his

,fecognition that his long range interests are vest cerved by

though anadequate,was nonetheless the most aggressive and
large scale effort conducted by any exile organization. Of
even more long range importance, perhaps, is the fact that
Artime and the MRR have represented since 1958 an effort at i
democratic, Catholic-oriented reform within Cuba--one which
originally allied itself with Castro as long as he appeared

anti-communist, but broke with him as soon as his communist

" connections becase evident. Artine himself was an important
“Yéeter in the field of agzicultural reform in the early days
- ef the Castro regime, whens he was de facto chief of the

. agricultural reform program in Oriente Province. Here he -

dinvented the system of “rural commandos”, i.e., groups of

students who worked in the rural areas with the less privileged
youth, teaching reading and writing, public health and sanita-

tion, organization of cooperatives, improved agricultural

“methods, and similar suijects. (Information on his efforts

does not, by the way, oe’ only from Artime; a large number of

“members of his movement were debriefed by CIA in 1960 when

they ‘Vert Cuba. Many of them were later trained as part of.
“Brigade 2506 and fought in the Bay of Pigs landing.) Thus,

< Artime has more of @ claim to a reputation as & prectten? and



Organizer, he has the virtue of being willisg to seiegate
authority to those nore cospetent in this respect thas be.

5. Because Artime is a born politician and propagandist
who can be useful now, and because he has potential as a
leader in post-Castro Cuba, CIA proposes to continue support.
ing him to the extent necessary to preserve the MRR. This

organization, which has representatives in half a svzen Latioa
American countrie

well

in the United States and Spain,
claims approximately 5000 members and sympathizers. It makes

radio broadcasts to Cuba from the Miamt area and publishes a
-well-conceived monthly magazine, Tridente, with circulation

- Of about 6000. Finally, it supports @ numbér of dependents
° ‘and families of killed and captured MRR menbers. Total cra

expenditures under. the proposed prograa would be about 315,000

To tnis end, he has had discussions with the presidents of
Colombia, Panama, Costa Rica, Guatemala, and Nicaragua, all

of whon he clains have evinced varying degrees of interest.
Most recently, he has receiv

&n invitation to visit
President Barrientos of Bolivia, an invitation stimulated by
One of Barrientos’ representatives in the U.S. having heard
an URR broadcast ebout countering subversion through civic
action. Artine plans to accept this invitation, going to

Bolivia after a visit with President Robles of Panama. CIA
Goes not at this time have any plans to support Artine's civic

“artine and the countries supposedly interested. It is con-
@eivadle, however, that if these efforts appear to catch on

Dear Jim: J. Prvtrers Drovens & *

it wt op veniley,
I am informing you of the folloving: ao Feld hogar oh vmerate®

erth Seeres-
1, According to information recheved from Guillerao Vargas,

fn San Jose, Costa Rica, who bas friends who have infiltrated the

Communist group of Marcial Aguiluz, the following is reported:
It has been approximately five wonths that Nicaraguans and Costa
Ricans have been trained in the farm that Marcial Aguiluz owns
by Rio Claro (in EMMEKXEIME the south of Costa Rica), This training
” 4s given in small groups of 5 7 10, in order to be ane to hide and
go into the interior or the jungle that is there in case the
governzent of Costa Rica makes a surprise inspection, They (Communists)
think that Somoza is expecting an infiltration of guerrillas from
Cuba: through the Atlantic and they plan to eurprise the iicaraguan
government by infiltrating this group through the Pacific ir
Nicaragua. Then as soon as the Government of Nicaragua mobilizes
SM treops towards the Pacific; Fidel will send another group
through the Atlantic, They hope to do this before the elections.
‘They hope that men who are already in Nicaragua will prepare their
arrival by creating chaos, sabotaging, and terroriam, They have
brought incendiariez =nd equipment for sabotage Aate Nicaragua and it
appears that thuy have a great cargo of arms in LRON (Nicaragua), i fies
2, According to information from Alejandro Montere, a Costa Rican
‘who is married to a Cuban, the following is cyported: In the :
"DONINELLY" apartments in San Jose, Costa Sica, where Alejandro
Montero lives, there also lives one Luis Campoa who reunites. weekly
‘dn his apartment. (I think it is #8 in"DONINELLY") with the XMMIINN

Conmunist leadera:. Manuel Mora, Dr. Durstin, Dr, Worern, and one
Cordas f Ratael Castillo, A

jandro Montero has heard talk about



-2-

certain plans in store for Nicaragua, plans for which ¥arcial
Aguiluz went to consult about in Cuba, They Gonmuniacehttahe ED
waiting for the arrival of Marcial, whom they supposed would
bring the name of the individua? vho was supposed to arrive from
Cuba,after Marcial had returned, to take charge of the Nicaraguan
business. They KMMHMAF ( the Conmunists at the meeting) assused
that the man who would take charge could be Max Santos Pastor, a
Costa Rican, who is now in Cuba, Montero also heard them speaking
about an interview that ‘ora Valverde, Marcial Aguiluz and Aguero
(an obstructionist Nicaraguan candidate “tn the coming presidential
elections) had, the last time that Aguero was in Costa Rica. It is

_ Alejandro Monteros® opinion that if Aguero is not in on the conspiracy

then he is at least he is informed about all of it.

$8. Upon looking for information about the individuals who meet
in. the apartuents Doninelly, I investigated Rafael Castillo,

alias "CHITO."" He is a Communist who has been in Russia and Cuba.
He gots money by taking the relatives of exiled Cubans out of Cuba.

. He ig a personal friend of Fidel Castro. He is a brother of “one of

the men who is a confident friend" of Daniel Oduber XHXEXXHEXNEXXXX
(his, Rafael Castillos’, brother is ownerof the Night Club “Caracas"),
This (Rafael Castillos') brother always stood by Daniel in the past

” presidential campaign.

Rafael Castillo pians to go to Cuba soon, (I think he was scheduled to
leave the 17th of January). —
Rafael Castillo hea in his house, which is at the same time an office, .

This man, Mario Castillo, has a telephone number 252296, ana aX
he has a pick up, license plate C-7981, All this information was
given to me by our Cuban agents: Mario Moya and Sergio Cabrera
who live in San Jose, Costa Rica.
4. As I was almost. like a commissionA¥ agent for the "Scopitone, Inc."
of Chicago, I had two XWXHHWXMEN. commercial interviews with Frank
Marshall, at ‘the last interview he told me he wanted to speak alone
with me (at both meetings there had been present two representatives
from the Scopitone co,), I made an appointment with him at the Hotel
"Costa RicaY HMNHE where Scopitons; had a suite,
There I spoke rlone with him on 12 december at 12:00 in the afternoon,
in hotel room #204, _
He told me that he wanted to buy arms from ma that he knew I had,
Z told him that the ones I had had in Nicaragua I had turned in to
the government (that is false), and that there were only some left
in other pleces in Contral America, I told him -I‘had to inow f+
what cause these arms were going to be utilized, I also told him thet
I had the moral obligation to EXHW be vigilant and see that the
Communists would not utilize them, I told him that I wae not 2
vendor of arms, but a revolutionary, (I talked to him about this
trying to get information out of him, because these arms of mine are
only for Cuba and against Castro.)



A a em et mn

4.

He told me that he needed them for himself, that he expected a
revolutionary outburst from one moment to the next in Costa Rica
and that he didn't want his “private arsenal" to be smaller than
the ones that Calderon Guaraias!‘Pepe Figueres, SOGuvers dad the
Communists had (according to him each of the aforementioned groups
had their own arsenals).
I asked him when he needed these arms and he answered:NOW,
I told him I would have to take three weeks to think about and then
I would give him an answer: he answered after thinking for a while:
okay, I can give you one month to give me an answer but no more.
My opinion is that he is in a plot to overthrow the government. :
The situation in Costa Rica is very bad, for the unhappy president does
not have a definite political group to support him, and therafore
he is in the hands of the diverse groups to advocated him: Calderon
Guardia, Ulate, Echandi, Frank Marshall, ete. these are persons who
each have a group who respond to their own sectarian interests and
not to Costa Rica, and who respond much less to the President.
Liberacion Nacional XERERAIMEXAEXHESE BABAR KHNESR is expecting "aw
a Comp detest

in order for them to give a counter-attack and
stay in power!" : : :
'S, On 7 December at 4:09 Fm, Thad an interview with SXMSSXX Daniel
Oduber XHXHXEX’ (lawyer) in his office. (about three blocks from. the
Hotel Costa Rica). , :
He XK spoke badly to mo about Don Pepe Figueres and "Chico Orlich",
he told that they wanted to eliminate his presidential aspirations
for the coming campaign and postulate Don Pepe again, He said that
they (Don Pepe and Orlich) were the Johnsons of Costa ica and he was
the Kennedy. :

I'm lucky, he said, that they are stupid and that they are not aware

of the fact that an attack is being created and they are not. -
} prepared for that emergency. I am prepared, he told me, Then he
told mo that he had an airfield big enough for a C-46 on his farm,

close to the border with Nicaragua, MYXXMMXEMMXEXE on the Pacific
“pide, and that at the determined moment he could receive arms at
that place, He again

ked for my collaboration in the case of

&@ revolt in Costa Rica and he concretely asked me that if at the
time of a revolt I would help with technicians and arms,
6, About Dr, Alvarez Tormo: He has stayed in contact with the | i

bcd

people of the Cuban Embassy in Mexico, He is very worried because
these people ask for information and he does not “now what to say
for the contact from the Company that spoke with him in Mexico, spoke
“with him just.one time and he has not returned to speak with him

again, He cannot find him because thoy did not leave him the necessary
signals, The people from the Cuban Embassy in Mexico paid for his
trip to the homage which was at the Basque Center that they gave the
professors of the medical faculty of Havana (Dr. Alvarez Tormo was

@. professor). Dr. Alvarez Tormo was one of the speakers. This took :
place the 3rd and 4th of December in Miami, : oh
Dr. Alvarez Tormo gave them detailed information on everything that
was said at the function (by suggestion of Don Manuel Guillot).
They have brought Dr. Alvarez Tormo trom Cuba, photographs and
letters from his relatives. (They were brougit by the people from
“the Cuban Embassy in Mexico),
Dr. Alvarez Tormo suggests that all the cuban exiles who have relatives |
Javing in prison in Cuba should be checked very cautiously because

“") the people in the Cuban Enbassy in Mexico have a magnificent network



Spain en nee ean

* @, A short time ago Mr, Zulueta , who resides in Spain, arrived in

“the state of Lister, in Oriente Province. He told him that this

oer to the border with Spain, but in ¥rance;) Hendeya is close to

of these types of agents who, because of blackmail, _ giving
information, I ask you that you treat Dr. Alvarez Tormo justly
because he is playing with his brothers life, I think that his é
work can be very useful.
In order to communicate with Dr. Alvarez Torao wo MMBX have cstablished i
@ pew code: : { ‘

The base of ‘the code is in the small book: "MI PRIMER DICCIONARIU. ESCOLAR" aettcteets
written by Jose Ardanuy Olague, from the publisher Vasco-Americana, ;
fn Bilbao, Spain. The key is the following:

the first number is the page of the book.

After this first number is placed a broken sign, -

The second number is the number of the line where the word that you want
to say is.

Only words in the dictionary that are Capitalized are used, that is

to say the first word in each line, the SANK word whose definition

is put after the small letter.

he words in the key are.separated by a dash (-).

Iftyou-do not obtain the book I will obtain it for you.

Miami for 1 short stay. This man, who spoke with Antonio Sanz, told
him that he had brought mo a meseage from someone who was in Spain.
He told him that Mr. Domingo Aizpurua, who resides in San Sebastian,
is a very close iriend of a Communist Spaniard who is in Cuba, in

Basque Commmiet every year goes to France to the town of Hendeya,
that is close to the Spanish border, and from there he calls Domingo
Aizpurua, and Dominge meets with him in France, (the Communist cannot
enter Spain that's why Domingo zoes to Hendeya a town which is

San Sebastian.

At the last sceting SEXM that they had, this Communist told Domingo

that be was tired of Communism and that 4% be could cleanse himself

'

t
with the west he would leave the ranks Qf Comsunism, Domingo, who :
is not a Communist, told him that the O@ly way of cleansing himself

with the Vest was to serve for a while 4% the ranks of Communism
‘for the west. He then

nt mo. this mestage with Zulueta,
I Rave already started to investigate the name and exact place of

oo

residence of the Communist, for he can ee of great help in Cuba,
being close to Lister, for us. : .

With nothing else for the moment, I, YOME friend, bid you goodbye

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, Western Hemisphere Division

SUBJECT: Termination of Subsidy to
Manuel ARTIKE Bu-.sa

1, A request for your approval is. contained in
paragraph 8.

2. As you are aware the Agency financially supported
the AMWORLD "unattributable operations" through ARTIME from
dune 1963 through April 1965 at a cost of approximately
seven million dollars. As of 1 May 1965 CIA with the
concurrence of the 303 Committee terminated this support.

3. On 8 June 1965, CIA sent a proposal to the 303

E Committee for restoration of support to Manuel ARTIME's
autonomous paramilitary group on a smaller scale for a

totally distinct psychological warfare purpose. Thi:

Pp al recommended expenditure of approximately $1

monthly distributed as follows:

Support of MRK officies in U.S., Spain,
Honduras, Guatemala, Colombia, Costa

Rica, Venezuela @ 3,200
Publication of TRIDENTE <>) 3,000
Radio Broadcasts. to Cuba “1,800
, ARTIME's travel in Central and eae
7 South Americ: “9,000
Bo . Support of dependents of killed, ai :
afi. °°. cs wounded and captured MRR members 5,000

TOTAL $15,000
The 303 Committee approved the above proposal.



4. In September 1965,°DC/WH/Cuba agreed to the
decision to cut ARTIME's subsidy to $5,000 monthly

5. On 4 May 1966, ARTIME was told by hin Head-

rters case officer that effective 1 June 1966 the

ttipends” to persons inside Cuba, who were allegedly
receiving it through the Spanish Embassy, would be
terminated. Therefore, effective 1 June 1966, ARTIME's:
payments from CIA would be cut" to $3,000, At this time
ARTINE was also advised that strict budgetary limitations
were now being imposed on all government spending because
of Viet Naz and other commitments and that-it was quite
likely that further cuts or the elimination of the
reuaining $3,000 ronthly subsidy would occur in tt not

too distant future. At that time ARTIME was also encouraged

to seek gainful employment. and to encourage anyone who was

receiving money from him to do likewi:

He was also told

‘that the Agency would be willing to assist him in. obtaining
legitimate employment: or to help him in any necessary

training to obtain it.

Since this date ARTIME has continued to receive

. travel rather frequently in Central America and maintains

Bis bome in Miami without any other income.

7.  ARTIME's contribution to the Agency's operational
effort against Cuba in the past year has been negligible.
WH/Cuba feels that continued payment of the $3,000 subsidy
is net warranted and can no ionger be justizied, in view
of the present budgeta:y limitation on Cuban operations it
gan well be utilized for more significant and hopefully .
more productive activities.

8. It is not believed that termination of the
remaining subsidy vould require 303 Committee concurrence
but you may wish to discuss this verbally with the DDP
who is familiar with the AMWORLD operation. If approval

is granted to terninate the subsidy without 303 Committee
approval, we would plan to advise the Coordinator of
Cuban Affairs for Department of State, Mr. Robert
Stevenson, and Mr. William Bowdler, Staff Member, National
Security Council (White House assistant), before notifying
ARTIME, This is considered necessary since ARTIME is
likely to try to use Mr. Bowdler or the CCA to press

CIA not to terminate the subsidy. Your approval is
requested to terminate the $3,000 monthly subsidy to

ARTINE effective 31 Deceaber i966.

22 Cetoher 1966

Dear Jin:

Just a few lines to inform you of ny trip through Latin
America:

The meeting with SOOZA was at "Las ‘tinas", where a public
celebration of the Liberal Party vas being held, It was on

4 October 1966, We talked stout the possibility that he would
o down in History by foriing a revolutionary government,
onest, with an indisputatie socin!-planning, [ told him

that he did not need money nor power, only international pres-
tige, that he would only acquire that international prestige
by, giving a moral slap in the face to those in the interna
tional field who were trying to insinuate that he was just

one more dictator, lie cormented favorably on everything that
I told him, We talked about the mecting of Presidents and

of the possibility that the subject of CUBA would be discussed
in private, in secret conference.

In Nicaragua I.also received Amado ALVAREZ Torno, whose re=
port I sent with Carl, Since returning to “iami I have rew
ceived a message from ALVAREZ Torno, in code, using a booklet
that he-gave me as key to the code, but honestly, I have

not been able to unscranble or decode what he says, At any
rate, I already wrote to him:teiling hin to cxplain the code
to me clearly, I am sending you the nessage received, with
the booklet that serves as a key, to see if you understand it.

I also made contact with the "Chess Player" who is going to
Cuba and whom you can use.

I arrived in Costa Rica on 7 Getoher 1966 in the early morn-
ing, by eutomohile, I stayed et the home of Juan NUMEZ Madriz,
Preecne Secretary for Organization of the National Liberation

arty, In that house I obtained the papers that I am sending
you, or the table of organization of the Party,

On 9 October, Pope FIGHERNS cane to Juan's house to visit me

arms for, le told ne, “It's that several Liberation groups
have private arsenals, and ry arsenal is the sparcest.” We
jaughed (surely he was talking about Pepe). lie told me that

On 33 October in the afternoon I was able to see “arcos ROBLES.

COKTE had asked him what would he the position of Panama if
they were to take continent-wide steps in regard to Cuba,
and Marcos had answered that Panana's position was the most

7 aggressive against CASTrO,
I gave “Marcos the report I had on Arnulfo ARIAS and the rrms

in Costa Rica and commented on the necessity that the Pres-
idents of America discuss, in private and secretly, the Cuban
question, ‘farcos ROBLES a ape to be in an openly aggressive
position and told me that he would speak with the Presidents
of El Salvador and Guatemala to see if they were presenting

@ thesis in common on Cuba, He told me that the situation

in Guatemala, if CASTRO survived, would be terrible, since

she wavered between n military coup and a Communist coup,

Marcos told me that the only possible stabilization of Latin
‘America included the assassination of CASTRO,

He thanked me for the reports received and asked me to let
him know anything I might find out,

I arrived in Venezuela on 15 October 1966,

| Edgar LEONI, nephew of the President, was waiting for me at
. the Airport, He told me that he would Leave the following
Sunday for Santo Domingo and then for ‘liami (he is-here now).

He commented to me regarding the Party: There were two clear-
ly marked tendencies:

On 18 Metober I net at 2 in the afternoon with Bafsel CALDERA, :
t

We commented on the position of Chile and of FREI on Fidel
CASTRO and he promised me that in Mecenher, when he goes to
Chile to talk with FREI, he would try to convince hin to
take a more aggressive position against CAST?O, so that he
will be on a level with the Christian Yenocratic farties of
the Caribbean, like his: COPEY, le is very optinistic about
the next elections, I told him what I knew about the posi-
tion of Chile, that she had been very soft against CASTRO

in spite of CASTRO's attacks,

He told me that he was convinced that FREI had spoken with
the Cuban regime about a possible including of Cuba in the
OAS again, but that afterwards FREI had repented; and it
was for that reason that Fidel attacked him so much.

He told me that Enrique NUEPTAS had been to visit him in the

name of "all the exile movement", to invite hin to a cele-

ration in Miami, That the only thing that he was surprised

at was the “extraordinarily anti-Aerican” position of that

boy, I told him that Enrique NUFRTAS was a great guy, but

was very embittered and of course he represented cnly the

doctors in Miani. .

> That same day, at 4 in the afternoon, I'met with GRCOSKC,
Under-Secretary General of the Presidency, in Miraflores,

He spoke to me very bitterly of the 'l, S. and of what they
had done in Santo fomingo, He told me that he had been in
the Dominican 2epublic ‘al! during the time of the “inter-
_ vention", 7

fle told me that Venezuela would adopt a strong position against
CASTRO in the conference of Presidents. That now CASTRO only
benefited the "gorillas" of Argentina and Brazil and for that
reason nothing wes being done against him, CASTRO was the

I states that the initiative asainst CASTEO corresponds to
Latin Arerica, He teld ne that that was in theory, but that
in practice the U, 3, was neccec.

(As can be seen, he is of the sare opinion as PAZ Galarraga.)

I departed conrratulating President LEONI on his position
with respect to the Jananese Covernment in its trade with
Cuba, and‘ asked hin to make our desire of heing strongly
against CASTPN becone a reality.

Ue told me that ‘that same day he would see the President;
he closed the ncetins by saying, “Von't worry, we are now
very tired of Fidel, the other day we had to sink a boat
loaded: with munitions ‘and Castroites," :

That same night I was having drinks with Danile SANSOM, new
Nicaraguan Ambassador to Venezuela, Through hin I found out
some very curious things: there are three ambassadors in
Caracas who receive $5,000.00 a month to hotify the Vene-
zuelan DIGEPOL of all communicaticns in code, “ne of them

is the one from Chile, who passes all the secret correspondence
Beenean CALDERA and FREI into the hands of the .Venezuelan
DIGEPOL, Z

On the following day I had a meeting vith the “José Marti"

Upon my arrival in Miami, on 20 Cctoher, I had a telephone
call from SOPO, in which he told me that his friend Msiel
GONZALEZ, of the Second Front of the Escambr: had a friend

i On 2 Cctober 1966, James 3. ZAHOTH (P) net with AMBIDDY=1

j end the Mexico City representative of the MRR, or. Amaro C,

i ALVAREZ Tormo, wh mailing address is Apartado Postal $3-922,
Mexico 17, D.F. ile works at Udboratorios Promeco de Hexico,

i SeA., Bahia de San Hipolito 51, 4exico, 0.F., Telephone 45<62048,
ané mailing address Apartado 532978, 4exico 17, 0.F.

He Doctor ALVAREZ told the following story: ile is a Cuban |
exile who cane out in August 1360 and has worked since as the
MARR representative in Mexico. iie worked with the FRD in 1960-61
and hav hac contact from tine to time with wexico City Station
officers since that time, itis last contact, #0 far as he knows,
was Andrew r. MERTON (P). iis brother is Doctor Jose Xamon
ALVAREZ Torao, who was cap’ d in Cuba in March 1965 and is
serving nine years in Caba! sison as a countererevolutionery.
ALVAREZ believes his brother was. working as a 4OFACT agent, but .
is not sure, Two other voctors, who are members of his faaily, | .

were captured at about the sane time. They are Doctor Fidencion
SANCHEZ Escoto, serving. thirty years in Cabafias, and Doctor
Adalberto SAAVEDRA Dias, serving twenty years in Principe Prison.

Early in September 1966, ALVARLZ received a telephone call .

from a Doctor (fnu) CAPOTE, a Cuban who is at the Public Health n

Sehool of Mexico on a scholarship from the dorld Health Organiza- t
+ thon. His telephone number in Hexico City is 35-39-64, CAPOTE ‘
-  Zdentified himself as having bean a medical student in Havana

when Dector ALVAREZ was a resident.surgeon at the University

Wespital, and asked if ALVAKEZ remembered him. ALVAREZ told him

that he remeabered him (altiiough he did rot) thinking that CAPOTS
- probably wanted to contact him to make arranyements to defect.
nteeia WAREZ accepted an invitation to have dinner with CAPOTE and
met him the sama evening. They went to a French restaurant with
good food, good wine, and good atmosphere, and CAPOTC paid the
eheck, ALVAREZ saii that when they mat, he vaguely remeabered
‘the’ face of CAPUTE as one of nis former students but could remem-
ber nothing more about him. :

‘ter 4nitial asali talk at dinner, ALVARDZ asked if there :
were anything he coulda do to help CAPOTE to act, as Uoctor
Alarico FERNANDEZ had recently done (another Cuban doctor on a
WHO schotarahip in Mexico). CAPOTE replied that ha wus not ine
terasted in defecting, he was very happy in Cuba, Socialism is
wonderful, eto. He went on to say that he wanted to talk with
ALVAREZ (n an attempt to help him out with a personal matter.

“ CAPOTE said he knew the brother of ALVAREZ and had sone friends
cae whe nd ght help to get him out of prison and out of Cuba. One of.
" the: 1 particular, was coming to Mexico shortly, and when he

Mya next contact was on Thursda

re Sage eg

ALVAREZ read the letter ana put it in his pocket, telling
VALVERDE that this still did not identify him nor dia it tell
him any more about what they wanted from him, VALVERDE said
they wented only to help ALVARIZ and his: relatives and were
trying to make it possible for his te do something tha: could
earn their release. VALVCRDZ then showed him a latter of introe
duction written on Cuban Ministry of the Interior official
stationery and signed by Ramiro VALDEZ, which stated that “Sefor
VALVERDE" was an official of the Ministry who was teavelling
abroad on a special mission and should be assisted by all Cuban
official missions and friendly governments, (ALVAREZ sted that
he left the meeting first, then waited around outside until he
Saw CAPOTE and VALVERDE leave in a car with diplomatic tags,
although he did not get the license nuabers.)

After ALVAREZ read the letter and gave it back, VALVERDE
told him, "Look here now, be sure we can take care of your
brother, but we don't want money, In other canes, okay, we'll
take money because we can always use it, but that's not what we
want. from you." ALVAREZ told him to wait a minute, If he was
threatening his brother unless ALVAREZ gave hin information, he

say no. “I will have the pain of whatever happens to my
brother, but you have the responsibility for it because:he is
ur prisoner. Nothing I ‘can do will control what happens to
ae Only you can control that." He said he would not collaborate
vith them. VALVERDE replied: that. this was similar tu the response
thoy usually pot from the so-called democratic types, but that
ALVAREZ was going too fast and refusing before he knew the situa«
tion. He described ALVAREZ as playing Don Quixote and tilting
at windmills. He said the Cuban situation would ultimately be
@olved onthe international level and the question of which side
will come out on top would be resolved at that point by the big
re and nothing they (VALVERDE and ALVAREZ) did at their .
evel was going to have any.»sal effect on tha outcoss. Therefore,
there was no reason they could not work together on comething that
was in their commen interests and to their mutual advantage.

VALVERDE then said he would be completely frank with ALVAREZ
and told him they knew they had only one rez enamy in the world,
dneluding PBPRIME, and that was WOFACT. ife aaid. ti
WOPACT was no longer interested in exile organizetic:
individual exiles with potential influence for tha fu:
eaid they. knew about the training camps An Central Amorica with
about 200 men, but they were not worried about them, They already -
have infiltrations into them, and if they becone troublesome, the
Cubsns can bring sufficient preseure againat them and have then
@losed down by propayanda from Radio liavana, through looal newsmen,

in indiviseel men, not in zroups., In fact, they were interested
primarily in one man, the only one who might be able to organize
groups 08% on the inside as well as the outside, wno also has

ALVAR2% said he was only a propaganda man who follcwed direce

and had ma direct contact with nor knowledge of ANSIDDY=1
routine oF wevenents. Therefore, he could not pive the
formation wr any value to them, even if he were willing to

okay, that was about what they expected hia first reply to be,
Dut they “nq time to wait for him to think it over, VALVERDE
eaid he conia wait until Saturday, 1 Gectober 1966 for another
meeting (ivom the night of Thursday, 29 September 1966).

CAPOE broke in at this point and said they knew that ALVAREZ

- travels 4 reat deal through Latin America in his businese and

be XA @ position to pick up information that they might be
interestes in, ‘This could perhaps be enough to keep their
attention While he thought over and made up his mind on their offer.
For example, they had a noed for core and better quality information
on Guatemaha, and if he wanted to work on that fora short while,
they mizdt be able to vork cut something with him. VALVERDE inter=
jeoted a comment then that this wae jumping the gun and might get
them off Gi) something far away from Cuba, AMBIDDY=1 and the
Pelatives Qf ALVAREZ, which were the sain considerations. He
suggested again hat they wisep on it and they could talk again.
Be sald 4% ALVAREZ agreed to cooperate with them, he would put
hiv in tewch with one of nie friends who was staying in Mexico,
and they: ould take care of the details at that end, while he,
VALVERDE, ‘was taking care of the necessary approvale and overall
SaMORtS Hack in Cuba, te which he te return in a few days.
ALVAREZ -@i%4a he had no objection to. meeting and talking again, but
he was suia ha would not be changing nis mind. VALVERDE said again
that wag ah) right and that they could wait,

AREZ left the meciing and triad to contact AMBIDDY<1

Before leaving, on Friday night, he called CAPITE and told hia,
truthfully, that a s: ‘er vas going to visit tne next day and
Sunday, ana he and his wife were going to be tied up all weekend
taking her sightseeing, inoluding being out of the city Saturday
night. ile would be back to work, however, on Monday morning,
and if they wanted to talk again he was willing, although he
Warned them he had not changed his mind at that ‘point. CAPOTE
Seid Honday was fine and he would contact ALVAREZ to make an
appointnent.

After discussing the matter with AMBIDDY<1, they decided that
ALVAREZ would fo back to Mexico on Sunday, 2 Oatober 1966, and
make the seating on Monday when they contact him, ‘ie would con
tinue to claim he could ive nothing useful about AMBIDDYe4
and vould net do so in any event, but micht nibble at the cuate-
mala proposition in return for promises of better treataent for

“his brother. If WOFACT wishes to monitor this operation, they

may contact ALVAREZ in Mexico City as “a friend of Carlos with a
message from him." AMBIDDY=1 directed ALVAREZ to cooperate within
Beason with the WOFACT contact if one were madi uch aa reporting
events, passing deception material, Coy SO Ong as it was. under=
Stood that control of the operation will not be turned aver,

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT: Conversation with Manuel Artime, If; September 1966

1. The writer had a one-hour conversation with Manuel
Artime on 10 September 1966 during which Artime recounted
what he purported to be the highlights of a conversation
he had with Mr. William Bowdler at Bowdler's Waite House
office on the afternoon of 9 September.

2,  Artime said he was told by Mr. Bowdler that he
should realize that his appointment with him, inasmuch as
being held in his White House office, had been
with and had the approval of the President. He said
ethene said he wanted to make two points complotely clear

im.

a. There was no present plan or projected
planning by the U.8. for military action against

b. There was @ possibility that the U.S,
Government might re-examine the Cuban situation
in the next few months and that he was interested
in getting Artime's views on. the present situation
as well as comments and/or suggestions covering
the future,

E 3.  Artime said he told Bowdler that the morale of the
Cuban exiles and of the people in Cube was at its lowest ebb.
He said not alonc castro's opponents but Castro himealf .

his own sources knew that the oniy significant
activity beiag conducted against his regime at the present
time was propaganda radio broadcasts beamad into the island
and these were having no effect on the stability of tne
Castro regime. The people in Crna and.opposed to Castro
are now living in a complete state ci apasty. because they
gee no hope that anything will be done tc free them from
Communism. Hl

ae

4. Artime said he volunteered his services: as a
military man in any capacity in which he could possibly
serve, He said he spoke in terms of hit-and-run and
sabotage raids at several simultaneous points on the
island the purpose of which would be to:

a. Raise the morale and internal
resistance spirit of the people on the
island. o

bd. Lead to further economic difficulties
by forcing the government to. recall to active
military service, to man coastal defenses, etc.
military and militia types now working on sugar,
other agricuitural and industrial production.

Cc. Force Castro to maintain his military
estabJishments in a constant state of alert
thereby creating further financial problems as
well as possible morale problems within the

. military establishment.

He emphasized that these "raids" could be done without
increasing the budget or taxes. They could be carried
out by Cubans using equipment and material presently
available to the U.S. Government.
’
S. He said Bowdler asked him for his suggestions as 7
to what could be done in the way of military action aginst |
: Cuba and he replied that the U.S, Government with its auge-
SS EE military establishment and experience was much better
i ‘+ qualified than he to make suggestions.

6. Other topics covered were Castro's verbal attacks
. against President Frei of Chile and the Alliance for Progress.

“} a. Artime said he told Bowdler he was of course very

His concerned about future planning--if any--concerning Cuba as

he had a wife and family to support and should really

seriously reorganize and reorient his nersonal life if

there were no prespects o7 some action in the futurs anc of

his participation therein. He said Bowdler asked him if he

would have some idea within the next one-tao months whether *
thore was going to be a re-examination of the U.S. position ’
and policy towards Cuba and that he would let Artime know t
&@¢ soon as he Rad any information, Bowdler took Artine's :
phone number and address in Miami and gave Artime his office

July 23, 1966

Dear Jin:

I pass the following information to you: 1. Colonel a
SANCHEZ, General “anager of Lanica Airlines, has received a if
notice from the Compaifa Cubana de Aviaci6n, of which I am id
enclosing photos.atic copies, and according to Colonel SANCHEZ “
this is extremely serious, since this not only represents a :
Dill of $1,496.00 dollars which will go into the hands of j
CASTRO, but all the Latin American aviation companies will i
bate to pay & similar bill monthly, which dollars will go to H

uba.

Colonel SANCHEZ says that. the seriousness of the problem
does not stop there, It is the opinien of the Latin American
airlines that Cubana de Aviaci6n will send each one of these
lines a bill for everything they have not paid since CASTRO
took power. It is to be noted that no company has paid this

. and that some, like Lanica Airlines, have changed their routes

a $0 as not to pass over Cuba.’ Colonel SANCHEZ says that if
Fidel collects this belated bill, it will mean about a million
dollars for nim,

2, According to conversations held with General MONTIEL,
the last three cases of Nicaraguan persons who were trained
in Russia and have re-entered Nicaragua have done so using the

_Youte: Socialist Bloc - Cuba - Mexico - Miami - country of
‘origin, The united States visas were obtained in Mexirs and-
they were transit visas, This can throw the Latin American

authorities off, since nc one expects that from Miami could

= come anyone coming from Russia.

The last one captured in Nicaragua (Carl can tell you), on
ng interrogated as to why he had gone up to the U. 8. from

lexico and then to El Salvador and Managua, answered that he

. had received orders to do so.

B | o Tt must be taken into account that on passing through the

United States with a transit visa these men can give out orders
end watchwords,

3. The two Nicaraguans with whom I have spoken about
possibly working for our cause, putting the preblem to then
as something coupietely Cuban, were: RaGl PALACIO, law student
at the Centra: American University. of Managua, intelligent,
good speaker, ccurageous, has participated in demonstrations
against the Government of the SOMOZAs, and is a nephew of
Ly pty MOLINA, who supports him financially and pays for his
. schooling. MOLINA is weil known as an anti-American, although
' = dn. the background he gets along with the United States Ambas~

a | gader to Nicaragua, Raft PALACIO told me that he had to think



visited him.once a week,

it over carefully, since this could mean the loss of one year
in his career.

Against this position (of his career), I spoke to him about

tre possibility of becoming a great leader of the Nicaraguan
Youth and about possible training abroad in the pelitical,
economic, or social field, whichever he would like most.

Th: other Nicaraguan from whom I received a message was Gustavo
JARQUIN, He is a half-brother of Leticia JARQUIN, who works
with me ptf have the same father but not the sane mother).

He sent me the message through a brother of Leticia whose name
is Adin, who also lives in Andaime, Nicaragua. The nessage
was the following: that he wanted to talk to me about some
very interesting things which would benefit me and Cuba.

This man was in Cuba for training, and, it seems, in Russia.

A militant Communist, it seems that he has had financial dif-
ficulties, which the Party has not helped him out of.

Carl is investigating him before I speak with him.

4, Tam attaching a machine copy of the letter. which
Enrique TOUS sent to Manuel GUILLOT, in which he tells about
the matter of Blas ROCA y Marinello. - ~

S$. I am attaching a photostatic copy of a letter received
Jos& GONZALEZ Puig, which gives a good explanation of the
situation in Cuba. -

6, A package was sent from Managua to Cuba, via Mexico,
in which were: one pair of tennis shoes, two undershirts,
two undershorts, four pairs of stockings, two ladies’ brassieres, ©.
two ladies' panties, three bottles of medicine.

We'll see if they receive it in Cuba and when. 5
On Thursday, July 21, Mr. Elo VALOIVIA Sorf, who worked for
a long time in the M.R.R. in Cuba, arrived on one of the flights
to freedon, :

issued stamps, to use them in philatelic negotiations. When
the stamp is no longer printed they iet the letters througi.
3. Lucio MONTALVO and Marfa Teresa MONTALVO, who asked to. leave”

> Guba and are about to arrive in the United States, are agents

of CASTRO's G-2, They live in Marianao, Calle 124 and Avenida

~_, 49, across from Police Station No, 17,

4. In an interview that Elo VALDIVIA Sorf had during a visit zs
thet they allowed him with Jes@s GONZALEZ Burgués, who is a
risonor at the "Jaruco No. 1" rehabilitation farm, he informed
im that when he was a prisoner at La Cabafia (about three
months ago) he learned that Hubert MATOS was at La Cabafia, that
they gave him special preferential treatment, and that Fidel



Juan ALSINA Navarro was also a prisoner at La Cabafia, while
CUBELAS was only ‘detained at his residence, and about GALLARRETA
nobody knew anything.

5S. Elo VALDIVIA Sorf had contacts with Alfredo ALBUERNE, an
electro-mechanical engineer and technician who works at the
Cuenca Sur (South Basin) in Havana, in the supplying of water
to the Capital, This man spoke critically of a relative who.
had gone to the United: States and who in his opinion was an
agent of Fidel CASTRO. This relative who left had been a ser-
geant in the Marina de Guerra (Navy) in Cuba in BATISTA's

time, Everything seems to coincide with the description of

the ALBUERNE who was a prisoner in the Zen6n Viera Base in
Nicaragua,

The engineer Alfredo ALBUERNE is against the Communist regime,
and although he wants to leave Cuba he is watched carefully .
because for the moment the Government docs not have a replaces
ae Fad him in the work that he does in the Cuenca Sur (South
Basin).

He (Elo VALDIVIA Sorf) had contact with Luis VALDIVIA Delgado,
a youth who was won over by the Cumpulsory Military Service

and who now works as-an electronics technician in. the Microwave
Station on the Staff of the Armed Forces.

We (Elo VALDIVIA Sorf) had contact with Lizaro FERNANDEZ (he

- ds not very sure of the last name), a youth who works for the

honk Security Service in one of the main offices in “old

vana", a :

He (Elo VALDIVIA Sori). brought in the information that: Vicente
LOPEZ, who lives at Avenida-35 No. 11613, in Apartment 11, in
Marianao, although he pretends to be an inspector in the I.C.A.I.
me is dissatisfied with the Communist Government, is in reality
a.Ge2 agent. .
Also that Fidel CASTRO is in the habit of going évery day to

the Laguito (translator's note: “laguito" means “little lake",
but in this context it could be a bar, restaurant, or club of
some kind) at the Country Club to visit LLANUSA.

Also that after 3:00 in the afternsia, Fidel CASTRO usually.
takes the following route: Calzada (avenue or drive). de Columbia
as far as Avenida 35, and then he continues on Avenida 35 as

far as La Plays (the Beach} ~~ F :

Also that he (Fidel CASTRO) does not usually have a set schedule;
he goes at 3:00, or at 4:00, or at 5:00, or at 6:00 in the
aftcrnoon, :
I told Elo VALDIVIA Sor{ to get in touch immediately with his -
friends in the interior and tell them to write simple letters

to the New York address if they are in agreement to do something .

in Nicaragua I left in a safe in Managua because I was thinking
of the possibility that it might occur to some feverish mind

to check me out upon my arrival in Miami and find that list,
which, except to you, would be very difficult for me to explain,
In effect, when I arrived in Miami, and after passing through
the formalities of Immigration and Customs, two courteous ine
vestigators, one from the Department of Customs and the other
from the Burcu of Narcotics, invited me very delicately to

go into their office to talk with them. There they searched
Be, and with the greatest courtesy in the world they asked me
the stupidest questions that could be asked of anyone, one of
which was: if Captain LONGBOTTOM and Fric JIMENEZ belonged to
the C.I.A, I. don't know whether or not they thought the C.I.A.
and I were waging a private war agdinst CASTRO, or if they
thought the C.l,A. and I were involved in narcotics smuggling.
The search they made of me was rather. ineffective, since I my-
self opened the secret compartment of my briefcase for them

go that they could see that if I had wanted to smuggle something
I would have done so, but nevertheless I had not done so,
Anyhow, I am going to present my complaints to the Department
of State in Miami, and I shall write a letter to the President
of the United States of America, because I helieve that the
least one can do for a friend is.to treat him with consideration,
or at least not subject him to any annoyance, If they had. some
doubt about me, I think that there would have been ways much
more courteous and above all less disagreeable to resolve then.
IT want to make it clear that the conduct of these agents was

at all times courteous, And it all ended in pleasant chatter
in which I even offered to collaborate with them in everything.
which might pertein to their offices, except in that which
wight harm the cause of the liberation of t b. I made it very
clear that I was not working as an agent of any agency or de-
partment of the United States, and that anytime I learn some-
thing that might harm the United States or something that has
to do with international Communism, I would notify old friends
I have within certain departments of the United States Govern-
ment.

9. I have opportunities to work for an import-export com-
pany, and us a salesman in Centrai America for a metailurgical
company. I heave decided that the best work for me is in making
use of my public relations and of my cluse ties with the Cen-
tral American Governments,

Besides, this would permit me to continue travelling through-
out Centrel Averica, to maintain my contacts, and to be useful
to my Country and to Democracy,

If there were some possibility of being a salesman or manager
of a company which is devoloping economic activities in Central
America and hid bay tebe 6 in Nicaragua, I would appreciate very
much this type of work, That is if Customs, Immigration, Bor-
der Patrol, etc,, etc., atc,, don't begin to get in my way. I

think that the only thing to worry about in ny case is that
one day I may be assassinated by international Comsunism, I
believe that I have been known for seven years now, and I have

not failed, not before the agents of the Cuban Communist G-2, -
nor before the very real possibility of the Firing squad.

10, I have received a message from General Fulgencio
BATISTA y Zaldivar through Orlando PIEDRA, that he. has. requested
an interview with me, I think that the. best way to learn his
plans is to speak with Orlando PIEDRA, and I have accepted,
in principle, the interview, in a place, on a day, and at a
time that I specify, !f it is possible I will get a recorder,
and if not, I will inform on the results of the effort.

With nothing more at the moment, your humble servant very at-

C@ cuban Service Charges Against LANICA Airline
TTR RED COROT

ACTION: For Headquarters information, or action if

deemed appropriate,

1. On 20 July 1956, AMBIDDY-1 gave James D. ZABOTH a
copy of a letter to LANICA (Nicaraguan national airline)
from Empresa Consolidada Cubana ce Aviacion, containing a
pill for USS1,496.00 as radio service charges. Z2A30TH made
a copy of the letter and bill, which are attached herewith,
AMBIDDY-1 said he was given his copy of the letter by Col,
Herberto SANCHEZ, President of LANICA.

2. According to AMBIDDY-1, Col. SANCHEZ said that
every Latin American airline which overflies Cuba, or us:
Rancho Boyeros radio as a check point, is going to be billed
retroactively for these services. LANICA's bill is relatively’ ~~
low because their flights dog-leg around Cuba, but some of
the other airlines are going to have rather high bills. Col.
SANCHEZ estimated that the charges against Latin American aire
lines would total almost one million U.S. dollars.

3. Col. SANCHEZ considered this information. significant
and asked AMBIDDY-1 if he could get it into the right hands.
“ZABOTH has requested that AMBIDDY-1 deliver his copy of the

and this report is forwarded only as a follow-up.

Dear Jin: : : :

¥ wish to conmunicate the following:

I. The magazine “Tridente” will continue to be published

once a month with as many sacrifices as may be necessary, |

Brera because it hurts me to see the way the Batistians have

gotten hold of public opinion, trying to knit an

aaron emtoaren ie”
‘

anti-american atmosphere and giving the impression in
their transmissions to Cuba that all those in exile think
the- same way they do, I believe this greately harus any
internal conspiracy which may exist in Cuba.

2. In ay next letter I will send you my complete form.
+ I received a long distance telephone call from Juan Nufiez,

Costa Rica. He told me that Daniel Oduber wanted to speak
. with me as soon as pos#ible beceuse he had important things.
to propose to me. ard that what he was going to propose
would benefit me, :
4. Radio Havana. continued to attack me unmercifully, It says.
that I have 8,000 volunteers in Nicaragua. .
S./ From an infiltration which I have in the Miami. Police
(Dade county), it seems that they knew where Magsferrer had
the lot of 200 weapons: and when they went to capture .
a high official (possibly Major Hili) told them that he
had received the order not to touch those weapons from the
CIA, b



6.

Mafsferrer has mentioned anong .his nen that those
weapons werc given to him by the CIA, The name of the
Source of the information was omitted (of the policeman)
for his protection, since he is sure that it may harm hia.
The source is reliable. 7

I was able to establish contact with ay parents through
By cousin, but still know nothing of the contact requested
by me to be made within Cuba. My parents expect to make
an attempt in obtaining asylum at the Mexican Embassy

in Cuba.

I am sending you a resumé of Rene Cancio, who wishes to
join the Navy of the United. States to go to Viet-Nam

to fight, since he is unable to do anything in ‘Cuba for
the time being. He is our Chief of Naval Operations and
I consider him a great man. He worked with your company
for a long time, : i

On 28 June I had an ‘interview with Enrique Huertas, ‘ho
tried to convince me to join a group of personalities

ow =
tot public scandal fee President Johnson at tho

: ‘White House. He thinks that the homage which he himself

‘has prepared for Te July at the Cuban Medical Association,
where a group of personalitics hava isn invited couid

be the beginning of a scandal of international magnitude
(something like a hunger strike in front of the White House
in Washington). Jchnson will find himself obliged to do
something of the Cuban problem because the opposition would
je this in their platform,



He says that E

ard Kennedy told hin that the Cuban problea
had been definitely sheived by President Johnson, 1 told

hia that in my opinion the Cuban. Problem was in a "freezer" ‘
but. not definitely closed, and that there were other ways

to solve this problem; that in my opinion a Texan may yield -
with good manners (President Johnson) but not by force. i :
That my opinion was that if we resort. to violence, the i
reaction would be anti-productive. That I was of the _e
impression that they were conspiring against the North i =
American Government in the interior of cuba, and that this. i

I had learned from sources in Cuba. That a violent al 7

manifestation against the America Government could destroy
all active subversive plans because the Cuban Soldiers who
were conspiring would lose their faith in the American
Government, Huertas is very hurt due to the culmination
of the Batistians, In my opinion it is because they have

cut a budget which he had. But if all those who have their
budgets cut were to react that way it would be because
they were badly chosen for the position they hold.

One works fcr principles or for money,

I leave fe. Mearagua and from there will report what

O Batista Propagands Activities in the Miani Arca
‘xToe mgm 7

wariROctS
See paragraph 3 below

In recent conversations with AMBIDDY/1 at. Head-
» he expressed concern over the extent of former
nt Fulgencio Batista's publicity/propaganda activities
in the Miami area end the effect aad influence these activities
re having on the large Cuban exile community. According to
AMBIDDY/1, the most effective propaganda mediums in th Miaat
area are directed, controlled and financed by Bati:

interests and are designed to rebuild Ratista's amage. He
mentioned specifically Patria which is financed by Batista,
published once weekly a wide free distribution. In
Addition, reference was made to radio station WMIA which
AMBIDDY/1 claimed was the principal station which broadcast
Batista propaganda programs. AMBIDDY/) commented that the
Batista propaganda was having an effect on the exiles aad,

as he put it, if it continues at its present rate, the exites

in Miami will consider Batista a "saint" in comparison to ~
Fidel Castro.

2. Headquarters fully recognizes JMWAVE's feelings
regarding AMBIDDY/1 and the fact that he is anything but an
unbiased observer.-- In- fairness, however, it should be pointed
out that he did not couple the above observations with a

piteh for approval or financ to conduct propaganda activities
to counteract Batis:

3. Yor the record, Headquarters is not particularly.
interested in se@ing Batista's image rebuilt amongst the exiles.
Although it is realized that the Station normally would not

ve interested in Batista's activities, it would be ayprectated
af the Station would forward whatever information is avail-
able concerning pro-Bdtista propaganda in the Miami area.and,

42 possible, an assessment as to the extent of its influence
on the exile community.

D.C., 22-23 June 1966 —

1, AMBIDDY/1 was requested to travel from Miami to
" washington, DB.c., in a phone call to his residence in
Miami on 20 tune, He arrived in D.C. on the afternoon of
22 June. We met in his hotel room at the Manger Hay-Adams
Hotel the evening of 22 June and later had dinner together.
A round-up meeting was held at noon time ca 23 June after
which AMBIDDY/1 left for New York City on what he termed
“personal business."

;
i

2. The principal reason for bringing AMBIDDY/1 to
Washington was to check out with him what equipment--
including arms and ammunition--remained from the AMWORLD
activity here in the States, what it consisted of, where it
was stored and whether or not any of the equipment had been
disposed of recently or whether there had been any recent
inquiries made to purchase any of the equipment (this inquiry
‘was prompted by JMWAVE 1479). These. points were taken. up
early in the meeting.

3. AMBIDDY/1 said the only equipment rewaining from. .
the AMWORLD activity in the U.S. is stored in a small closet
@ farm near West Palm Beach, Florida.. As near as AMBIDDY/1
cee J, gould recall, there are 2-3 rubber boats and 6-8 silent out- i
7 - beard moturs stored at the farm - nothing else. In addition :
: > hig rep, SAENZ, has 6-8 radios at his home in Miami. | AMBIDDY/1 i
~ | @aid he had no arms or ammunition either from AMWGRLD or H
7 personally stored in tne U.S. He has one personal sub-machine
@une in. hia home. To his knowledge there are no sizable
amounts: of exile arms or asmunition in the Miami area, either
in storage or available for sate. He claimed thet during
the Guantanamo alert ne checked to see how many arms he could
locate in the Miami area if needed and could locate only
about 60 rifles from amongst the various exile groups.



4. AMBIDDY/1 was also queried regarding Bob brown, the
Panther Publications writer reported in JMWAVE 1479, and
whether or not Brown's activities had come to his attention
in Miami or whether Brown had approached him or any of his
representatives to purchase or ask questions about the
purchase of arms. AMBIDDY/1's answer was negative. He

Said he did not know Brown and he had never come to his
attention. .

5. AMBIDDY/1 was asked on his rsturn to Miami to
compile an inventory of the remainder of the AMWORLD equip-
ment in the U.S. He has promised to do this and send the
inventory to me.

Miami, 28 June 1966
Dear Jim,

Herewith my report on the subjects we discussed:

1. With respect te parcels to Cuba: - :

Fras the 0S you can only send medicines, I have the recent case of
JoS6 Gonsflex Puig. He mailed a package of medicines which contained anti-
Bioties, vitamins, and trenquilisers, and it took month to arrive in Cabs,
Dut all of it reached the relative it was addressed to.

From Rivaregua I have a package containing 2 pair drawers, 2 undershirts,
2 pair xk socks, and cne pair cheap shoes, I shall take it to Nicaragua
@s soon ss I can and fron there 1°11 send by way of Mexico.
2. The letter via Spain asiing Alba to write with invisible ink has alresdy
left. Fe i
3. With respect to the report on arns in Miami, I heve confirmed that only
emall quantifies are in the hands of action groups such ap Slo Frente-Alpha 66,
Conandos L, and “_pinos @nuavos” (new pines). :

Tn Miami, only Masferrer has them in sisable quantitiess ‘this is what

" Bagento Claude, our security agents hepor?s +

Yesterday Rolexdo Masferrer shaved up at a house in Miami, together with
‘thro American newamen,. one of then a photographer, In the house he had about

200 firearms, ‘These weapons were taken cut, Masferrer men who had their
* guces covered, watie the photographer tock pi~-ties mf of the weapons transfer,

‘This was told to Eugenio Claude by Carballosa, who brags about being a friend
of Masferrer, He said it in response to a provocstive remark by'Zugenio Claude
to the effect thet the Batista people spent a lct of monay on prersganda

and none on weapons, and that they were good at talking arly.

and although they may not be a decisive fuantar factor with regard to the
Liberetion of Cube, eS
and will becone @ large segnent of Cuban publie opinion.

If to this we add that many of those “fired” or whose buigets were cut
are out in the strect denonstreting an anti-US attitude (sone sre saying that
the US is carrying out for Fidel the main condition he set for an agrecaent
with the US: daing avay with the organisations in Miami), ve cen see how tragic
is the situation in exile public opinion. The pro-Batista People sre
trying to inply that Batista has never cut his friends dam economically,
whereas the Americans are often doing it. (Actually what Batiste gives,
except fore. fou, 1s a pm pittanre, but he will keep it unchanged if the
Tecipleyt cf the monay is loyal to hin.)

For this reason, uhm even if Tridente disappears, I shall try to encourége
Herman Dias and Strelogut to get out # weekly which will the street from
the hands of Petria and the Bitista propaganda.

said be bas no further tunde to pay Arrixzurieta acd noo that
faniel GUisz is no longer 1a power “srizurieta ouviously
bar. no official eatree to the present government.

4. AMBIDDY-2 at the writer's request rechecked with a
Arrizurieta rege-ding bis suurces of information in Costa -
Rica and specifically bis unidentified venetration af the
Communist Party noted in parayraph 3 of reference B. ANBIDDY=1
thea reported that Arrizurieta bad the following. four principal
sources of information in Costa Rica with whom be had
maintained direct contact.

Walter Vasquez ~ infiltrated in the Pree Costs
Rican movement

done Lnis Cascante ~ Student ~ infiltrated into
pedir Section of the Communist

Rigo Maria — farser — chauffour — infiltrated into
farm section of the CP

Jose Gamboa = “Chepe” = worker in Puerte Limon —
infiltrated into the CP in Puerto Linon
and Atlantic coast

58. According to ANBIDDY.1, Jose Gamboa was the
original source of the infc-mition contained in paragraph
3 A. of. reference B. However the information cane to :
Arrizarieta from an unnamed Captain in the Guardia Fiscal who.
Works in Puerto Limon. In other vords the assumption is that
dese Gaabca passed the information to the Guardia Fiscal *
Captain te carry to Arrizuricta in San Jose. ”

6. AMBIDDY=1 also reconfirmed that his access to
iaformation on the PLN was through Arrizurieta (reference. D).
which with Arrizsurieta's departure from Costa Rica will
Bo longer be available. AMBIDDY-1 professes to be a personal
friend of Roberto Hadriz, Secretary to the former president
@f Costa Rica and of Guillerno who is connected with
the Instituto Nacional de Viviends Urbana (IHVU), Costa Rican
Housing Agency. He eaid that the former will conti~is
to afford him accezz to activities of the so-called URLICE.
QOUBER group and the latter is his contact in the Figueres~
Tease group.

Y. AMBIDDY.1 wax told during these tyo meetine that
WUBARK had no interest in his maintaining any “intelligence
@overage"” in Central or fouth America and could not make
any funds available to him to support such activities... For
the information of addressees AMBITDY/1 has been receiving
@ monthly payment of $5,000 from KUBGRK since October 1965.
This money was allegedly being used support for dependents
nd esebers of AMWORID, This sum is being cut back. to $3,000

" monthly effective 1 June 1966 and will gradually be cut
Back further in the futume until eliminated: With this Ices
ef funds AMBIDDY/1 will obviously have to reduce bis travels
and other activities in Latin dmsrica.

SUBJECT: AMBIDOY-1 Finacial Agreenent

ait.

1, During the course of the seeting with AMBIDDY-1. .
in Miami on 3-4 May, we went. over in considerable detail
the disposition that he is making of the $3,000 monthly
payment which he has been receiviag from the Agency since
late 1965. As AMBIDDY-1 has indicated in his accounting . :
Gtatenents, he claimed that $2,000 of this money was being 7
@ent to Spain where it was forwarded by diplomatic pouch
= to Jaime Caldev:lla, the Spanish officer stationed in the
- @panieh Embassy in Havana. He said Caldeville, in turn,
turned this money over to Emilio Luzarraja, who distrizutes
&¢ to various people inside Cuba who either had relative:
: Smprieoned for anti-Castro activities or had been executed. i
The final recipients of the money who allegedly received it fron t
‘ | Bailio Luzarraja were not identified by AMBIDDY-1,

. 2. In relation toa the balance of the $5,060 ©aich . '
+ @mounts to $3,069, ANBIDDY-1 furnished a breakdown of t
~\ Sadiviguale who. he claias receive the money in Florida,

and arn forward it to specific individuals or families 7 on
+ &mmid@ Cuba. A copy of this breakdown is attached. ot

: 3. AMBIDDY-1 was told on 4 May that effective ) June
. 1 the “stipends to persons inside Cuba who vere alledgedly
lL xeceiving it via the Spanish Exbassy and Lusarraja would be
““terminstec,and that effective with his June payment the amount . “I %.
would be cut from 85,000 to $3,000. ef
