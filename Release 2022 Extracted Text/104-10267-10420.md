SUBJECT: Meeting with,LITAMII~9; 1 April 1968

eecee

4, <E-Ssreported as follows:

46/E-Ttumned over the FALCO-CALVET Detter to MIRABAL,
MIRABAL seemed to feel he had a hot potato on his hands, was very un
confortable and even a bit scared and said, “I'll have to discuss

this with the Axbassador.* (L-9) notes that MIRASAL is cowardly,
timorous, not at all like his predecessor AZCUS who was the epitone

of self confidence and control. (I-9\finds this interesting since AZCUE
was not a Communist and MIRABAL 4s — the Coxunist is really the
weakling in spite of all the strength that supposedly cones from
Ynowing that Marxism-Leninism is right.)
