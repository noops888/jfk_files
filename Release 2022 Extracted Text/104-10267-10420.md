4. 5L 9)roported as follows:

Joj'In9 turned over the RACOcAlvaTi, letter to MIRABAL.

MIRABAl, seenad to feal he had a hot potato on his hands, was vory un

confortable and even a bit scared and sald, "I'll have to discuss

this with the Ambassador. " (LI) notes that MIRABAL 1s coardly,

timorous, not at all like his prodocessos AZCUS who was the epitomo

of self confidence and control. (L9flads this interesting since ACUE

was not a Cormunist and MIRABLI 13 - the Carunist 1s really the

weakling in spite of all the strength that supposedly comes from

knowing that Hards-Leninism 1s right.)
