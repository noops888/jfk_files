Subject : Rockefeller Commission files information
To zs Steve Katz, Senate Committee on Government Affairs

Enclosed are the finding aid to the Rockefeller Commission files
we have processed, copies of all the withdrawal sheets, and some
explanatory information.

About the withdrawal sheets: When we remove a classified
document from a folder we record more information for
administrative purposes than you find on these withdrawal sheets.
The data put into such fields as creator's agency, classifying
agency, classification level, comments, and special markings are
not printed on this short form that researchers see. Our
computer program was designed to produce these abbreviated public
descriptions because some agencies, chiefly the CIA, do not want
to be public identified as the originator of specific documents.
We have made the withdrawal sheets for the Rockefeller Commission
items we have processed more explicit than normal practice
because the Church Committee published the gist of most of these
documents in 1975, identifying the CIA connection. But, because
of the software limitations, the computer cannot print the
“agency" data on the short form.

I think there is enough information for you to deduce the
originating agency for most of these documents. Most of them
were supplied to the Rockefeller Commission by the CIA, although
many of them are of interagency origin. If you have questions
about particular sheets, please don't hesitate to call me.

We may find that some, perhaps many, of these documents have
already been declassified, but rather than take the time to
research all of them and delay “opening" the collection, we
simply "pink sheeted" everything and will wait to see what
happens with the proposed review commission. If they are not
systematically declassified, we will research them individually
as they are requested under mandatory review.

2 Sept 1994 - Meeting with Steve Tilley, NARA

Recommended that we begin with the Ford Library. The
Rockefeller Commission holdings are there and they contain
most, if not all, assassination related records that are at
the Johnson and Kennedy Libraries.

12 Sept 1994 - phone conversation with Lessa Tobin (Ford)

They have screened the Rockefeller Commission material
and identified JFK assassination records. They have 1400
items in their data base and 6-7 feet of material to be
reviewed. They estimate that 80% of the records contain CIA
equities.

They would welcome reviewers this Fall (the sooner the
better since Ms. Tobin is going on maternity leave in
January) . ‘

13 Sept 1994 - Meeting with C/HRG.

Briefed him on my phone call. The Ford Library is not
a one man job. 6-7 feet of material translates into 13-
15,000 pages. It could take 2-3 people a week or more to
complete an initial review and would probably have to send
material back to HRG for review and coordination. Told him
I plan request a list of the 1400 items in the data base and
needed to discuss specific procedures (handling documents
copying, redaction, etc.) with Karen Holzhausen. She is on
leave this week. He suggested mid October as a possible
date for trip.

14 Sept 1994 - phone call with Lessa Tobin

She confirmed size of file -- approximately 13-15,000
pages (does not have a specific page count -- using same
rule as HRG, 2200 pages per foot). The 1400 items are the
number of Iden Aids prepared for NARA. She will senq@me a
complete set. .

ORMATION

Washington, D.C. 20505

Dear Mr. Harrelson:

T-am sending out to you today by registered mail the document
identification forms for all of the Kennedy assassination materials
identified in the Ford Library whose status was recorded as "postponed".
This includes forms for about 1,000 items. This package does not
include identification forms for the 400 items whose status is "opened".
Also enclosed is a list explaining the shorthand collection titles we used’
on the identification forms.

Karen Holzhausen and I produced forms for all of the materials we
identified, including all duplicates. In some cases there were two, three
or four copies of the same document located in different files. We’ve
developed a system to keep track of those duplicates which we can
explain to your people when they arrive.

Karen and I are very much looking forward to your visit this fall but we
have lots of questions about how the process will work. Will you know
which items have already been declassified elsewhere? Will you be able
to recognize and act on non-CIA originated documents which have been
acted on at other repositories? Will you have to see the originals of each
item which are scattered throughout our vault collections, or can you just
examine the copy set we created during the identification process? Is
there anything we could be doing to help prepare for your visit? Will
there be follow-up work for us to do after you leave?

Finally, to help you with your planning, I enclose our transportation and
accommodations handout and, for your, information, a copy of the
finding aid to the Rockefeller Commission Files and a guide to the
Library’s complete holdings. We look forward to hearing from you after
you assess what kind of a job we have waiting for you here!

U.S. PRESIDENT’S COMMISSION ON CIA ACTIVITIES
WITHIN THE UNITED STATES: FILES RELATED TO THE
ASSASSINATION OF PRESIDENT JOHN F. KENNEDY

INTRODUCTION

President Gerald R. Ford created the Commission on CIA Activities within the
United States on January 4, 1975. He directed the Commission to determine
whether or not any domestic CIA activities exceeded the Agency’s statutory
authority and to make appropriate recommendations. He appointed Vice President
Nelson A. Rockefeller chairman of the Commission. (The Commission is often
referred to as the "Rockefeller Commission.") Other members were John T.
Connor, C. Douglas Dillon, Erwin N. Griswold, Lane Kirkland, Lyman L.
Lemnitzer, Ronald Reagan, and Edgar F. Shannon, Jr. David W. Belin, a former
staff member of the Warren Commission, was named Executive Director. Named
Senior Counsel were Harold A. Baker, Ernest Gellhorn, Robert B. Olsen, and
William W. Schwarzer. Counsel were Marvin L. Gray, Jr.; George A. Manfredi;
James N. Roethe; and James B. Weidner. Ronald J. Greene served as Special
Counsel. Staff members were R. Mason Cargill, Peter R. Clapper, and Timothy S.
Hardy.

The Commission looked into all aspects of CIA operations within the United
States. Its report, submitted to the President in June 1975, lists the following
significant areas of investigation: mail intercepts; Intelligence Community
coordination; "Operation CHAOS" (collecting information on dissidents); protection
of the Agency against threats of violence; other investigations by the Office of
Security; involvement of the CIA in improper activities for the White House
(including Watergate); domestic activities of the Directorate of Operations;
domestic activities of the Directorate of Science and Technology; CIA relationships
with other federal, state, and local agencies; indices and files on American citizens;
and allegations concerning the assassination of President Kennedy. The
Commission also looked into the legal authority of the CIA and its internal and
external controls.

One area on which the Commission collected evidence, but did not include in
its report, was the role of the CIA in assassination plots against foreign leaders.
The study focused on plots against Fidel Castro of Cuba, Rafael Trujillo of the
Dominican Republic, and Patrice Lumumba of the Congo. The Commission was
primarily interested in seeing if these plots involved any domestic illegal activities,
such as connections with organized crime, as had been alleged. The report states

oe


13-00000

that the Commission did not have time to complete the study, so it was turning the
materials over to the White House.

The processed segment of this collection consists of materials identified as
being related to either the John Kennedy assassination or to plots against Castro.
The anti-Castro materials are included because of allegations that Castro or his
supporters were part of a conspiracy to kill President Kennedy as retribution.

THE INVESTIGATION OF THE KENNEDY ASSASSINATION

The Commission investigated allegations that the CIA was somehow involved in
the assassination of President Kennedy. Specifically, it looked into allegations that
E. Howard Hunt and Frank Sturgis were CIA agents and were present in Dallas
(“the derelicts") at the time of the assassination and could have fired the alleged
shots from the grassy knoll. It also investigated claims that the CIA had
relationships with Lee Harvey Oswald and Jack Ruby.

The Commission heard testimony, taped interviews, took depositions, consulted
experts in forensic pathology and ballistics, examined photographic evidence, and
requested, documents from various intelligence and law enforcement agencies. The
Commission concluded that the findings of the Warren Commission regarding a
lone assassin were correct and that Hunt and Sturgis were not the derelicts. No
concrete evidence was presented to link Oswald or Ruby to the CIA; the
Commission concluded that the allegations were "farfetched speculation."

DESCRIPTION OF PROCESSED FILES

These files contain two distinct types of material. I will refer to the first type
as Kennedy assassination materials and the second type as anti-Castro materials,
although both types were selected because of their possible connection to the
Kennedy assassination.

KENNEDY ASSASSINATION MATERIALS: Most relate to the allegation _
that CIA operatives (possibly in the persons of E. Howard Hunt and Frank Sturgis)
fired shots from the “grassy knoll" in Dealey Plaza at the time of the Kennedy
shooting. Also considered was the allegation that Oswald and/or Jack Ruby had
connections with the CIA. Witnesses, many of whom were unsolicited, provided
testimony. and exhibits supporting or refuting those allegations. The findings of the
Warren Commission regarding Oswald as a lone assassin and the single-bullet
theory were considered through analysis of photographs and the Zapruder film,
examination of Kennedy autopsy materials by a panel of medical consultants, sworn
testimony, and examination of documents from the CIA and other agencies. A
copy of the Zapruder film, lent by Robert Groden, is in the collection.

a


13-00000

There are also drafts of Chapter 19 of the Commission report, which deals with
this aspect of the investigation.

ANTI-CASTRO MATERIALS: They consist primarily of copies of
"historical" documents provided to the Commission by the CIA, predominantly, and
the State Department, Defense Intelligence Agency, and Justice Department. The
documents deal mainly with planning for covert operations in Cuba, 1960-64,
including assassination attempts on Fidel Castro, but also include some interspersed
materials on the Trujillo and Lumumba assassinations. The Cuba documents
include some items on the Bay of Pigs invasion and the Cuban missile crisis, but by
far the bulk of the material relates to Operation MONGOOSE. Included are
minutes of meetings of the various special groups assigned to planning anti-Castro
operations, reports on the operations, and memoranda between the individuals
involved.

Also included: in the “Assassination Materials" processed are transcripts of
sworn testimony and interviews conducted by Rockefeller Commission staff with
former CIA, State Department, and Defense Department officials from the 1960s
regarding what they knew about plans to assassinate foreign leaders and about the
connection between the Cuba operations and organized crime.

SELECTED RELATED MATERIALS (JUNE 1992):

The Congressional Files of Gerald R. Ford contain materials related to his
service on the Warren Commission (17 cubic feet). The Records of the U.S.
Department of the Army, Military District of Washington, Directorate of
Ceremonies and Special Events contain approximately two cubic feet of records on
the transport of President Kennedy’s remains, his funeral ceremony and interment,
and administration of the gravesite. These materials are open for research.

The Presidential Handwriting File and the files of Presidential counsel Philip
Buchen contain materials on the intelligence investigations of the mid-1970s,
including the Rockefeller Commission. These collections are open for research.
The Ford Presidential Papers may contain additional materials related generally to
the Rockefeller Commission or congressional investigations of the intelligence
community. Use the PRESNET database to locate them.

The neighboring Bentley Historical Library holds papers of John Stiles relating
to his collaboration with Gerald Ford on Portrait of the Assassin, a book about Lee
Harvey Oswald which grew out of Ford’s work on the Warren Commission.


13-00000

Additional materials on the Rockefeller Commission or plots against Fidel
Castro are in unprocessed collections or unprocessed series of open collections.
These include about 3,000 pages of collected historical documents, which continue
to be heavily classified, gathered by the White House on anti-Castro activities.

(NOTE: For additional information regarding the acquisition and processing of the
Kennedy and anti-Castro files from this collection, please see MEMO FOR THE
FILE, dated June 8, 1992, which is appended to this finding aid.]

Subject : Kennedy Assassination materials in Rockefeller
Commission

To s THE FILE
ACQUISITION OF COMMISSION FILES

The Ford Library holds two sets of files of the President's
Commission on CIA Activities within the United States
(Rockefeller Commission). The first received, a copy set which
was kept at the White House when the originals were transferred
to the Justice Department in June of 1975, was received via the
National Archives on March 1, 1978. The originals came later, in
November of 1980. The copy set is somewhat smaller than the
original set because some administrative materials were not
copied. It is the Kennedy-related materials in the original set
which have been processed in part and made available for
research.

The Ford Library received these materials under the terms of
President Ford's deed of gift.

PROCESSING THE FILES RELATED TO THE KENNEDY ASSASSINATION

In early 1992, President Ford stated publicly that he
favored the opening of currently closed files on the Kennedy
assassination and investigations thereof. The Ford Library
notified him that the Rockefeller Commission files contained
material related to the assassination and that staff planned to
consolidate those materials and process them for opening. He
endorsed this action.

The task of selecting Kennedy materials was not an easy one,
and Library staff do not claim to have found every document.
Archivists had a rough finding aid that came with the collection,
consisting of folder titles and, in some cases, lists of
documents within folders. The materials were organized by
Commission staff team not by subject. Because Robert Olsen and
James Roethe had primary responsibility for investigating
possible CIA connections with the assassination, archivists
started with their files. Within the Olsen-Roethe files there
was an identified Kennedy assassination series, which archivists
pulled first and examined. Based on their reading of those
files, and other background research, archivists were able to
examine the folder title list for the complete collection and
identify relevant folders in other staff files.

A Presidential Library Administered by the National Archives and Records Administration


13-00000

There was also about a cubic foot of material called
"Assassination Materials" which was not connected with a specific
Commission staff team. In it were documents regarding plans for
or discussions of actions against Castro, Trujillo, and Lumumba.
Those folders which appeared to have anything to do with Castro
were pulled for processing because of the issue of a possible
link between U.S. attempts to assassinate Castro and the Kennedy
assassination.

No attempt was made to go through the whole collection to
search for stray materials. Nor could archivists identify all
the people whose names appeared on folders--they may have missed
some simply because they did not know of a-connection. Folders
identified only by date of testimony were also not examined. So,
Ford Library archivists believe that processing of the full
collection may eventually lead to the discovery of additional
Kennedy material.

DESCRIPTION OF PROCESSED MATERIALS (2.5 cubic feet) <pwur Ock 1492

Archivists pulled and processed slightly over two cubic feet
of material. (This is from the original files only.) Of the
4759 pages, plus audiovisual material, approximately 68% (3232
pages) dealt with the investigation of a possible direct CIA
connection with the Kennedy assassination. This material was
pulled from staff files and chapter drafts.

The other 32% (1527 pages) consisted of materials related to
the investigation of CIA involvement in anti-Castro activities
during the early 1960s. This was pulled from a series called
“Assassination Materials," which was different from the body of
the Commission files in that the folder titles were not coded and
numbered and there seemed to be less organization within the
files.

REMOVAL OF CLASSIFIED DOCUMENTS

From the processed materials, archivists removed
approximately 450 documents for national security reasons. Of
the 450 documents, 29% were classified Top Secret, 48% were
Secret, 3% were Confidential, and 19% were unmarked. . A few
CODEWORD documents were found. Just over 60% of the withdrawn
items were dated between 1960 and 1964. Thirty-two percent were
from 1975, created during the tenure of the Commission.

There were classified documents from several agencies but
about 64% were created by CIA or had "CIA interest." An
additional 25% would be considered White House documents for
declassification purposes (including NSC/interagency documents
from the 1960s as well as the classified materials originated by
the Rockefeller Commission itself). State, Defense Department,
Army, Joint Chiefs of Staff, and Federal Bureau of Investigation
account for the rest. There were only four FBI documents.


13-00000

KENNEDY ASSASSINATION MATERIALS: Most is unclassified and
is open for research. The 16% that is classified is mainly
testimony which includes information on CIA operations.

ANTI-CASTRO MATERIALS: Approximately 87% is classified, and
much of the unclassified material is simply requests for
documents, transmittal memos, and cover sheets. Therefore much
of this section is unavailable for research until it can be
reviewed by the CIA or other originating agency.

Memo for the Record

Subject: Review of JFK files at Ford Presidential
Library, November 14-17,. 1994

Reviewers: HRG - Barry Harrelson, Kathy Puchnick
DO -(Lee Carl >
Ford Library Staff: Karen Holzhausen
Leesa Tobin

1) HRG reviewers arrived in Ann Arbor late Monday morning
and begin reviewing material that afternoon. After the
first day the hours were set for 7:30 a.m. to 4:45-p.m.

2) The Ford Library Staff had done an outstanding job
preparing the documents for our review. Copies had been
made and were in chrono order. Each document was index and
had an identification aid attached. Karen and Leesa made
themselves available for questions; if we needed to see the
original file or document they provided it immediately.

3) We reviewed each document containing CIA equities
including those already released. They, had been working
with Steve Tilly, NARA, to identify documents: in the Ford
Library holdings which had been made available to the public
through NARA.

4) Procedures:

Documents which could be released in full were stamped with
“Approved For Release...” or “CIA Has No Objections...”.

Documents containing information requiring protection were
stamped/marked “...Release as Redacted or Sanitized”.
Classified/sensitive information was highlighted in yellow.

Documents containing particular sensitive information or
that raised question among the reviewers were tagged for
review at HQ. Testimonies of Agency Officials to the
Rockefeller Commission were also tagged for HQ review.

Their were a number of sensitive White House/NSC documents
and documents from other agency which mentioned CIA but
contained no classified CIA equities. In these cases the
stamp was modified to reflect that it applied only to the
CIA information and that the document must be reviewed by
the appropriate agency before they could be released


13-00000

5) Team reviewed approximately 1200 documents (10,400
pages). Thirty-two documents (1165 pages) were tagged for
review at HQ.

6) The trip was highly successful and we have established
a good rapport with the Library Staff. At this point I
don't see the need to send another team. The remaining
documents and any new issues can be handled by phone (STU
III), FAX or courier. The only reason to send someone up
would be for a final look at the material after redaction.
I have confidence in the Library Staff, but we should
discuss with the Do.

Attached are six pages of a 26 June 1975 Senate Select
Committee request for CIA information. This document came
from the Ford Library and is part of the JFK Assassination
project. Two of the pages have no DS&T equities but are
sent to you for background information.

On page 3 we are protecting everything except for items
40, and 44. We need your reading on these. Since CIA has
admitted to drug testing, we may not be able to defend this
with the JFK Board.

On page 4 please note items 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, and
12. On page 5 please note items 14, 18, 26 and 29.

On page 6 please note item 13. (ater, Jackson, Ward
and (O'Delij are being protected, but not the other three.

Please call me on green {301067 I think these matters
can be resolved quickly. eee

Thank you.

Dear Karen:

We have finally completed the review of the JFK items that
you forwarded to us on January 4, 1995. We apologize for
the delay.

To avoid any confusion should the document be separated from
your identification form, we have stamped both the document
and the identification form. When the document was many
pages and it required only one or two redactions, we
indicated on the identification form which page/pages
required redaction. However, please check all pages since
we could have slipped up. Also, on the identification form
we indicated which other government agency/agencies needed
to coordinate on certain documents. Where the document was
Many pages and coordination was required on only a few
pages, we indicated the specific pages which should be
coordinated with the other government agency/agencies.

If you -have any questions, please do not hesitate to call us
for clarification.

To act as a filler and also to advertise ourselves, we are
enclosing some of the releases that the Center for the Study
of Intelligence has made in recent years: Sherman Kent and

SUBJECT: JFK-Package from Ford Library

1. On 9 June, at a meeting with NARA officials on the
JFK documents, I raised the subject of the package of
withdrawal sheets we had received from the President Ford
Library. Steve Tilley, NARA advised me that no action was
required by CIA with regard to the package. He said he had
spoken with Karen Holzhausen of the Library about the
package, and learned that the sheets were sent to
Steve Katz, a Senate staffer, in response to a specific
request from him. Tilley agreed that HRG would hold the
package temporarily.

2. I told him that we had identified classified

information in the package of withdrawal sheets e.g., name
of a station, although the sheets carried no classification.

He took note of this problen.

AXTHis DOCUMENT.

Subject : Rockefeller Commission files information
To s Steve Katz, Senate Committee on Government Affairs

Enclosed are the finding aid to the Rockefeller Commission files
we have processed, copies of all the withdrawal sheets, and some
explanatory information.

About the withdrawal sheets: When we remove a classified ‘
document from a folder we record more information for
administrative purposes than you find on these withdrawal sheets.
The data put into such fields as creator's agency, classifying
agency, classification level, comments, and special markings are
not printed on this short form that researchers see. our
computer program was designed to produce these abbreviated public
descriptions because some agencies, chiefly the CIA, do not want
to be public identified as the originator of specific documents.
We have made the withdrawal sheets for the Rockefeller Commission
items we have processed more explicit than normal practice
because the Church Committee published the gist of most of these
documents in 1975, identifying the CIA connection. But, because
of the software limitations, the computer cannot print the
"agency" data on the short form.

I think there is enough information for you to deduce the
originating agency for most of these documents. Most of them
were supplied to the Rockefeller Commission by the CIA, although
many of them are of interagency origin. If you have questions
about particular sheets, please don't hesitate to call me.

We may find that some, perhaps many, of these documents have
already been declassified, but rather than take the time to
research all of them and delay “opening" the collection, we
simply “pink sheeted" everything and will wait to see what
happens with the proposed review commission. If they are not
systematically declassified, we will research them individually
as they are requested under mandatory review.

ARRB did have the DOD review these documents. Periodically
a group of reviewers from CIA, DPD, NSC, and State jointly
reviewed documents at the ARRB offices. Enclosed is a cover
sheet for -10386 that the ARRB staff included with each
document. As you can see, DOD was on the “Third Agency
Equities” line. We feel certain that they reviewed these
documents because DOD was crossed through on this cover
sheet, but apparently DOD reviewers neglected to stamp it.

178-10002-10480

We assume other redactions are marked in this document;
and, yes, on page 7, we agree to release “Mr. Murphy asked
if... his sister... she .. . inside information.”
Other redactions should continue on this page and the
previous page. Copies of these pages will be forwarded if
needed.

We do not have copies of thése documents, which were
probably reviewed during one of the joint sessions at the
ARRB offices. The “no objection” was frequently used in the
joint sessions to indicate that the document had no specific
CIA equities. If there is(are) CIA equity(ies) that we

_ Missed (as opposed to NSA equities), we will need a copy of

the document(s).

178-10004-10302

Assuming other redactions continue, please also continue
to protect the particular subject on page 4; but it can be
released on page 5 because there it is used generically.

178-10410-10297

We do not have a copy of this document. If identical to
-10302, our copy of page 3 of -10302 contains no redaction.
If not identical to -10302, please provide a copy of -10297.

178-10310-10398

We do not have a copy of this document. We originally were
protecting the name of “Sherman Hoar,” but we are now
releasing the name. Therefore, in this document and in all
your documents, this name can be released.

178-10003-10404 =

We agree with you that the name and the closing word in

the clause fragment needs to be sanitized. Please sanitize.
We appreciate your calling this to our attention. Also, if
possible, on counted but unnumbered page 13 under “header
B-W, subsection VI - Mail, sub-subsection J.,” is it
possible to redact the digraph that precedes “indian?”

If not already ‘out there’, please redact the digraph.

178-10410-10041
We do not have a copy of this document, but we can release
“Handle via COMINT channel only.”

178-10004-10054 and -10053 (vice -10043)

These two documents contain a different system of controls
(not COMINT), and we need to continue to protect it. In
~10053, this is not COMINT but the other system of control.
Please protect this codeword in both documents.

Reference word was released in ‘I.d’ and protected in ‘I.b.’
on page 19 because the word in the first instance refers to
a different, less sensitive location.
