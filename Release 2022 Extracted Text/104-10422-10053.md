THE FINAL PHASE (MOPPING UP) OF THE OSWALD REVIEW:

COMPUTER PRINT OUT - RE-DECLASSIFICATION

II.

OFFICIAL FILE - documents that have been marked for

declassification or partial DC must be so noted for

future readers/reviewers.

We have suggested to Mr.

(Mayo) that a complete package of the sterile documents

be x-refed to the CS documents. This pakage will be

attached as another volume or bulky to the 201 file.

(Mx. (Mayo) is supposed to be discussing thi smatter.)

03

IlI.

NON-RELEASED DOCUMENTS:

must prepare a list of those documents which are

denied release--list should contain document symbol,

date, description and reason for non-release.

This can

probably be done in conjunction with review of computer

print-out.We also may have to attache an actual copy

of teach-document to this list--I will find out.

IVJ

RELEASED DOCUMENTS:

It may be necessary for us to attach_ to each document.

a FOIA check sheet (see attachment) indicating the

disposition of the document. plus we must stamp the sterile

copy as downgraded. (NOTE: I am not sure that we have.

to do it or Ethél's shop--but I believe it has to be done.)

2 NV

Along with the sterile copies of the documents going

to FOIA/Randall's office, there must be attached both

the "red-lined" copy and the "cut & pasted" copy of the

document. Aggain--perhaps Ethel's shop will do this.

These two Items in IV must be decided_ Whether+nX

the task pace does them M ethel:
