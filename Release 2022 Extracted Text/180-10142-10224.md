No definite reason for this severence has been documented
but, according to one source, Ray did not leave Castro because of
ideological or policy discrepancies but rather because of a

Ray withdrew from the CRC shortly after the Bay of Pigs
invasion. In a Miami new conference on May 28, 1961, he said
the major reason for the MRP break with the CRC was that the
council had failed to live up to the written promises given
it in March, outlining conditions Ray had insisted upon before
joining the organization. Thine 5/28/61, One Cuban Group
Quits Exile Body by Sam Pope Brewer) The first condition had
been that the council was to give first priority to the under-
ground fighters in Cuba during the Bay of Pigs invasion.
Secondly, Ray had insited that anyone too closely associated with
the Batista regime would not be used in the invasion and
lastly, he was to have been allowed prior approval before
any military leader of the invasion was named Cebtay Ray told
the assembled newsmen that his program to overthrow Castro
was based on maximum mobilization of the discontented people
inside Cuba and that the leadership of this underground should
come from Cubans who could prove they had such a potential

Ray then sought CIA support independing of the Council, ()
explaining to Agency personnel that the MRP did have an
effective ee organization but needed material and
financial support. eps “Ray felt it nessary for his organization

The Miami CIA station recommended Ray be given an
initial $50,000 for operational expenses () and reaction

at headquarters was immediate. Within 24 hours a Memo for the

Record was circulated objecting to the Miami Station's
recommendation, reflecting the feeling that Ray did not ever
produce any substantial military actions against Castro. y Ray
was asked to submit a "prospectus" of his plans for the MRP and
advised that no financial help would be forthcoming until such
a plan was reviewed. BM
