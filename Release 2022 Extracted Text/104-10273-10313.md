long-time record of falsely claiming Agency affiliation. In
the late 1950's HEMMING and STURGIS, both former U.S. Marine

STURGIS organized a group of mercenaries for Caribbean and

HALL, Loran Eugene HALL was a member of HEMMING's Interconti-

publicity in 1967 when New Orleans District Attorney "Jim"
GARRISON alleged that HALL (and the Intercontinental Penetration
Forcc) was involved in the assassination of President KENNEDY
and that members of this unit were connected with CIA, GARRISON
shortly thereafter dropped his interest in HALL, but it is
interesting that he did'so after Gerald Patrick HEMMING and
