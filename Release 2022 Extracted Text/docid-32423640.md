Both the Soviets and Castro are aware that a Commiet regina in Cuba,

economically, Improving living standards and maintaining the pretense that

Moscow's and Havana's objectives may not always be identical, but they

have proven sufficiently compatible for a modus operandi thus far.

The Sovleta' prime objective, expanding their Influence over estab-

Anong much of the revolutionary left, the trend of diesunsion shifted

to the need for indigenous, nationaliat revolutions, and eray from inter-

nationallan and alliance with Moscoy--oriented Conmnists and Fidelintas.

Castro has bean rejectod as a loader of the popular revolutionary sove

ment In the bentsphere by many noncomunist leftists, but they are uncertain

as to where next to turn.

A larger part of the publlo, fornerly passive or bostile tovard Centro

derided him as a weak puppet and as a bool uned by the soviets pilarily

to further their own nationel interests. The latin publie, always deeply

stirred by affronts to personal dignity, was disturbed by Castro's exclusion

from the crucial stage of

the U.8.-Bovtet negotiations over his country's fate

Castro's position would be ensured. In most countries of Bouth America,

however, popular antagonian toward Castro resulting from the crisis has

cooled and many people regard the alfair as ended by the U.S. show of

resolva.

b. Subversive capebility momentarily lessened--The decline In

Castro's prestige as a renult of the missile arists has at least for the

momant roduced his capability for subverting popular groups and moving

them Into sotion against their on governments and against U.B. Interests.

With the decline in receptivity anong popular groupe to Castro's blandish-

ments, local Pdelistes bave encountered greater difficulty in mbll1siRg

mass support for antigovernment strikes, violence, and demonstrations on

other than local lasues. Fro-Castro agitators are concentrating their

efforte increasingly in the Interior as they have done in Peru recently.

In addition, there has been an increase in sabotage and other violence

perpetrated by extremists, of the sort not requiring the participation

of large popular groups, yet designed to provoke drastic counter-measures

by governments and to increase popular antigovernment sentiment.

Peru) with the expectation of Increased material ald from Cuba.

2. Castro's options to restore his appeal

a. Course of psuedo-Independence foreseen--Fidel Castro's Intransi-

gent posture againat on-site Inspection at the time of soviet Deputy Premier

Mikoyan's vialt raleed his stock in at least a few countries. His claims

to have got the better of the U.S. in the recent prisoner exchange may be

expected to have a similar effect. Moreover, merely staying in power 1n

Cube when the logloal outcome of the crisis seemad to many to indicate his

dowfall has taken the bitter edge off reaction against fastro among some

ant1-U,s, groups.

Castro probably stands to gain most by adopting a publle posture

Independent of Soviet political domination while at the sans time attempting

to demonstrate in Cuba the benefits of economic association with the

socialist camp. Buch a polloy of "pseudo-Independence" would involve a

minimun of fundamental polloy reorientation. Castro's Independent political

course might be easily developed through public harangues: a propaganda

campaign calling for violent reballion and guerrilla warfare in the country-

BIde, less emphasis upon Marxist-leninist dogne, re-enunciation of the

'original' aóth of July ideals, and s softening in the appearance of blo

domestio programs.

b. Bovlets' response--The Bovlets would welcone Castro's efforts to

demonstrate independence and would probably tolerate his militant stance

In Latin America If It did not run counter to Soviet polley, They would

hope that by helping him to refurbish hle imje, they could restore some

of his value as an agent of political subversion among restive popular

groups. A campaign of independent-sounding oratory would allow Castro to

let off steam and preen his vanity without having measurable effect upon

Soviet 'peaceful' poliey objectives elsewhere in Iatin America.

At the same tine, a few big 'Impact' projects in Cuba

would seen to vindicate Castro's policy of close economie cooperation

with the USSR In the eyes of Latins elsewhere. Such projects would reduce

pressure for economic aid from the Cubans themselves and restore hope

among potential revolutionaries of securing economic ald in defiance of

the U,S. without risking foreign political controls.

3. Sovlot Influence and standing in Latin America,

a. Soviets shered. lestro's 1088 of aypeal--The Soviet Unton shared

Castro's setback in almost every country of Latin America. The revelation

of 1ts war-llke intentions and 1te plans for secretly Installing an offen-

sive base in Cuba detracted from 1ts carefully-cultivated 1mage as a peace-

loving nation. In areas within range of the Soviet missiles, it aroused

for the first time an awareness of the danger of nuclear destruction.

Many leftiat intellectuals who are still drawn to the Cuban

model condemned the Soviet Union for its cynical exploitation of the revolution

for 1ts own purposes. To some extent, they shared the general disdain felt

by most latins for what appeared as a cowardly backdown from riaky con-

frontation with the U.s.

Nevertheless, the rationale for Soviet behavior propounded by

Moscow and by local cormunist parties as well--that the Soviet tactice have

succeeded in guaranteeing Cuba's safety from U.S, invasion--has been accepted

by those who have a strong desire to maintain their faith. Moreover, although

the Soviet actions during the crisis period detracted from the reputation of

TENGFORN

the Soviet Union in Latin America, they are not likely to have lasting

111 effecte on the usual type of Soviet moves to expand their influence

in the area.

b. Moscoy beherdor criticized by latin commnists--There are few

Indications of any change in relations between Moncow and local Latin American

communist parties, although the communist parties have undergone varying

degrees of soul-searching and recrimination. Parties have found it more

aifficult to get members out in the streets for propaganda projects and

demonetrations since late October, In Argentine and Guatemala, commnist

leaders have been asked for explanations of the soviet novas by party

members who viewed the witharawal as a humillation for Cuba. In Peru,

Costa Rica, and Venezuela, longetanding rifts within the partias over

personalities and local pollcies have been widened by disagreement on the

wisdom of the soviet actions; most of the 'old guard' supports the soviet

policy and many 'young turk' dissidents condern it as & show of weakness.

According to one report, demoralization of Ecuadorean communists has been

severe enough to threaten a takeover by Feiping-liners.

4. Gr1s1s' effect on govermentel relations with the UBBR and Cube.

The missile orials led to bangos in the attitudes of a number of

governments toward the soviet Union and dimmed the possibillty of new

diplomatic gains by the Soviets in

some countries. It also caused several

of the five governments maintelning diplomatic ties with Cuba to consider

breaking relations with the Castro regime.

The crisie enabled President Paz Estenssoro of Bolivia to move

ahead--If only momentarily--in his effort to keep Bolivia allied with

the West. The left-wing faction of Paz's governing MIR party had been

,SECRET NOFORA

## Page 14

SECRET NOFORN

pressing him to adopt a new program of "positive neutralien", hostile

to the U.S., strongly pro-Cuban, and involving closer aid and trade ties

with the bloc. Resietance by the public to the new leftist line grew

as a result of the crisis and permitted the government to lay aside for

the time being consideration of closer relations with Noscow.

Mexico, which had remined aloof from strong efforts to block soviet

penetration Into this hemisphere, turned its legalistic approach to vorld

problems against the UBBR. It accused the Sovlets of intervening in the

Internal affairs of Cuba and of denying the Cubans self-determination in

natters pertaining to their on welfare, With the relesation of the

arIals, however, the Mexioun Government was able to avoid taking a forth-

right stand on Cube and has now determined now to prejudice domestic

polities by breaking with Cuba.

The first flush of enthusiasm in favor of breaking diplomtic ties

with Cuba by other countrles like Mexico which still retain them has

dissipated In the pst-crisis atmosphere. In Chile, which might have

broken with Castro under U.S, pressure in the early days of the crisis,

domestic political considerations again hold sway and the government 1s

unwilling to glve leftist opposition groupe a political windfall by

arousing pro-Cuben sympathies. In Uruguay, popular sentiment in favor

of a break has quieted down, and joliticians prefer to let the lasue l1e.

In Brazil, the developments in the Geribjean have been offset by domestic

economic problems which are straining relations with the U.S. and inclining

President Goulart to l00k to the bloc for economic aid.

5. Soviets' post-crisis views of their capabilities and opportunities

a, No lestles damage foreseen--The Soviets probably think of their

capabilities and opportunities in latin America In much the same say as

they did before the missile crisis. They see no lasting damage to their

Influence in the area despite temporary anti-Castro, anti-soviet reactions.

Salvage from the crisis includes the presence of Soviet troops and advanced

defense systens In Cuba..

Seen through Comminist eyes, latin America 1s ripe for violent social

revolution. The Alliance for Progress recognized this possibility, and yet,

so the soviets probably belleve, 18 poverless to produce the social and

economic changes needed to alter the trend. Reforn proposals only make

the economic elite nervous end the population restless. The prospects for

evolutionary reform are nil because of the olite's predatory and defeatist

outlook, The latin form of capitaliam is fundamentally different from

that In Westem Europe, where Increased production and wider distribution

of goods 1s creating modern industrial democracy on the U.S. pattern.

According to the soviet view, many dominant groups in leading

Latin American countrles, now in control or with a good chance to take over,

are ready to seek a way out of their frustrations by maneuvering between

the two great powers. Popullat forces, although shocked by the missile

crisis, are again deeply absorbed in their own problems. These groups are

trying to appear as advocates of rapid shange, For this reason, they are

available as allies to the side demonstrating the most force and confidence

In pressing for radical change.

The rovolutionary left, moreover, lacks another alternative. In

the revolutionary left view, Castro's economic failure 1s not critical since

economic development is secondary to "social Justice". The revolutionary

left is driving to upset the established order and to rebuild on a

totalitarian model, not to maximize INP. The Cuban example shows social

revolution is possible, even in a small country near the United States,

If the Soviets lend a helping hand.

b. Another Cube not desired--The Soviets are obviously aware of

a wide range of very different possibilities, Many of the countries are

falrly sintlar to Cuba, Viz., Central American and Andean republics. In

the foret view one ally of Cuba's quality is probably enough for now. Cuba

1s a test-proved case of how far the Soviets can go In the ares, and the

pott is now made. In setting up shop In Cuba, moreover, the Soviets

have become avare of the problems and expense involved, and they now

recognize, since the missile crisis, that there 1o & l1mit on returna to

be expected.

some countries probably Interest the Soviets as trouble spots

where agitation by lastro/Communist forces can have a destructive Impact

on reform movements and governments now amenable to Soviet ties and Influence.

The governments in these countries, which are among the most hostile to

the Soviets in any case, can be harassed through popular pressures,

sabotage, and other means.

c. Concentration on more developed countries Ilkely--Il the Soviets

are not working fox a prollferation of satellite regimes in latin America,

their focus is probably on some of the larger countrles which can be seen

as hesitating between dependence on the U.s, and & new course. These

countries, in the Soviet view, can be pushed from a status guo economic

and political alignment with the U.S. Into neutralism, relying on Western

and Eastern Europe, holding the U.s. at arms length, and sooner or later

breaking through to violent social revolution.

In opening new courses for the major Latin American countries,

Cuba has been and continues to be the key, though not the model. It

stands for a pledge of sovlet support encouraging goverments to use

existing U.S, assets (outstanding loane, private Investments) as loverage

to force new U.S. aid without any guid pro quo in the shape of reform.

d. Prazll a prime objective--The preferred targets for Boviet

planners are probably those countries where the U.S, has a large stake,

where the polltical systen ls responsive to popular pressures, and where

the dominant forces are inversed in acute economia a1ff1cultled, Erastl

must seem secessible and also crucial in Boviet planning. With the

greatest potential of any Latin American country, Brazil 1s caught

in a morass of economio and political problems. In seeking to solve

these problems, the Goulart regime could take a course leading on to

neutralism and even more radical solutions.

doulart's government, chafing at the conditions lald down by the

U.s. for economic ald, made suggestive gestures toward the USSR in the

latter half of 1962, negotlating for expanded trade and exploring

possibilities for large-scale econome assistance. fuch gestures were

¡ In part a tactle aimed at gaining U.S. concessions on the pre-conditions

for ald. Goulart may well accept some Soviet economic offers and he

might even accept large-scale Soviet old in an effort to make his threat

to the U.S. more credible.

Goulart, however, does not occupy a wholly secure position in

domestic politica. His moves are circumscribed by the tenuousness of

his own position. It may be assumed that any Soviet response to hie

actions will take this factor into account, especially the contingency

that an overly hasty and overly zealous response could lead to a reaction

Inside Brazil that would remove Goulart from power. Despite these

Imitations, the soviets probably would be willing to pour substantial

suns Into Brazil.

For the longer run, they are not able to supply by themselves

an adequate substitute for U.S. aid. Brazil's need to look to Western

Europe for supplies, markets, and even capital would tend to discourage

the Soviets from pushing for violent social revolution in Brazil. A

reasonable Soviet target in Brazil is a neutraliat government.

e. Other Sordet poss1b1l1tlen--In other major countries of the

ares, the soviets can probably see interesting situations, that promise

returns through manipulation of governments to defy the U.S. and through

support to populist movements linked with the Commnists. The communist -

linked popular front (FRAP) in Chile could win the elections scheduled for

1964, open the way for a Chilean expropriation of U.S. copper company

holdings, and move the country to neutralism. The future political course

Of Argentina 1s still uncertain enough to suggest desirable possibilities

for a Peronist alliance with the Communists and a resultant break with the

United States.

Venezuela le a more complex problem. Because Venezuela 18 so

closely Interlocked with the U.S. economy, neutralisn seems out of the

question, and the Soviets probably consider Venezuela closer to the Cuban

case than to opportunities in Argentina, Brazil and Chile. Noscow will

thus probably exercise caution with regard to Venezuela. The same cannot

be said of Havens, which hopes to exploit the serious tensions there

between rich and poor, old and young, local and foreign.
