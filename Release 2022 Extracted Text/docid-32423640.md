MEMORANDUM FOR THE SECRETARY OF DEFENSE

SUBIBCT: CUBA AS A BASE FOR SUBVERSION

"Po prepare a country-by-country analysis in relation to Mo. MeGone's
sta tements to the Stennis Committee: .

1, "Every fiatin American country has a Commnist apparatus
of greater or lesser extent, depending upon the country, end the -
leadership, Every one of them ere linked in an intimate way to Havena,
and from Havana to Moscow. here is no question about the fact that
this ts the bridgehead of commmiam into all of Eatin Asurica.

2. "fGentral and Bouth Auarica7 will erode avay quite rapidly,
in ny opinion [ie ve don't get the Comamists out of Cubg/."

Molude in this analyeis an estimte of the strengths and weaknesses
and future prospects of commnism in Latin America and the extent to which
the strengths and future prospects could be influenced by either continu-
ation or removal of a Commnist government in Cuba,

FAGIG HEARING OM THR PROBLEM

See country tabs which are appended.
SUORURY COMETS TORE

During hhd immediately after the crisis the reputation of Gastro and
the Soviets fell in latin America, even emong ardent supportere of Castro/
Commnism, Gastro was criticized for handing Guba over to the USSR and was
later aertaea for being ignored by his elly. The Soviets were held to be

blatantly aggressive in moving into Cuba with misaile bases. Later, they



NW 65360
Docld:32423640 Page 5

lost face for backing off from the U.S. quarantine and further possible
sanctions. For the moment at least the climate was hostile to subversion
by local activists and to penetration by the Soviet government.

By now the bitter edge of the reaction has worn off and the situation
in the area has come inoreasingly to resemble what ‘tt was pre-crisis.
There is still a real attraction among leftists for revolutionary solu-
tions to problems of backwardness, Support from Havana is better than
none at all in the view of the Latin American revolutionary left. tore-
over, the Soviet Union continues to be attractive to established govern-
mante which seek to reduce their dependence on the U.f.

The Boviets will try to hold their position in Guba and at the
same time they will continue to search for new routes into Latin America.
Both the Soviets and Castro are aware that a Communist regime in Cube,
should it be able to demonstrate to Latin America en ability to flourish
economically, improving living standards and maintaining the pretense that
lands have been distributed to the common man, would represent an appealing
example to the rest of the Western Hemisphere, Cuba was more prosperous
than most of Latin America before Castro; there are indications that even
st the current level of Soviet economic aid it ean by 1965 become so again.
Furthermore, Cuba has provided, Noscow/tavena doctrinal blend in the way of
training facilities in the Western Hemisphere, well suited for the indoctrin+
ation of revolutionary tactics in Latinos in familiar climate and mores.
Moscow's and Havana's objectives may not always be identical, but they
have proven sufficiently compatible for a modus operandi thus far.

The Soviets are probably not trying to create another Cuba as such,

They will probably concentrate on Brazil, Chile and Argentina--more or

wae

| less in that order. Brazil currently offers the most promising opportunity

for Long-range Soviet exploitation. Venezuela's close ties with the U.S.
| tend to rule out a Soviet attempt to foster neutralism there and for this
reason continued Commmnist--and Castroite--efforte to aubvert the govern-
ment are likely,

The Bovieta' prime objective, expanding their influence over estab-
lished governments, can be harmonized with Ouban~-promoted subversion -
because of the variety of opportunities in the area. In fact, the Soviets
ean see a useful supporting role for Castro-sponsored violence in countries
fron which they are shut out, They will want Gastro to avoid getting caught,

however, fearing that this would justify additional U.S. and Latin American

measures agkinst Cuba and create more problems for the USER.

In short, while it is true that every Latin American country has a
Commmist apparatus of greater or lesser extent, the evidence is that
Moscow's influence came first and continues independently in all Latin
| 4merican countries, including Guba, while Castro's influence is superim-
| posed on that of the USSR and only in some instances overshadows Moscow's
influence. It would be proper to speak of Havana being a bridgehead into
pome parte of Latin America, Yt is misleading to conclude that "There is

no question about the fact that this is the bridgehead of commniem into
all of Latin America."

With respect to the strengths, wealmesses, and future prospects of
Commnism in Letin America, with or without Castro and a Commmist Cuba,
it is well to bear in mind that conditions of poverty, backwardness, lack
of educational opportunities, wealth concentrated into the hands of a very

few, etc., have made Latin America susceptible to extremist solutions

(of the Right or Left) for many years, This is a chronic disease of the
eres, Moscow found some support in every Latin American country long
before Castro's Cubs came into beings were Cuba to sink beneath the
waves tomorrow, Moscow's influence, directly or through other intermedt-
aries, would contimue to be felt,

Wate, MeCone's Judgment that Commmism will make great strides
in Iatin America might prove to be true, it would be misleading to attri-
bute this solely to Castro/Gousamism and Cuba, Tt 18 a fact that Castro's
violent revolutionary appeals have seized the imaginations of (primarily)
the youth in mny Latin Aseriean countries. To aay, in Mr. MeCene's vords,
thet “(Central end South America)vill erode avay quite rapidly, in ny
opinion (if we don't get the Coummiste out of Cuba)" exaggerates the role
and influence of Cuba. The question is e complex one which involves (a)
some IA countries which are mre strongly influenced by Castro/Comanien -
such as Venezuela; (>) some IA countries vhich are more strongly influenced
by Moscow/Commmisn - such as Brazils (c) some IA countries in which leftist
splinter parties split the influences and (4) indications of conflict be-
tween Moseos and Havana. No generalization seens adequate on current svidence..

No discussion of Cuba as a base for subversion would be complete
‘Without reference to Commmist Chinese influenee, direct and indirect.
The direct influence, unfortunately, cannot be assessed adequately on the
vasia of our current intelligence. (One example: the mumbers of Chinese
Commnist advisors in Cuba have been variously estimated as 30 in one case,
end 3,000 in enother.) The indirect evidence, vhile presumptive, relates
to the close ideological and tactical agreement between, for instence,
Che Guevara's work on guerrills warfare end that of Mao Tae-Tung, Furthermore,

at the time of the missile erisis in Cubs, huge demonstrations in favor of
Castro's “five points” took plece in China, Previous to the missile crisis,

had actively supported him in one way or another within their own countries,
Many former supporters expressed shock and disillusionment at the evidence
of his subservient relationship to Moscow. These and others have had
second thoughts regarding the wisdom of depending upon unconditional
aupport from the Soviet Union in attempts to achieve independence from U.S,
"inperialisn",

Among much of the revolutionary left, the trend of diseussion ehifted
to the need for indtgenous, nationalist revolutions, and avay from inter-
nationaliem and alliance with Noscow--oriented Comunists and Pidelintes,
Gastro has been rejected as a leader of the popular revolutionary mve-
ment in the hem{sphere by many noncommmist leftists, but they are uncertain
as to where next to turn.

A larger part of the public, formerly passive or hostile toward Castro
derided him as a weak puppet and as a tool used by the Soviets primriiy
to further their ow national interests. The Latin public, always deeply
stirred by affronts to personal dignity, was disturbed by Castro's exclusion
from the crucial stage of the U.S.-Soviet negotiations over his country's fate
and by his inability to prevent the withdrawal of the weapons systems which
he regarded es vital. to Cuba's defense. The crisia caused umny moderate
center and conservative groups to be noré avare of the aggressive atm of
She USER in this hemisphere and of the threat posed by Guba as an operational
base for the Soviets. At the same time, they vere heartened by the decisive
U.8. response.

Tn those countries bordering the Caribbean, the crisis hetghtenea
pressures for @ final and definitive solution to the Cuban problem, and in
the aftermth there has been fear that the U.8. resolve would weaken and that

Castro's position would be ensured. In most countries of South America,
however, popular entagonism toward Castro resulting from the crisis has
eooled ‘and many people regard the affair as ended by the U.8. show of
resolve.

Castro's prestige as a result of the missile crisis has at least for the
moment reduced his capability for subverting popular groups and moving.
them into action against their om governnents and against U.68. interests.
With the decline in receptivity among popular groups to Castro's blandish-
ments, looal Fidelistas have encountered greater difficulty in mbilising
mass support for antigovernment strikes » Violence, and demonstrations on
other than local issues. Pro-Cestro agitators are concentrating their
efforts increasingly in the interior as they have done in Peru recently.
Jn addition, there has been an increase in sabotage and other violence
perpetrated by extremists » of the sort not requiring the participation
of large popular groups » yet designed to provoke drastic counter-measures
by governments and to increase popular antigovernment sentiment.

c. Appeals for revolution continue-~Meanwhile, Castro continues
his now femiliar appeal for revolution in Latin America on the Cuban model,
His subversive apparatus remins essentially intact. The Cuban news agency
Prensa Latina operates in at least four major cities. Havana radio
continues its schedule of broadcasts in support of antigovernment groups
in other Caribbean countries » and Cuba's diplomatic missions in Brazil,
Bolivia, Chile, Mexico, and Uruguay still serve as important channels
for subversion and Propaganda, The hard-core element among pro-Castro
Leftist organizations continues to function--in some cases (Roundor and

Peru) with the expectation of increased material aid from Cuba.
2. Castro's options to restore his appeal

a. Course of psuede-independence for ~-Fidel Castro's intransi-
gent posture against on-site inspection at the tima of Boviet Deputy Promter
Mikoyan's visit raised hie stock in at least a few countries. Mis claims
to have got the better of the U.S, in the recent prisoner exchange may be
expected to have a similar effect, Moreover, merely staying in power in
Cuba when the logical outcome of the crisis seemad to many to indicate his
downfall has taken the bitter edge off reaction against Gastro among some
enti-U.S. groups. ;

Gastro probably stands to gain most by adopting a public posture
independent of Boviet political domination while at the same time attempting
to demonstrate in Cuba the benefits of economic association with the
socialist camp. Such a policy of "“pseudo-independence" would involve a
minimum of fundamental policy reorientation. Castro's independent political
course might be easily developed through public harangues! a Propaganda
campaign calling for violent rebellion and guerrilla warfere in the country~
side, less emphasis upon Marxist-Leninist dogma, re-enunciation of the
‘ordginal' 26th of duly ideals, end a softening in the appearance of his
domestic programs,

b. Boviets' Zesponse--The Soviets would welcome Castro's efforts to
demonstrate independence and would probably tolerate his militant stance
in Latin America if 1t did not run counter to Soviet policy, They would
hope that by helping him to refurbish hie imge, they could restore some

of his value as an agent of political subversion among restive popular

groups. A campaign of independent -sounding oratory would allow Castro to
let off steam and preen his vanity without having measurable effect upon
Soviet ‘peaceful! policy objectives elsewhere in Latin America.

At the same time, a few big ‘impact' projects in Cuba
would seem to vindicate Castro's policy of close economic sooperation
with the USSR in the eyes of Latins elsewhere. Such Projects would reduce
pressure for economic aid from the Cubans themselves and restore hope
among potential revolutionaries of securing economic aid in defiance of
the U.8. without risking foreign political controls.

3. Soviet influence and standing in Latin America
a ets_s) Gastro's lose of a ~The Soviet Union shared
Castro's setback in almst every country of Latin America. The revelation
of its war-like intentions and its plans for secretly installing an offen-
Sive base in Cuba detracted from its carefully-cultivated image as a peace-
loving nation. In areas within vange of the Soviet missiles, it aroused
for the first time an awareness of the danger of nuclear destruction.

Many leftist intellectuals who are still drawn to the Cuban
model condemmed the Soviet Union for its cynical exploitation of the revolution
for its own purposes, To some extent, they shared the general disdain felt
by most Latins for what appeared as a cowardly backdown from risky con-
frontation with the U.S.

Nevertheless, the rationale for Soviet behavior propounded by
Moscow and by local commnist parties as well--that the Soviet tactics have
Succeeded in guaranteeing Cuba's safety from U.S. invasion--has been accepted
by those who have a strong desire to maintain their faith. Moreover, although

the Soviet actions during the crisis period detracted from the reputation of

the Soviet Union in Latin America, they are not likely to have lasting
411 effects on the usual type of Soviet moves to expand their influence
in the ares.

b. Moscow behavior criticized by Intin commmiste-There are fev
indications of any change in relations between Moscow and local Letin American
commnist parties, although the commmist parties have undergone varying
degrees of soul-searching and recrimination. Parties have found it mre
difficult to get wenbers out in the streets for propaganda projects and
Genonstrations since late October. In Argentina and Guatemila, commmnist
leaders have been asked for explanations of the Soviet mves by party
members who viewed the withdrawal as a humiliation for Cuba. In Peru,
Goste Rica, and Venezuela, longstanding rifts within the parties over
personalities and leeal policies have been widened by disagreement on the
wisdom of the Soviet actions; mst of the ‘old guard’ supports the Boviet
policy and many ‘young: turk! dissidents condem it as @ show of weakness.
According to one report, demoralization of Ecuadorean communists has been
severe enough to threaten a takeover by Peiping-liners.

4, iets! ot On. tal, relatio: th

The missile crisis led to changes in the attitudes of 4 number of
governments toward the Soviet Union and dinmed the possibility of new
diplomatic gains by the Soviets in some countries. It also caused several
of the five governments maintaining diplomatic ties with Cuba to consider
breaking relations with the Castro regime.

The crisis enabled President Paz Estenssoro of Bolivia to move
shead--1f only momenterily-~in his effort to keep Bolivia allied with

the West. The left-wing faction of Paz's governing MNR party had been

SBP SEERET -noronn—

pressing him to adopt a new program of "positive neutralism", hostile
to the U.S., strongly pro-Cuban, and involving closer aid and trade ties
with the bloc. Resistance by the public to the new leftist line grew
a8 & result of the crisis and permitted the government to lay aside for
the time being consideration of closer relations with Moscow.

Mexico, which had remained aloof from strong efforts to block Soviet
penetration into this hemisphere, turned its legalistic approach to world
problems against the USER. It accused the Soviets of intervening in the
internal affairs of Cuba and of denying the Cubans self-determination in
matters pertaining to their ovn welfare. With the relaxation of the
crisis, however, the Mexican Government was able to avoid taking a forth-
right stand on Cuba and has now determined now to prejudice domestic
politics by breaking with Cuba,

The first flush of enthusiasm in favor of breaking diplomtic ties
with Cuba by other countries like Mexico which still retain them has
dissipated in the Bot-crisis atmosphere. In Chile, which might have
broken with Castro under U.S, pressure in the early days of the crisis 7
domestic political considerations again hold sway and the government is
wawilling to give leftist opposition groups a political windfall by
arousing pro-Guban sympathies. In Uruguay, popular sentiment in favor
of a break has quieted down, and politicians prefer to let the issue lie.
In Brazil, the developments in the Garit»ean have been offset by domestic
economic problems which are straining relations with the U.S. and inelining

President Goulart to look to the bloc for economic aid.

5+ Soviets' post-crisis views of their capabilities and opportunities
a, No lasting damage foreseen--The Soviets probably think of their

capabilities and opportimities in Latin America in mech the same way as

wP-SteRE

rOREST :

they did before the missile crisis. They see no lasting damage to their
influence in the area despite temporary anti-Castro, anti-Soviet reactions.
Salvage from the crisis includes the presence of Soviet troops and advanced
defenee systems in Cuba.

Seen through Commmist eyes, Latin America is ripe for violent social
revolution. The Alliance for Progress recognized this possibility, and yet,
80 the Soviets probably believe, 1s powerless to produce the social and
economic changes needed to alter the trend. Reform proposals only make
the economic elite nervous and the population restless. The prospects for
evolutionary reform are nil because of the elite's predatory and defeatict
outlook. The Tetin form of capitalism is fundamentally different from
that in Western Burope, where increased production and wider distribution
of goods is creating modern industrial democracy on the U.8. pattern.

Agoording to the Soviet view, many dominant groups in leading
Latin American countries, now in control or with a good chance to take over,
are ready to seek a way out of their frustrations by maneuvering between
the two great powers. Populist forces, although shocked by the missile
crisis, are again deeply absorbed in their own problems. These groups are
trying to appear as advocates of rapid change, For this reason, they are
available as allies to the side demonstrating the most force and confidence
in pressing for radical change.

The revolutionary left, moreover, lacks another alternative. In
the revolutionary left view, Castro's economic failure is not critical since
economic development is secondary to "social justice". The revolutionary
left is driving to upset the established order and to rebuild on a

totalitarian mdel, not to maximize GNP. The Cuban example shows social

revolution is possible, even in @ small country near the United States,
4f the Soviets lend a helping hand.

b. Another Cuba not desired-~The Soviets ave obviously aware of
a wide range of very different possibilities. Many of the countries are
fairly similar to Cuba, viz., Central American and Andean republics. In
the Soviet view one ally of Cuba's quality is probably enough for now. Cuba.
is a test-proved case of how far the Soviets can go in the ares, end the
point is now made. In setting up shop in Guba, moreover, the Soviets
jmve become aware of the problems and expense involved, and they now
recognize, since the missile crisis, that there is @ limit on returns to
be expected.

Some countries probably interest the Soviets as trouble spots
where agitation by Castro/Commnist forces can have a destructive impact
on reform movements and governments now amenable to Soviet ties and influence.
The governments in these countries, which are among the mst hostile to
the Soviets in any case, can be harassed through popular pressures,
sabotage, and other means.

c. Concentration on more. developed countries likely--If the Soviets
are not working for a proliferation of satellite regimes in Latin America,
their focus is probably on some of the larger countries which can be seen
as hesitating between dependence on the U.S. and a new course. These

countries, in the Soviet view, can be pushed from a status quo economic

and political alignment with the U.S. into neutralism, relying on Western
and Eastern Europe, holding the U.5. at erms length, and sooner or later

breaking through to violent social revolution.

Tn opening new courses for the major Latin American countries,
Cuba has been and continues to be the key, though not the mdel. It
stands for a pledge of Soviet Support encouraging governments to use
existing U.8. assets (outstanding loans, private investments) as leverage
to force new U.S. ald without any guid pro quo in the shape of reform.

a, BZ: objective--The preferred targets for Soviet
planners are probably those countries where the U.8. has a large stake,
where the political system is responsive to popular pressures, and where
the dominant forces are immersed in acute economia Gsfficulties, Brasil
mst seem accessible and also crucial in Soviet Planning. With the
greatest potential of any Latin American country, Brazil is caught
in @ morass of economic and political problems. In seeking to solve
these problems, the Goulart regime could take a course leading on to
neutralism and even more radical solutions.

Goulart's government, chefing at the conditions laid down by the
U.8. for economic aid, made suggestive gestures toward the USSR in the
latter half of 1962, negotiating for expanded trade and exploring
possibilities for Jarge-scala economia eeeteteee Such gestures were
in part « tactic aimed at gaining U.6. concessions on the pre-conditions
for aid. Goulart my well accept some Soviet economic offers and he
might even accept large-scale Soviet aid in an effort to make his threat
to the U.S. more credible,

Goulert, however, does not occupy a wholly secure position in
domestic politica, His moves are circumscribed by the tenuousness of

his own position. It may be assumed that any Soviet response to his

We SECRET

NOFORE-

Docld:32423640 Page 17


NW 65360

actions will take this factor into account » especially the contingency
that an overly hasty and overly zealous response could lead to a reaction
inside Brazil that would remve Goulart from power. Despite these
limitations, the Soviets probably would be willing to pour substantial
sums into Brazil,

For the longer run, they are not able to supply by themselves
an adequate substitute for U.S. aid. Brazil's need to look to Western
Burope for supplies, markets, and even capital would tend to discourage
the Soviets from pushing for violent social revolution in Brazil. A
reasonable Soviet target in Brazil is a neutralist government,

@. Other Soviet possibilities--In other major countries of the
area, the Soviets can probably see interesting situations,that promise
returns through manipulation of governments to defy the U.8. and through
support to populist movements linked with the Commnists. The commnist-
linked popular front (FRAP) in Chile could win thedections scheduled for
1964, open the way for a Chilean expropriation of U.S. copper company
holdings, and move the country to neutralism. The future political course
of Argentina is still uncertain enough to suggest desirable possibilities
for a Peronist alliance with the Commnists and a resultant break with the
United States.

Venezuela is a more complex problem. Because Venezuela is so
closely interlocked with the U.S. economy, neutralism seems out of the
question, and the Soviets probably consider Venezuela closer to the Cuban
case than to opportunities in Argentina, Brazil and Chile. Moscow will
thus probably exerctse caution with regard to Venezuela. The same cannot
be said of Havena, which hopes to exploit the serious tensions there
between rich and poor, old and young, local and foreign.

f. Soviets' advice to Castro - If Castro insists on playing a

strong revolutionary role throughout Letin America, he could induee strains
in his relations with the Soviets. Overly militent tactice would run
counter to higher Soviet strategy in some countries of the area, end in
othars it might involve Boviet prestige in undesirably risky situations,
Nevertheless, Moscow will probably be willing to go along with Castro/
Comamist subversive activity in certain cases. It has o real value in
countries where neutralism has no future; it is a meens to precipitate -
violent sodial revolution by immbilizing government reform movenents,
frightening off foreign capital, and promoting the flight of domestic
capital. While tolerating the destructive role that suite Castro's nature,
the Soviets will probably encourage him to stay out of the countries

whioh they hope to propel into « neutralist course ani to concentrate on
those where insurgency has a function.
