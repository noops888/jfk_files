stated he had been in Miami during this time but refused to

owed by him to Baton Rouge, Louisiana,: gambler : FRAN. ICL
(DL 165-118); DAVIS would only comment that he had‘taken
care of the matter and that he had lost the money. in-a poker.
game in which VUCI was supposed. to have: been his partner,

He stated that although the stories around town! had stated
the amount was $18,000, it was actually $5,000.: OWENS: made
a comment to the. Bureau Agents which possibly reflects the
attitude of numerous Dallas gamblers, to wit, “Are you guys
bothering the other. gamblers as much as you are bothering
me?", He then went on to explain that anyone connected with
gambling in. Dallas is quite upset over the intensified
efforts, of the, FBI and IRS in checking all gambling ‘activities
in Dallas.

file 143-24 was interviewed by! Bureau Agents -at his place

of business. CATERINE admitted having ordered and purchased
the numerous -items of gambling equipment consisting mostly
of marked playing cards and loaded dice which had been found
in his apartment ‘recently by Dallas police officers, He
claimed he had purchased these several years ago froma
company in Chicago and had used them to "cheat suckers" in
poker games in the Dallas area two or three years ago,’ He
claimed that after he had made some money ‘through these
efforts he suddenly decided to quit because he was afraid

if he continued he might get into trouble with some other
gambler who would discover his activities, CATERINE appeared
to be cordial and cooperative and further contacts. with him
will be conducted by the Dallas Office in an effort to develop
him as an informant or source of information. »He is an
operator of a private: drinking club in Dallas and therefore,
in a position to be of possible assistance to the Bureau,

a On 3/15/63, MILTO! IMMERMAN, owner and operator
_of a liquor store in Dallas/ was interviewed by Bureau Agents. ; BG
at his place.of business. ZIMMERMAN's name and phone. number hfe
had bee: found among the effects of Dallas bookmakers SHERMAN i
¢  FRANKLINALITTLE and MARVIN/COX (DL 165-129) when they were “7: //\7_.. |
a) 2 arrested | by the Dallas PD/Vice Squad 2/20/63, based. on informa-
va tion furnished by the Dallas Office, ZIMMERMAN freely admitted |
his wagering activities with the subjects. and furnished !
pertinent information concerning their activities; He
appeared to be quite cooperative and stated he would assist |
the Bureau in the investigation of LITTLE and COX, “As a i
result of this contact, a new. 137 case is being opened con- ;
cerning ‘ZIMMERMAN and further contacts will be made with |
him in accordance with Bureau instructions.

On 4/3/63, GEORGE FREDERICKY RECHENBERG (DL .162=210) , fee
was interviewed for the third time: by Bureau Agents concerning a |
gambling activities in the Dallas Division an pecifically sé |
those of. own Dallas gamblers RUSSELL DOUGLA \TTHEWS. and ete |
JOHN EL NE and STONE's associates. RECHENBERG. furnished A
a great al al-of pertinent information concerning these men iss
and their activities and information received concerning !
MATTHEWS was used as a basis for opening a new ITAR - Gambling
case concerning MATTHEWS. Dallas has submitted a letter to -
the Bureau in connection with this matter, Because of the
‘ above, a new 137 case has been opened concerning RECHENBERG
and it is believed because of his vast knowledge of gambling
, activities in Dallas as well as his close association with ‘
bookmakers in Dallas, he can be of value to the Bureau, |

A review of the Dallas Interview Brogram to date
reflects that in many instances pertinent information has
been obtained and several potentially good sources have
been developed. It has also been noted that the Program
-has created an uneasy atmosphere among the gambling element
in the Dallas area, This discreet pressure along with
intensified investigation will be maintained by the: Dallas t
Division. i
