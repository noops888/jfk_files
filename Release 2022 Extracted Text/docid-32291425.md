Re Dallas letter, 3/11/63.

On 3/14/63, while conducting investigation concerning

the operation of a gambling club at 3109 West Davis, (DL 165-115)

Bureau Agents observed known Dallas gambler JOHNNY ROSS PATRONO

park his car in the area and start towards the gambling club.

Agents contacted PATRONO and interviewed him in the Bureau car.

PATRONO appeared to be cooperative and cordial but it was also

quite apparent that he was inquisitive as to the purpose of

the Agents being in the area of the gambling club.

He was

given a pretext reason.

PATRONO identified several cars

parked in the area as

belonging to known Dallas gamblers.

Hé also furnished some information as to the activities with-

in the club, maintaining that there was no bookmaking activity

and that the persons in the club were playing poker and gin

rummy only; sometimes for high stakes.

In view of his attitude, further efforts by the

Dallas Office will be made to contact and develop PATRONO

as a possible source or informant.

stated he had been in Miami during this time but refused to

furnish any information concerning his activities there. He

was questioned concerning telephone calls received at his

telephone number from a known South Carolina gambler, PAUL

THOMAS (DL 165-68), and he admitted that such a call had

been received but the call had been placed by THOMAS to a

friend of OWENS from Miami who was in Dallas at

the time.

DAVIS denied any interstate communications for gambling

purposes or any interstate

travel for same. He refused

to discuss his wagering activity.

He was questioned con-

cerning his gambling debt of an alleged amount of $18000

owed by him to Baton Rouge, Louisiana, gambler FRANK

(DL 165-118). DAVIS would

only comment that he had taken

care of the matter and that he had lost the money in a poker.

game in which VUCI was supposed to have been his partner.

He stated that although the stories around town had stated

the amount was $18,000, it was actually $5,000. OWENS made

a comment to the Bureau Agents which possibly reflects the

attitude of numerous Dallas gamblers, to wit, "Are you guys

bothering the other gamblers as much

as you are bothering

me?"

He then went on to explain that anyone connected

with

gambling in Dallas is quite upset

over the intensified

efforts of the FBI and IRS in checking all gambling activities

in Dallas.

on 3/28/63, ANTHONY,

CATERINE, subject of Dallas

Texts

Tile 143-24 was interviewed by Bureau Agents at his place

of business.

CATERINE admitted having ordered and purchased

the numerous items of gambling equipment consisting mostly

of marked playing cards

and loaded

dice which had been found

in his apartment recently by Dallas police officers.

claimed he had purchased these several years ago from a

company in Chicago and

had used them to

"cheat suckers" in

poker games in the Dallas area two or three years ago.

He

claimed that after he had made some money through these

efforts he suddenly decided to quit because he was afraid

if he continued he might get into trouble with some other

gambler who would discover his activities. CATERINE appeared

to be cordial and cooperative and further contacts with him

will be conducted by the Dallas Office in an effort to develop

him as an informant or source of information. He is an

operator of a private drinking club in Dallas and therefore,

in a

position to be of possible assistance

to the Bureau,

at his place of business. ZIMMERMAN's name and phone number

had been found among the effects of Dallas bookmakers SHERMAN

FRANKLIN LITTLE and MARVIN COX (DL 165-129) when they were

arrested by the Dallas PD Vice Squad 2/20/63, based on informa=

tion furnished by the Dallas Office.

ZIMMERMAN freely admitted

his wagering activities with the subjects and furnished

pertinent information concerning their activities.

He

appeared to be quite cooperative and stated he would assist

the Bureau in the investigation of LITTLE and COX. As a

result of this contact, a new. 137 case is being opened con-

cerning ZIMMERMAN and further contacts will be made with

him in accordance with

Bureau instructions.

On 4/3/63, GEORGE FREDERICK RECHENBERG (DL 162-210),

was interviewed for the third time by Bureau Agents concerning

gambling activities in the dallas Division and specifically

those of snown Dallas gamblers RUSSELL DOUGLAS, MATTHEWS and

JOHN ELIASTONE and STONE's associates. RECHENBERG furnished

a great deal of pertinent information concerning these men

Texas

and their activities and information received concerning

MATTHEWS was used as a basis for opening a new ITAR - Gambling

case concerning MATTHEWS.

Dallas has submitted a letter to

the Bureau in connection with this matter.

Because of the

above, a new 137 case has been opened concerning RECHENBERG

and it is believed because of his vast knowledge of gambling

activities in Dallas as well as his close association with

bookmakers in Dallas, he can be of value

to the Bureau,

A review of the Dallas Interview Program to date

reflects that in many instances pertinent information has

been obtained and several potentially good sources have

been developed.

It has also been noted that the Program

has created an uneasy atmosphere among the gambling element

in the Dallas area.

This discreet pressure along with

intensified investigation will be maintained by the Dallas

Division.
