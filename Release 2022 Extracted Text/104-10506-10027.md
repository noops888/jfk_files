Photographed in Mexico City in October 1963

"Unidentified Man"

1. Photographs of the unidentified man were taken Ly
our Mexico City Station on 2,3,4, and 15 October 1963, going
into or coming out of both the Cuban and Soviet Embassies in
Mexico City. Copies were provided to the FBI in Dallas,
Texas on 22 November 1963.- Although cropped copies have
appeared in various works, including Volume XX, page 691, of

the Warren Commission Report, and the book "Appointment in

Dallas", to our knowledge the individual has never beenz
identified.

2. On 17 March 1977, a former member of the Cuban General
Directorate of Intelligence (DGI) recognized photographs of
the unidentifid man as Yuri LNU, a KGR officer, whom he met
in Moscow in 1964 while attending an intelligence course
there. He said that Yuri, a fluent English and Spanish
speaker, was acting as a trouble shooter for the Cukan groun,

about 15, attending the course. Yuri lived with

the Cuban and Bulgarian groups quartered in the same bu‘lding

. in Moscow. Any time the Cubans had a problem, Yuri would solve
it for them, Yuri was a good friend of Juan (pseudo) a KGB

officer who taught the Cubans about the Agency (CIA) and the

West German intelligence apparatus. Juan told the DGI member
that he had served in Mexico for about 20 years and in the U.S.
clandestinely for about 10 years (specific dates unknown), Yuri
was entrusted with their welfare only, and did not attend classes
with the Cuban group.

3. SE/X travel records were reviewed in search of an
individual by the name of Yuri who possibly fit the description

of the unidentified man. This tead to an individual by the

name of Yuriy Ivanovich MOSKALEV, a Sovet, reportedly a Doctor
of Medical Sciences, who has participated in international
scientific conferences for the USSR since 1962 or earlier.
Although there is no official 201 file on MOSKALEV, there is a
sizable dossier on him in the Central Reference Service. Many
of the documents in his dossier are OO reports from U.S.
scientists concerning MOSKALEV's attendance and behavior at
scientific meetings. It is obvious that he has a much greater
knowledge of the English language than he admits. His capability
is said to improve greatly after a few drinks; however, it is
noted that he rarely, if ever, drank at the scientific meetings.
It is also noted that on _ occasions he reportedly was not
qualified to represent the Soviets at a particular conference.

His papers rarely, if ever, were specific, or presented new data.

Following are items of interest from selected documents in
MOSKALEV's CRS dossier:

a. In 1961 PENKOVSKY identified a photo (with no
name provided) as that of Col. Yuriy Ivanovich MOSKALEVSKIY,
Air Force Col.and GRU officer in the Information Directorate
of the GRU. a

b. In December 1963 the FBI reported that Vladimir
Ivanovich BUBNOV, an attache at the Soviet Mission to the U.N,
and a GRU employee (described as a courier and greeter), met
Prof. Yuriy Ivanovich MOSKALEV. of the Institute of Biophysics
in Moscow, and Prof. Viktor Ivanodich IVANOV of the Moscow Physical-
Technical Institute, at New York International Airport sometime
in October 1963, in a plane arriving from Europe.  MOSKALEV and
IVANOV reportedly were not known to BUBNOV, Because of the
circumstances surrounding the meeting, however, the informant was
convinced that both MOSKALEV and IVANOV were GRU agents. They
were ain the U.S. to visit the Brookhaven National Laboratory,
Long Island.

c. In October 1963 MOSKALEV was a delegate to the
IAEA Symposium on Neutron Irradiation, Brookhaven, Long Island,
New York. Described by U.S. scientists as very sharp, MOSKALEV
was a frequent commentator on other people's work and made
a practice of denigrating their reports with respect to
radiation lethality.

d. In October 1967 MOSKALEV participated in the Second
International Symposium on Delayed Effects of Bone Seeking Radio

Nuclides, Sun Valley, Idaho, arriving two days early. He

his knowledge of the Bog lish language to pel along on his own.
Although he complained about not tnowing much English. he
admitted writing the English version of the paper he presented.
MOSKALEV at’empted to make propaganda of a paner by a West
German scientist. A respected U.S: scientist said he fran‘ly
did not believe MOSKALEV's findings. MOSKALEV took copious
notes on all papers, which indicated he understood what was
going on. He also took many pictures with a 35 mm camera.
From questions MOSKALEV asked, it was obvious that he "new
English quite well. Although considerable time. was spent
arranging for MOSKALEV to visit a U.S. laboratory en route to
his home, he took a different route, without telling anyone
of his plans, and did not visit the lat. /The BUFNOV. cited
in para 3-b. who met MOSKALEV’ entered the GRU in September
1960; gradnated from the Chemical War“are Academy (specialized
in chemical warfare); was assigned to the U.N. in New york
from 1962 to 66; and as Second Secretary of Soviet Embassy,
Wash., D.C. from Avril 1969 to April 1974. According to FBI
reporting, BUBNOV was the Soviet handler in a double agent
operation during his previous Washington tour. IN May 1972
BUBNOV wanted classified USAF documents.. Also, in May 72 an
FBI source placed a package in Fairfax County containing
undeveloped. classified U.S. military documents: 35 mm.
QUESTION? Could that 35 mm film have been talen by MOSKALEV?/
e. In August 1971 the U.S. Embassy in Moscow reported
a visit to the Embassy on 16 August of Dr. Sutherland, a
geologist, who sought advice concerning the troubling
behavior toward him of certain USSR Academy of Sciences

officials. Sutherland arrived in Moscow on 15 August 1971



Lies

and contactedMuriy MOSKALEV in the Forcizn Relations
Department.. MOSKALEV had / previously7 visited Sutherland
to clear up some confusion concerning Sutherland's travel
arrangements to Novosibirsk, MOSKALEV said that a colleague
from the Foreign Relations Section would visit Sutherland.

Sutherland was visited by a man who identified himself as a

"linguist", rather than a scientist, and asted if Sutierland
had any non-scientific books with him. There was quite an
exchange. The Embassy report commented that the incident
appeared tocbe a bypical bit of KGB han’y-panky.

f. 12 May 1973 information from the U.S. Embassy
files Moscow, reported that Yuriy Iosifovich (sic) MOSKALEV
was probably head of the American Section. Foreign Relations
Department of Sciences and possibly KGB. There is some
indication that he tried via inducements to get a dual
national, Soviet wife of a U.S. scientist, to remain in the USSR.

4. On 23 March 1977 several identification experts of
the Disguise and Identification Section of OTS/GAD compared
photos of the unidentified man with photos of HME Yuriy
Ivanovich MOSKALEV from the vor, (Gritish’ ete and CRS.

It was their opinion that MOSKALEV could very likely be
identifiable with the unidentified man.

5.° Page 59 of the book "Appointment in Dallas." shows an
Identi-Kit Model composite of an individual who told the
author in London in 1972 that he was involved in the assassination
of President Kennedy. The composite of that individual (code
name "Saul"), whose real name is unknown to the author, bears
a striking resemblance to the photos of Yuriy Ivanovich
MOSKALEV. According to the author "Saul" identified the

picture shown in the Warren Commission Exhitit #237 as

having been taken al the Russian Embassy in Mexico City,

either in the foyer or just outside.

6. The author of the aforementioned book, Hugh C. McDonald,
is the inventor of the Identi-Kit and at one time was under
contract to CIA in regard to the Identi-Kit. McDonald claims
in his book that he met "Saul" at an office in CIA Headquarters
sometime after the Bay of Pigs invasion, and that a colleague
of McDonald told him that "saul" was an assassin.

7. There are striking parallels between the backgrounds

of "Saul" as given in McDonald's book, and MOSKALEV. For example:
