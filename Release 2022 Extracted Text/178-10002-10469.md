This memorandum is for your informa-

tion.

2.

In connection with Task Force l efforts to split the

Cuban

leadership,

some

time ago we targeted Juana: Castro Ruz,

halfesisterofFidel.and Raul Castro-Ruz.

A number of reports

have been received indicating that

Juana Castro tRuz opposed

the strong communist nature of the

Cuban regime and was

prepared,

at least to some extent, to cooperate with anti-

regime elements. In May 1962 we reestablished contact with and

and a long time personal

Iriend of Juana: Castro Ruzi

On 11, June 1962, on our

instructions,

proceeded to Havana where she maintained frequent contact

with Jua√±a.Cas.tro.Ruz and other

prominent Cuban leaders until

1 July 1952.

She discussed the current regime quite frankly

with

Juaha Castro Ruz and,

according to

she

obtained Juana's agreement to provide intelligence on the

Cuban political leadership and

to work

against the Cuban

communist regime, short of

engaging in activity which might

result

in

direct personal harm tophencbrothers: Raulpand Fidel.

According

to

Juania has agreed

to proceed

to

Mexico

the l

Onited States

In

this connection and return to

Cuba after discussions with

"the Americans"

4. He are making the necessary arrangements with

to have Juana Castroshuz proceed to Mexico as

soon as possible in order that we may attempt. a direct re-

cruitment.

You will be kept advised of any future develop-

ments of importance in this

case.
