‘money we had given him for his round-trip ticket’ ($950,00) i
was enough. This, for the record, represents an outlay

Of the above, A/1 felt that GUIN, ACEF) The WIEVES; NATANIQ)
and EUEINAS\were the most dependable. The degree to
which (Juan ALMEIDA could be trusted wag questioned by A/1.
In addition to the above names which A/l volunteered, he
asked about ‘Hajor DIAZ-AR , \Major Tony CASTELS and
[Major Faure CHOMON. A/1 stated that he felt ‘DIAZ-AlGUELLES:
| ke ind his brother "7. could be used and were trustworthy;
ver, ASTEL aud_CHOMON, on the other hand, would not be utilized
bed in the initial efforts by AMLASH, but, if his efforts were

lie

aml successful, they could be counted on to support LASH in the
Avot period which followed. They would never be taken into’ the
Peele "infer-sanctun", however. When asked about Maj: ors Pedro)

6. In addition to the above information, the
undersigned discussed various aspects of the AMLASI case,
and in particular, questioned A/l about AMLASH's frame of '
mind and future plans which he may have revealed to A/l f
after Ontrich departed the scene. A/} made several points,
: which basically boiled down to the fact that AMLASH was
still not pleased with the support he was getting from the i
USG side. The visit with DAINOLND, who acted in the capacity t
of a representative of high levels of the Govt concerned 7
with the Cuban problem, satisfied AMLASH as far as policyy i.
was concerned , but he was not af all happy with the fact : |
that he still was not given the technical assistance for | i
the operational plan as he saw it. A/l said that AMLASH k
dwelt constantly on this point. He could not understand 4
why he was denied certain small pieces of equipment which f H
promised a final solution to the problem, while, on the
other hand, the USG gave mich equipment and money to exile i |
Groups for their ineffective excursions against Cuban mi eee

coastal targets, According to A/1, AMLASH feels strongly
on this point, and if he does not get advice and matertals

from USG technician, he will probably become fed-up again,
and we will lose whatever progress we have made to date.
A/l stated that AMLASN now has hie feet wet vis-a-vis
cooperating with USG and has accepted the fact that he will
Work profitably and securely with it. It is this that we
stand to lose with our procrastination. AMLASH also
talked about going to. the French terrorist group, the OAS,
in order to get the materials and guidance he needs. It
is believed. that he was talked out of this idea, after the
dangers involved were discussed with AMLASH.

7. With regard to the radio gear, AMLASH stated
that he did not feel that he wanted to take one in with
him, particularly in view of the recent arrests in Cuba
of agents carrying concealed radios. Tle was not opposed,
however, at this time to havingza radio cached for him,
to be recovered by him later,

8. According.to AMMHIP, 1f there is any interest
in having AMLASH Link up with other trusted assets in
Cuba, these names would have to be Given to him beyore he
returned; otherwise he would not trust any other means
used later inside to get hin to initiate or respond to such
contacts. }

t : 9. A/l stated that AMLASI talked about getting
aid from, or at least discussing his position, with
Manolo RAY. However, ho stated that he questioned whether
this was the best idea, since if RAY came to Paris while
he (LASH) was there, people would conclude that there was.
something between the two, Another spot wouid be better,
thought AMLASH,

10, At the time of A/l's departure, AMLASH
said that he would contact "Jack" (Red Stent, Paris
staffer) upon his return to Paris. (This he subsequently
did on the 15th of November, according to info received
from Paris-somewhat belatedly).

ll. When AMLASH, A/1I, and VENEGAS were together
in Rome and Italy, VENEGAS told AMLASH that people were

betting that LASH would not return to Cuba. Some had also
questioned his mother on this point. AMLASH reportedly
told VENEGAS to cover all the hets he could as he would
be a rich man. (It was at this time, according to A/l,
that AMLASH decided that ne had better return to Havana

a@ little sooner than he intelied, in fact almost as s00n
a6 possible.)

12, AMLASE talked about the two possibilities
of re-taking Cuba - eithor thru invasion by US troops, or
his way. He also realized, however, that invasion was
not to be considered seriously at this tine. Also, ANLASII
talked about his ability to take some men into the hills
of Las Villas Province and taking the small toms of
Trinidad and Topes de Collantes. fe said that he and hié

jt made the govt
forces wuch nore formidable than in Batista's timo. AMLASIL

that this was the way to set Up a provisional rebel govt
and thereby invite and gain US support, By the way A/1
talked, it ts fairly certain that AMLASH realized that
thie was not the kind of a Plan which could even remotely
be expected to receive USG aid. It 1s hoped that he

does realize that jlavana must first be taken... or fatling
that, a trucly sizablo piece of Jand (say, almost an '
entire province) which could be a crue rallying point and
staging ground under couplece Rebel control, from which
the rest of tne island could be wrested from the Fidelistas
and the Conmunists,

13. In summary, the talks with A/1 led the
undersigned to believe that AMLASH is again entering
one of his skeptical woods, one which our actions have
done little to dispel. Too little and too late.......
