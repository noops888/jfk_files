(4) Regarding the use of the Lie detector
I told Rocha I was not interested in bow the sub-
Sect bad broached vith thes but felt if they were
at all seriously interested in the security of their
orgintzatios, I found it hard to believe how they
could afford not to take advantage of thia aid to
keep themselves from being penetrated. The Agency
is certainly concerned over the possibility that
a group with which thiplare coopanting could be
perotrated and he, Rocha, as the group leader should

be even wore concern egpocially whon he is re-

sponaible for the livee of individuals in hostile

fee] this was sufficient? I continued that he

knew ts well as 1 that the communists were capable
of penetrating at rather high levels, as proven by
known cases vaten Save been uncovered, Further=
nore, I continued, as a responsible leader he should
find it difficult] to ask his men to undertake nome-
thing he would it ¢o himself, after all this is a
basic principal of gocd leadsrahip. This approach
visibly rocked Rocha especially with Lasa nodding

profusely in agreexent (This fellow Lasa must be
kept sround as a prop). Rocka then related the story
of how even the Jenutte have beon penetrated, Again,
T asked Rocha to consider the Lio detector tysts on
the baste of an aid for their ovn protection.

(3) Finances: Rocha expressed hope that we
would not continue the present system of requesting
funds by written memorandua for each expenditures
Ee conplained this involved mich payer work, and many
times because of thealay in receiving approval,
