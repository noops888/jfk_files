SUBJECT: Soviet Volunteer Allegations Re Oswald
Involvement in Kennedy Assassination 4/-v:

1. On 31 December 1991, a Soviet,,volunteer to Warsaw
Station, Boris Vladimirovich ZHURA\ , Claimed that Lee
Harvey OSWALD was in fact a Ukrainian KGB intel source (code
name Velktor) who had additionally been a controlled agent
of the UKGB. ZHURAVLEV stated that OSWALD had actively
conspired with two former US presidents to assassinate
former President Kennedy. ZHURAVLEV when pressed could not
provide any additional information. This information was
transmitted to Headquarters in a staff channel message with _
no LIMIT or RYBAT control. We-have taken immediate steps to -
have this message removed from the message system to prevent
further access to it.

2. As background, ZHURAVLEV is an unvetted volunteer
who walked-in to Warsaw Station on 30 December claiming to
be a former KGB officer with access to leads concerning
Western agents of the KGB. The above information was
obtained during the second meeting with him when the Station
was attempting to obtain details on the alleged leads to
which he claimed access. When. pressed to provide
information, he had only one vague agent identification in
Canada and para one above information. He was not able to
provide any other leads despite claiming some twenty years
of service in the KGB.

3. Based upon information yeceived to date, we
consider ZHURAVLEV to be a highly questionable source.
Warsaw describes him as being stressed out, shaking and in
fairly rough physical state; he was considered to be of no
operational interest and to not have further intelligence
value. He departed the Embassy without incident and no
further contact is anticipated.

4. As regards para one allegations, we have
substantive information from IJDECANTER (attached) which
outlines Oswald and wife's KGB connections and emphatically
denies any KGB involvement in dispatching Oswald to
assassinate President Kennedy. We have no information from
any Soviet intel source indicating that the KGB had contact
with Oswald after he returned to the US or that he conspired
with any other element in the assassination. For your
