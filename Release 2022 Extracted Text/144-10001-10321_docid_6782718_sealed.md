PORTUGUESE REACTION TO DEATH OF PRESIDENT KENNEDY

26 Nov. 63

Priority

Msg NI: 75

44 USC 2107(5)(g)(2)(D)(i)

President KENNEDY's untimely death was a great shock to

the Portuguese people and is mourned by all the government and

private citizens alike. The government immediately announced

three days' mourning (the same as for Pope JOHN XXIII) and all

flags on government buildings are at half-mast. The press

has been reporting the event day after day but so far without

editorial comment.

We inquired of the authorities about the effect of KENNEDY's

death on Portugal, and their view may be summed up as being that

the new President will continue KENNEDY's foreign policy and

there will be no particular change regarding Portugal and

in particular the Portuguese colonial problem.
