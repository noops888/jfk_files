President KENNEDY's untimely death was a great shock to
the Portuguese people and is mourned by ail the government and
private citizens alike. The government immediately announced
three days' mourning (the same as for Pope JOHN XXITI) and all
flags on government buildings are at Half-mast. The press
has been reporting the event day aftér day but so far without
editorial comment. .

We inquired of the authorities about the effect of KENNEDY's
death on Portugal, and théir view may be summed up as being that
the new President will continue KENNEDY's foreign pdlicy and
there will be no particular change regarding Portugal and

in particular the Portuguese colonial problem. =
