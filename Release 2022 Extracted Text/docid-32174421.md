From: National Archives and Records Administration
Subject: Reconstructed FBI File (CR) CG 80-724, Serial 13
To: The File

This memorandum briefly summarizes the status of missing original Federal Bureau of
Investigation (FBI) case files or portions of case files in the President John F. Kennedy
Assassination Records Collection (JFK Collection) and documents the National Archives and
Records Administration’s (NARA) efforts to reconstruct these records, where possible, from
duplicate copies of documents located in other FBI files.

As the JFK Collection was first compiled and reviewed in the 1990s, the Assassination Records
Review Board and the FBI designated some’ records as “not believed relevant” (NBR) or “not
assassination related” (NAR). The FBI retained custody of the NBR/NAR records and
postponed their transfer to NARA until a later date. Every document or group of documents
(“serials”), however, received an indexed Record Identification Form (RIF) and FBI inventory
sheet for insertion into the JFK Collection.

In September 2011, several years prior to the 2017 re-review and transfer of the NBR/NAR
material to the National Archives, a flood severely damaged thousands of feet of records at the
FBI's Alexandria Records Center in Alexandria, Virginia. In June 2012, NARA approved the
FBI's request for emergency destruction of 10,000 cubic feet of records that posed significant
airborne health hazards. Among the damaged records were FBI field office files that contained
postponed JFK Collection material designated as “pertaining to a matter unrelated to the JFK
Assassination Investigation” or “not assassination related.”

This compilation represents NARA‘s efforts to reconstruct the original file or portions of the file,
as completely as possible, with duplicate copies of documents located in the FBI field office and
headquarters files within the JFK Collection. Each reconstructed file or compilation contains a
Record Identification Form, an explanatory cover memo, existing administrative documents
available within the JFK Collection, and copies of identified duplicate documents. The table
below summarizes the status of FBI file (CR) CG 80-724, Serial 13.
