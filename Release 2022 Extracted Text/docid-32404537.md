DCI Sources and Methods Authority With Respect

to JFK Assassination Records

1.

Per your request, I have attached a copy of the

President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act of

1992

(ARCA), Pub. L. 102-526, 106 Stat. 3443-3458, reprirted at

44 U.S.C. §

2107 note.

For your convenience, I have higriighted

the pertinent provisions that

will aid in responding to an

inquiry regarding the statute's effect on the DCI's statutory

authority to protect intelligence sources and methods.

2. The clear language and intent of the law is to supersede

statutes that prohibit disclosure of information, except for some

irrelevant subject areas, such as tax records.

The statute

provides that "it shall take precedence over

any other law

(except section 6103 of the Internal Revenue Codel, judicial

decision construing such law, or common law doctrine that would

otherwise prohibit" the disclosure of information subject to the

ACE.

ARCA § 11(a).

This language, taken with the provisions

discussed below

which limit the intelligence sources and methods

that may be protected and set a strict procedural scheme by which

information is to be reviewed under the ARCA, effectively

supersedes the DCI's National Security Act authority with respect

to intelligence sources and methods information subject to the

3. Section 6 of the ARCA provides the grounds for which the

release of information may be "postponed."

contemplates that all information will eventually be released.

Indeed, it specifies that all information will be made available

to the public no later than 25 years after the passage of the

ARCA (which occurred in October 1992) unless the president

certifies that continued postponement is necessary.

ARCA

§ 4(g) (2) (D) .

With respect to intelligence-related information,

ARCA allows postponement if:

" (1) the threat to ... intelligence operations ... is

of such gravity that it outweighs the public interest, and

such public disclosure would reveal-.

Dear John:

A few months ago we made a request to the Department of Defense for, inter alia,

"Any available MOUs or MOAs defining command responsibilities and

lines of authority, responsibility and accountability when individuals of

the Central Intelligence Agency serve under 'military cover, i.e., are

employed and operate for the CIA while wearing the uniform of the

armed services: (Applicable period of interest here is 1956-64.)*

This letter is our official notification to you that we have made the above stated request.

We understand that the Agency was advised of this request by the Department of

Defense at the time the request was made. We do, however, apologize for our

inadvertent error in not having provided you with a contemporaneous notification.

Sincerely,

Dear Director Tenet:

In accordance with the President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act

made additional formal determinations concerning the public disclosure of CIA

records at its meeting on December 15, 1997.

decisions were premised on several factors, including the historical interest in the

documents and the absence of evidence that the release of the information would cause

harm to the United States or to any individual.

You have seven days to appeal these decisions to the President. You are invited to send

your representative to the Review Board to examine our copies of the documents for

which determinations have been made and to discuss the determinations with my staff.

CONNIDENTIAL

Assassination Records Review Board

Review Guidelines

for Information Relating to Official Cover

This document sets forth the review guidelines for use by the Assassination Records Review Board

("Board" or "ARRB") and the Central Intelligence Agency ("CIA" or "Agency") for public release of

certain information concerning the identity, scope, details, and specific mechanisms of official cover

(hereafter "official cover details"). These guidelines have been officially adopted by the Board to serve the

public interest in making the complete story of the JFK assassination available while protecting from

official disclosure information which would be harmful to the national security and is properly classified

under Executive Order 12958.

1. Information in documents originated by the Congress (most often in the context of personal

statements to committees or committee staffs) which sets forth official cover details shall be presumptively

released unless it sets forth specific information not generally known to the public or the Agency shall be

able to demonstrate that it has taken affirmative action to prevent the disclosure of such information in the

past and that release here would cause identifiable damage to the national security.

2. Information in documents originated by the Executive Branch (including those designated by the

parties as quasi-executive branch documents which reflect extracts from the records of the Executive

Branch) which sets forth official cover details shall be presumptively postponed to the extent that it

concerns:

identification of the official cover provider,

specific locations used for official cover, and

identity, scope, details and mechanisms of any particular official cover.

3. Information in such documents which the Executive Branch has taken an affirmative act to

officially disclose or allow to be disclosed shall be presumed to be releasable.

4. Moreover, information in such documents which relates to individuals who are considered

important to the story of the assassination shall, consistent with past practice, be considered for release on

an individual basis with the Agency having a higher standard of proof of damage to the national security.

5. For any information postponed pursuant to these Guidelines, the Agency agrees to provide a

summary or substitution which preserves the content and relevance of the postponed information.

Neither these guidelines nor the release of documents pursuant to these guidelines shall be deemed

to constitute an official Executive Branch acknowledgment of the identity, scope, details, and specific

mechanisms of official cover in other information disclosure law matters.

For the Assassination Records Review Board:

said the right thing about "working

things continue to move forward quickly.

attached is the ARRB's "review guidelines" received last

night and our what will be our hand-written slight suggested

modifications

... and ... most important ... our interpretive

memo.

our lawyers have

reviewed and find them legally identical.

THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT THIS AGREEMENT PRESERVES THE SECRECT RE

OFFICIAL COVER AND THERE WILL BE NO OFFICIAL ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OF

ANY SPECIFIC COVER AS A RESULT OF A RELEASE OF EXECUTIVE BRANCH

DOCUMENTS BY THE ARRB.

let me know soonest your thoughts (out Friday COB is

target)... especially if you want anything included in our memo

(the review guidelines belong to them so the thought was suggest

as few changes as possible AND put any clarifying language we

want in our interpretive memo) .

lastly, as for the second "legal" memo for Calder/Kennedy

signature, we can also incorporate any changes but my sense is

the staff

and Board are fairly comfortable with it so it does not

appear to be of overarching necessity to make changes.

Substitute language or a summary will be used for all postponements. The

substitutions will preserve the context and relevance of the information. (E.g.,

"official cover" or "location" or "details of cover arrangements.")

For Congressional documents. Cover information will be released unless the

information explains details of the scope of official cover or important details

about the mechanisms of official cover that is not generally known to the public.

Information shall not be released if the Executive Branch shall be able to

demonstrate that it has taken affirmative action to prevent the disclosure of such

information in the past and that release here would cause identifiable damage to

national security.

For Executive Branch documents and "derivative" documents. Information

generally will be released except:

a.

the substitute language "official cover" will be used for the actual official

cover,

b.

substitute language will be-used in lieu.of the details of official.cover.or the

c.

the cover status of certain high-profile individuals will be released when

disclosure has previously been permitted by affirmative official acts of the

Executive Branch of the US govemment;

be released unless the information reveals or would reasonably imply the

existence of otherwise postponable information.

The Review Board shall continue to retain the final authority to make "formal

describe the approach the Board intends to follow, whenever a document

presents an issue that is not resolvable under these guidelines or to the extent

Dear Mr. Gunn:

Re: Release or Postponement of "Official Cover" Information

This letter is intended to confirm our understanding of the

recent "review guidelines" promulgated by the Assassination

Records Review Board ("Board" or "ARRB") for public release of

certain information concerning the identity, scope, details, and

specific mechanisms of official cover (hereafter "official

cover

details"). This understanding is based on the prefatory

negotiations between our respective staffs and reflects the

agreement of all concerned agencies

and departments within the

Executive Branch. Please note that we have included a classified

addendum which presents examples of some of the following

understandings.

1. It is the intent of the staff of the Board and the

federal agencies that these guidelines should serve the public

interest by making the complete story of the JFK assassination

available while protecting from official disclosure information

which would be harmful to the national security and is properly

classified under Executive Order 12958.

2.

Information in documents originated by the Congress

(most often in the context of personal statements to committees

or committee

staffs) which sets forth official cover details

shall be presumptively released unless it sets forth specific

information not generally known to the public or the Executive

Branch is able to demonstrate that it has taken affirmative

action to prevent the disclosure of similar or identical

information in another context in the past and that release here

would cause identifiable damage to the national security.

3. Information in documents originated by the Executive

Branch

(including those

designated by the parties as quasi-

executive branch documents which reflect extracts from the

records of the Executive Branch) which sets forth official cover

details shall be presumptively postponed to the extent that it

concerns:

• identity or identification of the official cover

provider,

• specific locations used for official cover, and

• scope, details and mechanisms of any particular

official cover.

4. Information in such documents which the Executive Branch

has taken an affirmative act to officially disclose or allow to

be disclosed shall be presumed to be releasable; however, in no

event shall extrinsic evidence by inference or deductive

reasoning be deemed to qualify for this provision.

5.

Further, information in such documents which relates to

individuals who are considered important to the story of the

assassination shall, consistent with past practice, be considered

for release on an individual basis with the Executive Branch

having a higher standard of proof of damage to the national

security.

6. For any information postponed pursuant to the review

guidelines, the concerned Executive Branch agency or department

agrees to provide an unclassified summary or substitution which

preserves the general content and

relevance of the postponed

information.

these guidelines shall be deemed to constitute an official

Executive Branch acknowledgment of the identity, scope, details,

and specific mechanisms of official cover in other information

disclosure law matters.

8. It is the understanding of the Executive Branch that no

release under the authority of the JFk Act shall be

deemed to constitute official executive acknowledgment in other

information disclosure law matters unrelated to the Act.

Your acknowledgment of receipt and concurrence below would

be greatly appreciated.

Department of State

Washington, D.C. 20520

Dear Mr. Talbott:

I am writing in response to your December 17, 1997 security-classified letter to

Assassination Records Review Board Chairman John R. Tunheim. Inasmuch as the

Executive Director is the statutorily designated liaison of the Review Board to Federal

agencies, I am taking the liberty of responding to you directly.

Your letter identified State Department interests in several records that are scheduled

for an upcoming Review Board meeting. Although the Review Board is well aware of

the general interest that you describe in your letter, the Board has not received evidence (or

argument) from the State Department regarding the particular records at issue. Even if the

Board were to agree with the general propositions stated in your letter, it is not clear

that the opening of the documents at issue would release any information that is not

already effectively in the public domain.

The Review Board strongly urges the Department of State to provide evidence that is

specific to the documents at issue. I would be pleased to make arrangements for your

designated representative to review the specific records so that he or she might provide

evidence that would assist the Review Board in its decisions.

Most of the Board's decisions--those relating

funding of the Cuban Revolutionary Council--are very

welcome.

have. Meanwhile, I offer the following summary of our

Declaration of Teresa F. Wilcox

I, Teresa F. Wilcox, hereby declare and say as follows:

1. (AIUO) I am the Information Review Officer (IRO) for the

Directorate of Science and Technology (DS&T)

I was appointed to

his position in February 1996, and have held various professional

positions within the Central Intelligence Agency since 1985.

responsible for the review of records maintained by offices in the

DS&T, to include the Offices of the Deputy Director

(FBIS);

the Office of Development and Engineering (OD&E); the Office of

Advanced Analytic Tools

(AAT); the Office of Advanced Projects

(OAP); and the Office of Research and

Development (ORD).

addition, I am responsible for

searching and reviewing certain

records of the former National Photographic Interpretation Center

(NPIC) .

2. (AIUO)

I am aware that the DS&T has searched appropriate

records systems for information responsive

to all requests the DS&T

has received. I have obtained this knowledge through my personal

experience, as well my conversations with, and my review of the

records of, the former DS&T IRO Anthony R. Frasketi, and the DS&T

Information Management Officer, Marsha A. Hubbs.

(AIUO) The following is a

description of DS&T searches

and review of documents undertaken in response to Board taskings

the DS&T has received.

CIA-IR-U7 Claude Barnes Capenart.

The DS&T made

deletions to security records located by the Directorate of

Administration.

The DS&T Searched ODDS&T records for

capehart's medical file.

The DS&T forwarded the medical file

to the Board for its review.

The DS&T reviewed a

package of documents

forwarded by Barry

Harrelson.

The DS&T

advised the Board it had no objection to ARRB access.

CIA-IR-15 Electronic 'take' from Mexico City Station.

This memorandum addresses

the portion of the action, "Ir

addition, the Board is still awaiting a response on

Regardless of the

outcome of these particular searches, the Review Board

continues to seek a full accounting for all surveillance

conducted during the relevant time periods."

In conducting a search for the above information, the

DS&T located in OTS records a file with the folder title,

"Mexico City,

Mexico."

We forwarded the entire contents

of

that folder for the period 24 May 1961

to 10 June 1965, with

one exception.

Three Operational Monthly Reports were

forwarded to the Board.

The dates covered were 1-30 September

1963; 1-31 October 1963; and 1-30 November 1963.

The

attachment to Dispatch HMMA 20307 dated 4 December 1962 was

a poor-quality audio tape in Spanish,

between two individuals

talking about office procedures. No

substantive information was exchanged during this

conversation.

Directorate of Operations (DO). We reviewed old Do Records

Retirement Requests; there are no shelflists (folder-

inventory) associated with these Records Retirement Requests

since the Division D records were recorded initially in the DO

We forwarded for the Board's review the six Records

Retirement Request whose job numbers reflected the years 1959

to 1962.

We advised the Board that Records Center records

indicated the records' disposition as follows:

1. 59-5-477: Destroyed September 1977.

2. 60-S-182R: Destroyed May 1980.

3.

Transferred to FI/D(DDO), December 1977.

4. 61-S-157R: Four boxes transferred to FI/D (DDO), March

(DS&T) .

These were the only Records Retirement Requests in the

possession

of OTC that are

in the time frame relevant to the

JFK assassination.

As their descriptions indicate, they do

not appear relevant to the request.

The DS&T also conducted a search of CITO records. This

DS&T office inherited some

files from OTC when CITO was

established.

We searched its records in the event some

Division D records were held by CITO. These searches

identified no responsive records.

Searches of OTS, OTC, and CITO records used the following

keywords:

surveil*

Russian

USSR

Cuba*

audio*
