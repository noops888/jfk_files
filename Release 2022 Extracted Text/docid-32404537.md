MEMORANDUM FOR: David P. Holmes
Deputy General Counsel

FROM: Robert J.. Eatinger. Jr.
Assistant General Counsel
Litigation Division, OGC

SUBJECT: DCI Sources and Methods Authority With Respect
to JFK Assassination Records

1. Per your request, I have attached a copy of the
President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act of
1992 (ARCA), Pub. L. 102-526, 106 Stat. 3443-2458, reprinted at
44 U.S.C. § 2107 note. For your convenience, I have highiighs
the pertinent provisions that will aid in re nding to an
inquiry regarding the statute's effect on the DCI's statutory
authority to protect intelligence sources and methods.

d

2. The clear language and intent of the law is to supersede
statutes that prohibit disclcsure of information, except for some
irrelevant subject areas, such as tax records. The statute
provides that "it shall take precedence over any other law
(except section 6103 of the Internal Revenue Code), judicial
decision construing such law, or common law doctrine that would
otherwise prohibit" the disclosure of information subject to the
Act. ARCA § 11(a). This language, taken with the provisions
discussed below which limit the intelligence sources and methods
that may be protected and set a strict procedural scheme by which
information is to be reviewed under the ARCA, effectively
supersedes the DCI's National Security Act authority with respect
to intelligence sources and methods information subject to the
ARCA.

3. Section 6 of the ARCA provides the grounds for which the
release of information may be "postponed." The statute
contemplates that all information will eventually be released.
Indeed, it specifies that all information will be made available
to the public no later than 25 years after the passage of the
ARCA (which occurred in October 1992) unless the president
certifies that continued postponement is necessary. ARCA
§ 4(g) (2) (D). With respect to intelligence-related information,
ARCA allows postponement if: E

"(1) the threat to ... intelligence operations ... is
of such gravity that it outweighs the public interest, and
such public disclosure would reveal--

SUBJECT: DCI Sources and Methods Authority With Respect to JFK
Assassination Records

(A) an intelligence agent whose identity currently
requires protection;

(B) an intelligence source or method which is
currently utilized, or reasonably expected to be
utilized, by the United States Government and which has
not been officiall isclosed, the disclosure of which
would interfere with the conduct of intelligence
activities; or

(C) any other matter currently relating to ...
intelligence operations ... the disclosure of which
would demonstrably impair the natiozal security of the
United States."

ARCA § 6(1) (Emphasis added. )

4. The originating agency is to make the first review to
identify information that meets the standards for postponement.
ARCA § 4(c)(2)(D) (i). For CIA, this effort is being undertaken
by the Historical Review Group, in consultati with the
Directorate of Operations and other appropri Agency
components. Information the originating agencies identify for
postponement must be transmitted to the Review Board. ARCA
§ 4(c) (2) (E). The Review Board "shall consider and render
decisions on a determination by a Government office to seek to
postpone the disclosure of assassination reccrds." ARCA §

7(i) (1). Specifically, the "Review Board shail consider and
render decisions on ... whether an assassination record or
particular information in a record qualifies for postponement of
Gisclosure under the Act." ARCA § 7(i) (2) (B).

5. If the Review Board determines to order the disclosure
of information that the originating agency feit met the criteria
for postponement, it "shall notify the head of the originating
body of its determination and publish a copy of the determination
in the Federal Register within 14 days after the determination is
made." ARCA § 9(c) (4) (A). If the information contained in an
assassination record is "obtained or developed solely within the
executive branch, the President shall have the sole and
nondelegable authority to require the disclosure or postponement
of ... the information under the standards set forth in
Section 6." ARCA § 9(d)(1) (emphasis added). The President's
decision must be certified to the Review Board within 30 days of
the Review Boards determination. Id. Records postponed by the
President must be re-reviewed every 5 years. ARCA § 9(d) (2).

Dear John:
A few months ago we made a request to the Department of Defense for, inter alia,

“Any available MOUs or MOAs defining command responsibilities and
lines of authority, responsibility and accountability when individuals of
the Central Intelligence Agency serve under ‘military cover,’ i.e., are
employed and operate for the CIA while wearing the uniform of the
armed services.’ (Applicable period of interest here is 1956-64.)”

This letter is our official notification to you that we have made the above-stated request.
We understand that the Agency was advised of this request by the Department of
Defense at the time the request was made. We do, however, apologize for our
inadvertent error in not having provided you with a contemporaneous notification.

Sincerely,
Caio

Assassination Records Review Board
Review Guidelines
for Information Relating to Official Cover _

This document sets forth the review guidelines for use by the Assassination Records Review Board
(“Board” or “ARRB”) and the Central Intelligence Agency (“CIA” or “Agency”) for public release of
certain information concerning the identity, scope, details, and specific mechanisms of official cover
(hereafter “official cover details”). These guidelines have been officially adopted by the Board to serve the
public interest in making the complete story of the JFK assassination available while protecting from
official disclosure information which would be harmful to the national security and is properly classified
under Executive Order 12958.

1. Information in documents originated by the Congress (most often in the context of personal
statements to committees or committee staffs) which sets forth official cover details shall be presumptively
released unless it sets forth specific information not generally known to the public or the Agency shall be
able to demonstrate that it has taken affirmative action to prevent the disclosure of such information in the
past and that release here would cause identifiable damage to the national security.

2. Information in documents originated by the Executive Branch (including those designated by the
parties as quasi-executive branch documents which reflect extracts from the records of the Executive
Branch) which sets forth official cover details shall be presumptively postponed to the extent that it

concerns: ‘
. identification of the official cover. provider,
. specific locations used for official cover, and
. identity, scope, details and mechanisms of any particular official cover.

3. Information in such documents which the Executive Branch has taken an affirmative act to
officially disclose or allow to be disclosed shall be presumed to be releasable.

4. Moreover, information in such documents which relates to individuals who are considered
important to the story of the assassination shall, consistent with past practice, be considered for release on
an individual basis with the Agency having a higher standard of proof of damage to the national security.

5. For any information postponed pursuant to these Guidelines, the Agency agrees to provide a
summary or substitution which preserves the content and relevance of the postponed information.

Neither these guidelines nor the release of documents pursuant to these guidelines shall be deemed

to constitute an official Executive Branch acknowledgment of the identity, scope, details, and specific
mechanisms of official cover in other information disclosure law matters.

For the Assassination Records Review Board:

Peggy,

as I mentioned, the judge and jeremy came to visit our
office director yesterday .... very pleasant ... and everybody
said the right thing about “working together.”

things continue to move forward quickly.

attached is the ARRB’s “review guidelines” received last
night and our what will be our hand-written slight suggested
modifications ... and ... most important ... our interpretive
memo. our lawyers have reviewed 4nd find them legally identical.
THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT THIS AGREEMENT PRESERVES THE SECRECT RE
OFFICIAL COVER AND THERE WILL BE NO OFFICIAL ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OF
ANY SPECIFIC COVER AS A RESULT OF A RELEASE OF EXECUTIVE BRANCH
DOCUMENTS BY THE ARRB.

let me know soonest your thoughts (out Friday COB is
target)... especially if you want anything included in our memo
(the review guidelines belong to them so the thought was suggest
as few changes as possible AND put any Clarifying language we
want in our interpretive memo).

lastly, as for the second “legal” memo for Calder/Kennedy
signature, we can also incorporate any changes but my sense is
the staff and Board are fairly comfortable with it so it does not
appear to be of overarching necessity to make changes.

thanks,

Lee Strickland

Dear Mr. Gunn:
Re: Release or Postponement of “Official Cover” Information

This letter is intended to confirm our understanding of the
recent “review guidelines” promulgated by the Assassination
Records Review Board (“Board” or “ARRB”) for public release of
certain information concerning the identity, scope, details, and
specific mechanisms of official cover (hereafter “official cover
details”). This understanding is based on the prefatory
negotiations between our respective staffs and reflects the
agreement of all concerned agencies and departments within the
Executive Branch. Please note that we have included a classified
addendum which presents examples of some of the following
understandings.

1. It is the intent of the staff of the Board and the
federal agencies that these guidelines should serve the public
interest by making the complete story of the JFK assassination
available while protecting from official disclosure information
which would be harmful to the mational security and is properly
classified under Executive Order 12958.

2. Information in documents originated by the Congress
(most often in the context of personal statements to committees
or committee staffs) which sets forth official cover details
shall be presumptively released unless it sets forth specific
information not generally known to the public or the Executive

Branch is able to demonstrate that it has taken affirmative
action to prevent the disclosure of similar or identical
information in another context in the past and that release here
would cause identifiable damage to the national security.

NW 65360 Docld:32404537 Page 12


T. Jeremy Gunn, Esquire

3. Information in documents originated by the Executive
Branch (including those designated by the parties as quasi-
executive branch documents which reflect extracts from the
records of the Executive Branch) which sets forth official cover
details shall be presumptively postponed to the extent that it
concerns:

* identity or identification of the official cover
provider,
* specific locations used for official cover, and

* scope, details and mechanisms of any particular
official cover.

4. Information in such documents which the Executive Branch
has taken an affirmative act to officially disclose or allow to
be disclosed shall be presumed to be releasable; however, in no
event shall extrinsic evidence by inference or deductive
reasoning be deemed to qualify for this provision.

5. Further, information in such documents which relates to
individuals who are considered important to the story of the
assassination shall, consistent with Past practice, be considered
for release on an individual basis with the Executive Branch
having a higher standard of proof of damage to the national
security.

6. For any information postponed pursuant to the review
guidelines, the concerned Executive Branch agency or department
agrees to provide an unclassifita summary or substitution which
preserves the general content and relevance of the postponed
information.

7. It is the intent of the Executive Branch that neither
the review guidelines nor the release of documents pursuant to
these guidelines shall be deemed to constitute an official
Executive Branch acknowledgment of the identity, scope, details,
and specific mechanisms of official cover in other information
disclosure law matters.

8. It is the understanding of the Executive Branch that no
release under the authority of the JFK Act shall be
deemed to constitute official executive acknowledgment in other
information disclosure law matters unrelated to the Act.

Your acknowledgment of receipt and concurrence below would
be greatly appreciated.

Dear Mr. Talbott:

Iam writing in response to your December 17, 1997 security-classified letter to
Assassination Records Review Board Chairman John R. Tunheim. Inasmuch as the

Executive Director is the statutorily designated liaison of the Review Board to Federal
agencies, I am taking the liberty of responding to you directly.--—-- a

Your letter identified State Department interests in several records that are scheduled
for an upcoming Review Board meeting. Although the Review Board is well aware of
the general interest that you describe in your letter, the Board has not received evidence (or
argument) from the State Department regarding the particular records at issue. Even if the
Board were to agree with the general propositions stated in your letter, it is not clear
that the opening of the documents at issue would release any information that is not
already effectively in the public domain. j

The Review Board strongly urges the Department of State to provide evidence that is
specific to the documents at issue. I would be pleased to make arrangements for your
designated representative to review the specific records so that he or she might provide
evidence that would assist the Review Board in its decisions.

Declaration of Teresa F. Wilcox

I, Teresa F. Wilcox, hereby’ declare and say as follows:

1. (AIUO) I.am the Information Review Officer (IRO) for the
Directorate of Science and Technology (DS&T). I was appointed to
this position in February 1996, and have held various professional
positions within the Central Intelligence Agency since 1985. I am
responsible for the review of records maintained by offices in the
DS&T, to include the Offices of the Deputy Director for Science and
Technology and the Associate Deputy Director for Science and
Technology; the Office of Technical Service (OTS); the Office of
Technical Collection (OTC); the Clandestine Information Technology
Office (CITO); the Foreign Broadcast Information Service (FBIS);
the Office of Development and Engineering (OD&E); the Office of
Advanced Analytic Tools (AAT); the Office of Advanced Projects
(OAP); and the Office of Research and Development (ORD). In
addition, I am responsible for searching and reviewing certain
records of the former National Photographic Interpretation Center
(NPIC) .

2. (AIUO) I am aware that the DS&T has searched appropriate
records systems for information responsive to all requests the DS&T
has received. I have obtained this knowledge through my personal
experience, as well my conversations with, and my review of the
records of, the former DS&T IRO Anthony R. Frasketi, and the DS&T
Information Management Officer, Marsha A. Hubbs.

at (AIUO) The following is a description of DS&T searches
and review of documents undertaken in response to Board taskings
the DS&T has received.

CIA-IR-07 Claude Barnes Capehart. The DS&T made
deletions to security records located by the Directorate of
Administration. The DS&T Searched ODDS&T records for
Capehart’s medical file. The DS&T forwarded the medical file
to the Board for its review.

CIA-IR-08 Family Jewels Memorandum. The DS&T reviewed a
package of documents forwarded by Barry Harrelson. The DS&T
advised the Board it had no objection to ARRB access.

CIA-IR-15 Electronic ‘take’ from Mexico City Station.
This memorandum addresses the portion of the action, “In
addition, the Board is still awaiting a response on the
present location of Staff D records. Regardless of the
outcome of these particular searches, the Review Board
continues to seek a full accounting for all surveillance

conducted during the relevant time periods.”

In conducting a search for the above information, the
DS&T located in OTS records a file with the folder title,
“Mexico City, Mexico.” We forwarded the entire contents of
that folder for the period 24 May 1961 to 10 June 1965, with
one exception. Three Operational Monthly Reports were
forwarded to the Board. The dates covered were 1-30 September
1963; 1-31 October 1963; and_ 1-30 November 1963. The
attachment to Dispatch HMMA 20307 dated 4 December 1962 was
not included. It was a poor-quality audio tape in Spanish,
between two individuals talking about office procedures. No
substantive information was exchanged during this
conversation.

The DS&T also conducted a search of OTC records.- This
office would have inherited the Division D records of the
Directorate of Operations (DO). We reviewed old DO Records
Retirement Requests; there are no shelflists (folder-
inventory) associated with these Records Retirement Requests
since the Division D records were recorded initially in the DO
system. We forwarded for the Board's review the six Records
Retirement Request whose job numbers reflected the years 1959
to 1962. We advised the Board that Records Center records
indicated the records’ disposition as follows:

59-S-477: Destroyed September 1977.

60-S-182R: Destroyed May 1980.

60-S-402: Transferred to FI/D(DDO), December 1977.
61-S-157R: Four boxes transferred to FI/D (DDO), March
1972; three boxes destroyed, May 1980.

62-S-885: Destroyed (no date given).

62S000986R: Transferred to the Office of SIGINT Operations
(DS&T) .

AU BWNE

These were the only Records Retirement Requests in the
possession of OTC that are in the time frame relevant to the
JFK assassination. As their descriptions indicate, they do
not appear relevant to the request.

The DS&T also conducted a search of CITO records. This
DS&T office inherited some files from OTC when CITO was
established. We searched its records in the event, some
Division D records were held by CITO. These searches”
identified no responsive records.

Searches of OTS, OTC, and CITO records used the following
keywords:

surveil*
Russian
USSR
Cuba*
audio*
electron*
embassy
Mexico*

CIA-IR-16 U-2 Files. The DS&T provided the Board a copy
of the U-2 shelflist. We also searched for records filed
under Richard Bissell’‘s name. We received no follow-on
request from the Board.

CIA-IR-16 FBIS-USR-92-112. The DS&T provided to the
Board a translation of articles about a KGB file on Oswald.

CIA-IR-17 DS&T Records on Castro Assassination Plots.
Records of the ODDS&T, OTC, and OTS were searched for the
following keywords: Castro, Oswalt, Oswald, assas*, and
KDBADGER. In addition, we searched OTS records on the
following: Project ZRRIFLE, Mollusca, Cubela, Black Leaf,
ballpoint pen, hypodermic syringe, Artime, silencer, gambling,
aerosol, cigar, depilatory, wiretapping, Phyllis McGuire, skin
diving suit, sea shell, and project AMLASH. As a result of
these searches, we provided to the Board a document titled,
‘Handwriting Analysis - AMLASH-1,” dated 7 April 1965.

CIA-IR-25 Zapruder Film. A search was conducted on
records of the National Imagery and Mapping Agency (records of
the former National Photographic Interpretation Center (NPIC)
and Office of Imagery Analysis) using the terms Zapruder, JFK;
Commission, and 1963. Hits on year 1963 did not reveal any
pertinent information. We located no record of a “William
Green” at NPIC in November 1963. We located no log books or
indexes regarding the processing or handling of any
assassination films. We also reviewed an audiotaped
interview with a former NPIC employee, and made minimal
deletions to the tape.

CIA-IR-33 Search of FBIS records for any files on Oswald,
and request for information on how FBIS-USR92-112 was filed.
No past or present files were found. An explanation on how
FBIS-USR-92-112 was filed was provided.

Review of three Ford Library Documents (178-10003-10453,
178-10004-10087, 178-10002-10394. Made deletions and deferred
to the DO on 178-10002-10394. Made deletions to Summary
Report on CIA Investigation of MKNAOMI.

Review of two terms. The DS&T advised that the terms
should not be released because of ongoing CIA activity at the
location.

Review of Alias Documentation issue (104-10220-10179, -
10181, and -10188). Requested that Board postpone release of
specific information. A search of OTS records indicated OTS
had no records on particular documents in the 1960s and 1970s.

Review of a slug in current use. Requested that the
Board postpone its release because the slug is in current use.

Board determined that four documents were NBR.

resulting from the CIA’s History Staff‘s review of 61
histories for any connection to the JFK assassination. The
