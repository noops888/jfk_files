NIEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT:

Unknown Subject, Possibly Identifiable with

ERIC STARVO GALT

1. On 19 April 1968 I passed to Mr. Papich of the

FBI ten copies each of the tro photographs (copies attached)

of an unknown individual who bears some resemblance to Galt.

These photographs were taken of the individual as he entered

and/or departed the Cuban Embassy in Mexico City. Since the

photographs were taken by an automatic camera, the dates were

arrived at by an aualysis of the frame numbers within a given

dated reel. The pictures vere probably taken during the period

11-13 October 1967; since 12 October was a holiday (Columbus Day)

ünd the Cuban Embassy was probably closed, the pictures were

probably taken on either 1l or 13 October.

The photographs of this

iadividual were located by Mexican Desk personnel who scanned

negatives of all photographs taken by the

automatic camera during

the months of October and November 1967. These films had been

sent to Headquarters for processing and were therefore not avail

able to the Mexican Station. The Mexican Station had previously

scanned, at the request of the Legal Attache in Mexico City, photo-

graphs taken by other means of the Cuban and Soviet Embassiea

in Mexico City. The results of these searches by the station were

essentially negative, although one photograph described as only

slightly resembling Galt was turned over by the Mexican Station

to the FBI in Mexico City on instructiong from Headquarters. (See

2. Mr. Papich was advised that the Bureau is free to

use these photographs in checking the possible identification of

Galt with any FBI sources.. He was cautioned, however, that the

geographic location and installation where the individual was photo-

graphed, the method of photography, and the agency taking the

to this condition and stated that he would specifically remind

3. According to Mr. Papich, current FBI information

indicates that Galt entered Mexico via Lorado, Texas on 7 October

1967; that he was located at the Hotel Rio, Puerto Vallarta, Calisco

from 19 October to 6 November 1967 and at the Tropicana Hotel in

the same place from 7 November to 13 November 1967; and that he

was back in the U.S. on 19 November 1967.
