2022 RELEASE UNDER THE PRESIDENT JOHN F. KENNEDY ASSASSINATION RECORDS ACT 051592 F

HIGHLIGHTS OF AMLEO/3'S DEBRIEFING

These are the highlights of my debriefing of AMLEO/3.

They are elaborated upon in this and other reports.

1. CASTRO may permit onsite inspection by appropriate

I. N. observers. CASTRO will then ask for a no-invasion pledge

by the U.S.

2. CASTRO is the complete master of everything and everyone

in Cuba. CASTRO's five points were extremely well received and

• fully subscribed to by practically every Cuban in Cuba.

3. The professional officer cadre of the Cuban Navy and

the officers of the rebel army, as opposed to those of the militia,

are the element most likely to conspire against the Communist

oriented direction of Fidel's government.

4. The shortage of doctors in Cuba has made it necessary

fOr CASTRO to prohibit their further exit and in addition he has

recently raised their pay and given each a new automobile. A

further exodus of doctors from Cuba will cause a "panic" on the

SoviET doctor

Island. This is one item the Soviets cannot furnish. uke not foii.

in curt::

5. A further departure of engineers would likewise damage

the regime, but they can be replaced by Soviet and Czech

technicians.

6. The infiltration of black teams into Cuba is futile,

non-productive, and suicidial. The counter-surveillance block _y Hock

makes black living impossible in the cities and tons.

7. When the CRC goes, Fidel won't be able to hold the

flood of Cubans seeking refuge in the U. S.

8. Fidel suspects the Communists to have an mierground

apparatus. Blas ROCA is the leader of this apparat.

9. Fidel is bothered considerably when Carlos Rafael

RODRIGUEZ is made out to be the main cog of the Cuban government.

10. The death of Fidel would result in a free for all--with

each army commander digging in for a show down. Caiculated to

go down is Raul; given a good chance for survival, in union with

rebel army and navy ieaders, would be "Che"; the Comies would

lose out. To AMLEO/3, the death of Fidel would be the best

answer to all.

11. AMLEO/3 has a group of about 10 important people:

A. Conchita FERNANDEZ and her husband

B. U. N. Delegate Raul PRIMELLES.

C. (Cultural attache ALBERU) in Mexico

D. Engineer Roman Luis MAYOR

AMLEO/3 believes these would make ideal psychological

12.

themes:

A. A subtle, careful build-up of Carlos Rafael

RODRIGUEZ. This could begin with pictures of Fidel and

Carlos Rafael conferring in the Sierra Maestra. I believe

such pictures exist. The showing of CR as Fidel's mentor

both in Marxism-leninism and in "how to organize a country"

will hurt Fidel C. forusa

• B. Certainly the Chief/SAS's idea of doing the same with

"Che" would be even more to the point. "Che" is known to

be a prodigious worker, "brilliant," popular and one no

does not fear Fidel. These are facets of Che's character

which Fidel undoubtedly would not like to hear,too vites.

C. The truth must be employed--the use of materials

easily proved to be "lies" are extremely damaging and extremely

well exploited by Fidel.

D. Postal cards (in color) showing the food counter of

a Hot Shoppe or Howard Johnson. AMLEO/3 was genuinely moved

by the "beauty" of the food counter of a Hot Shoppe we visited.

E. The pamphiets which gave the populace instructions

in simple sabotage techniques were "bothersome" and damaging

to the Cuban goverment.

13. Psychological warfare which was not well received:

A. Those works showing Fidel as a beast with long,

bloody claws, or as a donkey pulling Khrushchev in a wagon.

B. The "gusano" theme has not been noticed to any

degree (at least not by AMLEO/3). He considers this "too

common" a theme to have any value.

14. There will be no revolt or uprising by elements within

Cuba, unless the "fiane" of resistance is kept alive and the

hope of outside help is not lost.
