two days after MARCELLO arrived in Guatemala City.
MAROUN wanted BRAMLETT-to use his influence in getting
MARCELLO released. from custody which BRAMLETT did do
through influences of ‘the Chief of Police in

Guatemala City. BRAMLETT also claimed he had been
instrumental in getting MARCELLO and MAROUN out of

Honduras about 50 or’100 miles where MARCELLO transferred
to another boat which’ brought him back to the United

concerning any of the details of how MARCELLO returned
tothe United States because he felt BRAMLETT must be

best interests from the standpoint of his own welfare
while in Guatemala City.
