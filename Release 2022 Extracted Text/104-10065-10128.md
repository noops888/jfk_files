STATION HAS REVIEWED QUESTIONS LISTED PARA 4 REF

AND RECONMENDS THAT HOS RESOLVE THE OUTSTANDING QUESTIONS

CONTAINED PARA 4 REF.

THERE ARE HARDLY ANY RECOROS AT

STATION COVERING THAT PERIOD AND THERE ARE NO PERSONNEL

PRESENTLY ASSIGNED WHO HAVE ANY KNOWLEDGE OF STATION EVENTS

DURING THAT PERIOD.

THE FOLLOWING ANSWERS (KEYED TO THE

QUESTIONS) REFLECT TOTALITY OF STATION KNOWLEDGE AT THIS TIME.

A. INFORMATION NOT AVAILALBLE OR KNOWN AT STATION.

B. NO RECORD AT STATION.

C. UNLESS TIME/DATE IS INDICATED ON PHOTOGRAPHS

AND TELTAPS, IT WOULD BE ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO LINK THEM

TOGETHER.

FOR EXAMPLE, EVEN TODAY, WITHOUT IMPROVED

TECHNOLOGY, NE STILL DO NOT HAVE THE CAPABILITY TO INDICATE

THE TIME OF THE INDIVIDUAL CALLS MADE DURING THE DAY.

C

D. ACCORDING TO PROJECT RECORDS, THERE WERE TWO

TELTAP OPERATIONS ACTIVE AROUND THIS PERIOD:

THE LIENVOY

PROJECT RENEWAL (JOINT OPERATION) (HMMW-11457, 4 APR 63) SAYS

THAT 30 LINES WERE COVERED.

OF TARGETS AVAILABLE AT STATION.

THE OTHER OPERATION WAS

LIFEAT (UNILATERAL) WHICH COVERED 23 LINES.

A PROGRESS

PROVIDES IDENTIFICATION OF THE TARGETS.

THIS DISPATCH

LISTS TWO LINES COVERED IN CONNECTION WITH THE. AMSTRUT

HSCA WILL BE INVESTIGATING TELTAP OPERATIONS WHICH ARE STILL

ONGOING CAUSES US CONSIDERABLE CONCERN.

DURING PAST YEAR,

WE HAVE ENCOUNTERED INCREASING SENSITIVITY ON PART OF OUR

LIAISON COUNTERPARTS AS RESULT OF REVELATIONS AND EXPOSES

CONCERNING CIA AND FBI ACTIVITIES IN MEXICO.

ONE OF THE

MOST SENSITIVE OPERATIONS FROM THE MEXICAN POINT OF VIEW

IS TELTAPS, AS SUCH ACTIVITY IS UNCONSTITUTIONAL IN MEXICO.

THE MEXICANS DRAW A VERY DISTINCT LINE BETWEEN REVELATIONS

ABOUT CIA ACTIVITIES ORIGINATING FROM CRITICS AND ENEMIES

ES ORTGIMATING LONE

AND THUSE BEARING THE IMPRIMATUR UF THE U,S. GOGERNMENT.

THE RELEASE UF THE FBI DOCUMENTS DREW A SHARP WARNING FROM •

THE PRESIDENTIAL ADVISOR ON INTELLIEGNCE MATTERS (CF. MEXICO.

CITY 43110).

7. ANY PUBLIC REVELATION BY THE ISCA OF JOINT

TELTAP ACTIVITY, JOINT OPERATIONS, OR LIAISON COOPERATION

IN INTELLIGENCE

MATTERS, MAY WELL RESULT IN THE CURTAILMENT

OF THESE OPERATIONS AND THE LIAISON WHICH HAS BEEN ASSIDUOUSLY

DEVELOPED OVER THE YEARS, PLUS THE VERY REAL LOSS OF HIGH-LEVEL

REPORTING SOURCES.

8. NO FILE. EZ, IMPDET.
