ONGOING CAUSES US CONSIDERABLE CONCERN, DURING PAST YEAR,
WE HAVE ENCOUNTERED INCREASING SENSITIVITY ON PART OF OUR
LIAISON COUNTERPARTS AS RESULT OF REVELATIONS AND EXPOSES
CONCERNING CIA AND FBI ACTIVITIES IN MEXICO, ONE OF THE
MOST SENSITIVE OPERATIONS FROM THE MEXICAN POINT OF VIEW

IS TELTAPS, AS SUCH ACTIVITY IS UNCONSTITUTIONAL IN MEXICO,
THE MEXICANS DRAW A VERY DISTINCT LINE BETWEEN REVELATIONS
ABOUT CIA ACTIVITIES ORIGINATING FROM CRITICS AND ENEMIES
AND THOSE BEARING THE IMPRIMATUR UF THE U,S, GOGERNMENT,
THE RELEASE OF THE FBI DOCUMENTS DREW A SHARP WARNING FROM
THE PRESIDENTIAL ADVISOR ON INTELLIEGNCE MATTERS (CF. MEXICO.
CITY 43110),

HSCA WILL BE INVESTIGATING TELTAP OPERATIONS WHICH ARE STILL |

7. ANY PUBLIC REVELATION BY THE HSCA OF JOINT
TELTAP ACTIVITY, JOINT OPERATIONS, OR LIAISON COOPERATION
IN INTELLIGENCE MATTERS, MAY WELL RESULT IN THE CURTAILMENT
OF THESE OPERATIONS AND THE LIAISON WHICH HAS BEEN ASSIDUOUSLY
DEVELOPED OVER THE YEARS, PLUS THE VERY REAL LOSS OF HIGH*LEVEL
REPORTING SOURCES,

6. NO FILE, E2, IMPDET,
