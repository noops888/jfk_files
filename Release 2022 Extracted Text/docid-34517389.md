(The Russian American Society (RAS), mentioned hereafter, has

been designated by the Attorney General' of the United States pursuant to

Executive Order 10h50.)

ONICK expressed the belief that he initially associated with the

Russian American Society in 1945 when he attended social functions of the

Russian American Society at the Russian Embassy, San Francisco. He stated

that he might have attended one or two other social gatherings of the

Russian American Society after 19L5. He observed that he had never been

a member of the Russian American Society and that he participated in the

social functions "for the purpose of a social activity." ONICK advised

that trom approximately 1942 until 1945, his mother and father were associated

with the Russian American Society for the purpose of giving aid and

ngsg prother

assistance in the manner of old cothing for the Russian people. He expressed

the belief that they were not Russian American Society members al though they

were closely associated with the Russian American Society. He advised

hall on Divisadero Street in San Francisco. He stated that neither of his

parents had been officials of the Russian American Society but that on

ceremonial occasions his father had been selected to hold the Russian flag

and he noted that his father had been selected for this purpose apparently

because he had an old Russian peasant costume.

According to ONICK, his aunt, ANNA BORDEN, nee ALEXANDROFE,

1915 York, San Francísco, was associated with the Russian American Society

during World War II, but terminated her activity in about 1945.

ONICK related that in approximately 1945, his father withdrew

his support of the Russian American Society because he felt that the

Russian American Society had served its purpose as a World War II

tussian aid group and his father, therefore, ceased participation in

Russian American Society social functions.

ONICK stated that he had never contributed financially to the

Russtan American Society but expressed the belief that he had donated old

clothes to the Society. He stated that none of his relatives have had

any connection with the Russtan American Society since his father's

withdrawal in approxinately 1945, to the best of his knowledge.

ONICK observed that he initially met VALENTINA BELOBRODSKI In

June or July 1951, in Vancouver, B. C., and that he became acquainted

1954 until their marriage in April 1955. She wae then employed as a Research

Chemiet at the American Can Company and had held that position for about

ten years. He advised that his wife is now employed as Secretary at the

and "some people may not, but it is completely foreign to my own type of

government." He was asked if he believed Communism would be a threat to

the American way of life, there is not ary reason to be scared of them,

said the Soviets did not entrust her with any highly conf1-

contial information, usually taking care of this themselves.

Soviot Government officials who were then engaged

in espionago in the United States.

It 1a belleved

that this individual is identical with S.RGTI

GRIGORLEVICH LUCIANOV, who was a member of the

Sovlet Government Purchasing Cornission in the

United States

from about 1943 to 1945 at which

time he was transferred, and became Chief of the

Sovlet Purchasing Commission In Vancouver, B. C.,

Canada.

LUKIANOV 18 believed to have departed fron

Canada an Septomber 23, 1946 enroute to Moscow via.

New York. He departed from New Yoris on October 23,

191:6.

According to records of the United States

State Department, he roturned to the United States

in Jan vary 1919, as Secretary to the Sovlet

Delegation to the International Conference on wheat

and remained in this country until March 25,

1919.

Investigation during this latter period

did not disclose he was engaged in intelligence

activities.

Mrs. ONICK advised that she had no knowledge of

any espionago activity or any activity upon the part of the

above Soviet personnel which was against the best interests

of the Canadian Government and as far as she was able to

determine, their business in Canada appeared to be entirely

Legitimate.

She said that none had ever approached

her to engage in any type of

aotivity in behalf of the Soviet

Government.

lirs. ONICK related that the above organization, to

tho best of her knowledgo, was organized in approximately

B.C. She claimed that originally the Prime Minister of Canada, tie

and sponsors. She recalled that LBON LADNER, an attomney, was chairman.

Mrs, NICK could not recall the exact cireumstances surroundin

her Joining of the above organization, but believed she had read about

it in the local newpapers.

To the best of her recollection, she Joined

the organization about 1943 and attended functions of the organization

at infrequent intervals during 19l3-ll She said that sonetime during

this period, she was nominated to the Board of Directors of the organi-

zation, which position was entirely honorary and involved no work or

activity. She asserted the activities of the organization were handled

by the president and secretary.

Mrs. ONICK recalled attending several social functions of the

organization in the forn of dimers which were held in the salon of the

Hotel Vancouver. She also attended one function at the University in

Vancouver, B. C. She described the above functiomby stating they

appeared to be purely social and cultural in nature, and there were

discussions concerning an interchange of misic, drana and literature

between Canada and Russia.

Mrs. ONICK said she could not recall specifically any person

asking her to Join, nor could she recall at the present time the names

of the officers or members.

Mrs. ONICK stated that at the time she felt flattered to belong

to an organization of that kind since she was a very young, naive girl

just out of hih school. She said that. at the time she was a member,

Russia and Canada were on very friendly terms and it appeared the

fashionable thing to do. Mrs. ONICK believed that her attendance at

functions of the organization ceased during the latter part of 19hl or

very early 1945•

She said it was possible the organization continued having

her name on the letterhead of the official stationery after she had

ceased attending functions and said her severance of connections with

the organisation was very gradual. She recalled that some time in 1945,

It was disclosed that Soviet Government officials had been engaged in

espionage in Canada and relationahips between Canada and Russia became

strained. Mrs. ONICK was of the opinion that many members of the organi-

sation who had been active during World War Il, dropped out st that

time al though she could not furnish any details.

She said that none of her relativea belonged to this

organistion.
