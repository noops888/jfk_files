ENCLOSURES:
-TO THE BUREAU:

Original and one: (1) copy of -LHM characterizing
informants used in attached report.

ADMINISTRATIVE: — ; /
On 1/16/67, NO. 1457=C-TE advised that on 1/13/67
TRAFFICANTE had been in telephonic: contact with CARLOS
MARCELLO.. MARCELLO apparently did not discuss any business
with TRAFFICANTE on the telephone, but..had his brother, ‘
JOSEPH MARCELLO, call a number back, presumably in Fla.,
and then discussed some unknown business with TRAFFICANTE.

On 1/30/67,.NO 1457-C-TE advised that TRAFFICANTE,
accompanied by his wife, had arrived New Orleans sometime
‘before 5:00 PM on 1/27/67. and were currently staying in
Room 758, Fountainebleau Motel, New Orleams. He stated
that JOSEPH MARCELLO and his wife had taken the TRAFFICANTEs

! to dinner at the Emerald Door on Fri. night , 1/27/67, and
that TRAFFICANTE himself had spent most of Saturday
at the’ CARLOS MARCELLO residence. He remarked that:
CARLOS. MARCELLO's wife, JOSEPH MARCELLO’s wife, and
TRAFFICANTE's. wife, had spent the day shopping and that
later in the evening, CARLOS: MARCELLO and his wife had
taken the TRAFFICANTEs to the La Louisiane Restaurant for
‘‘dinner and had returned to the CARLOS MARCELLO residence
around 11:00 P.M.

He remarked that on Sunday, 1/29/67, the two
MARCELLO brothers had entertained TRAFFICANTE at a private
dinner at Elmwood Plantation and the several other individuals
who are not known at the time, had also been present. He
remarked that TRAFFICANTE appeared to be unusually exuberant
on this particular visit, whereas MARCELLO appeared to: be
upset and whether this is caused by MARCELLO's recent
. health.problems or TRAFFICANTE's visit, is not known.

q On 1/31/67, NO 1457-C-TE advised that on the morning
of 1/30/67, TRAFFICANTE became very upset because he passed
- Some blood and that CARLOS MARCELLO had made an appointment
for TRAFFICANTE with a proctologist named Dr. HEBERT.
He remarked that later during the morning, CARLOS MARCELLO
‘made a local telephone call and informed the party with
whom he was conversing, that “the man" was there and wanted
to:look at the plant. He remarked that TRAFFICANTE apparent ly
told his wife that he was leaving to look at a building
and possibility exists that this was ‘main purpose of
TRAFFICANTE's trip to New Orleans.

He remarked that TRAFFICANTE'’s wife does not plan
to accompany SANTO to New York where. he. is due to appear
on 2/16/67, as she feels such trip -might seriously jeopardize
her insurance claim resulting from a recent. accident.

During the evening of 1/30/67, TRAFFICANTE indicated
to the MARCELLO brothers and their respective spouses,’ that
he wanted them to be his guests in Miami sometime during
February when he intends to have a very private dinner party
for FRANK SINATRA, 7

On 2/1/67, NO 1457-C-TE related that TRAFFICANTE
and his wife had departed the New Orleans area during the
afternoon or evening of 1/31/67, and that prior to leaving,
TRAFFICANTE had picked up some X-rays to take with him.

:

Information from records of the General Telephone
Co. of Fla. were made available on 1/19/67, by Mrs.. SHIRLEY
NONNENBERG, Centralized Toll Investigations, and on 1/24/67
by Mr. GENE MASON, Security Department.

Extended investigative period occasioned by
desire to include results of investigation conducted by
an. auxiliary office, which was not available’at time of
last report.

On 1/5/67, Det. Sgt. TREVOR LLOYD-HUGHES ,
Criminal Intelligence Squad, New Scotland Yard, London,
England, advised that he has been unable to locate any
record of TRAFFICANTE having visited United Kingdom within
the past. three years.
