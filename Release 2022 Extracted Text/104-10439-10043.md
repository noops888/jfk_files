KAMIIN, Victor Petrovich
Al~2752 - SSD-90097

A review of Subject's file has been made in connection with
a request from the CI Officer, French Desk, with reference to
information from the(Chief of Station, Paris,) that Subject's Washington
book store, as of the summer of 1959, was one of the four book stores
in the United States where subscriptions could be bought for "RODINA",
the bulletin edited by the Repatriation Committee of East Berlin,
“RODINA"!(LA PATRIE), which is distributed in various languages
and is yatitéd in sealed envelopes, has been forbidden distribution
in France. (See attached thernofax.)

Security files reflect that in April 1957 the FHI advised that
Victor Petrovich KAMKIN, Elena Andreevna KAMKIN and Nina SAPELKIN
had been the subjects of an Internal Security - R type investigation
as of 1951 and thatr “There is no derogatory data of a subversive
nature in the files of this Bureau concerning the subject of your
inquiry (KAMKIN). It should be noted, however, that Victor
Petrovich KAMKIN ie currently of investigative interest to this
Buroeu and, accordingly, it is requested that any contact of hin
in behelf of the Central Intelligence Agency be handled by this
bureau." It was advised orally that the Burema was ueing KANKIN
a a sources .

Lecording to an undated blind memorandum (possibly a Staff ¢
momoranticm), Nina SAPELKIN is Elena KAMKIN's sister and ao of
1951 was living with the K#MKINe in TennesSes. Nina SAPELKIN was
born in Russia 18 August 19125 and wes evacuated from Shanghai to
Samer, Philippino Islands under IRO auspices in April 1919,
accompanied by her husband Semen I, SAPELKIN and their two children.
Sng care to the United States in 1951 and lived in Tennessee for
a time with the KAMKINs, The SAPELKINe reportedly renounced
Soviet oitisenship in Shanghai in September or October 1918.

The KAMKINe also were born in Russia and KAMKIN attended
high school and university in Harbin, Menchuria. Thereafter until
19h$ he was in the printing and publishing business in China; and
during 19h6-h7 says he wes with "Special Services, Section II,
Amph., Marine Corps", working on its newspaper, "North China
Marine". In 19h7 he was co-publicher of "Free Word" viich he says
was an anti-Soviet newspaper closed by pressure of the Soviet

Conrulate. From 197 to 19h9 he stated that, he was the owner of
the "Anchor Printing Shop" in which the "North China Marine"
contimed publication in Tsingteo, China. The KAMKINs came to
the United States in 19k9 arriving in San Francisco in arch.

As of 1957 KAMKIN was being used on en unclassified basis by
the CIA Library asa publications procurement channel, It is, of
course, possible that Subject's interest in "RODINA" is on behalf cs
of this Agency.

‘Te other book stores involved in the report to the French
Desk were the well known Communist "Four Continents Book Store",
(MS~2000), "Imported Publications and Products" (MS-2001-I) and
"Universal Distributors Company” (#91916). These organizations are
registered under the Foreign Agents Registration Act. The Four 5
Continents Book Store ie flagrantly Conmunist¢-needs no defining; a
and the "Inported Publications and Products" is reported to be 2
one of the four principal outlets for Conmnist political prop-
agenda in the United States. "Universal Distributors Company" is
described as "an officiel distributor of Communist Party Literature”
and as "Commnist controlled". It is the distributing agency for
the Four Continents Book Store.

Information from a reliable confidential informant reflects
thet during the summer of 1959 KAMKIN indicated he plannad to
opon a branch book store in San Francisco to be operated by 5.
SAPHIKIN, The store was to be called Znanie, Russian Book Store,
and located at 5237 Geary Street, San Francisco. Thie S. SAPELKIN,
in all probability, is Mrs. KAMKIN's brother~in-law Semen I.
SAPELKIN, MS-5000, who with his wife Mina, nee DAVIDOVA, aka
DAVIDOF, was the subject of an FBI Record Check Request in May
1955. (the wife Nina, per the check shvet, resided at Routs
1, Van Leer, Tennessee from 1951 to 1952, which was the KAMKIN's
address during this period.)

The 1985 FBI Record Check Request on SAPELKIN indicated that
he was formerly a painter; that his wife Nina was a dentists that
both were born in Russia; that he arrived in the United States
from France around the end of 195), wes stateless and had his first
papers and that she arrived in San Francisco 5 June 1951. They
were residing at 1405 Harvard Street, NeWe, Washington, D. Ce
(which was the address of Subject's book store); and had formerly
resided in Tientsin and Shanghai, China. Both their children
were born in Mentsin, one in 19f6 and one in 1919.

An RI check requested in 1957 for USIA indiceted that the name
Semon I, SAPSIKIN appeared in a report from a reliable source in
May 1950, which dealt with refugees in an IRO camp at Guinan,

Samar, Philippine Islands; and, according to the report, he had
been a member of the Russian Residents Association (probably Russian

Rnigrants Association) and of the Soviet Club in Shanghai.

An ONI name check on KAMKIN, in November 195i, reflocted the
crops-referencing of his name to "Foreign Service Dispatch, Hong Kong
#402, 22: August 1952", the subject of which was "Contact of Mr.
Verdendn/VASILIEVITCH SAPELKIN with the Hong Kong Consulate General";
while rdgults of a 1957 "K" check based on this same "Foreign
Service Dispatch, Hong Kong #402, 22 August 1952, Secret",
reads as follows: "Mr, SAPELKIN reported that he had recently
received various commmications from a White Russian friend of his,
Mr. Victor P. KAMKIN who was formerly head of the Russian Enigrants
Association in Teingtso, China. Mr. KAMKIN left China early in
1949 and has resided in the United States since that time. Both
SAFELKIN and KAMKIN reportedly had certain contacts with a Eugene
GORDENEV, Russian-speaking officer attached to the G-2 Section of
the First Marine Division in Tientsin following the Japanese Surrender
in 19S. Mr. KAMKIN has now written to Hong Kong asking Mr.
SAPELKIN to supply certain economic information on North China’ and
Manchuria for the use of the ‘imerican Govermment'. Mr. KAMKIN
indicates that he ie involved in certain intelligence activities.” .
Zin a letter of 13 July 1950, offering his services to ONI, Subject
‘Tamed GORDENEV as one who could "substantiate my work in China".

ONE advised CIA that their records contained no derogatory infor-
mation regarding Subject, but that-ONI did not contemplate utiliz-
ing his services.

“

Tas Subjects friend "Mr. SAPFLKIN" may well be Mr. Verdemin

‘pees obtaiwed auho in all probability is related to Mrs. KAMKIN's brother-in-law,
TOR, Semen I. SAPZLKIN.

Maas, According to a 1955 RI check conducted on one Alexander Se
wee SORLOFF for G-2, a report of 17 May 1950 advised that ORLOFF (who

¢.' had been described as an "Old Soviet worker") was closely associated
—<" with Vemiemin Vasilievitch SAPEIKIN, an alleged Soviet agent at
the IFO Camp at Samar, P. I, As reported above, Mrs. KAMKIN's
sister Nina and her husband Semen SAPELKIN were evacuated to Samar,
P. I., from Shanghed under JRO auspices in April 1949.

Veniamin Vasilievitch SAPELKIN's friend ORIOFF, according to
a report of 8 April 1950, was alleged to have influonced a district
leader of the IRO Camp at Samar with pro-Soviet propaganda, and to
have worked with a number of other pro-Soviet internees in the canp
to Sovietize the Russian refugees interned there. According to a
report cated 5 May 1950, ORLOFF allegedly was believed to be a
Soviet agent. (The report noted that this information originated
in the IRO Camp in Samar; that much information originating there
had proven unreliable; and that the relability of this particular
information had not been determined.)

OR.

However this may be, it appears that thers could be much truth
in the allegations. Information in Security files reflects that
ORLOFF very possibly is identical with a "Count ORIOFF of the
Russian Committee", (apparently a committee of THO);“who assisted
the Commercial Counselor for the Bulgarian Legation in securing
IRO employment for one Bogdana OTTAI, a possible Soviet agent in
Peris who was living with and was engaged to marry Kiril VASSILEV,
who was believed to ba an agent of the Bulgarian Military Intelligence
Service. "Count ORLOFF" also helped arrange OTTAI's entrance into
the United States. Aloxander S. ORIOFF and "Count ORIOFF" may well
be identical with Alexander ORLOFF, DL-2881, a highly suspect
individual of Russian birth, and a former AMI'CRG employee who was
security disapproved by OSS in 1943. This latter individual, per
a 19l3 OSS investigation, was known as "The Count",

A Dacember 1954 Staff C memorandum regarding KAMKIN, reported
that unevgluated information dated 1 June 1948 indicated that ons
Victor N./KAMKIN was involved in a money printing transaction with
tha’Japaridse, in which he used the machinery of the Chihli Press
in Tientsin to facilitate the counterfitting. The source of this
information had pointed out the possibility that Victor N. KAMKIN
might be identified in some way with a V. P. KAMKIN who was named
as a character reference by one Vladimir Vasily IVASHKOFF. (IVASHXOFF
was net identified.) ‘The memorandum advised that according to a
report dated 1 June 1948 from a U. S. Naval. Attache, Nanking, to
the American Ambassador, Nanking, V. Ne KAMKIN was a printer and
publisher in Shanghai and later was in charge of the Russian
Publishing House/ known es Nashe ZNANI. He was closely associated
with Bernard S./ROGARD of the Chihli Press, who in turn was
associated with |alleged Soviet espionage agent Olga NAKVASIN.

According to the Staff CG memorandum , a report from the FBI
dated ly August 1953 indicated that a source of unknown reliability
stated that one Victor KAMKIN, who operated a book store as a
possible cover in Tientsin, China, acted as a paid informer of
the Japenese during World War II; and was a paid informer of Us Se
Army Intelligence after the War. With the assistance of the
American Military Government in Tsingtao, China, he became Chairman
of the Russian Immigrant Society in Tsingtao in 1948. There seens
small doubt that this Victor KAMKIN is identical with Victor No
KAMKIN, and with Subject, Victor P. KAMKIN who was formerly head
of the Russian Immigrant Association in Tsingtao, China, accord~
ing to his friend SAPELKIN, as. reported in Hong Kong Dispatch
#02. Note that Victor N. KAMKIN was in charge of a Russian
Publishing House in China known as Nashe Znanies and that the
branch store Subject. intended to open in San Francisco (and may
have opened) was also to be called Znanie (this work in Russian
means "Knowledge")»

{Bernard S. ROGARD of the Chihli Press, referred to

ahe ae



13-00000

above as a close associate of Subject and also of alleged
Soviet espionage agent Olga NAKVASIN, is the Subject

of SSD file #35095. ROGARD is a former U. S. Marine whose
parents were Polish-born and who lived in China for
twenty years prior to returning to the United States in
1950. He allegedly was pro-Soviet, ie: ridiculed White
Russians who did not avail themselves of Soviet citizen
ship made available to them; hired as Editor of his
‘Tentsin Eve Journal, following its resumption after
the Wer, one Leonoff who was an employee of TASS;
followed a Communist inspired line in his newspaper;

and published without comment in his Tientsin Evert:
Journal a letter discrediting Americen Military Pol: tee
Th TWentsin, comparing them unfavorably with Soviot
Military Police in Harbin who were praised in glowing

terme; etc. RCGARD, "if used" by Project PILLAR,
