However this may be, It appears that there could be much truth

in the allegations.

Information in Security filos reilects that

ORIOFF very possibly is identical with a "Count ORLOFF of the

Russian Cormittoe", (apparently a committoo of Iio), Who assistod

tho Commercial Counselor for the Bulgarian Legation in securing

IRO employment for one Bogdana OTTAI, a possible Soviet agent in

Paria who was living with and was engaged to marry Kiril VASSILEV,

who was belleved to be an agent of the Bulgarian Military Intelligenco

servico.

"Count URLOFF"

also helped arrange OTTAI's entranco into

the Unitod States.

Aluxander S.

ORIOFF and "Count ORIOFF"

may holl

be identical with Alexander ORLOFF, DI-2881, a highly suspect

individual of Russian birth, and

a 1943 OSS investigation, was known as "The Count".

A Dacembar 1954 Staff C memorandum regarding KAMKIN, reported

that unevaluated information datod 1 June 1948 indicated that ons

Victor N. KAMKIN was involved in a money printing transaction with

the Japanese, In which he used the machinery of the Chihli Press

in Tientsin to facilitate the countorfitting.

The source of this

information had pointed out the possibility that Victor No KAMKIN

might be identified in some way with a V. P. KAMKIN who was named

(IVASHKOFF

The memorandun advised that according to a

report dated I June 1948 from a U. S. Naval. Attache, Nanking, to

the American Ambassador, Nanking,

V. N. KAMKIN was a printer and

publisher in Shanghai and Ister was in charge

with Bernard S. HOGARD of the Chihli Press, who in turn was

associated with alleged Soviet espionage agent Olga NAKVASIN.

According to the Staff C memorandum, a report from the FBI

datod l4 August 1953 indicated that a source of unknown reliability

stated that one Victor KAMKIN, nho operated a book store ais a

possiblo cover in Tientsin, China, acted as a paid informer of

the Japanese during World War II; and was a paid informer of U. S.

Army Intelligence aftor the War.

With the assistance of the

American Military Goverrment in Tsingtao, China,

he became. Chainian

of the Fussian Immigrant Society in Isingtao in 1948. There seems

small doubt that this Victor KAMKIN is identical with Victor No

KiMKIN,

and with Subject, Victor P. KAMKIN who was forerly head

of the Russian Immigrant

Association in Tsingtao, China, accord-

ang to hig friend SAPElKIN, as reported in Hong Kong Dispatch
