MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, Western Hemisphere Division

SUBJECT : Termination of Project LIHUFF

id 1. It is requested that the LIHUFF Project be
terminated, effective 30 June 1970.

2. Project LIHUFF covered funds for one agent,
LIHUFF-1, a U.S, businessman resident in Mexico City
who had served in World War If with U.S, military
intelligence (MIS/X). LIHUFF-1 provided the Mexico
City Station with access into the right-wing political

* groups and the American Chamber of Commerce in Mexico.
He also obtained Dunn and Bradstreet reports for the
Station and performed other tasks from time to time.

een

3, LIHUFF-1 was actually terminated effective
28 February 1970. No funds were expended for the
termination, as he was not given a termination payment. H
He was paid his salary of $300 per month, plus social y
security contributions, up until the time he was .
terminated. During FY 1970 $2,528.41 of LIHUFF Project
funds were expended.

acne gem

4, There were no known problems or security
risks in connection with the termination. A quitclaim
was not obtained. LIHUFF-1 was advised concerning his
social security benefits derived from his CIA employ-
ment and told to contact the Station should he have

further questions,

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, Western Hemisphere Division
SUBJECT 2 Renewal of Project LIHUFF

1. Renewal of Project LIHUFF in the amount of
$4,000 is requested for the period 1 July 1969 through
30 June 1970. The Project was budgeted for $4,000 for
FY 1970 and funds are available within WH Division.

2. LIHUFF represents Mexico City Station's access
into right wing political elements and organizations in
Mexico, and provides contact with the large and influ-
ential American business community there. In addition,
his access to Dun and Bradstreet reports has also been ..
useful in carrying out checks on WOLADY citizens of
operational intcrest to the Station. During the project
year three field information reports were credited to
the Project, one of which was disseminated by Head-
quarters, and some thirty-five background investigations
and file traces were conducted by the agent.

3. %In paragraph D "Effectiveness" of the attached.
renewal request it was noted, "He (LIHUFF-1) also organ-
ized at the request of COS (who, in turn, had been
requested by Headquarters) a public demonstration in
front of the Soviet Embassy in protest against the in-
vasion of Czechoslovakia." A review of the LITEMPO
Project reveals that LITEMPO-4 was paid $4,000.00 by the
Station to organize and rally as many students as possible
in addition to the MURO planned demonstration in front of
the Soviet Embassy, and to Headquarter's knowledge LIHUFF-1
did not organize the student demonstration on behalf of the

Station.

4, The Desk feels that this Project should be reviewed
during the upcoming project year to determine whether it

should be continued.

MEMORANDUM FOR: DC/WH
SUBJECT : Renewal of Project LIHUFF

1, Project LIHUFF covers a singleton agent (a U.S.
citizen) who has been managed directly by the COS, Mexico
City, and who has worked for WHD for more than twenty years,
beginning in Panama and continuing in Mexico. LIHUFF-1 pro-
vides the Station access to right-wing political elements and
contact with the American business community in Mexico City
(he is executive director of the American businessman's
association).

2. The project provided three disseminations in Fiscal
Year 1969, and it is deemed unlikely that it will ever be a
source of éffective and meaningful intelligence.

3. WH/FI suggests that LIHUFF-1 be considered for one or

7 several specific support tasks, which represent a continuing
burden for Station Mexico City, and that he no longer be con-
sidered as a source of intelligence.

4. If it is ascertained that he can perforn/support
task(s), we advise that the project be terminated. In the
meantime, we recommend approval in the amount of $4,000 for

Fiscal Year 1970.

(ir, Smock's note: wI believe that David L. Smock
we should take a hard look at this \C/WH/FI
one.)

A. CURRENT OBJECTIVES

The objective of this project is to provide support for
a singleton contract agent, LIHUFF-1, who is the Executive
Director of the most important organization of WOLADY
businessmen in Mexico. He also continues to have access to
right-wing political elements and organizations in Mexico,
one of which is a right-wing student group (principally at
the Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico, UNAM).

2. This agent is used as a source for background, opera- i
tional and investigative data, ‘For that reason it does not
produce a sufficient amount of positive intelligence to justify ‘
its existence for that purpose. Its real value is the
availability of this agent and his contacts to the Chief of
Station, Mexico, for a current reading on right-wing political
activities and personalities. He is also a primary investiga-
tive source for information on WOLADY citizens of operational
interest to the Station. This agent has access to all reports
produced by Dunn & Bradstreet in Mexico and can have investiga-
tions conducted by them.

OD. EFFECTIVENESS

During the project year, the agent provided the Station :
with details on a proposed new federal levor law (which was i
subsequently passed) and an analysis on how this new law would
affect foreign investors or companies. The agent also kept “the ‘
Chief of Station, Mexico, advised of right-wing political
activities and student agitation. He also organized at the

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, Western Hemisphere Division

SUBJECT: Renewal of Project LIHUFF

1, Renewal of Project LIHUFF in the amount of $4,000
‘is requested for the period 1 July 1968 through 30 June
1969. The project was budgeted for $4,200 for FY 1969 and
funds are available within WH Division.

2, During the past year, one progress report was
received, in June 1968, recapitulating the activities
reported in the attached renewal request. Although the
Station has made use of LIHUFF's relations with the right
wing student organization, MURO, in connection with
Evgeniy YEVTUSHENKO's visit to Mexico this spring, the
use of MURO is being de-emphasized, The main value of
LIHUFF/1, a long time collaborator previously serving in
Panama and beginning in OSS days, is his availability to
service various requests which the COS may make of him
and to provide insight into the activities of the extreme
right wing of Mexican politics. His access to Dun and
Bradstreet reports has also been useful.

2) Agents

The only agent to be supported by this project for the coming
year is LIHUFF-1 :

INTELLIGENCE PRODUCTION

This agent is used as a source for background, operational and
investigative data. For that reason it does rot produce a suffi-
cient amount of positive intelligence to justify its existence j
for that purpose, It's real value is the availability of this
agent and his contacts to the Chief of Station, Mexico, for a #
current reading on right-wing political activities and personalities,
He is also a primary investigative source for information on WOLADY
citizens of operational interest to the Station. This agent has
access to‘all reports produced by Dunn & Bradstreet in Mexico and ,
can have investigations conducted by them. For example, some forty:
Dunn & Bradstreet reports have been obtained (via LIHUFF/1) on
persons and/or organizations of interest.

EFFECTIVENESS

During the project year, the agent provided the Station with |

wel

SECRET/KAPOK



SECRET/KAPOK
-2-

details of Mexican Government plans to impose legislative
restrictions on foreign investments and Government advice to banks |
to limit loans to companies with an appreciable amount of foreign
capital.

This agent kept the Chief of Station, Mexico, advised of right-
wing political activities and student participation in anti-
LNHARP demonstrations which occurred at least once each month
during the past year,

LIHUFF~1 conducted some twenty background investigations and file
traces for the Station, in addition to those cited in C above.

In March LINLUCK prevailed upon a Mexican book publisher to print
copies of the LINLUCK open letter to Yevtushenko as well as the
text of the telegram by Soviet intellectuals to the Consultative |
Conference of Communist Parties in Budapest asking for an end to |
Soviet persecution of intellectuals, The latter handbill was 7
illustrated with LINWUCK pen and ink drawings of Sinyavsky and
Daniel behind barbed wire. At the same time the Station produced
several thousand cartoon and text handbills of a beatnik Yevtu-
shenko dancing into Mexico tossing flowers. Turning a fold of the -
handbill revealed a Russian officer striking off the nib of a
Soviet writer's pen with his sword. In a wet run in January LITEAR.
1 directed four small boys in the distribution of the cartcon aaa
bill in the artists' district of Mexico where Station monitors
watched students and artists read and pocket the cartoon handbill.-
The cartoon handbill was again distributed in the artists' district’
on the day of Yevtushenko's arrival. The following day, when ‘¢

MEMORANDUM TO: Chief, Western Hemisphere Division

SUBJECT : Request for Renewal of Project LIHUFF

in the amount of $4,200.0u for the period 1 July 1967
z through 30 June 1968. Funds are available in WH Division.

i
\
1. It is requested that Project LIHUFF be renewed if
|
Project costs are estimated to be the same as last year. |

cease

2, LIHUFF represents Mexico City Station's access
into right wing circles, and also provides contact and ‘ iz
rapport with the large and influential American business i
community there. It will be observed from the attached t
renewal request that a considerable portion of the i
project's accomplishment was along political action
lines, but it has nevertheless been decided to maintain H
LIHUFF as an FI activity, since the addition of the
investigative function to LIHUFF-1's mission balances
the project more heavily on the FI side, There has been
no progress reporting since 16 November 1966, at which
time the station recounted the harrassing of a Czech
official, the Soviet Embassy and the Chinese art exhibit.
Since the principal agent is personally handled by a E
busy chief of station,however, and since the course of i
the operation changes little from month to month, the
infrequent reporting is explainable. i

This agent is used es a source for background, operetional and in-

to justify this project on the besis of positive intelligence dis-
sewinetions or the mmaber of dispatches or cebles produced by it.
LIHUFF-1 meets repilarly witb and is handled directly by Willerd

C. CURTIS, Chief of Station, Mexico. The agent is used to obtain
information on activities of right-wing politicel groups in Mexico.

political groups, nevertheless, the Ambassador devends upon Station
Mexico for information on all pclitical groups. UIHUFF-1 is the only
Station asset who circulates freely in these circles. During the

past year, LIHUFF-1 has conducted through his organization, investigations
and checks on firms and individuals connected with then. This type of
operational data is not availabie from any other sources. LIHUFF=1 has
access to all reports produced by Dury & Bradstreet in Mexico; and can
have investigations initiated by then and cthers.

EFFSCTIVEN=SS:
Some examples of the effectiveness of this project are: Baten

1) During the past year, LIHUFP-1 provided guidance to a right-wing
action group which launched a press attack against the Comercial
officer of the Czech Bubassy (Subject of 201-204656) which resulted
in his PCS transfer from Mexico.

2) In late Augusc 1966 LIIUFF-1 arranged for a right-wing action
Group to conduct a harrassment of a Chinese Comtunist Art Exhibit at
the UNAM which resulted in the closing of the exhibit. This action
was taken as a result of a personal request of the Chief LNPURE,
Results were reported to Headquarters.

3) In October 1966 LIHUFF-1 arranged for a student action group to
conduct a denonstration in front of the Soviet tmbassy on the 10th
anniversary of the crushing of the Hungarian rebellion. This resulted
in considerable press coment against the Soviets with photographic
coverage of a casket and anti-Soviet banners on the sidewalk in front
of the Soviet Bnbassy.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, WH Division

SUBJECT : LIMUFP Project Renewal

1. It 4s requested that the LIHUFF Project be renewed for
the period 1 July 1966 through 30 Juse 1967 fc; $4,200. It was
approved for $9,000 last year, reflecting a 50 per cent cut this
year in an effort to cut to a minimm project obligations. Funds
are available in WH Division.

2. LIHUFF provides the Station's only agent with access to
vightist political organizations. The information gathered through
LINUF?-1 ia used mainly for background information for operational
planning and Enbassy memoranda, rather than for positive dissemination.
The Station and Wi/l believe that the Station needs to get this other
side of the picture in order to balance out the reporting on leftist
activity in Mexico.

3. Since July 1965, LINUFF has been the source of five positive
intelligence reports -- four on rightist and leftist university
activity and the fifth on the Fondo de Cultura Economica. publishing
house.

REQUEST FOR REIEAAL
PROJECT LIHUFF i

‘A. GURRENT OBJECTIVES

The objective of this project is to provide for the operational

ana administrative support for a high-level contract egent, LIHU?F1,
vho has eccess and is a participant in the right-wing political
elements and orgentzations in Mexico; and through one of these con-
tacts, has access to a right-wing student (principally at the
Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico = tui).

3B. CHANGES -
1) Operational Nechanism

The LINUFF Project was approved in Septenber 1965 for the period

i 1 July 1965 through 30 June 1966, LIHUFF/1, the eingleton agent
involved, has been e contact of the Mexico Station since 1950,

Before that time he vas a contract agent for Station Panama when he
was in business in that area. In November 1962 the relationship was
formalized into contract status with LIKUFF/1 acting es a funding
channel to an anti-Communist research group and rightest student group
headed by LINUFF/2, a3 well as handling LICHANT/1 ani reporting on

H right-wing activities from other conservative business sources. This
: activity was funded fron Station OOA until 1 July 1965. The LOWFF
Project provided only for salary and operational expenses for LUNUFF/1.

2) Agents

The only agent to be supported by this project for the coming year

is LIHUFF/1, No further subsidies are planned to LIKUF?/2. LICHANT/1
H vas relieved of his position in the Ministry of Education and 1s not
a ineluded as a part of the LIHUFF Project. However, LINUFF/1 continues
: in his private business capacity to solicit funds for the LIRUFF/2 group a
H and will continue to use thea as sources for information on right-wing
political activities. |

—— N\

i ‘The Mexico Station makes no effort to justify this project on the basis
of positive intelligence disseminations. The information is primarily
for background. It is often too sketchy for formal dissemination ani is



2.

frequently overtaken by public events before a dissemination ¢:n be g
made. LIHUFF/1 meets regularly with and is handled directly by :
Willerd C, Curtis, Chief of Station Mexico, The agent is used to
obtain information in response to Priority A.3. of the most recent 1
Related Mission Directive (HMM3-4218, 27 July 1966), In addition to H
the RMD, Chief PESWING depends upon Station Mexico for information
on all political groups. LIHUFF/1 represents the only high-level
source trained and available who can circulate freely in Mexican
concervative political circles and provide the Mexico Station with
information on their activities. During the past project year
LINUFF/1 has provided the Station with the following general t
categories of information: :

1) Memoranda on leftists or Comunist affiliation of members of
the Mexican intellectual and officiel commnity, This is
generally based on contritution of funds or public assistance
in behalf of known leftist: or Communist organizations, hence
the information 4s use‘ul for background rather than disseaination.

2) Information on Catholic Church activities in Mexico, including
press clippings and periodic reports on the rightest student
action group, Movimiento Universitario Renovedora Oricntacion
{amo} active at the Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico
UNAM), the Universities of Puebla, Guadajelara and Michoacan.
WM-10,325, the only positive intelligence dissemination received
from LIHUFF during the past project year was obtained from the
NURO group at UNAM, In August 1965, Chief, PBSWING asxed for
a complete report on "Los Tecos", a right-wing Catholic secret
society of which MURO is a student ara. This information wes
required by Chief, PESWING, to make a decision on the application
of the Universidad Autonoza de Guadalajara (U.A.G.) for certain : i
U.S. Government-sponsored monetary grants of several hundred i
thousand dollers to be used for developnent of this anti-
Communist University which is competitive with the Coummnist

i dominated University of Guséalejara. From background data
previously supplied by LIEUFF and other sources, a detailed
report was wade available to Chief, PBSWING.

3) Anti-Commnist publications from LIHUFF/2's right-wing
research center end MURO student publications, all of which |
are available to Headquarters and are of interest to the Station \
for background.

political activities. Also, as previously reported to Headquarters,
the groups influenced by LIWFF,1 represent a potential for counter
palancing for leftist and Commnist pressure groups. One oxample
of this can be cited in action taken by student MURO leaders in August
1965. The Cuban Anbassador to Mexico, Joaquin HERNANDZZ Armas, set
about making spoeches at Mexican (leftist) Universities*of-Tabasco,
Michoacan and Guadelajara proposing Mexiean-Cuban student exchanges.
MORO mevbers inmediately set up a storm of public protest, denanding
that HERNANDEZ Armas be declared persona non-grata for spreading
subversive propaganda and agitating on university campuses. This
caused HERNANDEZ Armas to be a target for considerable unpleasant
press publicity. Through LIHUFF/1, the Station Mexico can exploit
such incidents when it is to KUBARK's advantage to do so,

PROBLEMS

There have been no significant security, cover or control problems
with LIHUFF/1 during the project year.

LIAISON
This project involves no liaison relationship.

pat -AGENCY COORDINATION

This project involves no inter-agency coordination,
PLANS

Station Mexico plans to continue to use LIHUIF/1 as an informant and
monitor of activities of right-wing political minority groups.

FUNDS

1. For the past period.

‘The cost of the LIHUFF Project (paid by the Mexico Station
exclusive of Headquarters costs) from 1 July 1965 through

30 April 1966 was approximately US$ 5,150.00 which included
Subject's salary of US$ 3,000.00 (6300 per month). US$ 3,250.00
is available for the reaainder of the project year.

2. During the next project year.

During the period 1 July 1966 through 30 June 1967, an
estizated US$ 4,200,00 is requested. It will be used in the
following manner?

LIWUFF/1 Salary $5,600.00
Operational expenses 600,00

, Total $4,200.00

The above represents whet Chief of Station Mexico believes is
the ninimm that will be required to keep a working-level
relationship with this very useful agent.

ANNEX
None.
EMERGENCY CONDITIGIS

Tf an official enti-USA atmosphere of sufficient intensity prevailed
in Mexico, dt 1s unlikely that LIHUFF/1 could remair. in the country
in his present business, In a general energency, LIMUFF/1 would
intein contact by Chief of Station Mexico by telephone, mail or
personal. visits.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, Western Hemisphere Division
SUBJECT 2 Renewal of Project LIHUFF

“4, Renewal is requested of the LIHUFF Project for the
period 1 July 1965 through 30 June 1966 for a total of
$9,000. The LIHUFF Project was originally approved on 20
April 1965 for $7,500 for the period 1 January 1965 to
30 June 1965 as a CA Project. It has been decided that
the direction of the agent under this project and the
project objectives in general will be changed from CA to
FI, and therefore, the renewal request is being submitted
as an FI Project. The Operational Program for FY 1966
included LIHUFF for $16,000. Funds are available in WH

Division.

2. The Project objectives under CA were to support
and sustain MURO, a national right-wing student movement,
through a long-established anti-communist front organiza-
tion in Mexico, the Instituto de Investigaciones Sociales
y Economicas (IISE). This support was terminated effective
30 June 1965 as it became apparent that the IISE was
financially capable of providing this support on its own
and MURO became more and more controversial and extremely
militant on the far right. Under the new project sub-
mitted by the Station, support will be provided to a U.S.
contract agent who has access to a wide variety of right-
wing political elements and organizations in Mexico. The
project is responsive to Priority A3d and f of the RMD.

3. This project is the only project in the Mexico
Station which will cover rightist political activity in
Mexico, emphasis in other projects and operations being
geared against the extreme left and the present political
party, the PRI, which is slightly left of center. Other
than LICHANT-1, the only other access to the Ministry of
Education is LIBELER who is carried under his own project.

4. Headquarters and the Station are looking forward
to receiving better coverage on the rightist political
activity in Mexico. WH/1 is preparing guidelines and
requirements for this project which will reflect the needs
of the intelligence community. These requirements will be
furnished the field so that proper utilization can be made
of LIHUFF-1 and his contacts and informants. During the
last fiscal year, three reports were credited in full or
in part to LIHUFF-1.

5, Last year the Station submitted regular quarterly
progress reporting in addition to more detailed reporting
on certain activities. The Station will be reminded to
provide a minimum of quarterly reporting during the next
year.

6. WH/1 recommends approval of the new LIHUFF Project
as it is set forth in the attached Station renewal request.
The delay in submission of the renewal request is that it
was just decided to change this Project to FI and cancel
out most of the CA aspects. As a CA Project the renewal
request was not due at Headquarters until mid-July 1965.

MEMORANDUM FOR: DC/WHD
SUBJECT 3 LIHUFY Renewal

1. Project LIHUFF has been active as a CA project for
a number of years, It is now being renewed and submitted as
ap FI project. Its purpose and objective is to support a
singleton U.S, contract agent (LIHUFF-1) who has access to a
wide variety of right wing political elements and organiza-
tions in Mexico in order to develop information on this
political and social sector, This effort is in consonance
with priority A3d and £ of the RED and is the only one which
covers rightist political activity in Mexico.

2. Sinee LIHUFP was previously a CA project, there is,
therefore, no data on which to judge past intelligence oroduct
although three reports resulted in the past year. The liexican
Desk and the Station are taking steps to prepare suitable

3

requirenents in keeping with LIHUYFl's access and the objectives

ef the project.

3. The reporting received from the Station with regard te, ‘

the operational status of the agent and project appears to.
have been adequate in the past. There are no apparent security |
or control problens.

4, $9,000 hee been requested in support of the project
effective 1 July 1965, Of this amount $5,400 is marked for
operational expenses, entertainment, and travel. A study
of the detailed project outline leads to the conclusion that
this iatter figure is somewhat excessive when viewed against
anticipated operational activity and in all likelihood only
_Very little of it will be expended.

5. Project LIHUFF is recommended for approval.

2. ‘his rev project 1s to provide some support and help sus-
; tain en independent Mexican anti-communist group called the Instituto
de Investigaciones Sociales y Economicas. The group founded in 1953
has as its aim the spreading of the principles of free enterprise ond
private initiative. LIHUFF is particularly active in the student field,
having orgenized a nation-wide, right-wing, active student organization
celled Movimiento Universitario de Renovadora Orientacion (MUR0).
LIHUFF funds vill be used to pay a salary to LIMUFF-1, an American z
businessman with previous experience with CIA in Panama, and for spot i
covert action activities such as the militant anti-communist student :
activities in the universities and the placement of articles in the
press.

3. Effectiveness i '

During the developmental period of this activity, the {
following indications of effectiveness have been reported: {

A. Former Ambassador Thomas Mann valued the IISE publica-
tion "Espejo" as worth far more than what one man in the field
could accomplish, (Station funds no longer support “Espejo.")

i
i
i

E. The IISE continues to provide the Station wih e research ;
‘ facility not otherwise available.

_ C. Provided the Station with a valuable intellectual asset,

groups and who completed a book at Station request on the "Penetra-
tion of the Mexican Educational System by Cormunists.”

D. MURO's 200 shock troops have campaigned vigorously
against Cormunism and pro-Castro groups at the National University
(UNAM), and in the Universities of Puebla and Guadalajara. MURO
takes najor credit for the ouster in past months of Comunist rectors
from the Universities of Monterrey, Puebla, Guadalajare, and Morelia;
MURO continues to place anti-communist articles in the national redia
Of interest ‘to students and government leaders;-MJRO has carried out
successful demonstrations against the Soviet Erbassy.

B, MURO took an active part in cabling the Chilean govern-
ment protesting the Communist nature of the Latin American Youth
Conference in Santiago.

F. LIHUFF-2 is used by the Station for writing and placing
certain typee of strong anti-Soviet articles in Bxcelsior and Bl
Universal.

G. LIBUFF-2 acquired evidence of a large purchare of
Awerican hospital supplies by two professors at UNAM for tranship-
nent to Cuba.

4, Security

The IISB is funded througa a cut-out in suck a vay that CIA
participation is concealed. Only LLWUFF-1, vho 1s met clandestinely
by a Station case officer, is witting of the true source of funds.
There have been no security problens during the developmental period

of this activity.

5. Reporting on this proposed project has been adequate. Five
progress reports vere received during the past year.

MEMORANDUM POR THE RECORD
SUBJECT: Comments on Proposed Project LIBUFF

. I 1. I recommend this project proposal not be subsitted
for approval, for the following reasons:

i
H ea ( funds and would conduct its activities anyway without any
ri as _ Support or aid from CIA or any other U. S. Government agency.
fn 23 TeRe-p project to fund the organization is unnecessary.

b. Tho Station indicates that it has achieved,
Atv.) and can continue to achieve, results through the LIHUFF
ieee, mechanign without making sizeable payments. A project to
a provide a subsidy is therefore unnecessary.

a. The LIHUFF organization has other sources of k

wwiinKotaarien. uth

c. Severai wenbers of the LIHUFF organization are
i also members of the LISIREN organization. One of them,

We Eduardo PRIETO Lopez, recently discussed the LISIREN oper=

| pape, ation with the DCI in the latter's Headquarters office and
1 F wi WS oware of U. S. Governnent funding to the LISIREN complex.
Tine" This fact, taken with the similarity of the proposed funding

bwin mechanism to that of LISIREN, the similarity of cperations
of the two organizations, and other such parallels could ~« :
i eventually be expected to_etrip LIBUFF of its cover and i

create a potential security probles. Fi

weeds palate oe

d. The activities that this proposed project would {
subsidize overlap the activities of several other operations :
in the Station. LIHUFF does not contribute enough beyond eee
this overlapping to be justified. Its student program coin- 4 i‘
cides with Projects LIRVICT, LILISP-c and, to a lesser extent, K i

.LICOAX. Its press placement and publications program dup= i z
licates much of that coutenplated ox conducted in
~LEIOGDLE, and LILISP-E. (« aw pete sey) ‘i

e. The past accomplishments of the operation cited
in the project outline, Appendix II, are minimal at best b
and hardly sufficient to recommend the project. Briefly, i
these accomplishments were: 4

(2) HMBA-20306: At the Station's request,
LIHUFF "Suggested" preparation of a reply to a

@ commentary on a Harxist book about Cuba.

list of Communists, Socialists, and Marxists. (The
project outline points out that the Station already
knew most of them.)

With the discdrtinuance of the subsidy for the publication
of the LYHUFF magazipe ak reported in Paragraph 3 of Reference B,
Headquartar's major akjection to this project has been satisfied.
However, wé, feel compe}led to point out to the Station that despite
a clear disapproval of this subsidy in Reference A, the Station
continued payment of it for an additional five months. In the absence
of any interim\reporting or other attempt to justify this continued
expenditure, Station Chief exceeded his fiscal authority. :
Although He: uarters is prepared to make a concession to the Station
with regard t other aspects of the project as stated later in this
dispat, we must advise you that the prolongation of the LIHUFF-1 -
magazitie\subsidy for five months is viewed here with great seriousness
It is Sduested that Willard C. Curtis prepare a dispatch explaining
the Sta\tion's action in\this matter.

2. With regard to her facets of the project, we are willing

"to continue for a time even\though we are not fully convinced that

Should you wish to support other specific projects through LIHUFF
such as the publication of the book, these will be considered by
Headquarters on a case to case basis.

3. The above authorized expenditures are to be charged to
D&TO and under no circumstances are they to exceed the amounts
specified. In this connection, you are advised that Headquarters has
allocated an additional $30,000 to the Station's D&TO funds for the
fiscal year 1964 bringing the total for FY64 to $82,500. It is not
likely that any further increase can be obtained.

4. The Station is also requested to submit to Headquarters,
not later than 1 June 1964, an up-dated assessment of the LIHUFF
operation. If at that time the Station wishes to present a revised
project for fiscal year 1965, your recommendations should be fully
submitted in the reassessment. If your recommendations are accepted,
then Headquarters will undertake to rewrite the project outline
forwarded with HMMA 20931 and submit the project for approval.
