AE VOCAR A CUBAN INTELIGENCE INFORMATION IN THE

NY I - 1 advised on November 3, 1960,

that he had learned that an unidentified individual

affiliated with the Cuban Consulate, New York City, made

a contact with a representative of the Hanmarlund

Beapment Outiet and Inquired if a (Hammarlund-I00, Kadio

which was owned by the Cuban Consuläte could be utilized

with Koss head phones for short wave broadcasts.

He

identified the Koss phones as four amperes lightweight.

The Hammarlund representative advised that this equipment

was "satisfactory"

NY I - 2 advised on December 1, 1960, that

he was a former Cuban Police Officer and that after

FIDEL CASTRO assumed power in Cuba the Cuban Intelligence

GERUASIO:

appointed Chiet oi

RODRIQUEZCWaS made REUMON's assistant.

Both of these

men were selected for their experience in police work,

their organizational ability and their judgment in

selection of personnel."

According to I-2 REUMON and RODRIGUEZ

had molded the Cuban G-2 into an efficiently, operating

organization.

The CASTRO government removed

them from

G-2 upon the advise of Russian consultants who were

here innuba and who lavorea ana supported RAMIR

TALDEMA

or the position of Chief of Cuban G-2 operations.

NY T - 2 advised that Cuban G-2 has some agents who

operate completely independent of fellow members of the

organization and report directly to RAMIRO VALDES.

Other Cuban G-2 agents operate as a group under group

leaders •

He said thet ordinarily a G-2 agent will not

know the identity of any other G-2 agents outside his

own group and that many of the G-2 agents in operation

do so without compensation in what appears to be a voluntary ser-

vice.

According to T - 2 Cuban G-2 not only operates

agents in the United

States. (US) and many other foreign

countries but also has agents within all the departments

and branches of the Cuban

government.

NY I - 3, another government agency

which conducts

security investigations abroad, advised

on December 6, 1960, that it leamed from a source which

it considers reliable that every month the Cuban National

Bank issues between one hundred and two hundred thusand us daliars

in cash to RAUL CASTRO.

The issuance of cash is shown

on the books as an expenditure for G-2 activities. T - 3

also advised that this money is probably used to finance

external activities since the money is issued in convertible

currency.

On January 10, 1961, NY I -4 advised that

the Cubara Airlines have approximately 55 pilots and T - 4

estimated that approximately ten of these pilots are

members of the Cuban Secret Police.

Source, however,

was unable to furnish the identity

of these

alleged

secret police affiliated with Cubara Airlines.

I - 4 did advise, however, that from

his knowledge of the financial aspects of Cubana 1t

was his opinion that the airline is presently operating

at a financial loss.

However, the CASTRO government

is interested in continuing the operation of the airline

mainly for political and intelligence reasons.

On January 4, 1961, NY T - 5 advised on

that date from an unidentified source employed with Cubana

998 from Havena, Cuba to Idlewild Airport important papers"

on that date and he had in his possession

which he was

to deliver.: upon his arrival in New York

City.

On the same date NY I - 6 advised that upon

the arrival of Cubana Flight 998 at Idiewild: Airport

in New York, and was driven by fRANGo to the cuban

Consulate, 625 Madison Avenue, New fork City.

NY I -6 stated that this appeared very

unusual inasmuch as the plane for Havana usually departs

two hours after its arrival in New York on the return trip

to Havana.

ANTONIO STEELSON APUTY 4, 1961, NY I -7 advised that

the Commercial Office of the Cuban

Consulate had not obtained the private telephone he

was seeking and had appeared to assume more authority

in recent weels in what the source felt was based on

G-2 activity.

I - 7 also advised that as of January 4,

1961, the Cubän Consulate nad received no instructions

regarding the closing of the Consulate or the disposition

of the personnel.

On December 1, 1960, NY I - 8, who was an

employee of the Cuban Revolutionary Government, davisea

that the Cuban law now requires that each Cuban

Cuba must have clearance from the Cuban Department of

Technical' Investigation, as well as the Cuban Passport

Division:

Each cuban, at the time of his departure

from Cuba is required

to present a card, three and one-

half inches by five and one-half inches

signed by the chiefs of the two of four mentioned cuban

departments and authorizes the Bearer to leave Cuba and

return at will for a period of one year.

NY I - 8 advised that the significance of

this change in regulation was that the ordinary Cuban

citizen is obliged by Cuban law to carry this travel

document. However, I - 8 knows it to be a fact that

exceptions are made for Cuban Intelligence Agents and

other Cuban citizens highly trusted by the Cuban Revolutionary

Government. In these cases the cuban Police mere.

furnishes a special certificate which states that the courtesy.

of the Cuban Revolutionary Government the Bearer is

authorized to depart Cuba. These special certificates

do not require a photograph of the Bearer and unlike

the regular identification card the special certificate

must be surrendered to the Cuban Police at the point

of embarkation in Cuba just prior to the individual's

departure.
