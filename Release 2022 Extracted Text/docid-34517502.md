ALLEGED GENERAL CUBAN INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION IN THE
Nav YORK CITY AREA

NY T - 1 advised on November 3, 1960,
that he had learned that an unidentified individual
affiliated with the Cuban Consulate, New York City, made
a contact with a representative of the Hawmarluna kadio
Eqipment Outlet and inquired if a (Hammarlund-100}
which was owned by the Cuban Consulate could be utilized
with Koss head phones for short wave broadcasts. He
identified the Koss phones as four amperes lightweight.
The Hammarlund representative advised that this equipment.
was "satisfactory".

NY T - 2 advised on December 1, 1960, that
he was a former Cuban Police Officer and that after
FIDEL CASTRO assumed power in Cuba the Cuban Intelligence
Office reorganized, restaffed, and renamed G-2. _GERUASTO
REUW er ointed Chief of the Cuban G-2 and OCTAVIO .
RODRIQUEZ. made REUMON's assistant. Both of these
men were selected for their experience in police work,
their organizational ability and their judgment in
selection ‘of personfstl,”

According to T-2 REUMON and RODRIGUEZ

had molded the Cuban G-2 into an efficiently, operating
organization. The CASTRO government removed them from
G-2 upon the advise of Russian consultants who were ~
there 1 Guba and who favored and supported RAMIRO

ESSPOr the position of Chief of Cuban G-2 operations.
NY T - 2 advised that Cuban G-2 has some agents who
operate completely independent of fellow members of the
organization and report directly to RAMIRO VALDES.
Other Cuban G-2 agents operate as a group under group
leaders. He said that ordinarily a G-2 agent will not

know the identity of any other G-2 agents outside his

own group and that many of the G-2 agents in operation

do so without compensation in what appears to be a voluntary ser-
vice, According to T - 2 Cuban G-2 not only operates

agents in the United States. (US) and many other foreign
countries but also has agents within all the departments

and branches of the Cuban government.

NY T - 3, another government agency
which conducts security investigations abroad, advised
on December 6, 1960, that it Jearréd from a source which
it considers reliable that every month the Cuban National
Bank issues between one hundred and two hundred thusixd USddliars
in cash to RAUL CASTRO. The issuance of cash is shown
on the books as an expenditure for G-2 activities. T- 3
also advised that this money is probably used to finance 4
external activities since the money is issued in convertible
currency.

On January 10, 1961, NY T -4 advised that
the Cubam. Airlines have approximately 55 pilots and T - 4
estimated that approximately ten of these pilots are
members of the Cuban Secret Police. Source, however,
was unable to furnish the identity of these alleged
secret police affiliated with Cubana Airlines.

gt - 4 did advise, however, that fren
his knowledge of the financial aspects of Cubana it
was his opinion that the airline is presently operating
at a financial loss. However, the CASTRO government
is interested in continuing the operation of the airline
mainly for political and intelligence reasons.

on January 4, 1961, NY T - 5 advised on
that date’ from an unidentified source employed with Cubana

from Havana, Cuba. Ke planes captain was met by
ANGEL JOSE ARANGOS e District Manager of Cubana Airlines
in New York, and was driven by NGO to the Cuban
Consulate, 625 Madison Avenue, New York City.

signed by the chiefs of the two of four mentioned Suban
departments and authorizes the Bearer to leave Cuba and
return at will for a period of one year.

yy Tt - 8 advised that the significance of
this change in regulation was that the ordinary Cuban
citizen is obliged by Cuban law to carry this travel
document. However, T - 8 knows it to be a fact tnat
exceptions are made for Cuban Intelligence Agents and
other Cuban citizens highly trusted by the Cuban Revolutionary
Government. In these cases the Cuban Police mere
furnishes a special certificate’ which states that, the courtesy:
of the Cuban Revolutionary Government the Bearer is
authorized to depart Cuba. These special certificates
do not require a photograph of the Bearer and unlike
the regular identification card the special certificate
must be surrendered to the Cuban Police at the point
of embarkation in Cuba just prior to the individual's
departure.
