CARLOS MARCELLO, aka.
ANTI-RACKETEERING

Attached is a letterhead memorandum concerning the
recovery of some slot machines by a Deputy Sheriff in Jefferson
Parish from the home of another Jefferson Parish Deputy Sheriff,
which has resulted in considerable publicity in the New Orleans
newspapers since 2/3/61. This is being forwarded to the Bureau
inasmuch as publicity in the newspapers has indicated that the
Jefferson Parish Crime Commission has directed a wire to the
Attorney General requesting a Federal investigation in Jefferson
Parish.

The ALOYSIUS P. DARGIS mentioned in the attached s
memorandum is a PCI of the New Orleans Office, but agents handline’
him have been unable to contact him since this matter came to
iight. DARGIS will be located and interviewed concerning this
matter and further’ memoranda will be submifted.
