PLACE Hotel, 1230-1500 Hours 7 :

Aaa
1. Preliminary meeting was in the hotel room but the bulk of the dis-,

cussion took place during lunch and afterwards. The gist of the discussion ‘
with TICHBORN was as follows: i

iM \
rn

a, TICHBORN explained how he had been surprised at the sudden i
loss of interest by Antonio Menendez in the project and particularly in,,
introducing TICHBORN to other contacts. TICHBORN says that the | +
reason for this is Menendez" sudden recognition of the danger to his |
political future in even indirectly being connected with what could become :
a controversial book. TICHBORN attempted to develop various hypotheses :
for the revelation of this fear at this time rather than earlier in the ‘ :
negotiations. There was, however, no really clear explanation of why i i
Menendez had 50 suddenly drawn into his shell.

|
i
r

b. TICHBORN was asked whether he felt,that in some ways we 4
were not "taken" by Menendez. He responded with considerable heat by: -
Saying that it was a calculated gamble that "just didn't pay off". He ,, if
became very defensive when the discussion turned to the original evaluation \
of Antonio Menendez. He says that he is convinced that Menendez has’ ',
the information as well as the cor.tacts and in short was the right man but
one who turned out to be unwilling to run the risks involved for the "small
amount of money" he would be paid. TICHBORN attempted to make a |,
strong case for his belief that Menendez was the right man and emphasized
(somewhat apart from the point) that some day he will have an important!
post in a future PRI government. TICHBORN says the whole problem |).
was discussed with Stan Watson who agreed that the project could not be!



-2- Hanes

productive now due to the sudden reluctance of Antonio Menendez. and

Jose Luis Siqueiros to introduce TICHBORN to their contacts. Stan’. .
Watson also felt, according to TICHBORN, that it would be risky.for ;
TICHBORN to contact Gonzalez Casanova, Cholula and Urquidi. While!
details of the discussions between Watson and TICHBORN were not’; |
given, it seems that the decision not to proceed was reached without any
major hassle between TICHBORN and Stan Watson. (Comment: TICHBORN 1
appears to be not at all unhappy about terminating what could have i; - t
become a long and unproductive research effort built on a shaky story ‘
of TICHBORN writing a book on the PRI.) oan

c. Antonio Menendez wrote up in hglish some of his comments, 1
based on his approach to the research problem. This 13 3 page double ‘
spaced report is attached. : - ct :

oui d, Chaconas asked TICHBORN how well he knew Carlos Fuentes ’ |
: (for possible BGBERET targeting). TICHBORN replied that he knew .
him very well and that he felt he could approach him directly if he-hada
reason for being in Paris (vacation, for example) or wherever -Fuentes
is now living. TICHBORN said that he believed Fuentes would accept an
assignment to write articles on North Vietnam based on a future visit
_to that area but he also indicated that he believed we could not control ij
the tone, of the articles which would be likely to be pro-North Vietnam. - |

2, TICHBORN was asked by LEP to review the list of trips TICHBORN

BUBJECT: Outstanding Loan Account 7 Edward G, TICHBORN (1
Henry 8, Lopez

1 In the attached informal note by Edvard G.
TICHEORN, he states that he recalls 'on or about «
Septenber 10, 1366 that, in a meeting with several h
Agency ‘representatives, he received tacit ackrowledgenent i
that there would be no problem for the teaporary delay, |,
in his repaying of an outstanding account. None of ci
the Agency representatives believed to have beon present | |,
at this vaguely deseribed meeting specifzically recalls :
discussions of this outstanding account and specific
arrongesente for its handling. Nevertheless, it is fi
believed quite possible that casual reference to it fe
may have been made at one of the meetings with TICHBORN ‘|;
and eitber through misunderstanding or gencral overeicht, |
the problom was not folloved through, in that repaynents | |!
are being sade on a continuing regular basis ip satisfactory
manner, Its believed no further action is required pro- {)
vided that repayment continues at the rate of $125 per
wonth as agreed until the advance is mect in full.

2.. The purpose of this reno is to state the
reason of non-payment during the period August 1386 -
January 1967 and vill _ to docunent, TICABORN's loan

Copy of letter from Edward G. TICHBORN

"On or about September 10, 1966 I had a meeting with three or
four gentlemen in Washington (as I recall, they were Jerry Droller,
Jack Kaufman, and someone else) andI informed
these gentlemen that my moving expenses had been considerably
more than I had estimated. However, I told these gentlemen that
rather than ask for an additional amount, I wished to serve a Hh
moratorium of loan payments for six months. One of these t
men (with a nod from dother) said “okay--don't worry about it-- ij

just don't ask for an additional allotment. We'll take care of it."

“At this point we moved on to another topic, and I assumed I would

be allowed to skip payments for six (6) months.

DO's proprietary WUSALINE under Project WUBRINY. WUSALIE has
an affiliate in Madrid. The cperational potential of WUSALIIE's
Spanish affiliate and that of its local directors has not been
fully determined. DO, EUR and COS, Madrid} are interested in
determining the access of the local directors to intelligence
targets and in assessing the affilicte as a cover vehicle. As
WUSALINE's officer concerned vith Latin Anerica, Tichborn is
considered a logical choice. ‘rem the cover viewpoint for this
assignment. He also has considerable WOFACT experience, meets
people easily, is fluent in Spanish, and is’a graduate of the
Harvard Law School. The latter fact is important, considering
the legal background of the affiliate's local directors.

3. If you epprove, it is envisaged that the operation will

concurred in a TDY by Pickborn and can provide on-the-spot

Discussions with w/e 3 re Possible Use of Bdverd 0.
TPichborn (P) in Spain :

: : ; il}
a i
1. the unterstencd lunched on 15 Decenber 1956 with Mr, Lee Patten,
the WH/6 Caze Officer for Edvard G. TICHBORN (P), vho is under WUSALTNE,
cover in New York. Mr. Patten vas formerly COS Managua and now Deputy"
Chief, WH/6 under Mr. Peul Oberct. He 16 a very coupotent and conscientious
case officer. He believes that WH Division should get the most operaticnal
benefits possible froa Tichborn, inasmuch as WH Division ta paying Tich-
Dorn's salary. He 1c working diligently to acu up with operational tenet
ecsignsenta for Tichborn. Ee has Tichborn working on tv> research fi
projects and hopes to establish Tichborn as & political advisor to I
. the Government of the Dominican Republic. Although WH Divieion is fut
suffering bufiget cuts, vnich Mr. Potten lemmnts, bis project for ‘ie fiestag
Tichborn has been epproved for one year and funds are evsilable. tis

i 2, In view of Mr, Patten'a conscientious approach as case \
efficer for Tiskborn ani come known parcchialien in ¥i, the y
vadersigned felt 1t unvice to proes Me. Patten for more than
egproval for Tiehborn to make a 2-3 weeks trip to Spain. In
feet, the undersigned had te present o considerable case for

: even this limited use of Tichborn. Hovever, as a result, it
: fo believed that Mr. Patten vill support in WH Division a TDY
in Spain for Mebborn cf 2-3 weeks duration at DO expense.
Mr. Potton will call the undersigned on 19 Desenber. to report
the WH position.

3. ‘The undersigned seized upon the buiget eut point to voluntesr | | ‘
that DO would be amenable to helping out with Tichborn's salary if ry
WH 10 herd pressed. Mr. Patten declined, inasmuch as his project '
1s epproved for one ycar. He hopes to get so many operational benefits!
frou Tichborn that he will heave no problem renewing the project next | |’
. . year. He aid admit that DO's willingness to pay Tichborn's expenses ..\ °.
oo" " Qa salary while op a TDY to Spain should balp him sell the proposal 4 |
’ ~ © bis superiors. ah

&, The undersigned pointed out that he haf not yet approached =|:
tho Spanish Desk on a TDY for Tiehborn, because it vas desired to. ih



get WH Division's vievs ao a first step. Mr. Patten oaid ‘hat in
‘the event, of WH approval of a TDY to Spain for Tichborn that

he vould like to participate with DO anf the Spanish Desk in

the briefing of Tichborn. The underaigned readily concurred.

Mr. Patten thinks that Tichborn should not be a global asset

‘but rather one limited to Latin Ancrica. However, he did

concur with the undersigned that Spain represents an exception
‘because of language uni historical ties to Latin America.

Mr. Patten otrongly hopes Tichborn.can be a political advisor

. to the Doxinican Republic Covenment. He would not think of

reocemeuling to his superiors more than 9 2-3 weeks TDY for
Tichborn with tha understanding that the afvicor roq:irenent
has priority. The undersigned pointed out that DDP considers
tha Spanish requireaent high priority, and that use of Tichborn
for o TOY to Spain vould surely be an important Justification
when project renewal time cones around.

5. It 18 hoped that Wi'a position will be favorable for a
2-3 wauks use of Pichborn sn Spain. Any pressing of WH for wos
of Tishborn over a longer period 13 @ matter of delicacy. The
undersigned Inova that WH feels they were coerced into accepting
Project VUENTEEE. The urlersigned would not reccemend pressure.
On the contrary, the undursignod hao hoped to use Tichborn as a
means of cpening up Latin America for Project WUBRINY.

MEMO : To

IN RE: Projected trip through Latin America

Bearing in mind that our, executive committee mf

some future but presently undetermined date) desire Lo}

to undertake in-depth surveys of economic conditions.

th
certain Latin American countries, we consider it highly de-

ri,

Sirable to establish prior contacts witn the banking and

business communities of several'selected areas which: are’
most likely to offer, ‘sound investment opportuni tves.

Our past experience indicates that it 1s much caster to

assess spontaneous financiai ventures if one is already :

acquainted with the business ambiance of a particularilcountry.

Thus, having previously touched base with local bankétts ang

industrialists, Lopez would have the advantage of thier

personal advice in matters relating to any specific sup-

sequent projects.
The countries that would seem to offer the most) prez-

so it
ising opportunities for are PERU, CHILE, ARGENTINA,

URUGUAY, BRAZIL and VENEZUELA. Fortunately, we nave idireaty

established certain minimal ties with most of these countries,

but: it would be best for Lopez himself to become personally

acquainted with our contacts therein. a

rath

bat

im order to save time and money, it would te dbs sapie
it

one “to visit all these countries in a single round-tne-nemisphere

i



trip. Taking into account the normal travel delays, ;
trip would require about eighteen (18) days. it

Budget requirements: "4

I
id

le
|

1) Airline fares - $550 per person.
This is Pan American Airlines special ‘nwanter
fare." Normally, the trip costs $840 Per person.

: 2) Lodging, food and minimal entertainment |
expenses - about $35 daily per person..|| :
Total for each person would be about $630.

3) Miscellaneous expenses (cab fares to anil from :°
airports, in-town ‘cab fares, phone calls, .
secretarial costs; etc.) - about $100.' //

pk

Since the month of December is generally a sit

business period in most of these countries, we woula” ‘Huszest
that this trip be made in the month of January, 19674"

cenetered aroun _| the trip to Central America and CIA/DO __ ||
relations with The following points of interest were gleaned in |;
this period, :

uth

a. is a highly-trained promoter who-is coldly reserved! |
and capable. Ie seems to be generally pleased with TICHBORN and)
his capabilities for serving the firm as legal advisor, contact man, i
and unofficial economic consultant on economic matters.

b. TICHBORN likes his cover company, and the work |
itself.

if let alone, would use 100% of TICHBORN's time.

when he brought this up, LEP used it as a starting place for briefing

on the general nature of TICHBORW's functions of the past.
was told that he would need TICHBORN for "research activities" , if
in addition to any use involving special trips to Latin America. He t
was told we would need 50% or more of TICHBORN's time to carry 7
out these activities. It was pointed out to'him that because of the | ih

nature of TICHBORN's services, we would have to insist that he be. ||

available for immediate use and hence could not be on any long-range :

projects which would be difficult to drop. = or ! |

@YEHBORE concurs in this estimate of the lack of security proble:
within the office.

2. After leaving| _| we went to dinner where the following
subjects were discussed:

a. LEP pointed cut clearly that he was "the boas" and responsible
for TICHBORN's operational utilization. TICHBORN was told that | '!
Gaftis responsible for the commercial setup. There appeared to
be no doubt in his mind as to who calls the shots.

Pe
ont
b. TICHBORN was told of our need for an experienced Latin | i
American specialist who could handle political action research on key | \
issues in certain countries. He was also told of our interest in possible
CA covert action advisory tasks, Our need for someone able to make!
meaningful interpretive analyses was explairied in some detail and;
examples of probable areas and issues were presented. TICHBORN’ |
said he had no special experience in content analysis or survey analysis '
techniques. However, he was apparently very much Interested in the || ot
idea. He said that he would get the book suggested on content analysis:
He will check into the availability of the Dominican Republic papers | it
mentioned and let LEP know by 5 November if they can be had in Kew a
York City. He was requested to approach the provlem along the general |
following lines: Analyze the Bosch anti-government statements for th

indications of whom he ts trying to reach, how, and for what reason | |.

(since June 15). Similarly analyze the Balaguer statements and determine:

1) Influences the news media 1s having on his public image. : 4

..2) Where and how could he strengthen this image. a
3) What igsues should be raised or surpressed. at

It was suggested that the try to get issues of El Caribe and Listin Diario,

3. LEP's initial impressions of TICHBORN were as follows: He is very,
intelligent and in addition is sharp". He has a professionally smooth and | t
friendly manner. He is a natural politican. He is an "operator" and will rik

that will try to hire him for his company.or he may make contacts:

in New York City which could lead to his getting a non-C1A job.

HEMORANDUM FOR; Central Cover Staff, Non-Official Cover
SUBJECT : Cover for Edward G, Tichbora

1. Edward G, Tichborn, a Contract Agent, is presently
assigned to Mexico Station under non-official, personal cover.
He is in Mexico ostensibly ag a consultant with a Mexican
legal firm and acts as editor/publisher of a left-wing intel-
lectual publication, Vialoxos, ie has requested reassipnuent
to the United States, preferably the Last Coast and particularly
the New York City area, H Division has concurred in his
request to leave Hexico City in mid-August 1966 and desires
to arrange suitable cover which would permit rapid disengagenent
at any time from regular day-to-day cover duties to undertake i
temporary duty assigneents throughout Latin America at the Lae z
request of this Division. ieee |

2, WA Division in its investigetion of cover possibilities REE pi %
discussed the problem with ir. Stanley Gaines, LO/H, Mr. Robert
Fallow, CA/2 and dr. Gale Allen, DODS, Hr. Gaines investigated
the possibility of Tichborn's assignnent to the Domestic Operations

facility in New York but the New York office did not believe it ‘ ie ‘
Mr, Fallow checked on the possibility t i

operations in the New York area but these were finally judged

as not providing the neccessary flexibility; and finally, as you

have seen in cable traffic, Mr. Allen came up with a possibility H ; 3
of assigning Tichborn to WUSALINE, i

3. On the basis of information nade available by ir, Allan,
WH Division believes the WUSALINE proposal has merit and wishes 4
to develop this cover proposal further. It would appear that a i
satisfactory resolution at this tine ultimately rests upon WH i
Division agreement with Tichborn on teras of his contract, !
primarily salary, and WUSALINE agreement that Tichborn's back~
ground is of sufficient depth to provide a modicus of credibility
and his personality is of such a nature that he would be coapat-
ible with the principal agent. This will be resolved after
Labor Day when Tichborn will be in the United States and the
WUSALINE principal agent will have returned from a vacation
which he is starting about 1 August. In the meantine, in con-
Pliance with regulations for the establishment of non-official
cover, the {cllowing background information is provided concerning
Tichborn and is keyed to your memorandum, “Non-Official Cover

Request":

Although TICHBORN painted a rather bleak pleture of the possible

We discussed TICHBOPNts personal situation and desires for the
future at some length. - Although not being able to offer specific
Promises of long-term enploynent on his terms at this time, we advised

him that the Ageney would probably have recurring requirements, albeit relati

business and social contacts throughout Latin America. Follow
ing graduatioy from Harvard Law School in 1948, TICHBORN
became affiliated with a law firm in Los Angelea which
represented many Latin American corporations with California -—
business connections. In the mid-1950's he became active in
California state politics and served in various capacities in
Democratic Party state and national organizations. He
participated actively in the California gubernatorial campaign
of James Roosevelt, the senatorial campaign of Helen Gahagan
Douglas and both the 1952 and 1956 Stevenson cappaigns for the
Presidency. He his been President of the Southern California
Young Democrats, a member of the: California Derocratic State

1956 Democratic National Convention and a member of the Board
of Directors of the Xational Democratic Minority Conference.
In 1960 he served as Los Angeles coordinator of the Kennedy
Movement for Americans of Mexican Extraction which, it is
reported, contributed substantially to the success of the
Kennedy campaign in Southern California. His only try for
elective office was in 1958 when he was defeated in his bid
for the position of California Secretary of State.

2. In late 1959,‘ TICHBORN was hired by the Agency as a

political action advisor for Agency-sponsored election operations
throughout Latin America. _In 1961 he became a fulltine _

contract agent and was assifmed to Mexico City, under personal
cover, to establish a degree of security and mobility which would
Permit him to travel readily on third country political action
assignnentz. Since the beginning of his relationship with the
Agency, he has participated in Agency sponsored political
operations in Cuba, El S-t=04 SiasnsusoaSnEsussnnas
the Dominican Republic. | i

| The Station has described his role in the operation as
{ .a@ vital aspect....at a critical moment in the operation...
Ae o *....Station knows few, if any, people who could have ‘

handled this assignnent | the _way_TICHBORN did." —

a

3. \TICHBORN has contributed stories, articles and
interviews to a variety of United States publications. An
interview by TICHBORN of Catherine inne Porter, Pulitzer prize.
winner, appeared in a recent edition of Harpers and a <TICHBORN- ~
essay concerning the cultural dichotomy under Which MBxican
Americans exist, will appear in an early edition of the American
Heritage publication. He is working on a series of articles
and a book on the population problem in Latin America and is
considering a book on Mexican political institutions,
particularly the Partido Revolucionario Institutional (PRI).

‘left wing intellectual publication (LIREAM). His cover
in Mexico is nominal and he attributes his presence and
activities primarily to his connections in the legal field

intellectual interests.

Ref: A, HMMA 27025, 26 August 1965

B. HMMW 14392, 10 March 1966

1. Project LICOLIC has been renewed for Fiscal Year 1966 in‘
the amount of $19,000 as requested. This approval was effective
2 March 1966.

2. As you are aware there has been a good deal of discussion
here concerning TICHBORN's operational activities and how he might
best contribute to the overall objectives of the Station. It was
agreed during EDGEBROOK's visit here (See Ref B) that TICHBORN
would be considered henceforth as a full time Station asset and
attention would be given to gaining maximum value from his continued
presence in Mexico, Within this context, however, it should also
be noted that this Project was renewed for Fiscal Year 1966 with
the condition that ". . . prior to the end of.the current fiscal
year (1966), adequate cover is found to afford TICHBORN rot only
the needed mobility and safeguards for his work in behalf of the
Mexico Station, but also for his possible third country political
action assignments. . In addition, the following recommendation
was made in the event Project LIREAM should not be renewed ( which
should not really be considered at present since agreement was

reached to approve Project LIREAM also), ". . . If this turns out
ta be the case we would:recoumend that TICIBQRN be reassigned to
another area (suggest ZRMETAL) under the. type of cover (e.g. JETUBA)
which would offer him the needed mobility and protection for area-
wide political action assignnents . . .". Needless to say, although
the latter point should be kept in mind as a last alternative in
any decision regarding ‘TICHBORN's continued relationship with this
Agency, the Branch believes that the LIREAN publication has im
proves! and has a good chance to gain acceptance and expand its
influence throughout the hemisphere. This being the case, and

as Station plans for expanding TICHBORN's activity within Mexico
take form, we hope his contribution to KUBARK objectives in Mexico
and throughout Latin America will become more substantial and
recognized.

3. Aga matter of information, Headquarters would appreciate
TICHBORN preparing a summary of his present cover situation, par~
ticularly his appreciation of his present residence and work
status in Mexico, and his estinate of what the future holds for
him in this regard. Further, we would appreciate any indication
the Station may have concerning TICHEORN's personal plans in regard
to his continued residence in Mexico and his future rei.itionship

with KUBARK.
