and names of a number of members, So far as has been learned
from informants, this had very little adverse effect upon the
organization. It was alleged that two to five members were
discharged from their jobs, or warned about continuing member~
ship, but the identities of thes! liegéa@ persons is not known,
Noxtn—Carelina- Grand—2: agon—a20i2s RACES has stated, both
publicly ‘and privately to informants, that this publicity was

ara that the day after the articles published his name as
a local leader, three persons contacted him and applied for
pcseorceeianrty py stating they had not previously known whom to contact,

It is considered that publicity of this “type generally
eters from joining only those persons who would not be
interested in joining in the first’place. It is believed that
a large proportion of those persons who are potential members
are seeking status and recognition, and publicity is no deterrent
to them; it makes them feel important and members of an import ant
GYOUD.s

The major apparent effect of the series of newspaper
articles referred to has been a tightening up of security, and
refusal of leaders to allow newspaper photos of individual
Klansmen to be taken at public rallies.

3. Disruptive activity, wherever possible, should be of
a mature which does not expose the fact that the Bureau, or the
“Federal Government", is behind the activity. It is believed
that open action, to a large extent, can backfire and create
resentment and sympathy. It must be remembered that Klan
membership, in many sections, does not by any means carry the
odium that alleged Communist membership ox sympathy does in
almost any section of society.

4, Along this same line, there is probably no poi: ab i
txying disruptive activity, at least not at this stage, on a
local Klan group which is small, inactive, and peaceful. any
such acti t is not completely discreet and caacealed
would likely have the effect of stirring it up,

Klonvocation of United Klans of Amexica at Birmingham on
9/5-6/64,. This is to be sold to members for $2 each and
there is apparently considerable demand for it. Since it is
not apparent to the unitiated that it has anything to do

with "the Klan,” it is expacted that members will wear it
openly as a secret recognition signal. If it does become
widely adopted and worn, consideration should then be given to
giving widespread publicity to the fact of what it represents,
This should have the result of discouraging some persons who
Go not want their Klan membership publicly known.

6, It is considered that possibly the most effective
way of discourgging membership, or causing existing membars
to withdraw, is to establish that someone in the organization
is getting rich off it, or embezzling the proceeds. Charlotte
is endeavoring to develop information along these lines, but
nothing specific has yet been developed.

S/S. fhe following are suggested tactics that appear
useful on a selected basis against individual Klansmen,
particularly those whose employers might object to their Klan
membershirc:

a. Anonymous letter or phone call to the employer
telling of the Klan membership.

b. Enter on behalf of the member a subscription to
the "Fiery Cross," United Klans of America publication, and have
it mailed to his employment.

c. When a particular member is away from home at a
Klavern meeting, have a female phone his home and indicate he
was to meet her and is late. is might have the effect of
making it difficult for him to get away from home at night
thereafter. This should be limited to particular individuals

that this was a chartere: d, legalized movement and

it is no more,illegal to be a member of than to be a

At various times in the past the klavern has

in line with Bureau policy of dissemination of
information, the main activities regarding the Pine Bluff
Klavern have been disseminated confidentially to Chief
of; Police NORMAN.D. YOt Pine:.Blufi, (NA) on a regular
basis. Chie: MOUNG- has exerted every effort to keep down
the poss ty of violence, Through his confidential
sources ‘he is also well aware of the identities of the
klavern members and their activities. He personally
hes warned particulz klavern members against any violence
and has stated they will be met with immediate arrest

if any violence occurs, AS an example, Chtet=YOUNG’was

advised through his own confidential source of the time
and location of the klavern meeting on the night of
Cctober 5, 1964, Chief¥OUNG sent a lieutenant of his
de artnent in uniform to check the location, record
license numbers, and to be seen checking the meeting so
that the klavern members would know that he was checking

-on them, This has had a strong influence on making the

kiavern follow a line of legal activity. It has also
resulted in the more responsibie leading citizens of the
community being made aware of certain klavern members,
hese klayern members to be discredited in the 7
eyes of the public. This was borne out in the recent .
school board election on 9/29/64 when two klavern members,

As the Bureau is aware, Some fev months ago several
individuals, who had been active officials and/or dedicated
members of the National States Rights Party (NSRP), left
the NSEP. They are trying to form and make a going party-
of the American States Rights Party (ASRP) with its head~
quarters in Birmingham.

Since the group pulled out of the NSRP, both 7
the ASRP and NSRP leaders have been belittling, berating
and making extremely derogatory remarks concerning each
other, Both groups are using the same mailing li
{the NSRP's list), which the ASRP group obtained. before
pulling out of the NSRP, and they disseminate their ~
derogatory remarks inthe literature they suadiaiebiatiand

Birmingham also is considering having some racial

to.be approximately 45 members. The other klan organization
under investigation in this division is the United Kians of

penetration of subversive organizations through informants, anonymous sources,
sophisticated microphone and technical surveillances, interview programs of
a highly specialized nature, etc., and that his division could put this experience
to excellent use in penetrating the Klan and other hate groups.

Memo fox Mr. Tolson
Re: Investigation of Ku Klux Klan and Other Hate Groups _

Loe le al

One of the prime factors in the decision to‘transfer these responsibilities s from the
DID in 1958 was the almost complete absence of Communist Party activity i in the
racial area although at that time the Communist Party sought to capitalize on such
incidents after their occurrence. : : |

Mr. Rosen was opposed to the transfer of the functions in question to the
General Investigative Division in 1958 and his present position is consistent in that
he maintains that the development of informants and the penetration of the Klan
and other hate groups are primarily intelligence functions which should be handled
by the DID as suzts - OSE ae
best keep abreast of the whole field by having ‘all angles of the racial field united
in one division as suggested by Mr. Sullivan. Mr.. Rosen points out that the
development, supervision and administrative handling of racial and security
informants are analogous.

RoupnnucunasueauseananSaGi ————_

: Mr. Rosen feels that there is a tendency toward oversimplification
in blaming all racial murders on Klansmen and hate groups. He points out that the
murders of Medgar Evers, Postman Moore and even the assassination of President
Kennedy were initially and generally attributed to Klan and hate gin up members
whereas invcstigation showed that the individuals charged with the murders of
| Evers and Moore were without organization affiliation and the Presi dent was
slain by an avowed Marxist who was active in the Fair Play for Cuba Committee.

CL

cases, i.e. bombings, murders, police brutality, etc., should be handled by the
General Investigative Division. Mr. Rosen feels that whether subject or victims

; pare Klan members, Communist Party members or completely without organizational
affiliation has no more bearing on our supervision of the substantive civil rights
violation than it would have if the violation involved were Theft from Interstate Shipment,
Bank Robbery or White Slave Traffic Act.

‘ .
| Mr. Rosen and Mr. Sullivan both agree that the investigation of individual

Mr. Belmont disagrees with Messrs. Rosen and Sullivan and feels
that while the proposed transfer of functions from the General Investigative
to the Domestic Intelligence Division is theoretically appealing, it is nota
practical answer to our problem.. He states that at the time of the 1958 transfer
of functions in question the basis was the close inter-relationship between the
activities of the Klan and hate groups and the entire civil rights field of investigation.
He feels this argument has even more strength today than in 1958, because, over~-
whelmingly, our interest in Klan and hate groups today is their relationship with
integration and civil rights. Mr. Belmont believes the transfer of fufictions would
j create an undesirable division of authority and responsibility; that our best chance
to break major civil rights cases such as bombings, murders, etc., is through
information developed from the inside as a result of coverage established in the

community where the crime occurred; i.e. informants and sources in ‘the Klan, hate
groups, subversive organizations, ‘but also sources not connected with any group,
who will report potential violence and individuals prone to violence. We are following|
the policy of aggressively seeking out persons addicted to violence even though they
have not violated a Federal law as yet. He feels that the Division that is going to
investigate these cases should forge the necessary tools to use for this purpose.
Mr. Belmont does not feel that the transfer of this responsibility will be helpful to the
Bureau from an investigative standpoint nor in meeting the heavy-respons bilities we no
have in this area. : : 7

VIEWS OF THE INSPECTION DIVISION: ¢ : “+?

| Inspector feels there is certainly some merit and logic in Mr. Belmont's
reasoning and it is felt instant issue is not one that is completely black or white.

17
;
i

Under the present setup there is coordination and daily exchange of
-] information between Domestic Intelligence and General Investigative Divisions
in that both Divisions insure that communications and other matters of information
are brought to the attention of each other as they arise from matters for which
peach Division is-primarily responsible. However, it seems the real issue today
just as in 1958, is where does the weight of the interest lie in the racial question.
In 1958 it clearly lay in the General Investigative Division because, according to
information available to the Bureau at that time, in practically no instances had
racial incidents been caused or inspired by Communist Party elements although
the Party naturally sought to capitalize on incidents after they occurred. Also,
in 1958, it was felt that consolidation would streamline certain operations.

= Today it seems clear from information developed by Domestic .
Intelligence Division that the Communist Party now has evidenced a definite interest
in the racial problem, is becoming deeply enmeshed therein, and appears to be
exploiting it to an ever-increasing extent. Although prosecution for civil rights
and other criminal violations is still an ultimate objective, there is definite
need for an intelligence type penetration of these racial and hate groups so as
to keep abreast of and ahead of their plans and activities. This seems more
properly the function of the Domestic Intelligence Division.

Analysis was made by Inspector relative to coverage of the Klan and other
hate groups. The General Investigative Division has been putting a great deal of
pressure on the field to increase informant coverage. They have recently instructed
the field to conduct surveys relative to instituting technical coverage on certain key {
Klan figures, Inve interviewed at least once all known Klan members all Klan. |
leaders have been investigated from intelligence standpoint and recommendations
have been made that intelligence type cases be opened on each Klan member, A
weekly progress airtel is being obtained from field concerning informant development. |
\\ However, undoubtedly additional coverage is needed particularly in the Klaverns
t have been formed since the civil rights bill passed. There is no question about

the fact tat the DID has had broad in the penetration ‘ of )st aversive
organizations and has achieved noteworthy results in infiltrating the ( ommunist
-| Party and Soviet intelligence operations. It is felt that unquestionably this
experience and know-how could be put to good advantage in penetrating the Klan
and other hate groups. : j
: !
j The Inspection Division feels that the advantages in having the
; | direction of all informant and intelligence matters in the racial field in one division
| | as outline a. Ei ia =
( hate group informants and intelligence functions with the substantive civil rights cases.
Under the proposed transfer of phases of.the racial problem to Domestic Intelligence
} Division there will still be definite responsibility in both divisions, Mr. Rosen
to retain responsibility for supervision of substantive civil rights violations and
other criminal violations. This dual responsibility, however, should pose no
roblem because there are numerous examples of it successfully being handled
in the Bureau today. In this regard it will be noted that the administrative handling
of the entire criminal informant program is handled by the Special Investigative
Division- which includes the informants being utilized on General Investigative
Division cases. It will also be noted that the Special Investigative Division handles
the informant and intelligence aspects of organized crime. However, the General
Investigative Division handles key substantive violations such as Bankruptcy,
-)Extortion, Assaulting a Federal Officer, and Theft drom Interstate Shipment
violations committed by members of the organized criminal syndicate utilizing
Criminal Intelligence informants. It is understood that there have been no in-
soluble problems in this regard and it is felt that there should be no insoluble
problems in the coordination of racial intelligence and informant information
between the General Investigative Division and the DID.

In any event there will certainly be no lessening of pressure and.
.| Supervision on the field if these functions are transferred. The same Agents
in the field will be working the cases and developing the informants. However,
it is felt that the DID should be given a chance to demonstrate whether their
broad knowledge of and experience in penetration techniques and infiltration
tactics can possibly increase our penetration of these hate groups. It is felt
that a study of counter-intelligence and disruption tactics against the Klan certainly
merits further consideration. It is also felt that the proposed series of fieid con-
ferences on this problem should be favorably considered.

Mr. Sullivan has proposed that the development of informint$ in t
= (KX) and other hate groups as wel: as ine investigation ana penetration oi t

organizations from an intelligence standpoint be transferred from the General
Investigative Division to the Domestic Intelligence Division (DID). He bases his
recommendations on the premise that organizations like the KKK and supporting
groups are essentially subversive in that they hold principles and recommend courses
of action that are inimical to the Constitution as are the viewpoints of the Communist
Party. He does not maintain that the actions of the hate groups constitute the same
menace as the Communist Party inasmuch as they are not controlled by. a foreign

power, QewnTeeriT eli gen way Prag zig = Disru pT!

dh OF He Te Sraoyy

He feels that the DID over the years has developed wide experience in the
penetration of subversive organizations through informants, anonymous sources,
sophisticated microphone and technical surveillances, interview programs of
a highly specialized nature, etc., and that his division could put this experience
to excellent use in penetrating the Klan and other hate groups.

ise “Me. Sullivan feels that the DID would be in a position to launch a
disruptive counter~intelligence program against the Klan and other hate groups
with the game effectiveness that they are now doing insofar as the Communist Party —
is concerned. He also proposes an immediate series of regional conferences to

pertinent field personnel and to devise imaginative, aggressive and highly

specialized programs to carry out the responsibilities in question. He states the ,
Communist Party is increasing its activities in the field of racial matters and te }.
civil rights, directing more and more of its fire against the KKK and similar
organizations to confuse the issue. He feels that because of the stepped up uu ae
activities of the Communist Party in this area it would help prevent marked confusion
from developing in the areas of activities being handled by the General Investigative

and Domestic Intelligence Divisions if the DID assumes these responsibilities.

Memo fod Mr. Tolson : ac
Re: Investigation of Ku Klux Klan and Other Hate Groups

One of the prime factors in the decision to transfer these responsibilities from the
DID in 1958 was the almost complete absence of Communist Party activity in the

racial area although at that time the Communist Party sought to capitalize on such
incidents after their occurrence. | |

Mr. Rosen was opposed to the transfer of the functions in questi to the
| General Investigative Division in 1958 and his present position is consistent in that
he maintains that the development of informants and the penetration of the Klan
and other hate groups are primarily intelligence functions which should be handled
by the DDD as 3% E yehQE She Te:
best keep abreast of the whole field by having all angles of the racial field united
in one division as suggested by Mr. ‘Sullivan. Mr. Rosen points out that the
development, supervision and administrative handling of racial and security
informants are analogous.

rs

; Mr. Rosen feels that there is a tendency toward oversimplification
in blaming all racial murdérs on Klansmen and hate groups. He points out that the
il murders of Medgar Evers, Postman Moore and even the assassination of President
| Kennedy were initially and generally attributed to Klan and hate gm up members
whereas investigation showed that the individuals charged with the murders of
Evers and Moore were without organization affiliation and the Pres dent was
slain by an avowed Marxist who was active in the Fair Play for Cuba Committee.

L bd] ql
Mr. Rosen and Mr. Sullivan both agree that the investigation of individual
eases, i.e. bombings, murders, police brutality, etc., should be handled by the
| General Investigative Division. Mr. Rosen feels that whether subject or victims

affiliation has no more bearing on our supervision of the substantive civil rights

violation than it would have if the violation involved were Theft from Interstate Shipment,

; pare Klan members, Communist Party members or completely without organizational
| fe Robbery or White Slave Traffic Act.

Mr. Belmont disagrees with Messrs. Rosen and Sullivan and feels

| that while the proposed transfer of functions from the General Investigative

to the Domestic Inteligence Division is theoretically appealing, it is nota
practical answer to our problem.. He states that at the time of the 1953 transfer
of functions in question the basis was the close inter-relationship between the
activities of the Klan and hate groups and the entire civil rights field of investigation.
He feels this argument has even more sirength today than in 1958, because, over~
whelmingly, our interest in Klan and hate groups today is their relationship with
integration and civil rights. Mr. Belmont believes the transfer of fufictions would
4create an undesirable division of authority and responsibility; that our best chance
to break major civil rights cases such as bombings, murders, etc., is through
\linformation developed from the inside as a,result of coverage established in the

community here. the crime occurred; tle. informants and sources 1
groups, subversive organizations, but also sources not connected with ny group,

}who will report potential violence and individuals prone to violence. iW are following
|the policy of aggressively seeking out persons addicted to violence even. though they
{have not violated a Federal law as yet. He feels that the Division that is going to
investigate these cases should forge the necessary tools to use for this purpose.

Mr. Belmont does not feel that the transfer of this responsibility will be helpful to the
Bureau from an investigative standpoint nor in meeting the heavy-responsibilities we now
have in this area. Tog

VIEWS OF THE INSPECTION DIVISION:

| Inspector feels there is certainly some merit and logic in Mr. Belmontts
reasoning and it is felt instant issue is not one that is completely black or white.

Under the present setup there is coordination and daily exchange of

| informati on between Domestic Intelligence and General Investigative Divisions
4an that both Divisions insure that communications and other matters of information
are brought to the attention of each other as they arise from matters for which
each Division is primarily responsible. However, it seems ihe real issue today
just as in 1958, is where does the weight of the interest lie in the racial question.
Jn 1958 it clearly lay in the General Investigative Division because, according to
information available to the Bureau at that time, in practically no instances had
racial incidents been caused or inspired by Communist Party elements although
‘the Party naturally sought to capitalize on incidents after they occurred. Also,
tin 1958, at was felt that consolidation would streamline certain operations.

. * Today it seems clear from information developed by Domestic

| Intelligence Division that the Communist Party now has evidenced a definite interest
in the racial problem, is becoming deeply enmeshed therein, and appears to be
exploiting it to an ever-increasing extent. Although prosecution for civil rights

and other criminal violations is still an ultimate objective, there is definite |

need for an intelligence type penetration of these racial and hate groups so as

to keep abreast of and ahead of their plans and activities. This seems more

properly the function of the Domestic Intelligence Division.

Analysis was made by Inspector relative to coverage of the Klan and other
hate groups. The General Investigative Division has been putting a great deal of :
pressure on the field to increase informant coverage. They have recently instructed
the field to conduct surveys relative to instituting technical coverage on certain key
Kian figures, In ve interviewed at least once all known Klan membersf all Klan. -
leaders have been investigated from intelligence standpoint and recommendations
have been made that intelligence type cases be opened on each Klan member. A i

) weekly progress airtel is peing obtained from field concerning informant development.

cabal undoubtedly additional coverage is needed particularly in the Klaverns

the fact that the DID has had broad experience in the penetration of ee
organizations and has achieved noteworthy results in infiltrating the Communist
-| Party and Soviet intelligence operations. It is felt that unquestionably this
-| experience and know-how could be put to good advantage in penetrating the, Klan
and other hate groups. \ oe
The Inspection Division feels that the advantages in having the
direction of all informant and intelligence matters in the racial field i in one division
as outl, rarees 2 Ci :
hate group informants and intelligence functions with the substantive civil rights cases.
Under the proposed transfer of phases of the racial problem to Domestic Intelligence
7 Division there will still be definite responsibility in both divisions, Mr. Rosen
to retain responsibility for supervision of substantive civil rights violations and
other criminal violations. This dual responsibility, however, should pose no
Uproblem because there are numerous examples of it successfully being handled
in the Bureau today. In this regard it will be noted that the administrative handling
jof the entire criminal informant program is handled by the Special Investigative
Division- which includes the informants being utilized on General Investigative ~
: Division cases. It will also be noted that the Special Investigative Division handles
\ the infurmant and intelligence aspects of organized crime. However, the General
Investigative Division handles key substantive violations such as Bankruptcy,
Extortion, Assaulting a Federal Officer, and Theftdrom Interstate Shipment
violations committed by members of the organized criminal syndicate utilizing
Criminal Intelligence informants. It is understood that there have been no in-
soluble problems in this regard and it is felt that there should be no insoluble
problems in the coordination of racial intelligence and informant information
between the General Investigative Division and the DID.

nal ammeiataael

In any event there will certainly be no lessening of pressure and.
.| supervision on the field if these functions are transferred. The same Agents
in the field will be working the cases and developing the informants. However,
it is felt that the DID should be given a chance to demonstrate whether their
broad knowledge of and experience in penetration techniques and infiltration
tactics can possibly increase our penetration of these hate groups. It is felt
that a study of counter-intelligence and disruption tactics against the Klan certainly
merits further consideration. It is also felt that the proposed series of field con-
ferences on this problem should be favorably considered.

of the Ku Klux Kian, Inc.,

of any Klan group; however, he has considerable influence
and contacts among many of the members of United Klans.

This situation appears to offer an opportunity to
capitalize upon the personal conflict of two Klan leaders.
We propose the following action:

Instruct Racial Informant ROBERT LEE DAVIDSON,
dR., to agree to help BING oust CRAIG as Grand Dragon for
Géorgia and instruct DAVIDSON to actively work with BING
to achieve CRAIG's ouster.

: ba
BING has considerable following, particularly
in the rural area south of Atlanta. DAVIDSON has contacts

of America, Inc., in North Carolina, and published both photos

and names of a number of members. So far as has been learned

from informants, this had very little adverse effect upon the
organization. It was alleged that two to five members were
discharged from their jobs, or warned about continuing member—
ship, but the identities of thes Llegéa persons is not known,
Noexth-Carelina- Grand-—Dragen-daMas-RaAcOQNES has stated, both q
publ oly ‘and privately to informants, that this publicity was seeaes
very valuable to the growth of the organization. One informant
xveported that the day after the articles published his name as

a local leader, three persons contacted him and applied for
membership, stating they had not previously known whom to contact.

It is considered that pubrreity of thistype generally
deters from joining only those persons who would not be
interested in joining in the fizrst place. It is believed that
a lasge proportion of those persons who are potential members

ate seeking status and recognition, and publicity is no deterrent
to them; it makes them feel important and members of an important
group.

Ghe major apparent effect of the series of newspaper
articles referred to has been a tightening up of security, and
refusal of leaders to allow newspapér photos oe individual :
Klansmen to be taken at public rallies.

3. Disruptive activity, wherever possible, should be of
a mature which does not expose the fact that the Bureau, or the
“Pederal Government", is behind the activity. It is believed o
that open action, to a large extent, can backfire and create
resentment and sympathy. It must be remembered that Klan
membership, in many sections, does not by any means carry the
odium that alleged Communist membership or sympathy does in
almost any section of society.

4, Along this same line, there is probably no point in
trying disruptive activity, at least not at this stage, on a

DISRUPTION OF HATE GROUPS

Re Bulet to Atlanta 9/2/64

H fhe Klan-type and bate organizations operating in
' Birmingham territory and which are potential objects of a . 7
, counterintelligence program are the United Klans of
America, Ince, Knights of the Ku Kiux Kian and the National
States Rights Party.

Recently Mrs VINCENT TOWSEND;- Vice-President and *
Assistant--Dublishsr,--Birmingham-News; and.SAG-Contact,
advised SAC EVERETT 3, INGRAM that he read a story in tke
Chicago Daily--News concerning Klan activity in Mississippi
and felt the stery could not have been prepared without
FBE cooperation, He was impressed with this and has indicated
a strong interest in similar material for the Biemingham
4S, He promised to protect the Bureanss interest in
any such endeavor, He is a well known civic leader in
Birmingham. A raview of the files in the Birmingham Office
is being made for suitable information in this connection,

Bureau instructed in referenced letter that
specific mention be made of "Action Groups" in Kian
organizations, At the present time the weekly meetings of
Zastview Klavern No, 13, which has been the leading Klavern in
United Klans of America, Inc., in this terripry, have been
poorly attended, The principal members of the "Action Group"

in this Klavern are HARRY-WALKER, CECIL~HENSON, EUGENE—~
REBVES, and RONNIEWLTIDWELE; Efforts are being made to
secure information suitable for disruption purposes in
connection with this group.

Investigation is being conducted concerning
ROBERT-UARVIN- SHELTON. The Atlanta Office bas been ~
requested to ascertain why E.L.EDWARDS, now deceased,
ousted SHELEON-from his then position of _Grand-Dragon of
the U. S. Kieans. A copy of the article appea: gin
the 'Birmingham-—News’’ for April-30, 1550, entitled "SHELTON.
ousted from Klan Post," has been obtained. The article did
not disclose the exact nature of the charges against
SHREESN, Records of the Alabama Secret ary of State reflect
that SHELPON-was dropped as the Klan's authorized agent
and was replaced by Rev..ALViN-HORN of Talladega, Alabama,
BeolL,.HDHARBS, Impeviai—Fizard, U. 8. Klans, Knights of

As the Bursan is aware, some few months ago several
individuals, who had been active officials and/or dedicated
members of the National States Rights Party (NSRP), left
the NSRP. They are trying to form and make a going party
of the American States Rights Party (ASRP) with its head-~
quarters in Birmingham, 7

: Since the group pulled ont of the NSRP, both
the ASRP and NSRP leaders have been belittling, berating
and making extremely derogatory remarks concerning each {
other, Both groups are using the same. mailing list,

{the NSRP's list), which the ASRP group obtained. before
pulling out of the NSRP, and they Gisseminate their
derogatory remarks in the literature they distributes

The Bureau has 2iso beon advised that ~GEORGE.
LINGOLN-ROCZWELL, American Nazi Party (ANP) leader has
recently filed a $550,060.00 Tinel suit in the U. 3
District Court, Birmingham,-Alabama, against Drs-8:
BEBEDS, Information ~Director. of the’ NSRP, and others
connected with the NSRP, a

ROR.

Birmingham contemplates furnishing certain items,
on a confidential basis to a few trusted, -reliable newsmen
{established SAC contatts), concerning the NSRP,.the ASRD
and the ANP for the. purpose of possibly causing further
disruption of any unified actions or working arrangements
between these groups, Such newsmen may be used to contact
the leaders of one group to inguize about or confirm something of
a Cerogatory nature reportediy made by some leader of one of
the other groups,

Birmingham also contemplates working closely
yith other law enforcement agancies to see that any
aetivity of such groups are known, covered and where
considered desérable, the group vill be made cognizant
that their activity is knoyn.

‘Dear ir, Hoover: ‘ eH HEE eee

Thank you very much for your letter of July 17, 1964... |
i have-been giving this racial problem constant thought. Paren~ ~
thetically, I did what E could yesterday in New York to get dnat
office moving faster and more eff sctively in this matter,» Dee |
es bole

: You asked for suggestions and this is what I now offer
you for whatever little value it has.

(1) After writing you I recommended to the
Inspection Division that a study be made
relative to whether or not the Domestic
Intelligence Division can better handle

» certain aspects of the Civil Rights-Racial
a problem, Mr. Gaie is very much in favor
- * of this inquiry and is moving promptly in
eal “ this matter. i think the results of his
inguiry will be most helpful in evaluating
the situation.

What i have in mind basically is this:

You may want to, in light of his inquiry,

consider transferring the responsibility

for the development of informants in the

Kiu Klux Klan White Citizens Council and

related "hate" organizations to the Division

while leaving the responsibility for :
investigating bombings, killings, and so

forth where it now is. Wy idea is: This

- Division can bring to bear all the techniques, .--~ mane
skilis, and procedures which it has use:
to successfully penetrate the Communist Party 7
and espionage organizations to now penetrate
these hate organizations causing us so much
trouble, (In talking to Mr. Telson this |
morning I mentioned this briefly to him.)

if
(@)/iity idea is operationally sound, and if this
is done, I would immediately hold some
regional conferences in areas where the |
racial issue is acute and get under way in
sean santaeanse :

NW 65360 ‘Docld:32989629 Page 156 ; : : anna



wight when you say that informant develop~
ment of the right kind is essentially the
solution to our current problem, The number
of informants per se as we both know, are of
no significance, What we must have is the
right kind of informants on the right level.
The cld saying “The proof of the pudding is
in the eating” is relevant here because if
we had this kind of informant penetration,

we wouldn’t have some of these unsolved cases now
causing us so much concern, This is simply a
hard, stubborn fact we cannot theorize away.

{4) Further, we should expand our informant
penetration to cover some of these legitimate
but extremist organizations which we have up
to now ignored in this respect. They often
are “supporting” forces for such as the K.K.K,
ete. and we ought to be on the inside of them.

This then is my response to your letter for now, As
X have said, the Inspection Division is making the inquiry to
ascertain the operational facts and the feasibility of what I
suggest. :

Cordiaily,

such as to be handled by the Bureau on an intelligence basis. The
racial field is a most fertile field for Communist Party and other
subversive groups. There are indications of this such as in the
cases of Martin Luther King and Michael Schwerner, one of the
missing civil rights workers from Philadelphia, Mississippi, and
other situations. Also there are reports of foreign funds being used
to support the current actions of Malcolm X. The racial strife and
disorder are of such major significance as to have international
aspects and this. is tailor-made for the disruptive tactics of subversive
elements both right and left.

We cannot afford to divorce the national racial program from
its possible international aspects. The devices and tactics presently
in use in the security field should be utilized to the fullest in
developing intelligence information regarding national as well as
international developments in the racial strife. The tense racial
potential in major cities is a fertile field for subversive activities
both right and left. }

We have seen from the killings in the South, for example, 4
the killing of Medgar Evers, that such appear to be isolated incidents ~ *,
usually carried out by one man or a small unattached group occurring
on the spur-of-the-moment, such as the killing of the Lieutenant Colonel
near Colbert, Georgia, and the assaulting of a minister in = streets
in Hattiesburg, Mississippi. (REC- go" Jo Age

Memorandum to Mr. Belmont
RE: RACIAL MATTERS

Of course, any specific offenses such as, for example,
the case of the three missing civil rights workers in Philadelphia,
Mississippi, ‘or cases involving brutality, bombings or any other
violations these individual investigations should be handled by the
appropriate substantive desks such as the Civil Rights Desk.

The over-all racial field is specifically an intelligence operation
for the Bureau. It can best be organized when all facets are followed
and directed by one Division. The communist potential for activities
in this field would seem to be a major factor as evidenced by the doings
of Martin Luther King and his associates. The Bureau can best keep
abreast of the whole field by having all angles of the racial field united
in one Division utilizing the tactics which Mr. Sullivan has suggested
as being effective.

Memo for Mr. Tolson

Re: Personnel Transfers to Effect Proposed
Reassignment of Supervisory Responsibilities
in Racial Matters and Racial Informants

; SA F. H. Freund has responsibility for Klan organizations for all
field divisions and supervises other classifications for il western and
: ° midwestern offices. .

SAL. A. Giovanetti has alternate responsibility for Klan organizations
for all field divisions and supervises other classifications for Atlanta,
Little Rock, Savannah and 4 other midwestern offices. ,

SAC. A. Parkis-has responsibility for other hate organizations (8
currently active) for all field divisions and supervises other classifications
for Birmikgham, Mobile, Cleveland and the 4 Texas offices.

SA F. P. Smith supervises classifications (other than racial informants
and organizations) for New Orleans, Memphis, Knoxville and 7 western
offices, and special cases.

i SA H, E. Trent supervises classifications (other than racial informants
and organizations) for Charlotte, Savannah, Baltimore, Washington Field
office, Louisville and 2 midwestern offices.

1 ’ Based on the distribution of work, Inspector's. analysis reflects that it would

| | take 5 of the 7 men assigned to the Organizations nit to handle racial matters and

i racial informants under the approved change of responsibilities. There are 7 clerical
, | employees assigned to the Organizations Unit of the Civil Rights Section and it is

' | felt that 5 of these clerical employees who generally handie the work being transferred
from the General Investigative Division to the Done stic Intelligence Division be

|. | transferred along with the supervisors. Assistant Directors Rosen and Sullivan are

- | in accord that the proposed personnel changes are equitable, consistent and correspond
with the transfer of responsibilities.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1, That Supervisor in Charge Joseph C. Trainor and Agent Supervisors
Deegan, Freund, Giovanetti and Parkis be transferred to Division 5 (Domestic Intelligence!

Division) concomitant to the transfer to that Division ofsipervisory responsibility over
racial matters and racial informants (if approved to be handled by Mr. Mohr's Office).

Ii. The Domesti¢ Intelligence Division will assume the responsibility
for formulating and carrying out disruptive counterintelligence
programs against such organizations.

IV. The Domestic Intelligence Division, in addition’, is willing to go
beyond the recommendations approved by the-Director related to
the above and will, with Bureau approval, develop highly placed,
quality informants in certain legitimate organizations whose
activities generally relate to racial matters, such as

National Association for the Advancement of Colored
People (NAACP)

Congress of Racial Equality (CORE)
Student Nonviolence Coordinating Committee (SNCC)

Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) - headed
by Martin Luther King "

White Citizens Council

(Each one, of course, will be handled on a carefully selected
basis and the action approved individually by the Bureau. )

V. Similarly, the Domestic Intelligence Division is willing to go beyond
what was originally approved and will, with Bureau authorization,
proceed to establish informants and sources in Negro communities
throughout the Nation for the purpose of developing intelligence
information relating to the degree of racial tension; the possibility
of violence erupting intheform of riots, etc.; and will disseminate
this material to all interested persons inside and outside the Bureau.

The organizations and objectives as set forth in paragraphs IV and V
above are being made the subject of a separate memorandum inasmugh
as this involves a matter of policy and will have to be acted on
separately subject to approval by the Director.

" PURPOSE AND SCOPE

: The purpose of this study is to define

“a new role for the Bureau in the field of clandestine
collection of foroign intelligence in the U. S,.

This action is necessary and most timely because

_ of our Government's vital need for increased foreign
. intelligence and because of CIA's expanding interests
in the United States. There is a decided need for

@ hew Bureau concept, the implementation of which
could greatly increase our effectiveness and could deter
“CIA from becoming a threat to our operational interests, —

The study encompasses a review of history
_ aS it relates to foreign intelligence collection in
the U. S, Analysis is made of the need and the
potential for such intelligence; the capabilities of
. the Bureau and CIA in this field; and the responsibilities ©
of over-all (overt and covert) collection of foreign
intelligence in the U. S. We have submitted our general
findings, and we recommend a plan of action for a new
Bureau role,

This study was not designed to eliminate once
,and for all the many problems relating to collection

of foreign intelligence in the U. S. It would have been’
a Utopian objective to recommend a plan which would .
produce maximum intelligence collection, remove existing. -
defects within the U. 8, intelligence community, and
establish complete harmony among interested agencies, 5
We did not go that far, Careful and exhaustive analysis
dictated that we endeavor to reach a reasonable goal

_ consistent with prudent planning and sound operational

. implementation, We feel that the recommended plan

meets such guidelines, that it is a decidedly major step
forward for the Bureau, and it strongly conforms with
“the national security needs, :

Xt should be noted that this document does
--not.deal with our jaw enforcement or internal security |

functions, although it is fully recognized that . .
internal security and clandestine collection of foreign.
- {ntelligence are closely linked, Any plan on our part :

B. INTELLIGENCE TERMINOLOGY

People who do not speak and understand a common | - ~*

. language have difficulty in communicating their ideas, Even

in a country such as ours where English is the common language,’
words take on different meanings in different geographical
locales and in different social, political, and economic
environments, Likewise, in professional fields, varying
backgrounds and experiences have conveyed different meanings

to terms in the professional vocabulary.

In the field of security, intelligence, and counter=
‘.intelligence operations, certain professional terminology has
developed ostensibly to assist in the exchange of ideas by
persons in this field. However, as progress is made in a
field or a special segment of the field, new horizons develop
_ Which require additional terminology or cause an evolution in
- existing terminology, This development or evolution in security
and intelligence terminology, coupled with individualistic usage, F
brings further problems in meaning which we also face in the 7 ]
broader aspects of the English language. We have all noted ~ . ‘
. that our dictionaries do not always provide a single meaning .
and we must be careful in daily conversation that we are not
misunderstood when merely using a conversational vocabulary.
We face 4 similar problem in the use of professional terminole
-ogy in security and intelligence matters as this terminology °
takes on new meaning with additional experience and takes on :
-, varying meanings to different persons, . eae EEE

om

(OD

: An additional factor to consider in understanding

‘". thé meaning of terminology is the context in which a term is
used, For example, the term "intelligence" may be vague and
- confusing without the knowledge of the context in which it is
used, It can, as a generic term, pertain to the whole field
‘of activities undertaken by a governmentm the collection of
information, the protection of its institutions, and the con-
* duct of nonattributable activities to facilitate the formation
and implementation of government policy, Also, it can relate
to the organization devoted to the collection and production
of information necessary to the government, In addition, ~
it may pertain to the whole body of theory and practice on

- the-basis.of-which, an intelligence organization operates,
Finally, the word "intelligence" may be utilized to mean

oo any. part or all of the. above, .

a The following definitions do not “inelude all possible
“meanings that have been utilized but, ‘instead, are designed _
reader in digesting t study. 5

BASIC INTELLIGENCE. is that factual intelligence which results
from the collation of encyclopedia information of a fundamental
and more or less permanent nature and which, as a result of

evaluation and interpretation, is determined to be — best

BIOGRAPHIC INTELLIGENCE is intelligence concerning individuals,

. CLANDESTINE COLLECTION A coordinated complex of collection
activities designed to accomplish an intelligence, counter
‘intelligence, or other similar purpose, sponsored and conducted
by a governmental department or agency, or jointly by two or

COUNTERESPLONAGE is identifying, penetrating, manipulating
.or repressing inimical espionage organizations,

COUNTERINTELLIGENCE is defined as that intelligence activity,
“with its resultant product, which is devoted to destroying the
effectiveness of inimical foreign intelligence activities and

which is undértaken to protect the security of the nation,
_and its personnel, information, and installations against
“espionage, sabotage, and subversion, Counterintelligence
includes the process of procuring, developing, recording, and
disseminating information concerning hostile clandestine

of immediate interest which is usually disseminated without
the delays incident to complete evaluation or interpretation, -

DEPARTMENTAL INTELLIGENCE is that intelligence which any
department or agency requires to execute its .own mission, .

ECONOMIC INTELLIGENCE concerns the potentialities, utilization,
and vulnerabilities of a nation's natural and human resources.

“ RSPIONAGE is defined as that intelligence activity which is
directed toward the acquisition of information through clandestine
operations,

FOREIGN INTELLIGENCE pertains to foreign affairs and subject
matters pertinent to foreign countries, The word "foreign"

as used here denotes the target of the intelligence and is

’ distinct from the geographic location of the source providing

’ from target countries (such as the Soviet Union) have the
potential for supplying intelligence regarding their countries

to United States authorities, Although physically located in

the United States, they are potential foreign intelligence sources,

_ INTERNAL SECURITY relates to the defense and protection within

jos INVESTIGATION means systematic and direct inquiries or pro=

i cedures (such as physical or technical surveillances or neighbor=

There appears to be much confusion in professional
circles regarding the use of the term "positive intelligence,"
Some professionals use the term "positive intelligence" synonymously
with tho torm "foreign intelligence." Tn still anothor
usage, "positive intelligence" and "intelligence" are used

a interchangeably. In another useage, which is closely related
‘to the definition utilized in this study, "positive intelli-~

gence" is described os what is left of the entire field after
"security intelligence" has been subtracted, This source

* continues that both "positive intelligence" and "security

intelligence" can be against domestic targets, as well as
against foreign targets. For example, the Department of State,
in connection with its formulation of foreign policy, encounters

-a large number of organizations of Americans whose parents came
. from foreign countries. Many of these organizationse-the Poles

for example==-have strong views on what United States policy

: should be. toward Poland, The views of these organizations
regarding our foreign policy is likely to be a matter of some

importance to the Department of State in its policy formula~
tion. The knowledge of what these organizations think and

do can be a very significant phase of what might be called
“domestic positive intelligence," In addition, the connections
which these organizations may have with the foreign country
such as Poland sometimes provide a source of "foreign positive |

Cc, THE HISTORY OF FOREIGN INTELLIGENCE COLLECTION IN THE
NITED STATES

+1. | Prior to World War II

A study ef the history and progress of foreign

intelligence collection in the United States reveals that

‘ prior to World War II such collection efforts were incidental
and in direct proportion to the intensity of the coverage
maintained in the counterintelligence field, Accordingly,
the history of foreign intelligence collection in the

‘ United States prior to World War II is primarily a history of
counterintelligence and internal security coverage, of which ©
foreign intelligence was a by-product. Historical highlights

". of the developments in this field are as follows:

fe (a) In August, 1914, when German espionage agents
“*. Count Johann Von Bernstorff and Dr. Heinrich Albert of the
‘German Embassy, Washington, D. C., arrived in the
United Statcs with $150,000,090 in German treasury notes to
finance the first foreign espionage and sabotage apparatus
. to be organized in this country, United States Government
..' . 2 intelligence work was handled for the most part by five
i small organizations (Bureau of Investigation of the
Department of Justice, Secret Service, Army, State and Navy),
“ all operating on their own with small staffs and without
coordination and sufficient delineation of responsibilities.

(b) On April 6, 1917, Congress declared war against

Germany and President Woodrow Wilson gave the Bureau of :

Investigation the task of enforcing his proclamation :
governing the conduct of enemy aliens. The Bureau at the time

. had 300 Agents but shortly after the outbreak of the war

- the staff was increased to 400, ’

(c) As result of a rash of bombings believed
executed by Bolsheviks, Attorney General Palmer appointed
Prancis Pi“Garvan sof ‘New York as Assistant:..Attorney..General
to deal with the problem, He created a General Intelligenc
Division under command of J, Edgar Hoover and Mr. Hoover was
instructed to make a study of subversive activities in the
United States to determine their scope and the potential

for prosecution, : :

(ad) On May 9, 1934, President Roosevelt called

a White House conference attended by the Attorney General, ra
Secretary of Treasury, Secretary of Labor, Director of FBI
and Chief of United States Secret Service to deal with
the problem of growth of fascist organizations in the
United States, The conference agreed that there should be
an invostigation of these groups and their activities for
intelligence purposes, Since the only Federal law believed
applicable at the time was the Immigration Law, the President
decided that the Commissioner of Immigration and Naturalization
Service would confer with the Chief of Secret Service and the

7 Director of the FBI to work out details of the investigation...

Mr. Hoover immediately issued orders to FBI
personnel to conduct an intensive and confidential“ investi-
gation of the Nazi movement, This was the first general

eaened - intelligence investigation made by the Government into
Bavece fascist activities in this country,

: f
(e) As a result of President Franklin Roosevelt's
concera over eh ave uae of the communists and other subversive’, | ;
ences was held in the latter vart :

caveat of August and carly September, 1936, participated in by the
. President, the Secretary of State and the Director of the FBI.
As a result of his concern over the international character
: of communism and fascism, the President stated the FBI should
SeEEEREE conduct necessary investigations and coordinate information
upon matters in the possession of the Military
Lrevliisence Division, the Naval intelligence Division and
. the State Department,

It is noteworthy that it was specified the
‘investigation was to be for intelligence purposes only,

The Presidential Order was implemented by the
Director in a letter to all Special Agents in Charge,
September 5, 1936,

(f) As a résult of opposition primarily by the
State Department, against accepting the FBI as the coordinating
agency in the investigations of all subversive activities in
the United States, President Roosevelt, on June 26, 1939, issued
a confidential directive to Cabinet members which established an
Interdepartmental Intelligence Coordinating Committee composed
of the FBI and the Intelligence Divisions of the War Department
and the Navy, He named the FBI as the coordinating agency to
receive all reports on subversive activities,

(g) President Roosevelt publicly designated the FBI
to investigate matters relating to espionage, sabotage and
violations of the neutrality regulations by Presidential
Directive dated September 6, 1939.

(h) On May 21, 1940, President Roosevelt in a
memorandum to the then Attorney General, Robert H, Jackson,

_ authorized and directed the Attorney General in such cases as
he might approve to authorize the use of listening devices
directed to the conversations or other communications of
persons suspected of subversive activity against the Government
of the United States, including suspected spies.

Pursuant to such authorization, commencing on June 1,
- 1940, technical surveillances were installed on diplomatic
establishments throughout the United States of such countries
as Germany, Italy, Japan, Russia and France, These
. installations in addition to providing counterintelligence
information of value produced a substantial quantity of foreign
intelligence information.

: (i) Although lines of responsibility were established
7 for domestic intelligence work in connection with the September 6,
1939, Presidential Directive, there were no clearly defined areas
. of responsibility of overseas intelligence operations and as
time passed the need for decisions in that field grew more evident,

As a result, the Special Intelligence Service (SIS)
came into being. By Presidential Directive June 24, 1940,
President Franklin D, Roosevelt set forth lines of responsibility
in the operations of United States intelligence agencies in the
j o foreign field, This Directive grew out of a series of meetings

. «+ ‘involving representatives of State Department, Army and Navy

intelligence and the FBI wherein it was agreed that the SIS would
act aS a service agency, furnishing the State Department, the
military, the FBI and other governmental agencies with information
having to do with financial, economic, political and subversive
activities detrimental to the security of the United States, The
June 24th Directive’ placed the responsibility for nonmilitary
H - intelligence coverage in the Western Hemisphere on the FBI, Less
than thirty days thereafter the FBI had organized an SIS operation.

| oar Through World War II and until approximately March 31,
. 1947, the FBI continued its SIS operations, The culmination of
our activities in this field came about as a result of the
j January 22, 1946, Presidential Directive establishing the
mente Central Intelligence Group and giving it the responsibility of
collecting foreign intelligence abroad,

2, During World War IT (1941 = 1945)
a. The FBI's Role

During World War II, as prior to the war, foreign

i i intelligence collection in this country was geared to and
principally a product of our intensive efforts in the counter=
intelligence field, It is also significant to note that a
steady stream of foreign intelligence continued to be developed
from our technical coverage of diplomatic establishments of

. enemy~bloc countries, as well as other sensitive countries

a - such as Russia, Argentina, Portugal and Spain,

In line with the Presidential Directive of
September 6, 1939, the FBI continued to be’in charge of all
investigative work in matters pertaining to espionage, sabotage,
counterespionage, subversive activities and violations of the
. 7 neutrality laws.

On January 8, 1943, the President issued another
Directive in which he reiterated the previous Directive of
September 6, 1939,

In ordering the FBI to take charge in the foregoing
areas, President Roosevelt did not define the various types of
5 intelligence involved but placed the entire intelligence and
internal security responsibilities involved under the
-‘jurisdiction of the FBI. As a matter of fact, in carrying out
these responsibilities we did produce foreign intelligence in
_ substantial quantity especially through our technical coverage
_of foreign diplomatic establishments,

b. Office of Strategic Services &

The position of Colonel William J, Donovan as
my . Coordinator of Information (COI) was created by Presidential
t Directive dated July 11, 1941, On July 14, 1941, President
« Roosevelt, sent.a letter. .to. th: Attorney, General stating, the
position was created, in order to provide a céntYal “point’ it
“the Government for the analysis of information and data which,.:
bears upon national security, .. ." The President described
.. Donovan's duties as "assist me and” the various Departments and
“agencies of the Government in ‘assembling and: correlating °’, Preece
information which may be useful in the formulation of basic
plans for the defense of the nation."

yo ~ we dbe.

W"65360~ Docid32989629 Page 184

RS

In the lettex President Roosevelt clearly limited
* Donovan's jurisdiction with the following statement: "I
should like to emphasize that Colonel Donovan's work is not
_ intended to supersede or duplicate or involve any direction
-of the activities of established agencies already obtaining
and interpreting defense information."

The Presidential order dated September 11, 1941,

established the position of COI with clear cut authority to

- collect and analyze information bearing on national security;
correlate and make such information available to the President
and Other Government officials as the President may determine.
COI was finally authorized to carry out, when requested by
.the President, supplementary activities aS might facilitate
the securing ad information not then available to the
Government, .

Donovan, in a memorandum captioned "MEMORANDUM OF
" sESTABLISHMENT OF SERVICE OF STRATEGIC INFORMATION," expanded
on the President's directive in general terms. Under his

plan for procedure there was a Coordinator of Strategic
Information responsible directiy to the President. Gicte
this same organizational set up was later adopted by the
Director of Central Intelligence.) Donovan noted, however,
in his memorandum, "The proposed centralized unit will
neither displace nor encroach upon the FBI, Army and Navy
Intelligence, or any other Department of the Government."
(62-64427, serials 23 and X3.)

Our file on the Office of Strategic Services (OSS)
reveals that that organization continued its organizational,
training, and operational activities in this country based
on Donovan's premise that he was the central clearing point
for anti-Axis espionage and counterespionage. An interesting
’ insight into OSS operations in this country is provided in
the nonfiction work "The Scarlet Thread" by former OSS agent
Donald Downes. Downes noted that he was a former British
intelligence agent serving for that organization in New York
when he was recruited by OSS immediately after Pearl Harbor.
He tells of his recruitment by Allan Dulles, his association
with Donovan, and his work in the counterespionage field in
New York City and Washington, D. C., with other OSS agents,
including the current United States Ambassador to the
United Nations, Arthur Goldberg. Downes detailed attempts .
by him and other OSS agents to steal diplomatic codes from

Papnen, {sue suusessesauaaaaa



“friendly" or "neutral" country embassies in Washington in

the early 1940's and frequently referred to the fact that

this was being done by OSS with knowledge that its juris-
diction in this country was based only on the theory that

a foreign Embassy is not American soil and is technically ~
outside the jurisdiction of the FBI, which had full juris~
diction for counterintelligence in the western hemisphere,

Our file on the OSS is replete with incidents
indicating OSS recruitment and counterespionage activities
in this country during the early 1940's.

By memorandum dated May 22, 1945, Stanley J. Tracey,
advised of a conversation overheard between two high-ranking
' State Department officials. The conversation dealt with OSS
attempts to take over Bureau SIS operations in Latin America
. with one of the State Department officials, Aura Warren,
stating that officials of OSS felt that organization was
-~better equipped to handle work than FBI personnel attached
to various American Embassies in South America. In response
’ to this attempt of OSS to take over our duties, the Director
commented: “4 would like lo kuow where Warren gets this.
- According to-Ladd our contacts in State Department have no
J knowledge of such OSS efforts. Also Tracey should point
out it is State Department duty to initiate it as we would
service it' and the State Department in fact started the
SIS project. H" (62-64427-1059.)

An interesting evaluation of OSS operations is
provided in a report prepared by Colonel Richard Park of
the War Department as a result of a survey of OSS operations
made as a special and confidential mission for the President
in 1944 and 1945, Colonel Park commented: "Without going
into details I was everywhere left with the same impression
ri of utter incompetency on the part of OSS leadership....

"Everywhere that the subject of OSS.came up,
unsolicited remarks clearly brought out the very well known |
amateurish, nature_of the organization.

"The OSS has been restricted from active operations
in South America by Presidential Saree ear ieie

: SpLte the absence of any jurisdiction in or-
4 responsibility for counterintelligence operations in the.
western hemisphere, an ptficer of OSS was reported to have

| Feet ines = 13 =



attempted to obtain cover. for an OSS agent in South America
under guise of employment by an organization doing business
in South America,
A closing paragraph of Colonel Park's report
i commented on observations made by an official of OSS as
follows:

"This official of OSS added that it was the policy
| af of his agency not to give any more information than necessary
to the Federal Bureau of Investigation. He pointed out that
OSS instructors in their school in the United States had :
discussed the FBI in an unfavorable light and had painted

_ the picture of OSS replacing the Federal Bureau of
Investigation not only outside the United States but in
the domestic field. The publicity campaign referred to
was to be one of the means adopted” to ppreaiat ahaa this
purpose." .

3. National Intelligence Authority (NIA)

On January 22,.1946, President Harry S. Truman
addressed a Directive to the Secretary of State, the Secretary
of War, and the Secretary of the Navy stating, in part, "I
hereby designate you, together with another person to be named
by me as my personal representative, as the National Intelli-
gence Authority. .." The Directive provided that each of these
three Secretaries would from time to time assign personnel and
facilities from their respective departments "which persons
shall collectively form a Central Intelligence Group" (CIG)
under a Director of Central Intelligence. It was provided that
the latter would be responsible to the NIA.

President Truman then stated that subject to the

existing law the Director of Central Intelligence should

. (a) accomplish the corre’ation and evaluation of intelligence
~ and the appropriate dissemination within the Government of the 7
" results; (b) plan for the coordination of such activities of

the intelligence agencies of the three departments invoived as

ated to the national security: (c) perform such services of

: commen concern as the NIA determined could be more effectively
{ accomplished centrally; and (d) perform such other functions

: - and duties related to intelligence as the President and the
NIA might from time to time direct.

The Presidential Directive said that no police, law
enforcement or internal security functions should be exercised
under the Directive; that certain intelligence should be freely
available to the.Director of Central Intelligence "for correlation,
evaluation or dissemination't; and that "the existing intelligence
agencies of your departments shall continue to collect, evaluate, y
correlate and disseminate departmental intelligence." The ninth j
provision of the Directive stated, "Nothing herein shall be

| | construed to authorize the making of investigations inside the
continental limits of the United States and its possessions,
except as provided by law and Presidential directives."

A series of communications between the Bureau and
Lieutenant General Hoyt S. Vandenberg; who was designated as
Director of the Central Intelligence Group, then followed. On
dune 21, 1946, a memorandum analyzed a communication from
Vandenberg which submitted a proposed memorandum to the NIA and
a proposed Directive to be issued by NIA extending the powers
and duties of the Director of Central Intelligence. The Directive
provided, in essence, the following additional functions and
powers for the Director of Central Intelligence:

; : e

(1) Undertake such basic research and analysis of
‘intelligence and counterintelligence as may in his opinion be
required.

: (2) Act as the executive agent of this authority
. “QNTA) in coordinating and in supervising all Federal foreign
: intelligence activities,

| (3) Perform the following services of common concern:
(a) conduct all Federal espionage and counterespionage operations
for the collection of foreign intelligence; (b) conduct all
Federal monitoring of press and propaganda broadcasts of foreign
powers for the collection of intelligence information.

In discussing this Directive which Vandenberg desired
issued, the memorandum stated the Directive did not conform
with the original plan proposed by the President or which was
envisioned by the discussions occurring prior to the time the
President issued his Directive. The original plan, insofar as
the Bureau was advised, contemplated the setting up of solely
a coordinating agency which was given the power to perform certain
functions which it would be determined could more adequately and
economically be nerformed centrally for the benefit of all
: Government agencies. The memorandum noted that "undoubtedly if
QO this Directive is approved and the Central Intelligence Group
a . is successful in setting up complete foreign coverage, the
: Bureau would undoubtedly be pushed into a ‘second rate’ position
insofar as purely intelligence functions are concerned in the
domestic field. . . It is inevitable that the Central Intelli~
gence Group must enter into the domestic field picture insofar
. as intelligence is concerned because of the sources of foreign
intelligence existing in that field. Also, it is impossiblé To
separate entirely foreign intelligence and the domestic functions
performed by the Bureau."*

7 In reply to the Directive proposed by General Vandenberg,
a letter was sent to him June 25, 1946, which stated that the
Directive was approved with certain changes suggested "for
clarification purposes only." The Director suggested that to

memorandum, The Director's comments were set forth, This is~

as the executive agent of National Intelligence Authority
in coordinating and supervising all foreign intelligence
, activitios there should be added “performed outside the
United States and its possessions relating to the national
security in accordance with the overall policies and objectives
established by this Authority." With respect to the proposal
that the Director of Central Intelligence direct all espionage
"and counterespionage operations for the collection of foreign
“ antelligence, it was proposed that the phrase "outside the
United States and its possessions" also be inserted in this
provision.

On July 29, 1946, General Vandenberg ‘sent over
a memorandum on the subject “Exploitation of American
Business Concerns With Connections Abroad as Sources of
Foreign Intelligence Information." He added a proposed
Directive. The Director replied by letter August 6, 1946,
"I should like to comment that there appears to have been
an addition to the field encompassed by CIG Directive #11
. calling for a survey of the exploitation of American business
; concerns. I note that in your report and in the proposed
: NIA Directive, you refer not only to American business con=
ard cerns but to other private groups with connections abroad.
‘This latter phrase, in my opinion, is extremely broad and
could be taken to include all types of organizations,
including Foreign Nationality Groups. In fact, I feel that -
the report and proposed Directive should confine themselves to
the discussion of American business concerns and that no
xveferences at all should be made to 'private groups'. ..
-I feel that at a later date the question of exploitation of
these private groups by CIG representatives might be worked
’ out by discussing them individually with the FBI when their
' identities are determined." This matter remained unresolved. ~

On August 22, 1946, General Vandenberg submitted
another proposed Directive concerning exploitation of American
business concérns, nongovernmental groups, and individuals (in
the United States) with connections abroad as sources of foreign
H intelligence information. A memorandum analyzing this on
*. August 22, 1946, pointed out the new Directive was even more

| ~MAFG5360—Docld:32989629" Page 189°



obnoxious than the one originally proposed. The Directive
noted, in part, "CIG field representatives will establish
and maintain liaison with the intelligence officers of local
Army and Navy headquarters and Air Forco headquarters, if
present, through the medium of local interagency offices."
The analyzing memorandum ~ointed out, "If this, means the
a CIG is going to maintain field representatives in the United
H States or establish offices, it certainly is something new and
a@ provision that we did not understand was intended in the
President's Directive. . . Attached to the proposed Directive
is'a discussion which is more or less the same as was attached
‘ to the original.proposed Directive. It, however, makes the
following statement which the Bureau cannot subscribe to and
it would seem must oppose, that is, ‘Foreign Intelligence
information related to the national security, although it may
be collected from sources whose headquarters are within the
limits of the United States.and its possessions, is definitely
a part of the national intelligence mission, the coordination
of which is specifically a function of the National intelli~
gence Authority under the provisions of the President *s letter
of 22 January 1946.'"

In pointing out the Bureau's objections, the
analyzing memorandum of August 22, 1946, stated, "There
is now involved in this Directiv: the fundamental question
- of just what rights the Central Intelligence Group has with
reference to operations within the United States. Carrying
to a logical conclusion the statements set forth above contained
in the discussion, they could cover ail foreign embassies in
“,. the United States, take charge of double agents we are operating
or radio stations we are operating as double agent set-ups, etc.,
because essentially these operations engaged in by the Bureau
do not directly involve enforcement of the laws but rather are
concerned with obtaining information in the nature of foreign
intelligence which, of course, is related to internal security
as is all foreign intelligence. Essentially, the Bureau's
domestic operations in intelligence involve the determining
. of the aims, intentions, and activities of foreign countries
10k. their. representatives." :

abroad, On August 23, 1946, the Director sent a letter to
Genoral Vandenberg stating in part, "I must advise that tha
proposed Directive does not incorporate the changes suggested
| : in my letter of August 6, 1946, and 1, therefore, cannot

| approve it, This new directive also includes provisions

| and statements in which I cannot concur and, in fact, must

| oppose .",

| The strong stand of the Director obviously led to

i *.'’ a corference between General Vandenberg and the Director

“which was, reported in a memorandum of September 13, 1946,
which the Director prepared. As stated in the Director's

| memorandum the conference concerned CIG's desire to gather

! - contacts among "nongovernmental groups and individuals with

ie : connections abroad," The entire conference was on this subject

“" matter and did not enter into collection of foreign intelli-

“ gence from foreign embassies or from foreign officials or,

in fact, from any other source, The Director wrote, "I told

: the General that I could well appreciate that there would be

! 5 cases in which his organisuiion would be desirous of making

7 ‘contacts in the United States for the purpose of obtaining
information from abroad :nd that the Bureau was not interested
in such contacts except in those situations wherein the individual
or the group might be engaged in activities within the United
States that were either under investigation by the Bureau or
might possibly be the medium of obtaining information con=

‘cerning the activities of a subversive character being carried

: ‘on within the United States. I told the General that I would

; be perfectly agreeable to his suggestion, with the added

_ provision that if CIG was desirous of contacting any

_ individuals of the character that he had indicated, before

doing so it would et with the FBI."

cigs The foregoing has been set forth rather extensively
cere since it shows the strong stand the Bureau took against CIG's
operating in-the United States. Actually, as will be reported
ereinaiter,. Directives. were adopted permitting CIG to ppaeratine
positive intelligence in this’ count#y by “contacting Unite

4, Responsibilities of CIA
a, The National Security Act of 1947

‘

This Act, which is reported in 50 USC 401 et seq.,
established the National Security Council (NSC) and under it
tho Contral Intolligence Agency, It provided that whon the
Director of Central Intelligence was appointed the NIA should |
cease to exist.

There was much discussion concerning the powers and
authorities to be vested in the Director of Central Intelli-~
gence. Many individuals, especially in Congress, expressed

' fears that CIA could develop into a gestapo if permitted to
become operational in the United States. The following two
excerpts, of interest in this connection, are from a
Congressional publication related to hearings prior to passage

- of the National Security Act of 1947. The publication is

‘» entitled "Hearings Before the Committee on Expenditures in the
. Executive Departments, House of Representatives, 80th Congress,
“lst Session on H. R. 2319 (National Security Act of 1947)";

Page 127 ~ During testimony concerning authority for
‘and scope of CIA, James Forrestal, then Secretary of the Navy,
stated: :

"The purposesof the Central Intelligence Authority
are limited definitely to purposes outside of this
country, except the collation of information gathered
by other government agencies.

_. “Regarding domestic operations, the Federal Bureau
of Investigation is working at all times in collaboration

_ with General Vandenberg. He relies upon them for domestic

activities."

Page 438 ~ Congressman Clarence J. _Brown of Ohio in
speaking about the National Security Act of 1947, which was
. under scrutiny before passage, stated: -

"I want to write a lot of other Pea into ‘the
section that deals with. the Central Intelligence Agency.

"I want to make certain that the activities and the -
functions of the Central Intelligence Agency were care=
fully confined to international matters, to military
matters, and to matters of national security. We have
enough people now running around butting into overybody
else's business in this country without establishing
another agency to do so..

"What we ought to do ig to eliminate 90 percent of
the present snoopers instead of adding to them.

"I do not think it would be the Central Intelligence
Agency's right, authority, or responsibility to check on
the ordinary domestic activities of the average American
citizen, and yet they could have the power and authority
to do it under this bill as written."

"The National Security Act of 1947 was approved

7/26/47, It provided that for the purpose of coordinating the
intelligence activities of the several Government departments
and agencies in:the interest of national security, the, Agency”
under the direction of the NSC was;

(1) To advise NSC in matters concerning’ “such

There’ is tacit acknowledgement in Section 403 (e)
of the National Security Act of 1947 that the FBI gathers

provides; : : : - ;

{e) To ‘the extent recommended by the NSC and approved
by the President, such intelligence of the departments and
agencies of the Government, except as hereinafter provided,
relating to the national security shall be open to the

such intelligence as relates to the national security and
is possessed by such departments and other agencies of

however, That upon the written request of the Director
Of Central Intelligence, the Director of the FBI shall
make.available te the Director of Central Intelligence
such information for correlation, evaluation, and
dissemination as may be essential to the national security.

To implement the authority granted to it undes tie
National Security Act of 1947, the National Security Council
has issued a series of "National Security Council Intelligence
Directives," usually referred to as NSCID's and commonly called
‘Nonscids." The first of these was issued December 12, 1947, and

Committee to maintain the relationship necessary for a fully

Directive dated September 15, 1958, the U. S. Intelligence Board
(USIB) was formally created as successor to the Intelligence Advisory
Committee and a counterpart known as the U. S. Communications |
Intelligence Board.

NSCID No. 1 provided that the Director of Central
Intelligence should coordinate the foreign.intelligence activities
of the United States, such coordination to include both special
and other forms of intelligence. The USIB under this Directive
shall "advise and assist the Director of Central Intelligence as

bilities." It is the Board which is empowered to establish
policies, define intelligence objectives, make recommendations
to appropriate U. S. officials, develop standards for protection
of intelligence,.and formulate policies with respect to arrange-
ments with foreign governments. The Director of Central

Intelligence is designated as Chairman of this Bdard and in -
this capacity is distinguished from the Director ‘of the
Central Intelligence Agency. A more complete discussion with
regard to the Bureau's role in this over-all setup is set forth
| = heroinafter undor tho caption "FBI Rolations With the

United States Intelligence Board."

. National Security Council Intelligence Directive
No. 1, originally issued 12/12/47, defines the various types |
of intelligence in Section 4.

: (a) National Intelligence is that intelligence
| " ; .- +. which is required for-the formulation of national security
Apes "+ policy, concerns more than one department or agency,
. "and transcends the exclusive competence of a single
department or agency. The Director of Central Intelli-
- + J, gence'shall produce* national intelligence with the

Eee (b) Departmental Intelligence is that intelligence

““which any department or agency requires to execute its own
mission, aEmSen

on (c) Interdepartmental Intelligence is integrated
departmental intelligence which is required by departments
and agencies of the Government for the execution of their

i : : missions, but which transcends the exclusive competence

tt of a single department or agency to produce. The

subcommittee structure of the U. S, Intelligence Board

may be utilized for the production and dissemination of

interdepartmental intelligence.

Director of Central Intelligence is then authorized
to disseminate national intelligence and interdepartmental
fl intelligence provided it is done consistent with statutes and
| * Presidential policy, and provided further "that any disclosure
: of FBI intelligence information shall be cleared with that
_ agency prior to dissemination."

\ : NSCID No. 2 insued 1/13/48, relates to coordination
: of foreign intelligence collection activities "not covered
by other NSC Directives."
The Director of Central Intelligence has responsi-
bility for planning to assure there is no undesirable
duplication and that coverage is adequate.

Responsibilities are then assigned as follows:

(1) The Department of State shall have primary
responsibility for, and shall perform as a service of
common concern, the collection abroad (i.e., outside
the U.S. and its possessions) of political, sociological,
economic, scientific and technical information.

(2) The Department of Defense shall have primary
‘responsibility for, and shall perform as a service of
: ca] common concern, the collection of military intelligence
oe - information, Owing to the importance of scientific and
. technical intelligence to the Department of Defense
_and the military services, this collection responsibility

chn as well s¢ economic,

shall include scientific and technical,

oa . information directly pertinent to Department of Defense

Leaey + missions. (It seems significant that while State Depart-
i if ment primary responsibility was limited by the phrase
"the collection abroad,'t there was no such limitation

‘on the. Department of Defense in its responsibility.)

(3) The Central Intelligence Agency may collect

abroad intelligence information in support of assigned funce~
tions or as a byproduct of assigned functions: Provided,

that this collection involves no undesirable duplication

of any of the specific assignments to State and Defense 7
Departments, and Provided, that any such overt collection i
. is coordinated with the Department of State or with the

. Senior U. S. Representative. _

intelligence information, in accordance with policies,
procedures and practices established as provided in
paragraph 3a of NSCID No. 1, by the Director of Central
Intelligence with the concurrences of the U. S. Intelli-
gence Board."

Section 9 of the same Directive provides that CIA
“shall conduct the exploitation of foreign language publications
for intelligence purposes, as appropriate, as a service of
common concern, When this function is carried out in the U. S.,
this also constitutes overt collection of foreign intelligence
by that Agency in this country. ;

It may be worthy to note at this point that NSCID
No.'s 1 and 2 were discussed, approved, and issued in their
original forms prior to 7/7/49 when the FBI was designated a
member of the Intelligence Advisory Committee.

NSCID No. 3 on Coordination of Intelligence Production
contains definitions of various types of intelligence (including
those defined in NSCID No. 1) and then delineates primary
responsibilities for “producing™ intelligence among various
agencies, (Stating with respect to CIA:

"The Central Intelligence Agency shall produce
economic intelligence on the Sino-Soviet Bloc and /
scientific and technical intelligence as a service of
common concern. Further, the Central Intelligence
Agency may produce such other intelligence as may be
necessary to discharge the statutory responsibilities
of the Director of Central Intelligence."

Since, as noted hereinbefore, "collection" activities

are defined in NSCID No. 2; it would seem to follow that the

‘word "produce" as used in NSCID No. 3 has the same definition

as set out in a footnote to NSCID No. 1, paragraph 4, i.e., "to

correlate and evaluate intelligence. relating to the national
~gecurity." Thus, NSCID No. 3 would not appear to extend CIA's

jurisdiction to collect intelligence or be operational in any way.

the subject matter of foreign intelligence collection in the

ce, Director of Central Intelligence Directives

To implement the National Security Act of 1947 as
amended and the various National Security Council Intelligence
Directives issued pursuant thereto, the Director of Central
Intelligence has issued uumerous Directives (DCID's), The
first of these having a direct bearing on jurisdictional matters
is DCID No. 2/3, captioned "Domestic Exploitation of :
Nongovernmental Organizations and Individuals." NSCID No. 2,
paragraph 7, states that CIA shall be responsible for the
selective exploitation within the U., S, of such organizations
and individuals as sources ot foreign intelligence information,
We, therefore, have avoided, and should avoid, any operations
among nongovernmental organizations and individuals designed
solely to produce foreign intelligence without CIA prior
approval or nullification of these provisions,

DCID No. 2/3 provides for exploitation of nongovernmental
U. S. citizens by CIA domestic field offices and states, "In
cases where the Federal Bureau of Investigation has indicated an
operational interest in a U. S. citizen, Central Intelligence
Agency will coordinate with that agency prior to further contact.”

This DCID also provides for exploitation by CIA
domestic field offices of aliens, following a prior name check

- . with FBI so our statutory obligations may be properly met without

CIA interference.
: It is of possible interest to note that in dealing with
these two matters, DCID No. 2/3 refers to nongovernmental U, 5S.
citizens but only to aliens (without the restrictive adjective).
The NSCID on which it-is based refers to nongrovernmental
individuals without distinguishing between citizens and aliens.
Thus, there appears to have been an.intention to confine CIA's
intelligence exploitation functions within the U. S, A review
of our file on CIA (62~80750) indicates this might well have

been a concession to the Bureau since we went on record opposing
delegation of any intelligence collection functions within the

U. S. to CIA ia letters to Lieutenant General Hoyt S, Vandenberg

. (then Director of Central Intelligence Group) on June 25, 1946,

(Serial 96), August 6, 1946, (Serial 138), and August 23, 1946,
(Serial 222), which have been.discussed more fully under the
heading “National Intelligence Authority."

“= 26



DCID No, 2/8 is captioned "Domestic Exploitation of

U. S, Government Organizations and Officials," It begins in
very general terms, "Pursuant to the provisions of NSCID No. 1
and NSCID No. 2... ." It provides, "The Central Intelligence

Agency shall coordinate and have the primary responsibility for

‘exploitation of the foreign intelligence potential of non~USIB

organizations and officials to meet community needs as a
service of common concern,”

As set forth above, there seems to be no basis for
such CIA jurisdiction in NSCID No. 1 and No, 2, Paragraph 7
of NSCID No. 2 specifically restricts CIA in this area of

operations to nongovernmental organizations and individuals.

A’xreview of our U. S. Intelligence Board (usiB) file,

: 62-80718 , _ Shows following apropos’ this matter:

The Draft Minutes of the 3/21/61 USIB

meeting report that the Board approved the
> draft of a DCID on "Domestic Exploitation of

U. S. Government Organizations and Officials,"
which wouid pe issued as DCID No. 2/8, eifective
3/21/61. Mx. Belmont was present at this USIB
meeting as the FBI representative. (unnumbered
serial between serials 1131'& 1132, USIB file)

Tracing this subject matter back through
the USIB file it was learned that it apparently
was first considered at the meeting held 2/23/60
at which the Bureau was represented by Fred A.
Frohbose. The minutes for that meeting reported
- the Board agreed in principle that a directive on /
Intelligence Exploitation of U. S. Governmental
officials would be desirable. However, the
matter was referred to the Committee on Domestic
Exploitation for further study and the submission
of a revised draft for Board consideration,
(unnumbered serial between serials aii & 1041,
“USIB file) :

From the foregoing it would appear that the Bureau

concurred in the issuance of this particular Directive and thus

to an extension of CIA's overt collection activities in the
U. S, if: this should, in fact, be interpreted as an extension,

perp af. provides for: “the establishment of the
“Interagency eeecheneteceel i ccceeeeetctceeet 5



xesponsibility over foreign intelligence exploitation until there

‘ other departments and agencies concerned with defector matters,
except those responsibilities assigned exclusively to FBI... »%*

DCID's 4/2 and 4/3 relate to the Defector Program
abroad and domestically, respectively. The latter one dwells on
division of responsibilities between FBI and CIA in the handling
of defectors within the continental limits of the United Statos,
It provides that exploitation of'such defectors shall be conducted:

1. To obtain internal security information or other
data required by FBI in view of its statutory responsibilities
in the internal security field, .

2, To obtain foreign intelligence information required
in the interests of national security by the member agencies of
the USIB. :

3, For such other purposes as are deemed to be in the

interests of national security.

“The very next sentence then gives the implication that
exploitation of the defector for foreign intelligence purposes is

« the principal responsibility of CIA, for it reads, “Decision as

to the relative importance of internal security exploitation by

FBI and foreign intelligence exploitation by the Central

inte.iigence Ayeucy (OTA) shall be made jointly by revresentatives of
CIA and FBI." -

There then follows a listing of nine specific FBI
responsibilities, one of which is to make available to CIA foreign
intelligence information resulting from the initial exploitation
of defectors, There is no subsequent specific delineation of CIA

is a transfer of respons_bility for handling a defector from FBI

to CIA after FBI interests have been fully satisfied. There is a
general assignment of such responsibility to CIA in the terms,

“CIA shall be responsible for: a. Coordinating the activities of.

‘ As a matter of practice, if it is determined there is
azittle or no importance from an internal security standpoint in
connection with a particular defection, we do not take over but in
effect give clearance to CIA to proceed from a foreign intelli-~
gence standpoint.

: DCID's in the 5/ series (numbers one through five) were
issued principally to implement NSCID Number 5 which deals with
U. S. espionage and clandestine counterintelligence activities
abroad, There appears to be no conflict with FBI jurisdiction in
this series. : ve

All other DCID's relate to Elint Critical Intelligence
and other matters. which appear to have no' bearing on possible
conflicts between CIA and FBI responsibilities,

ieee “a. Dulles Committee, 1949 i

i The Dulles Committee was appainted February 3, 1948,

‘ by the National Security Council (NSC) to make a "comprohensiva,
impartial and objective survey of the. organization, activities
and personnel of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA)." The
Committee was instructed to report its findings and recommendations
on the following matters:

(a) The adequacy and effectiveness of the
organization structure of CIA,

(b) The value and efficiency of existing CIA Teh

: (c) The relationship of these activities to those of
other departments and agencies.

(a), The utilization and qualifications of CIA personnel.

7 The Committee's scope was extended on March 17, 1948,

- to include the following provisions: "This survey will comprise
peimavily a thorough and comprehensive examination of the
structure, administration, activities and inter-agency relatione

“.+ ships of the CIA as outlined in the resolution of the National

set Security Council. It will also include an examination of such

intelligence activities of other Government departments and
agencies as relate to the national security, in order to make
recommendations for their effective operation and overall
coordination. . ." : : |

This report, which is dated January 1, 1949, for the q
most part concerned itself with administrative matters affecting ,
CIA and the necessity for reorganization within that Agency. It
notes, however, that the National Security Act, as implemented
sby directives of the NSC, imposed upon CIA responsibility for
. Seteiat nee out three essential functions: :

“a The coordination of intelligence activities.

- (2) The correlation and evaluation of intelligence
* - ypelating to the national security, which has been interpreted
by directive as meaning the production* of national intelligence.

Pe es

4b as “correlate and evaluate," _the reverse of connotation ‘given
_ here. +: : a :

\_biv.65360 Doeld:32989623-Page-204



(3) The performance centrally, subject to NSC
direction, of certain intelligence and related functions of
common concern to various departments of the Government,

The report noted that Section 102 of the National
Security Act of 1947 established a framework for a sound

intelligence system and no amendment to that Section of the
Act was deemed. necessary.

Although the coordination of intelligence activities
of the several departments and agencies concerned with national
. Security was a primary reason for establishing CIA, the report
noted the National Security Act does not give CIA independent
. authority to coordinate intelligence activities, as final
.. vesponsibility to establish policies was vested in the NSC.

“The statutory limitations upon the authority of CIA

to coordinate intelligen-e activities without the approval of
‘ the NSC were, according to the report, obviously designed to
protect the autonomy and internal arrangements of the various
* departments and agencies performing intelligence functions.

In spite of these calculated Llimitaiious om the authority of
CIA, the report noted, it was clear the Agency was expected to
provide the initiative and leadership in developing 2 coordinated
intelligence system, In practice, the NSC has almost without
exception approved the recommendations submitted to it by CIA
‘for the coordination of intelligence activities.

“i The National Security Act does not define the
‘. “intelligence activities" which were to be coordinated by CIA
_ under the direction of the NSC or specify the departments
: whose activities were covered. Presumably, according to the
a report, all intelligence activities relating to the national
security were included, from collecting information in the first
. instance to, the preparation and dissemination of finished
. intelligence reports and estimates, . "The criterion," which the
-. report noted was a very broad one, was "such intelligence
activities. ... as relate to the national security and not
the identity of the.departments concerned or the nature or
locale of the intelligence activity.'' Thus, the report noted,
’ practically no limitations are set.upon the scope of the intelli-
gence activities with which the Central Intelligence Agency is) ~~
to concern itself. . - . : . ae oaaaea

¢



e

The report noted another broad field requiring
coordination is that of foreign intelligence derived from
domestic sources and the allied field of domestic counter-
intelligence, This includes the oxploitation of intolligonce
from United States business firms, travellers, etc., exploitation
of the intelligence possibilities of groups and individuals of
foreign nationality in the United States, the rolating of
domestic counterintelligence to foreign intelligence and the
coordination of domestic counterespionage with counterespionage
abroad. Except for the exploitation of private sources of
foreign intelligence in the United States which is centralized
in the Office of Operations, CIA, responsibility for: other
activities is scattered among the State ‘Department, the armed
services, the FBI and CIA.

: _ The FBI, which has primary security and law enforce~
ment responsibilities, is concerned in fact with an important
‘ avea of intelligence. This includes domestic counterespionage
‘and countersabotage, control of communist and other subversive
activities and surveillances of alien individuals and groups.
All of these functions, according to the report, are closely
relaied to the comparable activitics abroad of the CIA.
7 The report noted the FBI was not. part of the then
\ existing machinery for courdination of intelligence through
‘\the Intelligence Advisory Committee and there was no continuing
_ manner whereby domestic intelligence and counterintelligence
were related to overall national intelligence in order to serve
‘the general purpose set forth in the National Security Act,
. which was set forth as "of coordinating the intelligence activities
“of the several Government departments and agencies in the interest
of national security."

It was the opinion of the authors of the Dulles Report’
that CIA had the duty under the Act to concern itself with the
problem of coordinating those phases of domestic intelligence
and counterintelligence which relate to the national security -
and CIA should submit recommendations on this. subject to the
-NSC. The report noted this was not inconsistent with the |
stipulation of the National Security Act that CIA "shall have no

police, subpoena, law bebaetuahpacnatiks powers or internal security
pee race ed



@

The Dulles Commission recommended that the FBI
should be made a member of the Intelligence Advisory Committee
to improve coordination of domestic intelligence and countar~
intelligence ingofar as these matters related to the national
security.

While discussing the production of National
Intelligence Estimates by CIA, the report noted, "There is
no systematic way of tapping that domestic intelligence
information, which should be chiefly in the hands of the FBI,
having a bearing on broader intelligence issues: and there
is no regular and agreed arrangement for participation by the
FBI and for the use of intelligence from domestic sources in
a national estimate."

National Security Council Intelligence Directive
| Number 7 provided that CIA shall be responsible for the
, exploitation, on a highly selective basis, within the United
“ States of business concerns, other non-Governmental organizations
and individuals as sources of foreign intelligence information.
The report concluded the amount of foreign intelligence which
can be obtained through the exploitation of non~Guvernicntal
“sources in the United States is considerable and its quality
could be very high if appropriate arrangements were made and
discrimination was employed, it was felt the vast number of
organizations, institutions and individuals having foreign
interests and knowledge represented a potential source of
intelligence that in many ways was superior to any other,
. ‘as it was felt that they were in a position to provide
. information obtained from their foreign contacts and from the
findings on their own people abroad. ..

: A further important source of information, the
- exploitation for intelligence purposes of foreign individuals
- and groups in the United States was also being developed.: The
report noted that these individuals and groups as well as
“political refugees and former foreign government officials
«were often engaged in political See with iris erent
international implications. a

CIA and other ees agencies had not developed
- eoordinated.and effective’ policies and procedures for the 1. .°”,
exploitation of intellijence in this important field, The FBI,

. aecording.to ‘the report, had, a..majo: in, foreign

a ee



; e

“individuals and groups in the United States because of

possible security implications. The report indicated the

FBI possessed considerable information concerning many a
individuals and groups but this information had been obtained
primarily with security rsther than intelligence considerations”
in mind and was not normally given the kind of interpretation
or dissemination that intelligence required if it was to be
properly used, It was also noted the FBI was, in cases where

it had a security interest, reluctant on security grounds to
have intelligence exploitation by outside agencies. The general
result of this situation, according to the report, was that an

_important source of intelligence was not being fully exploited.

The report noted that the question of the
exploitation for intelligence purposes of foreign groups and
individuals in the United States was a clear examplo where
the Intelligence Advisorr Committee, with the FBI being added
as a member, should establish principles and rules for
coordination,

In Giscussing the administrative handling of
espionage and counterespionage matters within the CIA, the
report noted the FBI was charged with all counterespionage
responsibilities in the United States except those affecting

. personnel of the armed services. The Dulles Commission

recommended the counterespionage activities of CIA should be
increased in scope and emphasis and that closer liaison in

. this field should be established with the FBI.

The only effect the Dulles Report had on the FBI
was its inclusion as a member of the Intelligence Advisory
Committee by amendment to HSCID Number 1 dated July 7, 1949.

-"e, Hoover Commission, 1948 and 1955

fask forces of the Commission on Organization of the
Executive Branch of the Government (Hoover Commission)
-. conducted surveys of CIA operations from 1947 to 1949 {under F,
‘Eberstadt) and from ‘1953 to 1955 (under General Mark Clark).



,

The Commission concerned itself principally with
the efficiency with which CIA was fulfilling its statutory.
missions of coordination, correlation, evaluation, and
dissemination of the esieiaters Sete product of other Government
agencies and departments The Commission examined agency
activity in light of the’ CIA primary mission of advising
NSC and performing services and duties related to
intelligence and national security as the NSC directed,

(la) Eberstadt Task Force Report

The results ot the first examination of CIA by the
Hoover Commission were more or less apologetic in tone,
emphasizing the soundness of directives setting up NSC and its
direction of the Agency. The report pointed out, however,
that CIA and its parent, NSC, had had little time to actually
implement the coordination necessary for leadership in the
field, .The Task Force clearly defined its understanding of
-the CIA mission as; ".....,coordinate intelligence activities
of Federal agencies concerned with national security,”

The duties of CIA were listed as:

1, Advise National Security Council on national
security intelligence activities of Federal departments and
agencies,

2. Recommend necessary coordination of such
‘aetivities to: ‘National Security Council.

q 3. Correlate, evaluate and disseminate ‘national
i security intelligence,

4, Render intelligence services for other Federal
‘departments and agencies." (62-88575~3 enclosure behind file.)

In discussing the duties of the CIA the Task Force
noted, “Under the statute CIA is entrusted with the performance
of such,services of’ common concern as the National Security

: Council shall determine, At present these include, apart from
Scientific Intelligence, which is discussed separately: (a) - :
maintenance of central indexes of report, records, and documents
having intelligence value; (b) examination of foreign documents
from which intelligence material is extracted and disseminated;
(c) maintenance of central map facilities; (ad) monitoring of
foreign broadcasts; and (e) collection of the. information \ by
clandestine means and counterespionage abroad,"

In evaluating the operations and location of CIA
counterespionage the Task Force commented as follows:

. "The counterespionage activities of CIA abroad appear
properly integrated with CIA's other clandestine operations.
Although arguments have been made in favor of extending CIAts
authority to include responsibility for counterespionage in this
Country, such an extension of jurisdiction does not a present
appear justified. For one thing,-.concentration of power over
counterespionage activities at home in the hands of a Director
of Central Intelligence responsible for espionage abroad might
justifiably arouse public suspicion and opposition, Conceivably
it could form the basis for a charge that a gestapo is in '.
process of creating even though the power to arrest were
specifically withheld, To transfer responsibility for domestic
counterespionage from the FBI, which has an established
organization and long tradition, to CIA, which is not equipped
for the assignment, would probably create more problems than it

Hl “., would solve, It is doubtful whether the logical benefit of

: . having one agency responsible for counterespionage throughout

H the world would justify the dislocation and confusion that such

Hi a@ transfer would inevitably occasion."

tte aa "CIA representatives have indicated that their present

working liaison with FBI is satisfactory, but the Committee
doubts that FBI-~CIA relationships are completely adequate, The
Director of FBI declined the Committee's invitation to appear
before it to discuss the CIA with the committee or its

_ representatives on the ground that he knew too little of its
activities,"

. The groundwork for CIA acceptance was laid by the

: Committee recommendation and finding: "CIA is not now properly
h organized, Co-equal improvement in G-2, FBI, ONI, State
| Department, and other Government intelligence services is also
essential, Spirit of teamwork must govern interagency
intelligence relationships. CIA deserves and must have greater
degree of acceptance aud support from old-line intelligence
+. Services than it has had in the ae ie 7

A pitch was made for a single agency controlling
~ internal security in the Committee's finding; "The committee
believes that responsibility for ‘internal: security “policies: -..+:..-
should be immediately focused in one agency. A more thorough
study of the subject than any. yet made must be. prosecuted, -and |
interagency frictions must-be ended." It is noted that the Tet -
" committee commented elsewhere in its report; f

"Detailed study of organization and activities of
intelligence divisions of the Government, including CIA, is
being made by a committee consisting of Messrs. Allen Dulles,
William H. Jackson, and Mathias Correa, assisted by a staff
of four directed by Mr. Robert Blum of the Office of
Secretary of Defense." With this statement it may be assumed
the Task Force excused omissions it may have made with the

observation that the Dulles group was conducting almost the
same survey carried on in the Hoover Commission ‘80 far as

.CIA was involved.

(ib) Clark Task Force Report oo lee

The Task Force headed by. General Mark Clark
submitted a Top Secret report dated in May, 1955, setting
forth results of the second Hoover Commission survey of the
organization of CIA. The report pointed out the survey
was of departments and agencies with entire or prime
responsibility in the field of positive foreign intelligence
as it pertains to national defense and security. It
qualified this survey when speaking of the FBI, noting
survey was limited to survey of Bureau only to the extent

. that it dealt in security intelligence.

Again the Hoover Commission through its Task
Force pinned CIA jurisdiction down to the areas defined by statute,
and emphasized the Agency was subordinate only to the National

.. Security Council in its coordination, correlation, dissemination
‘and: collection of intelligence data. The Task Force noted

that since CIA is charged with the over~all responsibility
for coordinating the output of all intelligence forces, the
Task Force was giving special attention to the work of that

Agency.

In the Task Force Report a review of the FBI
functions in the intelligence community was set forth. The

- committee noted that the FBI had only limited activities in the

positive intelligence field but noted additionally that FBI
functions in the current intelligence effort were of interest
a ierbaneia to Halli out the intelligence’ picture.



The FBI was cited as one of the four members of
the Interdepartmental Intelligence Conference (IIC), created
by the -NSC, approved by the President 3/23/49, to coordinate
"the investigation of all domestic espionage, counterospionage,
sabotage, subversion, and other related matters affecting
internal security." ‘

It was noted that the JIC charter did not disturb
responsibilities of its member agencies but made mandatory
action by those agencies deemed necessary to insure complete
investigative coverage in compliance with the needs of the
IIC, which had full responsibility for coordination of the-
investigation of all domestic espionage, counterespionage,
et cetera, affecting internal security.

The Committee stated, "The Central Intelligence
Agency is, by law, excluded from duplicating the internal
security functions of the FBI. However, the CIA does develop
~» within and without the U. S., sources for foreign (positive)
intelligence, and incidental thereto may develop leads as to
subversive activities within this country. In such cases
. Ci&é thwough liaison givec its information to the FBI."

zs 7 A Task Force survey revealed, "Through the Central
: Intelligence Agency's duwestic field offices, contacts are
made on a highly selective basis with business concerns and
-other nongovernmental agencies, as well as with previously
. ¢leared individuals who travel abroad . .. Under the
-provisions of DCID 7/1, each member of the Intelligence
Advisory Committee is required to establish in Washington
- a focal office for the purpose of interviewing nongoverament
visitors. . . Any visitors to these offices demonstrating
good intelligence potential are referred to the CIA for further
. exploitation."

7 The Task Force noted that as far back as 1939
President Roosevelt by executive order directed the FBI.to
coordinate and conduct domestic counterintelligence activities.
In 1949, according to the Committee's survey, the IIC was-

: formalized and by charter restricted to coordinating investi-
; .- : s Sations.in intelligence matters domestically.

In commenting on the role of the FBI the Committee
further noted, "The Federal Bureau of Investigation, however,
is the recognized center of the domestic aspect of internal

security including countorintelligence within the Unitod States
and its possessions." :

With vegard to the use and surfacing of sources,
the Committee noted that CIA was not bound to disclose its
sources; however, it commented on the excellent liaison
system of the FBI which had overcome this restriction so far
as internal security within the U. S. is concerned. "Now,
as a matter of practice *he CIA usually refers domestic sources
to the FBI, the only exception being where the source is to be
used in foreign intelligence work by the CIA." [In the area
of defectors within this country, the Committee noted that
the FBI wiil receive from CIA or by a direct interrogation of
a CiA-controllied defector information which the defector may
have concerning internal security. Persons who defect within
this country, on the other hand, were found to be under the
cognizance of the FBI, Then the reverse of the above situation
comes into play and CIA has access to the defector for developing
leads in the fereign intelligence field. The Committee
commented, "it is the duty of the FBI to conduct investigations
ef all cases involving f.reign nationals in the United States
as set forth in the Delimitations Agreement."

A review of the Commission report lends one important
fact to our study of this subject matter. This was pointed

“up by the membership of the various groups at the disposal

of the National Security Council within the field of national
intelligence, Ten subcommittees or working groups with member~
ship from separate departments or interested agencies acted

in advisory capacities to the IAC parent committee. In each

- of these subcommittees the chairman was a representative of

the Director of CIA and the working groups were individually
serviced by a secretariat furnished by CIA. From the top-
heavy alignment of CIA personnel in IAC and its working groups
it, was obvious in which direction advisory opinions would be

“. slanted when dissenting matters were presented by the IAC and

CIA to the NSC.

£. The Doolittle Committee, 1954 i

In July, 1954, we received information: from the
White House that the President had appointed Lieutenant
General James H, Doolittle to study in collaboration with
the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) certain aspects of
the national intelligence effort. By letter dated 7
July 28, 1954, Sherman Adams, the Assistant to the President,
requested that the Bureau brief General Doolittle's group
concerning the relationship that existed between the Bureau
and CIA. We subsequently learned that at approximately the
same time a survey would be conducted by the Hoover
Commission under the chairmanship of General Mark Clark.

We learned from Allen W. Dulles, Director of CIA, that the

. President strongly believed that General Clark should not

| permit the survey to get into CIA covert operations,
‘particularly in the field of political and psychoidagical

warfare. The President had told Dulles that he was selecting

General Doolittle to study CIA's covert operations.

-General Doolittle's group was briefed on /
August 25, 1954, at which time the Bureau's position in
the intelligence field was described and the manner in
which the Bureau transacted business with CIA was explained.
In addition, certain constructive criticism concerning
problems and conflicts experienced in dealing with CIA was
:. furnished General Doolittle's group. The following salient

. features of the criticism appear to bear’on the current study:

We were critical of a policy of the Office of
Operations, CIA,which precluded that Division from
identifying any of its sources in the United States when
.such sources possessed information bearing on the internal
security of the United States. The Office of Operations as
of 1954 collected foreign intelligence information in the
United States from aliens, businessmen, and others, and 7
periodically would receive information of interest to the
Bureau. -Instances arose where the Bureau desired to interview
the original source but was’ prevented from getting to the

7 s te



«advance notification whea. spies were coming to this country..

source by CIA policy. We were of the opinion that CIA's
policy could be modified to allow us direct accoss to
the source in the United States when such was necessary. —

As of 1954, CIA had interest in various
organizations such as Radio Free Europe and others and
from time to time the Bureau would get involved in:
investigation of organizations only to learn they were
being supported or guided by CIA. Our opinion was that
if we had been appropriately notified of CIA's interest
considerable investigative time and manpower could have /
been saved and in addition we would have been in a position
to notify CIA when, anything of interest came to our
attention,

Concerning CIA investigations in the United
States, we readily acknowledged CIA's right to investig -
gate its own applicants or consultants. We did object
to CIA's undertaking any investigation in this country
when the facts indicated the case was clearly within
Bureau jurisdiction and pointed out that the Bureau had
“recently become involved in investigating an individual
suspected of espionage activity. We were in contact with
CIA and had-solicited its help concerning certain aspects
. in the case but it was a few weeks before we learned CIA
had conducted a very close investigation of this same
“individual. We made the observations that close and open
cooperation between the Bureau and CIA was. vital to the |
“proper handling of espionage cases. : :

The Bureau pointed out that as of 1954 it had
veceived little or no significant. information concerning
- espionage: or sabotage agents coming to the United States.
We excluded diplomatic personnel in this matter but clearly
indicated that CIA should be in a position to give us some

~ 40 =



Possibly this latter was the strongest criticism
we had since we did not feel CIA with its resources and
overseas contacts was performing one of its prime functions
in the intelligence field; that is, identifying foreign
illegals who are en route to the United States. During our
briefing of General Doolsttle's group, we described the
Bureau's collection of intelligence information for the
interested Government agencies as a major operation. Our
discharge of our intelligence operation concerning the
Communist Party and Soviet and Satellite diplomats was
explained in detail to the satisfaction of all personnel
attending the briefing.

General Doolittle asked for recommendations as to
what could be done to improve CIA so the Bureau would get
better service. It was suggested that corrective action be
taken on the matters which had been criticized constructively;
CIA should establish adequate coverage (although not

.., Specifically noted, this obviously regarded advance notice
“ of foreign intelligence personnel coming to the United States);
and finally CIA should transmit information developed in an
expedite fashion. '

Prior to submitting the report to.the President,
General Doolittle expressed a desire to see Mr. Hoover, whom
he regarded as the outstanding intelligence authority in the
world, The General visited the Director on October 5, 1954,
during which visit CIA's operations were discussed and
generally the points of the previous meeting were reiterated.
General Doolittle felt the ideal solution would be to wipe out
-CIA entirely and start all over again, but since this was
impractical his committee would point out certain weaknesses
and make certain recommendations and suggestions to the
President for the correction of these weaknesses.

“We do not have the contents of General Doolittle! Ss

i . , Was issued from it which in any way delineated the respective
i : jurisdiction of the Bureau or of CIA.

Lyman B. Kirtkpatrick, Inspector General, Central Intelligence
Agency (CIA), acting as a representative of the Director of
Central Intelligence (DCI). The other four members of the
Study Group represented the Department of State, Secrotary of
Defonse, Bureau of the Budget, and the National Security:
Council (NSC). : :

Beceeee The stated targets of examination by the Group were
‘organizational and management aspects within the intelligence
effort relating to all aspects of foreign intelligence. In
the confines of these objectives the Bureau was not considered
for examination by the Group in view of the Bureau's lack of ©
operational jurisdiction in matters outside of this country.
Mr. Belmont, acting for the Bureau, gave a briefing before the

“Group on'7/29/60 regarding the Bureau's relations with other
United States intelligence agencies. There was no mention
‘made of the Bureau in the report except in one of its
recommendations relative to reorganization of the membership
of the United States Intelligence Board (USIB) which will be.
“dealt with in more detail later.

The 141 page report snhmitted by the Group appeared
to be apologetic in tone for any shortcomings of CIA. The
er reader obtains the definite impression the report was used as
NA a@ sounding board for differences of opinion as to methods and
7 administration for collection of foreign intelligence (overt
and covert) abroad. :

The main basis for conclusions and recomuendations
-made by the Group rested in delineation of duties of DCI as
coordinator of intelligence as opposed to DCI secondary
responsibility as head of CIA. The Group recognized service
1 gealousies apparently resulting from refusal to accept the
fact that DCI could control and coordinate intelligence effort
without affording preferential treatment to CIA which was his
operational and administrative arm. .
a There is no reference in the report to a clear
definition of CIA. operational responsibilities or jurisdiction
within continental United States.

' fhe, Group found that DCI through heads of missions
abroad and designated DCI ‘yepresentatives in foreign countries
had principal responsibility for control and coordination of
foreign collection efforts. The. CIA's operations abroad were
recognized in almost all 43-of the Group's recommendations. ©

.

Recommendation number 17 emphasized that CIA
should place emphasis on the establishment of unofficial
cover throughout the world; recommendation number 20 was
that CIA should increase intelligence support to unifiod and

component commanders by direct dissemination from pertinent
field stations. :

The report noted that CIA's main requirements
problem related to clandestine collection and concerned
the great number of requirements served on the Agency. . .

The main tone of the report was that greater
cooperation was required between the Joint Chiefs of Staff
(JCS), Department of State, and CIA in carrying out foreign

‘intelligence collection missions. The recommendations of
the Group were all directed toward this end and had no
bearing on internal espionage or counterespionage activities
_ Within the United States.

stenes In commenting on the coordination duties of the
DCL, the Group pointed out that USIB had been officially
directed to "establish policies and develop programs for
aeeee the guidance of all departments ana agencies conceried; the
as DCI is authorized to make such surveys of departmental
+. - intelligence activities or the various departments and
agencies as he may deem necessary in connection with his
duty to advise the NSC and coordinate the intelligence effort
of the United States." The report interpreted these official
directions to indicate that USIB should assume a greater
_ proportion of the actual direction and control of the
intelligence community of which the Bureau was noted to be
a member.

. To strengthen USIB position as a director,
coordinator, and controller of intelligence effort, the
Group recommended (recommendation number 30) that the USIB
should be reduced to four members who should be the DCI
(chairman) and representatives of Secretary’of State, Secretary
of Defense, and Joint Chiefs of Staff. The FBI and the Atomic

It should be noted in considering the proposed
change of USIB membership that the Bureau was a member of

six of the twenty-six subcommittees which formed the coumittee
make-up of the USIB,

Memorandum January 10, 1961, Mri Belmont ‘to
Mr, Parsons outlined the proposed USIB membership change
for the Director, It recommended that Buxeau make no issue

_of the proposed recommendation. The Director underlined

& passage of the memorandum which stated "In one sense of
the word it could be arj,aed the FBI would lose prestige
by changing from a regular member to an ad hoc member."
The Director approved the recommendation of the memorandum

. With the following notation: "O.K. but I am not enthusiastic

about the change of our status. H." Our status, however, was
not changed and the Bureau has continued to hold full membex=
Ship on the Board.

In brief, the Joint Study Group Report noted that
the majority of the recommendations of the Study Group had
been favorably received by the intelligence community in
that positive action had been taken to place most of them
in effect, Many of the recommendations of the Group were
felt to have .been met by the creation of the Defense

Intelligence Agency (DIA) which acted as a coordinator and

. overseer of the intelligence effort of the Joint Chiefs

of Staff. There is no comment made in this report which
would bear on our present survey of CIA jurisdiction or
activities within the United States in conflict with our own

= jurisdictional and investigative interests. The only

reference to the Bureau.in this latter report was as
previously mentioned in the comment heehee bac reorganization

forth above under the caption, "The History of Foreign Intelligence
Collection in the United States = Prior to World War II,"
President Roosevelt conducted certain conferences following
which he issued instructions with regard to investigations of
‘fascist and communist activities in the United Statas. Those
investigations were to be for intelligence purposes, For the
most part, they took on a counterintelligence aspect; however,
during the course of them foreign intelligence information was -
. developed either as an outgrowth of ‘investigative activity or
through the conducting of technical surveillances,

We found no record regarding the designation of the
FBI as the agency responsible for collection of foreign intelligence

we find any record indicating such responsibility had been Bua

¢. FBI's Role in the United States Intelligence Board

The predecessor to the United States Intelligence

Board (USIB) was the Intelligence Advisory Committee (IAC). .
the IAC was established by National Security Council Intelligence
Directive (NSCID) number 1 dated 12/12/47, By amendment to

this Directive dated 7/7/49, the Bureau was designated a

member of the IAC for the purpose of coordinating domestic
intelligence with foreign intelligence, NSCID 1 has been
revised several times, Subsequent to a revision dated 4/21/58,°
_ the President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board merged the
IAC and the U. S. Communications Intelligence Board into one
body known as the United “tates Intelligence Board, National
Security Council Directive. dated 9/15/58, approved by the
President, formally ereated the United States Intelligence Board
as successor, to the IAC and the U. S, Communications Intelligence

The USIB in its present form is chaired by the |
Director-of Central Intelligence. The. Director. of Central. |

and Research, Department of State; the Deputy Director of CIA;
the Director of the Defense Intelligence Agency; the Director

is the coordination of intelligence activities, In this
regard, USIB's major effort is concerned with the preparation
and approval of National Intelligence Estimates (NIE) for use
- by policy makers,

7 As a rule, the Bureau does not participate in the’

* preparation of NIE's inasmuch as the subject matter is usually ~
outside the jurisdiction of this Bureau. We have in the past.-
“participated in some selective NIE's such as certain estimates
on Cuba, world communism, the clandestine introduction of

Over the years, consideration has been given to

the Bureau's withdrawing its membership from USIB. On each
eccasion the Director has chosen to have the Bureau retain
its membership on the Board, The last such occasion occurred
in 1964 during the period when John McCone was Chairman of
the United States Intelligence Board, At that time, the military
services were removed from membership on the Board and replaced
by the Defense Intelligence Agency. At the time, Mr. Belmont,
then Assistant to the Director, orally discussed with the
Director the possibility of the Bureau's withdrawing from the
USIB. The Director's comments were that we would not request

. removal from membership on the Board but would withdraw our
membership only if so requested by the Director of Central
Intelligence in his role as Chairman of the USIB. The Bureau's
withdrawal would, of course, require action on the part of
the National Security Council.

> @, The President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board (PFIAB)

This group was originally organized in January, 1956,
as tne President's Bbuard of Counultants on Torcign Intelligence
vs. - Activity. Its primary function at that time was to review
uC) - periodically the Government's foreign intelligence efforts
with specific emphasis on the operations of the Central
Intelligence Agency. It was established as a result of
recommendations by the Hoover Commission. In the later years
of the Eisenhower Administration the activity of the group ’
, fell off and it was re-organized in its present form with the
4 advent of the Kennedy Administration,

Our relationship with this Board has historically
been one of informal liaison in view of the fact that the
primary function of the Board is concerned with foreign
intelligence. There have been occasions where representatives
of the Bureau: briefed individual members and/or panels of
the Board concerning our jurisdiction, techniques and
accomplishments in the intelligence field. -These briefings

“shave ‘been received with a. receptive and sympathetic attitude.
Our main, concern in following the activities of this Board
hasbeen to dssure“that ‘the~Central Intelligence Agency: does
not encroach upon our jrrisdiction and upon the functions of °:
the various intelligence communities in which we hold membership.

: - present .PFIAB in view of the most serious ramifications it
presented. This case concerned the penetration by the
Soviets of the National Security Agency. ‘The report which
emanated from the PFIAB study included proposals which affect
the responsibilities and activities of several agencies within
the intelligence community. All of the twenty-one recommendations.
of the Board dealt with various aspects of achieving a
strengthened counterintelligence capability to guard against

were approved by the President and three of these related
directly to Bureau activity.: They are as follows: °

e, The Director's Stand Over the Years

The Director's stand over the years with respect i
_ to jurisdiction concerning foreign intelligence matters
within the United States is reflected in numerous comments
he has made dating back to the days when thé Central
Intelligence Group (CIG) was being formed,

In June, 1946, General Vandenberg, then head of
CIG, sent a memorandum to the Director proposing that the,
National Intelligence Authority issue a directive extending
the powers and duties of the Director of Central Intelligence,
which position General Vandenberg occupied. The memorandum
was analyzed on June 21, 1946, in a memorandum from C. H.
Carson to D. M. Ladd in which it was pointed out that it
was inevitable’ that CIG must enter into the domestic
picture because of sources of foreign intelligence in that

Tamm and Mr. C. A. Tolson which was followed by comments py
the Director which is most pertinent to the subject ta

uncez discussion, The addendum read:

"Mr. Tolson and Mr. Tamm do not concur with

. the conclusion expressed in this memorandum that
‘It is inevitable that the Central Intelligence
Group must enter into the domestic field picture
‘insofar as intelligence’is concerned because of

: the sources of foreign intelligence existing in

‘that field.' They feel that a coordinated pro-
gram for the exchange of information between the
Central Intelligence Authority and the FBI,

-; permitting a free and comprehensive exchange of
information in matters of mutual interest, will
enable the Bureau to work in the domestic field
without interference from the Central Intelligence ~-
Authority in the same manner that the Bureau works,
for example, with local police departments or other

.» governmental agencies within defined jurisdictional
lines. We believe that the attached letter to 7
General Vandenberg is satisfactory."

‘the Director commented as follows:

: "J am not as optimistic as are Tolson & Tamm, Soren
I think it is inevitable that there will be a :
+ collision with CIG over our domestic jurisdiction
h ahidwey set Aaitotate

aasae! =~ 50 =



-or-rather their expansion into it on intelligence 7
matters. It ought not occur but this new memo — :
of CIG shows how grocdy it is, It is the .
Donoyan plan almost in toto & is boing slyly
put over. It means we must zealously guard our |
domestic jurisdiction & not yield an inch & be vy
ever alert to resist any encroachment."

On March 27, 1953, the Director testified before the
Senate Subcommittee on Appropriations. In response to a question
from Senator McCarran concerning liaison between FBI and CIA,
the Director stated: "There is close liaison. CIA has
exclusive jurisdiction abroad for intelligence. We have .
| exclusive jurisdiction within the United States, We maintain
j continuous liaison with CIA Headquarters in Washington through
a@ liaison representative of our Bureau in order to facilitate
the transmission of material from them to us and from our
service to them."

In October, 1958, CIA approached us requesting
7 cux concurrence in CIAts establishing physical and technical
eee -surveillance -in the United States on the © ast
FHEeeHEE 4 CIA had an operational interest in
: + this individual. By memorandum it was recommended that the
Bureau not become involved in this CIA operation and that CIA
be informed that this would not establish a precedent for
approval of future CIA activities in the United States.
Responsive to continuing to present problems, the Director
noted: "This, is an understatement particularly if we are
going to adopt a macaroni backbone attitude instead of standing
up forthrightly for our rights and jurisdiction."

CIA, in April, 1959, advised us that one of its .
sources would be visiting the United States, and
requested our concurrence in CIA's establishing coverage
including technical surveillance. ‘It was recommended we stay
out of this matter and inform CIA that this ‘was not to be
.. construed as a precedent for approval of future CIA counter~
“intelligence activity in the United States. .The Director
commented on the memorandum; "The trend has gone so far we
have become nothing but a rubber stamp for CIA yet they won't
even allow us to perform beet baer behroaidan abroad much iia
operational ones,'T

Se eee he

In January, 1960, CIA agreed to comply with -
conditions imposed by the Bureau with regard to developing i
positive ‘intelligence information through contacts between '
U. S. residents and visitors from Iron Curtain countrios,
CIA agroed to contact us first before promoting such :
associations. In March, 1960, CIA inquired if it might obtain
. Bureau clearance at the field level for such contacts in the
: interest of axpodioncy. Mr. Tolson noted: “More and more we
are agreeing to CIA operations in the U. S. I am opposed
to this relaxation. We can exercise better control here than
through our field offices.'' The Director added: "I share
-Tolson's views."" CIA was advised clearance was to be obtained
‘ through Bureau headquarters. :

A source, furnished information alleging
penetration of American intelligence. One Serge Karlow, a
CIA officer, was developed as a suspect. On 2/9/62, we took

_. over the investigation. On 2/26/62, Sheffield Edwards, then
CIA Director of Security, admitted CIA had had technical
coverage on Karlow from February, 1961 to 2/9/62. Edwards’
claimed his reluctance te tell us of this situation earlier
because of obvious possible jeopardy to prosecution, plus
embarrassment to his Agency should the Bureau raise an
objection to CIA's maintaining such coverage. The Director
noted: "I only wish we would eventually realize CIA can
-never be depended upon to deal forthrightly with us. Certainly
my skepticism isn't based on prejudice nor suspicion but on
specific instances all too many in number. Yet there exists
wistful belief that 'the leopard has changed his spots'."

In April, 1962, we received information on a
strictly confidential basis from Jay Sourwine of the Senate
Internal Security Subcommittee to the effect that an
unidentified CIA representative had talked to Senator Eastland
concerning an alleged move to place CIA in charge of: all
intelligence~gathering operations for the Government -- to
include Soviet espionage in the U. S. The Director noted:

"Y am not surprised at the above alleged effort, There is no
doubt in many quarters a desire to eliminate the FBI in
i dealing with espionage and subversion for we are a thorn not
i only in the side of communists but also the ADA and Fabian
Socialists. CIA which failed again and again to, know what
is actually going on abroad could be counted upon to blunder
the same way in the USA." : : .

In April, 1963, we received information indicating

. that CIA Director John MeCone was considering expansion of

CIA operations in the United States ~- specifically intelligence
coverage and the development of sources in this country. The
Director made a note on the memorandum recording this: "McCone
is trying to do another 'Donovan.* If he injects himself into
the U. S., the FBI gets out. Too many cooks spoil the broth."

In December, 1963, the Director inquired as to the
nature and extent of intelligence operations wherein CIA had
established contact with a diplomat, operated him in the U. S.
with our coordination, and continued to operate him upon his
having departed this country. Four such cases were cited. On
the memorandum, the Director noted: "I have little confidence
in CIA abiding by agreements if it serves its purpose better
not to do SO. *

In January, 1964, CIA advised us it had reorganized

ats activities in the U. S. The Domestic Operations Division,
“CIA, had established field offices in this country under .
. appropriate cover, A memorandum was prepared describing the

history of°CiA operativus in the U. S. and recommending action

designed to protect our interests. A letter went to CIA with
ground rules which the Bureau expected CIA to follow in all

- matters requiring coordination, The Director noted: "OK, but

I hope you are not being taken in. I can't forget CIA :
withholding the French espionage activities in the U. S. nor
the false story concerning Oswald's trip to Mexico City, only
to mention two of their instances of double dealing."

: The New York Office, by letter 2/14/64, -set “forth :
its observations concerning a briefing given that office on the

". matter of CIA operations in the U. S. The Director commented:

"Y think this domestic operations expansion of CIA is very

..dangerous and will inevitably ‘muddy' the waters."

In May, 1964, the Bureau reconsidered its stand
with respect to permitting CIA to approach sources at foreign

- establishments in the United States, for intelligence purposes.

The following policy was proposed and subsequently approved:

(1) Where there was no indication a source would
be leaving the United States, we would deny CIA clearance
for contact uatil we had fully explored the person's
potential for our owa purposes If we decided we had no



interest and CIA contact would not jeopardize any FBI
investigations, we would grant CIA approval to proceed
with its contact with proviso we be kept informed of
information developed of possible interest to us.

(2) Where it appeared source ‘would be returning
to a foreign country shortly we would normally grant
CIA clearance for preliminary contact with proviso we
be kept informed of results. We reserved the right to
take direct access to the source as our needs required.

(3) Where there was an overlapping of interests

‘and source expected to continue in United States for

fairly extended period of time, in'those instances where
CIA had entree and no Bureau investigation would be
jeopardized we would permit CIA to explore matter and
make preliminary contact keeping us advised of progress
and getting our specific clearance before a direct .
recruitment approach; however, where factors indicated
it would be to best Bureau interests to operate source, |
we would undertake the recruitment and keep CIA advised
of information of interest to that Agency,

When these matters were submitted for approval

Hr. Tolson commented, "Looks okay, but we will have to watch

De {HE NEED AND THE POTENTIAL FOR : 4
nN ’ FOREIGN INTELLIGENCE IN THE U, S. a ener,

In 1941, the U. S. allegedly had in its
possession practically all of the foreign intelligence
it needed regarding military and strategic targets in
Japan, The informacion was scattered among various ‘
individuals who had personal knowledge or was located : .
in libraries, various Government agencies, private
pusiness firms, institutions, et cetera, Tragically,
the U. S, Government did not have any mechanism to
collect, record and evaluate such information,
Intelligence was badiy needed in 1941, and we paid
dearly in lives and financial resources to accomplish
certain missions because the information was >not
readily available.

uo ae Today, the need for foreign intelligence is
‘ ‘ greater than ever, The stakes of foreign policy have
‘ never been higher, The U. S., being a dominating world
- “ power, has assumed vast responsibilities enmeshed in F
delicate political situations throughout the world. . -. |
7 The ever-existing threat of an atomic war with communist
Waateneeceenseuanee countries demands a continuing acquirement of knowledge
s0 thatpolicies and courses of action can be designed SCHEEEE
in the most effective manner possible, -The information
needed applies to numerous fields of activity, a major :
area being scientific research and development, In this ;
connection, the revolutionary break-throughs in the :
scientific category are occurring with unusually high
frequency, and if the U. S. is to remain in the BOEEESEED
forefront, it is absolutely necessary that we obtain
an accurate evaluation of the enemy's capabilities and
‘ intentions. We have been fortunate to collect high-
quality positive intelligence through sophisticated
collection methods, i.e high altitude photography and
research in this area is proceeding at an accelerated
pace, Nevertheless, electronic, gadgets and machines a
Will never produce.all that is required, We still need
supplementary coverage on a heavy scale, and the human
being still continues to be a vital source of information,
fhe individual talks and volunteers information, He talks
and his statements are intercepted, All of this produces
valuable increments of intelligence, The individual can
still provide badly needed data either through his /
voluntary contribution or through his’ unwitting divulging

of intelligence, The importance of the individual

is further omphasized when we realize that'as each
sophisticated collection technique is introduced,
science also introduces newly designod countortochniquos
of covoring, protecting, and camouflaging important
assets, In essence, tgchnolog: Yy eventually hits an
inpenctrable or leveling-off depth. F 7

Foreign intelligence is not geographically
restricted. Information regarding Chinese Communists
can be obtained anywhere in the world, and even if it
is of a fragmentary nature, the data can be of
significant value. The demand for information is |
heavy and is sought by every agency in the Government.
Because of this, it has been necessary for the |-

U. S. Government to map a program of collection on
a priority basis, This has been done through the
creation of a committee which is attached to the ”
U. S. Intelligence Board, The committee maintains

‘a list of priorities on a current basis, A recent

list of guidelines for the collection of foreign
intelligence pertaining to scientific affairs in

Communist China inciuded approximately 170, items,

i. eo.

, ¢
In the U. S. proper, the sources of foreign

intelligence are voluminous, Most of these sources
overtly provide information through newspapers,
scientific publications, libraries, tourists, visiting
professors and students, journalists, and immigrants,
The compilation, collation, analysis, and reporting
of such information involves an extensive program
and, needless to say, the U. S, today does not have
the capability of tapping all Satdreeatehtend sources on
a etal basis. :



a ; @

For the purpose of this paper, we are
thinking about the search fox knowledge considered
‘vital for national survival, One could suggest
that clandestine collection of intelligence.is
overemphasizod and that our Government could readily
protect its interests through overt collection and
the employment of our best analysts and evaluators,
If we take this approach, we may as well discount
the importance.of the Bureau's activities in the
counterintelligence field, which essentially are
of a clandestine nature and which have produced time
‘and again vital intelligence. We, therefore, must -
move on the assumption that the clandestine :
collection of foreign intelligence is very definitely
@ most necessary element of our over-all intelligence
capabilities, :
: In addition to the overt sources, there
“exists a rich potential in the U. S. among the foreiga

diplomatic establishments including the U. N., the
officials of foreign governments, and visitors sich
as students, professors, and scientists. A certain
amount of infusmation from such sources can he
obtained in an overt fashion, but the high quality
data is normally acquired through clandestine means,
This can be done through technical. monitoring,
development of live sources, access to records,
files, et cetera. There are approximately 10,000
foreign officials in the U. S. assigned to embassies,
consulates, trade missions, U. N., and other
international organizations. This excludes i
dependents, During the fiscal year ending June 30,
1965, 38,544 foreign government officials visited
the U. S.3; about 1500 of these came from communist-bloc
countries, During the fiscal year ending June 30, 1965,

approximately 50,000 foreign students came to the U. S.}; oe

733 of these came from the communist bloc, During the
same fiscal year, there were 2,075,967 visitors from
all countries, Everyone of the foregoing is a potential

“** “gource of foreign intelligence, As can be readily

accepted, the U. S. Government does not have a capa~

s+ bility. of assessing each and every one of ‘these sources

mo

for foreign intelligence, We can say at this point
that the FBI and CIA are just’ scratching the surface, °
It is recognized that a program designed to assess

Since the U. S. is such a major power, é
Washington, D. C. is the center of diplomatic activity :

EB, CURRENT CAPABILITIES OF CIA IN ~ :
. THE FOREIGN INTELLIGENCE COLLECTION
’ FIELD IN THE UNITED STATES

In order that there may not be Ay
misunderstanding regarding CIA's capabilities to
collect foreign intelligence in the United States,
we should first clarify that one of the components
. of the Agency which has offices in the United States
does not engage in this particular activity.

The Office of Security, which is responsible for
personnel and physical security, maintains several
offices in the United States under authorized
Treasury Department cover, Personnel of this

office conduct investigations of applicants, firms
or individuals who may be utilized by CIA on

a contract basis to support intelligence operations
overseas,

The overt collection of intelligence by

CIA is handled by the Domestic Contact Service (pcs)
(formerly called Contact Division).''CIA estimates .
that DCS has a capability of tapping approximately
15 per cent of the total potential of intelligence in
the U, S. This Division has 18 field offices and
16 resident agencies in the United States, and each
office is openly identified as being connected with
CIA, Personnel totaling approximately 140 carry CIA
exredentiais. The Division regularly has a number of
officers from the various military services who are
assigned to this Division on a temporary basis,
Yhese military officers concentrate on the collection
of that foreign intelligence which relates to the
immediate United States military needs, The personnel
of DCS interview aliens, tourists, officials of
import-export firms, students, scientists, and the
information collected covers a very broad spectrum in
the positive intelligence category. DCS.claims to have
contact with about 7200 organizations, institutions, or’
businesses and has approximately 60,000 contacts or
- gources of information, The information is reported in

the form of “Information Reports," which is disseminated

throughout the intelligence community, During/1965,

asHessHHSsri edi tientiey



Weaeeece DCS disseminated 26,000 such reports, DCS does not
| have any responsibilities in the clandestine collection
{i ’ of intelligence, and in that sense it is very :
specifically not operational, DCS definitely cannot
engage in any activity o# an internal security nature,
and within CIA it is clearly understood that DCS is
} . not to be operational under any circumstances, Ni
| Patetst + PCS has boen the subject of some controversy witht:
CIA, There is-one school of thought which maintains
that DCS should be an appendage of the Deputy Director
of Plans, who is responsible for all clandestine
operations, The other school which has prevailed
holds ‘to the line that DCS should be separate and-
continue under the supervision of the Deputy Director -
of Intelligence (DDI). This situation not only has
caused headaches for CIA but also for the Bureau because
: : of situations which arise where the "left hand does not
i know what the right hand is doing."
a DCS is essentially carrying out CIA's ids
responsibilities emanating from National Security Council
on + _ Intelligence Directive (NSCID) No. 2 which has its roots
i : in a Simisar airective issued under the Naticnal
i ‘eC Intelligence Authority in 1946, It has been in business
: for approximately twenty years, Per agreement, DCS
cannot interview an alien without first clearing with
the Bureau,. This is done on a daily basis, With regard
: .. . ‘to American citizens, Bureau approval is not required
: : _ unless the Bureau has indicated a prior interest in the
individual; however, DCS nevertheless submits name
checks on Americans, and if it so happens that the
subject of such an inquiry is a Bureau source or
involved in a Bureau investigation, we are in a position
: : to move to protect our interests, It should be noted
E : that although. DCS is engaged primarily in positive
“.  gntelligence collection, it is required to be.on the
alert for sources who possibly might be useful to CIA's
clandestine operations, For example, if. DCS encounters
an alien who can be utilized in an overseas operation,
the lead is paSsed on to the appropriate division,
At the present time, DCS alerts the newly created
Domestic Operations Division (explained below) regarding
potential sources, 7 He

Our current controls with regard to DCS are
functioning efficiently, We regularly examine the

i

fi
|

status of this relationship, and we periodically es
make adjustments in order to make certain there
is no "freewheeling" and to take.advantage of the :
information which DCS gains.and which is of interest”
to the Bureau. For.example, wa are currently working
out arrangements where our field offices can contact
the local DCS offices concerning Chinese aliens who
fee : might be of interest to us either as subjects for \
; investigation or as potential.informants, This liaison
at the field level was deemed desirable so that we
could get information at the “horse's mouth" rather
than wait for a reply from CIA headquarters, which is
often prolonged and, when transmitted, is sometimes
stripped of pieces of information. This occurs
because of the involved and sometimes complicated
‘maze of bureaucratic compartmentation within CIA,
In the latter part of 1963, CIA created its
raal Domestic Operations Division (DOD), which was to be
‘responsible for any clandestine development of sources
in the United States, Prior to the establishment of
this Division, CIA activity in this field was managed
. from each individual area division at Washington
y “- headquarters, The pressing need for more clandestine
KY. sources, coupled with the recognition of the vast
- +. potential in the United States, prompted CIA to create
@ new division which would be responsible for all of
the area division interests, DOD has headquarters
at Washington, D, C., and currently has field offices : 7
.° at New York City, Boston, Chicago, San Francisco, if
1 . Les Angeles, Honolulu, and Washington, D, C., proper.
Approximately 40 intelligence officers are assigned to
the task of engaging in assessment and/or recruitment
of positive intelligence sources, primarily in the
diplomatic field, Some of the personnel are assigned
to the handling of firms or organizations which may “od
_ be supporting certain CIA operations abroad. DOD personnel
in the field operate under authorized Department of Defense
cover, The heads of these field offices are known to us,
and we have established a satisfactory liaison area at
the field level, canaaat

DOD is also responsible for the handling of .
CIA agents (informants) who have been recruited abroad {
and who come to the United States for assignments either
on a temporary basis or for the duration of a normal
diplomatic assignment,

\. The creation of DOD within CIA was and still
‘ is a somewhat controversial Agency subject, DCS saw
DOD as an interfering element, The area desks were
reluctant to have a new division to take over thoir
‘agents, Some of the DOD personnel are vory capable
and seasoned intelligence officers, Many of them are
considered of mediocre capability, and there is \
a frequent rumor that other CIA divisions send their
misfits to DOD, From CiA's standpoint there appoars
to be a definite need for a much stronger team within DOD,

Theoretically, DOD is required to be on the
alert for all potential sources who can be used by CIA
in its intelligence operations, and the approach is
basically one of a long-range nature, DOD is required
to make use of-all leads emanating from fellow employees
\Who may have developed social contacts or associations
with foreigners abroad or who might meet potential .
sources in the United States. Since CIA personnel

‘ operate under diplomatic cover when abroad, they do get
the opportunity to move in diplomatic circles, Similarly,
undercover agents of CIA traveling throughout the world
also make contacts which offer potential exploitation if
and when the target stops in the United States,

Since January, 1964, when DOD actually began
moving, it has recruited approximately ten individuals
in the diplomatic field. Most of these were in the
nonconmunist-bloc area, All of those recruited appear
to have been in a fairly low-level category, All of them
were career diplomats, and there was no evidence that
the individuals were connected with any inteliigence
service,

In addition to the activities of DCS and DOD,
aoa a there is a certain amount of CIA operational movements
7 which do not fall under either of the foregoing divisions.
One example is the CIA base in Miami which was set up
_.. for CIA's operations directed against the Cuban Government,
- Mhis base is used for the training and dispatching of
agents into Cuba and to some extent into other countries
in the Caribbean, particularly the Dominican Republic,
This base is directly responsible to the Western
Hemisphere Division of CIA, which could be called the
Latin American Division, : : :

CIA also becomes involved in political and :
psychological warfare type of programs directed against
targets in foreign countries, The Agency broadly refers
to this activity as "covert action." The’ programs ara
essontially designed to influence individuals, organizations ©
or governments through various news media, and this will
include the utilization of "agents of influence." This
activity falls under the International Organizations \
Division (10D) of CIA, which has no responsibility to
collect information, IOD does use people in the
United States to hely implement the overseas programs.

collection, it is a CIA division which should be kept in
mind, Since its activities quite often will be tangent to
matters of interest to the Bureau, For example, IOD
becomes involved in the World Youth Festival, where its
objective is to neutralize communist influence. We, of
course, have had an interest in the Festival because of the
participation of Americans, including members of the CPUSA.
Theoretically, IOD is required to coordinate closely with
other appropriate components of CIA, We do not believe
that this coordination has been effective enougn.

There is no doubt that there are individuals
in CIA who aspire to broaden the Agency's operational
activities in the United States, Such individuals would
dike to see an arrangement Similar to one currently in
force in England where MI-G has a free hand to assess and
recruit all foreigners, including diplomats, where there
is no evidence that they are engaged in intelligence

-activity, If such evidence is obtained, MI-6 is required

to coordinate with MI-5, There are people in CIA who
would like to see similar machinery and in addition would
want the freedom to conduct certain investigations and
maybe even institute technical surveillances,

In summary, CIA so far has a very limited ~
capability to recruit foreign diplomatic sources in the

“United States, but the Agency appears to have done fairly

well with a relatively small staff; however, it can be
anticipated that this capability will increase, CIA's
effectiveness will probably be adversely affected for
some time to come because of the Agency's well~known
deficiencies, such as lack of discipline, loose admins.
istration, and lack of skilled and talented personnel,-

F, CURRENT CAPABILITIES OF THE Fby {

1. “Manpower Being Devoted

-Té as most difficult to |sive any specific figures as to
how much manpower the FBI is currently devoting strictly to
foreign intelligence collection, separate and apart from the
Bureau's internal security nd counterintclligence functions.
Much of the foreign intelligehce developed by.the Bureau is an
ourgrowth of our internal security investigations and cannot be
neatly separated,in terms of manpower or time,

A substantial amount of our foreign intelligence activity
is concentrated in two offices where most of the diplomatic
. establishments in the United States are located; namely, New York
and Washington Field. Both offices were requested to furnish :
estimates as to how much manpower is being allocated to foreign
intelligence matters, including both live sources developed and
technical coverage. In both cases, the estimates provided were
highly tentative and both c‘fices stress that manpower commitments
in this area fluctuate widely from week to week depending on
international politics and other unpredictable factors. For
instance, during the_Cuban missile crisis of 1962, both offices
greatly increased theix normal manpower commitment to the develop~
; :Ihent or current foreign intelligence. ‘Ihe present vominican crisis
Lon which involves production of foreign intelligence to a large extent
represents another “abnormal" situation,

However, for what it is worth, WFO and New York have
estimated that at the present time they are allocating approxi~
mately 35 Agents and 20 clerical employees to the full time task ‘
of foreign intelligence collection. Virtually all of the clerical
time and about 40,per cent of the Agent time is related to
technical coverage and the balance is aimed at the development of
live sources.

In addition, of course, all of the other offices, including
our Legal Attaches abroad, have devoted manpower to foreign :
intelligence collection in varying degrees. —~ operations © “
conducted in different field offices have involved the assignment
of aS many .aS 10 or 12 Agents for temporary periods. In connection

~«~“with: its “responsibilities in-the Cuban and Latin-American fields, ©:: +"
the Miami and San Juan offices have devoted considerable manpower
to the development of foreign intelligence in recent years. The
Chicago Office in connection with its handling of our * t
informant has devoted manpower to the development of foreign
“intelligence, These represent only a few examples. _

‘ On an overall basis and bearing ‘in mind the @ifficulty iin
citing any precise figures, it is estimated that the Bureau probably ©
averages approximately 50 to 75 Agents and 25 to 30 clerks assigned

primarily to foreign intelligence work.

2. Number .of Microphone and Telephone Surveillances with
Evaluation of Proauct

At present, Bureau has only one microphone surveillance in
foreign intelligence field and this is in connection with a special
National Security Agency project directed against ~ “ coded —
communications, Concerning technical survoillancos, wo azo now
operating about 70 foreign intelligence installations on various
diplomatic eStablishments in this country. The majority of these
are in Washington Field and New York with scattered installations
in Chicago, Miami, Pittsburgh, San Francisco and San Juan. Under
current Bureau pdlicy, we are limited to 80 foreign intelligence
technical surveillances and no microphone surveillances with the |
exception of one on the

In addition, during recent years, we have maintained
approximately 50 so-called "telex" surveiliances on the teletype
facilities of various foreign establishments. This has been done
at the specific request of the National Security Agency, in
connection with its efforts to break foreign codes and to read
foreign government communications,

We have had excellent results from these technical
installations. Any compilation of items of value to the U.S.
Inieliigence Cumnuuity and policy-making officiais developed
through this coverage would run many hundreds.of pages. The results
have ranged from information regarding plans and activities of
key foreign countries in the diplomatic field to information

egarding intelligence, political, economic and military develop~
| ments in the countries concerned. In many instances, we have been
| able to forewarn the White House, the State Department and other
interested agencies of impending developments and to furnish data
giving an insight, into the thinking and strategy of key foreign
| officials and governments. This coverage has proved specially
i valuable during crisis periods such as the Cuban missile crisis of
- 1962 and during the tense negotiations involving the Panama Canal
in 1964. On many occasions, top-ranking United States officials
have commented on the effectiveness of this data. The particular
importance of this information has been its timeliness to current
events aS well as the fact that it represents a penetxtion of
foreign diplomatic circles which is only auniucaeds iobhatatartii
through -live sources. ...... ++. ” oe eeet ’

In some’ instances; of course, this type coverage on a
particular foreign establishment or official has not paid off.
We have had cases where this technique has been unproductive for
sustained periods of time-on a particular country. .This-is to be
expected and we have sought to overcome this by rotating our
| ‘ Gnstallations, correlating our technical operations with shifting
| international developments and putting coverage on those countries
which appear to offer the most promise for worthwhile intelligence.

3. Live Sources With Evaluation

At present we are making active efforts to develop live -.
informant coverage in the diplomatic establishments of 37 non- i
Soviet bloc countries. This list of so-called "target countries"

i varies from time to time but essentially we are seeking informant
coverage in countries considered critical from an intolligence
standpoint such as those leaning towards the Soviet bloc or
countries in which the United States has paramount political or
military interests or which’ are otherwise of primary concern. The
current list includes virtually ali Latin-American countries, a
number of Middle East countries, and scattered countries throughout
Africa and the Far East. :

Our program was initiated in the early 1950s, and we
‘are now using some 50 sources (This number fluctuates due to
transfers, resignations, etc.).. In each case, we clear with
State Department prior to designating any country as a "target"
and we also clear with State prior to conducting interviews with
employees at the "target" establishment. In a number of instances,
including most Latin-American countries, State has asked us to
restrict our efforts to American citizens. This, of course, is
a highly limiting factor.

Over the vears this live informant coverage has on many
vy occasions produced foreign intelligence of rel value. Our sources
CO have frequently provided data regarding proposed political,

diplomatic or economic action by the countries concerned, on
occasion in advance of other forewarning to U.S. intelligence,
They have also been able to furnish a considerable amount of
information regarding the whereabouts, background and general
activities of individual foreign officials of security interest,
thereby saving investigative time. These sources have been
especially valuable in connection with the ~ Program and
other sophisticated attacks on foreign establishments, providing
us with data regarding the physical security, location of code
rooms, etc., of the various foreign establishments.

In addition to so-called "target" countries which are
in the non-Soviet bloc area, the Bureau has developed a number of
‘informants and defectors-in-place in Soviet-bloc establishments
who have been able to furnish a substantial amount of foreign
intelligence. In the Soviet-bloc field, we have also developed
a number of sources in quasi-official establishnents, such as
trade missions, who have produced valuable foreign intelligence.
In the Soviet—bloc field, of course, our live informant development
has been aimed essentially at internal security and counterintelli-
gence “needs of the Bureau.

~- 66 =

“NW 65360 Docld=32989629 Page 238 ~~



: It is significant that we have been able to operate for
many years in the development of live sourccs in foreign diplomatic
estalishments, both Soviet bloc and non-bloc, without encountering
any serious incidents embarrassing to the FBI or the United States
Government.

In assessing the product of such live sources in a number
of instances in the non-Sov..et ficld,, State Department has
requested that we restrict our efforts to Amorican citizens. To
a considerable degrea, this ‘has limited the effectiveness of our
program in the ron-Soviet Zield since U.S. employees of foreign
establishments will normally not have access to top-grade data,
Thus, especially in the non-Soviet bloc field wo are not tapping
the full potential which exists for high-level foreign intelligence.

- This can only be realized through the development of high quality
sources.

4. (This material, which is a peculiarly sensitive foreign

intelligence operation, will be covered in a briefing
to be arranged by the Counsel to the President )

5. Double Agents and Informants a:
In a number of instances, Bureau double agents and informants,
developed to assist us in connection with our internal security and
counterintelligence responsibilities, have been. able to provide
significant high-level i ration of foreign intelligence value,

For example, in the Soviet field, we have developed a
number of top-level sources such as 7 who have
provided current intelligence regarding the organizational structure,

, .. personnel, and operations of the KGB and GRU, both in the Soviet
“Union and abroad; a description of various technical equipment used
.by Soviet intelligence; data regarding current relations between the
Soviet Union and Communist China; and data regarding Soviet foreign
policy, political and military developments, etc. Similar informa-
tion of foreign intelligence value has been developed through FBI
informants, double agents and defectors-in~-place operatiag against

~ 67 - Resirerel

"HINT 65360_Doocid:32989629 Page 239



. Polish, Yugoslav, Czechoslovakian and other conmunist~blioc
countries. For instance, in the Cuban field on several occasions,
FBI informants have been able to develop high-level or current ~-
intelligence regarding conditions in Cuba, and policies of the
Castro regime through personal contacts with ranking Cuban officials
both in the U.S. and abroad. ; : :

Through our coverage of the Communist Party, USA, and

- related organizations we have also ix quently produced foreign
intelligence, although to a lesser extent than in our operations in,
the foreign nationality field. One of our best sources of forcign
intelligence in the domestic area is our so-called *
wherein we have informants acting in a ‘capacity between Gel
Communist Party, USA, and foreign communist groups, including the

- Communist {Party of the Sovict Union. We have developed information
through this operation regarding the Sino-Soviet dispute, social
and political conditions in various countries, both in and outside
the Soviet bloc, and tactics of the international communist movement.

6. Additional Potential

currently producing a considerable volime-of forcign intclligence
through covert means, much of it of a significant | nature. Most of
tnis anata 1s an outgrowth of earn te car Govexvage and

AREAS OF CONFLICT, FBI ~ CIA |

Any differences betwoon FBI and CIA are first
related to a basic problem exis(4 ng in any country among
the major powers, namely "How dues 2 law enforcement
agency coordinate its internal security functions with an
intelligence organization which must operate as a clandestine
service?" The very nature of tha functions of the two
organizations immediately introwucos potential areas ef .
conflict. One essentially operates overtly and the dther
covertly. This alone is enough to create an atmosphere.
fraught with controversies and vonfusion, Because each
agency was molded differently aud because’ responsibilities
differ, there naturally will be conflicting approaches to
national security objectives. or example, in the field
of intelligence the Bureau is banically a counterintelligence
body, CIA, to the contrary, hax a much broader responsibility
in intelligence, which includes eollection of foreign
intelligence, political and psyvhological warfare, inter-
agency coordinating, evaluation, yesearch, etc. Counter-
intelligence within CIA is actually a relatively small

' component of the agency. Persounel in the two organizations
is recruited under diz

x different criteria and standards.
Training is likewise at variances, In a final analysis,

the experienced FBI Agent and the seasoned CIA intelligence
officer are not of the same mold put certainly are tailored
as two entirely and distinctly uirferent instruments. We
should bear in mind that little las been done to introduce
truly substantive cross~fertillivation of outlook, approach
and operational philosophy betwann the two agencies, This
could be advocated from a Utopikn point of view, but it

-also could be argued that there are distinct advantages to

maintaining sound compartmentation,

Separate from the above basic and fundamental
situation, the differences between FBI and CIA also relate
to other factors such as: :

1) FBI was first on the scene and was well
established long before CIA camo to life, This led to a
conception in the early years that CIA was an intruder.

2) The seed of CIA was the Office of Strategic
Services (OSS), an organization whose personnel, activities
and free-wheeling were the sources of numerous conflicts

a

~~ NW-65360—Doeld:32989629 -Page-241—



. : with the Bureau during World War II. It was during
oo ‘ these years that an atmosphere of mistrust and lack of
i confidence was created.

: 3) CIA was established as our first aver-all,
! _ Worldwide intelligence agency. The events and the
eeeeee maneuvering which led to this certainly.did not bring
with thom a harmonious relationship.

4) Unfortunately, CIA grew big and grew fast,
particularly because of an unsettled atomic world and
developments such as the Korean War. The Agency did not

. jell effectively as an organization, and with this came
> numerous difficulties, many of which exist to this day.

t 5) Each organization has lacked adequate
knowledge of the other's operational machinery, objectives,
and "ways and means of doing things."

* a 6) An element of rivalry actually developed over
the years, and this, when not tempered with prudence and
sound judgment, creates unhealthy situations.

7) +A growing tendency on the part of CIA to
expand its operational activities not originally contemplated ]
‘in the formation of that agency, . i

| . It can be recognized that with this background it

| c has not been an easy matter to establish a good working Heer

| d relationship with CIA without.frequent conflicts, and q
sometimes agonizing negotiations. It could be suggested EH
that the ideal situation would be to remove CIA from the -

i i U. S. with the understanding that we would assume respon-

i “+  gibility for any and all activity in the intelligence field,

7 As deseribed in another section of this report, such a
move would be highly infeasible for the Bureau.

eae is to our credit that despite the problems of

+. .activities in the U. 3. Soveral years ago cr eaneenoate
were made whereby CiA's Office of Security could conduct’
applicant investigations without infringing upon our juris<
_ diction. For several years we have been permitting CIA to
“interview aliens for foreign intelligence information under -.
ground, rules which. have been: very successful, Our, liaison -

mechanism has been functioning effectively. We have
: : frequent conferences. Bureau personnel lectures before
\ CIA officers, Dissemination of-information is excellent.
| The atmosphere for negotiating and discussing unusually
MeeHe complicated problems is very good, Personnel can work in
i the same area with a minimum of problems, as evidenced in
| : the Dominican Republic. We attond USIB meetings and are
actively engaged in tho work of several committees attached
to USIB, All of this is commendable progress and certainly
beneficial to national security. 7
All of the foregoing was set forth in the way of
background in order to better understand the current source
of differences with CIA, namely the Agency's desire to assess
and recruit foreign intelligence sources in the U.S. in the
foreign diplomatic establishments, including United Nations, -
and to some extent among foreign visitors. CIA fully
acknowledges our internal security and counterintelligence
responsibilities, Tnis is clear-cut and free of any
M . debatable question; however, CIA feels that we have no
i legally-established responsibility in foreign intelligence
collection and that somebody (in this case, CIA) should
7 be fully exploiting the foreign intelligence potentiat an
i) 7 the United States, bearing in mind that there are approxi-
me Pann mately 10,000 foreign officials and employees in this country.”
i CIA argues that a foreign diplomat can be recruited anywhere
. in the world but maintains that there is no better place
than the United States for assessment, recruitment, training
and orientation of an informant, CIA further maintains that
if the Agency moves on a target, such as an Argentine
_ Giplomat who may be a career officer not connected with a
foreign intelligence service, there should not be any con-
flict because the activity is in no way related to the
internal security functions of the Bureau. CIA has also
expressed the attitude that in the communist~bloc field
CIA should be permitted to assess and recruit those
individuals not connected with an intelligence or internal
security service,

* herd axe’ séné Bedpile"'in CIA" wiio are of the “--/
opinion that in the field of foreign intelligence the Bureau.
should be exerting more effort to actually assist CIA in
‘spotting sources and, when needed, give CIA support in

\ - ‘yecruit a source in the U. S., the Agency takes the 7
. position that if the source can be of help to the Bureau
we should levy requirements on CIA and not ask for access
‘to the source unless it clearly appears that only through
7 access wo can properly discharge our responsibilities,
: : : CLA takes a very strong. view that once a source is
: developed it is basically unsound to introduce another
agency into the relationship. The developing agency
may have used techniques peculiar to its own organization
and may have developed 2 relationship under varied cir-
cumstances, and when a new agency is introduced this
relationship with the source could be unfavorably disturbed,
: CIA does not disptite the fact that informant and Agent
fl : - turnovers sometimes are absolutely necessary.

CIA maintains that if the Bureau is given access
to a CIA source we would be responsible for the counter-
intelligence aspects, but if the source produces foreign

- intelligence CIA shculd be responsible for handling this
information, including the dissemination, CIA's position
is that it is better qualified to evaluate the information
and correlate it with the foreign intelligence being
developed abroad, For example, if a Nigerian source of CIA.

eee < also available to the Bureau, furnishes information regarding

. : the Nigerian Foreign Office, CIA claims that it can better

handle the report and dissemination, /

Discussions and agreements with CIA, including
: . the actions stemming from meetings with ‘the representatives
| _. ) Of that agency in November 1965, have resulted in a greatly
| “| improved coordinating machinery, There still are areas of
potential conflict which will necessitate improvement,
They are: z

1) DOD personnel receives leads or tips pertaining °*
to possible access to Soviet-bloc diplomats. This CIA
Division pursues these leads and is inclined to take the
position that such individuals contacted by CIA are their”
"“CIA-controlled sources." if we permitted this to go on
over a period of time, CIA would have a vast network of
- sources not directly available to the Bureau. This is

basically unsound, and there is no reason CIA shouldn't
immediately give us the lead or tip for exploitation.

We can recognize that, depending upon circumstances, it
might be favorable to us and CIA for the Agency to handle
a particular individual, and if so, it would be clearly

coordinated. This would be most important if the , 7
individual in any way was connected with or associated
with an intelligence service, a
i

2) DOD is anxious to have freedom to assess
and recruit Bloc diplomats not known to be engaged in
intelligence activity. On the surface, this does not
appoar to present a problem, but realistically speaking
it is impossible for us to know that a Soviet diplomat,
not known to be engaged in intelligence activity one
day, appears on the scene the following week as an agent
or coopted agent. To give CIA wide latitude in this field
could create a truly undesirable mess. We believe that
if CIA is permitted to move on such targets it should be

done on a selective basis and with maximum coordination,

ae 3) CIA's organizational and operational
deficiencies, such as lack of discipline,{ poor internal
coordination, unsatisfactory records, ali\ introduce head~
aches which undoubtedly will continue to exist for many
years. \

4) There continues to be an element of mistrust

"and misunderstanding between the two organizations because

of the bistorical reasons described above..

5) Continuing lack of one agency's appreciation

.for the other's objectives, responsibilities and operational

philosophy.

6) The absence of a clearly defined Bureau policy
and objectives in the field of foreign intelligence collec=
tion. CIA really does not know the nature and the extent
of our interests, and consequently, this lends ‘to confusion
and misunderstanding. ‘ 7 7

[* H. CURRENT AGREEMENTS BETWEEN FBI AND CIA

: i
1

1. According to SAC Letter 59 dated 5/24/49, CIA and FBI
had reached agreement whereby clearancé would be!requested of FBI
pofore CIA conducted an interviow with an alion in the U.S, This
clearance would consist of a review of Bureau files concerning
individual in question.

According to same SAC Letter, agreement had been reached
by the FBI and CfA wher eby CIA was allowed to contact American
businessmen without obtaining clearance from FBI in order to
obtain positive foreign intelligence information and arrange covers

. for CIA personnel abroad. This agreement was based strictly on
collection of foreign: intelligence and positively did not allow for
the formulation of a network of confidential informants for CIA
in the U.S.

Regarding FBI-CIA agreement that CIA would clear with us
prior to interviewing aliens in U.S., following documentation has
been located. By letter 2/19/48 Director of CIA Hillenkoetter
wrote Director and referred to National Security Council Intelli-
gence Directive No. 7, 2/12/48. This Directive states in part that
-CiA wili be respous ible for expoitation on highly scloctive basis
~ within U.S, of business concerns, other nongovernmental organiza~
© tions and individuals as sources of foreign intelligence information.
Hillenkoetter commented that CIA had been interviewing foreign
pusinessmen, immigrants and refugees on small scale, always clearing
matter first with FBI office in area concerned. He asked Director's
views as to possible expansion of this activity.

By letter 2/26/48 Director replied to Hillenkoetter. In
part, this letter pointed out FBI had no objection to CIA inter-
viewing individuals enumerated above for foreign intelligence
“purposes; however, it was suggested that prior to interview such
individual matters be cleared with FBI Headquarters,

2. Bureau letter to CIA 1/16/64 confirmed results of meetings

between CIA and Bureau via liaison in discussing reorganization of
CIA's Domestic Operations Division (DOD). Letter recognized CIA
“néeds (recruitment of sources in U.S. who’may-be used abroad; - -.

. recruitment of diplomats, including UN xepresentatives, who might be

a. CIA would not conduct investigation of any foreign
official in U.S. and if CIA felt such investigation warranted, FBI
should be consulted,

: b. No foreign official would be approached for recruit~
ment by CIA without its conferring with FBI.

ce. When CIA agent arrives in U.S. for visit or assign-
ment, FBI will be advised and two agencies will confer regarding
handling of agent in this country, it being recognized each casa
‘has its individual peculiarities,

ad. Before approaching any foreign official or visitor for
recruitment assessment, CIA will clear with FBI.~

3. AS result of conference with CIA in January, 1966, the
above "ground rules" were modified and expanded and agreed upon by
both agencies early this year (Confirmed by letter to Admiral
Raborn 2/7/86), New ground rules in summary are as follows:

a. CIA will not intiate investigation of any foreign
official in U.S..without concurrence of FBI. (Comment: This is
essentially same as (a) in January, 1964, ground rules. Only
difference is that wording of this modification implies more
Sympathetic FBI attitude towards any proposed Ula investigations.)

CG : “bp. CIA will seek FBI concurrence before approaching for
if recruitment any foreign official or communist bloc visitor in U.S.
FBI will concur if CIA action does not conflict with any FBI
operations. (Comment: This is similar to (b) and (c) ground rules
- adopted in January, 1964, with two differences.’ First, it drops
requirement that ClAclear with us before approaching a non-Soviet
visitor although it must still do so with regard to non-Soviet
officiais. Secondly, it specifically commits the FBI to concur if
proposed CIA action does not conflict with FBI operations.)

.¢@. CIA will advise FBI prior to meetings between CIA --
assets and foreign officials or communist bloc visitors of interest -

ground rules.) t

individual peculiarities and governing principle will be positive
intelligence weighed against internal security factors. CIA may,
however, continue its contractual relationship for purpose of handling
training, procurement of positive foreign intelligence, (under-
lining added) fulrifinent of commitments to the agent and
. preparation for next assignment abroad. i

£. Where CIA will be handling its agent ,in U.S., CIA
will service FBI security or counterintelligence ‘requirements and
will provido FBI all information bearing on counterintelligence or
internal security matters. Where CIA servicing is inadequate for
FBI internal security interests, FBI will have direct access to
agent. (Comment: Rules (d), (e) and (Z) represent greatly expanded
‘and refined version of rule (c) of January, 1964, agreement. Qld
.ground rules provided considerable latitude with regard to who ‘.
would handle CIA source in the U.S. and this has led to some ce
disagreements with CIA. The current ground rules clearly provide
for CIA to retain contact with its agents not only for training,
financing,.etc., but also for "procurement of positive foreign
intelligence." In additioa, they make it clear ;that the FBI should
not ask for direct access unless phere: is a specific internal
security need.)

4. In addition to the above, there is one agreement we have
‘reached with CIA which is of possible relevance; nameiy, our recent
( ‘ " agreement relative to treatment of Soviet students in the U.S. od
By way of. background, there are a number of Soviet exchange students
currently attending various U.S. universities. Each’ student, of i
course, is not only a possible Soviet intelligence agent’ but also . . |
a@ potential source for the U.S. after he returns to his homeland. 4
Accordingly, both FBI and CIA have an interest in these students.
Per memo dated 1/14/64 we advised CIA via liaison on 1/20/64 ~ 3
“that the Bureau would adopt following procedure relative to Soviet
students here. FBI will take responsibility for collecting material
‘regarding each student on expedite basis, furnishing results to |
CIA as developed. At logical point FBI will confer with CIA to |
decide on case-by-case basis re possible recruitment. If Bureau

If EFFECT ON THE FBI OF FULL RESPONSIBILITY FOR COLLECTION
OF FOREIGN _INTECLIGENCE IN THE UONTTED STATE

1. Overt Collection Activities

It is evident from the National Security Act of

1947 and the succeeding National Security Council Intelligence
Directives as well as the directives of the Director of
Central Intelligence that Central Intelligence Agency (CIA)

is charged with major responsibilities in the overt collection
of foreign intelligence in the United States, In pursuit of
this, CIA exploits non~governmental organizations and :
individuals, foreign language publications and aliens, Although
CIA claims to have contacts with about 7,200 organizations -
and businesses as well as about 60,000 sources of information
‘as a vresult of its overt activities for this purpose, CIA
estimates it is reaching only 15 per cent of the foreign
intelligence information available in this country.

The question we must consider here is whether the
FBI should take over the overt collection of foreign intelligence
: in the United States, thereby maxing CIA operaticnal only in
C a “ areas outside the limits of FBI's jurisdiction. In this
~/ “connection, the following would have to be considered:

(a) Reporting: :

. The Bureau is a fact-finding agency which has
traditionally gathered evidence and presented its findings
without bias or conclusions. This would not change.
Intelligence developed by the FBI would be evaluated by the ; ‘|
users in the intelligence community. Our report writing i
, format might have to be geared to the needs and established
“ procedures of the United States intelligence community.

‘.(b) Coordination With Other Government Agencies: j

Foreign intelligence is a commodity produced for
thie nefit of many: separate. agencies-of-.the..United: States, .,
Government, Because of this, if the Bureau were to have
Lull. responsibility’ forthe overt collection’ of foreign:
.intelligence in this country, we would’ have to’greatly °
expand our liaison services, not only for dissemination
" purposes but to: assure that-we'are kept fully. informed

x

Our role in preparation of National Intelligence Estimates
would be more active as a result of our increased contribution
under this- program. It might be necessary to utilize the
assistance of highly trained personnel of other agoncies to
assist us poriodically on interviews dealing with complicated
military or scientific matters. | :
(c) Manpower: i cd
While no manpower requirements can be presently
estimated should we assume full responsibility for overt
foreign intelligence collection, CIA is currently using

approximately ~ employees throughout the United States to \
interview individuals in connection with its overt intelligence

gathering activities, and is reaching what it estimates to be
only 15 per cent of available foreign intelligence information.
These ¢ CIA employees do not include personnel required at
CIA Headquarters to correlate, evaluate and disseminate the
data gathered in the field. We would want to more efféctively
‘exploit this intelligence potential.

fo merely handle the necessary review of the vast

- number of foreign language publications would require many

additional employees proficient in foreign languages and
with backgrounds in scientific or technical fields.

(d) Selection and Training of Personnel:

To assume full responsibility for the overt
collection of foreign intelligence in this country, would
require that we vastly broaden our selection and training
procedures. We would require applicants with degrees in
the sciences, languages, history, government and economics.
Our basic training and In-Service agenda would have to be
geared to meet our new responsibilities. We would undoubtedly
desire to utilize the services of outstanding lecturers from
the agencies constituting our intelligence community, and in
turn, we would wish to afford our personnel training at the
War Colleges operated by the Department of Defense, and from °
time to time furnish them the opportunity of specialized
training and briefings provided by the members of the U. S.
Intelligence Board.

A

.(e). Legislation:

CIA currently has the duty to correlate and evaluate
intelligence relating to the national security and to provide
for appropriate dissemination, of such intelligence within the
Government. This is set out ‘in Title 50, USC, Section 40%.
The overt collection of foreign intolligence is not the subjoct
of legislation but rather of National Security Council Intelligence
Directives which would have to be revised in order to give the
Bureau this authority now todged with CIA. . \

(2) Organizational- Changes: Fl are

To carry out a program committing the Bureau to
the full responsibility for the overt collecting of foreign
intelligence in this country would necessitate a substantial
increase to the headquarters staffis of the Domestic Intelli-~
gence Division and the Laboratory Divison, as well to the.
personnel assigned to the New York and Washington Field Offices
where diplomatic establishments and international organizations
are mainly located. In all probability the creation of a new
division at the Seat of Government devoted entirely to overt

_ collection responsibilities, would be required.

(g) Observations: .
The many responsibilities that would be ours under

a@ program making the Bureau accountable for the overt collection

of all foreign intelligence in this country would (1) require

an enormous increase in our own personnel, trained in many

specialized fields, or (2) the delegation of varied intelligence

functions to other governmental 2 gencies and close supervision

_of such agencies to insure efficient execution of the tasks

NW 65360 _Docld:32989629 Page 254__.

levied upon them. These overt collection responsibilities

would undoubtedly be subject to the scrutiny of many sources,
some of them hostile, and we would have to face the charges,
unjust though they might be, that the Bureau had ceased to

perform the duties for which it was originally created and |
had developed into 2 gigantic bureaucratic octopus - Se AEEEEE To

Act ties

There are no statutory provisions for the clandestine

_ gathering of foreign intelligence in the United States. We
“have ‘inthe’ past produced: substantial. foreign intelligence .

while carrying out our present responsibilities.

: CYA established its Domestic Operations Division (DOD)
in 1963 and began to clandestinely gather foreign intolligence

in this country. It now has field offices with approximately
- 79 ~



7 : i
intelligence officers assigned to these matters. It is
antidpated that DOD's efforts will become more extensive,

CIA estimates there aro approximatoly 10,000 employees
and dependents assigned to the diplomatic establishments and
international organizations represented in this country by
approximately 120 foreign n: ons. It can readily be scon that
wo would have to establish priorities and well-defined objectives

_in order. to cope effectively with the problem presented by the
vast number of persors and establishments which could be
considered for clandestine coverage. 7

Today there are approximately 40 nations in addition
to the Soviet-bloc countries, whose establishments in this
country we consider "target" countries for the purpose of
} developing live sources therein. In the absence of more
| precise criteria, our initial efforts in a program designed
i to expand our clandestine gathering of foreign intelligence,

i . ould be directed against these "target" nations.

(a) Objectives:
‘Under a program confined to the clandestine gathering
(| ° of foreign intelligence in this country, and consistent with
c the intelligence needs of this «Government, we would have as_
our objectives: : ,

(1) Increasing substantially the number of live

(2) Expanding our present technical and microphone

coverage in such establishments. :

(b) Observations:

in manpower, both in the field and at the Bureau's headquarters,

as well as an expansion co. our personnel selection and training

would the increase be nearly as great as that which would be

‘ J. GENERAL FINDINGS : i

The study conducted by the Committee has
produced the following significant findings:

(1) There definitely is a-vast potential
for collection of foreign intelligence in:the U. S.
available through overt and clandestine channols.
Even with the available capabilities of existing
agencies, there is a large reservoir of untapped a
sources,

(2) CIA has been authorized by statute
-and implementing directives to collect foreign
intelligence in the U. S, through overt metheds and
has been involved in such collection since the
establishment of the Agency. This includes review
of foreign language press and interviews with
selected individuais such as American businessmen,

7 aliens, and students, In addition, CIA has established
an elaborate system of processing, Storing, evaluating, , . |
and disseminating this information. 2 -

s 7 (3) Such overt collection by CIA does not .
-/ _present any threat or infringement on FBI jurisdiction H
or operations, The prgsent Bureau controis for such/
CIA activity are satisfactory. 7

(4) We concluded that it would be highly
_undesirable for the Bureau to become responsible for
‘> +" overt collection of foreign intelligence in the U. S.
: ' The necessary reorganization, expansion of facilities
and manpower, and heavy task of information collection
and processing could place a damaging burden on th
Bureau, .

(5) There has never been.any statutory or

Similar provision for the clandestine development by
CIA of foreign intelligence in the United States,

S Ke RECOw {MENDED PLAN OF ACTION

A penetrative and objective study of the
Bureau's position has led us to conclude that the Bureau
should play a much more active and influential role in
the clandestine collection of positive intelligence in the
United States. We are recommending the implementation of
a plan which will lead to a valuable dontribution to our a '
national security effort and concurrently will improve our :
internal security capabilities, This plan presents a
concept of an FBI as an Agency primarily responsible \for
internal security, but supplementing its coverage with a
| r substantially expanded capability in the clandestine collec- z
i - tion of positive iatelligence, We believe that we have the a7
j “capability of developing this new look knowing ‘that at the
| same time we can institute a badly needed leadership to
eliminate a gap in the acquirement of high-quality intelli-
. gence in the United States, The main features of this plan 2
ares :

|

1) Establishment of a list of foreign diplomatic
targets consistent with the needs of the Government.

2) Expansion of our technical surveillance
capabilities with emphasis on misurs.

3) Expansion of live sources characterized with
. selectivity and high-quality value,

ot 4) The FBI assuming a role of leadership in the
' clandestine exploita” ion of positive intelligence in the
iu. S., and in so doing making maximum use of the talent and
capabilities of other appropriate U. 8, Agencies.

_ Authorization

The plan would be implemented under proper executive
authorization (Presidential) and furthermore would be coordi~
nated with the United States Intelligence Board (USIB). A-

_ letter from the President authorizing the Bureau to expand
its capabilities in clandestine positive intelligence collec-
tion, consistent with the needs of the government, would
suffice, in order to avoid any misunderstanding or confusion
within the intelligence community; USIB would be apprised of
the Presidential authorization. The letter from the President
would not require any details regarding the nature and the
scope of the action to be taken by the Bureau but could be

Selection of Targets

Priority on targets can be established by appli~
-cation of the following criteria:

fa 1d Review of requests or requirements levied on
us by the President and'U. S. intelligence Agencies,

2) Review of priority listed by the USIB. (This
is done on a regular basis. »

3) Gus own analysis and evaluation of international
political developments. This primarily will be done at SoG,

Technical Surveillance of Targets

Coverage in this field will be divided into the
following categories:

1) Technical Surveililances

2) Microphone Surveillances

3) More sophisticated electronic monitoring,
i.e. code machines.

At the present time we are handling a very limited
humber of installations. With existing capabilities, we
could virtually double our present technical coverage.

Once we have established reasonable priority listing} ‘it
is believed we should systematically expand our operations,
In this connection, the following should be borne in mind:

1) Heavy emphasis should be placed on microphone
surveillances,

2) Today we are placing greater stress on
coverage of official establishments. The new program asks
for an expansion of coverage on individuals and/or residences
of individuals, Here again selectivity will be a dominating
characteristic, i

3) The program should be so flexible that we
. would be able to deactivate any installation for security
reasons or for non-productivity and whenever possible enploy
techniques which would permit easy reactivation.

4) Except for current intelligence requiring
immediate dissemination, the product should be-handled as
communications intelligence and dissemination would be .
subjected to well-established Comint controls of the

_ National Security Agency (NSA) plus any additional restric-
, tions the Bureau felt should be imposed.

5) The product would be transmitted to NSA by us
for dissemination within the intelligence community. NSA
would be responsible for handling any needed translation.
We must recognize that the program will produce voluminous
information and the responsibility for processing the data
should be fixed with an agency which is organized and
equipped to handle the job. It is believed that if the
Bureau assumed this respons. 2ility we would be burdened: with
a gigantic task of information processing to the point that
this element would adversely aifect other phases of the
program. :

ne : producing the best results. In our opinion this’can be
- wenoved by the President's advising the Secretary of
State that the FBI is being authorized to develop
penetrations in foreign diplomatic establishments without
obtaining clearances from State. It would be understood
that the Bureau would proceed in a discreet and secure
peraanad Periodic contact with the Secretary of State or
ther top State officinis to discuss gonoral dovolopments
and any potential problems will provide a mechanism for
healthy coordination with State. We recognize that a
source can turn "sour" and, therefore, there is the danger
of potential embarrassment. However, it should be noted
fe i that our record in this regard has been outstanding over:
the years. :

Such efforts naturally fail in line with our internal

provide leads for development of sources in the positive
intelligence field. Every Soviet is not a member of KGB
ex GRU, but ho novortheless could offer information of
value, and he could be most useful on a long-range basis,

, Our program very definitely should have this philosophy
in mind, and it is an element which must be impressed
upon our personnel in owr training programs. In this
regard, we must recognize that at some point it may become
necessary to turn over recruited sources to another agency
such as CIA or one of the military services, Such turnover
will, of course, depend on the circumstances, The guiding
principle should be the preservation of the source under
the best security.

an priority needs of the Government.

‘Training of Personnel
At the present time, our personnel are not properly-

oriented to effectively engage in a program as recommended.
To accommodate to a new approach, it will be necessary to:

. 1) Inelude in our training classes lectures which
will cover a more detailed picture of U. S. intelligence, its
history, definition of terms, functions of intelligence
agencies,

; 2) Include lectures regarding the foreign intel~
cree tatitad needs of the U. S. Government.

3) Use outstanding officials of other agencies to
lecture on special intelligence matters. This would include
the critical areas throughout the Actes

“ay Disseminate a ‘balietin to ‘the field” on a
regular‘basis to, emphasize foreign peahaitatain eric needs as,
they relate to our capabilities.

8) Expand the training of Agents in the handling
of technical surveillance installations,

_ Reporting Procedures

This program will not require any basic departure
from our present reporting procedures. The Bureau should
not become involved in evaluating, estimating, ete. We
should endeavor to adhere to our traditional position of
reporting the facts as collected. We may wish to give

: consideration to adding one feature to our regular reporting

= on individuals. This could be an annex for "Personality

I Data." The objective would be to maintain an up-to-date
book on everything collected relating to the subject's
character, habits, family lite, interests, weaknesses, etc.

An expanded program for collection of foreign
intelligence would require increased capability to handle
foreign languages, As explained above, the material
collected through technical surveillances should be handled
gs communications intelligence, and the major translating
responsibility would, therefore, be placed on NSA.

We do, however, recognize that it is necessary to
maintain a strong foreign language capability in the field
wherever it may be useful to develop live sources. In
offices such as New ork City and Washington, D. C., we
should expand the number of Agents who are fluent in French,
Russian, Polish, Czech, German, Chinese, and Spanish. An
office which is’ well equipped with a capability in the
foregoing is generally able to handle most situations which
arise, :

If this program is adopted, other intelligence
agencies would be officially apprised of the Presidential
authority granted to the FBI to collect foreign intelligence
in the United States. Other agencies would be informed
rogarding the nature and tho extent of the authority boing
delegated to the Bureau. It would be necessary to make
clear that the Bureau was not assuming responsibility for
the clandestine collection of all foreign intelligence in
the United States, but we were taking a constructive step
in an effort to increase the production of foreign intel-
ligence through assets available to us, We would clearly
point out that the FBI was not taking this approach as a
solution to all of the problems relating to foreign intel-
ligence collection’ in this country. We would emphasize
that we would move against targets in line with established
priorities and that we would do so on a selective basis.

We would have it understood that operational activities
would be properly coordinated wherever it was obviously
necessary. :

With regard to the handling of the product of
technical surveiliances, it would be necessary to effect a
working agreement with NSA, To do this we might be obliged
to discuss this at the USIB level so that NSA could obtain
the required authority to support the hiring of additional
personnel and purchase of equipment for the processing of
our product, Our arrangement with NSA would include ground
‘rules for processing, translation, and classification ‘and
dissemination,

7

Since any announcement that we were in the foreign
intelligence field would prompt unusual interest and very
- likely queries, we should brie? CIA regarding the objectives
of our program, Our plan will not abrogate the existing
ground rules which permit CIA to assess and recruit positive
intelligence sources in this country under certain conditions.
Since both Agencies will have.foreign intelligence sources
in the U.S., we undoubtedly will find it useful to work out
‘an agreement whcreby one Agency knows that the other has
coverage in a particular area or establishment. We already
receive the identities. of CIA sources. It would not be
necessary for us to identify our sources, but we could. ©
indicate to CIA.that.we.had an asset, in a particular, are:

~ 95 =

“NW.65360_Docld:37989629 -Page 267...



y

This would permit CIA to levy roquirenonts on -
us, For example, if we recruited the Third Secretary

of the French Embassy, CIA might wish to ask any number

of questions dealing with the French political situation,
1£ wo Folt that the request was reasonable, we could
handle this through our source.

It will be noted that the program doos not
preclude CIA from development of foreign intelligence
souxces in the U, S, for fulfillment of CIA responsibilities,
CIA will continue to operate under existing ground rules
which are designed to protect Bureau interests.

We believe that if the program is implemented
and jells we will be in a position to “spot” sources
required by CIA and other agencies to discharge their
responsibilities. This would apply to cases where the
target was in the-U. S. for a visit or if he had some
specialized knowledge not related to our internal security
responsibilities, These would be targets which other
agencies could handle without interfering with our operations
and without making us carry a load for another agency.:
This particular concept should include a Bureau attitude
that any and every source handied by another agency in the
U. S. potentially ca.. be useful to us, We should have an
outlook that all sources should be exploited to the fullest
extent and under secure conditions, If another agency has
a capability to open a door we should take advantage of the
situation.:

In those instances where CIA has a source in the
United States, we should prod that agency to seek information
of interest to the Bureau, and where obviously necessary we
should arrange access to the CIA source. The important
feature of this new cozcept is.that we assume the role of
projecting initiative, leadership and aggressiveness. Our
position should be such that we push the other agencies to -
use their resources even to the point of healthy irritation.

We have looked at CIA as the “other agency" in
this picture, but we should not neglect.the potential of
agencies such as ACSI, Air Force, ONI and State,: All of
them have entree to diplomatic circles. The day~to-day
contacts which officials of these agencies have with
personnel of foreign governments produce many "pieces" of
‘personality | data which, when added up over a period of ‘time,

@ :

can prove to be extremely useful, We should contol with

~, these agencies regarding ways and means of recruiting
sources either to be handled by us jointly or by one of
the intelligence agencies, Here again, the Bureau can
be the dominant and pushing source,

It is believed that if we moved along the lines
described above, the Bureau, over a period of time, would
have collected valuable information regarding numerous
personalities and the inner workings of the many diplomatic

. establishments, The acquirement of data of this type
creates operational strength. it places us in a position
to exploit the development of new sources, bearing in mind
that in planning our aporoaches we will be equipped with,
ammunition not gained through casual surveillances and
observations. With the knowledge that we gain, we can |.
plan high quality operations, It is interesting to note
that during the past two years the information received
from CIA's sources in the United States has been fairly
voluminous and very definitely valuable. It is a good
illustration of the Bureau's gaining useful data from
| another agency with a minimum of Bureau expense and effort,
: but still maintaiaing very effective control of our juris-"

dictional rights.

Undoubtedly related to the utilization of other
agencies’ resources is’ the considerably vast potential
‘ : offered by friendly foreign security services, If the
i i services of Great Britain, Germeny, France, Holland, Italy,
Australia and Canada provided us information collected in
Washington, D. C. and New York resulting from contacts with
| ‘communist-bloc officials, we would have another valuable
i source of informetion. We should bear in mind that we do
| spend hundreds and thousands of man-hours seeking such
information through other difficult channels.

We should utilize the friendly liaison services
along the lines described above. . : .

\ out of the question, We definitely would require’ =

would be necessary to have ficlid pergonnellassigned to

It is outside the scope of this Committee's .
“competency to outline any specific administrative re-
organization and propose what personnel, equipment and
facilities would be needed. We feel that this could be
best handled only after the objectives of the program are
‘approved, At that point, officials from the Seat of
Government and the field could meet to map out the necessary
reorganizatioa, The extent of reorganization will hinge on
our decision as to the pace we shouid set. We recommend
that we proceed at a steady, even pace, making certain that
we lay solid groundwork for all of our activity. We should

In connection with any planning for reorganization,
it would be unwise to proceed without first obtaining a
reliable inventory of our current resources, Such an
inventory would encompass the following: (1) The number
of Agents currently assigned to strictly positive intei-
ligence collection; (2) Our foreign language capabilities;
(3) Our current sources. and informants with an objective
assessment of capabilities; (4) Number of supervisors at
the Seat of Government currently handling positive intel

L. ALTERNATIVES VES

In addition to the recommended plan set forth in
preceeding sections, there are several alternative courses
of action we might take: 7 7

1. We could take the position, and seek ways to implement
it, that the entire field of foreign intelligence collection
in the U. S., both overt and covert, should be handled by
tho PBI. Such an across-the-board approach would exclude
CIA and other U. S, agencies from foreign intelligence
collection in this country and would place exclusive
responsibility and jurisdiction in this field on the FBI.

As indicated in Section I, this would require a revamping

of existing legislation and careceives. and would necessitate
drastic changes in the Bureau's operations, including major
increases’.in personnel and costs and a substantial expansion
in our recruitment and training programs, and other reorganiza~
tion. We do not feel this approach is warranted nor do. we
believe it would be a practical and sound one.

- 2, We could recommend that CIA continue to be
responsible for overt collection of foreign intelligence in
this country but that the FBI exclusively handle covert
‘foxeign intclligonce collection. This has several obvious
avrawbacks., First, we would be assuming a wide range of
heavy and fixed responsibilities which in many cases would
be completely divorced from the Bureau's internal security
and counterintelligence interests Second, we would become
to a large extent a service group “tor other U. S. agencies
and departments (including CiA, State, the military and others)
in the handling of a host of foreign intelligence requirements
‘levied by other agencies. This would involve a considerable
commitment of manpower, communication costs, etc. on the part .
of the Bureau. In addition, such an approach would necessitate
significant changes in our recruitment and training procedures
and would also place on our shoulders a definite accountability
-in connection with any failures in U. S. intelligence foreign
‘collection. It is not !elieved that this approach is.as sound
or desirable as our recommended plan of action; namely,’ that
we expand our foreign intelligence collection efforts but on

. .a.selective. basis. and without,.our assuming full responsibility.

outside the FBI, possibly including individuais who are

not sympathetic to our views. We would not be in a position

to maintain control of developments.

PURPOSE AND SCOPE

The purpose of this study is to define

‘a new role for the Bureau in the field of clandestine
collection of foroign intelligonce in the U. 8.

This action is necessary and most timely because

_of our Government's vital need for increased foreign
intelligence and because of CIA's expanding interests
in the United States. There is a decided need for

a@ new Bureau concept, the implementation of which :
‘ could greatly increase our effectiveness and could deter
.CIA from becoming a threat to our operational interests, |

7” The study encompasses a review of history
as it relates to foreign intelligence collection in
the U. S. Analysis is made of the need and the
potential for such intelligence; the capabilities of
. the Bureau and CIA in this field; and the responsibilities ”
. of over-all (overt and covert). collection of foreign .
_ intelligence in the U. 8. We have submitted our general
findings, and we recommend a plan of action for a new
Bureau role. :

. This study was not designed to eliminate once
_and for all the many problems relating to collection
of foreign intelligence in the U. 8S. It would have been’ ”
a Utopian objective to recommend a plan which would a
produce maximum intelligence collection, remove existing . -
defects within the U. S, intelligence community, and
establish complete harmony among interested agencies, :
_We did not go that far, Careful and exhaustive analysis
@ictated that we endeavor to reach a reasonable goal
consistent with prudent planning and sound operational

. implementation, We feel that the recommended plan

_ meets such guidelines, that it is a decidedly major step
‘forward for the Bureau, and it strongly conforms with
the national security needs,

not deal with our law enforcement or internal security
functions, although it is fully recognized that

B, INTELLIGENCE TERMINOLOGY

People who do not speak and understand a common

. language have difficulty in communicating their ideas, Even
in a country such as ours where English is the common language,’
words take on different meanings in different geographical
locales and in different social, political, and economic
environments, Likewise, in professional fields, varying

_ backgrounds and experiences have conveyed different meanings
to terms in the professional vocabulary.

In the field of security, intelligence, and counter~
. intelligence operations, certain professional terminology has
developed ostensibly to assist in the exchange of ideas by
pues persons in this field. However, as progress is made in a
.. field or a special segment of the field, new horizons develop
which require additional terminology or cause an evolution in
existing terminology. This development or evolution in security
_and intelligence terminology, coupled with individualistic usage,
brings further problems in meaning which we also face in the
broader aspects of the English language. We have all noted
that our dictionaries do not always provide a single meaning
and we must be careful in daily conversation that we are not
misunderstood when merely using a conversational vocabulary.
We face a similur problem in the use-ef professional terminole
-ogy in security and intelligence matters as this terminology
takes on new meaning with additional experience and takes on
varying meanings to different persons, :

Oo

= An additional factor to consider in understanding

". the meaning of terminology is the context in which a term is
used, For example, the term "intelligence" may be vague and
~ confusing without the knowledge of the context in which it is
used, It can, as a generic term, pertain to the whole field
‘of activities undertaken by a government in the collection of
information, the protection of its institutions, and the con=
duct of nonattributable activities to facilitate the formation
and implementation of government policy. Also, it can relate
, to the organization devoted to the collection and production
“ of information necessary to the government, In addition, ~
it may pertain to the whole body of theory and practice on
the basis of which an intelligence organization operates,
Finally, the word "intelligence" may hid utilized to mean

any part or all of the above.

. The following definitions do not include all possible
meanings that have been utilized but, instead, are designed ,
to assist the bchctabahead in Gigesting this plaea he

C, THE HISTORY OF FOREIGN INTELLIGENCE COLLECTION IN THE
OD TE

1, . Prior to World War If . |

A study of the history and progress of foreign
intelligence collection in the United States reveals that

“prior to World War II such collection efforts were incidental

and in direct proportion to the intensity of the coverage
maintained in the counterintelligence field, Accordingly,
the history of foreign intelligence collection in the

' United States prior to World War II is primarily a history of

counterintelligence and internal security coverage, of which
foreign intelligence was a by-product, Historical highlights

- of the developments in this field are as follows:

(a) In August, 1914, when German espionage agents
Count Johann Von Bernstorff and Dr, Heinrich Albert of the

‘German Embassy, Washington, D. C., arrived in the
* United.States with $159,900,0N0 in German treasury notes to

finance the first foreign espionage and sabotage apparatus

to be organized in this country, United States Government
intelligence work was handled for the most part by five
small organizations (Bureau of Investigation of the
Department of Justice, Secret Service, Army, State and Navy),
all operating on their own with small staffs and without
coordination and sufficient delineation of responsibilities.

(b) On April 6, 1917, Congress declared war against
“ Germany and President Woodrow Wilson, gave the Bureau of

Investigation the task of enforcing his proclamation

governing the conduct of enemy aliens, The Bureau at the time

had 300 Agents but shortly after the outbreak of the war

(c) As result of a rash of bombings believed
executed by Bolsheviks, Attorney General Palmer appointed
Francis P, Garvan of New York as Assistant Attorney General

- to deal with the problem. He created a General Intelligence

Division under command of J, Edgar Hoover and Mr. Hoover was
instructed to make a study of subversive activities in the
United States to determine their scope-and the potential
_for prosecution,



@ i e
,

(d) On May 9, 1934, President Roosevelt called
a White House conference attended by the Attorney General,
Secretary of Treasury, Secretary of Labor, Director of FBI
and Chief of United States Secret Service to deal with
the problem of growth of fascist organizations in the
United States, The conference agreed that there should be
an investigation of these groups and their activities for
intelligence purposes, Since the only Federal law believed
applicable at the time was the Immigration Law, the President
decided that the Commissioner of Immigration and Naturalization
Service would confer with the Chief of Secret Service and the
Director of the FBI to work out details of the investigation.:,

! aeeeU Nr. Hoover immediately issued orders to FBI
personnel to conduct an intensive and confidential“investi«
gation of the Nazi movement. This was the first general
Loos + intelligence investigation made by the Government into
Te : fascist activities in this country,

/
(e) As a result of President Franklin Roosevelt's

concern over activities of the communists and other subversive

- groups, a serics of confere Ss was held in the Intter part
of August and early September, 1936, participated in by the
President, the Secretary of State and the Director of thé FBI. °
As a result of his concern over the international character
of communism and fascism, the President stated the FBI should

e 7 conduct necessary investigations and coordinate information

2 matters in the possession of the Military

‘sence Division, the Naval intelligence Division and

'. the State Department,

It is noteworthy that it was specified the
investigation was to be for intelligence purposes only.

The Presidential Order was implemented by the
Director in a letter to all Special Agents in Charge,
September 5, 1936,

(f) ‘As a résult of opposition primarily by the
- State Department, against accepting the FBI as the coordinating
agency in the investigations of all subversive activities in
the United States, President Roosevelt, on June 26, 1939, issued
a confidential directive to Cabinet members which established an
Interdepartmental Intelligence Coordinating Committee composed
of the FBI and the Intelligence Divisions of the War Department
and the Navy. He named the FBI as the coordinating agency to
receive all reports on subversive activities,

(g) President Roosevelt publicly designated the FBI
to investigate matters relating to espionage, sabotage and

‘violations of the neutrality regulations by Presidential

Directive dated September 6, 1939,

(h) On May 21, 1940, President Roosevelt in a
memorandum to the then Attorney General, Robert H. Jackson,

_ authorized and directed the Attorney General in such cases as

he might approve to authorize the use of listening devices
directed to the conversations or other communications of
persons suspected of subversive activity against the Government
of the United States, including suspected spies.

Pursuant to such authorization, commencing on June 1,
1940, technical surveillances were installed on diplomatic
establishments throughout the United States of such countries
as Germany, Italy, Japan, Russia and France. These
installations in addition to providing counterintelligence
information of value produced a substantial quantity of foreign
intelligence information.

(i) Although lines of responsibility were established
for domestic intelligence work in connection with the September 6,
1939, Presidential Directive, there were no clearly defined areas
of responsibility of overseas intelligence operations and as

time passed the need for decisions in that field grew more evident.

As a result, the Special Intelligence Service (SIS)

“eame into being. By Presidential Directive June 24, 1940,

President Franklin D, Roosevelt set forth lines of responsibility
in the operations of United States intelligence agencies in the
foreign field, This Directive grew out of a series of meetings
involving representatives of State Department, Army and Navy
intelligence and the FBI wherein it was agreed that the SIS would
act as a service agency, furnishing the State Department, the
military, the FBI and other governmental agencies with information
having to do with financial, economic, political and subversive

. activities detrimental to the security of the United States, The

dune 24th Directive’ placed the responsibility for nonmilitary
intelligence coverage in the Western Hemisphere on the FBI, Less
than thirty days thereafter the FBI had organized an SIS operation,

Through World War IY and until approximately March 31,
1947, the FBI continued its SIS operations, The culmination of
our activities in this field came about as a result of the
January 22, 1946, Presidential Directive establishing the
Central Intelligence Group and giving it the responsibility of
collecting foreign intelligence abroad,

'2, During World War II (1941 ~ 1945)

: i
a. The FBI's Role : :

During World War II, as prior to thé war, foreign
intelligence collection in this country was geared to and
principally a product of our intensive efforts in the counters
intelligence field, It is also significant to note that a
steady stream of foreign intelligence continued to be developed
from our technical coverage of diplomatic establishments of
enemy-bloc countries, as well as other sensitive countries
such as Russia, Argentina, Portugal and Spain,

In line with the Presidential Directive of
September 6, 1939, the FBI continued to be’in charge of all
investigative work in matters pertaining to espionage, sabotage,
counterespionage, subversive activities and violations of the
neutrality laws.

On January 8, 1943, the President issued another
Directive in which he reiterated tne previous Directive uf
September 6, 1939.

In ordering the FBI to take charge in the foregoing
areas, President Roosevelt did not define the various types of

.. intelligence involved but placed the entire intelligence and

internal security responsibilities involved under the

‘jurisdiction of the FBI, As a matter of fact, in carrying out

these responsibilities we did produce foreign intelligence in
substantial quantity especially through our technical coverage

of foreign diplomatic establishments.

b. Office of Strategic Services &

The position of Colonel William J, Donovan as
Coordinator of Information (COI) was created by Presidential
Directive dated July 11, 1941, On July 14, 1941, President

. Roosevelt sent a letter to the Attorney General stating the

position was created, "in order to provide a central point in

“the Government for the analysis of information and data which

bears upon national security. . .." The President described
Donovan's duties as “assist me and the various Departments and
agencies of the Government in assembling and correlating
information which may be useful in the formulation of basic’
plans for the defense of the nation," ~

Jo Jf * wane

~~



@ : e

: In the letter President Roosevelt clearly limited

* Donovants jurisdiction with the following statement: "TI
should like to emphasize that Colonel Donovan's work is not

_ imtended to supersede or duplicate or involve any direction
.of the activities of established agencies already obtaining
and interpreting defense information."

The Presidential order dated September 11, 1941,

established the position of COI with clear cut authority to
* collect and analyze information bearing on national security;

corréiate and make such information available to the President
and Other Government officials as the President may determine.
COI was finally authorized to carry out, when requested by
the President, supplementary activities aS might facilitate
the securing Of information not then available to the
Government. .

Donovan, in a memorandum captioned "MEMORANDUM OF
-ESTABLISHMENT OF SERVICE OF STRATEGIC INFORMATION," expanded
on the President's directive in general terms. Under his
plan for procedure there was a Coordinator of Strategic
Aintormation responsible directly to the President. (Note
: this same organizational set up was later adopted by the
t. Director of Central Intelligence.) Donovan noted, however,
a in his memorandum, "The proposed centralized unit will
neither displace nor encroach upoa the FBI, Army and Navy
Intelligence, or any other Department of the Government."
662-64427, s serials 23 and X3.)

Our file on the Office of Strategic Services (OSS)
reveals that that organization continued its organizational,
training, and operational activities in this country based
on Donovan's premise that he was the central clearing point
for anti-Axis espionage and counterespionage. An interesting

_ insight into OSS operations in this country is provided in
the nonfiction work "The Scarlet Thread" by former OSS agent
Donald Downes. Downes noted that he was a former British
intelligence agent serving for that organization in New York
when he was recruited. by OSS immediately after Pearl Harbor. aa
Hé télls of his recruitment by Allan Dulies, his association - aes
with Donovan, and his’ work in the counterespionage field in
New York City and Washington, D. C., with other OSS agents,

. including the current United States Ambassador to the
United Nations, Arthur Goldberg. Downes detailed attempts
by him inl other OSS agents to steal itu ciate codes from

’ State Department officials. The conversation dealt with OSS

. with one of the State Department officials, Aura Warren,

’ to this attempt of OSS to take over our duties, the Director

"friendly" or "neutral" country embassies in Washington in

the early 1940's and frequently referred to the fact that

this was being done by OSS with knowledge that its juris-
diction in this country was based only on the theory that

a foreign Embassy is not American soil and is technically .
outside the jurisdiction of the FBI, which had full juris~
diction for counterintelligence in the western hemisphere.

Our file on the OSS is replete with incidents
indicating OSS recruitment and counterespionage activities
in this country during the early 1940's.

By memorandum dated May 22, 1945, Stanley J. Tracey,
advised of a conversation overheard between two high-ranking

attempts to take over Bureau SIS operations in Latin America

stating that officials of OSS felt that organization was
-better equipped to handle work than FBI personnel attached
to various American Embassies in South America. In response

commented: "Z would like to know where Warren gevc this.
According to-Ladd our contacts in State Department have no
knowledge of such OSS efforts. Also Tracey should point
out it is State Department duty to initiate it as we would
‘service it' and the State Department in fact started the
SIS project. H" (62-64427-1059.)

An interesting evaluation of OSS operations is
‘provided in a report prepared by Colonel Richard Park of
the War Department as a result of a survey of OSS operations
made as a special and confidential mission for the President
in 1944 and 1945, Colonel Park commented: "Without going
into details I was everywhere left with the same impression
of utter incompetency on the part of OSS leadership....

"Everywhere that the subject of OSS.came up,
unsolicited remarks clearly brought out the very well known
amateurish nature of the organization,

"The OSS has been restricted from active operations
in South America by Presidential directive...."

Despite the absence of any jusisdiction in or

responsibility for counterintelligence operations in the
western hemisphere, an ptficer of OSS was reported to have

@ @

attempted to obtain cover. for an OSS agent in south America
under guise of employment by an organization doing business .
in South America.
A closing paragraph of Colonel Park's report
commented on observations made by an official of OSS as
follows:

"This official of OSS added that it was the policy
“of his agency not to give any more information than necessary
to the Federal Bureau of Investigation. He pointed out that
OSS instructors in ‘their school in the United States had
discussed the FBI in an unfavorable light and had painted
- the picture of OSS replacing the Federal Bureau of
: Investigation not only outside the United States but in
: . the domestic field. The publicity campaign referred to
was to be one of the means adopted ” to cee this
purpose." - .

83. National Intelligence Authority (NIA) |

On January 22,.1946, President Harry 5S. Truman
addressed a Directive to the Secretary of State, the Secretary
of War, and the Secretary of the Navy stating, in part, "I
hereby designate you, together with another person to be named
by me as my personal vepresentative, as the National Yntelli-
gence Authority. . ." The Directive provided that each of these
three Secretaries would from time to time assign personnel and
facilities from their respective departments "which persons

: shall collectively form a Central Intelligence Group" (CIG)
under a Director of Central Intelligence. It was provided that
the latter would be responsible to the NIA.

President Truman then stated that subject to the
existing law the Director of Central Intelligence should
. (a) accomplish the corre’ation and evaluation of intelligence
< and the appropriate dissemination within the Government of the
results; (b) plan for the coordination of such activities of
the intelligence agencies of the three departments involved as
Xelatca te the national security; (c) nerform such services of
ESHEEEEEE common concern as the NIA determined could be more effectively
a accomplished centrally; and (d) perform such other functions
a - and duties related to intelligence as the President and the
NIA might from time to time direct.

The Presidential Directive said that no police, law
_enforcement or internal security functions should be exercised
under the Directive; that certain intelligence should be freely
available to the Director of Central Intelligence "for correlation,
evaluation or dissemination"; and that "the existing intelligence
agencies of your departments shall continue to collect, evaluate,
correlate and disseminate departmental intelligence." The ninth
provision of the Directive stated, "Nothing herein shall be

_ construed to authorize the making of investigations inside the
continental limits of the United States and its possessions,
except as provided by law and Presidential directives."

A- series 0£.communications. between. the Bureau, and ;.
Lieutenant General Hoyt S. Vandenberg; who was designated as
.Director..of .the..Central Intelligence Group, then followed. On
- “June 21, 1946, a memorandum analyzed a comminication from '’~
|. sau «¢)-Mandenberg which submitted. a proposed memorandum to the NIA and:

a proposed Directive to be issued by NIA extending ‘the powers) 7" "|
. ..+ and duties of the Director of Central Intelligence. The Directive
i provided, in essence, the following additional functions and

powers for the Director of Central intelligence:

: = i a -1- i 7

4 ich i
| HUY E5360 DoTraszgeIeTT Page WT



(1) Undertake such basic research and analysis of .
‘intelligence and counterintelligence as may in his opinion be
required,

(2) Act as the executive ‘agent of this authority
aaa “ovra) in coordinating and in supervising all Federal foreign
/ intelligence activities.

(3) Perform the following services of common concern:
(a) conduct all Federal espionage and counterespionage operations
{ . for the collection of foreign intelligence; (b) conduct all
Federal monitoring of press and propaganda broadcasts of foreign
powers for the collection of intelligence information.

| in discussing this Directive which Vandenberg desired
| issued, the memorandum stated the Directive did not conform
with the original plan proposed by the President or which was
envisioned by the discussions occurring prior to the time the
President issued his Directive. The original plan, insofar as
the Bureau was advised, contemplated the setting up of solely
a coordinating agency which was given the power to perform certain
functions which it would be determined could more adequately and
economically be verformed centrally for the benefit of all
: Government agencies. The memorandum noted that “undoubtedly if
Ss this Directive is approved and the Central Intelligence Group
a . is successful in setting up complete foreign coverage, the
SoC e Bureau would undoubtedly be pushed into a ‘second rate' position
insofar as purely intelligence functions are concerned in the
domestic field. . . It is inevitable that the Central Intelli-~
gence Group must enter into the domestic field picture insofar
_ as intelligence is concerned because of the sources of foreign
intelligence existing in that field. Also, it is impossible To
separate entirely foreign intelligence and the domestic functions
performed by the Bureau.'"*

‘ In reply to the Directive proposed by General Vandenberg,
a letter was sent to him June 25, 1946, which stated that the
Directive was approved with certain changes suggested "for
clarification purposes only." The Director suggested that to

the item relating | stad the Director of Central intelligence acting

% with’ respect to this last quoted statement, Mr. E. A. Tamm and

memorandum, The Director's comments were set forth. This is”

more fully reported below under the heading, “Director's Comments."

as the executive agent of National Intelligence Authority
an coordinating and supervising all foreign intelligence
activities there should be added "performed outside the
United States and its possessions relating to the national
security in accordance with the overall policies and objectives
established by this Authority." With respect to the proposal
that the Director of Central Intelligence direct all espionage
and counterespionage operations for the collection of foreign
intelligence, it was proposed that the phrase "outside the
United States and its possessions" also be inserted in this
provision, :

x

On July 29, 1946, General Vandenberg sent over
a memorandum on the subject “Exploitation of American
Business Concerns With Connections Abroad as Sources of
Foreign Intelligence Information." He added a proposed
Directive, The Director replied by letter August 6, 1946,
"I should like to comment that there appears to have been
an addition to the field encompassed by CIG Directive #11
calling for a survey of the exploitation of American business
concerns. I note that in your report and in the proposed
NIA Directive, you refer not only to American business con=
cerns but to other private groups with connections abroad.
This latter phrase, in my opinion, is extremely broad and
could be taken to include all types of organizations,
including Foreign Nationality Groups. In fact, i feel that
the report and proposed Directive should confine themselves to

‘the discussion of American business concerns and that no

references at all should be made to ‘private groups’. .

-I feel that at a later date the question of exploitation of

these private groups by CIG representatives might be worked
out by discussing them individually with the FBI when their

identities are determined." This matter remained unresolved. ~

On August 22, 1946, General Vandenberg submitted
another proposed Directive concerning exploitation of American
business concerns, nongovernmental groups, and individuals (in

“the United’ States) with ‘connections abroad-as ‘sources.of.foreign --
‘intelligence information. A memorandum analyzing this on
’. August 22, 1946,.pointed out the new Directive was even more



e : e

obnoxious than the one originally proposed. The eee
noted, in part, "CIG field representatives will establish
and maintain liaison with the intelligence officers of local
Army and Navy headquarters and Air. Force headquarters, if
present, through the medium of local interagency offices."
i The analyzing memorandum ~ointed out, "If this means the
a - CIG is going to maintain field representatives in the United
: States or establish offices, it cortainly is something new and
a provision that we did not understand was intended in the
President's Directive. . . Attached to the proposed Directive
is a discussion which is more or less the same as was attached
to the original proposed Directive. It, however, makes the
following statement which the Bureau cannot subscribe to and
it would seem must oppose, that is, ‘Foreign Intelligence
| , . Information related to the national security, although it may
seeeet be collected from sources whose headquarters are within the
_ limits of the United States and its possessions, is definitely
- a part of the national intelligence mission, the coordination
~ of which is specifically a function of the National intelli-
gence Authority under the provisions of the President *s letter
of 22 January 1946, iis

In pointing out the Bureau's objections, ‘the
analyzing memorandum of August 22, 1946, stated, "There
is now involved in this Directive the fundamental question
_ of just what rights the Central Intelligence Group has with
reference to operations within the United States, Carrying
to a logical conclusion the statements set forth above contained
in the discussion, they could cover all foreign embassies in
“, the United States, take charge of double agents we are operating
: or radio stations we are operating as double agent set-ups, etc.,
| ie because essentially these operations engaged in by the Bureau
7 do not directly involve enforcement of the laws but rather are
: concerned with obtaining information in the nature of foreign
intelligence which, of course, is related to internal security
as is all foreign intelligence. Essentially, the Bureau's
domestic operations in intelligence involve the determining
of the aims, intentions, and activities of foreign countries
or: their. representatives." oe. 5 z

; The memorandum of analysis stated.that ‘dur ‘position |
' would be the Bureau would not consent to any provisions except
7 those. relatad’to American ‘businoss concerns with-connections ..

abroad, On August 23, 1946, the Director sent a letter to
General Vandenberg stating in part, "I must advise that the
proposed Directive does not incorporate the changes suggested
in my letter of August 6, 1946, and I, therefore, cannot
approve it. This new directive also includes provisions

and statements in which I cannot concur and, in fact, must
oppose."

The strong stand of the Director obviously led to
a conference between General Vandenberg and the Director

‘which was. reported in a memorandum of September 13, 1946,
which the Director prepared. As stated in the Director's
memorandum the conference concerned CiIG's desire to gather
contacts among "nongovernmental groups and individuals with
connections abroad."' The entire conference was on this subject
matter and did not enter into collection of foreign intelli-
gence from foreign embassies or from foreign officials or,
in fact, from any other source. The Director wrote, "I told
the General that I could well appreciate that there would be
cases in which his organiuation would be desirous of making
‘contacts in the United States for the purpose of obtaining
information from abroad :nd that the Bureau was not interested
in such contacts except in those situations wherein the individual
or the group might be engaged in activities within the United

. States that were either under investigation by the Bureau or
might possibly be the medium of obtaining information con-

» Gerning the activities of a subversive character being carried
‘on within the United States. I told the General that I would
be perfectly agreeable to his suggestion, with the added
provision that if CIG was desirous of contacting any

_ individuals of the character that he had indicated, before

doing so it would check with the FBI."

The foregoing has been set forth rather extensively

-" gance it shows the strong stand the Bureau took against CIG's

operating in the United States. Actually, as will be reported
' hereinafter, .Directives were adopted permitting CiG to collect
positive intelligence in this country by “contacting: United --2%-*
. States citizens, American businessmen, aliens (with prior
FBI approval) through’ the foreign language press. and in later
years through contacts with United States governmental personnel.

4. Responsibilities of CIA
a. The National Security Act of 1947

,

This Act, which is reported in 50 USC 401 et seq.,
established the National Security Council (NSC) and under it
the Central Intelligence Agency. it provided that when the
Director of Central Intelligence was appointed the NIA should |

cease to exist.

: There was much discussion concerning the powers and
authorities to be vested in the Director of Central Intelli-
gence. Many individuals, especially in Congress, expressed

: fears that CIA could develop into a gestapo if permitted to
become operational in the United States. The following two
excerpts, of interest in this connection, are from a
Congressional publication related to hearings prior to passage
of the National Security Act of 1947. The publication is

‘= entitled "Hearings Before the Committee on Expenditures in the

*, Executive Departments, House of Representatives, 80th Congress,

capes Session on H. R, 2319 (National Security Act of 1947)";

Page 127 - During testimony concerning authority for
‘and scope of CIA, James Forrestal, then Secretary of the Navy,

“ stated:

"The purposesof the Central Intelligence Authority
i : are limited definitely to purposes outside of this
Je see country, except the collation of information gathered
i by other government agencies.

: : “Regarding domestic operations, the Federal Bureau
of Investigation is working at all times in collaboration
: : with General Vandenberg. He relies upon them for domestic
| pace " activities."
Page 438 - Congressman Clarence J..Brown of Ohio in
speaking about the National Security Act of 1947, which was
under scrutiny before passage, stated:

"y want to write a lot of other safeguards into the
section that deals with, the Central Intelligence Agency.

NW 65360 Docid:32989629 Page 298


"Y want to make certain that the activities and the -
functions of the Central Intelligence Agency were care~
fully confined to international matters, to military
matters, and to matters of national security. We have
enough people now xvunning around butting into avarybody
else's business in this country without establishing
another agency to do so..-

What we ought to do is to eliminate 90 percent of
the present snoopers instead of adding to them.

‘

"Y do not think it would be the Central Intelligence
Agency's right, authority, or responsibility to check on
the ordinary domestic activities of the average American
citizen, and yet they could have the power and authority
to do it under this bill as written." :

: ~ The National Security Act of 1947 was approved
7/26/47. It provided that for the purpose of coordinating the

" and agencies inthe interest of national security, the, Agency
under the direction of the NSC was:

b. National Security Council Intelligence Directives

To implement the authority granted to itv under tae
National Security Act of 1947, the National Security Council
has issued a series of "National Security Council Intelligence
Directives," usually referred to as NSCID's and commonly called
"Nonscids."' The first of these was issued December 12, 1947, and

Committee to maintain the relationship necessary for a fully

Directive dated September 15, 1958, the U. S. Intelligence Board
(USIB) was formally created as successor to the Intelligence Advisory
Committee and a counterpart known as the U, S. Communications
Intelligence Board.

NSCID No. 1 provided that the Director of Central
Intelligence should coordinate the foreign.intelligence activities
of the United States, such coordination to include both special
and other forms of intelligence. The USIB under this Directive
Shall. ‘tadvise.and-assist, the Director of Central intelligence as

policies, define intelligence objectives, make recommendations
to appropriate U. S, officials, develop standards for protection
of intelligence,-and formulate policies with respect to arrange~
ments with foreign governments. {he Director of Central

H Intelligence is designated as Chairman of this Board and in -

' - this capacity is distinguished from the Director ‘of the

| Central Intelligence Agency. A more complete discussion with

| regard to the Bureau's role in this over-all setup is set forth
vi hereinafter under the caption "FBI Relations With the

United States Intelligence Board."

National Security Council Intelligence Directive
No, i, “ordgina’ lly issued 12/12/47, defines the various types
of intelligence in Section 4, :

(a) National Intelligence is that intelligence
- which is required for the formulation of national security
policy, concerns more than one department or agency,
and transcends the exclusive competence of a single
department or agency. The Director of Central Intelli-
gence shall produce* national intelligence with the
support of the U. S. Intelligence Board.

nee (b) Departmental Intelligence is that intelligence
““which any department or agency requires to execute its own
mission.

SEER - (c) Interdepartmental Intelligence is integrated
Co ; departmental intelligence which is required by departments
: and agencies of the Government for the execution of their
Kk _ + missions, but which transcends the exclusive competence
F ofa single department or agency to produce. The
“subcommittee structure of the U. S, Intelligence Board
may be utilized for the production and dissemination of
interdepartmental intelligence.

Director of Central Intelligence is then authorized
to disseminate national intelligence and interdepartmental
intelligence provided it is done consistent with statutes and
Presidential policy, and provided further "that any disclosure

“of FBI intelligence information shall be cleared with that
_ agency prior to dissemination." :

NSCID No, 2 issued 1/13/48, relates tq coordination -
of foreign intelligence collection activities "not covered
by other NSC Directives."

The Director of Contral Intelligence has responsi~
bility for planning to assure there is no undesirable
duplication and that coverage is adequate.

Responsibilities are then assigned as follows:

(1) The Department of State shall have primary
responsibility for, and shall perform as a service of
common concern, the collection abroad (i.e., outside
the U. S. and its possessions) of political, sociological,
economic, scientific and technical information.

(2) The Department of Defense shall have primary
‘responsibility for, and shall perform as a service of
common concern, the collection of military intelligence

‘ information, Owing to the importance of scientific and

. technical intelligence to the Department of Defense
and the military rvices, this collection responsibility
shall inciude so

‘missions. (It seems significant that while State Depart-

"the collection abroad," there was no such limitation

that this collection involves no undesirable duplication

is coordinated with the Department of anvil or with the

In Section 7 of NSCID No. 2 there. is delegated to
CIA responsibility for overt collection of foreign intelligence

“shall conduct the exploitation of foreign language publications

this also constitutes overt collection of foreign intelligence
by that Agency in this country.

Agency may produce such other intelligence as may be
necessary to discharge the statutory responsibilities
of the Director of Central Intelligence."

Since, as noted hereinbefore, "collection" activities

‘word "produce" as used in NSCID No. 3 has the same definition
as set out in a footnote to NSCID No. 1, paragraph 4, i.e., "to
_ correlate and evaluate intelligence relating to the national
“gecurity." Thus, NSCID No. 3 would not appear to extend CIA's
jurisdiction to collect intelligence or be operational in any way.

the subject matter of foreign intelligence collection in the
United States.

ec, Director of Central Intelligence Directives

To implement the National Security Act of 1947 as
amended and the various National Security Council Intelligence
Directives issued pursuant thereto, the Director of Central
Intelligence has issued uumerous Directives (DCID's). The
first of these having a direct bearing on jurisdictional matters
is DCID No. 2/3, captioned "Domestic Exploitation of .
Nongovernmental Organizations and Individuals," NSCID No. 2,
paragraph 7, states that CIA shail be responsible for the
selective exploitation within the U. S. of such organizations
and individuals as sources.ot foreign intelligence information,
We, therefore, have avoided, and should avoid, any operations
among nongovernmental organizations and individuals designed
solely to produce foreign intelligence without CIA prior
approval or nullification of these provisions,

DCID No. 2/3 provides for exploitation of nongovernmental

*" U. S. citizens by CIA domestic field offices and states, “In

cases where the Federal Bureau of Investigation has indicated an
gnerational interest in a U. S, citizen, Central Intelligence
Agency will coordinate with that agency prior to further contact.”

This DCID also provides for exploitation by CIA
domestic field offices of aliens, following a prior name check

‘ . with FBI so our statutory obligations may be properly met without

CIA interference.

It is of possible interest to note that in dealing with
these two matters, DCID No. 2/3 refers to nongovernmental U. S. .
citizens but only to aliens (without the restrictive adjective).
The NSCID on which it is based refers to nongrovernmental
individuals without distinguishing between citizens and aliens,
Thus, there appears to have been an.intention to confine CIA's
intelligence exploitation functions within the U, 8, A review
of our file on CIA (62-80750) indicates this might well have
jpeen a concession to the Bureau since we went on record opposing
delegation of any intelligence collection functions within the
U. S. to CIA in letters to Lieutenant General Hoyt S. Vandenberg
(then Director of Central Intelligence Group) on June 25, 1946,
(Serial 96), August 6, 1946, (Serial 138), and August 23, 1946,
(Serial 222), which have been.discussed more fully under the
heading “National Intelligence Authority," — :

S.C CUD

DCID No. ‘2/8 is captioned "Domestic Exploitation of
U. S. Government Organizations and Officials," It begins in
very general terms, "Pursuant to thé provisions of NSCID No, 1
and NSCID No, 2... .% It provides, "The Central Intelligence
Agency shall coordinate and have the primary responsibility for
‘exploitation of the foreign intelligence potential of non-USIB
organizations and officials to meet community needs as a
service of common concern,” :

As set forth above, there seems to be no basis for
such CIA jurisdiction in NSCID No. 1 and No. 2. Paragraph 7
of NSCID No. 2 specifically restricts CIA in this area of
operations to nongovernmental organizations and individuals,

7 A review of our U. S. Intelligence Board (osTB) file,
62-90718, _ Shows following apropos’ this matter:

7 The Draft Minutes of the 3/21/61 USIB
ao meeting report that the Board approved the
> draft of a DCID on "Domestic Exploitation of
U. S. Government Organizations and Officials,"
which would be issued as DCID No, 2/8, eifect
” 3/21/61. Mr. Belmont was present at this USIB
Vv He meeting as the FBI representative. (unnumbered
- serial between serials 1131°& 1132, USIB file)

Tracing this subject matter back through
the USIB file it was learned that it apparently
was first considered at the meeting held 2/23/60
at which the Bureau was represented by Fred A,
Frohbose, The minutes for that meeting reported
- the Board agreed in principle that a directive on /
1°  - . Intelligence Exploitation of U. 8S. Governmental
officials would be desirable. However, the
matter was referred to the Committee on Domestic
Exploitation for further study and the submission
of a revised draft for Board consideration,
(unnumbered serial between serials 1040 & 1041,
USIB file)

From the foregoing it would appear that the Bureau
concurred in the issuance of this particular Directive and thus
to an extension of CIA's overt collection activities in the
U. S. if:this Should, in fact, be interpreted as an extension.

pcx 4/1 provides for “the establishment of the
an “interagency Defector eee nee: nares

i 27 a al .



DCID's 4/2 and 4/3 relate to the Defector Program
abroad and domestically, respectively, The latter one dwells on
division of responsibilities between FBI and CIA in the handling
of defectors within the continental limits of the United Statos,
It provides that exploitation of such defacters shall be conducted:

1. To obtain internal security information or other
data required by FBI in view of its statutory responsibilities
in the internal security field,

2. To obtain foreign intelligence information required
in the interests of national security by the member agencies of
the USIB.

: 3. For such other purposes as are deemed to be in the
. interests of national security.

~The very next sentence then gives the implication that
exploitation of the defector for foreign intelligence purposes is
+ the principal responsibility of CIA, for it reads, "Decision as
to the relative importance of internal security exploitation by
FBI and foreign intelligence exploitation by the Central
intelligence Agency (CIA) shall be made Jointly by representatives of
CIA and FBI." i
Piesiaet j
There then follows a listing of nine specific FBI
responsibilities, one of which is to make available to CIA foreign
intelligence information resulting from the initial exploitation
of defectors, There is no subsequent specific delineation of CIA
responsibility over foreign intelligence exploitation until there
eee ‘ as a transfer of respons _pility for handling a defector from FBI
re to CIA after FBI interests have been fully satisfied. There is a
| general assignment of such responsibility to CIA in the terms,
4 “ "CIA shall be responsible for: a. Coordinating the activities of.
{ : other departments and agencies concerned with defector matters,
I, except those responsibilities assigned exclusively to FBI... .*

As a matter of practice, if it is determined there is
little or no importance from an internal security standpoint in
connection with a particular defection, we do not take over but in
effect give clearance to CIA to proceed from a foreign intelli-
gence standpoint,

. DCID's in the 5/ series (numbers one through five) were
issued principally to implement NSCID Number 5 which deals with
U. S, espionage and clandestine counterintelligence activities
abroad, There appears to be no conflict with FBI jurisdiction in
this series.

oa “a. Dulles Commi ittee, 1949 \ uw

; The Dulles Committee was appainted February 3, 1948,

by the National Security Council (NSC) to make a "comprohensiva,
impartial and objective survey of the. organization, activities
and personnel of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA)." The

Committee was instructed te report its findings and recommendations
on the following matters: 7

(a) The adequacy and effectiveness of ‘the
a organization structure of CIA.

(b) The value and efficiency of existing CIA baad a ee

(c) The relationship of these activities to those of.
other departments and agencies.

“(d), The utilization and qualifications of CIA personnel,

7 The Committee's scope was extended on March 17, 1948,

to include the following provisions: "This survey will comprise
primarily a thorough and comprehensive examination of the
structure, administration, activities and inter-agency relation=
ships of the CIA as outlined in the resolution of the National
Security Council. It will also include an examination of such
intelligence activities of other Government departments and
agencies as relate to the national security, in order to make
recommendations for their effective operation and overall
coordination, . ." :

This report, which is dated January 1, 1949, for the
most part concerned itself with administrative matters affecting
CIA and the necessity for reorganization within that Agency. It
notes, however, that the National Security Act, as implemented
‘by directives of the NSC, imposed upon CIA responsibility for
. imal Lavine out three essential functions: 7

“a The coordination of intelligence activities.
“7 35" the’ corvelation and evaluation of’ intelligence
relating to the national security, which has been interpreted
_ by directive as meaning the -production® of national Antellig: nce...

HE OH

*. See definition “of itproduce” in. footnote ‘to. ‘xgerD No. 1, Section
4b as "correlate and evaluate," the reverse of connotation given:
. here. Cecant oF

“



{3) The performance centrally, subject to NSC
direction, of certain intelligence and related functions of
common concern to various departments of the Government.

The report noted that Section 102 of the National
Security Act of 1947 established a framework for a sound

intelligence system and no amendment to that Section of the
Act was deemed. necessary.

Although the coordination of intelligence activities
of the several departments and agencies concerned with national
. Security was a primary reason for establishing CIA, the report
noted the National Security Act does not give CIA independent

, authority to coordinate intelligence activities, as final
. wesponsibility to establish policies was vested in the NSC.

-'The statutory limitations upon the authority of CIA
to coordinate intelligen-e activities without the approval of
the NSC were, according to the report, obviously designed to
protect the autonomy and internal arrangements of the various
* departments and agencies performing intelligence functions.

In spite of these calculated limitations ou thse.autherity of
CIA, the report noted, it was clear the Agency was expected to
provide the initiative and leadership in developing a coordinated
intelligence system. In practice, the NSC has almost without
- exception approved the recommendations submitted to it by CIA
‘for the coordination of intelligence activities.

none

iM The National Security Act does not define the
“. "intelligence activities" which were to be coordinated by CIA
under the direction of the NSC or specify the departments
. whose activities were covered, Presumably, according to the
oa report, all intelligence activities relating to the national
security were included, from collecting information in the first
. instance to. the preparation and dissemination of finished
intelligence reports and estimates. ‘The criterion," which the
- veport noted was a very broad one, was "such intelligence
activities. . . as relate to the national security and not
the identity of the.departments concerned or the nature or
locale of the intelligence activity." Thus, the report noted,
practically no limitations are set upon the scope of the intelli=
gence activities with which the aba daha Intelligence ca tered is
to concern itself, : : ae” suJeUSseSsensauseunee’ aust

LFV 65960_Docldi2980629-Page108--



The report noted another broad field requiring
coordination is that of foreign intelligence derived from
domestic sources and the allied field of domestic counter
intelligence, This includes the exploitation of intollirgonce
from United States business firms, travellers, etc., exploitation
of the intelligence possibilities of groups and individuals of —
foreign nationality in the United States, the relating of
domestic counterintelligence to foreign intelligence and the
coordination of domestic counterespionage with counterespionage
abroad, Except for the exploitation of private sources of
i foreign intelligence in the United States which is centralized
in the Office of Operations, CIA, responsibility for other
activities is scattered among the State Department, the armed
|FEEE services, the FBI and CIA.

The FBI, which has primary security and law enforce~
ment responsibilities, is concerned in fact with an important
“area of intelligence. This includes domestic counterespionage
sand countersabotage, control of communist and other subversive
activities and surveillances of alien individuals and groups.
All of these functions, according to the report, are closely

veluied iv the comparable activities abroad cf the CIA.

(> 7 : The report noted the FBI was not.part of the then
cua \ existing machinery for covrdination of intelligence through
‘\the Intelligence Advisory Committee.and there was no continuing
manner whereby domestic intelligence and counterintelligence
were related to overall national intelligence in order to serve
‘the general purpose set forth in the National Security Act,
. which was set forth as “of coordinating the intelligence activities
“of the several Government departments and agencies in the interest
of national security." 7
7 It was the opinion of the authors of the Dulles Report”
that CIA had the duty under the Act to concern itself with the
problem of coordinating those phases of domestic intelligence
and counterintelligence which relate to the national security -
and CIA should submit recommendations on this. subject to the
‘NSC. ~The report noted this:‘was. not inconsistent with the .... «8 w+
stipulation of the National Security Act that CIA "shail have no
police, subpoena, law ,enforcement. powe:
functions. Mak

__NW 65360’ Noctd:32989629_Page 309



The Dulles Commission recommended that the FBI
should be made a member of the Intelligence Advisory Committee
to improve coordination of domestic intelligence and countor~
intelligence insofar as these matters related to the national
security.

While discussing the production of National
Intelligence Estimates by CIA, the report noted, "There is
no systematic way of tapping that domestic intelligence
information, which should be chiefly in the hands of the FBI,
having 2 bearing on broader intelligence issues: and there
is no regular and agreed arrangement for participation by the
FBI and for the use of intelligence from domestic sources in
a national estimate."

National Security Council Intelligence Directive

Number 7 provided that CIA shall be responsible for the
exploitation, on a highly selective basis, within the United
States of business concerns, other non-Governmental organizations
and individuals as sources of foreign intelligence information,
The renort concluded the amount of foreign intelligence which
can be obtained through the exploitation of nou-Guvernncntal
:sources in the United States is considerable and its quality
could be very high if appropriate arrangements were made and
discrimination was employed, it was felt the vast number of
organizations, institutions and individuals having foreign
interests and knowledge represented a potential source of
intelligence that in many ways was. superior to any other,

. ‘as it was felt that they were in a position to provide

: . information obtained from their foreign contacts and from the

findings on their own people abroad. .

; A further important source of information, the
- exploitation for intelligence purposes of foreign individuals
and groups in the United States was also being developed, The
report noted that these individuals and groups as well as
_ «political refugees and former foreign government officials
. were often engaged in political spuietealai Beanies significant
international implications.

“individuals and groups in the United States because of

possible security implications, The-report indicated the

FBI possessed considerable information concerning many ‘

individuals and groups but this information had been obtained |

primarily with security r«ther than intelligence considerations

in mind and was not normally given the kind of interpretation

or dissemination that intelligence required if it was to be

properly used. It was also noted the FBI was, in cases where

it had a security interest, reluctant on security grounds to

have intelligence exploitation by outside agencies. The general

result of this situation, according to the report, was that an
Renu _important source of intelligence was not being fully exploited.

The report noted that the question of the
exploitation for intelligence purposes of foreign groups and
individuals in the United States was a clear example where

: the Intelligence Advisorr Committee, with the FBI being added
~as a member, should establish principles and rules for
coordination,

In discussing the administrative handling of
espionage and counterespionage matters within the CIA, the
teeee jor report noted the FBI was charged with all counterespionage
iat _ responsibilities in the United States except those affecting
. personnel of the armed services, The Dulles Commission
-- .recommended the counterespionage activities of CIA should be
increased in scope and emphasis and that closer liaison in
. this field should be established with the FBI.

The only effect the Dulles Report had on the FBI
was its inclusion as a member of the Intelligence Advisory
Committee by amendment to HSCID Number 1 dated July 7, 1949.

‘e, Hoover Commission, 1948 and 1955

Task forces of the Commission on Organization of the
Executive Branch of the Government (Hoover Commission)
conducted surveys of CIA operations from 1947 to 1949 (under F,
. Eberstadt) and from 1953 to 1955 (under General Mark Clark).

’

* NWES5360~Doctd:32989629~-PAgS 31



The Commission concerned itself principally with
the efficiency with which CIA was fulfilling its statutory.
missions of coordination, correlation, evaluation, and
dissemination of the intelligence product of other Government
agencies and departments. The Commission examined agency
activity in light of the CIA primary mission of advising
NSC and performing services and duties rolated to
intelligence and national security as the NSC directed,

(la) LEberstadt Task Force Report
The results ot the first examination of CIA by the
Hoover Commission were more or less apologetic in tone,
emphasizing the soundness of directives setting up NSC and its
direction of the Agency, The report pointed out however,
‘that CIA and its parent, NSC, had had little time to actually
- implement the coordination necessary for leadership in the
. field, .The Task Force clearly defined its understanding of
'-the CIA mission as: ",....,coordinate intelligence activities
of Federal agencies concerned with national security."

The duties of CIA were listed as:

sdeiaiai e i 1, Advise National Security Council on national
rs security intelligence activities of Federal departments and
7 agencies,

. 2. Recommend necessary coordination of such
activities to: ‘National Security Council,

7 3. Correlate, evaluate and disseminate national,
, Segurity intelligence,

4, Render intelligence services for other Federal
‘departments and agencies." (62-88575~3 enclosure behind file.)

In discussing the duties of the CIA the Task Force
noted, "Under the statute CIA is entrusted with the performance
of such.services of’ common concern as the National Security
Council shall determine. At present these include, apart from
Scientific Intelligence, which is discussed separately: (2)
maintenance ot central indexes of report, records, and documents
having intelligence value; (b) examination of foreign documents
from which intelligence material is extracted and disseminated;
(c) maintenance of central map facilities; (d) monitoring of
foreign broadcasts; and (e) collection of the. aerate by
Clandestine means and counterespionage abroad."

In evaluating the operations and location of CIA
counterespionage the Task Force commented as follows:

"The counterespionage activities of CIA abroad appear
properly integrated with CIA's other clandestine operations.
Although arguments have been made in favor of extending CIA's
authority to include responsibility for counterespionage in this
Country, such an extension of jurisdiction does not a present
appear justified. For one thing,. concentration of power over
counterespionage activities at home in the hands of a Director
of Central Intelligence responsible for espionage abroad might
justifiably arouse public suspicion and opposition, Conceivably
it could form the basis for a charge that a gestapo is in :
process of creating even though the power to arrest were
specifically withheld, To transfer responsibility for domestic
counterespionage from the FBI, which has an established
organization and long tradition, to CIA, which is not equipped
for the assignment, would probably create more problems than it
would solve, It is doubtful whether the logical benefit of

the world would justify the dislocation and confusion that such
a transfer would inevitably occasion."

"CIA representatives have indicated that their present
working liaison with FBI is satisfactory, but the Committee
doubts that FBI~CIA relationships are completely adequate, The
Director of FBI declined the Committee's invitation to appear
before it to discuss the CIA with the committee or its

activities,"

The groundwork for CIA acceptance was laid by the
Committee recommendation and finding: "CIA is not now properly

"Detailed study of organization and activities of
intelligence divisions of the Government, including CIA, is
being made by a committee consisting of Messrs. Allen Dulles,
William H. Jackson, and Mathias Correa, assisted by a staff
of four directed by Mr. Robert Blum of the Office of
Secretary of Defense." With this statement it may be assumed
the Task Force excused omissions it may have made with the
observation that the Dulles group was conducting almost the
same survey carried on in the Hoover Commission aad far as

.CIA was involved,

(lb) Clark Task Force Report i Resear ts

The Task Force headed by. General Mark Clark
submitted a Top Secret report dated in May, 1955, setting
forth results of the second Hoover Commission survey of the
organization of CIA. The report pointed out the survey
was of departments and agencies with entire or prime
responsibility in the field of positive foreign intelligence
as it pertains to national defense and security. It
qualified this survey when speaking of the FBI, noting
survey was limited to survey of Bureau only to the extent

. that it dealt in security intelligence.

Again the Hoover Commission through its Task
Force pinned CIA jurisdiction down to the areas defined by statute,
and emphasized the Agency was subordinate only to the National

. Security Council in its coordination, correlation, dissemination
‘and collection of intelligence data. The Task Force noted

that since CIA is charged with the over~all responsibility
for coordinating the output of all intelligence forces, the
Task Force was giving special attention to the work of that

Agency.

In the Task Force Report a review of the FBI
functions in the intelligence community was set forth, The

”. committee noted that the FBI had only limited activities in the

positive intelligence field but noted additionally that Fai
functions in the current intelligence effort were of interest
in order _ #411 ue the intelligence picture.

‘= 36 = i ete i



e@ : : neal ‘ e

The’ FBI was cited as one of the four members of
the Interdepartmental Intelligence Conference ({IC), created
by the NSC, approved by the President 3/23/49, to coordinate
"the investigation of all domestic espionage, counterospionage,
sabotage, subversion, and other related matters affecting
internal security." :

It was noted that the IiC charter did not disturb
responsibilities of its member agencies but made mandatory
action by those agencies deemed necessary to insure complete
investigative coverage in compliance with the needs of the

: LIC, which had full responsibility for coordination of the-
investigation of all domestic espionage, counterespionage,
et cetera, affecting internal security.

The Committee stated, "The Central Intelligence
Agency is, by law, excluded from duplicating the internal
security functions of the FBI. However, the CIA does develop
~ within and without the U. S., sources for foreign (positive)
intelligence, and incidental thereto may develop leads as to
subversive activities within this country. In such cases
CIA through Liaison gives its information to the FBI."

y i A Task Force survey revealed, "Through the Central
7 Intelligence Agency's domestic field offices, contacts are
made on a highly selective basis with business concerns and
tother nongovernmental agencies, as well as with previously
. eleared individuals who travel abroad . .. Under the
-provisions of DCID 7/1, each member of the Intelligence
Advisory Committee is required to establish in Washington
a focal office for the purpose of interviewing nongoverament
visitors. . . Any visitors to these offices demonstrating .
good intelligence potential are referred to the CIA for further
. exploitation."

The Task Force noted that as far back as 1939
President Roosevelt by executive order directed the FBI.to
coordinate and conduct domestic counterintelligence activities.
In 1949, according to the Committee's survey, the IIC was-
formalized and by charter restricted to coordinating investi~
gations in intelligence matters domestically.

In commenting on the role of the FBI ie Committee
further noted, "The Federal Bureau of Investigation, however,
is the.recognized center of the domestic aspect of internal
security including countorintelligence within the Unitod States
and its possessions,"

With regard to the use and surfacing of sources,
the Committee noted that CIA was not bound to disclose its
sources; however, it commented on the excellent liaison
system of the FBI which had overcome this restriction so far
as internal security within the U. S. is concerned. "Now,
as a matter of practice the CIA usually refers domestic sources
to the FBI, the only exception being where the source is to be
used in foreign intelligence work by the CIA." In the area
of defectors within this country, the Committee noted that
the FBI will receive from CIA or by a direct interrogation of
a CIA-controlled defector information which the defector may
have concerning internal security. Persons who defect within
this country, on the other hand, were found to be under the
cognizance of the FBI. Then the reverse of the above situation
comes into play and CIA has access to the defector for developing
Leads in the forcign intolligence field. The Committee
commented, "It is the duty of the FBI to conduct investigations
of all cases involving f.reign nationals in the United States
as set forth in the Delimitations Agreement."

A review of the Commission report lends one important
fact to our study of this subject matter. This was pointed

of the National Security Council within the field of national
intelligence. Ten subcommittees or working groups with member~
ship from separate departments or interested agencies acted

in advisory capacities to the IAC parent committee. In each
of these subcommittees the chairman was a representative of

the Director of CIA and the working groups were individually
serviced by a secretariat furnished by CIA. From the top-
heavy alignment of CIA personnel in IAC and its working groups

slanted when dissenting matters were presented by the TAC and
CIA to the NSC, .

#2. The Doolittle Committee, 1954

In July, 1954, we received information from the
White House that the President had appointed Lieutenant
General James H. Doolittle to study in collaboration with
the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) certain aspects of
the national intelligence effort. By letter dated
duly 28, 1954, Sherman Adams, the Assistant to the President,
requested that the Bureau brief General Doolittle's group
concerning the relationship that existed between the Bureau
and CIA. We subsequently learned that at approximately the
same time a survey would be conducted by the Hoover
Commission under the chairmanship of General Mark Clark.
We learned from Allen W. Dulles, Director of CIA, that the
President strongly believed that General Clark should not
permit the survey to get into CIA covert operations,
particularly in the field of political and psycholagical
. warfare, The President had told Dulles that he was selecting
a General Doolittle to study CIA's covert operations.

-General Doolittle's group was briefed on /
August 25, 1954, at which time the Bureau's position in
the intelligence field was described and the manner in
".. which the Bureau transacted business with CIA was explained.

- In addition, certain constructive criticism concerning
problems and conflicts experienced in dealing with CIA was
furnished General Doolittlie's group. The following salient

‘features of the criticism appear to bear’on the current ‘study:

We were critical of a policy of the Office of

Operations, CIA,which precluded that Division from

identifying any of its sources in the United States when

such sources possessed information bearing on the internal
ww. o..,, security of the United States, The Office of Operations as .

source by CIA policy. We were of the opinion that CIAts
policy could be modified to allow us direct accoss to
the source in the United States when such was necessary.

As of 1954, CIA had intorost in various
organizations such as Radio Free Europe and others and
from time to time the Bureau would get involved in
investigation of organizations only to learn they were
being supported or guided by CIA. Our opinion was that
if we had been appropriately notified of CIA's interest
considerable investigative time and manpower could have 7%

been saved and in addition we would have been in a position

to notify CIA when anything of interest came to our
attention.

Concerning CIA investigations in the United

* States, we readily acknowledged CIA's right to investi-

gate its own applicants or consultants. We did object
to CIA's undertaking any investigation in this country
when the facts indicated the case was clearly within
Bureau jurisdiction and pointed out that the Bureau had

~xecently become involved in investigating an individual

suspected of espionage activity. We were in contact with
CIA and had-solicited its help concerning certain aspects

. in the case but it was a few weeks before we learned CIA

had conducted a very close investigation of this same
“jndividual. We made the observations that close and open
cooperation between the Bureau and CIA was. vital to the
“proper handling of espionage cases. :

: The Bureau pointed out that as of 1954 it had
received 2dittle or no significant. information concerning
espionage or sabotage agents coming..to the United States.
We excluded diplomatic personnel in this matter but clearly
indicated that CIA should be in a position to give us some

‘advance notification when spies were coming to this country...

Possibly this latter was the ee
we had since we did not feel CIA with its resources and
overseas contacts was performing one of its prime functions
in the intelligence field; that is, identifying foroign
illegals who are en route to the United States. During our
briefing of General Dool*ttle's group, we described the
Bureau's collection of intelligence information for the
interested Government agencies as a major operation. Our
discharge of our intelligence operation concerning the
Communist Party and Soviet and Satellite diplomats was '
explained in detail to the satisfaction of all personnel
attending the briefing.

General Doolittle asked for recommendations as to
what could be done to improve CIA so’ the Bureau would get
better service. It was suggested that corrective action be
taken on the matters which had been criticized constructively;
CIA should establish adequate coverage (although not

, Specifically noted, this obviously regarded advance notice

of foreign intelligence personnel coming to the United States);_
and finally CIA should transmit information developed in an
expedite fashion. Ee

Prior to submitting the report to.the President,
General Doolittle expressed a desire to see Mr. Hoover, whom
he regarded as the outstanding intelligence authority in the
world.. The General visited the Director on October 5, 1954,
during which visit CIA's operations were discussed and
generally the points of the previous meeting were reiterated.
General Doolittle felt the ideal solution would be to wipe out

CIA entirely and start all over again, but since this was

impractical his committee would point out certain weaknesses
and make certain recommendations and suggestions to the
President for the correction of these weaknesses. _

of the United States Government -

Captioned report was prepared by ‘the Stuay Group
and desued 12/15/60, Thé Group was under thé chairmanship of

NW 65360 Docld:32989629 Page 320

Lyman B. Kirtkpatrick, Inspector General, Central Intelligence
Agency (CIA), acting as a representative of the Director of
Central Intelligence (DCI). The other four members of the
Study Group represented the Department of State, Secretary of
Defense, Bureau of the Budget, and the National Security:
Council (NSC). :

The stated targets of examination by the Group were

‘organizational and management aspects within the intelligence

effort relating to all aspects of foreign intelligence. In
the confines of these objectives the Bureau was not considered
for examination by the Group in view of the Bureau's lack of ©
operational jurisdiction in matters outside of this country.
Mr. Belmont, acting for the Bureau, gave a briefing before the
Group on'7/29/60 regarding the Bureau's relations with other
United States intelligence agencies. There was no mention

‘made of the Bureau in the report except in one of its

recommendations relative to reorganization of the membership
of the United States Intelligence Board (USIB) which will be.

“dealt with in more detail later.

The 142 page report submitted hy the Groun appeared
to be apologetic in tone for any shortcomings of CIA. The
reader obtains the definite impression the report was used as
a sounding board for differences of opinion as to methods and
administration for collection of foreign intelligence (overt
and covert) abroad.

- The main basis for conclusions and recommendations
-made by the Group rested in delineation of duties of DCI as
coordinator of intelligence as opposed to DCI secondary
responsibility as head of CIA, The Group recognized service
jealousies apparently resulting from refusal to accept the
fact that DCI could control and coordinate intelligence effort
without affording preferential treatment to CIA which was his

_ operational and administrative arm.

There is no reference in the report to a clear
. definition of CIA operational ,responsibilities or jurisdiction
within continental United States, : i

The Group found that DCI through heads of missions
abroad and designated DCI representatives in foreign countries
had principal responsibility for control and coordination of
foreign collection efforts. The CIA's operations abroad were
recognized in almost all 43-of the Group's recommendations. ©



Recommendation number 17 emphasized that CIA
should place emphasis on the establishment of unofficial
cover throughout the world; recommendation number 20 was
that CIA should increase intelligence support to unified and

component commanders by direct dissomination from pertinent
field stations.

The report noted that CIA's main requirements
problem related to clandestine collection and concerned
the great. number of requirements served on the Agency. . .

The main tone of the report was that greater
cooperation was required between the Joint Chiefs of Staff
(JCS), Department of State, and CIA in carrying out foreign

‘intelligence collection missions. The recommendations of

the Group were all directed toward this end and had no
bearing on internal espionage or counterespionage activities

_ Within the United States.

‘In commenting on the coordination duties of the

: DCI, the Group pointed out that USIB had been officially

directed to "establish policies and develop programs for
the guidance cf ail ts and agencies concerucd; the
DCI is authorized to make such surveys of departmental
intelligence activities or the various departments and
agencies as he may deem necessary in connection with his
duty to advise the NSC and coordinate the intelligence effort
of the United States."' The report interpreted these official
directions to indicate that USIB should assume a greater

act proportion of the actual direction and control of the

intelligence community of which the Bureau was noted to be
@ member. cane

To strengthen USIB position as a director,

: coordinator, and controlier of intelligence effort, the

Group recommended (recommendation number 30) that the USIB
should be reduced to four members’ who should be the DCI
(chairman) and representatives of Secretary'of State, Secretary
of Defense, and Joint Chiefs of Staff. The FBI and the Atomic
Energy Commission would be relegated to ad hoc representation
“on the Board.

“MW. 65360_Docld:32989629-Page-321-—



It should be noted in considering the proposed
change of USIB membership that the Bureau was a member of
six of the twenty-six subcommittees which formed the committee
make-up of the USIB. .

: Memorandum January 10, 1961, Mr: pbinont to
Mr, Parsons outlined the proposed USIB membership change
for the Director, It recommended that Bureau make no issue

_ of the proposed recommendation, The Director underlined
a@ passage of the memorandum which stated "In one sense of
the word it could be arjued the FBI would lose prestige
by changing from a regular member to an ad hoc member,"
The Director approved the recommendation of the memorandum

_ with the following notation: "O.K, but I am not enthusiastic
about the change of our status. H." Our status, however, was
not changed and the Bureau has continued to hold full member=
ship on the Board.

In brief, the Joint Study Group Report noted that
the majority of the recommendations of the Study Group had
beer favorably received by the intelligence community in
that positive action had been taken to place most of them
in effect. Many of the recommendations of the Group were
felt to have been met by the creation of the Defense
Intelligence Agency (DIA) which acted as a coordinator and

.. overseer of the intelligence effort of the Joint Chiefs
-of Staff, There is no comment made in this report which
would bear on our present survey of CIA jurisdiction or

. activities within the United States in conflict with our own

.- jurisdictional and investigative interests. The only
reference to the Bureau.in this latter report was as

of the membership of the USIB. Seenaraae

ranks, This was the basis for opening our Santo Domingo Office,
‘ which has continued operation since 5/21/65,

AS a result of maintaining our Dominican Office and
assisting in its mission, we have instituted various technical
surveillances and developed numerous live sources in the
United States from which we regularly acquire foreign intelligence
.sinformation, Since the President has relied on the Bureau to

keep him apprised of developments from an intelligence standpoint
as well as developments with respect to communist influence,
- these sources are regalarly contacted for information which i

the IAC was established by National Security Council Intelligence

member of the IAC for the purpose of coordinating domestic

the Director of the Defense Intelligence Agency; the Director
of the National Security Agency; the Assistant General Manager
- for Administration, Atomic Energy Commission, and the Assistant
Director of the FBI, The primary responsibility of the USIB
is the coordination of intelligence activities, In this
regard, USIB's major effort is concerned with the preparation
} and approval of National Intelligence Estimates (NIE) for use
i by policy makers,

AS a rule, the Bureau does not participate in the’
preparation of NIE's inasmuch as the subject matter is usually
outside the jurisdiction of this Bureau, We have in the past.

“participated in some selective NIE's such as certain estimates
on Cuba, world communism, the clandestine introduction of

, Buclear weapons into the Inited States pnd on the Dominican ~
Republic. .

As part of its staffing procedure, USIB has

created numerous committees in some of which the Bureau
maintains membership, The USIB committees on which the
Bureau has representation are the Technical Surveillance

- Countermeasures Committee, the Signal Intelligence Committee,
_the Interagency Defector Committee, the Watch Committee, the
Joint Atomic Energy Intelligence Committee, the Guided Missile
Astronautics Intelligence Committee, the Security Committee,
and the Committee on Documentation, As a general rule,
attendance at Committee sessions is handled by the Liaison
Section. Attendance at meetings is in the main restricted to
the Interagency Defector Committee, the Watch Committee, the

- Security Committee, the Technical Surveillance Countermeasures

Over the years, consideration has been given to
the Bureau's withdrawing its membership from USIB. On each
occasion the Director has chosen to have the Bureau retain
its membership on the Board. The last such occasion occurred
in 1964 during the period when John McCone was Chairman of
the United States Intelligence Board, At that time, the military
services were removed from membership on the Board and replaced
by the Defense Intelligence Agency. At the time, Mr. Belmont,
then Assistant to the Director, orally discussed with the —
Director the possibility of the Bureau's withdrawing from the
USIB. The Director's comments were that we would not request
removal from membership on the Board but would withdraw our
membership only if so requested by the Director of Central
Intelligence in his role as Chairman of the USIB. The Bureau's
withdrawal would, of course, require action on the part of

the National Security Council.

The case involving Army Sergeant Jack E. Dunlap,

a former employee of the National Security Agency whe was
a Soviet espionage agent, was thoroughly reviewed by the
present .PFIAB in view of the most serious ramifications it
presented. This case concerned the penetration by the
Soviets of the National Security Agency. The report which
emanated from the PFIAB study included proposals which affect
the responsibilities and activities of several agencies within
the intelligence community. All of the twenty-one recommendations.
of the Board dealt with various aspects of achieving a
strengthened counterintelligence capability to guard against

. © penetration of our security establishments by hostile intelli=
gence agencies. Nineteen of the recommendations of the Board
were approved by the President and three of these related
directly to Bureau activity.: They are as follows: °

#18; "That steps be taken to assure that the

Federal Bureau of Investigation has adequate

agent resources to effect the required domestic

counterintelligence coverage of both bloc and

nonbloc official installations and personnel who’
_may be engaged in inielligence and related

#19; “That the policies of the Department of
State with respect to authorizing technical ae

devices) by the Federal Bureau of Investigation q
of foreign official: installations and personnel :
in this country be re-examined with a -view to penniaee

on the sources of foreign intelligence existing in

e, The Director's Stand Over the Years ele

The Director's stand over the years with respect

within the United States is reflected in numerous comments
he has made dating back to the days when the Central
Intelligence Group (CIG) was being formed,

In June, 1946, General Vandenberg, then head of
CIG, sent a memorandum to the Director proposing that the.
National Intelligence Authority issue a directive extending
the powers and duties of the Director of Central Intelligence,

was analyzed on June 21, 1946, in a memorandum from C. H.
Carson to D. M. Ladd in which it was pointed out that it
was inevitable’ that CIG must enter into the domestic
picture because of sources of foreign intelligence in that

Tamm and Mr. C, A. Tolson which was followed by comments by
the Director which is most pertinent to the subject matters
waders Giscussicn, Tho addondum read: - ‘
"Mx, Tolson and Mr. Tamm do not concur with
. the conclusion expressed in this memorandum that
'It is inevitable that the Central Intelligence
Group must enter into the domestic field picture
insofar as intelligence'is concerned because of

. that field.' They feel that a coordinated pro-
gram for the exchange of information between the on
Central Intelligence Authority and the FBI, 7
permitting a free and comprehensive exchange of
information in matters of mutual interest, will
enable the Bureau to work in the domestic field
without interference from the Central Intelligence "
Authority in the same manner that the Bureau works, -
for example, with local police departments or other
.. , - governmental agencies within defined jurisdictional.
lines. We believe that the attached letter to
:General Vandenberg is satisfactory. hid

“The peers commented as follows:

eg) ‘am. ‘not. as optimistic as ‘are ‘Tolson &: “Pam.

‘¢Hink it is inevitable that ‘there willbe ‘a: ~

- collision with CIG over our domestic jurisdiction
‘ i paneaay ch Aninity

or rather their expansion into it on intelligence
matters. It ought not occur but this new memo .

of CIG shows how greedy it is. It is the

Donovan plan almost in toto & is being slyly

put over, It means we must zealously guard our
domestic jurisdiction & not yield an inch & be yY
ever alert to resist any encroachment."

On March 27, 1953, the Director testified before the
Senate Subcommittee on Appropriations. In response to a question
from Senator McCarran concerning liaison between FBI and CIA,
the Director stated: “There is close liaison. CIA has
exclusive jurisdiction abroad for intelligence. We have
exclusive jurisdiction within the United States. We maintain
continuous liaison with CIA Headquarters in Washington through
@ liaison representative of our Bureau in order to facilitate
the transmission of material from them to us and from our
service to them,"

In October, 1958, CIA approached us requesting
our concurrence in CTAts establishing physical and technical
surveillance in the United States on the [brother of the then
current ruler of Yemen CIA had an operational interest in

: this individual. By memorandum it was recommended that the

Bureau not.become involved in this CIA operation and that CIA
be informed that this would not establish a precedent for
approval of future CIA activities in the United States.

_ Responsive to continuing to present problems, the Director

noted: "This is an understatement particularly if we are
going to adopt a macaroni backbone attitude instead of standing
up forthrightly for our rights and jurisdiction."

CIA, in April, 1959, advised us that one of its

fReyptiag sources would be visiting the United States, and

requested our concurrence in CIA's establishing coverage
including technical surveillance, It was recommended we stay
out of this matter and inform CIA that this ‘was not to be

construed as a precedent for approval of future CIA counter

intelligence activity in the United States. . The Director
commented on the memorandum: "The trend has gone so far we
have become nothing but a rubber stamp for CIA yet they won't
even allow us to perform liaison functions lhe much a

- operational ones.'t :

CTELLT Page 325



In January, 1960, CIA agreed to comply ae
conditions imposed by "the Bureau with regard to developing
positive intelligence information through contacts between
U. S. residents and visitors from Iron Curtain countries.

CIA agreed to contact us first before promoting such
associations. In March, 1960, CIA inquired if it might obtain
Bureau clearance at the field level for such contacts in the
anterest of expediency. Mx. Tolson noted: ‘More and more we
are agreeing to CIA operations in the U. S. I am opposed
to this relaxation. We can exercise better control here than
through our field offices."' The Director added: "I share
‘Tolson's views." CIA was advised clearance was to be obtained .
‘ through Bureau headquarters. 7
Raatoh OME a Soviet, defected’ in Finland
in Decembé?, 1964 and furnished information alleging
penetration of American intelligence. One Serge Karlow, a.
. . CIA officer, was developed as a suspect. On 2/9/62, we took
, over the investigation. On 2/26/62, Sheffield Edwards, then
CIA Director of Security, admitted CIA had had technical :
coverage on Karlow from February, 1961 to 2/9/62. Edwards”
Glaimed his reluctance to tell us of this situation earlier
because of obvious possible jeopardy to prosecution, plus
embarrassment to his Agency should the Bureau raise an
objection to CIA's maintaining such coverage. The Director
.noted: "XI only wish we would eventually realize CIA can
never be depended upon to deal forthrightly with us. Certainly
my skepticism isn't based on prejudice nor suspicion but on
specific instances all too many in number. Yet there exists _

wistful belief that ‘the leopard has changed his spots'."

In April, 1962, we received information on a
strictly confidential basis from Jay Sourwine of the Senate
Internal Security Subcommittee to the effect that an
unidentified CIA representative had talked to Senator Eastland
concerning an alleged move to place CIA in charge of: ail
intelligence~-gathering operations for the Government ~- to
include Soviet espionage in the U. S. The Director noted:

"I am not surprised at the above alleged effert. There is no
doubt in many quarters a desire to eliminate the FBI in

_ dealing with espionage and subversion for we are a thorn not
“only in the side of communists but also the ADA and Fabian
Socialists. CIA which failed again and again to, know what

++ -is actually going on abroad could be counted upon to blunder

_ ,, the same way in the eee sescurese! : *



In Aprii, 1963, we received information indicating
. that CIA Director Sohn McCone was considering expansion of
CIA operations in the United States ~~ specifically intelligence
coverage and the developmont of sources in this country. The
Director made a note on the memorandum recording this: '"McCone
is trying to do another ‘Donovan.’ If he injects himself into
the U. S., the FBI gets out, Too many cocks spoil the broth,"

In December, 1963, the Director inquired as to the
nature and extent of intelligence operations wherein CIA had
established contact with a diplomat, operated him in the U. 8S,
with our coordination, and continued to operate him upon his
having departed this country. Four such cases were cited. On
the memorandum, the Director noted: "I have little confidence

in CIA abiding by agreements if it serves its purpose better
not to do so."

| In January, 1964, CIA advised us it had reorganized
«its activities in the U. S. The Domestic Operations Division,
“CIA, had established field offices in this country under
. appropriate cover, A memorandum was prepared describing the
history of CIA operations in the U.-S. and recommending aation
aaseee designed to protect our interests, A letter went to CIA with
lo, ground rules which the Bureau expected CIA to follow in all
- . matters requiring coordination, The Director noted: "OK, but
I hope you are not being taken in. I can't forget CIA :
withholding the French espionage activities in the U. 8. nor
the false story concerning Oswald's trip to Mexico City, only
to mention two of their instances of double dealing."

The New York Office, by letter 2/14/64, -set ‘orth :
its observations concerning a briefing given that office on the
"; matter of CIA operations in the U. S. The Director commented:
“XY think this domestic operations expansion of CIA is very
- ,. dangerous and will inevitably 'muddy' the waters."

In May, 1964, the Bureau reconsidered its stand
. With respect to permitting CIA to approach sources at foreign
- establishments in the United States, for intelligence purposes.
The following policy was proposed and subsequently approved:

(1) Where there was no indication a source would
be leaving the United States, we would deny CIA clearance
for contact until we had fully explored the person's
potential for cur own purposes if we decided we had no



interest and CIA contact would not jeopardize any FBI
investigations, we would grant CIA approval to proceed
with its contact with proviso we be kept informed of
information developed of possible interest to UB.

(2) Where 4t appeared source would be returning
to a foreign country shortly we would normally grant
.CIA clearance for preliminary contact with proviso we
be kept informed of results. We reserved the right to
take direct access to the source as our needs required,

(3) Where there was an overlapping of interests

- and source expected to continue in United States for
fairly extended period of time, in'those instances where
CIA had entree and no Bureau investigation would be
jeopardized we would permit CIA to explore matter and
make preliminary contact keeping us advised of progress
and getting our specific clearance before a direct
recruitment approach; however, where factors indicated
it would be to best Bureau interests to operate source, |
we would undertake the recruitment and keep CIA advised
of information of interest to that Agency.

: “When these matters were submitted for approval
Mr. Tolson commented, "Looks okay, but we will have to watch °
this very closely," The Director concurred in Mr. Tolson's
remark. i : : giierers Deeceeeeer



_D, THE NEED AND THE POTENTIAL FOR
’ FOREIGN INTELLIGENCE IN THE U. S.

In 1941, the U., 8. allegedly had in its
possession practically all of the foreign intelligence
it needed regarding military and strategic targets in
Japan, The informavion was scattered among various
individuals who had personal knowledge or was located
in libraries, various Government agencies, private 4
business firms, institutions, et cetera. Tragically,
the U, S. Government did not have any mechanism to
collect, record and evaluate such information,
Intelligence was badly needed in 1941, and we paid
dearly in lives and financial resources to accomplish
certain missions because the information was not
readily available.

Today, the need for foreign intelligence is
‘greater than ever. The stakes of foreign policy have
never been higher. The U. S., being a dominating world
7 et power, has assumed vast responsibilities enmeshed in
q : delicate political situations throughout the world.
.The ever-existing threat of an atomic war with communist -
. countries demands a cuutinuing acquirement of knowledge
a so thatpolicies and courses of action can be designed
i cis in the most effective manner possible, .The information
: - needed applies to numerous fields of activity, a major
area being scientific research and development, In this
connection, the revolutionary break~throughs in the -
- seientific category are occurring with unusually high
+’ frequency, and if the U. S. is to remain in the
forefront, it is absolutely necessary that we obtain
-. an accurate evaluation of the enemy's capabilities and
‘- antentions. We have been fortunate to collect high~
‘ quality positive intelligence through sophisticated
collection methods, i.e high altitude photography and
ete research in this area is proceeding at an accelerated
i pace.. Nevertheless, electronic gadgets and machines
will never produce all that is required, We still need
* supplementary coverage on a heavy scale, and the human
being still continues to be a vital source of information,
The individual talks and volunteers information, He talks

i . valuable increments of intelligence, The individual can

N, -of intelligence. The importance of the individual ‘ na
: -is further emphasized when we realize that as each

sophisticated collection technique is introduced,
science also introduces newly designed countertechniques
of covering, protecting, and camouflaging important
assets. In essence, technology eventually hits an
inpenetrable or leveling-off depth, 7 y

Foreign intelligence is not geographically
restricted. Information regarding Chinese Communists
can be obtained anywhere in the world, and even if it
is of a fragmentary nature, the data can be of
significant value, The demand for information is
heavy and is sought by every agency in the Government, .
Because of this, it has been necessary for the
U. S. Government to map a program of collection on
a priority basis, This has been done through the
ereation of a committee which is attached to the ~
U. S. Intelligence Board. The committee maintains
‘a list of priorities on a current basis, A recent
list of guidelines for the collection of foreign
eis oa pertaining to scientific affairs in

. Commppist China included approximately 170 items,

., i.efiong-range planning of Communist China in the

“. muclear field; nature of research in oceanography;
computer capabilities of Shantung University; climate
modification and cloud physics research; development
of meteorological rockets; development of nuclear
weapons; location of uranium refineries; strength
of Naval forces; intentions along the Sino~Indian

’ border; types of equipment being supplied to Laos
and North Vietnam,

In the U. S. proper, the sources of foreign
intelligence are voluminous. Most of these sources

1+ overtly provide information through newspapers,

. gseientific publications, libraries, tourists, visiting
professors and students, journalists, and immigrants,
The compilation, collation, analysis, and reporting
of such information involves an extensive program
and, needless to say, the U. S. today does not have

the capability of tapping all Betletereentend sources on
a Rota basis.

Fox the purpose of this paper, we are
thinking about the search for knowledge considered
‘vital for national’ survival, One could suggest
that clandestine collection of intelligence.is
overomphasizod and that our Government could readily
protect its interests through overt collection and
the employment of our best analysts and evaluators,
If we take this approach, we may as weil discount
the importance of the Bureau's activities in the
counterintelligence field, which essentially are
of a clandestine nature and which have produced time
‘and again vital intelligence. We, therefore, must -
move on the assumption that the clandestine
collection of foreign intelligence is very definitely |
a most necessary element of our over~all intelligence
capabilities. :

In addition to the overt sources, there
z exists a rich potential in the U. S. among the foreign
i ao diplomatic establishments including the U. N., the
toe officials of foreign governments, and visitors such
as students, professors, and scientists, A certain
amount of informatiua fvom such sources can be
aace i obtained in an overt fashion, but the high quality
Cea =H data is normally acquired through clandestine means,
: BEE This can be done through technical. monitoring,
tos development of live sources, access to records,
ar et files, et cetera. There are approximately 106,000
aeeaa foreign officials in the U. S. assigned to embassies,
7 consulates, trade missions, U. N., and other
: international organizations, This excludes 7
dependents, During the fiscal year ending June 30,
1965, 38,544 foreign government officials visited
the u. S23 about 1500 of these came from communist-bloc
countries, During the fiscal year ending June 30, 1965,

approximately 50,000 foreign students came to the U. S.5°

733 of these came from the communist bloc, During the
same fiscal year, there were 2,075,967 visitors from
all countries, Everyone of the foregoing is a potential
source of foreign intelligence, As can be readily
accepted, the U. S. Government does not have a capa~
bility of assessing each and every one of these sources
for foreign intelligence, We can say at this point
that the FBI and CIA are just scratching the surface. ° ©
It is recognized that a program designed to assess .

. or attempt.to recruit each potential source would be
- out of the question. Such a massive undertaking would
: not be compatible with U. S. Government foreign policy.
- There’ is no question that there must be selectivity of
® judicious and prudent nature. 4 | :

Since the U. 8S. is such a major power,
Washington, D. C: is the center of diplomatic activity
involving practically all foreign nations. The location.
of the U. N. in New York City presents us with another
area of intensified activity. Most countries send their
most able diplomats to the U. S. so we are confronted
_with hundreds of highly talented people. The day~to-day
activities in diplomatic establishments, conferences, ee
méetings, negotiations, liaison between countries, all -
. create a tremendous reservoir of foreign intelligence

\ E, CURRENT CAPABILITIES OF CIA IN
: : THE FOREIGN INTELLIGENCE COLLECTION
FIELD IN THE UNITED STATES _ H

i
In order that there may not be any

misunderstanding regarding CIA's capabilities to
collect foreign intelligence in the United ‘States,
we should first clarify that one of the components
. of the Agency which has offices in the United States
does not engage in this particular activity.

The Office of Security, which is responsible for
personnel and physical security, maintains several
offices in the United States under authorized
Treasury Department cover, Personnel of this
office conduct investigations of applicants, firms
or individuals who may be utilized by CIA on

a contract basis to support intelligence operations
overseas,

The overt collection of intelligence by
CIA is handled by the Domestic Contact Service (DCS)
(formerly called Contact Division).:' CIA estimates
_ that DCS has a capability of tapping approximately
an 15 per cent of the total potential of intelligence in
a the U. S, This Division has 18 field offices and
16 resident agencies in the United States, and each
office is openly identizied as being connected with
CIA, Personnel totaling approximately 140 carry CIA
credentials, The Division regularly has a number of
officers from the various military services who are
assigned to this Division on a temporary basis.
These military officers concentrate on the collection
of that foreign intelligence which relates to the
immediate United States military needs. The personnel
of DCS interview aliens, tourists, officials of
import-export firms, students, scientists, and the
information collected covers a very broad spectrum in
the positive intelligence category. DCS.claims to have

‘}Dusinesses and has approximately 60,000 contacts or “*

* gources of information, The information is reported in
- the form of "Information Reports," which is disseminated
. ‘throughout the intelligence community, During’ 1965,

feuues See contact with about 7200 organizations, institutions, or °

|
|

TW 65360 Doclds258G6Ds Pe



DCS disseminated 26,000 such reports. DCS does not : cane
have any responsibilities in the clandestine collection
of intelligence, and in that sense it is very. :
specifically not operational, DCS definitely cannot
engage in any activity of an intornal security nature,
and within CIA it is clearly understood that DCS.is”

. not to be operational under any circumstances, :
DCS has been the subjoct of some controversy within
CIA, There is-one school of thought which maintains
that DCS should be an appendage of the Deputy Director
of Plans, who is responsible for all clandestine
operations, The other school which has prevailed
hoids ‘to the line that DCS should be separate and..
continue under the supervision of the Deputy Director --
of Intelligence (DDI), This situation not only has
caused headaches fox CIA but also for the Bureau because
of situations which arise where the “left hand does not
know what the right hand is doing,"

as DCS is essentially carrying out CIA's a
; responsibilities emanating from National Security Council -
Intelligence Directive (NSCID) No, 2 which has its roots
pour in a simisar direciive issued under tho National
a Intelligence Authority in 1946, It has been in business
ened for approximately twenty years, Per agreement, DCS
cannot interview an alien without first clearing with
the Bureau... This is done on a daily basis, With regard
to American citizens, Bureau approval is not required
: unless the Bureau has indicated a prior interest in the
2', dndividual; however, DCS nevertheless submits name
if checks on Americans, and if it so happens that the
subject of such an inquiry is a Bureau source or
involved in a Bureau investigation, we are in a position
to move to protect our interests, It should be noted
that although.DCS is engaged primarily in positive
intolligence collection, it is required to be. on tho 7
alert for sources who possibly might be useful to CIA's
clandestine operations, For example, if. DCS encounters
an alien who can be utilized in an overseas operation, :
thé lead -is-passed onto the appropriate division...- . ~.

status of this relationship, and we poee iy

make adjustments in order to make certain there

is.no "freewheeling" and to take.advantage of the .
information which DCS gains.and which is of interest ~
to the Buroau. For.example, we are currently working
out arrangements where our field offices can contact
the local DCS offices concerning Chinese aliens who
might be of interest to us either as subjects for
investigation or as potential.informants, This liaison
at the field level was deemed desirable so that we :
could got information at the “horse's mouth" rather
than wait for a reply from CIA headquarters, which is
often prolonged and, when transmitted, is sometimes
Stripped of pieces of information, This occurs
because of the involved and sometimes complicated
maze of bureaucratic compartmentation within CIA,

In the latter part of 1963, CIA created its
Domestic Operations Division (DOD), which was to be

‘responsible for any clandestine development of sources

in the United States, Prior to the establishment of
this Division, CTA activity in this field was managed
from each individual area division at Washington
headquarters, The pressing need for more clandestine
sources, coupled with the recognition of the vast
potential in the United States, prompted CIA to create
Q new division which would be responsible for ali of
the area division interests, DOD has headquarters

at Washington, D. C., and currently has field offices
at New York City, Boston, Chicago, San Francisco,

Los Angeles, Honolulu, and Washington, D, C., proper.
Approximately 40 intelligence officers are assigned to
the task of engaging in assessment and/or recruitment
of positive intelligence sources, primarily in the
diplomatic field, Some of the personnel are assigned
to the handling of firms or organizations which may

_ be supporting certain CIA operations abroad, DOD personnel

in the field operate under authorized Department of Defense
cover, The heads of these field offices are known to us,
and we have established a satisfactory liaison area at

the field level, Tree

DOD is also responsible for the handling of
CIA agents (informants) who have been reeruited abroad
and who come to the United States for assignments either
on a temporary basis or for the duration of a normal
diplomatic assignment, : : seeueet

The creation of DOP within CIA was and still
is a somewhat controversial Agency subject, DCS saw
DOD as an interfering element, The area desks wore
reluctant to have a new division to take over thoir
‘ agents, Some of the DOD porsonnel are vory capable
and seasoned intelligence officers, Many of then\are
considered of mediocre capability, and there is \
a frequent rumor that other CIA divisions send their
misfits to DOD, From CiA’s standpoint there appears
to be a definite need for a much stronger team within DOD.
Theoretically, DOD is required to be on tho
alert for all potential sources who can be used by CIA
in its intelligence operations, and the approach is
basically one of a long-range nature, DOD is required
: to make use of-all leads emanating from fellow employees
. E who may have developed social contacts or associations
with foreigners abroad or who might meet potential .
sources in the United States, Since CIA personnel
’ operate under diplomatic cover when abroad, they do get
the opportunity to move in diplomatic circles, Similarly,
undercover agents of CTA traveling throughout the world
. |, @lso make contacts which offer potential exploitation if
C and when the target stops in the United States,

it

Since January, 1964, when DOD actually began
moving, it has recruited approximately ten individuals
in the diplomatic field. Most of these were in the
nonconmunist-bloc area, AI1l of those recruited appear
to have been in a fairly low-level category. Ali of them
were carcer diplomats, and there was no evidence that
the individuals were connected with any intelligence
service,

In addition to the activities of DCS and DOD,
there is a certain amount of CIA operational movements ‘
which do not fall under either of the foregoing divisions,
One example is the CIA base in Miami which was set up
_. for CIA's operations directed against the Cuban Government.
fan This base is used for the training and dispatching of
u : agents into Cuba and to some extent into other countries
in the Caribbean, particularly the Dominican Republic,
This base is directly responsible to the Western
Hemisphere Division of CIA, which could be called the
Latin American Pree

CIA also becomes involved in political and 2
psychological warfare type of programs directed against
targets in foreign countries, The Agency broadly refers
to this activity as "covert action," The’ programs are
essontially dosignod to influence individuals, organizations
or governments through various news media, and this will
include the utilization of "agents of influence," This
activity falls under the International Organizations
Division (10D). of CIA, which has no responsibility to
collect information, I0D does use people in the
United States to help implement the overseas programs,

| Quite often the Agency uses cutouts or covers for such
.an operation, Althcigh IOD does not engage in intelligence
collection, it is a CIA division which should be kept in
mind, since its activities quite often will be tangent to
matters of interest to the Bureau, For example, IOD
pecomes involved in the World Youth Festival, where its
objective is to neutralize communist influence. We, of
course, have had an interest in the Festival because of the
7 participation of Americans, including members of the CPUSA,
i Theoretically, IOD is required to coordinate closely with
other appropriate components of CIA. We do not believe
that this coordination has peen effective enough.

There is no doubt that there are individuals
in CIA who aspire to broaden the Agency's operational
activities in the United States, Such individuals would
like to see an arrangement Similar to one currently in
force in England where MI~G has a free hand to assess and
recruit all foreigners, including diplomats, where there
is no evidence that they are engaged in intelligence
-activity., If such evidence is obtained, MI-6 is required
to coordinate with MI-5, There are people in CIA who
would like to see similar machinery and in addition would
want the freedom to conduct certain investigations and if
maybe even institute technical surveillances.

In summary, CIA so far has a very limited
capability to recruit foreign diplomatic sources in the

_ well with a relatively small staff; however, it can be
anticipated that this capability will increase, CIA's
effectiveness will probably be adversely affected for

‘ _' gome time to come because of the Agency's well~known

-""" """" s deficiencies, such as lack of discipline, loose admin~ ~

panert - adstration, and lack of skilled and talented personnel. _

F. CURRENT CAPABILITIES OF THE Fai

1. Manpower Being Devoted

It is most difficult to |lgive any specific figures as to
how much manpower the FBI is currently devoting strictly to
foreign intelligence collection, separate and apart from the
Bureau's internal security xnd counterintelligence functions.
Much of the foreign intelligence developed by .the Bureau is\an
outgrowth of our internal security investigations and cannot\be
neatly separated in terms of manpower or time.

A substantial amount of our foreign intelligence activity
is concentrated in two offices where most of the diplomatic
. establishments in the United States are located; namely, New York |
“and Washington Field. Both offices were requested to furnish
estimates as to how much manpower is being allocated to foreign
intelligence matters,’ including both live sources developed and
technical coverage. In both cases, the estimates provided were
: highly tentative and both c‘fices stress that manpower commitments
in this area fluctuate widely from week to week depending on
international politics and other unpredictable factors. For
instance, during the. Cuban missile crisis of 1962, both offices
greatly increased their normal manpower commitment to the develops
| ; ment or current roreign intelligence. The present: vominican crisis
Cs which involves production of foreign intelligence to a large extent
represents another "abnormal" situation.

However, ‘for what it is worth, WFO and New York have
estimated that at. the present time they are allocating approxi-
mately 35 Agents and 20 clerical employees to the full time task '
of foreign intelligence collection. Virtually all of the clerical
time and about 40 per cent of the Agent time is related to
technical coverage and the balance is aimed at the development of

_ Live sources,

In addition, of course, all of the other offices, including
our Legal Attaches abroad, have devoted manpower to foreign
intelligence collection in varying degrees. Anagram Pperations © “

conducted in different field offices have invéived e assignment
of as many .as 10 or 12 Agents for temporary periods. In connection
with’ its’ responsibilities in”thé Cuban and Latin-American fields, *
the Miami and San Juan offices have devoted considerable manpower
to ‘the development’ of foreign intelligence in recent years. The
Chicago Office in connection with its handling of our [top-level

- Bololinformant has devoted manpower to the development of foreign

' “intelligence. : These represent only’a few examples. Peer

4 Von: an overall. basis and pearing ‘in niind the “aitficulty: Lin ”

citing any precise figures, it is estimated that the Bureau probably :

averages approximately 50 to 75 Agents and 25 to 30 clerks assigned
primarily to foreign ant elligence work. Wy

AS
2.Number of Microphone and Telephone Surveillances with
wvaluation of roauct

At present, Bureau has only one microphone surveillance in
foreign intelligence field and this is in connection with a special
National Security Agency project directed against Turkish] coded
communications, Concerning technical survoillancts, wo are now
operating about 70 foreign intelligence installations on various
diplomatic establishments in this country. The majority of these

are in Washington Field and New York with scattered installations
in Chicago, Miami, Pittsburgh, San Francisco and San Juan. Under
current Bureau policy, we are limited to 80 foreign intelligence

technical surveillances and no microphone surveillances with the |
exception of one on the|Turkish United Nations Wission]

In addition, during recent years, we have maintained
approximately 50 so-called "telex" surveillances on the teletype
facilities of various foreign establishments. This has been done
at the specific request of the National Security Agency, in
connection with its efforts to break foreign codes and to read
foreign government communications,

We have had excellent results from these technical
installations. Any compilation of items of value to the U.S.

- Intelligence Community and policy-making otticiais developed
through this coverage would run many hundreds of pages. The results
have ranged from information regarding plans and activities of
Key foreign countries in the diplomatic field to information
regarding intelligence, political, economic and military develop~
ments in the countries concerned. In many instances, we have been
able to forewarn the White House, the State Department and other
interested agencies of impending developments and to furnish data
‘giving an insight into the thinking and strategy of key foreign
officials and governments. This coverage has proved specially
valuable during crisis periods such as the Cuban missile crisis of
°1962 and.during the tense negotiations involving the Panama Canal
in 1964. On many occasions, top-ranking United States officials
have commented on the effectiveness of this data. The particular
importance of this information has been its timeliness to current
events as well as the fact that it represents a penetztion of
foreign diplomatic circles which is only infrequently Ayan tep eH

~ through” live ‘sources.: ." °°" ae

In some instances, of course, this type coverage on a

particular foreign establishment or official has not paid off.

We have had cases where this technique has been unproductive for
“sustained periods of time on a‘particular country. This is to be
expected and we have sought.to overcome this by rotating our
‘installations, correlating our technical operations with shifting
international developments and putting coverage on those countries
which appear to offer the most promise for worthwhile intelligence.

3, Liye Sources With Evaluation

At present we are making active efforts to develop live -
informant coverage in the diplomatic establishments of 37 non=- —~
Soviet bloc countries. This list of so-called “target countries"
varies from time to time but essentially we are seeking informant
coverage in countries considered critical from an intelligence
standpoint such as those leaning towards the Soviet bloc or
countries in which the United States has paramount political or
nilitary interests or which‘are otherwise of primary concern, ‘The
eurrent list includes virtually all Latin-American countries, a
number of Middle East countries, and scattered countries throughout
Africa andthe Far East.

Our program was initiated in the early 1950s, and we

‘are now using some 50 sources (This number fluctuates due to
. transfers, resignations, etc,).. In each case, we clear with

State Department prior to designating any country as a “target"
and we also clear with State prior to conducting interviews with
employees at the "target" establishment. In a number of instances,
including most Latin-American countries, State has asked us to
restrict our efforts to American citizens. This, of course, is

a highly limiting factor. : :

Qver the years this live informant coverage has on many
occasions produced foreign intelligence of r@l value. Our sources
have frequently provided data regarding proposed political,
diplomatic or economic action by the countries concerned, on
occasion in advance of other forewarning to U.S. intelligence.
They have also been able to furnish a considerable amount of
information regarding the whereabouts, background and general
activities of individual foreign officials of security interest,
thereby saving investigative time. These sources have been
especially valuable in connection with the JAnagram Program and
other sophisticated attacks on foreign establishments, providing
us with data regarding the physical security, location of code
rooms, etc., of the various foreign establishments.

In addition to so-called "target" countries which are
in the non-Soviet bloc area, the Bureau has developed a number of
‘informants and defectors-in-place in Soviet~bloc establishments

\mho have been able to furnish a substantial amount of foreign
‘Gntelligence. Inthe ‘Soviet-pléd field; we have'also developed” ~~ ~

a number of sources in quasi-official establishments, such as :
trade missions, who have produced valuable foreign intelligence,

In the Soviet-bloc field, of course, our live informant development
has been aimed essentially at internal security and countsrintelli-

gence “needs of the Bureau.

rt is significant that we have been able to operate for
many years in the development of live sources in foreign diplomatic
est&lishments, both Soviet bloc and non-bloc, without encountering
any serious incidents embarrassing to the FBI or the United States
Government.

In assessing the product of such live sources in a number
of instances in the non-Sov..et field, State Department has
requested that we restrict our efforts to American citizens. To
f a considerable degree, this has limited the effectiveness of our

program in theron-Soviet field since U.S, employees of foreign

establishments will normaily not have access to top-grade data.

Thus, especially in the non-Soviet bloc field we are not tapping

the full potential which exists for high-level foreign intelligence.
. This can only be realized through the development of high quality

sources,
4. [2 agram Program
Anagram is code word for FBI program to penetrate foreign
diplomatic establishments in U.S, for purpose of securing crypto
graphic material. This material is primarily of value to National
Security Agency in its communications’ intelligence efforts. 7
Since inception of program in 1954, we have conducted Anagram
operations involving 38 different foreign countries and a total ox
( 57 separate establishments. Approximately 10 FBI field offices '
4 have participated in the program. Our operations under this
program have resulted in mon¢tory savings to the Government estimated +
at better than $13,000,000 and it has provided data of incalculable
intelligerice value. While it has been of primary value to NSA, we
have on occasion produced information of primary interest to the
Bureau. For example, in April, 1963, we affected a successful
penetration in the Polish field which produced material disclosing
the activities of Polish Intelligence Service in this country. _

. 5. ‘pouble Agents and Informants Pa :
In a number of instances, Bureau double agents and informants,
_ developed to assist us in connection with our internal security and

. counterintelligence responsibilities, have been. able to provide

7 significant high-level information ef foreign intelligence value.

For example, in the Soviet field, we have developed a
number of top-level sources such as]/¥Fedora and Tophat} who have
provided current intelligence regarding the organizational structure,

.....personnel, and operations of the KGB and GRU, both in the Soviet

“ “Union and abroad; a description of various technical equipment used -

_....by Soviet intelligence; data regarding current. relations between, the ._-

Soviet Union and Communist China; and data regarding Soviet foreign

policy, political and military developments, etc. Similar informa-
tion of foreign intelligence value has been developed through FBI

a informants, double agents and defectors~in~place operating against

jiaes

Polish, Yugoslav, Czechoslovakian and other communist-—bloc

| countries. For instance, im the Cuban field on several occasions,
FBI informants have been able to develop high-level or current —-

| intelligence regarding conditions in Cuba, and policies of the

Castro regime through personal contacts with ranking Cuban officials :

| both in the U,S. and abroad.

| : Through our coverage of the Communist Party, USA, and
.- velated organizations we have also frequently produced foreign
i intelligence, although to a lesser extent than in our operations in,
| the foreign nationality field, One of our best sources of foreign
° intelligence in the domestic area is our so~galled /Solo operation
f wherein we have informants acting in a [Liaison[capagity between the
Communist Party, USA; and foreign communist groups, including the

. Communist Party of the Soviet Union. We have developed information
fio through this operation regarding the Sino-Soviet dispute, social
FF and political conditions in various countries, both in and outside

: the Soviet bloc, and tactics of the international communist movement.

| 6, Additional Potential

|: . As indicated in the foregoing subsections, the Bureau is
currently producing a considerable volume of foreign intelligence
through covert means, much of it of a significant nature, Most of
this data 1s an outgrowth of inuformauis, iccluical coverages and

investigative programs targeted primarily to fulfiil our internal
security and counterintelligence objectives and relatively speaking,
we have committed only a small percentage of our assets exclusively

in the direction of foreign intelligence.

It is believed that the Bureau possesses considerable

- potential for the development of foreign intelligence which could
| : be realized with a fairly modest expenditure of manpower and costs
: if we were to make foreign intelligence collection a primary aim.

| For example, with existing egulpment and facilities, we could
‘expand our technical coverage of foreign establishments to include aj
additional 30 to 40 foreign establishments provided we could assign
| about 25 additional personnel to this field. With the assignment
E of an additional 75 to 100 Agents, we could greatly intensify our
foreign intelligence collection through live informants, primarily

’ through the development and exploitation of additional sources at
sixeforeign diplomatic establishments. .We-.could-place more stress..on. _,
foreign intelligence collection in our training programs and

conferences to make more effective use of our already available ass:
We could, for example, add specialized classes on foreign intellige
collection to our In-Service schedules or designate selected Bureau

ions operated by. other U.S. agenci

- personnel - to. attend -training -sess:
regarding this subject. | E

G, AREAS OF CONFLICT, FBI - CIA

Any differences between FBI and CIA are first
related to a basic problem existing in any country among
the major powers, namely. "How does a law enforcement
agency coordinate its internal security functions with an
intelligence organization which must operate as a clandestine
service?" The very nature of the functions of the two
organizations immediately introduces potential areas of
conflict, One essentially operates overtly and the other
covertly. This alone is enough to create an atmosphere
fraught with controversies and confusion, Because each
agency was molded differently and because responsibilities
differ, there naturally will be conflicting approaches to
national security objectives, For example, in the field
of intelligence the Bureau is basically a counterintelligence
body. CIA, to the contrary, has a much broader responsibility
in intelligence, which includes collection of foreign
intelligence, political and psychological warfare, inter~

as agency coordinating, evaluation, research, etc. Counter=
intelligence within CIA is actually a relatively small
component of the agency. Personnel in the two organizations
is recruited uuder different criteria aad staudasds,
Training is likewise at variance. In a final analysis,

c ) the experienced FBI Agent and the seasoned CIA intelligence
officer are not of the same mold but certainly are tailored
as two entirely and distinctly different instruments. We
should bear in mind that little has been done to introduce
truly substantive cross-fertilization of outlook, approach
and operational philosophy between the two agencies. This

- could be advocated from a Utopian point of view, but it
. .also could be argued that there are distinct advantages to
maintaining sound compartmentation,

Separate from the above basic and fundamental
situation, the differences between FBI and CIA also relate
to other factors such as: Pee

: 1) FBI was first on the scene and was well
«eos, «a + @Stablished long before CIA.came to Life.:. This. led to a
: conception in the early years that CIA was an intruder,

2) The seed of CIA was the Office of Strategic
Services (OSS), an organization whose personnel, activities

with the Bureau during World War II. It was during
these years that an atmosphere of innaedbaatuushe and lack of
confidence was created,

3) CXA was established as our first oversall,

_ worldwide intelligence agency. The events and the

maneuvering which led to this certainly.did not bring
with them a harmonious relationship.

4) Unfortunately, CIA grew big and grew fast,
particularly because of an unsettled atomic world and
developments such as the Korean War. The Agency did not
jell effectively as an organization, and with this came

.. numerous difficulties, many of which exist to this day.

5) Each organization has lacked adequate
knowledge of the other's operational machinery, objectives,
and “Ways and means of doing things."

6) An element of rivalry actually developed over

” the years, and this, when not tempered with prudence and

sound judgment, creates unhealthy situations,

7) +A growing tendency on the part of CIA to
expand its operational activities not originally contemplated

-in the Zormation of that agency.

It can be recognized that with this background it
has not been an easy matter to establish a good working
relationship with CIA without frequent conflicts, and
sometimes agonizing negotiations. It could be suggested
that the ideal situation would be to remove CIA from the -
U. S, with the understanding that we would assume respon-
sibility for any and all activity in the intelligence field.
As described in another section of this report, such a
move would be highly infeasible for the Bureau.

It is to our credit that despite the problems of

. the past there have been some highly constructive develop=
‘ments “in FBI-CIA- relations, pairtictilarly as: they affect: ~
+ activities in the U. S. Several years ago arrangements

were made whereby CIA's Office of Security could conduct

applicant investigations without infringing upon our juris~
diction. Tor several years we have been permitting CIA to

mechanism has been functioning effectively. \We have at
frequent conferences, Bureau personnel lectures beforo
CIA officers, Dissemination of information is excellont,
The atmosphere for negotiating and discussing unusually
complicated problems is ‘very good. Personnel can work in
the same area with a minimum of problems, as evidenced in
the Dominican Republic, We attend USIB meetings and tro
actively engaged in the work of several committees attached
to USIB, All of this is commendable progress and certainly
beneficial to national security, y
All of the foregoing was set forth in the way of
background in order to: better understand the current source
of differences with CIA, namely the Agency's desire to assess
and recruit foreign intelligence sources in the U.S. in the
foreign diplomatic establishments, including United Nations, -
and to some extent among foreign visitors. CIA fully
acknowledges our internal security and counterintelligonce
responsibilities. Tnis is clear-cut and free of any
debatable question; however, CIA.feels that we have no:
legally-established responsibility in foreign intellifronce
eallection and that somebody (in this case, CIA) should
be fully exploiting the foreign intelligence potential in
the United States, bearing in mind that there are approxi-
mately 10,000 foreign officials and employees in this country.”
CIA argues that a foreign diplomat can be recruited anywhere

_in the world but maintains that there is no better place

than the United States for assessment, recruitment, training
and orientation of an informant. CIA further maintains that
if the Agency moves on a target, such as an Argentino

_ diplomat who may be a career officer not connected with a

foreign intelligence service, there should not be any con»
flict because the activity is in no way related to tha
internal security functions of the Bureau. CIA has also
expressed the attitude that in the communist-bloc fiold
CIA should be permitted to assess and recruit those
individuals not connected with an intelligence or intornal
security service. 7 ci

’ Phere are some people in CIA who are of tho «72° -
opinion that in the field of foreign intelligence tho Bureau.
should be exerting more effort to actually assist CIA in :

‘spotting sources and, when needed, give CIA support in

developing an individual through such means as surveillances,
neighborhood investigations, etc.. When CIA is permittad to

6 an ‘ e i

5 - ‘ yeeruit a source in the U. S., the Agency takes the ial
\ position that if the source can be of help to the Bureau’
we should levy requirements on CIA and not ask for access
‘to the source unless it clearly appears that only through
access We can properly discharge our responsibilities. .
CIA takes a very strong. view that once a source is
developed it is basically unsound to introduce another
agency into the relationship. The developing agency
may have used techniques peculiar to its own organization
and may have developed a relationship under varied cir~
cumstances, and when a new agency is introduced this
relationship with the source could be unfavorably disturbed.
CIA does not dispute the fact that informant and Agent
- turnovers sometimes are absolutely necessary. :

CIA maintains that if the Bureau is given access
to a CIA source we would be responsible for the counter~
intelligence aspects, but if the source produces foreign

- intelligence CIA shculd be responsible for handling this
information, including the dissemination. CIA's position

’ is that it is better qualified to evaluate the information
and correlate it with the foreign intelligence being
Heveloned ahroad, For example, if a Nigerian source of CIA;
also available to the Bureau, furnishes information vegarding
the Nigerian Foreign Office, CIA claims that it can better
handle the report and dissemination. /

Discussions and agreements with CIA, including xaed
the actions stemming from meetings with ‘the representatives
of that agency in November 1965, have resulted in a greatly
.,’ « improved coordinating machinery. There still are areas of

* potential conflict which will necessitate improvement.

PESSSEEEAneeE

1) DOD personnel receives leads or tips pertaining
to possible access to Soviet-bloc diplomats, This CIA
Division pursues these leads and is inclined to take the
position that such individuals contacted by CIA are their
"CIA-controlled sources." If we permitted this to go on
over a period of time, CIA would have a vast network of
sources not directly available to the Bureau. This is
basically unsound, and there is no reason CIA shouldn't
immediately give us the lead or tip for exploitation.

We can recognize that, depending upon circumstances, it
might be favorable to us and CIA for the Agency to handle
a particular individual, and if so, it would be clearly

individual in any way was connected with or associated

2) DOD is anxious to have freedom to assess
and recruit Bloc diplomats not known to be engaged in
intelligence activity. On the surface,’ this does not
appear to present a problem, but realistically speaking
it is impossible for us to know that a Soviet diplomat,
not known to be engaged in intelligence activity one
day, appears on the scene the following week as an agent
or coopted agent. To give CIA wide latitude in this field

: could create a truly undesirable mess. We believe that
if CIA is permitted to move on such targets it should be
eet done on a selective basis and with maximum coordination.

| _ #. CURRENT AGREEMENTS BETWEEN FBI AND CIA |

1. According to SAC Letter 59 dated 5/24/49, CIA and FBI
had reached agreement whereby clearance would be requested of FBI
pofore CIA conducted an intorview with an alion in the U.S, This
clearance would consist of a review of Bureau files concerning
individual in question.

According to same SAC Letter, agreement had been reached

by the FBY and CIA whereby CIA was allowed to contact American
businessmen without obtaining clearance from FBI in order t9
obtain positive foreign intelligence information and arrange covers
. for CIA personnel abroad. This agreement was based strictly on
collection of foreign intelligence and positively did not allow for
the formulation of a network of confidential informants for CIA

in the U.S.

Regarding FBI-CIA agreement that CIA would clear with us
prior to interviewing aliens in U.S., following documentation has
been located. By letter 2/19/48 Director of CIA Hillenkoetter
wrote Director and referred to National Security Council Intelli-
gence Directive No. 7, 2/12/48. This Directive states in part that
CIA will be respousible fur cagoitation on highly sclective basis.

- within U.S. of business concerns, other nongovernmental organiza~
< , tions and individuals es sources of foreign intelligence information.
Hillenkoetter commented that CIA had been interviewing foreign
businessmen, immigrants and refugees on small scale, always clearing
matter first with FBI office in area concerned. He asked Director's
views as to possible expansion of this activity.

By letter 2/26/48 Director replied to Hillenkoetter., In
part, this letter pointed out FBI had no objection to CIA intere
viewing individuals enumerated above for foreign intelligence
“purposes; however, it was suggested that prior to interview such
individual matters be cleared with FBI Headquarters.

2. Bureau letter to CIA 1/16/64 confirmed results of meetings
between CIA and Bureau via liaison in discussing reorganization of
CIA's Domestic Operations Division (DOD). Letter recognized CIA

a. CIA would not conduct investigation of any foreign
official in U.S. and if CIA felt such investigation warranted, ¥BI
should. be consulted,

b. No foreign official would be approached for recruit-
ment by CIA without its conferring with FBI.

ce. When CIA agent arrives in U.S. for visit or assign
ment, FBI will be advised and two agencies will confer regarding
handling of agent in this country, it being recognized each case
‘has its individual peculiarities,

ad. Before approaching any foreign official or visitor for
recruitment assessment, CIA will clear with FBI.

3. AS result of conference with CIA in January, 1966, the
above “ground rules” were modified and expanded arid agreed upon by
both agencies early this year (Confirmed by letter to Admiral
Raborn 2/7/66, New ground rules in summary are as follows:

a. CIA will not intiate investigation of any foreign
official in U.S.. without concurrence of FBI. (Comment: This is
essentially same as (a) in January, 1964, ground rules. Only
difference is that wording of this modification implies more
Sympathetic FBI attitude towards any proposed CiA investigations.)

: “b., CIA will seek FBI concurrence before approaching for
recruitment any foreign official or communist bloc visitor in U.S.
FBI will concur if CIA action does not conflict with any FBI
operations. (Comment: This is similar to (b) and (c) ground rules
- adopted in January, 1964, with two differences. First, it drops
requirement that ClAsclear with us before approaching a non-Soviet
_ visitor although it must still do so with regard to non-Soviet
‘ officials. Secondly, it specifically commits the FBI to concur if
proposed CIA action does not conflict with FBI operations.)

.¢. CIA will advise FBI prior to meetings between CIA
assets and foreign officials or communist bloc visitors of interest
to FBI. (Comment:' This was not included : in Gcahetieaehual set of
ground rules.)

. however, continue its contractual relationship for purpose of handling

lining adde fulfillment of CIA commitments to the agent and

. preparation for next assignment abroad.

. £. Where CIA wiil be handling its agent in U.S., CIA
will service FBX security or counterintelligence requirements and
will provide FBI all information bearing on counterintelligence or
internal security matters. Where CIA servicing is inadequate for
FBI internal security interests, FBI will have direct access to
agent. (Comment: Rules (ad), (e) and (£) represent greatly expanded
‘and refined version of rule (c) of January, 1964, agreement. Old
.ground rules provided considerable latitude with regard to who \
would handle CIA source in the U.S. and this has led to some as
disagreements with CIA. The current ground rules clearly provide
Zor CIA to retain contact with its agents not only for training,
financing, etc., but also for "procurement of positive foreign
intelligence." In addition, they make it clear that the FBI should
not ask for direct access unless Adeiiatal is a specific internal
security need.) :

{

4. In addition to the above, there is one agreement we have
reached with CIA which is of possible relevance; namely, our recent
c . agreement relative to treatment of Soviet students in the U.S,

i“ By way of background, there are a number of Soviet exchange students |
currently attending various U.S. universities. Each student, of i
course, is not only a possible Soviet intelligence agent’ but also 4
a potential source for the U.S. after he returns to his homeland.
Accordingly, both FBI and CIA have an interest in these students.

‘ Per memo dated 1/14/64 we advised CIA via liaison on 1/20/64
that the Bureau would adopt following procedure relative to Soviet
students here. FBI will take responsibility for collecting material
‘regarding each student on expedite basis, furnishing results to

CIA as developed. At logical point FBI will confer with CIA to
decide on case-by-case basis re possible recruitment. If Bureau
recruits Soviet student, wc will resolve whether we should turn

him over to CIA before he leaves U.S. Under this procedure, CIA
will not make any inquiries (through its sources in U.S. ) unless

I, EFFECT ON THE FBI OF FULL RESPONSIBILITY FOR COLLECTION
OF FOREIGN INTELLIGENCE LN THE ONTTS
z !

1. Overt Collection Activities !

: j
It is evident from the National Security Act of
i 1947 and the succeeding National Security Council Intelligence
| Directives as well as the directives of the Director of
Central Intelligence that Centrai Intelligence Agency (CIA)
is charged with major responsibilities in the overt collection
of foreign intelligence in the United States, In pursuit of
this, CIA exploits non-governmental organizations and 7
individuais, foreign language publications and aliens, Although 7
CIA claims to have contacts with about 7,200 organizations -
and businesses as well as about 60,000 sources of information
‘as a vesult of its overt activities for this purpose, CIA
estimates it is reaching only 15 per cent of the foreign
intelligence information available in this country.

The question we must consider here is whether the
FBI should take over the overt collection of foreign intelligence
in the United states, thereby makiug CiA acional only in
" areas outside the limits of FBI's jurisdiction. In this
“ connection, the following would have to be considered:

Ne.

(a) Reporting: i

. The Bureau is a fact-finding agency which has
traditionally gathered evidence and presented its findings
without bias or conclusions, This would not change.
Intelligence developed by the FBI would be evaluated by the H i
users in the intelligence community. Our report writing i

. format might have to be geared to the needs and established |

“ procedures of the United States intelligence community.

(b) Coordination With Other Government Agencies:

Foreign intelligence is a commodity produced for
‘ithe betiefit’ of many: ‘separate-agencies-of. the. United States... ...
_ Goyernment, . Because of this, if the Bureau were to have.

intelligence in this country, ‘wé Would have-to greatly
expand our liaison services, not only for dissemination
* purposes but to assure that’ we are kept fully informed rs:
~ Regarding. th intelligence priorities, — j

| ‘
_Nwv 65360" TiocId232889829 “Page"355



Our role in preparation of National Intelligence Estimates 7

would be more active as a result of our increased contribution

under this program. It might be necessary to utilize the

assistance of highly trained personnel of other agencies to

assist us poriodically on interviews dealing with complicated

military or scientific matters. PEE
(ec) Manpower: : 7 if

While no manpower requirements can be presently

estimated should we assume full responsibility for overt :
foreign intelligence collection, CIA is currently using 7
approximately 140] enployeos throughout the United States to
interview indfvidtals in connection with its overt intelligence *
gathering activities, and is reaching what it estimates to be’
only 18 x cent of available foreign intelligence information.
These [140 CIA employees do not include personnel required at
CIA Headquarters to correlate, evaluate and disseminate the
data gathered in the field. We would want to more effectively
vexploit this intelligence potential,

To merely handle the necessary review of the vast
_ + number of foreign language puolications wouid require many
CG additional employees proficient in foreign languages and
with backgrounds in scientific or technical fields.

(ad) Selection and Training of Personnel:

To assume full responsibility for the overt
collection of foreign intelligence in this country, would
require that we vastly broaden our selection and training
procedures, We would require applicants with degrees in
the sciences, languages, history, government and economics.
Our basic training and In-Service agenda would have to be
geared to meet our new responsibilities. We would undoubtedly
desire to utilize the services of outstanding lecturers from
the agencies constituting our intelligence community, and in
turn, we would wish to afford our personnel training at the
War Colleges operated by the Department of Defense, and from ‘

“ime to time furnish them- the-opportunity -of- specialized
_ training. and briefings, provided by.the members of the U. S._

intelligence relating to the national security and to provide
for appropriate dissemination of such intelligence within the
Government. This is set out in Title 50, USC, Section 40%

» The overt collection of foreign intelligence is not the subject
of legislation but rather of National Security Council Intelligence
Directives which would have to be revised in order to give sind
Bureau this authority now lodged with CIA.

(£2) Organizational Changes:

To carry out a program committing the Bureau to

the full responsibility for the overt collecting of foreign
intelligence in this country would necessitate a substantial
increase to the headquarters staffs of the Domestic Intelli-~
gence Division and the Laboratory Divison, as well to the.
personnel assigned to the New York and Washington Field Offices
where diplomatic establishments and international organizations
- are mainly located In all probability the creation of a new

division at the Seat of Government devoted entirely to overt
~ + collection responsibilities, would be required.

(e) Legislation:

CIA currently has the duty to correlate and evaluate
t
i

cen

(g) Observations:

The many responsibilities that would be ours under

@ program making the Bureau accountable for the overt collection
of all foreign intelligence in this country would (1) require

an enormous increase in our own personnel, trained in many
specialized fields, or (2) the delegation of varied intelligence
. functions to other governmental agencies and close supervision
_of such agencies to insure efficient execution of the tasks

levied upon them. These overt collection responsibilities

would undoubtedly be subject to the scrutiny of many sources,

some of them hostile, and we would have to face the charges,

unjust though they might be, that the Bureau had ceased to

perform the duties for which it was originally created and.

had developed into a gigantic bureaucratic octopus.

2. Clandestine Gathering Acti.

There are no statutory provisions for the clandestine
gathering of foreign intelligence in the United States. We
have in the past produced substantial foreign intelligence
while carrying out our present responsibilities.

CIA established its Domestic Operations Division (DOD)
in 1963 and began to clandestinely gather foreign intelligence
in this country. It now has /Siz) field offices with approximately

“= 19 =

cN;

——N\W.65360—Docld:32989629-Rage-35%————————----



40 intelligence officers assigned to these matters. It is
antidpated that DOD's efforts will become more extensive,

CIA estimates there are approximately 10,000 employees
and dependents assigned to the diplomatic establishments and
international organizations represented in this country by

7 approximately 120 foreign nations. It can readily be seon that
woe would have to establish priorities and well-defined objectives
_in order to cope effectively with the probiem presented by the
vast number of persons and establishments which could be
considered for clandestine coverage. a

Today there are approximately 40 nations in addition».
to the Soviet-bloc countries, whose establishments in this
‘country we consider "target" countries for the purpose of
developing live sources therein. In the absence of more
precise criteria, our initial efforts in a program designed
to expand our clandestine gathering of foreign intelligence,
could be directed against these "target" nations.

(a) Objectives:

-Under a program confined to the clandestine gathering

eS i of foreign intelligence in this country, and consistent with
the intelligence needs of this «Government, we would have as_ 7 7
- our objectives: : Z i q

| . (1) Increasing substantially the number of live

| : sources of high quality in diplomatic establishments,
trade missions, consular offices or international
organizations located within the United States;

. 7 7 (2) Expanding our present technical and microphone
coverage in such establishments.

seer ( We would, of course, maintain our "Anagram" program

: which has~been so successful in the clandestine acquisition of
the cryptographic systems of various foreign nations, as well
as our "Telex" program which is the technical covera: we afford
the teletype facilities of certain foreign countries. /

NWP65360—Docld:32989629- Page 358



(b) Observations:

While a program limited to the clandestine gathering
of foreign intelligence would require a substantial inerease
in manpower, both in the field and at the Bureau's headquarters,
as well as an expansion o_ our personnel selection and training
procedures, our liaison responsibilities and our filing and
data processing facilities, however; in none of these phases
would the increase be nearly as great as that which would be
required should we assume full responsibility for the overt
gathering of such foreign intelligence. o

produced the following significant findings:

‘(L) There definitely is a-vast potential

the. capapi MBses of the Bureau, the’ @e nds arrived

for us to adopt and implement a new conceptitoward ba
foreign intelligence collection, It would Ke unwise

if the Bureau did not move into a leading role and

instead applied policy and tactics conforming with

a “holding action." This, in oux opinion, jis not
consistent with the reputation of @ progressive and
forward locking organization,

(10) The Bureau does ‘hav talent and
capability to assume a more active role in clandestine
collection of foreign intelligence,” We have the
potential to handle clandestine collection of foreign
intelligence in the U. S, in a more effective manner
than any other agency, This can be done in a constructive
and prudent manner, :

(11) 4&it is recognized that a new approach by
the Bureau will involve operational risks, If one is
to progress, he must take risks, We feel that we have
the capability to succeed with a minimum of losses
or debits, i

(12) We feel that if we do not adopt a new
vole characterized with an aggressive approach, a door
is left open for other agencies such as CIA to cf

‘progressivaly introduce programs designed to fill the
- vacuum, CIA currently does not have the capability

to inject a rapid "take-over" of operational areas,
We do feel that such would be accelerated not by CIA's
strength, but by our weaknesses,

(13) CIA is progressively expanding its
objectives and capabilities to conduct clandestine
intelligence operations in the U. S. This presents
a potential for areas of conflict between CIA and FBI.

(14) We definitely must define our role in
the field of clandestine foreign intelligence collection
so that policy and objectives are clear-cut,. Not only
our own personnel but other agencies including CIA should
Enow exactly where we stand,

(15) CIA can be permitted to develop
Clandestine sotirces of foreign intelligence under the

i ~ 84 =



established ground rules which do protect Bureau 5
iaterests, A new approach being recommended would

heavily deter CIA from extensive development of
clandestine sources and would really leave the

-Agency in a minor or subordinate role,

Dacld:32989629- Page 363



_ K. RECOUMENDED PLAN OF ACTION \

A penetrative and objective study of the
Bureau's position has led us to conclude that the Bureau
should play a much more active and influential role in
the clandestine collection of positive intelligence in the
United States. We are recommending the implementation of
a plan which will lead to a valuable dontribution to our 7
national security effort and concurrently will improve our
internal security capabilities. This plan presents 4
concept of an FBI as an Agency primarily responsible \for
internal security, but supplementing its coverage with a
substantially expanded capability in the clandestine collec~
tion of positive intelligence. We believe that we have the
‘capability of developing this new look knowing that at the
same time we can institute a badly needed leadership to
eliminate a gap in the acquirement of high-quality intelli-
_. gence in the United States, The main features of this plan
are; :

1) Establishment of a list of foreign diplomatic
targets consistent with the needs of the Government.

2) Expansion of our technical surveillance
ho. . capabilities with emphasis on misurs.

expressed in general terms, This same authorization could-
be further defined by the President's Foreign Intelligence

Selection of Targets

Priority on targets can be established by appli-~

-cation of the following eriterias

1) Review of requests or requirements levied on

us bythe President and'U. S. Intelligence Agencies.

2) Review of priority listed by the USIB. (This
is done om a regular basis.)

3) Our own analycis ond evaluation of international
political developments. This primarily will be done at SOG,
but we should be so organized that the field would be free

‘to submit recommendations.

a reryee Surveillance of Targets

7 Coverage in this field will be divided into the

| following categories:

: Technical Surveiitances {

7 2) Microphone Surveillances y

| . 8) More sophisticated beards monitoring,

i.e, code machines,

At the present time we are handling a very limited
mumber of installations. With existing capabilities, we
could virtually double our present technical covera:

Once we have established reasonable priority Listing; ° “ht
is believed we should systematically expand our operations.
In this connection, the following should be borne in mind:

7 1) Heavy emphasis should be placed on microphone
surveillances.

2) Today we are placing greater stress on
coverage of official establishments. The new program asks
for an expansion of coverage on individuals and/or residences
of individuais. Here again selectivity will be a dominating ~
(Gescetessuest characteristic.

3) The program should be so flexible that we
. would be able to deactivate any installation for security
reasons or for non=productivity and whenever possible employ
techniques which would permit easy reactivation.

4) Except for current intelligence requiring
immediate dissemination, the product should be-handled as
communications intelligence and dissemination would be
subjected to well-established Comint controls of the

_ National Security Agency (NSA) plus any additional restric~
tions the Bureau felt should be imposed.

5) The product would be transmitted to NSA by us
for dissemination within the intelligence community. NSA
. would be responsible for handling any needed translation.
~ We must recognize that the program will produce voluminous
information and the responsibility for processing the data
should be fixed with an agency which is organized and
equipped to handle the job. It is believed that if the
Bureau assumed this respons ility we would be burdened-with
2 gigantic task of information processing to the point ‘that
this element would SAL ede aiiect other phases of the
progran.

6) 2 the information collected by us suggested”
a potential for the development of an operation, i.e.
double agent, the Bureau could assume complete control

of this operation including “the dissemination of tio
information.

7) Our involvement in the "sophisticated"
category should be increased by expanded research and
development bearing in mind we should be utilizing the
most productive equipment available. The importance of
this field cannot be exaggerated in light of the rapid
developments in the scientific world.

Technical Surveillance Controls
7 &

wee Under this plan we could furnish the President

and the Attorney Genoral a listing of technical surveillance
targets and do so on a periodic basis, This could even
include an annual evaluation of the program,

] ‘Anagram Program (Clandestine collection of cryptographic
7 material) ,

This has been one of the more productive programs
handled by the Bureau throughaut the years. We definitely
S 47 ‘ believe that this program should contiaue and where feasible
we should accelerate. The product would continue to be

a ‘| disseminated to NSA.

“Live Sources

_ The category of "live sources" when broadly inter-
Heb preted includes every individual from the casual contact
" to the controlled informant who ts delivering high quality
r : information at an obvious risk. At the present time, our
N _ , sources in diplomatic establishments are for the most part
iat “-"" “American citizens. This situation is ‘largely due to aa wee
undesirable arrangement where we must first obtain clearance
‘com the Stete Department before we proceed to recruit any :
employee or officialr of a diplomatic establishment. This’
places State in the “driver's seat" and that Department,
‘therefore, is practically controlling our efforts, We Zeel

: producing the best results. In our opinion ae 7
* removed by the President's advising the Secretary of
i 7 State that the FBI is being authorized to develop
. penetrations in foreign diplomatic establishments without
obtaining clearances from State, It would be understood
| _ that the Bureau would proceed in a discreet and secure
manner, Periodic contact with the Secretary of State or
other top State officials to discuss general devolopments
and any potentia 1 problems will provide a mechanism for
healthy coordination with State. We recognize that a
: 7 source can turn "sour" and, therefore, there is the danger
: .of potential embarrassment. However, it should be noted
H that our record in this regard has been outstanding over:
! the years. :

Any efficient investigative agency needs sources
. of all categories and we ere no exception. Therefore, we
should continue our present program of general source
development, and this would include contacts who can
produce information on an occasional basis or who might
be in a positicn to be of assistance in a particular
investigation. In diplomatic establishments the reception
clerk, chauffeur, the maid, cam always be of assistance.

- "" However, the primary emphasis of this new program
: ‘would be directed toward high quality sources, such as:

1) Code clerks ;

2) Officials who have access to files, records,
or communications

3) Officials or employees who are in'a position
to penetrate communist-bloc circles or establishments

7 4) Members of foreign intelligence and security
_ Services.

Our existing programs of seeking penetrations in
communist-bloc installations naturally must continue but
will require an increased effort toward production of-
information relating to personality data, and this should

7 world, and elementary inves tive technicues do not produce

voluminous and highly significant data. it is’ therefore
believed that our technicues should become more sophisticated
through additional coverage on the residences of individuals.

Such efforts naturally fall in line with our internal

security responsibilities, but the coverage may also

provide leads for development of-sources in the positive

| intelligence field. Evory Soviet is not a member of KGB
or GRU, but ho novertheless could offer information of

| value, and he could be most useful on a long-range basis.

| _ Our program very definitely should have this philosophy

| in mind, and it is an element which must be impressed

} upon our personnel in our training prograns. In this

| regard, we must recognige that at some point it may become

| ‘ necessary to turn over recruited sources to another agency

| . . such as CIA or one of the military services, Such turnover

.. WiLL, of course, depend on the circumstances, The guiding

principle should be the preservation of the source under
fi ; the best security. :

Siereatee In the non~communist bloc field we would con-
centrate on development of high-quality sources to meet the
priority needs of the Government.

-Training of Personnel

At the present time, our personnel are not properly
oriented to effectively engage in a program as recommended. ~~
To accommodate to a new approach, it will be necessary to;

1) Include in our training classes lectures which
will cover 2 more detailed picture of U. &. intelligence, its
history, definition of terms, functions of Srkatataie Saas

i agencies,

2) Include lectures regarding the foreign intel=-
7 ligence needs of the U. S, Government.

3) Use outstanding officials of other agencies to
Lectuve on special intelligence matters, This would include
the critical areas throughout the world, .

Department, CIA, and the military services.

7) Arrange fo¥ attendance of selected personnel
at War Colleges, a ‘ :

8) Expand the training of Agents in the handling
of technical surveillance inactallations,

Reporting Procedures

This program will not require any basic departure
from our present reporting procedures. The Bureau should
not become involved in evaluating, estimating, etc. We
should endeavor to adhere to our traditional position of
reporting the facts as collected, We may wish to give

7 consideration to adding one feature to our regular reporting

on individuals. This could be an annex for "Personality
Data." The objective would be to maintain an up~to-date
book on everything collected relating to the subject's
character, habits, family life, interests, weaknesses, etc.

C : a Language Cavabilities \
J —_——

An expanded program for collection of foreign
intelligence would require increased capability to handle
foreign languages. As explaized above, the material
collected through technical surveillances should be handled
as communications intelligence, and the major translating
responsibility would, therefore, be placed on NSA.

We do, however, recognize that it is necessary to
maintain a strong foreign language capability in the field
wherever it may be useful to develop live sources. In
offices such as New -ork City and Washington, D. C., we
should expand the number of Agents who are fluent in French,
Russian, Polish, Czech, German, Chinese, and Spanish. An
office which is’ well equipped with a capability in the
foregoing is generally able to handle most situations which
arise. ;

‘| . rs )
Relations with Other Agencies

If this program-is-adopted, other intelligence
agencies would be officially apprised of the Presidential
authority granted to the FBI to collect foreign intelligence
in the United States, Other agencies would be informed
regarding the nature and the extent of the authority boing
delegated to the Bureau. It would be necessary to make
clear that the Bureau was not assuming responsibility for
the clandestine collection of ali foreign intelligence in
the United States, but we were taking a constructive step
in an effort to increase the production of foreign intel-
ligence through assets available to us. We would clearly
point out that the FBI was not taking this approach as a
solution to all of the problems relating to foreign intel~
ligence collection in this country. We would emphasize
that we would move against targets in line with established
priorities and that we would do so on a selective basis.
We would have it understood that operational activities
would be properly coordinated wherever it was obviously
necessary. :

} With regard to the handling of the product of

ct technical surveillances, it would be necessary to effect a
working agreement with NSA, To do this we might be obliged
to discuss this at the USIB level so that NSA could obtain
the required authority to support the hiring of additional
personnel and purchase of equipment for the processing of
our product, Our arrangement with NSA would include ground
rules for processing, translation, and classification ‘and
dissemination.

Pa

Since any announcement that we were in the foreign
intelligence field would prompt unusual interest and very
likely queries, we should brie? CIA regarding the objectives
of our program, Our plan will not abrogate the existing
ground rules which permit CIA to assess and recruit positive
intelligence sources in this country under certain conditions.

-'' Since both Agencies will have. foreign intelligence sources
in the U.S., we undoubtedly will find it useful to work out
‘an agreenent wi by one Agency knows that the other has
coverage in a particular area or establishment. We already
receive the identities. of CIA sources. It would not be
necessary for us to identify our sources, but we could. ~
indicate to CIA that we had an asset in a particular area.

- 95 -

HW 5360 Mockd-39989629.Pages73



va

This would permit CIA to levy requirements on -
us, For example, if we recruited the Third Secretary
of the French Embassy, CIA might wish to ask any number
of questions dealing with the French political situation.
If we felt that the request was reasonable, we could

handle this through our source.

It will be noted that the program doos not
preclude CIA from development of foreign intelligence :
sources in the U. S. for fulfiliment of CIA responsibilities,
CIA will continue to operate under existing ground rules
which are designed to protect Bureau interests.

We believe that if the program is implemented
and jells we will be in a position to "spot" sources
required by CIA and other agencies to discharge their
responsibilities. This would apply to cases where the
target was in e-U. S. for 2 visit or if he had some
specialized knowledge not related to our internal security
responsibilities, These would be targets which other
agencies could handle without interfering with our operations
and without making us carry 2 load for another agency.:
This particular concept should include a Bureau attitude
that any and every source handled by umulies- apouty ia ths
U. S. potentially ca... be useful to us, We should have an
outlook that alli sources should be exploited to the fullest
extent and under secure conditions. If another agency has
2 capability to open a door we should take advantage of the
situation. i

In those instances where CIA has a source in the
United States, we should prod that agency to seek information
of interest to the Bureau, and where obviously necessary we -
should arrange access to the CiA source, The important
feature of this new concept is. that we assume the role of
projecting initiative, leadership and aggressiveness, Our
position should be such that we push the other agencies to
use their resources even to the point of healthy irritation.

We have looked at CIA as the “other agency" in
this picture, but we should not neglect.the potential of
agencies such as ACSI, Air Force, ONI and State, All of
them have entree-to diplomatic circles, The day-to-day
contacts which officials of these agencies have with
personnel of foreign governments produce many “pieces” of
personality data which, when added up over a period of tine,

~ 906 = aoe a

@ : e

can prove to be extremely useful. We should ‘confor with
these agencies regarding ways and means of recruiting
sources either to be handled by us jointly or by one of
the intelligence agencies, Here again, the Bureau can
bo the dominant and pushing source,

It is believed that if we moved along the lines
described above, the Bureau, over a poriod of time, would
have collected valuable information regarding numerous
personalities and the inner workings of the many diplomatic
establishments. The acquirement of data of this type
creates operational strength. it places us in a position
to exploit the development of new sources, bearing in mind
that in planning our ap aches we will be equipped with
ammunition not gained +. ugh casual surveillances and
observations, With the knowledge that we gain, we can |
plan high quality operations, It is interesting to note °
that during the past two years the information received
from CIA's sources in the United States has been fairly
voluminous and very definitely valuable. It is a good
illustration of the Bureau's gaining useful data from
another agency with a minimum of Bureau expense and effort,
but shill maintaining very effective control of our juris-'
dictional rights.

Undoubtedly related to the utilization of other
agencies' resources is the considerably vast potential
offered by friendly foreign security services, If the
services of Great Britain, Germany, France, Holland, Italy,
Australia and Canada provided us information collected in
Washington, D. C. and New York resulting from contacts with
communist-bloc officials, we would have another valuable
source of information, We should bear in mind that we do
spend hundreds and thousands of man-hours seeking such
information through other difficult channels, |

We should utilize the friendly Liaison services
along the lines described above. 7

out of the question, We definitely would require hk -
increase in supervisory personnel in the Domestic [
Intelligence Division, In addition, there would be a
need for more manpower in our Laboratory to handie
expansion in tho technical surveillance field. There
would be a need for additional personnel to be assigned
for the development of live sources in the field, t
would be necessary to have ficld pergonnel assigned to
technical surveillance installations on a continued basis
and, of course, there would be a need for support related
to such earner as preliminary security surveys.

It is “outside the scope of this Committee's -
“competency to outline any specific administrative re-
organization and propose what personnel, equipment and
facilities would be needed. We feel that this could be
best handled only after the objectives of the program are
“approved, At that point, officials from the Seat of
Government and the field could meet to map out the necessary
reorganization, The extent of reorganization will hinge on

a our decision as to the pace we should set, We recommend
. that we proceed at a steady, even pace, making certain that
we lay solid groundwork for ali of our activity. We should
refrain from becoming involved in a "erash" program uniess
national security interests obviously warrant such an
approach,

In connection with any planning for reorganization,
"it would be unwise to proceed without first obtaining a
reliable inventory of our current resources, Such an
inventory would encompass the following: (1) The number
of Agents currently assigned to strictly positive intel-
ligence collection; (2) Our foreign language capabilities;
(3) Our current sources.and informants with an objective
assessment of capabilities; (4) Number of supervisors at

L. ALTERNATIVES :

In addition to the recommended plan set f rth in
preceeding sections, there are several alternative courses
of action we might take:

1. We could take the position, and seek ways to implement
it, that the entire field of foreign intelligence collection
in the U. S., both overt and covert, should be handled by
the FBI. Such an across-tho-boaxd appreach would exclude
CIA and other U. S, agencies from foreign intelligence
collection in this country and would place exclusive
responsibility and jurisdiction in this field on the FBI.

As indicated in Section I, this would require a revamping

of. existing legislation and directives and would necessitate
drastic changes in the Bureau’s operations, including major
increases!.in personnel and costs and a substan atial expansion
in our recruitment and training programs, and other reorganiza~
tion. We do not feel this approach is warranted nor do, we
believe it would be a practical and sound one. ae

2. We couid recommend that CIA continue to be at
responsible for overt collection of foreign intelligence in
this country but that the FBI exclusively handle covert
antclligonce collection. This has several obvious
Acawbacks. First, we would be assuming a wide range of
heavy and fixed responsibilities which in many cases would
be completely divorced from the Bureau's internal security
and counterintelligence interests. Second, we would become
to a large extent a service group for other U. S. agencies
and departments (including CIA, State, the military and othevs)
an the handling of a host of foreign intelligence requirements
levied by other agencies. This would involve a considerable
commitment of manpower, communication costs, etc. on the part.
of the Bureau. In addition, such an approach would necessitate
Significant changes in our recruitment and training procedures
and would also place on our shoulders a definite accountability
in connection with any failures in U. S. intelligence foreign
‘collection. It is not ! elieved that this approach is.as sound
ox desirable as our recommended plan of action: namely,’ that
we expand our foreign intelligence collection efforts but on

a selective basis, Wy ¢ ning, full respons: iLity.



AW SSSe0 Doce Page 378 Eeaneaksnetail rt

' :
3. We could endeavor to work out a @... of :
responsibility and work in this area whereby the Bureau
and CIA would each have certain primary areas of operation.
For example, the FBI could make known its willingness to
contribute more heavily in support of U. S. foreign intelligence
collection efforts and propose this field be broken into
wo categories; namely, technical coverage (this would include
[ Anagran opera’ ions)} and live informant development among
Ei oxoign diploma We could propose that the FBI continue
to operate exclusively in the first category (technical
coverage) with CIA continuing to stay entirely out of this
‘field.

In this regard, the Bureau is better equipped than

CIA to handie technical surveillances and{Anagr operations
by season of our long experience and expertise in this area.

With regard to the second category (live sources)
we could propose that CIA conduct no operations involving
countries where the Bureau's counterintelligence interests
are paramount or significant. This would include the Sino-
Soviet-~bloc countries and could aiso include certain other
countries, such as the Dominican Republic, where we have

- already developed strong capabilities or where there are
unique factors.

With regard to otner countries (nuu-Bluc), we
‘could propose that CIA should assume primary responsibility
for developing live diplomatic sources. However, this
would be with the clear proviso that, in the event the FBI
should develop significant internal security interests, we
would have the prerogative of levying requirements on CIA
sources, having direct access to CIA sources when needed, or
asa final step, developing our own sources if CIA could

“ not satisify our needs,

This dternative plan would not involve as much
manpower or other expense to the Bureau as our recommended
plan. However, it would involve our approval of CZA opera-
tions in the live informant field and would risk CIA infriag-
ing on FBI interests. I% is our consensus that this approach
not be adopted. : :

4, We could recommend that the FBI could withdraw

entirely from the field of covert foreign intdligence collection
-allowing CIA to handle all asvects, including/Anagram opera-
tions7and both live and technicai coverage. We are strongly
opposed to such an approach on the grounds that it would
jeastically diminish the FBI's role in the intelligence
community, would give CIA carte blanche to operate in the

U. S., and in many instances would certainly result in CiAs
compronising on internal security and counterintelligonce
operations.

~~ . Finally, we could take no action to change the
current situation and, in effect, adopt a "status quo"
approach, We are opposed to this. As indicated in this
study, U. S. Government needs for foreign intelligence
are growing on an almost daily basis and CIA has made
definite efforts to move more actively into this ficld.
If we were to adopt a "status quo" attitude, it is only.
a question of time until this matter comes to a head;
for example, in the U. 8. Intelligence Boardjor the
Prosident’s Foreign Intolligence Advisory Board. If and
when this occurs, the decision as to the FBI's role would,
of course, be subject to the thinking and aims of people ~
outside the FBI, possibly including individuals who are
not sympath:
to maintain control of developments,
