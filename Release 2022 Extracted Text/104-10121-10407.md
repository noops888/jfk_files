SUMMARY OF INFORMATION:

The Agency Operator transferred a

call from Subject who re-

quested to speak with the Chief Agent.

Subject alleged to be

Ohio, and wanted information on the disposition of one Olga

publisher of the United Labor News, (circulation 5,000), Toledo,,

Morgan, a

carcerated

captive of the Bay of Pigs invasion who has been in-

in one of Castro's jails.

Initially, Subject stated

that Morgan

has been imprisoned for

six to seven years, later

changing this, upon questioning, to fifteen years. Subject then

seemed uncertain as to when

the

invasion occurred. Subject is

calling for Norgan's mother, Mrs. Mu organ, 1909 Collinswood

Avenue, Toledo, Ohio.

Subject appeared to create an impression that he is a real

gongetter who expects a prompt reply to his query. Subject

noted that he would be calling Jack Anderson, syndicated columnist

following his talk with the Agency.

Subject was highly sarcastic initially but became less strident!

as the conversation developed. Subject stated that he

expected

his call to be returned.

He was advised, however, that a report

of his call would be prepared and passed

to appropriate Agency

OIIICIALS.
