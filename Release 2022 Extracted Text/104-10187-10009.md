REFERENCE : HMMA-41,734, 10 March 1972 (Previous Report)

INTRODUCTION

1. The KDFACTOR Project has been terminated because of develop-
ments reported in “other “¢hannels. This will the last of the opera
tional reports forwarded to Headquarters and primarily a wrap-up of
developments to date.

OPERATIONS

2. The KDFACTOR Project supported two visual and photographic
surveillance points (KDLITERAL and KDABSINTHE) directed against ‘the
MHHARSH installation. Operations: from the KDLITERAL surveillancé
point were suspended on 4 July 1972, the equipment removed on 7:July,
and the operator, KDFACTOR-2, terminated the same date, Operations
from the KDABSINTHE surveillance point were suspended on 28 July, the
equipment removed on 29 July, and termination of KDFACTOR-5 and his
family accomplished the same date. =

ADMINISTRATLON

3. Oliver J. MANKUNAS continued to have responsibility for
inside administrative chores and agent handling throughout the period.
Processing of the photo product was accomplished inside the Station.

PERSONNEL |

4, The project included five salaried assets. KDFACTOR-2
operated the KDLITERAL basehouse, KDFACTOR-5 cperated the KDABSINTHE
basehouse with the assistance of his wife KDFACTOR-6 and his two sons
KDFACTOR-8 and -9, Both KDFACTOR-2 and -5 have served BKTRUST in

5. KDFACTOR-2 will continue to reside in the XDLITERAL building,
as part of his termination agreement, until probably sometime in
December when he will move to'new quarters of his own. The KDLITERAL
Building (MEXI-03, Unit 15) is part of the KDVAULT complex of build-
ings which will be disposed of as reported in other channels, If this
occurs before December, KOFACTOR-2 will move at the time of disposal.

6. KDFACTOR-5 and his family will vacate the KDABSINTHE apart~|
ment 0/a 31 August, KDABSINTHS is located in a building owned by
KDABBEY who plans to disposé of his equity in the property in the
near future. :

PRODUCTION ‘ \

H 7. KDLITERAL: Before being closed down, KDLITERAL, through ‘
KDFACTOR-2, was the source of within-the-compound photographic cover=
age of PCS and TDY MHHARSHers, He provided an average of three rolls
of film a week and provided weekly written reports based on his’
visual observation of the target area.

8. KDABSINTHE: Operated by KOFACTOR-5,; KDABSINTHE produced an
average of six rolls of film a week and was our principal source, for
information on visitors to the MHHARSH installation, especially {|
"WOCORK-type” persons and political exiles, This segment of KDFACTOR
was also our main source of information on MHHARSH license plates

and automobiles,

9. In addition, KDLITERAL and KDABSINTHE both provided detailed
"attendance sheets" on all MHHARSH personnel. With the loss of this
combined coverage, it will be difficult to identity personnel assigned
to the MHHARSH installation or to monitor their daily movements in
and out of the compound. The two surveillance points also provided
periodic photo studies of the MIHARSH installation itself with empha=
sis on coverage of the construction changes and modification or addi-

tions made to the communications antenna system,

SECURITY

KDFACTOR security review which was forwarded as HMMWN-19,061, 28 June
1972, There is no need for further comment. aN

OPERATIONS

1. The KDPACTOR Project continued throughout the past six
months to support two visual and photographic surveillance points
(KDLITERAL and KDABSINTHE) directed against the MHHARSH installation.

ADMINISTRATION

2. Oliver J. MANKUNAS continued to have responsibility for inside
administrative chores and agent handling throughout the period.
Bruce H. FERNALD, who previously handled the assets, is the alternate
case officer and would be available to take over agent meeting respon-
sibilities in the absence of MANKUNAS. Processing of the photo
product is accomplished inside the Station. Agent meetings have now
been cut to a minimum, and the processing of the product and delivery
to the consumer has been speeded up.

PERSONNEL

Be 3. The project includes five salaried assets. KDFACTOR-2
operates the KDLITERAL basehouse and has been employed in this capa-
city since 1957. KDFACTOR-5 operates the KDABSINTHE basehouse with
the assistance of his wife KDFACTOR-6 and his two sons, KDFACTOR-8
and -9. KDFACTOR-5 has also served BKTRUST in this capacity since

I 1957.

5. KDABSINTHE: Cyerated by KDFACTOR-5, KDABSINTHE produced

mation on visitors to the MHHARSH installation, with special atten-

“tion given to Visits of "NOCORK-type" persons and political exiles.

information on MHHARSH license plates and automobiles.

- 6, KDLITERAL and XDABSINTHE both continue to provide detailed
“attendance sheets" on all MHHARSH personnel. Without this combined
coverage, it would be difficult to identify personnel assigned to
the MHHARSH.installation or to monitor their daily movements and
activities. In addition, the two surveillance points provide periodic
photo studies of the MEHARSH installation itself with emphasis on

“@Overage of ary Constructionchanges and any modification or additions

made to the communications antenna system. Both sites are also
available to service special support requests as required. During
the period, KDLITERAL performed a number of special photo surveys and
a three-week frequency sweep requested by WOACRE.

SECURITY REVIEW

7. There were no known problems, of security relating to the
project. In response to Reference’ B. request, we have reviewed all
phases of the operation and believe that project security is sound.
The project assets have all been with us for many years and have
established themselves as respectable long-time residents of the
area. All five assets, four in one family and one in another, are
extremely security conscious and have all been SGSWIRLed. The assets
derive a substantial portion of their livelihood from their BKTRUST~“;-
employment. and would thus lose a great deal if security factors ever
necessitated a termination of their work for us. As an additional
safeguard, the KDLITERAL and KDABSINTHE operations are compartmented
from each other, and there has never been any indication that either
Segment of KDFACTOR knows of the other's existence.

8. The only termination of a project asset in recent years was
KDFACTOR-1, who formerly processed the photo product from both
surveillance points. KDFACTOR-l was terminated amicably in March
1971. We still maintain periodic contact with him; and his brother,
KDADAGE-14, continues to be one of our more valued MHHARSH access
KDFACTOR-1 is a reputable physician with a wide circle of
nd on a number-of recent occasions he has been very helpful
when we have taxed his expertise in his field or requested background
information on people in the medical profession. Although KDFACTOR-1
processed the photo product, he was not knowledgeable of the exact
Surveillance point locations. Delivery and pickup of the finished
product was always accocplished by an outside case officer.

agents.
friends, al

9. Contact is maintained with only two of the five assets.
KDFACTOR-2 and -5, both of whom are responsible for the operation of
their respective basehouses. Both KDFACTOR-2 and ~5 are met weekly
to obtain the KDLITERAL and KDABSINTHE product for timely processing
and analysis by the Station. Meetings with KDFACTOR-2 are car pick~
ups at periodically changed locations in the suburbs, Meetings with
KDFACTOR-5 consist of car meetings early in the morning along his
route of travel to his overt job. These meetings last only long
enough to pick up the preduct, provide new supplies, and pay salaries,
rents, utility bills, etc. Emergency contact plans are on file at
the Station and have been forwarded to ieadquarters on both KDFACTCR-
2 and -5. KDFACTOR-6, -8, and -9 are members of KDFACTOR-S*s imme=
diate family and could be contacted through him using his energency

plan.

10. We have taken action recently to guard against the contin-
gency that one of the present sites might be blown, and alternate

means might be required to continue the KDFACTOR coverage. . In
February 1972 an apartment became available in the same building
complex which houses the KDABSINTHE installation, Through the
Gooperation of KDABBEY-1, we were able quictly to rent the apart”
ment and install elements of the KDCALVERT team as residents. This
location affords as good, if not better, vantage point for continu-
ing photo coverage in the event the present KDABSINTIE location
becomes untenable. We are also exploring alternate locations for,
KDLITERAL to solve the problem we face with this element of KDFACTOR

coverage (see below).

| PROBLEMS

7 11. The only known problem connected with the project is a
‘product of mother nature which 18 threatening the effectiveness of
RDLITERAL coverage. Approximately two years ago MHHARSH personnel
planted eight small trees along the edge of the terrace leading to
the garden. These trees have flourished and now have grown to the
point where KDFACTOR-2, the KDLITERAL operator, estimates he only
has a year more of effective operational capability. We are studying
ways of solving this problem and will forward a separate dispatch

to Headquarters on the topic in the near future. i

OPERATIONS

1. The XDFACTOR Project continued throughout the past six
months to support two viswal and photographic surveillance points
(KDLITERAL and KDABSINTHE) directed against the MHHARSH installation,

ADMINISTRATION

2, Howard T. BAGAUS handled the administration of the project
until early April 1971 when project responsibility reverted from the
Ops Support Section back to the REDTOP Section, At that time Timothy
H. ARCHBCLD assumed the inside admisistrative chores, and agent
meotings were turned over to the outside case officer Bruce H.
FERNALD tho had previously handled the assets. When ARCHBOLD de-
parted PCS on 7 June 1971, Oliver J, MANKUNAS assumed his responsi-
bilities. MANKUNAS also took over agent meetings when FERNALD left
on home leave on 25 June and will continue to handle the project

assets in the futuro,

3, Processing of the photo product is now accomplished inside
the Station by Phemia B, CHAUVEAU, KDFACTOR-1, who formerly did all
the processing in an outside safehouse/darkroom, was terminated
amicably in early March 1971, and at that time the responsibility
was turned over to CHAUVEAU, The new arrangement has proven to be
more than satisfactory, Agent meetings have now been cut to a
minimum, and the processing of the product and delivéry to the con-
sumer has been speeded up considerably,

PERSONNEL

4. The project includes five salaried assets, KDFACTOR~2

operates the KDLITERAL base house and has been employed in this
capacity since 1957, KDFACTOR-5 operates the KDABSINTHE base house

with the assistance of his wife, KDFACTOR-6, and his two sons,
KDFACTOR+8 and =9, KDFACTOR-5 has also served JKLANCE in. this
capacity since 1957,

PRODUCTION ©

5, KDLITERAL: During this reporting period, KDLITERAL,
through KDFACTOR-2, continued to be the.source of within-the-compound
photographic coverage of PCS and TDY MHHARSHers, He produced 76
rolls of film and provided weekly written reports based on his daily

visual observation-of the target area,

6. KDABSINTHE: Operated by KDFACTOR-5, KDABSINTHE produced
. 167 rolls of film and continued to be theprincipal source for infor-
mation. on visitors to the MHHARSH installation, with special atten-
tion given to visits of "WOCORK-type” persons and political exiles.
This segmont of KDFACTOR also continued to be the main source of
dinformation on. MHHARSH licensé plates and automobiles.

:°.. %, KDLITERAL and KDABSINTHE both continue to provide detailed
“attendance. sheets" on all: MHHARSH personnel, Without this combined
coverage, it would be difficult to identify personnel assigned to
the MHHARSH installation or to monitor their daily movements and

activities,

SECURITY

8, There were no known problems of security relating to the
_ project. The termination of KDFACTOR-1 should pose no security
problem: Contact’ was broken amicably, and it is highly probable
that he would be more than willing to help out again if his sorvices
are needed. Of the remaining assets, all five have been SGSWIRLED
in the past, They derive a substantial portion of their livelihood
from their JKLANCE employment and would thus lose a great deal if
security factors ever necessitated a termination of their work for
us. As an additional safeguard, the KDLITERAL and KDABSINTHE opera-
tions are compartmented from each other, and there has never been
any indication that eithor segmont of KDFACTOR knows of the other's

existence,

9. Contact is maintained with only two of the five assets,
KDFACTOR~2 and -5, both of whom are responsible for the operation
of their respective base houses, Both KDFACTOR-2 and -5 are met
weekly to obtain the KDLITERAL and KDABSINTHS product for timely
processing and analysis by the Station, Meetings with KDFACTOR-2
are car pickups at periodically changed locations in the suburbs,
Meetings with KDFACTOR-5 consist of car meetings early in the
morning along his route of travel to his overt pb, These meetings
last only long enough to pick up the product, provide new supplics,
and pay salaries, rents, utility bills, etc, Emergency Contact
Plans are on file at the Station and have been forwarded to Head-
quarters on both KDFACTOR~2 and -5, KDFACTOR-6, -8, and -9 are
members of KDFACTOR-5's immediate family and could be centacted-

through him using his emergency plan,
PROBLEMS:
10, There were no known problems connected with the project
during the reporting period,
FINANCES

11. The termination of KDFACTOR-1 and the subsequent elimina~
tion of outside photo processing costs accounts for the drop in
anticipated project expenses shown below for FY 1972 and FY 1973,

GENERAL

1. The-KDFACTOR Project continued throughout the period to
support two visual and photographic surveillance points (KDLITERAL
and KDABSINTH) directed against the MHHARSH installation and to
support the related photo processing of the product..

2. The Station is presently taking steps to terminate
KDFACTOR-1 the photo processor and move this phase of the operation
into the Station.

3. Primary responsibility for the operational and administra-
tive handling of Project KDFACTOR was transferred on 1 December 1970
to the Operational Support Section, and handling of the KDFACTOR
personnel was turned over to Howard T. BAGAUS on 2 December 1970.

MEETING ARRANGEMENTS

4. KDFACTOR-5: This agent is met by BAGAUS at 0800 ench
Tuesday morning at one of four different sites near the Anillo
Periferico in Polanco, some three miles from the Station. The modus
operandi used with this agent is basically the saze as previously
used by Bruce H. FERNALD. All meetings are held in the case efficer
car, and after the meetings, KDFACTOR-5 resumes his trip to work.

whether he 4s in the middle of an operation at the hospital.
(Waiting periods vary from immediate admittance to tho KDFACTOR=1
office to several hours)., The average period is about twenty
einutes. A decision was reached in the Station to terminate this
asset and to transfer this phase of the operation to the Station
itself, in the interest of speed, security, and cost. This
termination is planned for early March 1971, at which timé, the

processing will be done in the Stulion.

through KDFACTOR-2 has again been the principal source of within-the-
ff PCS and TDY MHHARSHERs producing

compound photographic coverage ©:

129 rolls of film, During the period covered, a great change of PCS
personnel at the MHHARSH {nstaijation took place, and KDLITERAL
played a leading role in assisting tho Station in identifying the
new members of the installation, through not only photographic
coverage, but through detailed visual reporting also. In addition
to reporting on the activities ef the different individuals in the
target installation, KDLITERAL Bas also reported on significant
construction changes in the compound such a recent change in the
antenna configurations on the root of the main building. During
this period, KDLITERAL has been “poctffcally targetted against
AEJEFE, on whom which a special Teport has been submitted.

9. KOARSINTH: Operating through KDFACTOR- 5, KDABS INTH
produced 158 rolls of film. It provided the Station with information
previgitors to the MHHARSH instdllation, giving special attention
fo visits of "WOCORK-type" pers: KDABSINTH continues to fulfill
requirements from the various sections of the Station who have
requested fixed surveillance of political exiles, ctc., to determine
ifithese individuals are in contact with the MHHARSH installation,
This segment of KDFACTOR contines to be the main source of

MEETING ARRANGEMENTS

3.  LIEMPTY-13: He is met by FERNALD ia the early hours
.of Tuesday mornings at about 0730 in Polanco, an area far from
the basehouse. LIEMPTY-13 parks his car and walks through a
central park on Calle Horacio where he is intercepted within
a ten-block distance by FERNALD, driving his car. During a
drive together, instructions and product are passed hetween them
and, once a month, LIEMPTY-13 is paid his salary and the
salaries for LIEMPTY-14, -26 and -27. After drop-off LIEMPTY-13
returns to his car and proceeds to his full-time job, thus
avoiding any direct route back to the basehcuse operation,

4, LIEMPTY-9: After completing his strveillance workday
from 0800 to 1500 hours, he completes his written reports and
drives to meet FERNALD at around 1630 hours, also on Tuesdays.
The location of car mectings varies but remzins within a quiet,
fairly secluded section, After leaving FERNALD, LIEMPTY-9
proceeds to his cover job at a brother's automobile dealership
for the remainder of his day, again avoiding any direct route
from FERNALD back to the basehouse.

5. LIEMPTY-4; After receiving the unzrocessed take from
LIEMPTY-9 and -13, FERNALD prepares instructions, as suggested
by log entries that accompany the take, and goes to, LIEMPTY- 4's
medical office waiting room in the late afternoon. For these
meetings, FERNALD appears to be a pharmaceutical salesman or
a patient and gets to see LIEMPTY-4 only after all other visitors
have departed. At cach meeting, FERNALD delivers films from
both LICALLA and LILYRIC for processing anc retrieves the
Processed take that, he had left the week before. While this
arrangement means that some of the product (those photos taken
soon after meeting with LIFMPTY-9 and -13) are almost two weeks
eld when received at the Station, we have ast fotind this to be
unacceptable. When speed is of the essence in special
circumstances, the Station WOACRE technician can handle the
processing,

1. With the termination of Raymond H. GsRENDE, effected ‘on
26 June 1970 ard described in H¥MA-39129, 29 June 1970, the
LIEMPTY Project now consists cf the operutions of the LICALLA and
‘LILYRIC photo base houses and the photo processing of LISMPTY-4.
Outside case officer Bruce H, FSRNALD handles all agents, normally
on & once per week basis, and passes the take to his Station
contact. Cperational funds are passed to FERNALD by his Station
contact, and FERNALD pays all agent Salarics, rents, and other
expenses, The eliminition of GERXNDE has resulted in some loss
of efficiency, since basc house personnel cannot vegularly be met
as frequently as in the past, This can mean‘a delay of up te two
weeks in receipt by the Station of rhotos, However, LILYRIC and
LICALLA personnel have standing requirements to report by telephone
visits of Americans, and they are also alerted in advance whenever
pessible to forthcoming TDYs of NHHARSH visitors, so that arrangements
can be nade for special meetings and speedy precessing of photos,
Normally, all photos are developed anc printed by LIEMPTY-4,
When speed is of the essenco, however, negatives are seat into
the Station for processing by the WOACRE technician, Thus, while
GERENDE's loss is a serious one in certain respects (he was, on
the local scene, talented, knowledgeable, and experienced), LIEMPTY

production hrs uot suffered greatly.

2, As tar as the security problem iy coacerned, the generous
termination settlement avarded to GSRENDE has probably removed
whatever small temptation there may have been on his part to be
indisereet about his former assecintion, Although GERENDE his
certain character weaknesses which’ emérged as a lack of dedication
and a feeling that he could get by with as little work as possible,
the Station believes that ho is basically not.an irresponsible
person, and that he realizes not only that he has an obkigation to
respect security, but that ho also realizes that ho has been treated
fairly and with great patience, He bas offered his services for
the future, and he was told that we appreciated the offer and did
‘ot want to lose complete touch with him, but for now he should
devote himself to getting a good job.

3. As for GERENDE's wife,. LILMPTY-19, she also appeared to
be grateful for the termination bonus which she had been granted
(and which she was told had not been carved out of what was due
GERENDE). On the other hand, she has less reason to be loyal to
JKLANCE, and her mental stability if somewhat opea to question.
Therefore, she poses-a greater threat to LIEMPTY security than
doves GHRENDE. At the same time, she knows much less about Station
operations and personnel than does GERENDE. Furthermore, it is
not likely that she would (a la Mrs. LIROCKET-1) go directly to
the MHUARSHers with her information. What she might do is reveal
to her lawyer that GERENDE jiad worked for LNPURE and therefore had
incone to which she might fect that shé is entitled, Since
GERENDE is no longar employed and therefore no longer has regular
income (except for monthly payments of the termination bonus,
which she has agreed in writing not to claim), this threat has
also been lessened, Theoretically, however, she could expose

LIEMPTY and LIFEAT techniques (since she has been a LIFcAT transcriber)|,

but she could not, as far as we knew, expose any currently eaployed
agents, with the exception of LIEMPTY-4, who is married to GuRENDE'S
sister. (None of the above assessment uf the possible security
threat posed by LIZMPTY-19 is. changed by her 8 July visit to
JKLANCE Headquarters.) rf

The logs showed that AcTURNKEY might have made the first meeting,
but would certainly have been late for it. For the alleged second
meeting, however, the log showed that AETURNKEY Was in the NEHARSH
gmbassy for the cutire pericd of the meeting (subject of MSXICO CITY
3389 latdr amended his Story to say that ASTURNKEY had not rade

the sucond meeting). LILYRIC personnel were quick to spot the :
subject of MEXICO CITY 3542, 25 June 1970, making visits to the
MHHARSH Embassy, and reported these visits by phone even before

the Station had learned, from LIZNVOY, of this person's telephone
call, Several other visitors of apparent WOLADY nationality were

a}so routinely reported to local LNSRGU, along with a request for
license plate resolution if a WOLADY license plate is spotted.

Late in June, LILYRIC was alerted to report the possible visit of

a person who had made a phone call to 201-087316, offering the

latter sone "interesting information,". LILYRIC spotted aod
photographed a person who may be identical with the caller, and
attempts ure iow under way to resolve this.

6, LIENPTY-4 continues to handle all photo developing and
minting (except when certain prints. ave needed quickly), and in -
spite; of his leg iwjury, from which he is now vecovered, he did
not miss any deadlines. The fact that GeRuNDE has been terminated
is not expected to affect his relatiorship with the Station, even

¥

though he ts married to one of GERENDE's sisters, ALD has
cetablished good rapport with hin, and he has stated that GZzRENDE's
preblems ure not -his and will have no effect on his association,

7. The above recital-of LILYRIC and LICALLA’ activities would
seem to indicate a heavy CI emphasis. Actually, this is not the
case, While CI is an important by-product, net only for ourselvas
but also in support of walk-in operations run by other agencies,
the day-in day-out bread and butter photo and fixed surveillance
information is of freat importance to our positive operations,

LIEMPTY Progress Report 1 November 1969 - 25 March 1970

eS
Reference; HMMA-38119, 18 November 1969! PRIORITY
SUMMARY

1, The LIEMPTY Project has thus far survived the absence from
duty of its principal agent, Raymond H, “GERENDE, as well as the
threat to the security of the Project represented by GERENDE's
marital problems, Bruce H. FERNALD has been handling all Project
personnel since early December 1969, when GERENDE was deactivated
and placed on half-pay, No problems have resulted from this, other
than a delay in the receipt of photos (FERNALD is unable to meet
LIEMPTY personnel as frequently as GERENDE was), The security
threat will remain as long as GERENDE's estranged wife has it
within her power to’expose GERENDE's RVROCK connection and the type
of work he was engaged in, She has continually promised not to do
this, and thus far she has kept her word,

2, The LIEMPTY product continues to be a valuable one for the
Station, It continues to play an important CI role (particularly
for LNEPGO and LNREAD) but its greatest value, as far as the Station
is concerned, is in the positive field. Two recent examples
underline this; The early .(and thus; far only) debriefing of
AEMIDRIFF was accomplished almost exclusively by showing her photos
of all MHHARSH Sxbassy personnel and getting from her a character
sketch on each individual, These photos were all obtained by
LILYRIC and LICALLA, Secondly, LIEMPTY observations (as opposed to

photos) played an important role in our total coverage of AESEASICK
during tho receat opérational activity undertaken against AESEASICK.
In short, LIEMPTY remains a highly effective and highly useful
Support asset, whose product’ is obtained in ordor to be used
operationally, not simply collected for the files,

GERENDE .

3, The GERENDE problem is unquestionably a serious one. We
are forwarding under separate cover copies of several memoranda
Prepared by. GERENDE. One outlines the history of his marital
problems, another describes the current legal situation, and a
third outlines proposals for a settlement, There is no hope of
recoiciliation, The Statioa’s position with GERENDE from the
start has been that he must agree to an amicable settlement with
‘his wife in order to insure’ that she would not feel forced to take
steps which would jeopardizé the security of Station operations,
For this ‘reason, the Station insisted from the beginning that any ©
financial settlement with his wife would have to take into account
the fact that he was receiving a certain salary from RVROCK, and
that he could not fairly keep this salary out of the settlement on
the grounds that his wife could make no legal claim to that
salary. GERENDE's wife.was made aware of our position on this, and
she was grateful, even though she realized that this arrangement
was strictly informal, The Station felt that GERENDE could not be
allowed to use his RVROCK salary as a weapon in the dispute with his
wite, because if he did, she could hardly be expected to refrain
from exposing his connect ions, Indeed, events have shown that
GERENDE's wife is a vindictive woman, and if it had not been clear
to her that she, as well as GERENDE, would lose money if he loses
his job, she might have blown the whistle long ago. GERENDE, for
his part, would have preferred to keep his RVROCK salary entirely
out of the picture. Eventually, however, he agreed that the Station
position was fair, and he said he would conform.

4. Tho attached memoranda from GERKNDE are, in the Station's
opinion, basically fair accounts, In the beginning, the Station
was inclined to give GERENDE's wife (LIKMPTY-19) tke benefit of the
doubt, largely because her description of GERENDE's character
weaknesses came -as no surprise (particularly his tendeacy to
procrastinate, even when his marriage was at stake), Early in the
conflict, LIEMPTY~19 contacted RIZZUTO and asked point blank what
she could tell her lawyer about GERENDE's salary, She was told
she could not.mention the RVROCK portion undér any circumstances,
and that if she told anyone-that GERENDE had any connectiog with
LNPURE, the connection would be denied and GERENDE would be
terminated. She appeared to accept this gracefully, even though it
meant she would have to scale her support demands down to the
level of GERENDE's overt income (GERENDX's monthly salary from
RVROCK was over 7,000 pesos; he earned an additional 4 to 5,000 pesos
teaching English, and he has since rented their house, for which
he is receiving slightly less than 7,000 pesos monthly). Z
Subsequently, LIEMPTY-19 was told thet the Station would see to it
that as long as GERENDE continued to receive an RVROCK salary, he
would give her the same proportion of this salary that the courts
determined should be paid from his overt income, ‘his, of course
was strictly an informal arrangement, one which would stop the
mYaut SRENDE Stopped receiving a salary, Later, as LIEIDTY SIS 7s
joSition hardened an ier vindictiveness began to rule her actions,
LIEMPTY-19 was reminded by the Station that the longer it took for
An amicable solution to be reached, the greater was the chance
_cthat GERENDE would lose his job. If she persisted in having him
‘arrested (which she succeeded in doing twice), his job would be
jeopardized, While she continued to repeat sweetly that she had no

intention of causing his termination, and had never breathed a

word to’a soul about his RVROCK affiliation, her attitude was in
fact jeopardizing his job and if he lost his job, she and the iH
children, as well as GERENDE, would lose income, Uer attitude is

T "CLASSIFICATION | PAGE NO,

CONTINUATION OF
DISPATCH _ SECRET (__ mwA=38700_

doubly disappointing in view of the fact that as she became more and
more unreasonable, GERLNDE was moving in the othor direction,

5. The outcome can still not be predicted. As can be seen
from GERENDE's memos, the two sides are still far apart on a number
_of points, including specifically-money, LILMPTY-19 insists on
10,000 pesos per month, GH#RENDE is willing to pay 5,000, GERENDE
is currently on half-pay, Which means that his total’ (all source)
monthly income is around 14,000 pesos, From this, he would not only
‘have. to pay the amount which is finally agreed upon, he must also
contitiue payments of 2500 pesos per month to LIEMPTY-19's father
. . (paying off a loan obtained to build ‘their house). The complicating
|; “~factor is.the uncertainly of GSRENDE's future with RVROCK, The
Station has maintained for some time that it is impossible to
continue to pay 'GERENDE his full salary solely torun the LICALLA
and .LILYRIC basehouSes, Now that FERNALD has absorbed this duty
with only small inconvomionce.and some loss of timeliness, it makes
even less sense to put GiRENDE to work only to do this, GERENDE
has long been aware of the Station's thinking in this regard, and.
prior to the current personal crisis he had been told that he
would have to work harder at a greater variety of tasks in order
to retain hie position, As Headquarters is aware, he had been
given additional tasks, and, as reported in reference, he had begun
to respond very well. There has never been any question of GERENDE's
ability. As wo have previously stated, he is personablo, intelligent,
bilingual and binational, and has had good training and experienca
in certain fields, On the other hand, there has long been doubt
about his seriousness of purpose, his initiative, and his ambition,
The "reversal of roles" which he describes in one of the attached ---
memos, which took place when he was confined to his home as an -
LP keeper, did more than cause domestic problems -- it apparently
deprived him of the discipline of a daily job, His well-deserved
reputation for being lazy was earned years ago,

6, The. question which must be answered is whether or
not to terminate GERENDE. He can be useful to the Station, but
the station has learned to get along without him, What are the
security hazards involved? The general range of his knowledge is
described in paragraph 5 of reference, If all of this were blown,
the ‘loss to the Station, particularly in terms of support operations ©
against the MHHARSH turget, would be considerable, The Station
does not believé that GERENDE would deliberately expose any of this,
but it is impossible to predict what LIEMPTY-19 might do, particularly
since she would feel that she had nothing to lose, having already
lost a possible source of income through the termination, GERENDE's
termination’ bonus would probably be in the neighborhood of ten
thousand dollars, Presumably LIEMPTY-19 is aware of the fact that
he would get such a bonus, although the Station has never discussed
this with her and the possible division of such a bonus between the
two of them has never beon mentioned,

LICALLA

7. The LICALLA basehouse continues to function without changes,
except for the fact that Bruce H, FERNALD has been meeting LIEMPTY-9
since 9 December 1969, Brief meetings with LIEMPTY-9 are held once
‘a week at pre-arranged times and places (well away from the MHHARSH
area), Occasionally special meetings are called, by phone, by
FERNALD, if special coverage is desired (as in the AKSEASICK case,
for example). There have been no problems, operational or personal,
involving the basehaise or LIEMPTY-9 during the reporting period.
LIEMPTY-9 provided 1,728 photographs during the reporting period,
and in addition to his regular reporting on observed activities of
MHHARSH personnel, he provided special coverage as requested, This
“special coverage" consists of his observations of a selected
individual ~- who does he spend his time with, how is he behaving,
when was he present (or absent), etc. LIEMPTY-9 spends over 40

hours a week just watching (and photographing) MHRARSH personnel,

and over the years he has gottento know then, and their habits,

very well, Ho. can spot unusual or atypical behavior, and when he

is asked to put a certain individual under close scrutiny, his
comments can be very uSeful, Newcomers, no matter what their

cover, will frequently gravitate to their IS colleagues in the
‘ “gafety" of the MHHARSH back yard, thereby enabling us to make
tentative AEKICK or ALGRIP identifications, TDYers can often be
linked up with their internal escort officers, In the case of
Specific targets, LICALLA special coverage can sometimes give clues
to personal relationships which can be exploited, During the reportil
period we had special coverage on AKSKASICK (to determine any
changes in pattern following the AMMIDRIFF defection and following
the operation. against him andio both cases LICALLA did report * "
Some, change in pattern); 201-305870 (for much the same reason,
‘although here the evidence was not as clear); AEPOLYP (to gather
information on his patterns and his associatious); ABTAKEOFF :
(for the same reason); and 201=838166 (to find out if he did,

in fact work in the "restricted area" and who his associates were,
a requirement which was quickly satisfied), Also, LICALLA has been
asked to report on the arrival and activities of TDYers such as

the AFKICK security inspectors (he is not, of course, told that j
“security inspectors" are expected == he is told of the expected \
arrival of visitors, and he can spot a visitor or newcomor innedtately) |
the possible arrival of 201-314616 and, currently, to attempt to
-identify, at least by association, the person who went out to meet |
an LNREAD agent (subject of MEXICO CITY 2741, 17 March 1970). The
value of LICALLA to the REDTOP program in Mexico City can scarcely
be overstated,

LILYRIC

8, There have been no changes during the reporting period of
the operation of the LILYRIt baschouse activity, except that Bruce
H. FERNALD took over the handling of the LILYRIC personnel from
GERENDE in early December. FERNAID normally meets only LIEMPTY-13,
at pro-arranged sites and times (also well away from the MHHARSH
area), once a week for pick-up of the films and reports, He occae
sionally meets LIEMPTY-14 (LIEMPTY-13's wife) when LIEMPTY-13 may
be out of town. The LILYRIC coverage is a family enterprise i
with the work equally divided among LIEMPTY-15, 4,26, and 27,
who split up the hours of. duty so that there is uninterrupted

| eoverage Mondays through Fridays from 0S00 to 1800 hours, and

0800 to 1500 hours Saturdays, (Extra-hour or week-end coverage may
be requested as necessary, and the LILYRIC personnel responded to
the Station request for such extra coverage during the AEMIDRIFF
and AESEASICK cases.) The family has continued to provide reports
during the reporting period on all activity centered on the front
entrance of the MHHARSH Embassy. Such coverage included, as in the
past, daily logs on the comings and goings of MHHARSH officials,
up-tc-date recording of MHIIARSH license numbers, special activities
and visitors (particularly Americans, of whom five were spotted and
reported on during the reporting period), and some 3,500 photographs,
As an example of the value of LILYRIC coverage, within one week of
the change of license plates at the MHRARSH Embassy (a biannual change
affecting 211 of Mexico, with new numbers bearing no relation to
the old), LILYRIC had provided a complete list of the new numbers
(along with the cars to which the plates are assigned). Among
other things, this enabled tho Station to identity ABSEASICK's
companions during his lust few days‘in Mexico, Without LILYRIG,
identificationof the new license plates would have taken months and
would have handicapped our operations, LILYRIC has also provided
special coverage.of the visit of a Latin American CP representative,
and is currently watching for the two AZXICK security technicians,
201-314616, and the man who went to meet the LNREAD agent. Also,
LILYRIC has reported on visits of Mexican teats and the identity
of the MHHARSH representatives who deal with thea or hand out
literature to them. In short, LILYRIC's services, even though the

FUTURE PLANS

11, As for GERENDE, the Station has reached the conclusion
that he must be terminated, “This is not an easy decision to make,
nor will it be easy to confront GERENDE with this decision, He
has, after all, devoted 15 years of his life to RVROCK. lowever,
as noted above, in spite of his talents the Station has been able
to get along without his services. Furthermore, the constant
security risk posed by his wife is, frankly, an unacceptable risk.
To try to molify her ‘by promising ‘her a portion of his salary is
probably unworkable in realistic terms, particularly since her
attitude has progressively hardened. The Station, therefore,
intends to terminate GERENDE prior to the end of FY 1970, GERENDK's
contract calls for a termination bonus of one month's salary: per
full year, This would come to $8,750 (USD). For various reasons,
including the need to preserve the security of the operation by
ensuring that the termination is amicable, it will probably be
necessary, as stated in paragraph 6, to give GERENDE about $10,000
(USD), Furthermore, it will be necessary to inform LIEMPTY-19 of
the termination, and, to keep her from revealing what she knows,
she will undoubtedly have to be given some money herselt, The
Station does not believe that it would beequitable or sound from
a security point of view to use the money which GERENDE himself has
earned for this purpose, Therefore, while tho figure will remain
negotiable, the Station believes that the sum of $2,500 (USD)
would be a reasonable amount, Total obligations for FY 1970 in
the LIEMPIY Project are currently ostinated at slightly lesa than
$33,000 (USD), The Project has been approved ip the amount of
338/970 (USD) leaving unobligated approximately $6,000 (usp), It
is therefore requested that the LIxMPTY Project be amended for
FY 1970 to provid

lo an additional $8,000 (USD) to be used in the
GERENDE termination.

Funds will be available at the Station,

TO : Case Officer and Chief of Station

FROM : GERENDE
SUBJECT: GERENDE Background and Status Report
of Present Yarital Conflict

While this, is not intended to be a full exposition of my -
I would like to make
» led

personal and private life over vecent years,
kuewn some of tho factors that have, from my point of view

up to the present situation,

2, 1 realize that the interests of the organization and the
interest of the ‘adividuals who may have opportunity to come ia
contact with my case dictate as Little parsonal involvement as
possible ‘n the lives of agents, Indeed, the requirements of
security, compartrentation and efficiency prescribe the nodue
operandi and, to a great extent the ;odus vivendi, of agency
personael not only in the sense of corning a living but also la
manner of living, Ideally, the less said about an agent's private
life, the better, but, as the years go by, changes may occur which
go unreported or unnoticed and which may bring about unexpected
events ard repercussicns. When & person han been worktag for the
Station, as T have, for fifteen years with little or no personnel
handling problems, no security flaps, no obvious problems on the
Job, and something coses up like the abrupt separation of my
wife (LIuMPTY-19) and ze with the perroual and potent$al security
risks it has entailed, J feel that some explanation is necessary.
Should it be in order, I would like this explanation te reach not
only my present case officer and Chief of Station but also the
former Chief ané officers with whom I have had the privilege to

work over the years,
3. I would Jike to give thanks, in advance, for the patience
and understanding that have been shown me thus far, Whatever the

final outcome, I know that pecple have been hendtng over backward
to be helpful and patient in hopes of an early solution to the

conflict.

4, Back in Septeniver 1959, shortly after our wedding in late
1958, my wife and baby girl, were moved, by the agency, into a

spacious, carpeted, furnished apartment near the DIZTAG Embassy,
which served intermittently as « listening post-baschouse for the
agency, At the time, LIE\PTY-19 was working as the manager of the
bookstore at the University cf the Americas and, at the seme time,
studying for a B,A, in philosophy. Those. were happy tines, We
received a two-sonth leave, went to Europe, the Rome Olympics and
visited LIEMPTY-19's family in Holland. Back in dexico, when the
irenents),
minded the dial and tape recorders and the baby -= an unfortunate
reversal of marital roles. After exactly five years the basehouse
was closed down and we lost rent, LIEMPTY-19's salary and my
mother's salary which she had been receiving as part-time basehouse
keeper, My mother and youngest sister gave cousiderabte help in
taking care of the baby while LIJMVTY-19 worked and when we went
to Europe and left the baby with thea, This was during the first
three years at the base until we had our second child, Christopher,

5, We moved to a small apartment in Lomas and, to supplement
the lors cf salary aad rent allowance, the Station began paying
1,000 pesos a month fer the use of a dark room T had built on the
roof of the building, We had wr third child, Madeleine, unplanned,
two months after settling in the two-bedroom apartment, ‘The
apartment need not have bevn so small hut we had chosea it for its
Location and style and because it was to be a temporary stop until
we could find something better, We missed yoing to the Olympics
in Tokyo which we had planned to do (1964) and instead began
negotiatiag to buy a home brilding site at Rio Escendido but whea
the deal fell thragh, we decided to go on leave to kurope again,
this time with the two oldur childven, leaving the baby with my
sister, We visited with LISMPTY-19's parents in Holland (they had
moved back to Holland after having lived in ington, D.C., since
1943) and the two children stayed with them while LIEMPTY-19 and I
made side trips, Traveling is LIEMPTY-19's greatest love in life,
Upon our return to Mexico (I came back twe weeks earlier), LIZMPTY-19
was so depressed at leaving, furope and being back in Mexico she was
enotionally and physically inaccessible for avout six weeks, She
nad not fully adjusted to living 1a Mexico or to settling down and
becoming a housewife, Our cramped quarters, way of living, lack
of moacy, my job, my irregular hours and habits, my Friday night
poker games, the three children, all these got her dewn,

6. In the fall of 1965 after our return from Furope I began
tenching Englisa to beginners in the adult education program at the
American School in the evenings, This started as a two-hour a
week meonlighting experiment but Ly early 1966, through student
contacts made at the school, I had branched ovt te teaching at the
offices of Carnation Milk Co,, Singer Sewing Machine, and
Richardson-Nerrell Drug Co, fer a total of about tweaty hours per
week, LIEMPTY-19, meantime, was working part-time at the Hamilton
Schoo! in Lomas where the two older children were attending, The
family finances improved and I was able to convince LIEMPTY-19 that

apt
rl

OL.


t3 lan}

the best thing to do vas-to invest in land and build a house big
enough for our growing family which by now had a fourth child on

the way, With three frienis as partners, I entered on a land-buying
deal which turned out to be complicated: as we bought the land in

the form of company stock, The company was liquidated and the
assets were distributed, as land, to the four partners. I paid for
our share with the proceeds fraa the sale of a small lot I had been
paying for since.1955, LIEMPTY-19 was at first reluctant to tie

us down with a house but when we finally got the papers and land
deed straightened out, she threw herself wholeheartedly into the :
broject and the building which began in August 1967, While LIEMPTY-19
fupervised the construction, I worked during Septerber and October
almost full-time for the Olympic Organizing Committee and the group
Zrom Czechoslovakia which came ty train in the pre-Olympics, My
father-in-law deposited money ‘n Mexico to help us with the majov
part of the financing of the house. ‘ie ured $286,500 pesos of kis
morey and about $60,000 that LIEMPTY-19 and f had saved and got the
house finished enough to move in in March 1968, We were very short
on furniture und shortly after moving in bought three bedroom sets,
an autoriatic washer and even a piano, Naturally, cash was scarce,
dirt was plentiful, The yard was a pile of rubble, the carpentry
work had just begun, there were no closets, thy house was unpainted,
Theveaster, we did things on the ‘suse as the money came in:
continued with carpentry, finished the driveway, put in grass,

built 2 fence and front gate,

7. Six months after moving in came time for the Olympics and
I worked, unofficially this time, with the water polo team from
Australia, LIZPTY-19 werked for the month with the Dutch and
Belgian radio aud TV group. LIzMPTY-19 vas, once again, caught up
in the atmesphere of being among Europeans and doing someting
exe‘ting and out of the routine of hone aud children, She fell in
love witi the Australiacs a5 well, and for several months all she
ccvld talk of vas that we should move to Australis, T gave it some
thought but decided that had neither the money to invest nor the
youth and technical training to make it as pioncers “down under"
and, on the other hand, family, friends, a house, and job seniority

here in Mexicc,

8, Toward the end of 1968, LIEuPTY-19 decided it was time for
ne to move out of the master bedroom as she could no loager face
that aspect of our married life, For several months we tried this
tut it did not werk out for me, One night in March 1969 after we
returned hone from a party, ske asked me to help her undress aad
when she, once again, reiused to have anything co de with me, I
got rough with her, prompting a decision on her part, which she
had already been powering, to vieit her parents in Holland as soon
as possible, Her father provided the plane fare and she! left in
April for the United States to visit her brother and sister and
Molland, for what she said would be a five week trip, She stayed
naay ten weeks, ‘The four children remained with me, the, maid, and

my tether who came to“heip three days a week. Upon her return,
ULQPTY-19, bore an air of resignation rather than ef enthusiram and,

“again, as on her previous return from Europe, was physically down

end senta)ly unhappy. When asked about her thoughts on Australia
she said that it she had wanted to live in Australia, she should
have married an Australian, The separation Fad nvt improved our
intiaate relationship.

9. In Avgust I was to take five weeks' leave and f0 with the
children to Astro-World in iouston aad visit my mother’s family in
South Caroltaa, When I suggested postponing making monthly payments
on her father's loan until December when the Christmas Sonus would
cover the back debt, in order to make the trip, she vas adamant,
saying that if I did net have the cash for going, I should not take
leave. I borrow:d from my iife insuraace policy and left with the
three youngest children, Adriana had a touch of aepatitis and
joined us three weeks later. After spending the rionth in South
Carolina, we returned to Mexico to find that LISM2TY-19 had very
much enjoyed her solitude, ‘We had already talked about divorce before
her trip to Holinrd in the spring, I had told her that 1 would not
corsider parting with the children and she said she would consider
leaving them to me if I would settle the debt to her father as well
as give her a substantial share of what she considered was her part
of the house. The title of the house was in my name and had been
since the buying of the land, LISMPTY-19mid I could mortgege or
sell the house but that ihe money was what she was mainly interested
iu, I told her that the sale of the house was not financially
wise in its unfinished state and that the house and land are very
likely to appreciate sharply over the next three or four years
considering the housing developments going on in the area, Added
to this was the sentimental attachment to the house and area, A
mortgage, on the other hanc, for the amount of her father's loan
plus what she was asking, was something I could not afford considering
the more than 12 percent cost of such a mortgage in Mexico.

10, At the same time, during September 1969, that we were going
through the adDove-meationed discussions, LIEMPTY-19 was taking a
cours: at Japan Airlines te become a tour guide and group leader
for trips to the Orient as early as November 1969 and, certainly,
to Expo '70 in Osaka during the spring and summer d 1970. She
received a diploma to that effect. I told her th.t if she wanted
out cf the marriage and wanted to be free to travel it was all
right by me but that the children would stay with me and I would
continue to repay hey father at the agreed rate ($2500 per month
and 5 percent per year), She then sought legal) advice frou an old
friend, Dutch lawyer Guillermo Floris Margadant who, ip turn, steered
her to a young woman lawyer, Dra. Berta Martinez, who must have
advised LIEMPTY-19 that under the local legal system the only way
to try for a sizable cash settlement and considerable support was to
hang on to the children because LIEMPTY-19 made a radical "about-face"
in her attitude concevning them and she now said that she could not



“abandon the children, I refused to visit her lawyer with her
saying I was not interested in getting divorced, whereas she said
that wher wnind was made up and that we would have to split up.

i

11, Things came to a head on the night of 12 Noverber whea I
got home around 9 PM and she sugyerted we have a drink and talk
things over, I mixcd some martinis and she began laying down the
terms under which she thought ve should get divorced, i.e. I stould
move out of the house, mortgage to pay back her father's money,
grant her custody of the children aad support of 2,000 pesos per
rionth per child ($8,000). I said I would not get divorced under
those conditions and we discussed and argued in the kitchen for about
three hours, killing a bottle of gin in the process. We went
upstairs’ and when I tried to make up to her she tried to rouse the
children, unsuccessfully, and then tried to leave the house which
I would not let her do, She got hysterical, phoned a neighbor,

Uta de la Hoz, then she rent into the front yard and awakened the
next door neighbors, Walter Hurley and his wife, and asked to go to
their hcuse. A few minutes later, Uta and her husband Guillermo
came and LIEMPTY-19 went with them to their home two blocks away.
\bout a half{-hcur later I walked up to Uta'’s to ask LIEMPTY-19

to come hume but wes told that she was busy phoniug her lawyer

and would not veturn,

12, The following morning I tyok the children to school as
usual and my sister Marcia (LIEMPTY-4's wife) picked them up ard
took them to her house where I joined tnem for lunch, TY=19
came by in the late afternoon while my sister was cut, picked up
the children saying she was taking them home, failed to do sv, then
disappeared and was not to be found,

ce

13, It was the subsecuent action taken by LIEMPTY-19 in
dropping her lawyers and taxieg on the services of Bernabe Jurado,
the most notorious penal attorney in Mexico, that led to the
potential security hazatds that ensued,



9 March 1970

TO : Case Officer
FROM : GERENDE
SUBJECT: GERENDE Status Report

The present situation of the marital conflict between GERENDE and
his wife (LISMPTY-19) is as follows:

1, GERENDE is living at his mother’s apartment at 99 Carlos
B. Zetina Street, Apartment 9, He has rented a three-bedroom
. apartment at Tornel 2 corner with Pedro Antonio de los Santos where
he-has stored the household effects and furniture removed from his
former address at Ladera 39, Lomas de Bezares.

2, The house at Ladera 39 is rented to an executive of
Chrysler Corporation International, Dr. Leon MARKIEWICZ, hia wife,
and fifteen-year old daughter, all of Argentine nationality, The
monthly rent {s 6,700 pesos M/N and the contract is for two years,

beginning 1 February 1970,

3, LIEMPTY-19 and the four children are apparently still
living at the residence of the Netherlands’ Ambassador, Barco
Schelto Van Heemstra at Pefia 360, Jardines del Pedvegal, It seems
fairly certain they are at that address from things that the two
older children, Adriana and Chris, have said to GERENDE on the last
two occasions he has seen them, They have been there since
5 December 1969. LIEMPTY-19 has denied that she has a fixed address
and says that she is staying with "friends."

4, LIEMPTY-19 is continuing to use the services of Bernabe
Juardo as her lavys > and, through him, is pressing for even more
advantageous terms in the divorce than she had asked in November.
Please see the attached copy and trauslation of the latest proposal
made by Juardo on 4 March 1970,

5, The charges and accusations made by LIEMPTY-19 against
GERENDE are still not completely resolved and are as follows:

a, Insults, threats and attempted homicide -- this charge
rests at the S* Juzgado Penal, 2" Corte Penal located at



Se rm

Lecumberri, The judge is CRUZ Mellado, These charges have
not. been pressed since they were originally made oa 13 November
71969 by LISMPTY-I9, The ruling on these charges, should the
case come to trial, must be made by three judges of the 23 Corte
Penal composed of the 4th, Sth, and 6th Juzgados Penales, The
judge of the 6° Juzgado Lic. QUIRAZCO, an alumnus of
GERENDE's lawyer, Jorge Mario MAGALLON, Together they hav
on two occasions, been to. speak to Judge CRUZ Mellado who
agreed not to,issue an arrest warrant ani who has, finally,
called for a ‘hearing on 16 March (subsequently postponed) at
10;00. MAGALLON bas given GERENDE assurances that the charges
are likely to be dismissed, :

b. Fraud -- this charge was made by LIEMPTY-19 and her
lawyer on 11 December 1969, the day after GERENDE left the
Villa Obregon jail after having spent a weok there for
disobeying a court order. (The court order ‘had consisted of
an unfounded request to have GERENDE expelled from his house
and to have LIENPTY-19 reinstated there with her father, as
the temporary custodian of the children, GERENDE refused them
admissbn under those terms, hence disobeying the Villa Obregon
judge's order, so the judge's secretary arbitrarily ordered,
on the spot, a 10-day detention. Subsequently, the judge,
LUCAS del ARKNAL, was forced to lift the detention after seven
days and dismiss himself from the case and divorce proceedings
as incompetent, The judge-has had to face charges of
collusion from and with the lawyers of both parties, i.e.
Magallon and Jurado, The charge of fraud rests at Mesa 31°
of the Procuraduria del Distrito Federal, The Public Ministry
Agent in charge of that table is Jorge GUTIERREZ Cruz.
LIEMPTY-19 claims that the money lent to her and GERENDE for
building the house at Ladera #39 was actually loaned to buy
the house and that GERENDE, knowing they were married under
the separate property marriage clause hd wrongfully placed

-.the property in his name only, thereby committing fraud,
Actually, the land was bought by GERENDE before Christmas 1965
in a complicated transaction involving three other partners:
Robert Bancroft WHITEHOUSE, John (Dick) RENNA, and James
Walter HURLEY, and each of the partners placed the property
in thoir respective names with the complete knowledge of their
Spouses.- Later the land was subdivided and after nineteen
months the deeds were issued, LIEMPTY-19 supervised and prodded
the notary who made the transaction and she was perfectly aware
that the property was in GERENDE's name, In August 1967 when
construction of the house began, LIESHPTY-19's father's money
was used which he had deposited in Mexico for the purpose,
Since January 1969, according to the terms of the loan
agreement, GSRENDE has been paying it off and has receipts from
LIEMPTY-19 to show for it,

GERENDE has presented both the land deed ("escritura")
pre-dating the construction of the house and the receipts



_ Showing up to date payment of the loan at the "Mesa 31%,"
No further action has been taken by LIEMP€ Y-19 or hor lawyer
on this matter but the charge has not finally been settled and
is still pending. The charge is, of course, unfounded and is
awaiting the proper “lubrication” in order to be filed away,

. €, Neglect -- this charge was made by LIEMPTY-19 in —
December 1969 at the 7° Juzgado Mixto de Paz claiming that
GERENDE had abandoned LIEMPTY-19 and the children to their fate
and that they were utterly destitute. GERENDE was not
notified of.this charge and on 9 February after attending a
hearing at.the Villa Obregon juzgado (see below), once out on
the sidewalk, Judicial police agents detained GERENDE, took
him to the Procuraduria and from there to Lecumberri, This
process involved being finger-printed and mugged, The
following day GERENDE was out on a 2,000 pesos bond and three
days later, 13 February, the justico of the peace (a woman)
formally set GERENDE free for lack of evidence. GERENDE and
Magallon went back on 5 March to pick up the bond money and
see if Jurado had appealed but he had not and, apparently,
that matter is closed,

6, On 14 November 1969, one day after LIEMPTY-19 disappeared
from home’ taking the children with her, GERENDE brought charges
against her for minor lesions and showed. medical proof thereof,
The hearing of 9 February after which GERENDE was detained, was
called by Villa Obregon judge Bonfilio SEGURA. GERENDE reiterated
the charge, LIEMPTY-19 donied it, the judgo ruled against her,
ordered her to prison but since tho injuries were minor, it does
not require privation of liberty and she must only go and sign-in

once a week,

7, \LIEMPTY-19 is at present teaching school at the Edron
Academy on Caleri.Street in San Anget Inn, The two older children
are going to school there, During the latter part of November, all
December and half of January, the children did not attend any
school, -On three occasions GERENDE has been to the school at 13:30
to try to speak to LIEMPTY-19 and see tho children. LIEMPTY-19
has objected to this and the meetings Imve been short and fruitless
except for GERENDE learning that they are still staying at the Dutch
Ambassador's, GERENDS's last visit there was on 3 March (Tuesday).

8. After the Villa Obregon judge dismissed himself from the
divorce proceedings, according to standard procedure, the case
went to Coyoacan and Xochimilco respectively where the judged,
in turn, excused themselves from the case and it has finally come
to reside at the Ist Juzgado Civil in the D,F, The judge is Olda
CORREA (Woman) and hag the reputation of being tough and pretty
straight. Since LIEMPTY-19 has not given an address where divorce
Suit papers can be served her, the suit has not yet been initiated
on GERENDE's purt. LIEMPTY-19, on the otherMmnd, has not had



y eee
ee) Saues) -

GERENDE served with papers though his current address is known,
apparently because she is still seeking a voluntary divorce along ©
the lines and terms which are stated in the accompanying set of
_. Proposals, GERENDE cannot begin to accept these proposals ia
. their-present form as they are patently unfair and hardly a point

: to beginning bargaining from.

= werb. fF


8 March 1970

The following proposals were made to GERENDE on 4 March 1970
(Monday) by LIEMPTY-19's lawyer, Bernabe Jurado, through a mutual
friend, Licenciado Carlos Heyu, to wit;

TERMS under which the problem of (LigMPTY-19] and [Raymond H, | 7
GERENDE] couid be solved.

1. The right (patria potestad) to the minors would be kept
by both the mother and father,

2, The guardianship and custody of the four children is
‘entrusted to the mother, The father may visit the children once
a week between 10:00 and 19:00 hours; he may take them out once a
month and will return them to the mother's address before 19:00.

SUMMARY

_ 1, There has been no change in the operating procedures of
the two LIEMPfY base houses, L{CALLA and LILYRIC, or in the use
“made of the product, Raymond H, GERENDE contioues as Project
principal agent, and renewed attempts have been made to broaden his
activities, to include additional agent bandiing and the following
up of ops leads. After a slow start, some progress has been made,
fires GERENDE is now involved -in divorce proceedings with his wife.

q

This situation is steadily worsening and represents a potential
security risk to LISMPTY and other Station operations.

GERENDE

2. As Headquarters is aware, the Station has for some time
tried to get additional mileage out of GERENDE. The Station has
long recognized GERENDS's not inconsiderable talents: He is personabld
fluent ia two languages (to the poiat where he can pass either as a
Mexican or an American with no trouble), he has considerable :
experience in support activities, he has knowledge of the local
scene which would be hard to duplicate, and he is completely at the
Station's disposal, He has also worked for RVROCK for close to
15 years, in effect making a career of RVROCK, and the Station
believes that this long period of service imposes on RVROCK an
obligation to see that he is fairly treated and provided with benefits
which would not otherwise be due an agent with less longevity. On

[ee other hand, GERENDE has picked up some bad habits—-he is not
punctual, his written reports leave much to be desired, and worst, of
tall, he lacks drive and ambition, ;

3. After several largely abortive attempts to get GERENDE to
follow up operational leads (and after noting, at the same time, a
fine job-he did in recruiting LIRICE-13), the Station decided to
present GERENDE with what amounted to an ultimatum; Following a
six-week léave at the home of rélatives in the US, he was told that
in recognition of his past services he was being given a salary
increase ‘to.$7,000 US per annum (which may not scem like much until
it is realized that GERENDE pays no taxes on this, and has the use
of a Q@ car, to boot). He was also told that he would be given a
number of leads to follow up (in some cases persons to whom he had
natural access; in other cases leads which he would follow up under
is well'as agents to handle (in alias). It
a mt “take advantage of this opportunity to perform
up to’his level of ability; if he did so, Headquarters would be
willing to work out an annuity program which would relieve his
(Worries about eventual retirement. If he did not put out, he could
expéct to be terminated by the end of FY 1970, GERENDE expressed
Nn his gratitude and his willingness to put his shoulder to the wheel,
; and, in fact, he has doiie.so.’ In October 1969 he took over the
handling of LIANVIL-1-froa Oliver G. SCANTLING, and the Station hes
started to give him leads to follow up, His performance has improved
in every way--his punctuality hae improved, his written reports
are continually improving, and he has made the effort to devise
approaches to the various leads and to start to follow up on them.

4, The Station was therefore highly encouraged, until 24
October, when GERENDE reported that his wife wanted a divorce,
problem is basically one of incompatibility of personalities,

. exacerbated by the fact that GERENDE’s operational activities
resulted in his being home more often than a man who works a normal
office day. GERENDE's wife had taken a long vacation alone earlier
in the year, visiting -her parents, and the leave taken by GERENDE,
referred to above, followed his wife's return and did aot include

- cher, Both times GERENDE had the four children, Thus the news of
\y the divorce request did not come as a real surprise. The problem,

} however, is that both parties want custody of the children, and the

# dispute becomes daily more bitter and more violent, The station

|? $ bas taken the position that security of GERENDE's operations must

J-,. jbe preserved at all costs, hoping, of course, that the divorce can

ig >be avoided, At this writing, the outcome cannot be guessed, If

jv @]the bitter fight results im the surfacing of GERENDE's RVROCK

7 employment, LILYRIC and LICALLA are faced with at least ame threat

of exposure, ‘The MHHARSHers are quite aware that a LILYRIC-like

facility exists; whether they suspect LICALLA is a moot question,

LICALLA is in many ways more useful, and the MHHARSHers could put

it out of business very easily by making their wall higher, Little

could, or probably would, be done to prevent LILYRIC from functioning.

\’ handled by GERENDE (LILYRIC and LICALLA personnel and LIEMPTY-4)
*\ other Station assets whose security might be affected by GERENDE's
*\ current problems include LIENTRAP, LIRICE-13, and the PCM OP.
GERENDE is also aware of the fact that some sort of operation,

presumably technical, is or has been conducted from the LIMESA
complex; he is aware of the existance and knows some of the members

the LIEMBRACE team (LIEMBRACE-1, -2, and -4, among the curreatly

Th his 15 years, GERENDE has worked in almost every phase of the
Station's ‘support activities, and even though in recent years he
has been pretty much restricted to LIEMPTY, his knowledge of
activities and assets which are still current is considerable,
is too early to judge the-outcome of GERENDE's problems, but the
Station is making every effort to see that security of operations
is not affected by whatever decision is reached,

LICALLA

6. The LICALLA base house has continued to function as in the
past, LIEMPTY-9 continues to be a conscientious recorder of events.
In addition to providing about 3,500 photos during the reporting i
period, as well as comments on events and relationships which are
noted by him, he had provided special, coverage as requested on
various ‘targets of interest, such as ‘AETAKEOFF, During GERENDE's © ‘
absence on leave, LIEMPTY-9 was handled by SCANTLING.

LILYRIC

LIKMPTY=13, -14, -26, and -27 have continued to provide

_-daily logs of the coming! and goings of all officers, and about

reported -on the visits of Americans ten different times, and provided
special coverage in connection with AEBURBLE, SCLEASE-2, and one
other LNSRGO walk-in case, LILYRIC personnel were also handled by
SCANTLING during GERENDS's absence.

LIEMPTY=4

“8, As in the past, LIEMPTY-4 has done the developing and
printing of all LICALLA and LILYRIC photos, and most of the LIENTRAP
production. LIEMPTY-4 was handled by FERNALD during GERENDE's
absence.

| COMMENTS

9, LIEMPTY coverage of the MHHARSH installation continues to
be a useful tool in the Station's operations against the MHHARSH
target. One IA in the Station spends several hours per week processi:
the take, keeping mug book and files up to date, checking the infor-
mation in the logs against other reports when required (to determine
whether or not an agent or contact entered the MHHARSH installation
as claimed; or whether an AEGRIP or AEKICK officer was out of the
installation at a particular time, etc.) and analyzing the LICALLA
production for insight into personal relationships, Useful
by-products include continual up-dating of BSIIARSH license plates
and observation of demonstrations outside of the Embassy and
renovations within the grounds. Furthermore, in GERENDE the Station
has been attempting to develop Qn outside asset with considerable
flexibility, who has been used to make recruitments and assessments
as well as handle agents. GERENDE's personal problems are placing
his own career in jeopardy and posea potential security hazard to
LIEMPTY and other Station operations. This is_a_problem wi | will
be dealt with and resolved in the next repor iod and prior

to the next Project renewal request. ( nina

relationship with IN-S, and he “showed that he is quite capable,
with proper case officer puidance, of providing usetul service to
the Station in the handling of agents beyond the support type to
which he had been limited in the past, The Station intends to try
to expand this rele, with due regard for sccurtty and for GeRENDE'Ss
limited experience, Nurthermore, the Station stilt bas every
intention ot using GSRENDE selectively in cultivation and development
04 operational leads, as outlined in reference, No such leads wore
found for GERENDE ducing the reporting period (among other reasons,
we have no intention o1 giving GERENDE a lead simply for the sake of
giving him somethirs to do), but as soon as a suitable lead is
uncovered, it will be passed. to GERENDE.

4. GSRENDE was particulary useful during the Olympic period,
While he did not-get-a job with the Olympic Committee as he had
hoped, his wife was eaployed as a translator by the European televisio!
networks who had ccne to cover the games. This, plus other personal
contacts, gave GERINDY a certain amount ot access to Olympic facilitied.
Both GERENDE and his wife helped considerably in the distribution of
AEEGGHEAD material, acd GERENDE performed a number of miscellancous
tasks assisting the Station in various Ulympic responsibilities,

5, GERENDE has also been used in support: of JNROD operations,
. Such as making mail pick-ups and delivering material and making phone
calls to AMBASSUON, ¥ollowing thy Warsaw Pact Powers’ invasion ot
Czechoslovakia, GESENDS way asked to cover a demonstration in front
of the Soviet Mnbassy, and he wrote a good report which was used in
smbassy briefings, Recently, GERENDE has enrolled at the
University of the americas to work for an M.A, in contemporary
Mexican history, The Station will explore the possibility of his
getting access to persons or inJormation of Interest on the University

campus,

ICALLA

6, LIENPTY-9's vork (in the LICALLA base house) was inhibited
in July due to the construction of a maid's room near his working
quarters, During the reporting period, however, he took a total of
2,217 operational photos, His regular reporting and commentary
continued as in the past, LIEMPTY-9 is a steady and dependable per-
former, and his unique vantage point remains the source or the most
interesting and revealing photos.as well as often very informative

reporting.

LILYRIC

LILYRIC base house manned on a regular basis trem 0800 to 1800 hours
weekdays and OSOO te 1300 hours on Saturdays, with other hours cover-
able upon request, Ris has proven to be a iar netter arrangement
than depending on LixIT=D for some of this coverage, In addition to
the 6,703 operationai photos taken during the reporting period and the
daily iixed surveillauce reports, LILYRIC reporting is of considerable

1. Some attention should be devoted, if it has not already
deen, to the dangers involved in this operation and particularly
to what countermeasures the target may institute, or may already
have instituted.

2. One current danger certainly exists, to wit, the exist-
ence of project Licalla base, which is in the group of buildings
comprising the Limesa complex. ne of the agents at Licalla
dase'is known to one of the Lipstick agents arrested in the
summer of 1958, and it is, hence, possible that both the host
government and the target kmovs of Licalla. It is suggested
that perhaps Licalla should be terminated. The reason has been
advanced that this should not be done since the agent would be
suspicious and in aay event Licalla might serve as a red herring
for Limesa. It is believed that the Licalla agent could be
gotten out of this operation without arousing his suspicion. The
Station could mount an obvious tail on him; vhen he reported it,
he could be told he had probably been made and that, hence, the
operation should no longer continue. The agent has been a good
one and could be used elsewhere on some other work. Licalla
house is going to be repaired soon. ‘This might be a good oppor-
tunity to stop work there and let some innocent party rent it.
That would be a better red herring.

3. Concerning the manner in vhich Limesa houses vere acquired
by the Station, it should be kept in mind that the purchase mechantam
was identical with that used in Limited. ‘The watchman at Limited
knew an American owned it and told this to vhat to him must have
seened a casual visitor to the premises when it was under repairs,

We should, therefore, assume the targets know an American owns it
and that it is blown. Therefore, we should also assume that if
the targets have conducted any sort of an investigation of Linesa
houses, they may vell have discovered that the same ultimate ovner
is involved. So far as is known, the bank which fronts for the
purchases has not been checked to see if any inquiries have been
mede. We must agree the targets have the capability to find out
who the front owner is--the bank-- and fron there coula possibly
establish the identity of the owner, Limousine, Limousine and his
firms have also deen. used as cover for uther Station agents and
operations apart fron Limesa and Limited.

See af:



4, It should not ve forgotten that a person tried toth to
rent and buy Limesa properties earlter in the year after ve
owned thea. So far as we know, a check on this person vas not
productive of suspicious data, but the question arises ag to how
thorough the investigation vas. Fossibly the name the man gave
‘tien making inquiries vas false, meaning that in effect the right
péreon has never been investigated at all. Knoving that the
targets have in the past shown some interest in the Linesa build-
ings, it 16 not beyond the realm of reason that this man vas sent
by then, The story he gave for wishing to rent the house-~because
1t was handy and close to a certain school--is identical vith the
story used ty the Station to cover rental of Licalla almcst next

door.

5. ven granting that the true ownership of Linesa has not
been discovered by the targets, they have various recourses through which
to establish the identity and activity of the occupants thereof. ‘The
following possibilities suggest themselves:

a. ter into litigation with Limesa omer over exact

boundaries or otuer pretext, demanding property be
surveyed. On court order, Limesa could be inspected

thoroughly.
b. Undermine target side of Limesa walls, leading to

possible condemnation of property by local governnent
or necessity various repairs, etc.

¢. Sabotage of electricity (causing fire) or water or
sevage, necessitating entry into Limesa of outside per-
sons, who could be infiltered by target agents.

4. Reming by vehicle, with simtlar results, police,
firenen, etc. :

e. Complaint to medicnl authorities on filth, refuse, ete.,
leading to inspection by health authorities.

f. Various other approaches might be discussed.

6. One general recommendation can be made: sensitive material

should be used and kept in a.crypt, and a good one, rather than in
the relatively insecure special room nov planned as the onerational

room.

7. Beyond this, every effort should be made to see to it that
the operators have good cover. The idea of clothing then in local

clothing is excellent and shows right thinking in that direction.

REFERENCE 3 HMMA-33459, 8 November 1967

Summar,

1, During the reporting period, the project's principal
agent, Raymond H, GHRENDE, was assigned additional tasks, aimed
at broadening his usefulness to tho Station, These tasks
included spotting and assessment as well as the handling of a
recruited agent, ERFAIN-3,* GERENDE did well, and it is believed
that a new dimension has been opencd for him, and by the same
token, the Station has, in effect, gained a new asset. The
LIEMPTY base houses continued to produce at their usual rate
and with their usunl effective support to Station REDTOP oper=
ations, The LIMITED Base House and its oporator, LIEMPTY-6, —
were terminated on 31 May 1968, Termination was decided upon
partly to save money and partly because advancing age had measur
ably decreased the reliability and effectivoness of LIEMPTY-6's
work, LIEMPTY-26 was rehired, which pormitted the LILYRIC Base
House to give us the same total hours of coverage as LILYRIC

and LIMITED had together in the past,

GERENDE

2. During the. report period, tne ease officer has been
neeting GERENDY an average of three times per.weck, Meetings
are usually pre-arranged, at various sites and times, Meetings
average 20 to JO minutes, GERENDE turns over to the case
otiicer negatives, prints, logs, and other reports which he has
Pickcd up from the base houses since the previous meoting,

alon; with brief contact reports on his meetings with base

house representatives, Reports on other operational activities
are also turned in and discussed, and GERENDE is given instruc-
tions, notes for'the base houses, and negatives for any enlarge=
ments which may be desired by the Station. Also, LIENVOY tapes
and transcripts are exchanged at each meeting, (The departure

of LIACUTE-1 at the end of April 1968 left the Station without a
BEDOX transcriber, As a temporary solution, pending the return
of LIACUTE-1 or the recruitment of another BEDOX transcriber,
GERENDE's wile, LIEMPTY-19, has been hired at the rate of 31.50
pesos per hour to transcribe the Spanish language portions of the
tapes, She does tho work in her home, and GERENDE transports the

tapes.)

3. GERENDE has the direct agent-handling responsibility for
the following LIEMPTY agents: LIEMPTY-4 (photo~processor; met
twice per week); LIEMPTY-G (LIMITED; met once per week until
termination); LIUMPTYs 13, 14, 26, and 27 (LILYRIC; LIEMPTY-13
normally met twice per wook -~ in his absence LIEMPTY~27 makes
meetings); and LIEMPTY-9 (LICALLA; met twice per week). ile is
responsible for directing their work, paying them, and handling
all of the adwninistrative problems which may develop, To judge
from the results, GERENDE has excellent rapport with these agents
ana is able to get a consistently high performance rate from
them -- particularly LICALLA and LILYRIC personnel,

4, As noted in reference, GERENDE was omployed by the
Mexican MHRAVEL committee, which we found a useful side benefit,

His MURAVEL activity during tne reporting period has been minimal,

but we expect it to start picking up again, GSRENDE has con-
ducted a few discreet inquiries and investiations for us within
the MHRAVEL complex, and we have instructed him to try to fet
an assignment which will keep him as close to the FJSTEAL
delegation as possible,

5. Reference also pointed out that GERKNDE had persormed
Nicely in the cultivation and development of an operational
lead, and that the Station planned to sive GERENDE more of the
sane. Furthermore, GERENDE's standing. gnents (LIEMPTY
hase houses, MIRAVIL activity, and occasional support o: JMROD
requirements) were not challenging enougi or vccupying enough
of GERENDE'S timo, GERENDE is rather firmly committed to
WOFIRM by virtue of the fact that he has worked for WOVIRM for
over 15 years and has no other outside employment of any
consequence, fy the same token, he was, throurh no fault of
his own, doiny less work ror WOFIRM than at any time in his
career, GERENDE's operational exposure throuch the years
dictated more and more vestrictions on his activity, for sound
security reasons, The solution to GERINDE's problem (lac: of
A promising future) and the Station’s (not setting its money's
worth) seened to be to give GHREND# additional tasks which he
could handle “under suitable cover and with due regard to security
precautions, Since most of GeRENDE's support activities had
been axainst the FJSTEAL target, particular care would have to
be taken in committing him further in this direction, It was
decided, therefore, that his principal retooling would be in

a non-FJSTEAL /ield,

u. Inline with the above reasoni GERENDE was introduced
to Anarew RB, DOSCHER on-17 February 196 The idea was that
GERENDE would be “trained to assist DOSCHER in some of his
operations arains€ Central American tarzets, GERENDE's principal
duty thus far has beon -to take over the handling of
undet INSCRER's close supervision and guidance, GE!
perforned auite ereditably in this task, He scems interested
in the werk and has learned quickly, On the other hand, an
apparently ingrained habit of procrastination has resulted in
dilatory reporting, If GERENDE can overcome this (and both case
officers are working; hard to teach GEKKNDE the importance of
prompt and complete reporting) there seems to be every reason
to Believe GsRENDE will develop into a competent agent handler.

7. GSRENDS was also given the task of locating and developing
(in alias) a sirl who, per LIENVOY, was being cultivated by
AERODENT. Although GERENDE had to be continually reminded of the
assignment, he did an excellent job of meeting the girl and
gaining her confidonce, It 1s quite likely that he could have
recruited the girl as an access arent against AERODENT, but aé
this point was reached another operation against ‘AERODENT was
launched and it was not felt that attempting to recruit the girl
would serve any useful purpose, tor the time being at least
(among other thing: there was no indication that she had had
any contact with AEZRODENT for some months), The only flaw in
GERENDE's performance was tho time it took him to get around to
doing the job, It should be mentioned, however, that at the
same time GERENDE had a number of pressing personal matters to
attend to, including overseeing the completion of his new house,
which he finally moved into on 10 March 1968, even though
construction is still not entirely completed.

8, Among other assignments completed by GERENDE in the
reporting period wore tho renting of an apartment for use as a
Listening post; and initiating a relationship with a Russian
translator working for the MURAVEL committee,

LICALLA

9. The star of the LIEMPTY show, as far as quality of
performance is concerned, continues to be LIEMPTY-9, His
favorable lecation and his perceptiveness continue to result in
revealing photos and equally revealing commentary, In addition
to the 2,908 operational photos taken during the reporting
period, he has provided daily, weekly, and monthly summaries and
‘notes, Semi-nonthly attendance reports (of FJSTEAL personnel
spotted by him), various special reports, and special intensive
coverage of the following: 201-120123; 201-107668; 201-271102;
and 201-305870. As of 1 May 1968 LIEMPTY-9's salary was raised
from 4,000 pesos to 4,500 pesos per month, LIEMPTY-9 was also
given pernission to have a maid's room constructed on the roof
of his apartzent. The original maid's room 1s LIEMPTY-!)'s photo
point, The maid, who has been with the family for 11 years
(since she was 10) eicher sleeps in the hall, where she is in the
way, or in the bedroom of LIEMPTY-9's nine-year old son, which
LIEMPTY-9 feels is berinning to be not a proper arrangement.

The room will be built at a point on the roof away from the
FJSTEAL installation (so as to arouse as little suspicion as
possible), and the fact that the maid will be seen going in and
out of the rcom regularly should quiet any suspicions which may
arise, Construction work put LICALLA out of action starting

24 June, but it is expected that the work will be finished by
20 July.

his blanket coverage is useful
insurance that all activity 1s caught. Combined wath the

daily fixed surve(llance reports on all members of the FJSTEAL
Gnstallation, the Station can safely Ray that its coverage of
FJSTEAL, installation ingress and egress is complete during
working hours (and any extra hours which tho Station vishes
covered), Since 1 May LILYRIC has been on duty — 57 hours per
Geek: 0800-1800 weekdays and QS00-1500 Saturdays. Connensurate
wich their new schedule (and the return of LIEMPTY-26 to the
active roster), the total monthly LILYRIC salary has cone from
4,900 pesos per month to 6,000 pesos per month (LIESPTYSs 13,

14, 26, and 27, aro of courso, father, mothor, and two sons).
The fixed surveillance reports are used on a daily basis, since
the Station constantly has operational interest in knowing
whether a particular FJSTEALER was "in" or "out" at a particular
time, and if our, who he went with, what time he left, etc.

In addition, LILYRIC has standing instructions to notify
GERENDE (and GERENDE the Station) immediately when American-
appearing visitors come to the FJSTEAL installation, Sight such
visits were noted in the reporting period, along with a number
Of other visitors who, for one reason or another, attracted the

should be pointed out that

LIMITED

11, LIKYPTY-6 slowed down noticoably in the reporting period
He was ill several times, his surveillance reports were occa~
sionally inaccurate, and his photosraphic work was poor. With
the assurance that LILYRIC would be able to take up the slack
(and give us better coverage for less money) the decision was
made to terminate the LIMITED base house. While we are thereby
denied some of the flexibility which we have had in the past,
St is likely that LIEMPTY-6 would slowly havo faded out of the
picture anyway, While he was in there, he produced 911 opera~
tional photos, as well as daily fixed survelllance reports.
Following his termination (a report ot which is beings t rded
separately) LIEMPTY-6 took a trip to Europe and has now started
working. full-time in the insurance business for his son-in-law,
there he has gained a new lease on life. In other words, the
termination couldn't have been nore amicable, LIENPTY-8 vacated
the LIMITED apartment (he said he could not afford to: keep
paying the rent) and it is no longer available to the Station.

St ig larceir designed to support, the REDTOP section. In the
three-monty geriod covered by this progress report, GERENDS was
met by the case officer 32 times, Ncetings were normally preo
arranged, with times and sites varied (with the introduction of
the new ease officer, most of the corner regular meeting sites

For this reason, he has been asked to provide special coverage on
various individuals of interest, or on particular days when cover~

CONTACT AND COMMUNICATIONS

3. During the period under roview, 30 meotings were held with GERENDE by
the Project Case Officer, Meeting sites and times vere varied to avoid
establishing a pattern and most moetings were scheduled at the previous meeting.
Several unscheduled meetings wore held during this period and vere arranged by
the Case Officor telephoning GEH:NDE to establish the meeting tice and site. ‘
TMmes and sites are coded when discussed by telephone and are arranged in such
a way as to appear to be a normal conversation. Telephone calls to GERENDE are

‘made from pay booths located away from the LNPURE installation.

1, \GERENDE held twice veckly, clandestine meetings vith LIEMPTY-b, -6, ;
-9, ~10, -11 and -13. These regular meetings dre all prearranged and are held
at various sites and at various times of the day so that meetings correspond
vith the regular habits and movonents of the basehousekeepers and LILNTRAP
operators. * }

5. All assets involved in the LIEMPTY project performed in a most
satisfactory manner during the period under review. LIFHUD-4 has been extremly
efficient in developing and printing negatives provided by the other assets.

PRODUCTION AND ACTIVITIES. i

6, LICALLA, During thio perfod LIEMPTY -9, operator of the LICALLA i
vaschouse, provided 1,239 franec of operational photographs covering the patio
and garden of the FJSTEAL installation, the area where many of the officers, i
family members and visitors congregate. This coverage 1c especially valuable
because the officers are usually at their leisure and often gather into
fmetional groupings. LIEMPTY-9 16 very observant andi his cornents and notes
are considered of great value to the Station, All photos provided by LIEMTY-9
are accompanied by a fixed-survetllance report.

7. LILYRIC. This basehouso is staffed vy LIGPTY-13, -14, and -27 with
LIEMPTY-1h nnd -27 providtnr: most of the coverage because of the full-time
outside employment of LIEMPTY-15, During this period the LILYRIC basehouse
provided 2,716 frames of operational photographs covering the only vehicle and
pedestrian entrence into the target installation, All photogra:
accompanied by tixed-survelllance reports on individual members
the target installation, The operators are often able to grovide the license
plate numbers of vehicles used by visitors to the target installaticn, which

in many cases help to identify the visitor,

8, LIMITED, The operator of the LIMITED basehouse is LIEMPTY-6. The
LIMITED basohouse also provides covernge of the only vehicle and pedestrian
entrance to the FUSTEAL installation, but from a different angle, and the
comments mde relative to coverage in the section on LILYRIC also pertain to
LIMITED, ‘The LIMITED baschouse provided 557 frames cf operational photographs
during this period, LIMITED alce serves as the radio alert for the LIEMMUCE
surveillance team, although the practice of using a radio alert is being de+
creased. On two occasions during this period LIEMPTY-€ was elertins for the
teen in a deception exercise, since the tean was not working the FUSTEAL
target. This was done on instructions from the Station end LIENPTY-é was not
told that’ these were deception exercises.

9. LIENTRAP, During this pertod as in the last reporting period, the
LISWPRAP mobile surveillance unit was targetted mainly against the local
Communist parties as vell as nezbers of other Herisvhere parties vio are
Living or are in exile in Nexico. ‘The LIENTRAP opereters are LISSTY-10
and LIEMPTY-11 and during this period they produced 564 frames of
vhotorravhs. LIFMPTY-10 and LI:MPTY-1 also service over 20 postal boxes
which are used es accomcdation adiresses by the Mexico City Station, Head-

quarters and other field stations.

10, Raymond H. GSRENDE, Aside from his regular duties as the Frinciyel
Agent for the LIEMWTY Project, GENENDE also provided valuable assistance in the
furtherance of objectives involved in the JMROD operation, In this regant,
Thomas G, URQUHART, Headquarters cfficer, held approxjmately seven operational

meetings with GERSIDE during this reporting period.

Action Required:. For Your Inforsation

1. In Decenter 1966 Raymond H. GERENDE, Prineipal Agent for tbe LIEMPTY
Project, was asked to prepare a security resume, including his opinions, on
the security of the LILYRIC, LIMITED and LICALLA Basehouses vi: is Soviet
knowledge of their existence, Tha following paragraphs contain a slightly
edited version of GERENDE's roport, which was received on 28 Docesbur 1966,
Station comments follow GERENDE’s and are so noted.

LIL

2, In ita present new location LILYRIC is the newest of the photo bases
under my control, According to LIEMPTY-15, there has been no indication of

interest of any sort by the Soviets in the family's move to the nev apartment
nor was there in the past any show of intorest or peculiar behavior on their
(Soviet's) part with regard to the old base and tho possibility that they might”

be under photo surveillance.

3. The cover for the work carried on by this base is good since the
wife, LIEMPTY-14, vho does most of the work has no trouble in justifying
her presence at howe all of the time, The son, LIEMPTY-27 is a medical
student and attends his classes regularly and can justify his hours as
study hours. (He continues to be an excellent student and war exeapted fron
/~ examinations at the end of this, his second year in medical schocl. Actually,
he studies most of the night). LIFMPTY-13 ‘requires no cover as he has a
full-time job as vroduction manager for a large concern and he usually makes
his meetings with GERNDE on his vay to or from work.

4, ‘The set-up in the old as well ao the nev base is ths followings
The oquipment - caméra, scope and tripod -.{s mounted in one ‘bedroom behind
venetian. blinds with one slat removed. This room is locked to keep servants
or any. chance intruder fron entering. The operators do not spend all their
time behind the camera, but go to the adjoining bedroom vhere a table and
typewriter are set up and vhero the dally logs are transcribed, knitting done,
or dome other activity that does not require: full concentration 16 carried out.
‘The curtains and blinds in this room are kept partially or fully open to allow
good visibility and provide a norml appearance. Most of the daily movement of
the Soviet ‘personnel 1s followed from this room and vhen it is necessary to

_take pictures of visitors, unknown persond or novly arrived Soviets, the
‘operators go to the other room and use the pre-set equipaent.

5+ GERENDE's Coment. It seeus to me that any careful observation by
the Soviets would have revualed the tell-tale position of the venetian blinds
in both the old and the now bases. I have no doubt that the Soviets realize
they are under photo surveillance, The move by the fanily from the old to the
new building aust surely have been noted by the Soviets. Possibly the Soviets
think the family is working with the local authorities due to LIEMPIY-13's

former association with the Mexican Aray.

6. Station Comments. The Station agrees vith GERENDE that careful
observation by the Soviets vould have revealed the missing slat in the venetian
blinds and also the fact that those blinis are seldom open. The Station also
asrees that the Soviets realizo that they are under photo survetllance.

is was pointed out recontly when a Soviet shielded an LNEKGO valk-in when
they passed the front gate of the Mnbassy and made a sign to the walk-in
indicating that they could be seen ty someone watching with a telescope
troa the buildings across the street. Alco, as Heedquarters is avare, there
have been numerous comments by residents of Mexico City to the effect that
anyone entering the Soviet Unbassy is photographed; however, seldom has it
been rumored that the “Americans” are doing it, which might indicate acst people
belteve the Mexican Governcent is doing any such photographing and thereby
reaffirming GERENDE's statement that the Soviots possibly believe the Mexican

Government runs the base.

7. Given the assumption that the LILYRIC base is blown, the Station at
this point does not plan to terminate or revamp the LILYRIC installation,

Any operational change by the operators would be spotted by the Soviets and

if the Base were closed the Soviets would start looking for a new installation,
‘The LILYRIC Base is performing a useful function and it is believed that it
will continue to do so. The Soviets nave had opportunities to complain to

the Mexican Government about being monitored photographically and have not

seen fit to do so and it is believed that they probably will not do so unless
there is a radical change in soviet and/or Mexican policy. The Station has
instructed GEHENDE to take every precaution during his meetings with LIFMPTY-13
to assure that LIEMPTY-13 does not lead the Soviets to him and thereby
Jeopaniizing other operations, eapecfally LICALLA.

LINITED

8, The operator of the LIMITED Base, LIEMPTY-d,is, to ay knowledge,
the oldest hand in the photo gurveillance of the Soviet target and possibly
the mcst likely to be "burned", His residence for years at the former Base
(now the site of the new LILYRIC building) end his move to the present base
could not have gone unnoticed by the Soviets. His cover is that of an
insurance salesman, but he actually does not work at the cover and is ut

a disadvantage in trying to explain his source of income. At times, in years
Past, he had to afford full-time coverage from the base, vhich elloved him

to engage in credible cover activities.

9. GERENDE Comments. I do not believe that LIEMPTY-6/LIMITED is a
security risk; however, his present means of working from an open door leading
to his balcony probably can be spotted by the Soviets, LIENPTY-6 is extremely
cautious about checking himself for surveillance when making meetings.

LILYAIC aloo apply lu LIFiTED.” Alco, the uso of LIMITED no the radio alert
tose for the LIEMERACE curveilinnce tee has weakened tho oecurity of this
tase. In regard to LIMITED, LICOWL-1 has reported that the Soviets are very”
interested in LIEMPTY-6/LIMITED ond that co many Sovioto have talked to him
(LICOL-1) about LIEMPTY-6 that he fe convinced that the Soviets have @ “fear”
\ and on “obsession” about LIHITY-6, LICo#L-1 reported on 3 January 1967
that the Subject of 201-744342 nnd the. Subject of 201756160 asked hia on
19 Docenber 1966 for full dotailo known to him about LIFMPTY-6 and Subject of
201-756168 went so far as to say that he believes that LUDPTY-6 is “watching

the Soviets".

\ LICALA
11. When the Soviets raised the heteht of the wnll in their backyard
about tvo years ago, they could have blocked completely the view of this
: ece's working Window by making the vall a fev inches higher. Since thoy did
: not do thie, it would seem to indieate that they are not avere that their
setivities are being monitored from this point. On the other hand, in recent
aonths LIEMPTY-9, the. operator, has reported that ectivitios in the back
: yard have been curtailed more and more. For example, the women no longer
: |. congregate there datly, the school children enter their classes by a route
not visible to LIEMPIY-9 ar. the trees and shrubs havo not been trinmed in
: : years, waking LIEMPTY-9's view poor in coct directions. LIHM@TY-9 says that
' ie ha never noticed any undue interest in his house or his activities by
i the Soviets, Aecess to the operating room can be soon from the window which’ '
: Z LIEMPTY-9 believes to be tho como room in the target inatallation. rakes

4 12. The cover for this base is that of a normal residence. LIEMPTY-9's
cover work is that of a car and insurance salesman in a local automobile
agency in the afternoon only. LIEMPTY-3 does work in his cover. LIEMPTY-9's
cover for the use of the operating room is that he doco accounting work for
client firms, ‘The door is kept locked at all times and LIEMPTY-9 never allows

the eervant to enter, even for cleaning purposes. Tho equipment is kept
locked in a trunk within the room when not in use and all logo and photos

are kept ina safe located in LIEMTY-' *g bedroom closet.

13. -GERENDE Comment. I bolieve the Soviets are aware of the photo
surveillance being carried out by this bace due to the pouition of the window
and the curtains during the hours when LIAPTY-9 is operating.

1k, Station Comment, The Station does not believe that this photo base
4a known to the Soviets, This belief 10 tased on the fact that the LICALLA
coverage is excellent and there has been no indication that the Soviets act
for tho benefit of observers while they are in the backyard. It is interesting
to note that the Soviets made no effort to “protect” the LNERGO walk-in mentioned
in paragraph 6 above during a visit to the backyard and LICALLA did obtain
photographs of the walk-in, The school children no longer pass through the
backyard because the location of tas school vas recently chanzed and the children
now go by another route. The Station has instructed GHILNDE to take every pre~
caution in order to protect the security of the LICALLA base.

15. As a general coment pertaining to the security of the bases in-
volved in Project LIEMPTY, it should be noted that the Soviets are aware of
the fact that LIMOUSINE is the owner/builder of the now LILYRIC building.
LIMOUSINE 1s alco the owner of the LIMESA complex, through a holding company.

16. The Station realizes that most of the detaila reported in this
dispatch are mown to Headquarters; hovever, the Station wanted to make the
opinions of the Principal Agent end the Station a matter of record in a

During the period under review, Raymond H. GERENDS vas seen 2. tines in
regular operational meetings by the LIAMPTY Project case officer. Mo basic
changes other than the regular preplanned variations in meeting sites and
“times vere made in the Project commnication channels. The up-dated and
revised emergency communication systee for contact with GERENDS (see
HMMA-263535, dated 21 February 1966) reasins in effect. All regular contact
with the active LIEMPTY agents (LIE@TYs -4, -6, -9, -10, -11, -15, -15,
and -26) was maintained via Raymond H. GkRENDS. GERENDE met each of the
“above cited agents, with the excertion of LIEMPTYs -14, and -26, two times
each week in clandestine meetings, The operational performance of all active
LIEMPTY agents, including GERENDS vas most satisfactory. The performance
“of LIEMPTY-b in “assisting the local WACRE section with its photosraphic

Processing was outstanding,

| 3. ACCOMPLISHMENTS, PROGRESS AND ACRTEVENENTS

A. SUMMARY - Throughout the reporting period, the LIEMPTY Project contimed
to provide the vast majority of the operational photographs and surveillance
reports used by the Station in its planriing and operations against the
LIMERICK installation and personnel. The LIEMPTY coverage has proved to be
@ particularly reliable tool for: folloving the daily comings and goings
of the LIMERICK personnel; providing leads to and confirming the identi-
fications: of new LIMERICK staffers and also visitors to the LINBRICK install
tion; providing leads to tha relative rank and the specific intelligence
service affiliation of various LIMSRICK officers; keeping the Station abreast
of construction and physical changes in the LIMERICK physical plant; and

">" providing a reliable check on various Station and LNERGO access agents,

‘ During the quarter under review, Project LIFMPTY basehouses provided 5,003
frames of operational photographs (69 rolls) as well as 1,290 paces of
fixed surveillance reports covering the wovenents of the LIMERICK staffers.

B. LIENTRAP - Throughout this period, the LIENTRAP aobile unit was again
targetted heavily against leaders and meeting sites of the locel Communist
parties ag vell as other targets of opportunity, particularly Haitian,
Guatemalan and Honduran Communist exile leeders now resident in Mexico.
LIENTRAP provided up-dated and/or nev identifieation photographs vhich

are of value to doth the JMPIGER and the Station recruitment /penetration
‘program. This apparat provided a total of 237 operational photographs,
vhile the personnel attached to this LIENTRAP unit regularly serviced 23
postal accoumodation addresses used by Mexico City Station, Hesdquarters and

other field Stations.

C,. LIMITED - During this quarter, the LIM(TED basehouse provided 724 frames
of operational film as well as daily physical surveillance reports covering
the arrival and departure of all LINERICX personnel and visitors at the

front gate of that installation during the evening and week-end hours, In
addition, LIEMPIY-6, the LIMITED basehousekeeper, working from hie excellent
‘visual vantage point, dispatched the LIEMBRACE surveillance teem via radio on

several LIEMERACE surveillance operations.

D. LILYRIC - During this reporting period, the LILYRIC basehouse provided
2,859 frames of operational photographs covering the same area and targets
noted in the LIMITED section above, out during the morning and afternocn
hours, In October the LILYRIC personnel (LIEMPTYs -15, -14, -26 and -27)
successfully completed the move into the new LIMOUSINE building. While some
photographic coverage waa lost during the move, LILYRIC coverage at present
ia back to norwal (see also paragraph 4 of Reference A.).

&, LICALLA ~ Throughout this period, the LICALLA basehouse provided both
physical observation and photographic coverage of the anien and patio of the
LIMERICK installation, an area vhere cany of the officers, their families and
visitors congregate. In providing this coverage LICALLA produced 1,183
individual photographs (of vhich 60 vere color prints used in the Station's
“mg book") ae well as regular daily reports on the salient activities in this

area.

») LIENTRAP - Throughout this period, the LIENTRAP mobile unit was
targetted against leaders and meeting-sitee of the local Communist parties
as well as other targets of opportunity, specifically the leaders of the
strike group at the Hational University. LIEMTRAP provided up-to-date
photographs of numerous Communist officials, which are of value to both

the JMPIGER program and the Statiou's recruitaent/penetration program.

This unit provided 330 operational photographs, while the personnel attached
to this unit also regularly serviced 21 postal accormodation addresses used
by Mexico City Station, Headquarters, and other field Stations.

c) LIMITED - During this period, the LIMITED basehouse provided 1,147
frames (45 rolls) of operational film and daily observation reports covering
the arrival and departure of LIMERICK personnel and visitors at the front
gate of that installation during the afternoon and rush-hours. In
addition, LIEMPTY-6, the LIMITED basehouse keeper, served ac the radio
dispatcher for several LIEMBRACZ surveillance operations.

frames (56 rolls) of operational photozraphs, coverin the came aree and
targets noted in the LIMITED section, but during the sorning and early
afternoon hours. In addition, the LILYRIC personnel prepared a detatled
report on the daily comings and goings of each LIMRICK staffer and

results.
5S. CHANOHS AND PLANNING

As noted in paragraph 5 of reference A, Station is in the process of
increasing the houra of both the photographic and physical surveillance
coverage provided by the LILYRIC operations during the veek-days. At
present, the LILYRIC personnel are providing coverage from early morning
to late afternyon, while LIMITED is providing week-end coverage. After
the LILYRICs have woved into the nev LINCUSINE building, it 1s anticipated
that they will be able to provide complete dawn to dusk coverage, the

Station's ultinate goal.

is in direct support of, and in consonance with, the current XC ss approved
for the Station, . The LIE@TY coverage has proved to be a mst reliable
tool fort following the daily moveaents of LIMERICK personnel; providing
leads to, and confirming the identities of LIMERICK staifers ani their
visitors; verifying the relative rank and specific intellisence service
connection of various LIMERICK officers keeping the Station abreast of
construction chanses cf the LISGAICK physical plant; and verizyin: reports
of Station access agents. During the period under review, the LISPTY
pasehouses preduced 4,212 photosraphs (149 rolls) as well as 6&0 pases of
fixed surveillance reports covering this target.

b) LTENTRAP -. Throughout this period, the LIENTRAP mebileautt vas
targetted against leaders and meeting-sites of the local ccomunist parties
aa well as other targets of opportunity, Specifically, LIENTRAP provided
up-to-date photosraphs of numerous commmist officials, which sre of value
to both the JMPIGER program and the Station's penetration/recruitzent
program. The LIENTRAP unit and personnel also remtlarly serviced 21 postal
‘accomodation addresses used by Nexico Cily Station, Keadquatters, sn} other
fleld Stations, The “IENTRAP unit provided a total of 10k opersticral

evening hours, In addition, 1: G, the LIMITED basehouse keeper, served
as the radio dispatcher on several LISNBRAGE surveillance operations. Tac
value and need of the LIMIYED fixed-ratio dispatching base has Seen explained
in detail in previous LIEPTY Frocress Reports,

a) LILYRIc - During this period, the LILYRIC basehouse protceed 1,542
frames (5% rolls) of operational photographs, covering the saze erea and
targeta noted in the LIMITED section, but during the morning ani early.

for the operators of the LIENCRAP mobile unit as well as LIS@TY-4 and

overall asatenment involved at least twelve clandestine asent meetings per

GERANDE also made miaerous ani essential contributions to the sensitive
AYRCD operation, It should be noted that GERENDE's alertness in spotting
the PORUMEN surveiltance of one of the AMHOD accommojation addresses,
undoubtedly saved this sensitive deception operation from exposure by the

opposition,

4, SECURITY AND PROBLEMS

Other than the attexpted PERUMEN surveillance of the AMROD accommodation
address noted above (which was neutralized by GERENDS's alertness), there
have been no known incidents which adversely affected the security of the
LIEMPTY project or the related agent pernonnel. ‘hile several minor ad-
ministrative problems arose, all such matters were resolved locally.

5. CHANOES ‘AND PLANNING

a) One major operational change is planned for the ensuing period.
Upon completion of the new LIMOUSINE structure (ses HMA-25352, dated 10
February 1965), the Station will move the present LIEYRIC basehouse
personnel (LIP TYs 13, 14, 26 and 27) into that edifice rather than the
LIMITED (LIn@TYs 6 and 7) personnel as originally planned, Ancillary
modifications arer 1) To increase the hours of both the photographic and
physical surveillance coverage provided by the LILYRIC operators (dawn to
dusk) during the week days and 2) have LIMITED provide photozraphic and
physical surveillance coverege on week-ends only, while reunining on datly
stand-by for radio-dispatching assignments, Tiess changes were dictated by
the following considerations:

1) The new LIMOUSINE building will offer a much better vantage point
for both photosraphic and physical surveillance than does the present
complex which houses the LILYRIC and LIMITED bases, Therefore, the
Station feels that the personnel occupying this new base should be

those possessing the highest technicel skills and also tlose able to
provide the most thorough ani complete coverage. Since the [IMITED base
now has only one trainei operator while the LILYRIC basehousa has three,

the LILYRIC group is indicated.

2) Because it appears that the coverage of the LI“FRICK installation
will be a long-range end continuing requirenent, the Station desires
to staff the new hase with personnel of lon3-renge potential. Since
LIEMTY-G is now almest 60 years old, it is obvious that he does not
possess this potential; however, the TILYRIC agent complex happily
combines experienced personnel with youthful agents,

3) Finally, the social and financial status of the LILYRIC personnel is
much more compatible afd consistent with the environment of the new
building than is that of the LIMITED family,

While it is anticipated that these modifications and changes will initially
cause varicus administrative and operational probleas, it is believed that
all such adjustaents can te handled locally,

MEMORANDUM FOR: Director of Logietica |

ATTENTION: Mr, Edward Deaisoa
SUBJECT: LIEMPTY, LIMOUSINE
REFERENCE: Mexi 2159

1, In conversation with the Headguartera officer concerned
with LIEMPTY LIMOUSINE affairs, thie Cifice wae apprised of the
fact that the proposed transaction, outliaed ia rele ernee cable, would
be executed without recourse to advice on the legal aspects of the
sale under Moxican law and with no intennoa to make LIMOUSINE's
commitment to this Agency legally bindiag. it le further intended
that LIMOUSINE's "promigaory notes" be vasecured,

2, Should the proposed transaction de earricd out in this
manner, this Agency would be unable to caforce LIMOUSINE's
promise to pay hia debt, and would have zo legally coguizable inotrus
ment ta present to an executor of his estate should he dic before
meeting hia obligations to us, In addition, eur right to continued
poseesaion of the apartment would be tenuces at be ot,

3. Thus it ia planned to convey real «etate appraised at
$l4, 448 in exchange for $7, 200 and a callectiva of unenforceable,
uneecured promises, [tis hard to believe that in this case, operas
tional security precludes cloner protection of Agency assets.

- LIEMPTY Project Renewal Comments
RNR AT

> None, for Headquarters information onl:
ae Saree eee Feeney

HMMW-85I5, 25 February 1960

1, “It would appear from paragraphs 2a and 2b of reference. that
KUDESK and KUTUBE Ops have not been completely informeéd-of the back-
ground of the LIEMPTY Project and its agent-requirements, At the time
HMMA-14093 (Request for Reaewal of Project LIEMPTY) was written, it
was assumed that the Mexico Desk and KUTUBE/D could answer any additional
questions, based on reports and dispatches not normally available to the
senior staffs, which might be raised during the renewal process,

, Oliver G, SCANTLING first contacted
Inez PARADA de Moreno in early.1957 to fulfill a KUTUBE/D requirement,

He visiced her as an archirect interested in viewing the LIMERICK installation
from the building where she lives, He was socially acquainted with her brother,
a Catholic Priest, and knew the family to be unquestionably anti-Communist,
However, it would be imprudent on the Station's and SCANTLING's part to
assume that PARADA does not at least suspect that some anti-LIMERICK
intelligence service Is. involved, PARADA suggested during SCANTLING's
initial visit that he couid return at any time for further observations, This
was reported by SCANTLING on 21 March 1957 and ic does not seem appropriate
to query him again on the pretext for his recent visits,

2, In answer to paragraph 2a,

3. While HMMA-14093 correctly referred to LUMITED, LULYRIC and
LICALLA as "photographic basehouses, " the Station would like to emphasize
that photographic coverage is oaly one of their functions (please see HMMA-12095,
4 February 1959), LIMITED is use as a radio dispatch base for atomobile
surveillance teams in addition to physical surveillance of persons entering
fae the front gate, Their photography is acgligible compared to their other duties,
The LILYRIC base performs the best photography of persons visiting the front
gate, perhaps because the vantage point for taking the pictures is from the
second floor and above the street traffic which partially blocks LIMITED
photographs, LILYRIC also does vidual reports on LIMERICK personnel
entering and leaving the main gate, . LICALLA is used almost exclusively to
identify LIMERICK officials and to support KUTUBE/D requirements in
connectioa with the LIMESA/LIMUST Project, As an indication of the effect-
iveness of LICALILA pholographic coverage, the Mexico Station has all the
LIMERICK officials identified, Before this base was activated more than two-
thirds of the LIMERICK officials were unidentified, In order to support other
operations, it is considered essential that the Station identify all LIMERICK
officials, In this respect, LICALLA has provided most of the necessary infor-
mation. The retention of this base is also considered vital to.the security of
the LIMUST portion of the LIMESA Project,

4, The Station does not agree that the color photography end moving
pictures are a luxury. Color slides were made for identification purposes
and have proved useful, particularly in identifying facial features and skin
coloring. The motion pictures were made at Headquarters sugestion (Please
see HMMW-7687, 29 May 1959 and HMMW-8438, 26 January 1960).

5, -In conclusion, the Station would like to point out that the "photo-
graphic basehouses™ represent an integral and significant part of the Station's
counteresptonage effort against the LIMERICK installation, These bases do
not produce Foreign Intelligence and should not be considered tn such a light.

1, On 13 October 1959 it was learned{rom source that the local ODENVY
chief got a priority cable from his Headquarters asking why data concerning the
Mexican apprehension of the (KUBARK) truck and photographer had not been re~
ported to the U. S. Ambassador locally, The statement was made that "such
matters as this should be immediately reported to the Ambassador,"

2. This cable resulted from the report the ODENVY office sent in on
the incident from the knowledge they had - as reported in reference.

3, The local ODENVY chief replied to his Headquarters that he did not
agree that matters concerning KUDARK operations should be reported by ODENVY!

to the Ambassador,

4. Source stated that the cable was obviously a result of the KUBARK/
ODENVY headquarters "il feeling" which presently exists and which source
believes is primarily (and principally) attributable to the article in TRUE magazin
of Septensber 1959,

1, At lilo hes,, 20°September 1959, while on an operational asvignment,
LIEMPTY-10 and the LIENTRAP vehicle were temporarily detained by the Servicio
Secreto de Mexico (Mexican Secret Service). LIEMPTY-!0 was held under
y for approximately 26 hours before his release was obtained, Ther}

unofficial custed
@ this incident,

“follows below an accountof the more important detaile pertaining t

2, LIEMPTY-10 was instructed on 17 September to case the area surrounding
the Theatre Iris, located at Donceles 36, preliminary to undertaking a photographic
surveillance of all persons entering and leaving’the theatre betwoen the houre cf
0930 and 1200 hra., 20 September, In this instance, the Station's target was a pro~
Cuban rally sponsored by the Circulo de Estudios Mexicanos (CEM). ‘The Station
had received information that many of the leading Mexican and Central American
Communists would attend this rally and that this wag an oppertune time to establish
which ones did attend and to collect their photographs, ‘he Station did not know that
the Mexican Scerct Service would also be covering thia meeting for the purpose of
preventing a Communiet-inspired demonstration,

3, The Station was advised at 1730 hrs,, 20 September, by Raymond Hy
GERENDE (ps), the Principal Ayent who handles LIEMPTY~- 10, that L-10 was being
held by the Seeret Service, Immediately followin, this notification, Allen W. WAKE
(ps) wae requested to contact Philip K, TESSAROLO (pa) and request him to implement c
procedures through a criminal lawyer to effect the release of L-10. TESSAROLO
was contacted and briefed at 2200 hours and immediately began atternpts to locate
a reliable criminal lawyer, Liowever, as somctimes happens in an emergency
situation, his two most appropriate contacts were out of tewn, It wag not until the
following morning at 0700 Ars, that TESSAROLO located another reliable lawyer
who agreed to handle the case,

4, Since GERENDE was known to L-10 and since the Station could not be
sure-how much L-10 might be forced to tell the Secret Service. GERENDE was

given the following instruction

A. To disconnect immediately the LIFEAT/LIVERY lincs in the base
where he and his wife ‘were living, and to move all equipment to another safe
location, It was belicved appropriate to take this precaution even though L-10
dad not know the location of the LIVERY base, the telephone number of the
base, or even that GERENDS was living at a place other than his mother's
residence in another part of the city.

BR. To collect and deposit with his Case Officer any compromising papers
presently in hie possession.

Cc, To make a eecurs nspection of the outside photographic jab at his

mother's house.

D. Yo phonz L-10's wife and inform her that procedures were underway
to ubtain L-10's release and ior her not to become upset and talkative,

suring the evening of 20 September the Station LIFEAT Case Officer

So
was advised that GERENDE had been uirected te disconnect the LIVERY lines
and to transier all LIFEAT equipment to a safe location, Te further insure the
security of LIVERY, all LIVERY lincs were pulled externally during the early
morning of 21 September, .

8. At approximately 1000 hre,, 21 September, LIMEW informed the Chief
of Station that a contact of his (LIMEW's) had just informed him that L-10 (true
name) and tie LIENTRAP_ vehicle were being held by the Sceret Service, LIMEW
stated that sf L-10 was one of KUBARK's agents he would attempt to have hig
contact in the Secret Service obtain his immediate release, LIMEW was told
that L-10 was, in fact, a KUBARK ayent and that the Station would very much
Appreciate his efforts to effect his release, A short while liter LIMEW again
contacted the Chief of Station and informed him that it would be necessary for
documented ODACID official personally to contact a Commandante fnu LIMON”
of the Seeret Service and that L-10 would then be released, According to LIMEW,
L-10 hag told the Secret Service-that he was carrying oyt his operational photo-
graphic assignment on a contract basis for ODACID; therefore, an ODACID
official would have to establish L-10's bona fides,

7, As the Station learned later, the Sceret Service agents were roughing up
some of the individuals attending the rally; consequently, they were endeavoring
sure that no phot n which could be used apainat them by
wists, L-10 and L-11, the LIENTRAP driver who left the acene before }
4, were just preparing to leave the area after taxing five colle of film
when a Secret Service agent demanded a search of the vehicle on tho: suspicion that
red Communist propaganda, L-10, his camera with telephoto lens and
the Gim were then discovered in the rear of LIENTRAP, It wag at this time that
L-10 was accused orally by the police officers of being a Soviet agent and later of
being a local Communist agent, After being taken to Secret Service Headquarters,
L-10 tolj LIMON, in private, about his association with ODACID and emphasized
that he certainly was not a Communist agent, LIMEW's source (possibly Com-
mandante LIMON), believing that there may be some truth in L-10's statement,
contacted LIMEW, Based in part on assumption and in part on fact, this is the
Station's opidion as to how ODENVY became involved in the case,

=

8, ‘The Station, realising that LIEMPTY-10 had not committed an illegal
act by tking photographs, decided that WARE should personilly visit LIMON
and request L-10's release, WARE contacted LIMON and the sub-jefe of the
Secret Service, Raul MENDIOLEA Cerecero, about 1230 hrs., 2] September,
ident:ficd himself ag an ODACLD official and told them that L-10 did from time
to time perform photographic assignments for ODACID, particularly in the
field of local Communist activities, WARE also told LIMON and MENDICLEA.
that L-10 was never permitted to du any task which was illegal under Mexican
Jaw and that if he had done so it was certainly not under the auspices of ODACID,
but on his own volition, They implied that L-10 had not done anything iNegal and
that all they wanted to be sure about was that L-10 was not a Communist agent,
10 was immediately released and the LIENTRAP vehicle returned to him with
equipme the five rolls of undeveloged film,

9. ‘While WARE was on his way to sec LIMON at the Secret Service Head-
quarters, the Chief of Station was advised by the ODACID Security Office that
L-10 was’ deing detained oy the Secret Serv i curity Office was told that
WARE was presently investi: iy the matter and should be at the Secret Service
Headquarters at that time. By Coineiaeaee! WARE was talking to MENDIOLEA
when ODACID Security 0: e phoned to inform him that WARE was taking care
of the matter, [t was learned later that MENDIOLEA is a brother-in-law of the
local inve st.gator employed full time b, the ODACID Security Office, This was how
ODAC1D became involved in the incident, To the best of the Station's knowledge, th
ODAGID Security Officer has said nothing more about the incident and, at the time,

LIMEW to give to his source, LIMEW said that in addition to notifying him about
L-10's detention, the source was also responsible for all equipment and film being

returned intact to L-10,

11, TESSAROLO was advised, as soon as LIMZW became involved in the casq,
that the criminal lawyer should not pursue the matter any further, Two bottles of
scotch whiskey were given to the lawyer through TESSAROLO for the few tasks he

had already performed,

12, After his release, L-10 reported that he wae not interroyated and that he
did not reveal any data about other operations he has worked on nor did he give ‘the
names of anybody connected with operational activities. Based on the developments
in the case, the Station hae no reason to doubt the veracity ef L-10's statement,; L-
10 was reprimanded for his use of statements to the Secret Service about bein
employed by ODACID, iie was told that the revelation of such employment was to
be made only by the Station and that henceforth he is never to use such a cover
story, L-10 was also reprimanded for hiu lack of judgment in remaining in an area
where there was a strony concentration of police; it is believed safe to asuume that
L-10 will acver make this same mistake ayain,

13, In retrovpect, it is interesting to note that L-10's use of the ODACID
employment story 18 possibly responsible for his not being interrogated and thus
compromising other operations and individuals, This case has pointed out to the
Station the desireability of having casual contacts in the Secret Service and other

14. The Station is allowing a one month's cooling off period for the LLSN-
YRAP vehicle and LIEMPTY-10, ‘The vehicle wil then be painted another atandz rd

are observed, the Station aces no reason why carcfully selected photographic sur-

ACCOUNT OF DEVELOPMENTS -- OLIVER G, SCANTLING SEGMENT

2, Agent Information + Oliver G, SCANTLING has continued to perform his
+ assigned tasks in an outstanding manner, SCANTLING's poise, common sense,
education, ideology and native abil i ity for the pursuit of clandestine activities
make him one of the most valuable support,assets available to the Mexico City -
Station, The fact that SCANTLING has full time overt occupation as Chief
Enginee r and Production Manager for a local manufacturing company adds to
his long-range potential as a KUBARK agent, On two occasions dur ing the past
six months SCANTLING has indicated to his Case Officer that he would like to
resign from his overt position and devote full time to his KUBARK ope rational
duties; however, the Case Officer has discouraged him from doing this oa the
basis that he has more long-range potential when his cover occupation is legitimate,
Of course, SCANTLING would be more valuable if he could work full time fo r the
Station, but not sufficiently soto warrant his resignation from his overt job (his
monthly salary in his overt job is in excess of $800,00 U, S,), The only
significant limitation that SCANTLING has evidenc ed to his present Ca se Officer
Ts his occasional dc vlay in prepar ing written reports of investigations and other
“|matters requiring reports for the files, However, this iimitation gradually is
being babe eed and it is expected that SCANTLING's reports will continue to

be factual, comprehen sive and soon will be promptly submitted, 65 fray

~ SCANTLING is constantly under a conside: able
amount of xposure and pressure when fo Mowing up LIMESA leads obtained from
LIFEAT and the photogra phic bases, Since time is always of the essence when
using such perishable leads, SCANTLING frequently is directed to make approaches
to individuals performing services for the LIME RICK target after routine, and
sometimes only cursory, investigation, Therefore, the possibility always exists
of his entanglen nt in an undesirable eid ui incident, This neces sari

It is to, SCANTLING's credit that he has not yet become involved in an incident which
he Station feels has comproniised him and/or alerted the target of KUBA RK's many

accurate drawing of the type door installed at LIMERICK, This drawing was
forwardd to Headquarters via HMMA -11926, 21 January 1959,

E, Casing Report on West German Embassy - During June, July and
August 1958, SCANTLING prepared a detailed casing repo rt on the new
West Ger man-Embas sy, SCANTLING's engineering ability enables him to
pre pare accurate drawings and sketches from a minimum of data, Also,
his personality and gregarious manner permit him to visit the inside of such
establishments, with an appropriate cover story, and retain minute details
which later he commits to paper and emerges with a comprehen sive floor
plan and important construction data,

“LIMERICK Construction - SCANTLING's long asso ciation with this
target “trom the casing siandpoint provides the Stat ion with an unparalleled
sou rce of information about LIMERICK construc tion activ ities, modifications
and reasons for same, All of the LIMERICK cas ing reports on file in Head-
qua rters are the product of SCANTLING's unusua | a bility and knowledge,
Consultat ions with Station Officers about LIME RICK construction have been
of benefit to the Stat iondiring this reporting period an. they wili continue to
be of wor thwhile importance,

G. Routine Investigations and Surve illances - Although the Station has
several assets capable of performing investigations and surv cil lances,
SCANTLING is still used in situations requiring the utmost in discretion and
clandestinity, His activities in this connection are too numerous to list
here; suffice it to state that he has contributed materially to the Station's
collection of operational in formation through his investigative effo rts,
SCANTLING's interview of Paul Frederick Kir schho ff (201-4 3545) of LCMAY-
FOWL interest is an example of SCANTLING's use on-investigations (see
HM MA-11749, 17 December 1958),

H, ESGEM-15 - SCANTLING served as the cutout with ESGEM~1 5 during
the latter's December 1958 trip to Mexico City, In this connection
SCANTLING is 4 suppori asset which is trustwo rthy and depen aable,
SCANTLING never displays undue curiosity in operations such as the ESGEM-15
one; he accepts the minimum amount of informaticn given and performs his
duties in a professional and sincere manner,

I, LIEMPTY/3 - SCANTLING handles the administ rative mart ers conn ected
with L/3, Doris M, XILLGO provides oper ational direction to L/3, During
this reporting period, the Stat ion had hopes of SCANTLING taking over the
ope rational super visioa of L/3's.activities, However, after a four-month
trial period with both SCANTLING and KILLCO meeting with L/3, it was
dec ided that ir would be desirable for KIMGO to continue handling L/3. L/3's
unusual personality and intellect indicated that he could best be directed by
a PBPRIME citizen, Therefore, SCANTLING no longer attends KI_LGO's
and L/3's operational meetings, although he does continue to handle L/3's
administrative problems,

“Mexico C ity: in Dece mber 1958 and January 1959, it was considered app ropriate
for SCANTLING to handle LIMITED, LICALLA and LIENTRAP, Although this
Procedure defeats some compartmentation principles, it was the only manner

in which the Station could maintain efficiency with the three operations listed
above, SCANTLING has known the agents involved with LIMITED, LICALLA
and LIENTRAP for several years, In fact, he was at one time the agent in

cha rge of these three oper ations,

5. Operational Methods Evolved During the Period - The VIDALES operation
(see parag rapn 4 (C) above) indicated to the Station the necess ity for thorough
briefings and discussions with the agent making an approach toa target, This can
hardly be described as a new operational method, but it does serve to illustrate
the minimum efforts that should be followed, The forthcoming LINIMENT IV
operation whe rein SCANTLING must recruit the Jandlord of the ta rget's build ing

is offering SCANTLING and the Station the opportunity to prepare thorou ghly for
ISCANTLING's recruit ment pitch, The excelent documentation prepared by
KURIOT and the story being created by SCANTLING and the Station should increase
the batt ing average on SCANTLING's cold approaches, (See HMMA ~11366, 22
October 1958, and HMMW-7038, 21 November 1958, for additional details on

this Subject),

In a general sense, one other conclusion can be made about any Station's
support apparatus - where technical and photographic operations are poss ibie,
the utility of the information obtained is enhanc ed consider ably by accurate,
comprehensive and timely casing reporis, SCANTLING, as previously mentioned,
is an excellent asset for this type of support,

6, Administration - SCANTLING's contract expires on 15 February 1959,
As of that daté SCANTLING will have received an annual salary of $3, 600, 00 U. S.
for two years, The Station plans to raise his annual compensation to $4,000.09
U.S, No other significant administrative problems exist,

7, Outlo for Future Development - Station plans call for the continued
ut ization of SCANTLING in the Same manner as he is presently being used,
The Station will keep SCANTLING as an independent asset and, it is hoped, resist
the temptation to make him a principal agent in charge of numerous sub-agents, It
is believed that SCANTLING is the type of support asset that can be wo rtiwh ile
to the Station for many years to come and that every efforz: should be made to protect

his security and value to KUBA RK,
ACCOUNT OF DEVELOPMENTS - RAYMOND H, GERENDE SEGMENT.

8, Agent Intormation - Aside from the agent information given in HMMA- 11368
22 October 1958, the only significant development was GERENDE's Dec ember 1958
marriage to a U, S, educated girl of Dutch citizenship, The$ 500,00 U. S, for the
purchase of two plane tickets as a wedd ing gift to GERENDE was designed to
impr ess GERENDE with the fact that KUBARK thinks highly of him as an individual
and chat KUBARK has a great interest in his intelligence career, GERENDE is at
the age and stage in life whe re he is beginning to wonder just what the future holds
for him, In the near future, the Station will propose a salary raise for GERENDE

9., Security Developments = Again, the information on this subject was covered
adequately in F MMACTINB CERENDE was relieved of his LIFEAT/BGMORNING
jand LIF EAT/ Cuban Exiles duties on 10 December 1958, This, of course, was
in line with recommendations contained in HMMA~11368 and represents a definite
security improvement, GERENDE was told that LIFEAT/BGMORNING was being
terminated because it had not been productive of cnough significant information and
that LIFEAT/Cuban Exiles was being terminated because the occupants of the target
apartment had moved (Note: This was true where the Cubans are concerned,)
dditional sccur ity improvements will be made when Simon D, CLACKETT returns
to Mexico and relieves GERENDE of respons ibility for the LUERSEY surveillance

team,

10, Operational Success and Effectiveness ~ Briefly reviewed below are the
Iseparatée oper atonal activities which CERENDE managed during the period covered
* by this report:

A, LIMITED - This base functioned smoothly, securely and efficiently
dur ing the period July through December 1958, ‘Ihe base operator, LIEMPT Y/
demonstrated his usual competence and devotion to duty, in addition to the
primary objective of taking photograph s of individuals of interest, L/6 also
prepared detailed daily logs on the arrivals and departures of all target
personnel, weckly reports of workers activities at the LIME RICK instal lat ion,
per formed three one ~man surve illanc es of Mexicans working at LIMERICK in
an effort to identify them by name and home address, and provided SCANTLING
with information on LIMERICK construction, Dur ing this six-month period,
LIEMPTY/6 took approx imately 800 photographs from the LIMITED base,

B, LILYRIC - This base is operated by LIEMPTYs/13 and 14, with LIEMPLY/
12 serving as a cutout between the base and GERENDE, LIE MPTY/14 docs most
of the photogra phy and reporting for the base since LIEMPTY/13 has a regular
job and is not on the premises during regular daytime working hours, L/14
dev otes approximately six hours (0800-1 400) each day to photography and the
remaining time is spent preparing reports, The Base personnel compile
individual Jo gs on cach target personality indicating their arrivals and depa rtures
from the LIME RICK installation (Note: These reports are filed in the
app ropriate Station 201 file and are available to Station officers in analyzing a
target personality 's pattern of daily activity), LILYRIC also prepared a
weekly report on workers activities at the Club and reports the license plate
numbe rs of all vehicles dischar ging or picking up individuals at LIMERICK,
(Note: These license plate numbers are then checked out ratough LIV PS TOCK/2
for the owne rs names and addresses - in case of im mediate or later operational
interest,) During GERENDE's recent absence from Mexico City, OUSLER met
directly with LIEMPYY/ 12, Dur ing this period appr oximatel y2,000 photographs
were taken from the LILYRIC base,

C. LICALLA - While LILYRI C and LIMITED are excellent bases for
pio tographing individuals entering and leaving the LIME RICK instal Jat ton,
the LICALLA base is the Station's best source of photographs of LIMERICK

employees, LICALLA is so situated that photographs can be made of target
personne! in the yarden area of LIME RICK, LIEMPTY/9 is the base operator
for LICALLA and in the Station's opinion performs his job in an outstanding
manner, As reported in HMMA -11368, LIEMPLY/9 is the brother of former
LIPST ICK/47 (the first LIPSTICK surveillance team member arrested in
strniaaisi June 1958), No repercussions, or indications of impending ones, have
resulted in this family relationship, This, certainly, is the major security
problem faced by L/9 during this reporting period, L/9 and his family soon
will have to vacate the LICALLA base for the period of time required to remodel
it, The Station is quite sure that L/9 does not know that his covert employer
owns the LICALLA ‘base and the thzee adjoining houses and every effort is
being made to preserve this secret from L/9, (See HMMA~12032, 28 January
1959, for a more detailed explanation) Of course, during the remodeling of
LICALLA there will not be any LICALLA reporting or photographs, In addition
to taking appro ximatcly 2, 500 photographs during tris six-month period, the
LICALLA hase also prepared weekly reports on LIMERICK garden activ ities,
These reports indicate which LIMERICK employees are seen together each day,
which vehicles different employees are accustomed to using, construction activit
and other matters which appear of significance w L/9,

D,. LIENTRAP - LIENTRAP continues to be a worthwhtic Station a
Approximately 1, 400 clandestine photographs have been made of numerous
targets during this reporting period and LIENTRAP type activities will undoubtedly
remain one of the Station's best investigativ¢ asses, As explained in the Field
Pro ject Outline, forwarded to Headquarters on 8 October 1958, the Station is
» of the opinion that the LIENTRAP vehicle should be replaced as soon as possible,

Nearly four months have elapsed without receiving Headquarters authority to
repdace the vehicle, The security situation is even more acute now than at the
time of the request, LIEMPTYs 10 and 11 do an excellent job on LIENTRAP

ope rations,

E, LIJERSEY - This operation can be characterized as somewhat dormant
for the July - December 1958 period, Because of GERENDE's other important
activities, he did not have the time to train and work w ith the surveillance team,
Also, the Station considered chat it would be stretching secur ity just a bit too f&
to have GERENDE engaged in surveillance at the same time that he was handling
the photogra phic base hous es ard performing monitoring chores for LIFEAT/
BGMORNING and LIF EAT/ Cuban Exiles, The expected arrival of Simon D,
CLACKEIT in April and his relieving GERENDE of LIJERSEY will enable
the Station to train, within a year, an efficient mobile surveillance team,
At present, LIEMPT Ys/15, 16 and 17 composé the LYERSEY team,

F, LIF EAT - Until 10 December 1958 GERENDE served as monitor
in the basc house containing LIF EAT/ BG MORNING and LLFEAT/Cuban
Extles, In addition to living in the base house, GERENDE also transcr ibed
the majority of the SGMORNING and Cuban Exile tapes, He performed
these jobs satisfactofily evea though his efficiency was handicapped by numerous
‘other duties, Relieving GERENDE of his LIFEAT duties enables him to devote
more time to his other operations with a corresponding increase in the security

of all his activities,

MEMOHANDUM FOR: Coll
SUBSECT + Development of Physical Surveillance Assets in Mexico

-
REFERENCE © s_ WH/FI. Memorendum of 14 October 1958

1, The subject of the recruitment of a physical surveillance team in
the United Statce for use in Nexico as well ss other areas within WH has
long been a topic of discussion at Headquarters, While it is palpably ri-
diculous to consider the use of a surveillance team recruited and trained
4n the United States and based in Mexico, operationally in other areas in
latin America, there ig some merit, at least in theory, to the proposal in
2a of reference. Although one of the basic fectors in the make-up of any
surveillance team is that its merbers mist be indigenous to the area of op-
eration, it would be possible to recruit such a team as sugested in 2a and
use thie team in Mexico. Howevor, I believe this would be time-consuming and
very expensive for the following reasons:

a. Machine runs have already been made to spot candidates within
the Agency of the Mexican/American type for the LIMESA/LIMUST project, with

negative results,

b. In order to make it attractive to young men of the caliber
desired, we would have to offer some kind of a career with a starting salary
of somavhere between the GS 7 and GS 9 level, plus travel and allowances,
without attempting to even estimate this cost one can see that the figures for
a team of fifteen would run into six digits,

ce. It would take a minimum of three months for a recruiter to move
Anto the southwest area and spot, contact, develop and recruit a team of
fifteen, (lew

d. Oncn a team of suitable candidates was recruited, it would
then teke a minimum of another three months to train these candidates in
basic trade craft and surveillance techniques,

e. Upon cospletion of the training period, the candidates would
have to ce moved individually into the area of operstion to becons familiar
with this area, the language, people, and atmosphere in general, etc.
would take another three months minimum,

f. After corpletion of the area familiarization period, the tean
would have to be assenbled and put through various surveillance exercises as
@ unit to check them out prior to actual operation.

SECEFT

-2- ee

g- Taere would be other problems confrenting such a team from a
security standpoint, such as cover credentials, vhich would always pose &
threat to the operation. ?

2, To-sum up, it would appear that the proposal in 2a of reference:
1a not feasible because of the tine and expense involved plus the always
latent security haeard. ——

3. lL agree with paragraph 2 b of reference. Not only should the
personnel of the surveillance team te recruited at the station, but as out-
Lined in paragraph 3 it should be relatively easy to find suitable candidates.
For example it is proposed under the new LIEMPTY project (this consists of
the remainder of the non-blown LIPSTICSs and the LIJERSEYs) to recruit a
physical surveillance team. Two of the station's outstanding indigenous
agents, Scantling and Gerende, are uncer this project and both are capable
of spotting, developing, and recruiting agents.

4, I agree with paragraph 3b, ¢, and d, and believe that Headquarters
should sake every effort to find an esrerienced end competent case officer
to £112 Glover's slot as the outside survelllance case officer,

MEMORANDUM FOR: WH
SUBJECT: Development of Physical Surveillance Assets in Mexico

- On 6 October 1958 a reating of representatives of SR Division
and-CI Staff was held, attended by the undersigned, to discuss means for
building up physical surveillance assets in Moxico, The SR and CI repre-
sentatives pointed out that their current and projected work on BOMORNING
and their cases requires a considerable strengthening of physical surveil-
Jance assets, and it was the consensus that these assots would be used
far into the future on Soviet tarcets, It was further agreed that since
the LIPSTICK operation has oncbuntared difficulties this year, new assets

should be sought.

2. Various approaches to the problen wera discussed, the most viable
of which were as follows:

a, Recruiting of teams or basic elaments for teams in the Mexican
colonies of the southwestern U. S,

b, Dispatch of a new case officer to Mexico with the sole and
specific duty of developing and running tho new teans,

ce. A combination of a and by

3, Initially, it is believed the dispatch of a new case officer to
Hexico would be tho most successful and give the best immediate results,
for the following reasons:

a, Headquarters and Station records contain the names of qunerous
cleared contacts of contacts who could be cleared and through whe
introductions could be made tv persona suitable for surveillance work.
Hitherto these have not been fully exploited owing to the heavy workload
on Station personnel and the unimpaired functioning till recently of
the LIPSTICK group, Some of these contacts were felt out as recruiters
ard spottors in yeara past but the matter was never pushed since the
need was not so great as now,

b, A now case officar is needed bacause the present Station staff
is still too busy to devote the amount of time nesded to build carefully

and train thoroughly the new assets,

¢. The now assots will roquire the full time direction and
coordination of a case officer who has no other responsibilities, In
this connection, it would be advisable to try to select, train and
utilize at least twelve new agents as soon as possible,



o2-

d, In brief, a replacement of the former physical surveillance
leader is indicated, but a more mature and competent case officer is

“needed. ee :

4, Plan a, recruitment in the U, S., should not be disniesed from
consideration, It would take loncer.than the other plan but might be
beneficial in enabling the new agents to be trained in the U, S, ‘They
would then have to spend time getting into Mexico and familisrize themselves
‘with operations and operational clinate there, This plan, however, presenta
a problem as to-wtio 4e to do the recruiting and training in the U. S.

SR Divieion has offered to be of whatever assistance they can, but there
43 no indication they could do any better at this than WD.

5S. It may be of interest to you to know that the SR representatives
said the best work done anywhere in the world on the BOMORNING case, which
has wide international ramifications, was done. by LIKAYAK=2 in Mexico,

1. On 16 December 1955 the daily check of property which this Station
may desire to use for operational purposes(LICOOL run} showad that a
house adjacent to the LIMMICK target installation was vacant. LIPSTICK=19
was contacted immediately to investigate the property. He repurted that
it was a one-story house(duplex) in very poor condition wiich was being
repaired by the owner for rental, He furtaer reported that from the
maid's room on the roof a clear view of tha entire LINEXICK compound was!
possible and, if he had understood the LIMMRICK language, he would hava
been able to understand several conversations which were going on between
LIMEXICK officers in the game area of the compound, LIPSTICK-19 also re«
ported that from the roof of this house it was a distance of only approxi-
mately fifty feot to the LIMERICK building across fiat roofs with no
obstructing partitions except for a small wall and saveral strands of
barbed wire, all totalling about four or five feet high between the last

roof and the LIMERICK building.

2. Based upon this favorable report, reference A vas sent imnediately
to Headquarters requesting authorization to rent the house. Two days
later reference B was received granting approval to rent the house. Con~
sequently, LIPSTICK=2.(the only cleared married man available tc the
Station, with the exception of LIBEITY, wo would fit into the area) was
approached and requested to rent the house, This posed a considerable
problem to LIPSTICK-21, since the house has only tvo cedrooms and he already
had two children, and at that very time his wife was in the hospital
ving birth to a third child, Aurther, he had a very comfortable house

‘a duplex waich he shared with ais brother-in-law at a pre-devaluation
rent) which he would never be able to again acquire after tais operation
was terminated, He did, however, agree to take the house and it was

apparent to all concerned that ‘iis decision was based upon loyalty to
tils Station and.dedication to the fight asainst Coimunism. It is hoped
that this unselfioh snd devoted act of LIPSTICK-21's will be made a

matter of permanent record.

3. The reason for LIPSITCK-2 to move from very comfortable quarters

at less rent into cramped quarters at a higher rental. needed some explana~
tion for nis friends aud relatives. There is a very fino private school
approximately one block from this house which LIPSTICK-21 had often men-
tioned as the best in tie city for his children, and consequently he told
everyone that the reason for moving was to be as close as possible to this
school so that his cniliren could attend. It shou)d be noted in this
reopect that, in reality, LIPSTICK-21 had bean sending nis chiliren to

one of the best public schools in Mexico City at no cost, Unier the present
circumstances, he will have to pay tuition at the private school because
it 4s the only decent school in the area and it provides excellent cover
for his residence in the area. It is requested that Headquarters authorise
this Station te ansist WIPSTICK-21 in the paymont of his chiliren's tuition
for the above stated reasons. Approximate cost of the tuition wuld be
$20.00 U.S. per child por month, or a total for LIPSTiCK-21 of $10,00 US
per month, Authorization is requested to assist LIPstICK-21 by payment

of 330,00 U.3. per month.

4. The house i ore of & series of one-story houses that extend from
the LIMEXICK building to a four-story apartment building on the far
corner. The fronts of the houses are all directly on the sidewalk with
the doors opening onto a ono-step stoop. ‘Ire backe of the houses and the
walls of the back patios all abut the compound of the LIMERICK installa-
tion, The rear wimlows of the house face a patio which ends in a trick
wall, ‘this brick wall is not as hijn as the roof of the house, ending
about: four feet below the level of the roof, ‘There are stairs which
ascend from this patio to the roof where the maid's quarters are situated,
About halfway up these stairs one can turn and obtain an unrestricted
view of the LIMERICK compound, ilowever, the maid's room offers te best
operational possibilities since it provides concealment for the observer
and nis equipment, plus a more advantageous view. LIPSTICK-21 told his
maid that she would have to sleep out at a local pension since he needed
her room for nis radio exveriments, Tais is a plausible story since
LIPSTICK-21 is known to ve an enthusiastic radio amateur.

5. The maid's room nas a door that faces across the roofs in the direction
of the LIM:RICK installation and one wintow waich faces across the house
roof toward the street, A view of the LIMERICK compound is obtaized by

an observer who is back in the room looking through the partly opened door,
Some better metnod of observation will be worked out waich will eliminate
the security hazard of a door partially opened at all times of operation,

At present we p.lan to allow LIPSTICK-21 considerable time to get

settled seczrely into his new quarters before starting any operational

efforts, After this waiting period is over ana we feel that we can
Securely comence ope:"ations, we plan on using the base for the following

efforts:

a, A supplementary photographic base. In tais connection tht
request for adiitional Exactas and spotting scopes previously made
should be éxpedited. It is anticipated that much operation informa-
tion will be develozed by this photograzhic work showing thé various
associations betwee the people when they are at play in the compound
waich can never be determined from the LISSTICK-LINITED coverage.
Visitors who seldea Leave the compound do engage in social activity

‘in tha compound and can be phctograghed for possible identificas
tion by the AEDIPPSAS. Items wiich are losded into the automobiles
for transportation to unknown points may be identified through this
coverage. further, snould LIPSTICK/LINITED be terminated for any
reason, we would be able to continue some coverage froa this base.

be Observation by LIPSTICK-21 of the builsings and the activities
in the compound will furnish valuable information on the daily living
habits of the residents and their guests,

ce ‘he LIPSTICK/LIDOMINO base, presently being occupied by LINCH-
FIN, ig about 75 yards away from the LIMERICK target while LIPSTICK/’
LICALLA is only about fifty feet. This base may assist the Head-
quarters technicians, who periodically use the LIPSTICK/LIDMINO
base, for reasons of proximity and the use of their equipment from
a difverant direction. ‘he exact use of the LIFSTICX/LICALIA base
in this respect mist be determined by the Headquarters technicians
who are faniliar with tne equipment used,

d. Conversations in the LIMMRICK compound are audible to soneone
whe is listening from the maid's room. ally street noises and
extranaous sounds interfere considerably wita this eavesdropping so
that the enploynent of sone paratolic microphone aii recorder mst

“be used for optimam results.

e ld future operations provide the opportunity to install a
transnitter micropione(resonant cavity) in some iten carried into
the LIGRICK target, LiFSTICK/LICALLA would serve as an excellent
base since it has direct line of signt to the back of the LINFRICK
target.
