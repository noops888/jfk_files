SENS IND: RYBAT'S

* IN MINSK,

WERE FLOWN TO MOSCOW IN 63 FOLLOWING THE ASSASSINATION, >

THEN RETURNED TO MINSK WHERE THEY ARE STORED TODAY.

APPROACHED BY STATE AND THE ARRB, THE BELARUSIANS HAVE SHOWN

SAMPLES FROM THE FILE BUT HAVE NOT AGREED TO ARRANGEMENTS TO COPY.

THE ARRB CHARTER EXPIRES ON 30 SEPT 98 AND THE OLD KGB FILE(S) IS

A MAJOR OUTSTANDING REQUIREMENT.

STATE HAS MANAGED TO GET THE

SUBJECT AS THE NUMBER ONE TALKING POINT ON VICE PRES GORE'S RECENT

CONFERENCE DISCUSSIONS.

THE BELARUSIAN RESPONSE WAS TO TRY IT

AGAIN LOCALLY IN MINSK, OFFERING INCREASED "COPY FEES"

THE ARRB CHAIRMAN HAS COME BACK TO STATE TO ASK THEY

CONTACT-THE AGENCY WITH THE FOLLOWING REQUEST: SCAN THE STATION

CHECK WITH THE-ESB/SVR, TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE RUSSIANS RETAINED

*A COPY OF THE<LEE HARVEY OSWALD'S>KGB FILE IN MOSCOW?

CAN WE GET

ACCESS TO THE FILE AND, PRESUMABLY, OBTAIN A COPY FOR THE ARRB:

WE NOTE THAT THE ARRB WILL PROBABLY PUSH HARD-TO_ DECLASSIFY THE

RUSSIAN DOCUMENTS AS WELL. OBVIOUSLY SUCH-A REQUEST-COULD HAVE

SEVERAL IMPLICATIONS WHICH WE MUST CAREFULLY CONSIDER, I.E.; THE

RUSSIANS MIGHT ASK FOR FILES OF THE ROSENBERGS OR OTHER NOTORIOUS,

PERSONALITIES.

THE HQS CONTEXT IS THAT WE ARE GRAPPLING WITH THE

ARRB ON A VARIETY OF OTHER SERIOUS DECLASSIFICATION/ DISCLOSURE

ESSUES AND WE MIGHT BE ABLE IN A BETTER NEGOTIATING POSITION IF

COULD BE SEEN AS ASSISTING THEIR EFFORTS TO GET THE OSWALD FILE.

OBVIOUSLY SUCH AN ACTION HAS TREMENDOUS IMPLICATIONS ANI

WE WELCOME A FULL_DIALOGUE_EROM STATTON-ON THIS MATTER.
