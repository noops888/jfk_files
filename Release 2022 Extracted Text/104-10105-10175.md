SUBJECT : Gordon NOVEL

1, On 23 May Mr. Papich left with us a copy of attached
FBI teletype. FBI will confirm this information by formal
memorandum.

2. Mr. Papich requested information on two points with
permission to make our reply available to the Attorney General:

a) nature and extent of CIA interest in the
Double-chek Corporation.

b) our comments and observations on the draft
letter purportedly prepared by Gordon NOVEL.

3 3, After consultation with Mr. Jacob Esterline, DC/WH,
ir. James Powell SOD, and Mr. Lawrence Houston, OGC, the following
Teply was givenMr. Papich:
"“Double-chek is a “shell" corporation used
in the past by CIA to recruit pilots, It was
Also used as a front for the payment of the
"Birmingham widows". No individual bearing
the name of Gordon NOVEL had any connection with
Double-chek nor with CIA.

Mr. Lawrence Houston is in constant touch
with the Deputy Assistant Attorney General,
Nathaniel Cossack, on this matter, and will 4
tell him about present developments.

Mr. Houston comments that anyone could
have prepared the letter but it really does
sound like NOVEL's cock-eyed approach rather
than Garrison. There is a fair chance that
