27 October 1969

MEMORANDUM FOR : Deputy Chief, WH/7
REFERESCE 2? Your request this subject

Following our receipt of information that Clemard-
Joseph Charles had taken a list of requirerents into
the U.S. Embassy in Port-au-Prince and asked help in
filling them, WH Divisioz sent a semorandum on
19 August 1969 to the Chief, DCS, asking that DCS's
contact with Louis A. Bren (from whom Charles had
received the requirements} be terminated.

The DCS New York office on 29 August 1969 sent a
memorandum to Chief, DCS, which reviewed the case, noted
Brun had been guilty of sloppy security, and concluded
that no further requirerents would be given him. This
memorandum did not, however, say that contact would be
terminated; in fact, it szid they would continue to de-
brief Brun whenever he returned from a trip to Haiti.
This memorandum was sent to Port-au-Prince (CHTPW-1347,
17 Sept 1969).

The Station replied (Port-au-Prince 6496, 11 oct 69)
that this was not enough, that the contact should be
completely severed. WH/Branch 7 officers then met with
ur. George Musulin of DCS to discuss the matter further,
WH/7 officers maintaining that there was more political
action hazard to this contact than the FI Product
justified. Musulin agreed to raise the matter with

‘DCS. The result was a menorandum on 16 October 1969
from C/DCS to C/WHD which referred to the original WHD
memorandum of 19 August and advised that contact with
Brun has been terminated. Port-au-Prince was so informed
(DIR 48277, 21 Oct 69).

1. Headquarters agrees with Station that the con
: tinued contact between Subject of 291-357029 and IDEN A,
on bebslf of VODISH, poses = potential security threat
for the LNGARP compocents in Haiti. Upon receipt of
Ref C, the Desk sent a remorandun to Chief, WODISH, on
19 August 1969, which forwarced a resume of the Ref C
information, and requested tuat the contact betveen
IDEN A and Subject om behalf of WODISH be terminated.

2. On 7D August 1969, the FODISE officer who is in
Scuisse with 1DBB, replied to the Desk’s sesorandan as

"a. We (WODISH) have carefully considered the
Desk's couzents re IDSN A and his relationship with
Sabject. Ye bave concleded that in the matter of the
Bine questions concerning the activity of foreiga
comvenies in Haiti, IDS5 & has been guilty at

\ CONTINUATION OF
- DISPATCH

was originally iatroduced to WODISH in Kew York City,
by fabject on 15 April 1966. Until the early f2iI of
1967, much of WODISH activity with IDEN A was devoted
to arranging contacts vith various elements of LNHARP,
which IDEN 4 requested on tehalf of Subject, and
reporting operational information. To the best of
WODISH knovlecge and belief, however, none of these
contacts produced any tangible assistance to Subject’s ~
various schemes. With two exceptions, WODISH
relationship vith IDEN 4 since Octoter 1967 has been
exclusively that of foreign intelligence collection.
The exceptions were Subject's request for a secret
meeting vith 2 WOLADY envoy in May 1969, and an
independent similar request from another group in

the same month. As has been fully reported, IDEN A
made it perfectly clear to BODISH and to Subject

and to the other group that he was actiag only as

a channel and that he w2s not actively involved or
interested. Ve (WODISH) sisply transmitted the
request. Ve vish to point out that what. the Desk
calls IDEK's “Lottying” for Subject ended before
October 1967. During the nearly tvo years in

which the contact in the WODISH Kew York Office

has dealt with IDEN A, the latter has never sponsored
or "lobbied" for Subject's various schemes. IDEN A
has occasionally relayed information concerning them,
but has told WODISH repeatedly that he no longer :
wishes to be involved politically with Subject.

*e. We wish also to point out toat IDEN A, as a
regular supplier of foreign intelligence on Biti,
has supplied data which originate with Haitians
other than Sobject, and, therefore, IDEN A is not

merely Sabject's mouthpiece. Speciiically, IDEN B
and I0SH C are two of IDSH A's Haitian sources.
IDEN B is a weli-known Haitian businessman; IDEN C
is 2 former deputy.

“d. We (WODISH) are not concerned with Subject,
but are very much so Tith IDEM A. We do not believe
that IDEN A is involved in any current revolationary
gchere in Haiti. We are, bowever, disturbed at the
unprofessiona! way in which IDEN A bandled the questicns
concerning foreign companies in Haiti. We did not
request IDEX A to consult Subject about the requirenents
on foreign cospanies and, in view of the. sanner in
which IDEH A handled our requirements, we shall
continue only to accept information which he proffers
on bis return from his frequent trips to Haiti, and
shall refrain from briefing him. We have requested
our WOROMP customers to give us an evaluation of
IDEN A's intelligence reporting. Unless this evaluatioa
is unfavorable, we shall continue to exploit IDEN A
in the mnner just descrited. Insofar as contact :
tetveen IDEX A and Subject is concerned, (1) we cannot
preveat IDEN.A.from talking to Subject (or anybody
else), but (2) we have never in the past and shall
not in the future request that IDEN 4 contact Subject
on behalf of VODISH.”

3.. Te date, the VOROMP evaluation of IDEN A's
reporting has not been received. However, since WODISH
Bas agreed to refrain from briefing IDEN A prior to any
future trips he esy anke to iisiti, there should be no
recurrence of the type of situation described in Ref C.

1. Headquarters agrees with Station thst the con-
tinued contact between Subject of 201-357029 and IDEE A,

for the LNHARP components in Saiti. Upon receipt of
Ref C, the Deak sent © remurandua to Chief, YODISH, on
19 August 1969, which forwarded a resuze of the Bef C
information, and requested that the contact between
IDEN A and Subyect on behalf of WODISH be terminated.

2. On 29 August 1969, the WODISH officer who is in
ecatact with IDSH, replied to the Desk's memorandum as
follozs.

“a. We (WODISH) have carefully considered the iH
Desk’s coments re IDEN A and his relationship with i
Bubject. We have concluded that im the matter of the
mine questices concerning the activity of foreign
companies in Haiti, IDEN & has beem guilty at

“b. Subject has never doubted that IDEN A

could use to supplement bis contacts with eeabers
of the LEPURE steff im Port au Prince. IDEN A

to arranging contacts with various elerents of LEEARP,
which IDEN A requested on behalf of Subject, and
reporting operational iaformation. To the best of

WODISH Enowledge and belief, however, none of these
contacts produced any tanzible assistame to Subject’s
various schenes. ‘ita two exceptions, YODISH

exclusively that of foreign intelligence collection.
‘The exceptions were Subject's request for a secret
meeting with a HOLADY envoy in way 1969, and a
independent similar request fros another croup in
the gaze eonth. As bas teen fully reported, IDEN A
gade it perfectly «lear to WODISH and to Subject

and to the other yroup that be was actiag only as

3 channel and that he was not ectively involved or
interested. We (WCDISH) simply transmitted the
request. Ue wish to point out that what the Desk
calls IDEN's “Lottyinz™ for Sutject ended tefore
@ctoter 1967. During the nearly tvo sears in

which the comtact in the WODISH New York Office

bas dealt with IDEN A, the latter has never sponsored
or “lobbied™ for Sutject's varicus scheses. IDZN A
bas occasionally relayed information concerning them,
tat has told VODISH repeatedly that he no lon ser
wishes to be imvolved politially with Sabject.

Des Relationship vith Jouts A-Bron
Ref: W/7 Memorands, 28 Wey 69, and 19 dg 69, same subject

1. We have carefully considered WH/7's comments about
Iouls A. Brun and his relationship with Clezard Joseph Charles. we
have concluded that in the matter of the nine questions concerning
the activity of foreign cempantes in Faiti Bron has been guilty at
least of sloppy security procedures and have decided to modify our
relationship with hin. ‘4

2.. Charles has never coubted that Brun represented a
channel to US goverment authority which he could use to suppiczent
his contacts with menbers of the US Enbassy staff in Port-au-Prince.

15 Apr 1966 (see menorancum 3Y-251-66). Until the early fall of i967,
much of our activity vith Brun was devoted to arranging contacts vith
various elenents of the US goverment, which Brun requested on dezalf
of Charles, and reporting operssional inforzaticn. To the bes> c>

our knowledge and belief, however, none of these contacts prodiced any
tangible assistance to Charles's various schenes. With two excertions,
our relationship with Brun since Cctober 1967 bes been exclusiveiy that
of foreign intelligence coliecticn, The excepticzs were Cnarles's
request for a secret seeting with a US exvoy in try 1969 end en ix~
éepenéent sinilar request from another group in the same month. As
has been fully reported, Brun nade it perfectly clear to us and to
Charies and to the other group that ne wes acting only as a chance)
and that he was not activeiy icvsived or interested. We simaly trans-
mitted the requests. We wish to point out that viet WH/7 calis Bruns
"Lobbying” for Charles ended beZore October i957. During the nearly
two years in which Mitchell bas dealt with Brun, the latter bes rever
sponsored or “Lobbied” for Charies's various schenes. he has
occasionally relayed informatica concerning thea, but has told us
repeatedly that he no longer visbes to be involved politically with
Charles.

3. We wish clso to point out that Brun, as e regular
supplier of foreign intelligence on Haiti, has supplied data which
originate with Haitians other than charles, and, therefore, thet
Brun is not merely Charles's mosthpiece. Specifically, Louis
Leveque and Alfonse Lahens are two of Srun's Haitian sources. Leveque
4s a vell-known Haitian businessman; Lahens is a former deputy.

4, We are not concerned with Charles, but are very mich
so with Brun. We do not believe that Brun is involved in any currest
evolutionary scheme in Haiti. We are, however, disturbed at the u-
professional way in which Brun hentled the questions concerning foreign
companies in Haiti. We did not request =run to consult Charles about
the requirenents on foreign companies and in view of the manner in vaich
Brun handled ovr requirenents ve shall contime only to eccept informa-
tion which he proffers on his return from his frequent trips to Faiti
ead shall refrain from briefirg hin. We have requested our D2/I
consmers to give us an evaluation of Brun's intelligence reportin;.
Unless this evaluation is unfavorable, we shall continue to exploit
Brun in the manner just descrited. Insofar as contact between Brun
aad Charles is concerned, (a) we cannot prevent Brun fron talking to
Charles (or anybody else} but (b) ve have never in the past and shall
mot in the future request that Brun contact Charles on behalf of DCS.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Director, Domestic Contact Service

SUBJECT 3 DCS Case 47540 ~ Contact with
Louis A. Brun/Clenard Joseph Charles

1, On 29 July 1969, Station Port au Prince advised
that Cleaard Joseph Charles had passed 2 list of nine
questions concerning the Hzitiam econoay to an official
of the United States Embassy in Port au Prince. The list
of questions vas written in English in staadard U.S.
Governzent format and, although sterile, appeared to be
Aistelligesce requirements. Charles told the Enbassy
official that he had just finished a “big job" for the
1 Pentagon and implied that the list also cane from the
Pentagon. The Embassy official suspected that Charles
had passed a copy of the list to the National Palace.

Z 2. Ou 2 August, a representative of the WH/Haiti
Desk contacted ur. George Husulin, Operational Support
Btaii of DCS, and iearned that the ics office in Nev York
had briefed Hr. Louis A. Brun and had orally passed a
34st of CIZL requirements to Brun concerning Haiti prior
te his trip to Haiti during the week of 21 July.

Hr. Masulin speculated that Brun bad probably noted the
DCS requirenents oo paper and then bad passed a copy
to Charles upon his arrival in Haiti.

S$. Yor a number of years, the United States Govern ‘
ment has been aware of the political ambitions of Chsrles . '
and his alleged plotting to overthrow the Duvalier regime. -
In 1967, this rather open plotting led to his imprison-

i ment for over one year. Also, since May 1963, Charles

has been trying to obtain support from the United States

Governnent for his plots but he has been consistently

febuffed. Charles is not held in bigh esteem by U.5.

* officials and his motives are highly questionable. Be.

owes his position in Haiti to hip relationship with

"~~ Duvalier and his ability to successfully manage sone of

Chaelite fate

i
an clita aint accent ie paar eee



*

wea ertiilaviin aye

the core notorious financial rackets of the regine.
Charles enjoys no political folioving and even the *plois”
with which he is associated are viewed with cossiderable
reserve. Por example, we hare never beon able to confirm
that Charles was involved vith the "military junta” formed
in May 1969, as be clained. In Yebruary 1969, the U.B.
@mbessy in Port au Prince commented that, vith regard to |
the most recent plotting of Charles, “the possibility ‘
eannct be excluced that Charles....cocld be a provocation 2
to detormine the real rotives of the United States Govern— a
went towards the Duvalier regime.” We concur in the :
Embassy's viers. j

4. Dering the past three yeers, the YH Division has
been tept advised of the contact between DCS and Brun and
i his relstionship with Charles. Ve are also avare from
fi DCS and other sources of the efforts by Brun to obtain Hl
i support from the United States Government for Charles. H
i Brun is, of course, a close collaborator of Charles end i
i @ business representative of his in New York City. Brun 4
{

i

seretasheatiabsinaen

i has contacted officials of the Department of Defense,
i the Depsrtnent of State, and even a person vith access to
| Presicent Johnson on Charles‘ behalf. The Chief of te
i Caribbean Affairs of the Department of State cstegorically
told Brun in June 1967 that the United States Government j
i vas not interested in supporting tke plots of Charles or 3
4 anyone else egsinst Duvalier, but this advice seems to j
have fallen oa deaf ears. Tze most recent example of i
Brun's lobbying eas in May 1939 when Brun passed on to j
pes & request from Charles for a secret meeting between }
4 . envoy and a representative of the "rilitary junta.”
a Beua's involvement with Charles requires that he be con—
‘ . Bidered a biased source of infornation. While some of the
information Brun has obtained from Charles has been of
interest, there is tardly anything that sas not available
through other channels and indeed, much of it wes slanted.

5. As was set.forth in VH/7 mesoranda to the
Operational Support Staff, DCS, on 15 July 1968 and
28 May 1969, we intorpose no objection to DCS saintaining
contact with Brun for its ows purposes. Hovever, the

REFEREBCES: A. DIKECTOR 26288 dated 1 August 1969

B. HTPA-2443 dated 29 July 1969
ACTION REQUIRED: See Paragraph 5.

1. The Station would like to offer its views on
the WODISG contact, through Identicy ot Paragraph 1
Reference A (hereinatter IDEN), with 201-357029, as well
as ci the question of the requirezents which 201-357029
gave LYFURE and which were forwarded to Headquarters in
Reference B.

2. Since IDEN has been told that his contact is with
LSSHOE and since he has told 201-357029 that fact, and since
201-357029 has apparently, in his cind at least,converted that
fact inte contact with RVROCK, and has probably spread both
stories with his associates and thereby throughout the ?.ocal
milieu, we have, in effect, a dangerous security situation.
When we consider that the LNFUXE receives all tne information

that 201-357029 gives ID=Y anywa’ most ot the time receives.
the information siyes Ty from iin Pee TPL then we have an
operation that is ditricult to justity.

3. In the case of the requirements forwarded with
Reference B, we have a situation in which WODISH levied
ee coroca? on 201-357029, through IDEN. 201-357029

then turned those requirements over to LNPURE which returned
them via 201-357029 and IDEN to WCDISH. Why not cut out the
giddleman and the security cogplications, and save the headaches?

4. The Station teels that the ISH handling of 201-357029
results in a case that has the potential of causing
blens for AKULE, and that it could well be that AXULZ will
made to bear the blame since elenents within RVROCK might
feel thet the ultimate responsibility tor supervision of the
case lies with AKULE.

bad passed @ copy of the list to tre National Palece.

2. 0a 2 August, a representative of the WH/Haiti

Staff of DC?, asd learned that the DCS office in Hew York
bad briefed Hr. Louis A. Prun and had orally passed o list
of CIRL requiresents to Erun concerning Haiti prior to his

the United States Government was not inte-ested in supporting

1, This meporandus will cerve to confirm the telephone 5

conversations between your office and the Chief of tne gaiti  {
Desk on 15 anc 27 Mey 1969 concerning the request mece
throagh Mr. Lovig A. Bram om the above subject. During these 7
‘conversations, your office was edvised that the WH Division
bag no interest ia ccatacting any representative or senbe: H
of the plotting group. j

3. The WH Division considers Cleward Joseph Charles
to be g@ perennisl anti-Duvalier plotter in Port su Prince :
with little seers or following to carry out his enti-goverm~
ment designs. During the weex of 1] Way 1960, Casries i
Byproacbec tae Eabsssy in Port su Prince vith basicelly the Hy
wape inforsation as relayed to the DCS office in New York 4
ty Mr. Brun. Tze only difference was that be did not request i
that @ U.8. Government o; ficial make contact with the intermal

thet the 0.8. CGoverneent vould look
once the coup vse laumcoed. The ost:
U.8, Government bad # firm policy not to intervene in such
matters and that Bo such assurance could bo expectec.

j

3. Since 1967, Cuarles has eade similar overtures to
the 0.3. Government for support b ati-governsent plans.
Whea reviewing these spproaches, there has always been some
doubt as to the accuracy of the information that Charics

(or Brun) bas furnigned.  Fhile it tas accepted thet Charles
wae actually plotting sgainst Duvalier, 1t could sever be
deternined 1f he wes actually e member of the plotting group,
t which usually includec aembere of the Haitian dray, or if

t Charlee bad eleply become avare of an eati-Duvalier plot and
