SUBJECT: RetfOl GONZALEZ Vonzales -JConments on Interview
in May 1979 in Miami. ff

C17 Meu OE nig supject was interviewed on the occasiono! both our
visits to Miami and we spent at least some 6 hours with him and
still haven't finished. He told us on the occasion of the last
visit that he still wants to tell us about some things going
son in the Cuban exile communisty in Miami, that some Cubans are

. -buying arms and planning actions against CASTRO, etc. He wants to
tell us, he said, thal ‘we'll know and won't be surprised but he
denies all part for himself in any such illegal actions. He does
not believe it possible, given internal and external conditions
now prevailing, to overthrow CASTRO anytime soon but says if it
were possible, he would be the first to start preparations for
that purpose, When we next go to Miami we will listen to what
additional he has to say.

2. Subject was for the writer the most interesting and perhaps
the most oroductive of the peonle we were assigned to interviews,
This guy is cut from a different mold from the other 7, He is

gtough, intelligent, cunning, shrewd , lacking in formal education,
but a real toughinefighter who knows what he wants and knows how
to go about it. He is, too, I think, a real opportunist, and this
may explain in part his reason for putting on the 6 Nov 61 TV-

project. coming clean,on many of our questions, but the only two questions
| xecuted by to which hgyreacted noticeably were the ones about the TV program
{GOC. Files and Octavion BAR: These two visibly upset him eventho I feel

vindicate he knew or thought they would be thrown at him and hetad his
Reinol knew answers Prepared. More about the TV program and BAR20SO later.

Hi and ALVAREZ had been on opposite ends politically in previous

| Then, when CASTRO came along he propelled ALVAREZ to the post in

the CTC to which Subject had democratically been chosene The
imposition of CASTRO'S slate took place at a CTC congress in Nov
1960, He claims that he has never seen ALVAREZ since the business
of turning over his files to ALVAREZ was done in 1960, He knows
of course that ALVAREZ went on to other jobs, eventually to the
Cuban Embassy in Madrid, and eventually defected to the US. He

5. So far as he’s awa re there was only one Octavio BARROSO s:
the one you're talking about is the same one known to him, the
same one shot in late 1961 or early 1962, he's not certain exact];
when, He claims that PUJAL and BARROSO were captured at the same ;
time or at about the same tinge aye nat it sight have been iu
PUJAL who reported to G-2 on E“but in any case he(>ubject) didn't
do it. There were others in jail at that time, also, he says, who
could have told G-2 about BARROSO's revolutionary activities. As
stated, that question, as did the one on the TV program, visibly
supset him so I'm not at all sure that we got the truth.

6. Subject was arrested on 11 October 1961 in a raid oa the
Cesar Odio Farm, along with a number of © people. On 30 Septmber
. 1961 a woman belonging to his unit, Dalia RGE, was arrested, t
allegedly placing a bomb in a company there in Havana called CIAes,
Subject was carrying documentation in alias but almost immediately
he was confronted with Dalia who identified him to 4-2, But, the |
most irportant evddence is the fact that over the next few days |
and weeks those known to Dalia in that organization were arrested;
those not known to her were not, Although alledgedly arrested 7

walking the street. A few months later Dalig had married a lieutenant

7. The TV program - why? It was the first such appearance by anyo:
arrested that could be called in favor of CASTRO.

The MRP had a pact amongst themselves, he claims, which stated

that anyone captured would not talk for 72 hours, to give those
still free time to change hidding places, etc, then one would be
permitted, if forced to, to tell minor things, things it was
thxought the Ge2 might already know. "

Me was taken to a place referred to as POINT X and stripped
naked, He was interrogated almost continuously, lights were kept
on and all sorts of threats were made against him, He could hear
in the building the voices of others em. to him in the MRP,
among otbérs FernandS ‘Rojas, Fernan ivera.(now-in Caracas),

* Minister of Foreign Xelations, but then just a secr 'y to the -
nistry of Interior. MALMIERCA was assisted at times by Lt.
“ALFONSO (fnu), apparently an assistant to MALMIERCA, who was much
gore intelligent and much better trained than MALMIERCA, The
latter did a poor job and got little out of Subject but ALFONSO
did a much better job .

‘After several days he was told that CASTRO himself would visit
thim and: personally conduct the interrogatién, He claims that he
told MALMIERCA that that would do no good for it was CASTRO himself
he helped to teach Subject many years before how to fight the
Commies and prevent their penetration into the 1aboh Povenenss
As a result, he says, CASTRO did not come but/R JALDEZ Sids

VALDEZ told him that the decision had already been made not
to shoot him ( Subject) but that some or most of the military
section people of his organization (MRP) in jail wouldhave to
pay with their lives for what they, Subject and others of the
MRP had done. The only way he could save them, VALDEZ said, would
be to go on TV and tell the nation what his organization had been
doing, tell them how useless resistance to CASTZO was, and at the
same time condem the US for its complicity in anti-CASTRO effortse

Now, Subject claims that some of this fitted after a fashicn into
his own thinking and size up of the state of things. He claims that
1) he had decided some time earlier that internat resistance of the
sort the MRP was donducting was useless, and 2) that it would be
better to leave the country and fight from abroad, and 3) that he
bad proposed just such a zove at a large meeting of MRP leaders
held just a few days before his capture. However, the student and
workers’ representatives at that meeting did not support such a
move so no action was taken, then came his own arrest.

An attemt was to have been made on CASTRO's life, using a
bazooka from a room overlooking a public plaea where CASTRO was
to appear on 4 October 1961, and VALDEZ had found out about thase
plans, through Dalia, Subject assumes, Anyway, Subject clains
that three people were to have gone up to the room, which had been
preperly prepared and an escape route worksd/out , just prior to
the ceremony, Of the three, one guy, Antonib "VALADE! jana got
scold feet and took off for the States instead, Racl'VENTA Wel)
Mazo was there but did not fire the weapon, for some reason not
known to Subject, and the third man, whose’oame he could not
remember, ap>arently did not go up to the room either.s

Well, believing that such resistance activities were in
fact futile and believing that CASTRO would in fact shoot
his men, and believing that he could all alone determine
what was to be said on TV, he decided that to accept the offer
was the correct thing to do. He could not have the blood of
others on his hand, he said, untéss something very worthwhile
was being accomplished. He professed to VALDEZ, however, that he
had no authority all by himself to make that decision and asked
to discuss it with three or four MRP leaders there in jail with
him, VALDEZ agreed that he could discuss it withF8ernando ROJAS
but with no one else, and that was done. ROJAS reluctantly

approved.

He wrote the presentation he was to give on TV and he siad
no substantive changes were made by the Cubans. He constructed
it, he saiJ, to 1) tell them as much as possible what they
wanted tohear without doirg any real harm, 2) protect those i
still at large, and 3) give away as little senstitive information
as possible. He said he realized fully what he was doing, that
he would do it acain if caught in the same situation, and that
he takes full responsibility now as then for what he did and
said and still feels it was the only logical think he could
do. Again, this was not a subject he enjoyed discussing; he appear:
ed in fact a bit embarassed by it all, but he knew it would be i]
coming at some point.

8, Why didn't the Cubans release him after the ransom was pajd
‘them? Because he would not sign a paper in effect saying was
sorry and asking CASTRO'S forgiveness. He meet with Alo 5 JO:
and three G-2 military officers to discuss the relea se and the
conditéons of the release one day after the ransom had been paid,
and when he refused the G-2's conditions PUJOL took a piece of
paper out and scribbled on it an agreement, which said Subject
would cbligate himself not to become involved again in anti- ‘
CASTRO activities if released, and he agreed to sign that. In |
fact, he did sign it. PUJOL then handed it to the military officess
but they said the Cuban Vovt could not accept it. It was after
that that the money was reutrned.

How did he get out when he did? Through the efforts of Gabriel

close, as are GARCIA's wife and Subject's children.

an effort to bring about Subject s release but had had no luck unti:
the GARCIA's went to work“on it, In early November (he thinks) of
1977 GARCIA and wife visited Cuba and svent sometime with CASTRO.
GARCIA's wife allegedly told CASTRO that she had one important
favor to ask of him, to release a good f{xend of theirs who had by
then held for many years. CASTRO promised to do it immediately.
However, by 11 Dee 77 Subject was still not out and GARCIA, on his

Subject when promised but that there were many in the top
echelon of govt that mere opposed to his release and that it
took him some time tobring them around, However, he called
or spoke to ABRANTES, who was with him at that time, and told
him to find Subject and have him brought to G-2 offices the
next morning at 1000 hours. That was done and in fact a “<2

power, he says, to accom plish that objective, He has been

to Jamadea once to neggtiate with Cuban authorities, and once _

*to Havana. My team member will cover those activities in his
report.

he is in the used clothes business, and exoects to rent a place

believe, at an early date, He expects to cater pretty much

to Latin Anericans traveling to the US, hopefully mostly

Veneauelans and Brazilians for they are the ones with the

most Spending money, He's already sold to many of them, has

@ good many friends and contacts in Venezuela, and believes

that he'll get a lot of business from Latin America, He has

a friend who is prepared to make a $10,000 loan, and a bank a

has agreed to finance him to the tune of $20,000 and it*ll

take about $30,000 to steck his business adquately. He can

and will get short term credit from some of his suppliers but

will probably be limited to 60 to 90 days. He's very optizistic

about the future, appears in good health, although somewhat over
weight, and his wife works, The works in the office for a Puerto
‘ican packing company.

13. Suv§ect w as most aopreciative for the offer of a physical

the Agency. Nevertheless, he probably is expecting some finaancial*
compensation for his time in orison, although this was never

In late 1969, a committee of prisoners at Guanajay, com
ed of Subjec eli jaller,] L{hn Pernandad, Antonio
i Gis Migeal Garcia Armengol, met with a representative of
the Ministry of the Interior, Lieutenant Mariano Rodriguez and
the Guanajay Director, Lieutenant Cosne. The purpose was to
work out a work-rehabilitation plan without political indoc-
trination. ‘They had three forral and several inforral
meetings while visiting proposed work sites for schools,
pig farms, etc. The Procressive Plan from the Ministry of
the Interfor came in February 1979 as a result of these dis-
cussions, The plan was essentially that proposed by the
prisoners, but the GOC added a proviso to “attend discussions
of political matters," About 100 nrisoners agreed, others
refused, The Ministry people explained it would consist only ~~ -
of listening to GOC officials reading Marxist pamphlets. The
prisoners still refused. The Ministry finally struck that
point and published the plan, without reference to political
matters, ‘The work-rehabilitation program then began about
late 1970 or early 1971.
In 1970, a Soviet General, advisor to the Ministry of
the Interior, made an inspection of Guanatay, with 8 or 10
other Soviets. Their escort was a IstLt, now a Major (name

Rafael Rodriguez told Subject he had a generally favorable H
attitude toward the release of political prisoners; he thought
the GOC was ready to discuss it and mayhe something could be
worked out. Subject talked to Gabriel about the prospects on
the plane and later in Spain. ‘hen Subject got to the U.S.,
he wrote letters about prisoner release to: friends in Venezu~
ela in COPEI. This went on through May, June, and into July
1978, Through Gabriel Garcia in "exico, Subject sent a message
to Sergio Del Valle, Ninister of the Interior, saying Subject.
wanted to talk to somebody outside Cuba about prisoner release.

The answer was that the GOC was ready, and Subject could come
to Cuba in July 1978. Subject refused to go back to Cuba at
that time, and suggested Kingston. ‘The GOC accepted.

Prior to this tine, a "Mr. Fisher" fron the Agency had
come to Miami to talk with Subject, who now sent a letter to
"Sr. Pescador" via the P.O, Box of Catherine Hardy in Washing-

The GO¢ representatives made the following points:
(1) They didn't want some of the names included, but did want
some others to be added.

(2) They wanted more prisoners included, not so few,
(3) They wanted a campaign to convince the U.S..to inprove
relations.

(4) They wanted the U.S. blockade dropped. Me
(5) They wanted to stop violent action against Cuba by refugees.
(6) They wanted pressure groups of refugeas going to Washington

to influence the USG along the lines above.
Subject said he had no control over any of those things,

that he had gone on a personal, humanitarian nission but the

GOC wanted to raise the talks to a higher, more political |

level, and apparently wanted them in Habana. The GOC repre-

sentatives asked Subject to suggest some names for a priscner

On Monday, Subject and his wife returned to Miami.

Several weoks later, Subject received a nessage, thosugh

Carbonell in Kingston, that the first prisoners would come
out in September 1978 (they actually came in October), and
that some of the people on his list, particularly De Rojas

been shot in Cuba by Castro and she wanted to visit his
tomb, On the third trip, whe was allowed to do so.)

In the 2 hour meeting, Pidel and the 5 people on the
committee agreed on ground rules. In an exchange with Pidel,
Subject made the point that, in this situation, everybody at
the table would be winners if it worked, but all would be
Josers if it failed. Pidel would gain in international

stature, while the cornittee world gain the prisoners
release and make a start toward reunification of the Cuban
family. The others in his group were a little shocked and

afraid at Subject's frank statement, but Pidel agreed with hin,
When Fidel came in, Benes took him around making introduc-

tions. When they came to Subject, Fidel said, “Yes, wa are

old friends.“ At a coffee break, Msgr. Bosquet was the only

one to hear the following exchange. Fidel told Subject that

he would have heen released much sooner except that many people

in tha GOC opposed it because Subject had burned the £1 Encanto

Department Store on 16 April 1961. Pidel said Subject had done
it as a preliminary “to the invasion that he knew was coming

‘the next day. Subject revlied that he had not done it, - and

had known nothing ahout the invasion ‘any more than was known
on the street at the time.

The most substantive matters were about prisoner release,
the Cuban cormunity in Miami, and about anti-Castro terrorist
activities. Pidel said that if there were no further such
acts, it would be a sign that the USG had taken proper control
measures, but if terrorism breaks out again, it would mean the

USG had allowed it to happen.

Current Personal Situation

Subject went from Habana to Spain in Dec77, and to
Miami in Jan78. For about 3 months, he worked as an account-
ant in a clothing factory, then he switched to the VIASA
airline until Oct78. He quit to form his own small company,
and because the job with VIASA left too little tine free to
work on prisoner exchange. Subject has tried to put together
an import-export business in clothing, but has too small a
