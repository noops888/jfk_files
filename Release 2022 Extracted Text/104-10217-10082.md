and ALVAREZ had been on opposite ends politically in previous

years, when ALVAREZ was working at the Chase Manhattan Bank in

Havana and representing the bank workers union, but they had

put aside their differences to nork together against BAlISta.

Then, when CASTRO came along he propelled ALVAREZ to the post in

the CTC to which Subject had denocratically been chosen. Ibe

imposition of CASTRO's slate took place at a CIC congress in Nov

1960. He claims that he has never seen ALVAREZ since the business

of turning over his files to ALVAREZ was done in 1960. He knons

of course that ALVAREZ went on to other jobs, eventually to the

Cuban Embassy in Madrid, and eventually defected to the US. He

Commies and prevent their penetration into the labor, movement.

As a result, he says, CASTRO did not come but: RaniTOrVALDEZ didi

VALDEZ told him that the decision had already been made not

to shoot him ( Subject) but that some of most of the military

section people of his organization (MRP) in jail nouldhave to

pay with their lives for what they,

Subject and others of the

MRP had done. The only way he could save them, VALDEZ said, mould

be to go on IV and tell the nation what his organization had been

doing, tell them how useless resistarce to CASIRO mas, and al the

Non, subject clains that some of this fitted after a fashion into

his own thinking and size up of the seate of things. He claias that

1) he had decided sone time earlier that internat resistance of the

sort the MP mas dorducting was useless, and 2) that it mould be

better to leave the country and fight fros abroad, and 3) tha: he

Bell, believing that such resistance activilies were in

that CASIRO would in fact shoot

his men, and believing that he could all alone determire

what was to be said on TV. he decided that to aciept the offer

was the correct thing to do. He could not have the blood of

others on his hand, he said, untess souething very worthwhile

mas being accomplished. He professed to VALDEZ, hoMever, that he

had no authority all by hinself to sake that decision and asked

to discuss it with shree or four MRP leaders there in jail with

him. VALDEZ agreed that he could discuss it withFlernando RUJAS

but with no one else, and that mas done. ROJAS reluctantly

approved.

He wrote the presentation he as to give on IV and he siad

no substantive changes were made by the Cubans. He constructed

it, he saido

to l) tell them as much as possible what they

wanted tohear without doing any real harm,

still at large, and 3) give away as little senstitive information

as possible. He said he realized fully what he nas doing, that

he would do it açain if caught in the same situation, and that

he takes full responsibility now as then for uhat he

said and still feels it nas the only logical think he could

do. Again, this nas not a subject he enjoyed discussing; he appear.

ed in fact a bit embarassed by 18 all, but he knew it would be

coming at some point.

8. Why didn't the Cubans release him after the ransom was paid

hem? Because he would not sign a paper in effect saying bexua

orry and asking CASTRO's forgiveness. He beet with AlONsoVPiJO

and three G-2 military officers to discuss the relea se and the

conditions of the release one day after the ransom had been paid,

and when he refused the G-2's conditions PUJOL

took a piece of

paper out and scribbled on it an agreement, which said Subject

would cbligate hinself not to become involved again in anti-

CASTRO activities if released, and he agreed to sign that. In

fact, he did sign it. Pwol then handed it to the military officess
