Mexico Station Coverage of Soviet and Cuban Embassies (1963)

1.

Unilateral Coverage:

From the time the Mexico Station was opened in April 1947 until

the arrival of Mr. Win Scott as Chief of Station in 1955, the Station had

developed a support apparatus to exploit leads from the Soviet Embassy in

Mexico City. This umbrella type project (LIPSTICK

liatited only by the availability of a listening post

nearby and the availability of langauge (English, Spanish, Soviet, Polish,

Czech, etc.) transcribers. Generally, these were Mexican or Mexican-

• American recruited agents.

Three photographic sites were handled by a Station case officer

• assisted by technicians on TDY from Headquarters who advised the Station

on the best types of cameras, films, and concealment devices. These

operations had sub-crypts under project LIPSTICK (namely: LIMITED, LILYRIC

and LICALLA). LIMITED was a fixed site directly opposite the Soviet Em-

bassy (across the street) which had both a vehicle and a pedestrian en-

trance. The gate to the Soviet Embassy was on the northwest corner of the

Soviet compound and the LIMITED site was diagonally across a double laned

street on the southeast corner of that block. (See attached diagram).

LIMITED was the first photo base and operated strictly on an experimental

basis in the early stages.. This base, however, was closed when the Sta-

tion received word that the photograph of the "unidentified man" was

being released by the Warren Commission. LILYRIC was an alternate photo-

graphic base. It was located in an upper story of an apartment building

on the same side of the street as the LIMITED site bu

le middle of

the block south. It had a planted view of the

it gate of the Soviet

Embassy. LICALLA, the third photograph

sites was located in one of a

row of four houses on the south

it gethe Soviet Embassy compound.

This site overlooked the

Aggreen of the Soviet Embassy compound. The

purpose of this operat

Gnawas to get good identification photographs of

soviet personnel.

The three photographic sites were managed by a re-

cruited agent who was a Mexican citizen, the son of an American mother

and Mexican father (deceased). This agent collected the film from the

LIMITED and LILYRIC sites three times a week. The film was then de-

veloped and printed into 8 x 10 contact print strips..

LICALLA f7Im was

originally processed in the Station but in early 1959, due to the resig-

nation of a technician, this film like that of LIMITED and LILYRIC was

processed on the outside by a recruited agent.

(

Mobile surveillance was conducted by two American staff officers.

These two officers organized a surveillance team of six recruited agents

which used late model cars and a panel truck for surveillance. The team

could be activated by radio from the LIMITED site whenever someone of

interest left the gate of the Soviet Embassy.

These agents were aware of

the LIMITED site since they had been issued LIMITED photographs for

identification purposes.

The Station

also conducted a unilateral mad

unreliable and insecure as characterized by

the nature of the Mexican services at that time. The Mexican Direction

of Federal Security (DFS), with which we conducted liaison, was a hip-

pocket group run out of the Mexican Ministry of Government. This-Ministry

was principally occupied with political investigations and control of

foreigners. Their agents were win ru ted, and corrupt. A Station

officer trained a number of them in name tracing and travel control.

In

1958, at the instigation of a Mexican official, a joint telephone tap

operation came into existence.

The operation, which became known as

LIENVOY, was run by a Mexican officer. The listening post had 30 lines

connected at one time. The transcription room was staffed by Mexican

Army officers. In 1961, because of mismanagement by the Mexican prin-

cipals, the Station chief, himself, became the project case officer. A

Station officer assisted him in the daily supervision of the listening

post, and in picking up the transcripts and the tapes. There was also

an American technician inside the listening post.

3. Oswald Coverage:

In mid-1962, the Mexican officer in charge of LIENVOY (the

Joint tap operation) asked the American officer at the blenvoy listening

post for the telephone numbers of the Soviet, Cuban and Satellite Em-

bassies in anticipation of possible coverage

the Station immediately

disconnected all of the unilateral,

taps on these Embassies so

that they would not be discove

en the Mexicans hooked up their

taps. The Mexicans so

eafter connected five Cuban lines, five

Soviet lines, three Czech lines, two Polish lines, and one Yugoslav

line. At the listening post, a live monitor made short summaries of

conversations of interest which were then included in a daily resume

for the Chief of Station. Later, when a reel was completely recorded,

full transcripts were typed and passed to the Station; however, there

was usually a time lag of a day or two.

in a language other than Spanish or English were taken to another location

for translation and typing. Mr. Boris Tarasoff did the Russian transla-

tions but because of the volume of Russian conversations, the translations

usually ran about a week behind the date of the conversation.

As soon as the Station learned that an American identifying him-

self as Lee Oswald phoned the Soviet Embassy, Miss Ann Goodpasture of the

Station started screening all photographs. However, here

again, there

was a backlog because the photographs were picked up

a week

The instructions were to cover the entire work day (office hours) and to

photograph all Soviets, their families, all foreigners, and cars with

foreign license plates. Human error did occur but generally the agents

were conscientious. The Cuban Embassy coverage had more sophisticated

equipment using a pulse camera which frequently developed mechanical dif-

ficulties.

Oswald came to the attention of the listening post operators

from a tap of the Soviet line.. It was picked up and taken to Mr. Boris

There was some delay because Station personnel

waited to compare the

photographs with the typed transcript. All transcripts were made in

either Spanish or English since the Chief of Station could read only

these two languages and because he personally screened the transcripts

(Coverage of Soviet and Cuban Embassies)

1. Unilateral coverege. From the time the vexico Station was opened in

April 1947 (by Bill Doyle) until arrival of Win Scott as COS in 1956, Charles

Anderson III (still in LA/HQ) had developed a support apparatus to tad

exploit leads from the Soviet Embassy. This umbrella type project (LIFEAT)

consisted of multi line phone taps, three photo sites, a mobile surveillance

team and a mail intercept operation.

a. Fhone taps were placed by an employee of the telephone company

who lias handled by David WILSTED (pseudo).

The number of lines

closed when

the Station got word thet the choto of "uniden man" was being releasea to the

public by the Warren Cornission. The photo operators were moved

to another apt

nearby. The property was sold (under an operational agreenent with LINOUSINE

for a long term lease on the top floor of a new apartment biding to be built

on this site). LILYRIC was planned as an alternate photo base to LINITED.

It was in an upper storey (3rd floor-check) on the sare side of the street

as LIITED but in the middle of the block South. It had a slanted view of

the front gate of the Soviet Eirbassy. The agents in LIMITED and LILYRIC (both

About nid 1962 (check date) Litivoy outside lexi rept asked

for the telephone nunvers of the Soviet, Cuban, and Satellite Embassies.

With this forevarning, LIFEAT (unilateral coverage) was disconnected. However,

as I recall, the dexicans connected 5 Cuban lines, 5 Soviet lines, 3 Czech,

2 Polish, and 1 lugoslav line. The basehouse listening

post had a live

nonitor tico made short sumnaries of interesting conversations for a daily

resume which was received each day arourd 8 a.1. (passed by Flick to Goodcasture

to get to Scott before 9.a.I.) Later (when the reel was completely recorded)

full transcripts were typed ard passed to the station in the same way, however,

there was usually a time lag of a day or so. Those transcripts which ad

Russien or another language besides Spanish or English went out of

the listening

post the day after the transcript (of other conversations .ot the

reel) was

typed.. These reels were taken to another location were

were translated

and typed. In the case of the Russian, rhetations,

Boris Tarasoff usually ran

about a week behind

the date at

engagversation because of the volume of

Russian conversations

am

he-members of the Soviet Erbassy. During this

period (fall of 1963) the reels were probably being brought into the station

and carried to Boris by one of the people from the Soviet Section or they ray

have been carried to him by Flick but I think I brought the reel in and gave

it to Herbert Manell to take to Boris. Herbert Manell and his wife Barbara

handled all of the processi:g of Soviet transcripts. Hy job involved screening

the photographs as soon as we learned that the man calling hinself Oswald was

probably an Anerican. However, here again there was a backlag because the

photos were picked up three times a week but the ones ricked up were usually

for dates a few days previously because the doctor processed the film on a

night time basis. Photographs were made usually until one roll vas used but

later we got it changed to one day coverage on each roll - in other words the

operators cleared the camera each day tether there was andians a full

roll of film exposed.. Instructions were to cover office hours, photograch each

error did occur but generally the agents were conscientious.

The Cuban

embassy coverage had more sophisticated equipient (a pulse ca:era) but it

frequently develored rechanical difficulties. Bob Zambarnardi and Scathar

(I think) handled this film - pick up and delivery. Lorne l'ackay screened

the film inside the station.

I am certain that the Oswald call came to our attention fron the

Soviet line. It was picked up and taken to Boris for a translation because

the caller was trying to speak Russian. Any delay was caused by waiting to

compare the photographs with the typed transcript. There were no copies of

transcrists every made in languages other than Spanish

or

mlish because Win

Scott could read only those two languages ard he

DURAN: Yes, he is still here.

According to the letters that he showed them from the (Soviet)

Consulate

in Washington, he wants®

go to the USSR to stay

answer had not been received (by him) regarding his problem.

That accordingly these transactions take

Yet accordingly

(the American),

showed him a letter in which he (the

American) is a member of an organization in favor of Cuba

said that the Cubans could not give him the visa without

the Russian visa and now the Soviet doesn't know what to do

with him, because he has to wan

DURAN:

the

problem with him (the American)

is thay he does

that case it

is very diffi

to,give him a visa, because he was

thinking of

sessing his visa, because he knew it was

going to take a long time waiting for the Russian visa in

Cuba, and then go on to the USSR.

SOVIET :

or the permission from the USSR to return to her country, (if)

she is going to receive her visa in Washington, then having

this visa, she can communicate to whatever place, this

They can only give the visa according to instructions.

Item 74, page 2

An unidentified man (speaking Spanish) calls the Soviet Embassy

Consulate at 1037 hours and asks

for the Consul.

the Consul is not there.

The unidentified man asked what is needed

to get visas to go to Odessa.

He is told to call back at 1130 hours.

Item 137, page 2

At 1235 hours a man named ALATRISTE (not a Soviet) from inside the

Soviet Embassy Consulate calls out to number 45-37-72 (Colonial

America, probably a pension or hotel but number not listed in the

telephone directory) and speaks with a man named SAN ROMAN.

ALATRISTE says that he is in the Russian Embassy and they need to

know what day the boat

"KALONIA" will arrive in Odessa, that the

need copies of the passenger manifest....

(One concludes that ALATRISTE and SAN ROMAN are shipping representatives

for the boat "KALONIA"', and needed routine visa information, First

a call was made to the

first listing for the Soviet Embassy

in the

Mexican telephone directory (which turned outato be the Military Attache).

They got the phone number for the Consulate and the address.

After

making a call to the Consulate and learning that it would not be open

until 1130 hours, ALATRISTE went to the address to get the needed

information.)

• Item 395, pages 7 and 8

Just after 1600 hours,

the Soviet Consulate received a call from the

Cuban Consulate (Sylvia DURAN) who said she had there a U.S. citizen

who had requested a transit visa to Cuba because he is going to the

USSR. DURAN wants to know with whom he spoke at the Soviet Embassy

because she sent him over to them telling him that if the Soviets

approved the visa then the Cubans would give him one without anything

more, advising the (Department of)

Inmigration in Cuba.

She wants

to know with whom he spoke because he says that he doesn't know

either with what person

and who told him that certainly there would

be no problem.

The Soviet asks DURAN to wait a minute.

After a

short wait DURAN explains the same thing to another Soviet.

This

Soviet tells her to leave her telephone (number) and her name and

someone will return the call.

DURAN gives her name and

telephone

number 11-28-47 then says as a personal thing, she has moved and

has not advised them of a change of address so will not receive their

Bulletin and can give it to them now.

The Soviet asks her to call

KOUKHARENKO in order to change that address and asks for the name

of the (Cuban) Cultural Attache.

DURAN says it is Teresa PROENZA

whose number is 14-13-26. The Soviet thanks her.

DEPARTMENT OF STATE

THE DIRECTOR OF INTELLIGENCE AND RESEARCH

WASHINGTON

SECRET

OCT 25 1960

Dear Dick:

Our efforts to answer recent informal inquiries, including some

from the White House Staff,

have revealed that, though CIA and

the

FET have detailed records concerning Americans who have been recruited

as intelligence agents by Bloe countries, there does not appear to be

a complete listing of those Americans now living in Bloc countries

who might be called "defectors".

Using the definitions of DID 4/2,

these persons might be described as those who have either been

capable of providing useful intelligence to the Bloc or those whose

desire to resettle in Bloc countries has been significantly exploited

for communist propaganda purposes. This would mean that no attention

need be paid to Americans whose resettlement within the Bloc had no

counter-intelligence implications or had attracted no particular

attention; for instance, this definition rould not cover individual

US citizens of East European or Chinese origin who retured to the

"homeland" because they had never been completely assimilated into

the American society.

There is attached a list of such persons, covering the last 18

months, and it would be appreciated if the Agency could verify and

possibly expand this list for the use of interested Bureaus of, the

Department.

Sincerely yours,

Hands.
