case of laziness on the part of the Soviet case officer (which

Mexico Station Coverage of Soviet and Cuban Embassies (1963)

1. Unilateral Coverage: oe

From the time the Nexico Station was opened in April 1947 unei?
the arrival of Mr. Win Scott as Chief of Station in 1955, the Station had
developed a support apparatus to exploit leads from a, Soviet Embassy in
Mexico City. This umbrella type project (LIPSTI sabsted of multiline |
phone taps, three photographic sites, a “am bi ance team and a |
mail intercept operation.

Telephone taps -(LI) or by an employee of the local
telephone company wi & by a Station case officer. The a i

of lines tapped wa! ted only by the ‘availability of a listening post
nearby and the availability of langauge (English, Spanish, Soviet, Polish,
. Czech, etc.) transcribers. Generally, these were Mexican or Mexican-
- American recruited agents.
Three photographic sites were handled by a Station case officer

assisted ‘by technicians on TDY from Headquarters who advised the Station

on the best types of cameras, films, and concealment devices. These
operations had sub-crypts under project LIPSTICK (namely: LIMITED, LILYRIC
and LICALLA). LIMITED was a fixed site directly opposite the Soviet Em-
bassy (across the street) which had both a vehicle and a pedestrian en-

trance. The gate to the Soviet Embassy was on the northwest‘corner of the

Soviet compound and the LIMITED site was diagonally across a double Taned
street on the southeast corner of that block. (See attached diagram).
LIMITED was the first photo base and operated strictly on an experimental
basis in the early stages. This base, however, was closed when the Sta-
tion received word that the photograph of the “unidentified man" was
being released by the Warren Commission. LILYRIC was an alternate photo-
“ graphic base. It was located in an upper story of an apartment building
on the same side of the street as the LIMITED site oe middle of
% the block south. It had a Planted view of ee te of the Soviet ; i

Embassy. LICALLA, the third photogray we located in one of a
row of four houses on the sout aN he Soviet Embassy compound.

This site overlooked th see of the Soviet Embassy compound. The

purpose of this over Wis to get good identification photographs of
Soviet personnel. The three photographic sites were managed by a re-
cruited agent who was a Mexican citizen, the son of an American mother
and Mexican father (deceased). This agent collected the film from the
LIMITED and LILYRIC sites three times a week. The film was. then de-
veloped and printed into 8 x 10 contact print strips. LICALLA film was
originally processed in the Station but in early 1959, due to the resig-
nation of a technician, this. film like that of LIMITED and LILYRIC was

processed on the outside by a recruited. agent.

Mobile surveillance was conducted by two American staff officers.
These two officers organized a surveillance team of six recruited agents
which used late model cars and a panel truck for surveillance. The team
could be activated by radio from the LIMITED site whenever someone of
interest left the gate of the Soviet Embassy. These agents were aware of

the LIMITED site since they had been issued LIMITED photographs for

identification purposes.

The Station also conducted a unilateral a operation,

an American technician inside the listening post.

disconnected all of the unilateral taps on these Embassies so

that they would not be disc the Mexicans hooked up their

taps. The Mexicans aC ‘ter connected five Cuban Tines, five
Soviet lines, three Czech lines, two Polish lines, and one Yugoslav
line. At the. listening post, a live monitor made short summaries of
conversations of interest which were then included in a daily. resume
for the Chief of Station. Later, when a reel was completely recorded,
full transcripts were typed and passed to the Station; however, there

was usually a time lag of a day or two. Reels which contained Russian

At 1626 hours, A Soviet calls from the Soviet Embassy Chancery
to the Cuban Consulate and asks for Sylvia DURAN. He asks

DURAN if the american has been there.

DURAN: Yes, he is still here.

SOVIET: According to the letters that he showed them from the (Soviet)
Consulate in Washington, he wants’ to go to the USSR to stay
a long time with his wife who is Russian, but also the
answer had not been received (by him) regarding his problem.
That accordingly these transactions take 4 or 5 months but
without prior approval from the USSR, they have to request
and even then, they could not issue the visa heze(in Mexico
City) without asking Washington. Yet accordingly * this man
(the American) ,““: showed him a letter imwhich-he’(the
American) is a menber of an organizatigh' in favor of Cuba
and said that the Cubans could not ‘the visa without
the Russian visa and now the Soytiet loesn't know what to do
with him, because he has r’the answer from
Washington. ave \

DURAN: ..with them also, be oblem with hin (the American)

is that he doesnt (SAriyone in Cuba and in that case it
is very sgh Wve him a visa, because he was

thinking of sing his visa, because he knew it was
going to take Wong time waiting for the Russian visa in
Cuba, and then go on to the USSR.

SOVIET: ...that the thing is that if his (the American) wife were

~" “how in Washington (and) going to receive the visa right now

or the permission from the USSR to return to her country, (if)
she is going to receive her visa in Washington, then having
this visa, she can commmicate to whatever place, this
permission, for example, here or in any other place (he) can
receive it, but right now they do not have them.

DURAN: ..certainly and neither can (the Cubans) give him a letter
because they do not know if the visa will be approved.

SOVIET: They can only give the visa according to instructions.

DURAN: Then that is what she will put on his application.

SOVIET: Neither can I give him any letter of recommendation because
I don't know him and pardon me for bothering you.

DURAN: It was no bother, thank you very much.

An unidentified man (speaking Spanish) calls the Soviet Embassy

the Consul is not there. The unidentified man asked what is needed
to get visas to go to Odessa. He is told to call back at 1130 hours.

Item 137, page 2

At 1235 hours 4 man named ALATRISTE (not a Soviet) from inside the
Soviet Embassy Consulate calls out to number 45-37-72 (Colonial
America, probably a pension or hotel but number not listed in the
telephone directory) and speaks with a man named SAN ROMAN.
ALATRISTE says that he is in the Russian Embassy and they need to
Imow what day the boat "KALONIA" will arrive in Odessa, that the
Soviets will also need copies of the passenger manifest...

(One concludes that ALATRISTE and SAN ROMAN are shipping: tepresentatives

Just after 1600 hours, ‘the Soviet Consulate received a call from the
Cuban Consulate (Sylvia DURAN) who said she had there a U.S. citizen
who had requested a transit visa to Cuba because he is going to the
USSR. DURAN wants to know with whom he spoke at the Soviet Embassy
because she sent him over to them telling him that if the Soviets
approved the visa then the Cubans would give him one without anything
more, advising the (Department of) Immigration in Cuba. She wants
to know with whom he spoke because he says that le doesn't know
either with what person and who told him that certainly there would
be no problem.’ The Soviet asks DURAN to wait a minute. After a
short wait DURAN explains the same thing to another Soviet. This
Soviet tells her to leave her telephone (number) and her.name and
someone will return the call. DURAN gives her name and telephone
number 11-28-47 then says as a personal thing, she has moved and
has not advised them of a change of address so will not receive their
Bulletin and can give it to them now. The Soviet asks her to call

in order to change that address and asks for the name
of the (Cuban) Cultural Attache. DURAN says it is Teresa PROENZA
whose number is 14-13-26. The Soviet thanks her.

AND THEN LEAVE LATERe ALTHOUGH IT APPEARS THAT HE WAS THEN THINKING
ONLY ABOUT A PEACEFUL CHANGE OF RESIDENCE TO THE SOVIET UNION,

IT IS ALSO POSSIBLE THAT HE WAS GETTING DOCUMENTED TO MAKE A QUICK

CIA Withheld Vital Intelligence From WwW

By ROBERT S, ALLEN’
And PAUL SCOTT

WASHINGTON, Oct, 20.
—The Central Intelli-
gence Agency withheld
Vital intelligence infor-
mation from the Warren
Commission during its in-
vestigation of the assas-
sination. of President
Kennedy.

Despite the commis
sion’s written request. for
all documents that might
shed light on the assas-
sination, CIA authorities
failed to turn over a na-
tional intelligence esti.
mate warning that it is
Kremlin policy to remove
from public office by as

sassination Western offi-

clals who actively oppose
“Soviet policies.

Titled “Soviet Strategic
Executive Action,” the
Suppressed CIA’ docu-
ment went into the shock-
ing details of how agents
of KGB, the Soviet secret
police, are trained to do
‘away with Western lead-
ets, including officials in
the U.S.. and to make
their deaths appear due
to natural causes,

‘One-of the KGB's new.
ly devised assassination
‘wapons: is "a. pnumati-
cally: operated poison ice
‘atomizer,’- which leaves
no wound or other ‘ede
denée of the cause of-
death.”

: 1, This refers to your letter of February 12, 1964
addressed to the Director of Gentral Intelligence which has
been passed to me for reply,

2, Paragraph three of your letter requested the Agency
to supply the Commission with a report on information in the
Agency's possession regarding Lee Harvey CSWALD oriar to
November 22, 1963, The request was predicated upon the
footnote on page two of CIA's report to the Commission dated
31 January 1964, entitled: Information Developed by CIA on
the Activity of Lee Harvey OSWALD in Mexico City, 23 Sep-
tember = 3 October 1963",

3, There is attached an exact reproduction of the i
Agency's official dossier on Lee Harvey OSWALD beginning
with the opening sheet dated 9 December 1960, The entire
dossier carries the security classification of Secret and
consists of thirty documents arranged in chronological order.
On the basis of clearances from the Federal Bureau of
Investigation, the Department of State, the Department of
Navy, and the Immigration and Naturalization Service, who
were queried by us after the receipt of your letter, we are
able to make available exact copies of all materials in the
file up to early October 1963, These include:

which covers all substantive developments affecting CIA
in the matter of Lee Harvey OSWALD from 9 October to
22 November 1963, The report indicated the disseminations
of information developed by GIA that were made to other
Federal agenctes during that period. This item, as was
pointed out at the time, is particularly sensitive ani bears
appropriate sensitivity indicators.

markings required for CIA's internal records processing, A
few of the papers contained the names of our employees or

Dear Dicks

Our efforts to answer recent informal inquiries, including some
‘from the White: House Staff, have revealed that, though CIA and the
FEL have detailed records concerning Americans who have been recruited
a intelligence agents by Bloc countries, there does not appear to be
a complete listing of those Americans now living in Bloc countries
who might be called "defectors". Using the definitions of DCID h/2,
these porsons might be described as those who have either been
capable of providing useful intelligence to the Bloc or those whose
desire to resettle in Bloc countries has been significantly exploited
for communist propaganda purposes. This would mean that no attention
need be paid to Americans whose resettlement within the Bloc had no
counter-intelligence implications or had attracted no particular‘
attention; for instance, this definition would not cover individual ; nS
US citizens of East European or Chinese origin who retumed to the ".

"homeland" because they had never been completely assimilated into oe
the American society. ra

There is attached a list of such persons, covering the last 18
"months, and it would be appreciated if the Agency could verify and
‘2 |. possibly expend this list for the use of interested Bureaus of. ‘the

* Department. d

» Papich: On questions A, B, C, D - he was not questioned on any of those.

ak

We have been told the police-divin' t ‘axi

ond vith the time giant sy upto thet ve questioned why the assassinatioa

we finally got access to hin

and such, so thosa\

authority to move in wel peaay so those questions were not covered.

With regard to E - ties, Paine, etc., we are working on that.

_F - we have some information for you on that indicating communication
between him and the Embassy up there.

‘me vite is being interrogated. I don't imow if that took place yesterd:
or is still going on. You are getting e teletype answer on that. I am

Just giving you e preview.

With regard to that, Nicaraguan‘, allegations that the man was in the
Cuban Embassy on 18 September, I undérstand we do have information that
he applied for a tourist card about the 15th of September. There is a
record showing entry into Mexico on September 26. On about the 15th he
applied in Nev Orleans for a tourist caf. We do know he was in -

I may even have some later inf, wii Joh came in during the night -

st Sing

Ys
He was last seen by the me . Now we have immigration records shoving him

entering Mexico'on the 26th which very strongly suggests that he was not in Mexico
on the 18th. What we are trying to find out is where he was every single day =
the 25th, 2lith, and all the way back. I think the Nicaraguan story is fabricated
