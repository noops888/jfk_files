Because of the status in the rackets of all
three men, the Newark Office was requested to ascertala
- the whereabouts of these individuals and possible acquain-
{ tances met while in the Atlantic City area. Subsequent ,
: + investigation by -tthe.Newark Division failed to reflect any :
} { indication that LA ROCCA and his associates were staying

|, @ity.

: The Miami Division, after conducting weekly’:
,; checks of the LA ROCCA residence, at 2073 South East i5th
4} Court, Bel Aire, Fla., indicated to the Pittsburgh Division
ion September 23, 1964, that this residence was not
‘occupied during the entire summer of 1964.

On September 17, 1964, PG T-4 furnished the
following information:

LA ROCCA remains in the Pittsburgh-Ingomar, Pa.,
area and has not engaged-in any extensive travel ‘since t
his return home from Bel Aire, Fla., during the second: nee
week of April, 1964. His former daughter-in-law,
PATRICIA, is again using the name PAT FESSLER and has been
employed for a little more than a year at Zayres Department
Store on McKnight Road as a salesgirl. She works from
9 AM to 6 PM daily. The FESSLERs see the elder LA ROCCAs
quite often and allow the LA ROCCAs to take care of PAT's
baby almost every weekend. Both Mr. and Mrs. LA ROCCA
are extremely proud of their only grandson and-see to it
that he wants for nothing.

PAT FESSLER is very unhappy with her present
circumstances but can do nothing to elevate them or obtain
greater financial security. She has heard that her former
husband, the adopted son of SEBASTIAN JOHN LA ROCCA, has
remarried against the wishes pt his parents and is now
working instead of attending 4he University of Miami, where
he had been accepted for the semester beginning in September,
1964. His plans to further his education may have under-
gone a change, much to his father's disgust. This is avery
recent rumor and could not be verified by other sources :
available to this informant. The LA ROCCAs are very =
close-mouthed about personal affairs and do not even
mention young JOHN when they visit the FESSLER residence
to pick up their grandson.
