Because of the status

in the rackets of all "

three men, the Newark Office was requested to ascertain

the whereabouts of these individuals and possible acquain-

tances met while in the Atlantic City area.

Subsequent

investigation by the Newark Division failed to reflect any

indication that LA ROCCA and his associates were staying

in any of the motels close to the boardwalk at Atlantie

city.

The Miami Division, after conducting weekly

checks of the LA ROCCA residence, at 2073 South East 15th

i Court, Bel Aire, Fla., indicated to the Pittsburgh Division

on September 23, 1964, that this residence was not

occupied during the entire summer of 1964.

On September 17, 1964, PG I-4 furnished the

following information:

LA ROCCA remains in the Pittsburgh-Ingomar, pa.;

area and has not engaged in any extensive travel since

his return home from Bel Aire, Fla., during the second

week of April, 1964.

His former daughter-in-law,

PATRICIA, 1s again using the name PAT FESSLER and has been

employed

for a little more than a year at Zayres Department

Store on McKnight Road as a salesgirl. She works from

9 AM to 6 PM daily.

the elder. LA ROCCAs

quite often and allow the LA ROCCAs to take care of PAT's

baby almost every weekend.

Both Mr. and Mrs. LA ROCCA

are extremely proud of their only grandson and see to it

that he wants for nothing.

PAT FESSLER is very unhappy with her present

circumstances but can do nothing to elevate them or obtain

greater tinanciad security.

She has heard that her former

husband,

the adopted son of SEBASTIAN JOHN LA ROCCA, has

remarried against the wishes of his parents and is now

working instead of attending the University of Miami, where

he had been accepted for the semester beginning in September,

1964. His plans to further his education may have under-

gone a change, much to his father's disgust.

This is a very

recent rumor and could not be verified by other sources

available to this informant. The LA ROCCAs are very

close-mouthed about personal affairs and do not even

to pick up their grandson.
