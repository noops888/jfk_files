1.

story linking Clay Sha

New Orleans for his alleged part in a Kennedy assassination

conspiracy, with Centro Mondiale Connerciale (CHC) in Rose.

The story mentions four other persons as having been in-

volved with CHC:

Carlo D'AMELIO, a lawyer and' former

president of CMC; Ferenc NAGY,

former Prime Minister oi

Hungary; Henrich MANDEL-MANTELLO, president of the Italo-

American Hotel Corporation, who was managing director of

CMC; and George MANDEL, father of Henrich MANDEL-MANTELLO

founder of CMC.

A copy of the Il Messaggero story was

forwarded with the reference memorandum.

Carlo appears to be identical with the

Rome lawyer Carlo

D'AMELTO, D'AMELIO listed on page 464 of the 1956

edition of Panorama Bibliografico degli Italiani D'Oggi.

According to Panorama,

D'AMELIO was born in May of 1902 in

ts a lawyer

and publicist, represented the Savoy

(Italian royal family) heirs' claims, and was King Farouk's

The Il Messaggero story noted above states that

D'AMELIO was the lawyer and administrator of the estates of

OIR-605, 15 January 1953, mentions a

fnu D'AMELIO, a lawyer for ex-King Farouk of Egypt.

J01S, 28 April 1955, mentions a lawyer, Carlo AMELIO. This

document cannot be located and no further information 1s

available.

It seems likely that all the above are identical

with the Carlo D'AMELIO of CMC.
