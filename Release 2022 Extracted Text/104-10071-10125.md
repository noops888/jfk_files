Any action in furtharanco of the

discusaions describeri in the memorandum would necossarily be taken by the

local ODACID establishment.

2.

No plans are presantly known for extending ONACID support to Subjoct; hor

ovor, is any such support vere to be given by private parsons (such as

Secrotary ARANETA) thie probably would not becana known to ODYOKE circles.
