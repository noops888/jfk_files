1, Attached are tuo copies of a menerandum for the record on the Subject of a
contect votgee? Robert F. CHATHAM and "Professor LAURA" to when reference was
nado in both GMANIDIE39 and DIR-39952. Thio cortact was made at tho requast
of the deputy chief to HIDWATCH. A sanitised copy of the renorandun has
been transaitted to the MIINATCH officoe Any action in furthorarce of the
diacasoions describes in the memorandum would necossarily be taken by the
lecol ODACID eatablishment.

2. No plans are presently known for extending ORACID support to Subject; hov=
ever, if any euch support were to be given by private persons (such as
Socrotary ARANETA) thie probably would not becaas known to ODYOXE circlese

3. It appeared from his remarks that Subject had not ‘contacted KUBARK channols
in tho coureo of his curront Asian tour -- either in India or Indechinie
Discroet questioning revealed that the 2 March meeting under ARANBTA‘S
eponsorehip vas evidently Subjoct's first direct appeal, in ths course of
bio current tour, to ODYOKE far assistance. Howover, Subject may havo been
withholding datails of othor contacts with ODYOKE represontativeas This
would appear a volid assumption in view af the fact that ho denied (in
response to a question) that he had contacted ODZOE representatives recontq-
ly in Hong Kong (per paragraph five of GHAND-9539)

4. | With reference to the potontial for KUBARK purposes of Subject's organisation,
4% became manifestly apparent in the course of his remarka that no cohesive
vehicle exists for the purposes he described (however laudatory his purposes,
porticularly in tho Hanoi-Haiphong arcas)s that Subject hao given only
LAmited attontion to the types of materials to be disseminated by his
"friends"; and that Subject appeared to bo far too unsyoteaatie to be

| omtruated with anything but, tho finighed product in quantity (rather than
funds to arrange for ite publication).

NMEMORANDUN FOR THE BECORD:
SUBJECT: Heueting with (Greteon}aumt

On tho evening of 2 March 1955, CHATHAM proceeded to the apartment of Agriculture
SalvadGryzeRNETA with a neaber of the OLACID political section and an

ODCHOP etaff member. in brief conversation with the ODCHOP officer prior to

reaching the ARANETA hone, CHATHAN explained that he hed beon instructed not to

epsoifically identify hinsclf as anything but OLACID (that is, not to claim

USIA connections‘; and that soxething was known of tho “Professor's”

activities elosvhere, which though apparently well intentioned, were subject to

cae question from the OLYOKE policy viewpointe The ODCHOP officer explained

that his only interest was in complying with tho wishes of ARANETA (with whom

he had close liaison relationship which he di. not wish to jeopardise in any way)

that he bring scus representative of OIACIL by to meet hie guest.

We wore ushered into tho ARANETA penthouse at 6115 p.m. and vere immediately
groated by ARANETA hinself and hio wifo who ovidently bad been conversing on
