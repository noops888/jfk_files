RI: Tracing continuing:

The following additional information has been corained since

reference:

The New Orleans States-lem of 3 March 1967 stated that

Now York radio station WINS said thit it had Irarred from reliable

sources that GARRISON belieres that Presidont Kunnedy Mas

assassinated by "a group of ploiters directed iron Ceba." WINS

reporter Doug Edelson said that the source has access to GARRISON's

files and that, according to the files, "after an aberrive CLA invision

of Cuba, Castro put out an esecution order on do President.!

A memorandum of l May 1967 by Mr. Sichard H.

Lansdale, Associate General Counsel, advises that GARRISON

"intends to demand that ClI furnish him with the photograph of Oswald

entering or exiting the Mexico City Embassy."

c.

James Phelan is the author of the lead article in the

Saturday Evening Post of 6 May 1967, headed "s Plat to Kill Hennedy?

Rush to Judgment in New Orleans": The folloira try points chiefly

concern GARRISON:

(1) Pholan knew GARRISON in 1903, when he spent

ton days with him, obtaining matérial for a laudarory piece

called, "The Vice Man Cometh".

(2)

GARRISON and Phelan met in Las Vegas on 5 and

6. March 1907, and Prolan condueted ten tours ol irierview's.

GARRISON gave Plician a memorandum di as interriew con-

ducted with Perry RUSSO by Andrew J. SCLIVARd, "a 3l-ycar-

old assistant D.A, just a year out of law sebool" who interviesed

RUSSO for three hours and luo copious ries; GARRISOV also

gave Pholan a transcrip: of what RUSSO said four days later, on

1 March 1967, while under hypnosis. The Scaldinäd report

---

## Page 14

made do mention of a plot among OSTENLD, FERnie, and

SIAN 1o Kill suyones The 3, 500-word report also made no

reference to a party a FAkkials apariant.

It did not

contain a positive identification of Lec Harvey OSWMaD as

"Lion OSWALD. Shown a picture of Clay Sitaw, Russo had

not entitie him BERTRAND The SCLAMORA report

specitied shut russo hind seen Sill only twice it did not

Bay that SilW knew OSWNLD.

(3) On 27 February 1267, according to a second

SCIAMINA report, RUSSO was given sodium pontothal and

then "did make passing reference to the porty he which the

plot was discussed", but did so only after prompting by

SCIAMIRA, Who wrote, "I then asked hun if he could remem-

ber any of the details about Clay Bertrand being up in FERRIE!

apartmicnt."

(1) Two days later Dr. Esmond FATTER placed

RUSSO under hypnosis (he diel so three times in all). When

RUSSO made no mention of a party or plut, FATTER directed

him lo see "a picturr of FEllIEs apartment and there are

several people in there and there is a white-haired man, Tell

me about it." RUSSO complied but made no mention of SIlAl,

"BERTRAND", or a plot, FATTER the ordered hin to see

this pictures "There will be Bortrand, Ferrie and Oswald and

they are going to discuss a very important matter and there is

another man and girl there and they are talking about assassina-

ting somcbody. Look at it and describe it to me." RUSSO

then told the story that he subsequently gate in testimony.

(5)

Phelan advised GARRISON of the profound differences

between the first SCIAMBRA report and tie crchtuil RUSSO

testimony: GARKISON perinited Phelan lu question SCLAMBRA

direclly, in GARKISON's presence. SCLAMBRA said that he

must have forgolen lo include the party and its participants.

When Philan suggested consulting his original notes, SCLANBRA

said that he had burned them. Phelan asked Dr. FATTER

where he got the information used in questioning RUSSO under

hypnosis, and FATTER said it came from GARRISON's office.

the date of references

The following additional information has bech obtained since.

The New Orleans Times Picayuns of l9 April 1967 states

that Gordon Duane NOVEL (sce Enclosure 19 of reference), dien living

in Columbus, Olie, was the subicet of extradition charges signed

17 April 1967 by Noting Governor C.C. Nycock. The charges concern

conspiracy to burglarice the munitions bunker at Houng, Logisiana,

in 1961. On 18 April 1967 NOvEl stated in an article copyrighted by

the Dallas Daily News that GARRISON is conducting his probic to

further his political carcer.

"The whole GARRISON investigation

ching is fiction, " NOVEL added.

"I know the full story from working

as the prosscutor's security chief." GARRISON, however, has said

that NOVEL never worked fos him. NOVEL added, "I think GARRI-

SON will expose some CLA operations in Louisiana."

b.

The Now Orleans States Item of 25 April 1967 stares that

NOVEL, "has told a numbor of triends and intimates he was a ClA

operative and will use this role to battle GARRISON's charges

if he is returned to Now Orleans to face accusations that he burglarized

an oil scrvice company's munitions bunker in acarby Terrobone:

Parish." Steven PLOTKIN, alorhey for NOVEL, refused to confirm

or deny his client's statements. Sergio ARCACHA Smith (sce Fn-

closure ? of reference) is also accused by GARRISON of helping to

plan the theft of the munitions.

The article adds, "To fricnds and

associates, NOVEL has said that the munitions burglary was no

burglary at all -- but a war materials pickup made at the direction

of his CIA contacr." lie has described the Houma bunker as a Ch

cache for munitions destired for lise in the April 19ul invasion at the

Bay of Pigs. NOVEl, has claimed that he workre for ClA in New

Orleans before April 1961. "Part of his job, de contends, was to

operate the Evergreen Advertising Agency as a front for CLI

communications. With funds funneled to him by the CIA, NOVEL

Their cryptographic messages, he clains,

were to nlert agents to the invasion date.

The commercials advers

tised Alummum Christmas treese he says. and the key alcrt codc

namcs vere (Star Christmas Trces! and Holiday Trecs'. In latc

1960, $72,000 vurth of radio time was placed by the agency. On the

day the mumcions were to be picked up, he says, ho was called by his

Cl contact and told to join a group which was ordered to transport

munitions from the bunker to New Orleans.

He says he mado

the trip lu his own Automobile, a Lincoln, and met several people

there to all of them allagedly acting for the CIA. He identifics

them as FARKIE, ARCACIA, several Cubins, and anothet figure in

the case.

They loaded the boxes of ordnance on trucks, he continues,

and returned to Now Orleans here the explosives were dropped in

Urce spots -- FERRIE's home, NOVEL's office building, and the

office of. . former FRl agent Guy BANISTER\see Enclosure

3 of referenco) NOVIl claims the munitions were centually taken

ky bout to Cuba for a diversionary Bay of Pigs opcration. GARRISON,

however, says the burglary occurred three months after the Bay of

Pigs. He adds that the Houma bunker was leased by the Schlumberger

Well Services Co. of Houston, Texas. "Schlumberger officials say

they know nothing of any CIA operations in connection with their

magazine, whore oil field service equipment and certain low-yield

explosives

are storcd."

An AP wire dispatch of 26 April 1967 from New Orleans

"In Columbus, NOVEL said today that 'the statements that !

worked for the CIA are absolutely incorrect... The cvents of

1961, the Bay of Pigs invasion; arc none of anybody's business,

including Mr. GARRISON's. '"

RI has no record of the Evergreen Advertising Agency. There

is, howeyer, a record of "Evergreen Enterprisc," listed as "cover for

illogal activities".

The pertinent document will be obtained and studied.

The SCHLUMBERGER Wcll Surveying

Corporation

There are extensive CIA traces on this company and on

various persons connected with it, but none of this information is

pertinent to the GARRISON investigation.

A report of 20 April 1967 from the New Orlans office

of the FBi states that a confidentin source who is a representative

of a well-known news media said on 20 April that Gordon NOVEL

has reportedly stated that he was employed by GIA and that the

Houma burglary was not an actual burglary. He contended that ClA

had an arrangement with the SCHLUMBERGEK Co. (see bolow) lo

keep ammunition, bomb casings, and other material in the bunkery

cased by SCHLUMBERGER. He said that he and Sergio ARCACHA

Smith were still employed by CIA.

"The source advised that accord-

ing to inforration developed to date Schlumberger became upset

over the Bay of Pigs invasion and wanted to get out of their contract

with the CIA. Arrangements were made about three months after

the... invasion for the...material...lo be taken out by Novel and his

group. "

The Domestic Contact Service (DCS) informed CI/R&A

on 27 April 1 967 that the New Orlens office of the SCHLUMBEIGER

Well Surveying Corporation is a branch of the main office in Houston,

Texas. The company, however, is French-owned. The DCS uffice

in New Orleans was in touch with Charles A. DOH, district manager

of the Ncw Oricans SCHLUMBEKGEK office, in order to interview him

about a business trip to Kome in June 1955. There has been no subse- .

quent contact. However, the DCS has been and still is in touch with

with the firm have been circumspect.

The Office of Security also advised on 27 April 1967 that

questioning of four employees of the Office of Logistics has shown

that the only arms bunker in the New Orleans area used by ClA was

the Belle Chasse Ammunition Depot, a deactivated Navy installation

eight miles from New Oricans. There is no present rcason to belicve

that the Agency has been associated in any way with the Houma Air
