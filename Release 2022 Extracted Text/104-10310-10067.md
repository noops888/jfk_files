MEMORANDUM FOR: Inspector General

SUBJECT

: Oswald Flight Inquiry by Time Magazine

grapholos.

Hayes Gorey of Time is writing a piece on Oswald.

He finds in the Warren Commission report a letter

from Helms to Rep. Rankin. . It is exhibit 2774, The letter

but that the Agency will dig still further to clarify this

carly.

This has to do with the passage of Oswald from London

to the Soviet Union, I gather.

Mr. Gorey's query is:

Was the digging done? What did it show?

Is there anything we can do to help Mr. Gorey.
