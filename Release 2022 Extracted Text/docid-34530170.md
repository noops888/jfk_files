‘ “Ramparts' big guns - editor Robert Scheer and
art director Dugald Stermer, a kind of genius -
have resigned from that troubled magazine.
They're in New York, living in Arthur Miller's
digs at the old Chelsea Hotel while making
lucrative contacts as free-lance consultants.
(Arthur? He's out of town). Night before last,
Scheer, terrible-tempered as ever, ran into his
old associate, Warren Hinckle, and Sid zion of
the 'New York Times" in a chic midtown eating
place and whapped Zion over the head with a
load of pumpernickel. Put that on my tab."

As set out later in this report under finances,
SCHEER is presently deriving his income from his writings
and from speaking engagements.

ROBERT SCHEER had stayed at the Chelsea Hotel,

stepped off a plane from Algiers this week (he was over
there with Cleaver) and was immediately slapped with a
Federal Grand dury subpoena to testify on the Black

that he had no records of the “defunct Cleaver Defense

meaning he can be recalled at some future time. SCHEER
was quoted in the article as saying that keeping him
under la subpoena was "a continuation of the process of
harrassment. It prevents me from working as a journalist.

Unbelieving, the judge asked Hyland to

F. Speeches

The "Oregon Journal" newspaper, Portland, Oregon,
in its issue of April 4, 1969, carried a news article
headlined, “Left, Right Argue at UO Conference", This
article related that on March 28, 1969, the 22nd annual
Conference of the Oregon State High School International
Relations League held a meeting at the University of
Oregon (UO), Eugene, Oregon, delivered by Dr. S. I. HAYAKAWA,
President of San Francisco State College, San Francisco,
California, who debated with ROBERT SHEER, editor in chief
of "Ramparts" magazine. The article stated SHEER condemned
the American way of life, criticizing corporations, the
press, universities and most elements of 20th century
culture. It added that ELDRIDGE CLEAVER, the Black Panther
who was removed from the UC faculty, was one of America's
best and most important writers. SHEER reportedly
criticized the public for its indifference to this action
by the university. It stated SHEER advised high school
students that "to be involved in your little high school
group here is going to turn you into finks, believe me."
The article concluded by stating, "SHEER called for a
‘re-establishment of democracy', claiming that it will
demand a smashing of the power of corporations, having a
free press, having access at the universities to different
ideas and giving the universities back to the students."

About May 1, 1969, there was a joint session of
Kingswood School for Girls and Cranbrook School for Boys,
each a part of Cranbrook Institutions, Bloomfield Hills,
Michigan, revolving around an annual World Affairs Seminar,

NW 64954 Docld:34530170 Page 14

featuring six speakers, one of whom was ROBERT SCHEER. The
topic this year was student disturbances. No publicity
whatever is allowed eoncerning these seminars either at

the schools or in the public press and no such publicity
was had. SCHEER's appearance at the seminar was without
incident.

SF T-13, 9/24/69

The "Columbia Missourian" newspaper, published at
Columbia, Missouri, in its.issue of September 24, 1969,
carried a news article announcing that "Robert Scheer,
Editor-in-Chief of the magazine 'Ramparts'" would apeak at the
University of Missouri, Jesse Auditorium, Columbia, Missouri,
on the evening of September 24, 1969, on the topic, "Free
Speech - Free Press". This meeting was under sponsorship of
the "Student Activities Concept of Education" and was opened
to students, faculty and staff.

The "Columbia Missourian" issue of September 25,
1969, carried a news article headlined "'Ramparts' Editor,
Audience Postponed Closing of Jesse", which reported on
the meeting described above. The article stated that with
more than 300 people attending this meeting, the scheduled
11:00 PM closing time was postponed to 11:30 PM, after
ROBERT SCHEER asked the audience for a show of hands on
continuing the discussion, and the vote was almost unanimous
in favor of continuing. The meeting continued at "The
Chez", 100 Hitt Street, Columbia, after 11:30 PM, with
about 200 people in attendance. The article stated SCHEER
urged those present to act against "society". SCHEER said
the "movement" was simply asking for a fundamental change
in this country. "All the rest of the country regards this
as bizarre, and a detriment to the society and thussit is
repressed, but it is necessary if the United States is to
continue its role in the world". SCHEER added that as the
American public began to see that the historical role of
America as a "do gooder" was not true, they began to
question the basic democratic system. As they moved to straighten
out the government, they began to challenge this system and
were repressed, he said. SCHEER added that the channels
which professed to be open to all, suddenly began to close
as exemplified by the college revolutions of the 1960's
and civil rights movement.

Regarding the free press, the article continued
by stating SCHEER said "Ramparts" was not read by many :
persons because they lacked the funds. He stated that even
if a magazine had the money and the advertisers, it was
almost impossible to get into the competitive market. He
said, "Sure, you can sell on the street corner and speak on
campuses, but how many people do you reach that way? Free
speech doesn't mean anything unless you are on TV or in
the movies. That's the only speech the people are digging;
that's why we have to force the TV cameras to focus on us".
SCHEER continued by saying, "People in Missouri have never
tried action so they don't really know what America is all
about. Democracy is alive and well if you've never tried
it. Try it and you will see how badly it needs changing.
You have to be part of the solution and not the problem.
You've got to be creative and imaginative and militant
you can't cop out. I'm sorry, but that's the way it is

The "Post Tribune" newspaper, published at
Jefferson City, Missouri, in its issue of September 25,
1969, carried a news article headlined, "Speaker Incites
Student Rule Defiance". This article also described the
meeting at the University of Missouri of September 24,
‘1969, It estimated the attendance at 700 to 800 persons.
This article stated the meeting was scheduled for 8:00 PM,
but actually began at 9:15 PM, due to the late arrival by
plane’ of ROBERT SCHEER. In addition to mentioning SCHEER's
remarks about repression of the New Left, it reported an
interview of a third year law student, ROBERT NUSSBAUMER,
who said he had attended the meeting and had questioned
ROBERT SCHEER about objectives of the New Left, but failed
to receive an answer. NUSSBAUMER said that the same
people who have an undying commitment to free speech shouted
him down when he tried to point out to the audience that the
Missouri University Administration, which was responsible
for the 11:00 PM closing hour, also had a responsibility to
the people of Missouri. The article said that ROBERT SCHEER
incited a group of students from the University of Missouri
to violate the 11:00 PM closing time of Jesse Auditorium,
where he was speaking.

BLACK PANTHER PARTY, aka
Black Panther Party for
Self Defense

According to its official newspaper, the Black Panther
Party (BPP) was started during December, 1966, in Oakland,
California, to organize black people so they can take control
of the life, polities, and the destiny of the black community.
It was organized by Bobby George Seale, BPP Chairman, and
Huey P. Newton, BPP Minister of Defense. Newton is presently
serving a sentence of 2 to 15 years on a conviction of manslaughter
in connection with the killing of an Oakland police officer.

The official newspaper, "The Black Panther," which
further describes itself as the "Black Community News Service,"
states that the BPP advocates the use of guns and guerrilla
tactics in its revolutionary program to end oppression of the
black people. Residents of the black community are urged to
arm themselves against the police who are consistently referred
to in the publication as "pigs" who should be killed.

"The Black Panther" issue of September 7, 1968, contains
an editorial by BPP Minister of Education, George Mason Murray,

PEVOLUTLONAPY UNTON,
ALSO XNOWN AS

PED UNION, BAY AREA
REVOLUTIONARY UNION

In September, 1968, a source advised that the
Revolutionary Union, commonly known to its membership as
the Red Union (RU), was formed in early 1968 as a covert,
revolutionary, Marxist-Leninist organization ideologically
oriented toward Communist China, which it views as the
model of the correct revolutionary Marxist-Leninist line as
developed through MAO Tse-tung. The PU advocates the necessity
of violent revolution and open guerrilla warfare to overthrow
the ‘existing political system in the United States and effect
radical changes in this nation, and some members are collecting
firearms, explosives, and other weapons and have engaged in
guerrilla warfare and firearms training. In the San Francisco
Bay Area, the RU consists of three locals, one each in San
Francisco, the East Bay, and the Peninsula.

In April, 1969, a second source advised that the RU
partially surfaced during that month through advertisements in
select "New Left" periodicals, identifying three members of the
Executive Committee as public spokesmen and offering for sale
select writings of the RU, including a "Statement of Principles,"
in the form of "The Red Papers." With the exception of the three
publicly identified spokesmen, the general membership of the RU
will remain covert; however, individual members are free to reveal
their RU membership to close political associates as the necessities
of political effectiveness dictate.

The RU's published "Statement of Principles" calls for
the smashine of the existing state apparatus by the United States
working class and the establishment of communism and the dictatorship
of the proletariat; recognizes the necessity of violent revolution
and organized armed struggle to achieve those ends and calls for
the creation of a revolutionary party based upon Marxism-Leninism
as developed through MAO Tse-tung.

STUDENTS FOR A DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY

A source has advised that the Students For A
Democratic Society (SDS), as it is known today, came into
being at a founding convention held at Port Huron, Michigan,’
in June, 1962. From an initial ideological posture of
“participatory democracy," the current line of the national
leadership reveals an adherence to Marxism-Leninism. MICHAEL
KLONSKY, National Secretary, in March, 1969, called for the
building of a revolutionary Marxist-Leninist movement, The
Program of SDS has moved from involvement in civil rights
struggles to an anti-Vietnam war position and finally to
its present advocacy of an anti-imperialist line, linking
up the oppressed peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America
with the black liberation movement in the United States.
China, Vietnam, and Cuba are regarded as countries which
are leading the world-wide struggles against United States
imperialism. On the other hand, SDS regards the Soviet Union
as an imperialist power and does not support the policies of
that country.

SDS maintains a National Office in Room 206, 1608
West Madison Street, Chicago, Illinois. Its official paper
"New Left Notes" reflects the line of the national leadership
and program adopted at meetings of the National Council and
National Interim Committee (NIC). Three national officers and
a NIC of eleven members are elected each year during a June
National Convention.

SDS Regional Offices and university and college chapters
elect delegates to National Council meetings wherein program and
ideology are debated, but each Region and chapter is autonomous
in nature and is free to carry out independent policy and programs
reflective of local conditions.
