This

article related that on March 28, 1969, the 22nd annual

Conference of the Oregon State High School International

Relations League held a meeting at the University of

Oregon (UO), Eugene, Oregon, delivered by DI. S. I. HAYAKAWA,

resident of san francisco State College, San Francisco,

california, who debated with ROBERT SHEER, editor in chief

of

"Ramparts" magazine.

The article stated SHEER condemned

the American way

of life, criticizing corporations, the

press, universities and most elements of 20th century

culture.

It added that ELDRIDGE CLEAVER, the Black Panther

who was removed from the UC faculty, was one of America's

best and most important writers.

SHEER reportedly

criticized the public for its indifference to this action

by the university.

It stated SHEER advised high school

students that "to be involved in your little high school

group here is going to turn you into finks, believe me."

The article concluded by stating, "SHEER called for a

're-establishment of democracy'

claiming that it will

demand a smashing of the power of corporations, having a

free press,

having access

at the universities to different

ideas and giving the universities back to the students."

About May 1, 1969, there was a joint session of

Kingswood School for Girls and Cranbrook School for Boys,

a news article announcing that "Robert Scheer,

Editor-in-Chief of the magazine

This meeting was under sponsorship of

"Student Activities Concept of Education" and was opened

to students, faculty and staff.

The "Columbia Missourian" issue of September 25,

1969, carried a news article

headlined "'Ramparts' Editor,

, which reported on

the meeting described above.

The article stated that with

ROBERT SCHEER asked the audience for a show of hands on

continuing the discussion, and the vote was almost unanimous

in favor of continuing.

The meeting continued at "The

Chez", 100 Hitt Street, Columbia, after 11:30 PM, with

about 200 people in attendance.

as bizarre, and

a detriment to the society and thus it is

repressed, but it is necessary if the United States is to

continue its role in the world". SCHEER added that as the

American public began to see that the historical role of

America as a

"do gooder"

was not true, they began to

question the basic democratic system.

As they moved to straighten

out the government, they began to challenge this system and

were repressed, he said. SCHEER added that the channels

which professed to be open to all, suddenly began to close

as exemplified by the college revolutions of the 1960's

and civil rights movement.

Regarding the free press, the article continued

by stating SCHEER said "Ramparts" was not read by many

persons because they lacked the funds.

He

stated

that even

if a magazine

had the money and the advertisers, it was

almost

impossible to get into the competitive market.

He

said,

"Sure, you can

sell on the street corner and speak on

campuses, but how many people do you reach that way?

Free

speech doesn't mean anything unless you are on TV or in

the

movies.

That's the only speech the people are digging;

that's why we have to force the TV cameras to focus on us"

SCHEER continued by saying, "People in Missouri have never

action so they don't really know what America is all

about.

Democracy is alive and well if you've never tried

it.

Try it and you will see how badly it needs changing.

You have to be part of the solution and not the problem.

You've got to be creative and imaginative and militant -

you can't cop out.

I'm sorry, but that's the way it is".

The "post Tribune" newspaper, published at

Jefferson City, Missouri, in its issue of September 25,

1969, carried a news article headlined, "Speaker Incites

Student Rule Defiance"

This article also described the

meeting at the University of Missouri of September 24;

1969.

It estimated the attendance at 700 to 800 persons.

This article stated the meeting was scheduled for 8:00 PM,

but actually began at 9:15 PM, due to the late arrival by

plane of ROBERT SCHEER.

In addition to mentioning SCHEER's

remarks about repression of the New Left, it reported an

interview of a third year law student, ROBERT NUSSBAUMER,

who said he had attended the meeting and had questioned

ROBERT SCHEER about objectives of the New Left, but failed

to receive an answer.

NUSSBAUMER said that the same

people who have an undying commitment to free speech shouted

nim down when he tried to point out to the audience that the

Missouri Universty Administration, which was responsible

for the 11:00 PM closing hour, also had a responsibility to

the people of Missouri.

The article said that ROBERT SCHEER

incited a group of students from the University of Missouri

to violate the 11:00 PM closing time of Jesse Auditorium,

where he was speaking.

BLACK PANTHER PARTY, aka

Black Panther Party for

Self Defense

According to its official newspaper, the Black Panther

Party (BPP) was started during December, 1966, in Oakland,

California, to organize black people so they can take control

of the life, politics,

and the destiny of the black community.

It was organized by Bobby George Seale, BPP Chairman, and

Huey P. Newton, BPP Minister of Defense.! Newton is presently

serving a sentence of 2 to 15 years on a conviction of manslaughter

in connection with the killing of an Oakland police officer.

"The Black Panther," which

further describes

The official newspaper "Black Community News Service,"

itself as the

states that the BPP

advocates the use of guns and guerrilla

tactics in its revolutionary program to end oppression of the

black people.

Residents of the black community are urged to

newiden tenor the

arm themselves against the police who are consistently referred

to in the publication as "pigs" who should be killed.

"The Black Panther" issue of September 7, 1968, contains

an editorial by BPP Minister of Education, George Mason Murray,

which ends with the following:

"Black

men. Black people, colored persons of America,

revolt everywhere!

Arm yourselves.

The only culture worth

a revolutionary culture. Change.

Dynamite! Black power. Use the gun, Kill the pigs everywere:

Included in the introduction to an article appearing

in the October 5, 1968, edition of "The Black Panther" is the

statement, "

.. • We

will

not dissent from American Government.

We will overthrow it."

Issues of "The Black Panther" regularly contain quotations

from the writings of Chairman MAO Ise-tung of the People's

Republic of China

and feature MAO's statement that "political

power grows out of the barrel of a gun."

The national headquarters of the BPP is located at

3106 Shattuck Avenue, Berkeley, California. Branches have

been

established at various locations throughout the United

States.

PEVOLUTTONARY UNION,

ALSO KNOWN AS

PED UNION, BAY AREA

REVOLUTINNARY UNION

In September, 1968, a source advised that the

Revolutionary Union, commonly known to its membership as

the Red Union (RU), was formed in early 1968 as a covert,

revolutionary, Marxist-Leninist organization idenlogically

oriented toward Communist China, which

it views as the

model of the correct revolutionary Marxist-Leninist line as

developed through MAO Tse-tung.

The Pll advocates the necessity

of violent revolution

guerrilla warfare to overthrow

the existing political sustem in the United States and effect

radical changes in this nation, and some members are collecting

firearms, explosives, and other weapons and have engaged in

guerrilla warfare and

firearns training.

In the San

Francisco

Bay Area, the RU consists of three locals, one each

in San

Francisco, the East Bay, and the Peninsula.

In April, 1969, a second source advised that the Ru

partially surfaced

during that month through advertisements

in

"New Left" periodicals, identifying

three members of the

Executive Committee as public spokesmen and offering

for sale

select writings of the RU, including a "Statement of Principles,"

in the form of "The Red Papers."

the exception of the three

publicly identified spokesmen, the general membership of the pu

will remain covert; however, individual members are free to reveal

their RU membership to close political associates as the necessities

of political effectiveness dictate.

The RU's published "Statement of Principles" calls for

the smashing of the existing

apparatus by the United States

working class and the establishment of communism and the dictatorship

of the proletariat; recognizes the necessity of violent revolution

and organized armed struggle to achieve those ends and calls for

the creation of a revolutionary darty based upon Marxism-Leninism

as developed

through MAD Tse-tung.

STUDENTS FOR A DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY

A source has advised that the Students For A

Democratic Society (SDS), as it is known today, came into

being at a founding convention held at Port Huron, Michigan,

In June, 1962.

From an initial ideological posture of

"participatory democracy," the current line of the national

leadership reveals an adherence to Marxism-Leninism.

MICHAEL

The

program of SDS has moved from involvement in civil rights

struggles

anti-Vietnam war position and finally to

Its present advocacy of an anti-imperialist line, linking

up the oppressed peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America

with the black liberation movement in the United States.

China, Vietnam, and Cuba are regarded as countries which

are leading the

world-wide struggles against United States

imperialism.

On the other hand, SDS regards the Soviet Union

as

an imperialist power and does not support the policies of

that country.

West

Madison Street, Chicago, Illinois. Its official paper

"New

Left Notes" reflects the line of the national leadership

sos maintainnicaphe line

a National Office in Room 206, 1608

and program adopted at meetings of the National Council and

National Interim Committee (NIC).

Three national officers and

a NIC of eleven

members are elected each year during a June

National Convention.

SDS Regional Offices and university and college chapters

elect delegates to National Council meetings wherein program and

ideology are debated, but each Region and chapter is autonomous

in nature and is free to

carry out independent policy and programs

reflective of local conditions.
