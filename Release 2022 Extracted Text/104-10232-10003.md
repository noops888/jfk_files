MEMORANDUM FOR : Colonel Johnson

1. In your discussion with State and MIRO it might be wise, for

z. Realizing the difficult handling problem you have, I am putting

down my own reactions to some of the parts if your memo, which

may, I hope, be of some assistance.

3.

Regarding your paragraph 2, itom a,

oporations in this area.

operation by this areply Much on had me when they equen la suet

guesses on our assets are very eroneous. Usually, their forays

can be countered by saying we agree that the propaganda "Iines"

should be discussed of they should tell us what they think the "line"

should be and we will con rent if we disagree. In short, we are

willing to covertly try to support them, but we are not obligated to

reveal to Siate of MIRO our specific operationg and personnel,

which should be in a normal situation clandestine. Accordingly,

I would suggest that you encourage the CRC toward diverting some

of the million dollars the White House promised them into forming

a functioning propaganda commission and suggest they then tell us

what they are doing and plan to do, so that if we have assets and

approvals from our people we will be in a position to coordinate

our efforts with theirs.

4. Regarding your paragraph 2, b, these seem in general sound

enough. Tell him. to keep us advised as to what he proposes to do

with his funds in this field. Surely he doesn't feel he is giving us

orders as to what we should do here in our country.

5. Rogarding your paragraph 2,c, you may wlah to romind him

was disrussed. You may tell hiin that we aro as agreed ondeavoring

to provido fundo to tho internal groups which ho indicated should ba

â€¢apportod. Naturally the meana are socrot. I ho has a particular

leader or group inside he wants us to try to support he should tell us.

We could suggoat sume of his million dollara could bo utilized by hin

also for thia purpose,: As to commando action, tho State Dopartment,

which sets policy, has not authorized any commando oporationg of any

kind and we aro accordingly not in a position to organize or support any

for the present.

6. Regarding your paragraph 3 on Commando Action, this plan

is not yet in Headquartera; howover, we havo no policy authorisation

from State for such an operation.

7. Regarding your item 4, you will recall and he will recall, he

took this up with GOODWIN and then with HURWITZ and then with

CLARK and HANLEY. He was unable then to say exactly how or even

I he could develop a commo line to Ramirez much less how he would

get arms to RAMIREZ, or anybody elso by air, and in elther boat or

air operations there would havo to be some assurance that he had the

capability to arrango a reception party. in Cuba for the arms, assuming

we had the policy authorization to support this kind of operation. You

should tell him that as explained by HANLEY to him, it la not enough

for him to just say he would like to support a given guerilla group. He

will have to have some capability for doing it before we can support him,

assuming we can get policy approval for same.

9. With regard to your item 7, I would suggest you remind him he

agreed in his conversation with HANLEY and CLARK that he would

arrange an amicable takeover of the jurists which he admittedly has

not done.

We still hape he can exert enough influence over his people

to keep the mess out of the press.

10. With regard to your item 1, wo too would liko to goe him axort

some leadorship and Induce these groups to unito with him in one way

or another, but do not agren with him that in the long run much can bo

accomplished by just saying "I control the money, and 1 am THE channel

10 tho U.S. Government." Ho must koop in mind that there are in

existance lots of channals to the U.S. Government and by that we do

not snean C.I.A.

Regarding your item il, you probably should omphasize to him

again that he has taken over the FRD budget and personnel and it 1s

up to him to got them organized and doing something other than drawing

relief checks.

12. Regarding your item 14, 1 auggect you continue your "'coordination"

11n0 with MIRO, pointing out these groups are not under complote

control of C.I.A., that they do many things on their own, that we

merely support them from time to timo, usually indirectly.

Accordingly,

we are not in a position to "turn them over" to him, even if we wanted

to, which we at this point, are not sure they would agree to in any case.

Ho will simply have to get into some working relationship with them,

using his million dollara or leadership, preferably the latter.
