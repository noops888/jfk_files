MEMORANDUM FOR: Chairman, JFK Assassination Records Review Board

FROM: David Cohen
Deputy Director for Operations

SUBJECT: Release of JFK Documents

i. I understand the JFK AARB is presently considering the
releasa of documents which would identify CIA stations to the
public. I am opposed in general to revealing the locations of
our stations and would prefer instead to substitute the station
name with a regional designation, e.g. European Station vice
Brussels. I would be willing, however, to open certain stations
during a specific window of time if they are substantively
relevant to the assassination investigation and provided that the
documents in question are sanitized!to T€o conceal the permanent Fa

(presence of the station; (s) =

‘fecceete 2. %In all but a handful of instances, public acknowledgment
of a station would be a political embarrassment to the host
government and would threaten ongoing aensitive operations and
liaison relationships. In a few instances, the damage probably
would be minimal or not at all as long as the presenca appears to
be temporary. I have surveyed the involved components and
determined the damage to national security which would follow
such release. (8)

3. I strongly urge that you not allow the information .
regarding the Congo and to be released. The Congo is now
Zaire and the station in the 60's would have been in
Leopoldvilla, now Kinshasa

4, Within the context of our European presence, I have the
following comments:

| ~ Public acknowledgment would force the
government and liaison service to pay closer attention to
Station operations and therefore present a threat to ongoing (
sensitive operations. (3S) \

- A neutral country. Public acknowledgment
of a CIA station would embarrass the government and liaison;
thereby inhibiting the close and: productive liaison
relationships we now enjoy as well as presenting a threat to
ongoing sensitive operations. (8) i

Paris - No additional damage. (8) |
Bonn - No specific damage. (S) \

Berlin - No specific damage. (8)

~ Public acknowledgmant would embarrase the
government and inhibit liaiaon cooperation; thus endangering
ongoing operations. (S)

- Public acknowledgment would draw questions
from the press and create political problems for the
government and liaigon. This would endanger the
continuation of sensitive joint operations. (S)

~ Public acknowledgment would draw prasa

delicate liaison relationship which is vital to us for
counterterrorism operations. (8)

cally embarrassing for the government and
liaison services. This would likely endanger any
continuation of joint operations. (S)

Je a Public acknowledgment
would create political problems for the government and
liaison service and force greater attention to our
operations. This would create an intensive
counterintelligence atmosphere for our operations; likely to
cause a decrease in our operations. (8)

London - No specific damage. (S)
Ottawa - No specific damage. (8)

5. Our Eastern European stations pose a unique problem when
we consider public exposure. Station is recovering from
operating for almost fifty years in an undeclared status. During
the laat three years we have managed, with much effort, to begin
the establishment of good working relations with the host
government and internal/external services. As a result, the
station has recently begun some very sensitive and high-level
bilateral operations. These obviously depend upon the good will
of the host service. The citizenry came of age in an
atmosphere in which distrust of intelligence services in general,
and the CIA in particular, was thoroughly ingrained. That
distrust lingers in the public's mind even today. Exposure of
our station's. previously undisclosed presence and operational
activities during the Cold War will necessarily raise quastions
about our activities then, and almost certainly lead to further

- Public acknowledgment would draw questions from \\

"a

inquiry about our present relationship. It is doubtful that a |
relationship, and certainly our very sensitive operations, could
withstand the resulting public debate. The existence of
Station, past and present, cannot be surfaced at this time
without serious damage to national security. (5S)

6. Public acknowledgment of our stations in Managua,
San Jose, Panama City, San Salvador, Santo Domingo, Buenos Aires,
Lima, Santiago, and Montevideo would not further damage our
operational capabilities in a specific sense. Overall, any
release of information about a clandestine service breeds

distrust in professionalism
(8)

7. We receive significant national collection syatems
support from which affects national system collection
efforts against Tier IA targets throughout Asia. We would
jeopardize this by releasing the presence of our station to the
public. is a special case in that there is continuing
disagreement regarding our station. We should not complicate the
current "Spy Mania" atmosphere ini | There have been two
incidents regarding our presence in during the present
year. Any further disclosure would exacerbate the tension and
create an untenable operational atmosphere for our atation and
personnel. (8)

8. Public acknowledgmant of a station in would be a
problem for the U.S. Government. U.S. and[ | foreign
relations are always delicate; the Government is very
sensitive to parceived slights to its national sovereignty, and
public acknowledgment of a station would prove embarrassing to
the Government which in turn could ask that the station be
closed, If the station were closed or significantly downsized,
it would affect a larga number of important intelligence
collection operations. (8)

9. Public acknowledgment of a station in| | would be
a problem for vis-a-vis its = neighbor. and
share a border which means the Government must
act with aome prudence regarding its relations with The

Nee Government would almost certainly respond very negatively .

(on public acknowledgment of a station in and might well i

engage in harasament/sabotage/terrorist actions in to t
show its displeasure. If the Government should ask that j
} our station be closed, the U.S. Government would lose a

capability to collect on stability, and |
Islamic extremiam. (8) i

10. Public acknowledgment of a station in would be a
problem fori | vis-a-vis its Islamic fundamentalist
population. like so many countries with a majority
Muslim population, has a growing Islamic fundamentalist problem,
and Islamic fundamentalists are frequently opposed to the U.8. in {
general and the jancy in particular. Public acknowledgment of a |
station in could cause ita Islamic fundamentalist
‘population to react negatively and demand that our station be
closed. If the station were closed, the U.8. Government would

lose intelligence on the conflict,

stability and Islamic extremism. (5)

11. In those instances where I have indicated damage to
operational capability and national security, I would feel
compelled to seek a reversal of any decision to make a public
acknowledgment. In those cases where I indicate "no specific or
additional damage", I am prepared to accept your decision yet I
muat call your attention to the general damage done to us by any
disclosure of operational presence. Our operational capabilities
are in direct proportion to the confidence placed in our ability
to protect source identities and operational methoda. Disclosure
to the public of our presence weakens this confidence. (S)
