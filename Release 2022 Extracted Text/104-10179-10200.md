: oS

1, Lecheduled this meeting for the sole purpove of coatinuing
my quiet development of Subject begun in November 1963, The enter-
prise wae undertaken on a non-specific basis just to keep in touch with
Subject because of bio relatively pre-eminent position in the exile
community. Before the instant meeting I had had brief discussions
with Bolten and Anderson, obtaining their concurrence with my idea
that Subject could someday be a valuable source of insights into the
operations level en ZAI had actually intended at this meeting to 5
concentrate on Subject™s function in the Baga found that the '
diecussion directed itsclf almost exclusively to the affairs af AMBANG-1. ‘
This fact wae the direct and accidental reault of my opening gambit to |
the effect of ' What's new?" in answer to which Subject complained that i
since our last meeting in January, Latin America seemed to be on the :
way to hell in a bandcart and about the only two people who seemed to j
be doing anything about it wore AMBANG and former Veneauelan i
president Betancourt. 1 shan't attempt to reproduce the two hours of
fpneral conversation but do feel that the importance of AMBANG
Coupled with the nature of Subjects views on him warrant a statement

of what these views ar

2. Subject has known AMBANG for several years and has
admired him through all the various ona of their relationsh:p,
Subject wae first impressed with AMBANG's organising talenta at the
time AMBANG took over responsibility for organizing the anti-Batieta
Havana underground from Faustino Peres, AMBANG-1's talente as an :
engineer, according to Subject, have impressed nearly everyone who is :

aware of them, These two factors, the organizing talent ana the
demonstrable engineering ekill sre apparently wedded to a firm,
judicious personality with the result that AMNANG is an effective and
appesling person to Cuban exiles of various stripe. Throughout the
evening Subject reiterated bis conviction that of ail exile leaders who

bave emerged since the take-over of Cuba by Cattro, AM: BANG alone
bao the ability and the profile to put together and jead a successful
resistance enterprise.

3. Subject stressed repeatedly his conviction that whoever is to
attempt to cause @ serious crack in the ever-thicrening ring of defenses
on the island must have the kind of name which will conjure & positive
image in the imagination of the average Cuban. This person must mean
something not only interms of past affiliations and present mulitary
strength Gut in terme of the immediate and not so immediate future, to”
those persons who, though not committed to the Castro revolution, have
either benefitted slightly or are tound to it by virtue of their jobs.
Subject ie certain these persons would not consider AMBANG to be a

menace.

4. Subject claimed that he {s not working with or for AMBANG
and asserted that he had not conversed or correaponded with him for
over half a year. If indeed Subject was leading me on, attempting to
sell AMBANG to me, he did 90 with a subtlety to which I am definitely
pot accustomed. He expressed on more than one occasion a fear that
AMBANG might, in his zeal to get something moving, commit himself
to such #/tight timing that he would be forced to undertake action ata
moment which waa actually disadvantageous to himself, He stressed
that even AMBANG's capital on the island is limited and that whatever
movement is made to cash in on thie capital must be calculated to have
the greatest poosibie effect.
