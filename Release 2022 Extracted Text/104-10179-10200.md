Subjece and Di Vabldu as Eresenchs

1. I acheduled this meetin; for the sole purpose of coatinuias

my quier development of Subject begun in November 1963. The enter-

prise was undertaken on a non-specific baals juat to keep in touch wich

Subject because of ble relatively pre-eminent position in lue exile

community. Before the Instant meeting I had had briel discusslona

with Bollen and Anderson, ubtainini thair concurrence mila sly idea

that Subject could someday be a valuable source of insights into the

operatione level of OASI had actually Intended at chia meeting to

concentrate on subject'a function in the DAS, lur found that tho

diocusnion direcsed itself almoss exclusively to the affairs de AMBAND-I.

Thia fact was the direct and accidental reault of my opening gambit lo

the effect of 'Wbat's new?" In answer to which Subjece complained that

since our laot meating in January, Latin America seemed to be os the

way to hell in a handcart and about tho only luo people uho seeinod lo

be doing anything abour lt were AMBANG and former Venesuelan

president Balancourt. I shan't attempt to reproduce the tuo boure ar

general conversation but do feel that the Importance of AMBANG

coupled with the nature of Subjoct's views on him warrant a statement

of what chers views aro.

2. Subjech has known AMBANG fOr several years and tas

admired him tbrough all the varioua seasons of their relational: p.

judiclous personality with the result shas AMMArC, is an effectire and

appealing person lo Cutan exilea of varioua siripe. Througtour the

ereniny Subject rellorated his conviction lbat of ail exile leaders who

3. Subject stressed repearedly his conviction ties whoover la to

attempt to cause a aerious crack in the ever-thierening ring of defendes

oe the loland must here the kind of name which vill conjure à positive

image in the imagination of the average Cubar.

This person must mean

romething, not only Inierme of past alfiliations and present mulitary

strengch but in terma of the immediate and not so inimedialo futuro, to

those persons who, though not commitred to the Castro rerolution, have

eilhor benefitted alightly or are bo und to it by virtue of their juds.

subject in certain these persona would not consider AMBAli to be a

menaCo.

* Subject claimed that be is not working with or for AlBANG

and asserted that he had not converaed or corresponded with him for

over half a year.

Il indeed Subject was leading me on, attempring lo

sell ANBANG to me, he did do with a subtlety to which i am definitely

not accustomed.

He exprensed on more than one occasion a fear that

AMBANG might, in his zeal to get something moving, commit timeele

so such a tight timing that he would be forced to undertake action at a

moment which was aclually disadvantageous to timbell.

He stressed

ebat even AMBANG's capital on the island la limited and that mierever

movement is made to cash ln on thia capital must be calculared to bave

the greatest possible effect.
