(

Ridderstrale was questioned on Septenber 9th 1764 and

gavethe following infomation.

He has never visited countries outside Europe and the

statement attributed to hin

that during a period of seven

years he should have lived in Cuba is not true. He believed

that somebody who wanted to harm him had ascribed these

words to him. Neither is it true that he has visited laiti.

He admitted

that on several occasions he has discussed

Politics and in the course of these discussions he has

spoken of Swedish communism as well as of the Fidel Castro

government in Cube, and he did not deny that he had spoken

of revolutions in Venezuela and lexico supported by Castro.

lie pointed out, however, that what he had said in this

respect was only what could be found in Swedish newspapers.

sonebody who had listened to him might have misunderstood

him.

When

questioned whether he had used the exoression: "I

tell you, kennedy will probably be shot", he denied that.

Fie could not explain such on expression since he coula

not

remember having seid anything like it. He knew nothing

whatever beforehand about the murder of the President.
