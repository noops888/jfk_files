2022 RELEASE UNDER THE PRESIDENT JOHN F. KENNEDY ASSASSINATION RECORDS ACT OF 1992

SECRET

OTE 92-1403

10 February 1992

MEMORANDUM FOR: Director of Central Intelligence

VIA:

Director of Training and Education

Director, Center for the Study of Intelligence

FROM:

J. Kenneth McDonald

Chief, CIA History Staff

SUBJECT:

Survey of CIA's Records from House Select

Committee on Assassinations Investigation

1.

As you requested on 16 January, the History Staff has

now surveyed CIA's records from the House Select Committee on

Assassinations (HSCA) investigation into the assassination of

President John F. Kennedy.

As promised in my 30 January

interim report, I can now give you a full account of our

findings, and

of my recommendation for transferring this HSCA

collection at its existing classification to the National

Archives

through CIA's Historical Review Program.

2.

After the Office of Congressional Affairs arranged

permission from Congress for History Staff access to the

sequestered 64 boxes of this collection, we examined these and

other related holdings at Headquarters

and the Warrenton

Records Center.

As a result of careful, persistent, and

determined inquiries, we are fairly confident--although by no

means certain--that we have seen all the documents that CIA

collected for the HSCA investigation of 1977-1979. The summary

of our findings which follows is documented in more detail in

attachments A and B.

3.

General Description:

The HSCA collection (defined as

a11

records

that the CIA provided to that Committee for its

1977-1979 investigation) is a large and chaotic collection.

Beyond the 64 boxes sequestered by Congress that have been

involved in FOIA litigation, there are 16 boxes of Oswald's 201

file and numerous loose folders (mainly from Mexico City

Station records) that were collected for the Warren Commission

investigation.

Most of this material can be found on microfilm

in the seguestered collection.

Of the 64 boxes, 34 have

material collected by the Directorate of Operations, while

SECRET

29 contain records from the Office of Legislative Counsel (now

OCA), Inspector General, Office of the General Counsel,

Directorate of Science and Technology, Office of Security, as

well as several boxes of HSCA staff notes and records.

Box No.

64 contains 72 microfilm reels (each equivalent to a box of

records), which include the Oswald 201 file and Mexico City

Station

records, as well as other 201 files

and information

about Cuban exile groups.

4.

Organization:

The collection is arranged haphazardly,

having been gathered in response to a series of HSCA and (in

the case of the Oswald 201 file) Warren Commission requests.

Although portions of the collection are organized by a variety

of systems, there is no overall intellectual control of the

entire body of records.

We found fifteen indexes to the

collection, none of which is adequate for control or retrieval.

5. Sensitivity: Although the collection is almost

entirely at SECRET or lower classification, there is a

scattering of TOP SECRET and codeword documentation.

Materials

we consider especially sensitive--more for privacy than

national security reasons--include 201 files, phone taps, mail

intercepts, security files, photo surveillance, names of

sources, watch lists, and MICHAOS documentation.

Such material

occurs throughout the collection, usually in response to HSCA

requests for name traces.

There are 22 microfilm reels of 201

files in addition to the Oswald file, while eight boxes contain

security records, including,

for example, files on David Atlee

Phillips, Martin Luther King, and Clay Shaw.

6.

Non-CIA Material: The collection includes a lot of

third-agency material, mostly from the FBI. FBI reports

dominate the 16 boxes

of Oswald's 201 file, and nearly half of

the 34 boxes of DO-collected material consists of third-agency

material.

The collection's remaining 29 boxes contain mostly

CIA records, as does the box of microfilm, except for Oswald's

201 file.

There is also some documentation of foreign liaison,

mainly with the Mexican government.

7. CIA Complicity? Our survey found nothing in these

records that indicates any CIA role in the Kennedy

assassination or assassination conspiracy (if there was one),

or any CIA involvement with Oswald. These records do reveal,

however, that Clay Shaw was a highly paid CIA contract source

until 1956.

While nothing surfaced on Carlos Marcello in the

collection, we found substantial documentation on other members

of the mob, including Santos Trafficante.

8. Although the results of our survey fully support my

earlier recommendation against inviting a panel of historians

2

SECRET

into CIA to examine and report on this collection, the problem

that this proposal addressed remains--the widespread

allegations, given new impetus by Oliver Stone's "JFK," that

CIA was part of a conspiracy to assassinate President Kennedy.

That CIA has a closed

collection of records concerning the

Kennedy assassination is well known, both because it is part of

over 800 cubic feet of HSCA investigation records that Congress

has closed until 2029, and because our 64 boxes of these

records have been the

subject of FOIA requests, litigation, and

court orders.

Since opening all US Government records on the

Kennedy assassination has been proposed by former President

FoId, Congressman Louis Stokes, and others, many observers will

* been propos cher test

consider your decision on this question a test of your new

openness policy.

9.

eptions:

CIA's three principal options are to keep the

Agency's HSCA records closed and in our hands, to open then

entirely, or to transfer them to the National

Archives. Before

making my case for the third option, I should note the

following considerations with respect to the first two:

a.

Closed: To maintain the status quo would keep

the

collection classified, closed and in CIA's hands,

seguestered by Congress until 2029. CIA would, however,

remain subject to the 1988 court order to review portions

of it in response to FOIA litigation.

While putting the

collection into Historical Review Program processing

would

speed and broaden its declassification review (which would

nevertheless

take

several years), such an internal shift

would probably not change the public perception of our

closed position. Although keeping these records closed

remains

a viable option, it tends both to encourage

suspicion that cia is part of a cover-up, and to undermine

the credibility of CIA's openness policy.

If Congress

should decide to open all HSCA records, however, CIA would.

be hard put to keep its HSCA collection closed.

b.

Opened: To open the HSCA collection would require the

permission of Congress. Indeed, CIA would presumably not

consider this option except in response to congressional

action or pressure, or in order not to be the last hold-out

in a Government-wide opening of Kennedy assassination

records.

While opening the collection would disclose a

good deal of information that deserves continued protection

for privacy or national security reasons, a total release

would dramatically demonstrate CIA's new openness, and

rapidly reveal that these records contain nothing pointing

to a CIA role in the Kennedy assassination.

10. Recommendation: I recommend that CIA transfer its

entire HSCA collection (as defined and identified in this

report) at its existing classification to the National Archives

and Records Administration (NARA), for continuing

declassification

review by Archives staff, in accordance with

the relevant laws, regulations and CIA guidelines.

transfer should be carried out under the auspices of CIA's

Historical Review Program.

To retire this HSCA collection to

the National Archives offers some significant advantages:

a .

It would get the collection off our hands.

Retiring

the records to the National Archives, which is by law the

eventual repository for all permanent US Government

records, should reduce public suspicion of a CIA cover-up.

Such a transfer would not set a new precedent, since CIA

has

previously retired over 4000 cubic feet of Office of

Strategic Services operational records to NARA, as well as

all CIA records so far declassified under the Agency's

Historical Review Program.

Although CIA has not previously

transferred classified records to NARA, the transfer of

this HSCA collection, resulting from a congressional

investigation, follows the special precedent of the

classified CIA documents retired to NARA's vaults as part

records of the Watergate and Iran-Contra

investigations.

b.

Transferring these HSCA records to the National

Archives will protect their existing classification.

The

Departments of State and Defense have routinely retired

classified records to NARA for years.

In accordance with

statutory guidelines, NARA must ensure the confidentiality.

of investigatory sources and the proper protection of

personal privacy

and national security information,

including intelligence sources and

methods. NARA would

continue the court-ordered declassification review

according

to CIA guidelines.

CIA can accelerate the

declassification of this collection by funding review

positions at NARA, as the Department of State and other

agencies have done in the past. (Attachment C outlines

declassification procedures for classified records retired

to the National Archives.)

C.: NARA's professional archivists will bring this

collection under control (as they have done with the 4000

cubic feet of disorganized OSS records that CIA has retired

since 1984), so that it can be usefully researched as it Is

Moreover, many of the records in this

collection (especially photographs, carbon flimsies, and

Thermofax) need expert preservation, which NARA is

organized to provide.

d.

If Congress should eventually undertake to open this

entire collection without regard to classification, the

National Archives will be in a stronger position to protect

its national security and privacy information than the CIA,

whose motives would appear self-serving, if not sinister.

11. Action: If you wish to retire the Agency's House

Select Committee on Assassinations collection to the National

Archives, the following actions (from the offices noted) will

be needed:

Request permission from Congress. (Office of

Congressional Affairs)

b. Transfer responsibility for court-ordered FOIA

declassification review from CIA to the National Archives.

(Office of the General Counsel, with Information Management

Staff, DO)

Prepare CIA guidelines for NARA's declassification

review.

(Office of Information Technology, DA)

Prepare the appropriate Historical Review Program

documentation and NARA forms, and deliver the

records.

(Office of Information Technology, DA)

Announce the transfer jointly with DI. Don Wilson,

SUMMARY

CIA HISTORY STAFF SURVEY

House Select Committee on Assassinations Collection

10 February 1992

The House Select Committee on

Assassinations (HSCA)

Collection consists of the

following parts, which the attached

box list describes in further detail:

1. Sequestered HSCA Recerds

the, collection, 64 boxes of records under Job No. 80-T01357A,

is wide-ranging material collected in response to House Select

Committee on Assassinations requests for documents relating to

the assassinations of President John F. Kennedy and, to a far

lesser extent, Dr. Martin Luther King. Coordinated by the

he tir they king!

Office of Legislative Counsel (now the Office of Congressional

Affairs) and now under OCA control, these are the "sequestered"

boxes that have been the subject of FOlA litigation and court

order.

Boxes 1-34: DO Boxes 1-34 (34 cu. ft. of records)

are

about one-half Do-collected materials, with the remainder

1--+

largely of third agency documents, primarily FBI reports-

gathered for the Warren Commission.

There is also some

material

from the Department of State and

and Naturalization Service, as well as the be ginal asca

Also included are staff handwritten notes,

photographs, and copies of newspaper clippings. These

records cover a wide variety of topics but focus on CIA

against Cuba and Castro, Lee Harvey Oswald's

sojourn in the USSR, Oswald's activities in Mexico City and

New Orleans, and a large number of name traces reguested by

the HSCA staff.. There is' also material on the Black

Panthers, the civil rights movement, and the peace.

movement. Among the subjects that appear in these boxes

are: Jack Ruby, Clay Shaw, Frank Sturgis, E. Howard Hunt,

Nosenko, Guy Bannister, David Ferrie, Silvia Duran, Martin

buther King, Coretta Scott King; James Earl Ray, William:

Kunstler, Jim Garrison, G. P. Hemming, Marina Oswald, John

Roselli, Sam Giancana,

Santos Trafficante, and Rolando

Cubela's

AMLASH operations against Castro.

These records

also. include the 1967 Inspector General's reporton CIA

plots against Castro and the testimony of Richard Helms in

executive session before HSCA.

b. Boxes 35-63 Boxes 35 through 63 in this job (29 cu.

Ft. of records) are equally eclectic, divided as they are

between records from the Office of Legislative Counsel (now

OCA), Inspector General, Office of the General Counsel,

Directorate,

of Science

and Technology, Office of Security

(security files), and the SCA itself.

These records,

which are mostly CIA material (heavily DO), consist of

reports, memoranda, transcripts, cables, letters, newspaper

clippings, photographs, and charts.

They include materials

relating

to

the Garrison investigation, Watergate, Cuban

exile activities, and CIA attempts to assassinate Fidel

Castro.

There is also some material relating to Martin

King, black power,.and racial. violence,

as well..as.a

Box 64i Microfilm

that this

: 64 of Job No. 80-T01357A. In addition to a

COPY of Oswald's 201 file (as actually shown to the SCA

staff in 1978), the microfilm contains material on Oswald's

activities in Mexico City (primarily photographic and phone

tap surveillance of the Soviet and Cuban embassies and

consulates), Mexico City Station files (including cable

the station's "p" Personality files), CIA

security files, Nosenko interrogation transcripts, and a

great deal of

information relating.to Cuban exile-groups.

There

are also 22 reels of 201 files, which

contain 151

individual files.

Some of the material on these microfilm

reels reproduces

DO material in the boxes, although it is

difficult to judge exactly how much.

Oswald's 201 File. The second part of the HSCA

collection is bee Harvey Oswald's 201 file, 16 boxes (16 cu.

ft. of records) held in the DO's Information Management Staff

(IMS): This file consists primarily of copies of

FBI reports

activities Oscauding tense tattles ot spear to the

assassination), interviews with Marina Oswald, Departinent of

3.

Loese Files The HSCA collection's third part comprises

number of loose folders that evidently belong within the

collection, including eight bulky Mexico City Station files

(including cable traffic and "p" files) that are also in the

microfilm.

These files are considered to be part of the Oswald

201 file and are held in IMS.

A

group of l6 file folders that

appear to be unaccessioned contain a miscellany of HSCA

reguests and Agency responses on subjects

such as Oswald in the

USSR, Marina Oswald, Roselli, and Giancana. These appear to

belong with Job. No. 80-T01357A.

4.

Organization Partly because of the collection's

origins in the disorderly process of the Agency's response to

massive investigatory committee requests, the collection badly

organized. Moreover, years of working through these files

in

response to numerous

Freedom of Information Act reguests have

disrupted the collection further.

More importantly, however,

the Agency.has.not taken intellectual control of the collection

in the fifteen years since it was created.

Partial systems of

organization have been imposed upon various parts of the

collection without reference to or use of sound archival

principles and procedures.

Although 15 separate (and

unsatisfactory) indexes to the collection eventually surfaced,

the lack of any central index or finding aid makes retrieval of

individual documents extremely difficult. Although CIA review

officers attempted

to impose some order to the collection by

numbering each document and adding a folder numbering system to

each box, there is no central control or finding aid for any of

these these systems... Provenance cannot-be traced,

and entire

files are missing that cannot be satisfactorily accounted for.

5. Non-record Copies This collection consists for the

most part of xeroxed cupies rather than original documents. We

suspect that the originals of many, if not most, of these

xeroxed documents would be difficult if not impossible to

locate.

6.

Preservation Much of the material throughout the

collection, especially thermofax copies and photos, is fragile

ana in poor physical condition, requiring immediate attention

to prevent further deterioration.

REPORT OF THE DCI TASK FORCE ON

HISTORICAL REVIEW PROGRAM

DECLASSIFICATION GUIDELINES

On 13 February 1992, the Director of Central

Inteligence asebra. lorge Jameson, chief of the Litigation

Division, OGC, and J. Kenneth McDonald, Chief of the CIA

History Staff, to co-chair a Task Force to prepare

declassification guidelines for a reorganized and expanded

Historical Review Program. This report is the result of the

work of that Task Force.

Premises: The DCI's speech on "CIA and Openness" to

the Oklahoma Press Association of 21 February 1992 expressec

the intent to make CIA and the intelligence process more

visible and understandable in light of changing world

circumstances,

and

from this the Task Force operated on the

following premises:

The Historical Review Program (Program) established

in 1985 will become the responsibility of the Center for

the Study of Intelligence (CSI).

B. Custody, control, and declassification authority

for records reviewed under the Program will be transferred

from the originating offices to the Director, CSI, in order

to accelerate declassification review.

C. The Program will fully conform to Eo 12356,

"National Security Information," and maintain the DCI's

broad statutory authority to protect intelligence sources

and methods.

As part of CIA's movement toward greater openness,

the DCI has directed that the Program have "a bias toward

declassification of historical documents."

principal categories of CIA records:

The Program will review for declassification three

• All documents 30 years old or older (except for

certain operational files exempted from FOIA search

and review by the CIA Information Act of 1984).

## Page 28

ADMINISTRATIVE - INTERNAL USE ONLY

• All National Intelligence Estimates on the

former Soviet Union 10 years old or older.

Records (including operational files) on

selected topics and events of particular historical

value or public interest.

F. On an annual basis, CIA will publish an index of

all documents the Agency has declassified and approved for

release.

3. Objective and Products: The Task Force's primary goal

was to prepare guidelines to help this voluntary Program make

that in program

sound and consistent declassification decisions and to ensure

that the Program has an impetus toward declassification.

Recognizing the

futility of any attempt to formulate rigid

instructions that dictate decisions for all possible cases. or

exhaustive lists of categories of information that reviewers

automatically must declassify or protect, the Task Force

prepared for dcI approval a proposed revision of Headquarters

Regulation 70-14 (attached), which establishes general policies

and guidelines for the Program.

The Task Force expects that the guidelines in this document

will advance the Program's objective to declassify and release

the maximum volume of information to the public consistent with

national security by emphasizing clearly and specifically that:

The Program is guided by a presumption for

disclosure.

• The CSI rather than the components will exercise

declassification authority for historical records.

• Reviewers may not automatically protect or

release documents.

• Reviewers may not withhold information without

articulating with reasonable specificity the

possible damage to national security expected from

disclosure of the information.

• The guidelines, tirm in principle yet flexible

in application, identify certain factors that

reviewers must consider in determining whether

damage could result.

• The Program will continue to protect

information, including intelligence sources and

methods, that could damage the national security.

4.

Organization: The History Staff in CSI, after

consulting with a wide range of historians, will select groups

of permanent records (excepting

certain operational files) 30

years old or older for systematic declassification review, and

locate and collect for review records on specific events or

topics of historical interest selected with the DCI's

A new Historical Review Group in CSI will carry out

declassification review in accordance with the Program's

guidance. (The Program will ordinarily focus on inactive

although on occasion it may be necessary to review

At the beginning of each calendar year, the

Director of CSI will submit a report to the DCI on the

Program's work during the preceding year, and on its plans for

the coming year.

5.

Guidelines for Declassification:

In preparing the

guidelines in the Regulation to give new impetus to

declassification, the Task Force focused on the following

issues:

A.

Presumption for Disclosure: To carry out the DCI's

commitment to the Program, the Task Force emphasized the

presumption for disclosure.

Since EO 12356 provides that

information may be classified only if its disclosure

reasonably could be expected to cause damage to the

national security, an essential Task Force objective was to

prepare useful guidance for reviewers to determine damage.

Unless reviewers can articulate how disclosure could damage

the national security, they must declassify information

even if it concerns matters the Agency has routinely

withheld from public release, such as CIA presence in a

specific country, the fact of certain covert action

operations, Agency organization and personnel' -mosaic"

information withheld solely on grounds of the

effect.

since most records will be at least su years old,

and most operational records will be exempt from systematic

review, the Task Force expects that the Program can

declassify substantial amounts of information without

damage to national security.

B. Sources and Methods:

The Task Force was careful to

ensure that the Program's guidelines do not undermine the

DCI's broad authority to protect intelligence sources and

methods.

The guidelines reiterate EO 12356's presumption

that the

unauthorized disclosure of intelligence sources,

methods, or foreign government information will damage the

national security.

Such information, however, will not be

automatically withheld under this Program. Although

members were concerned about cover disclosure issues, the

Task Force agreed that as an intelligence method, cover

will be governed by these guidelines.

ie.

C.

CIA Presence Abroad: The Regulation does not

automatically protect the fact of the presence of CIA

representatives in a specific country or relationships with

foreign governments.

Such information may be protected

upon a reasonable showing of possible damage.

The Task

Force concluded that in many cases such presence or

relationship might be disclosed by substituting for deleted

particulars such terms as "CIA representatives" and

"government officials" or "authorities."

D. Publicly Available Information: Under this

Program, the extent to which information is already

available to the public, especially information that the

Publications Review Board has approved for publication,

will be a significant consideration in declassification

review.

There is a presumption that information that has

appeared publicly will not damage national security, unless

a

reviewer can articulate how official confirmation could

cause additional damage.

E.

Protection of Unclassified Material: Reviewers may

withhold some information even if it is unclassified.

(Examples are information protected by discretionary

privileges such as deliberative process--especially

involving the Director and President--attorney work

product, attorney-client, and witness statements.) This

material also will not automatically be protected, and

reviewers must articulate expected

harm to US interests in

order to protect it.

Much of the information in this

category will probably be disclosed. Information

prohibited by law from disclosure (e.g., privacy data) will

continue to be protected.

6. Procedures:

To be effective in accelerating the

declassification review, the Program will ensure that

components are consulted.

The Regulation addresses this and

certain procedural matters as follows:

A.

Consultation: The CSI will advise the responsible

components of its

selection of records and consult with

them as

necessary in conducting its review.

B.

Appeal Process:

Records approved by the Director

of CSI for declassification will be made available to the

appropriate deputy directors or heads of independent

offices, who will have 30 working days to appeal any

decision to the Director, CSI.

If the appeal is denied,

they will have 10 working days to appeal that decision to

the DCI.

C. Re-review:

In its review, the CSI will identify

records that cannot be released, and will review them again

not more than 10 years later.

D. Index: CIA will publish an annual index of all

Agency documents approved for release (e.g.. under the

FOIA, but not the Privacy Act). This will

serve both the

public and the Program's research needs.

It has been

suggested that CSI publish this index, but the Task Force

is convinced that such an index will require ADP expertise,

personnel, and equipment far beyond anything available in

the Center. Although the Historical Review Group will

record its final review determinations, the task force

recommends that the Office of Information Technology (OIT)

be asked to develop and maintain this index.

7. Application to Other Review Programs: The guidelines

will inevitably have an impact on the release of Agency

information under other review programs, such as the FOIA.

naches be come tent.

While standards need to be consistent, many different factors

will determine whether CIA will release information in any

given situation.

Task Force therefore agreed that the

Program's guidelines for historical records should be taken

into account Agency-wide, but that their specific application

to other review programs should be the subject of future study.

8.

Resources:

The Agency's current means of recording

declassification and other disclosure decisions are

rudimentary, fragmented,

and entirely inadequate.

The Task

Force believes OIT should develop and maintain a

data base both

to track all Agency disclosures and to facilitate, the

publication of the annual index.

Additional resources for OIT

may be reguired.

Directorates

and independent offices also

will require additional resources both to conduct appeals of

the Program's decisions, and to cope with the impact of the new

declassification guidelines on their review of Agency

information under the FOIA and other programs.

9.

Conclusion:

The Task Force recognizes that applying

the proposed guidelines will raise some complex issues that CSI

can only resolve by consulting the rest of the Agency as the

Program actually gets underway.

While making the Program

succeed will demand extraordinary energy, commitment, and sound

Judgment, we believe that our guidelines give the Program the

foundation it needs to begin its pioneering work.

HR 70-14

14. CIA HISTORICAL REVIEW PROGRAM

SYNOPSIS®

This regulation prescribes the

responsibilities, guidelines, and procedures for the

declassification review and release of permanent Agency

records under

the CIA Historical Review Program.

8.

GENERAL

(1) The Agency's Historical Review Program (hereafter, the

Program) is established to make significant historical

information available to the public without damage to

the national security interests of the United States.

This includes systematic review for declassification

and release of: all permanent records 30 years old or

older (with the exception of certain operational

files); other records on selected topics or events;

and certain National Intelligence Estimates.

(2) Reaffirming the principle that the US Government's

records should be available to the public, this

Program will declassify and release to the public the

maximum volume of historical records consistent with:

(a)

The responsibilities of the Director of Central

Intelligence (DCI) under the National Security

Act of 1947 and the CIA Act of 1949, as amended,

to protect intelligence sources and methods and

organizational and personnel information.

(b)

The

requirements of Executive Order 12356 and

successor orders to protect national security

(c)

information.

Provisions of law that govern the public

disclosure of information.

(3) The Agency will transfer records declassified and

approved for release under this Program to the

National Archives and Records Administration

(hereafter, National Archives) for public use.

(4) The Agency will also make information available to the

public in other ways, including the release of

declassified

records

to the Department of State for

publication in its documentary history series, The

Foreign Relations of the United States. such Agency

material released to the Department of State will also

be transferred to the National Archives through the

Program.

AUTHORITY. The Historical Review Program is established

in accordance with:

(1) Executive Order 12356, which prescribes a uniform

system for classifying, declassifying, and

safeguarding national security information,

and

provides in § 3.3(c) that the DCI may establish

special procedures for systematic review for

declassification of classified information pertaining

to intelligence activities (including special

activities), or intelligence sources or methods.

(2) The responsibility of the DCI under § 102(d) (3) of the

National Security Act, as amended, 50 U.s.C.

§ 403(d) (3), to protect intelligence sources and

methods from unauthorized disclosure.

(3) Section 6 of the CIA Act of 1949, as amended, 50

U.S.C. § 403g, which exempts the Agency from the

provisions of any law requiring the publication or

disclosure of the organization, functions, names,

official titles, salaries, or numbers of personnel

employed by the Agency.

(4) The CIA Information Act of 1984, 50 U.S.C. § 431,

which exempts certain operational files from the

search and review provisions of the Freedom of

Information Act.

• c. RESPONSIBILITIES

(1) THE DIRECTOR, CENTER FOR THE STUDY OF INTELLIGENCE,

has principal responsibility for the Historical Review

Program. Custody, control, and declassification

authority for all

purposes of records selected and

received for review under the Program will be

transferred from the components to D/CSI. At the

beginning of each calendar year the Director, Center

for the Study of Intelligence will submit a report to

the DCI on the Program's work in the past year, and on

its plans for the year ahead.

(2) In the Center for the Study of Intelligence the

History Staff and the Historical Review Group (HRG)

are responsible for carrying out the Program.

area Information Review Officers.

To advise the Program on its policies and

procedures the Director, Center for the Study of

Intelligence, may from time to time convene the

Historical Review Panel, which will include the

Archivist of the United States, the Librarian of

Congress, and representatives of the historical

profession.

(3) The Agency Archivist will assist the Historical Review

Group in maintaining the integrity of all permanent

records (as determined by the Archivist of the United

States) received of created by the Agency, and in

preparing appropriate documentation to provide data

for an annual index of all Agency documents approved

intelligence reports.

Priority for review will also

be given to file series requiring prompt reproduction

or other conservation action to ensure preservation of

the information contained in the records.

(3) The History Staff will evaluate records in light of

the contribution their declassification and release

can make to understanding the history of CIA and its

role in US intelligence, foreign policy, and

international developments.

(4) To determine historical value, the Chief, History

Staff, will consider the recommendations of the

Historical Review Panel, and of a wide range of

government, academic, and private historians.

(5) The following records will be subject to systematic

declassification review:

(a)

All permanent records held by the Agency that are

30 years old or older when reviewed, with the

exception of certain operational files designated

by the DCI under the provisions of the CIA

Information Act of 1984.

topics of historical interest.

GUIDELINES FOR DECLASSIFICATION

(1) Executive Order 12356 requires that information be

classified only if its disclosure reasonably could be

expected to cause damage to the national security, and

that it shall be declassified or downgraded as soon as

national security considerations permit.

The Order

further states that information that no longer

requires protection in the interest of national

security shall be declassifed and released unless

withholding is otherwise authorized by applicable law.

(2) There shall be a presumption in favor of disclosure

except as provided in subparagraph (e) (4).

Reviewers

conducting declassification review of information

under this Program who advocate the continued

classification of information will bear the burden of

identifying any damage its disclosure reasonably could

be expected to cause to the national security.

Information may remain classified only if the reviewer

can identify such damage and a clear connection

between disclosure and the projected damage. : To show

such damage with respect to information 30 years old

or older, a reviewer

must articulate how disclosure of

the information is likely to affect, in a significant

and adverse way, the US Government's current or future

ability to carry out its authorized activities.

Unless a showing of possible damage is made with

reasonable specificity, the information will be

declassified, even if the information concerns Agency

matters normally withheld from public release, such as:

(a) The fact of CIA presence in a specific country

abroad.

(b)

The fact that certain covert action operations

were conducted.

(c)

The existence of foreign government relationships.

(d)

Agency organization, functions, names, official

titles, and salaries, and numbers of personnel

employed by the Agency.

(e)

Information withheld solely on grounds of the

"mosaic" effect.

(3) Factors to be considered in determining whether damage

to the national security reasonably could be expected

to be caused by disclosure include the effect of the

5

---

## Page 37

13-00000

passage of time on the sensitivity of the information,

any prior disclosures of the information, the link

between disclosure and possible harm, and past

experience with respect to disclosures of

similar

information.

(4) Under EO 12356 the unauthorized disclosure of foreign

government information, the identity of a confidential

foreign source, or intelligence sources or methods is

presumed to cause damage to the national security.

Such information, however, shall not be automatically

withheld under this Program.

(5) In accordance with the third agency rule, the

Historical Review Group will coordinate its review

decisions as necessary with other US Government

agencies before taking final declassification action

and arranging to transfer records to the National

Archives.

(6) A significant consideration in reviewing information

for declassification under this Program will be the

extent to which the information is already available

to the public.

Information that CIA has officially

acknowledged (including inadvertent disclosures) will

not be eligible for continued classification.

There

is a presumption that information that has appeared

publicly, including information that the CIA

Publications Review Board has approved for publication

even if not confirmed officially, will not damage the

national security unless the reviewer can show how

official confirmation could reasonably be expected to

cause additional damage to the national security.

(7) The Historical Review Group will determine whether the

information under review warrants continued

protection, even if declassified, pursuant to

statutory or other requirements.

Such information

le. g, privacy data and information protected by

executive privilege) will be released, except when

prohibited by law, unless there is a showing that us

interests will be adversely affected by the

disclosure.

(8) In no case will information be kept classified in

order to conceal violations of law, inefficiency, or

administrative error; to prevent embarrassment to a

person, organization, or agency; or to prevent or

delay the release of information that does not require

protection in the interest of national security..

PROCEDURES

(1) Individual documents will be released in full,

withheld in full, or released in part.. When

document cannot be released in full, an effort to

sanitize the document by deleting those portions that

may not be declassified, or that may not be made

public for other lawful reasons, will be undertaken.

This procedure will be followed only when it will not

slow the pace of the review unduly, will not obscure

the record's essential significance, and will not

distort the document's bibliographical identity, even

if details of internal dissemination are excised.

Documents that cannot be sanitized according

to these

criteria will be withheld in full.

(2) The Director, Center for the Study of Intelligence,

will review the determinations proposed by the

Historical Review Group, and if approved, make them

available

to the deputy directors, heads of

independent offices, or their designees, whose

components originated or have a substantial interest

in the records.

The responsible official will have

30 working days from the date of receipt of such

records in

which to appeal in writing to the Director,

Center for the Study of Intelligence, any decision to

declassify and release information.

(3) If the appeal is denied, the responsible deputy

director or head of independent office will have

10 working days from the receipt of the decision of

the Director, Center for the Study of Intelligence, to

appeal that decision in writing to the Director of

Central Intelligence, whose decision will be final.

(4). The Historical Review Group will maintain a record of

all final determinations.

(5) At the time of review, HRG will identify Agency

records that cannot be declassified.

The HRG will

again review such records for declassification at a

date not more than 10 years later specified by the

Director, Center for the Study of Intelligence. That

date will be marked on the document.

(6) This Regulation is intended to provide direction and

guidance for those engaged in declassification review

of records under the CIA Historical Review Program.

A

separate

collection of boxes (1-16) comprises the Lee

There are 8 "bulky" files from Mexico City Station which

also belong to the Oswald 201 collection.

There are 16 loose files, miscellaneous material from the

HSCA.

These boxes are physically located in IMS/DO, where the HS

historians did their survey.

They are currently the property

of OCA, but will presumably be turned over officially to CSI.

History Staff (Mary) asked us to give

first priority to

the Oswald 201 boxes.

I called Kathy Stricker right after the HS meeting to see

what DO's understanding of this is.

MEMORANDUM FOR:

SUBJECT

: a. Ancillary Files

Lee Harvey Oswald, 201-289248

: b. Sequestered Files

HSCA Collection

1.

INTRODUCTION: In August 1976, Chief, CI Staff appointed the

undersigned as the Staff representative on a Task Force

established in response to DDCI's orders to the Deputy Inspector

General. The Task Force's purpose was to review Book V of the

"Church Committee"'s Final Report: The Investigation of the

Assassination of President John F. Kennedy: Performance of the

Intelligence Agencies, and to formulate comments, based upon an

in-depth study of information available in Agency files, on

statements made and questions raised in Book V.

Since CI Staff,

at that time. held Lee Harvey Oswald's 201 file, the CI Staff

chief charged the undersigned with reviewing the file

and

preparing papers on a

series of topics drawn up by the Task Force

leader.

• 2. It quickly became evident to the undersigned that the

so-called 201 file on Lee Harvey Oswald was much more than what a

201 file should be.

In addition to biographic information on

Oswald, the file included radio traffic between Headquarters and

the field on matters pertaining to Oswald,

information on known

and possible contacts abroad and in the United States,

correspondence between the Agency and the Warren Committee, the

"Garrison Investigation", etc., as well as internal Warren

Commission documents containing Agency information. The file also

includes some 500 third-agency documents (primarily from the FBI

and the Department of State).

In order to get a

handle on the welter of disparate material

in the Oswald file, the undersigned set up more than a few

individual files to hold photocopies of documents dealing with

such topics as Gilberto ALVARADO-Ugarte, Silvia DURAN, Waldemar

Boris KARA-PATNITSKY, Valeriy Vladimirovich KOSTIKOV,

etc.

attached inventory - Tab A.) The undersigned considers these

ancillary files, which include 9 folders from the former Special

Investigation Group of CI Staff,

as an appendix to Oswald's 201

file.

Its integrity should be maintained. [See paragraph 8.]

4.

FIRST AND SECOND REVIEWS (October 1975 - c. February 1977):

For the first time, in October 1975, CI Staff reviewed Oswald's

201 file to ascertain which documents could be released to Bernard

Fensterwald who had requested all Agency documents on Lee Harvey

_ 1 -

Oswald and the assassination of President Kennedy. OGC, who was

handling Fentserwald's request, considered the first staff review

as inadequate and assigned a paralegal (assisted by a CI Staff

officer) to do a more complete second review. At the same time,

each Directorate was asked to forward to OGC any documents in

their files, which pertained to the Kennedy assassination. These

documents were included in the second review.

5.

SEQUESTERED DOCUMENTS: By the time the Task Force had

completed its report in August 1977, the House of Representatives

passed a resolution setting up a Select Committee on

Assassinations.

Later, the

House decided to limit its

investigation of the assassinations of President Kennedy and Rev.

Martin Luther King, III.

Members of the Task Force now became

involved in handling requests from the House Select Committee

(HSCA) • The undersigned worked closely with HSCA staff members

and with the Agency's Principal Coordinator, HSCA. When the HSCA

finished its report on 30 June 1979 (its report did not come out

until later that year), the undersigned then moved to the Ames

Building to join a group reviewing OSS documents for eventual

transfer to the National Archives.

6. By late 1981, the Agency had prepared its material gathered

for the HSCA, for placement in sequestered storage in the Agency's

(Warrenton) Archives.

The undersigned, though available, was not

asked

to assist in

this undertaking to ensure all pertinent DO

material had been included in the collection.

7..

Later, after returning to Headquarters, at IMS's request to

work on the many of FOIA requests for Agency documents on the

Kennedy Assassinations, the undersigned recalled Oswald's 201

including the ancillary files mentioned above.

8.

While preparing an inventory of these latter files, before

returning them to IMS/Files,

the undersigned discovered to his

dismay, that not all pertinent files had not been included in the

sequestered Collection in late 1981.

Thirty-six of these

documents had been clearly prepared in response to specific HSCA

requests.

The undersigned made a list of these documents to show

the History Staff's group reviewing the HSCA sequestered

collection.

The documents include, for example

supporting documents, to the 1976-1977 Task Force.

Since this

material was available at the time of the HSCA review of Agency

documents pertaining to the assassination of President Kennedy, it

was shown to HSCA staff members either voluntarily or in response

to a verbal request to the undersigned.

Each file contained a

"signature sheet" for the staff member to sign, thereby

acknowledging he had seen it. This material, in some thirty-five

folders, includes

Deputy Director of Congressional Affairs

Request for Access to HSCA Records

Your Memorandum dtd 13 April 1992;

Same Subject (CSI 92-0201)

1. In the reference, you requested approval for all

members of CSI to have access to all recorás that CIA holás

relevant to the HSCA investigation into President Kennedy's

assassination.

Upon receiving this approval, CSI would

request affected components to transfer custody of the 64 .:

boxes of material in question to CSI.

2.

Today, I called Michael O'Neil, Special Assistant

to the Speaker of the House of Representatives. Mr. O'Neil

serves as the focal point for questions arising with respect

to the segregated asca collection.

I informed MI. O'Neil of

your request, noted that the DCI had promised an expeditious

review of these documents, and requested his concurrence to

proceed with

the transfer of custody.

Initially, Mr. O'Neil

wondered whether this action would frustrate the purposes of

the Joint Resolution currently being considered by the

CongIess.

Specifically, since the documents would be

provided to a Review Board pursuant to the resolution, would

transfer

told MI. O'Neil that if the Joint Resolution passed in its

i want chang

current form, we would instruct the CSI to transfer the

holdings

to the Board. If the Joint Resolution did not

pass, we would have a head start on reviewing the documents.

3. I then informed Mr. O'Neil that the new historical

review group would have at least fifteen officers and that

this group would likely review the material.

Mr. O'Neil

then

stated that he concurred in the transfer of custody and

in the request for access by CSI personnel.

Based on this conversation, I have signed the

reference indicating my approval of your request. During

the course of your revien, you should continue to coordinate

closely with Litigation Division, OGC, and this office to

ensure that decisions to release are consistent with

litigation and other requirements.

Results of 25 July meeting with Mike Getsey and Steve Tilley

re JEK database extract.

The following item numbers are keyed to Martha Sanfacon'S

"restricted data" -- NARA will accept disk with

restricted data withheld. Issues will be re-visited after a

decision on disposition of CIA's classified (retention) JFK

collection.

#2.

Exemption Codes

-- The Agency is not required to use

the additional exemption codes or add them to its system,

however,' they must be accounted for in the extract disk.

Getsey suggested that this could be done by the extract

program.

Question: is it possible to add a couple of codes

without a major programming problem?

#3.

White paper for Iden Aids - yes.

#4. Keywords -- NARA has no problem with the length of

IA's 15 character field for keywords, however, with th

urrent format NARA can only search on the first keyword

Each keyword needs to be a separate entity on the extract

disk.

#5. Title Field -- NARA is expanding the title field to cut

down on the number of truncated titles. Does not effect HRG

system which is already 250 characters.

#6. "Identification Number" -- Move date/time ID number to

September 16, 1997

To:

Review Board

From:

Subject:

T. Jeremy Gurn

Proposed ARRE Timetable fo Review of CTA Records

• I. Background

The CIA Team has developed a preliminary timetable that we hope will provide a

reasonable framework for completing our review of ClA's assassination records by

August I, 1998.' We are creating this timetable for three purposes:

First, to establish our own working target dates to measure Review Board progress

against the mandatory deadline established by the JFK Act.

Second, to provide CIA with our best assessment of the order and scope of our review

so that it can make its own internal judgments on the proper allocation of its resources.

We provided CIA prior drafts of this memo and solicited its specific advice and

suggestions for better ways to accomplish our goals. [We have not asked CIA to

"agree" to these deadlines, but we have encouraged it to provide alternative

suggestions on how best to meet the August 1 deadline.]

Third, to solicit the Review Board's advice regarding "enforcement" of these (or other)

targets. Although we surely hope that both the ARRB staff and CIA will be able to meet

the targets, and although we certainly plan to make all reasonable accommodations for

problems that no doubt will arise, we nevertheless anticipate that it is possible that CIA

might not be able to keep to these timetables. Thus, we anticipate that there may well

be times when blocks of records scheduled for Board review will not have been fully

processed by ClA. It is our judgment that, in keeping with our commitment to

Congress and to the goals of the JFK Act, we may need to have the Board act on groups

of records for which CIA has not completed its initial review. At the risk of over-

repetition, the ARRB staff seeks to be as reasonable and accommodating as it can on

timetables, provided that any proposed changes are consistent with our obligation to

complete the task. We realize that this review may have resource-allocation

'By establishing this target date, we will provide ourselves with a two-month

cushion to handle possible appeals and miscellaneous issues that doubtless will arise.

consequences for CIA and we expect to refine this timetable both to minimize the e

resource impact and to allow us and the CIA to proceed most effciently with the

review. We also take very seriously our commitment to Congress to complete ow work

on schedule. Is the Board prepared to make decisions on records if CIA has not

completed its review and to enforce those decisions?

II. Issues applying to all CLA record groups

Records to be opened-in-full

During the course of CIA's review, it frequently identifies records that is it

is prepared to open in full without Board action. Although there is a

benefit in promptly forwarding such records to NARA, it is less expensive

for CIA to process these records during the summer months.

Accordingly, we are prepared to agree with CIA that it may delay.

processing such records, provided that all such processing of open-in-full

records will be completed by August 30, 1998.

Duplicates

CIA will continue to identify duplicates and may process them after all

other documents have been reviewed and transferred to NARA. If the

ARRB is shown that any given record is a duplicate, CIA need not

complete the processing before September 30, 1998.

- current status:

folder level) and has assigned each folder a relevance priority on a

1 to 4 scale. CIA has completed its declassification review of

roughly 66% of the priority 1 folders.

The ARRB Staff has completed its own review of approximately

50% of the priority 1 records and those records have been (or

shortly will) be voted on by the Board.

CIA identified approximately 33% of these records as NBR. ARRB

staff has reviewed all CIA NBR designations, and has identified

additional records that should be reviewed by the Board.

"The ARRB staff has no objection to the records being identified entirely on the

folder level provided that all records in the folder are open-in-full. If there are records

in which the CIA is requesting redactions, those records must be identified

individually. The remainder of open-in-full records may still be identified with one RIF

as being the contents of the same folder.

Act. To the extent that the records previously have been reviewed,

there is little value in re reviewing the records. The ARRB staff will

survey the Microfilm 201 in an effort to identify any additional

records that have not already been acted upon by the Board. All -

records not previously acted upon by the Board will be so

designated, a RIP wil be prepared, and they will be sent for Board

action. The remaining Microfilm 201 will be transferred to the JFK

Collection at NARA and opened in full in 2017.

records in the 201 Microfilm that are not already in the JFK

Collection

-strategy:

The "working files" is a group of records that was assembled at

CIA by Russ Holmes. Although he was not asked formally by CIA

to create this separate records group, he did so in order to facilitate

his work and, perhaps, to satisfy his own curiosity. The group

contains many original records (copies of some of which are

already in the collection) and it includes some records of which we

are aware of no other copies. It is the best-organized collection of

assassination records held by CLA. Its value as a reference tool is

greatest as a collection. Therefore, though the file contains manÿ

duplicates of records found in the JFK collection; the ARRB staff

recommends that it be preserved as a single group. Duplicates and

open-in-full documents should be treated in the same manner as

they are in the rest of the JFK Collection, As with the microfilm

from the Sequestered Collection, the ARRB staif has no objection to

the records being identified on the folder level provided that all

records in the folder are open-in-full. If there are records in which

CIA is requesting redactions, those records must be identified

individually. The remainder of open in full records may still be

identified with one RIF as being the contents of the same folder.

D. Additional Records

- status:

Research, requests, and negotiations continue to identify and

include additional CIA records for the JFK collection.

Oswald Office of Security File. As a result of an ARRB staff request

for additional information and records, ClA located portions of a

previously undisclosed Office of Security file on Lee Harvey

Oswald. This seven-volume file, of which six parts have been

located, contains two volumes of press clippings, third agency

material on Oswald, a copy of Oswald's address book, and Marina

Oswald's INS file. In the upcoming months CIA will begin to

review and process these materials.

- time line:

Completion by July 31, 1998.

- strategy:

Continue current efforts.

JFK Records Review Project

The following is intended as a guide for those people

work requires them to deal with requests for, and

decisions concerning, Agency documents and materials that

may already have been reviewed and released to the National

Archives (in full or in part), pursuant to the President

John F. Kennedy Assassination

Records Collection Act of

1992.

Some of the records within the Agency's JFK

collection are assassination specific, others are ancillary.

They deal with individuals and events not directly linked

with Oswald or the assassination; !but they are thought to

have had a relationship to the assassination or

investigation into the assassination.

I. The Agency's JFK Collection.

(U)

The Agency's JFK records collection is made up

primarily of records pulled together for the Warren

Commission and House Select Committee on Assassinations

(HSCA) :

There were eighty-one (81) Records Center-sized

boxes

in the original collection.

Of these, the first

seventeen (17) made up the Oswald 201 file.

The next sixty-

four (64) are referred to as the

"JFK files" or sequestered

collection and break down as follows: thirty-four (34) boxes

of DO materials; nine (9) boxes of Office of Security files;

fifteen (15) boxes of OLC materials; two (2) boxes each of

OGC and IG materials; and one (1) box of DDS&T documents.

HSCA originated material, including notes by HSCA staff

members, are found throughout the collection. Box 64

contains seventy two (72) reels of microfilm.

(U)

The microfilm contains copies of complete files to

which the HSCA had access during its investigation. In

addition to the Oswald 201 file (12 reels), the microfilm

includes: 201 files on Cubans, Americans, and Soviets linked

to Oswald, the JFK assassination or the various

investigations (approximately 26 reels)and the Cuban

Revolutionary Council

and other exile group activities

(approximately 13 reels); the personnel files of CIA staff

employees

(approximately 5 reels); and operational files on

(U) We continue to identify other collections of documents

that properly belong within the JFK collection.

These

include:

The Oswald Security File; Agency working files

generated by JFK assassination investigations and requests;

and CIA documents found by other agencies and Presidential

Libraries and referred to CIA for review under the JFK Act.

II. The Time Frame of JFK Assassination Records.

(U)

In general, the time frame of JFK records commences

when Oswald arrived at the US air base (the U-2) at Atsugi,

Japan, in December 1957 and continues through the end of the

Garrison investigation in 1968.

Note, however, for

information which is clearly related to the story of the JFK

assassination or its investigations, there is no time Irame

limitation.

Any document or request that deals with the

assassination, Lee Harvey Oswald, or the various conspiracy

theories should be referred to the HRG/JFK review project.

III. Key Topics, Etc.

(U)

Certain individuals, organizations, places,

projects, and subjects are

central to the Oswald/JFK story

and the ensuing investigations, which causes a number of

documents with no mention of Oswald or the assassination to

fall within the purview of the JFK Act. Clearly, it is not

possible to list every category of document which may have

been reviewed and released under the JFK Assassination :

Act.

The following categories contain examples of

information that are considered to be within the JFK

review.

JFK Records Review Project

(U)

The following is intended as a guide for those

people whose work requires them to review Agency documents

and materials that may be subject to the President John F.

Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992.

Some of the records within the Agency's JFK collection are

assassination specific, others

are ancillary.

They deal

with individuals and events not directly linked with Oswald

or the assassination; but they are thought to have had a

relationship to the assassination or investigation into the

assassination.

I. The Agency's JFK Collection.

(U)

The Agency's JFK records collection is made up

primarily of records pulled together for the Warren

Commission and House Select Committee on Assassinations

There were eighty-one 81) Records Center-sized

boxes in the original collection.

Of these, the first

seventeen (17) made up the Oswald 201 file.

The next sixty-

four (64) are referred to as the "JFK files" or sequestered

collection and break down as follows: thirty-four (34) boxes

down

of DO materials; nine (9) boxes of Office of Security files;

fifteen (15) boxes of OLC materials; two (2) boxes each of

OGC and IG materials; and one (1) box of DDS&T documents.

SCA originated material, including notes by HSCA staff

members, are found throughout the collection. Box 64

contains seventy two (72) reels of microfilm.

(U)

The microfilm contains copies of complete files to

which the HSCA had access during its investigation. In

addition to the Oswald 201 file (12 reels), the microfilm.

includes: 201 files on Cubans, Americans, and Soviets linked

to Oswald, the JFK assassination or the various

investigations (approximately 26 reels)and the Cuban

Revolutionary Council and other exile group activities

(approximately 13 reels); the personnel files of CIA staff

employees

(approximately 5 reels); and operational files on

organizations, projects, and other subjects of interest to

the HSCA investigation

(approximately 16 reels).

October 1997

Bay of Pigs Declassification Project

Approximately 30,000 pages of records from DO, DI, DCI, DA,

and DDS&T files, plus documents from outside CIA (mainly

State, NSC, DOD) •

Scope: To "tell the story" of the paramilitary invasion at

the Bay of Pigs, the HRG collection traces the genesis of

inquiries into the failure of the operation.

Status:

As of this date, approximately 1/3 of the

collection has been reviewed and is ready for release.

A

selection of documents was provided to OGC in August 1997 in

response to a special search for information pertaining to

the crash landing of two Cuban exile pilots in Nicaragua.

HRG expects to finish reviewing the remainder of the records

in early 1998.

All documents will be available for MORI

processing following their release, although HRG does not

have the staff to do the physical scanning and indexing.

Key parts of the record collection include:

• intelligence analysis of events in Cuba 1958-61

• records of meetings between CIA senior officials and

counterparts in other agencies at which Cuban

developments and/or the covert action plans were

discussed

• internal planning documents (virtually all from DO files)

underground opposition in Cuba

• cable traffic during the Bay of Pigs invasion

• training records of the Cuban-led 2506 Brigade that

conducted the Bay of Pigs invasion

• Agency records turned over to the Taylor Committee

appointed by Pres. Kennedy to investigate the failed

invasion

Guatemala 1954 Covert Action Declassification Project

The main bulk of the collection is approximately 120,000 pages of hard copy materials

spanning the period of 1951-1957. These comprise primarily Directorate of Operations

records, but also including a small number of State Department documents as well as

isolated equities of other components, both Agency internal and Department of Defense.

There are also 22 archival (gray Hollinger) boxes with magnetic tape recordings, a few

maps, and some press clippings.

Scope: To release to the public as much information as possible relating to the buildup of

early 1950s-era policymaker attention to the "Guatemala problem;" the three main phases

of the covert operation codeworded PBFORTUNE, PBSUCCESS, and PBHISTORY;

and the immediate aftermath of these operations.

Status: To date 1,400 pages have been released to National Archives, along with the 22

boxes of tapes. The first release also included the collection's most sensitive records

dealing with discussions of unimplemented plans to assassinate leftist officials of the

Guatemalan government of President Arbenz.

• Of the remaining unreleased records, some 18,000 pages of the most historically

relevant material have been reviewed twice and await final review in HRG, and then by.

the DO representative. When this task is completed and these records released to

Archives, most of the "story" will have been told of US-Guatemalan relations in the

1952-54 era, at least as concerns CIA participation in the events.

• With the decision to review the remaining 100,000 pages, mostly relating to the

administrative details of conducting the covert operation, the project will extend well

into next calendar year.

Content of the Collection

• Periodic intelligence assessments of the situation in Guatemala as it affected US

interests

• Key strategic planning memoranda exploring options and recommendations for

operations

• Operational cables between Washington and the field stations, and communications

among the field stations, including situation reports

• More detailed, less time-sensitive dispatches between the field stations and

Washington

October 1997

Declassification of DI-Produced Finished Intelligence on the USSR

The primary organizing feature of the collection is thematic: all DI-produced

finished analysis on the Soviet Union. The collection exists in the form of hard copy

retained in the record-copy holdings at the Agency Archives and Records Center and, for

the older period at least, is generally interspersed among records representing the full

range of DI analysis on all other geographic topics and functional intelligence issues.

After 1981, the most relevant records tend to be concentrated in the holdings of the

Office of Soviet Analysis and its successors.

To qualify as relevant to the Soviet DI project, a piece of finished analysis must

have as its primary focus the Soviet target. This can be either stated or implied as, for

example, in the monthly series entitled North Vietnamese Shipping Report since North

Vietnam's main trading partner for the period in question was the Soviet Union. We have

also processed in their entirety pieces whose scope entails comment on "Sino-Soviet"

themes.

• Intelligence Community-wide analysis of the USSR, NIEs and similar material, is

outside the scope of the DI-Soviet project and is being done elsewhere in HRG.

• An initial decision was made to focus generally on longer pieces with greater shelf

lives and to avoid processing the daily "current" output. To date, however, there has

been at least one departure from this approach in connection with a conference on 24

October 1997, for which we declassified a number of finished intelligence pieces that

were published in dailies and weeklies during the period from 1946-1950.

Scope: To release to the public over the next few years as much DI finished intelligence

on the Soviet Union as possible, beginning in 1946 with the creation of the CIG, and

continuing chronologically to the most recent material. Most of the oldest material is

releasable, including political, economic and military analysis.

The duration of the project depends on issues as yet unresolved:

• No final decision has yet been made with respect to a cutoff date for the project, and

various options are currently under discussion. For the present, we are committed to

review only records that are at least 25 years old.

• If the cutoff date is set as late as the breakup of the USSR in 1991, there is some

concern about giving away too much by declassifying the most recent analysis. One

option is to move away from recently produced military/technical analysis based on the

---

## Page 76

13-00000

most sophisticated collection methods and to declassify the less sensitive political and

economic analysis in the younger records instead.

Status: An initial release of approximately 11,000 pages of finished intelligence has been

through all stages of preparation, including internal review and external coordination with

the Directorate of Intelligence, and is now ready to send to National Archives. In

addition, some 75,000 pages of finished analysis has been selected and reviewed internally

at least twice and is now awaiting final review or coordination with DI components or

other agencies holding equities in the information.

• The 11,000-page proposed first release contains material ranging in date from 1946 to

1972.

Content of the Collection

The collection includes both periodic and aperiodic finished intelligence and embraces

most of the reporting genres which were produced in the Directorate of Intelligence. The

list includes, but is not confined to:

Research Reports (CIA/RR XX)

Intelligence Reports (CIA/RR ER XX-XX)

Intelligence Memoranda (IM-XX)

Provisional Intelligence Reports (CIA/RR PR-XX)

Economic Intelligence Reports (CIA/RR ER XX-XX)

• Project Action Memoranda (Project No. XX.XXXX)

Addendum to 3 October 1997 ADD Watch List: JFK Assassination Records

Section III. B. Key Subjects [items two and three]:

-- CIA anti-Cuban operations 1960-64 (Mongoose, Bay of Pigs, Cuban exile organizations, etc.).

( Although much anti-Cuban material may be considered ancillary or not related to the assassination

(1963 documents are considered directly relevant), a significant amount of this material has already

been reviewed and released under the JFK Act. For example: the Kennedy Administration's Cuban

National Security File(over 23,000 pages) was reviewed by a joint DO/HRP/ARRB/ STATE/DOD

eam at the Kennedy Presidential Library under the JFK Act; the 3' Volume of the History of the Bay

of Pigs and the Bay of Pigs postmortem Taylor report and attachments have designated a

assassination records. ]
