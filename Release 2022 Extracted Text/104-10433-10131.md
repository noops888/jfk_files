Power advocate from the United States who arrived in

was not known whether he arrived before or after the
assassination. : i

The Special Branch advised our representative ;
in Kingston that it had learned that the group planned |
to send a small delegation to the area near the i
American Embassy around noon on 8 April to see whether 1
they could start any disturbances. The group had
considered stoning the Embassy, but gave up this idea.
The Black Power advocate from the United States is
reported to have commented that since the Government-
of Jamaica is in complete sympathy with Dr. Ming, it
will be Cifficult to get demonstrations started. The

take any uction. The police are expected to have a
stand-by force to mest any adverse development, and
