By memorandum dated 7/30/75, you were advised of the
initial request from the House Select Committee and of the fact
a briefing concerning general budgetary matters was being ar-
ranged for Committee Staff Members Richard-Verneire and’

James. B. F. Oliphant. 5

At 4 p.m. on 7/29/75, Messrs. Oliphant ‘and Vermeire
were given a briefing relating to the Bureau's budget cycle
by Assistant Director Eugene W. Walsh. They were informed of
the step-by-step process the Bureau uses in submitting budget
requests to the Department and ultimately from the Department
to the Office of Management and Budget and the Congress.
Numerous questions were asked relating to the procedural views
on the Bureau requests, the types of material used to justify
budgetary requests and, in general, the format of our budget
presentations to the Department ‘and the Office of Management
and Budget. These questions were answered to the Staff Members" ai
satisfaction.

A discussion was. had concerning the FY77 Spring

Planning Call. This document sets forth the guidelines the

epartment.set for the format of our budgetary requests.

Mr. Walsh ‘also discussed generally our response to that

request | entitled the "FY Spring Planning Call--Fiscal

Spring." They indicated an interest in obtaining copies of

the aforementioned documents. It was. explained that in the
existing procedures set forth by the Department of Justice

such material could only be made available pursuant to a
request by the Committee and after obtaining Departmental
authority. ‘They stated they were. under severe time. con-
straints to obtain budgetary information for the Committee.
‘Vermeire indicated that Elmer Staats, the head of GAO, would

be testifying on 7/31775before the Committee concernitHg~tHre—= ome

RE: HOUSTUDY

stated a letter had been sent requesting this testimony by the
Committee. They were informed the Bureau had not received this
request as yet and that depending on the nature of the infor-
mation sought during the briefing it could well place the Bureau
in a position of not having the data available for testimony in
this area. They appreciated our position in this matter.

During the briefing they were also advised that three
schedules entitled “FBI Manpower Resources, FY 1965-1974," "FBI
Financial Resources, FY 1965-1974," and "FBI Case Load Status,
FY. 1965-1974" had been prepared for the GAO and Mr. Walsh ex-
plained generally the background to the preparation of these
schedules. The Committee staff members requested that they be
given a copy of this schedule. They were informed that subject
to the approval of the Attorney General these schedules would be
made available for their review. They were asked whether they

{could limit their budgetary request for the past ten years as
opposed to fifteen years as set forth in their request of 7/22/75.
Oliphant ‘and Vermeire indicated that this was acceptable with
them; poet: they would have to obtain the approval of Chair-
man: Pike.

Mr. Walsh-asked, and Vermeire and Oliphant agreed, that
he would be able to review the transcription of notes which the
Committee Staff Members took during this briefing to insure
accuracy.

“Vermeire and Oliphant were advised by SA Daly who was
preserit during the briefing that they had not ‘received security.
. Clearances. because ‘of a procedural problem and that in view of
that ‘their access to. classified material could not at this time
be. granted (the background concerning this problem as set forth”
in’ metiorandum dated’ 7/30/75).

‘ received by. the morning of. August'’6,. 1975, ‘the Chairman in-
tended’ to issue subpoenas.

Mr. Hotis ‘told Mr. Shaheen that it would be impossible
to. comply with ‘all the requests. ‘on such ‘short not: The letter

RE: HOUSTUDY

Shaheen also said that he is presently. drafting a letter
to. Chairman Pike concerning thé request ‘in the July’ 22 letter for
all. documerits furnished the Senate Select Committee. _He ‘said that -
\ the Department ‘is considering several alternative replies, one of

which is to suggest ‘that Chairman Pike ‘attenipt ‘to. obtain these
petri from the Senate Select ‘Committee. In the meantime, he
said, we should not attempt ‘to. comply with ‘that request.

Latex that afternoon, Mr. Hotis and Section Chiefs
Clyde Groover and Bill’ Cregar met with Shaheen and Steven
Blackhurst,: Deputy Special Counsel for Intelligence Coordination,
in an effort to. determine the ‘Departments position on these
‘xequests, Shaheen said he felt that the ‘letter of July. 22,.
setting forth a general request for all documents ‘provided’ to.
. the Senate Select ‘Committee , was ‘superseded by. the July 28
letter and does not ‘require ‘a response, Mr. Blackhurst ‘said
. Field asked that we give prompt attention to Items C, D, E, F
(3 and 4); and G in the July 28 letter. . Field requested that
. he be given access to. this information prior to the hearings on
Thursday,. August'-7. It was pointed out that some of the infor-
| mation, such ‘as informant payments. and the ‘cost effectiveress of
| . the informant program, is impossible ‘to retrieve. Shaheen’ said
. that we should make a good-faith effort to comply and if it was
| not possible ‘to. do so’, we ‘should discuss: thé matter with ‘the Com-
mittee Staff. . He also said that if the Staff Members go. beyond
mere ‘access and ask for. delivery of such materials ‘to the Commit-
tee, these ‘requests must be ‘subniitted in writing by: the Chairman.

With ‘regard to the ‘letter of July. 30, Shaheen said the
Deputy. Attorney General had instructed that’ ‘the materials re-"
quested in the first paragraph be furnished to the Committee as
soon as possible. These included: (1). the Spring Planning Call
submitted to the FBI by. the ‘Department ‘of Justice; (2). the Spring
- Planning Call response ‘serit ‘by. the FBI to. the Department;. and (3)
the ten-year, budget ‘charts. ‘indicating resource allocations.

The ‘letter also requested a briefing by Mr. Groover on
. budgetary matters. Shaheen said that if Staff Members ‘inquire
about ‘any particularly sensitive matters they should be ‘told to.
. submit ‘their questions in writing. It is possible that ‘such ‘in-
formation may. be made available to the Committee at a later time
in Executive ‘Session,. upon approval. by the Department..

Mr. Shaheen also said that we ‘should attempt ‘to furnish ”
all budgetary information already provided to GAO pursuant ‘to.
its ‘investigation for the House Judiciary Committee, but ‘it is
not necessary to Meet ‘the. ‘August’ 6. deadline.

Reference is made to memorandum Walsh to Mr. Jenkins
dated 8/5/75, and my memorandum to you dated 8/6/75 concerning ir

captioned matter.

As you know, the Computer Svs tems.Division.has been requested
tq furnish responses to questions raised by the House.Select Committee in
categories F(4), Hand J. On 8/6/75 our response to category F (4) was.
submitted to the Administrative Division. The purpose of this memorandum’
is to furnish material and information for responding to categories H and J. L

T

Category H involves the House Select Committee's request for _cx-
all data pertaining to Confidential Funds.and the payment procedures relating
thereto. Following @ discussion with representatives of the Committee, the
Administrative Division has advised that in response to this category only
material relating to procedures for developing and paying informants is to.
be furnished. Sections 107, 108, and 130 of the Manual of Instructions cover:
the Bureau's procedure. for developing.and. paying informants. Sections 107
and 130 have been furnished to the Administrative Division by the
Intelligence Dini. Copies of Section 108 relating to criminal informants
are enclosed with his, memorandum for forwarding to the Administrative
Division. In my menforandum to you on 8/6/75, it was recommended that
information madejayaatable to the House Select Committee covering policies
and procedures darren to the Confidential Fund be the same.as.that

Memorandum Neudorfer to Decker
RE: HOUSTUDY

enclosed copies of this material for use in responding to the Committee.
It is felt that the three sections of the Manual of Instructions plus the
material that we furnished to the Department will suffice as a response
to the Committee on the Bureau's policies and procedures for developing
and paying informants.

With reference to category J, which covers the Committee's
request for information on all payments and breakdgyn théreof made to
persons outside the FBI with respect fo intelligence and countefintellige rintelligence
activities, the Computer Systems Division will not be able to respond
because such information is not available from the payment records that
we maintain. The payment documentation does not indicate whether a
particular payment to a person was for intelligence-and/or counterintelligence-
type activities. Any possible payment of this type made by our Field Divisions
would be included in the monthly report entitled, "Confidential Fund and
Informant Report” under the category of Miscellaneous Expenditures. It is
also possible that payments of this type could have been made by FBIHQ. In
order to accurately respond to this request, all miscellaneous expenditure
payments made by the Field Divisions as well as payments made by FBIHQ
covering the designated period of time would have to be manually searched
and compared with background material relating to the authority for such
payments. Since the Computer Systems Division does not have the
responsibility. for authorizing confidential payments, this analysis therefore
would have to be made by the appropriate Investigative Division and the
Intelligence Division. If it becomes necessary to go to this extent in
responding to this category, the Voucher Unit of the Data Processing Section
would conduct the survey to locate all possible payment records that might be
involved and made such records available to the appropriate Division for
analysis purposes.

RECOMMENDATION:

That this memorandum with enclosures be forwarded to the
Administrative Division for their use in responding to the House Select
Committee.



SECTION 108, CRIMINAL INFORMANTS EEEEER "1084 = D

dual who furnishes valuable information within our criminal
investigative jurisdiction or concerning other criminal matters of
interest to the Bureau

+ Be ILLUSTRATICN

This type informant includes members of the underworld, those who closely
associate with criminals or have intimate knowledge of criminal activities.
Typical examples of such persons are madams, prostitutes, pimps, fences,
con men, hijackers, robbers, burglars, hoodlums, gangsters,and those
individuals who asso te with or have knowledge of such persons.

Cc. OBSERVATION 7
The listing of an individual as an approved Bureau informant is dependent
upon whether he or she can regularly furnish valuable criminal information,
In most instances an individual will be approved who has:
1. Furnished worth-while information in two or more Bureau cases
2, Purnished worth-while information in one Bureau case and better than
C avexage information{relating to criminal intelligence investigations ]
3, Furnished worth-while information in at least one Bureau case and in :
one other state or local case which is acted upon by the responsible
authorities so as to obtain corroboration of the. informant's report
4, Furnished worth-while information in at least oné Bureau case and in
one other Federal case which is acted upon by the interested Federal
agency, so as to obtain corroboration of the informant's report

De. DEVELOPMENT OF CRIMINAL INFORMANTS

1. One of the most important responsibilities of an Agent is the identi-
fication of prospective criminal informants and the development of pros—
pective informants to the point where they will regularly contribute
information to the Bureau,

2. Criminal informants are used to:
&@ Solve cases
be ivedte fugivives anu witnesses
Co Report cases we would not otherwise receive
d, Report plans to commit offenses
e. Advise of general criminal activities

3. informants are developed from those who'volunteer to be of assistance;

7 from subjects in cases investigated; from persons interviewed during

; investigations; and from selected prospects who are clearly in a posi-

. tion to obtain worth-while information, Their development frequently
requires patient, protracted effort to find a basis for persuading
them to cooperate in furnishing information,

4. Care must be exercised in attempting to persuade individuals to act as
informants to avoid any allegations of undue influence, An individual
who is in custody and who offers to furnish information generally does
so in the hope that he will receive some consideration in return,

Bureau Agents cannot promise any immunity or any reduction in sentence
to a criminal who furnishes information and they must not put themselves
in a position where they might subsequently be accused of having done so.

5, Once an individual has started to cooperate and furnishes information
of value, his continued cooperation can frequently be assured through
payments for services rendered and information furnished, There should
be no reluctance in recommending substantial payments to informants who
supply substantial assistance, if such payments are necessary to obtain

. the assistance,

6. Another. important factor in the initial problem of getting a potential
informant started is the appreciation for fair and impartial treatment
sometimes generated during the handling of a case, Agents must be alert
to recognize such feelings on the part of subjects and to capitalize on
them, Should a subject indicate in any manner that he is appreciative,
and should he be qualified to act as a real informant by virtue of his
background and associates, then affirmative action should be taken to re—
contact him at frequent intervals fully to explore his potentialities.

10. After an informant: has been déveloped, and unless. some reason to the
contrary exists, his fingerprints are to be obtained if they are not
on file in the Identification Division. If the informant refuses, the
| issue is not to be forced. The informant's fingerprints, obtained
7 solely for this purpose, are to be removed from the criminal files when
the use of the informant is discontinued. A flash notice is to be placed
by the field in the files of the Identification Division by submission of
form FD-165, using informant's true name for each informant who has
fingerprints on fileo In order to eliminate the possibility of jeopardizing
the security of Bureau informants, the word "Informant" should not be
indicated in blank ballot box on FD-165~ It should be noted the informant
file number serves as an indication to the Identification Division of the
typé of flash notice desired.
(Do not use form FD-9 to request an identification record on informant;
FD-165 is to be used for this purpose.) The informant's PBI Identification
Record number should be included in the Secure Teletype designating a
symbol number informant. Informant's fingerprints, when obtained, showld
be forwarded as enclosure to FD-165 using applicant-type fingerprint card,
FD-258. This cara should be properly executed showing subject's complete
description, including dete and place of birth. Appropriate field office
should be shown as contributor, field case file number in number space,
and "inquiry" in space for “company and address" on face of card. The
flash should be removed when the informant is discontinued by submission
of FD-165,
11. When subjects in Bureau cases are sentenced to the penitentiary, consider-
ation should be given to the possibility that these subjects may be used
as criminal informants upon their discharge. If there are any possibilities
of eventually developing one or more subjects as potential informants upon
their release, forward a letter to the Bureau requesting thai a stop
notice be placed with the Bureau of Prisons so that the appropriate office
will be advised of the subject's release. The procedures to be followed
in raqnesting such a stop-notice be placed are set out in Section
8, part II, Manual of Rules and Regulations, under the, heading "Stop
notice. Upon notification of subject's release, steps can then be
taken to attempt to develop him as a criminal informant.
¢ [Requests of informant to help defend others
ae If requested to assist in preparation of defense in criminal-type
cases or handle assignment where such information is readily
available, informant should tactfully dec]
be Such requests should be reported immediately to contacting Agent
and made a matter of record.
c. If informant cannot avoid becoming involved, instruct him not to
report any information pertaining to defense plans or strategy.
d. Promptly report any such incident to Bureau.
e. If an informant is present in conversation between an attorney
‘and individual under criminal indictment, he should immediately
leave. If he is unable to do so and inadvertently learns of defense
plans or strategy, he is not to report the substance of any such
convérsation to the FBI. Additionally, the informant is not to
engage in or report the substance of a conversation with a criminal
defendant dealing with the offense for which the defendant is under
indictment.
f. Each handling Agent must orally advise the informant of the above, .
reduce it to writing and record it in the informant's file.)

{ [13.] Parolees

As a condition of parole, which would include a conditional release,

an inmate is required by U. S. Board of Parole to agree in writing that
he will not ect as an “informer" or special agent for any law enforcement
agency. This condition applies to all releasees under the jurisdiction
of the U. S. Board of Parole. While this procedure would not preclude
accepting information from these persons, payments for information.
should not be made without prior Bureau approval. Once the period of
parole has expired, these individuals may be considered for development.

E, PROCEDURE IN LISTING POTENTIAL CRIMINAL INFORMANTS AND CRIMINAL INFORMANTS
1. Before opening a 137 file on an dividual to be. considered for
development as a potential criminal informant, the following elements
must be present:
a he individual under consideration must have been contacted at least
once to evaluate his potential.
*b. The individual must have an arrest record or criminal associates or
“be engaged in employment or activities (past or present) which make
eriminal information Logically available to him.
2. When a prospective informant is identified: .
a. Consolidate field office references in 2 file.
be Obtain ell readily available background data, FD-356 must be used in
any routine check pertaining to informants making sure 211 references,
such as symbol number, which would tend to identify individual as an
informant are deleted,

co, Obtain current FBI identification record by FD-165 which will also
be used to place a flash notice against his fingerprints if aveilable.
a. Reauest summary of additional information in Bureau files but not
aveilable in field office. Specifically state reason for belief
Bureau files contain additional information.

3. vhon a potential informant has furnished worthwhile information in
accordance with the provisions of section C above, a symbol number should
be assigned. Dircet u sccave teletype of mut more © two fuLi pages in

"$700 stolen watches recovered"), If, as in the case of local, state,
or other Federal violations, there is no case title, this information
may be omitted; however, the description of the statistic should
include enough information to identify the type of violation (such as
"John Green arrested for local burglary" or "$475 stolen hams recovered
from local burglary"). If two or more statistics result from one in~
formant on one case, list the statistics separately opposite the in-
formant (such as "subject arrested on narcotics chargee $700 narco-
tics recovered").

on a criminal informant. The danger to be recognized and guarded against
is that routine, everyday contacts with cri L informants will result
in a relaxing of our vigilance to protect in: ants. It must always

be remembered that one slip or one misstatement may cause a criminal info:
ant to be killed.

Where prosecution is contemplated in a rmietter in which information has
been received from an informant and the USA can give no assurance of his
ability to protect the informant's iden no further action is to be
taken until the Bureau can be advised and the case can be discussed with
the Department,

informants should furnish information to *he Pureau exclusively. If under
unusual circumstances they find necessary +9 furnish information +o
representatives of some other agency or org anization, be certain that they
will first advise the Bureau of their intention to do so,

Informants should conZine themselves to matters within the Bureau's primary
investigative jurisdiction so.far as it is possible to do so and should

-not become involved in procuring evidence regarding violations not within

the Bureau's primary investigative jurisdiction. Debrief 211 informants
and sources on at least a monthly basis regarding their knowledge of
narcotics activities.

Criminal informants should. be cultivated on Government reservations when
the investigative problems warrant this action but do not develop inform-
ants among active duty military personnel.

The office supervising an informant must furnish to any other office
using him a summary of information as to the informant, such as de-
scriptive data, mode of travel, criminal background, an up-to-date
identification record, and any other information pertinent to the
assignment.

All pending informant files are to be reviewed personally by appro~
priate supervisory personnel on a regular periodic basis not to exceed
7 days This review must include the informant's file and its sub-
iles. :

” L SECTION 108. CRIMINAL INFORMANTS ° ae

If at any time regular payments are being made to an inrorment, it appears

that the information being received or services being performed are not rar

commensurate with the amount being disbursed, the payments should be )

adjusted or discontinued immediately. t must be recognized that a good ie
informant can often obtain pertinent infor: a matter of hours

or days which would require much more time, if it could be obtained at all,

by an Agent conducting investigation. Payments should be gauged by the

following:

a. How much is it necessary to pay the informant to obtain the needed
information? 7

>. How much would have to be paid to another informant to obtain the
same information?

ce. How much salary would be paid to an Agent during the time it would
take him to obtain the same information? i

Paid informants should not be paid for information they furnish to any

other individual or agency.

Informants must also be instructed to report payments they receive as a

bart of their income when making income tax returns. See section[107L) 7

for additional instructions on income tax returns applicable to informants.

Receipts

a. Receipts for payments to informants and sources should be obtained in
every instance where possible to do so. ZT? a receipt cannot be is
obtained for a particular payment, complete circumstances should be
set forth on the blue slip at the time reimbursement is claimed.

Receipts should be self-sufficient so that, if it is necessary to
introduce receipts in evidence during course of a trial, receipts
will not relate to other documents or files.
b. These receipts should clearly show:
1) Date of payment
2) Period for which made (when informant paid on a period basis)
3 Total of payment broken down into separate amounts for services
or expenses where these items are pertinent
(4) Name of Agent making payment
(3) Signature of person receiving vhe money }

ce. Receipts are not to be witnessed by another Agent. .

a. If necessary to make corrections on the receipts, such corrections
must be initialed by the informant and not by the Agent.

e. When transmitting receipts and itemizeé statements of expenses to the
Bureau, they should be stapled directly to the blue slip, leaving a
margin of at least one inch to one ané one-half inches at the top to
avoid contact wi x The staples should be
Placed in such a menner that the de x data appearing on the
receipt will not be mutilated and all tion on the receipt can
be easily read without detaching it from %t blue slip. Care must
be taken to insure that receipts are of such a nature that they clearly
record the payment of money and do not refer to any other documentary
material contained in Bureau files, .

K, DEPARTMENT POLICY AND OPINION
fhe Department has issued instructions to tell all USAs that informants of
the Bureau shall not be interviewed or subpoenacd without prior consent of the
Department. Any deviation from this policy should be immediately brought to
the Bureau's attention. :

On 7-10-52 the Department furnished an opinion regarding the question whether
an informant could be prosecuted for technically violating the law while
attempting to obtain evidence regarding a Federal violation, The Department
stated "...if the intent throughout was to assist the government agents in
the enforcement of the law, and not to violate or to ‘cover-up! for a vio-
lation of the law, it is not believed a case for prosecution could be made
against such an informer...."

"The procedures to be followed by informers working under the supervision

of your agents in the aid of enforcing the statutes coming within your jurisdic—
tioi largely rests upon your sound discretion....It is not believed that an
informer would be otherwise immune from prosecution for actions which would
subject a Federal enforcement officer to prosecution." .

L. TOP ECHELON CRIMINAL INFORMANT PROGRAM :

1. The top echelon criminal informant program is aimed specifically at developing
informants who can provide a continuous flow of quelity criminal intelli-
gence information regarding the leaders of organized criminal activity
throughout the nation. It is directed at developing informants in the
following categories:

a. Informants who ere members of La Cosa Nostra (LCN)

b. Informants who can furnish significant information regarding other
organized criminal groups

ce. Informants at the top level of organized gambling activity who can

P de information that will enable the Bureau to effectively

enforce the anti-gambling statutes

2 Eat 4vS who Can produce accurate and authentic date regarding the
extent of graft and corruption in each sector of the nation

e. Informants who can furnish information which will enable the Bureau
to prosecute the hoodlum hierarchy

2. The development of informants who can provide information of this caliber
is mandatory to insure the Bureau meets its commitments.

3. This program calls for the selection of targets for development. The
selection should be based upon a combination of 2 particular hoodlum's
qua, cat s by virtue his position in the organized hoodlum element
ang upon circumstances indicating his possible susceptibility to development.
To insure maximum security for an individual under development, he should
be assigned a cymbol number immediately upon being designated for attention.
The symbol number for these individuals ‘should be followed by the suffix
PC to insure that they will be distinguished’ from regular criminal
informant. The Bureau should be promptly advised whenever an individual
is added or deleted from your program.

4, When requesting authority to add a target, include sufficient data in
a[UACB]communication to indicate(that]the individual is a logical
choice for inclusion in your program. [For purposes of security, this
initial communication should always be transmitted by secure teletype and
should}include such data regarding the proposed target as a complete
description, [a summary of hisJarrest record, and information indicating
that{he has ]Jaccess to significant information[{conceyning ]top level
racket figures, Insure that the program is not diluted by reauesting

t authority to add targets who[should Jmore appropriately be considered PCIs.
S. A penetrative investigation of each individual selected as 2 target

should be conducted prior to any approach of the individual. After
completion of the penetrative investigation, reauest the Bureau to approve
the interview of the target. The letter requesting such authority should
set forth the approach to be utilized in the interview, A full exploi-
tation must be made of any circumstances which place a target ina

position whereby he will assist the eau, In making a determination
te an appropriate approach, all possibilities should be thoroughly exp

6. The requirement of obtaining Rureau authority to conduct interviews is
restricted to informant development interviews an& does not preclude
interviews conducted in connection with other investigations,

7. <Advise the Bureau at a minimum of every 90 days of progress in attempting
to develop each target designated for attention. Include positive inforna-
tion in summary form and also set forth your contemplated plan to effect
the cocperation of the target. In subsequent communications point out the
result of action taken and in the event your contemplated plan was not
productive or feasible, aévise of your alternate plan. Also include the
specific number of times the top echelon source was contacted oy the
alternate Agent as well as the Agent to whom the case is assigned ard set
forth’ data regarding corroboration of the source's information.

8. A letter should be directed to the Bureau when an individual under
development furnishes sufficient information to qualify him as a top
echelon informant. This letter should follow the same format used to
designate regular criminal informants, and the suffix of the symbol number
should be changed to C~fB in accordance with subsection G, item 12, of
this section,

9. Every effort must be made +o insure the potential of each top echelon
informant is fully utilized to the Bureau's advantage. Be particularly
alert to the possibility of utilizing informatio from member-informants
in LON to further penetrate LCN.

10. Justification letters are to be submitted regarding top echelon inform-
ants, except those on a regularly paid status, on a triannual basis.
Offices Albany through Newark should forward these letters by February 1,
June 1, and October 1. Offices New York through Washington Field should
submit these letters March 1, July 1, and November 1. Prepare these
letters in the same manner as annual letters for regular criminal inform-
antSe

11. Following the initial teletype communication, care should be exercised to
make certain that subsequent cormunications to either the Bureau or other
field offices containing information which may jeopardize the informant's
identity are sent by secure teletype.

12. AS in the payment of criminal informants, SAC may approve advances to
echelon informants or targets under developnent for expenses in obtai:

: information, for the performance of services, or for information on a

| -C.0.D. basis up to $400 initially. Several payments or advances may be

i made undex this same authority until the sum of such payments or advances

aggregates $400. [All future requests for renewal of SAC authsrity to

pay top echelon informants and targets within the Top Echelon Criminal

Informant Program should be submitted to the Bureau on a "UACB within

' seven calendar days'' basise All_additional authorizations should be
requested in increments of $600.]

7 _ 13. For other regulations concerning the handling of top echelon criminal
informants and targets, be guided by instructions set out above for
regular criminal informants.

Me. PARPICIPATION OF AGENTS E

On March 31 of each year furnish the Bureau a list of Agents in the office

who have been assigned to criminal pubes pees matters 50 percent or

more of the time during the previous year (excepting Agents assigned

primarily to accounting investigations) and have not developed an informant
or have not effectively operated an informant, during the same period, which *
they previously developed. The SAC is to provide an analysis of each listed
Agent's performance and furnish as an attachment to the list explanations
secured from all listed Agents, along with recommendations for administrative
action.

. ,(D) “SECURITY INFORMANTS - CRIMINAL INFORMANTS - PAYMENTS -- A sit= |
uation recently arose whereby an informant ccmplained that he signed
receipts fcr money which he did not receive from the contacting
Agent, It developed that the Agent was in the habit of obtaining
a receipt for a specific Bureau-authorized’ amount, but if in the
opinion of-the Agent the informant did not deserve the full amount,
only a part of the authorized sum would be furnished to the informant
f at the time the receipt was obtained. The Agent would then deposit
to’ his own persenal account the sum which he had not given to the
informant with the idea in mind of later furnishing to the informant’
from his personal account an appropriate sum when he felt the-
informant deserved the additional money. As a result, confusion
arose as to whether the informant received’the fully authorized sum.

This type of operation, of course, results in falsificatio:
of records and. is highly imprcper. The handling of Government funds
is a serious responsibility and all employees should exercise good
judgment at all times, Whenever anyone in the Bureau's service is
charged with the duty of handling Government money, the rules and
regulations in connection therewith must be strictly followed. If
a@ receipt is obtained from an informant, or anyone else, the
vévipient mast be paid in fuli in accordance with the receipt.

I want each Special Agent in Charge to review carefully
the methods presently in operation-in his Division concerning the
handling of the confidential fund, particularly as it relates to
i- informants, and make certain that disbursements and receipts are
rt being handted in the proper fashion,

7 You are reminded that the proper maintenance and handling
of the confidential fund is your personal responsibility and it is
fu imperative that the Bureau's regulations be. followed explicitly.

In specific instances in which it is necessary and ex- .
pedient to expend money to obtain information concerning matters - .
or persons under investigation which is not otherwise obtainable ~
or to advance expense money to enable an individual to obtain such,
information, SAC may now approve such payments to a single individual
of amounts un to $200 and totaling not more than $200 on a c.o.d.
basis regardless of the numeer of payments, This applies only ‘to
individuals who are not’ bei regularly paid for services or éxpenses

INFORMANTS -- You are reminded of the need to closely follow matters
involving payments to informants to insure that the Bureau is getting full
value for money expended and that the record shows complete justification
for all payments made. =

Requests for authority to pay informants must be supported.
by a summary of the information previously furnished in sufficient detail
to allow an intelligent analysis at the Bureau. The communication should
also show anticipated future coverage informant will provide and an
appraisal of the informant's value. You should also outline the nature of
the expenses incurred by the informant for which payment is being
requested. Payments for services must be made ona strictly c.o.d.
basis, and_pavments for € expenses can only cove only cover TGxDenses. actually _

incurred by the infor for_the Bureau.

The present Bureau system regarding the authorization
of payments to informants affords close supervisory control in the field
and ct ihe Seai of Guveimaeit. I expeci supervisory and investigative

(H) RACIAL INFORMANTS - RACIAL MATTERS -- Recently there “nan, BY é
were held at the Seat of Government specialized conferences concerning [pie
militant black nationalist investigations and racial informant matters.

These conferences were attended by representatives from key field os
offices handling the major poriion of the Bureau's work in this field. ’

The conferees were unanimous in their observation that
money is the primary motivating force in developing racial informants.
In view of this, they recommended that each Special Agent in Charge be
given authority to expend up to $400 in the development of racial
informants instead of the $200 the majority of Special Agents in Charge-

+ may now expend on their own authority.

Tconcur with this recommendation of the conferees and .
effective March 15, 1968, the Special Agents in Charge of all field
“divisions are authorized to expend the sum of $400 in the development
of racial informants. In this connection, you are reminded that money
expended for informant development must be on a-c.o.d. basis and full
value must be received in proportion to the amount of money expended.
Appropriat Manval change will be forthcoming.

SECURITY INFORMANTS AND SOURCES - PAYMENTS -- As you
are aware, all security informants and sources receiving compensation
from the Bureau are paid on the basis of the value of information
furnished, services rendered and incurred expenses. Recently, it has
been noted that some informants and sources have been paid consistently

| the samé amount each month with no variation in payments during
periods when the informants or sources were less productive, which
leads to the illogical implication that information furnished or expenses

.\ incurred or both seldom, if ever, vary. - This practice must be
discontinued. Your informants and sources must understand they are
independent contractors remunerated on a C.O.D. basis, and they must
never be led to believe they are recipients of a fixed salary.,

This matter will continue to receive careful consideration
at the Seat of Government and you will be held accountable to insure
that payments are for value received and no fixed patterns continue to
develop. These instructions should be called to the attention of all
Special Agents in your office handling Saeco informants and
sources.

(B) SECURITY INFORMANTS - SUBMISSION OF JUSTIFICATION
LETTERS<-~ Effective immediately justification letters for security
informants should be submitted each six months instead of each four
months as was previously required. Current authorized payments for
four months should be considered extended to six months from the
effective date. Under item four, requiring a "summary of information
furnished and/or services rendered during pertinent period," you
should henceforth include a brief statement as to what coverage or
information furnished is available only from that source. In the event
« . there_is none, a specific statement to that effect should be sei out.,

: As I have previously emphasized, it is the responsibility

» of each Special Agent in Charge io insure all expenditures for information

"are onac.o.d. basis commensurate with the value of the information.
Excessive coverage of routine matters resulting in unwarranted
expenditures for the same information must not be approved. Good
judgment must be exercised and, where possible and warranted, efforis
of established informants must be directed into areas where increased

“““eoverace is needed, such as the New Left and other radical subversive
groups. You must not be complacent with mere numbers but take
positive steps to insure your coverage of subversive groups is suf-
ficiently flexible to adequately meet the. Bureau's responsibilities in this
constantly changing field.

Appropriate manual changes will follow.

(B) INFORMANTS AND SOURCES - PAYMENTS -- As you are aware
. informants and sources receiving compensation from the Bureau are
reimbursed on the basis of the value of the information reporied,
services performed and expenses incurred. An increasing tendency
has been observed in field submissions to request special payments or
_ justify regular payments for informants or sources seemingly based
.on personal needs cf the informant as distinct from the value of infor~
mation furnished and legitimate and related expenses incurred. The
personal needs of an informant, such as repair of a vehicle, illness
.or other pressing necessity for funds, do not meet the basic criteria -
of information furnished or related expenses. Informants should not
be influenced to believe we.will pay for such personal needs. The
basic concepi that the informant is selling information of value ona
c.0.d, basis’, much as an independent contractor, and is not an
employee must be adheredto and understood by contacting Agents and
the informants.

- This does not, however, preclude use of imagination and in-
novation wien a source of consider2hle potential value needs financial
inducement to engage in gathering of information under conditions which
will take time to reach fruition and may involve considerable risk and
hardship. In such instances you should fully develop the facts and
present them to FBIHQ for approval prior to making any commitment,

This matter will continue to receive caréful attention at FBIHQ:
and you will be held accountable to insure:that payments are for value
received, These instructions should be called to the attention of all
Special Agents in your office handling informants and sources. .

Dear Sir:

In connection with expenditures of a confidential nature
for which reixbursezent is claimed by blve slip, youare advised that
. ‘| ‘such expenditures must be ited strictly to investigative cases _
of major importence wherein monies may be paid to confidential
i : inferrants or for confidential purposes, reimburserent for which

i could not be claimed by regular personal service voucher without:
jeopardizing the successful completion of the investigation,

You are, therefore, advised that it will not be neces—
sary to continue the retention of copies of confidential blue
“slips in the various field division files, The present field
,blue slip files should be forwarded to the Washington head-
quarters of the Bureau under personal and confidential cover,

The Bureau is particularly desirous at the present time
,of again bringing to your attention the absolute necessity for the
continued careful handling of expenditures from the confidential
fund and the submission of monthly reports in connection therewith,

You are aware, of course, that under existing Bureau regu-
lations it is absolutely essential that an appropriate statement be
submitted at the end of each month reflecting the condition of the
confidential fund in each field office, including therein its status
with respect to the cash balance on hand, plus disbursements which
have been made during the current accounting period. -

Many of the field offices have in the past failed to sub- - if
mit such monthly statements pr as a consequence of which it
is becoming increasingly diff: properly audit the Bureau's
records in connection therewith or to otherwise maintain an accurate
record upon the tasis-of waich the accounta’ ity of each Special
Agent in Charge may be definitely determined.

In this connection, a review of blue slip items received at
the Bureau over.a veriod of time reflects an increasing number of pay- 7
ments in the nature of so-called “advances" to confidential inform-
ants. The same is true of "deposits" with electric light companies’
and other utilities, which deposits usually range in amounts from $10
to $20. At the time the monthly statement is submitted by the field
office involved, such statements invariably fail to indicate that the
expenditures in question were "advances" or "deposits," the amounts
of which are to te subsequently refunded and returned. In other in-
stances-they are icproperly recorded in such a manner as to precluda Ha

are to be listed. A411 subsequent monthly statenen "prepared by

your office should de submitted strictly in accord 2 therewith.
It is further noted that in a great number of cases

Special Agents have not been submitting receipts to Justify the
expenditures for which reimbursement is being claimed through blue
slips. For instance, subscriptions to various newspapers and peri-
odicals subscribed to by the year have been observed with no re-
eeipts therefor having been secured. It is believed that such
items, wherever practicable, should be paid for by the issuance of
a@ money order and the money order receipt attached.

In addition, the failure to obtain receipts has: been par-
ticularly prevalent in respect to payments made for services ren
dered by confidential informants, for expenses incident to the rental
of rooms, and the obtaining of keys, locks, et cetera, and other
items of 2 relate d nature where a receipt could, reasonably be secured.

" Although che Bureau is necessarily aware of the fact that
receipts canhot be secured in each and every instance, due to exi-
gencies peculiar to certain types of investigative activities,
nevertheless, it must insist that such receipts be obtained for
confidential expenditures wherever it is possible and otherwise

racticable to do so. Hereafter, confidential items will be sus-
pended from the accounts in question unless the expenditures in-+
volved are: properly supported by the necessary receipts.

.. Likewise, the Bureau has noted with considerable concern
increased purchases in the form of furniture, bedding, clothing, and
related items utilized in the conduct of various plants and other
confidential investigative activities. is is of particular sig-
cance in that such items are being paid for through the submis-
sion of blue slips, and the non-expendable items are not being ‘taken
up properly on the field office inventories. Accordingly, it is
desired that you forward to the Bureau in the near future a detailed
report indicating the type and quantity of such equipment purchased
and presently in use in order that same may be properly inventoried
on the Bureau's records. Such an inventory should, of course, be
maintained simultaneously by cach of the respective field offices
having control, custody, or possession of such equipment. With
reference to future purchases of this kind, the field offices will
be held strictly accountable for the submission to the Bureau of
appropriate non-expendable receiving slips. Such slips should indi-
cate that the item was purchased through the submission of blue
slips. The Bureau will maintain a check on blue slips submitted
and suspensions from the vouchers will be made in those instances
where-field--offices—rail -to-submit non-expendable receiving. Slips

It is desired that you give the matters outlined herein
your immediate personal attention and supervision: It is expected
that in the future there will be strict compliance with the foré-
going instructions in order that the correction of these delinquen-
cies may be logically concluded with a minimum of delay.

You are aware that under existing Bureau regulations it is absolutely
essential that an aypropriate statement be submitted at the end of each month
reflecting the condition of the Confidentiel Fund in each field office, including
therein its status with respect to the cash balance on hand, plus disbursements
which have been made during the current accounting period. 7

Many of the field offices have in the past failed to submit such

mtkiy stetecents promptly, as a consequence of which it is becoming increasingly
* difficult to properly audit the Bureau's records in connection therewith. As
: set ont in SAC Letter No, 23, dated April 4, 1950, ell Confidential Fund rerorts
should be received at the Bureau no leter than the 20th of the following month.

” For your guidence in the preparation of future xonthly reports concern-
ing Confidentiel Fund enditures. there is enclosed a sample form which outlines
briefly the proper method of prep g the report. In addition, there is enclosed
a semple form which outlines the metnod which should be used to summarize the .  ~

* payments to inforrenta and confidential sources. In-this regard your attention
is directed to Section (A), SAC Letter No. 23, deted April 4, 1950, which is
revised in that the Atomic Energy informants should be deleted from the report.
The swrary should now reflect payments to Criminal and National Defense
Confidential Sources. 7 :

(C) CONFIDENTIAL FUND VOUCHERS -< Tt has been noted in a number of
instances that the receipts which support the Blue Slips submitted
by the Special Agent in Charge reflect the name of a Special Agent
as the person making the payment, :

Effective immediately, you are instructed that in any in-
stance where the receipt reflects paymen ait wade py a Special Agent,
the Special Agent snould also execute a receipt reflecting that he
received the money from the Special Agent in Charge for the purpose
of payment to the informant and both receipts should be attached to
the Blue Slip,

that payments made by the Special Agent from his personal funds
must be vouchered by him as a confidential item on his regular ex-

RE: CONFIDENTIAL FUND ;
iG PROCEDURES - ial

BOOK

c After reviewing the reports of the accounting procedures
presently being followed by the various field divisions which were
forwarded to the Bureau in response to SAC Letter 54-8, Paragraph D,
and from a review of the suggestions submitted along with these
reports, it has been determined that a uniform procedure for handling
the operations of the Confidential Funds maintained by the various
field divisions should be established. :

Effective July 1, 1954, the following accounting
procedures shall be placed into effect for each office maintaining
: a Confidential Fund:

7 1. A ledger page similar to Exhibit Number Cne shall be
used to reflect any transactions that would affect the amount of
the fund authorized for the field division. Transactions that
wouid affect this fund are:

a. Temporary or permanent increases in the fund.

“bd. Refunds of all or part of payments made to an
informant for which the office has been reimbursed by
the Bureau. .

: EEE c. Refunds to the Bureau of temporary increases
7 ; and refunds received from the informants in cases
5 7 similar to "b" above, :

This ledger page should also reflect a rupning. balance
of the total amount to be accounted for by the field division.
This is the amount that should be reflected on the monthly report
of expenditures from the Confidential Fund as the total amount to
be accounted for,

2. A cash receipts and disbursements page. shall be .
utilized to reflect all cash transactions which affect the total
fund. This ledger shall be in accordance with the attached sample
(Exhibit Number Two), which reflects examples of various transactions
which will affect the Fund. This ledger should be retained indefi- meee
nitely and should be used as the basis for the preparation of the

NW 68262 Docid:32989707 Page 126 i . zs =



| _monthly report, All: columns should be ruled off at the end of the
calendar month and the cash balance brought forward. Column Number
One should reflect all cash receipts and disbursements, The debit
side of Column Number Two (2a) should reflect all expenditures from
the Fund except any refunds made to the Bureau. All payments made
to criminal informants and sources should be reflected in the
column captioned "Criminal;" all payments to security infcrmants

or sources should be reflected in the column captioned "Security; "
and all payments of the miscellaneous nature not covered by either
of the afore-mentioned categories, such as payments to telephone
companies, taverns, restaurants, post office box: rental, etc.,
should be reflected in the column captioned "Miscellaneous." The
credit side of Column Number Two (2b) should reflect all refunds
from payments previously made regardless of whether the previous
payment. was of a criminal, security or miscellaneous nature.
-Column Number Three should reflect all transactions with the Bureau;
checks in payment of vouchers and temporary or permanent increases
should be reflected in the “Receipts” column; whereas any ~

refund from an informant, source or of a miscellaneous nature which
must be returned to the Bureau because the payment hes already

been vouchered, should be reflected in the "Refunds" column. Like-
wise, any temporary increase returned to the Bureau should be
recorded here, (Note entries, Exhibit Number Two.) *
: In view of the foregoing,.you will note that for every
entry in the Cash Disbursements column, there should be a corre-
sponding entry in one of the debit columns, i.e., in either the
Criminal, Security or Miscellaneous columns, or in the Refunds to
Bureau column. Likewise, for every entry in the Cash Receipts
column, there should be a corresponding entry in‘one of the credit
columns, i.e., in either the Refunds: of Payments column or in the
Receipts from Bureau column.

i — It is to be further noted that the totals of Column

. - Number 2a will be of assistance in the preparation of the "Sum-

‘ mary of Payments to Informants" in connection with the monthly
. report. ine amount of cash on hand can always be determined by

subtracting the total of the credit side of Column One from. the

total of the debit side of this column.

-3. An individual ledger page should be set up for each
paid informant and for each paid confidential sources. This section
of the ledger should be divided into three parts; namely, Criminal
Security and Miscellaneous,

The Criminal section of the ledger should contain a
separate page for each paid criminal informant and each paid
eriminal confidential seurce, The Security section should reflect

iS - Jaan eee eeeee



[Nw 68262 Docld:32989707 Page 128

a separate page for each paid security informant and each paid-
confidential source, Under the Miscellaneous section, pages
should be set up for rental of space for plants or surveillances,
regular monthly telephone bills that are paid from the Confidential
Fund and any other such payments that would be made on a regular

‘basis, Occasional payments, such as payments to taverns, restau-

rants, rental of safe deposit boxes, etc., may be included on a
single page as the expenditures ccme up. A sample cf an informant
page is attached (Exhibit Number Three), It is to be noted that
this page reflects the following information:

. the date of authorization
. the authorization

» period covered by payment
. Gate of payment

« amount of payment

oAerM

In connection with the date of authorization, you are
instructed that this date should be the date of the Bureau's letter
to the field division in cases where authorization is made by
Bureau letter and the date of the incoming letter when authorization
is made by stamping "approved" on a tickler copy of a letter
received from the rield division requesting’ authority.

Before making any disbursements from the Confidential
Fund to an informant, the authorization should be checked ts be
sure that there is not a duplicate payment being made and that the
period covered by the payment is in agreement with the existing
authorization. These authorizations should be posted in the
ledger at the time they are received from the Bureau. In connection
with SAC authorized payments, a notation to the effect that payment
is-being made under authority of the SAC will be sufficient.

After July 1, 1954, the present serial in the informant's
file (FD-228) reflecting payments made to the informant up to‘that |
date should be maintained in the exhibit envelope. On July 1, 1954;
form FD-228 should be removed from your’ form: book and your supply
destroyed. : .

4, After a careful review of the many suggestions received
in response to SAC Letter Number 54-8, a form (FD-235) for request-
ing funds from the Confidential Fund has been designed, a copy of
which is attached. You may print a supply of this form for use in-
your office, -FD-235 is to replace any similar form that may have
been approved for your office. 4 copy of FD-235 is to be placed in
the FBI Form Book. This form should be prepared in duplicate by
the Agent requesting the funds, and after approval by the Agent
Supervisor, the form should be forwarded to the Sac for his approval

6/9/54
NO” NUMBER
SAC LETTER HO, 54~G -3-

oe = : 2 =



NW 68262 Docld:32989707 Page 129

before any disbursement is made frem the Confidential Fund. After
approval of the form by the SAC and after the employee handling
the disbursements frem the fund has ‘carefully verified that the
payment is in accordance with existing authority, one copy of the

‘form should be forwarded to the informant's file and the second

copy retained in an accounts receivable file which should be
divided inte two sections; namely, an unvouchered file ard a
vouchered file. These forms can be used by the employee responsible
for disbursements from the fund as the basis for preparing blue
slips for submission uo the Bureau. Of course, these blue slips
should not be prepared until such time as the receipt from the
informant is obtained from the Agent making the payment, and in
those ‘cases where necessary, that FD-221 has been executed by the
Agent making the payment. At the time the voucher is prepared, those
forms pertaining to the voucher that is being submitted should be
attached to the tickler copy of that vcucher after it has. been
prepared and retained in the accountS receivable file until rein-
bursement is made, by the Bureau, At the time reimbursement is
received, the voucher should be removed together with the attach-
ments and a notation made on the vcucher of the date reimbursement
was received from the Bureau. The Request for Funds forms attached
to the voucher may then be destroyed. In the event an item has
been suspended from the voucher and returned to the Pield office,
it would be necessary to remove the Request for Funds form from

the voucher cn which the blue slip was requested and returned to
the unvouchered file until such time as it is resubmitted or it is
determined it will not be resubmitted,

‘5. Monthly Report. As you are aware, the monthly report
of expenditures from the Confidential Fund is presently prepared
and submitted to the Bureau by the twentieth of the month following
the period ‘during which the expenditures were made, These reports
should continue to be submitted at this time; however, changes in

.. the present form for this report have been suggested and after a

review of the various suggestions received, it is felt that the 7
reports should be prepared in accordancé with the attached example
(Exhibit Number Five), The monthly report submitted to the Bureau

" should be prepared under the direct supervision of the Special

Agent in Charge, Assistant Special Agent in Charge or a regularly
Gesignated Field Supervisor, ‘he fund should be audited once-each
six months, on June 30 and December 31. This audit shall be
personally performed by 2 Special Agent Accountant. The report, of
this audit shall be forwarded to the Bureau by the twentieth day of -
July and the twentieth day of January. In those instances where

the Confidential Fund is audited by an Inspector from the Training
and Inspection Division during a. regular inspection, the next

- regular six months' audit shall be omitted by the Special Agent

Accountant of the Field Division.

With regard to the summary. of expenditures section of
the Confidential Report, it is desired to illustrate the following
points:

. a. All transactions cue ape the ite aaa 7
I month should be shown, ‘ :

b. All items should be listed in order by
date and by check number. pata

¢. -The explanation should reflect the
. hame and symbol number of the informant as
well as the period covered by the payment and
- "in case of miscellaneous expenditures, a brief
ee to describe the expenditure,

! “a. Any transaction that affects the He
feat . total amount of the fund.to be accounted for oe

must be fully explained in a cover memoran~ oa

dum. An example of such a transaction would

be a refund received from an informant for
* payment which had already been reimbursed by

the Bureau. Any such: refund, if not already

aaa forwarded to the Bureau, should be transmitted

| with the report. :

: In connection with the summary of payments to informants.

j you are advised that all miscellaneous payments must be listed
separately from payments made to informants or sources of informa-
tion. This breakdown should include such payments as post office
box rental, telephone service, rental of space for plants, bank
charges, restaurants or taverns on surveillances, meals for
prisoners, etc. In other words, all payments not made to informants
or to sources for information furnished for services rendered or
expenses incurred by them should be ineluded under miscellaneous

| +, expenditures,

6. Preparation of Blue Slips. As was pointed: out here-
tofore, the blue slip should be prepared from the Request for Funds
form with the exception that the date of actual payment toithe
informant should be shown on the blue slip. This date should be
obtained either from the Agent making the payment or the receipt
obtained from the informant. A blue slip should be prepared at
.such time as all receipts necessary to support the item have been
received from the Agent making the payment. :

All blue slips should be as brief as possible, but
should contain sufficient information to allow the Bureau to make
a proper review of the expenditures. Samples are attached
reflecting payments made to informants under Bureau authority

(Exhibit Number Six), SAC auithority (Exhibit Number Seven), and
miscellaneous expenditures (Zxhibit Number Eight). These samples
are general but should be used as a guide for preparing all blue
slips. In addition to the attached samples, it is desired that
the following be kept in mind in connection with the preparation
of blue slips:

&. One blue slip should be used for each
payment. It is not desired to have numercus
payments listed on a single blue slip in view
of the possibility of error which would result
in the necessity .of suspending the entire blue

: slip; whereas if only one payment were listed
on the blue slip, it would be possible to re-
turn only the one item and the remaining items
could be processed for payment.. «3

b. The authority must be clearly reflected
‘on the blue slip. When authority is based on
the letter from the Bureau, actual date of the
Bureau letter shall be used as the date of the
authorization, Then the field office, by letter,
requests authorization and receives notice that
authorization has been granted in the form of a
copy of the field office letter returned by the
Bureau with the Bureau approval stamped thereon,
the date of the authorization in this instance
shall be the actual date of the field office let-
ter to the Bureau requesting the authorization.

e,. The actual period of time covered by the
payment to the informant must be reflected in the .
body of the blue slip. For example, see "Period"

—reflected in body of Exhibit Number Six. It is
also essential that the period covered be carefully
compared with the Bureau authorization to prevent
exceeding the Bureau authorization, pcth by time
and amount. Receipts should be obtained Whenever
possible, In instances where they are not obtained
either because of the refusal of the informant to
execute one or when it is not advisable to obtain
one, the appropriate notation should be reflected

| on the blue slip.

d.° FD-221 which is a receipt signed by the
Agent reflecting receipt of money from the SAC is
only to be used when ‘the receipt signed by the
informant reflects that payment was made by the Agent.

6/9/54

|W 68262 Docld:32989707 Page 131



e. In all instances where the receipt. signed
by the informant reflects yment was made to him
by the Special Agent in Charge, reimbursement must
be claimed on a voucher of the Special Agent in _
Charge. If the receipt reflects payment was madé
to the informant by the Assistant Special Agent in
Charge, then reimbursement must be claimed on a
voucher of the Assistant Special asent in Charge.
In instances where the receipt reflects that payment
was made to the informant by someone other than the
Special Agent in Charge or Assistant Special agent
in Charge or where there is no payor designated, the

on blue slip may be submitted fcr payment on the
voucher of either the Special Agent in Charge
or the Assistant Special Agent in Charge. When
the receipt reflects that payment was made by a
person other than the one claiming reimbursement,
Form FD-221 must be executed and attached to thé ~
-blue slip. It is advisable to have the inform-
ant's: receipts’executed in the name of the
employee actually making payment or in blank in
order that the Special Agent in Charge or the
Assistant Special Agent in Charge may claim
reimbursement.

-f. ‘The Blve slip should not reflect the
number of the check issued and no reference
should be made on the blue slip to the inform-
ant's: field file number.

&. All blue slips submitted on the monthly
expense vouchers of Spe Agents must bear the
approval of the Special Agent in Ch e@; however,
the Special Agent in Charge may delegate authority
to the Assistant Special Agent in Charge or an

s approved field office supervisor to sign his name
as approving official fcllowed by the initials of
the Assistant Special Agent in’ Charge or the
supervisor, ’

h. Receints obtained by personnel which
reflect payments to infor ts and sources should
reflect the ACTUAL DATZ payment is made to the
informant or source. The receipt should in no 7 .
instance reflect any other date. The Receipt
should also show the EXACT AMCUNT paid to the
informant or source, ‘and every Special Agent sub-
mitting receipts should thoroughly understand
this -procedure, : 7

i. All vouchers containing blue slips must
be forwarded to the Bureau. addressed to Assistant
Directcr, Administrative Division, Attention:
Voucher Unit. They must be sent via-registered
mail, return receipt requested and cannot be
intermingled with other mail. Confidential Fund
monthly reports should also be submitted in this
manner to the Bureau, .

7. Miscellaneous, It is desired to bring the following
miscellaneous, items to your attention:

- a. When submitting blue slips ‘covering
payments to informants from another field
division, the informant should be identified
on the blue siip by indicating his name » symbol
number and field division,

b. The words Confidential Fund should never
‘pe inentioned on a blue Slip. When claiming for
bank charges, the blue slip should reflect pay-
ment to an official of the bank by name for serv-
ices rendered,

oe ce. Payments under the authorization of the
SAC are limited te $200.00 to eriwinal iaformants
and sources; and to $100.00 to security informants
and sources, This maximum is considered as all
payments made to an individual regardless of the
length of time between payments. Once an inform-
ant has been paid under Bureau authority, pay-
ments cannot be made under the authority of the
SAC even in instances where the informant has been

discontinued as a regularly paid informant,

a. The ledger page that is used in Exhibits
One, Two and Three is size 9°1/4 x 11 7/8 inches;
and for Exhibits Number Cne and Three, foqur-column
paper is used, and eight - column paper for Exhibit
Number Two, The type of binder that should be
used for this paper is described as follows:
Trussell Sectional Post Binder; Stock #£4007; sheet
size, 9 1/4 X 11 7/8 inches; post diameter, 5/16
inches; center to center, 71/8 inches. This
ledger paper and binder should be purchased locally
from the Imprest Fund, and in those instances where
the offices do not have an Imprest Fund, by emergency
purchase,

The foregeving tuetruttions have been set forth for ine
handling of the Confidential Fund in your office. These instruc~
tions have been prepared for all field divisions and no deviations
will be permitted without prioP Bureau authority, This letter

MEMORANDUM FOR ALL BUREAU OFFICIALS AND SUPERVISORS

(A) CONFIDENTIAL EXPENDITURES -- I want to draw to your attention
the absolute importance of making certain that any confidential
expenditure authorized by the Bureau complies with existing Manual
provisions and that the Bureau receives appropriate value for
every dollar expended, Although it is the personal responsibility
of each Special Agent in Charge to make certain that full value

is received in the field, it is equally the responsibility of Seat
7 of Government employees to be judicious in authorizing expenditures
i bo be made and to practice proeser econiny, 7

For your information, Inspectors will, in each field
office inspection, review in the neighbcrhood of one hundred blue
. Slips to determine the propriety of each expenditure and will trace
‘ through the files information received and results obtained,
following the expenditure and, if necessary, follow it through
with appropriate employee interviews with the understanding that
in the event an expenditure is encountered which -is not proper
the employees involved will reimburse the Government,

Very truly yours,
John Edgar Hoover

RE: CONFIDENTIAL FUND -
ACCOUNTING PRCCEDURES

Reference is made to No Number SAC Letter 54-G which
set out accounting procedures to be followed in the one teeee of
the Confidential Fund.

The Bureau is now in receipt of a suggestion which it
is felt will eliminate scme duplication of work in connection
with the establishment. of these accounting procedures. The sug-
gestion was based upon the necessity of an employee's determining
whether payments to infcrmants on SAC authority are in excess
of the §200,00 amount for criminal informants and the $100.60
“amount for security informants, It was suggested that the in-
formants! files be checked and the amount paid prior to July 1,
1954, be entered on the informants! individual ledger pages.

This would apply only to payments made under SAC authority.

. It is felt that this suggestion will save considerable
time and work in the field. and you are accordingly instructed
to put it in effect with the establishment of the new accounting
procedure, :

Very truly- yours,
John Edgar Hoover

BEUE SLIPS

ee In the preparation of future blue slips, the
: - following instructions should be adhered to: :

The blue slips should show the correct name of
the individual being paid. Any difference between this and
the name used by the informant in signing a receipt for
payment must be explained on the blue slip. When a name
other than the individual's full correct name is used in
initial development as an informant, his full correct name
ghould be used on the blue slip as soon as it is known,
together with references to the previous names used in
poneacss and payments by your office.

| The above procedure is necessary to enable the
4 Bureau to prorerly contrur payments and to make sure that
all payments to one individual are consolidated. It has
been noted in some instances that blue slips are submitted
showing the full name and on subsequent payments they are
submitted showing the individual's middle namé as a last

“name, This is especially true in connection with Spanish
names. This practice leads to the possibility of carrying
&@ separate account of psyments under each name.

Hake sure that the necessary employees of your
office are aware of thls and the need for consistency.

In addition ,where an informant or individual
Imown to have been formerly contacted by another “division
is paid by your division, the blue slip claiming reimburse-
ment should refer to the-fact that he is formerly from the
other division, This is necessary to insure that the
. Bureau's accounts of payments are properly credited for
payments made.

The Eile has noted that in many instances the
field is not following instructions concerning the forward-
‘ Mg Of vouchers containing confidential items (blue slips)
ist to the Bureau. The Manual of Rules and Regulations, Part II,

: 8/12/58

vouchers containing confidential blue slips must be sent
by Registered Mail, Return Receipt Requested, the inner
envelope addressed to the Assistant Director, Administrative
Division, Federal Bureau of Investigation, Attention Voucher
Unit. Monthly reperts of confidential expenditures must be
handled in the same manner. The envelope should not be

. marked Personal and Confidential. You should bring this
matter to the attention of all employees responsible for
handling the mailing of these items.

KONTHLY REPORTS OF CONFIDENTIAL EXPENDITURES

In examining the above-captioned reports, the
Bureau has noted that-the field is not being consistent
in the way the expenditures are summarized on the last
. page. Some reports include payments made to PCIs or PSIs
with those to "Sources." Payments to PCIs or PSIs should
be included with “Informants" and not with "Sources." Only.
those payments made to Confidential Sources, Panel Sources,
and Sources of Information should be .included under
"Sources" in vhe summary, bake sure that une persons

Analysis has been made of forms used in connection with informants
(racial, criminal, security) and it has been decided that in order to
give tighter security to these forms, form FD-221a be changed as
follows.

In the future in filling owt the above form you will utilize
* the informant's symbol designation rather than his true name. No
change is being made in present procedures for handling Forms FD-37,
FD-221 and informant receipts. The matter concerning security for -
