Memorandum from Legal Counsel to Mr. Adams •

Re: HOUSTUDY 75

House Committee will first explore the fiscal aspects

of executive branch intelligence expenditures, the

accountability, command and control of these expendi-

tures.

Chairman Pike intends to convene hearings

lauring the first two weeks of the August 1975 recess.

Representative Robert MCClory (Illinois),

Committee ranking minority member, noted he also in-

tends to investigate individual agency mandates, the

Reference is made to memorandum Walsh to Mr. Jenkins

captioned matter.

As you know, the Computer Systems Division has been requested

to furnish responses to questions raised by the House select committee in

categories F(4), # and J. On 876/75 our response to category F (4) was.

submitted to the Administrative Division. The purpose of this memorandum

is to furnish material and information for responding to categories H and

Category H involves the House Select Committee's request for

all data pertaining to Confidential Funds and the payment procedures relating

thereto. Following a discussion with representatives of the Committee, the

Administrative Division has advised that in response to this category only

material relating to procedures for developing and paying informants is to.

be furnished. Sections 107, 108, and 130 of the Manual of Instructions cover:

the Bureau's procedure for developing and paying informants. Sections 107

and 130 have been furnished to the Administrative Division by the

Intelligence Division. Copies of Section 108 relating to criminal informants

are enclo

are enclosed with this memorandum for forwarding to the Administrative

and procedures pertaining to the Confidential Fund be the same as that

Memorandum Neudorfer to Decker

RE: HOUSTUDY

enclosed copies of this material for use in responding to the Committee.

It is felt that the three sections of the Manual of Instructions plus the

material that we furnished to the Department will suffice as a response

to the Committee on the Bureau's policies and procedures for developing

and paying informants.

With reference to category J, which covers the Committee's

request for information on all payments and breakdown thereof made to

persons outside the FBLwith respect to intelligence and counterintelligence

activities, the Computer Systems Division will not be able to respond

because such information is not available from the payment records that

we maintain. The payment documentation does not indicate whether a

particular payment to a person was for intelligence-and/or counterintelligence-

type activities. Any possible payment of this type made by our Field Divisions

would be included in the monthly report entitled, "Confidential Fund and

Informant Report" under the category of Miscellaneous Expenditures. It is

also possible that payments of this type could have been made by FBIHQ. In

order to accurately respond to this request, all miscellaneous expenditure

payments made by the Field Divisions as well as payments made by FBIHQ

covering the designated period of time would have to be manually searched

and compared with background material relating to the authority for such

payments. Since the Computer Systems Division does not have the

responsibility for authorizing confidential payments, this analysis therefore

would have to be made by the appropriate Investigative Division and the

Intelligence Division. If it becomes necessary to go to this extent in

responding to this category, the Voucher Unit of the Data Processing Section

would conduct the survey to locate all possible payment records that might be

involved and made such records available to the appropriate Division for

analysis purposes.

RECOMMENDATION:

That this memorandum with enclosures be forwarded to the

Administrative Division for their use in responding to the House Select

Committee.

CRIMINAL INFORMANTS

1084 - D

DEFINITION

An indiridual who furnishes valuable information within our criminal

investigative jurisdiction or concerning other criminal matters of

interest to the Burezu

" Ba

ILLUSTRATICN

This type informant includes members of the underworld, those who closely

associate with criminals or have intimate knowledge of

criminal activities.

Typical examples

are madams, prostitutes, pimps, fences,

con men,

hijackers, robbers, burglars, hoodlums, gangsters, and those

individuals who associate vith or have knowiedge of such persons.

C.

OBSERVATION

The listing of an individual as an approved Bureau informant is dependent

upon whether he or she can regularly furnish valuable criminal information.

In most instances an individual will be approved who has:

rurnished worth while intormation in tho or more Bureau cases

Furnished worth-while information

in one Burezu case

average informationirelating to criminal intelligence investigations ]

Furnished worth-while information in at least one Bureau case and in

one other state or local case which is

acted upon by the responsible

authorities so as to obtain corroboration of the informant's report

Furnished worth-while information in at least one Bureau case and in

one other Federal case which is acted upon by the interested federal

agency, so as to obtain corroboration of the informant's report

DO DEVELOPMENT OF CRIMINAL INFORMANTS

One of the most important responsibilities of an Agent is the identi

fication of prospective criminal informants and the development of pros-

pective informants to the point where they will regularly contribute

information to the Bureau.

Criminal informants are used to:

Solve cases

¿ iuuare ingivires and mibnesses

Co Report cases we would not otherwise receive

a. Report plans to commit offenses

3.

Advise of general criminal activities

Informants are developed from those rho volunteer to be of assistance;

from subjects in cases investigated; from persons interviewed during

investigations; and from selected prospects who are clearly in a posi-

tion to obtain worth-while information.

Thear development frequently

requires patient, protracted effort to

find a basis for persuading

them to cooperate in furnishing information.

4.

Care must be exercised in attempting to persuade individuals to act as

informants to avoid

any allegations

of undue influence.

who is in custody and who offers to furnish information generally does

so in the hope that he will receive some consideration in return.

Bureau Agents cannot promise any immunity os any reduction in sertence

to a criminal who furnishes information and they must not put themselves

in a position where they might subsequently be accused of having done so.

5,

Once an individual has started to cooperate and furnishes information

of value, his continuea

cooperation can frequently be assured through

for services rendered and information furnished.

There should

be no reluctance in recommending substantial payments to

informants who

supply substantial assistance, if such payments are necessary to obtain

the assistance.

6.

Another important factor in the initial problem of getting a potential

informant started is the appreciation for fair and impartial treatment

sometimes generated during the handling of a case.

Agents must be alert

to recognize such feelings on the part of subjects and to capitalize on

a subject indicate in any manner that he is appreciative,

and should he be qualified to

act as a real informant by virtue of his

background and associates, then affirmative action should be taken to re-

contact him at frequent intervals fully to explore his potentialities.

an informant could be prosecuted for technically riolating the law while

attempting to obtaiz evidence regarding a Federal violation. The Depariment

PAYVENTS TO CONEIDENTIAL INFORMANTS - The Bureau has received inquiries

regarding the amount a Special Agent in Charge nay approve paying an informant.

mithout prior Bureau authority.

You are

advised you may approve payment of an amount up to 950 to an

informant in a specific instance for information

submitted.

The blue slips

subnitted for claiming these payments must clearly and adequately explain the

circumstances and sumarize the information obtained so the Bureau will be in

a position to intelligently pass such slips for payment, receipts to be attached

wherever possible.

This does not change the present instructions that prior Bureau author-

ity must be octained before paying an informant on a regular basis at a rate

exceeding $10 per month, but applies only to specific instances in wich it is

expedient or necessary to expend money to obtain information concerning matters

or persons under investigation which information is not otherwise obtainable.

This oê course does not apply to expenditures for entertainment. You will be

held responsible to insure the Bureau receives full value for all the money

expended by you and such matters must receive your personal attention and ap-

proval.

(C) CONFIDENTIAL INFORNANTS - Full coverage of all our investigative activities

must be maintained and the use of paid confidenvial informants

is necessary.

With-

out a constant and careful check of the production of these paid informants, it is

possible that full value will not be received for the services rendered.

You are instructed, therefore, to personally review all reports submitted

by paid confidential informants either National Deîense or General Investigative

to be certain that they are providing information commensurate with the amount of

money being paid to them.

If it is determined after a personal check of each paid

confidential informant that the Bureau is not receiving an adequate return, pay-

ments should be immediately discontinued and the Bureau advised. Likewise, if

you feel that any informant's compensation snould be adjusted based upon a de-

crease of his activity, a summary should be furnished to the Bureau together with

your racommondations concorning a chango in payment to him.

After you have completed this check of all paid confidential informants..:

you should continue to affora this matter your personal attention to insure the

Bureau at all times receiving a full return for any money paid to informants.

"SECURITY INFORMANTS - CRIMINAL INFORMANTS - PAYMENTS -- A s1t=

uation recently arose whereby an informant complained that he signed

receipts for money which he did not receive from the contacting

Agent.

It developed, that the Agent was in the habit of obtaining

a receipt for a specific Bureau-authorized amount, but if in the

opinion of. the Agent the informant did not deserve the full amount,

only a part of the authorized sum would be furnished to the Informant

The Agent would then deposit

to his own personal account the sum which he had not given to the

informant with the idea in mind of later furnishing to the informant

from his personal account an appropriate sum when he felt the

Informant deserved the additional money. As a result, confusion •

arose as to whether the informant received the fully authorized sum.

This type of operation, of course, results in falsification

of records and. Is highly improper..

The handling of Government funds

is a serious responsibility and all employees should exercise good

judgment at all times.

Whenever anyone in the Bureau's service 1s

charged with the duty of handling Government money, the rules and

regulations in connection therewith must be strictly followed. If

a receipt is obtained from an informant, or anyone else, the

sceipient must be paid in full in accordance with the receipt.

I want each Special Agent in Charge to review carefully

the methods presently in operation in his Division concerning the

handling of the confidential fund, particularly as it relates to

informants, and make certain that disbursements and receipts are

being handled in the proper fashion.

You are reminded that the proper maintenance and handling

of the confidential lund is your personal responsibility and it is

Imperative that the sureau's regulations be followed explicitly.

(H) RACIAL INFORMANTS - RACIAL MATTERS -- Recently there

These conferences were attended by representatives from key field

offices handling the major portion of the Bureau's work in this field.

Alrea

Life:

The conferees were unanimous in their observation that

money is the primary motivating force in developing racial informants.

In view of this, they recommended that each Special Agent in Charge be

given authority to expend up to $400 in the development of racial

informants instead of the $200 the majority of Special Agents in Charge

• may now expend on their own authority.

I concur with this recommendation of the conferees and

effective March 15, 1968, the Special Agents in Charge of all field

divisions are authorized to expend the sum of $400 in the development

of racial informants. In this connection, you are reminded that money

expended for informant development must be on a c.o.d. basis and full

value must be received in proportion to the amount of money expended.

(D) SECURITY INFORMANTS AND SOURCES - PAYMENTS -- As you

are aware, all security informants and sources receiving compensation

from the Bureau are paid on the basis of the value of information

furnished, services rendered and incurred expenses. Recently, it has

been noted that some informants and sources have been paid consistently

the same amount each month with no variation in payments during

periods when the informants or sources were less productive, which

leads to the illogical implication that information furnished or expenses

incurred or both seldom, if ever, vary. • This practice must be

discontinued. Your informants and sources must understand they are

independent contractors remunerated on a C.O. D. basis, and they must

never be led to believe they are recipients of a fixed salary..

This matter will continue to receive careful consideration

at the Seat of Government and you will be held accountable to insure

that payments are for value received and no fixed patterns continue to

develop. These instructions should be called to the attention of all

Special Agents in your office handling security informants and

(B) SECURITY INFORMANTS - SUBMISSION OF JUSTIFICATION

LETTERS-- Effective immediately justification letters for security

informants should be submitted each six months instead of each four

months as was previously required. Current authorized payments for

four months should be considered extended lo six months from the

effective date. Under item four, requiring a "summary of information

furnished and/or services rendered during pertinent period, " you

should henceforth include a brief statement as to what coverage or

information furnished is available only from that source. In the event

there is none, a specific statement to that effect should be set out..

As I have previously emphasized, it is the responsibility

of each Special Agent in Charge to insure all expenditures for information

are on a c.o.d. basis commensurate with the value of the information.

Excessive coverage of routine matters resulting in unvarranted

expenditures for the same information must not be approved. Good

judgment must be exercised and, where possible and warranted, efforts

of established informants must be directed into areas where increased

coverage is needed, such as the New left and other radical subversive

groups. You must not be complacent with mere numbers but take

positive steps to insure your coverage of subversive groups is suf-

ticiently flexible to adequately meet the Bureau's responsibilities in this

constantly changing field.

Appropriate manual changes will follow.

(B) CRIMINAL INFORMANT PROGRAM -- It is incumbent upon each

SaC to insure that all letters to the Bureau requesting authorily to

make payments to criminal informants clearly reilect the value of

information or service received that will fully justify any payments..

Recently, the Bureau has noted too many instances where the

value of informant's information has not been adequately set forth

causing additional correspondence. between the Bureau and the field.

• You must closely examine all future requests emanating from

your office to insure that adequate justification is provided the Bureau

in each and every instance.

(B) SECUPITY INFORMIANTS -- Section 107 N, 2, of the Manual of

Instructions authorizes an SAC to make payments up to $200 to security

informants on a c.o.d. basis. Effective immediately, this authority is

increased to $400 in order to be uniform with the amounts availabie in

criminal and racial informant cases.

You are reminded that this increased authority in no way

lessens your responsibility to insure that payments are on a c.o. d.

basis and full value is received.

Appropriate manual and handbook changes are forthcoming.

and the cost is estimated to exceed $100. brior Bureau authority must be

obtained and may be obtained on an expedite basis. You are reminded oi

the importance of maintaining special surveillance vehicles and equipment

in a secure manner to insure none of our surveillances are in any way

jeopardized. Existing regulations require that all radio-equipped

surveillance trucks be provided separate garage and storage treatment.

The desirability of maintaining other surveillance automotive equipment

separately from our normal equipment should be carefully evaluated.

Where circumstances dictate, such equipment should be provided the

same separate lacilities as is now required of radio-equipped surveillance

trucks. Appropriate manual changes concerning the rental of surveillance

equipment will be forthcoming.

(B) INFORMANTS AND SOURCES - PAYMENTS -- As you are aware

informants and sources receiving compensation from the Bureau are

reimbursed on the basis of the value of the information reported,

services performed and expenses incurred. An increasing tendency

has been observed in field submissions to request special payments or

justify regular payments for informants or sources seemingly based

- on personal needs ci the informant as distinct from the value of infor-

mation furnished and legitimate and related expenses incurred. The

personal needs of an informant, such as repair of a vehicle, illness

or other pressing necessity for funds, do not meet the basic criteria

of information furnished or related expenses. Informants should not

be iniluenced to believe we.will pay for such personal needs. The

basic concept that the informant is selling information of value on a

c.o.d. basis, much as an independent contractor, and is not an

employee must be adhered to and understood by contacting Agents and

the informants.

This does not, however, preclude use of imagination and in-

iúräuoi when a sourca of considerable potential value needs financial

inducement to engage in gathering of information under conditions which

will take time to reach fruition and may involve considerable risk and

hardship. In such instances you should fully develop the facts and

present them to FBIHQ for approval prior to making any commitment.

This matter will continue to receive careful attention at FBIHQ

and you will be held accountable.

to insure that payments are for value

received. These instructions should be called to the attention of all

Special Agents in your office handling informants and sources..

order to exercise adequate control of the overall expenditures of the Bureau, i

is necessary that the Administrative Division have an opportunity to review

confidential expenditures before final approval. This would include new

authorizations of payments to informants or sources; authorizations to increas

payments to regularly paid informants or sources; lump'sum or bonus paymer:

• to informants or sources; and any other unusual or special confidential

expenditures.

During the first nine months of fiscal year 1973, confidential

expenditures incrosaed a total ef $286, 475, or 2.3%, when compared to the en

. period in fiscal year 1972. Like all other expenditures, confidential espenditt

must be closely followed and controlled.

Since the Computer Systems Division is responsible for the recorr

keeping of confidential expenditures, copies of all authorizations for such

expenditures should continue to be sent to that Division but informational copi

of authorization memoranda for the Administrative Division are not necessary

RECOMMENDATION:

That proposed confidential expenditures for new payments to

Dear Sir:

In connection with expenditures of a confidential nature

for mich reimbursement is claimed by blue slip, youaro advised that

•such experditures must be liniteà strictly to investigative cases

of major importance imerein monies may be said to confidential

informants or for confidential purposes, reimbursement for which

could not be claired by regular personal service voucher without

jeopardizing the successiul comuletion of the investigation.

lou are,

therefore, advised that it will not be neces-

sary to continue

the retention of copies of confidential blue

slips in the rarious field division files.

The present field

blue slip files should be foriarded io the Washington head-

quarters of the jureau under personal and confidential cover.

Dear Sir:

It has been noted in connection with confidential

disburserents being made by special agents for which rein-

bursement is claired by blue slip that in many instances the

receip is executed in the name

of an agent or person other

than the agent claiming reirbarsement.

It is desired that inenever possible the receipt

be rade in the name of the agent iho pays the bill and inho

will claim reincursement. It is understocà that in all

instances this will noù se practical, for instance, if Agent

Smith rakes arrangements for the rental of an apartrent for

surveillance purposes and he is laver transferred from this

assignrent the bill ordinarily will be continued in his name and

paid by another agent.

In instances such as this the agent

who rays the bill should certify on the receipt that he per-

sonally paid same and that he is claiming reimburserent there-

the receipt is made out in the aame of an alias

being used by the agent this saci should be explained in the

blue slip.

In those instances where payment is made to an

intorant for services rendered over a definite period the

date of the beginning ard ending of the period shouta be

indicated on the blue slip.

This ratter should be brought to the attention of

all special agents under your supervision and the blue slips

sibmitted snould be carefully checked by you to see that they

conforn irith the above instructions.

Close attention to this

matter inll coviate the necessity for returning expense accounts

for correction.

Very truly yours,

John Edgar Hoover

The Bureau has noted an increasing trend on the part of Special

Agento in Charge of auproving confidericial expenditures which may at some

time be subject to question.

The Sureau refers particularly to those ei-

penditures nade by Special Agent personnel in the field service for enter-

tainment of confidential infordants.

It has been necessary for the. Bureau in the past to refuse to re-

imburse certain Agonts for expenditures made when it appeared that the ex-

penditures rade were out of line in so far as necessity for the securing..

of the

information was concerned. The Bureau has further noted a tendency

growing up in the field for Special Agents in Charge to approve conridential

expenditures for 10$ and l5$ and other very minor amounts which probably

should be subjest io further scrutiny by the Special Agent in Charge.

The Bureau must not at any time routinely consider confidential

expenditüres but sust insist that each Special Agent in Charge parscnally

review and approve such expenditures as are made by employees under his

It is understood that with the type of internal security

work presently ting performed by a great many Special Agents, certain

lances and like matters; horever, it shouid be understood that & Special

"The confidantial inforaation ites as above was paid in the

interest of the Governient service and that no other amount

has been paid lafore for the sage purpose, the amount repre-

Governent, and that the detailed information has been sub-

mitted and is now and will be held in the confidential files

of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and will be open to

inspection for any purpose by the representative of the Corp-

troller General at any time he say desire."

The Bureau will continue its present policy of returning to any

Agent without reimcursesent any confidential expenditure which does not ap-

pear to be fully and thoroughly justified. The Bureau must, of course, in-

gist on

each Special Agent in Charge naking it his personal responsibility:

to definitely ascartain that the expenditure has been proger

and that the expenditure of the funds in question has been of material bene-

PROVIDENCE

QUANTICO

The Bureau is particularly desirous at the present time

.of again bringing to your attention the absolute necessity for the

continued careful handling of expenditures from the confidential

lund and the subaission of monthly reports in connection therewith.

You are aware, of course, that under existing Bureau regu-

lations it is absolutely essential

that an appropriate statement be

submitted at the end of each month reflecting the condition of the

confidential furd in each field office, including therein lus status

with respect to the casn balance on hand, plus disbursements which

have been made during the current accounting period.

Many of the field offices have in the past failed to sub-.

mit such sonthly statements promptly, as a consequence of which it

is becoming increasingly difficult to properly audit the Bureau's

records in connection therewith or to otherwise maintain an accurate

record upon the basis of which the accountability of each Special

Agent

in Charge may be definitely determined.

In this connection, a review of blue slip items received at

the Bureau over a period of time reflects an increasing number of pay-

ments in the nature of so-called "advances" to confidential inform-

ants.

The same is true of "deposits" with electric light companies

and other utilities, which deposits usually range in amounts from S10

to 920. At the time the monthly statement is subnitted by the field

office involved, such

statements invariably fail to indicato that the

experditures in question were "advances" or "deposits," the amounts

of which are to be subsequently refunded and returned. In other in-

stances-they are improperly recorded in such a manner as to preclude

NW 68262 Docld:32989707 Page 103

---

## Page 104

=2-

an accurate accounting on the part of the Sureau

respect thereto.

For your guidance in the preparation o future monthly

reports concerning confidential fund expenditures, there is being

enclosed herewith a sample form which outlines briefly and succinctly

the menner in mhich discursements, zavances, refunds; or purchases

are to be listed. All subsequent monthly statements prepared by

your office should be submittea strictly in accordance therewith.

It is further noted that in a great number of cases

Special Agents have not been submitting receipts to justify the

odicals subscribed to by the year have been observed with no re-

ceipts therefor having been secured. It is believed that such

items, wherever practicable, should be

paid for by the issuance of :

a money order and the money order receipt attached.

In addition, the failure to obtain receipts has. been par-

ticularly prevalenü in respect to payments made for services ren-

dared by confidential informants, for expenses incident to the rental

of rooms, and the obtaining of keys, locks, et cetera, and other

items of

a related nature where a receipt could, reasonably be secured.

Although the bureau is necessarily avare of the fact that

receipts cannot be secured in each and every instance, due to exi-

gencies peculiar to certain types of investigative activities,

nevertheless, it must insist that such receipts be obtained for

confidential expenditures wnerever it is possible and otherwise

practicable to do so. Hereaîter, confidential items will be sus-

pended from the accounts in question unless the expenditures in-

volved are properly supported by the necessary receipts.

Likewise, the Bureau has noted with considerable concern

increased purchases in the form of furniture, beading, clothing, and .

related items utilized in the conduct of various plants and other

confidential investigative activities. This is of particular sig-

nificance in that such items are being paid for through the submis

sion of blue slips, and the non-expendable items are not being taken

up properly on the field office inventories.

Accordingly, it is

desired that you formard to the Bureau in the near fature a detailed

report indicating the type and quantity of such equipment purchased

and presently in use in order that same may be properly inventoried

on the sureau's records.

Such an inventory should, of course, be

maintained simultaneously by each of the respective field offices

having control, custody, or possession of such equipment. With

reference to future purchases of this kind, the field offices will

be held strictly accountable for the submission to the Bureau of

appropriate nor-expendable receiving slips.

such slips should indi

cate thai the iten vas purchased through the submission of blue

slips.

The Bureau will maintain a check on blue slips submitted

and suspensions frow the vouchars will be made in those instances

where-field offices-rail-to-submit non-expendable receiving slips.-

NW 68262 Docld:32989707 Page 104

Accordingly,

desired, that the non-expend

receiving slips.

• covering purch

es

of furniture, bedding, and

blue slips, be attached to the voucher when it is subaitted for

payment.

It is desired that you give the matters outlined herein

your immediate personal autention and supervision: It is expected

that

in the future there will be

strict compliance with the fore-

going instructions in order that the correction of these delinquen-

cies may be logically concluded with a minimum of delay.

The Bureau will not approve any

confidential expenditure made by any Special Agent of the Bureau unless such

an expenditure was made for the

purpose of securing information relating to

matters under the investigative jurisdiction of the Bureau, it not being pos-

sible to secure such information in any other manner.

In making such expenditures, all Special Agents must bear in mind

that repayment san be rade only in the event the certification can lu inião vicu

• the payment for such confidential information was made in the interest of the

Government Service, and that the amount paid represented expenditures incurred

in making corfidential investigations of alleged plots or conspiracies against

the United States Government or for the purpose of securing confidential in-

formation pertaining to violations of the federal Statutes which could not

otherwise have been secured. The infornation contained on the confidential

item sucmitted by the Agent in question should be such that it will be readily

FROM CONFIDERIAL, BURD

It has been noted that various officials and supervisors are granting.

authority to the fiela offices to make expenditures iron the field office

confidential fund. When Bureau authority has been granted for an experditure

of this nature, ine field office is required to give such auchorization on the

confidential item subnitted to reclaim the expenditure.

Numerous vouchers are being received by the Bureau wherein a reclaim is.

made for authorized expendijures. In checking the voucher against the file main-

tained in the Administrative Division, it is noted that in many instances there

will be no recora of the expenditure having been euthorized. •

In the future when authorization is granted for expenditures of this

nature, the Administrative Division must be auvised.

Is the field office is

granted authority by letter, a copy of the letter must be rade for the Chief Clerk's

Office, Room 5517.

If authority is granted telephonically, it will be necessary

that the official or supervisor granting the authority notify the Administrative

Division by remorandim, giving the name of the verson to whom payment is authorized

and the rielà office involvea.

The above instructions are to be placed into effect immediately in order

to preclude the delay which is now being experierced in determining nether the

expenditures claimed by the various offices "ere properly authorized.

RE:

ACTIVITIES OF THIS

CONFICENIIAL FUND

The Bureau is destrous at the present time of bringing to your attention

the absolute necessity for the careful handling of expenditures from the Con-

fidential Furd and the submiesion oi tonthly roports is conniculun sheriridi.

You are aware that under existing Bureau regulations it is absolutely

essential that an aypropriate staterent be submitied at the end of each month

reflecting the condition of the Confidential Funà in each field office, Including

therein its status with respect to the cash balance on hand, plus disbursements

which have been made during the current accounting period.

Many of the field offices have in the past failed to submit such

montany stateronts promptly, as a consequence of which it is becoming increasingly

difficult to properly audit the Bureau's recoras in connection therewith. As

set out in SAC Letter No. 23, dateà April 4, 1950, ell Confidential Furd reports

should be received at the Bureau no later than the 20th of the following month.

•For your guidence in the preparation of future monthly reports concern-

1ng Confidential rund exceraitures. there is enclosed a sample fom which outlines

briefly the proper mothod of preparind the report. In addition, there is enclosed

a sanple form which outlines the method which should be used to summarize tre

• payments to informanta and corfidential sources. In this regard your attention

15 directed to Section (A), SAC Letter No. 23, dated April 4, 1950, which 1s

rerised in that the Atonic Energy informants should be deleted from the report.

The surmary srould now reflect payments to Criminal and National Defense

Confidential Sources.

It has beel

bted that in a great number of

'stances Special Agents

have not been sumitting receipts to justify the expenditures for which re-

Imbursements are being claired through blue slips. Tire Bureau 1s awere of the

fact that receipts cannot be secwed in each and every instance, due to

exigencies peculiar to certain tipes of activities, nevertheless, receipts

should be obtained wherever

possible.

In connection with the preperation of the blue slips it has been

noted that some are being precared too much in detail. In those instances where

the pament is redo to an authorized reguler said informant, the followins

Incornation is sufficient to support the clein:

I, Amount of payrent

2.

Nare and symbol number of Informant

Cass

Date of authorization letter or teletype

5. Period of payment

A sample foru reflecting the proper method for preparing a blue sliv

is attached.

The Bureau has also noted in many instances that Agents, when re-

claiming suspended blue slips, are reflecting in the voucher that the item was

suspended fron a previous voucher. It is rointed out that no reference should

be made to the previous roacher nor should the igent state that the item was

suspended unless he forwards the original Stetement of Difference with he

Toucher.

Your attention is directed to the fact that the Bureau has only a

limited amount of funds available to operate the Confidential Funds of the

feld artIstons, therelore, you should take every eliort to operate on your

present fund.

It is cointed

out that a nore frequent submission of Confidential

Fund vouchers will held to maintair a higter balance in the fund.

In the future when an office desires to establish a Confidential

Fund, It will be necessary that the office furnish the Bureau full anù 'complet

justification.

It is desired that you give the matters outlined herein your

immediate personal attention and

supervision.

RE: CONFIDENTIAL EXPENDITURES

In reviewing the confidential blue slip vouchers that are

being fomarded to the Bustaù for rimbarcment, it is nuieu lau

considerable increases in such expenditures are

being made in ühe

divisional service at the present time.

It 1s entirely undersüand

able wny such increases are reflected in the vouchers in question

since every possible effort is being made by the fiela to increase

its informant coverage.

The bureau wishes to point out to you, however, that it is

your personal responsibility to see

• that such expenditures are totally

justified in every instance where made.

You should insure jourself

that the Bureau is receiving full value for the funds expended by it.

It is felt thai, if this matter is givén your continuous carerul ard

personal attention, no expendisures

will be made which can in any

way be criticized by any persons at

any future date.

(C.) CONFIDENTIAL FUND VOUCHERS It has been noted in a number of

instances that the receipts which support the Blue slips submitted

by the

Special Agent in Change reflect the name of a Special Agent

Effective Immediately, you are instructed that in any in-

stance where the receipt reflects payment made by a Special Agent,

the Special Agent should also execute a receipt reflecting that he

received the money from the Special Agent in Charge for the purpose

of payment to the informant and both receipts should be attached to

the Blue Slip.

This In no way alters previous instructions to the effect

that payments made by the Special Agent from his personal funds

MASIIINGTON 25, D.C.

RE: CONFIDENTIAL FUND

ACCCUNTING PROCEDURES -

FBI FORM BOOK

After reviewing the reports of the accounting procedures

presently being followed bj the various field divisions which were

forwarded to the Bureau in response to SAC Letter 54-8, Paragraph D,

and from

a review of the suggestions submitted along with these

reports, it has been determined that a uniform procedure for handing

the operations of the Confidential Funas maintained by the various

field divisions should be established.

Effective July 1, 1954, the following accounting

procedures shall be placed

into

effect for each office maintaining

a Confidential Fund:

1. A ledger page similar to Exhibit Number One shall be

used to reflect any transactions that would affect the amount of

the fund authorized for the field division. Transactions that

wuild affect this fund are:

a. Temporary or permanent increases in the fund.

'b. Refunds of all or part of payments made to an

Informant for which the office has been reimbursed by

the Bureau.

Refunds to the Bureau of temporary increases

and refunds received from the informants in cases

similar to "b" above.

This ledger page should also reflect a rupning. balance

of the total amount to be accounted for by the field division.

This is the amount that should be reflected on the monthly report

of expenditures from the Confidential Fund as the total amount to

be accounted for.

2. i

A cash receipts and disbursements page shall be

lutilized to reflect all cash transactions which affect the total

fund. This ledger shall be in accordance with the attached sample

(Exhibit Number Two), which reflects examples of various transactions

which will affect the Fund.

This ledger should be retained Indefi-

nitely and should be used as the basis for the preparation of the

NW 68262 Docld:32989707 Page 126

## Page 127

:..

monthly report. All columns should be ruled off at the end of the

calendar month

and the cash balance brought forward. Column Number

one should reflect all cash receipts and disbursements.

The debit

side of Column Number Two (2a) should reflect all expenditures from

the Fund except any refunds made to the Bureau. All payments made

to criminal Informants and sources should be reflected in the

column captioned "Criminal;" all payments to security inicrmants

or sources should be reflected in the column captioned "Security;"

and all payments

of the miscellaneous nature not covered by either

of the afore-mentioned categories, such as payments to telephone

reflected

credit side of Column Number Two (2b) should reflect all refunds

from payments previously made regardless of whether the previous

payment.was of a criminal, security or miscellaneous nature.

• Column Number Three should reflect all transactions with the bureau;

checks in payment of vouchers and temporary or permanent increases

should be reflected in the "Receipts" column; whereas any

refund from an informant, source or of a miscellaneous nature which •

must be returned to the Bureau because the payment has already

been vouchered, should be reflected in the "Refunds" column.

Like-

wise, any temporary increase returned to the Bureau

should

be

recorded here. (Note entries, Exhibit Number Two.)

In view of the foregoing,. you will note that for every

entry in the cash Disbursements column, there should be a corre-

sponding entry in one of the debit columns, l.e., in either the

Criminal, Security or Miscellaneous columns, or in the Refunds to

Bureau column.

Likewise, for every entry in the Casn Receipts

column, there

should be a

corresponding entry in one of the credit

columns, A.e., In either the Refunds of Payments column or in the

Receipts.from

Bureau column.

_ It is to be further noted that the totals of column

Number 2a will be of assistance in the preparation of the "Sum-

mary of payments to Informants" Ill connection with the monthly

report. The amount of cash on hand can always be determined by

subtracting the total of the crealt side of Column one from the

total of the debit side of this column.

•3. An individual ledger page should be set up for each

paid informant and for each paid confidential sources.

This section

of the ledger should be divided into hree parts; namely, Criminal,

security and Miscellaneous.

The Criminal section of the ledger should contain a

separate page for each paid criminal Informant and each paid

criminal confidential source.

The Security section should reflect

a separate page for each paid security Informant and each paid

confidential source. Under the Miscellaneous section, pages

should be set up for rental of space for plants or surveillances,

regular monthly telephone bills that are paid from the Confidential

Fund and any other such payments that would be made on a regular

basis. Occasional payments, such as payments to taverns, restau-

rants, rental of safe deposit boxes, etc., may be included on a

single page as the expenditures come up.

A sample of an informant

page is attached (Exhibit Number Three). It 1s to be noted that

this page reflects the following Information:

a .

the date of authorization

b.

c.

a.

period covered by payment

date of payment.

e. amount of payment

In connection with the date of authorization, you are

instructed that this date should be the date of the Bureau's letter

to the field division in cases where authorization is made by

Bureau letter and the date of the incoming letter when authorization

Is made by stamping "approved"

received from the field division requesting authority.

Before making any disbursements from the Confidential

Fund to an informant, the authorization should be checked to be

sure that there 1s noù a duplicate payment being made and

that the

period covered by the payment is in agreement with the existing

authorization. These authorizations should be posted in the

ledger at the

time they are received from the Bureau.

In connection

with SAc authorized payments, a notation to the effect that payment

is. being made under authority of the SAc will be sufficient.

After July 1, 1954, the present serial in the informant's

file (FD-228) reflecting payments made to the informant up to that

• date should be maintained in the exhibit envelope.

on July 1, 1954;

forms pertaining to the voucher that is being submitted should be

attached to the tickler copy of that voucher after it has been

prepared

and retained in the accounts receivable file until reim

bursement is made, by the Bureau..

At the time reimbursement is

received, the voucher should be

removed together with the attach-

ments and

a notation made on the voucher of the date reimbursement

was received from the Bureau.

The Request for Funds forms attached

to the voucher may then be destroyed.

In the event an item has

been suspended from the voucher and returned to the field office,

it would be necessary to remove the Request for Funds form from

she voucher on which the blue slip was requested and returned to

the unvouchered ille until such time as it 1s resubmitted or 1t 1s

•determined It will not be resubmitted.

5. Monthly Report.

AS yOU

are aware, the monthly report

of expenditures from the Confidential Fund is presently prepared

and submitted to the Bureay by the twentieth of the month following

the period auring which the expenditures were made.

These reports

should continue to be submitted at this time; however, changes in

the present form for this report have been suggested and after a

review of the various suggestions received, it is felt that the

reports should be prepared in accordance with the attached example

(Exhibit Number Five).

The monthly report submitted to the Bureau

should be prepared under the direct supervision of the Special

Agent in Charge, Assistant Special Agent in Charge or a regularly

designated Field Supervisor.

The jund should be audited once each

53.x months, on June 30 and December 31.

This audit shall be

versonally perforned by a Special Agent Accountant. The report of

this audit shall be forwarded to the Bureau by the twentieth day of

july and the trentleth day of January.

In those instances where

the Confidential Fund is audited by an Inspector from the Training

and Inspection Division during a, regular Inspection, the next

regular six months' audit shall be omitted by the Special Agent

Accountant of the Fleld DiVISion.

With regard to the summary. of expenditures

section of

the Confidential Report, it is desired

to illustrate the following

points:

a. All transactions during the calendar

month should be shown.

b.

All items should be listed in order by

date and by check number.

C.

The explanation should reflect the

name

and symbol number of the informant as

well as the period covered by the payment and

In case of miscellaneous expenditures, a brief

statement to describe the expenditure.

d. Any transaction that affects the

total amount of the fund. to be accounted for

must be fully explained in a cover memoran-

.aum. An example of such a transaction would

be a refund received from an informant for

payment which had already been reimbursed by

the Bureau.

Any such refund, if not already

forwarded to the Bureau, should be transmitted

with the report.

In connection with the summary of payments to informants:

you are advised that all miscellaneous payments must be listed

separately from payments made to informants or sources of Informa-

tion.

This breakdown should include such payments as post office

box rental, telephone service, rental of space for plants, bank

charges, restaurants or taverns on surveillances, meals for

prisoners, etc.

In otner woras, all payments not made to informants

or to sources for information furnished for services rendered or

expenses incurred by them

should be included under miscellaneous

expenditures.

6. Preparation of Blue Slips. As was pointed out here-

tofore, the blue slip should be prepared from the Request for Funds

form with the exception that the date of actual payment to: the

informant should be shown on the blue slip. This date should be

obtained either from the Agent making the payment or the receipt

obtained from the informant.

A blue slip should be prepared at

such time as all receipts necessary to support the item have been

received from the Agent making the payment.

All blue slips should be as brief as possible, but

should contain sufficient information to allow the Bureau to make

proper review of the expenditures. Samples are attached

reflecting payments made to informants under Eureau authority

(Exhibit Number Six), SAC authority (Exhibit Number Seven), and

miscellaneous expenditures (Exhibit Number Eight). These samples

are general but should be used as a guide for preparing all blue

slips.

the following, be kept in mind in connection with the preparation

of blue slips:

&. One blue slip should be used for each

payment.

It is nou desired so nave numercus

payments' listed on a single blue slip in view

of

the possibility of error which would result

in the necessity. of suspending the entire blue

slip; whereas 1f

only one payment were listed

on the blue slip, lt would

be possible to re-

turn only the one item and the remaining 1tems

could be processed for payment.•:

b. The authority must be clearly reflected

on the blue slip.

when authority is based on

the letter Irom the Bureau, actual date of the

Bureau letter shall be used as the date or the

Then the field orfice, by letter,

requests authorization and receives notice that

authorization has been granted in the form of a

copy of the field office letter returned by the

Bureau with the Bureau approval stamped thereon,

the date ol the authorization in this instance

shall be the actual date of the rield office let-

ter to the Bureau requesting the authorization.

c .

The actual period of time covered by the

payment to the informant must be reflected in the

body or the blue slip. Fon example, see

"Period"

• It 1s

also essential that the period covered be carefully

compared with the Bureau authorization to prevent

exceeding the Bureau authorization, both by time

and amount. Receipüs should be obtained whenever

In instances where they are not obtained

either because of the refusal of the informant to

execute one or when it 1s not advisable to obtain

one, the appropriate notation should be reflected

on the blue slip.

d. FD-221 which 1s a receipt signed by the

Agent reflecting receipt of money from the SAC is

only to be used when the receipt signed by the

informant reflects that payment was made by the Agent.

In all instances where the receipt. signed

by the Informant reflects payment was made to him

by the Special Agent in Charge, reimbursement must

be claimed on a voucher of the Special Agent in

Charge. If the receipt reflects payment was madé

to the informant by the Assistant Special Agent in

Charge, then reimbursement must be claimed on a

voucher of the assistant Special Agent in Charge.

In instances where the receipt reflects that payment

was made to the informant by someone other than the

Special Agent in Charge or Assistant Special Agent

blue slip may be submitted for payment on the

or the Assistant Special Agent in Charge.

When

the receipt reflects that payment was made by a

person other than the one claiming reimbursement,

Form FD-221 must be executed and attached to the

• blue slip.

It is advisable to have the 1nform-

ant's receipts' executed in the name of the

employee actually making payment or in blank in

order that the Special Agent in Charge or the •

Assistant Special Agent in Charge may claim

reimbursement.

.t. The Blue silp should not reflect, the

number of the check issued and no reference

should be made on the blue slip to the inform-

ant's field file number.

§. All blue slips submitted on the monthly

expense vouchers of special Agents must bear the

approval of the Special Agent in Charge; however,

the Special Agent in Charge may delegate authority

to the Assistant Special Agent in Charge or an

approved iield office supervisor to sign his name

as approving official followed by the initials of

the Assistant Special Agent in Charge or the

supervisor.

h. Receipts obtained by personnel which

reflect payments to informants and sources should

reflect the ACTUAL DATE payment 1s made to the

informant or source.

The receipt should in no

instance reflect any other date.

The Receipt

should also show the EXACT ANCUNT paid to the

informant or source, 'and every Special Agent sub-

mitting receipts should thoroughly understand

MEMORANDUM FOR ALL BUREAU OFFICIALS AND SUPERVISORS

(A) CONFIDENTIAL EXPENDITURES -- I want to draw to your attention

the absolute importance of making certain that any confidential

expenditure authorized by the Bureau complies with existing Manual

that the Bureau receives appropriate value for

every dollar expended. Although it is the personal responsibility

of each Special Agent in Charge to make certain that full value

is received in the field, it is equally the responsibility of seat

of Government employees to be judicious in authorizing expenditures

to be made and to practice proper economy.

For your Iniormation, Inspectors will; in each field

office inspection, review in the neighborhood of one hundred blue

slips to determine the propriety of each expenalture and "1ll trace

through the files information received and results obtained,

following the expensiture and, if necessary, follow it through

with appropriate employee interviews with

the understanding that

in the event an expenditure is encountered which is not proper

the employees involved will reimburse the Government.

JuLy 8, 1954

FASHILNGTON 25, D.C.

RE:

CONFIDENTIAL FUND -

ACCOUNTING PROCEDURES

Reference is made to No Number SAC Letter 54-G which

set out accounting procedures to be followed in the operation of

the Confidential Fund.

The Bureau is now in receipt of a suggestion which 1t

Is felt will eliminate some duplication of work in connection

with the establishment. of these accounting procedures.

The sug-

gestion was based upon the necessity of an employee's determining

whether payments to informants on SAC authority are in excess

of the $200.00 amount for criminal informants and the $100.00

amount for security informants.

It was suggested that the In-

formants' files be checked and the amount paid prior to July 1,

1954, be entered on the informants' individual ledger pages.

This

would apply onlj to payments made under SAC authority.

It is felt that this suggestion will save considerable

time and work in the field: and you are accordingly instructed

to put it in effect with the establishment of the new accounting

procedure.

Very truly. yours,

John Edgar Hoover

Director.

In addition to the above, it is desired to bring the follow-

Ing: Items to your attention:

1. There has been a noticeable lack of receipts to support

blue slips.

Receipts should be obtained in every possible instance.

2. Fallure to properly explain lack of receipts has been

noticed in numerous

instances.

If the informant refuses to execure

the receipt, a statement to that effect should be included on the cius

slip.

Where 1t is not deemed advisable to obtain receipts for secur-

Ity reasons, this should be fully explained on the blue silp. This

does not apply to blue slips reclaiming bank. charges.

3. All blue slips must show to whon the, payment was actu

•ally made and the city where the payment was actually made.

4. The receipt signed by the informant should reflect

thie

name of the person actually making payment. Any departure from this

should be fully explained on the blue slip.

5.. In the future where a symbol number has been assigned

ta the informant, only the symbol number should be reflected on tre

FD-221 und FD-22la forms; however, the name of the informont shall ce

reflected on the blue slip.

The new forms will be printed and placed in stock at the

Bureau. As spon as they are available, a suprly. well le sent to

In the preparation of future blue slips, the

to:

Any difference between this and

the name used by the Informant in signing a receipt for

payment must be explained

or the blue slip.

When a name

other than the individual's full correct name is used in

Initial development as an informant, his full correct name

should be used on the blue slip as soon as it is known,

together with references to the previous names used in

contacts and payments by your office.

The above procedure 1s necessary to enahie the

Bureau to properly conirus payments and to make sure that

all payments to one individual are consolidated.

It has

been noted in some instances

that blue slips are submitted

showing the full name and on subsequent payments they are

submitted showing the individual's middle namè as & last

name. This 1s especially true in connection with Spanish

names. This practice leads to the possibility of carrying

& separate account of peyments under each name.

Take sure that the necessary employees of your

office are aware of this and the

need for

consistency.

In addition, where an informant or individual

(D) UTILIZATION OF FORM FD-221a - INFORMANT MATTERS --

Analysis has been made of forms used in connection with informants

(racial, criminal, security) and it has been decided that in order to

give tighter security to these forms, form FD-221a be changed as

follows.

In the future in filling out the above form you will utilize

"the informant's symbol designation rather than his true name. No

change is being made in present procedures for handling Forms FD-37,

FD-221 and informant receipts.

The matter concerning security for

all informant forms is being given continuing analysis for the purpose

of instituting methods which will afford these matters top security:
