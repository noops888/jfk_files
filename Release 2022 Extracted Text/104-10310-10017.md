' Review Steff
Attn; Walt Elder O-1:
Attached is exchange of
cables onfJohn Whittey please
note that though retired he
is blocked to EOD. He is also
concerned about his safety since
he is living more-or-less
permanently in| Vienng! ( He may
be afraid that they 344 turn on
him if they run out of oil
ministers.) Kidding aside,I think
he haf& a legttimate cause for
concern so we want to handle
this matter as securely as possibl

Please let me know ASAP how
SSC wants to handle the finances
for the trip. We have less than
two weeks if they want hém before
10 May.
