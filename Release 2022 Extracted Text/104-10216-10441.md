Handiriting Assessent sefort

The writer is apparently a rather clever and shrewd individual

Who nay appear core correct and haruless then actually is the case.

Le has abiorbed the naterial he hus

he learns aid understands quickly,

but he is deliberate and cautious before getting hiself irto a new

or altered situation. He is a cool and calculating observer lino re-

lates the smallest details to cheir larger aspects.

fis synthesizing

faculties are more pronounced than nis analyzino abilities; he is quite

sillful "in futting two and two together" from

the thinos he sees and

hears. Most people in his envirornert may not even be aware of his

astuteness and

vigilance, as he nay intentionally

convey the impression

of being preoccupied with his own thoughts.

Ee discards sugcrfluous

matters as much

as possible, but occasionally the vitil points in

more complex or

unfaniliar proolems have to be pointed out to hin, as

he could miss them when left to his own devices.

Le tries to cobine

inazination with sober midedness and satter-of-factness, but not al-

ways successfully.

As a result, he say be, at times, sorevhat awkward

and unrealistic in his approach.

te possesses rore mental independence

than he cares to show and while pretendirg to conform, way follow some

private personal irclinations.

Hodever, he does not possess much

originality and seems to try out various forms and thought patterns

, with which he can identify himself.

üe is active and curious and

constantly tries to broaden his horizon.

He is still in the process

of mertal development and growth ard he is not jet quite able to gauge

the risks and consequences when he exercises initiativ:. Ee may be

atrare of this and compensate by intersittent overcautiousness.

Basical-

ly rather impressionable, he makes strong efforts at concentrating

intensely on that he is doing, shutting out all fossible distractions

and diversions.

His menory functions well, and he scems to have ac-

cumulated a rather diversified store of knoriledge and infornation.

The writer is not a born organizer, but he tries to arrange his

affairs properly and to be as systenatic and methodical as possible, in

order to avoid confusion. He is active and versatile aud can make sud-

den changes when required. He possesses great facility in expressing

hinself in

word and script. He has sone skill in adjustig his style

to that of the people he is talking to.

Unile he can be rather elo-

quent, he is not likely to divulge anything which shold be kept

secret. He has sone intuition and also sensitivity for selecting and

judging the profer quality of material for a definite purpose. Also,

he possesses munual akill which he could exploit in different ways.

while he has leurned to figure and calculate, this activity does not

seem to hold his interest. levertheless, he is conc rned with money.

He is rather free in spending it and may not always det alon; with

the mans at his diegosal. In his selected profescional field, he

activates all his resources for irojer

Ee hus his feelings and in-

pulses under the atrictest cortrol.

He is a role player who ray affear

core natural and spontaneous tran he actually is.

He is detached,

very reserved and avoids exotional involvesent wnerever possible, even

though he may protond the opposite.

He is self-centered and rather

vain, and rost concerned with nis personal

advantage.

le is quite

proud and occasionally lilies to play the big snot.

He is very self-

defensive and self-protective, constantly guarding hirself against real

or inaginary dancer's.

Apparently, he tries to steel hirself, in order

to be tougher than be constitutionally is. lis erotional sense of

proportion

is not well balanced; he may overenphasize an insignificant

incident, while he disregards an important happening

As a result, he

at other times he is cowardly in situations which are not dangerous at

Eovever, whatever nistakes he may nake in this area, he will

cover them up most skillfully.

He is very secretive about his affairs

in general and ¿ces not confide easily in anybody.

There is little

consitency in his exotional attitudes, and he could surprise those in

his closer enviroment by rather unexpected actions and reactions.

The onlj erotional ties he has ray le to his traditional backuround;

Apparently, the writer dissipates his efforts sonewhat and tries

to do nore than he can handle comfortably.

In spite of his occasionally
