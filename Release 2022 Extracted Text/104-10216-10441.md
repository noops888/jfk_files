The writer is apparently a rather clever and shrewd individual
who nay appear core correct and hareless than ectually is the cases
He is intelligent, well educsted and evidently has acquired profes-
sional training and expericnce. He as absorbed the material he hus

but he is deliberate and cautious before get‘
or altered situation. 2 cool and calculating observer who re-
lates the smallest details to their larger aspects. iis synthesizing

faculties are more pronounced than his analyzing abilities; ne is quite

skillful “in putting two and tuo together" from the thiugs he sces and

hears. Most people in his environment zay not even be aware of his

astuteness and vigilance, as he may intentionally convey the impression

of being preoccupied with his own thoughts. discards curerfluous

matters as much as pocsible, but occasionally the vitul points in

more complex or unfamiliar problems have to be zointed out to hin, as

he could miss them when left to his own devices. He tries to corbine

isagination with sober-mdedness anc satter-of-Zectness, but not al-

ways successfully. As a result, he nay be, at tices, soxevhat awkward

and unrealistic in his approach. ke possesses zore mental independence

than he cares to show and while pretanding to conform, follow some

private personel inclinations. liowever, he docs not possess auch

originality and seems to try out various forms and thought patterns

.with which he can identify himself. He is active ond curious und

constantly tries to broaden his horizon. He is still in the process

of acntal developrent and growth anc he is not yet quite able to gauge

the risks and consequences wken he exercises initiative. Ze may be

aware of this and compensate by interzittent overesutiousness. Basical-

dy rather impressionable, he makes strong efforts at concentrating

intensely on whst he is coiag, shutting out all fossible distractions

and diversions. His memory functions well, and he scems to have ac- ~:
cumulated a rather diversified store of knowledge and information.

The writer is not a born organizer, but he tries to arrange his
affairs properly and to be as systenatic and methodical as possible, in
order to avoid confusion. He is active and versatile aud can make sud-
den changes when required. He possesses great facility in expressing
hinself in word and script. He has sone skill in adjust:ng his style
to that of the people he is talking to. While he can be rather elo~
quent, he is not likely to divulge anything which shold be kept
secret. He has some intuition and also sensitivity for selecting and

Apparently, the writer dissipates his efforts somewhat and tries
to do core than he can handle coafortsbly. In spite of his occasionally
