Mr. ¥. A. Bieson
136 Claremont Avenue .
Mount Vernon, HN.

Dear Mr. Biseon:

= I have seen the correspondence exchanged between 7
ur.. lass: and yourself regarding thé contributions you .- ~
collected for the China Forum. A draft for the sua in

full will be sent to you thia week.

. I do not.know in the name of whom or what Miss Smedley
spoake of the China Forum. Since ehe wae not in China at
the time the Forum Suspended, nor nas she corresponded
.with moon the subject, I consider it necessary to place
before you and the other contributors an account of the
circumstances in which the Yorum ceased: publication.
Since you apparently gathered the contributors together
in a meeting to hear it Mise Smedley had to say, I
would appreciate it deeply if you would gather them onoe
‘mors ti jar my account. The enclosed is a copy of a
letter, sent by me last May to the Chinese Communist Party.
It haa been published in.China in a Chinese translation
and copies have been sent abroad but has not been pub-
lished in nglish as fa¥-as-I know. I do not know the
names of the people who wore good enough to contribute
to the Forum but their interest in the matter warranta
placing before them the story of what happened to the
Bagasine. I trust, out of aimple fairness to me,. you
will be good enough to give them this opportunity.

ry

“~~ -"Y greatly regret any ‘inconvenience or embarrassment
to which you have been put in this matter. . I do hopa,
however, that my letter will enlighten you. and your
friends and enable:you to appreciate the difficulties
which have arisen.. I know of no-project to revive the
China Forum‘at the.present time.. Should such occur, the
Yesultant. publication would be of a considerably different
oharacter from the one I edited, as will be obvious from
the facta given in my letter-to the C. P.. I think people”
who are interested in eupporting the revolutionary move-
ment here should know these facts.

Once again, I appreciate all the trouble you have
gone to in this matter.

Did you ever, incidentally, receive the article
°Fasclem in China’ and the newsletter which [ mailed to
July 13 last?

Youra sincerely,

enol. : _ (Harold R. Isaacs)

To the Gontral Committee of the Chinese Communist Party:

The two-year period of ay extra-organizational cole
laboration with the Chinese Communist Party bas come to
an-endiand the China Forum which I founded and edited dur
ing that: time has been forced to suspend publication.. In
‘the: interest ‘of our. whole movement ag well as in my per-
sonal intereet; I coneider it necessary to record here
and publiah the bietory of thé Ohina Forum and. the oir
cumstances of ite suspension. You refuded.me the oppor
tunity to lay the matter before the membership of the
party even when I offered to do.eo in your own organs and
not through the columns of the Forum. khen, wrongly, I

“permitted the Forum to go down in silence, you turned

around and in your orgsns and near organs in China and
abroad you proceeded with the usual slandere of "betrayer®
and *counter-revolutionary”, in so doing you didn't have
the courage or the simple honesty to state that you pre=-
sented the China Forum with en ultimatum and forced its
suspénésion because in reply its editor raised. questions
which are being placed before the whole movement today

by the International Left Opposition. Nor did you etate

* that’ you deliterately saashed the Forum for this reason

despite ay repgated and extendéd offers to continue pubdli-
cation as before-on.a-straight enti-Kuomintang, anti-
eaving these various problems to be

jd out first privately among ourselves. In other.
you deliberately forced. suspenston of the China
spite the fact, on your own admission, that its

a serious low to'.the revolutionary movement in

~ China, that 1 mean} the disappearance of an organ which

for tw you donéidered an extremely valuable
inetrument in the. hands of the movement. Here, as in the
broader issues which léd to our differences, your blind
adherende to false policies was once more demonstrative
of your Feadiness to place your factional Anterotte above
the interests of the Chinese Revolution.

In going baok over the history of ths Forum, T think
thé vicious character of your action becomes evén more —
evident shen I start with the. fact that from beginning to
end I functioned not a member of the party but as a
willing sympathiser- who was prepared to throw all hia
energies into a job be saw he could do - edit and publish
an organ in China which could help mobilise the forces
of this country for struggle against the Kuomintang and
the imperialtats by exposing the regime of terror and
privation which they have in common imposed upon the
masees of the Chin people. Permit me to recall st |
thie point that I never accepted any personal |

tion for time or labor. You gave the Forum financial
aid but I never received a dollar from you that was not
put into the paper. I refused your offere of compensa-
tion and earned my living elsewhere. Your only. claim on
es wag my full-hearted loyalty to the Communist ideal and

| our



-2-
our Common dedication to the atruggle ayainet a regime
of bate and misery and oppression. In the end you for
foited this claim by ceasing any longer to be in ay eyes
honest or-effective leaders of this struggle.

Although you helped the Yorum finanoially, the part
you played in building it up from toe day it ted in
January, 1952, to the day of its last appearance in Janu
ary 1034, was insignificant. My repeated requests for
cooperation in matters of circulation and material for
publication went largely. unsatisfied throughout ‘that tine.
You never. supplied th the reporte Iso frequently .
and-urgently sought, particularly on trade untona, strike

i " atrugglee, the Red Armies, the Red districts, etc. Svery

x thing the Forum did and became was the fruit of the work
of a tiny group of devoted collaborators (the most im
portant of whom had no connection sith you whatever) and
pyself who had to depend almost entirely on “our onn re-

uroes for everything we did and published. At every
crisis in the Forum's existence, when it was banned by
the French authorities in Shanghai at the very outset}
when it was bounded and persecutéd by the American and
Chinese authorities in the summer of 1933, when through
\B¥itien police pressure it was thrown out of every avail-
able printing ship in the city; when tha paeudo-Fascist
Blue Shirts again and again threatened the printing plant
which I built up partially through personally contracted -
loans -= it was invariably through my own initiative, with
the help of the little Forum staff, that we pulled our-
gelves up by the bootstraps every time and carried. on to
@ point in January this’ year where the Forum waa flourish
ing and growing daily in circulation, prestige, and in-
fiuenoe despite the many formidable obstacles in ite way.
The formation of the China Forum Readers Assooiation
which in the brief space of three months spread to eleven
cities in five provinces, developing into e mighty poten-

_ . thal-veapon for the revolutionary movement, was the prod-
uct of spontaneous action on the part of the Forun'a
Yeaders, later sponsored and led by the paper itself.

All these wero the Forum's own achievemonts, not yours.

by your-arbitrary and criminal action you shattered then
in the full stride of their growth. Because to my bitter f
disappointment. I had not_nor could I secure the resources
to oarry on myself - owing largely to the difficult ‘consi [
tions of work and the imspossibility of getting revenue
from the paper itaelf - all that had been achieved and

was to be achieved was ground into the dust.

II.

From almost the very beginning of may active work -
which I date from the time [ began reporting events in
China in a Communist way ~ a nunber of questions presented
themselves tome in increasingly forcibie form, These =e
arose originally from my discovery of the groas distor~ |
tions and exaggerations wbicn [ found to be characteristic |
of Communist propaganda tn China and abroad. I defino
propaganda ag the skilful, clear, accurate and wholly
truthful reporting of the facts linked to sn incisive,

purposive



ing to mo were naturally those which applied to China
* because here I could check Sllegations wi

Cad

purposive interpretation and a plan of action for deal-
ing with the faocte ina evolutionary way. I learned —
“bis feu sie dade “and vurk oF Lenin and his Bolshevik
Comrades who taught us-that the truth comes from the.
masees themselvea and that only disnater can result from
telling them lies. fF bave.never learned to the contrary
that it wao my revolutionary duty to work in any other
way although I soon found that the present day Communiat
Party press makes @ practice of distingulehing between

propaganda and truth. i it
Examplea of exaggeration ‘and diatortion moet strik-

known facts.
I firet wrote these down to the 4gnorance or inoavacity
of individuals. I felt. that Communist editors abroad
would publish accurate facts about China if they could
get them. Accordingly with a friend I tried to set up.
an independent mail news service and sent weekly bulletins
to papers all over the world Giving brief, sharp, factual’
accounts of what was going on. This was in the fall of .
1931 after my return from the area of the great Central
China floods of that summer: I scarcely understood then
why this service failed to secure any response from tha
Communist prees abroad. after about three montha I had
to suspend it for lack of. support. It simply didn't get
published except in a few organa which were not official i]
Communist Party papere, including the New York Militant. fl

It wasn't long before I began to perceive, with a
deeper etudy ‘of international events and the history of
the Chinese Revolution, that a coneistent thread ran
through the distortions and exaggerations which I. found -
Dot only in brief casual reporte of-current events but
in the Solem pronunotanentoes. made by delegates before
plenuma of the E.0.@.1.°{ discovered that these departures
from tho’ truth vere made Necessary by the official premise
that ever aince the catastrophe of 1937 .a mighty, upsurg=
ing revolutionary movesent bas been marching forward in
China to the ‘very brink of seizure of power under the
leadership of the Chinese Communist Party. I diocovered
that these exaggerations were necessary because the prom
iee-vas false and along with it all the basio its of
the policies being pursued by the Communist International
and the Communist Party in China. I cannot begin here to
give a summary of some of these distortions (which T
verbally cited to you by the dozen) ranging from. particu-
lar incidents (the wilfully false picture given of the
cotton-mill atrixe in. Shanghai in January, 1933, even to
the point cf transposing it to February to heighten the
impression given of the workera' role in the Shanghai war)
to bigh flown generalisations like the statement recently
made before the Plenum of the §.C.C.I. that the C.C.7. has
won over the majority of the Chinese working class and

tae peasantry.

Ia denying the footual truth of thio premise, whence
flows the whole policy of the Communist Party in China, I:
deprecate not a whit the sagnificent militancy and courage
of Chineee workers, striking again and again and fighting

: * againet



+

against torrifio oddo in defenso of their very lives;
Mor the noroio struggles waged by peasants all over the
country; nor the fight of the Red Armiea againet the
Kuomintang, -I. morely respect the cold, indisputable fact J
tbat theso. struggles are defenaive, not offanoeivo, that ]
they are isolated, desperate and unorganised. With very
few exoeptions - a few small etrikes here and there and
the larger exoeption of the kéd Army =: they are without
organized revolutionary leadership. Moreover the develop=
ment. of thig leadership, the task of the C.P., 18 prodeéd>
ing at a tragioally retarded pace owing to the falee
policies. and inept tactics of the party.

In denying: the présence of a mighty révolutionary
upsurge fis ©., & Vaat, organised :march toward the seizure
of power) I respect facta made “etill clearer perhaps when
compared to the facts and figures of the monster mass move-
mente of the 1925-27 period. Thai tragio errors of the
Communist leadership in 1927 wero: primarily reaponsidle
for the decapitation of that great movement and because
mo lessons have been drawn from those eventa to this very.
day, these exrors, monstrously accumulated, aré still re-
6ponsible’ for the tragedies of today, ,But for the purpose
of our comparicon here, let ug for exanplo take the single
fact that in 1926 in Greater Shanghai there were 257
strikes, In 1933 there were 82. Let us remember that
on the eve of the workers’ seisure of power in'Shanghat
in Maroh, 1927, there were more than 800,000° vorkers,
handiorafteren and petty traders out on the streets |

ing with arms ‘in hande for demande of a far-reaghing pos
litical oharacter.. A olose oheok for the entire count

in the latter half of 1933 showed me that leas than one-
thirtieth of that numbér were; engaged in strikeo and other
disputes during ‘any given monta and that almost invariably
the demande were defendive demands against wage outs and
lockouts. oreover; the lack of cohesive leadership - -
often in departments of the same factory or in ‘one or more
ofa group.of factories = or even sometimes lack of even

the most elementary organization - has in almoat evory
to deadening failure and rolatively easy. betrayal

case li

“Dy the yellow ‘labor leaders® and *médiatore? of the

‘Kuomintang... .In 1925°the shooting of thirteen students

by British pelice in “hanghai was the touchsoff for a
general strike which paralyzed the oity and shioh was
seconded by vaet sympathy strikes which broke like a
series of tidal waves over the entire country. In Janu-
ary, 1932, when the Japanese imperialists used the Shanghai
International Settlement as a base for opezationa which 7
cost the lives of tens of thousands of Chinese, not a
aingle strike-interrupted the normal course of the pub-
lic or other services in that settlement. In the factories
there were no strikes but a large scrle lockout to whioh
the overwheluing majority of Shanghai's workers submitted

without protest.

fhe dogged, persistent struggle carried on by emall
seotions of the rank and filo workere in isolated instances
in recent years is tribute to the magnificent fibre of

i Chinese



s

Chinese workers. It is not evidence that a revoluticnary
seizure of power is on the order of the day. It is evi-
dence, along with the herofo sacrifices of thousands who
have lost lives and liberty in Cliinese revolutionary
etruggle during .the last seven years of Kuomintang re-
action, that.1t {a vossible to fight the monstrous white
terror whioh Chinese Comiunists frecuently cite as a
reason for the insufficiency of their work. Yet. it 16
largely because thie terror has not been fought effectively
that the Kuomintang regime, desvite the fact that 1t is
rotting and orumbling, oan still keep the 1id down on the
boiling, simmering hatred of the people it rul: Unle:
the martyrdom of thousands of China's fin workers,
jante and revolutionary inteYlectuals is to be in vain,
we must turn resolutely away from the folly of calling to
ineurreotion when what 1s needed is painstaking education,
organization and the sponsorship of day-to-day struggles

“of the masses for demooratic demands, the. slow building up

of a varty and mass organizations and a covenent which

“will be able’ to command. the forces capable of. carrying out

an insurrection.

In the case of the widespread but isolated and in-
dividual cases of peasant uprisings, and thie inoludes
the Red armies in Kiangsi, theee struggles await the
leadership of a strong working class movement before they
can have a successful issue. The Red armies in their re=
stricted and Surrounded areas and with their meagre re~
sources have. fought heroioelly againet the Kuomintang
attacks upon them. But until the Kuomintang is shaken
from its bulwarks in the imperialist controlled working
class. centres, their prospect of revolutionary triumph
remains necessarily dim. No revolutionary purpose ia
served by taking refuge in the fiction that these armies
have oroletarian leadership because individual workers,
sundoubtedly leaders of superior quality and courage, have
been torn from their fadtories-and their fellow-workers ~~
and gent down to occuvy key positions in the Red Army
distriots and in the-Red Armies themselves. Indeed, this
Oommon practice of extracting the most conscious and pro=
gressive working class eléments from their working olass
environment and sending them down to the Red districts ie
& good index to the oriminal transposition of emphasis
which has helped paralyze the working class movement in
the cities. If the White Terror doesn't carry off the
workers’ leaders as they arise, the C.P..does and has done
so in hundreds of case: This helps in no 6mall part to
explain why it has also been impossible to mobilize a
genuine mass anti-Japanese movement in the foot of mili- -
tary aggression and why the White Terror of the Kuomin-
tang has succeeded, by filling mass graves and innumer-
able prisons with the martyred dead and living, in down-
ing the anti-imperialist movement or efforts toward the
organization of such a movement and paving the way for
the ever increasing enoroschments of the imperialists.
The varty bac not yet grinned and directed the deep and
bitter and often inarticulate hatred of the masses of the
peovle for their oppressors and thia inoludes large e¢o-
tione of the lower vetty bourgeoiste who could be won by
eucceseful mace pressure from below. This 1a because the

Party hao failed to translate the realitie: of everyday
evente into its program and taovica.. 7 -

I cannot here 0 into the many-faceted problems -and
issues which flow from these facta with regard to the “
poliotes and tactics of the Chinese revolutionary movement,
Nor extending to:the international scene need I go into
the terrifio effects of the German catastrophe nor the
storm of questions whioh bas been directed at the-C.t.
leadershiv whose responsibility in the disaster has be-
Come nakedly clear to unnusbered Comzunista ‘and Comminist
sBymosthizers the warld over. Nor into the whole set: of. -
faplications which arise from the polioies of the 0.1,
with narticular reference to the late develonments in
Soviet, foreign polioy, the Litvinov-Roosevelt agreement,
the forthooming mooted entrance of the U.S.3.R. into the
League of Nations and in a snaller but equally ocharaster-
fetio way, the forthcoming association of the U.5.5.R.
with the Institute of Paoifto Relations which hopes to
hold ite naxt talkfest in vosoow. These vroblema,.with
their many sveoific links to the Chinese ousations, were ~
the baaio questions over whioh I goon. began to take issue
with the offioial views of the Party and the International.

Te |

- But precisely. pecause at all oosts I desired to carry
on the Forum's oven struggle against the common enemy ~
against the Kuomintang and the imperialists - I sedulously
‘avoided bringing these issues into the colusins of the paper,
dnoreasingly against my better judgment. 1 leaned over far
backward in thie respect. This expressed itself in many

of the ourrent iesuee with which we had to deal.

6call. the whole uvhill fight whiok the_
Forum waged on behalf of. Paul. end Gertrud Ruegg in the
spring and summer of 19323 during. which time I repeatedly

vaid lip service to the need for mase.oreesure - partiou-
larly here in China’= dut in fact the “legalities" and
futilé negotiations remained the wajor pillars of the de-
‘enge.- Until in the very end I finally rebelled, I vasn't
even permitted to give Ruegg his honourable and Tightful
title - seoretary of the Pan Pacific Trade Union Secre-
tariat. Yat, although I felt the struggle for the Rueggs
was being seriously handicavved“by the tactics being pur-
6ued, ‘I carrted on the fight with all the energy at ay
command and you will recall that it waa I who oreated the
looal defense committee. and was ohiefly resvonsible for
the videsoread presa propaganda and the considerable
Sympathy which ve aroused. Yet the strictly non-political
attitude whioh Ruegg was forced to assune at the trial
‘(in contrast to the highly political attitude of his

| prosecutors) was in my opinion one of the major reasons

for



* regime.

ye |
for the fate to whivh he. and hie wife were condemned.

I ask you. to recall the whole neriod of the organtsa=
tion end aotivities of the China-League for Civil Rrghte, |
from Decenbér, 1932, to June, 1933, in which I took. an
notive pert. I.gave full vlay to this hybrid League and |
its work without. once publishing the basio critioisns 7
whioh I. often. voiced’ to you and whioh in the end were t
wholly confirmed by what Rannened after the Kuomintang
murdered Yang‘Chien in Juné that year. | _

I ack you to recall. the. views I set forth in August. .
and Séntember, 1933, on the subject of the "anti—-War Con-
grees" which at your specific request I did not publish,
Instead, to my regret, I published the foul rot of Mare
ley & Co., without freely giving play to the true facta
about that farcical junket which had convinced me that
the policies which gave it birth do not.one single whit
advance the international struggle againat imperialist

war. i

HE On one occasion ~ and this at least I can take dom
fort in‘ I passively reeisted when you requested me to
write end publish a slanderous attack on Chen~Tu-hoit
when he was condemned to. 13 years japrieonnent by the
Kuomintang. Your request was sneoific. I was not to;
deal with the igsues which had brought Chen Tu-hsiu from
being the leader of the C.P, in 1927 to being leader of
the Chinese Opposition in 1933. I was only to string to+
gether a vile series of labela in an effort to exzvlain
why the Kuomintang even. imprisoned the leader of. the
Left Opvosition. Ag you know, that attack was never
eritten or published. : :

: Again in December, 1933, upon my return from Furti
you specifically demanded ‘that I set aside the resul
my own versonal investigations in Foochow in order to;
write on your behalf (but over my signature!) an utterly
Daseless and slanderous attack on the Left Opnosition.

You w. recall that you charged at that time that. the.
"Trotekyiste" were prominently identified with the new
governzent set uo in Sikion by Chen Ming-sbu and Teal’
Ting-kai.. You lumped.the Left Opoosition with the Third
Party and the so-called Sociol Democrats among the petty
bourgeois satellites of the Fukien militarists. It wad

a8 much to satisfy myaelf on this very point as to per-
form a mission for you that [ went down to Fooohow and i
Sent -tro weeks there and learned through dircet contact
with dozens of people prominently concerned that the Left
Onsoeition were stoutly snd olearly opz0sed to the Foochow
I_haven't place bare to diecuse the relations of
the C.P. to the short-lived Pukien Government or the char~

haovenvd thes 3 hed wet ead hat seversl lensthy interviews
with Yu and by the time I left Fooohow I understood bis
position and his versonality exceedingly well. He was as”
much a Trotakyist. as Wet Lan-fang ie! Yet you actually
demanded that I ignore my own knowledge of the wan and in
my artiole on Furten set ‘him down as a ‘Trotskyist’. I
wae faced on the-one hand by your demands that I write
falsehoods to suit your volicies and on the other by my
deen desire to forth the actual facts about the Oppo-
“gitton'a attitude towards the Fukien regize. But once
fe more, to preserve the shreds of our relationship, I drove :
: aa | middle course and did neither, leaving the whole question...
treet

out of my article.

Despite the facts that these issues weighed more and
more heavily upon me, despite the faot. that events in
China and abroad were pressing themselves sore and more
imperatively on the-concerns of every sincere revolution-
ary, I still trisd to keep the Forum balanced on its
ribbon-like path, concentrating on the anti-Kuomintang,
enti-imverialiat struggle, and in so doing fulfilling at
least a partial function as a revolutionsry organ. $
deeply felt, however, that I’ was betraying wy readers by
avoiding these iseues. How could I write of Germany and
avoid all the implications of that disaster? How eould
I write of America's recognition of the U.S.S.R. and still
fail to say that. the Communist International had virtually
been murdered ‘at Washington? -How oould I warn against the
dangere of imverialiet ‘atervention in the J.5.S.R. and
still not point out that Soviet foreign policy was in
fact daily heightening the denger of such iatervention?
Yet I. somehow did eo and sought in whatever vay possible
to retain some basis.for our continued collaboration.

Ww. ed seeeeegeeneceeraperigoseeret ait

Nevertheless, abruptly in January of this year you
forced ‘an ultimatum upon me and subsequently forced the
break in-our relationship because I could not and vould
not, at your demand, devote the China Forus to policted

7 vhioh I could not and do not believe compatible with the:

H Ainterests of the Chinese Revolution and the international
prolétarian revolution. I could not, at your demend, set
aside the convictions to which I had literally been driven
by the stinging lash of catestrophio, events in China,

Germany and the world over. Partitoularly ay deep inter- ‘
est in Chinese events during the last three years made it
‘ {moossible for me, finally, to give active support to
policies and tactica whose disastrous effects sere being
a thousandfold confirmed for me by the tragic events of
every owiftly-vassing day.. I could not ignore questions
which strike at the roots of our work and the whole struo-
ture of our hopes for a revolutionary future.

Despite the fact that these questions are rooking
the entire International today, you denied ay right to

vaise


offered to discuss these questions

-% :

raise them in print. You dewanded more. You demanded
that I attaok anybody who did 80 - primarily the people aus

you oall “counter-revolutionary Trotekyists® - the only

peopte who are’ facing these probleas today in a fearless,
revolutionary way. fou demanded that the China Forus
become a stereotyoe for the volicies and vulgar faction-
al dlanders which I could neither then nor now be party
to. In reply to.my questions on China you simply quoted
back tome the lies and half-lies I've been so used to —
Féading in Inprecorr. You even declaréd: “For propa-
ganda purposes a.certain amount of exaggeration 1a neces-
sary...% and went’on anasingly to say: “but we know the
true facts and we base our policies on thea, not on these
exaggerations!" A new slant on modern-day ae tactioa!
Facts, you @aid, are curious things. ‘They have to be
turned around and around and around and examined ologely
until their true nature becomes apvorent. The trouble 18

you turn them so far and 80 quickly that they turn into

something like a dizaily turning top of. fancy — or. at
best wieh — fulfilling misrepreeentations.

fo my questions on Germany you. quoted Heckert,
Piatniteky, and the 2.0.C.I.'s famour resolution deoler-
ing that the collapse of the German party and the slaughter
of the German workers were based on the past, present and
future correct policies of the 0.P.0.! You declared I had
no right: to offer critical comment on the dangerously
opnortunistic foreign and dowestio policies of the U.S.9.R.,
most notably on the entry of the U.3.S.R. on a straight

“nationalist basia into the disgusting corridors of in-

perialist intrigue. To'the contrary, I was to lovingly
famingly fondle and hail the voliotes which have meant

disaster in China, Gerasny and elsewhere ond are rapidly
leading: the U.3.3.R. into the vacuum of nationalist is0~

lation from-the world wide proletarian movement. This I a
was to.do, to begin with, by oublishing Stalin's face on
the. front page and colunins of the customary, panegyrics
to his infalitbility. Above all and before all, was to
take up oudgels. against “counter-revolutionary Trotekyism".
That waa to ba the main point of my reformation - to raise
no questions myself and ‘slander anybody else who did so.

Ta -reply to your demand that I dubmit to an editorial
board in-order that these editorial policies should be
effectively put into practice, J offered (1) to continue
publication striotly as before, meanwhile arguing out my.
differences. with you 'in diecusatone on the side; (2) to
throw the columne of the Forum onen to a general discus-—

-sion of all basic revolutionary question, with free play
- to unorthodox as well as orthodox views. If your views

were correct, I argued, 11 would be a distinct odvantege +
to you to have such an opcortunity to display their bril-
liance alongside the puny efforts of your critios; (3) to
publish orthodox news. and views but to reserve for myself

Dr, larold R. ISAACS, Profeasor of Political Science at N.I.?.
ETON REQUIRED - REFERENCED

1. On 12 July 1967, WSPARROW/i renewed hie old friendship with
Subject at the MIT Faculty Club. Subject 1s now.a senior research associate
at MIT's Center ‘for International Studies and has recently beea named
Professor. : :

2, For the past few years Subject has been working on an international
study series involving nincrity racial groups, His reports have been
published in the New Yorker magazine and an books, The New World of I
foericans and India's untouchables. Subject plana to publish ta higust
1957 a book on the American Jews in Icreel and 13 working on another on
the Philippines. :

3. WUSPARROW/1 first mot Subject in 1946 after he had: just completed
@ long and friendly interview with Ho Chi Minh as Far Kast correspondent
for Newaveek, At that tine, Subject felt that tho United States vas making
a mistake In not accepting Ho as the leader of a united Vietnaz, reeling
that Ho was independent enough of China to make him at worst a sart of
Tito. : :

“5. Subject presently is despatring of United States foreign relations
in:that our people ‘froa Washington, or elsevhere, seldom seen to establish
“a deep rapport with Asian or African nationals, Subject feels-that such
_ relations as do exist never reach mare than an ineffective superficial
level. i
5. Subject first vent to the Far East about 1930 when he wes a crew
member of the Matson Line's Malolo and disembarked at Honolmlu to work for
the Honolulu Advertiser. (WUSPARROW/1. vent to work for the ewe paper two.
years later.) Subject went next to the Philippines where:be worked on a
daily, While in Manila he was offered the editorship of the Bangkok
Royal Mail, to fill in for-St, Clair McELNAY, now of the Kew Yorker.

6. Subject's mind was seton China and in late 1931 he wut to
Shanghaf and Joined The China Proso, vorking alongside TiLtman’ DURDIN,
bow of the Key York Tings. Subject lost his Job with The China Press
after a flare-up vith Hollington TONG, part-ovner of the paper.” Subject
then joined the Newsweek foreign ‘staff. Subject was in and out of
Bangkok after Uorld Wer IT and WSPARROW/1 became friendly with hid.
According to ‘WUSPARROH/1, many people. regard Subject'a Tragedy of the

writer on C >

Ghinese Revolution as a significant vork‘and-a- recent
Denni:

3: BLOODYORTH, hols a good view of Subject's Scratches on the Kind.

. 7. Subject now-seens permanently settled with MIT, Having bought
a bane at 96 Farlow Road, Nevton, Subject hosts there at pool-side
“senivars” on Saturday afternoons, with MIT faculty friends and journalist
friends such as Bob SHAPLEN coming by. Subject invited WUSPARROH/1 to
Participate as vell. :

8. However, as WUSPARROW/1 ascertained, Subject has little contact

“with foreign students save for an occasional adult foreign graduate

student. We.hope, considering Subject's background, that le will prove
with WUSPARROW/1's guidance to be a profitable umedtting spotter and

* @ssessor of foreign graduate students.

In 1933 or 1934, ISAACS had s fight with AGNES SYSDLSY. It was an ideological

with the Chineso Communist party has com to an end and

From almsot the vory tagianing of sy acti s: work =
which I date from the tine I bean reporting evante in
Chins. in-a communist way - a numver of queationo presented
themselves to-me in increasingly forcible form, The:
urode originally from.my discovery of tho gross distortions
and exagrerstione witch 1. found to be characteristic of.
communis. propasanda in.China and abroud, I define pro-
pagunda'as the ekillful, clear, accurate and wholly truthful
reporting of the facts linked to an incisive, purposive
interpretation and a plan of action for dealing with the”
facta in a revwlutionsry way. I leamed.this from the life
and work of Lenin and his Bolonc7it comrades sho taught
us that the trith cones from the masece theucelves and that
only disaster can result from telling them lies, I have
never learned to the contrary that it was my revolationary
duty:to work in any other way, altnough I soon fourd that
the présent-day Communivt 2arty preos. makes a practise of
diatingaishing between propuganda and truth,

Bxamplea of exaggeration and_dietortion most 6'riking
to me were naturally those #hich ayplied to China, because
