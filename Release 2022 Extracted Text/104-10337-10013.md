JFK Work Files (also called Russ Holmes' Ancillary Files)

13 boxes containing 236 "folders" organized by subject. The
individual files are primarily based upon or related to
subjects and individuals in Lee Harvey Oswald's 201 File. We
estimate, based on a survey of over half the boxes that at
least 2/3, and probably more, of the materials in the file
is duplicative of documents previously reviewed.

The collection is a combination of files set up for
background / reference purposes and responses to specific
requests. Most files deal with requests from, and
responses, to the HSCA investigation (1976-79), but the file
includes folders related to the Rockefeller Commission

JFK Work Files (also called Russ Holmes' Ancillary Files)

13 boxes containing 236 "folders" organized by subject. The
individual files are primarily based upon or related to
subjects and individuals in Lee Harvey Oswald's 201 File. We
estimate, based on a survey of over half the boxes that at
least 2/3, and probably more, of the materials in the file
is duplicative of documents previously reviewed. Most of
these documents are copies, however, there are a some
originals of JFK documents.

The collection is a combination of files set up for
background / reference purposes and responses to specific
requests. Most files deal with requests from, and
responses, to the HSCA investigation (1976-79), but the file
includes folders related to the Rockefeller Commission
(1975) and Church Committee (1976) investigations and FOIA
requests. The boxes also coritain reference tools (index to
mames requested by HSCA; inventory of Mexico City COS
Records) and work files from other components. Some of the
files were reviewed by HSCA staffers.

Holmes continued to add to the file after the end of the

HSCA investigation. For example Victor Marchetti 1984

deposition re E. Howard Hunt is in the file. There are

several files on Authors who have written JFK Assassination 7
books and files of post-1979 newspaper clippings. :

Based on our survey, there is no "new" Oswald/JFK

not locate in the Oswald/JFK collection, but the information

Proposed Handling of Work Files

The Ancillary files are not sequestered material and are not
part of the CIA JFK collection. They were created for
reference and background purposes in response to JFK
assassination requests and investigations. The contents are
primarily duplicates of previous reviewed material, but
there are some unique items that can be considered subject
to the JFK Act.

HRG will review the 13 boxes of work files that were
organized and maintained as a separate file know as the
Ancillary File.

Review of JFK Work Files

The JFK work files or "ancillary files" are not sequestered
material or permanent agency records. They were maintained
as working files, separate from the JFK collection, by an
agency staff employee(s) responsible for the JFK collection.
These files were created for reference and background
purposes in response to various JFK assassination inquiries
and investigations. Eighty to ninety percent of the files'
content are primarily duplicative of material in the Oswald
201 and the JFK sequestered collection, both of which have
been previously reviewed for release. There are, however,
some unique items with in the files which can be considered
subject to the JFK Act.

Review Guidelines

HRG will conduct a document-by-document review of these 13
boxes of working files.

Unique items (i.e., those not identified as being previously
reviewed) that add to the understanding of the JFK
investigation or that may be of utility to researchers will
be reviewed for release to NARA. Most of the unique items
should fall in the following three categories:

1) Memos, documents, reports, etc., which contain
substantive information and are directly related to the
JFK/Oswald story or scope of one of the investigations;

2) Previously reviewed items that contain different
marginalia, (do not include transmittal memos-and forms
attached to previously reviewed documents unless they
contain substantive information) ;

3) Items created as a direct result of the investigations
(i.e., the card file index to names requested by HSCA; the
chrono of all documents in which Silvia Duran is mentioned).
This does not include inventories and similar tools based on
the working files and prepared for reference use.

Other items that do not fall into the above categories, but
which could be considered subject to the JFK Act, will be
addressed on a case by case basis.


13-00000

Guidelines on specific types of documents:
FOTA Request:

If a document was responsive to the 1976 FOIA request (i.e.,
has FOIA stamp with date and double number such as 706-431),
consider it a duplicate document. In folders/files on
specific FOIA requests, do not treat FOIA related
items/paperwork as unique documents. Do check the folders
for other substantive items. If the document was responsive
to another FOIA request, consult with the senior reviewer.

Open source/press_ clippings
Do not process open source items for release unless they

contain substantive marginalia, or are attached to
documents/memos being reviewed for release.

Folders _on Authors of books on assassinations:

Treat on case-by-case basis; generally would not
process/review folders created after the HSCA investigation
(1979).

Inventories prepared by Russ Holmes:

Do not review for release unless created specifically for
the HSCA staff. Consult with senior reviewer if in doubt.

e: iew Te

Review only substantive items that can not be identified as
previously reviewed documents.

n. de nts : .

If these can not be located in our on-line index; they must
be coordinated with the other agency.

iginals of Doc mts Released in JFK collection:
If a document was previously released in full, process the

original for release to NARA. If document was sanitized or
denied, file in the appropriate HRG retention box.

Non-related material:

Do not review; use same guidelines as employed for
microfilm; this determination will be reviewed by the senior
reviewer.


13-00000

written ni drafts of memo's/misc ing slips:

Handle on a case-by-case basis; coordinate with the senior
reviewer.

Signature Sheets:

Do not review; (Note: this may change for the folders
containing only signature sheets).

Other Items:

If items are found in the files that are not covered by the
above guidelines, consult with a senior reviewer.

DRAEL

19 October 1994
Addendum to REVIEW OF JFK WORK FILES, Dated 10/18/94: Processing Details.

- All documents that are confirmed duplicates of items previously processed for release
will be identified with a post-it marked with the Oswald or JFK box number and folder
number.

- All documents stamped with an FOIA number are presumed duplicates of items
processed in the original Oswald or JFK boxes. They need no further marking; but do not
remove any notes regarding duplication that you might have made in your initial review.

" ~ All newspaper articles and most other open source items will not be given any processing

and need not be flagged. An open source item that might not be widely available, was not
previously processed and seems significant may be processed for release.

- Non-relevant documents: the occasional non-relevant item should be checked as a
possible duplicate, since we were required by law to process the whole JFK file regardless
of relevancy. Larger groups of documents that are clearly justified as non-relevant should
be pink-banded with a brief statement of justification entered on the band.

- The documents selected for release to NARA should be accummulated in a folder
marked with the appropriate Holmes box number. The documents themselves should be
marked with the folder number. :

Documents selected for sanitized release will require a copy for yellow sanitizing and
HRG retention and a final redacted copy for NARA; place the original file copy with the
sanitized copy in the HRG retention file and another copy back in the Holmes box. The
original file copy of documents to be released in full should be provided to NARA, with a
copy placed in the HRG retention file and a copy placed in the Holmes box. For a lengthy
document to be released in full a copy of the cover or first page with a ‘hote indicating its
retention in HRG will be sufficient for the Holmes box. In the unlikely event of a unique,
relevant document that must be denied in full,white band it and place it in the HRG
retention file; place a copy in the Holmes file.

- True originals (not cables, dispatches, CSs, etc) of documents previously released in full
should be removed from the Holmes file and collected in a separate envelope for
forwarding to NARA. Use a post-it_to mark the NARA copy with box and folder
numbers. Reproduce a copy for the Holmes file. True originals of documents released
sanitized should also be placed in the HRG retention file with a copy in the Holmes file.

PRELIMINARY REVIEW OF WORKING FILES (SIX BOXES)

BOX 1. Contains 16 folders on Lucien Conein, former OSS type
and long time Agency paramilitary officer (Viet Nam). All
folders contain only administrative papers from mid 1940s
concerning Conein's pay, awards, transfers, etc. -- nothing
even remotely connected to JFK or the time period of the
assassination. Entire file, inexplicably, microfilmed for
HSCA and appears in microfilm print box 4, folders 11-26 (16
folders) all declared non-relevant. A 17th folder is in
microfilm box 57, folder 6. These files in ancillary box 1
of 6 were apparently the file copies that were microfilmed.
Three additional folders in box 1:

- Administratice memos and records re the JFK files and
related FOIA requests (1980-1992).

~ “HSCA ~77~-'78 memos”. These are administrative memoranda
to and from HSCA, mostly concerning relations between CIA
and HSCA, as opposed to the numerous HSCA requests for
information and CIA responses found in the primary JFK
files.

- “Sequestered HSCA - CIA Documents Correspondence”. More
administratice memos similar to those in the immediately
previous folder.

There is no justification for processing the 17 Conein
folders. The last three folders contain nothing of direct
substantive value regarding the JFK assassination, but they
might be of some usefulness to researchers by enhancing
their understanding of the handling of the assassination
records. _

Box 2. The entire box contains documents on Gerald Patrick
Hemming, anti-Castro soldier of fortune and long time pain
for CIA with which he claimed affiliation (untrue except for
a few contact reports he volunteered). All of the documents
in twelve dated folders, one folder with a blank label, and
the loose documentstin the front of the box are duplicates
of documents processed in the primary JFK file. Each of
these documents is marked with the JFK box and folder
number, usually identified as “HSCA box #...”. The last
folder, a red-brown portfolio, contains documents that
apparently are responsive to two Hemming Privacy Act
requests. Many of these are recognized duplicates but would
have to be checked in the index to be sure of all of them.
The rest of the box (i.e., the 13 folders.and the loose
documents) needs no further review.
