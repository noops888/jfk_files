Czech Embassy, Washington, D. C. CESAR DIOSDADO, Customs

Agent, Key West; who handles CIA matters, found this letter

in subject's possession. POSADA said it was his understanding

that subject may have been interested in returning to Cuba

and thus wrote to the Czech Embassy, or he possibly

obtained the letter for his protection in case he was

caught on a trip into Cuba; the letter would tend to show

he desired to go back to Cuba. -
POSADA said CIA had planned to have him conduct

investigation to ascertain subject's possible pro-CASTRO

sympathy.

rt On July 21, 1967, AUSTIN HORN, CIA Covert, Miami,

> stated CIA had terminated interest in subject in June, 1965,
and posséssed no derosatery information on him. Subject
was reported to have vanished and rumors placed him in
New York or possibly in Cuba looking for new refugees.
Mr. HORN described ayer as extremely fat and owning a

white convertible. AW)
