AMWHIP/1 stated further that AMLASH had decided that he should
like to have the meeting in Rome and ‘that it should take place
sometime before the ‘end of January (since it is now known that
AMBIDDY intends to go to Europe during’ the first part of the
week of the 18th, its quite possible the meeting will take
Place during the week of the sel, AMWHIP said that he would
not have an unlimited amount of time this time to be in Europe.
We-said. we understood this and told AMWHIP that “Nick” (N,
Sanchez) likewise could only devote 3 or 4 days to European
meetings. It was agreed, therefore, that for the best
utilization of both men's time,they should coordinate their
travels to Europe,

3. Silencer: AMWHIP opened this subject by saying that
he wanted to get something off his mind even though he was
aware that we were always reluctant to discuss this subject,
He stated that he would be able to get a silencer for a
“M-3 rifle" for $125.00. We suggested that he discuss this,

eead alive Chet”
subject with "Nick" y pioneers the silencer should, be a subject
for discussion between AMLASH and AMBIDDY. AMWHIP/] stated
that he understood our position on this point. We then pro-
ceeded on he other subjects,

4, “AMLASH’3: In response to a request from WH’SA/CI
(Tansing) we brought up the subject of AMLASII ‘3, In summary,
AMWHIP did not have anything to add to his picture of AMLASH 3.
that he has not already discussed previously with N. Sanchez,
However, for the record we will include a summary of our con-

versations concerning AMLASH ’3. AMMHIP 1 vated he had known



pd

AMLASH ‘3 for many years, (since school days) but did not
consider him to be a close friend. He knew AMLASH ‘3's
family as he had sold Jewelry to them from time to time
during; the Batista era in Havana, AMWHIP 71 believed
aan had been associated with the University but had
not actually been a bonafied student, He knew nothing
else about AMLASH ‘3's educational background, AMLASH ‘3
BSS known ABAE 1 son 10 or 12 years. It was the opinion

of AMWHIP’1 that AMLASH ‘3 was "100% loyal to a".

1 further stated that aside from his rather strong interest

in liquor and attendant belligerency when drunk, AMLASH ‘3

was not open to corruption through financial inducement

or other material rewards. He stated that AMLASH ‘3 was al-
A having

ready rather involved with 1 and his plotting, znd

to AMWHIP ‘1, £. MXAMEASHXEY fhas become extremely nervous as

result of his participation in the AMLASH Planping and has, in
SEREESLSacSasD “Senet Diba Se

fact, recently resigned his position a: He

wants to return to the study of medicine and to complete his
work for an M.D. degree. We pointed out to AMWHIP "1, and he
agreed with us, that such action would not particularly serve
foadd any protection to __|posttion, but possibly would
merely call more attention to sihtstion

Ne attempted to explore the details of AMLASH 3's re-

cruttment for subsequent dispatch to Spain by the ps1, ASWHIP


sated that he had given this information to, he believed,
both “Nick” and to Growery in Europe.: He knew the nan who
had Ata@/ Bianco in Cuba as being | 2 notorious DST
operator, He could not recali the mo put stated he had
Provided it before on & previous occasion, He did not

know any of the details of ANLASH 3's activation in Madrid
oF of. his contact with Luis Manuel CANTILLO Toloic, AMWHIP
said he was aware Ht only of the fact that AMLASH/3 had
been in the company of, Cts Manuel". ANWHEP ‘1, however,

offered to elicit as much information as possible about the
AMLASH 3 ‘CANTILLO relationship. He asked for a briefing or
& list of questions prior to his next meeting with AMLASH’3
in Europe.

In discussing the loyalties of AMLASH 3 and the re-
sultant security implications for the AMLASH operation,
AMWHIP stated (see above) that he was absolutely certain
that A\LASH 3 would never intentionally reveal any thing
to anyone which would jeopardize AMLASH 1. (Case Officer
Conment: In discussing Security ramifications of AMLASH ‘3's
knowledge of the AMLASH 1 AMBIDDY relationship, bemh in the
LMght of his DSI assocétions, it could be concluded that since
AMBIDDY is now tied closely to AMLASH 1, AMLASH 3 will also
protect AMBIDDY.)

During the discussion of AMLASH 3, AWWHIP 1 expressed
mild amazement over the fact that we continued to doubt A 3's
bonafides when AMLASH 1, who had he head ox omieck, tind
enoush confidence in the man to include him tram some of hin

mout compromising activities, To sumeartze our position in
