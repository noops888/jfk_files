it;

1. This memorandum requests that addressees identify

staff employees for overtime, after-hours work on Agency

records related to President

nation.

John F. Kennedy's assassi-

The overtime will be paid by the Center for the

study of Intelligence.

The request stems from a requirement

in the JFK Assassination Records Act that all relevant

government documents be reviewed for declassification and

transferred to the National Archives by 22 August 1993.

2. The specific task for which assistance is needed is

indexing of data into an automated system and ultimately

producing computer-generated forms called "identification

aids. "

form

This involves keying in infornation onto a pre-set

that appears on a personal computer screen.

(Experi-

ence in indexing or as a document analyst is necessary.)

The Act cited above requires that each document transferred

to the National Archives have attached to it such an aid.

The same information that is developed in the aids will-be

produced on diskettes that will be forwarded to the National

Archives for use in compiling an electronic index.

3. We estimate that it will require up to 20 people

working 10 hours of overtime per week, probably beginning ir

early June, to meet our deadline. The work will be done in

the office of the Historical Review Group, in Ames Building.

The preferred hours would be Monday-Friday, 1630-1830, or

1700-1900, and there may be work on Saturday as well.

SUBJECT:

Executive Director

Completing Work on JFK Assassination Records

1. Your office has asked whether additional resources are

needed to complete work on the JEK records by the deadline

established by Congress of 22 August 1993. Barring th

unforeseen, we should meet the deadline.

The Historical Review Group expects to complete review of

(some 250,000 pages) by early June.

Since

coordination with the directorates has lagged, we have taken steps

to increase the number of directorate reviewers. The DO has

approximately doubled the number of reviewers to eight. They are

committed to adding additional resources if required.

3. The second problem is the need to prepare identification

aids for every document transferred to the National Archives.

have given approval

for up to 20 indexers and document analysts to

work overtime on this effort.

4.

A potential problem exists in processing a box of

microfilm, which contains the equivalent of some 172,000 pages of

additional material.

The Historical Review Group believes a large

part consists of duplicates of material already reviewed.

They

should know whether this assumption is correct within the next few

days. In any event, I will assign additional resources if needed.

5. The President has yet to name the Review Board called for

oy the JFK Act; therefore, we cannot determine whether the boar

vill have additional requirements for us.

Review of JFK Documents

Following are additional steps being taken to complete

the declassification of the JFK records:

1. We are arranging to bring in at least 20 indexers

to work overtime on inputting information into the

data base from which identification forms will be

printed.

- Estimated overtime cost: $50,000 (could go

higher, depending on number of people we need).

- On 5 April the EXDIR gave approval for up to

20 indexers at cost of $3-4,000 weekly.

The microfilm file is to be printed out in hard

copy as soon as possible.

- Estimated contractor cost: $17,000.

- Contractor selected by LOGS is Octo Inc,

Laurel, Md.

Comments on Gunn Draft "Board Timetable for Review

of CIA Records

I agree with Gunn in the need for a plan and schedule

others are not necessarily the most efficient way of

CIA Sequestered Collection

1. "The 63 boxes"

Record Identification Forms (RIFs) / Identification

Aids: ARRB staff is confused about our process.

We are

currently indexing folders that were "unit" indexed la

single Iden Aid for a folder) and marked Category #1 by ARRB

staff--only seven folders to go.

We don't cut the extract

and create the disk for the Staff until boxes are ready to

be reviewed. We can run the extract program and send them

disk anytime. I don't consider this a review issue.

When Marwell approved the "priority 1" folder approach,

I told him we would complete the review in the Fall. We

appear to be on track to complete the review by the end of

October or early November.

Priority Folders 2, 3 and 4: My understanding with

Marwell was that these

folders would drop to the end of the

list, after HSCA and Microfilm.

To start the review of

these folders in November (to meet 31 Jan 98 deadline) would

divert resources

from other activities and reviews.

It

would also require additional indexing support-- there are

still a number of unit indexed folders in these folders.

Open in Full/Release in Full documents:

Except for a

few folders in boxes 32/33, the Summers completed the

processing of RIF documents through box 38. Boxes 1-19 (1202

documents/3719 pages) have been sent to ARRB for NARA;

boxes 20-38 will go in the next few weeks). I will need to

discuss with Gunn the rest of the Collection. My suggestion

if the complete the DO review of the RIFs, but delay

processing for now.

## Page 20

2.

HSCA Staff notes: re-review will be completed this

month (HSCA was Marwell top priority).

The Open in full HSCA documents are a processing

headache.

Our copy has be matched against the originals

currently being held by ARRB.

The originals do not have

Iden Aids. This is a time consumer activity.

3. Microfilm

I had planned to start the re-review of the Microfilm

in November (Gunn's date) and his end date (6/30/98) is

beyond what I projected.

Designating specific boxes to be

completed by specific dates is not practical. I will

suggest he designate the number of boxes to be completed by

certain dates if he feels he needs milestones.

ISSUES:

If ARRB insist in our reviewing the Priority 2,3 and 4s

in the hardcopy collections it will slow down the Microfilm

review.

I have had discussion with members of the staff about

doing a

"Priority #1" folder review of the Microfilm. I will

recommend that they do so.

It ensures that the most

important information is release first and avoids both

staffs getting bogged down in processing marginal documents.

We have to decide on the indexing requirements for the

Microfilm (Gunn is proposing that documents containing

redaction be identified individually -- have NARA numbers).

Do we:

a) index all documents

b)

index only documents with redactions

develop an alternative that meets ARRB requirements

but does not include indexing individual documents.

Oswald Microfilm: no problem with Gunn's approach

Working Files

I have a problem with Gunn'

proposal. To index a collection that is primarily duplicates

seems to be a waste of resources. Indexing at the folder

level should suffice for the historians assuming we do not

challenge the designation of the files as assassination

records.

New documents would be indexed individually.

:

---

## Page 21

13-00000

To fully index this collection involves a resource cost

not anticipated when we discussed the completion of the

project by October 1968 with Marwell.

To begin the reviev

of these files by 1 October 1998 is not feasible given other

priorities and current resources.

Additional Records and Referrals: no problem as stated.

Could be resource issue if the number continue to increase.

Proposed ARRB Timetable for Re

eview of ClA Records

â€¢ I. Background

The CIA Team has developed a preliminary timetable that we hope will provide a

reasonable framework for completing our revlew of CIA's assassination records by

August 1, 1998. We are creating this timetable for three purposes:

First, to establish our own working target dates to measure Review Board progress

against the mandatory deadline established by the JFK Act.

Second, to provide CIA with our best assessment of the order and scope of our review

so that it can make its own internal judgments on the proper allocation of its resources.

We provided CIA prior drafts of this memo and solicited its specific advice and

suggestions for better ways to accomplish our goals. [We have not asked CIA to

"agree" to these deadlines, but we have encouraged it to provide alternative

suggestions on how best to meet the August 1 deadline.]

Third, to solicit the Review Board's advice regarding "enforcement" of these (or other)

targets. Although we surely hope that both the ARRB staff and ClA will be able to meet

the targets, and although we certainly plan to make all reasonable accommodations for

problems that no doubt will arise, we nevertheless anticipate that it is possible that CIA

might not be able to keep to these timetables. Thus, we anticipate that there may well

be times when blocks of records scheduled for Board review will not have been fully

processed by CIA. It is our judgment that, in keeping with our commitment to

Congress and to the goals of the JFK Act, we may need to have the Board act on groups

of records for which CIA has not completed its initial review. At the risk of over-

repetition, the ARRB staff seeks to be as reasonable and accommodating as it can on

timetables, provided that any proposed changes are consistent with our obligation to

complete the task. We realize that this review may have resource allocation

*By establishing this target date, we will provide ourselves with a two-month

cushion to handle possible appeals and miscellaneous issues that doubtless will arise.

consequences for CIA and we expect to refine this timetable both to minimize the

resource impact and to allow us and the CIA to proceed most efficiently with the ti

on schedule. Is the Board prepared to make decisions on records if CIA has not

completed its review and to enforce those decisions?

Il. Issues applying to all CIA record groups

Records to be opened-in-full

During the course of CIA's review, it frequently identifies records that is it

is prepared to open in full without Board action. Although there is a

benefit in promptly forwarding such records to NARA, it is less expensive

for CIA to process these records during the summer months.

Accordingly, we are prepared to agree with ClA that it may delay.

processing such records, provided that all such processing of open-in-full

records will be completed by August 30, 1998.

Duplicates

CIA will continue to identify duplicates and may process them after all

other documents have been reviewed and transferred to NARA. If the

ARRB is shown that any given record is a duplicate, CIA need not

complete the processing before September 30, 1998.

III. CIA Record Groups

A. Oswald 201 File (17 boxes)

- current status:

review completed (with a few minor exceptions)

B. CIA Sequestered Collection

1. "The 63 boxes"

- current status:

The ARRB staff has completed a survey of the 63 boxes (on the

folder level) and has assigned each folder a relevance priority on a

1 to 4 scale. CIA has completed its declassification review of

roughly 66% of the priority 1 folders.

The ARRB Staff has completed its own review of approximately

50% of the prioxity 1 records and those records have been (or

shortly will) be voted on by the Board.

additional records that should be reviewed by the Board.

The ARRB staff has.no objection to the records being identified entirely on the

folder level provided that all records in the folder are open-in-full. If there are records

in which the CIA is requesting redactions, those records must be identified

individually. The remainder of open-in-full records may still be identified with one RIF

as being the contents of the same folder.

- issue:

The vast majority (if riot all) Oswald Microfilm records are

duplicates of records the Board has already reviewed under the JFK

Act. To the extent that the records previously have been reviewed,

there is little value in re-reviewing the records. The ARRB staff will

survey the Microfilm 201 in an effort to identify any additional

records that have not already been acted upon by the Board. All

records not previously acted upon by the Board will be so

designated, a RIF will be prepared, and they will be sent for Board

action. The remaining Microfilm 201 will be transferred to the JFK

Collection at NARA and opened in full in 2017:

Staff has completed its initial survey and has thus far identified no

recoras in the 201 Microfilm that are not already in the JiK

Collection.

C. "Working Files" (including "Russ Holmes" papers, etc.)

- status:

No Record Identification Forms have been prepared. ARRB staff

has conducted a general survey.

- target dates:

Work to commence by CIA on October 1, 1997. CIA should

prepare Record Identification Forns for all records by January 1,

1998. Completion of review and Board determinations by March

31, 1998.

-strategy:

The "working files" is a group of records that was assembled at

CIA by Russ Holmes. Although he was not asked formally by CIA

to create this separate records group, he did so in order to facilitate

his work and, perhaps, to satisfy his own curiosity. The group

contains many original records (copies of some of which are

already in the collection) and it includes some records of which we

are aware of no other copies. It is the best-organized collection of

assassination records held by CIA. Its value as a reference tool is

greatest as a collection. Therefore, though the file contains many

duplicates of records found in the JFK collection; the ARRB staff

recommends that it be preserved as a single group. Duplicates and

open-in-full documents should be treated in the same manner as

they are in the rest of the JFK Collection As with the microfilm

from the Sequestered Collection, the ARRB staff has no objection to

the records being identified on the folder level provided that all

records in the folder are open-in-full. If there are records in which

CIA is requesting redactions, those records must be identified

individually. The remainder of open in full records may still be

identified with one RIF as being the contents of the same folder.

D. Additional Records

- status:

Research, requests, and negotiations continue to identify and

include additional CIA records for the JFK collection.

Oswald Office of Security File. As a result of an ARRB staff request

for additional information and records, CIA located portions of a

previously undisclosed Office of Security file on Lee Harvey

Oswald. This seven-volume file, of which six parts have been

located, contains two volumes of press clippings, third agency

material on Oswald, a copy of Oswald's address book, and Marina

Oswald's INS file. In the upcoming months CIA will begin to

review and process these materials.

- time line:

Completion by July 31, 1998.

Strategy:

Continue current efforts.

Re: Completing the Review of IF'K Assassination Records

Dear Mr. Carey:

I would like to congratulate you on your new appointment at the Agency and wish you

the very best of success in the difficult challenges that lie ahead.

As you probably are aware, the Assassination Records Review Board has been

mandated by Congress and the President to oversee the declassification and transfer to

the National Archives of all records related to the assassination of President Kennedy.

During the past three years we have received excellent cooperation from CIA in regard

to the processing of the relevant Agency records. From our perspective, this is due in

significant part to the work of John Pereira, Chief of the Historical Review Group, and

J. Barry Harrelson, who has shouldered the extremely complicated, burdensome, and

frequently thankless task of overseeing the project. Both of them have proved to be

superb representatives of the Agency. We also very much appreciated receiving a

strong message of support from your predecessor, Nora Slatkin, who advised us in a

meeting on October 16, 1996, of her full support for the project and her willingness to

commit the necessary Agency resources to complete the project..

Because the Review Board is now in the final twelve months of its statutory tenure, I

thought it would be appropriate to advise you of our goals for the upcoming year. It is

our wish to be able to state in our Final Report to the President and to Congress that

CIA has made all reasonable attempts to locate, review, and declassify all available

records on the Kennedy assassination. We would like the Review Board to be able to

assure the American people that the Agency has been fully cooperative in this

enormous and difficult task, and that the Agency no longer retains any "secret" files on

the assassination. In addition, we are obligated to keep Congress informed, on a

monthly basis, of the status of our work and any difficulties that would interfere with

our ability to achieve our objective.

Although many important strides have been made to further our goals, we nevertheless

perceive that the pace of review and declassification of Agency records will need to be

---

## Page 29

13-00000

Mr. David W. Carey

Page 2

accelerated in order for us to succeed. We must keep in mind that the goal includes

reviewing, processing, and transterring to the custody of the National Archives all

identified assassination records by September 1, 1998. (We do not perceive that

duplicate copies of such records need be transferred by September 1.) Many time-

consuming difficulties inherent in this project have been overcome, and we perceive

that the pace of review is accelerating. Nevertheless, we wanted to signal to you our

concern that, unless the pace of review increases further, we may not be on target to

satisfy what I hope to be our common objective.

It is our firm intention to complete our task within the congressionally mandated time

limit. If CIA is unable to pre-review and process its records consistent with completion

of this task, the Review Board will vote to release-in-full all relevant CIA records and

mandate that custody be transferred to the National Archives in a timely way. We

sincerely hope that it will not be necessary for the Board to make wholesale decisions on

unreviewed records and we will be pleased to work with the Agency to see that such a

step is unnecessary. But we are prepared to make such decisions to the extent they are

required to fulfill our own responsibilities. Although it is our perception that CIA may

wish to devote additional human resources to this project, we of course leave such

decisions to the sound judgment of knowledgeable CIA officials.

We therefore strongly urge the Agency to take all appropriate steps to complete its

review of records in an orderly and systematic manner. To the extent that the Agency is

able to satisfy appropriate deadlines, there will be no need for us to resort to any

unfortunate - but potentially necessary - measures to complete our own obligations to

Congress, the President, and the American people.

If you would find it helpful, the Review Board members and I would be pleased to

discuss these issues with you or others at the Agency.

Sincerely,

-

31 October 1997

Request for Additional Funds for the JFK Assassination

Records

Review Project, through 31 September 1998.

Reference: Ltr. to Executive Director form J. Jeremy Gunn,

Executive Director, Assassination Records Review Board

(ARRB), copy attached.

Background.

1. The ARRB will go out of business on 31 September

1998. Before that date, it has a statutory obligation to

complete its review of all records held by the u.s.

Government which relate to the assassination of President

Kennedy, determine those which are relevant to the

assassination story and ensure that the same are transferred

to the National Archives.

As the board begins its final

year, it has become increasingly concerned about the pace of

the review and transfer process.

Referent letter is the

latest of a number of exchanges

dealing with that concern.

2. CSI/HRG has carefully reviewed its current position

with respect to its ability to meet the deadlines imposed

and has concluded that it cannot fully do so without

additional resources, at least through 30 September 1998:

This conclusion is based in large measure on three changed

circumstances:

A.

The ARRB has recently exercised its statutory

authority and designated additional CIA records to be within

the JFK collection (to date approximately twenty cubic feet

or 40,000 pages). Additional records may be identified

as

the ARRB staff continues its review of Agency files.

B. Over the past three months we have received an

increase in the number of

"Assassination Records" referred

from third agencies which include both Agency documents held

by another agency or third agency documents which must be

reviewed because they contain CIA information; and

C. The ARRB itself has established a deadline which was

not anticipated.

All agencies had understood that the

review process

and ARRB action would have to be completed by

30 September, but it was widely assumed that final

processing and transfer of the documents to the National

Archives could occur after that date. However, the Board has

now mandated that all relevant records which are not

duplicates must be transferred to custody of the National

Archives before it goes out of business.

Additional Resources Requested.

3. The following estimate is based on our understanding

of the ARRB requirements at this time.

A. Review of records: equivalent of 2 man-years (3

contractors -- average daily contractor cost

$270) ;

B. Preparation of documents for National Archives:

equivalent of 1.5 man-years (2 contractors

average daily contractor cost $180);

c.

Indexing: approximately one-man year of overtime

($25 hourly rate) ;

D. Reproduction: approximately one-man year of

overtime ($25 hourly rate).

Estimated cost FY98: $300,000

How many people do you have working on the JFK project now?

JFK PROJECT

-

The following is in response to your request for a

statement "reaffirming" CSI's commitment to apply available

resources to complete the processing of records related to

the assassination of President Kennedy.

As Jeremy Gunn stated in his letter of 28 October to the

EXDIR,

the pace of reviewing JFK-related documents is

accelerating.

He also stated that the JFK Board has

established 1 September 1998 as the deadline for all

agencies to finish the processing of records and transfer

them to the National Archives.

In order to complete all the necessary tasks required by

the Board and meet the deadline, we will clearly need to

increase the resources now dedicated to JFK. There are a

growing number of requests from the Board to review records

from both CIA and other agencies, to search files for

additional information, and to brief the Board and its

staff.

At present, one staff officer and 13 part time

independent contractors are devoted to JFK.

In addition, we

draw on a small CSI computer unit for support and share

overtime employees who perform indexing and document copying

for the Center.

In the absence of additional resources being provided

from elsewhere, CSI (or OIM) will need to shift resources

from other projects to JFk for all tasks to be done on time.

ouch as that on.

One option is to interrupt other declassification projects,

such as that on DI finished intelligence on the Soviet

Union,

and the Guatemala covert action, and assign reviewers

and others working on those projects to JFK. The moves

would need to happen in the next few weeks.

Another important consideration is that the

directorates, particularly the DO, will need to increase

their resources to keep pace with HRG. These resources are

required to coordinate declassification of records and to

prepare responses for requests from the Board for additional

information and files.

Whatever resource adjustments are made to bolster the

effort on JFK, there will still be an unpredictable factor

that could require a surge in additional resources later.

This stems from the potentially large number of documents .

from the FBI and other agencies containing CIA equities that

the Board could ask us to review.

There is a good chance

that such documents will surface near the September

deadline, which would leave little time to complete the

processing.

Dear DI. Gunn:

Thank you for your letter of 28 October in which you

outline the Assassination Records Review Board's goals for

the coming year.

I appreciate the complimentary remarke you

made about the "excellent cooperation" that CIA has been

providing to the Board.

You raised a concern that the Agency may not be able to

increase sufficiently the pace of the review process to meet

the 1 September 1998 deadline for completing the traisfer of

records to the National Archives. You also expressed the

view that if any records are not reviewed by the deadline,

the Board will vote to release them in full and mandate that

custody be transferred to the National Archives.

You can be assured that we are conmitted to taking all

necessary steps to meet our statutory obligation to review

all of the Agency's assassination-related materials.

It is

important that a proper review of all relevant records be

done. This will allow us to recoumend to the Board what

information warrants continued protection.

We appreciate the great responsibility that Congress

and: the President have given to the Board to inform the

American people about the assassination.

We share the

Board's goal of declassifying and releasing the relevant

records to the fullest extent possible.

Please convey my regards to Chairman Tunheim and the

other Board

members, and assure them of our continued

cooperation.

SAIC Contract Costs

Hello to All-

l've received an estimate from SAIC for contract costs for our next option period, 1 Apr 98 - 31 Mar 99. I wanted to get this information

to you early for planning purposes. / stress that these figures are estimates because we would like to change our contract vehicle from

the current Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee (CPFF) to a Cost-Plus-Award-Fee (CPAF contract. With the current CPFF contract, we have very little

leverage to ensure quality service. Although we have not had any problems with SAIC to date, we would feel more comfortable with a

CPAF vehicle. SAIC has not been notified yet of our desire to change.

We currently pay an 8% fee on our CPFF contract. Because, in switching to CPAF contract, the contractor assumes more risk, our fee

offer will probably go up to 9% or 9.5% (our original position will be to remain at 8%. In your planning you may want to add the

difference to give you a grand total.

Right now the pricing, broken down by office for 1 Apr 98 - 31 Mar 99, is:

OFL/Contracts will begin negotiations with SAIC sometime this month. In the past we have incrementally funded our contract so I don't

expect we'll need the total up front. That being said, Contracts will probably require 50% commitments from each office lif you want to

fully fund the effort, please feel free). I'll keep you posted as / receive more information.

Talking Points For Meeting of the Historical Review Panel

Subject: JFK Assassination Records Review Project

Background (1992 - 1995)

The setting up of the Historical Review Program

coincided with growing interest in Congress to require

agencies to declassify records related to the assassination

of President Kennedy.

a. DCI Gates decided to start declassification process

before Congress passed legislation

--

b. DCI testified in Congress about "Openness Policy"

(May 1992)

--First folder of OSWALD 201 (also know as the

pre-assassination file) released

c. JFK Act passed late 1992:

--Called for Presidential-appointed Assassination

Records Review Board (ARRB).

d. First two years the Program focused on JFK with two

major releases (August 1993 and August 1994)

-- Approximately 227,000 pages from CIA files were

released in full or in sanitized form

Committee 03c

-- In addition reviewed material at NARA (Wairen

Committee), SSCI (Church Committee) and Ford

Library (Rockefeller Commission) plus numerous

referrals from other Agencies (FBI, STATE, Army, etc.)

e.

The Assassination Records Review Board did not

actually begin reviewing documents until May 1995.

--Reasons: Delays in appointment of members and

hiring of staff and the time required to obtain

security clearances

ARRB (1995 to present)

Board's interpretation of the law created a time-

onsuming, labor intensive review process

i11 sanitized records had be reviewed by the Boarc

and action taken on each postponed item.

Specific evidence of current harm was required for

each postponement.

a. HRP began a re-review of the material previously

release.

-- Approximately 80% of the 227,000 pages release

in 1993/1994 contained deletions.

- Resources added to JFK project to meet Board's

monthly deadlines (reviewers borrowed from other

projects.

evidence so defecan commended pust ementsed to prepare

time cost comparable to court legations

-- Frequently only a few documents or words are

at issue.

- usually the information is marginal or not

germane to the assassination story.

EXAMPLES:

*It took over two weeks of staff time, numerous

meetings, and at least two Board sessions to protect

the specific location of an Agency's facility in a few

documents. The release of the location would have added

assassination story.

* 100s of hours have been expended in research to

protect approximately 2000 names of agency employees

and assets that appear in the material.

ARRB Special requests/searches for additional

records have added to the overall cost of the project. .

-- 34 written requests, some requiring screening large

blocks of records from

the archives including files

Office of the DDCI and DDP files for the JFK time-frame

(1959-64) in search of additional records.

-- Others require extensive research such as checking

old financial and travel records.

d. (Summer 1997) Additional resources added to the JFK

project as a result of changes in ARRB's review process that

greatly increased the Board's ability to act on documents.

-- Dramatic increase in the number of documents

acted on by Board each month:

March 1997 -

92 documents

March 1998 - 1281 documents

e. Board receives extension through FY 1998; mandated

completion of review by September 1998.

- Starting in December 1997, reviewers (11)

shifted from other projects to JFK to meet the

Board's deadline;
