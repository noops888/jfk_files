HCS advised LA ROCCA 1s visiting Florida and it is believed

the residence of GABRIEL "KELLY" MANNARINO, Pittsburgh and

National Top Hoodlum.

Miami has been requested to ascertain whether LA ROCCA is

visiting at the aforementioned address.

Miami is also being requested to contact reliable criminal

Informants in this regard. It is believed that JOSEPH MEROLA,

former Pittsburgh resident now residing Miami, may be of

assistance in this regard.

IN VIEW OF THE CONVICTION OF LA ROCCA FOR ASSAULT WITH INTENT

TO KILL AND HIS ARREST FOR CARRYING A CONCEALED WEAPON, HE

MAY BE ARMED AND SHOULD BE CONSIDERED DANGEROUS.
