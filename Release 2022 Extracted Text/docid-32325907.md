jail at Ft. Worth, Texas, fighting extradition to California.

On 1/9/64, SOOST said that he understood WINTERS
was still in jail at Ft. Worth, Texas, awaiting the outcome
of his appeal of an extradition case ruling and his wife,
JAMIELLE, was working as a waitress in a cocktail lounge in
either Ft. Worth or Dallas. 4

On 1/20/64, SOOST said that Mrs. RENORA LEBECK of |
Bull Run Rd., Ewing Township, Trenton, N.J., notified him
she was leaving for Ft. Worth, Texas, as her son, ROBERT PAUL
WINTERS, had attempted to blind himself by scratching out
his eyes at the Tarrant County Jail, Ft. Worth, Texas. He
said Mrs. LEBECK told him her son had lost the sight of one j
eye and would loose probably the sight of the other eye. i

On 2/11, 26, 29/64, SOOST advised that he understood
bail had been reduced on ROBERT PAUL WINTERS in Ft. Worth,
Texas, and California had dropped charges against him and he
would be returned to Mercer County, N.J., to stay with his
mother at 140 Bull Run Rd., Ewing Township, N.J.

SOOST, on 3/5/64, said he had arranged to have
WINTERS brought into Mercer County Court, Trenton, on that i
date with his wife, so that he could be released from the i
bonds he had put up on both of them. He said that because :
WINTERS had blinded himself in one eye and the sight was |
poor in the other, Mercer County Judge GEORGE H. BARLOW 1
had released WINTERSS and his wife in their own recognizance |
on charges against them in Mercer County, N.J. |

On 3/13/64 and 3/18/64, SOOST said he had learned that
DAVID FRED HAGLER had been piloting a plane from Florida H
to Texas and it was wrecked in Texas. He said that HAGLER i
had indicated he had problems in Texas involving the airplane i
and he was considering returning to New Jersey to try and find :
some employment.
