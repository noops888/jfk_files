jail at Ft. Worth, Texas, fighting extradition to California.

On 1/9/64, SOOST said that he understood WINTERS

was still in jail at Ft. Worth, Texas, awaiting the outcome

of his appeal of an extradition case ruling and his wife,

JAMIELLE,

was working as a waitress in a cocktail lounge

either Ft. Worth or Dallas.

in

On 1/20/64, SOOST said that Mrs. RENORA LEBECK of

Bull Run Rd., Ewing

Township, Trenton, N.J., notified him

she was leaving for Ft. Worth,

Texas,

as

her son, ROBERT PAUL

WINTERS, had attempted to blind himself by scratching out

his eyes at the Tarrant County Jail, Ft. Worth, Texas.

He

said Mrs. LEBECK told him her son had lost the sight of one

eye and would loose probably the sight of the other eye.

On 2/11, 26, 29/64, SOOST advised that he understood

bail had been reduced

On ROBERT PAUL WINTERS in Ft.

Worth,

Texas, and California had dropped charges against him and he

would be returned to Mercer County, N.J., to stay with his

mother at 140 Bull Run Rd., Ewing

Township, N.J.

SOOST, on 3/5/64, said he had arranged to have

WINTERS brought into Mercer County Court, Trenton, on that

date with his wife, so that he could be released from the

bonds he had put up on both of them. He said that because

WINTERS had blinded himself in one eye and the sight was

poor in the other, Mercer County Judge GEORGE H. BARLOW

had released WINTERSS and his wife in their own recognizance

on charges against them in Mercer County, N.J.

On 3/13/64 and 3/18/64, SOOST said he had learned that

DAVID FRED HAGLER had been piloting a plane from Florida

to Texas and it was wrecked in Texas.

He said that HAGLER

had indicated he had problems in Texas involving the airplane

and he was considering returning to New Jersey to try and find

some employment.

LEADS

DALLAS

AT FORT WORTH, TEXAS. Will advise the results of

any interviews that have been conducted with WINTERS when he

was confined at the Tarrant County Jail, Ft. Worth.

Will ascertain the details of' the release on bail

OI ROBERT PAUL WINTERS at the direction of the USA,

Ft.

Worth, and will advise where the federal warrants that were

lodged as detainers against WINTERS can be sent.
