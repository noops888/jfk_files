Dear Mr. Chairman:

I am writing to correct for the record two statements I
madg when I testified before the Committee,last Tuesday on
the Assassination Materials Disclosure Act.

I testified that there were 33,4documents, amounting to
approximately 110 pages, in the Oswald file that was
declassified and released to the public. A subsequent count
by my staff revealed that the file actually contains a total
of 34 documents, amounting to 124 pages. I gave the correct
numbers when I testified last Friday before the Subcommittee
on Legislation and National Security of the House Committee
on Government Operations.

In addition, I was asked'at your hearing by
Senator Cohen whether the State Department or the CIA had
had any contact with any Soviet officials concerning KGB or
GRU files relevant to the Kennedy assassination. I
answered that there had been no contact between the CIA and
the Russian KGB on this matter, and I added that the State
Department might have requested those files, but I was not
certain. At the time, I believed that that was an’ accurate
answer. I have since discovered, however, that in January
1992 an Agency official did ask the new Russian internal
service (MBRF) for any information related to the Kennedy
assassination. The Russians advised us, after reviewing
their file holdings on Oswald, that they had nothing that
would add to our knowledge or to the 22 November 1991 ABC
television special on this issue, which they termed
"detailed and objective.*

The Honorable John Glenn

To avoid disrupting our continuing efforts to gain
access to the Russian files on Oswald, the fact that the
Agency has had direct contacts with the Russian service on
this topic must remain classified. For the purpose of
correcting the public record, I suggest the following
unclassified statement:

In response to a request from the US embassy in
Moscow, the Russians have reviewed their file
holdings on Oswald. They have advised us that
they had nothing that would add to our knowledge
or to the 22 November 1991 ABC television special
on this issue, which they termed "detailed and
objective."

I enjoyed the opportunity to testify before the
Committee, and I hope that these corrections prove helpful.
A similar letter is being sent to Ranking Minority
Member Roth. :
