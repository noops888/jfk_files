Attached is a dxaft of the Subcommittee's report for
July and August on actions taken to counteract Castro-
commmist subversion in the hemisphere. ‘The draft has been

with certain modification. The CIA meuberys will note that I
have extracted from his submission the iteus of action taken
and placed these in the body of the report. The intelligence
information contained in the submission Ihave made into an

data fom part of the report, and request that in the future
the CIA member prepare his submis&ion in two parts.

May I have your comments on the draft by close of
business October 1, 1963.
