Service in Rio de Janiero, had been accused of "stealing"
his own cars. This specific case mentioned involved the rental
by MOSS on. 1/10/63, of a car to an individual in Rio de
Janiero, for 25 days. Ten days later the car was stolen
and was located by the police in the rear of MOSS' car rental
service,where reportedly it had been prepared for "transfer"
to a city in the southern part of Brazil. MOSS had already
filed an insurance claim for the loss on this vehicle. This
matter was discussed by the Legat, Rio de Janiero with SERGIO

During the latter part of March,,,1963, PCI JOHN MARCIGLIANO
advised SA JOHN D. SWIFT that JOH. webu RNS is a "Captain" wt 4
in Brooklyn, having succeeded JOHNNYROBERTS in his operatior
after ROBERTS 'death, He stated that JOHNNY BURNS is very

highly regarded among the hoodlum elements. He added that

JOHHNY BURNS has a brother PSALLISGURIS Who owns a florist

shop on Prince St., between Mott end Elizabeth Streets, NYC.
(Physical observation identified ‘this shop as the Cathedreale
sAnnyed 26 Prince St., NYC). The informant stated that

SALLYYBURNS is a big shylock and is never found at the
lorist shop which appears to be nothing more than a front,

The informant related that the aforenentioned SALLY
BURNS should not be confused with SALLY, BURNS (SALVATORE
GRANELLO), an. old timed’ combinatior man, who at one time was
worth a great deal of money and formerly owned a bar and restaurant

proprietor of the Village Owl Social Club, 234 Mulberry St., NYC,

NY 92-1108

It was the informant's impression that both "MUMMY" and
MORRELLI work in behalf of BURNS, who is from Brooklyn, on the
Lower East Side in the Elizabeth St. area.

On 4/9/63, spot checks in the vicinity of the residence of
UGO ANTONUCCI', 531 Palmer Rd., Yonkers, NY, failed to reflect any
pertinent activity. It is felt that additional checks should be

highly confidential source.

I36~W.56th St., NYC} as a possible "front" for‘hoodlum activities,

the above restaurant and well known celebrities in NY. Subsequent
investigation failed to indicate any violation of the WSTA Statute.
