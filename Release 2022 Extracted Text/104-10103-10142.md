Subject: Background on Mexico Stetion Support Assets

(Coverage of Soviet and Cuban Embassies)

1. Unilateral coverage. From the time the Mexico Station was opened in
April 1947 (by Bill Doyle) until arrival of Win Scott as COS in 1958, Charles
Anderson III (still in LA/HQ) had developed a support apparatus to ie
exploit leads from the Soviet Enbassy, This umbrella type vroject (LIFEAT)
consisted of multi line phone taps, three photo sites, a mobile surveillance
team and a mail intercept operation,

a. Fhone taps were placed by an employee of _ telephone company
who was handled by David WILSTED (noun). Sree of lines
tapped was Linitea"by availability of a listening post nearby
(since the taps were ct made in the main central) and English/

Spanish (Soviet, Polish, Czech, etc) transcribers. Generally

nts (mostly Mexican or Mexican American) were related

these ag
(which the station at that time felt was good security in that

if they talked about shop, they would talk to each other.)

e handled by Anderson with the help

b. Three photo sites
of Harry Mahoney (retired, living in Chicago) and TDY TSD

people checking the best type of camera, film, and concealment
devices. These had sub-cripts under LIFEAT (LIMITED, LILYRIC,

TED was a fixed site bang opposite across

and LICALLA), L

both a vehicle and foot entrance, The Soviet gate was on the

Northvest corner of their compound end LIMITED was diagonally

that block. LIMITED was the first base ard it operated strictly on an
exverimentel basis in the early stages. I think the Mexi Station bought

one storey
this property (a/Spanish Colonial stone house) through LIMOUSINE (check to
be sure). Later this house began to fall apart. This base was closed when
the Station got word thet the photo of "uniden man" was being released to the
public by the Warren Commission. The photo operators were moved to another apt
nearby. The property was sold (under an operational agreement with LIMOUSINE
for a long term lease on the top floor of @ new apartment blding to be built
on this site). LILYRIC was planned as an alternate photo base to LIMITED.
It was in an upper storey (3rd floor -check) on the sane side of the street
as LIMITED but in the middle of the block South, It had a slanted view of
the front gate of the Soviet Erbessy., The agents in LIMITED and LILYRIC (both

s) as far as we knew, were not acquainted with each other.

Mexican familie
LILYRIG was a rented apartment. LICALLA, the third photo site, was located
in one of a row of four houses on the South side of the Soviet Embassy compound

which the Mexico Station purchssed in about 1958 (check date), also usin,

LIMOUSINE as the purchaser (check). This site overlooked the back garden of
the Soviet Embassy compound. The curpose of this operation was to get good
identificetion photographs of the Soviet personnel (who at thet time vere largely

ion records). The three photo sites were handled by

unidentified in Mexico Sta

Ramon Alvarez (} an citizen of U.S. mother who taught elementary level at

the American School). Ramon collected the film qgGdhmrepabutmegtetm from LIMIT

‘D

s sister's husband, Carlos (Mexican doctor)

end LILYRIC three times a week,
develoyed and printed the film into &x10 aes print strips. The master plan
was for LICALLA film to ve we eer from 1957 to 1959 (Harper
Holt - resigned) could not handle the volume and as the wmprocessed film began
to accumulate, the inside CO (iMahoney) became disgusted and took the film out

ocess (probably early 1959), Thus Ramon became

LIMUST/‘1, etc). This was handled by Glen WIDDEN (outside TSD officer) and
Mahoney using HQ TDY teams for monitoring. This operation was also separate

from LICALLA, The two houses in between were rented to unsuspecting tenants.

ce. Mobile surveillance was developed by Anderson and leter placed
under Hahoney and Joseph Sancho, ‘This team consisted of a half

nts who used three to four late model cars and a

dozen or so a:

panel truck (which could be used on stake_outs for photo covera e).

The plen was to activete this group by radio (from LINITED BASE)
Soviet

when someone of interest left the/Embassy gate and stay with them

until they made their meetings. These agents knew about the LINITED

BASE befause they had LINITED photos for identification purposes,

This worked fairly well until about the middle of 1958 (check date)

when one of the surveillance agents got too close to his target and

was arrested by the xican transit police and turned over to the
Mexican Secret Service. By the time the Stetion could arrange through
a cleared attorney to bail him out (Judd Austin of the Goodrich,
Little and Riquelme firm), the agent. had identified Sancho (who was

evacuated across the border at Nogales by Bob Shaw) and the inside

phone number of Mahoney (who wes subsequently replaced by Louis

Puckett). As a result of ti flap, the LIFEAT project was broken

up into several others. The es

2. ‘Liaison coverage was unreliable and insecure as characterized by the nature
of the Mexican services at that time. The Mexican DFS (Direction of Federal
Security) with which ve dealt was e hip pocket group run out of the Ministry /
Of Government. This Ministry spent a major part of its time oh control of
‘foreigners and political investigations. Their agents were vicious, venal,
corrupt extortionists. Robert. Melberg established contact with one of them ae
Levine De Leon (later LIFIRE group) in about 1950 or 51. He gave them some :
training (a group of about five surveillance types) in travel control working
the airport as well as file searches-of names from DFS Hatrs! where the files
were poorly organized and often inaécurate, Now and then, however, some useful
information was developed but it could not be depended upon. :Melberg iwas
replaced by Fhil Roettinger (resigned and remained in Mexico), Mahoney, Thomas
Hazlitt, and Robert Feldmann. 6ve Ten Vex Giter )

During 1958, Win Scott met socially some of the chronies of the:
Mexican President elect, Adolfo Lopex Mateos. During this period, the U.S.
Ambassador Robert C, Hill (reflecting the policy of then Sec State J.F. Dulles)
was energetic in organizing groups to "fight communism", One of these seeds
grew into a proposal Miguel Aleman (jr. son of former Mexi President), acting
for Lopez Mateos, madé to Win Scott for a joint telephone tap operation. This
project (LIENVOY) went through about four distressing years of a shakedown.
The Mexican in contro] (LIELEGANT) was inexperienced, old, and greedy. His
son (LumNvoy-2) was a masterpiece of deceit and corruption. LIELEGAINT also
manipulated control over the principal agent of LIBIGHT mail intercept. The
first case officer was Alfonso Spera inside with Turner Smith (retired) outside
and John (ISD training officer for surveillance and head of the listening

post where thirty telephone lines would connect as well as a transcription room

staffed by Mexican army officers.) Initially the stetion tried to met every
demand made by the Mexicans. Both Smith end John had lan; ifficeulties
personal problems associated with being outside the station so thet the Mexicans
were virtually uncontrollable, spendi:g money es they pleased, squirrelling away
equipment at enormous costs, and neglecting their part of the bargain in the
production of transcripts or placing taps which we wanted, Spera was replaced

by Jack Brady who found himself in the same pincer movement of having Scott

approve a request by LIELEGANT that Brady had turned down by the son, LIENVOY-2.
Finally when the cost became exhorbitant and there was little to show for it,

the project was revamped. Smith and John returned to the U.S. end were replaced

by a TSD officer, Charles Flick, who vas put inside the listening post to maintain
Bredy wes reassigned to other duties pending a transfer.

the equipment./ Scott took over the project as case officer meeting with LIELEGANT.

He designated Ann Goodpasture to meet dailing with Flick for routine supervision

of the listening post, picking up trenseripts and tepes. Goodpasture hed no

dealinggwith the Mexicatis except when Scott was ill or cut of tow. Generally,

all decisions were made by Scott, This was about late 1961.

oie memory is a little vague about the origins of the Cuban Embassy but I

¥
think the staff first developed from a pro-Castro group celebrating on New
Years eve 1959, As I recall, it was a makeshift arrangement of volunteers
through most of 1960 end €1 with Tom Hazlitt producing voluminous reports on
their activities and recruitirg agents right and left among Cuban nationals in
Mexico City.

4. Personnel assignments. Of interest to us now is who was in Mexico during
the period prior to Oswald's visit and the subsequent investigetion by the

Warren Commission. To dete: who vas there and what they were doing I

have grouped persons tozether chronologically with areas of their assignment
as the
covering from 1950 to 1969 so thet kkxmkkex names pop up, one can tell what
thd

period they were in Mexico and their assignments “at a the time.

About mid 1962 (check date) LIFNVOY outside Mexi rept asked

for the telephone numbers of the Soviet, Cuban, and Satellite Enbassies.

With this forewarning, LIFEAT (unilateral coverage) was disconnected, However,
as I recall, the Mexicans connected 5 Cuban lines, 5 Soviet lines, 3 Czech,

2 Polish, end 1 Yugoslav line. The basehouse listening post had a live

monitor who made short summeries of ee conversetions for e daily
resume which was received each day around & a.m. (passed by Flick to Goodpasture

to get to Scott before 9 a.m.) Later (when the reel was completely recorded)

full transcripts were typed and passed to the stetion in the e way, however,
there was usually a time lag of a day or so. Those transcripts which hdd
Russian or another language besides Spanish or English went out of the listening
post the day after the transcript (of other conversations on the reel)was
typed. These reels were taken to another location where they were trenslated
and typed. In the case of the Russian translations, Boris Tarasoff usually ren
about a week behind the date of the conversation because of the volume of
Russian conversations among the embers of the Soviet Embassy. During this

iod (fall of 1963) the reels were probably being brought into the station

pe
and carried to Boris by one of the people from the Soviet Section or they may
have been carried to him by Flick but I think I brought the reel in and gave
it to Herbert Manell to take to Boris, Herbert Maneall and his wife Barbara
handled 211 of the processi:g of Soviet transcripts. My job involved screening

mself Oswald was

the photographs as soon as we lerrned thet the man calli
probably an Anericen, However, here again there was a backlag because the
photos were picked up three times a week but the ones picked up were usually
for dates a few days prettiously because the doctor processed the film on a
night time basis. Fhotogrephs were mede usually until one roll ves used but
later we got it changed to one day coverage on each roll - in other words the

fae

operstors. leared the camera each day whether there was anyofiimxaxxs a full

roll of film exposed. Instructions were to cover office hours, photograph each


oC _g_ (SEOLT

new Soviet and family, all foreigners and foreign lieenee plates, Human
error did oceur but generally the egents were conscientious. The Cuban
embessy coverege had more sophisticated equipment (a pulse camera) but it
frequently developed echanical difficulties, Bob Zambarnardi and Spathar
(I think) handled this film - pick up and delivery, Lorne MacKay screened
the film inside the stetion.

I am certain thet the Oswald call came to our attention from the
Soviet line. It was picked u; snd taken to Boris for a translation because
the caller was trying to speak Russian. Any delay was caused by waiting to
compare the photographs with the typed transcript. There were no copies of
transcripts everf made in languages other than Spanish or English because Win
Scott could read only those two languages end he »ersonally screened the

trenscripts for operational leads he vanted pursued.
