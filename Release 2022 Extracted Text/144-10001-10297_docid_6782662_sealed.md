Cambodia has just learned with astonishment and conster-
nation of the assassination of President JOHN KENNEDY, in
whom we recognized one of the noble statesmen of this era.
His tragic passing will be mournfully felt by all peace and
justice loving people.

In the name of the Royal Government and personally, may I
effer our heartfelt condolences and pray you believe that the
Cambodian people share the affliction of the American people
and the cruel sorrow which has struck the entire world.
