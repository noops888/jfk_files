IN THIS UOCUiWENT, Sleepy Foe Bemegers
pg ra ir ey AN aokr a
The purpose of this memorandum is to. recommend that

on the assassination of the late Président Kennedy.

[Shamroci]is the sensitive soviet who [contacted
the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) 1-16« id volunteered
to furnish information, He is being handi representatives

of CIA and Special Agents of our New York Office.

G,

snamroci} Sas recently reported certain details
concerning Soviet ction to the assassination of President
Ke! . ported the Soviets had the KGB (Committes
for State Security) make an extensive study of the assassin-
ation and, as o resuit of this study, the KGB concluded that
President Kennedy was killed by representatives of a group of
monopolists, characterized as the military-industrial complex
in the United States. ‘The KGB felt that President Kennedy had
tried to limit the activities of this group of monopoliats
and therefore they planned his assassination.

G)

Shamrock) further reported that the soviets felt
that President Kennedy's death was a great loss, not only for
the United States the Soviet Union, but Zor the whole
world. According to/Shamrock,] the Soviets felt that they (s)
could trust President Kent and could deal with him on a
cooperative basis. [Shamrock )further stated that the Soviets Gi
mourned President Kennedy's death, a situation which ack Cs)
considered very unique inasmuch as the person being mourned
was 2 leader of another country.

The information furnished by [Shamrock]is very simi lar©
to that previously furnished to us by Yuri Nosénko, a Soviet
defector whose bona fides has not been established. )

1,
Memorandum Branigan to Sullivan
RE: ASSASSINATION OF PRESIDENT

JOHN FITZGERALD KENNEDY
62~108060

We fee1 we should disseminate this data since
we have previously disseminated the information we received
from Yuri Nosenko regarding the assassination even though
we recognized some of the data was not subject to proof,
particularly, that occurring within the Soviet Union.
We feel that by documenting /Shamrock|as a "confidential (5)
informant, contact with whom has heéh insufficient to
establish his reliability,” we will alert other agencies
that the information has not been established as true.

We have received information from numerous other
sources that the Soviets did mourn the death of President
Kennedy and that Soviet leaders felt they could work with
President Kennedy.

ACTION:

If you approve, we will disseminate the data furnished
by the [Shamrock{informant as set out herein to the Department,C5)
to Secret Servite, to State Department and to Ceptral ~~
Intelligence Agency. ince tart . ce tees
