Service until April 1964.

The Direccion General de Inteligencia (General Directorate of
Intelligence - DGI) does not make any regular payments to revo-
lutionary groups but pays them only when they have submitted a
Plan for revolutionary action (armed struggle) ard have had it
approved in Havana. Therefore, there 1S no Standard amount paid
to any one group or disbursed in any one country per month or
year, and if no armed struggle is in progress or being planned,
no money is given out. Funds expended in Latin America on the
above basis include the following:
Guatemala : During 1963, the DGI paid out about U.S.
. $250,000. The Yon Sosa group got about
$200,000 in oneyear for its activities
(included in the $250,000).

El Salvador =: ‘In August-September 1963, when the Salvadoran
revolutionaries were preparing for armed struggle;
they received U.S.$50,000. They used the funds
for propaganda, however, and were net given any
more because they had, in DGI terms, misused

the money.

Nicaragua : During 1963 the DGI disbursed some U.S.$15,000.
In‘ addition, the professor, wtio was one of the
liaison officers in Mexico, won a suit for some
damage from a company (perhaps Pan American
Airlines) and was awarded U.S.$30,000, some of
which he turned over to the guerriilas he
represented,

The DGI gave almost nothing to Costa Rica
bocause there was no revolutionary activity.

The DGI gave Honduran revolutionaries a little

more tnan to the Costa Ricans because after
the disturbance in late 1963 there was almost
no. revolutionary action, most of the
guerrillas were in exile, and there was a
considerable problem caused by the tendéncy
of guerrilla agents trained in Cuba ‘to split
off from the Party and make their own way.

Before August 1963, the DGI had given the
Vangardia de Accion Nacional (VAN) some
U.S.$30,000. When the Departamento de
Liberacion Nacional (National Liberation
Department - LN) and the Illegal Department
of.the DCI separated ia: December 1963
(they had previously been combined in one
MA (Intelligence) Section), the VAN cpera-
tions were transferred exclusively to the
Illegal Department. Somewhat later they
were returned to the LN Department. What
sums of money were expended during the
period of exclusive Illegal Department
control are not known.

Between 1960 and 1964, the DGI put out more
than U.S.$1,000,000 for revolutionary
activities in Venezuela, in addition to an
unknown amount of arms supplied from Cuba.
Moreover, one of the best Cuban guerrilla
fighters, Major Abelardo COLOME Ibarra,
went to Venezuela in 1962 and was still the
director of operations in 1964. If COLOME
returned to Cuba after April 1964, when he
was known to be there, he was probably only,
back temporarily to collect more money.
