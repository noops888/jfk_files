SOURCE:

A former Cuban IS officer who served with the Cuban Intelligence

Service until April 1964.

The Dirección General de Inteligencia (General Directoräte of

Intelligence - DGI) does not make any regular payments to revo-

lutionary groups but pays them only when ther have sabritted a

plan for revolutionary action (armed struggle) ard. rave had it

approved in Havana.

therefore, there is no standard amount pala

to any one group or disbursed in any one country per month or

year, and if no armed struggle is In progress or being planned,

no money is given out.

Funds expended in Latin America on the

above basis include the following:

Guatemala

During 1963, the DGI paid out about U.s.

$250,000.

The Yon Sosa group got about

$200,000 in one year

its activities

(Included in the $250,000).

El Salvador

Nicaragua

In August-September 1963,

when the Salvadoran

revolutionaries

were preparing for armed struggle,

they received U.S. $50,000.

They used the funds

for propaganda, however, and were not given

more because they had, in DGI terms, misused

the money.

During 1963 the DGI distursed some U.S. $15,000.

In' addition, the professor,

liaison officers in Mexico,

won a suit for some

damage from a company (perhaps Pan American

Airlines) and was awarded U.S. $30,000, some of

which he turned over to the guerrillas he

rapresented.

Costa Rica.

Honduras

Panama

Venezuela

The DGI gave almost nothing to Costa Rica

bicause there was no revolutionary activity.

: The DGI gave Honduran revolutionaries a little

more than to the Costa Ricans because after

the disturbance in late 1963 there was almost

no. revolutionary action, most of the

guerrillas were in exile, and there was a

considerable problem caused by the tendency

agents trained in Cuba 'to split

from the Party and make their own way.

Before August 1963, the GI had given the

Vangardia de Accion Nacional (VAN) some

U.s.$30,000.

When the Departamento de

Liberacion Nacional (National Liberation

Department - LN) and the Illegal Department

of. the DCI separated 1a: December 1963

They had previously been combined in one

MA (Irtelligence)

section), the VAn cpera-

Lions were transferred exclusively to the

Illegal Department.

Somewhat later they

were returned to the LN Department.

sums of money were expended during

period of exclusive Illegal Department

control are not known.

Jetween 1960 and 1964,

the dGI put out more

chan U.S. $1,000,000 for revolutionary

in Venezuela, in addition to an

unknown amount of arms

supplied from Cuba.

Moreover, one of the best Cuban guerrilla

fighters, Major Abelardo COLOME Ibarra,

went to Venezuela in 1962 and was still the

director of operations in 1964.

If COLOME

returned to Cuba after April 1964, when he

was known to be there,

he was probably only

temporarily to collect more money.
