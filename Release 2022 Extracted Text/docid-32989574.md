BLACK PANTHER PARTY

FORMERLY KNOWN AS THE BLACK PANTHER PARTY FOR SELF-DEFENSE

CHARACTERIZATION OF SUBVERSIVE ORGANIZATION

EXTREMIST MATTER - BLACK PANTHER PARTY

The Black Panther Party (BPP), organized in December,

1966, at Oakland, California, by Huey P. Newton and Bobby George

Seale, has the publicly-stated purpose of organizing black

people to take control of the life, politics and destiny of

the black community. The Party, operating the Black Panther

Intercommunal News Service, publishes a newspaper called

"The Black Panther," which at one time openly advocated the

use of guns and guerrilla tactics in a revolutionary program

to end the oppression of the black people but since early

1971 has spoken for a survival program pending revolution.

BPP national headquarters, aka Black Panther Intercom-

munal Headquarters, is located in Oakland, California.

While openly advocating direct overthrow of the

U. S. Government by force and violence until 1971, leaders

have since avoided extreme statements in favor of

calling

for action within the established order. Newton, in an

interview appearing in the May, 1973, issue of "Playboy"

magazine, stated the Panthers'

chief

ambition is to change

the American Government by any means necessary but that

ultimately such change will be through armed violence.

Despite its claimed dedication to community service,

indicators of the BPP's continued attraction to violence persist.

Since July, 1974, Newton and other BPP members have been arrested

in Oakland, California, for threatening police officers,

murder of a 17-year-old female and the pistol whipping of

Newton's tailor. Newton failed to appear on these charges and

is now a local fugitive. Additionally, one died and three

were wounded as a result of a shooting at a BPP-sponsored

dance in Oakland, California, in October, 1974.

SECRET ARMY ORGANIZATION

The Secret Army Organization (SAO) was clandestinely

formed during the Fall of 1971 in Arizona. Membership to date

has been small and it appears to have the same basic terats as.

the Minutemen. In fact, several of those involved in SAO

were formerly active in the Minutemen. The mail drop for

this organization reportedly is in care of an individual in

Ramona, California, who has been involved in Minutemen and

white-hate activities in the past.

This ultraconservative paramilitary organization

was recently involved in extremist activities in San Diego,

California.

Members of this group reportedly made threatening

telephone calls to a local college professor who is active

in a group which plans to organize demonstrations at the

forthcoming Republican National Convention, Following these

telephone calls, a member of SAO fired shots from an auto-

mobile into the professor's home, wounding a guest.

An attempt was made by this individual

He was seen to depart through

the hole in the fence, which he then temporarily repaized.

He was not successiul in gaining access to the building nor

in obtaining any weapons. No arres's were made, hoping that

accomplices would also be involved.

Inspector Jonnson advised on March 3 and Mare. 10,

1969 that the police have a

"monitoring device" at the build-

ing, which will alert them at the police headquarters to any

unusual noises after working hours, inasmuch as they have

Re: Black Panther Party

The panelists were introduced by the moderator

• Lonnie Peeks with the following titles:

Luke Tripp - Deputy Minister of Information

Leonard Brown - Deputy Minister of Education

Victor Stewart - Deputy Chairman

Marian Kramer - No title

Luke Tripp stated that the Black Panther Party is

not

a party that adheres to violence but is geared towards

political education for the black people. Iripp stated that

the Black Panther Party is running Eldridge Cleaver, leader

of the BPP in San Francisco,

California, for the presidency

of the United States in Michigan. Cleaver is being sponsored

by the New Politics Party.

Tripp stated that the BPP is not

interested in seeking or getting votes, rather it is concerned

with presenting its program for revolution to the American

people.

Tripp stated that social turmoil as manifested by

George Wallace, youth rebellions and riots in the streets,

can be blamed on power being in the hands of the establishment

and

not in the hands of the people where it belongs.

Tripp

stated that the black economic, political and social condition

as opposed to the condition of the whites

is far below normal.

The system has as its basis a cast system based on race.

is the relationship of the oppressor and the oppressed, superior

to the inferior.

Tripp stated that socially the black man

is unable to control his destiny. School, police and welfare

are all in the hands of the white people and the black people

grasp for what is left.

Tripp further stated the BPP has a ten point program

that is geared towards elevating the black people out of the

slums. He further stated that the BPP in the Detroit area is

in the process of organizing a party and at this point has no

definite meeting place or date.

However, any persons interested

in assisting the organization of the BPP

in the Detroit area

may do so by contacting Luke Tripp or Leonard Brown.

Re: Black Panther Party

Leonard Brown mentioned the fact that the white

policemen must realize that the black people are not

afraid of them and will defend themselves in any criticai

situation. Brown mentioned the fact that a good example of

the white police officer is the incident that occurred in

New York City where 200 white off-duty policemen attacked

innocent members of the EPP.

Brown further stated that the

black political leaders in the country are nothing but

"phonies" and "Uncle Toms".

He further stated it is time

for the white power structure to realize that it is impossible

to dictate to the black people as they have been doing for

years and that the black people only want a chance to govern

their community as they see fit.

Victor Stewart stated that the BPP in its useful

state is not an "underground party" but an "above the ground

party"

Stewart stated that the only way the black people can

excel or exist in thisworld controlled by the white man is to

take what he wants.

Stewart stated that this does not mean

asking or getting on your knees begging the white power

structure.

he lurther stated that the key to the black man's

destiny is through black political education classes in

which he will be cognizant of the political structure in this

country. Stewart fuither stated that the BPP's motto is

"All power to the people; Black power to black

people".

Marian Kramer, Negro, female, stated that the black

female must awaken and play a vital role in organizing the

BPP .

She stated for years the black female has been neglected

from the political system

in our country.

Sources in the Detroit area who are familiar with

the black nationalist movement, stated that they. have no

information at this time that a BPP is organized in the

Detroit area and conducts regular scheduled meetings.

These

sources further advised that during other black militant

organizational meetings the name Black Panther Party has

come

up; however, no significant meaning as to actually being

established

in the Detroit area is known.

BLACK PANTHER PARTY, alsO

known as Black Panther Party

for Self Defense

A source advised that the Black Panther Party for

Self Defense (BPPSD) was formed by HUEY PERCY NEWTON, Minister

of Defense, and BOBBY GEORGE SEALE, Chairman, in December,

1966, as a

militant black nationalist political organization

to combat "police brutality", to unite militant black youth,

and to determine the destiny of black communities.

The

political philosophy was taken from writings of Chairman MÃO

Tse-tung of Communist China and black militant writers.

In March, 1968, the name of the organization was

changed to Black

Panther Party (BPP).

The official BPP publication, "The Black Panther

Party - Black Conmunity News Service"

states that the BPP

advocates use of guns and guerrilla tactics in their violent

revolutionary program to end oppression of black people.

On February 17, 1968, ELDRIDGE CLEAVER, Minister of

Information, announced merger of the BPP and Student Non-violent

Coordinating Conmittee (SNCC) and bestowed title of Minister of

Justice, BPP, upon II. RAP BROWIN, Chairman Of SNCC.

SNCC is a militant Negro organization

which preaches black supremacy.

revolutionary vanguard. It advocates that to be successful it

is necessary to develop a revolutionary ideology and revolutionary

program.

According to SNCC, the year 195% marked a historic

milestone in the struggle for the liberation of black people

in the United States and the year that revolutionaries

throughout

the world began to understand more fully the impact of the

black novement.

SNCC declared that "liberation will come only

when there is final destruction pi this mad octupus--the capitalis-

tic system of the United States with all its life-sucking

tentacles of exploitation and racism thai choke the people of

Africa, Asia, and Latin America.

The realities of black life,

together with the recognition instilled in SNCC workers forced

its members to further popularize the legitimacy. of self-

defense and

rebellious when oppression became too great."

•History of

ee Secret Army Organization

CONFIDENTIXL

One carly morning in February, 1970, a group of six Minutemen leaders from

four states met secretly in Northern Arizona to discuss the crisis that the arrest and

imprisonment of two top Minutemen leaders and the assassination of a third had

brought on the organization. Although some of these men had mot before in their roles

as Minutemen group leaders, others were meeting for the first time.

After much discussion, two principal points were agreed upon. First, that the

Minutemen as a national coordination organization of militant right-wing groups had

effectively been destroyed by the pro-communist elements inside the Justice Depart-

ment. While individual units still existed throughout the country, few had the financial

support or leadership to be really effective. Second, that the need for such a coordi-

nating organization wasgreater than ever in view of the increased revolutionary activity

by communists in the United States.

With these two points

in mind, suggestions were put forward on a course of

action to be followed. After a meeting that lasted all that day and far into the next

merge their individual units together and form a new organization under the command

of one leader elected from among themselves, with the other five to be members of a

General Staff that would advise and assist the new leader.

While retaining the basic programs and policies of the Minutemen, it was

decided that not only should this new organization have a different name, but also a

completely new chain of command and organizational structure. If the new organiza-

tion was going to survive the attacks that befell the old one, a whole new approach

would be needed. Never again could the arrestor death of a few leaders be allowed to

cripple the entire organization.

For this reason it was decided that only a highly disciplined military type

orgainization with a definite chain of command would have any chance of success. This

then, was the beginning of the Secret Army Organization. Beginning with an original

force of hard core patriots that numbered fewer than two hundred, the Secret Army

Organization began thejob of picking up the pieces and continuing to fight for national

and individual freedom. Using this cadre of dedicated personnel as a nucleus, the

S. A. O. has been recruiting and training new members in the skills they will need as

the Ireedom fighters of tomorrow.

The leaders of the S. A. O. have no idea of fighting a last ditch stand. We have

no desire lo commit suicide ourselves, or to let our members do so. We have a

strategy which we believe will ultimately lead to victory. Only onc thing is essential.

We must start preparing and training NOW? We of the S. A. O. believe that our couniry

is worthy of any sacrifice. If you fecl the same way, we invite you to join us.

spective Members Of The

SECRET ARMY ORGANIZATION

CONFIDENTIAL

The Secret Army Organization is the most active, most completely dedicated and

most selective in its membership of all the many patriotic organizations in America.

We are willing to make any sacrifice for pur country and we fully expect that some of

us will have to make the ultimate sacrifice iefore victory is achieved. Our very lives

depend on each other. There is no place in this organization for bunglers, playboys or

lukewarm conservatives. It you join the Secret Army Organization, there might easily

come a time that your life would depend on how competently some other member had

learned his job.

Unless you are especially well informed on the domestic and world political

situation, it is probable that you have a lot to learn about the present threat our nation

faces. Unless you have had many years experience in actual underground warfare,

there is undoubtedly a lot you can learn from the experts in our organization who have

developed and supervised our training program.

OUR NATION IS IN IMMEDIATE DANGER

It is possible that within a very few years, perhaps even within months, our

nation could be conquered and. enslaved by the communists. To prevent this we must

know as much as possible about our enemies. Unless we know who they are and what

they are doing we will not succeed in our efforts to maintain a free America.

THE RESISTANCE MOVEMENT

In driving an invader from your land the resistance involved goes through three

stages of development.

1) The Underground Network

2) Active Guerrilla Warfare

3) Open or Conventional Warfare

The conventional warfare stage uses everything in the way of weapons that the

enemy does but must also have active guerrillas and underground agents working against

the enemy, too. In the present state of military tactics conventional warfare cannot

succeed unless these, other two ingredients are used simultaneously.

The first step is to form an underground network. An active guerrillasystem

must have the support of an underground network of approximately three times its own

size. This underground must supply the active guerrilla fighter with supplies, con-

cealment, information, ete. Anunderground network starts with departments of

intelligence, security and propaganda in that order.

Sabotage, espionage, subversion,

infiltration, escape and evasion, training,

clandestine fabrication of supplies, counterfeiting chemy documents, recruiting, com-

munications and propaganda are other phases of underground activity. Each member

of the Secret Army Organization, lo be effective, must have a working knowledge of

all these tactics as well as the military tactics more commonly associated with guerril-

la activities.

ASSIGNMENT TO UNITS

CONF IUANTIAL

Many people that inquire about membership in the Secret Army Organization

seem to have an idea that they will be immediately accepted into an active unit.

Look at it this way. Suppose you had spent a year of more carefully rccruiting and

training until you had a hard hitting team were every individual was reliable, dodi-

cated,, and had confidence in his fellow unit members. Wouldn'I it make you mad to

have the national

or regional organization assign some rank amateur to your unit

that you you knew little or nothing about?

Before any new memher is assignedto an active unit or to an important under-

ground project, he mastundergo a peried of training. During this training he will be

directed through the mails by an experienced member and some of his activities may

be observed by other members

without his knowiedge. Oaly when a new member

proves himself to be conscientious, trustworthy, self-disciplined and able to operate

effectively alone will he be accepted as a "secure member" and invited to participate

with other unit members in a teamwork operation.

• EXPENSES •

Unfortunately, most good things don't come cheap. Although we make every

effort to keep down the expense of membership in the Secret Army Organization, you

must expect to pay your own way.

Dues to the Secret Army Organization are $3. 00 per month. This money is

absolutely necessary for use to maintain our central files and headquarters, for

postage and printing, to finance our extensive intelligence network, and to maintain

training areas.

Each member will have other expenses depending on the type of activity he is

engaged in. Every member will be expected to buy his own gun, am nunition and

other basic combat equipment. During training the new member may be expected to

buy certain books or subscribe to certain magazines that his work requires. During

this time the new member will also be supplied with reading material on the strategy

and tactics of guerrilla warfare. This home work will make it possible for him to

fit in quickly to an active unit and participate effectively in actual maneuvers,

marksmanship training, etc.

Following this preliminary training a memher may be either assigned to an

existing unit, assisted in organizing his own unit if he has shown sufficient leadership

qualities or become part of an underground network.

Upon your acceptance into the Secret Army Organization you will be given a

definite series oi projects described inwriting so you will know exactly what will be

expected of you.

We hope that you can succeed in this effort because your country desperately

needs patriots at this time.

"National Socialist" movement based on

the German Nazi Party

headed by Adolf Hitler. He added that Rockwell is the dominant

force and personality in this party; that he is espousing a "line":!

of hatred against the Jews and Negroes; and that he is seeking,

through speeches, distribution of literature and picketing, to

establish a conesive and dominant political party in the united

States and in foreign countries.

According to the "Stormtrooper's Manual"

, an official

publication of the ANi, the phases of ANP struggle for power are

namely, first "to make ourselves known to the masses":

"organizing the people who have been converted to

our propaganda"; and fourth,

"the attainment of power through the

ADMINISTRATIVE

As set forth in the initial New York teletype,

interview of UN employees was prohibited by the Secretary-

Ceneral's office until 8/20/74. Since that date, however,

the ¡Legal Department of the Secretary-General's office

has advised the NYO that it will authorize the interview

and appearance for testimony of all UN employees necessary

to the successful prosecution of the captioned matter.

All interviews, however, must be held outside the UN

premises.

The suspect in this matter, MICHAEL HALSEY BROWN,

FBI #313 717 E, previously known to the Los Angeles and

Alexandria Offices as a former member of the American

Nazi Party in 1966 through 1967 and a one-time bodyguard

Of GEORGE LINCOLN ROCKWELL, founder of that organization.

LoS Angeles files indicate

that in 1969 BROWN was identified

as a member of the Iron Cross

Motorcycle Club, a pro-Nazi

motorcycle

group in Glendale, California.

The Louisvillé Office has obtained, by subpoena;

the suspect's toll call records for the period covering the

captioned incident. Initial investigation tends to support

theory that after

departure from Berea, Kentucky, BROWN

contacted pro-Nazi associates in Falls

Church, Virginia,

Hicksville, Ny, and the NYC area during the period

of the captioned incident.

Initial opinion of AUSA confirmed by separate

communication.

cussed the possibility of using dynamite on the

by LARRY SCHITY STAUFORD and WILLIAM JUNIOR (JAY)

STAFFORD from the fall of 1973 until approximately

August 1: 1971. Pring this visit by BRow in the

fall of 1973, BROWN involved LARRY STATORD and his

brother JAY in a conversation which was interpreted

by LARRY STAFFORD as designed to produce LARRY's

and JAY's feelings or attitudes concerning the

possibility of the STATIORD brothers' involvement in

burglary or

unauthorized lock picking activites.

LARRY STAINORD advised that neither he nor his

brother jAy gave the impression that they rould be

interested in those type'of activities and BROWN

subseguently left the STATFORD Lock Shop aud was

not heard of nor seen again until July 22, 1974.

On July 22, 1971, BROWN again appeared

closed to the

selves in placing explosives in

the United Nations

be causin the starrono brothers' Involvencht being that

them.

Ireeway.

BROWN discussed the use of ropes to rappel

walls and the possibility of an escape method wherein

the irceray would be reached,

and then a passing motorist

would be flagged down. Once

the passing notcrist stopped,

a pistol vould be shoved in his lace and he could be

forced to take an individual or several individuals

anywhere they wanted to go.

Nations building and that his orders or contract came

Irom a Ictired Colonel or General in the Army. BROWN •

talked about having $250 expense money which would be

used for the purchase of explosives and travel to and

from New York State.

little money was needed inasmuch as he had associates

or friends in route to New York, who would provide

food and lodging.

LARRY STATFORD advised that BROWN continued

to use the expression "performance" and advised that

he would travel to lew York and complete this contract

assignuent whether or not LARRY and his brother partici

that his daughter

Irene had been arrested approximately three months ago in Pueblo,

Colorado, on a charge of robbing a filling station. He reported

his daughter had béen placed in the custody of her parents until

such time as there is an additional hearing in the mayter.

:.

While irene was in the rueblo County Jail she started

receiving letters

from Brown, a person whom she has never

personally met.

File pointed out Irene's picture had appeared

in newspapers after her arrest, and it is possible Brown may

have gotten her name and

address fron a newspaper article.

File made available a copy of a letter of November 9,

1964, addressed to his daughter. He advised she is not aware

of the fact he had made such a copy. The letter is quoted as

1011ows:

"Nov. 9, 1964

"Dear Irene,

"Looks like my boy Barry sure took a shellacking, doesn't

RE: MICHAEL HALSEY BROWN

On January 3, 1965, Mrs. R. S. Lowrey, 1920 Awapuhi

Street, Honolulu, advised as follows:

Mrs. S. I. Snodgrass,

a roman in her early 60's, has

resided next door at 1926 Awapuhi for at least 12 years.

Mrs.

Lowrey stated she has no idea of Mrs. Snodgrass' background and

does not know if she is a divorcee or widow.

She related that

Mrs. Snodgrass lives a quiet life, has a substantial home, and

enjoys a good reputation in the community. She related that

Mrs. Snodgrass has a divorced daughter,

Mrs. Brown, who is a

local school teacher. Mrs. Brown formerly lived on Cahu Avenue

and her ino children, Mike and Leilani, have occasionally

stayed with the grandmother.

Mrs. Lowrey stated she believes

Leilani Brown is presently in school in England. Mike Brown,

about 20 years of age, has recently returned to Honolulu to

live with his grandinother. He has been in one of the branches

of the armed services for some three years and is now atiending

the University of Hawaii. •Mrs. Lowrey stated Mrs. Snodgrass had

expressed

relief that her grandson had enrolled at the university,

explaining that when he had graduated from high school he had

not vanted to go on with his, schooling.

On January 13, 1965, HN T-1 advised as follows:

DI. Dorothy Brown has taught in the English Department

of the University of Hawaii at Honolulu for at least 13 years.

She is presently Assistant Professor at the university and

resides in the Kalia Apartments.

Mrs. Brown is a divorcee and

has

two children, Mike, aged 22, and Leilani, about 17.

During the early 1950's Dorothy Brown resided on

campus with her two childen. Mike was a large boy for his

age and his mother found him a difficult problem as far as

discipline was concerned.

When he was some 14 years of

he was caught burglarizing the ROTC Armory on the campus.

following year he was sent to Arkansas to live with his maternal

grandfather and finish high school there. Mrs. Brown has

related in the past that Mike is fond of guns and has been a

disciplinary problem and also experienced some trouble in the

Army.

Mike returned to Honolulu before the fall semester of

1964 and enrolled at the University of Hawaii as a freshman

intending to major in political science. In late October 1954

the Associated Students of the University of Hawaii sponsored

a political symposium featuring speakers of diverse political

views including George Lincoln Rockwell, head of the American

Mrs. Brown, after the political symposium, had stated

that many of the immature students at the university had been

very impregsed with Rochwell's speech.

reported

that university files reveal wike f. Brown, born

September 11, 1942, Montgomery, Alabama, is presently enrolled

at the university as a freshman.

University records indicate

he was graduated from Fountain Lake High School, Hot Springs,

Arkansas.

A check of the records of the Honolulu Police

Depariment under File Numbers G83259, G82369 and G82301, reflected

that Michael taisey brown, born september 11, l94e, Montgomery,

Alabama, was arrested on April 25, 1957, 101

burglary and

released that date to Juvenile Crime Prevention.

Those files

reflect Brown, then a resident of 2543B Rock Road, was a 14-year-

01d

• juvenile attending St. Louis High School.

He had been

arrested along with Fobert Vincent Fletcher of 1829 Keller

1957, forced entry had been made into the university snack bar.

Cones, icecrean, coin wrappers, and possibly coins were taken.

On the same date

the ROTC Armory and Supply Foom were entered

through a forced entry. Apparently nothing was taken from the

Supply Room but two .22 rifles valued at $60 were taken from

the Armory.

The rifles were found beiore police were notified -

one on the rifle range and one in the ROTC garage:

On

April 20 - 2h, 1957, the ROTC Supply Room was again entered.

Fletcher and. Brown, when questioned by the police, adnitted

the above burglaries and the fact they had taken some $6.95

in cash, $5 in school supplies and $10 worth of RCTC equipment.

They also acmitted entering a campus service station by taking

screws off door hinges on April 14, 195%, and taking some $5 in

tools.

Police File under 'Number K40001 notes a notice of

APPENDIX

RE: MICHAEL HALSEY BROWN

AMERICAN NAZI FARTY OF THE WORLD UNION

CS RUS ANIMRISE NATIONAL SOCLANIDIN,

ALSO KNOWN AS THE GEORGE LINCOLN ROCKWELL PARTY

as Commander, American

Nazi Party of the World Union of Free Enterprise National

Socialists (ANP - WUTENS), Arlington, Virginia.

The April 4, 1993 issue of "The Richmond News Leader,"

a kichmond, Virginia dazly newspaper, reported that George

Lincoln Rockwell had, on the previcus day, again applied for

the American Nazi farty to be chartered in the State of

Virginia, but this request was turned down by the Virginia

State Corporation Commission. This action was taken pursuant

to an act of the 1SS2 Virginia Assembly which prohibits use of sT

"Nazi" or "National socialism" in a Virginia charter: This

article further pointed out that Rockwell's party is presently

chartered in the piate of Virginia as the George Lincoln.

Rockwell Party.

On August 14, 1964, a source advised that the ANP -

HUFENS was organized by

• George Lincoln Rockwell at his

residence in Arlingion, Virginia,

on February 26, 1959, as an

international "National Socialist" movement based on the German

Nazi Party headed by Adolf Hitler.

He added that Rockwell is

the doninant force and personality in this party;

that: he is

espousing a "line" of hatred against the Jews and Negroes;.

and that he is seeking, through speeches, distribution of

literature and picketing, to establish a

cohesive and dominant

political party in the United States and in foreign countries.

According to the "Stormtrooper's Manual," an official

publication of the AND,

the phases of Ant struggle for power

are

touriold, namely, first "to make ourselves known to the

masses;" second "the

truth about the Party;" third "organizing the people who have

been converted to our propaganda; "

and fourth "the attainment

of power through the votes of the newly-won masses."

On February 17, 1964, Karl Rogers Allen, Jr., former

Deputy National Commander of the ANP, advised that George

Lincoln Rockwell believes he has completed the first two phases

in his struggle for power and is now well into the third phase.

Allen said, however, in his opinion, icckwell has only completed

phase one.

The article further quoted

MONGO as saying,

"Much of our image in the past was

created by an unfriendly press.

Our goal continues

to be survival of the people.

The people themselves

will determine the approaches to be

used in the meantime.

The Black Panther Party makes itself available for

guidance and assistance.

Our survival services are

essential to the daily existence of the people."

2. Communication with BPP National Headquarters

DE T-1 advised on April 27, 1973 that LONNIE

DARDEN, Detroit BPP Minister of

Information, received a

telephone call in late April, 1973, from BOBBY SEALE in

California.

SEALE reportedly told

DARDEN that the Detroit

BPP Chapter has the least number of actively involved

members of all BPP Chapters throughout the country.

SEALE also complained that the Detroit Chapter is operating

only two survival programs (the Free Breakfast Program and

the Free Busing to Prison Program) and warned DARDEN that

the Detroit Chapter will have to take steps to initiate a

substantial number of survival programs to serve the

Detroit Black community as it deserves to be served.

II. MEMBERSHIP

A. Requirements for Membership

The BPP is constantly attempting to recruit

community workers from the black community to hep in

the operation of the BPP programs.

Outsiders, however,

are not trusted by established Party members and community

workers are not allowed inside the Party Office or pad.

They are required to sell BPP newspapers and to perform

various other duties "in the field".

There are also approximately six community workers

who are young high school age blacks who are interested in

the BPP and help sell BPP newspapers

and solicit donations

to the Party. They hold no official Party status and their

interest in the Party's work vacillates and their work is

irregular and inconsistent.

DE T-2

April 4, 1973

The fact that four Detroit Party members are

presently in California, the fact that so many Detroit

Party members work for the Party on a very limited basis

and the wavering interest of the community workers has

severely hurt the BPP's success in the last six months

in Detroit.

An article which appeared in the February 17,

1973, edition of the "Michigan Chronicle" entitled

"Panthers Appeal for Support of Prison Busing Program"

quoted ROLLIN REID, a BPP member as saying "The Community

should do more to

support the program.

Basically we

cannot get more community support because of the old

BPP image of leather coats. and

guns. People think we

are thugs."

An article which appeared in the February 27,

1973, edition of the "Detroit News"

, a daily Detroit

newspaper, entitled "Panthers Appeal for Bus funds"

quoted LONNIE DARDEN, BPP leader as saying that what

the Panthers are seeking is "a good used vehicle"

which would cost them

around $2, 500.00.

DARDEN stated

that commercial rental costs are too high and that the

BPP funds would not allow the Party to purchase

' a used

bus even if one were to be found.

DARDEN stated that

the Party funds at the present time for the purchase

of a usedbus stand at zero.

On December 20, 1972, LONNIE DARDEN, BPP-NF

leader at Detroit, was interviewed under suitable pretext

by a Special Agent of the FBI and DARDEN made the following

statement regarding ELDRIDGE CLEAVER:

"Eldridge Cleaver will not be allowed back

in the BPP. We're (BPP-NF) not saying that

there is a peaceful co-existence that will

exist between the BPP and Eldridge Cleaver.

We're saying that the court systems are

responsible for the execution of poor and

oppressed people

and we in turn are exposing

the court system

in this

particular racist

attitude against poor and oppressed people

and not trying to build a peaceful co-existence

with a particular element that had defected

from the Party."

VII. BPP FUNDS

The following is a summary of the financial

Free Pressin a December 21, 1972 edition of the "Detroit

, a Detroit daily newspaper, an article appeared

entitled "Black Panthers Charge Police with Harassment".

LONNIE DARDEN, BPP leader, charged the Detroit Police

Department with harassing Panthers while they were selling

the Party

newspaper at the corner of State and Woodward

in Detroit. DARDEN charged that Party members had been

ticketed more than 25 times in the past year for loitering

and interfering with pedestrian traffic.

DARDEN went on

to state that members of the Party are being harassed

because they are black. DARDEN stated that the police

are attempting to stop

• the selling of

the Party newspaper

because the BPP is involved in

various programs to

serve the people of the community.

DE T-1 advised on April 27, 1973, that the BPP's

lease on 2228 Bewick expires on September 15, 1973, and

that the Panthers must vacate the premises on or before

that date.

E. Philosophy of the BPP

In explaining the new Panther image, GERALD

CRAWFORD stated, "For too long the Parcher Party has found

itself in the role of defender, rather than educator of

the community.

We feel the Party should be a vehicle to

take the community to liberation and not the force which

consistently finds itself in conflict with the Police.

We are now moving toward the role of humanitarians, and

our goal is humanization of all mankind.

We would like

to remove all racial and class barriers, Our struggle is

more a class struggle - rather than à racial one, and

our role is to educate the community

• to that fact.

We

are not trying to teach individuals what to think, but

instead, we are trying to teach them to think lor

themselves and objectively analyze the situation we tino

ourselves in.

"Ironically, those people who can best perform

this service turn their backs on the conmunity and help

those forces which are oppressing all of us.

College

students today do not bring their talents back to the

community, but help to builä the system which they have

suffered under.

In order for us to succassfully perform

our duty, we need the support of the conmunity. The

Panthers are a part of the community and need

its entire

support. Without this support, we will be unaule to

continue our fight against oppression.

"For the past ten years, the Black Panther Party

has found itself on the covers of

national magazines and

in newspapers.

Reporters have described Panther members

as Communists and revolutionaries:

But fox

several reasons

this description is not applicable to today's

Black Panther

Party. In the past two years, the Panther

Party has

undergone drastic changes.

Black: Panther menhers have tried

to drop the role of querilla lighters and aie nutting every

effort into being known as educators and humanitarians.

"The Party's Detroit Chapter is trying

extremely

hard to change its image fron community bodyguaid to community

servant."

A rovolutionist may feed friendship or attachment only for those

who have proven thenselves by their actions to be revolutionists like

by these racist pigs. Ind

cople of this community are no going to stand still

and see another little Danny Smith get shot down.

Some of the brothers and sisters who are members of the. N.C.C.F. were victims

of pig harrassment. These brotbers and sisters were relating to the people in

the connunity of Highland Park. They were beaten and kidnapped off the streets

of babylon. This is the plot and plan of the facists to try to exterminate the

Black Panther Party. The pig's are openly making statements on radio and I.V.

to try and destroy the Party. But the Black Panther Party is strong. It is strong

because it's the peoples party. After the statement was made by Pig layor Black-

well, J. Hog-Head Hoover made a statement about the Black Panther Party being the

nost dangerous and violent organization in the country. This pig knows that the

Black Panther Party is relating the real deal' about this foul system. How these.

pig forces are carrying out the orders of fascism against the American People in

general and Black People in particular. J.. Hog Head Hoover knows he is a pig

and a pig is: a pig'is a pig. Right On!!

The lying politicians runs this cold game on the people that the U.s. Govern-

ment is existing for the benefit of the people. The real deal is that the U.s.

Government is the largest facist iorce there is. And the Black Panther Party is

hip to the game these low lifed pigs

are trying to run down. So there is no way

out for these pigs.

fired upon, arrested, and incarceratca by the Dotroit Police Department, and heid

for

MALIK AND WILLIAM MCCLURE AND TOMMI WARD WERE HELPING IO PAINT TRE HONE

OF MRS. EARLENE MCCLURE (MOTHER OF MALIK AND WILLIAN). WHEN THEY RAN OUT OF

PAINT MALIK AND WILLIAM VOLUNTEERED TO GET MORE. THEY WERE THREE DOORS FROM

2RS HOUSE WEEN 50 STORMTROOPERS STOPPED THEM AND DEMANDED A CAR REGISTRATION.

WHERI THIS WAS PRODUCED THEY COMPLAINED THAT IT WAS UNCLEAR AND SAID THAT THE

ESCHERS WERE LYING. THIS WAS ENOUGH FOR THEM TO HAND CUFF THE BROTHERS. *

THE TWO BROTHERS TRYED IO CLARIFY THE ISSUE, AND WERE HIT IN THE HAD

WITH GUNS AND CLUBS. BY THIS TIME MRS. NCCLURE AND TONY HAD COME CUT OF THE

HOUSE. WHEN TOY CAME OUT ON THE PORCH, THE RACIST DOGS TURNED ON HIM. MRS.

MCCLURE WAS ATTACKED WHEN SHE WENT OVER TO FIND OUT WHAT HAS HAPPENING TO

FER SONS.

here. A lot of us kill be dead soon--very soon. The chief of Pigs in this city

Murpby has conspired with the bead of the F.B.I., J. Edgar Hoover (Pig) to atrack

and destroy the members of the N.C.C.F. here. At this very moment the l0th precinct

=. is and has been for two wecks stock piling weapons, and when I say weapons, I mean

tails and half tracks and.all the conventional weapons of modern warfare to attack

what they call the "Panther Complex"--not office but complex. Tey (the pigs) have

been trying hard to create an incident. First the news media cones out with a lie

that we have over 200 xeapons and over 100,000 rounds of ammunition at this öffice

, alone. Inis statement was made à week after a minor rebellion went down in an arca

noin as Highland Park where the Mayor stated after occupying the community, shoot-

ing and beating Black people-"I don't know why the Black Panthers want to pick on

oy little city." When in actuality it was the people responding to the racist mur

•ders of acople at the Kozy Korner Bar. The brother was shot after an argument ensued

I because the brother didn't have the money for a drink. the brother was black--the

surderer was white--the brother was unarmed. Ine people's response was; the bar was

irrediately burnt doin and niggas hit the streets. The Panthers were the scapegoat.

¡ then we veut into the area to educate the people to the pigs tactica ve vére immed-

iately

arrested.

About for days ago the people around the office here on Indiandale bung DoG- I

ters and when the pigs attempted to tear them doin they vere run away. Then the people

sot really uptight and began saying that this is their community, and they have

'I right to do what they want to do. So they changed the street from Indiandale & 14th

to Panther, Ave. and free Red. They sang revolutionary songs and rapped about how they.

kould like things to be for everybody. The following norning a pig vas shot at, try-:

ing to sneak up and pull dorn the sign. The N.C.C.F. ras blaned inmediately, a few

•-

hours later a channel 50 nevs car was fired on in the sane neighborhood, again the .

M.C.C.F. has blamed - immediately the area was surrounded by pigs of the 10th pre-

cinct. They did this without permission fron Pig Chief Hurphy. They were about to

attack when orders can, and they were instructed not to make a nove becouse

they were

Iot equipped to handle the situation. That they were in rcality about to be barbequed

because it just so happens that the people here relate to the Black Panther Party

sod, it would be impossible to nove or us without noving on the whole Vest Side. That's

way: the 10th Precinct right now has tanks and half tracks and 50 cal. machine guss--.

I to kill niggas. That's why today August 2nd, pigs have been going door to door tell..

it people where to lay in' their house when the attack comes. They also stated that..

if they were to come out on the strect that they would be killed:

So this is no joke, this is far in the truest sense of the word. 'This is the

Lighest form of politica. He want frcedom--they want blood. I say they can have mine,

In organizing self-decence groups at

this siage oi the suruggie the most

inportan: consideration

is ricother or not

the person to be in incorporated into the

group understands lully. that what he or

she is doing is the right thing to do. At

this stage of the struggie it any monters

of a sell-aciense group are weak isinded

any self-cozense groun is to be armea

PART 11

Due to the brainvashing done by TV,

movies, comics ect, there are a lot of

incorrect iceas about lircaras that must

be cleared up. The first thing to under-

stand is, there is no piece (gun) that

covers any and all situations. Although

they shot gigs on Ty ard in the movies

The pigs also lise slugs, l giant lec

revolver, in reality

this is not .

a very practical and shouldn't even be att-

esipted wiless you are an expert's expert.

Fron seeing to much Hyatt Fary and lat

Dillon, too mary people think that if they

•I have a hand gun either pistol or revolver

that they are ready for anything. All

, that is necessary to give you a differ

ent perspectiva is to examine the arma-

ment of the pigs that occupy our Black.

Cormunities anywhere in Babylon. When

you do that you will discover that most

Jig cars have at least ore .12 gauge pump

or autonatic shotgun, one or two semi-

, autoratic or automatic assault rifles,

or two bolt action rifles with a scope

scunted for snipping purposes, and of

course, the pigs have strapped on at

Least one haragun either an automatic

pistol or a revolver. In San Francisco,

the s.f. Tactical Squad members carry two

zanaguns, their standarà service revolver

plus a second bandgun which is their per-

•sonal preference; in many cases an auto-

¡atic pistol. So at this time let's

xamine these three types of weapons; the

hotgun, the rifle, and the handgun.

Chicago pigs did to the steel plate on

the door of our office there.

There is also a tear gas shall co

designed to de fired from a ,12 grios it

gun.

Every Black home should have at Ina:

one .12 gauge shotgua to be used to prote

the door. Use 00 buckshot and. it vill ¿e

with any criminals trying to enter minvi

Cuban guerrilas used shotguns very succes

fully in the revolutionary war led by Fir

Castro. They would set up ambushes close

to roads usually only a few feet away azo

shotguns loaded with Co buck would bare a

devastating ef.ect upor the occupaats of

cars and/or trucks.

• There is one thing about shotguns

that possibly can be viewed as in our fav

at this time, that is, that

the barrel is

smooth inside so it doesn't put any rarks

on the pellets; therefore, the pigs can't

maxe an investigation based on ballisiic

marks.

• 12 GURGE

•12 GUAUGE SHOTGUN:

the pigs use

kotsun, either purp or seni-automatic,

caded with oo buckonot gencrally in

¡rowd situtions such as rcuellions. The

¿andard load is nine (9) buckshot pellets

or shell, however there is the nagnun

THE RIFLE:

The bolt action rifle in

30-050-.308 (7-62181 Nato) with a four

scope (or better) counted, is a

reason. A specialist piece. This

virulent (deadly) combination is for one

purpose,

There is nothirg else to say about that.

The assault rifle is either semi-

automatic or preferable one that can be

fired either semi-automatic or fully auto-

ratic. The limit here in that posed by the

limit oi the enamy's arsenal. Here ve will

PRESS RELEASE

CCTOBER 25, 1970

Cr. Cetober 24, 1970, at approxinately 6:30 PM, tun racist pigs

Iron the Ind Precinct, without provocation, brutally beat'? black youths

or the corners

of Hyrtle and l6th Streets. Two brothers fron the local

National Cormittee To Combat Fascism, interceeded, simply exposing the

police brutality to the people in the community, and they also were

beaten by the pigs.

People in the crowd that had formed came to the

brothers aid and began to attack the pigs.

At this point, Mod Squad,

scotticking, yardnigger pigs. Forrest Harvey, Glenn Smith and Marshall

hersor, responding to their masters orders and wantonly opened fire on

the crowd.

The crowd defended theselves and one treacherous dog police was

dead and to. others layed

wounded. Many people from the community ran

into the newly opened National Committee to Combat Fascism office at

3375 18th Street.

The Detroit gestapo forces moved in with its overkill machinery,

. which included 2 tanks, automatic weapors and other types of lethal

reasons exactly like the ones these same inperialist. use in Vietnam.

The pigs indiscriminately opened

fire on our office and other houses

. in

the community. The fork tongued police have said that they used "great

restraint," but we, know that if it wasn't for the swift actions taken

by the black conmunity and other progressive people, Commissioner

Nicholas! henchmen would have committed mass murder.

The sisters and

brothers in the il.C.C.F. office, not taking the word of lying pigs, se-

fused to come out and didn't do so until they were insured by trusted

people from the comunity that conditions were favorable.

He see, this as part and parcel of the relentless attempt by the

fascist, l.S, government to destroy the Black Panther Party and its or

sanizing bureau's, The lational Conmittee to Combat Fascisin. For the

last six months, since the Nixon, Agnew, Mitchell, Hoover gang has been

oinking its fascistic "law and order" rhetoric, gangsters, disguised as

"guardians of the law" have attacked Black Panther-Party and National

Committee to Conbat Fascism offices, all across the country. Our Party

offices and d.C.Cor. offices in Philadelphia, New Orleans, Toledo, Uhio

and New

Eedford, Mass. have been undr attacked by the forces of re-

pression. And now, here in Detroit, police comminsioner licholas" and

G. Locally Stated Aims and Policy

LARRI PONELL, member of the Detroit NCCE, conducted

the political education classes on July 5, 1970, at which time

the topic of discussion was the center page of the July 4,

1970, issue of "The Black Panther" newspaper.

Those in

attendance were instructed

as follows:

Whenever you say "death to the pigs" mean it.

Put your words into action.

Use the slogan "all power to

the people" as the pigs think they are the power. 'Now we

have to add to our slogan "death to the pigs," so stop

talking and start putting your words into action.

The pigs

are planning genocide against us.

The reason there are more

pigs in the comnunity this year than lasc year is because

they are planning to get rid of all blacks, and they want all

blacks to move into the projects so all they would have to

do is put a fence around it and give them just enough money

to get food. They want to take everything away from us, but

we still have the power to destroy and there is no way the

pigs can destroy the BEP. If they kill us off, our struggle

will be taken up by the people in the community as we are

the people's party. If we don't go to the people then we

are not serving the people.

struggle is not confined

exists also in the south in the field of Civil Rights.

We have to fight for national salvation, deal with repression

and will fight for the liberation of all oppressed

peoples.

The Association of Black Students, Oakland

University, Rochester, Michigan, sponsored

a rally in

support of the Detroit 16 on November 16, 1970, featuring

HUEY P. MENTON.

The main theme of the speech given by HudY P.

NEWTON On November 16, 1910, at Oakland University, was that

all poor blacks and poor whites, the working classes,

the

oppressed of the world, must all join forces as a united

body against the "ruling circle" in the United States.

NEWION repeatedly referred to this "ruling circle" through-

out his entire speech and apparently interpreted this "ruling

circle" as those leaders of Government and industry, the

imperialists or those who are rich in this society. NEWTON

wanted eguality for everyone with no one being superior to

his fellow man.

He indicated the Megro is a class brother

with the poor whitas and they must join in their effort to

overcome the "ruling circle."

NEWTON stated, "The Black Panther Farty is the

vanguard of the revolution on à world-wide level because the

world is really one community and we've taken Marxist-Leninist

to a greater leveland, therefore, we are the greatest

Marxist-Leninists that ever lived, and we say this not to

be arrogant because some times I wish that someone else

would carry that banner because the way is narrow and the

burden is heavy."

In conclusion, the speech by NEWTON was a rambling,

many times incoherent Marxist-Leninist influenced, low-key

revolutionary type speech which attempted to show a connection

between the SPy and the League of Revolutionary Black Workers

(LP.BIT), as well as a unity between the BPP and all oppressed

persons of the world.

A characterization of the IRBW is contained

in the appendix pages

attached hereto.

His speech called for the release of the Detroit 16,

freedom for ANGELA DAVIS, BOBBY SEALE, and all the oppressed

brothers and for the ultimate overthrow of the pigs.

The speech appeared to be rather poorly organized

and NEWTON was easily diverted from

the main topics which

he seemed to be pursuing.

the speech had very few references

to añy actual radical action or violent confrontation.

The Black Student Union, University of Michigan,

Ann Arbor, Michigan, sponsored a rally in support of the

Detroit 16 on November 17, 1970, featuring HUET NEWTON.

NEWTON stated that the working class will be the

ones to carry out the "revolution" and carry the "revolution

banner" and will most likely initiate the creation of the

new order. Throughout his speech, NEWION talked about the

new order which will occur when. the world is taken over by

Conmunism.

BLACK PANTHER PARTY (BPF

also known as

Black Panther Party for Self Defense

According to the official newspayer of the SPP, the BPP

was started auring Deccmber, 1966, in Oakland, California, to

organize black people so they can

take control of the life,

politics, and the destiny of the black community.

It was

• organized by BOBBY G. SEALE, BPF Chairman, and HUEY P. NEWTON,

Minister of Defense,

BPP..

The official newspaper, called "The Black Panther,"

regularly states that the BPP

advocates the use of guns and

guerrilla tactics in its revolutionary program to end oppression

of the black people.

Residents of the black community are

urged to arm themselves against the police who are consistently

referred to as "pigs" who should be killed.

The newspaper, in its issue of September 7, 1968, had an

article by the then Minister of Education, GEORGE MURRAY.

This article ended with the following:

"Black men. Black people, colored persons of America,

revolt everywhere!

Arm yourselves.

The only culture

worth keeping is revolutionary culture. Change.

Freedom everywhere.

Dynamite! Black power. Use

• the gun. Kill the pigs everywhere."

The BPP newspaper, issue of October 5, 1968, had an

article introduced with the following statement:

"We will

not dissent from American government. We will overthrow it."

DAVID HILLIARD, Chief of Staff, BPP, in a speech at the

San Francisco Polo Field on November 15, 1969, said "We will

kill Richard Nixon."

DAVID HILLIARD, in the "New York Times," issue of

December 13, 1969, was quoted as follows:

"We advocate the

very direct overthrow of the government by way of force

and violence."

In the issue of April 25, 1970, the BPP newspaper had

an article by Minister of Culture EMORY DOUGLAS aS fO1JOWS:

"The only way to make this racist US government administer

justice to the people it is oppressing, is...by taking

up arms against this government, killing the officials,

until the reactionary forces...are dead and those that

are left turn their weapons on their superiors, thereby

passing revolutionary judgement against the number one

enemy of all munkind, the racist US government."

The BPP Headquarters is located at 1046 Peralta Street,

oakland, California.

Branches of the BIP, and Connittees to

Combat Fascism, under control of the BFF, have been established

in various locations in the USA..

BLACK PANTHER PARTY (BPP) ,

also known as

Black Panther Parts fo1

if Defense

According to the official newspaper of the BPP, the BPP

was started during December, 1966, in Oakland, California, to

organize black people so they can

take control of the life,

politics,

and the destiny of

the black community. It was

organized by BOBBY G. SEALE, BPP Chairman, and HUEY P. NEWTON,

Minister of Defense, BPP.

The official newspaper, called "The Black Panther,"

regularly states that the BPP advocates the use of guns and

guerrilla tactics in its revolutionary program to end oppression

of the black people.

Residents of the black community are

urged to arm themselves against the police who are consistently

referred to as "pigs" who should be killed.

?. 3

The newspaper, in its issue of September 7, 1968, had an

article by the then Minister of Education, GEORGE MURRAY.

This article ended with the following:

"Black men. Black people, colored persons of America,

revolt everywhere!

The only culture

worth keeping is revolutionary culture. Change.

Freedom everywhere.

Dynamite! Black power. Use

• the gun. Kill the pigs everywhere."

The BPe newspaper, issue of October 5, 1963, had an

article introduced with the following statement:

"We will

not dissent from American government.

We will overthrow it."

DAVID HILLIARD; Chief of Staff, BPP, in a speech at the

• San Francisco Polo Field on November

15, 1969, said "We will

kill Richard Nixon."

DAVID HILLIARD, in the "New York Times," issue of

December 13, 1969, was quoted as follows:

"We advocate the

very direct overthrow of the government by way of force

and violence."

In the issue of April 25, 1970, the BPp newspaper had

an article by Minister of Culture EMORY DOUGLAS aS fOllOWS:

"The only way to make this racist US government administer

justice to the people it is oppressing, is...by taking

up arms against this government, killing the officials..

until the reactionary forces... are dead and those that

are left turn their weayons on their superiors, thereby

passing revolutionary judgement against the number one

enemy of all mankind, the racist US government."

The PPP Headquarters is located at 1046 Peralta Street,

Oakland, California. Branches of the BEP, and Committees to

Combat Fascisin, under control of the Buf, have been established

In various locations in the ÜSA..

II. ACTS IN FURTHERANCE OF REVOLUTIONARY

- PROGRAMS AND POLICIES

On December 2, 1970, Detective WILLIAM HENDIALAIT,

Security Section, Intelligence Division, Detroit Police

Department, advised that he was contacted by the Detroit Edison

Electric Company, and advised that

a crew fron the electric

company went out to check the meter at 611 Continental,

Detroit, an NCCF office, which is on the rear of the house,

since a

request for service had not been received, and found

that the meter had been junped.

They were going to disconnect

the electricity at the meter but were chased away by occupants

of the house.

The electric company is not going to cut the

wire at the pole as they consider it too dangerous and are

going to let the NCCE have the electricity.

The Flint Chapter of the Detroit WCCE has begun

work on fortifying the house at 2009 Albert, Flint, Michigan,

by placing plyvood a few inches from the wall, which they

then plan to fill with sand.

BLACK PANTHER PARTY (BPP)

lso known as

Black Panther Party For Serf

Defense

According to the official newspaper of the BPP, the BPP

was started during December, 1966, in Oakland, California, to

organize black people so they can take control of the life,

politics, and the destiny of the black community. It was .

organized by BOBBY G. SEALE, BPP Chairman, and HUEY P. NEWTON,

Minister of Defense, BPP.

The official newspaper, called "The Black Panther,"

regularly states that the BPy advocates the use of guns and

guerrilla tactics in its revolutionary program to end oppression.

of the black people.

Residents of the black community are

urged to arm themselves against the police who are consistently

referred io as "pigs" who should be killed.

The newspaper, in its issue of September 7, 1963, had an

article by the then Minister of Education, GEORGE MURRAY.

This article ended with the following:

"Black men. Black people, colored persons of America,

revolt everywhere!

Arm yourselves.

The only culture

worth keeping is revolutionary culture. Change.

Freedom everywhese.

Dynamite! Black power.

Use

the gun. Kill the pigs everywhere."

The BPP newspaper, issue of October 5, 1968, had an

article introduced with the following statement:

"We will

not dissent from American government.

We will overthrow it."

DAVID HILLIARD, Chief of Staff, BPP, in a speech at the

San Francisco Polo Field on November

15,

1969, said "He will

kill Richard Nixon."

DAVID HILLIARD, in the "New York Times," issue of

December 13, 1969, was quoted as follows:

"He advocate the

very direct overthrow of the government by way of force

and violence."

In the issue of April 25, 1970,. the BPP newspaper had

an article by Minister of Culture EMORY DOUGLAS as fOllors:

"The only way to make this racist US government administer

justice to the people it is oppressing, is...by taking

up arms against

• this goveinment, killing the officials,

until the reactionary forces...are dead and those that

are left turn their weapons on their superiors, thereby

passing revolutionary judgement against the number one

enemy of all mankind, the racist US government."

The BPP Headquarters is located at 1046 Peralta Street,

Oakland, California. Branches of the BPE, and Committees to

Combat Fascism, under control of the BPE, have been established

in various locations in the USA.:

support of the Detroit 16 on November 16, 1970, featuring

HUEY P. NEWTON.

HUSY P. NOMPOw is the Minister of

Defense, BUP.

The main theme of the speech given by HulY P.

NEWTON on November 16, 1970, at Oakland University, was that

ali pour blacks and poor whites, the working classis, the

oppressod of the world, must all join forces as a united

body against the "ruling circle" in the United States.

NEWTON repoatcoly ceferred to this "ruling circle" through-

out his entire speech and apparently interpreted this "ruling

leaders of Government and industry, the

imperislists or those who are rich in this society.

wanted equality for everyone with no one being suparior to

his fellow man.

ality for inicatea

NEWTON

He indicate the Negro is a class brother

with the poor whites and they must join in their effort to

overcome the "ruling circle."

NENTON stated, "The Black Panther. Party is the

vanguara of the revolution on a world-wide level because the

world is really one community and we've taken Marxist-leninist

to a greater level

and, tharefore, we are the groacest

Marxist-Leninists that ever livea.

and we say this not to

be arrogant because some times I wish that someone else

would carry that banner because the way is narrow and the

burden is heavy."

In conclusion, the speech by NEWToW was a rambling,

many tires incoherent Marxist-Leninist influenced, low key

revolutionary type speech which attempted to show a connection

between the Bee

and the League of Revolutionary Black forkers

(LRER), as well as a unity between the BPP and all. Oppresses

persons of the world.

A characterization of the IRBil is containca

in the appendix pages actached hereto.

His spoech called for the rclease of the Detroit io,

freedom for ANGELA DAVIS, BOBBY SEALE, and all the oppressed

brothers and for the ultimate overthrow of the pigs.

The speech appearcd to be rather poorly organized

& NEWTON was easily diverted icom the main topics which

no sached to be pursuing.

The speech had very few references

to any actual radical action or violent confrontation.

The Black Student Union, University of Michigan,

ian Arbor, Michigan, sponsored a rally in support of the

Detroit 16 on November 17, 1970, featuring HUEX NEWION.

NENTON stated that the working class will be the

ones to carry out the "revolution"

and carly the "rcrolution

banner" and will most likely initiate the creation of the

new order.

Throughout his speech, NEWTOl talked about the

new order which will occur when the world is taken over by

Connunism. Throughout the speech, NENION refers to capitalism

stating that while it has caused many problems, it has also

laid the foundation for Communism. He stated that the

wealthy are the ruling circle and named ROCKEFELLER and FCRD

as being in this circle. NEWTON stated that they offeried

troops to the Vietnamese people, however, did not get a

definite answer on their proposal.

The 10 point program of the Black Panthers Party begins "We want our freedom.

The Black

"uple in America vere brought here fron their native land as slaves, and ever

nänce they have been kept on the lorest ievel of American society.

They are

aconmunity of people with their om history, econonic life, and culture.

Yet

they'us never had political power over theii

own community. The Black Panther

jarty corneà to fight for this political power.

But the founders of the Black Panther Party, led by duey P. Newion, knew

"Joat they had to have more than their goals. They had to understand how they

were going to achieve them. Huey's answer was "Serve the People" and "Picà up

the gun.

The Black Panthers realized that the people can be liberated only

by their

own efforts, and that the Panthers cad to reach out to their camunity,

find out, its needs, and respond to then.

And they realized that "political porer

brows cut of the barrel of a gun," that the beople in the black community were

being moved down by the police and had to defend thenselves, and that political

power over their commnity would never leave the hands of the rich and enter

the ir

•mon hands unless they combatted the police--the army of the rich.

Huey first put his understanding of serving the people and picking up the

gun into practice ghen he and Booby Seale went out one night with a hammer

anâ & shot gun to put up a stop sign that was badly needed by the community.

Bohhy stood guard with the snot gun while fuey harmered in the sign. Later,

the Panthers started many health clinics, brcakfast for children programs, and

- Diser community services.

:::: .

Because of what the Panthers want for their people, because they are going

isbout getting it, and because the cormunity is beginning to look towards them for

Leadershit, their enemy is scared. So scarea that they have stariea a netion

wide campaign to destroy the Panthere. Fred Hampton was murdered in Chicago

saLe he slept, bobby nution was murdered in Oskland, Calif, as he walked out

"of'" a

house with his hands up, both by police officers that still remain free.

Black Panther and i.C.C.F. offices all across the nation (L.4., New Oricans:

Toleão, Philadelpuia, have been attacked and ransacked by police officers.

And

nox Detroit joinsthe list, just as the hi.C.C.F. here was beginning to start a

free commity bealth clinic and to gain the support of the coununity.

But the Panthers continue to grow and sink deeper una deeper roots anoug

the people.

And all of us poor and working people, black and white, should be

glud, should defend the Panthers and help them grow. for the Panthers are

fighting the enemy of all poor and norting peonie:

the rich (e.t. the owners

of GM) who run this country and controi not ouly the black cosmunity but all of

•our conmunities, schools ana fuctories.

Huey says "We acn't hatc white peopic;

we hate the oppressor."

And so do we.

We say right on hucy ?. Newion. Pover to

the Black Panther Porty! Power to the Peopic!

of competing tith 1! or attenpting to contain it

Actually, Incressing the effectiveness of the

Revolution occurs in two main fields:

1. In the falestinian realm, which Ircludes

the Falestinian people and the armad

struggle in the occunied areas;

2.

In the Arab real, which includes the

Arab people, lara, and government.

The Falsstinian Revolution neods both the

Falestinian people and the Arab peopla.

The Revolution, likewiss, naods the Arab land di

as woll as inlestine.

Training must occur on Arab soil. Hoverent

of armamenis and supplies must rass through irab

lard. Storage of arms and supplios must be in Arab

land. Financial support comes from the Aran pople.

Information ard news must go ührough Arab channels.

The mobilization and organization of the

ralestinian people must be accomplishod in arab Jaro

whore they are located.

All this means that the Revolution is affecter

in one way or another by Arab conditions and Arab

pover structures. This highlights the extent of the

elfort to be exporded in the Araò countries in order

to harness all the potential in support of the

Revolution.

If they accept this concopt of the Revolution,

Friends,

In the naic of the people of Palestine, in the name of the

Palestinian Revolution, in the name of Justice and Peace for

which we fight, tre thank you for your concom and the concern

of your prople in Justice and l'cace in our part of the world.

We are very happy to have the opportunity to mect with you,

because you represcht people who fought for peace based on justiec.

We can see among you people who fought the Nazi invasion

and the fascist terror in burope.

We also find among you people who fought, and are sill

fighting, imperialisnt and colonialism and racial discrimination

in Africa, Asia and Latin America.

We honestly fecl that we stand among friends and comrades

who believe in the right of every people to self-determination and

its right to enjoy liberty on its own land, free of oppression and

discrimination.

Our people were deprived of their rights to self-actenination

and to the enjoyment of life on their own land without oppression.

This was the rcsult of a scrious racist aggression carried out.ly

an imperialist organisation: Zionism.

The aggression of the 5th of June is one manifestation of this

basic aggression that had its roots in the l9th century, and whose

culmination was the establishment of the State of Isracl in 1948.

The major victim of this aggression was the Arab Palestinian people

who were forced to evacuate their homes and land under a reign

ofterror and oppression. .

We therefore refuse

lo consider the 1967 aggression as i

without

considering the source of the aggresion itself.

The Resolution of the Security Council, November 22nd 1967,

and all further proposals explaining or modifyigit, are inadequate

and iriclevant from our point of view, and thercfore are totally

aid categorically unacceptable to us.

All such proposals skirt the real issue and avoid its core,

tion in order to re-establish peace with justice in the Holy Land.

* * *

We would like you to consider the magnitude of our problem.

For ive are facing a Zionist structure that had its roots in 19th

century Europe, at the heart of the imperialist movement. Zionism

is onc of the most oppressive and aggressive forms of imperialism,

one that has as its major goal the toial uprooting of one people

from a country to replace them by another.

The roots of the aggression lie in the Zionist ideology itself,

with its belicf in the nced to bring a select, chosen people without

a land, to a land that is to be evacuated by its inferior people.

methods used to accomplish this objective are terror,

OPPI

and deceit.

Lei me quote one of the original Jewish pioncers in Palestine,

Nathan Choshi, who wrote to the editor of the Jewish Newslelter

in February 1959:

"It you really wanted to know what happened, we old Jewish

setiler. in Palestine who witnessed the fight could tell you how

and iu what manner we Jews forced the Arabs to leave cities

and villages... Some of them were driven out by force of arms;

other wise rade to leave by deccit, lying and false promises.

It is rest ph in cile lue citis of Talla, Lydids, Ramich, Beer Sheba,

and: my fice, arog numeross others." Nathan Chofshi conti-

nued. He have perple tno lived on its own land for 1,300

nanc. Instead of being deuply ashamed of what we did and of

trying te undo some of the cvil we committed, by helping those '

uniortunate rengees, we justily our terble acis and even attempt

to glorify them."

Irofessor Erich Fromm, the noted Jewish wnter and thinker,

had this to add: "It is often said that the Arabs fled, that they leit

the country voluntarily, and that they therefore bear the responsi-

bility for losing their property and their land. But, in genera

international law, the principle holds true that no citizen loses hi.

property or his rights of citizership, and the citizenship right is i.

de facto right to which the Arabs in Palestine have much more

legitimacy than the Jews. Just because the Arabs fled? » Professor

Fromm asts. "Since when is that punishable by confiscation o

property and by being barred from returning to the land on which

a people's forefathers have lived for generations? The claim of

the Jews to the land of Israel cannot be a scalistic political cluim.

if all nations would suddenly claim territories in which their

forefathers have lived two thousand years ago this world would

be a machouse."

* **

The Zionists went ahead coldbloodedly with their sinister

scheme to vacate Palestine of its people, by the use of terror,

massacres and frightening rumors.

Arthur Koestler, the pro-Zionist author, described what

happened at Deir Yassin on April Oth, 1918, as the "blood bath

that was the psychologically decisive factor in the Arabs'

spectacular exodus."

On that day, the Zionist terrorist organization Irgun Zvei

Leumi killed 250 men, worien and children. After 1948 there

were other mass killings in occuped Palestino, c.g. Ikrit (1951), Al

Tira (1953), Abu Ghosh (1953), Kaft Kassem (1956), cic., as

part of the systematic Zionist plan for the complete evacuation

of the Palestinians, to be replaced by Jerish settlers from all

over the world.

These were the conditions that forced the Palestinians to leave

the homeland.

The Zionists did notcome to a country without people. There

lived in Palestine a people with a civilization. The reicied lo the

Zionist challenge by education, economic and human mobilization,

and competed with the 'Zionists in the fields of management;

finance and technology.

With all their efforts, by 1917 the Zionists had only been

able lo acquire 5.6% of the total area of Palestine, However, the

1947 U.N. rosolution for partition allowed them 56% of Palestine,

and by terror and aggression they went on to occupy 80% in

1948. Today, after the June 5 1967 aggression, the rest of our

¡occupicd, as well as Sinai and the Golan Heights.

For tienty ycars, the Palestinians were the victims of world

procrastination. While many resolutions were passed in the United

Nations, the Israclis continued to occupy more and more territory

while the world remained indildrent. Under such conditions, the

only alteruative left to the Palestinians was armed revolution.

I ain pure that the facis of the case are very clear to you. You

can visualize the conditions under which our people have suffered.

For twunt, years most of the ? lestmions hase lived in a diaspora

of shabbi kents, anisery and the humiliation of a meager dolc. In

this schizophrenic world of of the rights of Africans, Asians and

Polynesi, is were recognized and espoused, while Palestinian rights

were disit, praed and forgotten. Not even the tragedy of the heroic

ons; South Africans and Zimbabwans equalica theirs. For,

ing these oppressed people, the Palestinians were totally

uproo: sal, from their land and completoly denied the right to live

on it and enjoy its fruits.

Our people have risen to arms because all other means have

been exhausted. We refuse to accept miscry and diaspora as our

fate, and

ive refuse charity and compromise as solutions to our

problem. We shall overcome: through a long-term liberation

revolution to desiroy the bases of colonialist aggression that frustrate

the exercise of our inalienable rights, and to bring an eud to the

racist militarist regime that oppresses our propic. We will fight so

that peace with justice is restored to our land.

rusty weapons and against heavy odds, our youth embarked on

the revolution with all the deternination and persistence of & long-

oppressed people. Now as we crabart on our fith year of struggie,

the fruits of our sacrifices are beginning to show. The Palestine

Liberation Movement jas succueded in awakening our people,

in rekindling ils hope for a better future with dignity and respect

in our own land. We are forcing the enemies of peace to admit

their failure to extinguish our revolution, we are winning battles,

and we are starting to shape our distiny.. We are not swayed by

emotional appeals, we are not seckers of revenge, we are not

bloodthirsty terrorists. We are freedom fighters with clear and

mature goals. We are fighting today to create the nes Palustine

of tomorrow: A progressive, democratic, secular Palestine in

which Christian, Mostem and Jew will worship, work, live peacefuly

and erjoy equai rights. This is no utopian drcan or false promise,

for we have alvays lived in peace, Mostems, Christians and Jess

in the Holy Land. The Palestinian Arabs gave a refuge, a warm

shelter and a helping hand to Jows fieeing persecution in Christian

Europe and to the Armenians flecing persecution in Mostem

Turkey, as well as to Greeks, Circassians and Malise among others.

Our Palestinian revolution still stretches its welcoming hand

to all human beings who want to fight for, and live in, a democ-

ratic, tolerant Palestine, irrespective of race, color or religion.

During the last four years, some 500 of our people have given

their lives on the bailcfeld. During the same period many more

than that have died in refugee camps from bitter cold, poor nourish-

ment and disease.

We are here to assert to you, and to ask you to confirm to

your peopic, that our people will not lay down their arms until

Palestine is liberated and our rights restored. We will not accept

any settiement that demes us those rights, be it the Security

Council's resclution, or any other proposal or political settlement

ensuing from it. We will rot accopt any substituie to a war

of national liberation and will tenaciously hold to it regardless of

sacrifices and costs. Could anybody have asked you to accept

anything less than total freedom from Nazism, fascisin or colonia-

lism? We are confident the people of the world will back our

struggle and will support our revolution, for it is the struggle of

man to achieve the loftiest of man's values: peace and jusrica

Translator's Introduction

This dialogue was conducted with "Abi mar"

by Talal Salman,

a Isbaneso journalist who visiton

the sudaycon buses and indio a serdos of articlas in

a]-Saryed, a Lobanese wolly sagarine.

The first

article,

"Dialogue with Abu smar", appeared in

2I-Sayyad on Jamary ?, 2909.

Tho erticle is an important document because

it presents the ideas and thoughts of the loader of

al-Patch in a comprehonsive manner.

"Abu-amar" disa

cusses the idcas of the lovencht in clear torna, ai

attompts to answer critico by further explaining

• the

Movement's stand on certain ambiguous questions.

A number of important ideas are clarified in

chis article. First, the encigence of "Talestinian

identity" as an irdecordent force, adopting andad

strugglo to rogain the "land" and contront the

Imparialisi mesoroo. Second, Fateh's relation to

Arab eurorments is clarifiod.

"Abu-inani stresses

thiac tho movement does not intoriors in the local

ralitios of the Arab goveriments.

It depends on

popular support end on the masses for protection.

Faton seeks a certain indopondence and in that senue

it intorfares in the utiairs of hrab States: by

existing on their territory, by moving trooly, und

by exereising the right to fight for liberation ol

the occupied torritories.

Third, Entch appears as

a unifying forco, since its bases exisi in nost

Arab statos and its ren move frcely iron ons state

to another, Fateh, therefoco, works against

regionalism ans pronotes irab unity in action.

Fourth, the question of idoology où leftist vs.

rightist contraversy is clarified.

"Abil-smaz"

stresses that all Fatch men aro of tie motchod of

the earth sinco thoy lucl the means for existence.

E. Summary of Overall Activities

on May 5, 1971,

it was reported that JERRY LYNN

DAVIS was continually talking about the plans he was making

to start a new organization.

According to DAVIS, he

considered the MM organization to be defunct, at

least

in the San Diego area and in most of the Western states,

and felt, the need to organize a new Right Wing group to

fill the

power vacuum which it had left. He indicated that

he knew people in' Phoenix, Arizona; Portland, Oregon; seattle,

Washington,

and Las Vegas, Nevada,

who he wanted to contact

regarding such an organization, feeling that they would be

highly interested in helping to organize and get it going.

He said his plans included having Post Office boxes rented

for the new organization in all these cities and having

leaflets and stickers regarding the organization printed

using the respective Post Office box numbers.

On a pre-determined

day, press releases would be made in each of these cities

and stickers being put up in the cities on the same day.

This woula be done for the purpose of disguising the location

of the national headquarters, which would be actually located

in San Diego, California.

(SD T-I, May 5, 1971)

on september 13, 1971, it was reported that DaVIs

had become very interested in the National Socialist White

Peoples Party (NSWPP) as a possible answer to the need for a

going ahead with plans for the new organization.

In addition,

DAVIS indicated that he expected to obtain membership lists

and the necesary materials for setting up application forms,

bulletins and training literature for the new organization

and membership application forms printed in the near future

and that, tentatively.

the responsibility for making the

nonthly mail-outs would alternate between DAVIS and GODFREY.

DAVIS advised that le durALEXANDER of Alex Rapid Print, 7609

California, had agreed to print

described as a tormel

MM supporter who had allowed TROY HAUGHTON to use his printing

facilities

for the benefit of the West Coast MM organization.

Other plans for the new organization included

eventually setting up two membership lists which would be

recorded on microfilm.

One of the lists would be maintained

by DAVIs and the other by GODFREY. -The purpose in placing

Metory co

iho Gecret Army Organizatiou

One early morning in February, 1070, a group of sis 3Tnutemon leaders fron:

four sintos mot sceretly in Northern Arizona to discuss the crisis that the arrest and

imprisonmont of two top Al nutemen leaders and the ascascination of a third had

broughi on the organization. Although some of these men had met before in their ro/cs

as Minutemen grpup leaders, others were meeting for the first time.

Aftcr much discussion, two principal pointe wore agrocd won. First, thai the

Mimiten.en as a nationed coordination organization of mililant right-wing groups had

effectivoly boen destroyed by the pro-communist elements inside the justice Depart-

ment. While individual mits still existed throughout the country, few had the financial

support on leadership to be rcally effective. Second, thut the need for such a coordi~

nating organization wasgreater than ever in view of the increased revolitionary acuvity

by communists in the United Stales.

With these io points in mind, sugsestions were pil forward on a course of.

action to no followed.

After a inecting that lasted ali that day and far into the next

morning, on orgrail plan of actio!i was finally agreed upon. All present agrecd to

merge their individual units together and form a new organization under the command

of one lender elected from among theidolves, with the other live to be members of a

General Staft that would advise and easist the now: loader.

While zotaining the basic programs

and policies of the Minutemen, it was

decided that not only should this new organication have a different name, but also a

completoly now chain of command and organizational structure. If the new organizs-

Lion was

soing to survive the altacks that befell the old one, a whole new approach

would be needed. Never again could the azrestor death of a few leadershe allowed to

cripple the entire organization.

For this renson it was decided that only a highly disciplined military type

organization with & delinite chainofcommand would have any chance of success. This

then, was the boginning of the Secret Army Organization. Beginning with an origiusl

force o hard rorepatriots that numbered lever than twe hundred, the Secret Army

Organization began thejoh of pioling up ihe picces and continuing to fight for notional

SECRET ARMY ORGANIZATION

The Sceret Army O

mization is the most active, most completely dedicated and

most selective in iis membership of all the many patriotic organicalions in Amorica.

We are willing to make any sacritice for cur country and we fully expect that some of

us will bave to make the ultimne snerifice bofore victory is achiered. Our vory lives

depend on each other. Thore is no place in this orgunizabon for bungler's, playboys or

lukewarn concervatives. It you join the Scoret Arny Orgunization, there nighl ersily

come a time that your life would depend on how competently some other member had

learned lis job.

Unless you are especially well informud on the domestic and world political

situation, it, is probable that you have a lot to loarn about the present threat on nation

faces. Unless

you have had many yeurs exporionce in actual underground waufire,

there is undoubtedly a lot you oan learn from the exports in ous: organization who have

developed and supervised our training program.

OUR NATION IS IN IMMEDIATE DANGER

It is possible that within a very few years, perhaps even within months, our

nation could be conquered and enslaved by the communists. To prevent this we must

know as much as possible aboui our enemies. Unloss we know who they are and what

they are doing we will not succeed in our efforts to maintain a frea America.

THE RESISTANCE MOVEMIGNI

In driving an invader from your land the resistance involved goes through three

stages ul development.

1) The Underground Network

2) Active Guerrilla Warfare

3) -Open or Conventional Warfare

The conventional warfare stage uses everything in the way of weapons that the

chemy does but must alsohaze act reguerrillas andunderground agonis working egainst

the enemy, too. In the present state of military tacties conventionai wartare cannot

suceced unless these other to ingredients are lised simultaneously:

The first step is to forman underground network. An active guerrillasystem

must have the support of an undergacund network of approximately thee times is own

This underground

must supply the active gucrrilla lighter with supplies,

training until feu had a hard bitting team whore every individual was reliable, dedi-

eated, and had condience in his fellow unit members. Wouldn't it make you mad to

have the nationai or regional organication assiga some rank amateur lo your unit

that you you know little or nothing about?

Before any new member is assignod lo au Retire mit de to an important under-

ground project, he mustandorgo a period of training. boring this training he will be

engaged in. Every menbor will be expected to buy his own gun, am nunition and

other basic combat equipment. During training the new member may be expected to

buy certain booke or subscribe to certain magazines that his work requires. During

this time the new member will also be supplied with reading material on the strategy

and tactios of guerrilla varlare. This home work will make it possible for him to

fit in quickly to an active unir and participate elfectively in actual maneuvers,

marksmanship training; elc.

THE COATTEAR

General Outline

The "Combat Toam" is the stulost onganicutional rait used by the Scoret

Army Organization. When organized in the propor manor it is capable of opera

tionalinitiative when detached from the parent orgarianoa. When dovcloped to

its highesi degree of efficioney the Combat Team is almost totaliy self-suificient

and able to performany one of severei missions. do atlain these aims the follow-

ing elements ate essential:

Edipment should be well-chosso wri standardised as mich as pos-

sible.

b.

Communications, internal and external, must be capable of rapid

trsusmission, be varied in nature, and be exercised with primo

emphasts on security.

c.

Internal coordmation shouid be automatic in response. Contidence

among members of the team must be developed.

d.

Selection of each position on the team should be based onpsycholng-

: ical aspects ze well as tochnical compatence.

Training of the men in each function should be at roguine intervals

and continuous. Field problems should be given dry runs in detail.

f.

The logistios problem should bestudied with care, and made simple

and direct.

"g.

Each team will have a "leader" (Lieutenant) and on "assistant loudes"'

(Sergeant). These men shall be given special training by the Secret

Army Organization at "leadership seminars".

Team. "marsholling points" should be selected in advance and be

well defined. Prucice alerts" will deiermine the team's efficiency

in response and security.

Terrain familiarity within the expected operational radius of the

team must be developed.

Weapons familiarity mestboobtai.ed throughlivefirings at various

targets. Team action must be strossed as well as individual com-

petence.

k.

The team louder should sue that a constani flow of information is

provided to team semiers on the ideologieni strugele. This will

help induee the proper frume of mind in each member.

1.

Team missions and targets must be identified and the proper train-

ing equipment made available for sach assignment.

ml.

The 1cam

ors will be responsible for mai

nining the overall,

sccurity of the unit. Personal feelings should not aftict decisiona

involving reprimandor dismissalof men from the leat for roasons

that endanger its operation or security.

Il..

0.

Intelligence gathering as un important pam of each team menber's

duties should be stressed. Informacion on the location and move-

ments of local communist and icie-wing cucintes of the organization

should be sent to either Regional or Genernl Headquarters.

The toam leaders will be responsible for maintaining contact with

higher commund and for the transmission of orders from same.

ORGANIZATION

The "Combat Team" will consist of six mel. These six mon will be divid-

ed into two sub-teams (Sections). Number One Section will consist of the Team

Lieutenant and two other team members. Number Two Section will consist of the

Tean Sergeant and the two remaining team members. When completely assembled

the wit will act directly under the command of the Team Lieutenant. When split

into sections the Team Sergeant will carry out the prders of the Team Lieutchant

during missions, but will be in inmediate command of the Number: Two Section.

In the absence of the Team Lieutenaut the Sergeant will take command of the Unit.

TRANSPORTATION

Transportation of the Combat Team will be effocted by the use of tie car-

riers,

Interception and/or destruction of one carrier will not, then, imobilize

the teara. In addition, each carrier can serve as a scouting element for the other.

Motorized carriers should be as inconspicuous as possibie and still serve their

purpose. Jeeps and pickup trucks should be used only where such vehicles are

owned and used commonly by the general population or where the terrain makes

their use necessary. Most often an orcinary passenger car will suffice. The

model selected should have a good road cleurance so it can be used on dirt roads.

Tire chains (if needed), hydraulic jacks, extra gas, water, and suitable tools

should bs stored in the vehicle.

TRAVEL PROCEDURES

Underway, Carrier #1 will lead and Carrier #2 will trail, The "interval"

will vary with conditions. In cities glose-aboud trailing willbe used. Open road,

ky day, will require an interval of approximaioly 300 yards. At night this will

be reduced to approximately 100 yards. During travel, all equipment (espocially

arms and aminunition) should be kept op of sight. Speciai team equipment and

weapons should be loeked in the trunk of the vehicio until needed. The trunk key

should he carefully hidden se as to make it difticuli to sourch the trunk in case

law enforcement agenis should stop the car on soine pretext with the intention of

searching it illegaliy.

GENERAL HEADOUARTERS

Dear Fellow American,

Encored with this faiter is your Declinkery Trainig Program. This

first program is only a broi outline of ounce the maerial that will be cover-

ed in later programs. There are four basic programs used by the Secret Arny

Organization: Intelligence, Security, Propaganda, and Beeruiting, in that

order. Bach program will cost the new member 53. 00 and will take botiveen

ono to throe veels to compluto.

The correspondicues teaming progzam serves a number of purposes,

but the two major purposes are:

1. It lets us lags which members uf the organization have the palichee

and determination lo finish assigaments given them.

2. It lets us be certain that the members have the necessary basic

training in intelligence, security, etc., which is essential to al-

most any important task which we could assign a member in under-

ground warfare.

Proper iraining in these four basic stilis is absolutely essential for

every memier of an underground army. A member inay be an experi in suz-

vival techniques, use of weapons, urban warlare tactics and ali the rest but

experionce has shown that withovi these other basic skills they seldom do much

fighting - they just cormit suicide.

For those of you who wish lo bocome active and trusted members of the

Secret Army Organisation, let us emphasic: agoin that the quickest way of do-

ing so is to begin and diligently compicio the hasic training progo aus.

After you have comploted the dive suck projects listed in the Preliminary

Training Program send $3.00 in do your regular mail drop and ve will send you

the first trainiog peogram on Intelligonie.

In view ot tie urgent situation we

non' face some of our new mombers upt rocohe spociol assignments after

having completed the first lue training proscams. If this boppens please try

to redouble your offorts no that yout agocind assigements can be laken care of

while continuing to compiet your reguld training program.

De all these, intelligence is most important. fel's consides one example:

your eyos and puryou finger on ooo namo. Now soppose you read that name for

the dist lame und aud to yousolt, "Bonctime in the next 30 days Im goingio kill

Consider the situntion - one man, picked at random is marked for death. Ha

fore the fire to be considered in our training program.

The word "intelligonce", when used in a military sonse refers to thoss

methods that can be used to gain useful information. We usually think of this as

knowledge of the enemy but it also irelades information about the terrain, goncral

population, availohle supplies und ail other facts that will help in planing future

activities.

SECURELY

It is obrious what a gret advantage no can gain over our chemies by proper

information aloui thoir plens end activities. It is equally true thai much of this

advantage wit be lost unless we can keep our plans and activities secret from them.

Thite is the basie purpose of all security activities. Crocall secruity opcrations of

an undergiound movement can be divided into live basic parts:

I. Protecting the identity of underground personnel and their families.

2. Keeping socrot the location, movements andplans of undergreund units.

3. Keeping secret the location of underground headquartors, alternato

hideouts and suppiy depots.

1. Protecting the identily of civilians, di individual members of the popu-

Jation that are friendly te underground forces.

5. Mainiaining acorcoy of communications.

As we have alroady onid il is diftcult to even guess what forms the coming

conflict will take.

The intolligence branch of our organization is weil aware of the communist

said that we aro non pacially coutolled by a foreign ideology. Thus, we are im

ready engaged in Phase I of this conflict. How fong this will continue until open

warfare breaks out is anono's guess. Once again, the best prediction of our in-

tolligneco depariment is that Stagu Il will last for soveral munths, perbaps even

years.

counter lerror.

For most peopic membership in the Secret Army Organization will not

Another pssootial function of the undergroand is to convincingly inform the

This must be done brough propagara, bott writied and speken. Under:

conditions of enemy occupation the spreading at and-communist propaganda would

ubviously be very dangerous. Ecca now there are certain phases of our propaganda

effort that is last done by surreptitions means. Thus, observation, communication

Novoo before has propaganda been so importani to the altimate outcome of a

major conflict. The ulilmate object of any war is to force your dosires ou the minds

TRAINING PROGRAMI

INTELLIGENCE

We nre faeed with a dangerous chemy who has repentedly boasted of his

plans to destroy our Constitutional Republic and to unsiave our poopla.

For more than fourty Years thoy have been intub aling their agents luto

the most sensitive areas of labor, press, entortninment, education, law, coni-

munications, religion, industzy and government. The degree of their success

is made obvious by our govercmont's fulurelo oppose communis internation-

ally and by our fellow citizens' lack of interest in thoir own preservation.

We already know a considerable amoun about this enemy; their origin,

objectives, approstimate strength, orgenizational structure and goneral meth-

ods of operation.

There ars four areus where we especially need ariditonal information:

1. Details of tho tecimigues used in espionags, intiiontina and subver-

sion by individual agents, including the methods hy which they control their

fellow travelers.

2.. The equipment used for surveillance, communication, assassination,

sabotage, etc., by individual enemy agents.

3. Working details of their short range programs either i operation or

planned for the near future.

4. The actual identily of enemy agents, fellow travelers and sympati-

zers along with details regurding their work, place oi residonce, cover opera-

tion, means of transporlation,

travel pattorn, porsonal arpearance, mental

characteristics, personal lives, businoss and orgurdzational activities.

Our ultimate victory of coteat mey depoad on our ability io obtain

encugh of this vitally important infoamation.

There are literally thousands of sources from which bits of valuable in-

formation can be obtained. These range prom such extremes as the local news-

papers to docun enis stolen from the cogny's guarded vaults.

- The methods

of guthoring intolligence are roughly divided into lo

groups: 1) Muscuach and Analysis, and 2) Esptonast

Espionage includes all the "illegal means of obraining information, such

as wire lapping,

interoception of mail, stoalmy of documalls, secretly photo-

graphingrocords, infloraling opte into enemy organizations, bribing or black-

mailing individuals of the cremy apparats.

Research and Analysis includos the caroful systematic search of all

of valuable intelligence

from several "haystacks" of goneral information.

Professional intelligence orgenizations obtain about 95% of their infor-

mation from Rescech and Analysis and only choat 5% from Espionage, Whoa

ospionage techniques are used, they prove most effective wheu a specilic mis-

sion is carefully planned out in advance which takes advantage vi ail possible

background information that may be obtained by research methods:

Let's examine how these various techpiques might be nsed to obtain

additional information of the four basic typos we need most.

1. Dotals cê tho techniquos uned in espinnano, infiliration and subver-

sion by individual arents including methods by which they control their fello

travelezs.

An agent trainee may learn something of the general espionage metheds

used by communist agonis who have defected from the parig and inve then

written about their experiences. Beyond this they ne of very like value. The

actual details of such techniques are uniformly neginsted.

More useful information can be obinined from the study of past court

records in which evidcoe has boch presented in esplonage ease!. Hints and

clues may occasionally be picked up facm continuous and caraful study of the

regular news media. Ecally basic informtion of this type, however, must be

obiained by inntigation aud espiounge tochniques.

•2. The vocipment used formovetilace, commmicatioos, assassination:

sabotage, etc...

by Man dant carts.

Information on explosives is available tears ordinonce journals, litera

tuze from manufacturers, technieal book, ming and calling mogazinos, etc.

Naturnily, such special folds of interesi are best pursued by some poi-

son who already has an aputude in each partentor ling.

This is one of the things that maises us frei that the Amerienn people are

uniquely equipped. to form a deadly effeclive undergrowd. Nowhere else in the

world does any population have as many useful hobbies and arocations that could

used as sabotage instruments. Just one lypical example - the dust from griad-

ing whools in metel shops should bo saved to mix with orcase for the bearings

3. Workleg details of their immediato and future plans and activities.

Advance information about "peace marches"' and racial demonstratione

car be had by subscribing to appropriaté communist front publications. Details

as to tho size of the demonstration and degree of violonoe auticipated must be

obtained by inflirating such organizations. Communist plans for future propa

ganda campaigus, suiversion, espionage, blackmail of government officials,

eic., may be learned directly by infutration or may be deduced from a close

stacly of their past activities.

4, Identity and personal information about enemy agents.

This requires the full serpe of counter espionage activity; rescarch and

analysis of enemf publications, monitoring of communist sponsored meetings,

surveiliance of parij offices, infiltration of enomy apparatus, recrutment of

double agents, intercoption of enemy communtentions, ale, etc.

TECHMQUES OF AFFECTIVE RESCARCHI

1. Every researcher should be constagtly on thr alert for useful infor

NK 157-2011

On March 1, 1974, DRAGEP. and CARROLL were released

on bond from the Sagamon County Jail. The subject's vehicle,

a 1970 Ford pickup truck, with a camper truck unit, was left

by DRAGER at the Sheriff's Impound Lot.

On March 6, 1974, NK I-2 advised he obtained information

that FRANK DRAGER had VISIted ROBERY MUCh Titular, Head of

the Minutemen Organization, in Nortorne, Missouri.

The Minutemen organization was organized

in 1960, reportedly to resist the spread

. of

communism in the United States by use of

guerrilla tactics.

Robert B. DePugh, national

coordinator of the Minutemen, was sentenced in

October, 1970, for violations of the Federal

Firearms Act.

At the time of his arrest DePugh

was

in possession of documents concerned

with

guerrilla warfare and other paraphernalla, including

nand grenades

gun silencers, and

a machine gun.

DePugh wais released on parole during April, 1973,

and in June, 1973, 'indicated he planned to revitalize

the Minutemen into a "two-armed organization".

Arm number one

was to be utilized as a political

front organization to sway elections and control

local

and state political structures. Arm number

two was to be an underground guerrilla organization

made up of "strike teams".

These "strike teams"

are to be under direct control of DePugh and their

existence is to be unknown to

everyone, including

Minutemen

State Coordinators.

After leaving Norborne, DRAGER was arrested

• in

Springfield, Illinois. DRAGER Was scheduled to proceed to

Columbus, Ohio to meet with JOHN 'GERHARDI, Leader of the American

White Nationalist Party (AWNP) and was to

continue to Reading,

Pennsylvania, to meet with ROY

FRANKHOUSER.

DRAGER was supposedly carrying a message from DE PUGH

to GERHARDE and FRANKHOUSER.

GERHARDT and his brother, ED

GERHARDT, are leaders of the AWIP in Columhus, Ohio.

The GERHAPDT'S

and a JAMES THOMPSON were arrested for shooting the

homes of

school officials in Columbus, Ohio. JAMES THOMPSON allegedly

turned stated witness against the GERIARDT brothers.

"I had originally planned for this communication to

be typewritten, but since I stole this tape recorder, I guess

it's just

as appropriate as a letter.

Clarence Kelley, Director of the FBI,

Washington, I. C.

Dear Mr. Kelley:

I had always praised the thoroughness of the FBI,

even though on scores of occasions you've permitted your

paranoia and your lack of human understanding could foul. you

up. Your drooling excitement and your paranoic stupidity and

your fruitless eagerness at having Frank Drager in your grimy

grubs in Springfield, Illinois, make super idiots of the

Federal Bureau of Integration.

You now realize how many

foolish errors you;made. In the near future you will be em-

ployed by the new natural government of America rather than

the Jew Justice Department and such sapidity will not be

tolerated. How ridiculous for a gang of trained investigators

to be fooled and beaten by a teenager. Have you idiots put

all the pieces together yet? Whether or not you have, we both

thank God for your paranoid stupidity for now we are free to

continue tying together the few remaining loose ends which

will permit the National Revolutionary Army to eliminate

criminal Jewish control of America. Now our armies can con-

tinue to join forces to eliminate this alien enemy government.

Continue your search for Frank Drager and Bill Carroll. It'll

be useless and frustrating. If you are lucky enough to capture

one of our soldiers in the future, beware, there's a speeding

soft-nose for all of our enemies.

Unfortunately, most fellow

Agents are mercenaries. They are actually with us in spirit

but they will still follow the orders of their Jewish superiors

to attempt to detect and capture our people and unfortunately

we will have to deal with these Agents ruthlessly until they

realize that they are dominated and controlled by alien enemies

of America and begin working on the side of right. At one

time not too long ago we patriots were as useless_as a bunch.

Now our goals are within our grips and our armies are beginning

to activate. A large segment of the left and the right are no

longer shooting at each other. Yes, the fear of our enemies

is now realistic.

The bullets of all pro-American revolution-

aries are aimed at the alien enemies in control and

not at

each other.

Summer is near. Federal Agents beware.

We mean

business

and we have the facilities not to be stopped. Your

laws don't bother us; your jails don't

bullets will be retumed with wore bullegare us; and your

Your leaders have

bankrupted our people, have starved them, and caused enough

materialistic havoc that we now have the will of the people

with us. Even the stupidist in America see through the grain

shortages, fuel shortages, price gougings, meat shortages,

work stoppages, and various other criminal corruption by the

eremy aliens in control. America's masses are in the corner.

Now just stand back and watch them come out shooting. When the

smoke clears, America shall be the victor.

"The following portion of this communication will

be the only press release of the New Revolutionary Army. In

future months, as our movement gains momentum, I wish for the

press to understand what we are about rather than what the FBI

tells them. There is a brief but somewhut inclusive listing

of our program included.

The New Revolutionary Party herewith immediately de-

clares that the present Government of the United States of

America is an illegal confederation of aliens and enemies of

the people of America.

The New Revolutionary Army, its officers

and followers henceforth secede from the United States of

America until such time we may be able to restore a Government

of the people, by the people and for the people and oust the

enemy aliens now in control. Through force and violence and

whatever means available to the NRA, we will totally, forcefully

and quickly restore sanity to our American republic. We have -

adopted the American Constitution in its original form, revised

1-2 .

ments to the Constitution.

of the hundreds of known ande have formed

a national caucus

unknown political leaders whose

present identity will remain anonymous, who at the time the

enemy aliens perish or relinquish control, will immediately

be brought before the American voter to seize popular control

of vacant political offices.

We of the NRA are the people, we speak for the

people, and we will violently eliminate America's enemies

with the haste of

a speeding bullet.

The NRA has chosen for

its spokesman a well-known adversary for the return of America

to a natural social order. The revolutionaries of the NRA are

ordered to maintain in every way possible or to avoid detection

by the enemy, but are ordered not to deny their association if

at such time they are detected by the enemy or captured. All

NRA members and associates are instructed that if captured they

are governed by the laws set at the Geneva Conference for cap-

tured soldiers and prisoners of war. This is by all means a

declaration of war

The enemies of white America will fall

like flies at a Raid party.

The following is a very brief synopsis of the goals

of the NRA once we seize power.

#1.

All non-whites

immediately loose citizenship

• and prepare for repatriation.

#2. The Federal Reserve will be abolished and all

illegal tender returned and it will be replaced with legal

be able to

•get them from a Minuteman member in Indiana.

DRAGER alleges to have traveled to various parts of

the country and has urged members of the right wing to commit

acts of violence on July 4, 1974, so that the NRA could take

credit for these acts.

The source was advised DRAGER exhibited

four .45 caliber pistols, three .30 caliber carbines and one

bolt action rifle at this meeting.

The source was further advised DRAGER braggs about his

passing bad checks in Florida and his using stolen credit cards

to purchase gasoline, food and lodging. DRAGER supposedly plans

to obtain $200,000.00 in the near future and this might be

accomplished through a kidnapping or bank robbery.

DRAGER also requested the group to cause incidents

such as explosions on July 4, 1974, so a group he is forming

called the NRA could take credit for it. DRAGER stated he was

going underground and would use the code name Gopini.

Apression

DRAGER was known to have stayed at AL LENTZ' residence

from June

31 1974 to June 6, 1974.

with a Ku Klux Klan member in Philadelphia, it was learned six or

seven individuals met at the home of AL LENTz, on June 5, 1974,

in York, Pennsylvania. All in attendance represented a

small

group

of independent Ku Klux Klan members and several Indiana representatives

of the Minutemen. FRANK DRAGER was in attendance and discussed his

an associate of DRAGER's; however, JAKE was not present during this

meeting.

During the meeting, DRAGER wanted FRANKHOUSER's help in

obtaining fuses for timing devices for explosives and requested

further assistance in several projects. FRANKHOUSER stated he

declined in both cases.

DRAGER stated

he had looked into the Gubow

matter in Michigan, and indicated he and his group were going to kill

Judge GUBOW. DRAGER stated he had been to Michigan and

"cased"

the judge's

home.

DRAGER stated he tried to contact the wife of

Reverend ROBERT MILES, in Michigan, but she would not talk to him.

DRAGER stated the only reservation

he had about killing Judge GUPON

was whether or not it would effect the appeal of Reverend MILES.

It is noted Judge GUBOW is the Federal judge who sat in

on the case involving Reverend ROBERT MILES, who was tried and

convicted for the bombing of school buses in Pontiac, Michigan.

FRANKHOUSER stated DRAGER also stated he was going to take

care of two FBI agents and mentioned the names CLONINGER (phonetic)

who have worked Ku Klux Klan matters in the Trenton, New Jersey area.

FRANKHOUSER stated he accompanied DRAGER and they walked

to the vicinity of 3rd and Walnut Streets, Reading, Pennsyivania,

FRANKHOUSER observed numerous handguns and rifles and believed there

were explosives in the trunk. FRANKHOUSER could not furnish further

¡ "we mean business".

FRANKHOUSER then stated that DRAGER indicated he had a

"caper" planned that would meant $100,000.00. DRAGER did not

further discuss the caper.

FRANKHOUSER concluded on his own that

the "caper" was possibly a bank robbery.

FRANKHOUSER denied any

specific knowledge regarding any bank robberies on DRAGER's part.

FRANKHOUSER stated he was contacted by DRAGER via telephone

call on one occasion subsequent to June 7, 1974 meeting.

At this

time, DRAGER indicated two of his men had

been arrested

"caper" was delayed.

This contact was about two days prior to

DRAGER'S arrest in New Jersey.

It is noted the New Jersey State Police made available

a XeroX copy of

1974, at 1:41 pm,

in the vicinity of 4th Street, Reading, Pennsylvania,

Ticket Number 18025, thusly verifying that DRAGIR was in

They then went to the Jersey Shore where BRODERICK

and DRAGER obtained employment at the Captain Courageous Bar.

BRODERICK and DRAGER were known to have stolen numerous checks

from the Captain Courageous Bar and passed these checks to

, obtain money to travel to Florida.

In September of 1973, he, DRAGER and BRODERICK were

arrested in Toms River, N.J., in what he felt was a "set up".

FBI had made their presenceknown to

the local authorities so the local authorities would arrest

and harass them for the FBI.

The three of them made bail and

purchased 40 pounds of marijuana and left for Florida ir

FRANK DRAGER'S Camper truck.

NRA, which CARROLL stated was the same as the White Action

Movement founded by DRAGER several years ago at Trenton, N.J.

On their way to Springfield, they stopped at the residence of.

DON ZINN in Michigan.

CARROLL indicated that during their

travels they wise constantly seeking weapons, ammunition, and

manuals on gorilla warfare.

While in Springfield, Ill., in February, 1974, they

were arrested for possession of marijuana, burglary tools,

and dangerous weapons.

CARROLL again advised he felt the

thought that possibly DE PUGH was an informant or else the

FBI had seen them with DE PUGH and followed them to the

location of their arrest. CARROLl stated he used the identification

DRAGER obtained bail money for them and upon their

release from jail they tried

to obtain the camper truck back

but were advised by the local authorities it was going to be

used as evidence in their pending case.

Inasmuch as they had no trasportation, they then

hitchhiked from Springfield, Ill., to York, Pa., where they

visited with AL LENTZ.

They then proceeded to Trenton, N.J.,

and obtained a rental car which they did not return.

CARROLL

indicated they then left the Trenton area and went to Boston,

Mass., in efforts to get him a driver's license.

While in

Boston they tried to cash several more Captain Courageous

checks but were not successful, inasmuch as everybody

required photographic identification.

After having left Boston, Mass., they travelled to

Washington, D.C., and visited a SKYLER FERRIS (phonetic).

They

tried to obtain maps of the sewer system of Washington, D.C.,

from him. FERRIS was advised of their plans to bomb the

Internal Revenue

Service (IRS) and at first FERRIS was not

agreeable.

FERRIS was then guaranteed that the local authorities

would be advised of the bomb a half hour prior to its detonation

on July 4, 1974.

FERRIS was agreeabla to this plan and

supplied them with the diagram of the sewer system.

FERRIS

is further known to be a right wing patriot and supplied

names of local patriots to DRAGER.

After departing Washington, D.C., they travelled

to Florida and visited with an ORVILLE LIPPERT.

They then proceeded to Alabama where they registered

the vehicle they stole in Trenton, N.J.

They then travelled

back to York, Pa., and saw AL LENTZ again. They, visited

several days with LENTZ and then returned to Trenton, N.J.,

where they looked up a JAMES KEITH, who is known to be a

close friend of JAMES BRODERICK.

They requested him to find

them an apartment which they could rent for several weeks

prior to their planned July 4 attempt to bomb the IRs,

Washington, D.C.

KEITII, DRAGER, and he were going to the Florence

Motel in Florence, N.J., to move into a room they had rented.

DRAGER was dropped off at an Acme Market to buy groceries

inasmuch as there was not room in the vehicle for the three

of them and groceries.

They were heading toward the mosel

to deposit their equipment and clothes when they were arrested

by the New Jersey State Police for passing a stopped school

bus.

He stated he was going to shoot it out with the New

Jersey State Trooper but became concerned when KEITH did not

appear to go along with the idea. They were going to stay at

the motel for approximately two weeks and then return to

Pennsylvania and get dynamite from some patriots in Pennsylvania.

If this plan was unsuccessful,

they had planned to go to one

of the Western Statés and obtain dynamite under the guise of

future prospectors.

He stated that the chemicals that were

In the car at the time of his arrest were experimented wich

by he and DRAGER in efforts to make a bomb.

These efforts were

not too successful and thusly they decided dynamite would be

a better method.

CARROLL advised the NRA is identical to the White

Action Movement formed by DRAGER in 1970 in Trenton, N.J.

He claims to have organized chapters all over the United States

and Canada and these groups are composed of disgruntled right

wing patriots who are not satisfied with the passive activities

of the KKK and the Minutemen Organization. He claimed to have

taken an oath and could not divulge who any of these other

members are.

He claimed this group is storing weapons and

explosives and

no chapter knows where the other chapter's

weapons are.

CARROLL stated the NRA believes in doing anything

necessary to support themselves while they are endeavoring to

overtake the U.S. Government.

The NRA believes in bank

robbery, armored car heists,

and cashing stolen checks.

He said presently the NRA has no plans for political kidnappings.

He stated all their members are instructed to die for the

cause if necessary.

The NRA has devised a code system whereby

one member can contact another member without the Federal

authorities knowing this is being done. He stated they have

several training grounds throughout the East Coast and

Mid-west areas and their men are being trainea in the use of

en are being

all kinds of weapons.

When specifically asked who other members of the

NRA were, CARROLL refused to identify any of these members

and it appeared as if possibly no members did, in fact,

exist.

CARROLL advised JAMES KEITH, who was arrested with

him in the stolen motor vehicle, was not a right wing Patriot

and could not be trusted.

KEITH's services were requested

by DRAGER inasmuch as KEITH is a close friend of JAMES

BRODERICK and was known to be active in criminal endeavors in.

the Trenton area.

He and DRAGER believed KEITH might be able

to financially help their cause.

CArROLl advised the NRA's philosophy was an incorpora-

tion of much of the thoughts of the KKK, Minutemen, and the

American Nazi Party. He stated they were more revolutionary

and would actively and ardently endeavor to overthrow the U.s.

Government and replace it with the National Revolutionary

Army •

He expounded the philosophy that the NRA was anti-Jewish,

anti-Negro, and anti-Catholic.

NA, was anta-

The NRA is promoting the

deportation of all non-native born Americans and the return

of the Jews and Negroes to their homelands.

He stated they

were definitely against the Federal Income

Tax, which is

what led them to decide to blow up the IRs building in

Washington, D.C. The NRA further advocates political assassinations

if necessary.

He; stated that DRAGER had considered killing

a Judge GUBOW in Michigan but decided not to inasmuch as the

judge's death might hinder the appeal of Reverend BOB MILES

who has been sentenced to prison by Judge GUBOW for the

bombing of school buses in Michigan.

CARROLI stated he and

DRAGER have cashed numerous stolen checks throughout the U.s.

to support themselves.

He indicated DRAGER was possibly

involved in an armed robbery in the Boston, Mass., area but

then decided he did not want to talk further about this matter.

DRAGER had obtained numerous handguns and rifles

while travelling throughout the u.s.

Most of these weapons

were purchased in the name of FRANK DRAGER, Using identification

DRAGER had obtained in his own name in Florida.

CARROLL was asked about his knowledge of a tape

- recording sent to ORVILLE LIPPERT in Florida, where DRAGER

requests LIPPERt's assistance in returning his camper truck,

which LIPPERT purchased fron him, to his aunt EDNA GRABER

in Trenton, N.J. In this tape, DRAGER identified himself to

LIPPERT so that EDNA GRASER can purchase back this vehicle for

DRAGER.

CARROLI Stated LIPPERT purchased this vehicle from

DRAGER fOr $1.00. LIPPERT went to Springfield, Ill., and

obtained the

truck from the Springfield, Ill., police authorities.

At the end of this tape, DRAGER makes reference to the fact

he killed "two pigs", in Atlanta and one in Miami Beach but

with zero publicity.

DRAGER then states "watch out for the

third pig." CARROLI advised the word pig referred to the

believe DRAGER would actually blow up the IRs Building.

DRAGER stated that they were presently operating a stolen

motor vehicle and were wanted by the FBI.

KEITH stated he

found an apartment on the corner of Hamilton and Chambers

Streets in Trenton, N.J., but DRAGER refused this inasmuch

as it was on the third floor rather than the first floor.

going to shoot it out with the trooper.

KEITH told him

were stopped. The officer advised them they had illegally

passed a school bus and requested to see JAKE's identification.

JAKE then handed the trooper a driver's license and the

trooper evidently noticed JAKE had several other driver's

licenses in his wallet. The trooper then apparently became

suspicious and made them stand against the car while he looked

around.

The trooper then spotted one of the guns, placed them

under arrest, and later determined the car to have been stolen.

KEITH stated he is a parole violator inasmuch as

he has been arrested. KEITH indicated he had no involvement

with DRAGER and JAKE and had requested he transfer to another

jail inasmuch as his involvement with JARE might get him into

further trouble.

He stated that in his conversations with JAKE while

in. the Burlington County Jail he has determined the following

information:

DRAGER and JAKE had received a map of the diagram

of the sewer system in Washington, D.C., from a friend of

DRAGER's who works for the Sewer Department in Washington, D.C.

JAKE and DRAGER indicated they were going to blow up the

• IRS

Building in Washington, D.C.

It was also determined that

DRAGER has dynamite and guns buried on a farm, which is in

Pennsylvania. The name GEORGE HOUSER was mentioned in reference

to this farm. JAKE had indicated he and DRAGER had gone to

the Boston, Mass., area and possibly were involved in a bank

robbery.

JAKE and DRAGER had pre-arranged plans to make an

escape at any courthouse the other one was to appear if

apprehended. A person by the name of DE PUGH was to have

Ku Klux Klan meeting at Rising Sun, Md., in efforts to get

the Canadian border.

The walls of the camper truck have secret

compartments and DRAGER is supposed to have a gun contact in

involving his identification papers being found on a WILLIAM

ERIC CARROLL when CARROLL was arrested on June 13, 1974,

by the New Jersey State Police at Columbus, N.J.

JENKINS initially advised he had no knowledge as to

how WILLIAM ERIC CARROLI, could be in receipt of his driver's

license and Social Security Card. He stated he had lost

his wallet several months back and did not know its where-

abouts.

At that time, it was pointed out to him that

CARROLL was a travelling companion of FRANK AUGUST DRAGER,

and that DRAGER haã had his White Action Hovament Headguarters

just two houses from the JENKINS' residence.

At that time,

JENKINS advised that he knew FRANK DRAGER and related the

following information:

He stated that early in the Spring of 1974 he

saw FRANK DRAGER in a camper truck with Pennsylvania tags

across the street from his residence. DRAGER had spotted him

coming home from school and pulled over to talk to him. DRAGER

had stated that he was wanted by the FBI and needed phoney

identification. JENKINS advised he could not help him and

could not supply any information how he might obtain such.

JENKINS then advised that around the first of June,

1974, he again met DRAGER in the front of his residence and

DRAGER, at that time, was driving a green Ford Pinto believed

to have Florida license plates.

Again DRAGER requested false

identification, and JENKINS advised he could not supply him

with any. JENKINS then noticed his ariver's license was about

to expire and asked DRAGER to take him down to the Department

of Motor Vehicles, Trenton, N.J., where he could obtain a new

license. JENKINS then stated he must have accidently lost

his wallet in DRAGER's car when they were returning from the

Department of Motor Vehicles.

Again DRAGER indicated he was

wanted by the FBI and local police authorities.

He stated

he was only passing through Trenton and was not staying in

DOERFLER advised

he is presently a leading officer of the Bucks County Chapter.

DOERFLER advised that irasmuch as FRANK DRAGER

has appeared ultra-radical in his right wing activities and

has been committing many criminal violations, DOERFLER felt

it was in the best interest of the Klan if they would

separate themselves from any of DRAGER's activities..

On March 12, 1974, DRAGER contacted DOERFLER at

DOERFIER's place of employment, The Pennington Furnace,

Pennington, N.J., and

FERRIS was asked if he had recently had any personal contact

with persons from out-of-town who share his same political beliefs.

FERRIS then volunteered he had seen FRANK DRAGER earlier in June

1974. After DRAGER telephoned him at his home, DRAGER requested and

obtained from FERRIS a list of names and addresses of persons

described by FERRIS as "patriots".

He would not elaborate further

on this but described DRAGER as a worthless "bragger and fink", who

was recently arrested in Illinois and was thereafter released on

personal recognizance whereas ROY FRANKHOUSER, described by FERRIS

as

another patriot, had to post $100,000.00 bond for his release from

jail.

FERRIS stated that DRAGER made no reference to any proposed

distruction of any city on or about July 4, 1974 and FERRIs denied

by DRAGER on March 11, 1974, produced the following type pages
