BLACK PANTHER PARTY
FORMERLY KNOWN AS THE BLACK PANTHER PARTY FOR SELF-DEFENSE
CHARACTERIZATION OF SUBVERSIVE ORGANIZATION
EXTREMIST MATTER - BLACK PANTHER PARTY

The Black Panther Party (BPP), organized in December,
1966, at Oakland, California, by Huey P. Newton and Bobby George
Seale, has the publicly-stated purpose of organizing black
people to take control of the life, polities and destiny of
the black community. The Party, operating the Black Panther
Intercommunal News Service, publishes a newspaper called
"The Black Panther," which at one time openly advocated the
use of guns and guerrilla tactics in a revolutionary program
to end the oppression of the black people but since early
1971 has spoken for a survival program pending revolution.
BPP national headquarters, aka Black Panther Intercom-
munal Headquarters, is located in Oakland, California.

While openly advocating direct overthrow of the
U. S. Government by force and violence until 1971, leaders
have since avoided extreme statements in favor of calling
for action within the established order. Newton, in an
interview appearing in the May, 1973, issue of "Playboy"
magazine, stated the Panthers' chief ambition is to change
the American Government by any means necessary but that
ultimately such change will be through armed violence.

Despite its claimed dedication to community service,
indicators of the BPP's contimued attraction to violence persist,
Since July, 1974, Newton and other BPP members have been arrested
in Oakland, California, for threatening police officers,
murder of a 17-year-old female and the pistol whipping of
Newton's tailor, Newton failed to appear on these charges and
is now a local fugitive. Additionally, one died and three

- were wounded as a result of a shooting at a BPP-sponsored

dance in Oakland, California, in October, 1974,

SECRET ARMY ORGANIZATION

The Secret Army Organization (SAO) was clandestinely
formed during the Fall.of 1971 in Arizona. Membership to date
has been small and it appears to have the same basic terats as.
the Minutemen. In fact, several of those involved in SAO
were formerly active in the Minutemen, The mail drop for
this organization reportedly is in care of an individual in
Ramona, California, who has been involved in Minutemen and
white-hate activities in the past.

This ultraconservative paramilitary organization
was recently invoived in extremist activities in San Diego,
California. Members of this group reportedly made threatening
telephone calls to a local college professor who is active
in a group which plans to organize demonstrations at the
forthcoming Republican National Convention. Following these
telephone calls, a member of SAO fired shots from an auto-
mobile into the professor's home, wounding a guest.

The Alexandria, Virginia Police Department estab-
lished appropriate surveillance at this company, and an un-
known person was seen to cut through the cyclone fence ap~
proximately 7:30 P.M. on March 1, 1969, and thereafter crawl
under the building. An attempt was made by this individual
to saw a hole through the floor of the building, but the
would-be burglay was hampered in his sawing operation by guns
and cases, which obstructed his sawing as well as the cold,
and water under the building. He was seen to depart through
the hole in the fence, which he then temporarily revaired.
He was not successful in gaining access to the building nor
in obtaining any weapons. No arrests were made, hoping that
accomplices would also be involved.

Inspector Johnson advised on March 3 and March 10,
1969 that the police have a "monitoring device" at the build-
ing, which will alert them at the police headquart to any
unusual noises after working hours, inasmuch as they

y have

of information is not a member of the Black Panthers, but
that the source continues to describe the burglars as such.

7 : BLACK PANTHER PARTY

According to its official newspaper, the Black Panther

Party (BPP) was started during December, 1966, in Oakland,
California, to organize plack people so they can take control
of the life, politics, and the destiny of the black community.
It was organized by Bobby George Seale, BPP Chairman, and
Huey P. Newton, BPP Minister of Defense. »- Newton is presently
serving a sentence of 2 to 15 years on a conviction of man--

+ slaughter in conpection with the killing of an Oakland police
officer.

The official newspaper, "The Black Panther", which
further describes itself as the "Black Community News Service,"
states that the BPP advocates the use of guns and guerrilla
tactics in its revolutionary program to end oppression of the
black people. Residents of the black community are urged to
arm themselves against the police who | are consistently re-
ferred to in the publication as "pigs" who should be killed,

“Mme Black Panther" issue of September 7, 1968,
eontains an editorial by EPP Minister of Education, George
Mason Murray, which ends with the following:

"Black men. Black people, colored persons of
America , revolt everywhere! Arm yourselves. The only culture
worth keeping is a revolutionary culture. Change. Freedom
everywhere, Dynamite! Black Power. Use the gun. Kill the
pigs everywhere." ‘

Included in the introduction to'an article appear-
ing in the October 5, 1968, edition of "The Black Panther"
is the statement, "... we will not dissent from American
Government, We will overthrow it.'

Issues of "The Black Panther" regularly contain
quotations from the writings of Chairman MAO Tse~tung of the
People's Republic of China and feature MAO's statement that
"political power grows out of the barrel of a gun."

The national headquarters of the BPP is located
at 3106 Shattuck Avenue, Berkeley, California. Branches have
peen established at various locations throughout the United
States. 7

Detroit Police Department, both having direct interest in
local black nationalist activities and conduct surveillances
in regard to key black nationalist figures in the Detroit
area. Racial informants, who are familiar with the black
nationalist activity in the Detroit area, are contacted often
in regard to an organized BPP in the Detroit area. Contact
with the above sources has revealed that no organized BPP
has been established in the Detroit area wherein the BPP is
holding regular scheduled meetings.

In the event any information is received to show
that a BPP is organized and meeting at a regularly scheduled
time, the Bureau and other appropriate offices will be
properly advised.

“Re: Black Panthér Party .
: Detroit Division

The panelists were introduced by the moderator
‘ Lonnie Peeks with the following titles:

Luke Tripp - Deputy Minister of Information
Leonard Brown - Deputy Minister of Education
Victor Stewart - Deputy Chairman

Marian Kramer - No title

Luke Tripp stated that the Black Panther Party is
not a party that adheres to violence but is geared towards
political education for the black people. Tripp stated that
the Black Panther Party is running Eldridge Cleaver, leader
of the BPP in San Francisco, California, for the presidency
of the United States-in Michigan. Cleaver is being sponsored
by the New Politics Party. Tripp stated that the BPP is not
interested in seeking or getting- votes, rather it is concerned
with presenting its program for revolution to the American
people. Tripp stated that social turmoil as manifested by
George Wallace, youth rebellions and riots in the streets,
can be blamed on power being in the hands of the establishment
and not in the hands of the people where it belongs. Tripp
stated that the black economic, political and social condition .
as opposed to the condition of the whites is far below normal.
The system has as its basis a cast system based on race. It
is the relationship of the oppressor and the oppressed, superior
to the inferior. Tripp stated that socially the black man

7 is unable to control his destiny. School, police and welfare
are all in the hands of the white people and the black people
must grasp for what is left.

wesgee

Tripp further stated the BPP has a ten point program
that is geared towards elevating the black people out of the
slums. He further stated that the BPP in the Detroit area is
in the process of organizing a party and at this point has no
definite meeting place or date. However, any persons interested
in assisting the organization of the BPP in the Detroit area
may do so by contacting Luke Tripp or Leonard Brown.

Re: Black Panther Party
Detroit Division :

Leonard Brown mentioned the fact that the white

. policemen must realize that the black people are not

afraid of them and will defend themselves in any critica:
situation. Brown mentioned the fact that a good example of
the white police officer is the incident that occurred in
New York City where 200 white off-duty policemen attacked
innocent members of the EPP. Brown further stated that the
black political leaders in the country are nothing but
"phonies" and "Uncle Toms". He further stated it is time
for the white power structure to realize that it is impossible
to dictate to the black people as they have been doing for
years and that the black people only want a chance to govern
their community as they see fit.

Victor Stewart stated that the BPP in its useful
state is not an "underground party" but an “above the ground
party". Stewart stated that the only way the black people can
excel or exist if thisworld controlled by the white man is to
take what he wants. Stewart stated that this does not mean
asking or getting on your knees begging the,white power
structure, He further stated that the key tothe black man's
destiny is through black political education classes in
which he will be cognizant of the political structure in this
country. Stewart further stated that the BPP's motto is
"All power to the people; Black power to biack people”.

Marian Kramer, Negro, female, stated that the black
female must awaken and play a vital role in organizing the eee
BPP. She stated for years the black female has been neglected” °
from the political system in our country.

Sources in the Detroit area who are familiar with
the black nationalist movement, stated that they. have no
information at this time that a BPP is organized in the
Detroit area and conducts reqular scheduled meetings. These ~
sources further advised that during other black militant 7
organizational meetings the name Black Panther Party has come
up; however, no significant meaning as to actually being

~i. established in the Detroit area is known.

In March, 1968, the name of the organization was
changed to Black _ Panther Party (BPP).

STUDENT NON-VIOLENT COORDINATING COMMITTEE

The Stydent Non-Violent Coordinating Committee (SNCC),
headquartered at 360-362 Nelson Street, S.W., Atlanta, Georgia,
is a non-membership organization, which was born out of the

sit-in movement that erupted across the €outh beginning in
1960,

Today SNCC identifies itself as an organization in the)
revolutionary vanguard, It advocates that to be successful it

is necessary to develop a revolutionary ideology and revolutionary
program.

‘ According to SNCC, the year 1967 marked a historic
milestone in the struggle for the liberation of black people

in the United States and the year that revolutionaries throughout
the world began to understand more fully the impact of the

black movement. SNCC declared that "liberation will come only
when there is final destruction of this mad octupus--the capitelis-
tic system of the United States with all its life-sucking
tentacles of exploitation and racism that choke the people of
Africa, Asia, and Latin America, The realities of black life,
together with the recognition instilled in SNCC workers forced
its members to further popularize the legitimacy-of self-

defense and rebellious when oppression became too great."

From Nay, 1966, until May, 1967, STOKELY CARMICHAEL
was National Charman of SNCC. 4s of July, 1988, CARNICHAE:
resided in Wehington, D.C., where he was affiliated with
SNCC and active as temporary chairman of a black coalition group.
In May, 1967, CARN{CHAEL was replaced by HUBERT GEROID BROWN,
commonly known as H, RAP BROWN, who served until June, 1968.

In June, 1968, at the Staff and Central Committee
meeting of SNCC held in Atlanta, Georgia, it was decided to
restructure the organization by equalization of responsibility
by creating ten deputy or vice chairmanships. The primary
purpose for this change is to take law enforcement pressure
off any single individual.

article by the then Minister of Education, GEORGE MURRAY.
This article ended with the following:

"Black men. Black people, colored persons of America,
revolt everywhere! Arm yourselves. The only culture
worth keeping is revolu nary culture. Change.
Freedom everywhere. Dynamite! Black power. Use .
the gun. Kill the pigs everywhere."

The BPP newspaper, issue of October 5, 1968, had an
article introduced with the following statement: "We will
not; dissent from American government. We will overthrow it."

- DAVID HILLIARD, Chief of Staff, BPP, in a speech at the
San Francisco Polo Field on November 15, 19 69, said "We wili
kill Richard Nixon."

Hl DAVID HILLIARD, in the "New York Times," issue of
“December 13, 1969, was quoted as follows: "We advocate the

very direct overthrow of the government by way of force
“and violence."

In the issue of April 25, 1970, the BPP newspaper had
an article by Minister of Culture EMORY DOUGLAS as follows:

"The only way to make this racist US government administer
justice to the people it is oppressing, is...by taking

up arms against this government, killing the officials,
until the reactionary forces...are dead and those that
are left turn their weapons on their superiors, thereby
passing revolutionary judgement against the number one
enemy of all mankind, the racist US government:"

The BPP Headquarters is located at 1046 Peralta Street,
Oakland, California. Branches of the BePP, and Committees to
Combat Pascism, under control of the BPF, have been established
sin ‘various locations in the USA, -

--- History of @: Secret Army OrganiMion
CONFIDEND TY,

One early morning in February, 1970, a group of six Minutemen leaders from
four states mot secretly in Northern Arizona to discuss the crisis that the arrest and
imptisonmént of two top M:nutemen leaders and the assassination of a third had
brought on the organization. Although some of these men had met before in their roles
as Minutemen group leaders, others were meeting for the first time.

u
2 After-much discussion, two principal points wefe agreed upon. First, that the
Minutemen as a natidnal coordination organization of militant right-wing groups had
effectively been destroyed by the pro-commuenist elements inside the Justice Depart-

_ment, While individual units still existed throughout the country, few had the financial
support or leadership to be really effective. Second, that the need for such a coordi- ..-

nating organization wasgreater than ever in view ti ‘the increased revolutionary activity

by communists in the United States.

With these two points in mind, suggestions were put forward on a course of
action to be followed. After ‘ameeting that lasted all that day and far info,thé next
morning, an over: all plan of action was finally agreed upon. All pri sent, fb agreed to
merge their individual units together and form a new organization under tie: command

*. of one leader elected from ainong themselves, with the other five to be members of a

General Staff that would advise and assist the new leader.

While retdining the basic programs and policies of the Minutemen, it was
decided that not only should this new organization-have a different name, but also a
completely new chain of command and organizational siructure. If the new organiza~
tion was going to survive the atlacks that befell the old one, a whole new approach
would be needed. Never again could the arrest or death of a few leaders be allowed to
cripple the entire organization. :

For this reason it was decided that only a highly disciplined military type
orgainization with a definite chain ofcommand would have any chance of success. This
then, was the beginning of the Secret Army Organization. Beginning with an original
force of hard corepatriots that numbered fewer than two hundred, the Secret Army
Organization began the job of picking up the pieces and continuing to fight for national
and individual freedom. Using this cadre of dedicated personnel as a nucleus, the
8. A.O. has been recruiting and training new members: in the skills they will need as

.the freedom fighters of tomorrow. Ee

The leaders of the S. A. O, have no idea of fighting a last ditch stand. We have
no desire iocommit suicide ourselves,or to let our members do so, We have a -
strategy which we helieve will ullimately lead to victory. Only one thing is essential.
We must start preparing and training NOW! We of the $. A. O. believe that our country

.'is worthy of any sacrifice. If you fecl the same way, we invite you to join us,

SECRET ARMY ORGANIZATION -
: CONFIDENT TAL
: The Secret Army Organization is the most active, most completely dedicated and _
most selective in its membership of all the many patriotic organizations in America.
We are willihg to make any sacrifice for our country and we fully expect that some of
us will have to make the uliimate sacrifice before victory is achieved. Our very lives
depend on each other. There is no place in this organization for bunglers, playboys or
Jukewarm conservatives. If you join the Secret Army Organization, there might easily
come a time that your life would depend on haw competenuly some other member had

learnéd his job. : 7

Unless you are especially well informed on .the domestic and world political
situation, it is probable that you have a lot to learn about the present threat our nation
faces. Unless you have had many years experience in actual underground warfare,
there is undoubtedly a lot you can learn from the experts in our organization who have
developed and supervised our training program,

OUR NATION [S IN IMMEDIATE DANGER

It is possible that’ within a very few years, ‘perhaps even within months, our
nation could be conquered and. enslaved by the communists, To prevent this we must
know as much as possible about our enemies. Unless we know who they are and what
they are doing we will not succeed in our efforts to maintain a free America.

THE RESISTANCE MOVEMENT

In driving an invader from your land the resistance involved goes through three
stages of development, :

1) The Underground Network
2) Active Guerrilla Warfare
3) Open or Conventional Warfare

The conventional warfare stage uses everything in the way of weapons that the
enemy doés but must also have active guerrillas andunderground agents working against
the enemy, too. In the present state of military tactics conventional warfare cannot
succeed unless these other two ingredients are used simultaneously.

The first step is to form an underground network. An active guerrillasystem
must have the support of an underground network of approximately three times its own
size. This underground must supply the active guerrilla fighter with supplies, con-
cealment, information, etc. Anunderground network starts with departments of
intelligence, security and propaganda in that order,

Sabotage, espionage, subversion” infiltration, escape and evasion, training,
clandestine fabrication of supplies, counterfeiling cnemy documents, recruiting, com-
munications and propaganda are other’ phases of underground activity. Each member
of the Seeret Army Organization, to be effective, must Have a working knowledze of
all these tactics as well as the military tactics more commonly associated with guerril-

la activitic:

a - TAIT S
4 seuea : e ASSIGNMENT TO UNITS e@
: owes

Many people that inquire about membership i in the Secret A Army Organization
seem to have an idea that they will be immediately accepted into an active unit.
Look at it this way. ‘ Suppose you had spent a year or more carefully recruiting and
training until you had a hard hitling team where every individual was reliable, dedi-
cated,, and had confidence in his fellow unit members. Woulda't it make you mad to
have the national or regional organization assign some rank a aimateur to your unit
that you you knew little or nothing about?

Befort any new member is assigned to an active unit or to an important under—
. * ground project, he mustundergo a peried of trainifig. Daring this training he will be
directed through the mails by an experienced member andsome of his activities may
be observed by other members without his knowiedge. Oaly when a new member
proves himself to be conscientions, trustworthy, self-disciplined and able to operate
effectively alone wili he bc acceptedas a "secure member" aud invited to participate

with other unit members in a teamwork operation,

batieattniaesaee

SuaEerastelse ‘most good. things don't come cheap. Although we make every
effort to keep down the expense of membership i in the Secret Army Organization, you
must expect to pay your own way,

Dues to the Secret Army Organization are $3.00 per month. This money is
absolutely necessary for use to maintain our central files and headquarters, for
postage and printing, to finance our extensive intelligence: network, and to maintain
training areas.

Each member will have other expenses depending on the type of activity he is ©
engaged in. Every member will be expected to buy his own gun, ammunition and
other basic combat equipment. During training the new member may be expected to

. buy certain books or subscribe to ceriain magazines that his work requires. Daring
this time the new member wiil also be supplied with reading material on the strategy
and tactics of guerrilla warfare. Tais home work will make it possible for him to
fit in quickly to an active unit and participate effectively in actual maneuvers,
marksmanship training, etc.

Foliowiag this preliminary training a member may be either assigned to an
existing unit, assisted in crganizing his own unit if he has shown sufficient leadership
qualities or become part of an underground network. -

Upon your acceptance into the Seeret Army Organization you will be given a
definite series of projects described jm writing so you will know exactly what will be
expected of you.

¢

‘e hope that you can succeed in this effort because your country ieee aed
needs puttions at this time. 7

AMERICAN NAZI PARTY Bees

OF THE WORLD UNION OF cr

FREE ENTERPRISE NATIONAL ;
SOCTALISTS,, ALSO KNOWN AS THE

GEORGE LINCOLN ROCKWELL PARTY H

In his book "This Time The “yoria", copyrighted in 1961, f
George Lincoln Rqckwell identified himself as Commander, American
Nazi Party of the World Union of Free_ Enterprise National
Socialists (ANP - WUFENS), Arlington, Virginia.

The April 4, 1963, issue of "The Richmond News Leader",
@ Richmond, Virginia, daily newspaper, reported that George, . .._.
Lincoln Rockwell had, on the previous day, again applied for: ‘the
American Nazi Party to be chartered in the State of Virginia, but ...
this request was turned down by the Virginia State Corporation
Commission. This action was taken pursuant to an act of the 1962
Virginia Assembly which prohibits use of "Nazi" or "National
Socialism" in a Virginia charter. This article further pointed
out that Rockwell's Party is presently chartered in the State of
Virginia as the George Lincoln Rockwell Party.

On August 14, :1964, a source advised that the ANP -
WUFENS was organized by George Lincoln Rockwell at his residence
in Arlington, Virginia, on February 26, 1959, as an international | Teo ere
"National Socialist" movement based on the German Nazi Party | woe

headed by Adolf Hitler. He added that Rockwell is the dominant :
force and personality in this party; that he is espousing-a- "Vsnel
of hatred against the Jews and Negroes; and that he is seeking,”
through speeches, distribution of literature and picketing, to
establish a cohesive and dominant political party in the pasted
States and in foreign countries. :

According to the “stormtrooper's Mama", 5 an official
publication of the ANP, the phases of ANP struggle for power are
fourfold, namely, first "to make ourselves known to the masses";
second, "the dissemination of our program and truth about the
Party"; third, "organizing the people who have been converted to
our propaganda"; and fourth, hie attainment of power through the |

. votes. of the newly-won masses" :

i
{

On August 19, 1966, the source advised that George Lincoln
Rockwell presently believes that he has completed the first two :
phases in his struggle for power and is well into the third stage, Gg
to wit, "the organizing of.the people who have been. converted to :
our propaganda". The source added that Rockwell had previously
believed that he would be elected Governor of Virginia in November,
1965, and when.defeated, he made. phe statement that he was not ready
for stage four. 7 7 i

or wall and, once escaping the facilities in this
manner, an automobile could be stopped, a pistol
stuck in the face of the occupant and the occupant
forced ta4 drive BROWN and other members of the group
to any destination in New York. .

JAY STAFFORD advised that BROWN, apparently
in an attempt to impress he and his brother, related
to the fact that if they were interested in involving
themselves in this type of scheme and could "perform"
well, that they would acquire a number of influential
friends and might even be able to see Governor GEORGE
WALLACE. BROWN related to the fact that the STAFFORD
brothers would have no expenses if they involved them=-
selves on the trip to New York City inasmuch as he,
(BROWN) had a number of .friends and associates who
they conld lodge with to and from New York. JAY STATFORD
advised” that BROWN repeatedly referred to the term
"performance" and STAPFORD interpreted the word 7
‘peyformance"™ to mean or identical with pulling off
gome type of job. BROWN related that he had not 'performed"
dn several years and needed to 'perform" at this time
in order to regain influence or re-establish himself

" with prior associates.

: BROWN further briefly discussed religious
philosophies with JAY STAFFORD and his brother, relating
the fact that the Bible had been misinterpreted. BROWN
stated that the Bible referredtooraztiorizes man to
have at least seven wives and also related to the fact
that the destruction of statues in the United Nations
puilding would be accomplished for religious as well
as political reasons.

BROWN then asked of JAY STAFFORD and his
brother, if thoy were. aware of anyone in Kentucky who
could furnish him dynamite. JAY STAFFORD advised that
he might have given BROWN information concerning a
younger brother of a person known to JAY STAFFORD as
GLENN LYNN DEORTING, of Lexington, Kentucky. JAY STAFFORD

advised that he at one time was a fricnd of DEORTIN
“and boligved that. DnCOnTING's' > -younger brother had
expericnde with nitroglycerin and’ had perhaps attempted
. i to, or had,in fact, produced hitrog¥ycerin in the

. garage of BeenTing's'= residence in Lex wington, Kentucky.
STAYFCRD advised he could not say for certain whether
or not he gave GROWN DEORTING's’- name. BROWN dis
cussed the possibility of using dynamite on the

statuc that was in the basement of the United Nations
building.

JAY STAFFORD advised that PRCWN exhibited
a box upstairs at the BROWN residence and this box
contained some bags of white powder. BROWN described
these bags of powder as being ingtedients which were
to be incorporated in a chemical composition, this
composition being capable of producing extremely high.
temperatures if it wag ighited. OWN expressed the
fact that this composition would completely melt any
bronze or steal item and that it would acauire a
temperature of 50,000 degrees. BROWN «stated that
he was expecting a shipment of another ingredicnt
which he did ngt have at the time, and cncd. this
ingredient arrived, he would be able to nanufacture
the heat producing product. JAY STAFFORD advised
that BROW called the name of this ingredient and :
that it either had something to do with, sounded like, |
or incorporated aluminum. .

7 JAY STATTORD stated that BROW iM made a number
of references to "svine pigs", BROWN then asked
JAY STAFFORD and his brother if it wouldn't be more
rewarding to let the "swine pigs" knoy that their days
were numbered than to be rich. BR suggested that
the STAFFORD brothers could involve timscives in
activities that he had in mind, and if they "pexforned"

well, they would not have any noney or other problems. -

, BROWN advised that he was going to plae the
ar explosives at the United Nations building whether or

i not JAY St. CRD and his brother wanted to go along.
BROWN gave the impression that he was comaitted to do
this some time around the first of August. ERG told
the STAFFORD brothers that it would have to be done and

ould do it alone if necessary. BROWN told the
4 ie to some of

remorse’ ‘he ha 3
they | refused to go along with it. GROWN discussed
the fact that he had been charged on a number of counts
in the state of California, but had never been con~
victed. DRUN also alleged that he was using an alias
and that if he used his true nane, he would not be
able to*get enployment. BLOWN also exhibited to th
STAFFORD brothers, a motorcycle magazine, which DOWN *

STAFFORD from the fall of 1973 until approximately

August 1, 1974. USring this visit by BRCWW in the

. fall of 1973, BROW involved LARRY STAFFORD and his

and JAY's feelings or attitudes concerning the

to convince he and his brother, JAY,*to involve then=

. selves in placing explosives in the United Nations

# Building, the STAFFORD brothers* involvenont being that
of causing’ a disturbance while BROWN pinced chemicals
around the base of the devil type statue on the main
Lloor of the United Nations Building. BROWN further
discussed alternative methods of getting into the building,
one of the methods being the uso of an individual in
a wheel chair who would sit on oxplosives to conceal
them. BROWN further discussed the possibility of exiting
out the rear of the United Nations facilities which
BROWN described as being built adjacent to or over a
freeway. LOW disctissed the use of ropes to rappel
walls and the possibility of an escape method wherein
the freeway would be reached, and then a passing motorist
would be 2lagged down. Once the passing motorist stopfed,
a pistol would be shoved in his face and he could be
forced to take an individual or several individuals
anywhere they wanted to go,

LARRY STAFFORD advised that BROWN claimed
that he had contracted to destroy statues at the United
Nations building and that his orders or contract came
from a retired Colonel or General in the Army. BROWN
talked about having $250 expense money which would be
used for the purchase of explosives and travel to and
from New York State. BROWN discussed the fact that
little money was needed inasmuch as he had associates
or fricnds in route to New York, who would provide
food and lodging. :

“LARRY STAFFORD advised that BROWN continued
to use the expression "performance" and advised that
he would travel to New York and complete this contract
assignment whether or not LARRY and his brother partici-
pated. BROWN also discussed the fact that a friend -

RACZAL MATTER ~ HAWAIT

- On November 23, 1964, William File, 634 East Boulder
Street, Colorado Springs, Colorado, advised that his daughter
Irene had been arrested approximately three months ago in Pueblo,
Colorado, on a charge of robbing a filling station. He reported
his daughter had béen placed in the custody of her parents until
such time as there is an additional hearing in the matter.

“While inene was in the Pueblo County Jail she started
receiving letters from Brown, a person whom she has never
personally met File pointed out Irene's picture had appeared
in newspapers after her arrest, and it is possible Brown-may
have gotten her name and address from a newspaper article.

File made available a copy of a letter of November 9,
1964, addressed to his daughter. He advised she is not aware
of the fact he had made such a copy. The letter is quoted as-
follows:

"Nov. 9, 1964
"Dear Irene,

"Looks like my boy Barry sure took a shellacking, doesn't
it? I lost $115 on that clown. Next time I'll back
Robert Shelton (Grand Imperial Wizard of the KKK) or
somebody I can get better odds on, As long as I'm

going to lose I'd like better than 4 to 1 odds like I

got on Goldwater,

"Commander George Lincoln Rockwell (head of the American
Nazi Party) spoke here last week at the university. He
was fabulous! If he's ever in Colorado speaking be sure
to hear him, My little band of extremists and I had
dinner with him and decided to cast our lot with his
movement--the guy really knows some things. Like did you

have been Jews? (Of course, 17 out of 17 members of
the Mafia are italians). Or that Jews yun the NAACP
(PRES: Sidney Fineberg), CORE, etc? Or that three
Russidn Jews own ABC, CBS, and NBC (For a record of
their activities see ‘None Dare Call it Treason ')?

What he said that really hit me between the eyes,
though, was when he referred to the 6 million Jevs
Hitler allegedly gassed: ‘Dont' you think those people
DID something'?

"What really drove his point home to me, however, was a
full page ad in our city newspaper- 'Six Reasons Why
You Should Worry About Extremism' Put out by the National
Council for Civic Responsibility (A very left-wing
outfit). Most of the people listed as directors, etc
of the organization were you~know-what. Seems they're
searec stiff of the John Birch Society, etc., because
they might repeal the income tax and impeach Earl
Warren. it's too bad they didn't mention us Nazis-
we're not going to impeach Earl Warren when Rockwell
gets to be President in '%2. We're going to hang him.

"Sure will be glad when I get back to the states. All

_ the girls over here are a bunch of coon-loving bleeding
_hearts and it makes my Alabama blood boil.

a demand for white men to stand up to the racemixers

I might go with him. Tae way the Negroes are pushing
now we're headed for ea full-scale racial war: I don't

RE: MICHAEL HALSEY BROWN

On January 8, 1965, Mrs. R. 8. Lowrey, 1920 Awapuhi
Street, Honolulu, advised as follows:

Mrs. S. H. Snodgrass, a woman in her early 60's, has
resided next door at 1926 Awapuhi for at least 12 years. Mrs.
Lowrey stated she has no idea of Mrs. Snodgrass! background and

s Goes not know if she is a divorcee or Widow. She related that

. Mrs. Snodgrass lives-a quiet life, has a substantial home, and
enjoys a good reputation in the community. She related that
Mrs, Snodgrass has a divoreed daughter, Mrs. Brown, who is a
local school teacher. Mrs. Brown formerly lived on Cahu Avenue
and her two children, Mike and Leilani, have occasionally

stayed with the grandmother. Mrs. Lowrey stated she believes
Leilani Brown is presently in school in England. Mike Brown,
about 20 years of age, has recently returned to Honolulu to

live with his grandmother. He has been in one of the branches
of the armed services for some three years and is now attending
the University of Hawaii. .Mrs. Lowrey stated Mrs. Snodgrass had
expressed relief that her grandson had enrolled at the university,
explaining that when he had graduated from high school he had
not wanted to go oh with his, schooling.

On January 13, 1965, HN T-1 advised as follows:

Dr. Dorothy Brown has taught in the English Department
of the University of Hawaii at Honolulu for at least 13 years.
She is presently Assistant Professor at the university and
resides in the Kalia Apartments. Mrs. Brown is a divorcee and
has two children, Mike, aged 22, and Leilani, about 17.

During the early 1950's Dorothy Brown resided on
campus with her two children. Mike was a large boy for his
age and his mother found him a difficult problem as far as
discipline was concerned. When he was some 14 years of age
| he was caught burglarizing the ROTC Armory on the campus. The
following year he was sent to Arkansas to live with his maternal
grandfather and finish high school there. Mrs. Brown has
related in the past that Mike is fond of guns and has been a
disciplinary problem and also experienced some trouble in the
Army. Mike returned to Honolulu before the fall semester of
1964 and enrolled at the University of Hawaii as a freshman
intending to major in political science. In late October 1964
the Associated Students of the University of Hawaii sponsored
@ political symposium featuring speakers of diverse political
views including George Lincoln Rockwell, head of the American
Nazi Party, a characterization of which is appended hereto.

APPENDIX
‘RE: MICHAEL HALSEY BROWN
1

AMERICAN NAZI PARTY OF THE WORLD UNION
OF FREE ENTERPRISE NATICNAL SOCIALISTS,
ALSO KNOWN AS THE GEORGE LINCOLN RGCKYELL PARTY

Wn his book, This Time The World, copyrighted in 1961,
3 George Lincoln Rockwell identizied himself as Commander, American
Nazi Party of the World Union of Free Enterprise National
Socialists (ANP - WUFENS), Arlington, Virginia.

The Apz 4, 1863 issue of "The Richmond News Leader,“
a Richmond, Virginia daily newspaper, reported that George
Lincoln Rockwell kad, on the previous day, again applied for
the American Nazi Party to be chartered in the State of
Virginia, but this request was turned down by the Virginia
State Corporation Comaission. This action was taken pursuant
to an act of the 1862 Virginia Assembly which prohibits use. of.
“Nazi or "National Socialism" in a:Virginia charter. This
article further pointed cut that Rockwell's party is presently
chartered in the State of Virginia as the George Lincoln
Rockwell Party. ¢‘ : zt

On August 14, 1964, a source advised that the ANP -
WUFENS was organized by George Lincoin Rockwell at his
residence in Arlington, Virginia, on February 26, 1959, as an
international "National Socialist" movement based on thé German
Nazi Party headed by Adolf Hitler. He added: ‘the & Rockwell is |
the ‘dominant force and personality “in this party; that is
espousing a “line of hatred against the Jews and Negrces;
and that he is seeking, through speeches, distribution of
literature and picketing, to establish a cohesive and dominant
political party in the United States and in foreign countries.

According to the "Stormtrooper's Manual," an official
publication of the ANP, the phases of ANP struggle for power
are fourfold, namely, fir rst "to make ourselves known to the
masses;" second "the dissemination of our program and the
truth about -the Party;" third "crganizing the people who have
been converted to our propaganda;"™ and fourth "the attainment
.o£f power through the votes of the newly-won masses."

extremist organization started in Oakland,
California, in December, 1966. It for-
merly advocated the use of guns and guerrilla
tactics to bring about the overthrow of the
United States Goernment. Since early 1971,
it has preached a policy of "survival

pending revolution".

A, Goals, Guidelines and Objectives

The goals and objectives of the Detroit Chapter
of the BPP remain in accord with those specified by BPP
National Headquarters in Oakland, California. The Party
advocates a non-violent philosophy of .education.of the
black community to the“evils of the oppression and ;
suppression of the poor by a racially oriented society”
The Party has put aside the gun and no longer advocates
the use of guerrilla tactics to change the political
system. An additional goal of the Party is to change
the community image of the Panthers as "thugs dressed
in black".

DE T-1 :
April 27, 1973

It is against the laws of the BPP for members
to carry guns or to use hard drugs.

DE T-2
November 8, 1972

BPP members must dedicate their entire energies
to the furtherance of the programs and philosophies of
the Party and all personal desires must assume a secondary

In a February 2, 1973, article entitled "Black
Panthers Seek to Expand Surviydél Service", which appeared
in the "Michigan Chronicle"y“a weekly black oriented
Detroit newspaper, LEONARD MONGO, a BPP member, was
quoted as saying, "Our goal is not recognition but
service to the people". The article further quoted
MONGO as saying, "Much of our image in the past was
ereated by an unfriendly press. Qur goal continues
to be survival of the people. The people themselves
will determine the approaches to be used in the meantime.
The Black Panther Party makes itself available for
guidance and assistance. Our survival services are
essential to the daily existence of the people,"

2. Communication with BPP National Headquarters

DE T-1 advised on April 27, 1973 that LONNIE
DARDEN, Detroit BPP Minister of Inforfation, received a
telephone call in late April, 1973, from BOBBY SEALE in
California, SEALE reportedly told DARDEN that the Detroit
BPP Chapter has the least number of actively involved
members of all BPP Chapters throughout the country.
SEALE also complained that the Detroit Chapter is operating
only two survival programs (the Free Breakfast Program and
the Free Busing to Prison Program) and warned DARDEN that
the Detroit Chapter will have to take steps to initiate a
substantial number of survival programs to serve the
Detroit Black community as it deserves to be served,

II, MEMBERSHIP -
A. Requirements for Membership

The BPP is constantly attempting to recruit

community workers from the black community to hép in
the operation of the BPP programs. Outsiders, however,
are not trusted by established Party members and community
workers are not allowed inside the Party Office or pad.
They are required to sell BPP newspapers and to perform
various other duties "in the field",

There are also approximately six community workers
who are young high school age blacks who are interested in
the BPP and help sell BPP newspapers and solicit donations
to the Party. They hold no official Party status and ther
interest in the Party's work vacillates and their work is
irregular and inconsistent,

DE T-2

7 The fact that four petrdit Party members are
presently in California, the fact that so many Detroit

An article which appeared in the February 17,
1973, edition of the "Michigan Chronicle" entitled
“Panthers Appeal for Support of Prison Busing Program"
quoted ROLLIN REID, a BPP member as saying "The Community
should do more to support the program, Basicaily we
cannot get more community support because of the old
BPP image of leather coats. and guns, People think we
are thugs."

An article which appeared in the February 27,
1973, edition of the "Detroit News", a daily Detroit
newspaper, entitled "Panthers Appeal for Bus Funds"
quoted LONNIE DARDEN, BPP leader as saying that what
the Panthers are seeking is "a good used vehicle"
which would cost them around $2,500.00, DARDEN stated
that commercial rental costs are too high and that the
BPP funds would not allow the Party to purchase a used
bus even if one were to be found, DARDEN stated that
the Party funds at the present time for the purchase
of a usedbus stand at zero,

An article which appeared in the April 20, 1973,
edition of the "Detroit News" entitled "Panthers Add Trips
to Prison Program" stated that the Panthers are appealing
to Churches and other civic groups for the loan of vans
or busses for their busing to prison services and have
been successful in receiving aid from the Burnette Baptist
Church in Detroit which has offered to make their vans
available.

B, The BPP Free Breakfast and Lunch Programs

The Free Breakfast Program provides fee hot
preakfasts forschool children in the black community
from 7:3 0 to 8:30 a.m, on each school day. The Free
Lunch Program is an alternate program which is run during
the summer months when schools are closed and provides
a free lunch © children who live in the vicinity .of the
BPP Office. The Free Lunch Program was suspended in
September, 1972 and will be reinstituted in June, 1973,

Survival Day refers to a program
implemented by the BPP with purpose
of giving away bags of groceries to
oppressed families living iin the inner
city of Detroit. :

Due to the great expense of purchasing the necessary
large quantities of groceries for Survival Day Programs,
the Party has not held a Free Food Giveaway in the past
three months,

DE T-1
April 27, 1973

D. Political Education Classes

Rlitical Education classes are no longer held
on a régular basis, The classes are held occasionally
during the week as the Party feels it is more beneficial
to personally come into contact with members of the black
community on a one-to-one basis. For this reason, Party
members solicit donations and sell BPP newspapers door to
door and attempt to "rap" with the people concerning the
BPP, its aims and programs.

DE T-2
April 3, 1973

For example, DE T-2 advised on January 30, 1973
that a Political Education class was conducted by ALVIN
BROWN, BPP Member at the 157 Collingwood Office on
January 29, 1973, The class was entitled "Liberalism
in the Red Book of Chairman Mao", Only three non-Party
members were in attendance.

In order to establish a better rapport with the
members of the black community and in order to raise money
for the Party, the Party organized and sponsored the

DE 157-3075

On December 20, 1972, LONNIE DARDEN, BPP-NF
leader at Detroit, was interviewed under suitable pretext
by a Special Agent of the FBI and DARDEN made the following
statement regarding ELDRIDGE CLEAVER:

"Eldridge Cleaver will not be allowed back

q in the BPP, We're (BPP-NF) not saying that
there is a peaceful co-existence that will
exist between the BPP and Eldridge Cleaver,
We're saying that the court systems are
responsible for the execution of poor and
oppressed people and we in -turn are exposing
the court system in this particular racist
attitude against poor and oppressed people
and not trying to build a peaceful co-existence
with a particular element that had defected
from the Party."

VII. BPP FUNDS

situation of the BPP provided:by DE T-1 and DE T42

VIII, MISCELLANEOUS

In a December 21, 1972 edition of the "Detroit
Free Press", a Detroit daily newspaper, an article appeared
entitled "Black Panthers Charge Police with Harassment",
LONNIE DARDEN, BPP leader, charged the Detroit Police
Department with harassing Panthers while they were selling
the Party newspaper at the corner of State and Woodward
in Detroit. DARDEN charged that Party members had been
ticketed more than 25 times in the past. year for loitering
and interfering with pedestrian traffic. DARDEN went on
to state that members of the Party are being harassed
because they are black, DARDEN stated that the police
are attempting to stop the selling of the Party newspaper
because the BPP is involved in various programs to
serve the people of the community.

DE T-1 advised on April 27, 1973, that the BPP's
lease on 2228 Bewick expires on September 15, 1973, and
that the Panthers must vacate the premises on or before
that date. Source further advised that LONNIE DARDEN

F. Philosophy of the BPP
i: In explaining the new Panther image, GERALD
“CRAWFORD stated, “For tco long the Panther Party has found
itself in the role of defender, rather than educator of
the community. We feel the Party should be a vehicle to.
take the community to liberation and not the force which
consistentiy finds itself in conflict with the Police.

We are now moving toward the role of humanitarians, and
our goal is humanization of all mankind. We would like

to remove all racial and class barriers, Our struggle is
more a Class struggle -- rather than a racial one, and
our role is to educate the community to that fact. We
are not trying to teach individuals what to think, but
instead, we are trying to teach them to think for
themselves and objectively analyze the situation we find
ourselves in.

"Ironically, those people who can best pi orm
this service turn their backs on the community and help
those forces which are oppres all of us. College
students today dnot br t
community, but help to build the
suffered under. In order for us to successfull
our duty, we need the support of the community.
Panthers are a part of the community and need its entire
support. Without this support, we will be unable to
continue our fight against oppression.

Party
and
biuipebgife

has found itself on the covers of na
in newspapers. Reporters have describe
as Communists and revolutionaries: But
this description is not applicable to podeycs Black

Party. In the past ¢ years, the Pant
undergone drastic cha Ss. Black Panther mem
to drop the role of guerilla fighters and are ;
effort into being known as educators and huma

"The Party's Detroit Ch
hard to change its image from Conant ty boaygua a to community

THE RIFLE: The bolt-action rifle in
330-05 or .308 (7.62 Mi Nato) with a four

weapon. A opecialist piece. Thié!
(deadly) combination is for one
purpose, and ome purpose only~to fire CUB
well placed shot, So cach self-defense unit
1 needs only one such weapon at this tine.
There is nothing else to say about that.

The assault rifle is. either semi-
automatic or preferable one that can be
fired either semi-automatic or fully auto-
matic. The limit kere is that posed by the

beaten by the pigs. People in the crowd that had formed came to the

G. Locally Stated Aims and Policy .

LARRY POWELL, member of the Detroit KRCCF, conéucted
the political education classes on July 5, 1970, at which time
the topic of discussion was the center page of the July 4,
1970, issue of "The Black Panther" newsoaper. Those in
attendance were instructed as follows:

Whenever you say "death to the pigs" mean it.
Put your words into action. Use the slogan "all power to
the people" as the pigs think they are the power. ‘Now we
have to add to our slogan "death to the pigs," so stop
talking and start putting your words into action. The pigs
are planning genocide against us. The reason there are more
pigs in the community this year than last year is because
they are planning to get rid of all blacks, and they want all
blacks to move into the projects so all they would have to
do is put a fence around it and give them just enough money
to get food. They want to take everything away from us, but
we still have the power to destroy and there is no way the
pigs can destroy the BPP. If they kill us off, our struggle
will be taken up by the people in the community as we are
the people's party. If we don't go to the people then we
are not serving the people. Our struggle is not confined
and exists also in the South in the field of Civil Rights.
We have to fight for national salvation, deal with repression
and will fight for the liberation of all oppressed peoples.

7 fhe Association of Black Students, Oakland
University, Rochester, Michigan, sponsored a rally in
support of the Detroit 16 on November 16, 1970, featuring
HUEY P. NEWTON.

r The main theme of the speech given by HUEY P.
NEWTON on November 16, 1970, at Oakland University, was that
all. poor blacks and poor whites, the working classes, the
oppressed of the world, must all join forces as a united
body against the "ruling circle" in the United States.
NEWTON repeatedly referred .to this "ruling circle” through~
out his entire speech and apparently interpreted this "ruling
circle" as those leaders of Government and industry, the
imperialists or those who are rich in this society. NEWTON
wanted egnality for everyone with no one being superior to
his fellow man. He indicated the Negro is a class brother
with the poor whites and they must join in their effort to
overcome the "ruling circle." . 7

: NEWTON stated,"The Black Panther Party is the
vanguard of the revolution on a world-wide level because the
world is really one community and we've taken’ Marxist-Leninist
to a greater level-and, therefore, we are the greatest
Marxist-Leninists that ever lived, .and we say this not to
be arrogant because some times I wish that someone else
would carry that banner because the way is narrow and the
burden is heavy."

In conclusion, the speech by NEWTON was a rambling,
many times incoherent Marxist-Leninist influenced, low-key
revolutionary type speech which attenpted to show a connection

. between the SPP and the League of Revolutionary Black Workers
(LRBY), as well as a unity between the BPP and all oppressed
persons of the world.

A characterization of the LRBW is contained
in the appendix pages attached hereto.

His speech called for the release of the Detroit 16,
freedom for ANGE. DAVIS, BOBBY SEALE, and all the oppressed
brothers and for the ultimate overthrow of the pigs.

and NEWTON was easily diverted from the main topics which 7
he seemed to be pursuing. The speech had very few references
to any actual radical ection. or violent confrontation. i

The Black Student Union, University of Michigan,
Ann Arbor, Michigan, sponsored a rally in support of the
| Detroit 16 on November 17, 1970, featuring HUEY NEWTON.

NEWTON stated that the working class will be the
ones to carry out the *revolution® and carry the "revolution
banner" and will most likely initiate the creation of the
new order, Throughout his speech} NEWTON talked about the
| new order which will occur when.the world is taken over by
Communism, Throughout the speecli, NEWTON refers to capitalism
stating that while it has caused many problems, it has also :
haid the foundation for Communism. He stated that the
wealthy are the ruling circle and named RCCKEFELLER and FORD
as being in this circle. NEWTON stated that they offered
troops to the Vietnamese people, however, aid not get a
definite answer on their proposal.

A source advised on April 22, 1970, that the
League of Revolutionary Black Workers (LRBW) is a black
extremist labor union, with headquarters at 179 Cortland,
Highland Park, Michigan, in the greater Detroit metropolitan
area. Source advised that the LRBW is attempting to oust
the United Auto Workers (UAW) from their position as
bargaining representative for black workers in the Detroit
area automotive plants. Source advised that the LRBW has
used threats of violence against both black and white
supervisory personnel and UAW leaders in an attempt to
intimidate them into an agreement with LRBW demands. The
LRBW has referred to the automotive industry and the UAW
as "racist".

A second source advised that membership in the
LRBW is limited to Negroes only, by virtue of the LRBW
constitution which states "membership is denied to all -
honkies due to the fact that said honkey has been the
historic enemy, betrayer and exploiter of black people."
Membership in the LRBW is less than 25 persons. eo

The second source also stated that.the LRBW had”
suborganizations operating at Ford Motor Company which was
known as the Ford Revolutionary Union Movement (FRUM) and
Eldon Avenue Gear and Axle Plant (ELRUM) as well as other
assembling and supplying plants, but that at the present the
LRBW is active only at the Dodge Main Assembly Plant in
Haiatramck, Michigan. This suborganization is known as
Dodge Revolutionary Union Movement (DRUM) « The other
suborganizations are now defunct.

"INNER CITY VOICE"

fhe "Inner City Voice" (ICV) was registered
with the Wayne County Clerk's Office, Assumed Names Division
on August 4, 1967, by KENNETH JOHN WATSON, whder Certificate
; Number 208945,

A bulletin entitled, "Build Black Newspaper"
dated July, 1967, stated, "A group of black revolutionaries’
in Detroit, Michigan, have begun work on the production of
anew newspaper. It is hoped that the first edition of the
‘Inner City Voice', will appear on the newsstand in August
of 1967." According to the bulletin, the ICV's goal is the
building of a mass circulating revolutionary propaganda
program. The bulletin stated the newspaper was to concentrate
on local news, cultural and social events, as well as providing
coverage of radical politics.

A source advised on March 17, 1970, that the IcV
was published from July of 1967 through June of 1968, when
it was terminated. In the fall of 1969 a newspaper similar
to ICV appeared on Detroit newsstands which was called
"SAUTI", meaning Voice in Swahili. ‘This publication, in its
first edition stated that it emerged from the ICV, and its
purpose, in addition to the above, would be to exist as the
official organ of the League of Revolutionary Black Workers
(LRBW). In January of 1970, an edition of "SAUTI" stated
that it would continue publication under the old name of
"Inner City Voice" and would provide coverage of the black
extremist labor movement. In the spring of 1970, the Icv did
not publish the inflammatory articles which were common in
1967-68, but called for the overthrow of the United Auto
Workers (UAW) leadership and control of black workers at
Detroit area auto plants. i"

Source advised that the editors of the ICV are
KENNETH JOHN WATSON, LUKE SAMUEL TRIPP, GENERAL GORDON BAKER,
MICHAEL C. HAMLIN and RONALD LEE MARCH, all of whom source
identified as members of the Central Committee of the LRBW.

CUTTY re

.BLACK PANTHER PARTY (BPF
lso known as

oes Black Panther Party for Self Defense

According to the official newspaper of the’ BPP, the BPP
was started during December, 1966, in Oakland, California, to
organize black people so they can take control of the life,

7 + politics, and the destiny of the black community. It was
~ “organized by BOBBY G. SEALE, BPF Chairman, and HUEY P. NEWTON,
Minister of Defense, BPP.

The official newspaper, -called "The Black Panther,"
‘xegularly states that the BPP advocates the use of guns and
guerrilla tactics in its revolutionary program to end oppression
of the black people. Residents of the black community are
urged to arm themselves against the police who are consistently
referred to as "pigs" who sane tea be killed.

The newspaper, in its issue of September 7, 1968, had an
article by the then Minister of Education, GEORGE MURRAY.
This article ended with the following:

"Black men. Black people, colored persons of America,
revolt everywhere! Arm yourselves. The only culture
worth keeping is revolutionary culture. Change.
Freedom everywhere. Dynemite! Black power. Use

+ the gun. Kill the pigs everywhere." .

The BPP newspaper, issue of October 5, 1968, had an
article introduced with the following statement: "We will
not dissent from American government. We will overthrow it."

DAVID HILLIARD, Chief of Staff, BPP, in a speech at the
San Francisco Polo Field on November 15, 1969, said "We will
kill Richard Nixon."

DAVID HILLIARD, in the "New York Times," issue of
“December 13, 1969, was quoted as follows: "We advocate the
very direct overthrow of the government by way of force
and violence."

In the issue of April 25, 1970, the BPP newspaper hed
an article by Minister of Culture EMORY DOUGLAS as follows:

"The only way to make this racist US government administer
justice to the people it is oppressing, is...by taking

up arms against this government, killing the officials,-
until the reactionary forces...are deed and these. that’
are left turn their weabons on their superiors, thereby
passing revolutionary judgement against the number one
enemy of all mankind, the racist US government."

The BPP Headguarters is located at 1046 Peralta Street,
Oakland, California. Branches of the BPP, and Committees to
Combat Fascism, unéer control of the BPP, have been established
in various locations in the USA. .

Spare eet tceeeeritecite : BLACK PANTHER PARTY (BPP). . an neeee
ee : : so known as
Black Panthe

Party for suf Defense

_ According to the official newspaper of the’ BPP, the BPP
was started during December, 1966, in Oakland, California, to
organize black people so they can take control of the life,
politics, and the destiny of the black community. It was
organized by BOBBY G. SEALE, BPP Chairman, and HUEY P. NEWTON,
Minister of Defense, BPP.

The official newspaper, called "The Black Panther,"
regularly states that the BPP advocates the use of guns and
guerrilla tactics in its revolutionary program to end oppression
of the black people. Residents of. the black community are
urged to arm themselves against the police who are consistently
referred to as "pigs" who should be killed.

The newspaper, in its issue of September 7, 1968, had an
“article by the then Minister of Education, GEORGE MURRAY.
This article ended with the following:

"Black men. Black people, colored persons of America,
revolt everywhere! Arm yourselves. The only culture
worth keeping is revolutionary culture. Change.
Freedom everywhere. Dynamite! Black power. Use
the gun. xXill the pigs everywhere." :

The BPP newspaper, issue of October 5, 1968, had an
article introduced with the following statement: "We will
not dissent from American government. We will overthrow it."

DAVID HILLIARD, Chief of Staff, BPP, in a speech at the
San Francisco Polo Field on November 15, 1969, said "We will
kill Richard Wixon.”

DAVID HILLIARD, in the "New York Times," issue of
“December 13, 1969, was quoted as follows: "We advocate the
very direct overthrow of the government by way of force
and violence."

In the issue of April 25, 1970,. the BPP newspaper had
an article by Minister of Culture EMORY DOUGLAS as follows:

"The only way to make this racist US government administer
justice to the people it is oppressing, is...by taking

up arms against this government, killing the officials,
until the reactionary forces,..are dea@ and those that7™
are left turn their weapons on their superiors, thereby
passing revolutionary judgement against the number one
enemy of all mankind, the racist US -government."

The BPP Headquarters is located at 1046 Peralta Street,
Oakland, California. Branches of the BRP, and Committees to
Combat Fascism, under control of the BYf, have been established
in various locations in the USA. .

On December 2, 1970, Detective WILLIAM HENMAHAN,
Security Section, Intelligence Division, Detroit Police
Department, advised that he was contacted by the Detroit Edison
Electric Company, and advised that a crew from the ectric
company went out to check the meter at 611 Continental,
Detroit, an NCCF office, which is on the rear of the house,
since a request for service had not been received, and found
thet the meter had been jumped. They were going to disconnect
the electricity at the meter but were chased away by occupants
of the house. The electric company is\not going to cut the
wire at the pole as they consider it too dangerous and are
going to let the NCCF have the electricity.

The Flint Chapter of the Detroit NCCF has begun
work on fortifying the house at 2009 Albert, Flint, Michigan,
by placing plywood a few inches from the wall, which they
then plan to fill with sand.

a i BLACK PANTHER PARTY (BPP).
. ‘ so known as 7 .
Jack Panther Party for Seff£ Defense

According to the official newspaper of the BPP, the BPP
was started during December, 1966, in Oakland, California, to
organize black people so they can take control of the life,
politics, and the destiny of the black community. It was .
organized by BOBBY G. SEALE, BPP Chairman, and HUEY P. NEWTON,
Minister of Defense, BPP.

The official newspaper, called "The Black Panther,"
regularly states that the BPP advocates the use of guns and
guerrilla tactics in its revolutionary program to end oppression,
of the black people. Residents of the black community are
urged to arm themselves against the police who are consistently
referred to as "pigs" who should be killed.

The newspaper, in its issue of September 7, 1968, had an
article by the then Minister of Education, GEORGE MURRAY.
This article ended with the following:

"Black men. Black people, colored persons of America,
revolt everywhere! Arm yourselves. The only culture
worth keeping is revolutionary culture. Change. a
Freedom everywhere. Dynamite! Black power. Use

the gun. Kill the pigs everywhere."

The BPP newspaper, issue of October 5, 1968, had an
article introduced with the following statement: "We will
not Gissent from American government. We will overthrow it."

DAVID HILLIARD, Chief of Staff, BPP, in a speech at the
San Francisco Polo Field on November 15, 1969, said "We will
kill Richard Nixon." : 4 “

DAVID HILLIARD, in the "New York Times," issue of
“December 13, 1969, was quoted as follows: "We advocate the
very direct overthrow of the government by way of force
and violence." :

In the issue of April 25, 1970,. the BPP newspaper hed
an article by Minister of Culture EMORY DOUGLAS as follows:

"The only way to make this racist US government administer
justice to the people it is oppressing, is...by taking

up arms against this govetnment, killing the officials,
until the reactionary forces...are dead and those thet ~
are left turn their weapons on their superiors, thereby
passing revolutionary judgement against the number one
enemy of all mankind, the racist US government."

The BPP Headguarters is located at 1046 Peralta Street,
Oakland, California. Branches of the BPP, and Committees to
Combat Fascism, under control of the BPF, have been established
in various locations in the USA. - id :

HUEY P. NEVTCU.

HUEY P. "oH is the Minister of
Defense, BPP,

The main theme of the speech given by HUEY P
NEWTON on November 16, 1970, at Oakland University, was that
all poor blacks and poor whites, the wo nig Glasscs, the
oppressed of the world, must all join forces as a united
body against the "ruling circle" in the United States.
NEWION repeacedly referred to this “ruling cirecl through
out his entire speech and apparently interpreted is "ruling
circle" as those leaders of Government and indust
imperialists or those who are rich in this society. 8
wanted equality for everyone with no one being superior to
his fellow man. He indicated the Negro is a class brother
with the poor whites and-they must join in their effort to
overcome the "ruling circle."

Feet NEWTON stated, "The Black Panther Party is the
vanguard of the revolution on a world-wide level because the
world is really one community and we've taken Marxist-Leninist
to a greater level and, therefore, we are the gr tc
Marxist-Leninists that ever lived, and we say this not to

be arrogent because some times I wish that scmeone else

would carry that banner because the way is narrow and the
burden is heavy."

q In conclusion, the speech by NEWTON was a rambling,
many tires inccherent Marxist-Leninist influenced, low-key
revolutionary type speech which attempted to show a connection
between the BRP and the League of Revolutionary 3) Ter
(LRBHW), as ll as a unity between the BPP and all OD:
persons of the world.

Who Ar The Bl ack Panthers?

Yhe 10 point program of the Black Panthers Party begins “We want our freedom.
Wy want power to determine ‘the destiny of our black community." The Black

a community of people with their om history, economic life, and culture. Yev

hy’ stormed to fight for this political power.

_ But the founders of the Black Panther Party, led by Huey P. Newton, knew
vaat they had to have more than their goals. They had to understand how they
mere going to echieve them. Huey‘s answer was "Serve the People" and "Pick up
.the gun."| The Black Penthers realized that the people can be liberated only

‘by their own efforts, and that the P. ers. nad to reach out to their appareils

the Panthers started many health clinics, Beer ee for children programs, and

proceed to analyze the present comlition of this

The Fedayeen vangusrds of tho Palestinian
people who began thoir commando activities against
the enemy on January 1, 1965, wore, ard still are
fully aware of the difficulties that lie ahead of
them _on their road to revolution and freeion,

the Revolution, for the organic devalorment of the

turn, should unite with the Arab masses, for then
and only then will the Ravolution come inte its own
as a revolution that is Palestinian in ineeptian,
Arab in depth, camble of effective action and con=

ADDRESS BY THE AL-RATEH DELEGATION TO THE .
SECOND INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE IN SUPPORT
OF THE ARAB PEOPLES

Cairo, January 1969

Friends,
In the name of the people of Palestine, in the name of the

’ Palestinian Revolution, in the name of Justice and Peace for

which we fight, we thank you for your con and the concern”
of your people in Justice and Peace in cur part of the world.

We are very happy to have the opportunity to meet with you
because you represent people who fought for peace based on jus!

We can s among you people who fought the Nazi by
and the fascist terror in Europe.

We also find among you people who fought, and are still
fighting, impevialism and colonialism and racial discrimination
in Africa, Asia and Latin America.

We honestly fecl’that we stand among fricnds and comrades
who believe in the right of every people to self-determin
its right to enjoy liberty on its own land, free of oppr
discrimination.

ee

Our people were deprived of their rights to self-determination
and to the enjoyment of lif on their own land without oppression.
This was the result of a serious racist aggression carricd out. by
“AOVUSM.

The aggression of the 5th of June is one manifestation of this
basic aggression that had its roots in the 19th century, and whose
culmination was the cstablishment of the State of Isracl in 1948.

» “The major victim of this aggression was the Arab Palestinian people

who were forced to cvacuate their homes and land ail a reign
of terror and oppression.
We therefore refuse to consider the 1967 ene as a

separate and distinct phenomenon, and we refuse to accept any

solution focussed on the results of the last aggression without .

considering the source of the aggression itself,

The Resolution of the Security Council, November 22nd 1967,
and all further proposals explaining or modifyingit, are inadequate
and irrelevant from yur point of view, and thercfore are totally
and categorically unacceptable to us.

All such proposals skirt the reat issue and avoid its core,
namely: the right of the Palestinians to Hberate their country, to
enjoygm 2d and homes, and to have the right to decide how they
want WPrun.it. :

We, the people of Palestine, are carrying on an armed revolu-
tion in order to re-establish peace with justice in the Holy Land.

koe uk

We would like you to consider the magnitude of our problem.
For ‘we are facing a Zionist structure that had, its roots in 19th
century Europe, at the heart of the imperialist movement. Zionism
is onc of the most oppressive and aggressive forrns of imperialism,
one that has as its major goal the total uprooting of one people
from a country to replace them by another.

The roots of the aggression lic in the Zionist ideology itself,
with its belief in the need to bring a select, chosen people without
a land, to a land that is to be evacuated by its inferior people.

. methods used to accomplish this objective are terror,
oppra™ and deceit.

Let me quote one of the original Jewish pionccrs in Palestine,
Nathan’ ChoShi, who wrote to the editor of the Jewish Newslelter
in February 1959:

. “Ti you really wanted to know what happened, we old Jewish
settler in Palestine who wiinessed the fight could tell you how
and in what manner we Jews forced the Arabs to leave cities

and ‘villages...Some of them were driven out by force of arms;
otherr were nade to leave by deccit, lying and false promises,
Ttdserei ch to cite cue citics cf Jaffa, Lydda, Ramich, Beer Sheba,
and «

feors -g nunycer.css others.” Nathan ChofShi conti-
2 peczde wao lived on its own land for 1,300

ud turned the ypive Arabs into tragic refugees.

alien then:, to besmirch their °

dress by an al-Fatth De

name. Instead of being deeply ashamed of what we did ana of
¢ te undo some of the evil we committed, by helping thes:
unfortunate refugees, we justify our terrible acts and even attempt
to glorify them.” .

* Professor Erich Fromm, the noted Jewish writer and thinker,
had this to add: “It is often said that the Arabs fled, that they left
the country voluntarily, ahd that they therefore bear the responsi-
bility for losing their property and their land. But, in genera
international law, the principle holds true that no citizen Joses hi.
property or his rights of citizenship, and the citizenship right is i.

e

de facto right to which the Arabs in Palestine have much more ‘ -

legitimacy than the Jews. Just because the Arabs fled? ? Professor
Fromm asks. “Since when is that punishable by confiscation of
property and by being barred from returning to the land on which
a people’s forefethers have Hved for generations? The claim of
the Jews to the land of Israel cannot be a realistic political claim.
if all nations would suddenly claim territories in which their
forefathers have lived two thousand years ago this world would
be a machouse.”

“ee

The Zionists went ahead coldbloodedly with thei¢ sinister
scheme to vacate Palestine of its people, by the use ef terror,
massacres and frightening numors. . ,

Arthur Koestler, the pro-Zionist author, described what
happened at Deir Yassin on April 9th, 1948, as the “blood bath
that was the psychologically decisive factor in the Arabs’
spectacular exodus.”

On that day, the Zionist terrorist organization Irgun Zvei
Leumi killed 250 men, women and children. After 1948 there
were other mass killings in occuped Palestine, e.g. Ikrit (1951), Al
Tira (1953), Abu Ghosh (1953), Kaft Kagsem (1956), etc., as
part of the systematic Zionist plan for the complete evacuation
ef the Palestinians, to be replaced by Jewish settlers from all
over the world. .

These were the conditions that forced ‘the Palestinians to leave
their horncland. :

The Zionists did not'come to 4 country without people. There
lived in Palestine a people with a civilization. They reacied to the

and competed with the Zionists in the fields of raanagement,
finance and technology. , ;

With all their efforts, by 1947 the Zionisis had only been
able to acquire 5.6% of the total area of Palestine. However, the
1947 U.N. resolution for partition allowed them 56% of Palestine,
and by terror and aggression they went on to cccupy 80% in
1948. Today, after the June 5 1967 aggression, the rest o° our

For twenty years, the Palestinians were the victims of world
procrastination. While many resolutions were passed in the United
Nations, the Israclis continued to occupy more and rnore territory
while the world remained indifferent. Under such conditions, the
only alternative Jeft to the Palestinians was armed revolution. .

Tam sure that the facis of the case are very clear to you. You
Ze the conditions under which our people have suffered,
ts years most of the s have lived in a diaspora
onts, misery and the mumillation of a meager dole. In
this schizophrenic world of uit the rights of Afficsns, Asians and
Polynesi:,.3 were recognized and espoused, while Palestinian rights

were diss, wded and forgotten. Not even the tragedy of the heroic
Angol.ns, South Africans and Zimbabwans equalled theirs. For,
alor yg these oppressed peopie, the Palestinians were totally
uprooted from their land and completely denied the right to live
on it andjenjoy its fruits.
Cur ‘people have risen to arms because all other means have
been exhausted. We refuse to accept misery and diaspora as our
_fate, and ‘We refuse charity and compromise as solutions to our
problem. We shall overcome: through a long-terin liberation
‘yevolution to destroy the bases of colonialist aggression that frustrate
-the exercise of our inalienable rights, and to bring an ond to the
racist militarist regime that oppresses our people, We, will fight so
that peace with justice is restored to our land.

rusty weapons and against heavy odds, our youth embarked on
the revolution with all che determination and persistence of 2 long-
oppressed people. Now as we embark on our fifth year of struggle,
the feulis of our sacrifices ave begining to show. The Palestine
Liberation Movement b2s succeeded in awakening our people,
in rekindling is hope for a better future with dignity and respect
in our own land. We are forcing the encmics of peace to admit
their failure to extinguish our revolution, we are winning battles,
and we are starting to shape our destiny..We are not swayed by
ernotional appeals, we are not seckers of revenge, we are not
bloodthirsty terrorists. We are freedom fighters with clear and
mature goals, We are fighting today to create the new Palestine
of tomorrow: A progressive, democratic, secular Palestine in
which Christian, Moslem and Jew will worship, work, live peacefully
and enjoy equal rights, This is no utopian dream or false promise,
for we have always lived in peace, Moslerns, Christians and Jews
in the Holy Land. The Palestinian Arabs gave a refuge, a warm
shelter and a helping hand to Jews fleeing persecution in Christian
Europe and to the Armenians flecing persecution in Moslem
Turkey, as well as to Greeks, Circassians and Maltese among others.
Our Palestinian revolution still stretches its welcoming hand
to all human beings who want to fight for, and live in, 2 democ-
ratic, tolerant Palestine, irrespective of race, color or religion.
During the last four years, some 500 of our people have given

their lives on the battlefield. During the same period many mere

than that have died in refugee camps from bitter cold, poor nourish-
ment and disease.

We are here to assert to you, and to ask you to confirm to
your people, that our people will not lay down their arms until
Palestine is liberated and our rights restored. We will not accept
any ‘settlement that denies us these rights, be it the Security
Council’s resolution, or any other proposal or political settlement
ensuing from it. We will not accept any substitute to a war
of national Hberation and will tenaciously hold to it regardless of
sacrifices and costs. Could anybody have asked you to accept
anything less than total freedom from Nazism, fascism or colonia-
lism? We are confident the people of the world will back our
struggle and will support our revolution, for it is the struggle of
man to achieve the loftiest of man’s values: neace and justi:

League of Revolutionary Black Workers (LRBW) is a black
extremist labor union, with headquarters at 179 Cortland,
Highland Park, Michigan, in the greater Detroit metropolitan
area. Source advised that the LRBW is attempting to oust
the United Auto Workers (UAW) from their position as
bargaining representative for black workers in the Detroit
area automotive plants. Source advised that the LRBW has
used threats of violence against both black and white
supervisory personnel and UAW leaders in an attempt to
intimidate them into an agreement with LRBW demands. Prting
LRBW has referred to the automotive industry and the UAW
cas "racist"

A second source advised that membership in the
LRBW is limited to Negroes on aly, by virtue of the LRBW
constitution which states “membership is denied to all
honkies due to the fact that said honkey has been the
historic enemy, betrayer and exploiter of black people.
Membership in the LRBW is less than 25 persons.

The second source also stated that the LRBW had
suborganizations operating at Ford Motor Company which was
known as the Ford Revolutionary Union Movement (FRUM) and
Eldon Avenue Gear and Axle Plant (ELRUM) as well as other
assembling and supplying plants, but that at the present the
LREW is active oniy at the Dodge Main Assembly Plant in
Hamtramck, Michigan. This suborganization is known as
Dodge Revolutionary Union Movement’ (DRUM). The other
suborganizations are now defunct.

E. Summary of Overall Activities

i
On May 5, 1971, it was reported that JERRY LYNN
DAVIS was continually talking about the plans he was making {
to start a new organization. According to DAVIS, he |
considered the MM organization to be defumct, at least

in the San Diego area and-in most of the Western states, I
and felt.the need to organize a new Right Wing group to |
fill the”power vacuum which it had left. He indicated that
he knew people in‘Phoenix, Arizona; Portland, Oregon; Seattle, t
Washington, and Las Vegas, Nevada, who he wanted to context iq
regarding such an organization, feeling that they would be i
highly interested in helping to organize and get it going. i
He said his plans included having Post Office boxes rented I
for the new organization in all these cities and having i
leaflets and stickers regarding the organization printed H
using the respective Post Office box numbers. On a pre-determined 4
day, press releases would be made in each of these cities |
announcing the formation of the organization with the leaflets :
and stickers being put up in the cities on the same day. i
This would be done for the purpose of disguising the location
of the national headquarters, which would be actually located
in San Diego, California.

(SD T-1, May 5, 1971)

On September 13, 1971, it was reported that DAVIS
had become very interested in the National Socialist White
Peoples Party (NSWPP) as a possible answer to the need fora ~-

Right Wing group in the San Diego area. He was reportedly
studying that organization and considering becoming a
member, .

i (SD T-2, September 13, 1971)

- The Natiorial Socialist White Peoples Party,
also known as The American Nagi Party,
American Nazis, and The George Lincoln
Rockwell Party, was organized on February 26,
1956, at Arlington, Virginia, based upon
the concept of an international "National Socialist"
movement as espoused by the German Nazi Party
headed by Adolf Hitler. The organization supports
and follows the line of hatred against Negroes,
Jews, and communists through various propaganda
media seeking a legitimate dominant political
party in the United States and foreign countries.
napa: cit
On September id. 1971, it was reported that,
while very interested in the NSWPP, DAVIS was still considering
going ahead with plans for the new organization. In addition,
DAVIS indicated that he expected to obtain membership lists
and the necesary materials for setting up application forms,
bulletins and tfaining literature for the new organization
from BETPTE HAUGHTON, wife of TROY-HAUGHTON. DAVIS said

“he would attempt to have the biilletins, training materials,

and membership application forms printed in the near future
and that, tentatively, the responsibility for making the

monthly mail-outs would alternate between DAVIS and GODFREY.
DAVIS advised that 0...A,<ALEXANDER of Alex Rapid Print, 7609
El Cajon Boulevard, La Mesa, California, had agreed to print
some of these materials. ALEXANDER was described as a former

MM supporter who had allowed TROY HAUGHTON to use his printing

facilities for the benefit of the West Coast MM organization.

Other plans for the new organization included
eventually setting up two membership lists which would be
recorded on microfilm, One of the lists would be maintained
by DAVIS and the other by GODFREY. .,The purpose in placing

the membership lists on microfilm was for easy destruction.
Two lists were to be maintained to guard against the
possibility of one being lost or destroyed.

On October 8, 1971, it was reported that DAVIS had
chosen the name "Secret Army Organization" for his new group.
In addition, it was learned DAVIS had had 1,000 copies each
of letterhead stationery and membership application forms
for the SAO printed up the previous weekend. DAVIS also
advised that he, GODFREY, and other associates would attend
the Annual Yuma Gun Show at Yuma, Arizona, on October 16 and
October 17, 1971, at which time he expected contact would be -
made with people attending the gun show from Phoenix,

Arizona, and Seattle, Washington, regarding the SAO.
7 ; (SD T-1, October 8, 1971)

-On October 16, and October 17, 1971, DAVIS, GODFREY,
and STANLEY DON MC DADE, a prospective member of the SAO residing
at 4114 Massachusetts, La Mesa, California, were in attendance
at_ the Yuma Gun Show. Following the gun show, a meeting was
held in a motel room at Yuma, Arizona, with persons in
attendance, including the above three individuals and EVERETT \
MOORE and his wife from Phoenix, Arizona, and CY ANDERSON
from Seattle, Washington. The topic of discussion was the SAO
and those attending the meeting were in general agreement
that a new cohesive force was necessary among Right Wing
groups as a result of the power vacuum left by the disintegration
of the MM organization. MOORE and ANDERSON tentatively agreed
to having their respective groups join the SAO subject to the
approval of the members of these groups. Copies of printed
material of the SAO, including a leaflet entitled, "History
of the Secret Army Organization," a copy of the first bulletin
of the SAO entitled, "To Prospective Members of the Secret
Army Organization," and membership application forms were passed~
around among the group. >.

It was decided thatpsubsequent contacts regarding
expansion of the SAO would be made and that the San Diego area

mail “arop for the Phoenix group would be the address of
HOWARD FRANCIS CLARK, 1080 6th Street, Ramona, California,
“a"forner member “Of the MM organization.

t :

En route to the gun show, CY, ANDERSON's automobile
had broken down some,place in the State of Nevada and it had
been necessary for him to hire transportation from there to
the gun show. After the gun show, DAVIS drove to Las Vegas,
Nevada, accompanied by ANDERSON, to make contact with people
known to him regarding the SAO.

“ It was reported that DAVIS, who is part American
Indian, had abandoned the idea of joining the NSWPP when he
learned in late September, 1971, that the NSWPP is adamantly
opposed to persons having American Indian blood, considering
them to be of an inferior race. It was felt that this fact -
was responsible for DAVIS' decision ‘to finally go ahead
and orgarfize the SAO,

|
t .
7 It was also reported that, in addition to the
letterhead stationery and application forms, several thousand
copies of the history leaflet and the first bulletin had also }
been printed at the same time as well as a number of stickers {
advertising for the SAO. The printing of these materials was
doné by BETTIE HAUGHTON on an offset press which she had
maintained since the time her husband was in the MM organization.
Many copies of these printed materials have been sent out to
people known in the past to have been MM members or other
Right Wing sympathizers.

The meeting mentioned in the first paragraph of the
history leaflet is actually a disguised reference to the meeting
which took place in the motel room at Yuma, Arizona, on
October 17, 1971. :

i (SD T-2, October 20, 1971)

DAVIS returned home from Las Vegas, Nevada, on the
evening of October 23, 1971. He stated that the reason for
this delay was that he had becomé very involved in Las Vegas

ADDENDUM



join the Secvet Amny Organization. Those-of us who have been merabers for
some time sincercly believe that our organization can be of real valic in pre-
serving for future generations the land of freedom and opportunity which our
forefsihers handed down to us.

3 is*the belief of our organization thal the communist-socialist can-
spiracy has infiltrated the United States Government to such an extent thatthe
- American people cannot rely on this country's clected leaders to protect thom

frora communis! domination and slavery.

We believe that the time will come when the American people will have
to fight for their lives-and theix Hberty. In this belief. we have formed in
advance a secret underground army with but one objective, to defend our con-
stitutional republic and to help cur fellow Americans to do the same.

We do no want lukewarm members, We are an organization of people
willing to make any sacrifice necessary for our country. If you feel the same
way, We invite you to join us.

Team Sergeant andthe two remaining team members. When completely assembled
the unit will act directly under the command of the Team Lieutenant, When spli

: TRANSPORTATION

Transportation of the Combat Team will be effected by the use of two car-
} riers, Interception and/or destruction of one carrier will not, then, immobilize
the team. In eddition, each carrier can serve as a scouting element for the other.
Motorized carriers should be as inconspicuous as possibie and still serve their
purpose. Jeeps and pickup trucks should be used only where such vehicles are
owned and uged commonly by the general population cr where the terrain makes
their use necessary. Most often an ordinary passenger car will suffice. The
model selected should have a good road clearance so it can be used on dirt roads.
Tire chains (if needed), hydraulic jacks, extra gas, water, and suitable tools
should bs stored in the vehicle,

by day, will require an interval of approximaicly 360 yards, At night this will i

be reduced to approximately 100 yards. Durint travel, all equipment (especially

arms and amininition) should be kept ciy of sight. Special team equipment and i
weapons should be Jocked in the brenk of the vehicle until needed. The trunk key q

For all receiving offices, DRAGER is presently
carried as an ADEX subject. Inasmuch as DRAGER has indicated
he advocates the violent overthrow of the US. Government and
overtly been attempting to recruit personnel, arms and amnun
in efforts te accomplish this end, it is recommended DRAGER be
continuéd as an ADEX subject and his activities be closely
followed.

Information copies of instant report are being made
available to designated offices, inasmuch as investigation has
revealed the subject has associates and contacts residing within
these divisions. Subject is believed to have travelled within

and Nazi Party.

Information copies are further being made availaHe

criminal activities throughout these divisions in efforts to
support themselves while travelling throughout the U.S.

CARROLL, who was arrested aay interviewed under the name TIOMAS
MIDDAUGH.

a 1970 Ford pickup truck, with a camper truck unit, was left
by DRAGER at the Sheriff's Impound Lot. 7 ‘

On March 6, 1974, NK T-2 ged he obtained information

that FRANK DRAGER had visited ROBEE 3 PUGH,..Titular, Head of
the Minutemen Organization, in ‘NOEBSENE? Missouri. specu

The Minutemen organization was organized

in 1960, reportedly to resist the spread of
communism in the United States by use of

guerrilla tactics. Robert B. DePugh, national
coordinator of the Minutemen, was sentenced in
October, 1970, for violations of the Federal
Firearms Act. At the time of his arrest DePugh
was in possession of documents concerned with
poet warfare and other paraphernalia, including

and grenades, gun silencers, and a machine gun.
DePugh was released on parole during April, 1973,
and in June, 1973, ‘indicated he planned to revitalize
the Minutemen into a “two~armed organization".
Arm number one was to be utilized as a political
front organization to sway elections and control
local and state political structures. Arm number
two was ,to be an underground guerrilla organization
made up of “strike teams". These “strike teams"
are to be under direct control of DePugh and their
existence is to be unknown to everyone, including
Minutemen State Coordinators.

After leaving Norborne, DRAGER was arrested in
Springfield, Illinois. DRAGER was scheduled to proceed to
Columbus, Ohio to meet with JOUN\GERSARD®, Leader of the American
White Nationalist Party (AWNP) and was to continue to Reading,
Pennsylvania, to meet with ROY ee

DRAGER was supposedly carrying a message from DE PUGH
to GERHARDT and FRANKHOUSER. GERHARDT and his brother, ED
GERHARDT, are leaders of the AWIP in Columbus, Ohio. The GMRHARDTs
and a JAMES THOMPSON were arrested for shooting the homes of sa
school officials in Columbus, Ohid, JAMES -QHOMP SON allegedly
turned stated witness against the GERNARDT brothers, The GFRUARDT
brothers contacted the Indiand coordinator of the Minutemen and
ROY FRANKHOUSER to make plang to prevent THOMPSON's testimony and

New Jersey. BRODERICK stated DRAGER claims to be “acting dragon”
in the Ku Klux Klan and was known to him to have close links with
the United Klan Leader ROBERT SHELTON. He further advised DRAGER
did carry some type of firearm with him on his person at most times.

On May 16, 1974, Sk was recontacted by Special
Agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation at the QRCDR ROR

DRAGER have a small arsenal of weapons, primarily

automatic rifles. All or most part of these guns are stolen.
The arsenal consists of three satchels, one belonging to FRANKHOUSER,
the other :to DRAGER and the third to both. Apparently only
FRANKHOUSER knows their present whereabouts.

DRAGER told Him that he and CARROLL had stolen the checks made
out to the Marathon Cay Sal Billfish Tournament and had been
cashing them in the Florida Keys area. According to DRAGER,
CARROLL committed, the actual theft, while DRAGER waited in his
truck nearby. .

cassette inside was received at FBI Headquarters enclosed in a
white envelope, bearing notation "20 April 1974; 85th birthday
of Adolf Hitler; thought you guys might like to hear from us.
FRANK DRAGER, WILLIAM CARROLL, National Revolutionary Army."
The speaker on the tape claims to be FRANK DRAGER. An examination
of the envelope by the Identification Division revealed three
fingerprints of subject, FBI Numer 405-550-E. Copies of this

» "I had originally planned for this communication to
be typewritten, but since I stole this tape recorder, I guess
it's just as appropriate as a letter.

Clarence Kelley, Director of the FBI,
. Washington, R.°C.

Dear Mr. Kelley:

I had always praised the thoroughness of the FBI,
even though on scores of occasions you've permitted your
paranoia and your lack of human understanding could foul. you
up. Your drooling excitement and your paranoic stupidity and
your fruitless eagerness at having Frank Drager in your grimy
grubs in Springfield, Illinois, make super idiots of the
Federal Bureau of Integration. You now realize how many
foolish errors youymade. In the near future you will be em-
ployed by the new natural government of Anerica rather than
the Jew Justice Department and such gupidity will not be
tolerated. How ridiculous for a gang of trained investigators
to be fooled and beaten by a teenager. Have you idiots put
all the pieces together yet? Whether or not you have, we both
thank God for your paranoid stupidity for now we are free to
continue tying together the few remaining loose ends which
will permit the National Revolutionary Army to eliminate
eriminal Jewish control of America. Now ovir armies can con-
‘tinue to join forces to eliminate this alien enemy government.
Continue your search for Frank Drager and Bill Carroll. It'll
be useless and frustrating. If you are lucky enough to capture
one of our soldiers in the future, beware, there's a speeding
soft-nose for all of our enemies. Unfortunately, miost fellow
Agents are mercenaries. They are actually with us in spirit
but they will still follow the orders of their Jewish superiors
to attempt to detect and capture our people and unfortunately
we will have to deal with these Agents ruthlessly until they a
realize that they are dominated and controlled by alien enemies
of America and begin working on the side of right. At one
time not too long ago we patriots were as useless_as_a_ bunch.

On June 11, 1974, NK T-2 advised he developed information
that would indicate a meeting was held at the residence of
AL LENTZ, Grand Dragon of the National Knights of the Ku Klux
Klan, in the York, Pennsylvania area. In attendance, were numerous
members of he Ku Klux Klan and Minutemen organization.

FRANK .DRAGER was known to have been at this meeting.

DRAGER outlined his plans for establishing an organization called

the National Revoluntionary ‘Army. DRAGER explained that the goals
of this group were to "destroy" the United States Government and
replace it with members of his own group. DRAGER was believed to
have mentioned he contacted H. RAP BROWN, a black extremist, and
other activist leaders and plans to united, these various groups

to achieve his goals.

DRAGER also indicated he had a large quantity of dynamite
and plans to blow up two city blocks on July 4, 1974. DRAGER
stated that he did not have blasting caps at that time but might.
be able to get them from a Minuteman member in Indiana.

DRAGER alleges to have traveled to various parts of
the country and has urged members of the right wing to commit
acts of violence on July 4, 1974, so that the NRA could take
credit for these acts. The source was advised DRAGER exhibited
four .45 caliber pistols, three .30 caliber carbines and one
bolt action rifle at this meeting.

The source was further advised DRAGER braggs about his
passing bad checks in Florida and his using stolen credit cards
to purchase gasoline, food and lodging. DRAGER supposedly plans
to obtain $200,000.00 in the near future and this might be
‘accomplished through a kidnapping or bank robbery.

DRAGER further indicated sometime during the meeting
that he would like to know how to make letter bombs.

On June 13, 1974, NK T-3 advised he learned a meeting
was held at the home of ALBERT LENTZ, head of a small group called
the Independent Ku Klux Klan of York, Pennsylvania. PRANK DRAGER
was known to have been in attendance with six or seven other
right wing sympathizers. At that meeting, DRAGER stated he plans
to blow up two city blocks by placing dynamite in the sewer system
of this city.

DRAGER also requested the group to cause incidents
such as explosions on July 4, 1974, so a group he is forming
called the NRA could take credit for it. DRAGER stated he was
going underground and would use the code name GORMAN.

Ape

DRAGER was known to have stayed at aL LENTZ' residence

from June 3} 1974 to June 6, 1974.

On June 15,°1974, NK T-2 advised that in conversation
with a Ku Klux Klan member in Philadelphia, it was learned six or
seven individuals met at the home of AL LENTZ, on June 5, 1974,
in York, Pennsylvania. All in attendance represented a small group
of independent Ku Klux Klan members and several Indiana representatives
of the Minutemen. FRANK DRAGER was in attendance and discussed his
plans for the forming of a group called "NRA" and the source also
developed information that DRAGER was planing to blow up two city
blocks on July 4, 1974.

On July 2, 1974, Mr. ROY ERAUKHOUSER was interviewed by
Special Agents of the FBI in inet oe his attorney. FRANKHOUSER
stated he met FRANK, DRAGER on June 7, 1974, at the Coach House
Restaurant, 5th and‘ Walnut Streets, Reading, Pennsylvania.

FRANKHOUSER was brought to the restaurant by a JAKE (LAST NAME UNKNOWN)
an associate of DRAGER's; however, JAKE was not present during this
meeting. During the meeting, DRAGER wanted FRANKHOUSER's help in
obtaining fuses for timing devices for explosives and requested

further assistance in several projects. FRANKHOUSER stated he

declined in both oases. DRAGER stated he had looked into the Gubow
matter in Michigan, and indicated he and his group were going to kill
Judge GUBOW. DRAGER stated he had been to Michigan and "cased"

the judge's home. DRAGER stated he tried to contact the wife of
Reverend ROBERT MILES, in Michigan, but she would not talk to him.
DRAGER stated the only reservation he had about killing Judge GUROT
was whether or not it would effect the appeal of Reverend MILES.

It is noted Judge GUBOW is the Federal judge who sat in
on the case involving Reverend ROBERT MILES, who was tried and
convicted for the bombing of school buses in Pontiac, Michigan.

FRANKHOUSER stated DRAGER also stated he was going to take
care of two FBI agents and mentioned the names CLONINGER (phonetic)
and MIFFLIN (phonetic). DRAGER indicated he was going to "blow
them out" and kill them. DRAGER also indicated he needed enough
explosives to “level a one story building". DRAGER stated that at
one point he was going to blow,up an IRS building, but did not mention
any specific location.

It is noted Special Agents of the FBI mentioned above are
possibly identical to SAS BURL E. CLONINGER and CHARLES F. MOFFETY,
who have worked Ku Klux Klan matters in the Trenton, New Jersey area.

FRANKHOUSER stated he accompanied DRAGER and they walked
to the vicinity of 3rd and Walnut Streets, Reading, Pennsylvania,
where a relatively new car was parked. ,DRAGER opened the trunk and
FRANKHOUSER ohserved numerous handguns and rifles and believed there
were explosives in the trunk. FRANKHOUSER could not furnish further
description of this vehicle. DRAGER showed FRANKHOUSER the weapons
to show them “we mean business".

FRANKHOUSER then stated that DRAGER indicated he had a
“caper" planned that would meant $100,000.00. DRAGER did not
further discuss the caper. FRANKHOUSER concluded on his own that
the "caper" was possibly a bank robbery. FRANKHOUSER denied any
specific knowledge regarding any bank robberies on DRAGER's part.

FRANKHOUSER stated he was contacted by DRAGER via telephone
call on one occasion subsequent to June 7, 1974 meeting. At this
time, DRAGER indicated two of his men had been arrested and the
"caper" was delayed. This cdntact was about two days prior to
DRAGER's arrest in New Jersey.

It is noted the New Jersey State Police made available
a xerox copy of a parking ticket in the recovered 1973 Pinto, stolen
by DRAGER on March 11, 1974, indicating he was ticketed on June 6,
1974, at 1:41 pm, in the vicinity of 4th Street, Reading, Pennsylvania,
Ticket Number 18025, thusly verifying that DRAGER was in the Reading:
area on or about the date DRAGER and FRANKHOUSER .had their clandestine
meeting.

On June 14, 1974, Detective JOHN REYNOLDS, New Jersey,
State Police, West Trenton, New Jersey, advised a WILLIAM ERIC CARROLL
and a JAMES KEITH were arrested by the New Jersey State Police at
Bordentown, New Jersey, when they were noticed to have illegally

had a warrant for the subject's arrest. He is charged with fraud
for failure to return a 1973 Ford rental car, rented by DRAGER on
March 11, 1974. On August 6, 1974, Mr. HAROLD LANG, Lang Enterprises,
209 Lawrence Road, Lawrence Township, New Jersey, owner of the

or to sign any statements. CARROLL was advised that the

. ei interviewing agent, was specifically seeking information
regarding the activities of he and FRANK AUGUST DRAGER and a
group called the National Revolutionary Army (NRA). CARROLL
related the following information:

He stated he met FRANK DRAGER in the presence of a
THOMAS ‘MIDDAUGH prior to the summer of 1973. MIDDAUGH was
described as his close friend and they both attended a
Ku Klux Klan (KKK) rally in Upper New Jersey, at which time
= MIDDAUGH introduced him to DRAGER. DRAGER is known to be the
legal guardian for MIDDAUGH. He was much impressed by the -
zeal and philosophy of FRANK DRAGER and immediately became
his close friend and associate. Even though it was later
learned by CARRGLL that DRAGER was a homosexual, he decided
to be tolerant of this fatt and they would continue to travel
together and expound their right wing philosaphy.

He stated he felt he had quite a bit to do with
FRANK DRAGER re-joining the right wing element. He stated
that they talked a lot about how the right wing could change
the country and felt they could work together as a highly
proficient team. He stated that many of their activities were
planned while they were high on marijuana. : Peete

o They then went to the Jersey Shore where BRODERICK
and DRAGER obtained employment at the Captain Courageous Bar.
BRODERICK and DRAGER were Known to have stolen numerous checks
from the Captain Courageous Bar and passed these checks to
. obtain morley to travel to Florida. .

. 7 ca
In September of 1973, he, DRAGER and BRODERICK were

arrested in Toms River, N.J., in what he felt was a “set up”.
He stated he believed the FBI had made their presenceknown to
the local authorities so the local authorities would arrest
and harass them for the FBI, The three of them made bail and
purchased 40 pounds of marijuana‘and left for Florida in
FRANK DRAGER's camper truck. They took several jobs under
assumed names, working as dishwashers and cooks. BRODERICK
then took a job at the Ocean Reef Beach Club in Key Largo, Fla.
At af DRAGER also worked there for a short time but were
ired. . ~

* During this period of time, DRAGER purchased an
M-1 Carbine and 4 .45 caliber automatic pistol while in
Florida. He and DRAGER thén travelled to New Orleans,
where they made a drug buy and stole a .32 caliber handgun
from a drug pusher on the New Orleans waterfront.

After making several right wing contacts, they left

other right wing sympathizers. On their journey, they had

Minutemen.’ SHELTON and DE PUGH proniséda“futiSupport for the
NRA, which CARROLL stated was the same as the White Action
Movement founded by DRAGER several years ago at Trenton, N.J.

While in Springfield, Tll., in February, 1974, they
‘were arrested for possession of marijuana, burglary tools,
and dangerous weapons. CARROLL again advised he felt the
FBI had something to do with this arrest and expressed the
thought that possibly DE PUGH was an informant or else the
FEI had seen them with DE PUGH And followed them to the
location of their arrest. CARROLL stated he used the ijentification
of THOMAS MIDDAUGH inasmuch ‘as he thought the FBI and the
Florida authorities had warrants for he and DRAGER.

DRAGER obtained bail money for them and upon their
release from jail they tried to obtain the camper truck back
but were advised by the local authorities it was going to be
used as evidence in their pending case.

(leew : Inasmuch as they had ‘no transportation, they then
hitchhiked from Springfield, Ill., to York, Pa., where they
visited with AL LENTZ. They then proceeded to Trenton, N.J.,
and obtained a rentai car which they did not return. CARROLL
indicated they then left the Trenton area and went to Boston,
Mass., in efforts to get him a driver's license. While in
Boston they tried to cash several more Captain Courageous
checks but were not successful, inasmuch as everybody

7 required photographic identification.

After having left Boston, Mass., they travelled to
Washington, D.C., and visited a SKYLER FERRIS (phonetic). They
tried to obtain maps of the sewer system of Washington, D.C.,
from him. FERRIS was advised of their plans to bomb the
Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and at first FERRIS was not
agreeable. FERRIS was then guaranteed that the local authorities
would be advised of the bomb a half hour prior to its detonation
on July 4, 1974. FERRIS was agreeable to this plan and
supplied them with the diagram of the sewer system. FERRIS
is further known to be a right wing patriot and supplied
names of local ‘patriots to DRAGER.

After departing Washington, D.C., they travelled
to Florida and visited with an ORVILLE LIPPERT. eseeaeed
foe :
They then proceeded to Alabama where they registered
the vehicle they stole in Trenton, N.J. They then travelled
back to York, Pa., and saw AL LENTZ again. They. visited
several days with LENTZ and then returned to Trenton, N.J.,
where they looked up a JAMES KEITH, who is known to be a
close friend of JAMES BRODERICK. They requested him to find’
. them an apartment which they could rent for several weeks
prior to their planned uly 7 attempt to bomb the IRS,
Washington, D.C.

KEITH, DRAGER, and he were going to the Florence
Motel in Florence, N.J., to move into a room they had rented.
DRAGER was dropped off at an Acme Market to buy groceries
inasmuch as there was not room in the vehicle for the three
of them and groceries. They were heading toward the motel
to deposit their equipment and clothes when they were arrested

by the New Jersey State Police for passing a stopped school
bus. He stated he was going to shoot it out with the New i
Jersey State Trooper but became concerned when KEITH did not :
appear to go along with the idea. They were going to stay at
the motel for approximately two weeks and then return to
Pennsylvania and get dynamite from some patriots in Pennsylvania.
. If this plan ‘was unsuccessful, they had planned to go to one :

of the Western Statés and obtain dynamite under the guise of i

future prospectors. He stated that the chemicals that were

in the car at the time of his arrest were experimented with i

by he and DRAGER in efforts to make a bomb. These efforts were

not too successful and thusly they decided dynamite would be

a better method.

CARROLL advised the NRA is identical to the White i.
Action Movement formed by DRAGER in 1970 in Trenton, N.J. :
He claims to have organized chapters all over the United States .
and Canada and these groups are composed of disgruntled right :
wing patriots who are not satisfied with the passive activities
of the KKK and the Minutemen Organization. He claimed to have :
taken an oath and could not divulge who any of these other Hq
members are. He claimed this group is storing weapons and
explosives and no chapter knows where the other chapter's
weapons are.

CARROLL stated the NRA believes in doing anything
“necessary to support themselves while they are endeavoring to
overtake the U.S. Government. The NRA believes in bank -
robbery, armored car heists, and cashing stolen checks. g
He said presently the NRA has no plans for political kidnappings.
He stated all their members are instructed to die for the iy
cause if necessary. The NRA has devised a code system whereby :
one member can contact another member without the Federal
authorities knowing this is being done. He stated they have
several training grounds throughout the East Coast and i
Mid-West areas and their men are being trained in the use of I
all kinds of weapons. . {

When specifically asked who other members of the
NRA were, CARROLL refused to identify any of these members 1
and it appeared as if possibly no members did, in fact, -
exist.

CARROLL advised JAMES KEITH, who was arrested with
him in the stolen motor vehicle, was not a right wing Patriot
and could not be trusted. “KEITH's services were requested !

by DRAGER inasmuch as KEITH is a close friend of JAMES 7
BRODERICK and was known to be active in criminal endeavors in. - «|
the Trenton area. He and DRAGER believed. KEITH might be able fF
_ to financially help their cause. : :
“CARROLL advised the NRA's philosophy was an incorpora- :
tion of much of the thoughts of the KKK, Minutemen, and the '
American Nazi Party. He stated they were more revolutionary }
and would actively and ardently endeavor to overthrow the U.S. 7
Government’ and replace it with the National Revolutionary
Army. He expounded the philosophy that the NRA was anti-Jewish,
anti-Negro, and anti-Catholic. The NRA is promoting the i
deportation of all non-native born Americans and the return :
of the Jews and Negroes to their homelands. He stated they :
were definitely against the Federal Income Tax, which is - ¢
what led them to decide to blow up the IRS building in !
Washington, D.C. The NRA further advocates political assassinations
if necessary. He:stated that DRAGER had considered killing i
a Judge GUBOW in Michigan but decided not to inasmuch as the {
judge's death might hinder the appeal of Reverend BOB MILES \
who has been sentenced to prison by Judge GUBOW for the |
bombing of school buses in Michigan. CARROLL stated he and i

JHMES KEITH, in-mate, Burlington County Jail,
was made “kr aicthe-fdentity of the interviewing agent ly
a show of credentials and was advised the FBI was inquiring
of him apy information he had regarding the activities of
WILLIAM ERIC CARROLL, FRANK AUGUST RRAGER, and a group
Coerteseaee called the National Revolutionary Army.

KEITH stated he has known FRANK DRAGER for approxi-
mately two years. He was introduced to DRAGER by a JAMES
BRODERICK, who was described by him to be his best friend.
KEITH advised he personally has no political philosophy, and
more specifically is not involved in any form or phase with
DRAGER or his right wing extremist activities.

On June 11, 1974, two days before his arrest with
WILLIAM ERIC CARROLL, known to him as JAKE, JAKE and DRAGER
appeared at his apartment at 125 Dye Street, Trenton, N.d.,
requestting his help in efforts to find an apartment. He
stated BRODERICK had given DRAGER his address. DRAGER and
JAKE stayed at his apartmént for one night. DRAGER stated
he needed a place to lay low for two weeks inasmuch as he
planned to travel to Washington, D.C., to blow up the
Internal Revenue Service (IRS) building at Washington, D.C.
KEITH advised he felt DRAGER was a braggart and did not
believe DRAGER would actually blow up the IRS Building.
DRAGER stated that they were presently operating a stolen
motor vehicle and were wanted by the FBI. KEITH stated he
found an apartment on the corner of Hamilton and Chambers
Streets in Trenton, N.J., but DRAGER refused this inasmuch
as it was on the third floor rather than the first floor.
That next evening, on the 12th of June; they visited a close
friend of KEITH's by the name of VINNY {RAMPONE, 545 Hamilton
Avenue, and requested of RAMPONE a garggé“in-wntth to hide
the stolen motor vehicle. He stated hé did not tell RAMPONE
specifically the nature of the request’ inasmuch as he felt
RAMPONE might call the police if he knew the car was stolen.
KEITH advised he knew DRAGER had numerous weapons concealed
in the vehicle. KEITH stated that he did not wish DRAGER
and JAKE to stay with him, so he recommended Fhey| gbtain a

efficiency apartment at the Florence Motel in Florence, N.J.
On the evening of June 13, 1974, he and JAKE dropped FRANK
DRAGER off at a grocery store in the Florence, N.J., area,
and as they were travelling to the motel they were arrested
by the New Jersey State Police on a traffic charge. At

. the time they were stopped, CARROLL reached under the front
seat and drew out a .45 caliber automatic and stated he was
going to shoot it out with the trooper. KEITH told him
he was crazy, inasmuch as JAKE did not even know why they
were stopped. The officer advised them they had illegally
passed a school bus and requested to see JAKE's identification.
JAKE then handed the trooper a driver's license and the
trooper evidently noticed JAKE had several other driver's
licenses in his wallet. The trooper then apparently became
suspicious and made them stand against the car while he looked
around. The trooper then spotted one of the guns, placed them
under arrest, and later determined the car to have been stolen.

KEITH Stated he is a parole violator inasmuch as
he has been arrested. KEITH indicated he had no involvement
with DRAGER and JAKE and had requested he transfer to another
jail inasmuch as his involvement with JAKE might get him into
further trouble.

He stated that in his conversations with JAKE while
in.the Burlington County Jail he has determined the following
information:

DRAGER and JAKE had received a map of the diagram

of the sewer system in Washington, D.C., from a friend of

DRAGER's who works for the Sewer Department in Washington, D.C.
* JAKE and DRAGER indicated they were going to blow up the IRS

Building in Washington, D.C. It was also determined that

DRAGER has dynamite and guns buried on a farm, which is in

Pennsylvania. The name GEORGE HOUSER was mentioned in reference

to this farm. JAKE had indicated he and DRAGER had gone to

the Boston, Mass., area and possibly were involved in a bank

robbery. JAKE and DRAGER had pre-arranged plans to make an

escape at any courthouse the other one was to appear if

apprehended. A person by the name of DE PUGH was to have

gotten a copy of the sewer plan’ of Washington, D.C., from

FERRIS. A RAYMOND DOERFLER from Trenton, N.J., went to a

Ku Klux Klan meeting at Risfng Sun, Md., in efforts to get

money for FRANK DRAGER's bail and further monies in efforts

to help DRAGER purchase his camper truck from a ORVILLE LIPPERT.

NK 157-2011 ‘

It is further noted ROY FRANKHOUSER, Reading, Pa.,
is believed to use the code name "RALPH". FRANK DRAGER and
JAKE had planned to rob a bank and had considered also an
“armored car robbery.

JAKE had mentioned on several occasions a training
grounds used by the National Revolutionary Army (NRA) for
the purpose of the invasion of Cuba and the NRA clains support
from the Cuban underground. The NRA supposedly plans to
invade Cuba on July 4, 1976. i

It was further learned that the camper truck, which
is a home-made camper and in the possession of ORVILLE LIPPERT, was
designed specifically to be used in smuggling guns across
the Canadian border. The walls of the camper truck have secret
compartments and DRAGER is supposed to have a gun contact in
Canada. Presently there are believed to be two 9mm. lugers
located somehwere in the camper body. JAKE also stated DRAGER
has a close friend who is affiliated with the Ford Motor Company
as an inventor. This individual is an excellent machinist and
has made numerous silencers for the right wing element.

. KEITH advised he did not condone the right wing

activities of JAKE and DRAGER and. stated he would help the
FBI.in any way possible. .

Mr. WILLIAM R, JENKINS, -364 South Olden Avenue,
Trenton, N.d.f/lwas interviewed regarding his knowledge
involving his identification papers being found on a WILLIAM
ERIC CARROLL when CARROLL was arrested on June 13, 1974,
by the New Jersey State Police at Columbus, N.J.

JENKINS initially advised he had no knowledge as to
how WILLIAM ERIC CARROLL could be in receipt of his driver's
license and Social Security Card. He stated he had lost
his wallet several months back and did not know its where~
abouts. At that time, it was pointed out to him that —
CARROLL was a travelling companion of FRANK AUGUST DRAGER,
and that DRAGER had had his White Action Movament Headquarters
just two houses from the JENKINS' residence. At that time,
JENKINS advised that he knew FRANK DRAGER and related the
following information:

He stated that early in the Spring of 1974 he
saw PRANK DRAGER in a camper truck with Pennsylvania tags
across the street from his residence. DRAGER had spotted him
coming home from school and pulled over to talk to him. DRAGER
had stated that he was wanted by the FBI and needed phoney
identification. JENKINS advised he could not help him and
could not supply any information how he might obtain such.

JENKINS then advised that around the first of June,
1974, he again met DRAGER in the front of his residence and
DRAGER, at that time, was driving a green Ford Pinto believed
to have Florida license plates. Again DRAGER requested false
identification, and JENKINS advised he could not supply him
with any. JENKINS then noticed his driver's license was about
to expire and asked DRAGER to take him down to the Department
of Motor Vehicle; Trenton, N.J., where he could obtain a new
license. JENKINS then stated he must have accidently lost
his wallet in DRAGER's car when they were returning from the
- Department of Motor Vehicles. Again DRAGER indicated he was
wanted by the FBI and local police authorities. He stated
he was only passing through Trenton and was not staying in

. and Social Security Card.
tee RAMPONE advised he is a close friend of JAMES KEITH,
known to him as TEX, and-on:the evening of June 12, 1874,
KEITH and JAKE visited his apartment. They stayed there for
several hours talking about things in general.

JAKE then began to go off on a right wing tangent

and talked about “niggers aid how they should be sent back
to Africa.” RANPONE told KEITH that this individual was not:
welcome in his house inasmuch as he, RAMPONE, did not advocate
the right wing program. At that time KEITH stated a FRANK
DRAGER needed a garage to park his car. RAHPONE then
realized DRAGER was also a right wing extremist and declined
this request. He stated that at that time JAKE -had acc ;
his bedroom and bathroom and possibly obtained some of this
identification at that time. RAMPONE showed his original
driver's license and indicated the only thing JAKE couvld

Mr. RORIOND DORELER rE.49 Centre Street, Trenton,
N.Jd., voluntarily appeared at the Trenton Resident Agency

of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (PBI) and advised he
was a close friend to FRANK AUGUST DRAGER. He stated he and
DRAGER had been active together over the past several years
in matters involving the activities of the National Knights
of the Ku Klux Klan in Bucks County, Pa. DOERFLER advised

he is presently a leading officer of the Bucks County Chapter.

DOERFLER advised that inasmuch as FRANK DRAGER
has appeared ultra-radical in his right wing activities and
has been committing many criminal violations, DOERFLER felt
it was in the best interest of the Klan if they would
separate themselves from any of DRAGER's activities.

On March 12, 1974, DRAGER contacted DOERFLER at
DOERFLER's place of employment, The Pennington Furnace,
Pennington, N.J., and asked DOERFLER to supply him with
phoney identification. DRAGER stated the green Ford Pinto
he was drivingwas stolen and he had plans of leaving the State
of New Jersey. DOERFLER stated that DRAGER was in the company
of a young white male known to him by the name JAKE. It
was also noted that several weapons were observed in this
vehicle.

DOERFLER said to DRAGER he could not supply him with
any phoney identification, and more specifically could not
give him his.

DOERELER was told by DRAGER that he, DRAGER, was
going to leave’ the area and head toward Penndel, Pa., to
meet a FRED: SHAFFLER.at the Lantern Inn in Penndel. SHAFFLER
is known € to" be employed at Fernell's Auto Body in Levittown, Pa.

On June 27, 1974, Mr. SCHUYLER DAVENPORNERRIS ,

2903 Brook Drive, Falls Church, ‘Virgintsv was interviewed by.

Special Agents of the FBI. He statei he continues his employment

with the District of Columbia Government, where he checks on and

takes remedial action concerning sludge buildup where sewage

pipes enter the Potomac and Anacostia Rivers in the Washington,

D.C. area. FERRIS related anyone claiming to be an engineer or

>to acting on behalf of an engineer, may obtain free copies of

diagrams of water and sewer systems of Washington, D.C. area,

by contacting Third Floor of the District Building, 12th and

Pennsylvania Avenues, Washington, D.C. FERRIS denied having

furnished any such documents to anyone and emphasized that anyone

could obtain these diograms. FERRIS was asked if he had knowledge

of any plans to disrupt water or sewer systems in any major cities

and he denied knowing of any such plans. On June 30, 1974, FERRIS

telephonically contacted the FBI and advised Special Agents that

he desired to provide additional information in connection with

his interview as conducted on June 27, 1974. He stated that the

defense plans for the City of Chicago, Illinois, are available on

request from that City Government and that they show the water and 4

sewer systems. FERRIS stated he has maps of Washington, D.C., water

and sewer systems which. he uses in his work for the District of

Columbia, but has never furnished same to any individual or group i

nor has he ever been requested to obtain this information.

FERRIS was asked if he had recently had any personal contact
with persons from out~of-town who share his same political beliefs.
FERRIS then volunteered he had seen FRANK DRAGER earlier in June
1974. After DRAGER telephoned him at his home, DRAGER requested and
obtained from FERRIS a list of names and addresses of persons
described by FERRIS as "patriots". He would not elaborate further
on this but described DRAGER as a worthless "bragger and fink", who
was recently arrested in Illinois and was thereafter released on
personal recognizance whereas ROY FRANKHOUSBR, described by FERRIS
as another patriot, had to post $100,000.00 bond for his release from
jail. FERRIS stated that DRAGER made no reference to any proposed
distruction of any city on or about July 4, 1974 and FERRIS denied
having any such discussion with DRAGER or anyone else. FERRIS stated
he does not know if DRAGER would participate in any such scheme and
felt certain that “no right wing patriot" would participate in any
such act of violence.

Fl On July 2, 1974, Mr. JAMES C. ROBERTSON, Director, Engineering’
and Construction Administration, Department of Environmental Services,
District of Columbia Government, Room 309, Prudential Building, b
415 12th Street, Northwest, Washington, D.C., was interviewed and it

a :



NK 157-2011

was determined that ROBERTSON's office maintains for distribution
1/1000 scale maps of the entire District of Columbia sewer system
and 1/1000 scale maps of the entire District of Columbia water
system. These maps are for persual and available free of charge

to persons having a valid reason but are not given away indiscriminatly
because of the cost. These maps have no dimensions and show no
detail except in a very general way. There is no record maintained
of the distribution. ROBERTSON advised the system is coded to the
map described above relating to detail map with scales of 1 inch

to 100 feet and 1 inch to 50 feet, showing the exact locations of
the water mains, the connections and valves. The maps are available
primarily to architects preparing building plans. He stated to
obtain copies of the detailed maps, the District of Columbia
Government requirzs a release to limit the liability of the district
in the event of a law suit.

On July 30, 1974, Mr. HASKELL L. COUNTS, Chief,
Construction and Engineering Division, Department of Environmental
Services (DES), Government of the District of Columbia, Washington,
D.C., was interviewed. Mr. COUNTS stated that DES maintains for
its own use and the use of a limited number of cthers having a
need for them, 1 inch to 1000 feet scale maps of the overall water
and sewer system of the District of Columbia. He said that blueprints
scaled 1 inch to 50 feet or 1 inch to 100 feet can be obtained from
| DES for specific locations throughout the district. The blueprints
|" show exact locations of sewers, water mains, valves, connections,
etc., and generally are available to contractors and others having.
a need for them. COUNTS advised that SCHUYLER DAVENPORT FERRIS,
| who is employed by the Construction and Engineering Division, DES,
as a member of a survey party concerned with the city water and
| * sewer system, would have access to both maps of the overall water
and sewer systems and detailed blueprints for specific locations in

7 the District of Columbia.

On September 3, 1974, Mr. AERERA Pa lANe. was interviewed
at his employment, Quaker City Paper,*380 North Sherman Street,
York, Pennsylvania, by Special Agents of the FBI. LENTZ stated that
DRAGER stayed with him at his residence 330 North Street, York,

~‘ Pennsylvania, during the first week of June. He stated that DRAGER
had several guns in his possession at that time. LENTZ advised that
there were other Klan type individuals from Indianapolis in attendance
while DRAGER was there, and they and DRAGER held secret discussions
towhich LENTZ was not privy. LENTZ advised that he never heard
DRAGER talk about bombing but knows that DRAGER was talking big

about going underground. LENTZ advised that no one in his group
favors “weatherman tactics" and that if he had learned of a bombing
plot, he would have contacted Captain MC CAFFERY, of the York,
Pennsylvania, Police Department, before he would have allowed

destruction or killing. Regarding DRAGER's claim to bomb the
city on the Fourth of July, LENTZ advised he never heard such
plans and reyards DRAGER as a blow-hard. LENTZ said he has a
news letter from DRAGER dated 1972 where DRAGER claims to be

underground.

On June 13, 1974, a search of the 1973 Pinto, stolen
by DRAGER on March 11, 1974, produced the following type pages
apparently prepared by CARROLL describing the NRA, the formation
of an NRA cell, a message to the Left, though CARROLL speaks,
Commandant Reports, official position on non-whites, and letter
to the Director of Federal Bureau of Integration.
