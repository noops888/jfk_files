are la Miami). I sold him 1 moald call him la the moralag, to les bior taow boa

calage aroad.

A. I diacuared our radeilad wieh CISNEROS Mila ITacy BarROs on ibe

moralag of 2 june.

Is was Iracy a opinion, la which I bearilly concur, that

we abould pu ous no mosay whetsoever until se bare had a chance lo examino

diasolo a plas and lo sudy just mhas repercussione or ranilications there

would be, policy-mine and otheraise, lo a decision to assier the !'1RP

callaterally: ¿has la, Ouside the Council and presumably vichoul M120's

laomledge or. consent. Since RAX has withdrawa bia grous frora the Council

with a gree: deal of lanfare, lt is ros; unlikely tai !!IRO would look kindly

ON ADY ASBiBLEACE LO RAY, eauecially sunce he leels he has a racher firma

promise from the President 20 deal only chrough VIRO.

5. RAY, upon ArTival in HaRhingiOs, Mill presumably take his plan (alosg

Mich BEIANCOURI) directly so tir. Gooduin and I would a!80 presurse that

Goodwin will pass li dont to Iracy and TiaCy to 48. Ray Dubois, Wio bre

bara Listolo's case olficer, le standing by la lae evene he saould be aceded.

b. I perennally feel very airoagly was we abould do sorbin; to support the

plas, wastaver le 18, until we have receired from the lihite liouse and the

Departmen clees-cu, unequivocal policy guidance on the overall plan I also

feel thes som lo the l me: 1l me are so ing to dupjort lhe MiRI unllalerally, lo

lasert a pos-olficial cut out tuto the sperasion. I would recommend thas con-

alderalion le given to usin? ME. HasTy Mieper (a dAVE CODITaCE eraployee)

mila juù llanty ls inmpérmenially aulivá, sas a good business head, is

Ruess in Spaniah (lired i8 years in Cuba), ls cleared, followa directions,

complately bones and tremendoasly consclenilous.. It would be hardes so

find a barser person.

7. Also, I would like to poins out the security riska inherent in any arraage-

resto with the RAY-BEIANCOURI-CISNEROS ITiO. Ibese fellome bere had

easy accees to the While House and 10 the DepartIons, are notorioue ior their

"planned leeke: will probably presume all the Department officiala shey deal

visa aro priny to she arrangernens, and beloro me know ll lse whole exile

community will be mall amare that me are providlag linancial and maserial
