MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD ’

_fUBJECT: Relations with Manolo RAY and the RP

1, For background see my memorandum of 12 May 196l, reporting on
my long session with Manolo RAY, Rogelio CISNEROS (Eugenio) and Ernesto
BETANCOURT. As will be noted in that memorandum, Manolo promised to .
come up with a prospectus within approximately ten days! time, after con-
sulting with his leaders in Cuba.

2. On} June 1961 Mr. Parnes called me to say that tr, Goodwin had
been visited by Mr. Ernesto BETANCOURT woo asked for immediate financtal - ~
support for certain activities of the MRP which would run around $!0,¢3u
1 dollare, Mr. Barnes asked me to contact EETANCOURT for the pur-ose of
ascertaining what the {unde were to be used for, exactly how much naeded, etc. 4
Icalle¢ BETANCGURT and he told me that I snould get these details from :
CISNEROS (Eugenio), who was staying at room 549 at the Washington Hotel,
I called Eugealo'and nade a daia for m6 and Ray Dubsis (Ray Adams is ihe
name he uses with Kzy and Cisneros) to call upon him. ‘ve called on CISNEROS . }

at approximately 1815 boure | June, and he informed us that he had urgent
meed for pesos for Use in cupport of his sabotage and underground activities

pow possible for people to buy their way out of prison by oribiag one of the
meny ‘comziunist lawyers and judges. He thought that 4u, CG0 or 64, Lot
would meet immediate needs and that some sort of arrangement should be made
to receive funds = 34,90 monthly or theresboute - on a fixed and permanent
basie.

3. We made no commitment to Fugento other than to say that we would
pace his plea along to the interested people, 1 reminded him that we had acked
Aim and Manolo to prepare a plan for consideration and that we were still
waiting for that glen, 1 said I personally doubted that enyzning could be dene
wntil the plan was recaived from RAY. He sald Manolo was planning to come to
Washington on the afternoon of : June. with the plan, but that he himself was =‘
having to return to Miami immediately and it was vital he be able to takethe
money with him, arrange in Aifaml for purchase of the pesos (at rate af ial}

money slready in Cuba - dollars would be delivered to owners of the pesos who ‘
‘ere fa Miami). I told him I would call him in the morning to let him know how
things stood.

4, Idiecussed our meeting with CISNEROS with Tracy Barnes on the
morning of 2 June. Ik was Tracy‘s opinion, in which I keartlly concur, that
we should put ovt no money whatsoever until we have had a chance to ecamine
Manolo's plan and to study just what resercussions or r:
would be, policy-wise and otherwise, to a decision to assist the MRP
eailaterally; that 1s, outside the Council and presumably without MIRO's
mowledge or. consent. Since RAY has withdrawn his grous from the Council
with a grea: deal of fanfare, it is most unlik that MIRG would look kindly
en any sesistence to RAY, especially since he feels he has a rather firm :
promise from the President to deal only through MIRO. :

5-_ RAY, upon arrival in Washington, will presumably take his lan (along
with BETANCOURT) directly to-Mr. Goodwin and I would also presume that :
Goodwin will pass tt down to Tracy and Tracy to us. Ray DuBois, who has
been Manolo's case officer, is standing by In the event he should be needed.

6 I personally feel very strongly thet we should do nothing to suzport the
plan, whatever itis, until we have received from the White House and the :
Department clear-cut, unequivocal policy guidance on the overall plan, Taleo:
feel that now is the time, if we are so ing to eupzort the MRP unilaterally, to ‘
insert a non-official cut out into the operation. I would recommend that con-
elderation Le given to using Mr. harry Pieper (a MAVE contract employee) t
ga this job. Harzy is iampermienially suiivd, bas a good business head, is :
flueat in Spanieh (lived <8 years in Cuba), is cleared, follows directions, ;
completely honest and tremendously conscientious. It would be harder to i
find a better person.

7. Also, 1 would like to point out the security risks inherent in any arrange-
mente with the RAY-BETANCOURT-CISNEROS trio. These fellowa have had
easy accese to the White House and to the Depart=ent, are notorious ior their

_‘‘planned leaks , will probably presume all the Department officials they deal
“with are privy to the arrangement, and belore we know it the whole exile i
commanity will be well aware that we are providing financial and material eieeH
Support to the RAY group. [am oot arguing against providing such support, :
but am merely pointing out the real potential for emdarrassnient to us if the
matter ie not handled with the greatest of precautions, I {cel they have become
too closely identified with U, S, -officialdom, inctading myself, and that the
plausible denial aspects, to date at least, are almost non-exletent. .
