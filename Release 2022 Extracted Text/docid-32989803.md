Me Church's Cover-Up

The committee is not asking embar-

By William Safire

rassing

questions even when answers

WASHINGON, Nov. 19-On Oct. 10,

1963, the then-Attorney General of the

United. States put his personal signa-

ture on a document that launched and

legitimatized one of the most horren-

dous abuses of Federal police power in

this century.

In Senator Frank Church's subcom-

mittee hearing room this week, the

authorized

quent

wiretapping

unauthorized

and

subse-

bugging and

at-

tempted blackmailing of Martin Luther

King Jr. is being gingerly examined,

with the "investigation" conducted in

such a way as not to unduly em-

barrass officials of the Kennedy or

Johnson Administrations.

With great care, the committee has

focused on the F.B.I. Yesterday, whent

the committee counsel first set forth.

the result of shuffling through press

clips, it seemed as if no Justice De-!

partment harl existed in 1962; today,

an F.B.I. witness pointed out that it

was Robert Kennedy who authorized

the wiretap of Dr. King, and that "the

President of the United States and the

Attorney General specifically discussed

their concern of Communist influence

with Dr. King."

But the Church committee showed

no zest for getting further to the Ken-

nedy root of this precedent to Waler-

gate eavesdropping. If Senator Church

were willing to let the chips fall where

they may, he would call some knowl-

edgeable

witnesses into the glare of

the camera lights and ask them some

questions that have gone unasked for

• thirteen years.

For example, he could call Nicholas

Katzenbach,

Attorney General

Ken-

• nedy's deputy and successor, and ask

what he knows of the Kennedy de-

cision to wiretap Dr. King.

Who

at

Justice concurred in the recommenda-

tion? How does the F.B.I. know the

President was consulted or informed?

After Mr. Katzenbach assumed of-!

fice, and the wiretapping continued,

he was told by angry newsmen that

the F.B.I. was leaking scurrilous in-

formation about Dr. King. Why did he

wait for four months, and for a thou-

sand telephonic interceptions, to dis-

continue the officially approved tap?

Of course, this sore or testimony

would erode Senator Church's political

base. That is why we do not see for-

mer Assistant F.B.I. director Cartha

(Dcke)

Deloach,

Lyndon

Johnson's

personal contact with the F.B.I. in the

witness

chair. What did President

Johnson

know aboul the character-

assassination clot and when did he

know it? What conversations took

vlace between Mr. Deloach and Presi-

dent Johnson on the tapping of Dr.

ring or about the use oi the F.B.I. in

anv other intrusions into ihe lives of

paineRi Egures?

NW 65360 Docld:32989803 Page 47

weeks ago, at an open hearing, an

F.B.I. man inadvertently started to

blurt out an episode about newsmen

who were weritapping in

ness was promptly shooshed into si

lence, and told that such information

would be developed only in executive

• session. Nobody raised

an eyebrow.

That pattern of containment by the

Church committee is vividly shown by

the handling

of the buggings at the

ESSAY

ventions which were orderer by Lyn-

don Johnson. Such invasions of politi-

cal headquarters were worse than the

crime committed at Watergate, since

they involved the use of the 'F.B.I.,

but the Church investigators seem to

be determined not to probe too deeply.

If F.B.I. documents say that reports

were made to specific Johnson aides,

why

are those men not

given the

same opportunity to publicly tell their

story so avidly given the next Presi-

dent's men? If Lyndon Johnson com-

mitted this impeachable high crime of

using the F.B.I. to spy on political,

opponents, who can be brought for-

ward to tell us all about it?

But that would cause embarrass-

ment to Democrats,

and

Senator

Church wants to embarrass profes-

sional

employees of

investigatory

agencies only. A new sense of Con-

gressional decorum exists, far from

the sense of outrage expressed in the

Senate Watergate committee's hear-

ing room. When it is revealed that the

management of NBC News gave press

credentials to L.B.J.'s spies at the 1964

convention, everybody blushes demure-

ly-and nobody demands to know

which network executive made what!

decision under what pressure.

I have been haranguing patient

readers for years about the double

standard applied to Democratic and

Republican political crimes, and had

hoped the day would come when the

hardball precedents set by the Ken-

nedy and Johnson men would be laid

before the public in damning detail,

Obriously, Democrat Frank Church

is not the

man to do it. His jowl-

shaking indignation is all too selec-

live: the trail of high-level responsi-

bility for the crimes committed against

Dr. King and others is evidentiy going

to be allowed to coci.

Pits. You'd think that after ail the

nation has been through in the past

few years, our political leaders would

have learned that the one thing that

brings you down is she act of cover-

ing up.
