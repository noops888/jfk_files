* By William Safire

WASHINGON, Nov. 12—~On Oct. 10,
1963, the then-Attorney General of the
United. States put ‘his personal signa-
ture on a document that launched and
legitimatized one of the most horren-
dous abuses of Federal police power in
this century.
In Senator Frank Church’s subcom-
mittee hearing room this week, the
authorized wiretapping and subse-
quent unauthorized bugging and at-
tempted blackmailing of Martin Luther
King Jr. is being gingerly examined,
with the “investigation” conducted in
such a way as not to unduly em-
barrass officials of the Kennedy or
Johnson Administrations.
With great care, the committee has
focused on the F.B.I. Yesterday, whent
. the committee counsel frst set forth..
the result of shuffling through press
clips, it seemed as if no Justice De-¢
partment had existed in 1962; today,”
an F.B.I. witness pointed out that it
was Robert Kennedy who: authorized
the wiretap of Dr. King, and that “the
President of the United States and the
Attorney General specifically discussed
their concern of Communist influence
with Dr. King.”
But the Church committee showed
no zest for getting further to the Ken-
nedy root of this precedent to Water-
' gate eavesdropping, If Senator Church
‘were willing to let the chips fall where
they may, he would call some knowl-
edgeable witnesses into the glare of
the camera lights and ask them some
questioris that have gone unasked for
- thirteen years,
For example, he could call Nicholas
Katzenbach, Attorney General Ken-
-nedy’s deputy and successor, and ask
what he knows of the Kennedy de-
cision to wietap Dr, King. Who at
Justice concurred in the recommenda-
tion? How does the F.B.1. know the 4
President was consulled or informed? |
After Mr. Katzenbach assumed of: !
fice, and the wiretapping continued, ;
he was told by angry newsmen that
( the FB. was leaking scurrilous in-
formation about Dr. King. Why did he
wait for four months, and for a thou-
sand telephonic interceptions, to dis«
continue the officially approved tap?

Qf course, this sort of testimony
would erode Senator Church’s political
base, That is why we do not see for-
mer Assistant F.B.I. director Cartha

(Dcke) Deloach, Lyndon Johnson’s
personal contact with the E.B.L in the
witness chair. What did President
Johnson know about the character-
assassination plot and when did he

it? What conversations tuaic
viace hetween Mr, Deloach and Presi-
dent Johnson on the tapping of Dr.

Ing. OF about the use in

i

Church's Lover-Up

. the apparent knowleage of Attorne;

“The committee is not asking embar-
rassing questions even when answers
are readily available. A couple of
weeks ago, at an open hearing, an
F.BJ. man inadvertently started to
blurt out an episode about newsmen
who were weritapping in 1962 wi

General Kennedy. The too-willing w’
ness was promptly shooshed into six
ence, and told that such information!
would be developed only in executive

« session. Nobody raised an eyebrow.

That pattern ot containment by the
Church committee is vividly shown by
the handling of the buggings at the
1964 Republican: and Democratic con-

ESSAY

ventions which were ordered by Lyn-
don Johnson. Such invasions of politi-
cal headquarters were worse than the
crime committed at Watergate, since
they involved the use of the 'F.B.L,
but the Chiirch investigators seem to
be determinet not to probe too deeply.
If F.B.1. documents say that reports
were made to specific Johnson aides,
why are those men not given the
same opportunity to publicly tell their
story so avidly given the next Presi-
dent’s men? If Lyndon: Johnson com-
mitted this impeachable high crime of
using the F.B.1. to spy on political
opponents, who can be brought for- ”
ward to tell us all about it? ,
But that would cause embarrass-
ment to Democrats, and Senator *
Church wants to embarrass profes-
sional employees of investigatory
agencies only. A new sense of Con- *
gressional decorum exists, far from
the sense of outrage expressed in the
Senate Watergate committee’s hear-
ing room. When it is revealed that the
management of NBC News gave press
credentials to L.B.J.’s spies at the 1964
convention, everybody blushes demurey,
ly—and nobody demands to know?
which network executive made what!
decision under what pressure. A
I have been hatanguing patien
readers for years about the double
standard applied to Democratic and
Republican political crimes, and had
hoped the day would come when the
hardball precedents set by the Ken-
nedy and Johnson men would be laid
before the public in damning detail. «
Obviously, Democrat Frank Church
is not the man to do it. fis jowl-
indis jon is all too setec-

Dr. King
to be allowed to coal
Pity.

nation has been threagh in the
few years, our political leaders we
have Jearned that the ene th
brings you down is the act of cover-
ing up. —
