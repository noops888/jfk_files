and in the process, you obviously work up
some people who are able to do this kind of work, which is
quite different from the normal life style of most of us.

Mr. Harvey had been a very venturesome officer in the
past. He was responsible for the Berlin tunnel.. And he was
sent down to take this job. And he assumed as part of it the
capability of -- he was given by Mr. Bissel this chore of
earrying on this particular operation as well.

Mr. Schwarz. Had he been the person who had, in
connection with the abortive effort to kill Mr. Lmumba,

hired an agent for that purpose?

Mr. Colby. I have forgotten whether hehired him. He t(B)

references that an additional assignment was to look into the

possible assassination of Mr. Lmumba. The evidence is

that he went down to what is now Kinshasa, Elizabethvi in
1960, stayed there a few weeks, and left in October, I

believe. And then Mr. Lmumba was killed thereafter in a totally
separate set of circumstances in which we had nothing te do. |
There is some indication that a CIA officer who was asked

to have something to do with this particular job said he did H

not want to do it.

Chinese Communists subsequently blamed the Chinese Nationalis

and the US for sabotaging the aircraft. The aircraft employes
had fled to Taiwan. We had nothing to do with that incident
and frankly heard about it after it occurred.

In the fall of 1956, a ssnior Chinese Nationalist ¢

informed an officer of CIA that a Chinese National planned tc |

assassinate Chou En Lai during his visit to Cambodia in

November ‘56 and had been thwarted by the Cambodian arrest of
1

the Chinese Nationalist officer sent to Phnom Penh to supervise

the attempt. We learned of this after it had happened and we

had nothing to do with it.

These are two that were separate.

Alsc I was asked to look at the photographs of Hor

and Sturgis that appeared in Newsweek some years ago. We
obtained this photograph from the FBI last night about 5 o'clock.
We had not had it before. We had a copy of the Newsweek
edition. | 7

These are photographs of Howard Hunt in 1949, 1950 and
1661. This is the only photograph we have of Mr. Sturgis.
It is taken out of the Newsweek.

Chairman Church, Senator Hart.
Senator Hart of Colorado. Mr. Colby, in connection with
ZR Rifle, I think you testified or your associate said this was

a multi-purpose operation

development of the capability of what euphemistically is called
executive action.

In your professional judgment, and with your history of
your background in the Agency, does it make any sense to you

a major operation, a major intelligence gathering operation Gy

about whom all I know is that Mr. Harvey has a background of

something like a soldier of fortune, and funded at the level,
I should say, of $7500 to $10,000?

Does it not suggest to you that AEE) g ' Cosas, was in A{@)
fact an internal cover for what was explicitly an assassination
operation with unlimited, non-voucher financial capability?

Mr. Colby. No, not that it is purely a cover.

In the first place, Mr. Harvey had a very successful tour
in Berlin where he ran the Berlin tunnel operation, which was

one of our major successful intelligence operations.

Mr. Harvey was a very colorful figure who had his lifestyle,

| which is different than some others, but he had been very

as well as this other activity.
Now, in the lifestyle at the time, not mentioning the second
one, this gets back into the recordkeeping that we have been
discussing. It was not to be put on the record although to be
done. That is a perfectly proper hypothesis, it seems to me,

but to say that as only a cover I think is 4

“igi

probably an unwarranted conclusion.

Senator Hart of Colorado. What about the level of funding |

of $7,500 to $10,000?

Mr. Colby. That is not very much money for that kind of
an operation.
Senator Hart of Colorado. Precisely. I think it is too

Little.

Mr. Colby. No. For a capability of that nature, it is

largely a staff operation. In other words, you use your own

Staff officers, You may hire an agent or something, but I don

think you can draw much conclusion from the actual number on

the figure one way or the other.

“ @his might not have been the only such project. You knew,

an assassination project would cost you more money than that,
too.

Senator Hart of Colorado. Absolutely.

Mr. Colby. I find it hard to say that that is the only

uation

where additional money would be put into either of those kinds

Mr. Schwarz. I would like to pick up on the discussion
we had.

Chairman Church. Mr. Schwarz has five minutes more, and
we will ccaclude, and I would lix« to ask the Committee co stay
on for ten more minutes for an executive session.

Mr. Schwarz. In the discussion we had on the use of
criminal elements, we have dealt with the Castro operation.

In the middle of the book sipplied to us by Mr. Breckinridge
earlier this week, there is a discussion about the Lumumba
operation, and the Agent Q. J. Win.

Now, is it a fact that Q. J. Win was the agent, or asset,

ion

however you would refer to him, who apparently was considere

for the effort to assassinate Lumumba, which never tock place;

As that right?

Mr. Colby. Yes, sir.

Mr. Schwarz. Now, is it accurate that Q. J. Win operated

Mr. Colby. This is what is reported, and it is quite
possible.
Mr, Breckinridge. The record indicates that.

Mr. Schwarz. And is it further so that one of the CIA
