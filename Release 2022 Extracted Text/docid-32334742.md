A. PERSONAL HISTORY AND BACKGROUND

hidde Louisiana.

advised SA DONALD L. BELMONT that header

Department birth records for springhill would be maintained at

On July 18, 1950, VERA D. MATTHEWS, Webster Parish Health

Department, advised that there are no birth records on file with

that department for births prior to 1930, and that anything prior

to that time would have to be obtained through records at New

Orleans.

On July 23, 1958, EILEEN A. RICCA, Clerk, Louisiana

State Bureau of Vital Statistics, Civil Court Building, New Orleans,

advised SA ERNEST M. SMITH that a check of the records of that

office failed to reflect any birth record of the subject.

AT DALLAS, TEXAS

On August

18, 1958, SA ROBERT I. BARRETT observed POPE

at the residence of his mother, Mrs. ETHA POPE at 9430 Newhall

(The name of

the street has been recently changed

from Bosque to

On August 11, 1958, Dallas Confidential Informant T-2,

who has furnished reliable information in the past, advised that

POPE's girl friend, DOROTHY ONEITA LANGDON, had recently returned

to her home in Moberly, Missouri, but was maintaining contact with

contacte

contacting POPE from Moberly phone 3746J. The above information

was furnished the St. Louis Office by Dallas on August 22, 1950.

On August 11, 1950, 1-2 also advised that POPE is continuing to

bald, heavily built man, got out of the Pontiac and went into

the weeds nearby. He apparently picked up something, unwapped

It and threw the wrappings away. After this he got back into

the car and the two men drove off. The kids followed them a

short distance and observed that the Pontiac had a 1958 Texas

license with the prefix MR and believed to contain the numerals

8

and 6.

A search was made of the area where one of these men

was observed to throw something down and officers found a road

map of texas on which was stuck a quantity of a gray friction

type tape as though it had been wrapped around something. Near

It was a plastic laundry bag with the words "Cannon-Hale

Cleanres,

Henderson, Texas"

Contact by the Natchez Police

Department with the Sheriff

at Henderson and the Ranger at

Sherman developed as suspects WALTER MACK BARNES, a safe man

with a Pontiac belleved identical, and an ex-convict with whom

he has been friends, SEAPERNE JAMES "BALDY" WHATLEY.

Warrants

were issued by city

authorities at Natchez and the Dallas Police

Department requested to arrest these subjects. Instead, POPE

was arrested

as it was established that he was a narcotics

addict as well as a safe man, had been friends with BARNES and

had a large quantity of morphine stolen in instant burglary.

Tools left at the scene of the burglary consisted of

a large German-made sledge, painted blue with a handle bound

gray friction-type tape, assorted punches, chisels and drills.

All of these were new. This material, along

with the road map,

laundry bag and money wrappers

from change taken from BARNES at

the time of his arrest in Dallas, have been sent

to the FBI

Laboratory.

On August 19, 1958, Sheriff BILL DECKER advised that he

had received information from Natchez, Mississippi authorities

that the

burglary process against POPE and BARNES had been

dismissed because of lack of evidence. Sheriff DECKER stated he

had also received information from his reliable informants that

POPE had no been involved in this burglary but that BARNES was.

On August 21, 1958, Dallas T-2 advised that he had

obtained information that POPE was definitely not Involved in

this burglary, but from conversation that To2 had heard between

of BARNES at Natchez.
