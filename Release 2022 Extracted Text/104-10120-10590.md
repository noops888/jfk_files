WASHINGTON INDEPENDENT - #52h42h (RICHARDS, Guy)

Reference file contains a transcript of the Barry FARBER .Show over

Station WOR-AM, New York, on 3 May 1967 entitled “Journalists Discuss :
CIA NAD Espionage". RICHARDS was queried regarding his book on |
GOLENIEWSKI and his views on the CIA. RICHARDS' replies were critical i
of the Agency. Quote RICHARDS: "Now, let's take a look, for example, H
at the Central Intelligence Agency in the year 1967. If history were
ever to be made of the great American bureaucracy, I think it quite
correct to say that they would pause and pay homage to a remarkable {
fact, namely, that in the form of the Central Intelligence Agency, there i
has suddenly been created and evolved a great idea, namely, the idea of :

combining the FBI with Santa Claus with the British East India Company
with Barnum & Bailey and the Ringling Bros. Circus. And before we

get lost in the derision that this implies, let's take pause on two
very positive possibilities. One, that this may not be such a bad
idea at that. It may take its form among the great diversions."

WASHINGTON INDEPENDENT - #52424 (De BAGGIO, Thomas )

Thomas De BAGGIO, editor of the WASHINGTON INDEPENDENT, a newspaper
described as part of the Underground Press Syndicate, was brought to your
attention in May 1967 by Robert ACKERMAN.) CIA employee, who resides in
the same apartment house as DE BAGGIO and who was concerned about
meeting De BAGGIO because of the nature of the paper published by De
BAGGIO. OS conducted inquiries on De BAGGIO and furnished the results to
Mr. GOODWIN's office who had had a request from De BAGGIO to verify
COLENIEWSKI's CIA employment. At the time De BAGGIO called GOODWIN's
office he mentioned he knew Herman KIMSEY but had not seen him recently.
GOODWIN's office gave De BAGGIO a "No comment" reply. Of interest is
Mr. SAYLE's' memo for the record dtd 6 June 1967 in which he speculates
that Capital Hill editor for the WASHINGTON INDEPENDENT, Charles BOISE,
may be identical to Carl BLOISE, new Washington correspondent for
the PEOPLE's WORLD and reputed stringer for SUNDAY RAMPARTS.

Also, of note is the fact that De BAGGIO appeared on the same
Barry FARBER show as noted above for Guy RICHARDS.

SPECTRUM
OS indices are negative on SPECTRUM. (NOTE: Speculation would be

that SPECTRUM may be a new name for the WASHINGTON INDEPENDENT. This
could be verified. )
