GOLEN IEWSKI, Michael

- C #240003, Vols. I through X

Review of VOIs.. IX and X of the OS file on Michael GOLENIEWSKI

reveals that the Director of Security is cognizant of latest develop-

ments in Subj√©ct's claims against the Agency. The latest memorandum

in the file dated 3 August 1967 recommended that a final stand be taken

with GOLENIEWSKI; that no further efforts be made to placate him and

observed that the news media is no longer listening to his pretension

to be the Crown Prince Alexi ROMANOFF. Vols. IX and X attached.

Attached also is a memo to the DCI dtd 10 November 1966 which is an

analysis of the book.

GOLENIEWSKI and his views on the CIA. RICHARDS' replies were critical

of the Agency. Quote RICHARDS: "Now, let's take a look, for example,

at the Central Intelligence Agency in the year 1967.

If history were

ever to be made of the great American bureaucracy, I think it quite

correct to say that they would pause and pay homage to a remarkable

fact,

namely, that in the form of the Central Intelligence Agency, there

has suddenly been created and evolved a great idea, namely, the idea of

combining the FBI with Santa Claus with the British East India Company

with Barnum & Bailey and the Ringling Bros. Circus. And before we

get lost in the derision that this implies, let's take pause on two

very positive possibilities. One, that this may not be such a bad

idea at that. It may take its form among the great diversions."

WASHINGION INDEPENDENT - #524424 (De BAGGIO, Thomas )

Thomas De BAGGIO, editor of the WASHINGTON INDEPENDENT, a newspaper

described as part of the Underground Press Syndicate, was brought to your

attention in May 1967 by Robert ACKERMAN, CIA employee, who resides in

the same apartment house as De BAGGIO and who was concerned about

meeting De BAGGIO because of the nature of the paper published by De

BAGGIO. OS conducted inquiries

on De BAGGIO and furnished the results to

Mr. GOODWIN's office who had had a request from De BAGGIO to verify

GOLFINIEWSKI's CIA employment. At the time De BAGGIO called GOODWIN's

office he mentioned he knew Herman KIMSEY but had not seen him recently.

GOODWIN's office gave De BAGGIO a "No comment" reply.

Of interest is

Mr. SAYLE's memo for the record ata 6 June 1967 in which he speculates

that Capital Hill editor for the WASHINGTON INDEPENDENT, Charles BOISE,

may be identical to Carl BLOISE, new Washington correspondent for

the PEOPLE's WORLD and reputed stringer for SUNDAY RAMPARTS.

Also, of note is the fact that De BAGGIO appeared on the same

Barry FARBER show as noted above for Guy RICHARDS.

SPECTRUM

OS indices are negative on SPECTRUM. (NOTE: Speculation would be

that SPECTRUM may be a new name for the WASHINGION INDEPENDENT. This

could be verified.)

MEMORANDUM FOR :

Office of Security

CI/ DDP

SUBJECT

:

Thomas De Baggio

"Washington Independent"

1. An individual identifying himself as Thomas

De Baggio of "The Washington Independent" telephoned

this office on 20 March in an effort to determine if

we could confirm that:

a. Col. Goleniewski had worked for the Agency

which now is holding some of his belongings without

which he cannot prove that he is a Romanov.

b. Herman Kinsey "former Chief of Research

and Analysis for CIA" is working with Goleniewski

because Kinsey knows he is Romanov."

2. De Baggio said he knows Kinsey but has not seen

him recently.

3. Our answer to above was the explanation that we

neither confirm nor deny published statements concerning

us, whether true or false, favorable or derogatory, because

of our responsibilities under the National Security Act.

4. De Baggio gave his telephone number as 532-4499. An

individual of the same name and with the same phone number is

listed in the directory at 6100 - 26th N. Arlington, Virginia.

Neither this office nor the Library has any record

of De Baggio or "The Washington Independent." Any information

known to addressedwould be appreciated.

Assistant to the Director
