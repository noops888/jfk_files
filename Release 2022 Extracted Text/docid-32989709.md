This is to set forth apparent inconsistencies in the logic

used by the House Select Committee on Intelligence in its effort to

castigate the FBI for its investigative effort in the domestic security

field.

Quotes herein are extracted from the "Draft

Final Report!' dated 1/19/76 of the House

Select Committee. The quotes are followed

by the page number wherein they appear in

the report.

The Committee maintains that "the FBI has been unable

to prove any illegal or questionable relationship between the SWP

and the Fourth International" (page 214); and that the FBI has failed

"to uncover even one questionable activity by this political party"

(215); and that "considerable resources have been allocated to com-

pound the error of a continuing unproductive investigation' (217).

This, it is alleged, has caused Americans to be concerned "about

privacy invasions of domestic security investigations" (218).

As concerns the Counterintelligence Program (Cointelpro),

the Committee states the program, though aimed at "identifying,

penetrating and neutralizing subversive elements" (314), consisted of

"'myriad clandestine dirty tricks" (314). "The FBI justilles this

aberration from traditional law enforcement programs by stating

that it was dictated by the mood of the times" (315).

Memorandum to Mr. W. R. Wannall

Re: Houstudy

62-116464

Not satisfied with the above types of sweeping condemna-

tions, which in effect maintain that the FBI has set itself up as "the

barometer of the country's mood" (315), which does not qualify it

"to review peoples politics" (315), the Committee nevertheless feels

free to condemn the FBI for not having done enough in the internal

security area. The Committee states that "it is obvious that the FBI

failed to anticipate groups dedicated to the overthrow of the existing

government...

" (218-219); and further "the FBI provided staff

attorneys with a detailed after-the-fact history ot the SLA. However,

the FBI was apparently unable to anticipate the formation of the group

or thwart its initial criminal activities" (underscoring added)

(219, note 400).

The Committee's position therefore is this: if the Bureau,

lacking statutory definition precisely outlining its authority, investi-

gates a group (or individual) because of its potential for criminal,

violent or subversive activity, or attempts to thwart that group's

activity, that group had better be one the Committee agrees is violent

or subversive. If, on the other hand, the Bureau fails to be prescient,

it is to be criticized for its failure to take preventative action against

a group which the Committee decides, based on the past recora, 1s

"committed to violence" (219).

Apparently this is another instance where we are damned

if we do, and damned if we don't.

ACTION:

None. For information.

Special Investigative and Intelligence Divisions meet with

appropriate Department officials to resolve (1) appropriate

wording setting forth Bureau and/or Department's position

in this matter and recommend inclusion of same in HSC report

Re: Houstudy 75

proprietary in the counterintelligence field represents a

partnership.

On 1/15/76, HSC Staff Member Charles Maddox made

available to Special

Agent Thomas J. McNiff a draft copy

(attached) of material concerning FBI

proprietaries prepared

by him for inclusion in the final report setting forth

the results of HSC inquiry intó FBI operations:

Mr. Maddox

requested that this material, as it pertains to FBI operations,

be reviewed to determine if

such information

requires

classification.

A separate communication has been prepared

responsive to that request. In reviewing the above draft

copy, it was noted that a section of the report was subtitled

"Legal Aspects Concerning Proprietaries." This subsection

states Section, 869, Title 21, U.S.C., which in essence

no corporation shall be created (or Government funds'

used for that purpose) by any officer of agency of the

Federal Government except by an Act of Congress, specifically

authorizing such action. With regard to the FBI's justifi-

cation for the use of incorporated proprietaries, the report

stated that the matter had been referred to the Department

Justice for a decision and unotticially quotes an "51

spokesman as stating the question had never been raised in

house and it was assumed that

approval by the Department of

Justice

at the time such

a proprietary was initiated was

de facto proof that the operation was legal.

Exception was taken to the above statement not

only because of its inaccuracy but because of the blackguardly

tactic of making official an alleged unofficial remarki..

In response to a specific inquiry, Maddox admitted that the

above statement was speculative and no Bureau spokesman told

Thim that the legal authority o proprietary operations had

"not previously been considered. Maddox agreed to withdraw

the above statement but explained that since proprietaries

were currently operating he would have to include in his

report the legal position of the Department and/or the FBI

Maddox then prepared

Conceand a substitute statement attached) which in erect

stated that the legal authority for the operation of

proprietaries is under Department consideration and his

statement concluded that such a decision should have been

made earlier and not after the fact and upon request of the

'HSC. Maddox indicated, in the absence of a specific decision

from the Department, he would utilize the above statement.

It was explained to

Maddox at this point that a Bureau

representative could not speak for the Department and a

call was placed for Mr. Steven Blackhurst, Deputy Special

Counsel for Intelligence Coordination, to come to the FBI

Building to review the above longhand statement. Mr. Blackhurst,

after reviewing the statement, advised that he could not

speak for the Department's position in this matter and it

agreed that Maddox would withhold the draft copy of his

(report until approximately 1/21/76 at which time Blackhurst

agreed to contact Maddox with the Department's position if

such had been formulated.

OBSERVATIONS:

Legal Counsel Division is aware that the Department

currently has under study the legal authority for use of

incorporated proprietaries. It is noted that the Department,

prior to the HSC inquiry, was cognizant that the two

proprietaries in question involved corporations. If the

Department on such short notice is unable to legally justify

the operation of these proprietaries, it appears that two

courses of action remain open to the Department. One would

be to maintain that the matter is currently under consideration

while the second is a statement that the Department can find

no legal justification for these operations. In the latter

event it would appear the two operations would have to be

discontinued in the immediate future. Either of the above

two positions would appear to reflect unfavorably upon the

Department as the former infers that the Department had not

considered Section 869, Title 21, U.S.C., while the latter

admits the Department had at the very least knowledge of an

operation, which operation was in violation of a Federal

statute.

It would appear that the interest of this Bureau

could best be served by the Department engaging in thorough

research to determine whether the above-stated statute applies

to operations approved by Government officials and designed

to serve the best interests of the country by nof aisclosing

'Government participation in the operation or to/the existence

of another statute permitting these type operations.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

That representatives of Legal Counsel, Special

Investigative and Intelligence Divisions meet with appropriate

Department officials to resolve:

1) Appropriate wording setting forth the Bureau

and/or Department's position in the above matter and

recommend to Maddox inclusion of this wording in the HSC

report being prepared by him.

Legal Aspects Concerning Proprietaries

A major issue raised by the committee at the

time our investigation was started was addressed®

each of the military services and the FBI. This

issue was "what is your justification for establish-

ing a proprietary, normally a corporation, as a

front for carrying out an intelligence mission?"

• .

The Committce raised this question because

section 869 of Title 21, U.S. Codd (1970) states in

part as follows:

NW 68262 Rocld: 32989709 Page 12.

62-116468-276

---

## Page 13

"(a) No corporation shall be created, organized

or acquired on or after December 6, 1945, by any

officer or agency of the Federal Government of by

any Government corporation for the purpose of act-

ing as an agency or instrumentality of the

United States, except by Act of Congress specifi-

cally authorizing such action.

(b) No wholly owned Government corporation

created by or under the laws of any State,

Territory or possession of the United States

or any political sub-division thereof, or under

the laws of the District of Columbia,

shall con-

tinue after June 30, 1948, as an agency or

instrumentality of the United States, and no

funds of, or obtained from, the United States

ox any agency thereof, including corporations,

shall

be invested in or employed by any such

corporation after that date except for the pur-

poses of liquidation. ***"

The General Accounting Office in a letter to

the Committee Chairman dated December 10, 1975

(B-179296) which discussed the applicability of

section 869 to the authority for CIA to establish

proprietaries stated in reference to the legislative

history of the act stated "we have found no indica-

tion in the legislative history that Congress con-

sidered the formation of coxporations for clandes-

tine purposes."

While it is recognized that the purpose of

proprietaries is to conceal the role of the govern-

ment in clandestine activities, the lack of legis-

lative history concerning formation of clandestine

corporations must be accoptod. Thus, section 869

piecludes the formation of proprictary corporations

except by Act of Congress:

NW:68262 Docld:32989709 Page 13

---

## Page 14

As discussed

in the following paragraphs, the

Military services disagieed strongly with the Com

mittee position in this matter. As an example, the

Army stated in essence that the provisions of sec-

tion 869 should not be applied to corporations es-

tablished for intelligence purposes by the Army

because cover corporations do not, by their nature,

represent themselves as agents of the U.S. govern-

ment and do not engage in any business activity.

The Navy, with a somewhat different ayproach,

stated that proprietaries are established for the

sole purpose of facilitating the collection of

intelligence. The Navy further stated that the

purpose of establishing a proprietary is to

provide a shield of non-attribution and that it

would be impossible to act as a U.S. government

representative without destroying the cover of

non-attribution.

The Ai: Force justified the use of proprietaries

by citing in-house approvals and approvals by the

• CIA and the Defense Intelligence Agency.

The Air

Force stated in part "Justification existed in the

need

for cover for clandestine foreign intelligence

collection activities."

• In summary, the military services have justifica

the use of proprictaries on a rather pragmatic basis

which states in essence proprictarios are

approved

NW 68262 Docld:32989709 Page 14

---

## Page 15

in accordance with regulations, cleared by other

agencies in the intelligence community, and could

not exist for intelligence purposes if it were

known that the U.S. government had an interest in

the operation of the corporation.

The FBI has referred the legal question

as to

whether-they

can operate, a proprietary to the Depart-

ment of Justice for a decision. Unofficially an

• FBI spokesman stated the question

has never been

raised

in-house and they assumed that approval by

the Department of Justice at the time each proprietary

was

initiated was de facto proof that the operation.

was legal.

The Department of Justice is

still 're-

L viewing the legal basis for their past approvals.

Conclusion

The Committee agrees that a non-attributable

• method of providing cover for intelligence missions

is a necessity and that a corporate structure is

possibly the best way of obtaining this objective.

• The Committee does not take issue with the fact

that regulations spell out policy guidelines and

operating procedures and that there are apparently

sufficient controls to protect the interests of

the government. However, under present law, the

formation of corporations without the consent of

Congress is not lawful.

•'

• We believe therefore, if proprictaries are to

NW 68262 Docld:32989709 Page 15

be continued, the Congress must enact legislation

to continue this form of covert operation.

REQUEST FOR DECLASSIFICATION

OF CERTAIN FBI DOCULENTS

Reference is made to ISC letter dated December I1g

1975, which requested that certain docusents referred to

during the ISO hearing of Novenber 18, 1975, be declassified

for inclusion in the uSC report.

Certain of these documents in question pertain

to the Administrative pages of an FBI report on the

Institute for tolicy studies (les), dated March l4y 1305.

This document,

along with others-ner originally furnished

to the ISC on

November 14, 1975, in accordance with

Instructions received from the Department of Justice

in response to a requent from the use.

It is the FBI's position that this document,

even though it is unclassifted, should not be released

to the public.

In an effort to be responsive to the HSC's

request, it was agreed at a meeting on Jamary 7, 1976,

between Is. Ellen Miller of the HSC staff and FBI

representatives, that the following explanation regarding

the cover pages of the aforenentioned report would suflice

INTERVIEW OF ASSISTANT TO THE DIRECTOR THOMAS J. JENKINS

BY TIM OLIPHANT OF THE HOUSE COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE

CONCERNING U. S. RECORDING COMPANY

On December 9, 1975, I was interviewed by Tim Oliphant

of the House Select Committee. Present at the interview was SÁ John

Dennis Miller of the Offide of Legal Counsel. Oliphant first informed

me that the Chairman, Mr. Pike, of the Committee was interested in

the Bureau personnel's relationship with Joe Tait of the U. S. Record-

ing Company. He pointed out that the Bureau had bought a substantial

amount of equipment from the U. S. Recording Company and had used

that company as a "cut out." He stated that because of these purchases

the Committee was interested in the poker games held at the Blue Ridge

Rod and Gun Club since people interested in procurement for the FBi

and CIA were present at these poker parties:

Oliphant asked me when I first met Tait. I told him that to

the best of my recollection it was at the first time I went up to the Gun

Club where he was present. I told him I first went up there in the Fall

of 1971 or the Spring of 1972 and had been up there on 5 or 6 occasions

since that time. Oliphant also wanted to know if I knew Gus Oberdick.

I replied in the affirmative and he asked me when I first met Oberdick.

I told him I thought I first met him at Quantico at our firearms range

when he was exhibiting some of his equipment and thereafter I had been

with him up at the Gun Club. He asked me if I had ever been assigned

to the Administrative Division. I told him that when I first came in the

FBI as a clerk I worked in the Mechanical Section and the Photographic

Laboratory and these were under the Chief Clerk of the Bureau which

Assoc, Dir.

was later designated as the Administrative Division. I told him that I

y' Interview of Assistant to the Director Thomas J. Jenkins

by Tim Oliphant of the House Committee on Intelligence

Concerning I. S. Recording Company

;

any business was discussed at these poker parties and I replied in the

negative. lie wanted to lnow if I had ever in my position in the Bureau

recommendod any cupplies or equipment be purchased by the Eureau

from Tait or Oberdick. I told him "no"; that all requests for material

were sent to deadquarters, along with specifications and that as far as

I'new, the Eureau either bought material oft the Covernment Scheaule

or sent out invitations to bid. I did point out to him that I lonew that dur

ing: the Wounded nee oporation tve needed a large supply ot flares and

tear ras in a hurry and that Cberdic's got up in the middle of the night

ond arranced to shin by plans all the supplies he had and arranged for

us to get additional supplies from, I believe, Cleveland, ad as a result

we had the necescary flares and tear gas in Wounded nee the next day.

Oliphant acked me it I had associated with Tait socially or

at any other time other than at the Cun Club. I told him that I had attended

2 or 3 lunches where he was present at the Carriage House in Ceorgetown.

Ee then assed me it Tait picked up the tab and I told him, not to my knowl-

ede. He asked it I knew if there was a safe un at the Gun Club and I told

him that I never recall seeing one but that does not mean there was not

one there because there were parts of the building I was never in.

In conclusion, Oliphant advised that they had been up at the

Gun Club the day aiter the fire and he further stated that the Club vas

sold two weeks prior to the fire to a James Clark of Clark Interprises

which has tho same address as the Hyman Construction Company.

Oliphant was most pleasant during the intervier and stated

he tolt that this war just a noter party.

By letter dated December 31, 1975, A. Searle Fiela,

Staff Director of the House Select Committee on Intelligence, complained

to the Attorney General concerning FBI interviews. His letter stated that

they would appreciate a Justice Department review of whether the FBI's

conduct violated Federal laws protecting Congressional witnesses as well

as Federal statutes concerning procurement procedures.

Attached is a carbon of the reply letter from the Deputy

Attorney General which I understand was signed by the Deputy on

January 7, 1976. The concluding paragraph advises Chairman Pike

of the Committee that the Department "will investigate this matter

immediately to determine whether any undue pressure was exerted

on Mr. Kaiser in violation of federal law."

While the letter does not indicate the form of the Department

investigation, I have been advised that the inquiry will be supervised

by Michael Shaheen acting in his capacity as Head of the Office of

Professional Responsibility and that the inquiry will be conducted by the

Criminal Division of the Department.

In accordance with the instructions of the Attorney Day

General on 1/8/76, Charles Maddox, House Select Committee Staff

Member, reviewed the balance sheets and other financial data

pertaining. to the Bureau proprietaries.

Maddox, after review

of these materials, stated that there would be no more requests

for disclosure of information concerning Bureau proprietaries

and that this would satisfy the Committee's needs.

Maddox did,

however, ask that the Bureau advise him whether there are in

existence any

internal regulations concerning the operation of

proprietaries, whether the Bureau's operation of proprietaries

are in violation or section 869 of litle 31 of the u. s. Code

and ask the Bureau

to work with him in the preparation of a

short paragraph on proprietaries for the Committee's publid

report.

The Department of Justice is, at the request of

Maddox, responding to the question relating to Title 31, U.s.

Code, Section 869.

This particular response is being co-

ordinated with Assistant Special Counsel for Intelligence

Coordination Steven Blackhurst. Responses to the other in-

formation he requesteã Ällbeing coordinated by the Intelligence

Division.

REQUEST FOR DECLASSIFICATION

0F CERTAIN FBI DOCUDITIS

Reference is Dude to HSC letter dated December 11,

1975, nich requested that certain documents referred to

during the ISC hearing of loverber 18, 1975, be declasalfied

for Inclusion 13 the ISC report.

Certain of these doeuments in question portain

to the targets of varrantless electronic surveillances and

targots of surreptitious entrios. Thosa documents vere

originally furnished to the HiSC in accordance vich inscructions

received fron the Lepartment of Justice in response to

certain requests as contained in HSC letter dated

cetober 15, 1975.

It is the FBI's position that these docurents,

even though they are unclassitied, should not be reloased

to the public. It is believed that a close study and revier

of thase documents by a hostile foreiga intelligence service

could provide an insight into the IDl'g successes and/os

resources in the foreign counterintelligence field. this

is so notwithstonding the fact that the documents in question

NTE:

Attached to the yellow of this memorandum is a

copy of referenced HSC request along with a copy of the

documents the HSC desires to include in its report. It is

noted the figures being furnished the HSC to be made public

in lieu of the documents in question are the figures

previously furnished by Attorney General (AG) Levi lo

Senator Edward Kennedy by letter 6/24/75 in connection with

the Subcommittee on Administrative Practice and Procedure

inquiry into Federal agencies' practice in the electronic

surveillance field. In addition, the AG provided the

figures to Congressman Rodino of the House Committee on the

Judiciary and to Senator Church of the Senate Select Committee.

These figures are being proffered as they are already in

the

public domain and it is felt any study of them by a hostile

foreign intelligence service would prove of no value.

This

matter was discussed on 12/19/75 by Section Chief William n.

Gregar and SA Andrew J. Duffin with Douglas Marvin, Special

Assistant to the AG, who advised that the AG agrees in this

response.

INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES

conference attended by SA Paul V. Daly of the

Legal counsel master, sa John Mchale of the Special Investigative

Division, Michael E. Shaheen, JI., Special Counsel for Intelligence

Coordination in the Department, and his Assistant, Ray Hornblower,

it was explained that captioned Committee Counsel Aaron Donner had

complained to the White House concerning the Bureau's refusal to

furnish requested information on this matter.

The White House

requested they be advised by the Department of the Bureau's position

and reasons thereof. Additionally, Pete Hughes, Staff Member Of

captioned Committee, had telephonically complained to Shaheen con-

cerning this matter. Shaheen also explained that the Assistant

Attorney General of the Civil Division Rex Lee who is the Attorney

General's personal advisor concerning problems surrounding House

and Senate Select Committee requests requested he be advised con-

cerning this matter.

In a similar request, we afforded the Senate

Select Committee a briefing as opposed to the furnishing of docu-

ments giving as a reason for refusal of furnishing documents that

they involved sensitive on-going investigations.

The considerations

concerning this position are obvious, with regard to the proprie-

taries operated by the Intelligence Division, they are sensitive

on-going operations and the proprietaries operated by the Special

Investigative Division if disclosed could jeopardize the lives of

Agents and/or informants and could ultimately adversely impact on

possible prosecutions.

AND RICHARD VERMERE, STAFF MEMBERS

- HOUSE SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE

Telephond Rm. -

Director Sec'y _

9:30 AM, 12/17/75

The captioned staff members were brought to the writer's office by

John Hotis of the Legal Counsel Division and left the writer at approximately

20:15 AM on 12/17/75. The purpose of their request for the interview had been

indicated to inquire into the writer's participation at poker games at the Blue Ridge

Club sponsored by Joe Tait, President of U. S. Recording Company.

Mr. Oliphant stated the purpose of the interview was as indicated above

and also asked if they could inquire into the writer's knowledge and/or participation

in connection with the purchase of equipment from the U. S. Recording Company.

Upon inquiry Mr. Oliphant was informed that the writer had participated

in a poker party at the Blue Ridge Club on two or three occasions but not on any

occasion within the last six or so years. He was also informed that Mr. Mohr

was present on these occasions and served as a collector for the fee for the cost

of lodging and food on the occasions the writer attended. He was informed that

Vir. Tait and Mr. Oberdick were probably present; however, no business of any

kind was discussed; it being purely a social event with the primary purpose of getting

away from shop and shop-talk. He was further advised on the occasions that the

(writer was in attendance former Assistant Director Donald Parsons was the host

member of the Blue Ridge Club. In response to an inquiry as to why the writer had

not attended in more recent years, he was informed that I did not do so after my

youngest son married and left home as I did not care to leave the Mrs. alone for

the night in our residence.

Mr. Oliphant also inquired as to any other contacts I may have had with

Messrs. Tait and Oberdick and I informed him that there was no close social

relationship such as visiting back and forth in one another's residences; however,

I had encountered them at weddings of the children of theirs and/or mutual friends,

but on these occasions no business was discussed. I further pointed out that Mr. Tait

had a summer place on the Delaware

Coast in the arewhere I likewise had one and on

matures

a few occasions he has ridden by to

hello but has not visited extensively nor

was any business discussed during th

visits.

Memo to the Director

Re: Interview by Messrs. Timothy Oliphant and

Richard Vermere, Staff Members, House

Select Committee on Intelligence

Messrs. Oliphant and Vermere inquired as to the origin of the

relationship with U. S. Recording Company and at what level was the price for

the equipment purchased from U. S. Recording determined to be satisfactory.

The writer informed them the writer's recollection of the relationship with

the U.S. Recording Company dated back to the lates 30's or early 40's and

the procedure of purchasing confidential types of equipment was an ongoing

procedure at the time the writer became involved in the Administrative Division.

(I stated there was no fixed procedure for ascertaining the precise price oR

any markup relative thereto inasmuch as the nature of the items purchased were

such that primary reliance was left to the technicians of our Laboratory who

had shopped the industry for the equipment needed and that any detailed discussion

regarding price would normally go through the Procurement Officer of the

Administrative Division and the technicians in the Laboratory to see that a

reasonable price was being paid but not an absurb or unreasonable price.

It was

pointed out that procurement procedures in effect would require any questionable

price to be taken up with higher authority either in the Laboratory or the

Administrative Division to adjudicate such a question and to the writer's recollection

there had been no occasions when this had occurred.

Mr. Vermere inquired as to Mr. Mohr's relationship with the Laboratory

in connection with his position as Assistant to the Director and I pointed out that

there were times when the Laboratory was one of the Divisions under his jurisdiction

and I was sure that the organizational charts they had would seem to indicate this.

They inquired if I were aware of the fact that the Blue Ridge Club had

suffered a fire and I advised them I had read it in the newspaper and they advised

when they became aware of it was listening to the radio when they were going to

visit the club having heard the newscast concerning it.

Mr. Vermere inquired as to whether there was any inquiry being made

into the Bureau's dealings with the U. S. Recording Company and he was informed

Director Kelley had instructed an inquiry to be made into the matter right after

the testimony of Mr. Kaiser before the Committee for which they work. Upon

inquiry whether there was any information available as to developments to date with

regard to this matter, they were informed since this was an ongoing inquiry it

would be inappropriate at this time to discuss such with them. When asked when

the inquiry would be completed, they were informed it would be concluded very soon

Memo to the Director

Re: Interview by Messrs. Timothy Oliphant and

Richard Vermere, Staff Members, House

Select Committee on Intelligence

as the Director was just as anxious as the Committee was to have the full picture

with regard to this situation.

During this discussion Vermere alluded as to the

volume of the purchase made in 1971 which information had been previously

furnished to the Committee and it was pointed out that these purchases resulted

from the break-in of our Resident Agency in Media, Pennsylvania, and the use

of U. S. Recording was two-fold; one, to preserve the confidentiality of the type

of equipment being installed throughout the country in our Resident Agencies and

second, to obtain expedite delivery in connection with such equipment.

I also advised Messrs. Oliphant and Vermere that purchases other

than those of a confidential nature were made from U. S. Recording Company of

items on which he was the supplier under the GSA general supply schedule and

where purchases on a competitive bid basis were made by soliciting bids for items

of equipment under this latter procedure he being on the bidder's mailing list

along with other manufacturers and suppliers. I pointed out that procurement

of all equipment adheres to the Federal Procurement Regulations prescribed by

the General Services Administration.

QUESTIONS CONCERNING THE ROLE OF PROPRIETARIES

WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE

1:

Authority of the Military service to initiate, use, and

liquidate a corporation, foreign or domestic.

(a) Does this authority contravene in any way

the apparent prohibitions set forth in Title 31,

U.S. Code paragraph 869? Discuss as necessary.

2. On an individual basis (proprietary by proprietary)

please answer the following:

- where and when incorporated

- military justification for establishing a

corporation - who or at what level it was

approved?

-- initial capital outlay ?

in general terms what service did (or does) the

proprietary perform?

what type of intelligence is gained, if any?

Number of reports rendered by fiscal year?

In this connection, it is recognized there are

basically two types of missions (1) support and (2)

operational. If the mission is in support of

another proprietary, such as lunding etc., the

question is not applicable.

provide copies of profit and loss statements and

Balance Sheets for each fiscal year of operation.

-- if the corporation has been liquidated or

sold

give details. Who or at what level was the action

approved? What happened to the assets, etc.?

- were local, state or federal tax or information

returns filed by the corporation? If so, were

any local, stat e, or federal tax audits con-

ducted? Were any tax audits deferred through

agreement with taxing authorities to maintain the

quisi nature of the operation? If so, explain.

- average number of personnel employed by the

Miticartion each fiscal yeat: 621164604-265

Military?

-- were the civilian personnel witting or in-

witting as to the true ownership and mission

of the corporation.

-- what if any pension program exists or did

exist for civilian personnel.

In broad terms

outline a representative case of employee

benefits accruing under the pension program.

- Number of employees currently under the pro-

gram; pensioners? current contributors!

if the pension program is covered by a

commercial insurance company how is non-

attribution, i.e., secrecy maintained?

--are any assets held by the proprietary corpora-

tions insured comnercially = types of insur-

ance.

what controls are maintained to protect the

governments interest in the assets of the

corporation? •i.e., what controls are main-

tained over current or fixed assets and shares

•of stock issued in the corporate name?

- what interface is there with the intelligence

community to assure non duplication of effort.

i.e., does CIA, DCI and others know and approve

the formation of each proprietary and/or pro-

vide support of either a direct or indirect

• nature - explain.

It is probable that all the above questions are not

applicable to all proprietaries under your control.

RE: INTERVIEN OF FORMER FBI ASSISTANT

TO THE DIRECIOR JOIN P. MOLE BY

HSC STAFF MEMBERS

Set out balow is information voluntarily furnished

by telephone to the IBI by Mr. Mohr following his interview

by representatives of the Staff of the HSC in Washington, D. G.,

• November 19, 1975.

On the afternoon of Novenber 19, 1975, Mohr advised

that he had just concluded an interview conducted by Nichard

Vermeire and Tin Oliphant of the HSC Staff. The intervior tas

not under oats and not recorded.

liohr was asked concerning

the U. S. Recording Company's (USNC) arrangements with tho

I'BL for the purchase of electronic surveillance equipment

lohr responded that a foret Assistant Director in charge of the

FBI Laboratory, Ed Coffey, apparently had previously made

arrangements with the USC for the confidential purchase of

electronic surveillance equipment in behalf of the FBI and when

dohz becone the Assistant Director in charge of the Administrative

DIViSIon, he siuply concinued such arrongenents.

Ile said he

knew ai no specific decisions that were made to buy through

Vr. Tait of the USRE.

time to time requesting authorization to make purchases of

electronic surveillance equipment when the amounts involved vero

U. S. House Select Committee

to Study Governmental Operations

With Respect to Intelligence Activities (HSC)

Re:

Intervlew of Former FBI Assistant to the

Director John P. Mohr by HSC Staff Members

He said that he was aware that Tait had treated Bureau purchases

as confidential and that in the past Tait has not divulged

Bureau Interests.

Mohr said that Tait's usual fee for handling

purchases was a 10% to 15% mark-up plus a reasonable labos

charge in cases where modification of equipment was necessary.

Mohr was asked whether Tait was paid as a confidential source

of the Bureau.

Piohr first denied same, but then considered

the fact that Tait's company was used as a

"out out"

and that

the fee paid to Tait for such service could have been considered

payments to a confidential source for services rendered. He

was asked whether Tait had charged a 30% mark-up as alleged by

Martin Kaiser,

Mohr responded that he was not aware of instances

involving a 30% mark-up and, if such occurred, it would have

been in excess of the usual

fee paid to Tait.

Mohr advised that he was confronted by Vermeire and

Oliphant with statements allegedly made by William Harward of

the FBI Laboratory which seemed to imply that the Laboratory

referred the

requests to purchase equipment to the Administrative

Division and that lohr auchorized purchases through the UsRe.

Mohr indicated that the arrangements for purchasing through the

USRC were based on Laboratory Division requests and not on

Administrative Division or his own requests.

He commented that

in regard to testimony by Martin Kaiser, It appeared that the

FBI Laboratory had made arrangements to purchase material

confidentially through the UsRe and then went directly to the

Martin Kaiser Company, specifying the purchase order requests,

and thereby revearing the fbl as a purchaser from Kaiser. He

said that such direct contact by the Laboratory made the

arrangements with USRG appear to be unnecessary and difficult

to explain.

Concluding, Mohr advised that it was not indicated to

him one way or the other

whether he would be called as a

witness

before the Hise.

It should be noted that Mohr was released from his

confidentiality agreement with the FBI for the purpose of the

above interview, release predating the actual interview.

at the Los Angeles

wished to offer his assistance as an informant as

zation of which is contained in the appendix hereto,

of former leaders and events concerning the BPP.

Darthard Perry advised he was a 1969 Los

Angeles BPP chapter applicant but that he had never

been admitted to membership and had never participated

in activities of the BPP.

February 12, 1974, Darthard Perry claimed he was

DARTHARD MAURICE EDWARD PERRY

Darthard Perry described the Watts

Writer's Workshop as a theatrical

work group providing a forum for

the expression and promotion of

black theatrical talent, founded

in August, 1965.

From March 5, 1974, until March 21, 1975,

Darthard Perry was in active FBI informant status.

The BPP had ceased to be a viable organization in

the Los Angeles, California area by 1972. Darthard

Perry was never

guided, directed, or targeted by

any FBI Agent to penetrate the BPP as it had ceased

to exist in the Los Angeles area, nor to penetrate

the Watts Writer's Workshop in Los Angeles, California,

and the FBI has never conducted an investigation of

the Watts Writer's Workshop. Darthard Perry never

furnished any information concerning Watts Writer's

Workshop activities or personnel.

However, Darthard Perry did furnish infor-

mation to the Los

Angeles FBI of various extremist

individuals identified as former members of the BPP,

principally members or followers of the Black

Liberation Army (BIA), a characterization of which

is contained in the appendix hereto.

On May 31, 1974, Perry advised that Renee

"peaches" Moore, was urging

urban guerrilla warfare in the black community of

Los Angeles, California, and that she was in contact

with a BLA member, John William Washington, also

known as Long John.

On June 5, 1974, Perry advised that Byron

walter Bartlett, a

former

BPP activist had applied

for and was seeking to obtain employment as a police

officer by the Los Angeles Police Department without

his prior

background being known to that law

enforcement agency.

DARTHARD MAURICE EDWARD PERRY

On June 19, 1974, Perry advised that "peaches"

Moore went to San Francisco, California, on Monday,

June 17, 1974, following her appearance on a radio

talk show at station KPFK-FM, North Hollywood, Calif-

ornia, on which she advocated urban guerrilla warfare.

On June 24, 1974, Perry advised he attended

of a BLA cell led by

Conversation centered

on ways to free Elmer Gerard

Pratt, also known as "Geronimo"

, a former BPP leader.

and titular head of the California BLA, Incarcerated

in San Quentin Prison for life on a murder charge.

The conversation concerned emulating Arab terrorist

groups and planning a jail break which would be a more

efficient Marin County shoot out.

On June 24, 1974, Perry advised that Long

John Washington was contacting Perry telephonically

from Pomona, California.

Washington refused to

furnish a telephone number or residence.

Washington

has refused to allow pictures to be taken of him or

his group. On July 5, 1974, Perry advised Long John

BLACK LIBERATION ARMY

The Black Liberation Army (BLA) is a loose-

knit urban guerrilla organization whose self-described

purpose is to overthrow the Government. In announcing

the BLA's purpose, the 2/29/72 issue of "Right On!,"

its official publication stated. . . "The purpose of the

BLA is the same as that of the Tupamaros in Uruguay,

Frelimo in Mozambique, and all the other liberation forces:

The BIA is simply brothers and sisters who have gone

underground to put all the revolutionary rhetoric and

theory into practice. ?.."

Since May, 1971, the BLA has been involved in

armed confrontations with

law enforcement officials

resulting in eight police officers being killed and

another 28 being wounded or injured. Since July, 1971,

the BLA has been involved in excess of 20 known bank

robberies totaling over $494, 000, which money is used to

finance it's activities.

BLACK PANTHER PARTY

FORMERLY KNOWN AS THE BLACK PANTHER PARTY FOR SELF-DEFENSE

The Black Panther Party (BPP), organized in December,

1966, at Oakland, California, by Huey P. Newton and Bobby George

Seale, has the publicly-stated purpose of organizing black

people to take control of the life, politics and destiny of

the black community. The Party, operating the Black Panther

Intercommunal News Service, publishes a newspaper called

"The Black Panther," which at one time openly advocated the

use of guns and guerrilla tactics in a revolutionary program

to end the oppression of the black people but since early

1971 has spoken for a survival program pending revolution.

BEP national headquarters, aka Black Panther Intercom-

munal Headquarters, is located in Oakland, California.

While openly advocating direct overthrow of the

U. S. Government by force and violence until 1971, leaders

have since avoided extreme statements in favor of calling

for action within the established order. Newton, in an

interview appearing in the May, 1973, issue of "Playboy"

magazine, stated the Panthers'

chief

ambition is to change

the American Government by, any means necessary but that

ultimately such change will be through armed violence.

Despite its claimed dedication to community service,

indicators of the BPP's continued attraction to violence persist.

Since July, 1974, Newton and other BPP members have been arrested

in Oakland, California, for threatening police officers,

murder of a 17-year-old female and the pistol whipping of

Newton's tailor. Newton failed to appear on these charges and

Is now a Local tugitive. haditionally, one died and three

were wounded as a result of a shooting at a BPP-sponsored

dance in Oakland, California, in October, 1974.

SYMBIONESE LIBERATION ARMY

The Symbionese Liberation Army (SLA) was reportedly

formed in the Summer of 1973, in California. An SIA

document captioned, "Declaration of Revolutionary War and

the Symbionese Program," dated 8/21/73, states

• . . Therefore,

we of the Symbionese Federation of the SLA

.. . . .

do now, by

the rights of our children and people and by force of arms

and with every drop of our blood, declare revolutionary war

against the fascist, capitalist class.

We support by

force of arms the just struggles of all oppressed people

for self-determination and independence within the

United States and the world, and hereby offer to all

Liberation movements, revolutionary

• workers' groups and

peoples' organizations our total aid and support for the

struggle for freedom and justice for all people and races . . ."

The SLa has claimed credit for the 11/6/73 assassination of

Di. Marcus Foster, Oakland, California, School Superintendent;

the 2/4/74 kidnaping of Patricia Campbell Hearst, daughter

of newspaper publisher-owner Randolph A. Hearst; and the

4/15/74 robbery of the Hibernia Bank, San Francisco,

California, in the furtherance of its revolutionary

objectives.

Six members of the SlA were involved in a

shoot-out with the FBI and Los Angeles, California, police

on 5/17/74, resulting in their deaths.

Although no

current information has been developed indicating the

group has been active in areas other than California, other

groups and individuals have surfaced claiming adherence

to the SLA's revolutionary tenets.

perforns nathematical and related calculations associated

with the FBI's cryptographic examination efforts.

The FBI, an agency of approsimately 20,000 employees

and an annual budget of $468,700,000, utilizes ADP as an

aiministrative and management tool.

The rBI's payroll is

completely automated. Fersonnel matters, such as pronation
