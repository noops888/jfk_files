re se,
This is to set forth apparent inconsistencies in the logic ae

used by the House Select Committee on Intelligence in its effort to
castigate the FBI for its investigative effort in the domestic security
field.

Lad gp

Quotes herein are extracted from the "Draft

Final Report" dated 1/19/76 of the House

Select Committee. The quotes are followed

by the page number wherein they appear in va
the report.

The Committee maintains that "the FBI has been unable
to prove any illegal or questionable relationship between the SWP
and the Fourth International" (page 214); and that the FBI has failed
"to uncover even one questionable activity by this political party"
(215); and that "considerable resources have been allocated to com-
pound the error of a continuing unproductive investigation" (217),
This, it is alleged, has caused Americans to be concerned "about
privacy invasions of domestic security investigations" (218).

As concerns the Counterintelligence Program (Cointelpro),
the Committee states the program, though aimed at “identifying,
penetrating and neutralizing subversive elements" (314), consisted of
"myriad clandestine digty tricks" (314). "The FBI justifies this
aberration from traditional law enforcement programs by stating
that it was dictated by the mood " the times" (315),

Memorandum to Mr. W. R. Wannall
Re: Houstudy
62-116464

Not satisfied with the above types of sweeping condemna-
tions, which in effect maintain that the FBI has set itself up as "the
barometer of the country's mood" (315), which does not qualify it
"to review peoples politics" (315), the Committee nevertheless feels
free to condemn the FBI for not having done enough in the internal
security area, The Committee states that "it is obvious that the FBI
failed to anticipate groups dedicated to the overthrow of the existing
government... (218-219); and further "the FBI provided staff
attorneys with a detailed after-the-fact history of the SLA. However,
the FBI was apparently unable to anticipate the formation of the group
or thwart its initial criminal activities" (underscoring added)

(19, note 400).

The Committee's position therefore is this: if the Bureau,
lacking statutory definition precisely outlining its authority, investi-
gates a group (or individual) because of its potential for criminal,
violent or subversive activity, or attempts to thwart that group's
activity, that group had better be one the Committee agrees is violent
or subversive. If, on the other hand, the Bureau fails to be prescient,
it is to be criticized for its failure to take preventative action against
a group which the Committee decides, based on the past record, is
"committed to violence" (219),

Apparently this is another instance where we are damned
if we do, and damned if we don't.

None. For information,

Ape
with existingnand/or, district laws, The remaining

proprietary in the counterintelligence field represents a
partnership.

On 1/15/76, HSC Staff Member Charles Maddox made
available to Special Agent Thomas J, McNiff a draft copy
(attached) of material concerning FBI proprietaries prepared
by him for inclusion in the final report setting forth
the results of HSC inquiry into FBI operations, Mr. Maddox
requested that this material, as it pertains to FBI operations,
be reviewed to determine if such information requires
classification, A separate communication has been prepared
responsive to that request. In reviewing the above draft
copy, it was noted that a section of the report was subtitled
“Legal Aspects Concernifg Proprietaries.,"" This- subsection
quotes Section 869, Title 21, U.S.C., which in essence
freezes no corporation shall be created (or Government funds '

sed for that purpose) by any officer or agency of the
Federal Government except by an Act of Congress, specifically
authorizing such action, With regard to the FBI's justifi-
cation for the use of incorporated proprietaries, the report
stated that the matter had been referred to the Department
of Justice for a decision and unofficially quotes an FBI
spokesman as stating the question had never been raised in
house and it was assumed that approval by the Department of
Justice at the time such a proprietary was initiated was

de facto proof that the operation was legal.

Exception was taken to the above statement not
only because of its inaccuracy but because of the blackguardly
tactic of making official an alleged unofficial remark.
In response to a specific inquiry, Maddox admitted that the
above statement was speculative and no Bureau spokesman told
him that the legal authority of proprietary operations had
not previously been considered. Maddox agreed to withdraw

the above statement but explained that since proprietaries
were currently operating he would have to include in his
report the legal position of the Department and/or the FBI
concerning this type of operation. , Maddox then prepared
longhand a substitute statement (attached) which in effect
stated that the legal authority for the operation of
proprietaries is under Department consideration and his
statement concluded that such a decision should have been
made earlier and not after the fact and upon request of the
HSC. Maddox indicated, in the absence of a specific decision
from the Department, he would utilize the above statement.
It was explained to Maddox at this point that a Bureau
representative could not speak for the Department and a
call was placed for Mr, Steven Blackhurst, Deputy Special
Counsel for Intelligence Coordination, to come to the FBI
Building to review the above longhand statement. Mr. Blackhurst,
after reviewing the statement, advised that he could not
speak for the Department's position in this matter and it
was agreed that Maddox would withhold the draft copy of his
report until approximately 1/21/76 at which time Blackhurst
agreed to contact Maddox with the Department's position if
such had been formulated.

OBSERVATIONS :

Legal Counsel Division is aware that the Department
currently has under study the legal authority for use of
incorporated proprietaries, It is noted that the Department,
prior to the HSC inquiry, was cognizant that the two
proprietaries in question involved gorporations. If the
Department on such short notice is unable to legally justify
the operation of these proprietaries, it appears that two
courses of action remain open to the Department. One would

Memorandum to Mr. W. R. Wannall

be to maintain that the matter is currently under consideration
while the second is a statement that the Department can find
no legal justification for these operations. In the latter
event it would appear the two operations would have to be
discontinued in the immediate future, Either of the above
two positions would appear to reflect unfavorably upon the
Department as the former infers that the Department had not
considered Section 869, Title 21, U.S.C., while the latter
admits the Department had at the very least knowledge of an
operation, which operation was in violation of a Federal
statute, It would appear that the interest of this Bureau
could best be served by the Department engaging in thorough
research to determine whether the above-stated statute applies
to operations approved by Government officials and designed
to serve the best interests of the country by not disclosing
Government participation in the operation or to, fe Skistence
of another statute permitting these type operations.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
That representatives of Legal Counsel, Special

Investigative and Intelligence Divisions meet with appropriate
Department officials to resolve:

1) Appropriate wording setting forth the Bureau
and/or Department's position in the aboye matter and

recommend to Maddox inclusion of this wording in the HSC
report being prepared by him.

Legal Aspects Concerning Proprietaries

A major issue raised by the committee at the
time our investigation was started was addressed to
each of the military services and the PRI. This
issue was "what is your justification for establish-
ing a proprietary, normally a corporation, as a
front for carrying out an intelligence mission?"

The Committee raised this question because

Section 869 of Vitle 21, U.S. Code (1970) states in
part as follows:
a

-NNW,68262 .Dacld:329g9709 Page 12

ba Medis- 2416



"(a) No corporation shall be created, organized

or acquired on or after December 6, 1945, by any
officer or agency of the Federal Government or by

any Government corporation for the purpose of act-

: . : img as an agency or instrumentality of the

United States, except by Act of Congress specifi-
cally authorizing such action. iene

{b) No wholly owned Government corporation
created by or under the laws of any State,
Territory or possession of the United States
or any political sub-division thereof, or under
the laws of the District of Columbia, shall ccn-
tinue after June 30, 1948, as an agency or
instrumentality of the United States, and no
funds of, or obtained from, the United States .
or any agency thereof, including corporations,
shall be invested in or employed by any such
corporation after that date except for the pur-
poses of liquidation. ***"  . ‘ =

While it is recognized that the purpose of

proprietaries is to conceal the role of the govern-
ment in clandestine activities, the lack of legis-

“lative history concerning formation of clandestine

corporations must be accepted. Thus, section 869

precludes the ‘formation of proprietary corporations
“ except by Act of Congress,

: As discussed hoe following sacagraptel¥ one
Military services disagreed strongly with the Com-
mittee position in this matter. As an example, the
Army stated in essence that the provisions of sec-
tion 869 should not be applied to corporations es-
tablished for intelligence purposes by the Army
because cover corporations do not, by their nature,
kepresent themselves as agents of the U.S. govern~
ment and do not engage in any business activity.
The Navy, with a somewhat different approach,
stated that proprietaries are established for the
“sole purpose of facilitating the collection of
intelligence. “the Navy further stated that the
purpose of establishing a proprietary is to
provide a shield of non-attribution and that it
would be impossible to act as a U.S. government
wcepresentative without destroying the cover of
non-attribution. : : a
the Air Force justified the usé’of proprietaries
“by citing in-house approvals .and approvals by the +
- CIA and the Defense Intelligence Agency. The Air
Force stated in part "Justification existed in the
need for cover for’ clandestine foreign intelligence
collection activities."
in summary, the military services have justified
the use of proprietaries on a rather pragmatic basis

which ‘states in essence proprictaries are approved

The Committee abrees that a non-attributable

- The Committee does not take issue with the fact

operating procedures and that there are apparently
sufficient controls to protect the interests of
the government. However, under present law, the

INTERVIEW OF ASSISTANT TO THE DIRECTOR THOMAS J. JENKINS
BY TIM OLIPHANT OF THE HOUSE COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE
CONCERNING U. S. RECORDING COMPANY

On Cecember 9, 1975, I was interviewed by Tim Oliphant
of the House Select Committee. Present at the interview was SA John
Dennis Miller of the Offiee of Legal Counsel. Oliphant first informed
me that the Chairman, Mr. Pike, of the Committee was interested in
the Bureau personnel's relationship with Joe Tait of the U. S. Record-
ing Company. He pointed out that thé Bureau had bought a substantial
amount of equipment from the U. S. Recording Company and had used
that company as a "cut out."' He stixted that because of these purchases
the Committee was interested in the poker games held at the Blue Ridge
Rod and Gun Club since people interested in procurement for the FBI
and CIA were present at these poker parties.

Oliphant asked me when I first met Tait. I told him that to
the bist of my recollection it was at the first time I went up to the Gun
Club where he was present. I told him I first went up there in the Fall
of 1971 or the Spring of 1972 and had been up there on 5 or 6 occasions
since that time. Oliphant also wanted to know if I knew Gus Oberdick.
I replied in the affirmative and he asked me when I first met Oberdick.
I told him 1 thought I first met him at Quantico at our firearms range
when he was exhibiting some of his equipment and thereafter I had been
with him up at the Gun Club. He asked me if I had ever been assigned
to the Administrative Division. I told him that when I first came in the
FBI as a clerk I worked in the Mechanical Section and the Photographic
Laboratory and these were under the Chief Clerk of the Bureau which
was later designated as the Administrative Division. I told him that I
had not had anything whatsoever to do with procurement and knew noth-
ing about it,

With respect to the poker parties he wanted to know who was
the host and I told him, Tait since he was a member of the Club. He
then asked me if I paid my way and how much. I replied that up until the
last time I — there it was $25 and the last time was $30. He asked if

YW Interview of Assistant to the Director thomas J. Jen'tins
by Tim reas — the House Committee on Intellirence
Coneorning U. 3. Recordins Company meen

any business was discussed at these po'xer parties and I replied in the
negative. te wanted to know if I had ever in my position in the Bureau
recomimendad any supplies or equipment be purchased by the Fureau
from Tait or Oberdics. I told him "no"; that all requests for material
were sent to Headquarters, clon: with specifications end that as fay as
i'mew, the Bureau either bought material off the Government Schedule
or sont out invitations to bid. 1 did point out to him that I tnew that dur-
ing the VYounged “nes oporation we needed a larre supply of flares and
tear ras ina a hurry and that Cherdic's got up in the middie of the nicht
ond arranced to shin by plane all the supplies he bad and arranged for
us to ret additional supplies from, I believe, Cleveland, aid as a result
we hod the necessary flares and tear fas in Wounded ‘nee the next day.

Oliphant asked me if I had associated with Tait socially or
at any other time other than at the Gun Club. I told him that I had attended
2 or 3 lunches where he was present at the Carriace House in Ceorgetown.
Ge then asked me if Tait picked un the tab and I told him, not to my knowl-
ecre. He asked it I snew if there was a safe up at the Gun Club and I told
him that I never recall seeing one but that does not mean there was not
one there because there were parts of the building I was never in,

In conetusion, Gliphant advised that they had been up at the
Gan Club the day after the fire and he further stated that the Club was
sold two wees prior to the tire to 9 James Clark of Clark interprises
which has the same address as the Myxaan Construction Tompany.

Oliphant was most pleasant during the interview: and stated
he folt that this was just a poker party. 7

RO: ARAVIU OF FORMER PBI SA LEON F. SCHUANTZ BY HSa

1968 and 1975. However, his participation in the CCeG and
the JAcIC was lergely nominal inasmuch as the respnnsibilitics
nf these Connittees had little or uo relationship to the
FSI's responsibilities, Wiss Yeamemete then stated that

she would concern herself during the laterview with only
the irc and the SC. She indicated that she had been
sgeakinz to persons from other United States agencies (sha
named State Peparttent, the National Security Ggency and the
Central Intelligence fgeney (CIA), specifically) concerning
thesa Committees and she asked that Er. Sekwvartz explain
tha nature of the Bureau's connection vith both of these
Committees.

She vas advised that, in relationship to the I0c,
the Bureau had an important interest in defector matters
and, in feet, the responsibility for the expleitation of a
defector in the United States for internal security and
counterintellizgeace matters Lieswith the FBI. Tt vas
explained te her that, after the FBI's interests with regard
to such an individual are satisfied, the defector in questicn
then becomes the responsibility of the CiA for resettlement.
She inguired as to whether or not the IDC issued any ~
publications and she was advised that, although the Inc
does publish a wide variety nf memoranda concerning defeetor
matters, these are usually classified and restricted ta the
menbers of the intelligence community,

With rezard to the SC, it was explained te
Miss Yomamotn that this Committee's funetion is to act as
a community forum te addressins a wide variety of problens
that may arise in the sccurity field encompassing personnel
security, physical, security, ceeurent security, commmicatiens
security, and related matters. She was advised that the
PBI participated fully in the activities nf the SC beceuse
most of its responsibilities were very closely related to

certainly be factors. : : .

so He was asked if it wes wreng for Kainer to testify

Director Sec'y

FBI INTERVIEWS OF MARTIN L. KAISER
DECEMBER 15 and 23, 1975

By letter dated December 31, 1975, A. Searle Field,
Staff Director of the House Select Committee on Intelligence, complained
to the Attorney General concerning FBI interviews. His letter stated that
they would appreciate a Justice Department review of whether the FBI's
conduct violated Federal laws protecting Congressional witnesses as well
as Federal statutes concerning procurement procedures.

Attached is a carbon of the reply letter from the Deputy ) GA
Attorney General which I understand was signed by the Deputy on Bs
January 7, 1976. The concluding paragraph advises Chairman Pik
of the Committee that the Department "will investigate this matter
immediately to determine whether any undue pressure was exerted
on Mr. Kaiser in violation of federal law."

While the letter does not indicate the form of the Department
investigation, I have been advised that the inquiry will be supervised

by Michael Shaheen acting in his capacity as Head of the Office of
Professional Responsibility and that the inquiry will be conducted" by at
Criminal Division of the Department. y 2 -/; Viz Lo BEL, 2S oe eye)

General on 1/8/76, Charles Maddox, House Select Committee Staff /
Member, reviewed the balance sheets and other financial data
pertaining. to the Bureau proprietaries. Maddox, after review

of these materials, stated that there would be no more requests
for disclosure of information concerning Bureau proprietaries

and that this would satisfy the Committee's needs. Maddox did,
however, ask that the Bureau advise him whether there are in
existence any internal regulations concerning the operation of
proprietaries, whether the Bureau's operation of proprietaries

are in violation of Section 869 of Title 31 of the U. S. Co feo
and ask the Bureau to work with him in the preparation of

short paragraph on proprietaries for the Committee's publi,
report.

Maddox, responding to the question relating to Title 31, U.S.
ode, Section 869. This particular response is being co-
ordinated with Assistant Special Counsel for Intelligence
Coordination Steven Blackhurst. Responses to the other in-
formation he requested @&g~being coordinated by the Intelligence

U. S. MOUSE SELECT COMMITTEE
_GH INTELLIGENGS ACTIVITIES (HSC)

RE: REQUEST FOR DECLASSIFICATION
OF CERTAD! FRE DOCUIENTS

Reference is made te HSC Letter dated December 11,
1975, which requested that certain documents referred to
daring the HSG hearing of Nevernber 18, 1975, be declassified
for inclusion in the HSC report.

Certain of these documents in question pertain
te the targets ef warrantless electronic surveillances and
targets of surreptitious entcics. These documents vore
originally furnished te the HSC in accordance with instructions
received from the Lepartment of Justica in response to
certain requests as contained in HSC letter dated
Getober 15, 1975.

Tt is the PRI's pesition that these documents,
even though they are unclassified, showld not be released
to the public. It is believed that a close study and reviev
ef these documents by a hostile foreign intelligence service
b. could provide an insight inte the TSi's successes and/or
Hy resources in the foreign counterintelligence field. This
is so notwithstanding the fact that the decuments ia question
Asses. ou —— are in the form of lista which identify targets only in
i - generic terms. it is felt that any reference to targets
of electronic survelllances or surreptitious entries in the
foreign counterintelligence field, no matter hey vague,
works to the advantage of hostile foreign counterintelligence ro

U.S. HOUSE SELECT COMMITTEE ON
INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES

NOTE: During a conference attended by SA Paul V. Daly of the '
Legal Counsel Division, SA John McHale of the Special Investigative
Division, Michael E. Shaheen, Jr., Special Counsel for Intelligence
Coordination in the Department, and his Assistant, Ray Hornblower,
it was explained that captioned Committee Counsel Aaron Donner had
complained to the White House concerning the Bureau's refusal to
furnish requested information on this matter. The White House
requested they be advised by the Department of the Bureau's position
and reasons thereof. Additionally, Pete Hughes, Staff Member of
captioned Committee, had telephonically complained to Shaheen con-
cerning this matter. Shaheen also explained that the Assistant
Attorney General of the Civil Division Rex Lee who is the Attorney
General's personal advisor concerning problems surrounding House

! and Senate Select Committee requests xnequested he be advised con-
cerning this matter. In a similar request, we afforded the Senate
Select Committee a briefing as opposed to the furnishing of docu-
ments giving as a reason for refusal of furnishing documents that
they involved sensitive on-going investigations. The considerations
concerning this position are obvious, with regard to the proprie-
taries operated by the Intelligence Division, they are sensitive
on-going operations and the proprietaries operated by the Special
Investigative Division if disclosed could jeopardize the lives of
Agents and/or informants and could ultimately adversely impact on
possible prosecutions.

9:30 AM, 12/17/75

The captioned staff members were brought to the writer's office by
John Hotis of the Legal Counsel Division and left the writer at approximately
20:15 AM on 12/17/75. The purpose of their request for the interview had been
indicated to inquire into the writer's participation at poker games at the Blue Ridge
Club sponsored by Joe Tait, President of U. S. Recording Company.

Mr. Oliphant stated the purpose of the interview was as indicated above
and also asked if they could i:snguire into the writer's knowledge and/or participation
in connection with the purchase of equipment from the U. S. Recording Company.

Upon inquiry Mr. Oliphant was informed that the writer had part:
in a poker party at the Blue Ridge Club on two or three occasions but not ona
occasion within the last six or so years. He was also informed that Mr.
was present on these occasions and served as a collector for the fee for the cost
of lodging and food on the occasions the writer attended. He was informed that
Mr. Tait and Mr. Oberdick were probably present; however, no business of any
kind was discussed; it being purely a social event with the primary purpose of getting
away from shop and shop-talk. He was further advised on the occasions that the
writer was in attendance former Assistant Director Donald Parsens was the host:
member of the Blue Ridge Club. In response to an inquiry as to why the writer had
not attended in more recent years, he was informed that I did not do so after my
youngest son married and left home as I did not care to leave the Mrs. alone for
the night in our residence.

Mr. Oliphant also inquired as to any other contacts I may have had with
Messrs.Tait and Oberdick and I informed him that there was no close social
relationship such as visiting back and forth in one another's residences; however ,
Thad encountered them at weddings of the children of theirs and/or mutual friends,
but on thése occasions no business was discussed. I further pointed out that Mr. Tait
had a summer place on the Delaware,Coast in the areawhere I likewise had one and on
a few occasions he has ridden by toGay hello but has not visited extensively nor,

was any business discussed during thé visits Box LL fogs 7 a 6 §

Memo to the Director

Re: Interview by Messrs. Timothy Oliphant and
Richard Vermere, Staff Members, House
Select Committee on Intelligence

Messrs. Oliphant and Vermere inquired as to the origin of the
relationship with U. S. Recording Company and at what level was the price for
the equipment purchased from U. S. Recording determined to be satisfactory.

The writer informed them the writer's recollection of the relationship with

the U.S. Recording Company dated back to the lateg’30's or early 40's and

the procedure of purchasing confidential types of equipment was an ongoing
procedure at the time the writer became involved in the Administrative Division.
I stated there was no fixed procedure for ascertaining the precise price oR

any markup relative thereto inasmuch as the nature of the items purchased were
such that primary reliance was left to the technicians of our Liaboratory who

had shopped the industry for the equipment needed and that any detailed discussion
regarding price would normally go through the Procurement Officer of the
Administrative Division and the technicians in the Laboratory to see that a
reasonable price was being paid but not an absurb or unreasonable price. It was
pointed out that procurement procedures in effect would require any questionable
price to be taken up with higher authority either in the Laboratory or the
Administrative Division to adjudicate such a question and to the writer's recollection |
there had been no oceasions when this had occurred. |

Mr. Vermere inquired as to Mr. Mohr's relationship with the Laboratory
in connection with his position as Assistant to the Director and I pointed out that
there were times when the Laboratory was one of the Divisions under his jurisdiction
and I was sure that the organizational charts they had would seem to indicate this.

They inquired if I were aware of the fact that the Blue Ridge Club had
suffered a fire and I advised them I had read it in the newspaper and they advised
when they became aware of it was listening to the radio when they were going to
visit the club having heard the newscast concerning it.

Mr. Vermere inquired as to whether there was any inquiry being made
into the Bureau's dealings with the U. S. Recording Company and he was informed
Director Kelley had instructed an inquiry to be made into the matter right after
the testimony of Mr. Kaiser before the Committee for which they work. Upon
inquiry whether there was any information available as to developments to date with
regard to this matter, they were informed since this was an ongoing inquiry it
would be inappropriate at this time to discuss such with them. When asked when
the inquiry would be completed, they were informed it would be concluded very soon

Memo to the Director

Re: Interview by Messrs. Timothy Oliphant and
Richard Vermere, Staff Members, House
Select Committee on Intelligence

as the Director was just as anxious as the Committee was to have the full picture
with regard to this situation. During this discussion Vermere alluded as to the
volume of the purchase made in 1971 which information had been previously
|furnished to the Committee and it was pointed out that these purchases resulted
from the break-in of our Resident Agency in Media, Pennsylvania, and the use
of U. S. Recording was two-fold; one, to preserve the confidentiality of the type
of equipment being installed throughout the country in our Resident Agencies and
second, to obtain expedite delivery in connection with such equipment.

I also advised Messrs. Oliphant and Vermere that purchases other

than those of a confidential nature were made from U. S. Recording Company of

items on which he was the supplier under the GSA general supply schedule and

where purchases on a competitive bid basis were made by soliciting bids for items

of equipment under this latter procedure he being on the bidder's mailing list
jalong with other manufacturers and suppliers. I pointed out that procurement

of all equipment adheres to the Federal Procurement Regulations prescribed by

the General Services Administration.

charge in cases where modification of equipment was necessary.
Mohr was asked whether Tait was paid as a confidential source |
of the Bureau. Mohr first denied same, but then considered |
the fact that Tait's company was used as a "cut out” and that

the fee paid to Tait for such service could have been considered
payments to a confidential source for services rendered. He

was asked whether Tait had charged a 30% mark-up as alleged by
Martin Kaiser, Mohr responded that he was not aware of instances
involving a 30% mark-up and, if such occurred, it would have
been in excess of the usual fee paid to Tait.

Mohr advised that he was confronted by Vermeire and
Oliphant with statements allegedly made by William Harward of
the FBI Laboratory which seemed to imply that the Laboratory
referred the requests to purchase equipment to the Administrative
Division and that Mohr authorized purchases through the USRC,.
Mohr indicated that the arrangements fox purchasing through the
USRC were based on Laboratory Division requests and not on
Administrative Division or his own requests. He commented that
in regard to testimony by Martin Kaiser, it appeared that the
FBI Laboratory had made arrangements to purchase material
confidentially through the USRC and then went directly to the
Martin Kaiser Company, specifying the purchase order requests,
and thereby revealing the FBI as a purchaser from Kaiser. He
said that such direct contact by the Laboratory made the
arrangements with USRC appear to be unnecessary and difficult
to explain,

Concluding, Mohr advised that it was not indicated to \
him one way or the other whether he would be called as a
witness before the HSC.

It should be noted that Mohr was released from his

confidentiality agreement with the FBI for the purpose of the
above interview, release predating the actual interview.

NOTE: Bureau is in receipt of letter 12/2/75 from Staff
Director, HSC on Intelligence, forwarded through Departmental
Special Counsel for Intelligence Coordination, requesting
list of all former Bureau informants against whom prosecution
has been recommended because of violations o£ law while
serving as informants. Other specific requests made in
letter, copy attached. Our liaison representative with
HSC has determined purpose of request was to include
information in report on informants as rebuttal to allegations
Bureau does not prosecute informants but in effect grants
immunity. It was agreed in conversation between liaison
representative and HSC staff member that an excised summary
where Bureau informants were prosecuted would be responsive
to committee's request. Staff member specifically advised
that disclosure of informants' status could well endanger
their lives. Instant listing set forth with identifying
data and respective field office deleted in order to
protect sources' identity. A similar listing had been
prepared for Mr. Adams recently with symbol numbers and
specifics set forth. It is recommended instant communication
be approved for forwarding to HSC through Bureau liaison.

APPENDIX

BLACK PANTHER PARTY
. FORMERLY KNOWN 4S THE BLACK PANTHER PARTY FOR SELF-DEFENSE

The Black Panther Party (BPP), organized in December,
1966, at Oakland, California, by Huey P. Newton and Bobby George
Seale, has the publicly-stated purpose of organizing black
people to take control of the life, politics and destiny of
the black community. The Party, operating the Black Panther
Intercomminal News Service, publishes a newspaper called
"The Black Panther," which at one time openly advocated the
use of guns and guerrilla tactics in a revolutionary program
to end the oppression of the black people but since early
1971 has spoken for a survival program pending revolution,
BPP national headquarters, aka Black Panther Intercom-
munal Headquarters, is located in Oakland, California.

While openly advocating direct overthrow of the
U. S. Government by force and violence iintil 1971, leaders
have since avoided extreme statements in favor of calling
for action within the established order. Newton, in an
interview appearing in the May, 1973, issue of "Playboy"
magazine, stated the Panthers' chief ambition is to change
the American Government by. any means necessary but that
.ultimately such change will be through armed violence.

Despite its claimed dedication to community service,
indicators of the BPP's continued attraction to violence persist.
Since July, 1974, Newton and other BPP members have been arrested °
in Oakland, California, for threatening police officers,
murder of a 17-year-old female and the pistol whipping of
Newton's tailor, Newton failed to appear on these charges and
is.now a local fugitive. Additionally, one died and three
- were wounded asa result of a shooting at a BPP-sponsored
dance in Oakland, California, in October, 1974.

gative activities are contained in the budget subactivity,
“Security and Criminal Investigations -- Coordination.”

The FBI colleets and tabulates monthly and annual
stetisti¢es of selected crimes reported to law enforcement
agencies committed in the United States. ‘The Uniform Crime
Reports (UCR) automated information system provides support
in assembling and processing the crime statistics utilized
in the preparation and production of the UCR publications,
including "Crime in the United States."

The AIDS, NCIC and UeR systems provide support
for the entire criminal justice commnity.

the Cryptanalysis Support System is a ¢lassified
and dedicated Automated Data Processing (ADP) system which
performs mathematical and related calculations associated
with the FBI's eryptographle examination efforts.

The FBI, an agency of approximately 20,000 employees
and an annual budget of $468,700,000, utilizes ABP as an
administrative and management tool. ‘The FBI's payroll is
completely automated. Personnel matters, such as promotion
and transfer, ate managed through an on-line personnel data
system, L€forts are now undexvay to automate the FBI's
budget by implementing ‘a management information systen,
Several computer programs provide statistics required to
properly administer the FBI, All of these individual efforts
bere 4 the Eureau Administrative Support Information Systcn

BASIS).

The Investigative Support Tnformation Systen is
composed of all ADP efforts which directly support the FBI's
investigutive mission, In recent years AUP has been utillued
to directly support investigations. Many cases involve
handling large volumes of investigative data in computerized
form which are printed, sorted and/or searched by FEI ALP

equipment. Without the availability of necessary ADP equiprent,
many of these cases could not possibly be handled expedi-
tiously, efficiently or accurately. Direct assistance has

also been provided te the Antitrust Division of the Lepartment
of Justice, The FBI's automation effort directly involving
investigation of major cases has more than doubled during
Fiseal Year 1975.

The FBI's Files and Commmications Division manages
intra-Bureau commmications and the records files. A major
portion of the FBI's ALP efforts involve automation of
several functions of the Files and Commmications bivision.
This includes automating the General Index, the Central Records
filing system and the Secure Teletype System,

During Fiseal Year 1975, the FBI spent a total of
$8,261,000 on AUP. ‘The cost includes hardware purchase and
rental, maintenance, software acquisition, telecommumications
in support of ADP, staf& space and supplies. Of that total,
38,001,000 was the cost of performing the ADP vorl: of the
Lata Processing Section, Computer Systems Division. The
remainder was the cost of operating the FBI Laboratory
Division's classified Cryptanalysis Suppart Systen.
