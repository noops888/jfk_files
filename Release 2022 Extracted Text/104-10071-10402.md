March' 20-1964:

i friend of mine had se neet a Captain of the Grook Ship " San Spiridon" &

ew nights ago, and in trying to make a deal with him to get me put or cubi

almost nado me

reak every bone in his body Firat of all, I dia

not tol

hinimy name or address or anything about mysell, except that I told me that

I had a wife and child whom I have not seen for almost 3 years, in the U:S.

and had all of my papers necessary to leave here, except a visa to Mex100, I

cold him that I reason that I had wanted to leave here soon, was that my wife"

was sick and I dia not want to wait until my Mexican Visa came through. After

I hour of hin telling me how nuch he cared

Ior amerloans and for the U.s. eto.

he told me that ho would got me out,

by hiding me 1r a boller until the ship

left Havana. He said that he could not hide me in his cabin, as he was afraiô

that after the snip was searched, and I should be found, then he would get into

trouble, but 1f I should be found in the boiler,

than he can say that I had

after I agreed to all of that

I asked him, how nuch?-and his answer was: &

sneaked aboard myself without a promise 15021o men meAN

DOLLARS, after whien 1 laughed in his faoe, ana saked him where in the world

would a person in Cuba get 1500 Dollars, he woula not take pesos, as he said

that he had thousands of pesos 1n his pocket that he made by selling American:

Cigarettes for 30 pesos per carton. Weld to make a long story, short,

I told him

to forget the whole thing, and the ship left here this afternoon for. st. Johns

In Newfoundland. The usual charge here for getting people out 18 about 300.

American Dollars or 2500 pesos, but this Captain thinka as all foreigners do

that Americans are all wealthy,

aid as for doing something for a human being.

for nothing, well that they will not do. If I had the money, I would never

pay 1t, lot alone even trust a man l1ke

this Captain. As it 100k8 11k0 I Will

not got a Mexican Vien,

I am now going to try to get out of here by launch,

I cannot stay here nuch longer l1ke Iam, and 1t 13 better for me to take a

chance by launch, instead of

just sitting around, and maybe get into trouble

at any time now. I just came fron tue Swiss Embassy again, and they told me

that they had no: received an abnwer. frum Switzerland regarding my case that

they had malled aoout 6 weeks ago,

and also that the only peoplo who could got

a Mexican Visa for me, 1s the American Embassy In Mexico Clty. The Swies Embedey

can give out advice every day, but as for doing anyuuing, they are airaldoAc

one smoos suwissy here in Havana, a Cuban stands a better chance or getting

helped than an arerican, but I cannot say anything to them, as 1 am stila hero.

PLEASE do not tell my wife that I au going to try to get out by launch, as a

don't want to have her worry more than she does now.
