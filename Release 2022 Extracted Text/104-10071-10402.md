March’ 20-1964: 7 u

4A friend of mine had ne. meet a Captain of tne Greek Ship " San Spiridon " a
few nights ago, and in trying to maxe a deal witn him to get me put of Cuba |
almost made me break every pone in his body. Firat of all, I dia not tel2
him-my name or address or anything .aoout myself, except that I tola me that
I had a wife and child wnom I have not seen for almost 3 years, in the U.S.
and had all of my papers necessary ‘to leave here, except a visa to Mexico,I |
pole him that I reason that I had wanted to leave here adon, was that my wife”
was sick and I dia not want to wait until my Mexican Visa came through. After .
1 nour of him telling me how much he cared for Americans and for the U.S. etc. fj
he tole me that ho would get me out, by hiding me 4n a boiler until the ship
left Havana.He saia that, je could not hide me in his cabin, as he was afraid

trouble, but if I should be found in the boiler, than he can say that I had
sneaked aboard myself, without nis knowledge, after I agreed, to all of that
I asked him, how wuch?-and his aneweréwas: § 1500.00 (Fifteen Hundred AMERICAN
DOLLARS, after whicn 1 laughed in his face, ana ssked hin wHere in the world
would a person in Cuba get 1500 Dollars, he woula not take pesos, as he gaia
that he had thousands of pesos in his pocket that he made by selling American:
Cigarettes for 30 peson per carton, Well to mae a long story, short, I tola him
to forget the whole thing, and the ship left here this afternoon for St.Johns
dn Newfoundland. The ‘usual charge here for getting people out 18 about 300
American Dollars or 2500 pesos, but this Captain thinks as all foreigners do
that Amerigans are all wealthy, and as for doing something for a human being.
ror nothing, well that they wili not do. If I had the money, 1 would never
pay it, let alone even trust a man like this Captain, As 4t looks pike I will
not get a Mexican Vies, I am now going to try to get out or here by launch,
I cannot stay here ouch longer like Iam, and 1t 18 better for me to take a
chance by launch, instead or just sitting around, ana maybe get into trouble
at any time now. I just came fron tne Swies Embassy again, and tney told me.
that they had nov received an apnwer. frum Switzerland regarding my case that
they had mailed aoout 6 weeks ago, and aleo that the only people who could got f
a Mexican Visa for me, is tne American Embassy in Mexico City. The Swiss Embasey
can give out advice every day, but as for doiny anytuing, they are afraid.At i
yhe Swiss numwoSvy here in Havana, a Cuban stands a vetter cnance or getting Hl
helped than an Anerican,. put I cannot say anything to them, as I am still heres
PLEASE do not tell my wife that I aa going to try to get out py launch, a8 I
don't want to have her worry more than she does now.
