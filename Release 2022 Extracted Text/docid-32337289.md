to have met BRYKIN on 126th Street and Broddway at
BRYKIN's instructions but that 126th Street does not
intersect Broadway. He said 129th Street was the

next intersection north of 125th Street, so that iis

{ and MORRIS observed a two tone blue 1958 Ford, 1962
NY license 5C7384 on the West side of Broadway, between
130th Street and 125th Street. This car contained
a lone male who was unidentifiable under the circumstances
of distance and lighting conditions. During the period,
it was observed this car changed parking places three
times as it progressed slowly from 130th Street to
125th Street. oHied

on this car, was issued to HERMAN P, LEVAKOV, a Soviet

LINGOYA stated that after he met BRYKIN
they walked to a large housing project south and
east of the intersection of Broadway and 125th Street.
He said they wandered about in this projec or a
few minutes, during which time BRYKIN obviously was
attempting to determine if he was under sui feiliance (ORY
They then proceeded to BRYKIN's autoimobile,
a blue Ford,which.was parked on the street near the
te sop

edge of the housing project. LINGOYA stated he feltx'

BRYKIN was observing him closely and he did not think
it advisable to get the license number of this car.
He said that after they entered the automobile,
BRYKIN drove about the area for a short time and
again seemed to be trying to locate any surveillance
that- might be in effect,

LINGOYA stated that eventually they went
to Queens, NY, where the subject stopped the car at
a filling station at the intersection of what the
informant described as Marathon Parkway and Long
Island Parkway. BRYKIN instructed the. attendant to
put gas in the car, check the engine, and to take his
time, .BRYKIN instructed LINGOYA to remain in the
car. BRYKIN then went inside the service station
where he was out of sight of the informant.

LINGOYA stated'he is of the opinion that BRYKIN

made a telephone call, however, he caild not actually
see him do so. He stated he noted that BRYKIN paid
-$3.15 for the gas he Bowen (3) ee :

: It appears that BRYKIN may have-pHonéed
LEVAKOV or whoever was in LEVAKOV's vehicle at 7
the meet aaa th estos if any physical surveillance
had been/t &! area. LENGOYA said that when BRYKIN
reentered the car, they drove for four or five blocks,

_ perhaps on Sunset Lake Boulevard, or some similar named
‘street and then turned right, eventually arriving at
a bar, restaurant, inn or tavern, naméd "Hilltop."
He stated BRYKIN indicated he had lived or had been
in that area before. LENGOYA pointed out that he
knows nothing about the area they were in, and was
hazy as to the streets and location. He said he could
not give a proper account of their location, however,
he was sure he could identify the Hilltop establishment
if he sees it again.( uy

From the account he furnished, it appears
that he and BRYKIN may have been at the Hilltop Inn,
803. Northern Blvd., Manhasset, Long Island, which is
in Nassau County, ive)

LINGOYA ‘said that when they were driving,
BRYKIN asked about his family and LINGOYA stated he and
his sister, GLORIA, had an argument and he did not want
to see. her again. .He said BRYKIN seemed quite pleased
at this. LINGOYA stated that actually, his sister
had become quite distraught over her living and working
conditions in NY, and he had bbought her a plane ticket
to Miami and she had-left NY on 3/17/62. He said his
a Sister GLORIA was to reside wit, elatives in the
Hialeah area of Miami, Florida i)
, BRYKIN Stated
LINGOYA said/ ALEXANDER BESSMERTNYKH,
(Bufile 105-91431)(Nyfile 105-43646,)is presently on
a mission to Russia. Dissemination.of this information
will be made by separate memo to BESSMERTNYKH's case
file. :

BESSMERINYKH, a Soviet national, is employed
as a Translator in the Russian Section, Language and
Meetings Service, Office of Confrence Services, UN
Secretariat, NYC ®&)

LINGOYA said that as for the "Draft Board"
on West 72nd Street, in-Manhattan, NY, referred to by
BRYKIN, LINGOYA has personal knowledge that such 4
place does exist. He said that he has been there, knows
who heads it, and has -attended meetings there. He stated
that actually it is not a "draft board" but that Cubans
are assembled there and sent to Anti-CASTRO training
areas, one of which exists somewhere in the Long Island
area. LINGOYA seemed somewhat reluctant to furnish more
definite information regarding this, and the point was
not pressed. It is feltjthat this information can be
obtained in the future (A) (Al

é It is pointed out for the Biireau's
consideration that BRYKIN may have another source or
sources with the knowledge that LING@OYA knows of this
assembly place, and that BRYKIN is testing LINGOYA
to see if he will be truthful in this matter. (SA)

Fl : : It appears some decision must be made
as to whether, and how much, information LINGOYA should
furnish BRYKIN regarding this. LINGOYA has portrayed
himself to BRYKIN as a believer in the revolutionary
forces now in control of Cuba and he feels that
BRYKIN believes him, however, he is not completely
convinced of this

BRYKIN told LINGOYA he would return
from abroad as soon as possible. LINGOYA got the
impression that BRYKIN said he would be in Cuba, to
“Organize Something", but he was not certain. (AY

BRYKIN told LINGOYA that if anything
important comes up, LINGOYA wil] be contacted at
LINGOYA's place of employment.

BRYKIN said that in the event LINGOYA
is not contacted before hand, BRYKIN will meet him at
7:30 p.m, on 6/29/62, at the intersegtion of 181st Street
and Broadway, Manhattan, New York. 7

LINGOYA stated he believes this time and
place mean nothing to BRYKIN, because he has noted in
the past that when they made an appointment, BRYKIN
was always very careful to'write the date, time and
place down. In this instance, he did not make a note
of the meeting place or sine. GRY)
