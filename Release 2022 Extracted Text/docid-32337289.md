it advisable to get the license number of this car.

a filling station at the intersection of what the

informant described as Marathon Parkway and Long

BRYKIN instructed the attendant to

put gas in the car, check the engine, and to take his

time. BRYKIN instructed LINGOYA to remain in the

car.

BRYKIN then went inside the service station

where he was out of sight of the informant.

he was sure he could identify the Hilltop establishment

if he sees it again. (gu)

LINGOYA said that when they were driving,

BRYKIN asked about his family and LINGOYA stated he and

his sister, GLORIA, had an argument and he did not want
