Meeting with ARRB Staff

1.

Thursday afternoon I met with Dave Marwell,

Executive Director for the ARRB, and two of his staff,

Jeremy Gunn and Mary McAuliffe. I briefed them on the four

releases in the Lopez Report and Scelso Testimony that had

been identified as potential appeal items, and on the

Agency's. concerns re the

_documents. I requested

that the

Board reconsider the release of the statements on

Mexico City political action programs, Scelso's comment on

Agee, the reference to the Mexican Police as a sourceland

Warrenton as site of the Agency's Record Center.

2. Marwell agreed to send a "staff recommendation" to

the Board recommending

that they delay the release of these

four items to hear additional evidence from the Agency.

The

rest of the Lopez Report and Scelso Testimony would be

released on schedule. If the Board accepts the staff's

recommendation, the four items will be addressed at the next

Washington meeting (27 September): If the Board rejects the

staff's recommendation, then we have the option of appealing

to the President. Marwell and Gunn seemed confident that

the Board would

agree to delay the release.

3. Gunn requested that the Agency's additional

evidence on these four items (if provided in writing) be to

the ARRB staff by 23 September. The Agency can also brief

the board members at the 27 September meeting.

As I

understand it, DO/Mexicol

Dwill be preparing

evidence memos on

"political action programs"

and ("Mexican

(police" issues and OGC ((Linda C.) will take the lead on

Agee. I will contact the DA/IRO (Don Hatch) on the warrenton)

4.

Concerning the

documents, Marwell agreed

to delay Board action until the 16 October meeting.

The

Agency's proposal on these documents should be sent to the

ARRB staff as soon as possible.
