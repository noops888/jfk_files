MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT

SUBJECT: CIA Reorganization

t gubmit the following viewa ag one who worked in OSS during the
war and served ae a perfadic CLA consultant in the years since.

Qn balance, CIA's record has probsbly been very goad. In the
nature of clandestine operations, the triumphe of an intelligence
agency are unknown; all the public hearg dtiout (or should hear
about) are its errove. But, again in the nature of the case, an
agency dedicated to clandicetine activity can afford damned few
vigible errors. Tho important thing to recognice today, in my
judgment, i¢ thet the CLA, as at present named dnd constituted, has
about used up ite quote. Ite margin for future error ts practically
non~exictent. One more CIA debacle will shake faith considerably
in US policy, e¢ home as well as abroad. And, until CIA te vieibly
reorganized, it will (ae in the Algerian instance} be widely blamed for
Gevelepmente of which it is wholly innocent.

‘Fhe argument of thte memorandum te that CIA's trauble can be traced
to the autonomy with which the agency has been permitted to operates
and that thid autonomy fe due to three main causes: (1) dn inadequate
sctrine of clandestine oporetiens; (2} an inadequate conception of
the relationehip between operations and policy; (3} an inadaquate

Or ahould be «« a groge Gad repeated CIA failing hae been {te
occasional réadinegs to auccumb to the temptdtions of favagable
publicity. The Guatemalan end Iranian operationg were almost
nullified by the Mead of self-congratulatory publicity witch followed
them fe.g., the articles by Riehsrd and Gladye Harkasse, “The

‘The atructure which would meet the criteria guggested in this
mémorandum would be as follows:

cc:

1) The State Department would be granted gencral
cleavance authority over all clandestine activity. This
might be effectuated on the British model by the appointment
of a Deputy Undersecretary of State for Intelligence, who
would act for the Secretery in these matters and who might
serve as chairman of a Joint Intelligence Board,

2). The Joint Intelligence Board would include repre-
sentatives from all olements in the intelligence coramunity
and also from the White House.

’ 3) The operating branches of tho present CIA would be
reconstituted under gome blameless title (the National Informas
tion Service}. . This new agency would be charged with reaponsi-
dility for clandestine callection, for covert political operations
and for paramilitary activities. R would submit projects to the
Deputy Undersecretary of Stete for Intelligence far clearance.

In general, the agenty would bear somewhat the game sélatione
ship to State as the Diearmament Administration and ICA
presently do.

4} A eecond eemi<independent agency would be cet wp again
bearing a blameless title (the Foreign Ressarch Agency}, coordic
nate with the operatians agency. This agency would be charged
with responglbility for collation and interpretation. ¢ woulé

Anciude CIA/DDI, the Bureau of Intelligence and Research in

State, and the vayious eervice functions now eaeried on by CIA
(photographic interpretation, biographical files, foreign trqadcadt
