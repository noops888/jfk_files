“ SUBJECT _? ‘Allegation by a-Senior Cuban Diplomat :

Concerning thé Role of Cuban Exiles in
the Assassination of President Kennedy

1.. According to'a fairly reliable source, a’ senior
Cuban diplomat stationed abroad made certain charges in
late.September 1977 concerning the alleged role of Cuban
exiles in the assassination of President. John F. Kennedy.
This diplomat made these allegations to his colleagues
in the course of an official meeting in his embassy. The
diplomat said, among other things, that Cuban exiles
such_as former Cuban Air Force officer D i a z Lan (fnu)
and others had been involved in the assassination of
President Kennedy, The diplomat referred to the assas-
sination in the context of a security lecture in which
he claimed that counter-revolutionary. activities by Cuban
exiles have increased im recent months. He said that
recent information had. arrived implicating D i az in the
Kennedy ‘assassination. The diplomat did not mention any
other: Cuban exiles by name or provide any further details.
He did not. identify the source of his information, although

of Foreign Affairs. :

2. This division has no other factual information
concerning the diplomat's allegations. We believe that
the basis for the diplomat's statement was, probably, an
article which appeared in the New York "Daily News" on
20 September 1977. This article quoted Meritza :
Lorenz as saying that she, Orlando Bos ch, Frank
Sturgis, Pedro DP i az Lanz, two unnamed Cuban
