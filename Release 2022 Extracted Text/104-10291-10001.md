MEMORANDUM FOR: Ghairman, Clandestine Services Career

Service Board (Panel A)

SUBJECT : Joseph B, Smith - Recommendation for
Promotion from GS-14 to GS-15

\ 1, Mr, Smith joined the Headquarters Training Branch of the

OTR Operations School in October 1966 specifically to assume respon-
sibility for Covert Action training, He spent the first few months in

a thorough study and review of all GA courses previously given in OTR.
This was a long and:complicated job, compounded ia part by the public
compromise of a wide. rarige of Agency ‘CA activities, In closest coordi=

_ Nation with the GA Staff, Mr, Smith devised a totally new and different’
CA curriculum, consisting of two short seminars for middlé and senior |

grade officers -- one called a Covert Action Operations Serninar and
one a Politics Workshop, These seminars, emphasizing the integrated
nature of CS operations, have evoked a very positive response, con-
firming the soundness of Mr, Smith's creative efforts in Fevamping

CA training in this fashion.

2, Ae a corollary to the main duties ¢

sibility as Tradecratt Advisor and Coordinator for the Operations
Support Course, @ critical Slock.of instruction fer (primarily young

and inexperienced) CS clericals headed for overseas assignments

* where they may be called upon to assist case officers in operational

support tasks. Although, strictly speaking, this teaching and coordi-~
nation task was outside Mr. Smith's normal purview and main area

of expertise, he accepted this additional responsidility with exemplary
willingness, and’then proceeded to discharge it smoothly, energetically,
and effectively, - In addition to managing an extensive Live problem, the
Tradecraft Advisor must ensure that presentations by a number of
instructors result in-a balanced and coherent coverage of all operational
subjects in the course. This entails the coordination of efforts of-
several senior and experienced instructors, all under the nominal aegis
of the course's Chief Instructor, and, thus, demands a great deal of
finesse and tact, Mr, Smith has not only fulfilled’ this difficult role in

a highly efficient manner but has alse drawn on his own:long field
experience for pertinent and: meaningful contributions to the course.

4. During Mr. Smith's tour with OTR, hé was requested to
participate as a member of'a Survey Team ini a review of the ¢ffective-
ness of the Propaganda Group of the CA Staff, Ina 30 June 1967
memorandum of appreciation to the. Director of Training, Chief, CA
Staff commented as.follows on Mr. Smith's work:

"Throughout Mr. Smith participated in a most
effective professional manner bringing to bear
his extensive background in the Clandestine
Services, His direct and objective approach
to the problernd considered in the course of
the survey made his contribution to the over-
all Team effort.invaluable, The Team report,
which Iam still in the process of discussing
within the Staff, will be of considerable value
not only to this Staff in our future planning but
also, I feel, fo-thé future pasture of the covert
propaganda mission of the Clandestine Services;
thus, heartily commend Mr, Smith tor his
effective participation with the Survey Team
in this effort,"

Mr. Smith lives covert action -- his imayinative and “disctplined /
mind comes forth with many operational concepts and ideas ranging
from simple, quite routine mattury to complicated and, carefully

outpouring, practical details of implementation are sometimes buried,
In these instances, Mr. Smith-quickly trims his sails and comes forth

As indicated in the last Fitness Report, -Mr. Smith geumed responsibility for
Covert Action training: presented by this Branch in ‘the uid oflkomptdigise of a wide
range of Agency GA activities. Quite apart from all the operational consequences of
these —____| there were also, of course, concpmitant ramifications in
the training field. Following careful study and examination of the ‘hew situation, Mr,

Smith devised, in closest coordination with the CA Staff, a radically new and different

Covert Action curriculum, The existing comprehensive courses on|,_ )
operations were discontinued for obvious reasons.

In place of.these and the part-time
Covert Action Operations Course, Mr. Smith developed a new, full-time, three-day
Covert.Action Operations Seminaz for middle and senior grade officers. This inten-
sive seminar, stressing the integrated nature of CS operations, was designed aa a.
basic core around which skills-oriented seminars or workshops could be built to deal.

C assignment to Headquarters Training Branch of the Operations:
School, Mr. Smith has been principally engaged inathorgysh study and review
of all courses in Covert Action previdusly given in OTR." This has been a long
and complicated job, the difficulty of which has been.compounded by the necessity,
at least in-part through public events, to plah and project a total revision of :
instruction in the CA field. As a result, Mr. Smith has not yet had the opportunity
to teach. This will come shortly, however, when a new course begins-on 8 May.
The "Strong" rating given him here is based on the excellent work and thoroughly
profeasional approach he has taken in all of the preparatory work he has under-
‘taken. He has been eminently successful in.establishing uecful new relationships
and in masntaining hia old contacts in the Clandestine Services for the purpose of:
laying a éolid: groundwork for high quality training. In addition to his résponsi+
bilities in OTR he has been regularly consulted: by the CA Staff in a survey of
‘one of its activities, This ie fine testimony forthe regard in which he is held-~--
outside the confines of his prescnt job, The prognosis for a very effective -
performance in all of his teaching asdigninents is excellent.’ He has no supers.
\wisory responsibilities and.is average in cost consciousness.

fo Subject--economic action and econonic reporting. In total, Subject
is case officer of four active Projects plus one that is temporarily
inactive as the agent is: absent a Also, Subject is the
Supervisor of one American Staff Agent under deep cover. Subject
handles these varied assignments with a high degree of competence and
indicates a versatility-of high degrce: Subject's project management
is good and his formal reporting te both his supervisor and Headquarters
is keptcurrent and done in depth?

during.the period he has been at this Station (24 months). In addition
he has an ability to relate cost to. production which has resulted in

Suvject's rapport with his agents and other
contacts appears to be excellent, which is doubtless
an important element in his continuing success with his
projects. Subject is responsive to guidance and

direction and when after full discussion a, course of
action is agreed upon, he can be counted upon to take

action within the agreed limits.
