2022 RELEASE UNDER THE PRESIDENT JOHN F. KENNEDY ASSASSINATION RECORDS ACT OF 1992

11 November 1975

Bob,

There are, In my mind, two distinct problems which have to be

ardressed hy the Task Force, Tiese are (e) a final proofing of the

sterile copy of the file, and (b) ensuring that the machine run accurate-

ly reflects what actions were taken with regard to full and partial

declassification.

In the case of the final proofing only one person review the entire

sanitzed file to ensure consistancy in tle released product, eliminate

duplicate naterials

and pick up any errors -lici: may

have slipped past,

1.to crypts etc. This should not take long, parhaps a day and should

probahly cone ly a carson with a frest rier, i.e. not having done the declassific

The second prollem may take more time. It would be the reviewing of

each of the documents indicating what declassification, if any was done

and accuratel: reflecting the action on the machine run. The would be a

tio nan job. An sitendent problem would is indicating on the machine run

M'enever duplicates tearing otier numbers appear in the file. (In some

cases we have found two, three or more copies of the same document, bearing

a different number, larded throughout the files.) A tertiary problem is the

marting on the machine run cases of drafts, research notes etc. My re-

conmendation for this phase ould be for a parson from the Task Force,

familiar with files and the entire excercise work jointly with a person

from C/CI/ERO's office.
