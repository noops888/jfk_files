Bob,

There are, in my mind, two distinct problems which have to be

addressed hy the Task Force; These are (a) a final proofing Of the
sterile copy of the file, and (b) ensuring that the machine run accurate-
ly reflects what actions were taken with regard to full and partial

declassification.

In the case of the final prosfing only one person review the entire
ssnitzed fila to ensure consistancy in the released product, eliminate
duoliest2 materials and pick up any. errors “hich may have slipped past,

i.e. cryats ete. This should not take long, rerbans a day and should

probably done ty a nerson with a fresh view, {.e. not having done the declassific

The second problem may take more time. It would be the reviewing of

each of the documents indicating whet declassification , if any was done
and accurately reflecting the action on the machine run, The would be a
tvo man job, An ettendent problem would ‘Le indicating on the machine run

whenever duplicates bearing otier nunbers ascear in the file. (In some

cases we have found two, three or more copies of the same donument, bearing
H a different number, larded throughout the files.) A tertiary problem is the
marking on the machine run cases of drafte, research notes etc. My re-
commendation for this phase ‘ould be for # person from the Tesk Force,
familiar with files and the entire excercise work jointly with a person

from C/CI/ERO's office.
