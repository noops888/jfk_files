WASHINGTON SPRING PROJECT

RACIAL MATTER

On April 1, 1968, a confidential source advised

he understood that following the racial disturbance which

occurred in Memphis, Tennessee, on March 28, 1968, Reverend

martin Luther King, Jr., President, Southern Christian

Leadership Conference (SCLC) called a meeting of several

SCLC Executive officers which was held March 30, 1968, at

the Ebenezer Baptist Church, Atlanta. Among those attending

this meeting were James Bevel,

SCIC Executive Staff member;

Jesse Jackson, Northern Director, Project Breadbasket, SCIC;

Hosea Williams, Director of Voter Registration and Political

Baucation, SCIC; and Stanley Levison.

Reverend King arranged this meeting for the purpose:

of reviewing the recent disturbance in Memphis and evaluating

the effect thereof upon SCLE's contemplated Washington Spring

Project (WSP). Reverend King opened this meeting by again

stressing to those present how greatly concerned he was as to

the effect of the Memphis

disturbance on his image as a civil

rights leader and the position of SCLC as a leading civil rights

organization. This entire matter apparently upset Reverend King

to the extent he found it desirable to excuse himself from this

meeting shortly after

its commencement.

Source was unable to

advise whether Reverend

King returned to the meeting.

This meeting lasted most of the day and concluded with

a decision on the part of those present that SCLC officials would

immediately return to Memphis, re-organize the striking Sanitation

including national functionaries, met in Chicago, Illinois, for

the purpose of setting in motion forces for the establishment of

centers and to solidify the Party base through the Da!.

This

National Organizational Secretary, stated the Party believes the

Das should have a working-class outlook and be a mass organization

favorabia to socialism, socialist countries and Marxism, and in

April, 1967, advised that GUS HALi, CPUSA General Secretary,

indicated the DCA primary emphasis should be on developing mass

resistance to the draft.

A third source advised in September, 1957, that JARVIS

TYNER VRS

A contidential source, who has furnished reliable

information in the past, learned on March 29, 1960, that on that

date, stanley Levison and Martin Luther King, Jr. discussed

the position which King has found himself in

as a result of the

violence that occurred in Memphis, Tennessee, on March 28, 1968,

at the time wher: King led a march

through downtown Memphis. King

told Levison that he leels they have to face the fact thauna

from a public relations

point of view and every other way,

are in serious trouble"

spring campaign, known as the Poor People's Campaign, and

Iar as it is concerned it is in trouble. King noted that it

will be much more difficult to recruit people for the Washington

campaign now because they (the Southern Christian Leadership

Conference) (SCLC) are recruiting non-violent people and these

people will hold back if they think they will be in a campaign

that is going to be taken over by violent elements.

King stated

that this is not a failure for the SCLC because it has enough

of a program to affirm its position but that it is a personal

setback for himself.

King continued that persons such as Roy Wilkens

(Head of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored

non-violence

reiterated that they have had a great public relations setback as

far as his image and leadership are concerned.

Levison attempted to dissuade King from this poini

of view stating that it would be true only if King accepts

"their"

definition. He added that he felt it is a profound error King

1s making..

King noted that he did not accept it himself but that

others will. Levison retorted that people would accept it for

a: few days, but, if events prove otherwise, will not accept it.

King noted that events will not prove otherwise unless

they think soberly through this period. He said that somehow he had

to reaffirm what

the press will refuse to affirm.

He referred to

the Memphis incident stating that they all know it was just a

few people who were involved.

He

added that it was a failure

of the leadership in Memphis.

King informed Levison that persons

who were responsible for the violence came to see him on the

morning

He said these persons were fighting the

Leadership in temphis, the men who ignored and neglected them, the

men who would not

give them any attention, who ordered their

telephones cut off.

King added that he had no knowledge of all this,

that the

persons responsible for the violence were too sick to see

that what they were doing during

the violence was hurting him, king,

more than it could hurt the local preachers.

king related that he was so upset and shocked over

Memphis violence that he was going to announce a personal fasi

jump out, do something, and then come back to hide within

the group.

King said he is a symbol of non-violence and

that the press is not going to say

what Levison said.

He

said the symbol will be weakened and it will put many Negroes

in doubt.

He said he must do something that is a powerful

act to unify forces and refute the press.

Levison stated that if it had this result he would

agree but that he is bothered by the idea that King would be

accepting the logic of the press that if King can control 99%,

and not the 1% who are violent, he is a failure. He said they

must find & way in which they do not accept this otherwise King

will never be able to do anything unless he always spiritually

reaches a level where he hypnotizes every Negro alive.

King questioned how he could say that they can

control the planned demonstrations in Washington, D.C. and at the

same time conclude they are going to have l% violence.

Levison counseled that King can say that he can control

his followers and is not undertaking to control everybody else.

He said King could take the position that his followers are non-

violent and will do what they must do.

They agreed to discuss the matter in depthat a meeting

• in Atlanta, Georgia in King's church office on the morning of

March 30, 1968.

The same source advised on March 31, 1960, that on

that date stanley Levison commented on the meeting held in Atlanta,

Georgia, on March 30, 1908. Levison's comments included the

following:

At the Atlanta meeting they examined the whole Memphis

incident and came up with a new ayproach.

"We are going back to

Memphis.

We are going to prove that you can have mass action

in the streets"

Martin Luther King had decided not to go

oack to Memphis and not to go to Washington (for the Poor People's

campaign. It was the determination of the (SCLC) staff that

Martin Luther King, J:

changed King's thinking.

King is going back to Memphis

on Tuesday (April 2,

1968) and there will be a big march on

Friday (fpril 5, 1968). The Memphis incident was caused by

"a handful of kids" and it could have been controlled by "our

guys" (the SCLC) had they been there.

He, Levison, made the point that they could not let

"a couple of

kids" keep

"mass action" from being their weapon.

As for controlling the Washington, D.C. demonstrations,

King knows he can control the youth.

go to the high schools and tell them what the establishment

wants them to do. Once they grasp this there is no chance of

anything happening. What they (the SCLC) are afraid of in

Washington is a double cross from Stokley Carmichael and the

answer to that is that "our job" (the SCIO") is not to stop violence

but to be non-violent themselves.

are going to go on because to be able to march inthe streets is

"our most important tool" and are not going on the streets because

It may start violence.

"Why do we have to be afraid of riots.

It is their problem not ours".

The Atlanta meeting was good because it shows how

much militancy there is in the SCLC.

A confidential source, who has furnished

reliable information in the past, advised

in April, 1904, that Stanley Levison was

a secret member of the Communist Party,

United States of America (CP, USA), in

July, 1963. In late 1963 andearl ye1964,

he criticized the CP for not being

during the morning of

Jr., President, Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC),

participated in a march in Memphis, Tennessee, conducted by

sanitation workers who are currently on strike in that community.

opinion on March 28, 1968, of Reverend King,

Lee, Special Aide.

to the President, SCIC; and Hosea Williams, Director of Voter

Registration and Political Education,

SCI,

that those responsible

therefor were in no way connected with. SCIC but rather represented

a minority who obviously are neither in sympathy with Reverend

King nor SCLC. Reverend King and his colleagues did not know the

identities of these individuals but suspected they might possibly

be connected with some "black power" organization.

Because of the disturbance in Memphis on March 28, 1968;

Reverend King became extremely dejected and discouraged as to the

prospects for success of SCIC's contemplated Washington Spring

Project (WSP).

Reverend King told his colleagues on this date

that because of his participation in the Memphis march, the

disturbance which developed, and the ensuing publicity he was

gravely fearful that his image and that of SCLo as advocates of

nonviolence will be blemished.

Martin Luther King, Jr.

Security Matter - €

A confidential source, who has furnished reliable

information in the past, learned on March 20, 1960, that,

late on that date, Stanley Levison and Martin Luther king, Jr.

discussed the violence that occurred in Memphis, Tennessee

on March

20, 1960, following King's leadership

of a protest -

march through downtown Memphis. King indicated that he has

become so depressed over the developments in Memphis that

he has considered calling off the Washington March (his

self-described Poor People's Campaign, scheduled to begin in

Washington, D.C. on April 22, 1968).

Levison told King that his depression was aggravated

because he is physically exhausted as a result of his recent

strenuous program. He counseled King not to be on the defensive

over the events in

Memphis but, on the contrary, should take

the position that the majority of people in the Memphis March

did not join in the rioting that took place, proving the

effectiveness of King's leadership and his policy of non-violence.

Levison emphasized that the Washington March will be different

in that King will have organized this march and his forces can

stress the importance of non-violence.

Levison suggested that

Saturday morning (March 30, 1968) would be a better time to

meet in Atlanta to discuss

the Memphis incident rather than

meeting on Friday night (March 29, 1968) because it will give

King time to rest.

Martin Iuther King, JI.

King agreed in every respect with Levison's

evaluation.

The source also ascertained that, prior to conferring

with king, Levison spoke with the Reverend Ralph Abernathy,

an aide of Dr. King's, who advised Levison that king has

cancelled a scheduled

appearance in Washington, D.C. on

March 29,

Abernathy also noted that King is scheduled

to be in Virginia on Saturday (March 30, 1968) but will

probably cancel that appearance.

Abernathy continued that

it was a mistake for the king forces not to have a staff in

Memphis to train people in non-violence. He said it also was

a mistake on the part of the king forces not to have been

more aware of the local situation.

A confidential source, who has furnished

reliable information

in the past, advisec

in April, 1904, that Stanley Levison was

a secret

member of the Communist Party,

United States of America (CP,USA); in

July, 1963. In late 1963, and early, 1964,

he criticized.the CP for not-being

WASHINGTON SPRING PROJECT

Reference is made to our memorandum dated March 19,

1968, and captioned as above, which sets forth information

concerning progress in the organization and planning of the

Washington Spring Project (WSP).

Martin Luther King, Ji., President, Southern

Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC), has publicly announced

he will conduct a massive civil disobedience campaign in the

Nation's Capitol during April, 1968, in an effort to pressure

Congress into passing legislation favorable to the Negro.

In pursuit of this project, the SCLC has opened an

office in Washington, D. C., from which to organize and direct

the WSP.

On March 22, 1968, a press conférence was called by

WSP representatives at the SCLC Office, Washington,D. C. (WDC).

At the conference an announcement was made that King was expected

•to be in WDC on April 22, 1968, to initiate the WSP by presenting

his requests to Congress.

They further announced that late in

April or early May, 1968, they expect three thousand demonstrators

, to arrive.

The emphasis is being placed on the length of the

demonstration rather than the number of demonstrators and they

do not expect the number of demonstrators to exceed five

thousand and will possibly limit the number to that figure. They

expect the demonstrators to remain in WDC as long as necessary or

until they get tired and return to their hones.

A confidential source, who has furnished reliable

information in the past, advised on March 23, 1968, that he had

learned that a meeting had been held on the morning of March 23,

1968, of heads and representatives of various committees

established to organize and plan the WSP. There were approxi-

mately twenty-five people there, including Reverend Walter E

Fauntroy, Vice-Chairman of the Washington City Council, and..

a WDC affiliate of the SCLC.

The chairman of the Food Committee reported that

the Cooks Union had offered their services to the WSP. She

further advised that all food handlers would be screened and

examined.

• A representative of the Xaverian College, 10000

New Hampshire Avenue, White Oak, Maryland, met with the group

and advised the college could handle six hundred people at one

time, The source did not know if this had reference to handling

six hundred people as residents or feeding that number at one

time.

No site has been located on which to erect the "New

City" to house the demonstrators. Three sources from which land

can be obtained were discussed.

They were:

District of Columbia land;

Federal Government land;

Land belonging to churches and private individuals.

Reverend Fauntroy suggested that Billy/Simpson,

3815 Gaorgia Avenue, N.W. be named to head the fund raising

approximately ten persons.

At the meeting Anthony Henry,

recruiter, announced that everyone who will live at the

"New City,

and those who will visit frequently, must be

trained in non-violence. dititu

At the meeting Henry further stated that the

majority of the demonstrators will be Negro; however, they

expect Mexican-American, American Indians, and poor white to

participate also. He pointed out that not much süccess had

been realized in the recruitment of poor whites, as they associate

Martin Luther King with the civil rights movement and they do

not feel

this movement effects them.

Charles E.

Cheng, a representative of the American --

Federation of Teachers, heads the Education Committee for

the

WSP and announced no problem has been experienced in the

recruitment of teachers to staff the "Freedon Schools," which

will be developed for use of children associated with the WSP.

He further announced an intention to appoint six sub-committees

on his Education Committee.

They will be: Orientation;

people in WDC are not in sympathy with Dr. King's demonst-

ration plans. WDC leaders are attempting to evaluate the

potential of Dr. King's impact on WDC, in April. Howard

University students began a sit-in at Howard University on

March 19, 1968, protesting possible disciplinary actions

against students involved in previous disruptive action

on the campus.

III. CURRENT EVALUATION OF VIOLENCE POTENTIAL

Source number one who lives in the Northeast and

works in the Northwest sections of WDC, advised as follows

on March 11, 1968:

The racial situation in WDC appears to be very.

uncertain. Nobody knows what is going to happen in WDC

and many people are scared.

They are not sure what will

happen when Dr. Martin Luther King's "poor people's campaign"

begins in April. Iven though Dr. King has asked the

militants to stay out of the activities, there is no

assurance

the request will be honored.

The March 11, 1968, issue of the "Newsweek"

magazine, page 45 contained a paragraph captioned "Washington".

It stated Washington had never been considered to be a

major racial tinderbox as much of its Negro population works

• for the Federal government and is insulated by civil service

security from the worst chills of black despair. It stated

Washington was facing the summer with nervous uncertainty,

.2nd Dr. King was bringing 3000 demonstrators to Washington

to begin a summer-long campaign of picketing and marching

Ior jobs and income..

The March 12, 1968 issue of "The Evening Star",

a daily WDC newspaper, page B-1 reported that District

• Safety Director Patrick V. Murphy had said the Washington

police hoped to train as many as 2,800 volunteers for

emergency duty this summer in an enlarged "Police Reserver

Corps".

Most of them would be used for station duty and

thus free additional policemen during emergencies.

The March 12, 1968 issue of "Washington Afro-American",

a Washington, D. C. newspaper, page 12, reported that The

National Advisory Commission

on Civil Disorders had said

that «Abrasive relationships between police and non-whites

have been a major source of rioting in the racial ghettos

of American cities".

On March 14, 1968, source number two who works

in the ghettos of WDC and is acquainted with many of the

under privileged advised as follows:

The "poor people's campaign" which is a demonstra-

tion being planned by Dr. Nartin Luther King, Jr. has been

given the support of a number of the larger religious groups

In WDC. The demonstration will show the underprivileged

that much effort is being expended in efforts to improve

their life. It is believed the demonstration will be

beneficial. Plans are being made to have volunteers from

among the demonstrators, who will agree to be arrested if

necessary. It is not believed that any racial trouble will

result from the demonstration.

Source number two further advised as follows:

Stokely Carmichael is in Washington, D. C. and has

organized the Black United Front, (BUF), but it is not

no tad has

believed that Carmichael will have much support from BUF

members if Carmichael decides to create violence in WDC.

The

majority of the BUT members are not expected to support

any plans for racial violence.

On March 14, 1968, source number three who resides

in the Northwest section of

WDC advised as follows:

It is his belief that a riot could take place. in

HDC over some unexpected incident such as the arrest of a Negro.

This has happened in the past in other large cities. Other

than the above situation,

the conditions are such that the

source is optimistic about a riot-free summer in WDC.

Source number four who resides and works in the

ghetto areas of Northwest WDC, advised as follows on

March 18, 1968:

On March 17, 1968; Stokely Carmichael gave a talk

at The Church of The Redeemer, I5th and Girard Streets,

No Eo, WDC at the invitation of the Fellowship Forum of the

church. Among other things, Carmichael said the black people

in the United States must connect with the 900 million black

people of the "third world" to liberate themselves from the

contiol of the white man.

He described the "third world" as

including the black people of Cuba, West Indies, Haiti,

South America and Africa.

He said

the United States is

planning genocide against the Negroes and for this reason

Negroes should arm themselves.

He said he did not mean a

•22. caliber either. He advocated that every black man in the

United States get a gun.

He stated that if Negroes obtained

an arsenal, relations between whites and blacks would be equal.

Source number four further stated as follows:

Carmichael said he realized many black

people do not agree with his ideology, and that there are many

"Uncle Toms" in the community. Carmichael said his group

proposes that if they develop information about a person

"being that way", someone will talk to that person and

attempt to change his mind and "if he does not change his

ways, he will be considered a traitor to his community and all

traitors die". Carmichael said black people should support

the Arabs in any conflict between the Arabs and the Israelis.

•He said the WDC Public School System is 93% Negro and the

curriculum must be changed to be more relative to the Negro

community.

The March 18, 1968, issue of "The Washington

spoken to a racially mixed audience

on March 17, 1968 at The Church of The Redeemer, WDC.

Among

Carmichael's comments to the group were "We are advocating

simply that every black man in this country should get a

gun.

The only reason the honkie (white man) is able to rule

is because he has a gun".

CONFIDEN

The March 18, 1968 issue of "The Evening Star",

a daily WDC newspaper on page B-3, reported that the District

chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of

Colored People had voted to support the goals of the Reverend

DI. Martin Luther King's "Poor People's Campaign".

Source number five who lives and works in the

Northwest section of WDC, on March 18, 1968, advised as

follows:

It is believed there are some individuals in WDC

who may

be inclined toward the creation of racial trouble

in WDC, but these are not likely to initiate any actions

toward

the starting of trouble.

The feeling among many in the

Northwest ghetto is that in order for the "poor people's

campaign" to be successful, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.

will have to bring in outsiders for his reported "civil

disobedience" in WDC. In the event large numbers of outsiders

are brought in, their behavior will be very difficult to

control. Therefore anything may happen.

Source number one further advised as follows on

'March 18, 1968:

In the Northeast area

near the source's residence,

there has been a lack of enthusiasm by the WDC citizens for

Ir. King's "poor people's campaign". These people are not in

sympathy with Dr. King's plans as they fail to see that any

no to ta ton

benefits may result from any demonstration involving civil

•disobedience.

Source number six who resides in Northwest WDC

and is employed in a Northwest ghetto area, advised as

£ollows on March 18, 1968:

The foremost concern of people in WDC is the unknown

potential for racial trouble which could take place when Dr.

Martin Luther King and his "poor people's campaign" begins

in WDC in April 1968.

Many leaders of organizations in WDC

are attempting to evaluate the current and future potential

Of Dr. King's impact on the racial scene of WDC. These

leaders are very concerned and are trying to determine what

response VDC citizens may give Dr. King.

Source number seven who resides in the Northeast

On March 19, 1968 at about 1:30 PM about fifty to

seventy-five students

began

a sit-in in the lobby of the

Administration Building, at Howard University to protest

possible disciplinary action against students who had

participated in previous disruptive activity, on the campus.

On March 19, 1968, Sergeant Silas Vaughn, Intelligence

Division, Metropolitan

about 4:45 PM, on March 19, 1968, approximately one hundred

and fifty students were engaging in a sit-in in the Adminis-

tration Building, Howard University and planned to remain all

night.

According to Sergeant Vaughn, Stokely Carmichael

appeared briefly at the building, but did not participate in

the sit-in and then departed.

THEFTS OF GUNS AND AMMUNITION

Source number eight who is employed in the North-

west section of WDC, on March 18 and 19, 1968 advised as

, follows:

The source has received at least 50 or more handguns

of various types including automatic pistols, snub-nosed

weapons and weapons with a long barrel, from an individual

employed in WDC.

The guns have been obtained from the Fall -

of 1967 to the present time.

These were stolen guns.

and (WILLIAM) VANDEN HEUVEL (an associate of Senator KENNEDY)

spoke to wACHTEL. WaChtel said that "they want to know how far

he's going with the other guy and so on"

did not ask for more than that at the moment. He said that KING

agreed, that they must have

"off the record"

lines open and asked

him, WACHTEL, to

pursue the matter which WACHTEL agreed to do.

WACHTEL said that KING agreed with his suggestion that

maybe this time "we" haye to use them instead of vice versa.

Racial Matters

A confadential source, who has furnished reliable

information in the past,

advised

on March 19, 1905, that on that

date Stanley Levison contacted Harry Wachtel. Levison, referring

to Martin Luther King's Washington, D.C. spring campaign, told

Wachtel that the National Committee

for a Sane Nuclear Policy

passed

a generalized resolution on the (Vietnam) war and

specifically endorsed the Washington campaign.

He added that

Tudja Crowder, whom he described as the new Executive Director

of sane, had contacted him and wanted to nave a meeting on March 20,

1960, with a small group of the sane Directors to have them

briefed by someone from the Southern Christian Leadership Conference

(SCIC) to see how they can tie in.

Levison felt this was important

ana said that, If there is an element of the peace movement they

might get to join "this"

(the Washington Project), it will be

Sane.

• Levisonalso mentioned that the Washington Jewish

Community Council had endorsed the Washington Spring Campaign

because Andrew Young, the Executive Vice President of the SCLC,

had told them that the SCLC would notify the Police on anything

they did. Levison questioned how Young could have promised this

since he and Young had discussed how the building of

"shanty towns"

1968, with Martin Luther King to plan for King's

"they" were not going to notify the Police.

Levison,

apparently alluding to the Jewish Community Council,

said it was

left on the basis that there is a general sentiment

to endorse the objectives but they would like to know more clearly

what

is going to be done and why.

He said this is good because

this

is the Jewish establishment.

Levison described the Washington Jewish Community

Council as the leaders of the Jewish Community Councils all over

the country, all of whom are Democrats and "tied into the machines"

Levison referred to Jack Greenberg (Director of the Legal

. Defense and Education Fund of the National Association for the

Advancement of Colored People stating that Greenberg, in his opinion,

up with the best publicity idea thus far and

that is to

transport a cabin, which people live in, in Mississippi, to

washington, D.C. and present it as a gift to the Smithsonian

the manner in which people live in America

in 1903. Levison said that he, Levison, is pushing 'the "shanty

town thing" but that Greenberg's idea is better.

He added that

he intends to see that Greenberg's suggestion is carried out.

Levison noted that their target in the Washington project

is full employment.

He said a victory. in terms of "countable

jobs would be magnificent for King.

Dear Sir,

Di. Martin Luther King Jr. has announced that he will lead

a "poor peoples' campaign" in Washington, D.C. this spring.

This campaign will demand that the Congress of the United States

take immediate action to provide jubs u Incune for the nation's

must than do million poor. As you must well know, the question

of poverty is the crucial issue facing this country today. It thre-

tens to literally tear the United States apart at the seams. Dr.

King and the Southern Christian, Leadership Conference feel that

the clergy has a moral obligation to take the lead in the quest of

social justice and to reweave the moral fabric of this nation. The

job is massive and the time is short, we must act now. I'm sure

that that point isn't debatabe. The question is , what can we do?

Dr. King has dispatched organizers into fifteen major urban areas

across the nation to bring poor people to Washington in April, 1968

They need your assistance to do their job. Attached is a leaflet

dasignating who the SCLC representative is in your area and where

you can get in touch with him.

Please call him for further information.

It is stated this recruiting drive, aimed at

attracting persons in the hard-core unemployed

have been asked to attend and participate in captioned activities

at Washington, D.C. A lack of funds needed to obtain the required

in the past, has advised that the participation of people from

PROGRESS REPORT

As of this date information received indicates Rev. E.

RANDEL, OSBURN and MICHAEL, BIBLER, who are in charge of the WSP

in Cleveland, have been spending some of their time on recruiting

activities for the wsr, but the bulk of their activity has been

on two

sther projects:

namely, Operation Breadbasket and a strike

at St. Luke's Hospital of the Building -ervice and Maintenance

Union which was

recently settled.

How

that the strike is settled,

OSBURN and BIBIER can devote more time to the wse to recruit the

200 people to travel to Washington, D.C., in April, 1968.

Reportedly Rev. OSBURN is very hopeful of recruiting

these 200 people as he does not feel it is a large number to

obtain as he has recruited larger numbers of individuals in the

past for other projects.

RE: WASHINGION SPRING PROJECT (WSP)

"Since lobbying for meaningful civil rights legis-

lation is the announced goal of Dr. King's efforts, isn't

he really using these unfortunate people who can least

afford the time or money, as human pawns.

Inspiring them

with promises as an inducement to get their participation,

is creating a false hope of personal reward before they

return home. If they return home disillusioned and empty

nanded, they become prime examples of futility in their

communities.

"This must not be permitted to happen.

The best

way to prevent it, is not to take them to Washington

in the first place.

If a demonstration of power or force

oI whatever you want to call it, is deemed necessary in

Washington, then let those who can afford it march on

Congress and the President. Past efforts have proven that

sizeable numbers can be induced to tin out for a just cause.

"I an afraid Dr. King's venture is frought with

Irry dangers and problems.

The Negro has a just cause.

There is urgent need for putting pressure at every point

in our civil rights fight to achieve meaningful results.

This pressure should be pushed at the local, state and

national levels. Every resource

at the Negross command should

be pressed into the fight.

"On this, Dr. King or no one else will find any

opposition. However, doing something just for the publicity

of it and, using unfortunate human beings, is just going too

far.

"It would be most unfortunate if what happened to

the bonus merchers in the late twenties during the Hoover

administration, happened to Dr. King's marchers. Unfortunately,

the present feeling of a large segment of white people is to

use the police force and, even the National Guard and the U.s.

Army to supress any riots. You can see from the way the

Rational Guard acted recently in Orangeburg, s.C., what to.

expect in any future riots. Every law enforcement agency

has been

in special training during the winter months.

RE: WASHINGION SPRING PROJECT (WSP)

"I certainly hope Dr. King and his staff will think

very carefully about what they do and how they do it.

Racial tensions in this country are now at a high pitch.

Entirely too many people are of the mind that another

bloody summer is in the offing. No matter what anybody

says, Negroes have not benefited in any substantial way

from

any riot.

Other than a looters holiday, the riots

of the past have been very costly to all Negroes.

must then do all we can to prevent riots. Washington must

not become another frustrating, bloody battleground."

"The Cleveland Press"

', a Cleveland daily afternoon

newspaper of general circulation, in its March 6, 1968 issue,

page A3, had an article entitled,

"200 Clevelanders Sought

fOr DI.

King's March"

, which read as follows:

"Efforts have begun to enlist 200 Clevelanders to

take part in the 'jobs or income: demonstration to be led

by Ix. Martin Luther King in Washington on Apr. 22.

"The goal is to have 200 representatives from 15

cities, totaling 3000 participants, reported Hilbert

Perry, director of the Bruce Klunder Freedom House.

"The Freedom House is one of three groups here

which have endorsed the demonstration and are recruiting

participants.

The others are Domestic Workers of

America, a union of household workers, and the Cleveland

Welfare Rights Movement, made up mostly of mothers on

relief rolls and their supporters.

"They are attempting to raise funds to charter buses

to Washington and also seeking contributions to pay for child

care of mothers taking part, or families who will volunteer

to tend children.

"IN WASHINGTON, churches are to be asked to provide

meals and lodgings for those taking part.

"Perry said those being recruited here cannot be in-

formed jet of what form the demonstration will taïe be-

cause plans are still being worked out by Dr. King's head-

quarters in Atlanta.

But it is expected to start with mass

calls on senators and representatives from the communities

represented.

For the most part, OSBURN and BIBLER have been working

namely, Cperation Breadbasket, which is a program aimed at

increasing Negro employment through a boycott of various stores

"The Worker", an East Coast Communist newspaper,

WoE.B. Dubols, held at Carnegie Hall, on Friday night,

February 23,

1900. It said that the event was organized by

"Freedomways" Magazine and inaugurated a year of celebration

of the 100th Anniversary of the birth of Dr. DuBois. DuBois

was described as a "scholar, writer, teacher, organizer and

Communist"

The article stated that Dr. Martin Luther King

delivered the address honoring the DuBois Centennial Year.

It recounted King's remarks in praise of DuBois and said

that:

"Summing up DuBois' life, King declared 'We can't

talk of Dr. DuBois without recognizing that he was a radical

all of his life.

some people would like to ignore the faet

that he was a Communist in his later years:

It is worth

noting that Abraham Lincoln warmly welcomed the support of

Karl Marx during the Civil War and corresponded with him

freely'."

The article also stated that "King was vigorously

applauded when he said:

Martin Luther King, Jr., should visit President Johnson

for the purpose of

discussing problems of "ghetto people";

whether King should speak before a joint session of Congress;

and whether the Southern Christian Leadership Conference

should consider legal action against the United States

Government in the form of a lawsuit for payment oi money

to Negroes as reimbursement for the many years they have been

held in "slavery."

Two officials of the Southern Christian Leadership

Conference

met with the "washington Spring Project" staff in

Chicago, Illinois, on March 1, 1968. The Chicago staff members

reported that efforts on their part to date have resulted in

the recruitment of one-hundred individuals who have tentatively

agreed to participate in the "Washington Spring Project."

The

individuals are primarily welfare recipients and youths from

Chicago's near West Side. The Chicago "Washington Spring Pro-

ject"

staff members have also reported that recently efforts

to solicit funds fron former Southern Christian Leadership

Conference contributors have been largely unsuccessful and

appeals for money have been met with flat refusals.

Memorandum G. C. Moore to W. C. Sullivan

RE: MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR.

Levison told Jones that he had received an excellent

response to a recent mailing. The solicitations were running .

ahead of last year with $15,000 being received in one day.

Levison informed that the letter soliciting funds was carefully

written explaining King's project and, because of the success,

he was sending it to 250,000 more people.

Levison also told Jones that things are going well

in the mobilization for the project and King informed him that

|people From Alabama and Mississippi are "just raring to go."

OBSERVATIONS:

On February 28, 1968, a WFO informant informed us

that Bernard Lafayette, project Director for SCLC, had informed

him King's organization is experiencing difficulty with re-

cruiting demonstrators for the "Washington Spring Project."

Because of this, the demonstrations would not start the first

week of April as originally planned.

Another WFO informant learned from Lafayette's

assistant, Anthony Henry, that a secret meeting had been held

by King's group and they had set April 27, 1968, as the date

for the project to start. Henry indicated this date can be

Imoved up or back depending on future developments.

!

It is felt that the President would be interested in

receiving information showing the communist help King is re-

ceiving in his proposed "Washington Spring Project."

RECOMMENDATION:

February 23, 1968.

Levison said he believed it illustrates

the degree of despair and depression prevalent in

He described it as the

"deadest meeting, rogressive

-he had

ever seen and said that people are depressed because they

frustrated over the Vietnam War and also feel there are no

answers to riots in the streets. Referring to Martin Luther

King's speech, he said that King has never read anything as

at the meeting.

He said that King felt it was his duty to

pay a tribute to(w.E.B.) Dubois but also knew it was not really

his (type of crowd.

He said King read his speech as if he

UNITED STATES DEPARIMENT OF JUSTICE

FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION

Jackson, Mississippi

February 23, 1968

WASHINGTON SPRING PROJECT

On February 15, 1968, a source who has furnished

reliable information in the past, advised that Reverend

Martin Luthes King, Jr. traveled to the Edwards, Mississippi

area to attend a meeting held by the Mississippians for

Political Welfare Rights (MPVR). He advised that the pur-

pose of the meeting was for king to solicit support for

his Poor Peoples March at Washington, D.C. in April, 1968,

and also to lend support to MPWR's

activities. Source

related that King planned to complete his appearances in

Mississippi on February 15, 1968, and travel to Montgomery,

Alabama, where a similar meeting was to be held. He advised

that presently in Grenada, Mississippi, Leon Wilbert Hall

and R. B. Cottonreader, Southern Christian Leadership

Conference (SCLC) employees, were actively attempting to

Locate individuals to travel to Washington, D.C. in April,

1968, to take part in the demonstration.

Source advised

that

Reverend B. J. Cameron, President, Grenada County

Freedom Movement, and affiliate of SCLC, will not travel to

Washington in the Spring.

On February 19, 1968, the source advised that Hall

was scheduled to appear before an unknown group at Batesville,

Mississippi, the evening of February 19, 1968, in an effort

to gain support for the Washington Spring Project.

On February 20, 1968, a second source, who has

furnished reliable information

in the past, advised that

Dr. Martin Luther King appeared before a group known as the

National Welfare Rights Organization, together with his

aides, in Chicago, Illinois, on February 3-4, 1968. He

advised that this group is operating in Mississippi as the

MPWR. He stated that delegates from 24 states were present

NW 68262 Docld:32989577 Page 273

## Page 274

WASHINGTON SPRING PROJECT

at the Chicago, Illinois meeting which resulted in a

working coalition being established between this group and

SCLC to bring about a social change in the country.

The

source advised that King also put forth requests for support

of his Poor Peoples March in April at Washington, D.C.

He advised that the delegate from Mississippi was one

Geraldine Smith, Holmes County, Mississippi, and Furthermore

that the National President of this organization was an

individual from Los Angeles, California.

On February 20, 1968, a third source advised that

Martin Luther King's

group is attempting to recruit 200

persons to participate in the April 26, 1968, demonstration

at Washington, D.C.

He related that the primary recruiter

in this project in Mississippi appeared to be Mike Higson,

research worker, Lawyers Committee, 233 North Farish Street,

Jackson, Mississippi.

On February 17, 1968, a fourth source who has

furnished reliable information

in the past, advised that a

recent meeting was held in Washington, D.C. in which

Reverend Martin Luther King and the former SNCC Chairman

Stokely Carmichael were present. A discussion at this

meeting centered around the Washington Spring Project.

The source felt that the Project was completely controlled

by King and that any attempts to take over for the purpose

of promoting violence will meet with little success.

The

source reported that Carmichael stated something to the

effect "If King is going to run it, then that will be

all right".

The source advised that a meeting was to take,

place in Miami, Florida, February 19-23, 1968, and that this

meeting was being financed partially by

the Ford Foundation

for the purpose of training Negro Ministers from large

northern cities in the area of leadership. Source related

that the captioned matter would possibly be discussed

at

the meeting, but that was not the primary purpose for the

session.

FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION

Miami, Florida

February 21, 1968

RE: WASHINGTON SPRING PROJECT

Inspector OWEN W. DAVIS and Detective SILAS VAUGHN,

Metropolitan Police Departnent, Washington, D. C', presently

in miami on assignment, stated February 21, 1968, that they

attended workshop neetings and a general meeting on February

20, 1968.

There was no discussion at these meetings relative

to the Washington Spring Project.

The meetings generally

related to the Ministers Leadership Training Program, as

outlined in a leaflet distributed

to the delegates.

Inspector DAVIS estimated 20 Southern Christian Leadership

Conference (SCLC) members among the delegates.

He said most

of the delegates are ministers from various sections of the

United States.

Inspector DAVIS stated & press conference was held

February 20, 1968, with DX. ANDREW YOUNG and Reverend T. Y.

ROGERS, Jh., answaring nost of the questions.. Dr. MARTIN

LUTHER

KING

was not present at the press conference and has

not been seen at the Sheraton Four Ambassadors Hotel by any

of the security and hotel personel on February 20, 1968, and

the morning of February 21, 1968.

MM I-l furnished the following information; on

February

21, 1968:

The SCIC meeting which he is attending at the

sheraton four Ambassadors, continued througnout

the day of

February 20, 1968, without any major developments.

The group of ministers attending was broken up

into workshop units of approximately nine or ten ministers

each.

Each group had a leader who directed the activities

of his workshop.

One such workshop was directed by Reverend JESSIE

JACKSON, who is & SCLC leader from Chicago. During the

progress of this workshop, Reverend JACKSON made the following

statements:

NW 68262 Docld:32989577 Page 287

---

## Page 288

RE:

WASRINISTOS SPRING PROJECT

He advocated that &t least 1000 ministers go to

rashington to demand that the United States

pull out of

Viet Man.

te felt that if such otivity could be arranged,

it would bring sutiicient weight to bear to cause the

Government to take such action.

Re discussed what was termed bread basket

project"

which ms described as as SCic project wich would be

instituted in the large city grettos, whereir economic

prossure would be brought on white nerchants to employ Negro

help and also on the white business commity to deposit funds

In Negro banks.

These projects vere to be set up in advance

and if the desired result was not obtained, then the SCIC

would resort to picketing and demonstrating and this would be

brought about through pre arrangements whereby it would be

only necessary to make

a nunber of phone calls and give a

code word "knock out" which would bring the desired pickets

and demonstrators tos pe arranged location.

The shove ras discussed in general terns and no

specific cities or areas were mentioned.

But this was

put forth as a project that could be put into effect.

Reverend

JAWES BEVEL, & KINd aide from Chicago,

addresses a group in wich he stated that he jirmly belleved

in burring down the citios if southing significant would

come out of it.

But that he did not believe in burning the

cities just for the sake of burning them.

(JAMES BEVEL. is referred to in the Appendix

section of this wenorandun.)

Reverend BEVEL additionally nade the statement

that he had attempted to got Negro leaders in New York to

burn down the city ween ADAV CLAYION FOrblI lost his

Congressional seat, however, was unsuccessful.

AlSO froM BEVEL'S address, it was apparent that

there is a marked soying

tendency away fron de-segregation

and integration and definite nove by the SCIC toward

economic and political

black power.

RE:

WASHAGTON SPRING FROJECT

Additionally, It vas evident fron BEVEL's address

that there iss groning tendercy to degrade the institutional-

ized church wich wis described as the "Sunday Church" that

well established in this country and to unite all of the

colored churches into one tremendom, poverful group. Also,

there is evidence of attampts to bresk the moral fiber of

attending miristers.

As an example, Reverend BeVEL Stated trat

he was conviered and firmly bellaved tont vary was raped by a

Roman soldier and that Christ sas not the result of a virgin

birth.

(First Name Inknown) WOODRUFF,

an Episcopal minister

Philadelphia was overheard to state that he was head of the

"Liberation School" In Philadelphia and that he had many classes

ả.m2

various homes in the area.

He stated that he was in favor of

using terrorist tactios to achieve the ends of "Black Power."

Also, it was overheard that WoODRuFF allegedly had been

arrested in Nashville,

Pennessee, some time ago for having

operated & "hate school."

On February

21, 1968, MM To2 furnished the

following

information:

At & workshop meeting held or February 21, 1968,

the fact that the Ford Foundation was paying for this

meeting was discussed.

the main topic of ciscussion ras, cowever,

"operation bread basket" which is to be put into effect

by the

ministers when they return to their respective

cities.

This project is to bring economic pressure upon

the white business community in order to secure better

jobs, bester housine, more pay and to generally improve

the

conditions of the Negroes in the large ghetto areas.

This project will take the form of & coordinated,

concerted effort to bring econonic pressure and efforts will

be made to coordinate this program throughout the country so

that economic pressure can be brought on

some specific

segment of the ecoromy on

a national kisis. An example was

given wherein picketing and demonstrations could occur

simultaneously at & businoss enterprise such as "Cosa Cola"

so that on a pre-arranged date and time, pickets and

Tere has been no discussion of the Washington

APPENDIX

JANES BEVEL

BEVEL, 22 early veron, 1906, was Observed to be

present at the offices of the West Side N.E.B. DuBois

Club in Chicago (DCC).

Discussion took piace at this time

centering around reaction to a recent notification that

the Attorney General of the United States intended to label

the

DuBois Clubs as &

Communist front. BEVEL, In conversation,

stated that he wonld

have inored this notification, and kept

about the gork in which he was engaged. He felt that if the

DuBois Clubs have a real program of help for the people, then

people would answer

for the clubs despite any labels applied

Most present agreed that the attack on the Dubois

Clubs was

a part of

the plan by the "establishment" to

undermine the civil rights novement. They felt that the

recent hearings into kler activities in this country was

only a

beginning which wonld lead to & full attack on the

Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC), the real

target.

Ome of those present stated during the

course of

this discussion

that he was not a communist, and to this

BEVEL Has Overkeard to reply that every thinking American

showld be.

He stated that Negroes have not begun to read

yet, but when they do, they will all be socialists.

PURPOSE::

• Attached for your approval for dissemination are

copies of a communication containing information concerning the

progress of Martin Luther King, Jr., President, Southern

Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC), to organize a massive

civil disobedience campaign in Washington, D. C., in the Spring

of 1968. .

BACKGROUND:

King in the past has publicly announced he will

conduct a massive civil disobedience campaign he calls the

"Washington Spring Project" in early April, 1968, to pressure

Congress into passing legislation favorable to the Negro.

'RECENT DEVELOPMENTS:

5- DIsallo

King is currently holding the first of two workshops

from 2/19-23/68 at Miami, Florida. He has invited approximately.

150 Negro ministers throughout the nation to attend this meeting.

The Ford Foundation recently gave King's organization a $230,000

grant to hold these workshops in an effort to develop responsible

leadership in the Negro ghetto areas of the nation's major cities.

It has been determined that King plans to discuss the Washington

Spring Project at this workshop.

DI. John A. Morsell, Assistant Executive Director,

National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP),

has advised his organization is not supporting the Washington

Spring Project and is taking no part in it. He advised the Macka

Memorandum G. C. Moore to W. C. Sullivan

RE: MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR.

has tried, without success, to dissuade King from executing

the Project. Dr. Morsell is afraid that King cannot control

the demonstrators and there is a likelihood that the overall

demonstration will be taken over by extremists.

King appears to be concentrating his attention on

the South where he has chartered a small twin-engine aircraft

to help speed him about urging people to support his campaign.

AT 1387-R advised recently that the entire Washington

Spring Project seems to be suffering from indecision, petty

bickering among the staff members and the idiosyncrasies of

{King's ego. This source advised that King is worried about

the lack of progress being made by his recruiters.

He is

concerned about the success of the program. He has instructed

his staff to seriously consider whether or not they can

successfully carry out the Project. If they cannot then it

will be necessary to establish a reason as to why he finds

it necessary to discontinue the Washington Spring Project.

RECOMMENDATION:

That copies of the enclosures be forwarded to

Mrs. Mildred Stegall at the White House; Mr. William Welsh,

Administrative Assistant to the Vice President; Secretary of

Agriculture Freeman; Secretary of Labor Wirtz; Secretary of

Defense; Secret Service; the Attorney General; the Deputy

Attorney General; Assistant Attorneys General

ment; and to the Departments of Army; Navy; and Air Force.

MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR.

This past week King concentrated his attention on

the South and spoke at rather large gatherings in Birmingham,

Montgomery, and Selma, Alabama.

King has chartered a small twin-engine aircraft to

help speed him about the South urging people to support his

Washington Spring Project:

Another source advised recently that the entire

Washington Spring Project seems to be suffering from indecision,

petty bickering among the staff members, and the idiosyncrasies

‚of King's ego.

This source advised that King is worried about

the lack of progress being made by his recruiters. He is con-

cerned about the success of the program.

He has instructed his

staff to seriously consider whether or not they can successfülly

carry out the Project. If they cannot, then it will be necessary

to establish a reason as to why he finds it necessary to dis-

continue the Washington Spring Project.

In this connection, the "Miami Herald" newspaper on

February 18, 1968; reported that some Negro leaders will urge

• King to detour his planned massive civil disobedience demon-

stration scheduled for April, 1968, in Washington, D. C.; and

redirect the demonstrators to the local districts of Congressmen

who have voted against civil rights legislation. These leaders

feel that Congressmen do not care what happens in

Washington, D. C., but they would feel the impact of these

demonstrations in their home districts.

UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE

FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION

Miami, Florida

February 20, 1968

RE: WASHINGTON SPRINE PROJECT

:

Reference is made to communication from this Bureau

dated February 19, 1968.

The "Miami Herald" a local Miami, Florida, newspaper

on February 20, 1968, reported that Dr. MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR.,

opened a series

of meetings in Miami, Florida, on February

1968, designed to help Negro clergymen minister to the social

and economic needs of their congregations.

ed that Dr. KING and Reverend ANDREW YOUNG, one of his top aides

im the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC), said

five-day series of conferences will not include planning for

civil rights or anti-var demonstrations.

It was also reported that Dr. KING and Reverend YOUNG

both said they did not expect STOKELY CARMICHAEL and RAP BROWN,

leaders of the vocal Black Nationalist militancy to attend.

However, Reverend YOUNG said, "If STOKELY and RAP come we

won't throw them out." This

article goes on to report that

• In sadition to the 150 official delegates, about su more

ministers are expected to attend the meetings, which are not

open to the public.

It was reported that about 125 delegates attended a

luncheon on February 19, 1968, and neard a talk by or: k. A.

ABERNATHY, a VICe-President of SCLC.

In addition, this

article reports that three lecturers; followed by workshop

sessions, are scheduled for February 20, 1968.

MM T-1 advised that the Ministers Conference at the

sheraton four Ambassadors, Miami, Florida, opened on schedule

on February 19, 1968:

welcoming the group, Dr. MARtIN

LUTHER KING, JR, reiterated that the purpose

of this

conference was for discussion, study and training in

connection with problems facing the Negroes in the big city

areas.

RE: FASHINGTON SPRING PROJECT

He further stated that attention fould be given to

attempting to reconcile the term "black power" with the over-

all civil rights novement in the United States. During the

opening conference, nonviolence was continuously stressed.

Dr. KING stated that over-integration could occur to

the point that Negroes could lose their identity. He gave

as an example the integration of the Methodist Church, however,

this was not further explained.

The only renark that was made to the people in

attendance relative to the "Washington trip" was that this

conference in Miami would not be used for the purpose of

recruiting people for the trip to Washington, nor would it be

& topic of discussion.

On February 20, 1968, the entire group will be broken

no into "workshop units"

according to their interest and needs

of the area from which the various ministers came. All leaders

are to take part in the activities of the workshop and report

back to the entire assemoly.

During the opening day of this meeting, only one

item of dissension occurred and that involved some opposition

to the fact that apparently DAN MoNARAs, who was formerly

connected with urban Housing, has been invited to address

• the

conference in Miani. Some ministers disagreed with this

invitation, however,

Reverend ANDREY YOUG stated that his

presence could contribute to the conference, and that he

should be neard.

On February 20, 1968

Lieutenant HARVERT SWILLEY,

Intelligence Unit,

Miami, Florida, Police Department, reported

that several items of literature

were being passed out to the

delegates.

Included in the literature was a

leaflet captioned

•The Southern Christian Leadership Conference" and outlines.

the purpose of the training program.

In addition, a state-

ment made by Di. MARTIN LUTHER KING,

December 4, 1967, which statement relates to

Spring project, was also being passed out.

These two items are quoted as follows:

"'...transforming the inchoate rage of the

ghetto into a creative force for change...'

"The Ministers Leadership Training Program is

designed to train local leaders in the knowledge of

the many problems which the residents of the ghetto

face and in ways of solving these problems.

Our

focus is the Black Preacher and the Black church for

we believe that the greatest potential power for

controlling the forces which make and sustain as well

as those which can change the structure of the ghetto,

is within the Black church. He further believe that

because of the central place for which the Black

church holds in the Negro commity, ve can develop

the kind of leadership which will develop programs to

transfer control of the ghetto to those who reside :

there.

Finally, the Southern Christian Leadership

Conference is an extension of the church and therefore

much of our emphasis should be on strengthening the

witness of the church in areas of life where problems

are greatest.

"The Ministers Leadership Training Program will be

conducted in fifteen metropolitan areas of our nation.

We have selected a minimun of eight and a maximum

of twenty preachers from these fifteen areas, depend-

ing upon the size and population, who will participate

in our program.

Our program begins with an orientation

workshop in Miani, Florida.

This workshop 1s

designed to acquaint the preachers who will partici-

pate in our program with the over all history and

philosophy of the Southern Christian Lesdership

Conference and with the programs which demand our

concern at present.

This workshop is also designed

to acquaint the participants with

and the possibility of destroying the ghetto by re-

structuring and changing ornership of

"Statement by Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.

President, Southern Christian Leadership Conference

Atlanta, Georgia

"December 4, 1967

*Ladies and Gentlemen:

"Last week the staff of the Southern Christian

Leadership Conference held one of the most important

meetings we have ever convened.

We had intensive

discussions and anelyses of our work and of the

challenges which confront us and our nation, and at

the end we made a decision which I wish to announce

today.

"The Southern Christian Leadership Conference

will lead waves of the nation's poor and disinherited

to Washington, D. C., next spring to demand redress of

their grievances by the United States government and

to secure at least jobs or income for all. .

"We will go there, we will demand to be heard,

and we will stay until

America responds. If this

means forcible repression of our movement; we will

confront it, for we

have done this before. If this

means scorn

or ridicule, we embrace it, for that is

what America's poor now

receive.

If it means jail, we

accept it willingly, for the millions of poor already

are imprisoned by exploitation and discrimination.

But we hope, with growing confidence, that our campaign

in Washington will receive at first a sympathetic

understanding across our nation, followed by dramatic

expansion of nonviolent demonstrations in Washington

and simultaneous protests elsewhere.

In short, we

will be petitioning our government moves against

poverty.

"We have now begun preparations for the

raspington campaign.

Our staff will soon be taking

new assignments to

organize people to go to Washington

from 10 key cities and 5 rural areas..

This will be

no mere one-day march in Washington, but a trek to

the nation's caplial by suffering and outraged citizens

"In the coming weeks we will disclose our

anticipate from other organizations and thousands of

individuals.

"America is at a crossroads of history, and it

is critically important for us, a nation and a society,

to choose a new path and move upon it with resolution

and courage.

"It is impossible to under-estimate the crisis we face

in America.

The stability of a civilization, the potential

of free

government, and the simple honor of men are at

stake.

"Those who serve in the human-rights movement,

Including our southern Christian Leadership Conference,

are keenly aware of the increasing oitterness and

despair and frustration that threaten the worst chaos,

hatred and violence any nation has ever encountered.

sense, we are already at war with and among

Or a nation gorged

citizens are denied a good education, adequate health

services, decent housing, meaningful

employment,

and even

respect, and are then toid to

be responsible.

"The true responsibility for the existence of

these deplorable conditions lies ultimately with the

larger society, and much of the immediate respon-

sibility for removing the injustices can be laid

directly at the door of the federal government.

"This is the institution which has the power to •

act, the resources to tap, and the duty to respona.

And

yet, this very government now lacks the will to

make reforms which are demanded by & rising chorus

across the nation. According to the Harris Poll, for

example, a substantial majority of Americans believe

that we

must proceed at once

• to tear down and rebuild

the slums, and a solid majority feel that everyone

should have & job. Concerned leaders of industry, civil-

rights organizations, labor unions and churches are

joining in such groups as the new Urban Coalition to

urge progressive economic neasures at the rational

level:

Many urban political leaders are ready to

carry out enlightened programs i1 only the federal

government will provide the needed financial support.

Newsweek magazine recently devoted an entire issue to

the problen of racism in America and set forth some

sound proposals for dealing with this situation.

"I cite these facts merely to show that a clear

majority in America are asking for the very things

which we will demand in

fashington.

"We have learned from hard and bitter experience

in our movement that our government does not move to correct

a problem involving race until it is confronted directly

and dramatically.

it required a Selma before the

fundamental right to vote was written into the federal

statutes. It took a Birminghan to dramatize the

economic

plight of the Negro, and compel the government

to act.

"Unrest anong the poor of America, and particularly

among Negroes, is

growing rapidly.

In

this age of

technological

wizardry and political immorality, the

poor are demanding that the basic need of people be met

Poor

people can not long be placated by the glamour of

multi-billion-dollars exploits in space. Poor people

who encounter racial discrimination every day in every

aspect of their lives can not be fooled by patronizing

gestures and half-way promises.

Poor people who are

treated with derision and abuse by an economic system

soon conclude with elementary logic that they have no

rational interest in killing people 12,000 miles away

in the pare of defending that system.

"We intend to channelize the smouldering rage and

frustration of Negro people in to an effective, militant

and nonviolent movement of massive proportions

calling on the swelling masses of young people in this

country who are disenchanted with this mterialistic

society, and asking them to join us in our new

Washington movement.

He also look for participation

by representatives of the millions of non-Negro poor-

Indians, Mexican-Americans, Puerto Ricans, Appalachians,

and others.

And we shall welcone assistance from all

Americans of good will.

"And so, we have decided to go to Washington and

to use any means of legitimate nonviolent protest

necessary to move our nation and our government on a

new course of social, economic, and political reform.

As I said before, the power to

initiate this reform

resides in washington.

a free

society depends upon the guarantee and

survival of freedom and equality. This is what we

seek.

"In the final analysis, SCLC decided to go to

Washington because, if we did not act, we would be

abdicating our responsibilities as an

organization

committed to nonviolence and freedom. We are keep-

In this way, we can work creatively against the

RE: WASHINGTON SPRING PROJECT

Reference is made to communication from the Miami

Office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation dated February

10, 1968.

The "Viami Herald," a local Viani, Florida, newspaper,

reported February 18, 1968,

that some Negro

leaders,

not further

identified, will urge Dr. MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR., at meetings

in Miami, Florida, to detour his planned massive civil dis-

obedience demonstration scheduled for April in Washington, D.C.

The Negro leaders will recommend that efforts be redirected

to demonstrate in districts of Congressmen who have voted

against civil rights legislation.

The "Miami Herald" reported that one prominent civil

rights leader, who requested his identity be withheld, said

"Congressmen could care less about demonstrations in Washington--

and Negroes could be made to look bad nationally. But if the

demonstrations are held in the home districts of certain

Congressmen they most certainly will feel the impact."

MM T-I advised on February 19, 1968, that Di. MARTIN

LUTHER KING, JR., arrived at the Sheraton Four Ambassadors

Hotel at 10:30 PM

on February 18, 1968.

utilize the suite reserved for him and kept moving from room

to room. Two of DI. KING's aides, identified as Dr. A. YOUNG

and Reverend F. C. BENNETT,

made & thorough check of the

room reserwed for

Dr. KING, apparently looking for a "bugging

device."

Dr. KING, through Dr. YOUNG and Reverend BENNETT,

according to the source, has already refused to be interviewed

by the

various news media and it appeared to the source that

KING was quite concerned with the anount of security being

effected by the Sheraton Four Ambassadors Rotel, along with

local authorities.

Re: WASHINGTON SPRING PROJECT (WSP)

CONFIDENTIAL

a serious threat against the life of Martin Luther King and

that an attempt upon his life will be made during this march.

In order to counteract such an attempt, Reverend Bennette

was assigned to be in charge of security for Martin Luther

King and Ralph Henry was assigned to be Reverend Bennette's

assistant. It was indicated that those involved in this

security should be alert for danger, not only from white

persons but also from Negroes. No additional information

was given at this time concerning any possible threats.

It was reported by several of those present that

serious difficulty had been encountered in the northern states

in recruiting participants for the Washington Spring Project.

It was, therefore, decided to concentrate the recruitment of

participants in the southern states.

It was also reported that serious financial problems

have developed, especially in certain areas. Hosea Williams

presented proposed budgets for the "financially deprived or

unresponsive areas involved in the Washington campaign." He

stated that for one reason or another the following areas

seemed to be having unsolved financial problems in getting

their mobilization and recruiting started:

Mississippi

Alabama

Georgia

North Carolina

South Carolina

Virginia

Washington, D. C.

Baltimore, Maryland

Williams, stated that it was originally planned that

each project area

was to raise its own funds, however,

does not seem possible in the

poorer areas at this time. • He

reported that he had conferred with project leaders in the

above areas and they state that they can do the job provided

they are

furnished the resources to get it started.

Based on

Williams'

conversations

with these leaders, a budget has been

arawn up for each of the above areas which

provides between

$1,200 to $1,500 per month with the exception of South Carolina

which will receive $740 and Washington, D. C.; which will

receive $3,500.. These budgets include

payments for items

overall supervision of SCLC personnel involved in this

project (re Atlanta airtel and LHM 2/2/68). ANDREW J.

instructed by KiNG to write a letter to each

SCIC staff

to recruit demonstrators for the WSP in which he was

position.

On 2/12/68 WILLIAMS determined this letter had

not been written and as a result SCLC personnel did not

know to whom they should report or from whom to seek

assistance.

WILLIAMS also submitted during the 2/12/68

meeting

a memorandum in which he requested a budget (of approximately $10,000)

a secretary, and an Assistant in order to effectively supervise

the WSP.

There then ensured at this meeting considerable

petty discussion as to the validity of WILLIAMS' requests.

WILDLAN A. RUTHERFORD, Executive Director, SCLC, made 22

issue over the fact he did not have the time or

inclination

to pass judgment on a multitude of vouchers which WILLIANS

would submit in connection with his budget.

WILLIAMS became

enzaged and left the meeting for almost an hour. KING made

no effort to contol the disorganized discussion or to render

& docision.

The 2/12/68 meeting adjourned without the staff

renching a decision on WILLIAMS' requests. KING, YOUNG,

PANTRENFORD, and RALPH D. ABERNATAX,

Vice President and

treasurer, Scie, were supposed to meet regarding these issues or 2,13/7

Informant did not have opportunity to participate in this

meeting and as of 2/14/68 had no further information regarding

this matter.

Informant observed that there appears to be a

costinuing battle of personalities between WILLIAMS and

RUPEERFORD. He also observed that KING seems to be in a

substantial twofold dilenna predicated upon his tremell-

anas ego, ie.; one,

should he cooperate fully with WILLIAMS

which probably will insure the success of the WSP but at

the same time will permit WILLIAMS to have the limelight and

possibly become a virtual hero; two, should he keep WILLIAMS

more or less throttled despite his refusal to accept WIllAUS?

recent resignation and take a chance the WSP will be successful

without the benefit of WILLIAMS' full energies or take a chance

the WSP may not succeed and have the national and international

image of MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR., become tarnishea..

1t is

because of the latter informant

believes that KING has indicated

he is considering the possibility of finding an excuse to drop

the WSP.

Based upon information herein and previous information

submitted it is felt informant's observations are reasonaby

accurate.

Almost half

by SCLe to recruit and train its WSP demonstrators has passed and

the entire project seems to be suffering from indecision and

WASHINGTON SPRING PROJECT

RACIAL MATYYER.

A confidential source on February 14, 1968, advised

he had learned that reverend Martin Luther King, Jr., President,

southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC), continueu

to

be discouraged with the lack of progress made by SCLC staff

members in recruiting and training demonstrators for SCLC's

'Washington Spring.

Project, (WSP). In this connection Reverend

King recently held an

officers to consider the WSP.

"emergency meeting" of the SCIC Executive

Reverend King pointed out that SCIC has prevously

announced that it will have 3,000 demonstrators in Washington,

D: Co, in early April 1968, should only a few hundred demonstrators

appear in Washington, D. C., Reverend King said he and SChC would

become the laughing stock of the nation.' He declared that if

SCIC produces 3,000 demonstrators and the nation fails to react

appropriately this will be the responsibility of the nation

and not SCIC. On the other hand, he said, SCIC will be greatly

at fault if it does not produce the announced number of

demonstrators.

Reverend King suggested that officers of SCLC seriously

consider whether or not they can successfully.carry out the

planned WSP. He said if they feel,they cannot then it will be

necessary to establish a reason as to why he and SCIC finds

it necessary to discontinue the

WSP.

In the afternoon when a free period was scheduled plus

dinner and more meetings of other groups were scheduled

Since no more than 15.

people showed up to take part in KING's activity at the

church, Dr. KING held a press conference at 11:45 a.m.

H1S

remarks to the assembled press dealt mainly with the Vietnam

war, national policy of the United States Government, and

Pueblo incident.

Dr. KING then left the church for lunch and

shortly after 3:00 poll. he returned to the church at the

Insistence of the Rev. ANDERSON, whereupon KING agreed

reluctantly to address the group with the stipulation he

spend no more than 15 minutes with them. There were approxi-

mately 20 people spoken to by Dr. KING.

The source advised that Dr. KING was extremely

agitated, and aisappointed by the lack of atten-

WASHINGTON SPRING PROJECT

A conversation was overheard to the effect that

ORANGE,

who is in charge of the Philadelphia office at 2102

Diamond Street of SCIC's Washington Spring Project, said this isa

temporary headquarters and will only be used in an attempt

to secure partioipants

for the Washington Spring Project.

KING has no further plans of any activity in Philadelphia

other than this recruitment.

KING's plans for meeting with groups on Saturday

morning were cancelled and according to press publicity KING

was suffering from laryngitis; however, it 1s the considered

opinion of the source that KING was piqued at the lack of

attendance at the Friday meetings.

The source also advised that there had apparently

been a concerted effort made by some unknown individual to

persuade ministers not to cooperate with KING by not showing

up at the Friday morning first conference.

This could very

Ilkely be true since there were only two Negro ministers on:

hand for the Friday morning meeting.

It would also appear from overheard conversations

and comnents that KING's advance men, DRANGE and TABB, did

not do an effective job.

Dr. KING left by air at 12:30 D.M., February 10,

1968, for Atlanta, da.

RE:

WASHINGTON SPRING PROJECT

CONFIDINTIAL

On January 22, 1968, a second confidential source,

advised an SA of the FBI that a

workshop to study non-violent

demonstration techniques was held at the Ohio State University

Student Union building, Columbus, Ohio, on January 20 and 21,

1968.

The second confidential source

advised as follows:

The workshop was scheduled to be held from

10:00

a.I. to 11:00 p.M., January 20, 1968, and from 11:00 a.m.

to 11:00 p.u., January 21, 1968.

participants in

the workshop did not begin arriving for the workshop until

late in the afternoon of January 20, 1968. There were approxi-

mately twenty-six individuals present when the workshop finally

got underway.

Pat Shafer, field secretary of the Ohio Peace

Action Council, was in charge of the workshop.

The principal speakers at the workshop were

Reverend Ed Randall Osburn, Cleveland, Ohio, associated with

the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC); Mike

Bibler; and James Bristol, associated with the American

Friends Service Committee: (AFSC) • Reverend Osburn had driven

to the workshop from Cleveland, Ohio, with Mike Bibler, while

James Bristol had flown by airplane to Columbus, Ohio, from

Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

From the afternoon of January 20, 1968, to the

conclusion of the workshop on that date, there was no discussion

of non-violent demonstration techniques.

The discussions

centered around the Washington Spring Project, being sponsored

by the SCLC at Washington, D.C., during the summer of 1968.

During their comments to the group, Reverend Osburn,

Bibler, and Bristol indicated they had attended

a meeting of

Project. It was apparent that those three individuals had

been scheduled to attend the workshop in the Ohio Union building

for some time.

Reverend Osburn indicated the demonstration in

Washington, D. C., would be composed initially of about 3,000

people from poverty areas in the united states, including whites,

• Negroes, and Puerto Ricans.

Those persons would travel to

Washington, D. C., and during the first week or ten days would

demonstrate on the issues of poverty and jobs. After that

period, the demonstration would pick up the peace issues.

RE: KASKINGTON SPRING PROJECT

CONT

Reverend Osburn indicated the Washington, D.C.,

demonstration wouid be & continuous program. The initial

3, 000 demonstrators would live in Washington, D.C., and carry

out demonstrations in the offices of Government officials and

in other pisces. In the event any of the original 3,000

demonstrators were removed by arrest or any other reason,

they would be replaced by other persons coming from the

arca from which the original demonstrator had come.

Reverend Osburn emphasized that it was belleved

this would be the last chance to prove non-violent demonstrations

coulú be ejiective in obtaining concessions on civil rights

matters.

Reverend Osburn stated if that effort failed, black

nationlist groups would take over the leadership in civil

rights matters.

In connection with that sttuation, Reverend •

Osbury remarked, "Let's hope this works".

Bibler and Bristol, in their talks to the group

attending the workshop, added nothing new, but supported the

statimonts made by Reverend Osburn.

All three speakers made

frequent favorable references to Martin Luther King.

It was dotermined that Bristol anticipated there

Washinston, D.C, demonstration.

Bibler Fointed out what he believed the civil

rights moverine nad to accompiish to be eriective.

Bibler

listed those as follows:

1. Gather information

2. Education of psople.

3: Negotiations.

Confrontation and demonstration

5. Reconciliation.

Bibler was somewhat critical of peace groups and

adicared he felt they had not accomplished anything.

1. Non-cooperation with an unjust law.

2. Non-cooperation with a just law to emphasize

an unjust situation not regulated by law.

Bristol poirted out that the technique of blocking

traffic was a case in which the traffic laws were just, but

it could be used to emphasize a situation into lving an

unjust

jaw.

It was mentioned that as a technique, the demonstrators

is washington, D. C., could tie up traffic. That could be

arcomplished without breaking a law, because while there are

laws which require a person to obey

Jaws requiring a person to drive on the green light.

A brochure, "Training In Non-Violence," published

by the fellowship of Reconciliation, was available at the

workshop. A bookiet, "Theory and Practice of Civil Disobedience,"

by Arthur Harver, Centerbury, New Hampshire, also was aval l-

able, and a charge of fifty cents for that booklet was requested.

The workshop concluded at approximately 10:30 p.m.

on January 20, 1968.

Most of the persons present indicated

they would inturn for the neeting on January 21, 1968, 1nas-

much as many of the twenty-six individuals present appeared

to be Ohio State University students.

On January 19, 1968, Pat Shafer had emphasized

that selection of individuals to attend the workshop on January 20

and 21, 1968, should be done with great care, and persons

attending would be expected to have the ability to return to

their own areas and lold workshops on non-violence.

"The Southern Patriot"

, à monthly publication,

shows that it is published by the Southern Conference

Educational Fund, Inc. (SCEF).

"The Southern Patriot" was cited as an "organ"

of the: Southern Conference for Human Welfare (SCHW) by the

Committee on Un-American Activities, House Report 592, June 12,

2947.

The SCHV was cited as a

communist front by the

Committee on Un-American Activities, House Report 592, on

June 12, 1947.

An amendment to the charter of the SCHW dated

April 26, 1946,. changed the name of that organization to the

scer and

listed iis purpose as being to improve the

juccrions 1 and cultural standards of tha Southern people

in scordancs with the highesi American democratic institutions,

irssitions, and ideals.

The SCEF is self-described as having deep roots in

ths South where it began as the educational wing of the Schw,

organized in 1938 to work for economic and political reform.

When the SCal disbanded in the late 1940's, SCEF continued as

an independent organization, rallying support for integration

and denocracy and helping to

stimulate and nurture new

novements of the early 19E0's. The SCEF maintained head-

quarters in Louisiana for twenty years, but in 1966 moved 1ts

headquirters to Louisville, Kentucky.

A source advised on March &, 1961, that Claude

Lighitoot, a Communist Party Functionary, stated at a meeting

oi the Conmunist Party in Baltimore, Maryland, on February 25,

1961, that the Communist Party is

not connected with any

progiessive movemeni, but indirectly they do have some

influence in the SCEF.

A second source, who is familiar with some phases

of Communist prity activity in the New Orleans area, advised

on June 8, 1S6t, that during the time that the SCHW

was

in existence monsses of the Communist Party were members of

and worked actively in the SCil; however, since the formation

of ihe SCEF Communist Party members have

not been encouraged

to work in he SCEF. The source stated that the SCEF is a

progressive liberal organization, which he considers a

Conmurist Party front organization because it has gone along

with the Communist Party on certain issues, particularly on

the racial issue.

the following information:

Fifty-six suites of the Sheraton-Four Ambassadors

Hotel have been booked through Freddie Henderson Travel

Bureau, Atlanta, Georgia, for the period February 19 - 23,

1968.

The suites are for Dr. MARTIN LUTHER KING and his

party, estimated to be 150-200 persons. Fifty of the suites

are deluxe roons that can accommodate three to four individuals,

and six of the suites are executive rooms. In addition, the

Pan American Room, which can acconmodate two hundred people,

is being reserved

for DI. KING and his party. A request has

been received to arrange for two luncheons, and in addition, a

request has been received for extra meeting.rooms.

The

• additional meeting rooms are not available; however, the

six executive rooms are sufficiently large to handle a group

of 20 persons each.

With regard to security, arrangements have been

made to hire one off-duty Miami police officer to stand

guard at the entrance to the suite to be occupied by Dr.

Also, one off-duty Miani police officer and one off-

Miami detective will be hired and stationed in the

vicinity of the lobby and report on any unusual activity

and in particular to report on pickets and demonstrators.

Additional security will also be afforded through the 20

men regularly assigned to security at the hotel.

According to BOURGET, WOODALL has

indicated to him that he is extremely "anti-MARTIN LUTHER KING"

and has agitated against KING in the past, in various locations.

WOODALL displayed a photo scrapbook regarding his picketing of

KING. Working with WOODALL at the hotel is one THOMAS FISHER,

According to BOURGET, FISHER appears to be a

supporter of KING rather than agitator.

ASHAUER stated that he has discussed this matter in

detail with Sergeant EVERETT KAY, Intelligence Unit, Miant'yo

Florida, Police Department, and every effort is being made

insure no trouble develops as a result of WOODALL's attitude

toward Dr. KING.

On February 6, 1968, ALPHONSO WOODALI telephonically

contacted the Miami Office of

the Federal Bureau of Investi-

gation, to report that he is currently employed at the Four

Ambassadors.

He reported that Dr. MARTIN LUTHER KING will be

staying at the hotel in the near

future.

He went on to

relate that he had been questioned by members of the Southern

Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) Miami, Florida, if he

was going

• to picket DI. KING when KING arrives in town.

WOODALL stated that he

informed SCLC that he had no plans to

picket KING or to do anything against KING during KING's visit

to Miami.

on February 9, 1960, MM II, who has furnished

..

reliable information in the past, advised that ALPHoNSo WoODALI

is well know to him. He reported that WOODALL is violently

opposed to all that Dr. MARTIN LUTHER KING stands for and

that it could be expected that WOODALL will attempt some type

of protest, during KING's visit to Miami.

RE: WASHINGTON SPRING PROJECT

ALPHONSO WOODALL first came to the attention of

the Miami Office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation on July

I], 1967, when he telephonically advised that a group of

Negroes were meeting at the Mary Elizabeth Hotel, Miami,

Florida. When contacted on July 31, 1967, WOODALL displayed

newspaper clippings concerning himself.

These articles

indicated that in April, 1967, he picketed Dr. MARTIN

LUTHER KING in Cleveland, Ohio. He picketed KING because

of KING's stand against

the war in Viet Nam. It was also

indicated in the clippings that he picketed KING because he,

WOODALL, had anl8 year old son who was killed in Viet Nam

in January, 1967.

WOODALL Fas also quoted in these articles as

saying he was going to get STOKELY CARMICHAEL with violence

when he comes to Miami; however, CARMICHAEL has never come

to Miami.

It was also indicated that he threw a brick through

the window of Congressman ADAM CLAYTON POWELL'S campaign.

headquarters in New York City a few years ago. He hoped to.

get arrested and then expose the way POWELL was financing his

campaign for re-election to Congress. According to WOODALL,

they just repaired the window and never said anything.

When questioned concerning these articles,

' WOODALL stated that he never intended to commit any

act

of violence if CARMICHAEL had come to Miami, but merely

intended to picket him as he had KING, and was misquoted

by newspapers.

On August 2, 1967, WOODALL telephonically contacted

the Miami Office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation at

about midnight. At this times

he appeared to be very upset,

and WOODALL stated that he had heard that MARTIN LUTHER KING

was going to come to Miami in the near future and that he was

going to again picket him.

He indicated that this picketing

would be of a peaceful nature.

WOODALL appears to become upset over information

concerning KING because of the death of his son in Viet Nam

and also because he has

another son currently serving in

the United States Army.

On the morning of August 4, 1968, WOODALL

telephonically contacted the

Miami Office,

at which time

- 3 -

RE: WASHINGTON SPRING PROJECT

he apologized for his being upset when he last called

the Office. He advised that he had received a letter from

his son, ALPHONSO WOODALL, IR., who is currently in the

United States Army and due to go to viet nam.

He stated that when he heard that KING was

coming ke became upset, recalling his anti-Viet Nan war

stand.

He advised that if he picketed KING, it would

be of a peaceful nature and according to the laws

of the

City. of Miami.

Rutherford related that the day following the

meeting "with these guys"

• Rutherford

stated that he told Stokely (Carmichael) that he, Rutherford,

wanted to hear what Stokely had to say and that stokely

gave some "mealy-mouthed excuses" that did not stand up.

Rutherford also noted that he told Carmichael that "these

men told us" that they are interested in the total

destruction of the United States.

Levison commented that he had heard Stokely say

comment was that "this is what

everybody was opposing him.

Levison commented that he could not see the SCLC

letting ten persons who threaten violence take over from

hundreds.

He described it as a dangerous thing, a king of

black facism.

Rutherford, in referring to the meeting, related

that a person named

Courtland (phonetic), whom he described

as naving been with the congress of racial Equality, made

the statement that "they" would not support "our campaign"

in washington, D.C., but would not participate in any

opposition to it.

He said this is

"their whole life", that

although they could not take part in sometning they do

not believe in, even though they have trouble from their

constituents, they would not oppose it because anything

that leads to liberation is worthwhile.

Rutherford said that King became very upset after

that if, "they" should

non-violence would have a better chance of succeeding.

He added that Stokely responded that they have enough

In the black community, and that, if they should speak

out against King or what he is doing, people will not

know which way to turn.

Levison commented that he agreed with Carmichael

and disagreed with King on this point. He inquired as to

why King was upset.

Rutherford stated that King said the enemy was

violence and began to preach on how violence begets

violence.

Levison related that the key is that King states

the enemy is violence which is not true. The enemy are

them from getting rights and violence

is one of the methods. He said that, therefore, they are

trying to develop a counter technique to violence.

"The Worker"

, an East Coast Communist newspaper,

in its issue dated February 11, 1960, page one, contains

an article on the protest against United States involvement

in the war in Vietnam in Washington, D.C. on February

5,6, 1968, sponsored by the Clergy and Laymen Concerned

About Vietnam. It states that King addressed the gathering

of clergymen and laymen and told them that "it was imperative

that the freedom and peace movements be joined. Describing

the worsening economic conditions, he appealed to the

religious leaders to join and support the demonstrations his

organization has planned for Washington in April"

article also notes that King made it clear that the targets

of the demonstrations would be the Vietnam war and Congress.

RACIAL MATTER

Reference is made to Chicago memorandum of

February 2, 1968, under the caption,

"Washington Spring

Martin Luther

King, Jr. was

to be in Chicago on that date

where he was to appear as a speaker for the West Side

•Organization (WSO), a small West Side Civil Rights group

in Chicago.

On February 5, 1968, a confidential source,.

which collects intelligence information in the Chicago area,

advised that Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., President, Southern

Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC), headquartered in

Atlanta, Georgia, had arrived in Chicago at 11:20 a.m. on this

• date from Atlanta,

via Delta Airlines Flight 614.

King was

accompanied by SCLC officers, Reverend Andrew Young and

Reverend Ralph Abernathy.

A second confidential source, who has furnished

reliable information in the past, advised on February 5, 1968,

that King was in Chicago at this time generally to provide

impetus to the local organizing efforts in behalf of the

WSP, a program whereby the SCLC plans to mobilize large

numbers of persons in Washington, D.C. during April, 1968,

to protest United States Government

failures to solve the

problems of the

wash de poor.

# In this connection King reportedly planned to met with

George/ Wiley, believed to be from New York City, and who is

head of the National Welfare Rights Organization (NVRO) • The

NWRO is currently holding a three-day convention in Chicago.

According to this source, Wiley was at a recent

meeting in New York City, New York, where support for the

WSP was solicited by SCLC personnel; however, Wiley would

not

agree to participate in this SCLC project.

King's contact

with Wiley in Chicago, therefore, will represent an effort to

persuade him of the importance of lending his support to the

WSP.

This source, as well as the first source, advised

King has no known public appearances scheduled while in

Chicago other than a press conference to be held sometime

during the late afternoon or evening of this date.

noon of eveninge

King is

also not known to have any meetings scheduled with the local

SCLC staff; however, it was expected that in all probability

"he would meet individually with some key local personnes

in connection with the WSP.

--

No information was

available to either of the

above sources concerning King's departure plans from Chicago,

although it was anticipated he would depart Chicago during

the late evening hours of february 5, 1968, or early on

February 6, 1968.

Both sources advised that King did not appear in

Chicago as scheduled on February

at the Democratic National Convention, which is to be held

in Chicago in August, 1968, as well as possible demonstrations

on May 12, 1968,

the NWRO.

The latter is described in one of these articles

as a new welfare organization, representing some 6,000 dues-

With respect to the individuals referred to

above it is noted that Stanley Levison was a secret member

of the Communist Party, USA, in July, 1963. In late 1963

being sufficiently militant in the civil rights struggle.

Levison was described by the Communist Party leaders as

being to the "left" of the Communist Party in his position

on civil rights.

His differences with the Communist Party,

however, are merely tactical and he continues his ideological

adherence to communism. Stanley Levison is the owner and

operator of the Park Management Realty Company, 1841 Broaaway,

New York, At that time the name of Leonora Wachtel, wife of

Harry Wachtel, and her address were listed on a list of names

of nevly elected officers of the Bath Beach Club of the Kings

County Conmunist Party.

This meeting was presided over by King who restated

what he had said in the meeting mentioned earlier.

In addi -

tion, he said there were people in the audience who did not agree

with the planned ISP and asked that these people not hinder

the project even though they were not in agreement.

King reminisced about past demonstrations and projects

of the SCIC and their effect.

Doctor King advised they expected approximately

3,000 persons to come to WDC for the WSP. They plan to camp

on the Washington Monument or the Lincoln Memorial grounds.

They fully expect to be asked to move and when this is done

it will draw desired attention to themselves and their cause.

No mention of militancy or civil disobedience was made and

King indicated they would move their camp when asked to do so.

King

indicated there would be similar demonstrations

In other cities during the same period of time as the WSP. He

did not identify these cities.

that on that night Andrew Young (Executive Vice-President

of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference) (SCLO)

and Stanley Levison were to meet with Leon Davis and

Moe Foner at their office, 709 Eighth Avenue, New York

City,

to discuss the washington, D. C. project and

how Foner and Davis can make a contribution.

The same source advised on february 3, 1960,

that on that date, Stanley Levison and William Rutherford,

Executive Director of the SCLC, discussed a list of

contributors (to the SCLC). Levison stated he had

examined this list and that there are no big donors on

It.

Rutherford mentioned that a suggestion had been

made of having a group meeting of the larger contributors

and having someone talk to them and solicit contributions.

Levison suggested Andrew Young as the person to handle

this matter.

Rutherford inquired if Levison would be in

Washington, D. C. on Tuesday (February 6, 1968) and

Levison was uncertain, noting that he was supposed to

meet with "two staff guys" to bring them together with

"a staff guy from 1199" (Local 1199, Drug and Hospital

there would be a meeting of the

on Monday (February 5, 1968) with the march on Tuesday

(February 6, 1968).

The source learned on February 4, 1968, that

Stanley Levison was again in contact with William Rutherford.

Levison brought up the matter of contributors to the

ScLC stating that he had been thinking about having

those who had given $1,000.00 or more, about 60 people,

Invited to someone's house, such as Harry Belafonte's

place.

He said some of the people would be Govenor

and Mrs. Nelson Rockefeller,

Mary and Stephen Rockefeller,

and Franklin D. Roosevelt, III. Levison noted that on

February 5, 1968, he was meeting with some "staff guys"

and was going to put them in contact with the hospital

workers whom he and Andrew Young saw recently. He added

that "they" were assigning a full-time staff

person "to us."

Rutherford noted that Martin Luther King, (head

of the SCLC) was to speak to the Clergymen Concerned

about the Vietnam war on Tuesday morning (February 6,

1908) and that the (SCLC) Board meeting would begin at

2:00 P.M.

1967, a discussion was held concerning a meeting

with Moe. Foner, Secretary of Local 1199 concern-

Ing the formation of a peace committee in Local

WASHINGTON SPRING PROJECT

CONFIDENTIAL

The discussion in this conference began with the

subject of financing

the WSP.

Also discussed were the merits

of having Martin Luther King make a speech during the WSP.

Stokely Carmichael stated that he is in favor of the goals

and aims of the WSP and that he would support this project

wholeheartedly. However, he insisted that his organization,

SNCC, and any other organization which would take part in

project, would keep their own identity separate from

SCLC.

This was agreed to by the representatives of SCLC.

During the above discussion, George Wiley enterec

the room in which the conterence was being held, and after

listening to the conversation, stated that his organization,

the National Welfare of Rights Oganization, could not support

under the conditions

stated.

A considerable time was then spent in an effort to

convince Wiley to support this

project, however, he stated

that before agreeing to give his support, it would be necessary

that he discuss this matter personally with Martin Luther King,

President of SCLC.

A copy of this communication is being provided

to the following local agencies:

United States Attorney, Chicago, Illinois;

United States Secret Service, Chicago, Illinois; and

Levison, in referring

planned by king, for

Spring of 1968, felt that tactics must be agreed upon in the

near future so that persons who have been making inquiry can

be told what tactics will be used.

Rutherford told Levison that Andy Young (Executive

Vice-President of the schC), had written out some of the

tactics to be used.

He said that, for example,during the

first week, calls will be made on Congressman by people from

17 different areas. During the second week, calls will be

made on heads of departments such as the Secretary of Labor.

On the first visit, demands will be made and on the second,

The source advised that he gathered the impression

with organizing for the spring civil disobedience campaign

Levison and Rutherford also discussed financial

contributors to the scLo.

Levison said he had suggested to

King

that they get about 25 contributors together and meet

with them for several days and let them ask King as many

questions as they careto. Levison stated that he would check

the list of contributors and check with Rutherford as to

where they should hold this meeting since it should depend

•on the residence of most of the contributors.

A contidential source, ino has furnished

in April, 1904, that stanley Levison was

a secret member of the Communist Party;

United States of America (CP, USA), in

July, 1963. In late 1903 and ear ys-904,

he criticized the Cp for not being

surprciently murtant in the civil rights

struggle:Levison was described by certain

CP leaders as being to the "left" of the CP

in this position on civil rights. His.

differences with the ce, however, are merely

tactical and he continues his. ideological

UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE

FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION

Birmingham, Alabama

January 26, 1968

RE: WASHINCTON SPRINE PROJECT

On January 26, 1968, Confidential Informant T-1

advised that the weekly

meeting of the Alabama Christian

Movement for Human Rights-'(ACMHR) was held on January 22,

Birmingham.

Albert Turner, Field Secretary, State of

Alabama, for the Southern Christian Leadership Conference

(SCIC) made a speech to the two hundred persons who were

in attendance.

Confidential Informant T-l stated that Albert

Turner made a plea for 300 Alabamians to prepare to go to

Washington to take part in the Washington Spring Project

this April. Turner said that Negroes must join in with

Dr. King because the SCLC is at a very low ebb and in danger

of a takeover by Black Power advocates.

Turner made known

that he came to Birmingham from Detroit where violent forces

claim that last summer's burnings were small compared to what

they plan to do this

Turner said that if these forces

try to destroy Detroit, that the entire Civil Rights movement

will be lost and the leaders killed or put in jail. Turner

told the group that Rev. M. L. Kings Jr's. program

of civil

disobedience does not call

for lying down'in the streets but

merely "sitting in." However, Turner stated that participants

should be ready to be jailed.

Confidential Informant T-l advised in conclusion

that Albert Turner indicated that in the near future, Rev.

M. L. King, Jr., will hold a state-wide meeting in Birmingham

in support of the Washington Spring Project.

CONFIDENTIAT

• WASHINGTON SPRING

PROJECT (WSP)

All sources used in this communication have

furnished reliable information in the past.

recently learned that during the week commencing

1967 the Southern Christian Leadership

South Carolina, which was presided over by Rev. MARTIN

LUTHER KING, JR., President of SCLC and was attended

by approximately 70 individuals comprising the headquarters

and field staff of SCIC.

The primary purpose of the retreat was to discuss

• various facets of SCLO's plan to conduct massive non-

vinlent demonstrations in Washington, D. C. and possibly

& number of other cities auring the early part

; of 1968.

Reverend KING outlined this plan to those attending

the retreat; namely, that it had been tentatively decided

that in the

forepart of February, 1968, he, together with

other officers of sole and in all probability leading

representatives of other Civil Rights organizations not

identified) would personally present to the Secretary of

Labor specific requests for prompt Congressional action

pertaining to employment, income,

housing, education; and

other matters which constitute major problems experienced

by ghetto people. In the event these requests do not

receive an immediate unequivocal commitment insuring

prompt Congressional action, an immediate massive non-

violent demonstration would commence in Washington, D. C.

This demonstration would be conducted by SCLC and involve

aaults Irch all waiks o1 life,

including students and

school children.

If an effort is made by civil and/or

- 4=

military authorities to quell this demonstration, simultaneous

demonstrations of identical magnitude would commence in

10-15 "target cities" thmughout the nation.

NTIAS

RE:

WASHINGTON SPRING PROJECT (WSP)

CV T-l was not aware of the identity of all the

"target cities"

referred to by Rev. KING but he understood

Cleveland was one of the cities included.

CV T-I went on that according to Rev. KING that

during the period prior to early february, 1900, one or

two sChc staif members would be assigned to Washington,

D. C. and each of the "target cities."

It will be the

responsibility of these members to select in each community

up to 200 individuals who will serve as leaders for

demonstrations. This type of individual sought will be

unemployed Negro males, whose general economic status is so

low that they could lose nothing by participating in the

proposed demonstrations.

After selection of these indivicuals

it would then be the responsibility of the SCLO staff member

through mass meetings, workshops or other procedures to

indoctrinate these individuals

with SCLC's overall

objectives and technique

of non-violent demonstration.

Rev.--KING emphasized that the individuals so selected

should be Negroes, however, he said once each demonstration

is actually commenced the assistance of white persons

would definitely be accepted and possibly solicited.

Reverend KING acknowledged this program of

demonstrations was a very substantial undertaking for SCLC

to embark upon. He said it was imperative that SCLo be.

successful in this undertaking because otherwise not only

would it be embarrassed by a failure but failure itself

in a large sense serve as a victory for the

"Black

Power"

groups.

In this connection, he said it would be

necessary to solicit the cooperation of "Black Power"

leaders (not identified in order that such organizations

would permit SCIo to conduct its program without inter-

ference.

He said

he was extremely concerned over the

probability that such interference might easily turn any

demonstration into a riot. He declared that if such

situation developed in any one of the communities in which

SCLE contemplates demonstrating SCLC will imnediately

cease all its activity in that community.

During the retreat an appreciable number of

SCIC staff members expressed doubt that the cooperation

RE:

of the "Black Power" organizations could be obtained and

raised a question as to whether the selection of up to

200 individuals in various communities might not present

a most difficult task. Reverend KING responded by statitig

he was most confident ne could obtain

the desired cooperation

of "Black Power" Leaders.

He said he realized these people

did not agree with his methods or the activities of SCLC

but is confident they have sufficient respect for him to

listen to his requests. He also said he was quite confident

that people, after being apprised of SCLO's objectives,

will be anxious to assist. Furthermore, he expressed optimism

that once the demonstrations commence there will be sufficient

sympathy on the part of the general public that SCLC will

will receive adequate financial support.

CV I-l subsequently learned that Rev. KING had

informed SCLC staff members that this

new activity would

be called Washington Spring Project.

CV I-I also advised on December 19, 1967 that

he recently learned that various assignments

had been

made of SOLC members to various cities

in the United

States in connection with the forthcoming WSP and the twe

being assigned to the Cleveland area were EDDIE OSBURN and

MIKE BIBLER®

MICHAEL

- CV To2 mentioned in January, 1968 that he learned

that the SCLC held a conference from January 15-17, 1968 at

Atlanta, Georgia,

for the purpose of discussing and planning

strategy regarding SCLC's WSP which it contemplated

initiating in early April, 1968. In attendance were

1. .

approximately 35 individuals, who were SCLC staff members.

At one of the sessions it was mentioned that in

all

probability Congress would not accept or act on

the

demands presented by SCLO.

If this happens, it was then

planned to begin protesting this refusal by means of

disrupting virious agencies and facilities throughout

washington, D. C. for example one group was tentatively

scheduled to tie up the Washington Greyhound Bus Station

utilizing such tactics as lying down in front of buses

blocking entrances end exits, etc. It was

expected that

numerous arrests would be made of

the participants of this

troycet ano it wes cointed out that the participants must

be

"totally committed" to the project end be willing to

risk arrest.

It is even possible that some persons may

be killed and the participants must be prepared to spend

up to six months

in jail; however, it was not desired that

any mobilization coordinators be jailed for any lengthy

on January 17, 1960, CV T-1 also furnished

information regarding the SCLC conference held at Atlanta,

Georgia from January 15-17, 1968; source added that during

the conference, Rev. KING said there was no doubt that

the requests that would be presented to the various

government agencies would receive a non-committal type

response. Then 200 demonstratorspreviously recruited by

SCIC in approximately 15 communities will then commence

a massive non-violent demonstration in Washington, D. C.

In conjunction with the activity of the

approximately 3000 demonstretors in Washington, D. C.,

SCIC contemplates that in each community from which these

demonstrators come there will be sympathetic simultaneous

demonstrations.

These demonstrations will be participated

in by individuals who do not go to Washington, D. C. but

experience the same problems and seek the same solutions

as the demonstrators

SCLC intends that the

demonstrators will not be intimidated in their efforts

by injunctions or other legal measures designed to serve

as deterrents.

The demonstrators will submit to arrest and

incarceration without bail, however,

the place of

an incar-"

cerated demonstretor will be assumed by another demonstrator.

Rev. KING felt the WSP would produce affirmative action

promptly on the part of Congress regarding jobs or income

for Negroes.

CV I-1 advised on January 18, 1960 that he

learned Rev. KING planned to visit the

various target cities

in connection with the WSP during February and March, 1968

and his schedule indicated he would be in Cleveland on

February 24, 1968:

• CV T-l advised on January 24, 1968 that from

what he has learned the Cleveland staff

• of Rev. 'MARTIN

LUTER KING had been redured to two men; namely, Rev. E

RANDEL OSEURN and MICHAEL BIBLER. Rev: OSBURN has an

WASFINGTON SPRING PROJECT (WSP)

which apartment Is also the headquarters of the SCLC

in Cleveland at present. The other members of Rev. KING'S

staff who had been working in the Cleveland area have been

moved to other cities throughout the country.

CV T-I had also learned that Rev. OSBURN had

been out of town for some time as he had been attending

an SCLC conference in Atlanta along with 150 other people

but that OSBURN returned to Clevelana on January 18, 1968.

OSBURN mentioned on his return that he kould have to get the

"ball rolling" in Clveland on the WSP indicating that

nothing her been done as of January 18, 1968 to organize

this project.

CV I. 3 reported on January 25, 1968 that he

learned that following Rev. OSBURN's attendance at the

SCLO conference in Atlanta on January 15-17, 1960, he

returned to Cleveland but then made another visit

Atlants for additional instructions regarding Cleveland's

role in the wsP.

On returning again to Cleveland, Rev.

OSBURN indicated that his organization now planned to

recruit, approximately 200 distressed people in the ghetto

area of civeland to participate in the SP in wasnington,

D. C.

these people who will be unemployed and have nothing

to lose would not have the funds to make this trip or to

stay in Washington, D. C. but scLc will make money available

to them. Rev. OSBURN went on that he planned to open a

storefront orfice at E. 79th and Hough area, Cleveland,

Ohio, on Jaruary 26, 1968, which is in the heart of the

most

depressed area

of Cleveland and the center of the

Hough area riots.

In addition Rev. OSBURN plans to issue

a brochure in the near future setting forth the aims, etc.

of the WSP.

WASHINGTON SPRING PROJECT

RACIAL, MATTER

Leadership Conference (SCLC) on that date concluded

a retreat which was held January 15, 1968 -

January 17, 1968, at the Ebenezer Baptist Church,

Atlanta, Georgia,

of which Church Reverend Martin

Luther King, Jr., President, SCLC, serves as co-pastor.

This retreat was concerned with SCLC's Washington

Spring Project (HSP) which it contemplates initiating

early in April 1968.

In attendance were approximately

50 individuals, about one-half of whom were SCLC field

representatives fron various locations.

Reverend King pointed out he did not have

any desire that SCLC should have any friction with

"Black Pover groups during the course of its WSP.

He said the basic issue of the WSP was jobs or income

and the validity of this issue could not be argued by

"Black Power groups" or anyone else.

He said SCIC

uruld simply go about its business of implementing

the WSP.

Reverend King declared that in the event

SCIC is not successful awakening the conscience of the

nation to the urgent need for jobs or income through

the WSP the nation will subsequently lave to admit that

SCIC made a substantial effort in this regard. In the

event of such failure, Reverend King said there could

be no question that the "Black Power groups" would benefit

appreciably.

WASHINGTON SPRING PROJECT

RACIAL MATTER

On January 17, 1968, a confidential source

advised he had learned

that the Southern Christian

Leadership Conference (SCLC) on that date culminated

a three-day retreat held in Atlanta, Georgia.

This

retreat was held in facilities of the Ebenezer

Baptist Church of which Reverend Martin Luther King,

¡ President, SCIC, serves as co-pastor and also

attended by approximately 50 individuals. Approximately

one half of the individuals in attendance were SCLC

field representatives fron various locations.

representative (identity not known) of the American

Friends Service Connittee attended this retreat.

Reverend King served as the presiding officer

at the retreat, the essential purpose of which was twofold.

First, to afford SCLC staff members opportunity to fully

understand the objective of the SCLC Washington Spring

Project, discuss anticipated problems and seek solutions

therefo. Secondly, to permit Reverend King to infuse

SCLC staff members with enthusiasm to participate in the

project in order that it will be a success.

An appreciable amount of time atthe retreat was

devoted to group discussions by the SCLC field representatives

who will recruit demonstrators to participate

in the Washington Spring Project. James Bevel,

former Director of Direct Action, SCLC, and

Hosea Williams, Director of Voter Registration

and Political Educatinn, SCLC, actively participated

in these discussions.

Both Bevel and Williams have

had considerable experience in the area of Civil

Rights demonstrations.

Reverend King lectured several times

during this retreat concerning the overall purpose

of SCIC's Washington Spring Project.

He pointed

out this project would be predicated on the issue

of jobs or income for Ghetto Negroes and impoverished

people of all races in the United States.

However,

he emphasized this would not solve all the problems

experienced by the Negro, particularly those

regarding Inequality and therefore the Civil Rights

Movement as a whole will have many things to achieve

as years go by.

Acquiring jobs or income for Negroes alone,

Dr. King declared, will be à noteworthy achievement

on the part of the Washington Spring Project, however:

he stressed that the jobs or the income obtained would

represent a mere fraction of that which America owes

the Negro throughout history. He said America owes an

incalcuable sum to the Negro

who throughout his long

years of involuntary servitude labored to build this

country.

Dr. King stated that the many problems of the

Negro and other poor people will not be solved under

a Capitalistic system.

Capitalism, he said, has no remedy

for the poor.

The ultimate aim of all aggrieved people

in the United States can only be to accomplish a change

in the existing Capitalistic economy and Government.

• Reverend King did not discuss

in any detail how or when the change he referred to

might be accomplished.

On January 17, 1968, during his closing

comments at this retreat Reverend King emphasized

to the SCLC staff that the forthcoming Washington

Spring Project will be one of the most difficult

tasks which it to date has undertaken and

accordingly challenged the staff to maintain itself

both willing and able in order that the project will

be successful.

Reverend King referred to how Jesus found

it necessary to send His disciples on various missions.

He told the members of the SCLo staif that they were

"his disciples".

for

the purpose of setting in motion forces for the establishment of

National Organizational Secretary, stated the Party believes the

Des should have a working-class outlook and be a mass organization

favorabie to socialism, socialist countries and Marxism, and in

April, 1967, advised that GUS HAlu, CPUSA General Secretary,

will attempt to recruit 3,000 Negro people from the ghetto

areas in 15 "target cities' throughout the United States

. to go to Washington, D. C., this spring and demonstrate.

The recruiters are currently en route to their assigned

cities or will arrive there in the next four or five days.

The

conference did not resolve when those indi

viduals recruited to demonstrate would arrive in Washington, D.C.

King still plans on presenting his initial demands to the

Department of Labor. He also expects to make demands, not

resolved, on other Government departments.

-

King feels that his demands will not be met by

any Government agency and his massive civil disobedience

will then commence. The demonstrators will be instructed

not to abide by injunctions or other legal

deterrents. They

will sleep in Government office buildings and submit to arrest

and jail. Other demonstrators will take the place of those

jailed.

King envisions that these demonstrations will

tie up all business in Washington, D. C., in a matter of

a few days. King hopes the news of these demonstrations

traveling throughout the Nation will touch off simultaneous

demonstrations in the other "target cities." Initially

the demonstrators will press for jobs and income; however,

King feels the peace issue will naturally become involved

and much support will be afforded the demonstrators in

Washington, D. C., by various peace groups. Because of

the demonstrations, King feels Congress will be forced to

pass legislation favorable to Negroes.

King plans to visit each "target city" and talk

to demonstrators recruited about the project and boost

morale. In that regard, King plans to visit Washington, D. C.,

on February 8, 1968. He also informed the conference he.

woüld be in Washington; D: C., for. the actual demonstrations.

The type of civil disobedience that the demon-

strators would use was not discussed during this conference.

Even though King indicated that these demonstrations would

commence the last week in March, the source advised that

King has speaking engagements in several cities in Virginia

at that time. The source feels that the mass demonstrations

will not start until the first week in April.

WASHINGION SPRING PROJECT

On January 16, 1968, Lleutenant GEORGE FENCI, Philadelphia

Police Department, Civil Disobedience Unit, advised that on

January 11, 1968,

JAMES ORANGE, Who was associated in some way with

Dr. MARTIN LUTHER KING and the

Southern Christian Leadership

conterence (scut), was identilled in Phladelphia and survelled

throughout the day.

It was determined by the surveillance

ORANGE was staying at 0540 Lincoln Drive, Philadelphia, which was the

residence of DI. ROBERT ANDERSON, nofurther identified by the

Philadelphia Police Department at this time.

During the evening hours, ORANGE went to the Universal

Church of Restoration at Gorgas Lane and Stenton Avenue in Philadelphia.

ORANGE and another individual went into the rear of the church.

11st of license plates of other individuals', automobiles who entered

the church that evening was obtained by the Philadelphia Police Depart

ment.

The registered owners of these automobiles are being checked

by the Philadelohia Police Department.

About 11:30 pol., ORANGE left the church with an unidentified

Negro male in 3 1959 or 1960 Chevrolet, Tennessee license J78626.

This

license was subsequently determined to

be that registered to JAMES F.

WOODRUFF, 3211 Bataria, Avenue, Nashville, Tenn. The Reverend JAMES E.

WOODRUFF is presently employed by the Episcopal Diocese of Pennsylvania

in the Race Relations Section of the diocese.

The Reverend WOODRUFY

is also the individual who was involved in the summer of 1966 with

- the Liberation School in Nashville, Tenn., In which the Chief of Police

of Nashville, Tenn, alleged that the Liberation School, which was

funded in part by the Federal Office of Economic Opportunity, was

teaching "hate whitey" classes,

ORANGE was observed driving a 1955 Pontiac sedan, Illinois

When ORANGE returned to the residence at 6514 Linculn

Drive around midnight, January 12, 1968, the surveillance was

dropped.

however as of mid afternoon

Saturday ORANGE could no longer be located.

On January 17, 1960, confidertial informant PH 1al:

who has furnished reliable information in the past,

advised that

he had received unverified information that an individual

identified only as ORANGE had been at a mecting sometime around

the middle or latter part of December at the St. Thomas Episcopal

Church, 52nd and Pine Streets in Philadelphia during the evening,

meeting with civil rights leaders in Philadelphia.

It waS PA t-l's

understanding that ORANGE represented DI. MARTIN LUTHER KING and

the ScId in regard to KING's coming project scheduled for the

spring of 1968 in Washington, D.U. and other cities. Ine gist

of the meeting was to the effect

that 1i Philadelphia civil rights

leaders were to support Dr. KING's presence of SOLO in Philadelphia

sometime in early 1968, that any money collected through SCIo

¡efforts in Philadelphia would be used in Philadelphia rather than

being taken out of the city for the National Headquarters of SCLC

as had been done on a number of former appearances of Dr. KING in

Philadelphia.

WASHINGTON SPRING PROJECT

RACIAL MATTERS

MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR., president, Southern Christian

Leadership Conference (SCLC), has publicly announced he will

conduct a massive civil disobedience campaign: in the Nation's

Capitol the first week of April, 1968, in ay effort to pressure

Congress into passing legislation favorablé to the Negro.

On March 5, 1968, GOLDEN ASRO PRINKS, Field Secretary,

SCLC, was interviewed by Agent of the FBI at his residence

122 West Peterson Street, Edenton, North Carolina. FRINKS

said

that he is pleased with the progress that Congress is making

with

the proposed civil rights legislation, but he said that

even if legislation is passed, this will not change SCL's

plans for a march on Washington, D. C. FRINKS pointed out that

DI. MARTIN LUTHER KING has not spelled out his demands as yet

and that they will include much more than just a housing law.

He suggested that one of the demands might be that all persons

are assured a ninimun income which rould be paid by the Federal

government. His concept of this pian would be that the number

of days per year an individual is employed by private industry

would be subtracted from the total in the year and then the

government would pay the balance.

He said

that it would be the

government's responsibility to provide the work they wish these

individuals to do, even if it be only menial labor. He said that

it would also be the government's responsibility to enforce this

plan to insure that the persons are actually doing the work.

With regard to the march, he said that he has 21 paid

employees working for him throughout the State of North Carolina.

He said that these individuals are not being paid a salary but

subsistence only. He said that these people were unemployed

and that they had nothing else

to do, therefore they were willing

to work on that basis.

FRINKS advised he would provide the

numes of the 21 paid employees in about one week. He said he

did not have their names at the time of interview.

RE: WASHINGTON SPRING PROJECT

FRINKS said that these 21 persons are recruiting others

to go to Washington, D. C., for the march and act as squad

leaders, guides, etc.

for

the masses who will follow. He said

that his paid employees have a goal of 200 such persons and •

After the recruitment

FRINKS said that he and his group of about 200 will

leave North Carolina on April 15 or 16, with a planned arrival

in Washington, D. C., on April 22, 1968.

Concerning transportation,

he said that

the

means of

transportation has not yet been worked

out.

He said he has

given consideration to buying old busses

or cars, but the busses especially do not seem to be available.

FRINKS said there has been

a suggestion to drive to a distance

of 100 miles south of Washington and then walk the rest of the

way .

There has also been

the suggestion to walk the entire way.

FRINKS said he personally prefers to go by bus or car if possible,

stopping in the small towns en

route.

He hopes to set up

tents

He mentioned the town of Suffolk,

Virginia, as a possible first night stop. He commented that he

also hopes to set up tents in Washington, but he feels that they

will be prohibited from doing this..

Upon arrival at Washington, D. C., FRINKS believes that

Dr. KING will be there to meet them.

Shortly after their

arrival, he believes that KING will make his demands and then

call all

Negroes to Washington who have grievances.

The hard

core group of squad leaders and guides will be stationed at

the entrances to the city and at the Federal buildings and

direct each incoming group to the office building that should

best be able to handle their particular grievance.

FRINKS

estimated that the demonstrations in Washington will last about

three weeks.

FRINKS advised that he and Dr. KING are very much

concerned about STOKLEY CARMICHAEL and the Student Nonviolent

Coordinating Committee (SNCC) trying to interfere or take over

once the Negroes are in Washington.

that KING plans additional talks with CARMICHAEL. FRINKS said

if he does come, "we will bust his head."

(NAACP), Clarksdale, Mississippi, advised that Martin Luther

King, JI., is scheduled to arrive in Clarksdale, Mississippi,

ington Spring Project (WSP). This rally is to take place

between 2:00 PM and 5:00 PM, after which time the NAACP will

decide whether or not to support the WSP.

On March 7, 1968, Leon Wilbert Hall, 823 Cherry

Street, Grenada, Mississippi, advised that he

is the Southern

Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) field secretary for..

the state of Mississippi and

as such is in complete charge

of SCLC activities in Mississippi, and that he is coordinating

Martin Luther King, Jr., president, SCLC, will

come to Mississippi on or about March 20, 1968, for the

purpose of touring the state in an effort to gain addi-

tional support for the WSP.

King will then return to Mississippi on or about

April 14. 1968, to take part in workshops and training

programs at Grenada, Mississippi, and Jackson, Mississippi,

which will have already been in operation for a short period

of time. This program is in connection with the prepara-

tion of

persons planning to participate in the WSP.

King

will spend the morning of his arrival at Grenada and the

delegations

from the southern part of Mississippi, and

will travel to Washington, D. C., with this group.

The Mississippi group, which presently has 114

persons signed up, will consist of between 200 and 400

persons at the date of departure.

They will gather at two

focal points, Grenada and Jackson, with the northern dele-

gates meeting in Grenada and the southern delegates in

Jackson.'

The recruiting for this group is being handled

by SCLC employees, namely, Leon Wilbert Hall; R. B. Cotton-

reader, Quitman County SCLC project director, Marks, Missis-

sippi; Major Wright, Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party.

(MEDP) worker,

Lexington, Mississippi, who have endorsed

the entire SCLC program.

The delegates are to come from

thirty different counties in Mississippi.

The group leaving on April 15, 1968, will be the

first such group in the nation to start for Washington, D. C.

They will travel by buses furnished free of charge by

unnamed northern church organizations. They will travel

to Washington, D. C., after joining with units from Ten-

R. B. Cottonreader and Major

Wright will accompany this group to Washington, D. C.

This unit will be followed by a second delegation

at a later date which Hall will accompany, together with

hits secretary, Felicie Porche, a volunteer worker from los

Angeles, California.

Housing has been arranged at the present time

for 2500 persons, of which the large part is located in

the Baltimore, Maryland, area. The delegates plan to com-

mute daily from this area to Washington, D. C., to take

pact: in the activities.

The first group is scheduled to arrive in Wash-

ington, D. C., on April 22, 1968, to commence with the

scheduled activities. It is tentatively planned for King

to spend more time in the state of Mississippi in order

to gain support for his WSP. It is felt that in the past

he has

neglected Mississippi in his contacting the people.

is the Southern

Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) field secretary for -

the state of Mississippi and

WASHINGTON SPRING PROJECT

Martin Luther King, Jr., president, SCLe, will

come to Mississippi on or about March 20, 1968, for the

purpose of touring the state in an effort to gain addi-

tional support for the WSP.

King will then return to Mississippi on or about

April 14, 1968, to take part in workshops and training

programs

at Grenada, Mississippi, and Jackson, Mississippi,

which will have already been in operation for a short period

of time.

This program is in connection with the prepara-

tion of persons planning to participate in the WSP.

King

will spend the morning of his arrival at Grenada and the

evening at Jackson. He will depart from Jackson via bus

on April 15, 1968, the projected date of departure for the

delegations

from

the southern part of Mississippi, and

will travel to Washington, D. C., with this group.

The Mississippi group, which presently has 114

persons signed up, will consist of between 200 and 400

persons at the date of departure. They will gather at two

focal points, Grenada and Jackson, with the northern dele-

gates

meeting in Grenada and the southern delegates in

Jackson.

The recruiting for this group is being handled

by SCLC employees, namely, Leon Wilbert Hall; R. Ba"Cotton-.

reader, Quitman County SCLC project director, Marks, Missis-

sippi; Majoz Wright, Mississippi. Freedom Democratic Party

(MFDP) worker, Lexington, Mississippi, who have endorsed

the entire SCLe progran.

The delegates are to come from

thirty different counties in Mississippi.:

The group leaving on April 15, 1968, will be the •

first such group in the nation to start

for Washington, D. C.

They will travel by buses furnished free of charge by

unnamed northern church organizations. They will travel

to Washington, D. C., after joining with units from Ten-

nessee and Alabama en route.

R. B. Cottonreader and Major

Wright will accompany this group. to Washington, De Comm

This unit will be followed by a second delegation

at a later date which Hall will accompany, together with

his

secretary, Felicie forche, a volunteer worker from Los

Angeles, California.

Housing has been arranged at the present time

for 2500 persons, of which the large part is located in

the Baltimore, Maryland, area.

The delegates plan to com-

mute daily from this area to Washington, D. C., to take

part in the activities.

The first group is scheduled to arrive in Wash-

ington, D. C., on April 22, 1968, to commence with the

scheduled activities. It is tentatively planned for King

to spend more time in the state of Mississippi in order

to gain support for

his WSP. It is felt that in the past

he has neglected Mississippi in his contacting the people.

Dear Mr. Hoover--

WashingTon Spring ProjecT

I join with perhaps millions of my fellow Americans,

to plead with you and your Dept. to direct your attention to the

activities of this'character," Martin Luther King. Who is planning

now to soon lead a mass march on the National Capitol--to further

demonstrate his communstic aims--and to sabotage, at least in

part, of the principals. My three sons have gone to war to preserve.

We are hopeful invasion will be dealt with in the manner

as the Bonas March some years ago -When our truly dedicated Veterans

of combat--Were driven from the Nations Capitol, with bayonets, torches,

and mounted troops--

There will also be millions across the Nation awaiting

to see how this agitator will be dealt with.

Surely, the "shanties" and "communism" will not be

permitted to blossom beneath those cherry trees, and in the shadows

of the Justice Dept. Bldg. An aroused country must be vitally conserned.

The Hon. J. Edgar Hoover

Director, F.B.I.

Washington D. C.

Dear Mr. Hoover--

мити

I join with perhaps millions of my fellow Americans,

to plead with you and your Dept. to direct your attention to the

activities of this'character," Martin Luther King. Who is planning

now to soon lead a mass march on the National Capitol--to further

demonstrate his communstic aims--and to sabotage, at least in

part, of the principals. My three sons have gone to war to preserve.

We are hopeful invasion will be dealt with in the manner

as the Bonas March some years ago-When our truly dedicated Veterans

of combat--Were driven from the Nations Capitol, with bayonets, torches,

and mounted troops--

There will also be millions across the Nation awaiting

to see how this agitator will be dealt with.

Surely, the "shanties" and "communism" will not be

permitted to blossom beneath those cherry trees, and in the shadows

of the Justice Dept. Bldg. An aroused country must be vitally conserned.

Dear Sir:

It continues to be a mystery why our government allows a black

power leader the freedom to plan revolution.

If the White House and Justice Department "fear" the results of

Martin Luther 'King's April march on Washington and Carmichael's

Involvement in it why can't steps be taken to prevent this event?

It appears that we must fight communism in Vietnam, but not in

Washington D.C. Something is wrong!

campaign exactly coincides with the

•the most dangerous phase - of

Stokely Carmichael's swift ascent to

"the top. He has returned from

travels in the Communist world no

longer preaching revolution in the

streets but quietly implementing V.

I-Lenin's tactics of coalescing with

"non-revolutionary social reformers

"such as King.

• What makes King

particularly

susceptible to Carmichael's embrace

*is his present desperate condition

country's most prestigious Negro

he has been declining since

the failure of his Chicago campaign

of 1966. The April march of the poor

is widely regarded in Negro circles

as King's last opportunity. Chuck

Stone, a shrewd black power strate-

gist and an ally of Carreichaely.has

called it "Custer's last stand,"

ment officials well know, King has a

"history of surrendering control to

the better organized extremist ele-

ments in a critical situation. This

was precisely what happened during

the Selma, Ala., march in 1965 when

the Student Non-Violent Coordinat-

ing Committee (SNICK) forced King

to the wall and seized control.

Nor are Administration officials

• alone in their apprehension. King's

more moderate lieutenants- such as

the Rev.

chairman of the new Washington

City Council-have from the begin-

ning feared that control of the April

march would go to the extremists.

The decision by Carmichael's new

Black United Front to endorse the

"aims" of the King campaign has on-

ly fanned the fears. For Carmichael,

it avoids all responsibility for a pos-

sible fiasco but positions him per-

fectly to take command if the oppor-

tunity arises.

Indeed,

mere formation of the

Black United Front follows the Len-

inist line now followed by Carmi-

chael. Whether or not Carmichael

himself actually read Lenin during

his long travels in the Red world

last year, he returned to this coun-

try a changed man. Once contemp-

tuous of non-radical Negroes, he im-

mediately proposed formation of the

Black United Front—a front of both

revolutionary and non-revolution-

ary elements along classic Leninist

Moderate Negro leaders here have

been uncertain about their reaction

Carmichael's

Moultrie of the NAACP and Sterling

Tucker of the Urban League attend-

ed the first meetings of the front

more to keep an eye on Carmichael

than anything else. In a private con-

versation,

Tucker told Carmichael

he realized each was trying to hood-

wink the other.

NW 68262 Docld:32989577 Page 677

"But the moderates came under

heavy pressure not to consort with

Carmichael. Moultrie was particu-

larly chastised by national NAACP

headquarters. When the Black Unit-

ed Front met again last Wednesday:

Feb. 14, neither Moultrie nor Tuck-

er was present.

Present or not, they fully aypre-

"ciate Carmichael's tactics. He is ef-

plicitly following Lenin's famed 1920

injunction to the British Communist

Party not to attack the Labor Party

but to "support" the democratic So-

cialists "in the same way as the rope

supports a hanged man."

It is in precisely this way that

" Fear is growing among top offici-

als in the White House and Justice

Department that Dr. Martin Luther

King's April march of the poor on

Washington will result in a sturi-

ning victory for Stokely Carmichacl.

With only six weeks to go, little of

the detailed and massive pianning

necessary for King's April campaign

has been done. Thus, in the opinion

.of Administration strategists, there

is a golden opportunity for Carmi-

chael to step in and gain primacy

among regro leaders. Indeed, King

in desperation may even invite hini

•to take a leading role in

the

planning, with obvious implications

for the future.

Moreover,

King's

ill-considered

PITANT'S

"Fackage deal, baby, steal my thun-

-der — you take my lightning".

Darcy in Philadelphia Bulletin

campaign exactly coincides with the

new Leninist phase-in many ways

ithe most dangerous phase

Stokely Carmichael's sivilt ascent to

the top. #le

travels in the Communist world no

longer preaching revolution in the

streets but quietly implementing V.

1. Lenin's tactics of coalescing with

•non-revolutionary social reformers

-such as King.

• That

makes King particularly

susceptible to Carmichael's embrace

is his present desperate condition

within

the morement.

Once the

country's most prestigious Negro

leader, he has been declining since

the failure of his Chicago Campaign

of 19G6. The April march of the poor

is sidely regarded in Nearo circles

as King's last opportunity. Chuck

Stone, a shrewd black power strate-

gist and an ally of Carmichael, has

called it "Custer's last stand."

ROBERT NOVAK

But King,

never

much of

administrator; has hardly begun an

attack the mass of detail needed to

bring thousands of poor Negroes. to

Washington and house, feed,

dead them. King badly misses Bay-

ard Rustin, chier planner for the

1963 march on Washington, who is

nay estranged from King. -

Furthermore, as Justice Depart-

ment officials well knos., King has a

"history of surrendering control to

the better organized extremist ele-

ments in a critical situation. This

was precisely what happened during

the Selma, Ala., march in 1965 when

the Student Non-Violent Coordinat-

• ing Connittee (SNICK) forced King

to the wall and seized control.

Nor are Administration officials

aione in their apprehension. King's

more moderate lieutenants-such as

the Nev. Walter. Fauntroy, vice

chairman of the new Washington

City Council-have from the begin-

ning feared that control of the April

march would go to the extremists.

The decision by Carmichael's new

Black United Front to endorse the

"aims" of the King campaign has on-

ly fanned the fears. For Carmichael,

it avoids all responsibility for a pos-

sible fiasco but positions him per-

fectly to take command if the oppor-

tunity arises.

Indeed, mere formation of the

Black United Front follows the Len-

inist line now followed by Carmi-

chael. Whether or not Carmichael

himself actually read Lenin during

his long travels in the Red world

last year, he reured to this coun-

try a changed man. Once contemp-

tuous of non-radical Negroes, he im-

mediately proposed formation of the

Black United Front-a front of both

revolutionary and non-revolution-

ary elements along classic Leninist

Moderate Negro leaders here have

been uncertain about their reaction

Carmichael's overtures.

Moultrie of the NAACP and Sterling

Tucker of the Urhan League attend-

ed the first meetings of the front

more to keep an eye on Carmichael

than anything else. In a private con-

Carmichael

he realized each was trying to hood-

wink the other.

But the moderates came under

heavy pressure not to consort with

Carmichael. Moultrie was particu-

larly chastised by national NAACP

headquarters. When the Black Unit-•

ed Front met again last Wednesday.

Feb. 14, neither Moultrie nor Tuch-

er was present.

Present or not, they fully appre-

'ciate Carmichael's tactics. He is ex-

plicitly following Lenin's famed 1920

injunction to the Britisn Communist

Party not to aitack the Labor Party

but to "support" the democratic So

cialists "in the same way as the rope

supports a hanged man."

It is in precisely this way that

• Stokely Carmichael may be able to

"support" King six weeks hence.

The most charismauc and one or the

Negro leaders,

Carmichael

(may achieve a dangerous eminence

now that he has laid aside puerile

rabble-rousing and adopted the poir

tical techniques of the greatest rev

olutionary, of the century.

I appeal to you on this as I have

had great admiration for you- and everyone is

concerned about the riot that Martin Luther

With respect to the matter you mentioned, the

RACIAL MATTERS

On January 22, 1968, GOLDEN ASRO TRINKS, Field

Secretary, Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC),

was interviewed at his residence at Edenton, North Carolina,

by representatives of the FBI.

FRINKS related that he is

ranked seventh or eighth in the SCLC chain of command, and

he recently attended conferences in Atlanta, Georgia,

concerning forthcoming activities of scIC.

He said at the

present time, he is on loan fron SCuC to the North Cacolina

gubernatorial candidate, Doctor REGINALD A.VHAWKINS, frOm

Charlotte, North Carolina.

He said in this regard,

he.

will

travel in North Carolina, to the towns of Pantego,

Wilmington,

Fayetteville and Durhan attempting to form

a coalition between the Negroes and the poor whites.

FRINKS was

not optimistic that HAWKINS would be elected

but he stated if he were elected, it would be a great:

stride forward for civil rights and. tend to retard outbursts

of violence and riots.

FRINKS stated while in Atlanta recently, he

met with Doctor MARTIN LUTHER KING and™

other civil rights

workers from SCIC, Student Non-Violent Coorainating

Committee (SNCC) and the National Association for the

Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). He said the purpose

of this conference was to plan demonstrations

and a strategy

for Washington, D. C., this spring or summer.

SCLC hopes to have immediate pissage of certain civil

rights legislation, but if this is unsuccessful, Doctor

KING will call for

this demonstration, He said another

purpose of the conference was to try to eliminate the

communist element from infiltrating their plans for a

peaceiul, non-violent demonstration in lashington, D. C.,

as well as to eliminate those civil rights groups

that

advocate violence and riots. In conversation regarding

might meet with resistance from the local Government,

FRINKS made no mention of other

target cities."

He

said

If they are resisted in Washington, D. C,, there will

be sit-ins and other forms of civil disobedience short of

violence.

As to his role in this master plan, FRINKS

said it is his responsibility to train 200 persons

throughout this state to go to Washington, D. C., with

him and demonstrate at preselected locations. As an

example, he used the Department of Interior as the

object of such a sit-in or demonstration by his group.

He said this group of 200 from North Carolina, would not

be from any ore

area of the state, but from every locality.

+ this

He said he would not want this group to meet unless he

called a meeting. FRINKS felt that if they all came

from one area of North Carolina, chances would be enhanced

that once trained, they might choose a violent course

of action rather than the non-violent course he intends

to pursue. Regarding violence, FRINKS admitted that

once the SCLC-sponsored demonstrations in Washington:

D. C., commenced, little could be done by SCLC to prevent

other groups from arriving in Washington, D. C., who

may be responsible for violence or riots. FRINKS stated

he had

just returned from Durham,, North Carolina, where

he had been working on the Washington,

D. C., project.

He stated he plans to return there about January 27 or 28,

1968, presumably both for responsibilities he has to

• SCLC and REGINALD HAWKINS.

FRINKS stated BEN WACK is a SCLC worker in

the area of voter registration in a small community near

Charleston,

South Carolina. No mention was made by

FRINKS that MACK had any responsibility in the Washington,

by confidential sources of this Bureau who have furnished

reliable information in the past.

Martin Luther King, Jr., President, Southern

Christian Leadership Conference, racently held a meeting

in Atlanta, Georgia, to discuss plans for the massive

civil disobedience campaign he calls the "Washington

Spring Project." It is King's current plan to recruit

3,000 individuals primarily from the East, Midwest, and

South, to come to Washington, D. Ca, in early April, 1968,

to lobby and demonstrate in an effort to pressure Congress

into passing legislation favorable to the Negro. A

proposal was made and

adopted at this meeting to enlist

the support, if not the actual participation, of black

nationalist

groups in the "Washington Spring Project."

King agreed to designate individuals in the future to

make the necessary contacts with the black nationalist

groups in this regard.

Four individuals have been assigned by King to

work in the States of Alabama and Mississippi to recruit

about 200 indigent Negro farmers in each state.

These

farmers will be selected from among Negroes who have been

deprived of their land. They will join with other Negro

farmers of similar circumstances, recruited from Georgia,

and upon arrival in Washington, D. C., will lobby before

the United States Department of Agriculture. It will

be their aim to get new legislation passed that will

improve their current economic state.

Other individuals have been dispatched by

King to 15 "target"' cities throughout the United States

to recruit large numbers of unemployed and unemployable.

These individuals, upon arriving in Washington, D. C.,

will lobby before the United States Department of Labor.

They will seek some kind of a program that will help

them find jobs.

The current plans are to demonstrate and tie

up all business in Washington, D. C., if the Departments

of Agriculture and Labor fail to meet King's demands.

One contingent of King's group has been

tentatively assigned to tie up the Greyhound Bus Station

in Washington, D. C., utilizing such tactics as lying

down in front of buses and blocking entrances and exits.

King instructed the leaders to recruit

participants that will be totally committed to the

success of this "Washington Spring Project." They must

be willing to risk being arrested. They must be willing

to spend up to six months in jail. They also must be

willing to face death as it was pointed out that some

persons might be killed during these demonstrations.

the Spring and Summer of 1968, to get action to aid Negroes

in the United States; KING gave no details of this project.

According to Chief ELWOOD, there were no problems,

incidents, etc. in connection with Rev. KING's visit to

.. Ada, Ohio, and KING departed that city during the early

afternoon of 1/11/68, for Cleveland, Ohio, and New York City.

Cleveland sources could not furnish any information

that Rev. KING spent any time in the Cleveland area on either

1/10 or 11/68, nor have they seen any indication that there

has been any planning or activity in Cleveland on Rev. KING's

Hashington Spring Project.

Donald F. O'Donnell, Chief Counsel of the Senate

Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations (chaired by Senator John L.

McClellan) which currently is conducting the hearings concerning riots

and civil disorders, has requested information concerning the demon-

stration being planned by Martin Luther King, Jr., in Washington this

spring. King has publicly stated that he intends to conduct massive

civil disobedience in Washington this year unless specific demands

for congressional action to solve the problems of poor Negroes are met.

Enclosed is a brief summary of pertinent information

concerning King's plans for this event. The information contained

In addition to furnishing the enclosed write-up to

Washington, D. C., in the Spring of 1066.

ized by SCLC with participants recruited from the ghettos all across

the country and from rural areas in the South. I the march did not

produce the desired congressional comitment, massive civil

disobedience would be undertaken in Washingion and other major cities.

In the late Fall of 1967, SOLC held a retreat at

Frogmore, South Carolina, where specitic plans were made dotterning

the group will be given no definite assurance of any positive action

and the program of massive civil disobedience then will begin.

Various reports indicate these activities may include attempts to

block the entrances to major government buildings and to disrupt trans-

portation facilities in and around the Nation's capital. Simultaneous

disturbances may be undertaken in various other cities around the

country.

King has announced that he is sending recruiters to

a number of cities and areas in the country to organize leadership

FOR RELEASE WHEN DELIVERED ON FLOOR OF THE SENATE

REMARKS OF SENATOR JOHN L. MCCLELLAN

RELATING TO THE MARCH ON WASHINGTON

rebases: 4174304563028

willial

Mr. President, the so-called "Poor People's March on Washington"

Is a matter of deep concern to every law abiding citizen of our country.

The stated intentions of the leaders of the march are to

assemble in this city many thousands of demonstrators--no one seems to

know how many there will be--in an atmosphere and under conditions which

are calculated to lead to civil disorders and violence. I quote one of

their leaders, the Reverend A. D. King, brother of the late Martin Iuther

King, speaking on April 21, 1968: "We are going to Washington and

disrupt Washington so it cannot function unless it does something about

black people." On May 2, Reverend Abernathy, in addressing an audience

in Memphis, stated 'we are coming to Washington to turn Washington

downside up and upside down." There have been other serious threats

which were obviously intended to intimidate

and coerce important officials

of the government.

On April 25, 1968, less than two weeks ago, the Senate

Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations held a conterence ith the

officials of

the Federal and District of Columbia Governments to discuss

this March on Washington.

Present at the conference were members of the Subcommittee and

the following Federal officials:

Attort-y General Ramsey Clark; Secretary

of the Interior Stewart L. Udall; Under Secretary of the Army David

McGiffert; General Ralph E. Haines, JI., of the U. S. "Army; Major General

Charles I. Southward of the National Guard; and Major General William P.

Yarborough of U. S. Army Intelligence. District of Columbia officiala .

who attended sere Mayor Waltar Washinston, Directop of Public Sainty.

!

The purpose of the conference was to ascertain what polleles

and procedures these governmental agencies propose to follow In preventire,

controlling or supervising this demonstration. Specifically, we wanted

to learn what actions had been taken or would be taken to maintain law and

order in the District of Columbia during the march, to assure that the

orderly processes of governent will not be disrupted or halted, to

protect the citizens of the city from physical harm and their property

from damage

and destruction, and to prevent the outbreak of violence as

a consequence of the mass demonstrations which have been announced.

All of us are aware, through our mail and telegrams, that the

nation is deeply disturbed about the possible consequences of this march.

Our people have a right to know whether the government is making the

preparations necessary to avert another period of violence in our

nation's capital, or whether there is procrastination on the part of

responsible heads of government. We would like to know whether needed •

and firm decisions are being deferred and unduly delayed during this

period of tense conditions in the wake of the recent rioting. The city

has had more than 50 instances of suspected arson since April 15.

In my opinion, the President of the United States has the

obligation and responsibility to announce promptly and firmly to those

who are coming to Washington to participate in the demonstrations,

that lawlessness, disruption of governent, and incitement to rioting

and violence will not be tolerated. The time 1s getting short; the

marchers are already on the way. Word from the President should go out

immediately to the entire nation that the Government of the United States

1n Its capital city will not be subjected to intinidation, humiliation

and disruption, and that any attempt at violence, rioting, burning and

plundering in the city of Washington will be promptly met with such

force as may be necessary to prevent or to quell such acts.

All American citizens have the right to peacefully petition

and officials for the redress of grievances, ard such

presented should be heard and appropristely acted upon.

permitted to employ intimidation and coercion or to resort to civil

disobedience and violence to impose its will or to achieve its aims.

If this is tolerated, law and order will be destroyed and a safe and

peaceful society will surely perish.

In his press conference of May 3, the President acknowledged

the dangers attending this march. When he was asked about the march

by a news reporter, he made the following comments about the possibilities

of violence: "We hope that the presentation made will be nonviolent

although WE ARE WELL AWARE THAT NO SINGLE INDIVIDUAL CAN GIVE ANY

ASSURANCE THAT THEY CAN CONTROL A SITUATION LIKE THIS. IT CONTAINS MANY

INHERENT DANGERS. We are concerned with them. We have made extensive

preparations." Most regrettably, however, the President failed to take

advantage of the opportunity in his press conference, on nationwide

network television and before the assembled White House press corps,

to sound a firm warning to the narchers, and especially to their leaders,

and to give positive assurances to the American people that civil

disobedience, rioting, looting and burning will not be tolerated--that

such force as may be necessary to deal with violence effectively will

be positively and promptly used.

Mr. President, the Subcommittee today is releasing the

transcript of the conference of April 25 so that the public can be fully

informed and alerted to the dangers that are inherent in this impending

demonstration under a leadership who, as I stated previously, have

announced that they are coming here to "turn Washington downside up and

upside down."

The Attorney General was urged by the Subcommittee to seek

redress in the courts by injunction to prevent the marchers fron resorting

to violence and civil disorders. Tae many public statements made by tha

leaders of the merch alone would warrant the granting of such injunctien

We are, or should be, a people of law and order. The governent aluid

make use of the remedtes that are available to it. It should invoke lie

NW 68262 Docld:32989577 Page 838

## Page 839

power of the courts to enjoin and prevent the threatened disorders and

Iawlessness In our nation's capital. It is of the utmost importance

that all possible steps be taken to meet the dangers and challenges this

impending march imposes.

The transcript of the conference makes clear that some of the

Important decisions have not yet been made and that adequate planning is

far from complete. For example, we do not know where the marchers will

be allowed to build their "shantytowa," because that decision has not

been made, or 1f

made, has not been announced. The statements of

Secretary Udall indicate that the decision about the granting of a

permit for a "shantytown" will be a policy decision made in conjunction

with other high level authorities. Does this mean that the decision

and responsibility for permitting the building of a "shantytown" will be

in the White House? Will the marchers be permitted to pitch their tents

and build their shacks on the Mall or on the grounds around the Washington

Monument? We do not know, because we were informed in the conference

that no application for a permit had been submitted and no decision had

yet been made.

I have also been advised by Secretary Udall that as of this

morning no request for a permit had been submitted. However, I read In

this morning's paper a statement by a leader of the march that they

propose to utilize Federal property of their choosing without a permit

and without having requested a permit.

Apparently, the leaders of this march intend to defy the

authorities

and deliberately violste the law for the purpose of provoking

an incident. In my opinion, this is contrary to every proper concept

of peaceful assembly. Instead, it is a premeditated act of contempt for

and rebellion against the sovereignty of government.

It is also clear that no one in authority knows how many persons

are coming or exactly where they are coning from. There may be 100,000

demonstrators on the streets on Memorial Day, May 30, according to

estimates

i the march leaders themselves

. 1 8.

I sincerely believe that a positive and unequivocal warning

to that effect should be given to the marchers and their leaders who are

making dire threats of what they intend to do when they get here, and

such reassurances should be given to the entire nation by the President

himself, so the American people can know that this city is not faced

with shame and disgrace because of lack of purpose and determination

on the part of our government to prevent it.

The probability of violence exists, Mr. President. Indeed,

there is reliable inforuation that 1t 1s actually being planned by certain

militant advocates of violence who will swarm along the marchers'

routes and will move into the "shantytowas" when they are erected.

During the conference, I asked the Attorney General If he

had information that militants are plotting now to cast aside the

Reverend Ralph Abernathy and take over the mass demonstrations once

the marchers reach Washington. He said that he was not familiar with

any such information.

The Subcommittee has received sworn Information that this is

actually being planned, and this information comes from within the

militant movement itself. There are militant leaders, now on the road

or ready to march with their followers towards Washington, who have

boasted to their followers that, once they arrive here, they will control

their own groups and incite them to rioting and violence. They are

bragging that they will not leave Washington without new wardrobes

which they will acquire when the looting starts. They say that some

of their group will be armed with switch-blade knives and hand guns.

, Some of the men who are doing the planning and making these

threats are given to violence and have criminal records.

Some of them

have been charged with serious crimes. One of them said in a meeting

of his group, "The only good white man is a dead white man," and "pick

The transcript shows that the Public Welfare Department of

the District of Columbia Intends, under present policies, to provide

rood or food stamps for those who declare thenselves to be destitute,

to provide shelter for those who state that they have none and have as tunas

to provide 1t for themselves, and to process applications for other

spocific forms of welfare assistance. In fact, if any marcher states

that he 1s destitute and without the necessities of life, the Public

Helfare Department will furnish him with a cash grant up to $100 in

some cases, to support him for

one month. Recruits for the march are

being told to go to Washington one night and get on welfare the next

day.

There are some statements in the transcript which are somewhat

reassuring. The Under Secretary of the Aruy, Me. McGiffert, told the

Subcormittee that the Army 1s ready and able, under Presidantial arder,

to commit large numbers of troops to the city at very short notico to

handle any contingency which night arise.

The Attorney General Informed us that "any unlawfilness will

be net with adequate law enforcement to control 1t." He was asked

about the predictions which nost of us have heard that the bridges

Icading into the city will be blocked by tha marchsra and that the

entrances of Federal buililago will be obstructed.

:

The Subcomnittee has evidence, Mr. President, that certain

militant leaders of marchers have announced In secret meetings that it

is their intention to carry out the following objectives:

I. They will build a "shantytown" on the Mall whether or not

they have a permit to do it.

2. They will prevent Senators and Congressuen fron reaching

their offices by accosting them on the streets of Capitol Hill, and

they do not intend to obey the laws which prohibit demonstrations and

disorder on Capitol Hill.

3. They will place children in the forefront of demonstrations

in order to gain publicity about "police brutality" whenever the police

or the Army are required to control crowds and stop law violations.

4o They will obtain new clothing and other merchandise when

the looting starts.

5. They will carry weapons.

6. They will not post bond for their followers who may be

arrested so that the jails and other detention centers will be fillea

and will stay filled, and thus the District will be unable to remove

and detain masses of law violators.

7. They will incite demonstrators to violence and rioting.

To prevent these things from happening, I would most respect-

fully suggest and urge that the President issue a firm and unequivocal

warning to the marchers and reassurances to the public, in words so plain

and positive that they cannot be misunderstood, that violence, looting,

arson or the disruption of civic order and the functioning of government

will not be tolerated; that this city will not be turned "downside up

FOR RELEASE WHEN DELIVERED ON FLOCR OF THE SENATE

REMARKS OF SENATOR JOHN L. McCLELLAN

RELATING TO THE MARCH ON WASHINGTON

Mr. President, the so-called "Poor People's March on Washington"

Is a matter of deep concern to every law abiding citizen of our country.

The stated intentions of the leaders of the march are to

assemble in this city many thousands of demonstrators--no one seems to

know how many there will be--in an atmosphere and under conditions which

are calculated to lead to civil disorders and violence. I quote one oi

their leaders, the Reverend A.

D. King, brother of the late Martin Luther

K1n6, speaking on April 21, 1968: "We are going to Washington and

disrupt Washington so it cannot function unless it does something about

black people." On May 2, Reverend Abernathy, In addressing an audience

in Memphis, stated 'we are coming to Washington to turn Washington

downside up and upside down."

There have been other serious threats

which were obviously intended to intimidate and coerce important officials

of the government.

On April 25, 1968, less than two weeks ago, the Senate

Permanent Subcomnittee on Investigations held a conference with the

officials of the Federal and District of Columbia Governments to discuss

this March on Washington.

- de

Present at the conference were members of the Subcommittee and

the :Ollowing Federal officials: Attorney General Ramsey Clark; Secretary

of the Interior

Stewart L. Udall; Under Secretary of the Army David

McGiffert; General Ralph E. Haines, JI., of the U. S. "Army; Major General

have put off their planned midtown

march until Monday in the hope of

bringing

in outsiders, none of them

involved in the core issue which is the

sanitation strike against the City of

Memphis, a labor rather than a racial

City strategy has been to seek a

federal court restraining order against

the march. This was granted temporar-

ily by Judge Bailey Brown, with the

understanding

that

he or Federal

Judge Robert McRae could alter or

reverse the order.

A possible alteration would be to pro-

vide federal marshals to help in con-

trolling such a march. The point is not

to help King prove he can lead a "non-

violent"' march, but to protect Mem-

phis against a

repeat of last week's

Beale Street destruction.

March leaders indicate they will ig-

nore any court injunction against a

King demonstration. That could only

invite disturbance and confrontation

with law enforcement officers.

The burden should be placed by fed-

eral court upon federal law enforce-

ment to control the marchers anato

protect the public. Such control is es-

sential.

Demonstration Eruots

_ MAPIIS, TENT

In an instant last week, a fairly orderly demonstration

in support of the sanitation strike degenerated into an'ugly

outbreak of looting and rioting, bloodshed and pillage. A

great part of the downtown area and the southwestern part

of the city were in a state of near martial law after police,

firemen, state troopers and the National Guard were

called to queich the frenzy.

Observers agreed the violence started when dozens of

Negro youths bolted from the pack on Beale Thursday and

started breaking windows and looting. That set off a

12-hour spell of violence that saw one Negro youth slain,

scores hurt and more than 300 arrested.

Dr. Martin Luther King, in town to lead the demon-

stration, was quickly whisked away when the disturbance

started. As it continued over a great area of the city, fires

were set, bombs were tossed and police and firemen were

harassed continuously. Determined guardsmen warned all

persons off Beale Street, literally wrecked in the melce.

Mayor Henry Loco quickly set down at 7 p.m.-to-5 a.m.

curfew under powers granted by a law rusher through the

Tennessee General Assembly the day of the outbreak.

Liquorand beer sales were forbidden, as was the sale of

firearms.

IN THE. ACTUAL strike itseif, efforts, to mediate it

appeared futile. Union leaders walked out of mediation

talks with city government representatives in the seven-

week strike before the talks moved past the first issue,

union recognition. The break-oti came as the third day of

talks was near an end.

The union walked out and officials charged Mayor

Henry Loeb in effect had tied the city committee's hands

from the union.

crucia eate relie, revere on version

The union charged the biggest roadblock was a conten-

tion by the city committee that it had no power to agree on

anything — that only the rayor could. However the city

committee claimed the union demanded it first be recog-

exclusive bargaining agent before any other

points at issue could be discussed.

THE NEWLY CREATED National Alliance of Busi-

nessmen (NAB) and Labor Department are hoping Mem-

phis metropolitan area businessmen will hire 600 hard-core

unemployables

by June, 1969, and 1,500 disadvantaged

youths this summer. Such was the goal outlined to a

meeting of about 100 businessmen.

William Norwood Jr., regional manpower director with

the Labor Department, was reluctant to quote exact fig-

ures. However, he said, "We, hope the response by the

business community will prove these target figures to be a

low minimum." The alliance, backed by the Labor Depart-

ment and headed nationally by Henry Ford II, will attempt

to find jobs for 500,000 hard-core unempiovables by June,

1971. The goal is 100,000 by 1969, and this summer the

alliance wants to find jobs for 200,000 disadvantaged

•youths, said Porter Grace Jr., president of Union Planters

National Bank and chairman of the Memphis Chapter of

• the Alliance.

new resolution approving the presently planned roue of

move apparently delayed any action on the heated issue

for at least another week despite a report that Federal

Highway Administrator Lowell Bridwell will not approve

any east-west expressway in the "foreseeable future"

unless the council changes its position with a new resolu-

tion.

Meanwhile in Washington, it came to light that nation-

does not want to commit funds to the through-the-park

route in the face of a threatened suit without the solid

backing of the City Council here.

Curfew Is Liffed;

Main Near Normal

The curfew placed on Memphis after Thursday's riuting

was lifted today, bus service returned to regular schedules,

and Main Street moved toward business as usual.

Meanwhile, a top lieutenant oi Dr. Martin Luther King,

whose Thursday march ended in viclence, announced that

King will return to Memphis tomorrow and will "probably

dead a massive march Friday."

On the curiew-lifting, May-

or Henry Loeb and Sheriff

William Morris issued a joint

statement saying the curfew

removal means

"all limita-

tions which were imposed

are now removed."

They expressed apprecia-

tion to authorities in nearby

Arkansas,

Mississippi and

Tennessee for their coopera-

tion in supporting the cur-

few.

Another march in support

of the strike was scheduled

for 2 p.m. today. At a Clay

born

Tempie press confer-

ence it was also announced

that others would doubtless

be called.

UPSWING

ON BEALE

seale Street, scene of most

of the violence, also showed

signs of life again atter 2

weekend of quiet enforced by

National Guardsmen. Signs

proclaiming "Open for Busi

YOUTH IS SLAIT;

SCORES INJURED

Juveniles Spark Violence, Looting

As King Leads Strike March

Teams of police and National Guardsmen patrolled trouble

spots over a major part of Memphis last night, as a stunned

city counted one death, more than 200 arrests and scores of

injuries in its first full-scale race riot.

More than 3,800 National Guard troops moved into the city

yesterday afternoon and last night in the wake of rioting and

looting that left Main Street and historic Beale Street littered

with bricks, blood and broken glass. Police last night were

unable to estimate the number of businesses looted. Liquor

stores in predominantly Negro areas were favorite targets of

the looters.

The rioting was touched off during a march down Main led

by Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. The civil rights leader and

Nobel Peace Prize winner was hustled away from the down.

town scene as violence began to flare.

A tight curfew - probably the first in the city's history

since the Civil War — was imposed by Mayor Henry Loeb. It

authorized police to question anyone on the streets between the

hours of 7 p.m. and 5 a.m. and arrest anyone without "legiti-

mate business or emergency reasons."

The riot tell last night was one dead - Larry Payne, 16, of

3023 Parker, shot by a policeman after he turned on the officer

with a butcher knife. He was being chased on a looting charge.

Negro

leaders

and Fire and Police Director Frank L.

Holloman both emphasized that yesterday's march was an

orderly one, and the trouble started when a group of about 200

youths - many of whom appeared to have been drinking —

separated themselves from

the main hody of about 5,000

marchers. and went on a window-breaking. looting binge.

Many of them were black power advocates, several wearing

the Jackets'öf the Invaders, a local black power group.

WASHINGION SPRING PROJECT-

RACIAL MATTER

slowly intensifying confrontation between the Federal

Government and a minimum of 3, 00u poor people.

Tactics

will mainly be sit-ins and marches which will be put into

and not all at once.

As of

April 22, 1968, Dr. King and up to 100 other civil rights

and Negro community leaders from around the country will start

visiting congressional leaders, heads of Government departments

and agencies, "presenting to them the demands of the campaign and

asking them to take action. Several days later, after nothinto

been done, they will probably pick one office and refuse

leave.

When

they are arrested, the poor people across the country

will be mobilized and begin to

come in caravans."

The article indicated that well before the April 22nd

starting date, work was expected to start on a "New City of

Hope" with tents or temporary buildings set up on a 30 acre

site and supplied with electricity, sewer lines, an outdoor

theater, kitchens

and parking.

The article indicated that if still nothing is done

by the Federal Government, then acts of "moral disobedience"

will begin.

The "People's World' issue of March 23, 1968, carried

an article which indicated that Dr. King spoke before 150

Negro church leaders at the Elks Club on Central Avenue, Los

Angeles, California on March 16, 1900. Dr. King urged the

ministers to begin now to organize for mass outpourings of

people from their congregations to join the demonstration.

The "People's forld" is a West Coast communist

newspaper which is published weekly in San Francisco,

California.

slowly intensifying confrontation between the Federal

Government and a minimum of 3, 000 poor people..

Tactics

will mainly be sit-ins and marches which will be put into

play over a perioa of weeks and not all at once.

As of

• April 22, 1968, Dr. King and up to 100 other civil rights

and Negro community leaders from around the country

will start

visiting congressional leaders, heads of Government departments

and agencies, "presenting to them the demands of the campaign and

asking them to take action.

Several days later, after nothing

has been done, they will probably pick one office and refuse to

leave.

When

they are arrested, the boor reople across the country

will be mobilized and begin to come in caravans."

The article indicated that well before the April 22nd

starting date, work was expected to start on a "New City of

theater, kitchens and parking.

The article indicated that if still nothing is done

by the Federal Government, then acts of "moral disobedience"

will begin.

The "People's World" issue of March 23, 1960, carried

an article which indicated that Dr. King spoke before 150

Negro church leaders at the Elks Club on Central Avenue, Los

Angeles, California on March 16, 1968. Dr. King urged the

ministers to begin now to organize for mass outpourings of

people fron their congregations to join the demonstration.

newspaper which is

published weekly

in San Francisco,

California.

RE:

SANITATION WORKERS STRIKE,

MEMPHIS, TENNESSEE;

RACIAL MATTERS

On the night of March 21, 1968, Captain Jewell

Ray, Inspectional Bureau, Memphis, Tennessee, Police

Department, advised that

the Police Department had learned,

reliably that Reverend Martin Luther King, Jr., President S

the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLO)

Tennessee, at 8:15 a.m., March 22, 1968, from Atlanta

on Delta Airlines for the purpose

of leading a mass

downtown march in support of the sanitation Workers

who have been on strike since February 12, 1968.

He was scheduled to leave Memphis at 3:15 p.m.,

March 22, 1968, to return to Atlanta.

Ray pointed out that it was snowing hard in

Memphis on the night of March 21, 1968, and that there was

a good possibility that King would be unable to arrive, as

it was indicated that flights would be cancelled in and out

of Memphis.

On the morning of March 22, 1968, Lieutenant

E. H. Arkin, Inspectional Bureau,

Memphis Police Department,

advised that due to the fact that 12 inches of snow had

accumulated in Memphis and four additional inches were

predicted before the end of the day, Reverend James Morris

Lawson,

Jr., one of the ministers leading the

strike

sympathy demonstrators and who had promoted the proposed

mass march in downtown Memphis headed by King, had called

the Police Department and stated that the march had been

officially called off and that plans would probably be

made in the indefinite future for some future march,

although this was a matter of conjecture on Lawson's part.

the march was scheduled to start, and that those peonle

RE:

SANITATION WORKERS STRIKE,

MEMPHIS, TENNESSEE;

RACIAL MATTERS

On the night of March 21, 1968, Captain Jewell

Ray, Inspectional Bureau, Memphis, Tennessee, Police

Department, advised that

the Police Department had learned

reliably that Reverend Martin Luther King, Jr:, President

of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC),

of Atlanta, Georgia, was due to arrive in Memphis,

Tennessee, at 8:15 a.m., March 22, 1968, from Atlanta

on Delta Airlines for the purpose

of leading a mass

downtown march in support of the Sanitation Workers

who have been on strike since February 12, 1968.

He was scheduled to leave Memphis at 3:15 p.m.,

March 22, 1968, to return to Atlanta.

•

Ray pointed out that it was snowing hard in

Memphis on the night of March 21, 1968, and that there was

a good possibility that King would be unable to arrive, as

it was indicated that flights would be cancelled in and out

of Memphis.

On the morning of March 22, 1968, Lieutenant

E. H. Arkin, Inspectional Bureau,

Memphis Police Department,

advised that due to the fact that 12 inches of snow had

accumulated in Memphis and four additional inches were

predicted before the end of the day, Reverend James Morris

lawson, Jr., one of the ministers leading the strike

sympathy demonstrators and who had promoted the proposed

mass march in downtown Memphis headed by King, had called

the Police Department and stated that the march had been

officially called off and that plans would probably be

made in the indefinite future for some future march,

although this was a matter of conjecture on Lawson's part.

Martin Luther King, Jr.

Security Matter - C

A confidential source,

who has furnished reliable

information in the past, learned on March 29, 1968, that on that

dates stanley Levison and Martin Luther King, Jr. discussed

the position which King has found himself in as a result of the

Violence that occurred in Memphis, Tennessee, on March 28, 1969,

at the time when King led a march

through downtown Memphis.

King

Gold Levison that he feels they have to face the fact thatenge

from a public relations point of view and every other way,

In le maron throug de the fact vati nore

are in serious trouble"

he reierred to the washington D.C.

spring campaign, known as the poor People's Campaign, and said

•as far as it is concerned it is in trouble. King noted that it

will be much more difficult to recruit people for the Washington

campaign now because they (the Southern Christian Leadership

Conference) (SCLC) are recruiting non-violent people and these

people will

hold back if they think they will be in a campaign

• that

is going to be taken over by violent elements. King stated

that

this is not a failure for the SCLC because it has enough

of a program to affirm its position but that it is a personal

setback for himself.

King continued that persons such as Roy Wilkens

' (Head of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored

reiterated that they have had a great public relations seback as

far as his image and leadership are concerned.

Martin Luther King, Jr.

Levison attempted to dissuade King from this point

of view stating that it would be true only if King accepts "their"

definitic:i

He added that he feit it is a profound error King

is making..

King noted that he did not accept it himself but that

others will.

Levison retorted that people would accept it for

a: few days, but, if events prove otherwise, will not accept it.

King noted that events will not prove otherwise unless

they think soberly through this period. He said that somehow he had

to reaffirm what the press will refuse to affirm.

He referred to

the Memphis incident stating that they all know

it was just a

few people who were involved. He added that it was a failure

of the leadershiy in Memphis. King informed Levison that persons

the violence came to see him on the morning

He said these persons were fighting the

leadership in remphis, the men who ignored and neglected them, the

men who would not give them any attention, who ordered their

telephones cut off.

King added that he had no knowledge of all this,

that the

persons

responsible

for the violence were too sick to see

that what they were doing during the violence was hurting him, king,

more than it could hurt the local preachers.

King related that he was so upset and shocked over. the

Memphis violence that he was going to announce a personal fast

as a means of appealing to the Memphis leadership, as well as those

who participated in the violence, to come to him in a united

front to take up the

"cuaget" and

get on with the movement.

• He said he felt this kind of spiritual move would be a way of

unifying the movement, of transforming a minus into a plus. He

added that he feels their Washington campaign is doomed.

Levison attempted to convince King that his reasoning

was not correct. Levison said he was concerned over the "trap

King was placing non-violence in because King was saying that

he must have 100% adherence to non-violence which is an impossibility

King commented that they could not get 100% adherence but

that they must face the fact thatariot broke out in the ranks of

the march, that "these fellows"

, In the line of march, would

jump out, do something, and then come back to hide within

the group.

King said he is a symbol of non-violence and

that the press is not going to say what Levison said.

He

said the symbol will be weakened and it will put many Negroes

in doubt.

He said he must do something that is a powerful

act to unify forces and refute the press.

Levison stated that if it had this result he would

agree but

that he is bothered by the idea that King would be

accepting the logic of the press. that if king can control 99%,

and not the 1% who are violent, he is a failure. He said they

must find a way in which they do not accept this otherwise King

will never be able to do anything unless he always spiritually

reaches a level where he hypnotizes every Negro alive.

King questioned how he could say that they can

control the planned demonstrations in Washington,D.C. and at the

same time conclude they are going to have l% violence.

Levison counseled that King can say that he can control

his followers and is not undertaking to control everybody else.

he said King could take the position that his followers are non-

violent and will do what they must do.

They agreed to discuss the matter in depthat a meeting

• in Atlanta, Georgia in King's church office on the morning of

March 30, 1963.

The same source advised on March 31, 1900, that or

chat date stanley Levison commented on the meeting held in Atlanta.

Georgia, on March 30, 1968. Levison's comments included the

following:

At the Atlanta meeting they examined the whole Memphis

incident and came up with a new approach.

"We are going back to

Memphis.

We are going to prove that you can have mass action

in the streets"

Martin Luther King had decided not to go

back to memphis ana not to go to washington (Ior the Poor People'.

campaign. It was the determination of the SCLC staff that

NW 68262 Docld:32989577 Page 1118

STEPANI

## Page 1119

SECRET

Martin Luther King, Jr:

changed King's thinking.

King is going back to Memphis

on luesday (April 2,

1968) and there will be a big march on

Friday (April 5, 1968).

The Memphis incident was

caused ty

"a handful of kids" and it could have been controlled by "our

• guys" (the SCLC) had they been there.

He, Levison, made the point that they could not let

"a couple of kids" keep "mass action" from being their weapon.

As for controlling the Washington, D.C. demonstrations,

King knows he can control the youth.

What has to be done is

go to the high schools and tell them what the establishment

wants them to do.

Once they grasp this there is no chance of

anything happening.

What they (the SCLO) are afraid of in

Washington is a double cross from Stokley Carmichael

and the

answer to that is that "our job" (the SCLO")

but to be non-violent themselves.

"Our position

Is that we"lolence

are going to go on because to be able to march inthe streets is

"our' most important tool" and are not going on the streets because

it may start violence. "why do we have to be afraid of riots.

It is their problem not ours"

The Atlanta meeting was good because it shows how

much militancy there is in the scLc.

A conildential source, who has furnished

reliable intormation in the past, advisea

in April, 1964, that Stanley Levison was

a secret

"RACIAL MATTER

On March 28, 1968, a confidential source advised that

during the morning of that date Reverend Martin Lather King,

JI.,

President, Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCIC),

parcicipated in a march in Menphis, Tennessee, conducted by

sanitation workers who are currently on strike in that community.

During this maich, incidents of violence were engaged in by a

relatively snall group of Negroes.

With reference to the above incidents, it was the

opinion on March 28, 1968, of Revererd King, Ralph D. Abernathy,

•Vice President and Treasurer, SCIC; Bernard Lee, Special Aide

do the President, SCLo; and Hosea

Willians, Director of Voter

Registsetion and

Politidal Education, SOLC,

that those responsible

therefor were in no way connected with SCIC but rather represented

a minority who obviously are neither in sympathy with Revereud

King nor SCLC. Reverend King and his colleagues did not know

• these 1ndividuals but

suspected they might possibly

be connected with sore "black pover" organization.

prospects {0

suscess of SCIC's contenplated Yashington

Spring

Project (WSP). Revererd King told his colleagues on this date

that because of his participation in the lemphis march, the

aisturbance which developed and the ensuing publicity he was

gravely feariul that his inige and that of ScLe as advocates of

nonviolence sill be blemished.

Subscribing to the thought that those responsible

March 29,

1968

Martin Luther ning, Jr.

Security Matter

A confidential source, who has furnished reliable

information in the past, learned on March 20, 1960, that,

late on that date, stanley Levison and martin Luther King, Jr.

discussed the violence that occurred in Memphis, Tennessee

on March 20, 1900, following King's leadership

of a protest -

narch through downtown Memohis.

King indicated that he has

become so depressed over the developments in Memphis that

he has considered calling off the Washington March (his

self-described Poor People's Campaign, scheduled to begin in

Washington, D.C. on April 22, 1968).

Levison told king that his depression was

aggravated

because he is physically exhausted as a result of his recent

strenuous program.: He counseled King not to be on the defensive

over the events in Memphis but, on the contrary, should take

the position that the majority of people in the Memphis March

did not join in the rioting that took place, proving the

effectiveness of King's leadership and his policy of non-violence.

Levison

emphasized that the Washington March will

be different

in that King will have organized this march and his forces can

stress the importance of non-violence.

Levison suggested that

meet in Atlanta to discuss

meeting on Friday night (March 29, 1968) because it will give

King time to rest.

Martin Luther King, Jr.

King agreed in every respect with Levison's

evaluation.

The source also ascertained that, prior to conferring

with King, Levison spoke with the Reverend

Ralph Abernathy,

an aide of Dr. King's, who advised Levison that King has

cancelled a scheduled

appearance in Washington, D.C. on

March 29, 1968.

Abernathy also noted that King is scheduled

to be in Virginia on Saturday (March 30, 1968) but will

probably cancel that appearance.

Abernathy continued that

it was a mistake for the King forces not to have a staff in

Memphis to train people in non-violence. He said it also was

a mistake on the part of the King forces not to have been

more aware of the local situation.

A contidential source, who has furnished

reliable information

in the past,

advised

in April, 1904, that Stanley Levison was

a secret

member of the Communist Partys

WASHINGTON SPRING PROJECT

Reference is made to our memorandum dated March 19,

1968, and captioned as above, which sets forth information

concerning progress in, the organization and planning of the

Washington Spring Project (WSP).

Martin Luther King, JI., President, Southern

Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC), has publicly announced

he will conduct a massive civil disobedience campaign in the

Nation's Capitol during April, 1968, in an' effort to pressure

Congress into passing legislation favorable to the Negro.

In pursuit. of this project, the SCLC has opened an

' office in Washington, D. C., from which to organize and direct

the MSP.

On March 22, 1968, a press conference was called by

WSt representatives at the SCLC Office, Washington, D. C. (VDC).

Ac the conference an announcement was made that King was expected

•to be in WDC on April 22, 1968, to initiate the WSP by presenting

a. WDC affiliate of the SCLC..

The chairman of the Food Committee reported that

examined.

A rapresentative of the Xaverian College, 10000

New Hampshire Avenue, White Oak, Maryland, met with the group

and advised the college could handle six hundred people at one

time., The source did not know if this had reference to handling

six hundred people as residents or feeding that number at one

•time.

No site has been located on which to erect the "New

City" to house the demonstrators. Three sources from which land

can be obtained were discussed. They were:

• mine.

District of Columbia land;

•..

mately

10:00 p.m. on March 19, 1968, and delivered a 10 to 15

minute inspiring talk concerning the Washington Spring Project.

King pointed out that the grandparents and parents of

those present worked for nothing and as a result the

present generation of Negroes have little or nothing. King

warned that the grandchildren of those present will also have

nothing if the Negro fails to act today and demand his God

given and constitutional rights.

He strongly encouraged the

local Negro to rise up and join the Washington Spring Project.

King explained that the purpose of the Washington

Spring Project

was to 'emphasize to the world that the American Negro, though

he is an

American citizen, he is

not receiving the constitutional

rights which are supposedly guaranteed to all American citizens

'but in reality are given only to American white citizens.

Source advised that the Church was crowded with

approximately 300 persons and some 100 to 150 left before

King's arrival as he was approximately three hours late

arriving in Laurel. A collection was taken for King at

the Church, the amount received unknown.

CURRENT EVALUATION OF VIOLENCE POTENTIAL,

Source number one who lives in the Northeast and

works in the Northwest sections of VDC, advised as follows

02 March 11, 1963:

The racial situation in WDC appears to be very

uncertain. Nobody knows what is going to happen in WDC

and many people are scared. They are not sure what will

happen when Dr. Martin Luther King's "poor people's campaign"

begins in April. iven though De. King has asked the

militants to stay out of the activities, there is no

assurance the request will be honored.

The March Il, 1968, issue of the "Newsweel"

magazine, page 15 contained a paragraph captioned "Washington".

It

stated Washington had never been considered to be a

major racial tinderbox as nuch of iis Negro population works

for the federal government and is insulated by civil service

security fron the vorst chills of black despair. It stated

Washingion was facing the summer with nervous uncertainty,

and Di. King was bringing 3000 demonstrators to Washington

to begin a summer-long campaign of picketing and marching

for jobs and income..

The March 12, 1968 issue of "The Evening stain

a daily WDC newspaper, page B-I reported that District

• Safety Director Patrick V. Murphy had said the Washington

police hoped to train as many as 2,800 volunteers for

energency duty this summer in an enlarged "Police Reserver

Corps". Most of them would be used for station duty and

thus free additional

policemen curing emergencies.

The March 12, 1968 issue, of "Washington Afro-American",

a Washington, D. C. newspaper, page 12, reported that The

National Advisory Connission on Civil Disorders had said

that "Abrasive relationships between police and non-whites

have been a major source of rioting in the racial ghettos

of American cities".

On March 14, 1968, source number

two who works

in the ghettos of WDC and is acquainted with many of the

under privileged advised

as follows:

The "poox people's campaign" which is a demonstra

sion being planned by Di. Nartin Luther King, Jr. has been

given the support of a number of the larger religious groups

in WDC.

The demonstration will show the underprivileged

that much effort is being-expended in effoits to improve

their life. It is believed the demonstration will be

beneficial. Plans are being made to have volunteers from

among the demonstrators, who will agree to be arrested if

necessary. It is not believed that any racial trouble will

result from the demonstratión..

source number two further advised as follows:

Stokely Carnichael is in Washington, D. C. alc has

organized the Black United Front, (BUC), but it is not

believed that Carmichael will have much support from BU!

members i Carnichael decides to create violence in NDC.

The

majority of the BUr members are not expected to support

any plans for racial violence.

On March I1, 1968, source number three who resides

in the Northwest section of WDC advised as follows:

It is his belief that a riot could take place in

HDC over some unexpected incident such as the arrest of a Negro.

This has happened in the past in other large cities.

Other

than the above situation,

the conditions are such that the

source is optimistic about a riot-free summer in VDC.

at The Church of The Redeemer, 15th and Girard Streets,,

N. E., WDC at the invitation of the Fellowship Forum of the

church.

Among other things, Carmichael said the black people

in the United States must connect with the 900 million black

people of the "third world" to liberate themselves from the

control of the white man..

He described the "third world" as

including the black people of Cuba, West Indies, Haiti,

South America and Africa®

He said. the United States is

planning genocide against the Negroes and for this reason

Negroes

should arm themselves.

He said he did not mean a

22: caliber either.. He advocated that every black man in the

United States get a gun.

He stated that if Negroes obtained

an arsenal, relations between whites and blacks would be equal.

Source number four

further-stated as follows:

Carmichael said he realized many black'

people do not agree with:his idology, and that there are many

"Uncle Toms" in the communitys Carmichael said his grouI

proposes that ii

they develop

information about a person

"being that way", someone will talk to that person and

attempt to change, his mind and "if he does not change his

ways, he will be considered a traitor to his community and all

traitors die". Carmichael said black people should support

the Arabs in any conflict between the Arabs and the Israelis.

•He said the IDC Public School System is 93% Negro and the

curriculum must be changed to be more relative to the Negro

community.

The Maich 18, 1968, issue of "The Washington

gun.

The only reason the honkie (white man) is able to rule

is because he has a gun'.

Colored Peoplé had voted to support the goals of the Reverend

Dr. Martin Luther King's "Poor People's Campaign".

Source number five who lives and works in the

Northwest section, of WDC, on March 18, 1968, advised as

LOLLOWS:

It is believed there are some individuals in NDC

who may be inclined toward the creation of racial trouble

in DC, but these are not likely to initiate any actions

toward the starting of trouble.

Noxthwest ghetto is that in order for the "poor people's

campaign" to be successful, Dr. Martin Luther King,

will have to bring in outsiders for his revorted "civil

disobedience" in VIDC. Il the event large numbers of outsiders

are brought in, their behavior will be very difficult to

control. Therefore anything may happen.

Source number one further advised as follows on

March 18, 1968:

In the Northeast area near the source's residence,

there has been a lack of enthusiasm by the WDC citizens for

Er. King's "poor peoples campaign". These people are not in

sympathy with Dr. King's plans as they fail to see that any

benefits may result from any demonstration involving civil.

• aisobedience.

Source number six who resides in Northwest WDC

and is employed in a Northwest ghetto area, advised as

foldows on March 18, 1968:

The foremost concern of people in WDC is the unknown

potential

fOr

racial trouble which could take place when Dr.

Martin Luther King and his "poor people's campaign" begins

in WoO in April 196S.

Many leaders of organizations in WDC

Of Dr. King's impact on the racial scene of WDC.

These

leadeis are very concerned and are trying to determine what

response WDC citizens may give Dr. King.

Levison, referring

Wachtel that the National Committee for a Sane Nuclear Policy

specifically endorsed the Washington campaign.

He added that

Tudja Crowder, whom he described as the new Executive Director

Levison felt this was

important

and said that, if theresis an. element of the peace movement they

might get to join "this"

• Levison-also mentioned that the Washington Jewish

had told them that the scIc would notify the police on anything

they did. Levison questioned how Young could have promised this

RE: . WASHINGTON SPRING PROJECT

A source, who has furnished reliable information in

the past, advised

on March 5, 1968, that James Gibson, Southern

Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC), Representative from

National Headquarters of, SCLO, Atlanta, Georgia, is presently

attempting to recruit participants for the washington Spring

Project (WSP) In the Virginia Counties of Amelia, Brunswick

A characterization of SCIC is attached hereto.

It is stated this recruiting drive, aimed at

attracting persons in the hazd-core unemployed and low income

employe groups has met been too successal. Persons approached

have been asked

to attend and participate in captioned sctivities

at Washington, D.C. A

lack of funds needed to obtain the required

transportation is a major problem.

RE: WASHINGION SPRING PROJECT

On March 4, 1968, Reverend Everett E. Smith; Richmond,.

Virginia, & member of the State Board of Virginia of SCIC,

advised he has been in close contact with Dr. Martin Luther King

regarding plans for the latter's visit to Virginia on March 30,

1968.

these plans, which are subject to change, are that Dr. King

will visit Danville, Virginia, and Prince Edward County, Virginia,

on the latter date.

He will appear at & rally held at & Negro

church in Richmond, Virginia, later fi the day of March 30, 1968.

ACcoraing to Reverend Sming

the purpose of Dr. King's visit to

Virginia is to stimulate interest and participation in the wSP

as well as to promote the interest and growth of SCLe.

Reverend Smith and other sources, who are in a position

to learn of activities in connection with WSP. have advised

generally that they do not anticipate that promotion of WSP will

be too successful in the Richmond area. They based their

opinions on past experiences in this type of activity.

They

advised these have not been too successful in the past, describing

race relations in the Richmond area as good.

They pointed out

that there exists in Richmond a "middle.

class complacency" that has prevented a concerted or mass united

effort in the promotion of activities designed to better the

conditions of Ñegroes in the community. This "complacency"

rael, is based on the lact there sre jobs for legroes, and inter

group is, comparad to other areas, economically well off.

They pointed

that Negzoes heve been and are being hired in

City jobs and in other positions formerly available only to

persons of the white race.

settled,

OSBURN and BIBLER càn devote more time to the wse to recruit the

200 poople to travel to Washington, D.C., in April, 1958.

Reportedly Rev. OSBURN is very hopeful of recruiting

these 200 people as he does not feel it 1s a large number to

obtain as he has recruited larger numbers of individuals in the

past for other projects.

"When I first heard about Dr. King's proposed

WASHINGTON SPRING PROJECT (WSP)

"Since lobbying for meaningful civil rights legis-

lation is the announced goal of Dr. King's efforts, isn't

he really using these unfortunate pecple who can least

afford the time or money, as human pawns. Inspiring them

with promises as an inducement to get their participation,

is creating a false hope of personal reward before they

return home. If they return home disillusioned and empty

handed, they become prime examples of futility in their

communities.

"This must not be permitted to happen.

"I am afraid Dr. King's venture is frought vith

Irity dangers and problems.

The Negro has a just cause.

There is urgent need for putting pressure at every point

in our civil rights fight to achieve meaningful results.

This pressure should be pushed at the local, state and

netional levels.

Every resource at the Negro's command should

be pressed into the fight.

"On this, Dr. King or no one else will find any

opposition. However, doing something just for the publicity

of it and, using unfortunate human beings, is just going too

"It would be most unfortunate if what happened to

the bonus merchers in the late twenties during the Hoover

administration, happened to Di. King's marchers. Unfortunately,

the present feeling of a large segment of white

people is to

use the police force and, even the National Guard and the U.S.

Army to supress any riots. You can see from the way the

National Guard acted recently in Orangeburg, S.C., what to

"The goal is to have 200 representatives from 15

"The Freedot House is one of three groups here

which have endorsed the demonstration and are recruiting

participants. The others are Domestic Workers of

America, a union of household workers, and the Cleveland

Welfare Rights Movement, made up mostly of mothers on

velief rolls and their supporters.

"They are attempting to raise funds to charter buses

to washington and also seeking contributions to pay for child

care of mothers taking part, or families who will volunteer

to tend children.

"IN WASHINCION, churches are to be asked to provide

meals and lodgings for those taking part.

to employ those unable to get jobs elsewhere.

"'Present training and employment programs are

woefully inadequate. And we doubt that business will pro-

vide the jobs needed despite the government subsidy to be

this many people as he has recruited larger numbers in the past

"The Worker", an East Coast Communist newspaper,

on March 3, 1968, page

3, reported on the tribute to Dr.

W.E.B. DuBois, held at Carnegie Hall, on' Friday night,

rebruary <3s

It said

that the exent was organized by

"Freedomways" Magazine and inaugurated a year of celebration

of the 100th Anniversary of the birth of DI. DuBois. DuBois

was described as

a "scholar, writer; teacher, organizer and

Communist"

The article stated that Dr. Martin Luther King

delivered the address honoring the DuBois Centennial Year.

It recounted King's remarks in praise of DuBois and said

that:

"Summing up DuBois' life, King declared 'We can't

talk of Dr. DuBois without recognizing that he was a radical

all' of his life. Some people would like to ignore the fact

that he was a Communist in his later years. It is worth

noting that Abraham Lincoln warmly welcomed the

support of

Kar]. Marx during the Civil War and corresponded with him

freely'."

The article also stated that "King was vigorously

applauded when he said:

Memorandum G. C. Moore to W. C. Sullivan

RE: MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR.

Levison told Jones that he had received an excellent

response to a recent mailing. The solicitations were running

ahead of last year with $15,000 being received in one day.

Levison informed that the letter soliciting funds was carefully

written explaining King's project and, because of the success,

he was sending it to 250,000 more people.

Levison also told Jones 'that things are going well

in the mobilization for the project and King inforned him that

people from Alabama and Mississippi are "just raring to go."

OBSERVATIONS:

On February 28, 1968, a WFO informant informed us

that Bernard Lafáyette, project Director for SCLC, had informed

him King's organization is experiencing difficulty with re~

cruiting demonstrators for the "Washington Spring Project."

Because of this; the demonstrations would not start the first

week of April as originally planned.

Another-WFO informant learned from Lafayette's

assistant, Anthony fenry, that a secret meeting had been held

by King's group and they

had set April:27, 1968, as the date

for the project to start. Henry indicated this date can be

moved up or back depending on future developments.

It is felt that the President would be interested in

receiving information showing the communist help King is re-

ceiving in his proposed "Washington Spring Project."

RECOMMENDATION:

That copies of the enclosures be forwärded to

Mrs. Mildred Stegall at the White House; Mr. William Welsh,

Administrative Assistant to the Vice President; Secretary of.

Agriculture Freeman; Secretary of Labor Wirtz; Secretary of

Defense; Secret Service; the Attorney General; the Deputy

Attorney General; Assistant Attorneys General Pollak, Yeagley,

ment; and to the Departments As ay di

carefully written to center on the "Washington Spring Project"

and to explain 'the rationale for it. Because of the success

of this letter, Levison advised he will send it to 250,000

more people in the middle-clas.: income group.

Levison told Jones that things are going well in

the mobilization for the "Washington Spring Project." King

informed Levison recently that people from Alabama and

Mississippi are "just raring to go."

Another source advised on February 28, 1968, that

Bernard Lafayette, project Director, Southern Christian

Leadership Conference, had informed him "that King's organi-

zation is experiencing difficulty recruiting demonstrators

for the "Washington Spring Project."

Because of this, the

demonstration would not start the first week of April as

originally planned.

A third source learned from Anthony Henry, assistant

to Lafayette, that the Southern Christian Leadership Conference

had held a secret meeting and tentatively set a date of April 27,

1968, for the start of the "Washington Spring Project." Ac-

corcing to this source,

Heary indicated this date can be moved

'up or back depending on future developments.

A fourth source advised, in April, 1964, that

stanley Levison was a secret member of the Communist Party,

USA, in July, 1963. In late 1963, and early 1964, he

criticized the Commmist Party for not being sufficiently

militant in the civil rights struggle. Levison was described

"by certain Communist Party leaders as being to the "left" of

the Communist Party in his position on civil rights. His

differences with the Communist Party, however, are merely

tactical, and he continues his ideological adherence to

communism. • Stanley Levison is the owner and operator of

the Park Management Realty Company, 1841 Broadway, New York,

Information in the past, furnished information on February 23,

1968, reflecting that Stanley Levison was going to meet

on' the night of February 23, 1960.

Ma kenneut international Airport, new York city, to take him

to the "Freedomways"

Magazine sponsored affair at Carnegie

Hall, New York City, that night.

The same source learned on February 24, 1968, that

on that date, Stanley Levison told Clarence Jones

about the

affair sponsored by "Freedomways" Magazine on the night of

February 23, 1968.

Levison said he believed it illustrates

the degree of despair and. depression prevalent in

circles.

ae described it as the "deadest meeting" re heds ve

ever seen and said that people are depressed because they

are

frustrated over the Vietnam War and also feel there are no

answers to riots in the streets.

Referring to Martin Luther

King's

speech, he said that King has never read

badly:

Levison attributed this to King feeling

i, anything as

uncomfortable

at the meeting.

He said that King felt it was his duty to

pay a tribute to(i E.B.) Dubois but also knew it was not really

his (type of) croird.

He said King read his speech as if ne

Christian Leadership Conference (SCIC), to organize a massive

civil disobedience campaign in Washington, D. C., in the Spring

of 1968.

BACKGROUND:

King in the past has publicly announced he will

conduct a massive civil disobedience campaign he calls the

"Washington Spring: Project" in early April, 1968, to pressure

Congress into passing legislation favorable to the Negro.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS:

5 = DAlly

King is currently holding the first of two workshops

from 2/19-23/68 at Miami, Florida,. He has invited approximately

150 Negro ministers throughout the nation to attend this meeting.

¡ The Ford Foundation recently gave King's organization a $230,000

grant to hold these workshops in an effort to develop responsible

leadership in the Negro ghetto areas of the nation's major cities.

It has been determined that king plans to discuss the Washington

Spring Project at this workshop.

•DI. Join A. Morsell, Assistant Executive Director,

National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP),

Spring Project and is taking no part in it. He advised the MAces

Memorandum G. C. Moore to W. C. "Sullivan

RE:

MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR.

has tried, without success, to dissuade King from executing

the Project. Dr. Morsell is afraid that King cannot control

the demonstrators and there is alikellhood that the overall

demonstration will be taken over by extremists.

King appears to be concentrating his attention on

the South where he has chartered a small twin-engine aircraft

to help speid him about urging people to support his campaign.

SEARCE

' advised recently that the entire Washington

Spring Project seems to be suffering from indecision, petty

bickering among the staff members and the idiosyncrasies of

(King's ego. This source advised that King is worried about

the lack of progress being made by his recruiters.

He is

concered about the success of the program. He has instructed

his staff to seriously consider whether or not they can

successfully carry out the Project. It. they cannot then it

will be necessary to establish a reason as to why he finds

it necessary to discontinue the Washington Spring Project.

RECOMMENDATION:

That copies of the enclosures be forwarded to

Mrs. Mildred Stegall at the White House; Mr. William Welsh,

Administrative Assistant to the Vice President; Secretary of

Agriculture Ireeman;

Sacretary of Labor Wiitz; Secretary of

King has chartered a small twih-engine aircraft to

help speed him about the South urging people to support his

Washington Spring Project:

Another source advised recently that the entire

•Washington Spring Project seems to be suffering from indecision,

petty bickering among the staff members, and the idiosyncrasies

of King's ego.

This source advised that King is worried about

the lack of progress being made by his recruiters. He is con-

cerned about the success of the program. He has instructed his

staff to seriously consider whether or not they can successfully

carry out the Project. If they cannot, then it will be necessary

: to establish a reason as to why he finds is necessary to dis-.

continue the Washington Spring Project.

In this connection, the "Miami Herald" newspaper on

February 18, 1968; reported°that some Negro leaders will urge

King ,to detour his planned massive civil disobedience demon-

stration scheduled for April, 1968, in Washington, D. C.; and

redirect the demonstrators to the local districts of Congressmen

..: who have voted against civil rights legislation. These leaders

feel that Congressmen do not care what happens in

Washington, D. C., but they would feel the impact of these

demonstrations in their home districts.

In the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC), said

the

five-day series oi conferences will not include planning for

civil rights or anti-war demonstrations.

It was also reported that Dr. KING and Reverend YOUNG

both said they did not expect STOKELY CARMICRAEL and EAP BROWN,

leaders of the vocal Black Nationalist militancy to attend.

However, Reverend YOUNG said, "II STOKELY aNd RAP COME we

won't throw them out." This article goes on to report that

• in addition to the 150 official delegates, about 50 more

ministers are expected to attend the meetings, which are not

Ds. KING stated that over-integration could occur to

the point thet Negroes could lose their identity. He gave

an example

toe integration of the Methodist Church, however,

this was not further explained.

The oly remark that was made to the people in

attendance relative to the "Vashingion trip" was that this

In February 20, 1968,

the entire group vill be broken

up into "workshoo wits"

of the area lion which the various ministers came. All leaders

axe to take part in one activities of the workshop and report

back to the entire assemoly.

During the opening day of this meting, only one

and that involved some opposition

to the fact that apparently DAN MonAla., who was lormerly

connected with Urban Housing, has been invited to address tae

conterence in Miami. Some, ministers aisagreed with this

invitation, however, Reverend ANDREW YOUNG stated that his

presence could contribute to the conference, and that he

February. 19, 1963

RE:

WASHINGTON SPRING PROJECT

Reference is made to comication from the Miami

Office of

the Federal Baresu

of Investigation dated February

10, 1968.

The "Wiari Herald," a local Miami, Florida, newspaper,

reported February 18, 1958, that sone Negro

leaders,

not further

identified, "ill urge Dr. MARTIN ITTER KING, JR., at meetings

In Meni, Florida, to detour his plarned rassive

civil dis-

obedience demonstration scheduled for April in Washington, D.C.

The Negro leaders will recommend that efforts be redirected

to demonstrate in districts of Congressmen who have voted

against civil rights

legislation.

The "Hiani Herald" reported that one prominent civil

rights leader, who requested his

identity he withheld, said

"Congressmen could care 'less about demonstrations in

Fiashington--

and Negroes could be made to look bad rationally. But it the

demonstrations are held in the home districts of certain

Congressren they most certainiy will feel the impact."

MK T-l advised on February 19, 1968, chat Dr. MARTIN

NUTHHH MING,

IRo, arrived at the Sheraton Four Ambassadors

Rotel &t 10:50 PM

on February 18, 1938.

DI. KING refused to

villize the suite reserved for him and kept moving from room

tO rOOm.

TwO OL DI. KING'S aides, identitied as Dr. A. Y0UNG

and Reverend F. C. BENNETT, made a thorough check of che

20Om reSerYed for

Dr. KIG, apprently looking for a

• "bugging

device."

Di. KING, through Dr. FOCNS and Reverend BENUETT,

according to the source, has

already refused to be intervieved

•by the various news media and

I it appeared to the source that

KING was quite concerned with

the arount of security being

effected by the sheraton Four Ambassadors Hotel, along with

local authorities.

Re: VASHINGTON SPRING PROJECT (NSP)

CONFIDENTIAL

a serious throat against the life of Martin Luther King and

that an attempt upon his life will be made during this march.

In order to counteract such an attempt, Reverend Bennette

was assigned. to be in charge of security for Martin Luther

King and Ralph Henry was assigned to be Reverend Bennette's

assistant.

It was indicated that those involved in this

security should be alert for dangor, not only from white

persons but also from Negroes.

No additional information

was given at this time concerning any possible threats.

It was reported by several of those present that

serious difficulty had been encountered in the northern states

in recruiting participants for the lashington Spring Project.

It was, thereïone, decided to concentrate the recruitnent of

participants in the southern states. .

It was also reported that serious financial problems

have developed, especially in certain areas. Hosea Williams

presented proposed budgets for the "financially deprived or

unresponsive areas involved in the Washington campaign." He

stated that for one roason or another the following areas

seemed to be having unsolved financial problems in getting

their mobilization and recruiting started:

Mississippi

Alabama

Georgia

North Carolina

South Carolina

Virginia

Washington, D. C.

Baltimore, Maryland

Williams stated that it was originally planned that

each project area was to raise its own funds, however, this

•does not seem possible in the poorer areas at this time.

He

reported that he had conferred

with project leaders in the

above areas and they state that they can do the job provided

they are furnished the resources to get it started.

Based on

Villiams' conversations with these leaders, a budget has been

drawn up for each of the above areas which

provides between

$1,200 to $1, 500 per month with the exception of south Carolina

which will receive $740 and Washington, D. C., which will

receive $3, 500. Those budgets include paynents for itens such

become the laughing stock of the nation.

He declared that if

SCio produces 3,000 demonstrators and the nation fails to react

appropriately this will be the responsibility of the ration

RE: VASHINGTON SPRING PROJECT

On January 22, 1968, a second confidential source,

advised an SA of the FBI that a workshop to study non-violent

demonstration techhiques was'held at the Ohio State University

Student Union butlding, Columbus, Ohio, on January 20 and 21,

1968.

The second confidential source advised as Lollows:

The workshop was scheduled to be held from

10:00 a.m. to 11:00 p.m.

January 20, 1968, and from 11:00 a.m.

to 11:00 p.n., January 21, 1968.

however,

participants in

the workshop did not begin arriving for the workshop until

late in the afternoon of January 20, 1u68. There ware appromis

nately twentysix individuals present when the workshop finally

got underway.

Pat Shafer, fiely secretary of the ohio Peace

Action Council, was in charge of the workshop:

The prancipal speakers at the workshop were

Reverend Ed Randall Osburn, Cleveland, Ohio, associated with

the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC); Mike

Biblei; and James Bristol, associated with the Anerican

Friends Service Committee: (AFSC).

Reverend Osburn had driven

to the workshop from Cleveland,

ohio, with Mike Bibler, while

James Bristol had flown by airplane to Columbus, 0hi0,

from

Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

From the alternoon of January 20, 1968,

to the

conclusion of the workshop on that date, there was

non-violent demonstration techniques.

The discussions

no discussion

centered around the lashington Spring Project, being sponsored

•by the SCIC at Washington, D.C., duriug the summer of 1958.

• During thoir comments to the group, Reverend Osburn,

Bibles, and Bristol indicated they had attended

a meeting of

there Martin Luther

King and other SCLC personnel discussed the Washingion Spring

Project.

it was apparent that those three individuals had

been scheduled to atiend the workshop in the Ohio Union building

fOr

some time.

Reverend Osburn indicated the demonstration in

Washington, D. C., would be composed initially of about 3,000

people from poverty areas in the United States, including whites,

Negroes, and Puerto Ricans.

Those persons would travel to

Washington, D. C., and during the first week or ten days would

demonstrate on the issues of poverty and jobs. After that

period, the demonstration would pick up the peace issues.

demonstracors were removed by arrest on asy other reason,

they would b replaced by other porsons coming iron the same

Reverend Osburn

emphasized that it was

this would be the last chance to prove non-violent demonstrations

matiers, Reverend osburn stated II thai eilor failed, black

istionzilst groups would take over the leadorship in civil

In connection with that situation, Reverend

Osburn remarked, "Let's hope this

works".

Bibler and Bristol, in their talks to the group

attendzng the workshop, added nothing new, but supported the

siatimants made by Reverend Osburn.

The SCHY was cited as a communist front by the

The SCEF is self-described as having deep roots in

the South where tt began as tne puucational wing of the Schl,

When the SChW disbanded in the late 1940°5,

RE: WASHINGTON SPRING PROJECT

ALPHONSO WOODALL first came to the attention of

the Miami Office of the Federal Bureau of investigation on July

Il, 1967, when he telephonically advised that a group of

Negroes were meeting at the Mary Elizabeta Hotel, Miami,

Florida.

Whet contacted

on auly 3e, 1961, WOODalL displayed

newspaper clippings concerning hirseif.

These articles

indicated that in April, 1967, he picketed Dr. MARTIN

LUTHER KING In CleVElanE, ONIO.

He picketed KING because

•of KING's stand against the war in Viet Nam. It was also

indicated in the clippings that

he picketed KING because he,

WOODALL, had an18 year old son who was killed in Viet Nam

in January, 1957.

WOODALL was alsoquoted in these articles as

saying he vas

going to get STOKELY CARMICHAEL with violence

when he comes to Miami; however, CARMICHAEL BaS

never come

to Miami.

It was also indicated that he threw a brick through

the window of Congressman ADAM CLAYTON POWELL'S campaign

headquarters in New Jork City a few years ago. He hoped

to

get arrested and them expose the way POWLi was financing his

campaign for re-election to Congress. According to WOODALL,

they just repaired the window and never said anything.

When questioned concerning these articles,

wooDAll stated that he never intended to commit any act

by newspapers.

On August 2, 1967, WOODALL telechonically contacted

. the Miani Office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation ai

abour mianignt.. At this time, ne appeared

to be very upsar,

and WOODALL stated that he had heard that MARTIN LUTHER KING

vas going to come to Miami in the near luture and that he vas

going to again picket him. He indicated that this picketing

would be oi a peaceful nature.

WOODALL appears to become upset over information

concerning KING because of the death of his son in Viet Nam

and also because he has

another son currently serving in

-

the United Statas Army.

On the morning of August 4, 1967, WCODALL

telephonically contacted the Miami office,

"with Rap Brown and his commandos occupying

the place with walkie talkies and bodyguards"

• He added

that "they invaded this church and took it over. They

wouldn't let people in.!!

He said that "they" threw the

press out of the meeting and that "they walked out of the

kept SCIC Board members out. "

Rutherford

stated that he told Stokely (Carmichael) that he, Rutherford,

wanted to hear what Stokely had.to say, ana that Stokely

gave some "mealy-mouthed excuses" that did not stand up.

Rutherford also noted that he told Carmichael that "these

men told us" that they are interested in the total

destruction of the United States.

Levison commented that he had heard Stokely say

this and rutherford's comment was that "this is what

Rap (Brown) said last night"

• Rutherford continued

that stokely is now

"sweet as pie.

He pulled a power play

on us in Washington"

, but did not win anything because

everybody was opposing him.

Levison commented that he could not see the SCLC

letting ten persons who threaten violence take over from

hundreds. He described it' as a dangerous thing; a king oi

black facisi.

Rutherford, in referring to the meeting, related

that a person named

Courtland (phonetic), whom he

described

as having been with the Congress of Racial Equality, made

the statement that "they" would not support "our campaign"

in washington, D. Cos but would not participate in any

opposition to 1t

He said this is

"their whole life"

, that

although they could not take part in something they do

not believe in, even though they have trouble from their

constituents, they would not oppose it because anühing

that leads to liberation is worthwhile.

Rutherfora said that King became very upset after

this private meeting and began berating him.

He said he told

King that what "they"said is clear and that the SCLC knows

"from them" was that they would not attempt to divide

the community.

He sald "they" were honest, that "they"

stated that if the SCLC. fails in washington, "we're going

to get a'lot of new recruits! but if the SCLo is successful

"we are going to be in trouble".

He recalled that at

chis moment king made a point, that if "they" should

denounce the government, denounce the SCLC campaign and

criticize it, this would create an atmosphere within wnich

non-violence

would have a better chance of succeeding.

In the black community, and that; If they should speak

out against King or what he is doing, people will not

know which way to turn.

Levison commented that he agreed with Carmichael

and disagreed with King on this point. He inquired as to

why King was upset..

Rutherford stated that king said the enemy was

violence and began to preach on how violence begets

violence.

levison related that the key is that king states

the enemy is violence which is not true. The enemy are

the forces preventing them from getting rights and violence

Is one of the methods. He said that, therefore, they are

trying to develop a

counter technique to violence.

"The Worker"

, an East Coast Communist newspaper,

in Its issue dated February 11, 1968, page one, contains

an article on the protest against United Staves involvoment

in the war in Vietnam in Washington, D.C. on February

5,6, 1968, sponsored by the Clergy and Laymen Concerked

About Vietnam.

It states that King addressed the sathering

of clergymen

and laymen and told them that "it was imperative

that the freedom and peace movements be joined. Describing

the worsening economic conditions, he appealed to the

religious leaders to join and support the demonstrations his

organization has planned for Washington in April"

article also notes that King made it clear that the targets

of the demonstrations would be the Vietnam

As publicly described by King, the

Wor is an erfort to mobilize large numbers or persons

alleged United States Government failure to solve the

problems of the poor in this country.

RE:

WASHINGTON SPRING PROJECT

CONFIDENTIAL

Both related that the demonstrators would set

up tents on the White House Lawn, in Washington, and

that everybody who participates:should be prepared to go

to jail.

Bevel advised that the White House does not

belong to President Johnson; that it was God given to

the people.

Bevel and Abernathy advised they would remain

people.

Josephine Baker; described by source as a former

well-known entertainer, now residing in france, was also

a guest speaker.

She stated she had experienced a

difficult time getting back into this country.

She had

marched with Dr. King on his earlier march on Washington,

and as a result it

appeared she was not wanted here.

She described the importance of the tent-in on the

White House lawn, and urged all those present, to

participate.

Her remarks, according to the source, were

also received by those present with no enthusiasm, and

no apparent volunteers.

Regarding James Bevel, a second confidential

source,

who has furnished

reliable information in

-he past,

advised in March, 1966, that Bevel had

recently been present at offices of the West Side

Chicago W.E.B. Du Bois Club.

Discussion concerned

the recent notification that the Attorney General

of the United States intended to label the DuBois

Clubs as a communist front.

Bevel advised he would

have ignored this notirication, reeling that it the

DuBois Clubs have a real program of help for the

people, then the people would answer for the clubs,

despite any labels.

Most present agreed that the attack on the

DuBois Clubs was a part of the plan of the

"establishment" to undermine the civil rights

movement, only a beginning which would lead to

a full attack on the SCLC, the real target.

Reverend King commented to several SCIC officials

that in anticipation of SNCC creating problems (not explained)

for SCLC in 'implementing the WSP it might be very practical

for SCLC to organize "local. groups" in Washington, D. C., and

other communities concerned with the WSP.

The function of

these groups, he said, would be to oppose any undesirable activity

on the part or SNiCC rather than require SCLC personnel to divert

WASHINGTON SPRING PROJECT

On February s, 1968, BH I-I advised that Rev. f. L.

Shuttlesworth was to have participated in a leadership

meeting

in Washington, D. C., on february 6, 1968, regarding Rev,

M. L. King's planned

march in April,

Bu T-l said Rev, Shuttles

worth has

stated he does not l00k with favor on any coalition

between hippies, radical pacifists, draft card burners. black

power exponents and the civil rights organization because he

cannot conceive of anything short of violence taking place

when these type factions get into a demonstration.

BH T-I said Shuttlesworth recently stated, "It would

be impossible not to get the wrong people in such a march and

once violence got started you couldn't control it." According

to BH I-1, Shuttlesworth intends to raise questions about the

wisdom of

King's widely publicized Washington demonstrations

for April.

BH T-1 said Shuttlesworth feels that Rev. king will

try to find an honorable way to back down from the planned

demonstrations. Rev. Shuttlesworth said the country is in no

condition to stand

"that type of thing" but he is opposed

the Vietnam war and also to diaft card burning.

It is noted that Rev. E. L. Shuttlesworüh is president

oî the Alabana Christian Movement for Human Rights, a prom

integration organization with headquarters in Birmingham,

ALabama.

RACIAL MATTER

Reference is made to Chicago memorandum of

'Washington Spring

Project (sp), Ra lad Matter, "which in part refiected that

Martin Luther King, Jr. was, to be in Chicago on that date

where he was to appear

as a speaker for the West Side

• Organization

(WSO), a small West Side Civil Rights group

in Chicago.

On February 5, 1968, a confidential source,

which collects intelligence information in the Chicago area,

advised that Dr. Martin Luther king, Jr.s President, southern

Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC), headquartered in

Atlanta, Georgia, had arrived in Chicago at 11:20 a.m. on this

"date irum Atlanta, via Delta Airlines Flight 614. King was

accompanied by SCLC officers, Reverend Andrew Young and

Reverend Ralph Abernathy.

A second confidential source, who has furnished

reliable information in the past, advised on February 5, 1968,

This document contains neither recommendations

nor conclusions of the

FBI. It is the property

of the FBI and is loaned to your agency; it and

MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR.

• POSSIBLE RACIAL INCIDENTS

DURING DEMOCRATIC CONVENTION,

INTERNATIONAL AMPHITHEATRE,

CHICAGO, ILLINOIS,

AUGUST, 1968

that King was in Chicago at this time generally to provide

impetus to the local organizing efforts in behalf of the

WSP, a program whereby the SCLC plans to mobilize large

numbers of persons in Washington, D.C.

during April, 1968,

to protest United States Government failures to solve the

problems distie poor.

In this connection King reportedly planned to met with

Georger Wiley, believed to be from New York City, and who is

head of the National Welfare Rights Organization (NWRO) . The

NWRO is currently holding a three day convention in Chicago.

According to this source, Wiley was at a recent

meeting in New York City, New York,

where support for the

WSP was solicited by SCLC personnel; however, Wiley would

not

agree to participate in this SCLC project.

King's contact

with Wiley in Chicago, therefore, will represent an effort

to

persuade him of the importance of lending his support to the

WSP.

This source,

King has no known public appearances scheduled while in

Chicago other than a press conterence to be held sometime

during the late alternoon or evening of this date,

king is

also not known to have any meetings scheduled with the local

SCLC staif; however, it was expected that in all probability

"he would meet individually with sone key local personnel

in connection with the WSP.

No information was available to either of the

above sources concerning King's departure plans from Chicago,

although it was anticipated he would depart Chicago during

the late evening hours of February 5, 1968, or early on

February 6, 1968.

RACIAL MATTER

This meeting was presided over by King who restated

what he had said in the meeting mentioned earlier.

In addi -

tion, he said there were people in the audience who did not agree

with the planned US? and asked that these people not hinder

the project even though they were noü in agreement.

King reminisced about past demonstrations and projects

of the SCIC and their effect.

Doctor King advised they expected approximately

3,000 persons to come to DC for the WS?. They plan to camp

on the Washington Honument or the Lincoln Memorial grounds.

They fully expect to be asked to move and when this is done

it will draw desired attention to themselves and their cause.

No mention of militancy or civil disobedience was made and

King indicated they would move their camp when asked to do so.

• King indicated there would be similar demonstrations

in other cities during the same period of time as the WSP. He

did not identily these cities.

An announcement was made of a mass neeting of the

SCIC at the Vermont Avenue Baptist Church, 1630 Vermont

Avenue, N. W., NDC, on February 7, 1968.

ENTIAL

The discussion in this conference began with the

subject of Inancing the WSP. Also discussed were the merits

of having Martin Luther King

make-a speech during the WSt.

Stokely Carmichael stated that he is in favor of the goals

and aims of the WSP and that he would support this project

wholeheartedly.

However, he insisted thai his organization,

SNCC, and any other organization which would take part in

this

project, would keep their own identity separate from

SCLC.

This was agreed to by the representatives of SCLC.

During the above discussion, George Wiley entered

the room in which the conference was being held, and after

listening to the conversation, stated that his

organization,

the

National Welfare of Rights Oganization, could not support

and participate with SCLC in this project under the conditions

stated. A considerable time was then

spent in an effort to

convince Wiley to support

this project,

however, he stated

that before agreeing to give his support, it would be necessary

that he discuss this matter personally with Martin Luther King,

President of SCLC.

A copy of this communication is being provided

to the following local agencies:

United States Attorney, Chicago, Illinois;

United States Secret Service, Chicago, Illinois; and

Region I, I13th Military Intelligence Group,

Washington Spring Project

Racial Matters

A confidential source, who has furnished reliable

intormation in the past, learned on January 31, 1900, that or

that date, Stanley. Levison was in contact with willian

Rutherford, Executive Director of the Southern Christian

Leadership

Conference (SCLC). Levison noted that he net

recently with Harry Wachtel,

Clarence Jones, Bayard Rustin,

and Mike Harrington, and that Rustin "showed his true

colors" by opposing civil disobedience.

He said Rustin is

also opposed to involving the war issue.

Levison, in referring to the civil disobedience

campaign, planned by King, for Washington D.C. (WDC), in the

Spring of 1960, felt that

tactics must be agreed upon in the

near future so

that persons who have been making inquiry can

be told what tactics will be used.

Rutherford told Levison

i that Andy Young (Executive

Vice-president of the schC), had written out some of the

-tactics to be used.

He said that, for example,during the

first week, calls will be made on

Congressman by people from

• 17 different areas, During the second week, calls will be

made on heads of departments such as the Secretary of Labor.

On the first visit, demands will be made and on the second,

a sit-in will be conducted.

With respect to a proposed civil rights newspaper,

Levison feels it should follow the formula of "The Southern

Courier"

, which, he said, can numanize the news without

vulgarizing it.

He emphasized that, although SCLC policy

must be the policy followed by the newspaper, efforts must

be made to avoid a dull, uninteresting style.

• Rutherford noted that King has an SCLC Board meeting.

on tuesday, and Wednesday, (february 6 and 7, 1900), a

clergy march on Monday, and a private meeting with (Stokely)

• Rútherford

added "meet once with the ministers and once with the Black

Power people to try to neutralize them'.

The source advised that he gathered the impression

*that the above described activity by King will be in connection

with organizing for the spring civil disobedience campaign •

in WDC.

Levison and Rutherford also discussed financial

contributors to the SCLC. Levison said he had suggested to

King

that they get about 25 contributors together and meet

with them for several days and let them ask King as many

questions as they care to. Levison stated that he would check

the list of contributors

and check with Rutherford as to

where they should hold this meeting since it should depend

on the residence of most of the contributors.

A confidential source, who has furnished

reliable information in the past, advised

in April, 1964, that Stanley Levison was

RE:

WASHINCTON SPRING PROJECT

On January 26, 1968, Confidential Informant T-1

advised that the weekly meeting of the Alabama Christian

Movement for Human Rights (ACMHR) was held on January 22,

1968, at

St. Luke's AME Zion Church, 3937 12th Avenue North,

Birmingham.

Albert Turner, Field Secretary, State Of

Alabama, for the Southern Christian Leadership Conference

(SCIC) made a speech to the two hundred persons who were

in attendance:

Confidential Informant T-1 stated that Albert

Turher made a plea for 300 Alabamians to prepare to go to

Washington to take part in the Washington. Spring Project

this April. Turner said that Negroes must join in with

*Dr. King because the SCLC is at a very low ebb and in danger

of a takeover by Black

that he came to Birmingham from Detroit where violent forces:

claim that last summer's burnings were small compared to what

they plan to do this summer.

Turner said that if these forces

try to destroy Detroit, that the entire Civil Rights movement

will be lost and the leaders killed or put in jail. Turner

told the group that Rev. M. L. King, Jr's. program

of civil

• disobedience does not call for lying down'in the streets but.

merely "sitting in." However, Turner stated that participants

should be ready to be jailed.

Confidential Informant I-l advised in conclusion

that Albert Turner indicated that in the near future, Rev.

M. L. King, Jr., will hold a state-wide meeting in Birmingham

in support of the Washington Spring Project.

• HASHINGION SPRING

PROJECT (WSP)

All sources used in this communication have

furnished reliable information in the past.

CV I-l advised on December 3, 1967 that he

recently learned that during the week commencing

November 27, 1907 the Southern Christian Leadership

Conference (SCLC) held a retreat at Penn Center, crognore,

south Carolina, which was presided over by Rev.

'MARTIN

LUTHER KING, JR., President of SCLC and was attended

by approximately 70 individuals comprising the headquarters

and field staft of SCIC.

The primary purpose of the retreat was to discuss

_various facets of SCLo's plan to conduct massive non-

violent demonstrations in Washington, D. C. and possibly

a number of other cities during the early part of 1968.

Reverend KING outlined

this plan to those attending

the retreat; namely, that it had

been tentatively decided

that in the forepart of February, 1968, he, together with

other officers of scle and in all probabillty leading

representatives of other Civil Rights organizations

(not

identified) would personally present to the Secretary of

Labor specific reguests for prompt Congressional action

pertaining to employment, income, housing, education,

and

other matters which constitute major probiens experienced

by ghetto people. In the event these requests do not

receive an inmediate unequivocal commitment insuring

prompt Congressional action, an immediate massive non-

violent demonstration would commence in Washington, D. C.

This demonstration would be conducted by yoIc and involve

including students -and

adults from all walk an errort is made by civil and/or

school children.

military authorities to quell this demonstration, simultaneous

demonstrations of identical magnitude would comrence in

10-15 "target cities" throughout the nation.

RE:

WASHINGION SPRING PROJECI (WSP)

CV. I-l was not aware of the identity of all the

"target cities" referred to by Rev. KING but he understood

Cleveland was one of the cities included.

CV T-1 went on that according to Rev. KING that

during the period prior to early February, 1968, one of

two SCLC staff members would be assigned to Washington,

D. C. änd. each of the "target cities."

It will be the

responsibility of these members to select in each community

up

to 200 individuals who will serve as leaders for

demonstrations.

This type of individual sought will be

unemployed Negro males, whose general economic status is so

low that they could lose nothing by participating in the

proposed demonstrations. After selection of these individuals

it would then be the responsibility of the SCLe staff member

through mass meetings, workshops or other procedures to

indoctrinate these individuals with SCIC's overall

objectives and technique, of non-violent demonstration. :

• Rev.-KING emphasized that the individuals

so selected

a should be Negroes, however, he said once each demonstration

is actually commenced the assistance of white peraons

would definitely be accepted and possibly solicited.

Reverend KING acknowledged this program of

demonstrations was a very substantial undertaking for SCLE

to embark upon.

He said it was imperative that SCLC be

successful in

this undertaking because otherwise not only

would it be embarrassed by a failure but failure

itself

would in a

large sense serve as a victory for the

"Black

Power"

groups.

In this connection, he ssid it would be

necessary to solicit the cooperation of "Black Power"

Leaders (not identified) in order that such organizations

would permit SCLO to conduct its program without inter-

ference.

He said he was extremely concerned over the

probability that such interference might easily turn any

denonstration into a riot. He declared that if such

situation developed in any one of the communities

in which

SCLC contemplates damonstrating SCIC will immediately

cease all its activity in that conmunity.

During the retreat an appreciable number of

SCLO staff members expressed doubt that the cooperation

RE:

of the "Black Power" organizations could be obtained and

raised a question as to whether the selection of up to

200 individuals in various communities might not present

a most difficult task. Reverend KING responded by stating

he was most confident he could obtain the desired cooperation

of "Black Power" leaders.

He said he realized these people

did not agree with his methods or the activities of SCLC

but is confident they have sufficient respect for him to

listen to his requests:

He also said he was. quite confident

that people, after being apprised of scLe's objectives,

will be anxious to assist.

Furthermore, he expressed optimism

that once the demonstrations commence there will be sufficient

sympathy on the part of the general public that SCLC will

will receive adequate financial support.

CV T-1 subsequently learned that Rev. KING had

informed SCLC. staff members that this new activity would

be called Washington Spring Project.

CV T-1 also advised on December 19: I967 that

he recently learned that varlous assignments

had been

made of SCLC members to various, cities in the United

States in connection with the forthcoming WSP and the

OV I-2 mentioned in January, 1968 that he learned

Atlanta, Georgia,

for the purpose

of discussing and planning

strategy regarding SCIC's WSP which it contemplated

initiating in early April, 1968.

At one of the sessions it was mentioned that in all

probability Congress would not accept or act on the

demand presented by SCLC.

If this happens, it was then

planned

to bogin protesting this refusal by means of

aisrupting various agencies and facilities throughout

Washington. D. C. for example one group was tentatively

scheduled to tie up

the Washington Greyhound Bus Station

utillring such tactics as lying down in front si buses,

blocking entences and exits, etc. It was expected that

numerous arrests would be made of

the participants of this

srojret and 1t ves vointed out that the participents must

be

"totally committed" to the project and be willing to

risk arrest. It is even possible that some persons may

be killed and the participants must be prepared to spend

up to six months in jail; however,

on January 17, 1960, CV T-I also furnished "

Information regarding the SCLC conference held at Atlanta,

Georgia from January 15-17, 1968; source added that during

the conference, Rev. KING said there was no doubt that

the requests that would be presented to the various

government agencies would receive a non-committal type

response.

Then 200 demonstrators previously recruited by

SCLO in approximately 15 communities will then commence

& massive non-violent demonstration in Washington, D. C.

In conjunction with the activity of the

approximately 3000 demonstrators in Washington, D. C.,

SCIC contemplates that in each community from which these

demonstrators come there will be sympathetic simultaneous

demonstrations.

These demonstrations will be participated

in by individuals who do not go to Washington, D. C. but

experience the same problems and seek the same solutios

the demonstrators in Washington.

SCIC intends that the

demonstrators will not be intimidated in their efforts

by injunctions or other legal measures designed to serve

as deterrents.

The demonstrators will submit to arrest and

incarceration without bail, however, the place of an incar-

cerated demonstrator will be assumed by another demonstrator.

Rev. KING felt the WSP Hould produce affirmative action

promptly on the part of Congress regarding jobs or income

for Negroes.

moved to other citles throughout the country.

CV T-1 had also learned that Rev. OSBURN had

been out of town for some time as he had been attenäing

an SCIC conference in Atlanta along with 150 other people

but that OSPURN returned to Cleveland on January 18, 1963.

OSBURN mentioned on his return thathe would have to get the

"ball rolling" in Caveland on the WSP indicating that

nothing had been done as of January 18, 1968 to organize

this project.

SCIC conference in Atlanta on January 15-17, 1968, he

returned to Cleveland but

then made another visit

Atlants. for additional instructions regarding Cleveland'e

Dole in the WSP.

On returning agsin to Cleveland, Rev.

OSBURN indicated that his organization now planned to

recruit approximately 200 distressed people in the ghetto

area of Civeland to participate in the WSP in washington,

D. C.

These people who will be unemployed and have nothing

to lose would

not have the funds to make this trip or to

stay in Washington, D. C. but SCLC will make money available

to them. Rev. OSBURN went on that he planned to open a

storefront orfice at E. 79th and Hough area, Cleveland,

Ohio, on January 26, 1968, which is in the heart of the

most depressed area

of Cleveland and the center of the

flough arra

VASHINGTON SPRING PROJECT

RACIAL MATTER

-

On vanuary I1, 1968, a confidential source,

advised he had learned that the Southern Christiar

Leadership Conference (SCIC) on that date concluded

a retreat which was held January 15, 1958 -

January 17, 1968, at the Ebenezer Baptist Church,

Atlanta,

Georgia,

of which Church Reverend Martin

Luther King, Jx., President, SCLC, serves as co-pastor.

This retreat was concerned

with SCLC's Washington

Spring Project (VSP) Thich it contenplates initiating

carly in April 1968. In ationdance were approximately

50 individuals, about one-half of

ThON

were SCIC field

representatives fron various locations.

Reverend King pointed out he did not have

any desire that SCLC should have any friction with

"Black Power groups" during the course of its ₩SP.

He said the basic issue of the ISP was jobs or income

and the validity of this issue could not be argued by

"Black Power groups" or anyone else.

He said SCIC

would simply go about its business

of inplementing

the WSP.

Reverend King declared that in the event:

SCIC is not successiul awakening the

• conscience of the

nation to the urgent need for jobs or income through

be no question that the "Black Power groups" would benefit

appreciably. .
