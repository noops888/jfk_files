RACIAL MATTER

On April 1, 1968, a confidential source advised
he understood that following the racial disturbance which
occurred in Memphis, Tennessee, on March 28, 1968, Reverend
Martin Luther King, Jy., President, Southern Christian
Leadership Conference (SCLC) called a meeting of several
SCLC Executive officers which was held March 30, 1968, at
the Ebenezer Baptist Church, Atlanta. Among those attending
this meeting were James Bevel, SCLC Executive Staff member;
Jesse Jackson, Northern Director, Project Breadbasket, SCLC;
Hosea Williams, Director of Voter Registration and Political
Education, SCLC; and Stanley Levison.

Reverend King arranged this meeting for the purpose
of reviewing the recent disturbance in Memphis and evaluating
the effect thereof upon SCLO's contemplated Washington Spring
Project (WSP). Reverend King opened this meeting by again
stressing to those present how greatly concerned he was as to
the effect of the Memphis disturbance on his image as a civil
rights leader and the position of SCLC as a leading civil rights
organization. This entire matter apparently upset Reverend King
to the extent he found it desirable to excuse himself from this
meeting shortly after its commencement. Source was unable to .
advise whether Reverend King returned to the meeting. }

This meeting lasted most of the day and concluded with

2 decision on the part of those present that SCLC officials would
- immediately return to Memphis, re-organize the striking Sanitation

‘ A confidential source, who has furnished reliable
‘information in the past, learned on March 29, 1968, that on that
date, Stanley Levison and Martin Luther King, Jr. discussed
the position which King has found himself in as a result of the
violence that occurred in Memphis, Tennessee, on March 28, 1968,
at’ the time when King led a march through downtown Memphis. King
told Levison that he feels they have to face the fact that,
from a public relations point of view and every other way, "we
are in serious trouble", He referred to the Washington D.C.
Spring campaign, known as the Poor People's Campaign, and said
“as far as it is concerned it is in trouble. King noted that it
will be much more difficult to recruit people for the Washington
campaign now because they (the Southern Christian Leadership
Conference)(SCLC) are recruiting non-violent people and these
people will hold back if they think they<Will be in a campaign
that is going to be taken over by violent elements. King stated
that this is not a failure for the SCLC because it has enough
of a program to affirm its position but that it is a personal
setback for himself. 2

King continued that persons such as Roy Wilkens

7 (Head of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored
People) and Adam Clayton Powell, and Negroes who are influenced

by the press, will now feel that he, King, is finished, that his
non-violence is nothing, that no one is listening to it, King

reiterated that they have had a great public relations setback as

at far as his image and leadership are concerned. : .

‘Martin tuther King, dr.

Levison attempted to dissuade King. from this point
of view stating that it would be true only if King accepts "their"

. @efinition. He added that he felt it is a profound error King 7 ¢
_ is making.. i . a

King noted that he did not accept it himself but that
others will. Levison retorted that people would accept it for
a: ‘Tew days, but, if events prove otherwise, will not accept it.

King noted that events will not prove otherwise unless :

7 they think soberly through this period. He said that somehow he had

to reaffirm what the press will refuse to affirm. He referred to
the Memphis incident stating that they all know it was just a.

few people who were involved. He added that it was.a failure —

of the leadership in Memphis. King informed Levison that persons
who were responsible for the violence came to see him on the morning
of March 29, 1968. He said these persons were fighting the ~
leadership in Memphis, the men who ignored and neglected them, the
men who would not give them any attention, who ordered their
telephones cut off. King added that he had no knowledge of all this,
that the’ persons responsible for the Violence were too sick.to see

‘that what they were doing during the violence was hur ting him, King,
more than it could hurt the local preachers.

King. related that he was so upset and shocked over
Memphis violence that he was going to announce a personal fa
as a means of appealing to the Memphis leadership, as well as - se
who participated in the violence, to come to him in a Lsieapi
front to take up the "cudget" and get on with the movement;
He said he felt this kind of spiritual move would be a way ot
unifying the movement, of transforming a minus into a plus.
added that he feels their Washington campaign is doomed. :

Jump out, do something, and then come back to hide within
the group. King said he is a symbol of non-violence and

that the press is not going to say what Levison said. He
said the symbol will be weakened and it will put many Negroes
in doubt. He said he must do something that is a powerful
act to unify forces and refute the press.

: Levison stated that if it had this result he would
agree but that he is bothered by the idea that King would be
accepting the progic of the press, that if King can control 99%,
and not the 1% who are violent, he is a failure. He said they
must find « way in which they do not accept this otherwise King
will never be able to do anything unless he always spiritually
reaches a level where he hypnotizes every Negro alive.

King questioned how he could say that they can
control the planned demonstrations in Washington,D.C. and at the
same time conclude they are going to have 1% violence.

Levison counseled that King can say that. he can control
‘his followers and is not undertaking to control everybody else.
He said King could take the position that his followers are non-
violent and will do what they must do. moe

They agreed to discuss the matter in depthat a meeting
- in Atlanta, egoreia in King's church office on the morning a
March 30, 1968.

The same source advised on March 31, 1968, that on
‘that date Stanley Levison commented on the meeting held in Atlanta,
Georgia, on March 30, 1968. lLevison's comments included the
following:

At the Atlanta meeting they examined the whole Memphis

incident and came up with a new approach. “We are going back to
Memphis. We are going to prove that. you can have mass a¢tion
in the streets". Martin Luther King had decided not to go

back to Memphis and not to go to Washington (for the Poor People's
Campaign). It was the determination of the (Sec) staff that

-3-



Martin Luther King, Jr.

changed King's thinking. King is going back to Memphis

on Tuesday (April 2, 1968) and there will be a big march on

Friday (foril 5, 1968). The Memphis incident was caused by

"a handful of kids" and it could have been Se by "our
Fi guys" (the SCLC) had they been there,

7 | He, Levison, made the point that they could not let
"a couple of kids" keep "mass action" from being their weapon.
: As for controlling the Washington, D.C. demonstrations,
King knows he can control the youth. What has to be done is
go to the high schools and tell them what the establishment:
wants them to do. Once they grasp this there is no chance of
anything happening. What they (the SCLC) are afraid of in
Washington is a double cross from Stokley Carmichael and the
answer to that is that "our job" (the SCLC") is wnot to stop violence
but to be non-violent themselves. "Our position" is that. "we".
are going to go on because to be able to march inthe streets is
“our most important tool" and are not going on the streets because
it may start violence, "Why do we have to be afraid of riots’.
it is their problem not ours" 7 J

: The Atlanta meeting was good because it -shows how
much militancy there is in the SCLC.

A confidential source, who has furnished
reliable information in the past, advised
in April, 1964, that Stanley Levison was
a secret member of the Communist Party,

MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR.
SECURITY MATTER - C

WASHINGTON SPRING PROJECT
RACIAL -MATTER

On March 28, 1968, a confidential source , advised that
during the morning of that date Reverend Martin luther King,
Jv., President, Southern Christian Leadership Conference {SCLC) ,
participated in a march in Memphis, Tennessee, conducted by
sanitation workers who are currently on strike in that community.
During this march, incidents of violence were engaged in by a
relatively small group of Negroes.

With reference to the above incidents, it was the
opinion on March 28, 1968, of Reverend King; Ralph D. Abernathy,
Vice President and Treasurer, SCLC; Bernard Lee, Special Aide.
to the President, SCLC; and Hesea Williams, Director of Voter
Registration and Political Education, SCLC, that those responsible
therefor were in no way connected with SCLC but rather represented
@ minority who obviously are neitker in sympathy with Reverend

: King ner SCLC. Reverend King and his colleagues did not know the
identities of these individuals but suspected they might possibly
be coanected with some “black power" organization.

Because of the disturbance in Memphis on March “28, 1968,
Reverend King became extremely dejected and discouraged as to the
prospects fer success of SCLC's contemplated Washington Spring
Broject (WSP). Reverend King told his colleagues on this date
that because of his participation in the Memphis march, the
disturbance which developed, and the ensuing publicity he was
gravely fearful that his image and that of SCLC as advocates of
nouviolence will be blemished.

Subscribing to the thought that those responsible
for the aforementioned disturbance might represent some
"black power" organization, Abernathy, Lee,and Williams on
March 28, 1968, were extremely apprehensive for the personal
safety of Reverend King, particularly in the event he should
in the near future appear publicly in connection with activity
by the striking sanitation workers in Memphis.

Martin Luther King, Jr.
Security Matter - <4

A confidential source, who has furnished reliable
information in the past, learned on March 28, 1968, that,
late on that date, Stanley Levison and Martin Luther King, Jr.
discussed the violence that occurred in Memphis, Tennessee
on March 28, 1968, following King's leadership of a protest -
march through downtown Memphis. King indicated that he has
become so depressed over the developments in Memphis that
he has considered calling off the Washington March (his
self-described Poor People's Campaign, scheduled to begin in
Washington, D.C. on April 22, 1968).

Levison told King that his depression was aggravated
because he is physically exhausted as a result of his recent
strenuous program. He counseled King not to be on the defensive :
over the events in Memphis but, on the contrary, should take }
the position that the majority of people in the Memphis March
aid not join in the rioting that took place, proving the 7
effectiveness of King's leadership and his policy of non-violence.
Levison emphasized that the Washington March will be different
in that King will have organized this march and his forces can
stress the importance of non-violence. Levison suggested that
Saturday morning (March 30, 1968) would be a better time to
meet in Atlanta to discuss the Memphis incident rather than
meeting on Friday night (March 29, 1968) because it will give
King time to rest. '

for nine single rooms for the night of March 22, 1968 at
the Holiday Inn, Savannah,- Georgia.

On March 23, 1968, a second source advised that
Rev. King failed to appear the previous evening at Savannah

SCLC, came from Atlanta and spoke to a crowd of about 500

.his requests to Congress. They further announced that late in
“April or early May, 1968, they expect three thousand demonstrators

WASHINGTON — Southern
House Members may have a
inew problem in trying to delay
consideration of the Senate civil
rights bill until Dr. Martin Lu-
ther King and his demonstra-
tors arrive here April 22.

There is serious talk now the
Negro leader might be forced
to postpone his poor peoples
march until some time in May
because the response to the|
‘demonstration has been less
ityan anticipated.

This ironic possibility buoys

“the House Democratic leader-
\thip which has been urging
members to accept the measure
“without any debate or hearings’
and send it to the White House:
for the President’s signature.

The feeling of the proponents
is that if the Senate civil rights
protection and open housing leg-
‘islation is approved be.ore King
arrives, some of the sting will
hg taken out of his campaign.

However, on the other hand,
the Dixie Bloc believes it can
kill the bill by holding the
measure. out until the march
begins. Southern contention
members will refuse to act un”
der threat of intimidation.

With word leaking out King’
may have to postpone the,

Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.,

head of the Southern Christian} ;,

adership Conference, will vis-

iy Columbia April 3 as part of

extensive tour of Southeas-|
fern and Northern states.

Al Pertilla, a spokesman for

King’s Atlanta, Ga., headquar-|
ters said, “exact times® and
places (King’s visit) are not
known yet, As of this time,
however, he will visit- Colum-
bia.”
, King is making the tour in
connection with the S.C.L,C.’s
‘Poor People’s Campaign. He
will visit-‘several locstions in
South Carolia and will make’
two of three speeches.

The speeches will be open to
the public, seid Pertilla. King

will speak to people in poverty
areas as part of a campaign to
dramatize the plight of some!
three million low income people
in the U. S.

Organizers of the Poor Peo-
ples Campaign ‘say that King
hopes to slowly increase pres-
sure on the federal government
for aid to poor people. His pri-
mary method will be the use of|
sit-ins and-marches. ,

‘The current tour will culmi-
wate in a massive march in!
Washington on April 22. The
march, King said, in December
is aimed at forcing Congress
and the administeation to pro-
vide “jobs or income for all.”

King said an initial force of
3,000 demonstrators, trained in|
nonviolent techniques, would)
seek “massive dislocation” of|
the capital “until America res-|

indicated, that the capitol and
the White House

The civil rights leader aj:|
knowledged that, the mood ¢f

PROGRESS REPORT. i:

As of 3-26-68, Rev. E, RANDEL OSBURN and MICHAEL BIBLER,
the two WSP recruiters in CY, have been continuing their recruiting
activity and giving owt WSP posters end pemphlets. Rev. OSBURN
is still very enthusiastic and full of spirit regarding this poor
peoples cempesn and he feels he should be able to reach his 200
“people quota to make this 4.68 trip to Washington, D. C. AS of -
3-26-68, it was known OSBURW had not reczuited his 200 people, but
there is no indication as to the number he has recruited.

Rev. MARTIN LUTHER KING is scheduled to be in C¥ on
410-68 in cemmection with the WSP and it is felt that OSBURN
and BIBLER are pushing hard to have a number of recruits by the
time KING arrives here, so they can make a favorable report.
No deinite appreisal can be made at this time, as to the possible
_ suecess the ¥SP will have in CY as Rev. OSBURN has not released
any recruitment figures as yt.

Government has many programs but nothing has been done." He

nation is involved ina "senseless, reckless, immoral and
unwinnable war." He also indicated white racism is "still a
glaring reality in our country" and that Congress, dominated
by the rural South "stands as a stubborn force in the way of
social progress." :

and views of the individuals mentioned herein. These
pertained to the racial situation as it existed at the time Soret i
the comments and views were expressed. The possibility
exists that the racial situation in any particular area in q

in the ghetto areas in Washington, D. C., have advised as y
follows:

The racial situation is very uncertain. People
are apprehensive about Dr. Martin Luther King's “poor
people's campaign" which he plans to bring to Washington, |

~D- C. (WDC) in April, 1968. Some believe the demonstration i
will be beneficial and will show the underprivileged that
efforts are being expended in their behalf. A riot could
nappen over some unexpected incident as has happened in other
large cities. Stokely Carmichael urged a gathering of -.
people in WDC, on March 17, 1968, to arm themselves and that
every black man in the United States should get a gun, Some

people in WDC are not in sympathy with Dr. King's demonst=
ration plans. WDC leaders are attempting to evaluate the
potential of Dr. King’s impact on WDC, in April. Howard
University students began a sit-in at Howard University on
March 19, 1968, protesting possible disciplinary actions
against Students involved in previous disruptive action

on the campus. \

III, “CURRENT EVALUATION: OF VIOLENCE POTENTIAL

‘Source number one who lives in the Northeast and
works in the Northwest sections of WDC, advised as follows
on March 11, 1968: : i

The racial situation in WDC appears to be very.
uncertain. Nobody knows what is going to happen in WDC
and many people are scared. They are not sure what will
happen when Dr. Martin Luther King's "poor people's campaign"
begins in April, ven though Dr. King has asked the
militants to stay out of the activities, there is no
assurance the request will be honored.

The March 11, 1968, issue of the "Newsweek"

: magazine, page 45 contained a paragraph captioned "Washington",

It stated Washington had never been considered to be a 7
major racial tinderbox as much of its Negro population works
‘for the Federal government and is insulated by civil service
security from the worst chills of black despair. It stated
Washington was facing the summer with nervous unceftainty,
«and Dr. King was bringing 3000 demonstrators to Washington

to begin a summer-long campaign of picketing and marching

for jobs and income.

The March 12, 1968 issue of "The Evening Star",
a daily WDC newspaper, page B-1 reported that District

- Safety Director Patrick V. Murphy had said the Washington
police hoped to train as many as 2,800 volunteers for
emergency duty this summer in an enlarged "Police Reserver,

“ Corps". Most of them would be used for station duty and
thus free additional policemen during emergencies.

The March 12, 1968 issue of "Washington Afro-American",
a Washington, D. C. newspaper, page 12, reported that The
National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders had said
that “Abrasive relationships between police and non-whites
have been a major source of rioting in the racial ghettos
of American cities", : : i oa
On March 14, 1968, source number two who works
in the ghettos of WDC and is acquainted with many of the
_under privileged advised as follows:

The “poor people's campaign which is a demonstra—
tion being planned by Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. has been
given the support of a number of the larger religious groups 7 :
in WBC. The demonstration will show the underprivileged |

|

that much effort is being expended in efforts to’improve eee
their life. It is believed the demonstration will be

beneficial, Plans are being made to have volunteers from

among the demonstrators, who will agree to be arrested if

necessary. It is not believed that any racial trouble will

result from the demonstration.

Source number two further advised as follows:

Stokely Carmichael is in Washington, D. C. and has
organized the Black United Front, (BUF), but it is not
believed that Carmichael will have much support from BUF
qmembers if Carmichael decides to create violence in WDC. The
“majority of the BUF members are not expected to support
any plans for racial violence.

: On March 14, 1968, source number three who resides
in the Northwest section of WDC advised as follows:

It is his belief that a riot could take place. in
WDC over some unexpected incident such as the arrest of a Negro.
This has happened in the past in other large cities. Other
than the above situation, the conditions are such that the
source is optimistic about a riot-free summer in WDC.

WASHINGTON, D. C. :

Source number four who resides ‘and works in the
ghetto areas of Northwest WDC, advised as follows on
March: 18, 1968: . ‘

On March 17, 1968, Stokely Carmichael gave a talk
at The Church of The Redeemer, 15th and Girard Streets,

N. E., WDC at the invitation of the Fellowship Forum of the
church, Among other things, Carmichael said the black people
in the United States must connect with the 900 million black
peopie of the "third world" to liberate themselves from the
control of the white man, He described the "third world" as
including the black people of Cuba, West Indies, Haiti,

South America and Africa. He said the United States is
planning genocide against the Negroes and for this reason
Negroes should arm themselves. He said he did not mean a
.22.caliber either. He advocated that every black man in the
United States get a gun. He stated that if Negroes obtained
an arsenal, relations between whites and blacks would be equal.

Source number four further stated as follows:

Carmichael said he realized many black
people do not agree with his idwlogy and that there are many
- "Uncle Toms" in the community. Carmichael said his group
proposes that if they develop information about a person
“being that. way, someone will talk to that person and
attempt to change his mind and "if he does not change his
ways, he will be considered a traitor to his community and all
traitors die". Carmichael said black people should support
the Arabs in any conflict between the Arabs and the Israelis.
“He said the WDC Public School System is 93% Negro and the
curriculum must be changed to be more relative to the Negro
community. .

The March 18, 1968, - issue of "The Washington
Post and Times Herald", newspaper on page B-3 reported that
Stokely Carmichael had spoken to a racially mixed audience
oa March 17, 1968 at The Church of The Redeemer, WDC. Among
Carmichael's comments to the group were "We are advocating
simply that every black man in this country should get a
gun, The only reason the honkie (white man) is able to rule

is because he has 2 gun". aoe ea 7

WASHINGTON, D. C.

The March 18, 1968 issue of "The Evening Star",
a daily WDC newspaper on page B-3, reported that the District
chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of
Colored People had voted to support the goals of the Reverend
Dr. Martin Luther King's "Poor People's Campaign".

Source number five who lives and works in the
Northwest section of WDC, on March 18, 1968, advised as
follows:

It is believed there are some individuals in WDC
who may be inclined toward the creation of racial trouble
in WDC, but these are not likely to initiate any actions
toward the starting of trouble. The feeling among many in the
Northwest ghetto is that in order for the "poor people's
campaign" to be successful, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.
will have to bring in outsiders for his reported "civil
disobedience" in WDC. In the event large numbers of outsiders
are brought in, their behavior will be very difficult to
control, Therefore anything may happen.

Source number one further advised as follows on
‘March 18, 1968:

In the Northeast area near the source's residence,
there has been a lack of enthusiasm by the WDC citizens for
Dr. King's "poor peoples campaign". These people are not in
sympathy with Dr. King's plans as they fail to see that any
benefits may result from any demonstration involving civil

«disobedience,

Source number six who resides in Northwest WDC
and is employed in 4 Northwest ghetto area, advised as
follows on March 18, 1968;

The foremost concern of people in WDC is the unknown
potential for racial trouble which could take place when Dr.
Martin Luther King and his “poor people's campaign" begins
in WDC in April 1968. Many leaders of organizations in WDC
are attempting to evaluate the current and future potential
oz Dr. King's impact on the racial scene of WDC. These
leaders are very concerned and are trying to determiné what
response WDC citizens may give Dr. King.

Source number seven who resides in the Northeast

as follows on March 19, 1968:

On March 19, 1968 at about 1:30 PM about fifty to
seventy-five students began a sit-in in the lobby of the
Administration Building, at Howard University to protest
possible disciplinary action against students who had
participated in previous disruptive activity on the campus.

_On March 19, 1968, Sergeant Silas Vaughn, Intelligence
Division, Metropolitan Police Department, advised that at
about 4:45 PM, on March 19, 1968, approximately one hundred
and fifty students were engaging in a sit-in in thé Adminis-
tration Building, Howard University and planned to remain all
night. According to Sergeant Vaughn, Stokely Carmichael
appeared briefly at the building, but did not participate in
the sit-in and then departed.

THEFTS OF GUNS AND AMMUNITION

Source number eight who is employed in the North
west section of WDC, on March 18 and 19, 1968 advised as
, Zollows:

The source has received at least 50 or more handguns
of various types including automatic pistols, snub-nosed
weapons and weapons with a long barrel, from an individual
employed in WDC, The guns have been obtained from the Fall -
of 1967 to the present time, These were stolen guns.

mo A confidential source, wno has furnished reliable
information in the past, advised on March 19, 1963, that on that
date Stanley Levison contacted Harry Wachtel. Levison, referring
to Martin Luther King's Washington, D.C. spring campaign, told
Wachtel that the National Committee for a Sane Nuclear Policy
passed a generalized resolution on the (Vietnam) war and
specifically endorsed the Washington campaign. He added that
Tudja Crowder, whom he described as the new Executive Director
of Sane, had contacted him and wanted to have a meeting on March 20,
1968, with a small group of the Sane Directors to have them
briefed by someone from the Southern Christian Leadership Conference
(SCLC) ‘to see how they can tie in. Levison felt this was important
and said that, if there is an element of the peace movement they
might get to join "this" (the Washington Project), it will be
Sane. 7
. . Levison-also mentioned that the Washington Jewish
Community Council had endorsed the Washington Spring Campaign
because Andrew Young, the Executive Vice President of the SCLC,
had told them that the SCLC would notify the Police on anything
they did. Levison questioned how Young could have promised this
since he and Young had discussed how the building of "shanty towns"

He added that a person who had attended a non-black minority
conference (the 53 non -Negro minority group organizations,
representatives from which met in Atlanta, Georgia, March 14,
1968, with Martin Luther King to plan for King's "Poor People's
Campaign" campaign in Washington, D.C.) stated that "they"
specifically said "they" were not going to notify the Police.
Levison, apparently alluding to the Jewish Community Council,
said it was left on the basis that there is a general sentiment
to endorse the objectives but they would like to know more clearly
7 what is going to be done and why. He said this is good because
+ this is the Jewish establishment. : 1"

Levison described the Washington Jewish Community
Council as the leaders of the Jewish Community Councils all over
the country, all of whom are Democrats and "tied into the machines",

: Levison referred to Jack Greenberg (Director of the Legal
- Defense and Education Fund of the National Association for the 1
Advancement of Colored Péople) stating that Greenberg, in his opinion,
had come up with the best publicity idea thus far and that is to
transport a cabin, which people live in, in Mississippi, to
Washington, D.C. and present it as a gift to the Smithsonian
Institute as showing the manner in which people live in America
in 1968. Levison said that he, Levison, is pushing ‘the "shanty
town thing" but that Greenberg's idea is better. He added that
he intends to see that Greenberg's suggestion is carried out.

: Levison noted that their target in the Washington project
is full employment. He said a victory.in terms of "countable"
jobs would be magnificent for King. .

a "poor peoples’ campaign" in Washington, D.C. this spring.

This campaign will demand that the Congress of the United States . ~
take immediate action to provide jobs u income for the nation's

of poverty is the crucial issue facing this country today. It thre- «
tens to literally tear the United States apart at the seams. Dr.
King and the Southern Christidn,Leadership Conference feel that
the clergy has a moral obligation to take the lead in the quest of

sore social justice and to reweave the.moral fabric of this nation. The

‘nea job is massive and the time is short, we must act now, I'm sure
that that point isn't debatabe, The question is , what can we do?
Dr. King has dispatched organizers inio fifteen major urban areas °
aqmoss thé nation to bring poor people to Washington in April, 1968. « °~
They need your assistance to do their job. Attached is a leaflet

It is stated this recruiting drive, aimed at
attracting persons in the hard-core unemployed and low income
employed groups, has not been too successful. Persons approached
have been asked to attend and participate in captioned activities.
at Washington, D.C. A lack of funds peedes to obtain the required
transportation is 2 major problem.

A sedond source, who has “furnished reliable information
in the past; has advised that the participation of people from
Mississippi and, Alebama in WSP in/‘the Richmond = Petersburg,
Virginie, area, is still in a vory nebulous planning stage.

It- appears that ae Greneta, Mississippi, is
actively engaged in the formulation of such plans. These
tentative plans call for a march by these persons with persons
from Petersburg, Virginie, from Petersburg to Richmond, Virginia.
This march is to be conducted on or about April 22, 1968, the ~~
announced date that a SCLC sponsored march from Baltimore,
pees to Washington, D.C., will take place as’ a kick-off
for WSP.

“RE? WASHINGTON SPRING PROJECT

On March 4, 1968, Revérend Everett E. Smith, Richmond, |
Virginia, a member of the State Board of Virginia of SCIC,
advised he has been in close contact with Dr. Martin Iuther King
regarding plans for the latter's visit to Virginia on March 30,-
1968. These plans, which are subject to change, are that Dr. King
-will visit Danville, Virginia, and Prince Edward County, Virginia,
on the latter date. He will appear at a rally held at a Negro
church in Richmond, Virginia, later in the day of March 30, 1968,
According to Reverend Smith, the purpose of Dr. King's visit to
Virginie is to stimulate interest and participation in the WSP
as well as to promote the interest and growth of SCLC.

Reverend Smith and other sources, who are in a position
to learn of activities in connection with WSP. have advised
generally that they do not anticipate that promotion of WSP will
be too successful in the Richmond area. They based their
opinions on past experiences in this type or activity. They .
advised these have not been too successful in the past, describing
race relations in the Richmond area as good.

They pointed out that there exists in Richmond a "nliddle-
class complacency" that has prevented a concerted or mass united
effort in the promotion of activities designed to better the
conditions of Negroes in the community. This "complacency", they
feel, is based on the fact there are jobs for Negroes, and this
group is, compared to other areas, economically well off. They pointed
out, further, that Negroes have been and are being hired in
City jobs and in other positions formerly available only to
persons of the white race.

PROGRESS REPORT

As of this date information received indicates Rev. E.
RANDEL OSBURN and MICHAEL BIBLER, who are in charge of the WSP
in Cleveland, have been spending some of their time on recruiting
activities for the WSP, but the bulk of their activity has been
on two other projects: namely, Operation Breadbasket and a strike
at St. Luke's Hospital of the Building ervice and Maintenance
Uni which was recently settled. Now that the strike is settled,
OSB and BIBLER can devote more time to the WSP to recruit the
200 psople to travel to Washington, D.C., in April, 1958.

Reportedly Rev. OSBURN is very hopeful of recruiting
these 200 people as he does net feel it is a large number to
obtain as he has recruited larger numbers of individuals in the
past for other projects. x

MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR., President, Southern Christian

conduct a massive civil disobedience campaign in the nation's
Capital the first week of April, 1968, in an effort to pressure
Congress into passing legislation favorable to the Negro.

“The Call and Post", a weekly Cleveland Negro newspaper.
zal circulation in its March 2, 1968 issue, page 4B,

of the peper, Mr. WILLIAM 0. WALKER » captioned, "King
Reconsider His March on Washington." This article then
as follows: : Se t i :

"The old cliche is: ‘Don't bite off more than you
can chew.' I was thinking about this as I read that
Dr. Martin Luther King was touring down in Alabama trying
te recruit participants for his 'Poor Peoples Campaign,'
destined to march on Washington in April. -.
"When I first heard about Dr. King's proposed”
march on Washington and his plans for camping his followers
in the public parks, I felt he had been ill.advised to
embark on a project that at best, could be only a publicity
gimmick. : : :

problem and not be swayed by just one side. —

RE: WASHINGTON SPRING PROJECT (WSP)

"Getting 3,000 poor, unemployed folks to pick up
and leave their homes, humble as some of them may be and,
for an indefinite period, to live out in the open, requires
more than enthusiasm and dedication.

“Granting that Dr. King finally succeeds in get-
ting 3,000 people to Washington, since they are poor
and without adequate funds for their sustenance, :
how is he going to feed them every day? Where is he going
to house -them every night? What about their health
problems? Their legal problems? The problems of discipline
Where is the money for all of these things going to come from?

"If I understand Dr. King's program, he says he
is going to keep his followers in Washington indefinitely.
Let's take a short period of 14 days. Feeding each person
will cost at least $1.00 a day. This then, is $3,000.
In April weather even in Washington, these people will have
to jave some kind of shelter over their heads at night. If.
fe: can get this for $1.00 per person per night, he will
be iucky. This is another $3,000 per day. To provide
other necessities that people require each day, will cost
a minimum of 50¢ per person a day. This adds another $1,500.
So, at the lowest possible estimate, each person will cost
$2.50 per day. For 3,000 people, this adds up to $105,000
for just 14 days. :

"Then, there are the expenses of Dr. King's staff and
other functionaries. The traveling expense of these people
going and coming. The whole thing will add up to a staggering
amount of somebody's money.

"How does Dr. King propose to raise this money?
Meving on faith is one thing, but, 3,000 people, no matter
how much faith they have, need food and shelter. Somebody
will have to produce this in fact, not theory.

"Since most, if not all of the people Dr. King is trying
to recruit are poor and unemployed, wouldn't it be better to
try to get these people into training programs in their local
communities? Granting that some southern communities may not
have such federally financed programs, isn't it better to
petition the government to provide them rather than
taking these people off on a wild goose chase to Washington
where, no matter what happens, they will have to go back to
their home communities for whatever benefits they are to
eventually receive.

. ~CONPEDENBEAL-



RE: WASHINGTON SPRING PROJECT (WSP)

"Since lobbying for meaningful civil rights legis-
lation is the announced goal of Dr. King's efforts, isn't
he really using these unfortunate people who can least
afford the time or money, as human pawns. Inspiring them
with promises as an inducement to get their participation,
is creating a false hope of personal reward before they
return home. If they return home disillusioned and empty
handed, they become prime examples of futility in their ~
communities.

“This must not be permitted to happen. The best
way to prevent it, is not to take them to Washington f
in the first place. If a demonstration of power or force
or whatever you want to call it, is deemed necessary in
Washington, then let those who can afford it march on
Goneress and the President. Past efforts have proven that
sizeable numbers can be induced to turn out for a just cause.
"Tl am afraid Dr. King's venture is frought with
wry dangers and problems. The Negro has a just cause.
there is urgent need for putting pressure at every point
im our civil rights fight to achieve meaningful results.
This pressure should be pushed at the local, state and
national levels. Every resource at the Negrots command should
be pressed into the fight.

"On this, Dr. King or no one else will fina any
opposition. However, doing something just for the publicity
ed it and, using unfortunate human beings, is just going too

ar.

"It would be mest unfortumate if what happened to

the bonus marchers in the late twenties during the Hoover .
administration, happened to Dr. King's marchers. Unfortunately,
the present feeling of a large segment of white people is to
use the police force and, even the National Guard and the U.S.
Army to supress eny riots. You can see from the way the
National Guard acted recently in Orangeburg, S.C., what to.
expect in any future riots. Every law enforcement’ agency
has heen in special training during the winter months. ‘They
have been given special riot control techniques. Special
equipment and supplies have already been purchased for use.
There is no reason then for deliberately creating situations
that may endanger the lives of innocent Negroes.

RE: WASHINGTON SPRING PROJECT (WSP)

"I certainly hope Dr. King and his staff will think
very carefully about what they do and how they do it.
Racial tensions in this country are now at a high pitch.
Entirely too many people are of the mind that another
bloody summer is in the offing. No matter what anybody
says, Negroes have not benefited in any substantial way
from any riot. Other than a looters holiday, the riots.
of the past have been very costly to all Negroes. We
must then do all we can to prevent riots. Washington must
not become another frustrating, bloody battleground."

"The Cleveland Press", a Cleveland daily afternoon
newspaper of general circulation, in its March 6, 1968 issue,
page A8, had an article entitled, "200 Clevelanders Sought
for Dr. King's March", which read as follows:

"Efforts have begun to enlist 200 Clevelanders to
take part in the 'jobs or income! dexonstration to be led -
by Ivy. Martin Luther King in Washington on Apr. 22.

"The goal is to have 200 representatives from 15
cities, totaling 3000 participants, reported Hilbert
Perry, director of the Bruce Klunder Freedom House.

"The Freedom House is one of three groups here
vihich have endorsed the demonstration and are recruiting
participants. The others are Domestic Workers of
America, a union of household workers, and the Cleveland
Welfare Rights Movement, made up mostly of mothers on
relief rolls and their supporters.

"They are attempting to raise funds to charter buses
to Washington and also seeking contributions to pay for child
eare of mothers taking part, or families who will volunteer
to tend children.

"IN WASHINGTON, churches are to be asked to provide |
meals and lodgings for those taking part.

"Perry said those being recruited here cennot be in-
formed yet of what form the demonstration will taxe be-
cause plans are still being worked out by Dr. King's head-
quarters in Atlanta. But it is expected to start with mass
calls on senators and representatives from the communities
represented.

RE: WASHINGTON SPRING PROJECT (WSP

"IWE HOPE to get a pledge that the Government
will become the employer of last resort,' said Perry, iaenneesl
explaining that the Government would establish programs
to employ those unable to get jobs elsewhere.

"tpresent training and employment programs are
woefully inadequate. And we doubt that business will pro-
vide the, jobs needed despite the government subsidy to be
offered,! he said.

"Also to be urged is that Congress discard the new is
Social Security amendment which would limit the nun-
ber of children on the Aid to Dependent Children program
for whon federal funds would be provided after July 1."

For the most pert, OSBURN and BIBLER have been working
on tvo other projects which seem to take most of their time;-
namely, Cperation Breadbasket, which is a program aimed at
increasing Negro employment through a boycott of various stores
and employers; the second is the strike at St. Luke's Hospital,
Cleveland, Ohio, by the Building, Service, and’ Maintenance Union.
Qhis strike was recently settled, which will now give Reverend
OSEURN and BIBLER move time to work on the WSP.

The WSP in Cleveland has an office at 7902 Hough
Avenue, which is not being used as all the work is being done.
from Reverend OSBURN's: apartment at the Park Lane Villa Hotel, -
Cleveland, Ohio. The WSP has been recruiting people in Cleveland
through the Bruce Klunder Freedom House, the Domestic Workers
Union, and Mothers on Welfare. Reverend OSBURN plans to recruit
two hundred people from the poor areas , those on welfare, ete.,
anu OSBURN feels he will not have too much trouble in getting
this many people as he has recruited larger numbers in the past
for other projects. Reverend OSRURN has not indicated who will
take care of the families of those making this WSP trip to
Washington, D.G. in April, 1968, where the money will come from
to pay for the transportation, or living expenses in that city,
means of transportation, etc.

“Phe Worker", an East Coast Communist newspaper,
. on March 3, 1968, page °3) reported on the tribute to Dr.
-W.E.B. DuBois, held at Carnegie Hall, on Friday night,
February 23, 1968. It said that the event was organized by
"Freedomways" Magazine and inaugurated a year of celebration
of the 100th Anniversary of the birth of Dr. DuBois. DuBois
was described as a “scholar, writer, teacher, organizer and
Communist". 7
The article stated that Dr. Martin Luther King
delivered the address honoring the DuBois Centennial Year.
It recounted King's remarks in praise of DuBois and said
that: .
"Summing up DuBois' life, King declared We. cantt
talk of Dr. DuBois without recognizing that he was a radical
‘ all of his life. Some people would like to ignore the fact
‘that he was a Communist in his later years. It is worth
noting that Abraham Lincoln warmly welcomed the support of .
Karl Marx aus the Civil War and corresponded with him
freely'." i

The article alas stated that "King 1 was vigorously
applauded when he said:-

"tTt is time to cease muting the fact that Dr.
‘DuBois was a genius and chose to be a Communist. Our

5 King, according to the article, recalled that
DuBois was a leader of the peace movement in his time and,
..as is the case with Dr. Benjamin Spock, was indicted and
. arrested, in February, 1951, as a leader of the Peace
Information Center. Alluding to the activities he is
planning for Washington, D.C., King is reported to have
said that DuBois will be with’ those participating in
these activities in Washington, D.C., in April, 1968,
"to. demand our right to life, liberty and the pursuit of
- happiness".

"Re Worker" account of the DuBois celebration
related that J. H. O'Dell, the Associate Managing Editor
of "Freedomways" Magazine, opened the evening's program
and welcomed the audience to the centennial celebration.

It stated further that Ossie Davis acted as master of
ceremonies and that "Davis called on the audience to come
to the aid of the militant W.E.B. DuBois Clubs which are
being persecuted by the subversive activities control board
tinder the revived McCarran Act". It quoted Davis as saying
"the DuBois Clubs are not expendable".

Memorandum G. C. Moore to W. C. Sullivan
RE: MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR.

Hn
# ce Tiigen recently advised that to date Chicago
“officials of SCLC have recruited approximately one hundred
individuals who have tentatively agreed to participate in’
King's campaign this spring. The individuals are primarily
welfare recipients and youths from Chicago's near West Side.
King's Chicago staff members also reported that recent events
to solicit funds have been largely unsuccessful and appeals
for money have been met with flat refusals.

OBSERVATIONS:

It is felt that the President would be interested
in receiving information showing that King's communist advisors
are attempting to plan a meeting between the President and King
or perhaps having King speak before a joint session of Congress.

RECOMMENDATION:

That copies of the enclosures be forwarded to

Mrs. Mildred Stegall at the White House; Mr. William Welsh;~
Administrative Assistant to the Vice President; Secretary of
Agriculture Freeman; Secretary of Labor Wirtz; Secretary of
Defense; Secret Service; the Attorney General; the Deputy
Attorney General; Assistant Attorneys General Pollak, Yeagley,

ment; and to the peak koa of ays Navy, and Air Force.

of this letter, Levison advised he will send it to 250,000
more people in the middle-class income group.

Levison told Jones that things are going well in
the mobilization for the ‘Washington Spring Project." King

Mississippi are "just raring to go." :

Another source advised on February 28, 1968, that

Memorandum G, C, Moore to W. C, Sullivan
RE: MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR.

Levison told Jones that he had received an excellent
response to a recent mailing. The solicitations were running
ahead of last year with $15,000 being received in one day,
Levison informed that the letter soliciting funds was carefully
written explaining King's project and, because of the success,
he was sending it to 250,000 more people.

in the mobilization for the project and King informed him that

Levison also told Jones that things are going well
| im the from Alabama and Mississippi are "just raring to go."

OBSERVATIONS :

On February 28, 1968, a WFO informant informed us
that Bernard Lafayette, project Director for SCLC, had informed
him King's organization is experiencing difficulty with re-
cruiting demonstrators for the "Washington Spring Project,"
Because of this, the demonstrations would not start the first
week of April as originally planned, :

Another WFO informant learned from Lafayette's :
assistant, Anthony Henry, that a secret meeting had been held
.by King's group and they had set April 27, 1968, as the date

‘\for the project to start, Henry indicated this date can be |
moved up or back depending on future developments. 7

It is felt that the President would be interested in

receiving information showing the communist help King is re-
ceiving in his proposed "Washington Spring Project,"

RACIAL MATTER

het On February 29, 1968, a confidential source advised

i he had learned that WILL A, PUT "ORD, Executive Director,

i Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC), au: g the
latter part of February 1968 mentioned to several officers of
SCLC that he had recently discussed SCLC's Washington Spring
Project (VSP) with Stanley Levison and Harry Wachtel. According
to Rutherford during this discussion consideration was given to:
one, whether Reverend Martin Luther King, Jr., President, SCLC,
should ende: x to discuss with President Lyndon B. Johnson
problems of Ghetto people; two, the advisability of Reverend
King addressing a joint session of Congress as to problems

and complaints of Ghetto people; and three, whether SCLC should
consider legal action against the United States Government for
financial redress to Negroes based upon the many years the
American Negro has been held in "slavery", Rutherford offered
no further details regarding these points.

It was source's understand’, ng that Rutherford would
discuss these matters subsequently with Andrew J. Young,
Executive Vice President, SCLC; Hosea Williams, Director
of Voter Registration aml Po ical Education, SCLC; and
Bernard Lafayette, Program Administrator, SCLC.

Concerning the possibility of him meeting with
President Johnson, Reverend King merely commented he felt
that at the present time the President would realize a greater
publicity advantage from such a meeting than he or SCLC,

Racial Matters

A confidential source, who has furnished reliable
information in the past, learned on February 24, 1968,
that on that date, Clarence Jones and Stanley Levison discussed
the April, 1968, demonstrations planned by Martin Luther King.,Jr.,
Head of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC),
for Washington, D.C. Jones noted that he had a draft of some
material from Harry Wachtel which calls for full employment, a
guaranteed wage, and a guaranteed annual income. He said also
that a Minister whom he believed is Kirkpatrick (The Reverend
Frederick Kirkpatrick, a coordinator in the New York area for the
Washington Spring Project) gave him a Declaration of Principle
on the march in April. Jones described this declaration as being
of 3 or 4. pages with the inscription "Committee of National Negro
Churchmen" at the bottom. sel

Levison commented that Kirkpatrick is distributing
this material in churches. He told Jones to send this material
to Harry (Wachtel) with any comments he might have.

Levison also mentioned that he considered it
significant that a mailing, which was sent out to reach 80,000
who have contributed in the past two years or more, is running



Washington Spring Project
;

ahead of last year's response with $15,000.00 having been
received the previous day. He said the letter was carefully
written to center on the mobilization and to expsin the
rationale for it. He added that: this letter will go to another
250,000 and more. According to Levison, this mailing is to a
middle class group so that it is a test of the middle class
intellectual, the most concerned type of people. ~

Levison also commented that, in general, he believes
things are going well with the mobilization. He added that King
has said that he is getting very favorable comments from many
quarters and that in Alabama and Mississippi "they're just raring

Oo go",

WASHINGTON SPRING PROJECT

On February 15, 1968, a source who has furnished
reliable information in the past, advised that Reverend
Martin Luther King, Jr, traveled to the Edwards, Mississippi
area to attend a meeting held by the Mississippians for
Political Welfare Rights (MPWR). He advised that the pur-
pose of the meeting was for King to solicit support for

his Poor Peoples March at Washington, D.C, in April, 1968,
and also to lend support to MPWR's activities, Sour¢
related that King planned to complete his appearances in
Mississippi on February 15, 1968, and travel to Montgomery,
Alabama, vhere a similar meeting: was to be held. He advised
that presently in Grenada, Mississippi, Leon Wilbert Hall
and R. B, Cottonreader, Southern Christian Leadership
Conference (SCLC) employees, were actively attempting to
locate individuals to travel to Washington, D.C. in April,
1968, to take part in the demonstration, Source advised
that Reverend B, J. Cameron, President, Grenada County
Freedom Movement, and affiliate of SCLC, will not travel to
Washington in the Spring.

On February 19, 1968, the source advised that Hall
was scheduled to appear before an unknown group at Batesville,
Mississippi, the evening of February 19, 1968, in an effort
to gain support for the Washington Spring Project.

On February 20, 1968, a second source, who has
furnished reliable information in the past, advised that
Dr. Martin Luther King appeared before a group known as the
National Welfare Rights Organization, together with his
aides, in Chicago, Illinois, on February 3-4, 1968. He
advised that this group is operating in Mississippi as the
MPWR. He stated that delegates from 24 states were present

NW 68262 Docid:32989577 Page 273



® oo

WASHINGTON SPRING PROJECT

at the Chicago, Illinois meeting which resulted in a
working coalition being established between this group and
SCLC to bring about a social change in the country, The
source advised that King also put forth requests for support
of his Poor Peoples March in April at Washington, D.C.

He advised that the delegate from Mississippi was one
Geraldine Smith, Holmes County, Mississippi, and furthermore
that the National President of this organization was an
individual from Los Angeles, California.

On February 20, 1968, a third source advised that
Martin Luther King's group is attempting to recruit 200
persons to participate in the April 26, 1968, demonstration
at Washington, D.C, He related that the primary recruiter
in this project in Mississippi appeared to be Mike Higson,
research worker, Lawyers Committee, 233 North Farish Street,
Jackson, Mississippi. :

On February 17, 1968, a fourth source who has
furnished reliable information in the past, advised that a
recent meeting was held in Washington, D.C, in which
Reverend Martin Luther King and the former SNCC Chairman
Stokely Carmichael wege present, A discussion at this
meeting centered around the Washington Spring Project,
The source felt that the Project was completely controlled
by King and that any attempts to take over for the purpose
of promoting violence will meet with little success. The
source reported that Carmichael stated something to the
effect "If King is going to run it, then that will be
all right".

The source advised that a meeting was to take,
place in Miami, Florida, February 19-23, 1968, and that this
meeting was being financed partially by the Ford Foundation
for the purpose of training Negro Ministers from large
northern cities in the area of leadership. Source related
that the captioned matter would possibly be discussed at
the meeting, but that was not the primary purpose for the
session,

RE: WASHINGTON SPRING PROJECT
'
ay
Inspector OWEN W, DAVIS and Detective SILAS VAUGHN,

Metropolitan Police Department, Washington, D. Ci, presently
‘im Miami on assignment, stated February 21, 1968, that they
attended workshop meetings and a general meeting on February
20, 1968, There was mo discussion at these meetings relative
to the Washington Spring Project, The meetings generally
related to the Ministers Leadership Teaining Program, as
outlined in a leaflet distributed to the delegates.
Inspector DAVIS estimated 20 Southern Christian Leadership
Conference (SCLC) members among the delegates. He said most

of the delegetes are mimisters from various sections of the
United States,

Inspector DAVIS stated @ press conference was held
February 20, 1968, with Dr. ANDREW YOUNG and Reverend T. Y.
ROGERS, JR., answering most of the questions, Dr. MARTIN
LUTHER KING was not present at the press conference and has
not been seen at the Sheraton Four Ambassadors Hotel by any
of the security and hotel personnel on February 20, 1968, and
the morning of February 21, 1968,

Mee MM T-1 furnished the following information, on
. February 21, 1968; '
Tae SCLC meeting which he is attending at the
Sheraton Four Ambassadors, continued throughout the day of
February 20, 196%, without any major developments.

The group of ministers attending was broken up
into workshop units of approximately nine or ten ministers -
each. Each group had a leader who directed the activities
of his workshop.

One suck workshop was directed by Reverend JESSIE
JACKSON, who is a SCLC leader from Chicago. During the
progress of this workshop, Reverend JACKSON made the following }
statements: 7 i

RE: WASHINGIOY SPRING PROJECT

He advocated that at least 1003 ministers go to
Washington to demusd that the United States call out of
Viet Kam. fle felt such activity could be arranged,
it would bring euftics weight to bear to cause the
Goversuait to teks such action.

He discussed what was termed “bread basket project”
whick was described as an SCLC project waich would be
instituted in the lerge city ghettos, wherein economic
pressure would be brought on white merchants to employ Negro
help and also on the white business commmeity te deposit funds
im Negro benks., ‘hese projects were to be set up in advance
and if the desired result was mot obtained, them the SCLC

‘would resort to picketing and demoastrating and this would be
brought about through pre-srrangements whereby it would be
ouly necessary to meke a nueber of phome calls and give a
code word "knock cut" which would bring the desired pickets
and denonstrators to a pre-arranged location,

The shove wis discussed in general terms and no
Specific cities or areas were mentioned. But this wes
put forth as a project that cowld be put into effect.

Reverend JAWES BEVEL, a KING aide from Chicago, :
addressed a group in which he stated that he firmly believed
in burning down the cities if sowsthing significant would
come out of it, But that he did not believe im burning the
cities just Yor the sake of bursing them.

(JAMES BEVEL is referred to in the Appendix
section of this mexorandwa.)

Reverend BEVEL additioually made the statement
that he had attempted te gst Negro leaders in New York to
burn down the city when ADAM CLAYTON POWELL lost his
Congressional seat, however, was unsuccessful.

Also from BEVEL's address, it wes apparent that
there is a marked growing tendency away from de-segregation
‘and integrations and @ definite move by the SCLC toward
econimic and political black power.

RE; WASHINGTON SPRING PROJECT - i

Additionally, it was evident from BEVEL's address

ket there is & growing tendency to degrade the institutional-
iged church waich wis described as the “Sunday Church” that is
well established in this country and to unite 411 of the
colored churches into ome tremendows, powerful group. Also,
there is evidence of attempts to break the moral fiber of
attending ministers, AS an example, Re end BEVEL stated that
he was com ed end firmly believed that Mary was raped by 4
Romin soldier end that Christ yas mot the result of a virgin
birth,

(Fires Name Unknown) WOORRUFF, am Episcopal minister

from Philadelphia wes overheard to stats that he was head of the

- “Liberation School” in Philedelphia and that he kad many classes
in various homes im the area, Ke stated that he was in favor of
using terrorist tactics to achieve the ends of "Black Power,”
Also, it was overheard that WOODRUFF allegediy had been
arrested in Nashville, Tennessee, some time ago for having
operated 4 “hate school.”

On Februsry 21, 1968, Mi T.2 furmished the
following information: :

At @ workshop meeting held on February 21, 1968,
the fact that the Ford Foundation was paying for this
meeting was discussed.

The main topic of discussion was, however,
“operation bread basket" which is to be put imto effect
by the ministers when they return to their respective
cities, This project is to bring economic pressure upon
the white business comeunity im order to secure better.
jobs, better housing, more pay and to generally improve
the conditions of the Negroes in the large ghetto areas.

This project will take the form of a coordinated,
concerted effort to bring economic pressure and efforts will
bs mide to coordinate this program throughout the country so
that economic pressure can be brought on some specific
Segment of the economy om a national basis, An example was
given wherein picket aad demonstrations could occur 7
Simultaneously at a 8ess enterprise such as "Coca Cols"
so that on a pre-arranged date end tims, pickets and

There hes been no discussion of the Washington
Spring Project and the conference is moving aloxg smoothly
with no discussion 6f any exgected violence or disturbances
which might possibly lead to violence, ,

Former Senator HARRY P. CAIN (formerly from
Washington State, now residing in Miami, Florida) who has
offices im the executive suite of the First Federal Savings ’
and Loan Association office building, Miami, Florida,
telephonically contacted the Miami Office of the Federal
Bureau of Investigation on February 21, 1968. Senator
CAIN advised that he is chairman of the Community Relations ;
Board for Dade County, Florida, and was contacted by two :
individuzis who steted they were aides of Reverend MARTIN
LUTHER KING, JR. These aides stated that Reverend KING
desired to meet with a small representative group of Miami
people involved with the Community Relatioms Board in order
that he might explain in detail what his programs wowid be
for the coming nontks,

Senator CAIN reported that he was arranging such
@ meeting and he expects to have approximately forty
community leaders present, including representatives from all
local newspapers, He stated that the meeting was not for the
purpose of obtsining a news story and those attending would
be so advised, Sexator CAIN reported that the meeting will

APPENDIX

JAMES BEVEL

BEVEL, in early March, 1986, was chserved to be
present at the offices of the West Side W.E.B, DuBois
Club in Chicago (f0C). Discussion took place at this time
centering around reaction to a recent notification that
the Attorney General of the United States imtended to label
the DuBois Clubs as a Commmist front, BEVEL, in conversation,
stated that he womld have ignored this notification, and kept
about the work in which he was engaged. He felt that if the
DuBois Clubs haye a real program of help for the people, then
people would answer for the clubs despite any labels applied
to then.

Most present agreed that the attack on the DuBois

Clubs was a part of the plan by the "establishment" to
-undermize the civil rights movement. ‘They felt that the
. recent hearings imto Klen astivities in this coumtry was
only a beginning which would lead to a full attack oa the
Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC), the real
target. One of those present stated during the course of
this discussion that he was mot a Commmist, and to this
BEVEL was overheard to reply that every thinking American
should be. He stated that Negroes have not begun to read
yet, but whem they do, they will all be socigiists.

Memorandum G. C. Moore to W. C. Sullivan
RE: MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR.

has tried, without success, to dissuade King from executing
the Project. Dr. Morsell is afraid that King cannot control
the demonstrators and there is a likelihood that the overall
demonstration will be taken over by extremists.

King appears to be concentrating his attention on .
the South where he has chartered a small twin-engine aircraft 1
to help speed him about urging people to support his campaign.

AT qc advised recently that the entire Washington
Spring Project seems to be suffering from indecision, petty
bickering among the staff members and the idiosyncrasies of i
King's ego. This source advised that King is worried about
}the lack of progress being made by his recruiters. He is
n concerned about the success of the program. He has instructed
his staff to seriously consider whether or not they can
successfully carry out the Project. If they cannot then it
will be necessary to establish a reason as to why he finds
it necessary to discontinue the Washington Spring Project.

: : King has chartered a small twin-engine aircraft to
a help speed him about the South urging people to support his

_Another source advised recently that the entire

continue the Washington Spring Project. .

: In this connection, the "Mi ami Herald" newspaper on
February 18, 1968, reported that some Negro leaders will urge
. King to detour his planned massive civil disobedience demon-
stration scheduled for April, 1968, in Washington, D. C., and ~ :
redirect the demonstrators to the local districts of Congressmen i
who have voted against civil rights legislation. These leaders
feel that’ Congressmen do not care what happens in .
Washington, D. C., but they would feel the impact of these
‘sdemonstrations in-their home districts. neeoe

WASHINGTON SPRING PROJECT

The February 18, 1968, issue of "The Sunday Star,"
a daily Washington, D,C., newspaper reported that Dr. Martin
luther King’s Washington campaign began quietly as Southern
Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) field workers opened
an office at 14th and U Streets, N.W., Washington, D.C.

The article identified the field workers as J.T.
Johnson, Lester Hankerson and Henry Brownlee of the SCLC and
Anthony Henry and William Moyer of the “American Friends
Service Committee, a Quaker affiliated organization,"

On February 19, 1968, a confidential source, who
sete has furnished reliable information in the past, advised that
= on February 16, 1968, he had passed the building which has

been secured by the SCLC and it gave no appearance of being
in use, He passed the building again on February 19, 1968,
and observed that only two desks had been placed in the
building. The office gave no appearance of being opened.
He further advised that a typewritten notice was on SCLC,
“Atlanta, Georgia, stationary on a window indicating the
office to be the headquarters of Dr, Martin Luther King and
his "poor peoples march" on Washington, 7

On February 20, 1968, a second confidential source,
who has furnished reliable inrmation in the past, advised
the building located on the northwest corner. of 14th and U
Streets, N.W., Washington, D.C., was being readied for use by
Dr, Martin Luther King and the SCLC, This source observed
the building to have two entrances, One entrance is located
on 1401 U Street, N.W., while the other is 2000 - 14th Street,
N.W. He advised that no activity was taking place at the
office,

RE: WASHINGTON SPRING PROJECT

Reference is made to communication from this Bureau
dated February 19, 1968.

The "Miami Herald" a local Miami, Florida, newspaper

on February 20, 1968, reported that Dr. MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR.,

opened a series of meetings in Miami, Florida, on February 19,
1968, designed to help Negro clergymen minister to the social

-and economic needs of their congregations. This article report-
ed that Dr, KING and Reverend ANDREW YOUNG, one of his top aides
im the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC), said the

five-day series of conferences will not include planning for
civil rights or anti-war demonstrations.

It was also reported that Dr. KING and Reverend YOUNG

both said they did not expect STOKELY CARMICHAEL and RAP BROWN,
leaders of the vocal Black Nationalist militancy to attend,
However, Reverend YOUNG said, "If STOKELY and RAP come we
won't throw them out." This article goes on to report that

im addition to the 150 official delegates, about 50 more
ministers are expected to attend the meetings, which are not
open to the public.

It was reported that about 125 delegates attended a
luncheon on February 19, 1968, and heard a talk by Dr. R, A.
ABERNATHY, a Vice-President of SCLC. In addition, this
article reports that three lecturers, followed by workshop
sessions, are scheduled for February 20, 1968.

MM T-1 advised that the Ministers Conference at the
Sheraton Four Ambassadors, Miami, Florida, opened on schedule
on February 19, 1968. In welcoming the group, Dr. MARTIN
LUTHER KING, JR., reiterated that the purpose of this
conference was for discussion, study and training in

.conmection with problems facing the Negroes in the big city

areas.

RE; WASHINGTON SPRING PROJECT

He further stated that attention ‘yould be given to
attempting to reconcile the term "black power" with the over-
all civil rights movement in the United States. During the
opening conference, nonviolence was continuously stressed,

Br. KING stated that over-~integration could occur to
the point that Negroes could lose their identity. He gave
@S an example the integration of the Methodist Church, however,
this was not further explained.

The only remark that was made to the people in
attendance relative to the “Washington trip" was that this
conference in Miami would net be used for the purpose of
recruiting people for the trip to Washington, nor would it be
a topic of discussion.

On February 20, 1968, the entire group wil] be broken 4
up into “workshep waits" according to their interest and needs y
of the area from which the various ministers came. All leaders
are to take part in the activities of the workshop and report ¥
back to the entire assembly.

During the opening day of this meeting, only one
item of dissension occurred and that involved some opposition
to the fact that apparently DAN MONAHAN, who was formerly
commected with Urban Housing, has been imvited to address the’
conference in Miami. Some ministers disagreed with this
invitation, however, Reverend ANDREW YOUNG stated that his
presence could contribute te the conference, and that he
should be heard.

On February 20, 1968, Lieutemant HARVERT SWILLEY,
Intelligence Unit, Miami, Florida, Police Department, reported
that several items of literature were being passed out to the
delegates. Included in the literature was a leaflet captioned
“The Southern Christian Leadership Conference" and outlines.
the purpose of the training program. Im addition, a state~ _
went mide by Dr. MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR., Atianta, Georgia, on
December 4, 1967, which. statement relates to the Washington
Spring Project, was also being passed out.

These two items are quoted @s follows:

Rev. T, Y, Rogers, Jr., Director
“CRISIS OF THE CITIES: A CREATIVE ANGLE

"t,..transforming the imchoate rage of the

ghetto into a creative force for change,.,.'

"The Ministers Leadership Training Program is
designed to train local leaders in the knowledge of
the many problems which the residents of the ghetto
face and in ways of solving these problems. Our
focus is the Black Preacher and the Black church for
we believe that the greatest potential power for
controlling the forces which make and sustain as well:
as those which can change the structure of the ghetto,
is within the Black church. We further believe that
because of the central place for which the Black
church holds in the Negro community, we can develop
the kind of leadership which will develop programs to
transfer control of the ghetto to these who reside ©
there, Finally, the Southern Christian Leadership
Conference is an extension of the church and therefore
much of cur emphasis should be on stremgthening the
witness of the church im areas of life where problems
are greatest.

"The Ministers Leadership Training Program will be
conducted in fifteen metropolitan areas of our nation.
We have selected a minimum of eight amd a maximum
of twenty preachers from these fifteen areas, depend-
ing upon the Size and population, who will participate

in our program. Our program begins with an orientation -

workshop in Miami, Florida. This workshep is
designed to acquaint the preachers wko will partici-
pate in our program with the over 211 histery and
philosophy of the Southern Christian Leadership
Conference and with the programs which demand our
concern at present, This workshop is also designed
to acquaint the participamts with the nature and scope



: RE: WASHINGTON SPRING PROJECT |

“of the multiplicity of problems facing the residents of
the ghetto, Our emphasis will be on a detailed
examination of the forces which make the ghetto a
reality; the structures which maintain the ghetto;
and the possibility of destroying the ghetto by re-
structuring and changing ownershin of the economic
Structures of the ghetto. There will also be an
examination of the theology of the church, a look

at the history of the Black church, amd a re-defining
of the ethic of the Black church im terms of the
problems faced by Black churches today.

“To accomplish the above momtioned ends we
have invited to this workshop persums with expertise H
in the problems of the ghetto, They will deal: with. H
the ‘Making of the Ghetto, ‘the New Mythology,‘ q
‘Political Action aud Political Comlition,' the . . i
‘Challenge of an Urban Ministry,’ ‘Jobs,' ‘Welfare {
Rights,' ‘Nonviolence and Social Change,* and other
problems facing the poor.

During the orientation workshop the cities will r)
be organized, A convemer will be chosen for each
city with the exception of New York City which will
have a convener for Brooklyn and Queens and att
another for Manhattan and the Bronx. These :
Sixteen conveners will call the mem of their cities i
together once per week for study, discussion, 7
learning, planning and executing programs. The
conveners will serve»as the link between the
Atlanta office of the Ministers Leadership Training
Program and ths particular city involved, and will
channel programs and information to the members
of their group.

"In brief the goals of the Ministers Leadership 4
Training Program are as follows; :

H “1, To semsitize Black preachers to

the problems of the ghetto and the
relatiouship of these problems to
their ministries,

"Statement by Dr. Martin Luther Kins, Jr.
President, Southern Christian Leadership Conference
Atlanta, Georgia

"December 4, 1967 1 ; /
“Ladies and Gentlemen: ,

: "Last week the staff of the Southern Christian

Leadership Conference held one of the most important

meetings we have ever convened, We had intensive :
discussions end analyses of our work and of the

challenges which confront us and our nation, and at

the end we made a decision which I wish to announce

today.

"The Southern Christian Leadership Conference
will lead waves of the nation's poor and disinherited
to Washington, D. C., next spring to demand redress of
their grievances by the United States government and
to secure at least jobs or income for all.

"We will go there, we will demand to be heard,
and we will stay until America responds.- If this
means forcible repression of ovr movement, we will =
confront it, for we have done this before, If this
means scorn or ridicule, we embrace it, for that is
what America’s poor now receive. If it means jail, we
accept it willingly, for the millions of poor already
are imprisoned by exploitation and discrimination.
But we hove, with.growing confidence, that our campaign
in Washington will receive at first a sympathetic
understanding across our nation, followed by dramatic
expansion of nonviolent demonstrations in Washington
and simultaneous protests elsewhere, In short, we
will be petitionimg our government moves against
Roverty.

"We have now begun preparations for the
Washington campaign. Our staff will soon be taking
new assignments te erganize people to go to Washington
from 10 key cities and 5 rural areas. This will be
no mere one-day march in Washington, but a trek to
the nation’s capital by suffering and outraged citizens

“who will go to stéy until some definite and positive
action is taken to provide jobs and income for the
poor.

“We are sending our staff into these key areas
to meet with tke local leadership of these areas to
discuss their readiness to cooperate with us in this.
venture. 7

"In the coming weeks we will disclose our
detailed plans on mobilizing this massive campaign.
and on the specific proposals which we are formulating.

"Today I would like to teil you why the Southern
Christian Leadership Conference has decided to under-
take this task with the advice and participation we
anticipate from other organizations and thousands of
individuais.

"America is at a crossrozds of history, and it
is critically important for us, a nation and a society,
to choose a new path and move upon it with resolution
and courage.

"It is impossible to under-estimate the crisis we face
in America. The stability of a civilization, the potential
of free government, and the simple honor of men are at
stake,

"Those who serve in the human-rights movement, |
including our Southern Christian Leadership Conference,
are keenly aware of the increasing bitterness and
despair and frustration that threaten the worst chaos,
hatred and violence any nation hes ever encountered.

“In a sense, we are already at war with and among
ourselves, Affluent Americans are locked into suburbs
of physical comfort and mentel insecurity; poor Anericans
are locked inside ghettoes of material privation and
Spiritual debilitation; and 211 of ws can almost feel
the presence of a kind of social insanity which could
lead to national ruin.

"Consider, for example, the spectacle of cities
burning while the national government speaks of
repression instead of rehabilitation. Or think of
children starving in Mississippi while prosperous
farmers are rewarded for not producing food, Or
Negro mothers leaving children in tenements to work

in neighborhoods where people of color czn not live,
Or the awesome bombardment, already greeter than

the munitions we exploded in Werld II, against a small
Asian land, while political brokers de-escalate and
very nearly disarm a timid action against poverty,

Or a nation gorged on mozey while millions of its
citizens are denied a good education, adequate health
services, decent housing, meaningful employment,

and even respect, and are then told to be responsible.

'The true responsibility for the existence of
these deplorable conditions lies ultimately with the
larger society, and much of the immediate respon-
sibility for removing the injustices can be laid
directly at the door of the federal government.

“This is the institution which has the power to -
act, the resources to tap, and the duty to respond.
And yet, this very government now lacks the will to

. make reforms which are demanded by a rising chorus

across the nation. According to the Harris Poll, for
example, a substantial majority of Americans believe

’ that we must proceed at once to tear down and rebuild

the slums, and a solid majority feel that everyone
should have a jeb. Concerned leaders of industry, civil-
rights organizations, labor unions and churches are
joining in such groups as the new Urban Coalition to
urge progressive economic measures at the national
level. Many urban political leaders are ready to
carry out enlightened programs if only the federal
government will provide the meeded financial support.
Newsweek magazine recently devoted an entire issue to
the problem of racism in America and set forth some
sound prepesals for dealing with this situation.

“I cite these facts merely to ‘show that a clear

majority in America are asking for the very things
which we will demand in Weshington.—

"We have learned from hard and bitter experience :
in our movement that our government dees not move to correct
@ problem involving race until it is confronted directly
and dramatically. it required a Selma before the
fundamental right to vote was written into the federal
statutes. It took 2 Birmingham to dramatize the
economic plight of the Negro, and compel the government
to act.

"Qnrest among the poor of America, and particularly
among Negroes, is grewing rapidly, Im this age of A
technological wizardry and political immorality, the~
poor are demanding that the basic need of people be met
as the first priority of our domestic programs. Poor
people can not long be placated by the giamour of 4
multi-billion-dollars exploits in space. Poor people 4
who encounter racial discrimination every day in every .4
aspect of their lives can not be fooled by patronizing i
gestures and half-way promises, Poor people who are y
‘treated with derision and abuse by an economic system 7
soon conclude with elementary logic that they have no
rational interest in killing people 12,000 miles away
in the name of defending that system.

"We intend to channelize the smouldering rage and 7
frustration of Negro people in to an effective, militant
and nonviolent movement of massive proportions in
Washington and other areas. Similarly, we will be
€alling on the swelling masses of young people in this
country who are disenchanted with this materialistic
Society, and asking them to join us in our new
Washington movement. We also look for participation
by representatives of the millions of non-Negro poor-
Indians, Mexican-Americans, Puerto Ricans, Appalachians,
and others, And we shall welcome assistance from all
Americans of good will.

"And so, we have decided to go to Washington and
to use any means of legitimate nonviolent protest
necessary to move our nation and our government on a
new course of social, economic, and political reform.
As I said before, the power to imitiate this reform
resides in Washington. The President and the Congress
have a primary responsibility for lew minimum wages,
for a degrading system of imadequate welfare, for
subsidies of the rich and unemployment and under-

RE: WASHINGTON SPRING : PROJECT

i

Reference is made to commmication from the Miami
oot oaee the Federal Bursau of Investigation dated February
10, 1968.

The “Yidami Herald," a local Miami, Florida, newspaper,
reported February 18, 1968, that some Negro leaders, not further
identified, will urge Dr. MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR., at meetings
in Miami, Florida, to detour his planned massive eivil dis-
obedience demonstration scheduled for April in Washington, D. Cc.
The Negro leaders will recommend that efforts be redirected
to demonstrate in districts of Congressmen who have voted
against civil rights legislation.

The "Miami Herald" reported that one prominent civil
rights leader, who requested his identity be withheld, said
“Congressmen could care less about demonstrations in Washington--
and Negroes could be made to look bad mationally. But if the
demonstrations are held in the home districts of certain
Congressmen they most certainly will feel the impact."

MM T-I advised on February 19, 1968, that Dr. MARTIN
LUTHER KING, JR., arrived at the Sheraton Four Ambassadors
Hotel atl0:30 Pi on February 18, 1968. Dr. KING refused to
utilize the suite reserved for him and kept moving from room {
to room, Two cf Dr. KING's aides, identified as Dr. A, YOUNG ~ 4
and Reverend F, C, BENNETT, made a thorough check of the i
room reserved for Dr. KING, apparently leoking for a “bugging 4
device."

Dr, KING, through Dr. YOUNG and Reverend BENNETT,
according te the source, has already refused to be interviewed
by. the various news media and it appeared to the source that
KING was quite comcerned with the amount of security being
effected by the Sheraton Four Ambassadors Hotel, along with
local authorities.

as an exhibit room and the general meeting, with an estimated
170 persons in attendance, is taking place in the Parliamentary

On February 9, 1968, a confidential source, who

has furnished reliable information in the past, said that
Albert/\Turner, State of Alabama leader of the Washington

Spring Project, and State of Alabama recruiter for the

Southern Christian Leadership Conference -(SCLC) addressed

a meeting of the Alabama Action Committee (AAC), a Civil

Rights Group, at Montgomery, Alabama, on February 5, 1968.
.JAt the time, Turner divulged that the SCLC received a

$25,000 grant within the last ten days from the Ford Ferndation,
which was to help defray expenses of the upcoming S¢t-:
‘demonstrations to be held at Washington, D, C. this spring.

Turner, the source said, is attempting to recruit
“200 persons in Alabama.for the Washington Spring Project.
He is concentrating his activities in this regard in the
following seven counties: :

Dallas
Monroe
Lowndes
Bullock
Montgomery
Macon

y Autauga

The source added that Richar joone, Executive
Director of the AAC, made an appearance’ following Turner's
talk at thd AAC meeting held on February 5, 1968, at Montgomery.
Boone confirmed Turnér's announcement about the $25,000 i. A
contributed by the Ford Foundation. Paranaess ALR

LabaAnip fetish! capped Tee

Seemingly, Turner and Boone "have some kind of a
working agreement, the source said. It would also appear,
the source said, that some kind of alliance exists between
the SCLC and the AAC, for the fact that Turner used a meeting
of the AAC as a platform to raise his quota of 200 demonstrators
for the Washington Spring Project. .

WASHINGTON SPRING PROJECT

The source said that even though it appears
the AAC and the SCLC are cooperating in the Washington . 1
Spring Project, he has discovered nothing to cause him
to believe that Martin Luther King and Richard Boone are |
not still at odds.

A second confidential source, who has furnished
reliable information in the past, on February 14 and 15,
1968, advised that he had received a written notice, which
was undated, from Albert Turner at Marion, Alabama, inviting 7
him to attend a meeting to be held on Friday, ‘February 16,
1968, at a’ Baptist Church located at 143 Brond Street.
Selma, Alabama, at 10:00 A. M. The sourcs ag tha
Dr. Martin Luther King was scheduled to addrwss the mecst Ag
and to solicit support from those in attendance for
the Washington Spring Project.

After the Selma meeting, the source said that 2
King was scheduled to appear at Montgoriery at 12:30 P. M.,
February 16, 1968, at the Maggie Street Baptist Church, 4
where he was to give a similar talk about the Washington 7
Spring Project. Thereafter, King was expected to make his
way to Birmingham, Alabama, by airplane. :

Re: WASHINGTON SPRING PROJECT (WSP) -CONPEBENP IAL

a serious threat against the life of Martin Luther King and
that an-attempt upon his life will be made during this march,
In order to counteract such an attempt, Reverend Bennette
was assigned to be in charge of security for Martin Luther
King and Ralph Henry was assigned to be Reverend Bennette's
assistant. It was indicated that those involved in this
security Should be alert for danger, not only from white
persons but also from Negroes. No additional information
was given at this time concerning any possible threats.

It was reported by several of those present that
serious difficulty had been encountered in the northern states
in recruiting participants for the Washington Spring Project.
It was, therefore, decided to concentrate the recruitment of
participants in the southern states.

It was also reported that serious financial problems
have developed, especially in certain areas, Hosea Williams
presented proposed budgets for the "financially deprived or
unresponsive areas involved in the Washington campaign.'"' He
stated that for one reason or another the following areas
seemed to be having unSolved financial problems in getting
their mobilization and recruiting started:

Mississippi

Alabama

Georgia :
North Carolina

South Carolina

Virginia

Washington, D. C.

Baltimore, Maryland

Williams, stated that it was originally planned that
each project area was to raise its own funds, however, this
does not seem possible in the poorer areas at this time. -He
reported that he had conferred with project leaers in the
above areas and théy state that they can do the job provided
they are furnished’ the resources to get it started. Based on
Williams' conversations witli these leaders,.a budget has been
drawn up for each of the above areas which provides between
$1,200 to $1,500 per month with the exception of South Carolina
which will receive $740 and Washington, D. C.; which will
receive $3,500.. These budgets include payments for items such

On 1/29/68 at an SCLC Executive Staff meeting
KING announced HOSEA WILLIAMS would serve as “Field
Director" in Washington, D. C., of the WSP and also have
overall supervision of SCLC personnel invelved in this
project (re Atlanta airtel and LHM 2/2/68). ANDREW J.
YOUNG, Executive Vice President, SCLC, at that time was
instructed by KING to: write a letter to each SCLC staff
member previously assigned to various cities ‘and lecations
to recruit demonstrators for the WSP in which he was to
inform them of WILLIAMS' position.

On 2/12/68 WILLIAMS determined this letter had
mot been written and as a result SCLC personnel did not
knoy to whom they should report or from whom to seek
assistance, WILLIAMS also submitted during the 2/12/68 meeting
& memorandum in which he requested a budget (of approximately $10,000)
@ satretary,and an Assistant in order to effectively supervise
the WSP. @nere then ensured at this. meeting considerable
vesty discussion as to the validity of WILLIAMS' requests.
WILLIAM A, RUTHERFORD, Executive Director, SCLC, made an
issue over the fact he did not have the time or inclination
to pass judgment on a multitude of vouchers which WILLIAMS
would submit in connection with his budget, WILLIAMS became
envaged and left the meeting for almost an hour. KING made
ge effort to contol the disorganized discussion or to render
& decision. «

: The 2/12/68 meeting adjourned without the staff
reaching a decision on WILLIAMS' requests. KING, YOUNG,
RETHEREORD, and RALPH D, ABERNATAY, Vice President and
Treasurer, SCLC, were supposed to meet regarding these issues om 243/78.
informant did not have opportunity to participate in this
ing and as of 2/14/68 had no further information regarding
matter, :

Informant observed that there appears to be a

continuing battle of personalities between WILLIAMS and

SSEERFORD, He also observed that KING seems to be in a

ubetantial twofold dilémma predicated upon his tremen=-

dows ego,ie.,; one, should he cooperate fully with WILLIAMS
which probably will insure the success of the WSP but at

the same time will permit WILLIAMS to have the limelight and
possibly become a virtual hero; two, should he keep WILLIAMS
more or less throttled despite his refusal to accept WILLIAMS’
recent resignation and take a chance the WSP will be successful
without the benefit of WILLIAMS' full energies or take a chance
the WSP may not succeed and have the national and international
image of MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR., become tarnished. It is
because of the latter informant believes that KING has indicated

by SCLC to recruit and train its WSP demonstrators has passed and
the entire project seems to be suffering from indecision and petty

dosyncrasies of KING's ego.

At this point it would appear SCLC will require 2 good

WASHINGTON SPRING PROJECT
RACIAL MATTER. ~

A confidential source on February 14, 1968, advised
he had learned that Reverend Martin Luther King, Iv., President,
Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC), continued to .
be. discouraged with the lack of progress made. by SCLC staff
members in recruiting and-training demonstrators for SCLC's

“Washington Spring Project, (WSP). In this connection Reverend
King recently ‘held an "emergency meeting" of the SCLC Executive
officers to consider the WSP,

Reverend King pointed out that SCLC has previously
braun that it will “have 3,000 demonstrators in Washington,
Ds C., in early April 1968, Should only a few hundred demonstrators
appear in Washington, D. C., Reverend King said he and SCLC would
become the laughing stock of the nation.’ He declared that if
SCLC produces 3,000 demonstrators and'the nation fails to react
appropriately this will be the esponsibility, of the nation <
and not SCLC; On the other hand, he said, SCLC will be greatly
at fault if it does not produce the ‘announced number of
demonstrators. :

Reverend King suggested that officers of SCLC seriously
consider whether or not they can successfully.carry out the
planned. WSP, He said if they feel’ they cannot then it will be
necessary to.establish a reason as to-why he and SCLC finds |
it MBG to nace tinal the SP.

meet for an hour and an hour and a half apiece until 4:00
in the afternoon when a free period was scheduled plus
dinner and more meetings of other groups were scheduled
from 8:00 p.m, until late at night. Since no more than 15.
people showed up to take part in KING's activity at the —
hurch, Dr. KING held a press conference at 11:45 a.m. His
yemarks to the assembled press dealt mainly with the Vietnam
war, national policy of the United States bac balenaLia and
the Pueblo incident. .

Dr. KING then left the church for lunch and
shortly after 3:00 p.m. he returned to the church at the
insistence of the Rev. ANDERSON, whereupon KING agreed
reluctantly to address the group with the stipulation he
spend no more than 15 minutes with them. There were approxi--
mately 20 people spoken to by Dr. KING.

After meeting with this group Dr, KING talked with
another group which was designated as “welfare rights
organizations" and apparently the Rev. JAMES ORANGE also
addressed this group because subsequent to this meeting
several women were overheard to say “that ORANGE is a liar |
and can do nothing for Mr. KING, He is a phony in every
sense of the word."

De. “KING: left the church at approximately 4:00 p.m.
for dinner and relaxation and returned at 8:20 p.m. to appear’
pefore a group of individuals identified as Afro-American
groups, militants, and eductitional people, There were
approximately 30 people in attendance and this meeting
lasted no more than 20 minutes.

The source advised that Dr. KING was extremely
annoyed, agitated, and disappointed by the lack of atten-
dance at the meetings and he did not desire to return far
the evening meetings; however, he was told by telephone
over a hundred people were waiting when in reality there
were only about 30.

WASHINGTON SPRING PROJECT

A conversation was overheard to the effect that
ORANGE, who is in charge of thc Philadelphia office ar 2102
Diamond Street of SCIC's Washington Spring Project, sald thisha
igveantd headquarters and will only be used tn an attempt
to pecure participants for the Washington Spring Project.
KING has no further plans of any activity in Philadelphia
other than this reeruitment.

KING's plans for mee@ting with groups on Saturday
morning were cancelled and according to press publicity KING
was suffering from laryngitis; however, it is the considered
opinion of the source that KING was piqued at the lack of
attendance at the Friday meetings.

The source also advised that there had apparently
been a concerted effort made by some unknown individual to
- persuade ministers not to cooperate with KING by not showing
up.at the Friday morning first conference. This could very
likely be true since there weve only two Negro ministers on
hand for the Friday morning meeting, .

It would also appear from overheard conversations
and comments that KING's advance men, ORANGE and TABB, did
not do an effective job.

Dr. KING left by air at 12:30 p.m., February 10, .
1968, for Atlanta, da.

RE: WASHINGTON SPRING PROJECT

On January 15, 1968, a first confidential source,
advised a Special Agent of the Federai Bureau of Investigation
(SA of FBI) that the Ohio State University Committee to End
the War, a recognized student organization at Ohio State
University (OS¥), Columbus, Ohio, had reserved space in the

- Ohio Union, on the OSU Campus, on January 20-21, 1968, for a
"non-violent workshop". The first confidential source said
reservations for the space were made by Professor Bernard —
Rosen, Department of Philosophy, OSU, the faculty adviser for
the OSU Committee to End the War in Vietnam.

The first confidential source said the reservation
for the "non~violent workshop" listed the following proposed
speakers:

dames E. Bristol

Charles Walker
Reverend Osborne :

Fred Shuttiesworth

Michael Bibler

‘The first confidential source said the proposed
speakers were identified only by name, and it was indicated
the speeches ceneerned non~violent tactics.

RE: WASHINGTON SPRING PROJECT : * -CONPEDENEEAE

On January 22, 1968, a second confidential source,
advised an SA of the FBI that a workshop to study non-violent
demonstration techniques was held at the Ohio State University
Student Union building, Columbus, Ohio, on January 20 and 21,
1968, an

aa
The second confidential source advised as follows:

The workshop was scheduled to be held from
10:00 a.m. to 11:00 p.m., January 20, 1968, and from 11:00 a.m.
to 11:00 p.m., January 21, 1968. However, participants in
the workshop did not begin arriving for the workshop until
late in the afternoon of January 20, 1968. - There Were approxi-
tlately twenty-six individuals present when the workshop finally
got underway. Pat Shafer, field secretary of the Ohio Peace
Action Council, was in charge of the workshop.

The principal speakers at the workshop were
Reverend Ed Randall Osburn, Cleveland, Ohio, associated with
the Southern ‘Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC); Mike
Bibler; and James Bristol, associated with the American
Friends Service Committee. (AFSC). Reverend Osburn had driven
to the workshop from Cleveland, Ohio, with Mike Bibler, while
James Bristol had flown by airplane to Columbus, Ohio, from
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

From the afternoon of January 20, 1968, to the
conclusion of the workshop on that date, there was no discussion
of non-violent demonstration techniques. The discussions
centered around the Washington Spring Project, being sponsored

-by the SCLC at Washington, D.C., during the summer of 1968.

: During their comments to the group, Reverend Osburn,
‘Bibler, and Bristol indicated they had attended a meeting of
the SCLC recently in Atlanta, Georgia, where Martin Luther
King and other SCLC personnel discussed the Washington Spring
Project. It was apparent that those three individuals had
been scheduled to attend the workshop in the Ohio Union building
for some time.

Reverend Osburn indicated the ‘denonstration in
Washington, D. C., would be composed initially of about 3,000
people from poverty areas in the United States, including whites,

- Negroes, and Puerto Ricans. Those persons would travel to

Washington, D. C., and during the first week or ten days would

“demonstrate on the issues of poverty and jobs. After that

period, the demonstration would pick up the peace issues.

'

Reverend Osburn indicated the Washington, D.C.,

demonstration would be 2 continuous program. The initial

3,000 demonstrators would live in Washington, D.C., and carry
out desonstretions in the offices of Government officials and

in other pieces. In the event any of the original 3,000
demonstrators were removed by arrest or any other reason,
they would be replaced by other persons coming from the same
area from which the original demonstrator had come. 7

Reverend Osburn emphasized that it was believed
this would be the last chance to prove non-violent demonstrations
couig be efiective in obtaining concessions on civil rights
matters, Reverend Osburn stated if that effort failed, black
nationalist .groups would teke over the leadership in civil
rights matters. In connection with that situation, Reverend -
Osburn remarked, "Let's hope this works".

Bibler and Bristol, in their talks to the group
attending the workshop, added nothing new, but supported the
statiments made by Reverend Osburn. All three speakers made
frequent favorable references to Martin Luther King.

It was determined that Bristol anticipated there .
would 32 a Cincinnati, Ohio, group participating in the”
Washington, D.c., demonstration.

Bibier yointed out what he believed the civil
rights movenent had to accomplish to be effective. Bibler
Listed those as follows;

1. Gather informat ion

3. Edueation of people.

3, Negotiations.

4. Confrontation snd demonstration
5. Reconciliation. : :

Bibler was somewhat critical of peace groups and
gdaicared he feit they had not accomplished anything.

During the worksho;, it 2as brought out that there
tec two main points involved in the technique of civil disobed. .:ace;

RE: WASHINGTON SPRING PROJECT —CONFEDENTIAL—

eS _—————

1. Non-cooperation with an unjust law.

2. Non-cooperation with a just law to emphasize
an unjust situation not regulated by law.

Bristol pointed out that the technique of blocking
traffic was a case in which the traffic laws were just, but
it could be used to emphasize a situation inw lving an unjust
jaw. It was mentioned that as a technique, the demonstrators
ip Washington, D. C., could tie up traffic. That could be
accomplished without breaking a law, because while there are
laws which require a person to obey a stop light, there are no
Jaws requiring a person to drive on the green light.

A brochure, "Training In Non-Violence," published
by the Fellowship of Reconciliation, was available at the
workshop. A bookiet, "Theory and Practice of Civil Disobedience,"
by Arthur Harver, Centerbury, New Hampshire, also was avail-
able, and a charge of fifty cents for that booklet was requested.

The yorkshop concluded at approximately 10:30 p.m.
on January 20, 1968. Most of the persons present indicated
they would rtturn for the meeting on January 21, 1968, inas-
much as many of the twenty-six individuals present appeared
to ve Ohio State University students.

. On January 19, 1968, Pat Shafer had emphasized
that selection of individuals to attend the workshop on January 20
and 21, 1968, should be done with great care, and persons
attending would be expected to have the ability to return to
tneir own areas and hold workshors on non-violence.

KING. Working with WOODALL at the hotel is one THOMAS FISHER,

a Negro male, born April 9, 1937, residing at 1219 N. W. 66th
Street, Miami. According to BOURGET, FISHER appears to be a
supporter of KING rather than agitator.

detail with Sergeant EVERETT KAY, Imtelligence Unit, Miami,
Florida, Police Department, amd every effort is. being made to
insure no trouble develops as a result of uoeoenhe attitude

gation, to report that he is currently employed at the Four
Ambassadors. He reported that Dr. MARTIN LUTHER KING will be
Staying at the hotel in the near future. He went on to
relate that he had been questioned by members of the Southern

was going to picket Dr. KING when KING arrives in town.
WOODALL stated that he informed SCLC that he had no plans to
picket KING cr to do anything against KING shite KING's visit
to Miami. .

On February 9, 1968, MM T-1, who has furnished
- reliable information in the past, advised that ALPHONSO WOODALL
i is well known to him. He reported that WOODALL is violently
opposed to all that Dr. MARTIN LUTHER KING stands for and
that it could be expected that WOODALL will attempt some type
of protest, during KING’s visit to Miami. MM T~1 reported
that he has no positive information in this regard, but will
be alert for any unusual activities on the part of WOODALL.

MM T-1 reported that a close friend and associate
- Of WOODALL is THOMAS WASHINGTON, a Negro male, described as.
a "disciple" of ADAM CLAYTON POWELL. He said WASHINGTON comes
from the Liberty City section of Miami and is the type of
individual who would assist WOODALL in demonstrations against
Dr. MARTIN LUTHER KING.

Washington Spring Project
Racial Matters

A confidential source, who has furnished reliabk Vy
information in the past3~learned on February 8, 1968,

that on that date WilliamRutherford, Executive Director
of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC)
“was in contact with Stanley Levison. Rutherford told
Levison that he had been in Philadelphia attending a
meeting, that there are some very important things going
on in Philadelphia, and that the situation there is the
best situation "we" have going. However, the source was
unable to ascertain clarifying information about the
situation in Philadelphia that Rutherford referred to.

The source continued that Rutherford advised
Levison that the situation in Washington, D.C, was confused.
He noted that they (SCLC representatives) held a couple
. of meetings "with Rap Brown and his commandos occupying
the place with walkie talkies and bodyguards". He added
that "they invaded this church and took it over. They
wouldn't let people in,! He said that "they" threw the
press out of the meeting and that “they walked out of the
meeting, disrupted it, occupied the church, and literally
, kept SCLC Board members out." The following morning,
. according to Rutherford, a picture of Stokely Carmichael
- appeared on the front page of the "Washington Post",
captioned "Stokely Carmichael Discusses Washington Campaign '
with King" (Martin Luther King, President of the SCLC). ¥

Washington Spring Project

Rutherford related that the day following the
church meeting they (SCLC officials) held a private
meeting "with these guys" and "lit into them", Rutherford
stated that he told Stokely(Carmichael) that he, Rutherford,
wanted to hear what Stokely had to say and that Stokely
gave some "mealy-~mouthed excuses" that did not stand up.
Rutherford also noted that he told Carmichael that "these
men told us" that they are interested in the total
destruction of the United States.

Levison commented that he had heard patios say
this and Rutherford's comment was that "this is what
Rap (Brown) said last night". Rutherford continued
that Stokely is now "Sweet as pie. He pulled a power play
on us in Washington", but did not win anything because
everybody was opposing him, — '

7 Levison commented that he could not see the SCLC
letting ten persons who threaten violence take over from
hundreds. He described it as a dangerous thing, a king of
black facism,

Rutherford, in referring to the meeting, related
that a person named Courtland (phonetic),whom he described
as having been with the Congress of Racial Equality, made

.’ the statement that "they" would not support"our campaign"

: in Washington, D,C,, but would not participate in any
opposition to it; ‘He said this is "their whole life", that
although they could not take part in something they do
not believe in, even though they have trouble from their
constituents, they would not oppose it because anything
that leads to liberation, is worthwhile.

Rutherford said that King became very upset after
this private meeting and began berating him. He said he told
King that what "they"said is clear and that the SCLC knows
now where they stand, that all the SCLC wanted and needed

NW 68262 Docld:32989577 Page 422 : ' H



oe eS eee
oe @

Washington Spring Project : :

"from them" was that they would not attempt to divide

the community. He said "they" were honest, that "they"
stated that if the SCLC fails in Washington, "we're going
to get a lot of new recruits" but if the SCLC is successful
"we are going to be in trouble". He recalled that at

this moment King made a point, that if, "they" should
denounce the government, denounce the SCLC campaign and
criticize it, this would create an atmosphere within which
non-violence would have a better chance of succeeding,

He added that Stokely responded that they have enough
problems, that there is enough confusion and division

in the black community, and that, if they should speak
out against King or what he is doing, people will not
know which way to turn.

Levison commented that he agreed with Carmichael
and disagreed with King on this point. He inquired as to
why King was upset.

Rutherford stated that King said the enemy was
violence and began to preach on how violence begets
violence,

Levison related that the key is that King states
the enemy is violence which is not true. The enemy are
the forces preventing them from getting rights and violence
is one of the methods. He said that, therefore, they are
trying to develop a counter technique to violence.

"The Worker", an East Coast Communist newspaper,
in its issue dated February 11, 1968, page one, contains
an article on the protest against United States involvement
in the war in Vietnam in Washington, D.C. on February
5,6, 1968, sponsored by the Clergy and Laymen Concerned
About Vietnam, It states that King addressed the gathering
of clergymen and laymen and told them that "it was imperative
that the freedom and peace movements be joined. Describing
the worsening economic conditions, he appealed to the
religious leaders to join and support the demonstrations his
organization has planned for Washington in April". The
article also notes that King made it clear that the targets
of the demonstrations would be the Vietnam war and Congress.

‘ WASHINGTON SPRING PROJECT (WSP) ”
RACIAL MATTERS

A confidential source, an agency which collects
security type information in the Chicago area, advised as
follows, on February 8, 1968:

On the evening of February 2, 1968, a meetin;
was held at the offices of the West Side Organization tis0) ,
Chicago, for the purpose of affording Martin Luther King,
Jr., an opportunity to solicit support from WSO members
v2. the Washington Spring Project (WSP), being promoted
and organized by King's Southern Christian Leadership
Conference (SCLC). Bs publicly described by King, the
WSP is an effort to mobilize large numbers of persons
in Washington, D. C., in April, 1968, in protest of
alleged United States Government failure to solve the

. problems of the poor in this country.

As it developed, King did not appear. It.was
announced King's wife was ill.

Approximately 95 persons were present.
Appearing for King at this meetirgwas Reverend Ralph
Abernathy, SCLC official, and Reverend James Bevel,
of the Urban Training Center, 40 North Ashland, Chicago,
former SCLC official in charge of the Chicago SCLC staff.

Both Bevel and Abernathy advised those present
of the purposes of the WSP, and requested support for
and participants for it. There was no response at all
evident to appeals of either Bevel or Abernathy, to ~
the evident disgust of both.

RE: WASHINGTON SPRING PROJECT : -CONPIDERTEAR—

Both related that the demonstrators would set
up tents on the White House lawn, in Washington, and
that everybody who participates should be prepared to go
to jail. Bevel advised that the White House does not
belong to President Johnson, that it was God given to
the people. Bevel and Abernathy advised they would remain
in the "confines" of the White House, until Congress
agrees to such as a guaranteed annual income for black
people. : : : :

Josephine Baker, described by source as a former
well-known entertainer, now residing in France, was also
a guest speaker, She stated she had experienced a
difficult time getting back into this country. She had
marched with Dr, King on his earlier march on Washington,
and as a result it appeared she was not’ wanted here.

She described the importance of the tent-in on the

White House lawn, and urged all those présent to

. participate. Her remarks, according to the source, were
also received by those present with no enthusiasm, and
no apparent volunteers. :

Regarding James Bevel, a second confidential
source, who has furnished reliable information in
the past, advised in March, 1966, that Bevel had
recently been present at offices of the West Side
Chicago W.E.B. Du Bois Club. Discussion concerned
the recent notification that the Attorney General
of the United States intended to label the DuBois
Clubs as a communist front. Bevel advised he would
have ignored this notification, feeling that if the
DuBois Clubs have a real program of help for the
people, then the people would answer for the clubs,
despite any labels.

Most present agreed that the attack on the
DuBois Clubs was a part of the plan of the
"establishment" to undermine the civil rights -.
movement, orily a beginning which would lead to
a full attack on the SCLC, the real target.

RE: - WASHINGTON SPRING PROJECT >. CONPEDENTEAE—

' One of those present stated during the course
of the discussion that he was not a communist, to
which Bevel replied that every thinking American
should be. He advised that Negroes have not begun
to read yet, but when they do, they will all
be socialists.

The W.E.B. DuBois Clubs, local and national,
are characterized in the attached appendix pages. Sources

National Organizational Secretary, stated the Party believes the
DCA should have a working-class outlook and be a mass organization
favorable to socialism, socialist countries and Marxism, and in
April, 1967, advised that GUS HALL, CPUSA General Secretary,
indicated the DCA primary emphasis should be on developing mass
résistance to the drait. a

A third source advised in September, 1967, that JARVIS

WASHINGTON SPRING PROJECT

On February 5, 1968, BH T-1 advised that Rev. F. L.
Shuttlesworth was to have participated in a leadership meeting
in Washington, D, C., on February 6, 1968, regarding Rev.

M. L. King's planned march in April. BH T-1 said Rev. Shuttles~
worth has stated he does not look with favor on any coalition
between hippies, radical-pacifists, draft card burners, black
power exponents and the civil rights organization because he
cannot conceive of anything short of violence taking place

when these type factions get into a demonstration.

i BH T-1 said Shuttlesworth recently stated, "It would
‘be impossible not to get the wrong people in such a march and
once. violence got started you couldn't control it." According
to BH T-1, Shuttlesworth intends to raise questions about the
wisdom of King's widely publicized Washington demonstrations
‘for April, BH T-1 said Shuttlesworth feels that Rey, king will
try to find an honorable way to back down from the planned
demonstrations, Rev. Shuttlesworth said the country is in no
condition to stand "that type of thing" but he is opposed to
the Vietnam war and also to draft card burning.

It is-noted that Rev, F. L, Shuttlesworth is president
of the Alabama Christian Movement for Human Rights, a pro=-
integration organization with headquarters in Birmingham,
Alabama, Rev, Shuttlesworth presently resides in Cincinnati,
Ohio,

Pitts' Motor Hotel, 1451 Belmont Road, N, W.,. Washington, D, C, ]

The February 8, 1968, edition of the "Washington Post
and Times Herald," a daily Washington, D. C., newspaper, reported
that King had met with leaders of the SCLC and SNCC on the night
of February 7, 1968. Among SNCC representatives who reportedly

; Henry Brownlee and J. T, Johnson were introduced as
SCLC representatives working in Washington, D. C. on behalf of
the Washington Spring Project (WSP).

King was introduced by Reverend Jesse Jackson, SCLC
representative from Chicago, Illinois. King spoke for approx-
imately thirty minutes asking support of Washington, D. C,
residents for the WSP. He did not discuss specific plans for
,the WSP but did describe it as a "wait in" with the indication
that the demonstrators would remain in Washington until satis-
factory results were obtained.

: King stated the "hard core poor" would come to
Washington for the project and would continue the demonstration
until some type of action was taken by Congress, assuring them

of jobs or income, 7 .

King indicated no violence was planned for the project
but did state that whatever action necessary would be taken to
achieve their goals, ‘ : i:

POSSIBLE RACIAL INCIDENTS 1

CHICAGO, ILLINOIS,

AUGUST, 1968

RACIAL MATTER

Reference is made to Chicago memorandum of
February 2, 1968, under the caption, "Washington Spring
Project (WSP), Racial Matter," which in part reflected that
Martin Luther King, Jr. was to be in Chicago on that date
where he was to appear as a speaker for the West Side
‘Organization (WSO), a small West Side Civil Rights group
in Chicago.

On February 5, 1968, a confidential source,
which collects intelligence information in the Chicago area,
advised that Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., President, Southern
Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC), headquartered in
Atlanta, Georgia,- had arrived in Chicago at 11:20 a.m, on this
date from Atlanta, via Delta Airlines Flight 614. King was
accompanied by SCLC officers, Reverend Andrew Young and
Reverend Ralph Abernathy.

A second confidential source, who has furnished
reliable information in the past, advised on February 5, 1968,

This document contains neither recommendations
nor conclusions of the FBI. It is the property
of the FBI and is loaned to your agency; it and

that King was in Chicago at this time generally to provide
impetus to the local organizing efforts in behalf of the
WSP, a program whereby the SCLC plans to mobilize large
numbers of persons in Washington, D.C, during April, 1968,
to protest United States Government failures to solve the
oblem:
MY. prob Ss of pthe poor. |

be “Eee In this connection King reportedly planned to meat with
GeorgeWiley, believed to be from New York City, and who is
head of the National Welfare Rights Organization (NWRO). The
NWRO is currently holding a three-day convention in Chicago.

According to this source, Wiley was at a recent
meeting in New York City, New York, where support for the
WSP was solicited by SCLC personnel; however, Wiley would not
agree to participate in this SCLC project. King's contact
with Wiley in Chicago, therefore, will represent an effort to
persuade him of the importance of lending his support to the
WSP.

This source, as well as the first source, advised
| 7 King has no known public appearances scheduled while in
Chicago other than a press conference to be held sometime

| during the late afternoon or evening of this date, King is
also not known to have any meetings scheduled with the local
SCLC staff; however, it was expected that in all probability
“he would meet individually with some key local personnel

in connection with the WSP.

No information was available to either of the
above sources concerning King's departure plans from Chicago,
although it was anticipated he would depart Chicago during
the late evening hows of February 5, 1968, or early on
February 6, 1968.

Both sources advised that King did not appear in
Ghicago as scheduled on February 2, 1968, at the West Side
Offices of the WSO. ‘|

Chicago's press media, on February 5, 1968, carried
articles relating to a press conference held on that date in
Chicago by King. Xerox copies of articles relating to this
press conference are attached to this memorandum, namely, from
the "Chicago Sun Times" and the "Chicago Daily News," both
daily Chicago newspapers,

These articles are self-explanatory as to content;
however, it might be noted that information is contained therein
relating to Dr. King's possible participation in demonstrations
at the Democratic National Convention, which is to be held
in Chicago in August, 1968, as well as possible demonstrations
on May 12, 1968, and June 30 and July 1, 1968, nationwide, by
the NWRO, The latter is described in one of these articles

_ as a new welfare organization, representing some 6,000 dues-
paying welfare recipients.

Sergeant John P, O'Malley, Human Relations Unit,
Chicago Police Department, advised on February 6, 1968, that
the Chicago Police Department was cognizant of King! Ss presence
in Chicago on February 5, 1968, and of the general content

‘advised that no incidents or disturbances had occurred in Chicago
in connection with King's presence here.

and Stanley Levison were to meet with Leon Davis and
Moe Foner at their office, 709 Eighth Avenue, New York
City, . to discuss the Washington, D, C. project and
how Foner and Davis can make a contribution.

“The same source advised on February 3, 1968,
that on that date, Stanley Levison and William Rutherford,
Executive Director of the SCLC, discussed a list of :
contributors (to the SCLC), lLevison stated he had
examined this list and that there are no big donors on
it. Rutherford mentioned that a suggestion had been
made of having a group meeting of the larger contributors
and having someone talk to them and solicit contributions.
Levison suggested Andrew Young as the person to handle
, this matter.

Rutherford inquired if Levison would be in
Washington, D. C. on Tuesday (February 6, 1968) and
Levison was uncertain, noting that he was supposed to
meet with "two staff guys" to bring them together with
"a staff guy from 1199" (Local 1199, Drug and ae

he was not,"

The article also noted "In recent years he has
‘also become increasingly involved in the civil

WASHINGTON SPRING PROJECT -CONPEDERNPIAL-

The discussion in this conference began with the
subject of financing the WSP. Also discussed were the merits
of having Martin Luther King make a speech during the WSP.
Stokely Carmichael stated that he is in favor of the goals
and aims of the WSP and that he would support this project
wholeheartedly. However, he insisted that his organization,
SNCC, and any other organization which would take part in
this project, would keep their own identity separate from
SCLC. This was agreed to by the representatives of SCLC,

During the above discussion, George Wiley entered
the room in which the conference was being held, and after
listening to the conversation, stated that his organization,
the National Welfare of Rights Oganization, could not support
and participate with SCLC in this project under the conditions
stated. A considerable time was then spent in an effort to
convince Wiley to support this project, however, he stated
that before agreeing to give his support, it would be necessary
that he discuss this matter personally with Martin Luther King,
President of SCLC,

A copy of this communication is being provided
to the following local agencies:

United States Attorney, Chicago, Illinois;
United States Secret Service, Chicago, Illinois; and

Region I, 113th Military Intelligence Group,
Evanston, Illinois.

Concerning Jesse Gray a second confidential source
advised in January, 1964, that according to a high level
official of the Communist Party in New York, :Gray was no
longer a Communist Party member but remained friendly to
the Communist Party.

WASHINGTON SPRING PROJECT
RACIAL MATTER

A confidential source previously advised that
during the middle of January 1968 while addressing
members of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference
(SCLC) staf£ who will be responsible for recruiting and
training demonstrators for SCLC's Washington Spring
Project (WSP) Reverend Martin Luther King, Jr., President,
SCLC, made it very clear that SCLC did not contemplate
paying expenses which might be incurred by these demonstrators.

On February 1, 1968, source advised that as of
that date SCLC had made no plans which would provide living
accommodations for the demonstrators who will be in
Washington, D.C. As of this time, most SCLC officers
felt the demonstrators in all probability could sleep
in tents pitched on the grounds of various Government
buildings.

“SECRET—
Washington Spring Project i
Racial Matters naa

A confidential source, who has furnished reliable
Tmation in the past, learned on January 31, 1968, that on
y at date, Stanley-Levison was in contact with William
Rutherford, Executive Director of the Southern Christian
Leadership Conference (SCLC). Levison noted that he-mst
recently with Harry Wachtel, Clarence Jones, Bayard Rustin,
and Mike-Harrington, and that Rustin "showed his true
colors" by opposing civil disobedience. He said Rustin is
“also opposed to involving the war issue.

Levison, in referring to the civil disobedience
campaign, planned by King, for Washington D.C. (WDC), in the
Spring of 1968, felt that tactics must be agreed upon in the
near future so that persons who have been making.inquiry can
be told what tactics will be used.

3

Rutherford told Levison that And¥ Young (Executive
_ Vice-President of the SCLC), had written out some of the
“tactics to be used. He said that, for example,during ‘the
first week, calls will be made on Congressman by people from
17 a@ifferent areas. During the second week, calls will be
made on heads of departments such as the Secretary of Labor.

’ On the first visit, demands will be made and on the second,
a sit-in will be conducted. cca *:

With respect to a prorysed civil rights newspaper,
Levison feels it should follow the formula of "The Southern
Courier", which, he said, can humanize the news without
vulgarizing it. He emphasized that, although SCLC policy
must be the policy followed by the newspaper, efforts must
be made to avoid a dull, uninteresting style.

Rutherford noted that King has an SCLC Board mee eane
on Tuesday, and Wednesday, (February-6 and 7, 1968)
‘clergy march-on Monday, and a private meeting with istokely)
Carmichael and with other Black leaders in WDC, and then
will go to Philadelphia "and do the same thing". Rutherford
added "meet once with the ministers and once with the. Black
Power people to try to neutralize them".

The source advised that he gathered the impression
that the above described activity by King will be in connection
with organizing for the spring civil disobedience campaign

_ in woe,

Levison and Rutherford also discussed financial
contributors to the SCLC. Levison said he had suggested to
King that they get about 25 contributors together and meet
with them for several days and let them ask King as many
questions as they careto. Levison stated that he would check
the list of contributors and check with Rutherford as to
where they should hold this meeting since it should depend

- on the residence of most of the contributors.

A confidential source, who has furnished
reliable information in the past, advised
Sn April, 1964, that Stanley Levison was
a@ secret member of the Communist Party,
United States of America (CP,USA), in
July, 1963. In late 1963 ‘and early 1964

PH T-1 and PH T-2 is Lieutenant GEORGE, FENCL,,PHPD,
Civil. Disobedience,.Unit,. who requested that his identity not
be disclesed outside the Bureau. He was assigned two symbol
numbers and two dates to further conceal him because there has
been no publicity in the press re the presence of ORANGE

and TABB in Philadelphia. He also advised that he had

, learned from a very highly placed delicate source that

ORANGE had said that Dr. MARTIN LUTHER KING of SCLC is
intending to come to Philadelphia in late March or early

April 1968 and that Dr, KING will make a concerted effort

in Philadelphia itself to:

(1) Get Police Commissioner FRANK L. RIZZO ousted;

(2) OLtain real open housing for Negroes in Phila-
delphia;

(3) Obtain employment for the unemployable Negro
in the ghetto; : :

(4) Renovation of the school system in Philadelphia
so that it better meets the needs of the Negro in Philadelphia.

It should be noted that this information was received
from Lt. GEORGE, FENCL, 1/26/68, prior to Philadelphia receipt
of the information in Atlanta teletype to Bureau 1/18/68
(Xerox ce to Philadelphia) which included the Dr. KING -
schedule of visits to "target" cities.

Lt. FENCL,also advised that his source had said
that Dr. KING had some intention of coming to Philadelphia
in early January during the hearing in U. S. District Court,
EDPa., seeking the removal of Commissioner RIZZO because of
his alleged mishandling of a Black Student Rally. KING decided
not to come to Philadelphia because the Judges hearing the
case were bending over backwards to give the plaintiffs a
fair hearing. -

WASHINGTON SPRING bincaaassia
RACIAL MATTER :

On January 25, 1968, a confidential source : wey :
advised Reverend Martin Luther King, Jr., President, . +E
Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC),
recently discussed with several officers of SCLC a
meeting of the SCLC Executive Board to be held in
Washington, D. C., on February 6 and 7, 1968. He said
several matters of an administrative nature would be
discussed at this board meeting which would include
recent personnel changes as well as SCLC financial
matters.

Reverend King mentioned that during the SCLC
Executive Board meeting he plans to meet with Stokely
Carmichael of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating
Committee (SNCC), or if this cannot be conveniently
arranged he will endeavor to meet jointly with Carmichael
and H. Rap Brown, National Chairmen, SNCC, in New York
City following conclusion of the board meeting. He
commented that in order to meet with Brown he would have
to go to New York City because current legal procedures
restrict Brown's freedom of movement. Reverend King said
he would discuss with Carmichael and/or Brown SCLC's
Washington Spring Project (WSP) and assistance (not .
-specified) which SNCC can give to this project.

Confidential Informant T-1 stated that Albert
Turner made a plea for 300 Alabamians to prepare to go to
-Washington to take part in the Washington Spring Project
this April. .Turner said that Negroes must join in with
Dr. King because the SCLC is at a very low ebb and in danger
of-a'takeover by Black Power advocates. Turner made known
that he came to Birmingham from Detroit where violent forces
claim that last summer's burnings were small compared to what |
they plan to do this summer. Turner said tmt if these forces
try to destroy Detroit, that the entire Civil Rights movement
will be lost and the leaders killed or put in jail. Turner
told the group that Rev. M, L. King, Jr's. program of civil
disobedience does not call for lying down‘in the streets but
merely "sitting in." However, Turner stated that participants
should be ready to be jailed.

ALL sources used in this communication have
furnished reliable information in the past. ‘
i cv T1 advised on December 3, 1967 that he
recently learned that during the week commencing
November 27, 1967 the Southern Christian Leadership
Conference (scic) held a retreat ab Penn Center, Progmore,
South Carolina, which was presided over by Rev. MARTIN
LUTHER KING, JR., President of SCLC and was attended ©
by approximately 70 individuals comprising the headquarters
and field staff of SCLC.

The primary purpose of the retreat was to discuss
- various facets of SCLC’s plan to conduct massive non-
violent demonstrations in Washington, D. C. and pessibly
@ number of other cities during the early part of 1968.

Reverend KING outiined this plan to these attending
the retreat; namely, that it had been tentatively decided
that in the forepart of February, 1968, he, together with
other officers of SCLC and in all probability leading
representatives of other Civil Rights organizations (not
identified) would personally present to the Secretary of
Labor specific requests for prompt Congressional action
pertaining to employment, income, housing, education, and
other matters which constitute major problems experienced

i by ghetto people.” In the évent these requests do not
receive an immediate unequivocal commitment insuring «-
prompt Congressional action, an immediate massive non-+
violent demonstration would commence in Washington, D. C.
.This demonstration would be conducted by SCLC and involve
adults from all walks of life, including students and
school children. If an effort is made by civil and/or
military authorities to quell this demonstration, simultaneous

RE: WASHINGTON SPRING PROJECT (WSP)

CV T-1 was not aware of the identity of all the
"target cities" referred to by Rev. KING but he understood
Cleveland was one of the cities included.

CV T-1 went on that according to Rev, KING that
during the period prior to early February, 1968, one oz
two SCLC staff members would be assigned to Washington,
D. C. and each of the "target cities." It will be the
responsibility of these members to select in each community
ug to 200 individuals who will serve as leaders for .
demonstrations. This type of individual sought will be
unemployed Negro males, whose general economic status is so
low that they could lose nothing by participating in the
proposed demonstrations. After selection of these indiviuuais
it would then be the responsibility of the SCLC staff member
through mass meetings, workshops cr other procedures to
indoctrinate these individuals with SCLC's overall
objectives and technique of non-violent demonstration.
Rev.--KING emphasized that the individuals so selected’
should be Negroes, however, he said once each demonstration
is actually commenced the assistance of white persons
would definitely be accepted and possibly solicited.

OEE CARRERE

Sree:

‘a Sesame

Reverend KING acknowledged this program of
demonstrations was. avery substantial undertaking for SCLC
to embark upon. He said it was imperative that SCLC be.
successful in this undertaking because otherwise not only
would it be embarrassed by a failure but failure itself”
would in a large sense serve as a victory for thé "Black
Power" groups. In this connection, he said it would be
necessary to solicit the cooperation of "Black Power” ~
leaders (not identified) in order that such organisations
would permit SCLC to conduct its program without inter-
ference. He said he was extremely concerned over the
probability that such interference might easily turn any
demonstration into a riot. He declared that if such a
Situation developed in any one of the communities in which
SCLC contemplates demonstrating SCLC will immediately
cease all its activity in that community.

of the "Black Power" organizations could be obtained and
raised a question as to whether the selection of up to

200 individuals in various communities might not present —

a@ most difficult task. Reverend KING responded by statirg ~-
he was most confident ne could obtain the desired cooperation
of "Black Power" leaders. He said he realized these people
did not agree with his methods or the activities of SCLC

but is confident they have sufficient respect for him to
listen to his requests. He also said he was quite confident
that people, after being apprised of SCLC's objectives,

will be anxious to assist. Furthermore, he expressed optimism
that once the demonstrations commence there will be sufficient
sympathy on the part of the general public that SCLC will

will receive adequate financial support.

CV T-1 subsequently learned that Rev. KING had
informed SCLC staff members that this new activity would
be called Washington Spring Project.

CV T-1 also advisea on December 19, 1967 that
he recentiy learned that various assignments had been
made of SCLC members to various cities in the United
States in connection with the forthcoming WSP and the two
being assigned to the Cleveland area were EDDIE-OSBURN Site

Atlanta, Georgia, for the purpose of discussing and planning
strategy regarding SCLCs WSP which it conteiplated
initiating in early April, 1968. In attendance were oe
approximately 35 individuals, who were SCLC staff members.
At one of the sessions it was mentioned that in all
probability Congress would not acceyt” or act on the
demanés presented by SCLC. If this happens, it was then
planned to begin protesting this refusal by maans of
disrupting various agencies and facilities throughout ~
Washington, D. C. for example one group was tentatively
scheduled to tie up the Washington Greyhound Bus Stetion
utilizing such tactics as lying down in front of buses,
blocking entrenees and exits, etc, It was expected that”
numerous arrests would be made of the participants of this
projeet end it was pointed out that the participants must
be "totally committed" to the project and be willing to
‘risk arrest. It is even possible that some persons may
be killed and the participants must be prepared to spend’
up to six months in jail; however, it was not desired that

On January 17, 1968, CV T-1 also furnished ~
information regarding the SCLC conference held at Atlanta,
Georgia from January 15-17, 1968; source added that during
the conference, Rev. KING said there was no doubt that
the requests that would be presented to ‘the various
government agencies would receive a non-committal type aa
response. Then 200 demonstrators previously recruited by
SCLC in approximately 15 communities will then commence
& massive non-violent demonstration in Washington, D. C.

In conjunction with the activity of the

approximately 3000 demonstrators in Washington, D. C.,
SCLC contemplates that in each community from which these
demonstrators come there will be sympathetic simultaneous
demonstrations. These demonstrations will be participated
in by individuals who do not go to Washington, D. C. but
experience the same problems and seek the same solutims
as the demonstrators in Washington. SCLC intends that the
demonstrators will not be intimidated in their efforts
by injunctions or other legal measures degigned to serve’
as deterrents. The demonstrators will submit to arrest and
incarceration without bail, however, the place of an incar-"
. cerated demonstrator will be assumed by another demonstrator.
Rev. KING felt the WSP would praduce affirmative action
pronptly on the part of Congress regarding jobs or income
for Negroes.

CV T-1 advised on January 18, 1968 that he’ ~°° 7”
learned Rev. KING planned to visit the various target cities
in connection with the WSP during February and March, 1968
and his schedule indicated he would be in Cleveland on

RE: WASHINGTON SPRING PROJECT (WSP)

which apartment is also the headquarters of the SCLC
in Cleveland at present. The other members of Rev. KING's
staff who had been working in the Cleveland area have been
moved to other cities throughout the country.
CV T-1 had also learned that Rev. OSBURN had
been out of town for some time as he had been attending
an SCLC conference in Atlanta along with 150 other people
but that OSBURN returned to Cleveland on January 18, 1968.
OSBURN mentioned on his return thatlm would have to get the
"ball rolling" in Ckveland on the WSP indicating that ©
nothing had been done as of January 18, 1968 to organize
this project. .

cV T.3 reported on January 25, 1968 that le
learned that following Rev. OSBURN's attendance at the
SCLC conference in Atlanta on Januery 15-17, 1968, he
returned to Cleveland but then made another visit to
Atlants for additional instructions regarding Cleveland's
role in the WSP. On returning again to Cleveland, Rev.
OSBURN indicated that his organization now planned to
recruit approximately 200 distressed people in the ghetto
ares of Ckveland to participate in the WSP in Washington,
D. CG. These people who will be unemployed and have nothing
to lose would not have the funds to make this trip or ‘to
stay in Washington, D. C. but SCLC will make money availabie
to them. Rev. OSBURN went on that he planned to open a
storefront office at E. 79th and Hough area, Cleveland,
Ohio, on January 26, 1968, which is in the heart of the
most depre: area of Cleveland and the center of the

Hough area riots. In addition Rev. OSBURN plans to issue”
a brochure in the near future setting forth the aims, etc.
of the WSP,

WASHINGTON SPRING PROJECT
RACIAL MATTER

On January 17, 1968, a confidential source
advised he had learned that the Southern Christian
Leadership Conference (SCLC) on that date concluded
a retreat which was held January 15, 1968 -

January 17, 1968, at the Ebenezer Baptist Church,
Atlanta, Georgia, of which Church Reverend Martin
Luther King, Jr., President, SCLC, serves as co-pastor.
This retreat was concerned with SCLC's Washington
Spring Project (WSP) which it contemplates initiating
early in April 1868, In attendance were approximately
50 individuals, about one-half of whom were SCLC field
representatives from various locations,

Reverend King pointed out he did not have
any desire that SCLC should have any friction with
"Black Power groups" during the course of its WSP,
He said the basic issue of the WSP was jobs or income
and the validity of this issue could not be argued by
“"Black Power groups" or anyone else. He said SCLC
weuld simply go about its business of implementing

. the WSP. 7

Reverend King declared that in the event
SCLC is not successful awakening the conscience of the
nation to the urgent neéd for jobs or income through
the WSP the nation will subsequently Have to admit that

SCLC made a substantial effort in this regard. in the
| ‘event of such failure, Reverend King said there could
apeaeataes be no question that the "Black Power groups" would benefit
appreciably.

specified) to the Department of Labor relating to jobs or
income for Negroes and other persons currently in Ghetto areas.
Similar requests will be presented to other Sovenanent departe
‘nents (ot identifies) also.

Ke said there is no doubt that these requests will
receive a noncommittal type response which will also point
to the Congress of the United States as being the obstatie
which has prevented or will prevent the particular department

demonstration’ im Washingtom, D. C. Source was not able
to advise what time element may ezist between presentation
of Reverend King’s requests, arrival in Washington, D.C.,
of “demonstrators , and commencement of the demonstration.

Reverend King pointed cut that the demonstrators
will also be expected to presemt to their respective semators
and/or representatives requests for affirmative congressional
action to correst problems existing in their own local
Communities.

Im conjunction with the activity of the approximately
3,000 demonstrators in Washingtom, D. C., SCLC contemplates

Serer

that in each community from whieh these demonstrators come
there will be sympathetic simultaneous demonstrations. These
demorstrations will be participated in by individuals who |
_do not go to Washington but experiemce the same probiems
and seek the sane solutions as the demonstrators in

z agton, D. C. The local demonstrators may be purely of
: iuntary pature or may have been organized by SCLC field
representatives previously.

prcerosens

Source recalled that during a discussion regarding
the USP by several officers of SCLC a short time prior to
this retreat an officer inquired of Reverend King what
position SCLC would take if effort was made to “run" the
demonstrators out of that city. This question was immediately
answered by Hosea Williams, Director of Voter Registration
and Political Education, SCLC, who stated to the effect
SELC sisply wo not entertain the thought of being “rum out".

Reverend King in reference to demonstrators

the demonstrators should stay im the office of the semator

.Revefrend King explaimed at this retreat that the.
¥SP is expected to produce affirmative action promptly
on the part of Congress regarding jobs or income. This,
he said,wiil result from Congress acting on its own initiative

the Bureau may wish to note that Atlanta airtel and

meeting of the SCLC Executive Staff held 11/21-22/66
for the puxpose of considering methods of raising
funds for SCLC, This meeting was attended by STANLEY
LEVISON, During that meeting, LEVISON suggested SCLC
-seriously consider the sale of SCLC memberships
through the assistance of JAMES HOFFA, President,
of the Teamsters Union. During his discussion of this
matter, LEVISON made effort to differentiate between
_ professional groups and the working class by explaining
that it will be the working class, not the professional
people, who ultimately will look to SCLC for assistance
in seeking "social change" (not defined). LEVISON weat
on to point out that SCLC could use HOFFA's wide influence
in the labor field together with its working class memberships
as a practical lever when seeking "social change".

WASHINGTON SPRING PROJECT
RACIAL MATTER 7

On January 17, 1968, a confidential source
advised he had learned that the Southern Christian .
Leadership Conference (SCLC) on that date culminated
a three-day retreat held in Atlanta, Georgia. This
retreat was held in facilities of the Ebenezer
Baptist Church of which Reverend Martin Luther King,
dr., President, SCLC, serves as co-pastor and also
attended by approximately 50 individuals. Approximately”
one half of the individuals in attendance were SCLC
field representatives from various locations. A
representative (identity not known) of the American
Friends Service Committee attended this retreat.

NE RE

ot
far ee

Reverend King served as the presiding officer

at the retreat, the essential purpose of which was twofold.

m First, to afford SCLC staff members opportunity to fully
understand the objective of the SCLC Washington Spring
Project, discuss anticipated problems and seek solutions
therefo. Secondly, to permit Reverend King to infuse
SCLC staff members with enthusiasm to participate in the +
project in order that it will be a success.

who will recruit demonstrators to participate

in the Washington Spring Project. James Bevel,
former Director of Direct Action, SCLC, and

Hosea Williams, Director of Voter Registration

and Political Education, SCLC, actively participated
in these discussions. Both Bevel and Williams have
had considerable experience in the area of Civil
Rights demonstrations.

1 Re emergent ce

Reverend King lectured several times
during this retreat concerning the overall purpose
of SCLC's Washington Spring Project. He pointed
out this project would be predicated on the issue
of jobs or income for Ghetto Negroes and impoverished
people of all races in the United States, However,
he emphasized this would not solve all the problems
experienced by the Negro, particularly those
regarding ‘inequality and therefore the Civil Rights
Movement as a whole will have many things to achieve
as years go by.

Acquiring jobs or income for Negroes alone,
Dr. King declared, will be 4 noteworthy achievement
on the part of the Washington Spring Project, however,
he stressed that the jobs or the income obtained would
represent a mere fraction of that which America owes
the Negro throughout history. He said America owes an
incalcuhble sum to the Negro who throughout his long
years of involuntary servitude labored to build this
country.

Dr. King stated that the many problens of the

Negro and other poor people will not be solved under

a Capitalistic systen. Capitalism,he said, has no remedy

for the poor. The ultimate aim of all agerieved people

in the United States can only be to accomplish a change
iuaaana in the existing Capitalistic economy and Government.

He suggésted this change might be to “some form of

Socialistic Government", Reverend King did not discuss

in any detail how or when the change he referred to

might be accomplished.

WASHINGTON SPRING PROJECT

On January 17, 1968, curing his closing
comments at this retreat Reverend King emphasized
to the SCLC staff that the forthcoming Washington
Spring Project will be one of the most difficult
tasks which it to date has undertaken and
accordingly challenged the staff to maintain itself

both willing and able in order that the project will
be successful.

Reverend King refersed to how Jesus found
it necessary to send His disciples on various misSions.

He told the members of the SCIC staff that they were
"Ris disciples",

JAMES BEVEL

BEVEL, im early March, 1966 was observed to be

‘ present at the offices of the West Side W.E.B. DuBois
Club in Ukicago (BCC). Discussion took place at this time
centering around reaction to a recent notification that
the Attorney Generali of the United States intended to
label the DuBois Clubs as a Communist front. BEVEL,

in conversation, stated that he would fave ignored this
notification, and kept about tke work im which he

was engaged, He felt that if the DuBois Clubs have a.
real pregram of help for the people, then people would
answer for the clubs despite any labels applied to them.

Host present agreed ‘that the attack on the et
DuBois Clubs wae a part of the plan by the "establishment"
to undermine the civil rights movement. They felt that™
the recent hearings imto Klan activities in this country was
only a beginning which would lead to a full attack on the
Southern ©: an Leadership Gomtezense (SCLC), the real

! ‘target. Ome of these prosent stated during the course

of this discussion that he was not a Communist, amd to this
BEVEL was overheard to reply that every thinking American
shéuld be. Ee stated that Negroes have not begun to read
yet, but wren they do, they will a11 be socialists.

¥.E.B, DU BOIS CLUBS OF AMERICA (DCA)

: A source advised that on October 26-27, 1963, a
conference of members ef the Communist Party, USA (CPUSA),
including national functionaries, met in Chicago, Illinois, for
the purpose of setting in motion forces for the establishment of
a new national Marxist-oriented youth organization which would
hunt for the most peaceful transition to socialism. The delegates
were told that it would be reasonable to assume that the young
socialists attracted into this new organization would eventually
pass into the CP itself. :

A. second source has advised that the founding convention
for the new youth organization was held from June 19-21, 1964, at
150 Golden Gate Avenue, San Francisco, California, at which time
the name W.E.B. DuBois Clubs of America (DCA) was adopted.
Approximately 500 delegates from throughout the United States
attended this convention.

: The second source advised in September, 1966, that MIXE
ZAGARELL, CPUSA Youth Director, stated that in Negro communities
the Party still supported the plan to build "left" socialist
centers and to solidify the Party base through the DCA. This
source also advised in September, 1966, that DANIEL RUBIN, CPUSA
National Organizational Secretary, stated the Party believes the
DCA should have a working-class outlook and be a mass organization
favorable to socialism, socialist countries and Marxism, and in
April, 1967, advised that GUS HALL, CPUSA General Secretary,

-, . indicated the DCA primary emphasis should be on developing mass
‘resistance to-the draft.

A third source advised in September, 1957, that JARVIS
TYNER was elected chairman of the DCA on September 10, 1967, at
the Third National Convention of the DCA held in New York, New
York, from September 8-10, 1967. .

A fourth source advised during August, * 1987, that.
JARVIS TYNER is a member of the National Committee of the CPUSA.

A fifth source advised on September 21, 1967, that the
* headquarters of the DCA is located at 34 West 17th Street, New
York, New York.

“on Jaruary 16, 1968, Lieutenant GEORGE -FENCL, Philadelphia
Police Department, Civil Disobedience Unit, advised that on

January 11, 1968, JAMES ORANGE, who was ‘associated in some. way with-
Dr. MARTIN LUTHER’ KING and the Southern Christian Leadership:
Conference (SCLC), was identified in Philadelphia and surveilled
throughout the day, It was determined by the surveillance that
ORANGE was staying at 6540 Lincoin Drive, Philadelphia,: which was the
residence of Dr, ROBERT ANDERSON, novfurther identified by the
Philadelphia Police Department at this time.

During the evening hours, ORANGE went to the Universal
Church of Restoration at Gorgas Lane and Stenton Avenue in Philadelphia.
ORANGE and another individual went into the rear of the church. 4
list of license plates of other individuals'. automobiles who entered
the church that evening was obtained by the Philadelphia Police Depart-
ment. The registered owners of these automobiles are being checked
by the Philadelohia Police Department.

About 11:30 p.m., ORANGE left the church with an unidentified
Negro male in a2 1959 or 1960 Chevrolet, Tennessee license JJ8626, This
license was subsequently determined to be that registered to JAMES E.
WOODRUFF, 3211 Batavia Avenue, Nashville, Tenn. ‘The Reverend JAMES E.
WOODRUFF is presently employed by the Episcopal Diccese of Pennsylvania
in the Race Relations Section of the diocese. The Reverend WOODRUFF
is also the individual who was involved in the summer of 1966 with

~"the Liberation School in Nashville, Tenn., in which the Chief of Police

of Nashville, Tenn., alleged that the Liberation School, which was
funded in part by the Federal Office of Economic Opportunity, was
teaching "hate whitey" classes.

ORANGE was observed driving a 1965 Pontiac sedan, Illinois

license KT3925, which later investigation determined was registered to

On January 12, 1968, ORANGE was spot surveilled by the
Philadelphia Police Department, however as of mid afternoon
Saturday ORANGE could no longer be located. 5

On January 17, 1968, confidertial informant PH T-1,

he had received unverified information that an individual
identified only as ORANGE had been at a mecting sometime around
the middle or latter. part of December at the St. Thomas Episcopal
Church, 52nd and Pine Streets in Philadelphia during the evening,
meeting with civil rights leaders in Philadelphia. I¢ was PH T-l's
understanding that ORANGE represented Dr. MARTIN LOTHER KING and
the SCLC in regard to KING's coming project scheduled for the
spring of 1968 in Washington, D.¢. end other cities. The gist
of the meeting was to the effect that if Philadelphia civil rights
leaders were to support Dr. KING's presence of SCLC in Philedelphia
sometime in early 1968, that any money collected through SCLC
‘efforts in Philadelphia would be used in Philadelphia rather than
being taken out of the city for the National Headquarters of SCLC
as had been done on a number of former appearances of Dr. KING in
Philadelphia. :

PH Tel had no information as to whether or not this was

WASHINGTON SPRING PROJECT
RACIAL MATTERS

MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR., president, Southern Christian
Leadership Conference (SCLC), has publicly announced he will
conduct a massive civil disobedience campaign. in the Nation's
Capitol the first week of April, 1968,. in ax effort to pressure
Congress into passing legislation favorab to the Negro.

On March 5, 1968, GOLDEN ASRO\FRINKS, Field Secretary,
SCLC, was interviewed by Agent of the FBI at his residence
122 West Peterson Street, Edenton, North Carolina. FRINKS said
that he is pleased with the progress that Congress is making
with the proposed civil rights legislation, but he said that
even if legislation is passed, this will not change SCLC's
plans for a march on Washington, D. C. FRINKS pointed out that
Dr. MARTIN LUTHER KING has not spelled out his demands as yet —
and that they will include much more than just a housing law. |
He suggested that one of the demands might be that all persons
are assured a minimum income which would be paid by the Federal
government, His concept of this plan would be that the number
of days per year an individual is employed by private industry
would be subtracted from the total in the year and then the
government would pay the balance. He said that it would be the
government's responsibility to provide the work they wish these \
individuals to do, even if it be only menial labor. He said that 4
it would also be the government's responsibility to enforce this
plan to insure that the persons are actualiy doing the work.

reer

With regard to the march, he said that he has 21 paid’
employees working for him throughout the State of North Carolina,
He said that these individuals are not being paid a salary but
subsistence only. He said that these people were unemployed
and that they had nothing else to do, therefore they were willing
to work on that basis. FRINKS: advised he would provide the
nares of the 21 paid employees in about one week. He said-he
did not have their names at the time of interview. :

FRINKS said that these 21 persons are recruiting others
to go to Washington, D. C., for the march and act as squad cost
leaders, guides, etc. for the masses who will follow. He said
that his paid employees have a goal of 200 such persons and
that 18S have trendy pen reer teg After the recruitment:
drive is complete, only @ i "31 will remain on the
payroll. . i

FRINKS said that he and his group of about 200 will
leave North Carolina on April 15 or 16, with a planned arrival |
in Washington, D. C., on April 22, 1968. Concerning transportation,
he said that the means of transportation has not yet been worked
out. He said he has given consideration to buying old busses
or cars, but the busses especially do not seem to be available.
FRINKS said there has been a suggestion to drive to a distance
of 100 miles south of Washington and then walk the rest of the
way. There has also been the suggestion to walk the entire way.
FRINKS said he personally prefers to go by bus or car if possible,
stopping in the small towns en route. He hopes to set up tents
at night along the way. He mentioned the town of Suffolk,
Virginia, as a possible first night stop. He commented that he
also hopes to set up tents in Washington, but he feels that they
will be prohibited from doing this.

Upon arrival at Washington, D. C., FRINKS believes that
Dr. KING will be there to meet them. Shortly after their
arrival, he believes that KING will make his demands and then
call all Negroes to Washington who have grievauces. The hard
core group of squad leaders and guides will be stationed at
the entrances to the city and at the Federal buildings and
direct each incoming group to the office building that should
best be able to handle their particular grievance. FRINKS
estimated that the demonstrations in Washington will last about -
three weeks, _ Perea

FRINKS advised that he and Dr, KING are very much
concerned about STOKLEY CARMICHAEL and the Student Nonviolent
Coordinating Committee (SNCC) trying to interfere or take over
once the Negroes are in Washington. He said CARMICHAEL's
presence represents violence and the communist influence in the
Civil rights movement. He said Dr. KING spoke with CARMICHAEL
during the last week in February and has a promise from him that
he will not interfere with the plans of SCLC. FRINKS advised
that KING plans additional talks with bre lec FRINKS said
if he does come, "we will bust his head," .



+ Beebe DH

RE: WASHINGTON SPRING PROJECT St

FRINKS said that his headquarters for this march is at.
his residence or at his office located above the Credit
Union Building, 405 Broad Street, Edenton, North Carolina.

He pointed out that he is still working for Dr.
REGINALD HAWKINS in support of his campaign for governor.
He said that he is finishing a seven weeks leave of absence,
but believes that this will be extended for an additional seven
weeks. He said the campaign is badly in need of money; however,
there are many more supporters than originally expected. He~
mentioned that his telephone bill for his residence telephone
was over $1,000, and that it has been disconnected.

It was observed that FRINKS was driving a Light blue
recent model Dodge, four-door, bearing 1968 North Carolina
License TJ-123 and a plastic sign on both front doors which
reads, " HAWKINS FOR GOVERNOR, Candidate for Hope and Progress."

Reverend SAMPSON also indicated that participants
in the demonstrations by extremist black nationalist groups
from New York would be under a pledge of non-violence. The
staff was now arranging sites and equipment for the camp-in
which was scheduled to last until Congress énacts adequate
anti-poverty bills.

The "Los Angeles Times", a daily newspaper published
in Los Angeles, California, in its issue of 2/29/68, carried
an article which editorialized about the camp-in promised or
threatened for April. The article stated that everything was
to be "non-violent" but there were threats of "non-compliance"
with the law and plans to block the entrances of Government
buildings, Experts were allegedly to be trained elsewhere and
then to be brought into Washington.

The article also indicated that the fear is that after
a few days, the more violent, trouble making leaders will take
over and that violence will almost be certain, with the prospect
of direct clashes, if not between civilians, then almost certainly
between the campers and the authorities.

This article stated that nobody believes that Congress
is going to be intimidated and the obvious outcome is certainly
to be increased frustration.

The article stated that it is impossible to see how
anything but trouble can come of this. The participants are
seeking impossible goals, and to get them to perform they are
being deliberately goaded into taking part in what is nothing
more or less than mob pressure to try to force action by the
Government. No Government, no matter the circumstances, can
afford to be intimidated by mob action, and the belief is
growing that this is exactly what will happen when the extremist.
leaders step in to take over after the initial "peaceful demon-
stration" fails to accomplish its advertised purpose.

bt Re Los Angeles airtel to Bureau, 2/23/68.

: : The “Herald-Examiner", a daily newspaper
published in Los Angeles, California, in its issue of
2/23/68, on page a8, carried an article which was

datelined at Los Angeles, on 2/22/68. The article

indicated that the Reverend Dr. MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR.

had made a pact last week with two "black power"militants,

H. RAP BROWN, Chairman of the Student Non-Violent Coordinating
Committee, and his predecessor STOKELY CARMICHAEL.

The Reverend ALBERT R. SAMPSON, the Chief Aide ey
to Dr. KING, said that BROWN, the advocate of "guerrilla ag
7 war on the honkie white man", and CARMICHAEL, the spokesman,
for “total revolution by Negroes", had agreed not to fight 4
Dr. KING's poor people's .campaign to camp-in in Washington
early in April, 1968.

Reverend SAMPSON indicated that CARMICHAEL had
agreed to march with Dr. KING on the latter's own terms -
non-violence. Dr. KING had acknowledged, according to
this source, that his non-violent effort.could generate
rioting and he had begun consultation with the objective of

. preventing trouble.

Attached for your approval for dissemination are
copies of a communication containing the results of a .
conference held at Miami, Florida, by Martin Luther King, Jr.,
President, Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC),
to train Negro ministers in urban leadership.

BACKGROUND:

Recently the Ford Foundation publicly announced
they were providing the SCLC with a grant of $230,000 to
train Negro ministers in an effort to develop responsible
leadership in the Negro ghetto areas of the Nation's major
jcities, ©

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS:

King held the first of a series of two workshops
at Miami, Florida, from February 19-23, 1968. Approximately
150 Negro ministers throughout the United States attended
this conference, A large amount of time was spent at the
conference discussing ways of putting economic pressure on
the white community to create more jobs for Negroes, :

The delegates held different opinions as to the
_ methods to be used in solving the problems of the civil
rights Fovement. The majority favored the nonviolent approach.
,, | One of those advocating a more militant approach was Reverend
4L James‘Bevel, an aide to King. Reverend Bevel stated he believed

in burning down the cities if something significant wouldte .
accomplished, but he did not believe in burning just for the
sake of burning.

-Concerning religion, Reverend Bevel advised he did
not believe in the virgin birth of Christ, He advised he was
firmly convinced that "Mary" was raped by a Roman soldier,

ie :
Te Another, miki tant minister in attendance was
Reverend James Ey|Woodruff of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania,

other source advised that there was a marked
tendency on the part of SCLC to move away from integration
and move toward economic and political black power,

During the conference some members of SCLC attempted
to gain support for King's massive civil disobedience campaign
scheduled in early April, 1968, in Washington, D. C. Most
ministers attending gave their reluctant approval to this
program.

‘ The majority of the delegates in attendance were
‘}opposed to the militant approachto solving the problems of
the civil rights movement as advocated by Stokely Carmichael,
former Chairman of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee.

RECOMMENDATION:

Miami, Florida, reported on February 22, 1968, that the
Ministers Leadcrship Training Program continues along
guidelines ‘previously set out with little or no discussion
relating to the Washington Spring Project.

- On February 21, 1968, the Miami Office of the
Federal Bureau of Investigation received an anonymous
‘telephone call from a male who inquired if the Federal
Bureau of Investigation. was aware that MARTIN LUTHER KING
was in Miami, Florida. The caller stated he intended to
kill KING and would like to bomb KiNGts room at the Sheraton-
Four Ambassadors Hotel, Miami, Florida, but feared injuring
other people.

Sergeant JOBN WEAVER , Miami, Florida, Police
Department, on duty at the Sheraton-Four Ambassadors Hotel,
“reported cn the evening of February 21, 1968, that the
_ Switehboard operator in the hotel received a similar
- anonymous call shortly before 8:00 PM on February 21,
1968. The caller made reference to a terman lugar that
he wanted to kill MARTIN LUTHER KING with and/or blow
up the hotel.

On February 21, 1968, BOB ASHAUER, Chief Security
Officer, Sheraton-Fcur Ambassadors Hotel, tentatively
‘identified hotel guest HAROLD CHARLES MALCHMAN from Hyannis,
Massachusetts, aS possibly being resporsible for the anonymous
call, however, on February 23, 1968, ASHAUER advised that
NALCHMAN had been eliminated as being responsible for the
anonymous calls threatening MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR.

Dear Sir:

It continues to be a mystery why our government allows a black
power leader the freedom to plan revolution.

If the White House and Justice Department "fear" the results of
Martin Luther‘King's April march on Washington and Carmichael's
Involvement in it why can't steps be taken to prevent this event?

It appears that we must fight communism in Vietnam, but not in hy

. _Fear is growing among top offici-
als in the White House and Justice
Department that Dr. Martin Luther
King's April march of the poor on
] Washington will result in a stun-

' ,ning victory for Stokely Carmichael.

With only six weeks to go, little of
the detailed and massive planning
necessary for King's April campaign
has been done. Thus, in the opinion.
,of Administration strategists, there
is a golden opportunity for Carmi-
chael to step in and gain primacy
among Negro leaders, Indeed, King
in desperation may even invite him
-to take a leading role in the
planning, with obvious implications
rfor the future.

Moreover, King's ill-considered

Package deal, baby, steal my thun-
j- der — you take my Jightain 7

Darcy In Philadelphia Bviletin
campaign exactly coincides with the
‘new Leninist phase—in many ways
‘the most dangerous phase — of
_Stokely Carmichael's swift ascent to
the top. He has retumed from
c travels in the Communist world no
_longer preaching revolution in the
: Streets but quietly implementing V.
I.-Lenin's tactics of coalescing with
‘non-revolutionary social reformers
‘—such as King. .

What makes King particularly
susceptible to Carmichael's embrace
cis his present desperate’ condition
within the movement. Once the
country's most prestigious Negro
leader, he has been declining since
the failure of his Chicago campaign
of 1966, The April march of the poor
‘is widely regarded in Negro circles
as King's last opportunity. Chuck
Stone, a shrewd black power strate-
gist_and an ally of Carmichael,,has

fed it *Custer's last stand," . s

. and Lenin-

ind ROBERT NOVAK .

But, King, never mugh_of an’
administrator, has nardly begun to”
attack the mass of detail needed to
bring thousands of poor Negrees to
Washington and house, feed, and
Jead them. King badly misses Bay-
ard Rustin, chief planner for the
1963 march on Washington, who is
nayestranged from King. -——=

Furthermore, as Justice Depart-

ment officials well know, King has a
story of surrendering “control to
the better organized extremist ele-
ments in a critical situation. This
was precisely what happened during
the Selma, Ala., march in 1965 when
the Student Non-Violent Coordinat-
+ ing Committee (SNICK) forced King
to the wall and seized control.
Nor are Administration officials
- alone in their apprehension. King's
more moderate lieutenants—such as
the Rev. Walter. Fauntroy, vice
chairman of the new Washington
* City Council—have from the begin-
ning feared that control of the April
march would go to the extremisis.
The decision by Carmichael's new
Black United Front to endorse the
"aims" of the King campaign has on-
ly fanned the fears. For Carmichael,
it avoids all responsibility for a pos-
sible fiasco but positions him pe
fectly totake command if the oppor-
tunity arises.

Indeed, mere formation of the
Black United Front follows the Len-
inist line now followed by Carmi-
chael. Whether or not Carmichael
himself actually read Lenin during
his long travels in the Red world
last year, he returned to this coun-
try a changed man. Once contemp-
tuous of non-radical Negroes, he im-
mediately proposed formation of the
Black United Front—a front of both
revolutionary and non-revolution-
ary elements along classic Leninist
lines.

Moderate Negro leaders here have
been uncertain about their reaction
to Carmichael's overtures. Carl
Moultrie of the NAACP and Sterling
Tucker of the Urban League attend-
ed the first meetings of the front
more to keep an eye on Carmichael
than anything else. In a private con-
versation, Tucker told Carmichael
he realized each was trying to hood-
wink the other. }

Dear Sir:
i had written a letter to

could not enact a law to hold Martin Luther
King and his unruley crowd out of our
national shrine this summer, There was
about six monkHs at the time to get ready.
The senator says they do not need
to enact a new law, all they need to do
is enforce the laws that are now on the books,
He states that polit‘’cs have so taken over
that tose who should are timid about enforcing
the laws,

Iapveal to you on this as I have
had great admiration for you- and everyone is
concerned about the riot that Martin Luther
King is stirring up- to be pulled off in

Washington belongs to the people
of the United States, and I hate to see it
desecrated, :

I appeal to you, as head to

Dear Mrs. Philpot

Ihave received your letter of February 6th and
certainly understand the concern which prompted you to contact
me.

With respect to the matter you:mentioned, the
affording of protection and the maintaining of order are not within
the scope of this Bureau's authority. The FEI is strictly an inves-
tigative agency of the Federal Government and, as such, does not
exercise any control over marches,” demonstrations and similar
activities.

I want to assure you, however, that we in the FBI
will continue to discharge our duties with the highest degree of
thoroughness and dispatch in every area where we have an inves-
tigative responsibility.

‘Sincerely yours,

Carmichael's organizing is growing rapidly and this is of
great concern to the professor.

RACIAL MATTERS 7

i by
: On January 22, 1968, GOLDEN ae Field

Secretary, Southern Christian’ Leadership Conference (SCLC),
was interviewed at his residence at Edenton, North Carolina,
by representatives of the FBI. FRINKS related that he is
ranked seventh oy-eighth in thé SCLC chain of command, and
he recently: attended conferences in Atlanta, Georgia,
concerning forthcoming activities of SCLC. He said at the
present time, he is on loan from SCLC to the North Carolina
gubernatorial candidate, Doctor REGINALD A.VHAWKINS, from
Charlotte, North Carolina. He said in this regard, he.

will travel in North Carolina, te the towns of Pantego,’.
Wilmington, Fayetteville and Durham attempting to form ,,
a coalition between the Negroes and the poor whites. 7
FRINKS was not optimistic that HAWKINS would be elected,

but he stated if he were elected, it would be a great:
stride forward for civil rights and. tend to retard outbursts
of violence and riots.

FRINKS stated while in Atlanta recently, he

met with Doctor MARTIN LUTHER KING and other civil rights
workers from SCLC, Student Non-Violent Coordinating
Committee ({SNCC) and the National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). He said the purpose
of this conference was to pian demonstrations and a strategy
for Washington, D. C., this spring or summer. He said

7 SCLC hopes to. have immediate. pyssage- ef certain civil
rights legislation, but if this is umsuccessful, Dector
KING will call for this demonstration. He said another

Dr. JAMES UDY, Ohio Northern University, Ada, Ohio,
who was in charge of the program featuring Rev. MARTIN LUTHER
KING at Ohio Northern University, chartered a plane from Lima,
Ohio, to pick up Rev. KING at Cleveland, Ohio, at 7:30 AM,
1/11/68. Rev. KING then gave his talk at Ohio Northern
University trom approximately 10:30 AM’to 11:30 AM, at the
University gym, which was attended by 2200 people plus 500 more
who listened over the public address system at the University
Auditorium.’ Rev. KING in his talk discussed poverty, housing
for Negroes, Negro unemployment, rat control, etc.; KING
suggested and condoned civil disobedience to bring about
better conditions for Negroes. KING made reference to a recent
statement of ADAM CLAYTON POWELL that Rev. KING advocated
violence at this time and KING denied that this was so, as he
does not condone violence in the civil rights movement.

Further along in his talk Rev. KING mentioned that
his group was planning massive demonstrations in Washington,
D. C., and five other major cities, including Cleveland, in
the Spring and Summer of 1968, to get action to aid Negroes
inthe United States; KING gave no details of this project.

According to Chief ELWOOD, there were no problems,
_incidents, etc. in connection with Rev. KING's visit to
Ada, Ohio, and KING departed that city during the early
afternoon of 1/11/68, for Cleveland, Ohio, and New York City.

Cleveland sources could not furnish any information
that Rev. KING spent any time in the Clevelarid area on either |
1/10 or 11/68, nor have they seen any indication that there
has been any planning or activity in Cleveland on Rev. KING's

‘Washington Spring Project. ‘ :

aeeut Cleveland will continue to follow this matter closely
and will keep the Bureau and interested agencies advised of
‘pertinent developments.

who listened over the public address system at the University
Auditorium. Rev. KING in his talk discussed poverty, housing
for Negroes, Negro unemployment, rat control, etc.; KING
suggested and condoned civil disobedience to bring about
better conditions for Negroes. KING made reference to a recent
statement of ADAM CLAYTON POWELL that Rev. KING advocated
violence at this time and KING denied that this was so, as he
does not condone violence in the civil rights movement.

Further along in his talk Rev. KING mentioned that
his group was planning ‘massive demonstrations in Washington,
D. C., and five other major cities, including Cleveland, in
the Spring and Summer of 1968, to get action to aid Negroes
in the United States; KING gave no details of this project.

According to Chief ELWOOD, there were no problems,
incidents, etc. in connection with Rev. KING's visit to
Ada, Ohio, and KING departed that city during the early
afternoon of 1/11/68, for Cleveland, Ohio; and New York City.

Cleveland sources could not furnish any information
that Rev. KING spent any time in the Cleveland area on either
1/10 or 11/68, nor have theg seen any indication that there
has been any planning or activity in Cleveland on Rev. KING's

‘Washington Spring Project.

Cleveland will continue to follow this matter closely
and will keep the Bureau and interested agencies advised of
pertinent developments.

REMARKS OF SENATOR JOHN L. McCLELLAN
RELATING TO THE MARCH ON WASHINGTON

-_
Pop gh

Mr. President, the so-called "Poor People's March on Washington"

is a matter of deep concern to every law abiding citizen of our country.
a The stated intentions of the leaders of the march are to

| assemble in this. city many thousands ‘of demonstrators--no one seems to
know how many there will be--in an atmosphere and under conditions which
are calculated to lead to civil disorders and violence. I quote one of
their leaders, the Reverend A. D. King, brother of the late Martin Luther
King, speaking on April 21, 1968: "We are going to Washington and ~*

disrupt Washington so it cannot function unless it does something about

ve Sani Fame pelea sia pate eta a

black people." On May 2, Reverend Abernathy, in addressing an audience

in Memphis, stated "we are cowing to Washington to turn Washington
downside up and upside down." There have been other serious threats

os
which were obviously intended to intimidate and coerce important officials

of the government.

On April 25, 1968, less than two weeks ago, the’ Senate

Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations held a conferente with the’

officials of the Federal and District of Columbia Governments to discuss

this March on Washington.

Present at the conference were members of the Subcommittee and
the following Federal officials: Attorn-y General Ramsey Clark; Secretary
of the Interior Stewart-L. Udall; Under Secretary of the Army David
McGiffert; General Ralph E. Heines, Jr., of the U. S“ Army; Major General
Charles L. Southwerd of the National Guard; and Major General William Be

Yarborough of U. S. Army Intelligence. District of Columbia officials

oe All American citizens have the right to peacefully petition

The purpose of the conference was to ascertain what policies
and procedures these governmental agencies propose to follow in preventing,
controlling or supervising this demonstration. Specifically, we wanted
to learn what actions had been taken or would be taken to maintain lav and
order in the District of Columbia during the march, to assure that the
orderly processes of government will not be disrupted or halted, to
protect the citizens of the city from physical harm and their property
from damage and destruction, and to prevent the outbreak of violence as
@ consequence of the masa demonstrations which have been announced.

All of us are aware, through our mail and telegrams, that the
uation is deeply disturbed about the possible consequences of this march,
Our people have a right to know whether the goverment is making the
preparations necessary to avert another period of violence in our
nation's capital, or whether there is procrastination on the part of
responsible heads of government. We would like to know whether needed -
and firm decisions are being deferred and unduly delayed during this
period of tense conditions in the wake of the recent rioting. The city
has had more than 50 instances of suspected arson since April 15.

In my opinion, the President of the United States has the
obligation and responsibility to announce promptly and firmly to those
who are coming to Washington to participate in the demonstratiors,
that lawlessness, disruption of government, and incitement to rioting
and violence will not be tolerated. The time is getting short; the
marchers are already on the way. Word from the President should go out

immediately to the entire nation that the Government of the United States
in its capital city will not be subjected to intimidation, humiliation
and disruption, and thet any attempt at violence, rioting, burning and
- plundering in the city of Washington will be promptly met with such

force eas way be necessary to prevent or to quell such acts.

—<e

permitted to employ intimidation and coercion or to resort to evil

disobedience and violence to impose its will or to achieve its aims.
If this is tolerated, law and order will be destroyed and a sdfe and
peaceful society will surely perish.

In his press conference of May 3, the President acknowledged

the dangers attending this march. When he was asked about the march

by a news reporter, he made the following comments about the possibilities
of violence: "We hope that the presentation made will be nonviolent
although WE ARE WELL AWARE THAT NO SINGLE INDIVIDUAL CAN GIVE ANY
ASSURANCE THAT THEY CAN CONTROL A SITUATION LIKE THIS. JT CONTAINS MANY
INHERENT DANGERS. We are concerned with them. We have made extensive
preparations." Most regrettably, however, the President failed to take
advantage of the opportunity in his press conference, on nationwide
network television and before the assembled White House press corps,

to sound a firm warning to the marchers, and especially to their leaders,

cet eCARRINMAIN le SUOMI BAN 0"9 Paha Ped SAR MIAR RI Hh ott

and to give positive assurances to the American people that civil
disobedience, rioting, leoting and burning will not be tolerated-~that
such force as may be necessary to deal with violence effectively will
‘be positively and promptly used.

Mr. President, the Subcommittee today is releasing the

transeript of the conference of April 25 so that the public can be fully

informed and alerted to the dangers that are inherent in this impending
demonstration under a leadership who, as I stated previously, have
announced that they are coming here to "turn Washington downside up end
upside down."

The Attorney General was urged by the Subcommittee to seek

redress in the courts by injunction to prevent the marchers from resorting

to violence end civil disorders. The many public statezents made by the

leaders of the march alone would warrant the granting of such injunction,

NBV 68262 Docld:32989577 Page 839

power of the courts to enjoin and prevent the threaténed disorders ana

lawlessness in our nation's capital. It is of the utmost importance
that all possible steps be taken to meet the dangers and challenges this
impending march imposes.

The transcript of the conference makes clear that some of the
important decisions have not yet been made and that adequate planning is
far from complete. For example, we do not know where the marchers will
be allowed to build their "shantytown," because that decision has not
been made, or if made, has not been announced. The statements of
Secretary Udall indicate that the decision about the granting of a
permit for a “shantytown" will be a policy decision made in conjunction
with other high level authorities. Does this mean that the decision
and responsibility for permitting the building of a "shantytown" will be
in the White House? Will the marchers be permitted to pitch their tents
and build their shacks on the Mall or on the grounds around the Washington
Monument? We do not know, because we were informed in the conference
that no application for @ permit had been submitted and no decision had
yet been made, : autt

T have also been advised by Secretary Udall thet as of this
morning no request for a permit had been submitted. However, I read in
this morning's paper a statement by a leader of the march thet they
yropose to utilize Federal property of their choosing without a permit
and without having requested a permit.

Apparently, the leaders of this march intend to defy the
authorities and deliberately violate the law for the purpose of provoking
an ineident. In my opinion, this is contrary to every proper concept
of peaceful assembly. Instead, it is a premeditated act of contempt for
and rebellion against the sovereignty of government.

It is also clear that no one in authority knows how many persons
are coming or exactly where they are coming from. There may be +100, 000,

demonstrators on the streets on Memorigl Day, May 30, according to



| { I sincerely believe that a positive and unequivocel warning
to that effect should be given to the marchers and their leaders who are
waking dire threats of what they intend to do when they get here, and
such reassurances should be given to the entire nation by the President
himself, so the American people can know that this city is not faced
with shame and disgrace because of lack of purpose and determination
on the part of our government to prevent it.

The probability of violence exists, Mr. President. Indeed,
there is reliable information thet it is actually being planned by certain

militant advocates of violence who will swarm along the marchers’

teen hor

routes and will move into the "shantytowns" when they are erected.

During the conference, I asked the Attorney: General if he

Eeetrmeseris

had information that militants are plotting now to cast eside the ate
Reverend Ralph Abernathy and take over the mass demonstrations once
the marchers reach Washington, He said that he was not familiar with

any such information.
: The Subcommittee has received sworn information that this is

Wideman oe

actually being planned, and this information comes from within the :
militant movement itself. There are militant leaders, now on the road }
or ready to march with their followers towards Washington, who have
boasted to their followers that, once they arrive here, they will control
their own groups end incite them to rioting and violence. They are
bragging that they will not leave Washington without new wardrobes
which they will acquire when the looting starts. They say that some
of their group will be armed with switch-blade knives and hand guns.

Some of the men who are doing the planning and making these
threats are given to violence and have criminal records. Some of them
have been charged with serious crimes. One of them said in s meeting

of his group, "The only good white man is a dead white man," and "Pick

The transcript discloses information which is highly important

to the Auerican taxpayer, A three-judge Federal District Court in the

District of Columbia on Novexber 11, 1967, struck down the District's

requirement for one year of residency in determining eligibility for

welfare. Judges Bazelon and Fahy concurred in the decision;

Judge Holtzoff dissented strongly and argued that the requirement was a

safeguard against the possibility that this city would become a ‘Mecea i"

for migrants." : {

The transcript shows that the Public Welfare Department of

the District of Columbia intends, under present policies, to provide

food or food stamps for those who declare theuselves to be destitute,
5 to provide shelter for those who state that they have none and have no funds

to provide it for themselves, and to process applications for other

specific forms of welfare desistance. In fact, if any marcher states

that he is destitute and without _ necessities of ute, the Public

Welfare Department will furnish hin with a cash grant up to $100 in

some cases, to support him for one month, Recruits for the march are

deing told to go to Washington one night and get on welfare the next

day. : : :

There are sone statements in the transcript which are somewhat

Yeassuring, The Under Secretary of the Army, Mr. McGiffert, told the
Subcommittee that the Army is ready and able, under Presidential order,

to commit large mmbers of troops to the city at very short notice to

handle any contingency which wight arise.

The ‘Attorney General informed us that “any unlawfiness will

“be mat vith adequate law enfoxcenent to control 4t." He vas asked
about the predictions which most of us have heard that the bridges

The Subcommittee has evidence, Mr. President, that certain

‘\. REMARKS OF SENATOR JOHN L. McCLELLAN
RELATING TO THE MARCH ON WASHINGTON

Mr. President, the so-called "Poor People's March on Washington"
is a matter of deep concern to every law abiding eitizen of our country.

; The stated intentions of the leaders of the march are to
assemble in this city many thousands of demonstrators--no one seems to
know how many there will be--in an atmosphere and under conditions which
are calculated to lead to civil disorders and violence. I quote one of
their leaders, the Reverend A. D. King, brother of the late Martin Luther
King, speaking on April 21, 1968: "We are going to Washington and = *
disrupt Washington so it cannot function unless it does something about
plack people." On'May 2, Reverend Abernathy, in addressing an audience
in Memphis, stated “we are coming to Washington to turn Washington
downside up and upside down." There have been other serious threats
which were obviously intendea to intimidate and coerce important officials

of the government. 7 :
On April 25, 1968, less than two weeks ago, the’ Senate

Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations held a conferente with the’

officials of the Federal and District of Columbia Governments to discuss

this Merch on Washington, ci

os

* : Present at the conference were members of the Subcommittee and

the “ollowing Federal officials: Attorney General Ramsey Clark; Secretery

of the Interior Stewart L. Udall; Under Secretary of the Army David
MeGiffert; General Ralph E. Haines, Jr., of the U. Sv Army; Major General
Charles L. Southward of the National Guard; and Major General William P.

Yarborough of U. S. Aruy Intelligence. District of columbia officials

who attended ssere Mayor alte Washington, Directoy .of Public Safety

[Nw 68262 Docld:32989577 Page 843



The purpose of the conference was to ascertain what .
and procedures these governmental agencies propdse to follow in “preventing,
controlling or supervising this demonstration. Specifically, we vanted
to learn what actions had been taken or would be taken to maintain law and

‘order in the District of Columbia during the march, to assure that the

orderly processes of government will not be disrupted or halted, to

Protect the citizens of the city from physical harm and their property

from damage and destruction, and to prevent the outbreak of violence as

Son eR EST ERM

, & Consequence of the mass demonstrations which have been announced.

ALL of us are aware, through our mail and telegrams, that the

nation is deeply disturbed about the possible consequences of this march,

Our people have a right to know whether the government is making the

preparations, necessary to avert another period of violence in our

nation's capital, or whether there is procrastination on the part of

| responsible heads of government. We would like to know whether needed

and firm decisions are being deferred and unduly delayed during this

period of tense conditions in the wake of the recent rioting. The city

hes hed more than 50 instances of suspected arson since April 15.

| : In my opinion, the President of the United States has the

f obligation and responsibility to announce promptly and firmly to those

H who are coming to Washington to participate in the demonstrations,

i é that lawlessness, disruption of government, and incitement to rioting

E . and violence will not be tolerated. The time is getting short; the

Hi marchers are already on the way. Word from the President should ios out

; immediately to the entire nation that the Government of the United States
in its capital city will not be subjected to intimidation, humiliation
and disruption, and that _ attempt at violence, rioting, burning and
plundering in the city of Washington will be promptly met with such

force as may be necessary to prevent or to quell such acts.

and officials for the redress of grievances, and such

resented should be heard and appropriately acted upon.

Alscbedience and violence to impose its will or to achieve its aims,
Tf this is tolerated, law and order will be destroyed and a safe and
Peaceful society will surely perish. EH

Te bis press conference of May 3, the President acknowledged
the dangers attending thig march. When he was asked sbout the march
by @ news reporter, he made the following comments about the possibilities
ef violence: “We hope that the presentation made will be nonviolent
although WE ARE WELL AWARE THAT NO SINGLE INDIVInvAL CAN GIVE ANY

INERENE DANGERS. We are concerned with then. We have made extensive

s of peaceful assembly. Instead, it is a premeditated act of contempt for

power of the courts to enjoin and prevent the threaténed disorders and
lawlessness in our nation's capital. It is of the utmost importance
that all possible steps be taken to meet the dangers end challenges this
impending march imposes.

The transcript of the conference makes clear that some of the

important decisions have not yet been made and that adequate planning is
far from complete. For example, we do rot know where the marchers will ‘
be allowed to build their "shantytown," because that decision has not
been made, or if made, has not been announced. The statements of
Secretary Udell indicate that the decision about the grenting of a
permit for a “shantytown" will be a policy decision made in conjunction
with other high level authorities. Does this mean that the decision
and responsibility for permitting the building of a “shantytown" will be
in the White House? Will the marchers be permitted to pitch their tents
and build their shacks on the Mall or on the grounds around the Washington |
Monument? We do not know, because we were inforned in the conference
that no application for a permit had been submitted and no decision had
yet been made. 7 i

I have also been edvised by Secretary Udall that as of this

morning no request for a permit had been submitted. However, I read in

this morning's paper a statement by 7 leader of the march that they
propose to utilize Federal property of their choosing without a permit ©
and without having requested a permit. :
Apparently, the leaders of this march intend to defy the
authorities and deliberately violate the law for the purpose of provoking

an incident. In my opinion; this is contrary to every proper concept

and rebellion against the sovereignty of government.
It is also clear that no one in authority knows how many persons
are coming or exactly where they are coming fron. There may be 100,000

demonstrators on the streets on Memordél Day, May 30, according to

estimates of the march leaders thenselves~ _

I sincerely believe that a positive and unequivocal warning

* to that effect should be given to the marchers and their leaders who are

making dire threats of vhat they intend to do when they get here, and

such reassurances should be given to the entire nation by the President

himself, so the American people can know that this city is not faced

with shame and disgrace because of lack of purpose and determination

on the part of our government to prevent it.

The probability of violence exists, Mr. President. Indeed,

there is reliable information that it is actually being planned by certain

militant advocates of violence who wiJl swarm along the marchers!

routes and will move into the "shantytowns'when they are erected,

During the conference, I asked the Attorney General if he

had information that militants are plotting now to cast aside the

Reverend Ralph Abernathy and teke over the mass demonstrations once

the marchers reach Washington. He said that he was not familiar with

eny such infornation.

The Subcommittee has.received sworn information that this is

actually being planned, and this information comes from within the

militant movement itself. There are militant leaders, now on the road

or ready to march with their followers towards Washington, who have

boasted to their followers that, once they arrive here, they will control

their own groups and incite them to rioting and violence. They are

bragging that they will uot leave Washington without new wardrobes

which they will acquire when the looting starts. They say that some

of their group will be armed with awitch-blede Imives and hand guns.

, ‘Somé of the men who are doing the planning and making these

threats are given to violence and have criminal records. Some of them

have been charged with serious crimes. One of them said in a meeting

of his group, "The only good white man is a dead white man," and "Pick

twice-a-week garbage pickup
schedule is a thing of the past.
Even after the strike is settled,
he said, the once-a-week pick-
up now in operaton “Will be
permanent.”

The riot damage was esti-
mated by insurance officials at
more than $400,000—not includ-
ing fire and not including
losses due to the interrupted
business days.

Yesterday's_march was in

is the way we wanted it to be
yesterday.” one marcher told
‘an onlooker. “The only reason

infiltrators. If they hadn't

peaceful.”

March leaders worked at

_ Handy—Pagk, fronting on
Beale from Third to Hernando,
Was the quietest place in the
riot-torn area yesterday after-!
noon. National Guardsmen,
were there in strength, but!
pulled out quickly before the,
march began, Jeaving only al
corporal’s guard of about a
dozen men behind.

Tn the warm asphalt of Beale
Street, the rubber-cleated
tracks of -armored personnel
carriers left slashes that
looked like gigantic zippers as
they rumbled off to escort the
slow-moving single-file march
down Main.

The normal sounds of Handy
Park were replaced by an oc-
casional squawk from a police
radio, military orders being
given in conversational tones,
and a hammer in the distance
as another piece of new ply-
wood took the place of a bro-
ken store window, Beale was a
plywood-front street from,
Main to Hernando.

There were other reminders!

of Thursday's rioting. Gu:
men blocked off Bele across,
Main as the marchers tiled by’
— the troopers stand
der-to-shoulder across the
street, their bayoneted rifles:
at the ready. And beaind the
-glass doors of one company,;
store clerks stood silently, dis-
playing the firm's merchan-
‘dise. Four of the clerks were
holding shotguns. :

Other merchants along the:
tmarch route watched quietly
sfrom their doors. There were
-no catcalls, no boos, no heck-
ling. A group of young Negro
«women applauded from a sec-
‘ond-story office near the Malco
Theater. 2»

Mayor Henry Loeb, armed
with a hastity passed state

More than i) troops from.
West and Middle Tennessee
were ordered to Memphis, and
most of them have been on
duty for two days, patrolling
‘the Beale-Main-Hernando area
riding with police officers to
trouble spots or escorting Fire
Department equipment to the
hundreds of fire calls that;
have plagued the area. fl

President Johnson said in
Washington yesterday _that|-
“order must be preserved,” in
his first public reaction to the}
Memphis violence. “The tragic
events in Memphi . remind
{me of the grave peril rioting;
jposes... Everyone loses when}
a riot occurs. “

“{ urge local law enforce-
‘ment to deal firmly, but al-
|ways fairly and without fear,
iwith every infraction of law —
to work unceasingly to prevent

‘control them should they oc-

“If federal assistance is!
‘needed, it is available, but our}
system of government and our
security depend on capable lo-j
cal law enforcement,” the
President said. ianet

Mr. Meany, the nation’s top}
labor leader, said the Memphis}
garbage men are striking “for
simple trade union objec-
tives.” |

“This isa strike for recogn
tion of the union, for a volun-
tary dues checkoff, for urgent-;
ly needed wage increases andi

for an equitable arievance sys]
tem. REP EeeEEer

“It has been the reluctance
of the city government to enter’
into negotiations looking to-
ward a settlement that has sot
compounded the problems of
the city and its people,” Mr.
Meany said. “The AFL-CIO is
willing to lend its good offices
in the search for an honorable
and mutually satisfactory
agreement.””

The sanitation workers are
seeking*to have an AFL-CIO
union, the American Federa-)

The city continued its fight!
to return to anormal routinej
yesterday, although absen-,
teeism in the city school sys!
tem was near 40,000. Among
the truants were 2,300 at Ham-)
ilton High School, where the,
first disorder was reported be-j
fore it began downtown Thurs-
day morning; 1,500 at Booker
T. Washington and Melrose‘
and 1,200 at Douglass. All are
predominantly, Negro schools,

County schools reported nor-'
mal attendance. Roman Catho-:
lic officials said predominantly;
Negro parochial schools were
running as high as 50 per cent}
absent.

Nevertheless, all city schools,
stayed open. so did county of-
fices, although County Com-
mission Chairman Jack Ram-|
say announced at 2:30 that all
women employes of the county
could leave at 3 p.m. So could
male employes if they felt they
must, Mr. Ramsay said,

City bus servi suspended
after one bus driver was at-
tacked Thursday and a num-
ber of bus windows shattered
by bricks, was back in opera-
tion yesterday morning. Mike
Tate, “president of the bus com-
pany, said service would con-
tinue ough the 6 p.m. runs,
and then would discontinue un-
til the next morning, as long as
the curfew is in effect.

No desision has heen made

each other the National Guard,

said yesterday they do not
know how long their tour of.

Earl Lanning, chairman of
the Insurance Council of Mem-
phis, said an on-the-scene in-
spection yesterday by the
Memphis Claims Association
showed more than 200 store
fronts had heen smashed — 155
of them on Beale. The city’s
pei dl ice

glass firms_avere swamped
with repair orders.

Mr, Lanning said his $400, 00
damage estimate does not in-|
clude the fire toll caused by|
firebembs, This total is still
incomplete.

“We estimate &5 per cent of:
the stores attacked were net

looted,” he said. “About 30 per|”

cent had their windows looted!
and about five per cent were
looted inside.”

Dr, King returned to Atlanta!
yesterday, saying he would re-
turn for a “unity meeting” to
plan next week's march. He’
would give no definite date,;
but said it could take place “as
late as next Friday or as early

as next Wednesday.”

He said he did not think the
next march would be marked
with the violence which ac-
curred Thursday morning, The.
staff of his Southern Christian
Leadership Council will come:
to Memphis to help in planning.
the march, he said.

The city’s — and one of the’
world’s — most famous
streets, memorialized in song:
and verse, was a scene of
boarded up windows, broken
glass, scattered merchandise
and armed “guards from Main
to Danny Thomas Boulevard.

Astonishment registered on
the faces of merchants and
their employes as eral
Army personne! carrier
equipped with 50 caliber ma
chineguns rumbled down
Beale,

"Oh, my God,” exclaimed
Michelle Johnson of 1296
higan as she saw the car-
riers. “Please, please.” she
gutped, higjag her face in her
jhands. 7



®

Workingalong with her at
the Schwab Brothers store at
163 Beale were Abram Schwab
and hig daughter, Miss Bever-
ly Schwab, who were cleaning
up the broken Blass.

“What's going to happen?”,
Miss Schwab asked with fear:
registering in her eyes and
face. 1
However, many people
standing near Beale and Her-
nando jeered the guard and
their heavy equipment with, '
“Why aren’t you in Vietnam?" j

Mr. Schwab was cleaning
out the glass and preparing to
‘put up plywood to protect the
“store. “We were lucky. They
only broke out the glass and,
got some of the merchandise.
They didn’t get in the store.”

“prayed for at least 90
minutes in this tiny bathroom
along with my daughter,” said
Mrs. N. B. Edwards of Quality
Liquors at-484Heraando, j

“We saw action taking place’

Jon Bealg and grabbed the mon-

ey from the cash register and
ran to put it ina safe, but the
windows broke before we got it
put up, We jumped in the bath-
room and held the door closed.
We were afraid to breathe or
even move as they took the
stock from the store,” said
Mrs. Edwards-—\,

None of the Beale Street}
merchants would speculate onl
when they might reopen. Some:
of them, including Mr.
Schwab, were openly Riner|
and their anger was directed:
primarily at Dr. King.

“He says he's coming back
to show us things can he
peaceful. Things were plenty
peaceful before he got here.”

Thursday night was anything
but peaceful, despite the de-
serted streets caused by the
curfew, Police raced from
North Memphis to South Mem-
phis throughout the n-ghi,

ly after midnight, found the
streets eerily vacant. E. H.

fired at police cars. Officers
reported their squad car was
fired on about 9 yesterday
morning by a group of Negro
youths in a passing car. Noy
one was hurt, and the car es-
leaped. At 1:15, officers arrest-
ed two white youths for ques-
tioning in connection with!
shots fired a few minutes ear--
Nier at a police car escorting a.
{garbage truck near Combs and
_ Reed. The men held for ques--
“tioning were Samuel R: Wad:!
dell, 20, of 258) Kallie, and
Larry Williams, 20, of -1669
Combs. The officers said they:
seized a 22-caliber rifle.in Mr. ;,
Williams’ living oom.

The action on the streets last}
night was lighter than Thurs:
day.

At the police station, the ar-
rest docket showed only about
30 names, less than on a nor-
mal night. Much of this ob-
viously ¥ was due to the curfew.

The only injury repored all
day was to Patrolman E. W.
Maxwell. His finger was badly
cut while he was arresting a
drunk young Negro who was
fighting with other officers on
Pope north of Chelsea.

Firemen, protected by Na-:
tional Guardsmen, answered a:
lange number—ef trash fire’
-calls, but at a rate about half:

that of -the--previous night.
[Then too, the fires last night
|penerally were of a less seri-
jous nature.

| Most of the police calls were
for broken windows, mainly
at grocery, sundry and aur
stores.

Among yesterday's ae
was a group of six Negro,
children, arrested as they ate!
candy in a looted sundry,
store. The oldest one in the
group was a 12-year-old boy}
with a broken leg, and the’
others included a 10-year-old.

Mr. Robinson reacted quick-

“March Control Is Essential”

MEMPHIS is confronted by the

threat of massive civil disobedi-
ence. Martin Luther King and followers
have put off their planned midtown
march until Monday in the hope of
bringing in outsiders, none of them
involved in the core issue which is the
sanitation strike against the City of
Memphis, a labor rather than a racial
matter.

City strategy has been to seek a

- federal court restraining order against

.the march. This was granted temporar-

ily by Judge Bailey Brown, with the
understanding that he or Federal
Judge Robert McRae could alter or
reverse the order.

NW 68262 Dotld:32989577. Page 877

A possible alteration would be to pro-
vide federal marshals to help in con-
trolling such a march. The point is not
to help King prove he can lead a “non-
violent” march, but to protect Mem-
phis against a repeat of last week’s
Beale Street destruction.

March leaders indicate they will ig-
nore any court injunction against a
King demonstration, That could only
invite disturbance and confrontation
with law enforcement officers.

The burden should be placed by fed-
eral court upon federal law enforce-
ment to control the marchers and to
protect the public, Such control is es-
sential.

Meanwhile in Washington, it came to light that nation-

does not want to commit funds to the through-the-park
route in the face of a threatened suit without the solid

Wise A

The Press-Scimitar, strongly ‘endorses

the plea of three Tennessee church Jead-
ers, issued over the weekend, for resump-
tion of talks between sanitation strike
: leaders and city representatives.
The plea was from the Rt. Rev. John
| Vander Horst, Episcopal bishop of Tennes-
| see, Dr. H. Ellis Finger Jr., Methodist
«bishop of Tennessee, and the Most Rev.
Joseph A. Durick, apostolic administrator
of the Catholic Diocese of Nashville.

We repeat it here. A

“There is an essential difference be-
tween a labor disoute and racial injus-
tice,” the three church leaders said. “At
this time, it is ‘most urgent to settle first
the labor dispute ... ones this vital issue
has been settled, then all men of good will
ean work together to effectively promote
the social and racial reforms :hat are
necessary.”

We urge the union leaders, the Negro
ministers and others who have stressed
the racial aspects of the controversy, and
the city government to heed the wise
advice of the state leaders of three reli-
gious denominations; and resume the me-
diation meetings with Mediator Frank B.
f Miles.

' The Press-Scimitar strongly ‘endorses
the plea of three Tennessee church lead-
ers, issued over the weekend, for resump-
tion of talks between sanitation strike
leaders and city representatives.

The plea was from the Rt. Rev. John
Vander Horst, Episcopal bishop of Tennes-
see, Dr. H. Ellis Finger Jr., Methodist
«bishop of Tennessee, and the Most Rev.
Joseph A. Durick. apostolic administrator
of the Catholic Diocese of Nashville.

We repeat it here. :

“There is an essential difference b="
tween a labor disnute and racial injus-
tice,” the three church leaders said. “At
this time, it is most urgent to settle first
the labor dispute ... once this vital issue
has been settled, then all men of good will
can work together to effectively promote
the social and racial reforms that are
necessary.”

We urge the union leaders, the Negro
ministers and others who have stressed
the racial aspects of the controversy, and
the city government to heed the wise
advice of the state leaders of three reli-
gious denominations; and resume the me-
diation meetings with Mediator Frank B.
Miles.

© If Dr. Martin Luther King gives up
his plan to return to Memphis for another

With his eyes on his plan to march thou-
sands of “poor people’. to Washington
later in the spring, it is apparent
that King .wants to prove that he can
conduct a big and peaceful march in
Memphis. With the streets lined with po-

and Tennessee Highway Patrolmen, of
course King could lead a peaceful march.
The officers and soldiers would see to
that.

But this would not prove anything with
regard to Dr. King’s own ability to con-
trol a large mass of marchers and keep
them non-violent. And.it would over-em-
yehasize racial matters and thus interfere
with the prime object of settling the sani-
tation strike so the strikers can get back
to work and the job of rebuilding damaged
racial relations can begin.

And if the Negro ministers will give
up their daily marches downtown. They

(Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.,!
were not expecting trouble}
when they went downtown. —

What happened?

A Negro postal employe who
fwas at the marci put it this/
way:

“The march was made up
predominantly of the working |
class, church-going people, the;
average citizen. There were!
some outsiders there. I call:
them thugs. They caused thei
trouble.” ———,

The racial explosion left:
Beale Street in shambles, an:
estimated $400,000 worth of
damage, one youth dead and:
after-shocks and tensions that,
will last for a long time.

As one observer put it, a
majority of the persons who:
jwerit to the march were per-;
sons who only put a white shirt:
and tie on on Sunday, but they|
put them on Thursday because
they believed in the sanitation
workers’ cause and in Dr.
King, a national civil rights
symbol.

Others apparently came be-
cause they were coerced by‘
threats. How widespread the
coercion was is unclear. There
were several reports of coer-
cion, but those who were
threatened often were afraid to
complain.

ANALYSIS

the spokesmen for the Negro!
community may now be hang-|
ing in the balance, some ob-
‘servers say.

Many white leaders in the
past have rejected any deal.
ings with the more militant
ministers who are now leading
strike sympathizers. Some ob-
‘servers feel the white leaders
may in the future find these’
ministers more acceptable to:
deal with than the militant
black poweradvegates.

‘The observers say the long’
racial calm here perhaps
lulled white civic leaders and)
Officials into an attitude of “it;
can’t happen here” despite
protests from responsible Ne-
gro leaders that they would be
undercut by black power advo-
cates.

The Negro leaders have
placed major emphasis here
‘on job equality and the hiring
‘and training of more Negroes,
even to the point of hiring on a
iatio basis.

After Thursday’s riot, much
of what is considered to be the
city’s civic Jeadership ap-
peared at a loss to explain why
the riot started or what must
be done to get the city moving

again toward_racial harmony.

=HW-68262—-Docld:3 2989522 Page 938_

The rjot ang the strict
clampdown by police, sheriff's
deputies, state troopers and
National Guardsmen has hada
telling effect on the mood in
the Negro community.

There are numerous exam-|
ples of mature Negroes who!
came prepared to march non~j
violently and were disllu
sioned as a result of the trou-'
ble that rocked the demonstra-'
tion. s

‘They include men such as
Harold Whalum, 38, president:
of Union Protective Life Insur-|
ance Co. and vice chairman of|
the Urban League here, who-
said he was beaten and sub-
jected to immobilizing gas aft-
er the demonstration.

“{ had just brought some la-
dies and children into the-of-
fice to get them off the street,
when a policeman pushed open}
the door and said, “You biack

see + okeep yourselves i in.
there or we're going to shoot:

you full of holes,” Mr. Whalum:

said, ——,

He said he told the officer,
such language was unneces-
sary *“and that's when he
knocked me down. There was!
so much hatred in that fist of
his that I believe I would be
jdead now if I'd said anything,
else.”
| A longtime practitioner of
|nonviolence, Mr. Whalum now
says, “J feel like a fool.”
There are other ‘examples.
'The Rev. Pat Ellis, 23, is both
“a minister and a taxicab driv-
er. He said he was jerked from:
his cab, cursed and beaten by
policemen Friday night.
Ernest Anthony Baker, 24. of:

* 932 Randle, a truck driver for

a furniture firm, said he and a!
friend, Leonard Phillips, 22, of
755 Randle. were stopped,”
cursed and threatened by po-
lice near their homes Saturday<
while returning from visiting a
ative. M:_aher spoke
without bitterness, |

There have begn other com-
[plaints that Negroes have been
.tnistreated under the 7 p.m. to’
5 a.m, curfew which has been|
imposed by Mayor Henry Loeb

since Thursday.

Both the mayor and Fire and|
Polive Director Frank Hollo-
man declaresthe curfew is ap-|
‘plied the same to whites and}
Negroes and that officers have
‘been instructed to treat every-;
one fairly.

Distrust and contempt for
«the police has long been rife in|
the Negro community. Com-t
plaints and rumors of brutali-t
ity, whether valid or not, arei
ibeing readily accepted as

‘What happened?

A Negro postal employe who
was at the march put it this
way:

“The march was made up

The racial explosion left|

As one observer put it, a

went to the march were per-|

community may now be hang-
ing in the balance, some ob-
servers say.

Many white leaders in the
past have rejected any. deal-
ings with the more militant
ministers who are now leading
strike sympathizers. Some ob-
servers feel the white leaders,
may in the future find these|
ministers more acceptable to
deal with than the militant
black poweradvosates.

The observers say the Jong
racial calm here perhaps;
Julled white civic leaders and
officials into an attitude of “it
can’t happen here” despite!
protests from responsible Ne-
gro leaders that they would be
undercut by black power advo-
cates.

The Negro leaders have
placed major emphasis here
‘on job equality and the hiring
‘and training of more Negroes,
even to the point of hiring on a
ratio basis.

i After Thursday’s riot, much
of what is considered to be the
city’s civic leadership ap-
peared at a loss to explain why
the riot started or what must
be done to get the city moving

again toward_xracial harmony,

The rjot and the strict
clampdown by police, sheriff's
deputies, state troopers and
National Guardsmen has had a
telling effect on the mood-in
the Negro community.

There are numerous exam-
ples of mature Negroes who
came prepared to march non-|
violently and were disillu-
sioned as a result of the trou-
ble that rocked the demonstra-
tion.

They include men such as
Harold Whalum, 38, president’
of Union Protective Life Insur-|
ance Co. and vice chairman of
the Urban League here, who:
said he was beaten and sub-
jected to immobilizing gas aft-
er the demonstration. i

“T had just brought some Ja-:
dies and- children into. the of-,
fice to get them off the street)
when a policeman pushed open
the door and said, “You black|
+ « er-keep yourselves in

there or ‘we're joing to shoot!
you full of holes,” Mr. Whalum
said, —, .

He said he told the officer)
such language was unneces-|
sary *“‘and that's when he|
knocked me down. There was
so much hatred in that fist of”
his that I believe I would be
dead now if I'd said anything,
else.’”

A longtime practitioner of
nonviolence, Mr. Whalum now
says, “I feel like a fool.”

There are other ‘examples.
The Rev. Pat Ellis, 23, is both
a minister and a taxicab driv-

,er. He said he was jerked from: *,

his cab, cursed and beaten by
policemen Friday night.

Ernest Anthony Baker, 24. of}
932 Randle, a truck driver for,
a furniture firm, said he and a!
friend, Leonard Phillips, 22, of!

There fave begn other com-|

since Thursday.

Both the mayor and Fire and’

WAS tragic. It was senseless.
And, as City Councilman Fred
Davis said amid the shambles.of Beale

* Street yesterday, “It’s a damn shame.”

The shame is that it happened. It
bhouldn’t have.

But it did, and it helps nothing and
proves nothing to lament.

Memphis at this moment has to look
to today and tomorrow to prevent this
incident from escalating into a racial
battle. The best way to do that is to
maintain law and order, and to restore
ia -sense of calm and thoughtfulness
‘among citizens. *

We walked through the glass- cstrewn

* streets, breathed the tear gas, and
* talked to the people yesterday — min-

utés after bands of young people had
turned a “non-violent” protest march
into chaotic violence. All we could find
on the tongues of men was anger and
fear.

Anger will not help any of us. Itis
negative and destructive. White or Ne-
gro, each of us is a Memphian who
shares the love of the community, its
needs, its goals.

The Memphis police had exercised
restraint as the march led by Martin

- Luther King moved through the down-

town section. They responded to the
outbreak of violence with organized
precision. Admittedly, individual offi-
‘cers may have over-reacted in specific
instances. but the over-all performance
was good, and what could have turned

NW 68262 Docld:32989577 Page 944

Moment Of Truth

into a full-scale riot was.nipped in the
bud.

No. COMES the time to think
ahead. The garbage strike has be-
come a secondary issue, principally
because there were angry young people
who wanted an incident in Memphis.
Yet this is the time to end the sanita-
tion strike, and'that is a two-way street
requiring honest negotiation and con-
ciliation on both sides.

Deeper than that is the need to return
to the atmosphere of fellowship which
existed in Memphis until tempers be-
came short within recent weeks. We
cannot be a city divided. We cannot
stop living together, working together,
and ‘building toward common goals.

Yesterday was no occasion for any-
one to feel a sense of dignity or pride
or manhood. People were hurt. Mem-
phis was wounded.

‘What is worse about the violence is
that so many of the innocent suffer.

‘But the anarchy which threatened
yesterday was contained and stopped
by the swift action of city police,
sheriff's deputies, state troopers and
National Guard and by ministers who
tried to cool their followers. Memphis
continues to have law and order. We
can have no less.

‘HAMEFUL jit was! And the city
remains tense. But control has
been established, and we know who is
agitating for more trouble and who is
trying to restore talm.
In this moment of truth for Memphis,
those whowwant to keep this a peaceful
city are being counted. _aaeE

YOUTH IS SLATS _
SCORES INJURE

Juveniles Spark Violence, Looting
As King Leads Strike March

Teams-of police and National Guardsmen-patrolled trouble
spots over a major part of Memphis last night, as a stunned
city counted one death, more than 200 arrests and scores of
injuries in its first full-scale race riot.

More than 3,800 National Guard troops moved into the city
yesterday afternoon and last night in the wake of rioting and
Jooting that left Main Street and historic Beale Street littered
with bricks, blood and broken glass. Police last night were
unable to estimate the number of businesses looted. Liquor
stores in predominantly Negro areas were favorite targets of
the looters. A ——,

The rioting was touched off during a march down Main led
by Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. The civil rights leader and
Nobel Peace Prize winner was +hustled away from the down-
town scene as violence began to flare.

A tight curfew — probably the first in the city’s history
since the Civil War — was imposed by Mayor Henry Loeb. It
authorized police to question anyone on the streets between the
hours of 7 p.m. and 5 a.m. and afrest anyone without “‘legiti-
mate business or emergency reasons.”

The riot tcl! last night was one dead — Larry Payne. 16, of
3023 Parker, shot by a policeman after he turned on the officer
with a butcher knife. He was being chased on a looting charge.

At least 62 persons were injured—3 of them shot and one
bus driver stabbed.

Negro leaders and Fire and Police Director Frank L.
Holloman both emphasized that yesterday’s march was an
orderly one, and the trouble started when a group of about 200
youths — many of whom ‘appeared to have been drinking —
separated themselves from the mam hody of bor n
marchers, and went on a window-broaking, looting bi

Fire Chief Eddie Hamilton

said fire calls were coming in
last night “so fast we haven’t
had time to count them.”
There were more than 125 fire
calls between noon and 10)
p.m., few of them major.
. A hepeful attempt toward
hharmalcy was planned for to-
day. City schools, some of!
which closed early yesterday,
will be open as usual. Busj
service, which was suspended]
at 1:20 p.m. after the stabbing:
incident, is scheduled to re+

less certain, though tentatively;
scheduled to resume after dis-

Mr. Holloman told an emer-
gency session of the City Coun-
cil yesterday afternoon that the!
police stopped the march, “and
the leaders disappeared.” He.
called the rioting “general!
guerrilla warfare.” !

When his terminology was}
questioned, Mr. Holloman re-_
plied, “Yes, we have a war in;
the city of Memphis.” :

Three of his listeners, Coun-'
cilmen James'L. Netters, Fred
Davis and Jerred Blanchard,
had been on the front lines off
the “war” earlier in the day.
They had stayed in the streets}

‘for hours trying to quiet the:

situation, Mr. Davis was,
among the marchers downtown;
when the rioting broke out,|
and said he was punched in the;
side by an officer's night stick.’

“I told them | was a council-’
man and a sheriff's depuly

their sticks to hit me, but they
didn't.”

high-ranking guardsmen was
Claude AL Armour, Gov.
Buford Ellington's special cons
sultant on law and order and
Memphis’ former police com-
missioner. :

“If the curfew does not
work,” Mr. Armeur said, “the
governor can declare a state of;
emergency. And it's just fan-,
tastic what that-can do.” H

city’s striking sani
ers, was generally considered
to be a “dress rehearsal” by
Dr. King for his planned
march on Washington April 22.
At a press conference at the
. Holiday Inn-Rivermont yester-
day afternoon, Dr. King prom-
‘ised another march this after-
noon, but there was no indica-
tion whether he would lead it.

Mr. Hofloman said last night
he has made no decision on
permitting another march.

The day of rioting began
with outbursts at several high
schools and college campuses,
the most serious of which cen-
tered around Hamilton High
School at 1478 Wilson. Police
officers were showered with
bricks and bottles, and two
persons were reported hurt in
the ensuing melee. There were
other disturbance calls at
South Side, Booker T. Wash-
ington, Carver, Lester and
LeMoyne College.

—.

Dr. King arrived at Memphis
Metropolitan “Airport at 10:30
a.m., and at Clayborn Temple
at Hernando and Pontotoc,
headquarters for the march, at
10:56. The march began at
11:05.

Fifteen minutes later, Beale
Street was a_ battleground.
Asst. Chief of Police Henry
Lux reported on his radio that
some of the marchers were
breaking out windows, “teer-
ing up everything and running
in all directions” in the Beale-
Main-Gayoso-Second area.

At 11:35 a.m., Mr. Holloman
called Mayor Loeb to recom-
mend that he request National
Guard aid from Governor
Ellington. ‘You cali the gover-
nor, I'll call the National
Guard,” he told the mayor.

Mr. Holloman, Mr. Armour
and Sheriff William N. Morris
briefed the city councilmen on
the day's events. The council

~called for another emergency
ion at 10 a.m. today.

‘When we learned that over’
22,000 school children were ab-
sent from school, we knew we
were in for a long day,” Mr.
Armour said.

Explaining the necessity for
traops, Sheriff Morris told the
councilmen_“No police force

Rumors of police violence
sent a charge of tension

Youths clambered aboard a
loud speaker truck, yelling for
transportation to Hamilton
High School after rumor swept
the crowd that police were,

“They killed a kid,” said one’
young marcher. :
; The Rev. Dr. H. Ralph Jack-

son, director of the minimum

salary department of the AME

Church on Hernando, told the

youths, “This is a job for men.

- What do you think you can
do?”

The youngsters jumped off
the truck.

"Dr. King was plucked from
the march by aides after
the violence erupted. He
marched with a grim face, his
arms linked with ministers. He
‘was trapped in his automobile

Father William Fennell of}

trouble by “throwing things|
and (breaking) a window with!

“From. what I saw,” said
Father Fennell, “all of the;
trouble came from youngsters
who were not a part of the
march." <———,

Father Fennell was one of]
about 10 Catholic priests who!
joined the march. There were
also 15 to 20 nuns. One of the
nuns said they were not at the
march to represent their}
schools — ‘we're here because;
we believe in this cause.”

Jesse Turner, president of
the Memphis chapter of the
NAACP said: .

“In spite of the brutal andl
inhuman treatment which
many Negro citizens have re-
ceived at the hands of our po-
lice department while attempt-|
ing to enjoy their constitution-
al rights and while trying to
preserve order, the Memphis:
branch of the NAACP urges alll
our people to remain calm and
at home tonight during these
difficult times. 1

“We further urge that we!
Negroes do not judge all lawi
enforcement officers on the
provocations by some of our!
policemen, just as we should
not be judged by acts of vio-
lence and vandalism by a few
hoodlums in the march.”

Meanwhile,—in., Washington,
Senator Howard H. Baker Jr.
(R-Tenn.), said:

“T have just learned of the
outbreak of violence in Mem-
phis. On the basis of first re-
ports it would appear that the!
situation was dealt with’
promptly and firmly.

“T fully support the efforts of
local officials to prevent a re-
currence of this incident and to
maintain law and order.” _

The Memphis Guard unit is

Minios Central’s Panama
Limited, both north and south
bound, bypassed Memphis last
night because of the rioting.

Mayor Loeb and Sheriff Mor-;
ris said the curfew included a|
ban on the sale of firearms,
beer and liquor on a county-;
wide basis. Night clubs, stores,
restaurants and other public;
places locked their doors when
the sun went down. i

As the marchers returned to

afternoon, ministers and labor
leaders urged them to “please:

over a loudspeaker. “You don’t

Yesterday’s fatality, Larry:
Payne, was pronounced dead:
at John Gaston Hospital. Mr.-
Holloman said the shooting
was self defense, and that the
officer — whose name he did
not release — had chased him
‘into the Fowler Homes after a

|" Moment Of Truth

WAS tragic. It was senseless,
And, as City Councilman Fred
Davis said amid the shambles of Beale
"Street yesterday, “It's a damn shame.”
The shame is that it happened. It
shouldn't have.
. _But it did, and it helps nothing and
proves nothing to ament.

Memphis at this moment has to look
to today and tomorrow to-prevent this
incident from escalating into a racial
battle. The best way to do that is to
maintain law and order, and to restore
asense of calm and thoughtfulness
‘among citizens.

We walked ‘through the Finan strewn
streets, breathed the tear gas, and
talked to the people yesterday — min-
utes after bands of young people had
tutned a “non-violent” protest march
into chaotic violence. All we could find
on the tongues of men was anger and
fear.

Anger will not ‘help any of us. Itis
negative and destructive. White or Ne-
gro, each of us is a Memphian who
shares the love of the community, its
needs, its goals.

The Memphis police had exercised
restraint as the march led by Martin
‘Luther King moved through the down-
town section. They responded to the
outbreak of violence with organized
precision. Admittedly, individual offi-
cers may have over-reacted in specific
instances. hut the over-all performance
was good, and what could have turned

| NW 68262 Docld:32989577 Page 955

paar

into a full-scale riot was nipped in the
bud.

OW COMES the time to think

ahead, The garbage strike has be-
come a secondary issue, principally
because there were angry young people
who wanted an incident in Memphis.
Yet this is the time to end the sanita-
tion strike, and that is a two-way street
requiring honest negotiation and con-
ciliation on both sides.

Deeper than that is the need to return
to the atmosphere of fellowship which
existed in Memphis until tempers be-
came short within recent weeks. We
cannot be a city divided. We cannot
stop living together, working together,
and building toward common goals.

Yesterday was no occasion for any-
one to feel a sense of dignity or pride
or manhood. People were ‘hurt. Mem-
phis was wounded.

What is worse about the violence is
that so many of the innocent suffer.

But the anarchy which threatened
yesterday was contained and stopped
by the swift action of city police,
sheriffs deputies, state troopers and
National Guard and by ministers who
tried to cool their followers. Memphis
continues to have law and order. We
can have no less,

HAMEFUL jit was! And the city
remains . tense. But control has
been established, and we know who is
agitating for more trouble and who is
trying to restore talm.
In this moment of truth for Memphis,
those whoswant to keep this a peaceful
city are being counted. eee

YOUTH IS SLABS
_- SCORES INJURED

Juveniles Spark Violence, Looting
As King Leads Strike March

Teams of police and-National Guardsmen patrolled trouble
spots over.a major part of Memphis last night, as a stunned
city counted one death, more than 200 arrests and scores of
injuries in its first full-scale race riot.

More than 3,800 National Guard troops moved into the city
yesterday afternoon and last night in the wake of rioting and
looting that left Main Street and historic Beale Street littered
with bricks, blood and broken glass. Police last night were
unable to estimate the number of businesses looted. Liquor
stores in predominantly Negro areas were favorite targets of
the looters. 7 —,

The rioting was touched off during a march down Main led
by Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. The civil rights leader and

Nobel Peace Prize winner was ‘hustled away from the down-,

town scene as violence began to flare.

A tight curfew — probably the first in the city’s history
since the Civil War — was imposed by Mayor Henry Loeb. It
authorized police to question anyone on the streets between the
hours of 7 p.m. and 5 a.m. and afrest anyone without “legiti-
mate business or emergency reasons.” 7

The riot tcll last night was one dead — Larry Payne, 16, of
3023 Parker, shot by a policeman after he turned on the officer
with a butcher knife. He was being chased on a looting charge.

At least 62 persons were injured—3 of them shot and one
bus driver stabbed.

Negro leaders and Fire and Police Director Frank L.
Holloman both emphasized that yesterday’s march was an
orderly one, and the trouble started when a group of about 200
youths — many of whom ‘appeared to have been drinking —
separated themselves from the main hody of ‘about 5,000
marchers, and went on a window-breaking, looting binge.
Many of them were black power advocates, several wearing
the Jackets“Of the Invaders, a local black power group-

Mr. Holloman told an emer-;
gency session of the City Coun-:
cil yesterday afternoon that the.
police stopped the march, “and
the leaders disappeared.” He
called the rioting: “general!
guerrilla warfare.”

When his terminology was;
questioned, Mr. Helloman re-
plied, “Yes, we have a war in;
the city of Memphis.”

Three of his listeners, Coun-
cilmen James L. Netters. Fred:
Davis and Jerred Blanchard,
had been on the front lines of;
the “war’’ earlier in the day.
They had stayed in the streets"
!for hours trying to quiet the
situation. Mr. Davis was
among the marchers downtown:
when the rioting broke out,’
and said he was punched in the
side by an officer's night stick.

“tT told them { was a council-
man and a_ sheriff's deputy
said. ‘Well, Geddammit. move
on,’ and I moved. They raised
their sticks to hit me, but they
didn’t.”

One of the key state leaders
rushed to Memphis aleng with
high-ranking guardsmen was
Claude A. Armour, Gov.
Buford Ellington's special cons
sultant on Jaw and order and
Memphis’ former police com-
missioner.

“If the curfew does not
work,” Mr. Armeur said, “the
governor can declare a state of,
emergency. And it's just fan-,
tastic what Jhatcan do,”

Yesterday's march, ostensi.

bly a protest_on behalf of the
city’s striking sanitation work-
ers, was generally considered
to be a “dress rehearsal’ by
Dr. King for his planned
march on Washington April 22,
At a press conference at the
Holiday Inn-Rivermont yester-
vday afternoon, Dr. King prom-
-ised another march this after-
noon, but there was no indica-
tion whether he would lead it.

Mr. Hofloman said last night
he has made no decision on
permitting another march.

The day of rioting began
with outbursts at several high
schools and college campuses,
the most sericus of which cen-
tered around Hamilton High
“School at 1478 Wilson. Police
-officers were showered with
bricks and bottles, and two
persons were reported hurt in
the ensuing melee. There were
other disturbance calls at
South Side, Booker T. Wash-
ington, Carver. Lester and
LeMoyne College.

Dr, King arrived at Memphis
Metropolitan Airport at 10:30
a.m., and at Clayborn Temple
at Hernando and Pontotoc,
headquarters for the march, at
10:56. The march began at
1

Fifteen minutes later, Beale
Street was a_ battleground.
Asst. Chief of Police Henry
Lux reported on his radio that
some of the marchers were
breaking out windows, “teer-
ing up everything and running
in all directions” in the Beale-
Main-Gayoso-Second area.

At 11:35 a.m., Mr. Holloman
called Mayor Loeb to recom-
mend that he request National
Guard aid from Governor
Ellington. “You call the gover-
nor, I'll call the National
Guard,” he told the mayor.

Mr, Hollomai Armour
and Sheriff William N. Morris
briefed the city councilmen on
the day’s events. The council

+called for another emergency
session at 10 a.m, today.

“When we learned that over
22,000 school children were ab-
sent from school, we knew we
were in for a long day,” Mr.
Armour said.

Explaining the necessity for
troops, Sheriff Morris told the
councilmen_No police force
in the United States is capable

‘handling a, major civil dis-
-er_ alone’

, The guard force was beefed
‘up last night with the arrival
; of seven armored personnel

carriers, — tank-like vehicles
«used to move troops into an
, area under fire — from the
: guard armory at Henderson,
: Tennessee.
* Commanding the guardsmen
is Brig. Gen. Hugh B. Mott, a
highly decorated (Distin-
guished Service Cross, World
War Il) officer and longtime
city treasurer of Nashville.

j-. Indications of trouble came
‘before the marchers left
the Clayborn Temple. The
*; Rev. James Lawson of Cente-
. nary Methodist Church plead-
‘ed over and over for the
younger Negroes to move to
* the end of the line but many
i remained on sidewalks, wan-
dering about_restlessly.

Rumors of police violence

sent a charge of tension
. through the crowd.

Youths clambered aboard a
loud speaker truck, yelling for
transportation to Hamilton
High School after rumor swept

| the crowd that police were,
clubbing and using antiriot liq:
uid Mace on Negro school chil-)
_ dren, paeat

“They killed a kid,” said one:

young marcher, |

| The Rev. Dr. H. Ralph Jack-’

son, director of the minimum

salary department of the AME

Church on Hernando, told the

youths, “This is a job for men.

- What do you think you can
do?”

The youngsters jumped off
the truck.

Dr. King was plucked from
the march by aides after
the violence erupted. He
marched with a grim face, his
arms linked with ministers. He
was trapped in his automobile
for about 10 minutes by the
crush of the unruly marchers
who surged around his car at
Linden and Hernando. Minis-
ters with arms joined finally
managed to clear space for
him to getout~

. youth ran by the march at

More than 200 persons were
arrested by police during the
early rioting and looting. Re-
porters counted more than 105
plate glass windows smashed
along Beale and Main,

Windows were smashed and |
young marchers began grab-
bing loot after an unidentified;

11:30 a.m. yelling “The police
have shot somebody on Main.’”{

In a special session yester-}
day, the state legislature gave,
mayors the authority to prd-|
claim a state of emergency for!
their cities for up to 15 days,;
to impose curfews and td re-|
strict the sale of firearms,

‘gasoline and liquor, including, ©

beer.

The legislature also made it!
a felony to interfere with a
fireman, policeman, ambu-
lance attendant or government;
official on duty during a riot.
‘The penalty is up to five years
in prison. .

Governor Ellington earlier]
yesterday signed into law two
other antiriot bills.

One gives him the same pow-!
ers as a mayor during a riot,
and also allows him to use
Civil Defense units during a
riot (previously they could!
only be activated during a na-
tional emergency).

‘The other bill raised the min-|
imum penalty for arson from 1;
to 3 years in prison and from 1
to 15 years for looting.

Killed was Larry Payne, 16-
year-old son of Mason Payne
who lives at 3023 Parker.

Mr. Holloman said the youth;
was shot in self-defense by any
officer, after looting the Sears,,
Roebuck and Co. store on}
South Third Street after he
turned on police with a butcher.
knife. He was shot in the Fowl-
er Homes housing project on;
South Fourth. }

About 12:30 yesterday after-1
noon, Mr. Holloman said, the!
looting spread south along the
South Third and Vance area,

Most Injuries were cuts on,
heads, shoulders, and hands.
Odell Horton, director of the;
division of hospitals and serv-
ices, said many of those}
brought to emergency rooms!
were treatéd and released. |

By 2 p.m. with sporadic;
shootings ‘and spotty disturb-
ances tying up every available|
policeman, Governor Ellington;
notified ‘the 4,000 _alerted|
guardsmen across West Ten-|
nessee to leave for Mem-|
phis. They were billeted in|
emergency quarters at the)
Fairgrounds and on the mili-;
tary side of Metropolitan Ai

port.

At the National Guard Ar-!
mory on Central, a command-
ing officer told his men wal
they were fitted with blackj

» rubber gas masks: ‘How you!
conduct yourselves downtown}
will decide whether you're}
dead or you stay alive.”

By nightfall, after long dis-
tance talks between the
guard’s command center at
the armory on Central and!
Nashville, the governor alert-
ed a second 8,000 guardsmen!

“in Tennessee to form at
armories in their home towns|

One of the convoys arriving!
on Interstate 240 about 7 p.m.)

ay

‘last night was escorted into the
city. The convoy was five
miles long.

Police threw tear gas gre-

nades on the ground after
screeching to a stop in front of
the Main Street mareh in
yemergency wagons.
} Faces turned red from exer-
\tion behind the plastic win-
«dows of the bright green
masks worn by police as they
chased looters dawn streets.

Officers ran into a hail of
bricks, stones, bottles and
‘sticks as they regrouped near
Linden and Hernando. Several
“fired tear gas shells from stub-
by rifles,

Spent cartridges from the
tear gas weapons littered the
riot area along with strikers’
signs dropped as panic struck
the mob of people.

J. B. Griffin, manager of
[Federal Clothing Store on
Main Street, said he was wait-
ing with a cocked pistol when
a _marcher broke his display
:window and looted the con-
‘ents. “He still took it (the
rclothing). I should have shot
him but I thought about it and
Ididn't.”— ————"

He said about $200 in mer-
chandise Was taken.
_ While cleanup workers were
sweeping glass off sidewalks,
Guy Lansky, co-owner of Lan-
sky Clothing Store at Beale
and ,South Second Street,
lugged a case of soft drinks out!
to officers. |

“Help yourself,” he told the?
thirsty policemen. 1

Mr. Lansky * estimated his
stock loss at $1,000 and dam-:
age to plate glass windows at!
more than $700. {

Father William Fennell of!
Our Lady of Sorrows Catholic}
Church in Frayser, said a boy
about 15 years old started the
trouble by “throwing things;
and (breaking) a window with
a stick.”

“From what I saw,” said
Father Fennell, “all of the
trouble came from youngsters’
who were not a part of the
march.” +>.

Father Fennell was one of!
about 10 Catholic priests who}
joined the march. There were
also 15 to 20 nuns. One of the!
nuns said they were not at the
March to represent their
schools — ‘we're here because
we believe in this cause.” :

Jesse Turner, president of
the Memphis chapter of the
NAACP said: .

“In spite of the brutal and
inhuman treatment which
many Negro citizens have re-
ceived at the hands of our po-
lice department while attempt-
ing to enjoy their constitution-|
al rights and while trying to,
preserve order, the Memphis
branch of the NAACP urges all!
‘our people to remain calm and!
at home tonight during these
difficult times.

“We further urge that we
Negroes do not judge all law)
enforcement officers on the
provocations by some of ourt
policemen, just as we should
not be judged by acts of vio.
lence and vandalism by a few!
hoodlums in the march.”

Meanwhile_in_Washington,!
Senator Howard H. Baker Jr.
(R-Tenn.), said:

“I have just learned of the
outbreak of violence in Mem-
phis. On the basis of first re-
ports it would appear that the’
situation was dealt with!
promptly and firmly.

“I fully support the efforts of|
local officials to prevent a re-
currence of this incident and to}
maintain law and order.”

The Memphis Guard unit is
the Third Battalion, 115th Ar-|
tillery, commanded by Lt. Col.
James L. Brown,

‘Other National Guard troop!
units from West Tennessee}
brought to Memphis were:

The 239th Signal Battalion]
from Jackson; the Fourth Bat-
talion of the 117th Infantry’
from Parsons, Henderson,
Lexington and Savannah; the!
230th Engineer Battalion from
Martin, Dresden, Paris, Cam-
den and Waverly; the Fourth
Battalion of the 109th Armor
Regiment from-Trenton, Milan,
McKenzie and Huntingdon;

and the J68th Military Police
Company trom Dyersburg.

Two Justice Department of-
ficials, Ozell Sutton, field rep-
resentative of the Memphis of-
fice and Fred Miller of the
Atlanta office, conferred yes-
terday afternoon with Col.
, Brown at the National Guard’s
command post at the armory
at 2525 Central. i

The Justice Department offi-
cials said they were here to
offer conciliation service and,
to assist in restoring order.,
They said they were not here’
to investigate civil rights vio-
lations.

MWinios Central's Panama
Limited. both north and south
bound, bypassed Memphis last
night because of the rioting. 1

Mayor Loeb and Sheriff Mor-'
ris said the curfew included ai
ban on the Sale of firearms,
beer and liquor on a county-»
wide basis. Night clubs, stores,
restaurants and other public)
places locked their doors when
‘the sun went down. 1

As the marchers returned to’
“Clayborn Temple yesterday
afternoon, ministers and labor
leaders urged them to “please;
go home, Listen to your radios. '
We will reconvene somewhere,
somehow. People are looking;
for their families. Please go}
home.”

Another saesierthen began!
calling out the names of par-
ents looking for lost children.

“Go back to the church,”
The Rev. James Lawson urged:
over a loudspeaker. “‘You don’t
have to show your manhood
this way. If you want to show,
your manhood, come on out on’
the football field with me some,
afternoon.” :

‘Yesterday's fatality. Larry:
Payne, was pronounced dead
at John Gaston Hospital. Mr.
Holloman said the shooting
was self defense, and that the
officer — whose name he did
not release — had chased him
into the Fowler Homes after a
looting incident at the Sears,
Roebuck store on South Third.)

The youth turned on the offi-
cer with the butcher knife, Mr.
Holloman said, and the officer!
shot him, =~. '

Other gunshot victims yes-:
terday were Nathaniel Nesbitt -
Johnson, 30. of 368 Linden,:
shot in the shoulder by an offi-
cer while running from a loot-
ed liquor store at Vance and
Hernando about 2 p.m.; John
Jefferson, 14, of 1029 South’
Ford, shot in the hip at 310
Laclede by a group of young:
Negroes about noon; and Allen
Hintrell, 17, of 988 Springdale,
shot at’a grocery store at 1280‘
Thomas about 4 p.m. by the
store manager, James Taylor. ©

Mr. Taylor was charged with

|assault to murder. The youth,
{shot after a beer bottle was!
ithrown through the store win- |
dow, was in serious condition



‘ast night with a shotgun slug;
lin his back. :

The last of the 3.800 troops}
called to Memphis arrived at
about 11 p.m., said Brig. Gen.
R. W. Akin, Tennessee adju-
tant general.

“As fast as they came in, we
:committed them.””

He said the troops were
being used in various ways.
Beale Street was “almost.
being saturated and the trou-|
ble has-died-down there.”

Guardsmen were also escort-!
ing fire department equipment
on calls in trouble areas. Four’
major shopping centers were
being protected. They were
Southgate, Lamar-Airways,
Poplar Plaza and Bellevue-
Parkway.

“I think we have sufficient

* force,” said General Akin.
“We have 8,000 more troops on
alert, with an airlift capabili-
ty.” He said the entire Tennes-
see National Guard had been
alerted. |

slowly intensifying confrontation between the Federal
Government and a minimum of 3,0C0 poor people. Tactics
will mainly be sit-ins and marches which will be put into
play over a period of weeks and not all at once. As of

» April 22, 1968, Dr. King and up to 100 other civil rights
and Negro community leaders from around the country will start
visiting congressional leaders, heads of Government departments
and agencies,"presenting to them the demands of the campaign and
asking them to take action. Several days later, after nothing
has been done, they will probably pick-one office and refuse to
leave. When they are arrested, the poor people across the country
will be mobilized and begin to come in caravans."

The article indicated that well before the April 22nd
starting date, work was expected to start on a "New City of
Hope" with tents or temporary buildings set up on a 30 acre
site and supplied with electricity, sewer lines, an outdoor
theater, kitchens and parking.

i The articie indicated that if still nothing is done
by the Federal Government, then acts of "moral disobedience"
will begin.

The "People's World issue of March 23, 1968, carried
an article which indicated that Dr. King spoke before 150
Negro church leaders at the Elks Club on Central Avenue, Los
Angeles, California on March 16, 1968. Dr. King urged the
ministers to begin now to organize for mass outpourings of
people from their congregations to join the demonstration.

The "People's vorld" is a West Coast communist
newspaper which is published weekly in San Francisco,
California.

The same issue of the "People's World" also carried
an article which indicated that the massive demonstration in
Washington beginning on April 22, 1968, will be a "black-brown
thing". This was disclosed at the California Democratic Council
Convention which was held in Anaheim, California on jthe weekend of

i WASHINGTON SPRING PROJECT

L. i2On' March 22, 1968, a press conference was called
by representatives of the Washington Spring Project (SP) at
the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) Office,
1401 U Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. (WDC).

At the conference which was attended by between
-£ifty and sixty people, it was announced that Dr. Martin Luther
King, Jr., President of the SCLC, would arrive.in WDC on
April 22, 1968, to initiate the WSP by presenting his
requests to the United States (U.S.) Congress. They expect
three thousand demonstrators to arrive in Washington in
support of Dr, King late in April or early May, 1968. They
stressed that the emphasis would be in the length of: the -
demonstration rather than the number of demonstrators to
come to WDC and indicated they do not expect more than five
thousand and may. limit the demonstration to that number of
people. They expect these demonstrators to remain in WDC as
long as necessary or until they get tired and return to their
homes, They emphasized the fact that there are no deadlines
and the demonstration could continue past the summer months.

It: was announced that no site had been selected for
the "New City" which will be erected to house the demonstrators,
They added their present desire is to have the location as
near the U.S. Capitol as possible. They added they do not
plan any type of demonstration inside the Capitol building;
however, demonstrators will be instructed to contact their
respective congressmen,

RACIAL MATTERS

On the night of March 21, 1968, Captain Jewell
Ray, Inspectional Bureau, Memphis, Tennessee, Police
Department, advised that the Police Department had learned:
reliably that Reverend Martin Luther King, Jr., President:
of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC)
of Atlanta, Georgia, was due to arrive in Memphis,
Tennessee, at 8:15 a.m., March 22, 1968, from Atlanta
‘on Delta Airlines for the purpose "oF leading a mass
downtown march in support of the Sanitation Workers
who have been on strike since February 12, 1968,

He was scheduled to leave Memphis at 3:15 p.m.,
March 22, 1968, to return to Atlanta.

Ray pointed out that it was snowing hard in
Memphis on the night of March 21, 1968, and that there was
a good possibility that King would be unable to arrive, as
it was indicated that flights would be cancelled in and out
of Memphis.

On the morning of March 22, 1968, Lieutenant

E. H, Arkin, Inspectional Bureau, Memphis Police Department,
advised that due to the fact that 12 inches of snow had
accumulated in Memphis and four additional inches were
predicted before the end of the day, Reverend James Morris {
Lawson, Jr., one of the ministers leading the strike 7 rer
sympathy demonstrators and who had promoted the proposed ¢
mass march in downtown Memphis headed by King, had called — ”
the Police Department and stated that the march had been a
officially called off and that plans would probably be

5 made in the indefinite future for some future march,

Arkin further stated that as of &:00 a.m.,
only 20 people had shown up at Clayborn Temple, where
. the march was scheduled to start, and that those people
had been told to go home. =

The Commercial Anneal newsnaper, Memphis,
issue of March 29, 1968, reported that the Memphis City
Council on the night of March 21, 1968, adopted a
resolution drafted by its Chairmen, Downing Pryor,
calling uron the city and the striking senitation
union, the American Federation of State, County, and
Municinal Employees, to sit down "in joint and continuous
conference" in an effort to end the strike; that the-
resolution asked that Frank B. Miles, Director of
Industrial Relations for the E, 1. Bruce Company, 2
large lumber company, Memphis, be accepted by both sides
aS a mediator. +

Pryer was quoted by the paper as saying he felt
the resolution was acceptable to Mayor Henry Loeb and
also to International President Jerry Wurf of the Union,
with Councilman J. 0. Patterson, Jr., male Negro, casting
the only dissenting vote among the 13 Councilmen,

Arkin added that sidelights to the strike of
possible interest were reflected’in events of “March 21, i
1968, namely that a Mrs. Evelyn McCray of 1253 Englewood ‘
had been shooting inside the city limits on March 21,
1968, after she told police that she fired two shots into
the air in an attempt to scare a man who was kicking over
her garbage cans. She claimed that Leslie Robinson, .age
41, of 1244 Englewood, a striking sanitation worker, had
begun kicking her gerbage cans into the*street after ‘she
would not agree to stop putting them on the curb far
sanitation pickup. She claimed that he cursed her,
threatened to burn her house down, and then started
kicking the cans, which were full of garbage, into the
street; that she went into the house, got a pistol, and
fired twice in an attempt to scare him, She claimed that
he then told her he was oe to get a pistol and shoot
her. ae ae -

The police ee arrived “and arrested
Robinson at his home, based on an assault warrant sworn
out by Mrs. McCray. Mrs. McCray was also charged with
shooting inside the city limits.

Re: Washington Spring Project

A source, who has furnished reliable information
in the past, advised on March 20, 1968, that Frank Ditto,
Detroit area organizer for the Washington Spring Project
(WSP) stated that no action had thus far been taken in
Detroit regarding WSP. Source stated Ditto said the
program for the WSP was too vague at this stage, resulting
in the reason for no organized activity. Source further
stated that Ditto advised that Martin Luther King, Jr.,
would be in Detroit, purpose unknown, and location unknown,
on April 4, 1968, at which time he, Ditto, would meet with
King to formulate plans for Detroit area «tivity in
connection with the WSP, .

WASHINGTON SPRING PROJECT
“RACIAL MATTER

On April 1, 1968, a confidential source advised
he understood that followiag the racial disturbance which
occurred in Memphis, Tennessee, on March 28, 1968, Reverend
Martin Luther King, Jp., President, Southern Christian
Leadership Conference (SCLC) called a meeting of several
SCLC Executive officers which was held March 30, 1968, at
the Ebenezer Baptist Church, Atlanta. Among those attending
this meeting were James Bevel, SCLC Executive Staff member;
desse Jackson, Northern Director, Project Breadbasket, SCLC;
Hosea Williauws, Director of Voter Registration and’ Political
Education, SCLC; and Stanley Levison.

Reverend King arranged this meeting for the purpose
of reviewing the recent disturbance in Memphis and evaluating
the effect thereof upon SCLE's contemplated Washington Spring
Project (WSP). Revarend King opened this meeting by again
stressing to those present how greatly concerned he was as to
_ the effect of the Memphis disturbance on his image as a civil
rights leader and the position of SCLC as a leading civil rights
* organization. This entire matter apparently upset Reverend King
to the extent he found it desirable to excuse himself from this
meeting shortly after its commencement. Source was unable jto
advise whether Reverend King returned to the meeting. *

This meeting lasted most of the day and concluded with

a decision on the part of those present that SCLC officials would
immediately return to Memphis , re-organize the. striking Sanitation

aSHEBGEREGTEGEE “+ Martin Luther King, Jr.
: SEE EEE Security Matter - C

A ‘confidential source, who has furnished reliable
‘information in the past, learned on March 29, 1968, that on that
date, Stanley Levison and Martin Luther King, Jr. discussed .
the position which King has found himself in.as a result of the
violence that occurred in Memphis, Tennessee, on March 28, 1968,
at the time when King led a march through downtown Memphis. King

.told Levison that he feels they have to face the fact that,

from a public relations point of view and every other way, "we
are in serious trouble", He referred to the Washington D.C.
Spring campaign, known as the Poor People's Campaign, and said

‘as far as it is concerned it is in trouble, King noted that it

will be much more difficult to. recruit people for the Washington

- campaign now because they (the Southern Christian Leadership

Conference) (SCLC) are recruiting non-violent people and these

7 people will hold back if they think they will be in a campaign
- that is going to be taken over by violent elements. King stated

that this is not a failure for the SCLC because it has enough
of a program to affirm its position but that it is a personal
setback for himself.

King continued that persons such as Roy Wilkens
(Head of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored
People) and Adam Clayton Powell, and Negroes who are influenced
by the press, will now feel that he, King, is finished, that his
non-violence is nothing, that no one is listening to it. King

.Yeiterated that they have had a great public relations setback as

far as his image and leadership are concerned.

“Martin Luther King, Jr.

Levison attempted to dissuade King from this point F
of view stating that it would be true only if King accepts “their"
-Gefinitic:. He added that he feit it is a profound error King
is making.. 7 7 :

i King noted that he did not accept it himself but that
others will. Levison retorted that people would accept it for
afew days, but, if events prove otherwise, will not accept it.

King noted that events will not prove otherwise unless

. they’ think soberly through this period. He said that somehow he had _
to reaffirm what the press will refuse to affirm. He referred to :
the Memphis incident stating that they all know it was just a YQ
few people who were involved. He added that it was a failure H
of the leadership in Memphis. King informed Levison that persons
who were responsible for the violence came to see him on the morning
of March 29, 1968. He said these persons were fighting the
| leadership in Memphis, the men who ignored and neglected them, the

men who would not give them any attention, who ordered their i
telephones cut off. King added that he had no knowledge of all this,
that the’ persons responsible for the violence were too sick to see

that what they were doing during the violence was hurting him, King,
_more than it could hurt the local preachers.

King related that he was so upset and shocked over. the
‘Memphis violence that he was going to announce a personal fast
as a means of appealing to the Memphis leadership, as well as those ”
who participated in the violence, to come to him in a united
front to take up the "“cudget" and get on with the movement.
- He said he felt this kind of spiritual move would be a way of
wnifying the movement, of transforming a minus into a plus. He
added that he feels their Washington campaign is doomed.

Levison attempted to convince King that his reas soning
was not correct. Levison said he was concerned over the "trap"
King was placing | non-violence in because King was saying that

1 pmmemeieese

. he must have 100% adherence to non-violence which is an “Impossibility. |
‘ King commented that they could not get 100% adherence but }
that they must face the fact thatariot broke out in the ranks of i
the march, that "these fellows", in the line of march, would |

Martin Iuther King, Jr. tH ey

_ Jump out, do something, and then come back to hide within
_ the group. King said he is a symbol of non-violence and
that the press is not going to say what Levison said. He
said the symbol will be weakened and it will put many Negroes
in doubt. He said he must do something that is a powerful
act to unify forces and refute the press.

a Levison stated that if it had this result he would

_ agree but that he is bothered by the idea that King would be
accepting the groBic of the press, that if King can control 99%,
and not the 1% who are violent, he is a failure. He said they
must find a way in which they do not accept this otherwise King
will never be able to do anything ualess he always spiritually
reaches a level where he hypnotizes every Negro alive.

: King questioned how he could say that they can
control the planned demonstrations in Washington,D.C. and at the
game time conclude they are going to have 1% violence.

Levison counseled that King can say that he can control
‘his followers and is not undertaking to control everybody else.
He said King could take the position that nis followers are non-
violent and will do what they must do.

They agreed to discuss the matter in depthat a meeting
- in Atlanta, gorete in King! Ss church office on the morning of
March 30, 1968 a

The same source advised on March 31, 1968, that on
that date Stanley Levison commented on the meeting hela in Atlanta,
Georgia, cn March 30, 1968. Levison's comments included the
following:

At the Atlanta meeting they examined the whole Memphis
incident and came up with a new approach. “We are going back to
Memphis. We are going to prove that you can have mass action
in the streets". Martin Luther King had decided not to go
back to Memphis and not to go to Washington (for the Poor People's
Campaign). It was the determination of the (SCLC) staff that

73+



Martin Luther King, Sr,

changed King's thinking. King is going back to Memphis

on Tuesday (April 2, 1968) and there will be a big march on
Friday (April 5, 1968). The Memphis incident was caused by
"a handful of kids" and it could have been controlled i by "our
guys" (the SCLC) had they been there. .

He, Levison, made the point that they could not let

i
"a te of kids" keep "mass action" from being their weapon.

As for controlling the Washington, D.C. demonstrations,

King knows he can control the youth. What has to be done is
go to the high schools and tell them what the establishment
wants them to do. Once they grasp this there is no chance of
anything happening. What they (the SCLC) are afraid of in
Washington is a dcuble cross from Stokley Carmichael and the

answer to that is that "our job” (the SCLC") is not to stop violence

but to be non-violent themselves. "Our position" is that "we"
are going to go on because to be able to march inthe streets is

our most important tool" and are not going on the streets because

it may start violence. "Why do we have to be afraid of riots’,

‘ It is their problem not ours" y

The Atlanta meeting was good because it shows how
“much militancy there is in the SCLC.

A confidential source, who has furnished
reliable information in the past, advised q
in April, 1964, that Stanley Levison was
a secret member of the Communist Party,

/ RACIAL MATTER

On March 28, 1968, a confidential sour advised that

eather King,
dy., President, Southern Christian Leadership Conference {SCLC) ,
participated in a march in Memphis, Tennessee, conducted by
sanitation werkers who are currently on strike in that community.
During this warch, incidents .of yvyielence were engaged in hy a
relatively small group of Negroes.

With reference to the above incidents, it was the
opinion on March 28, 1968, of Reverend King; Ralph D. Abernathy,

‘Vice President and ‘Treasurer, SCLC; Bernard Lee, Special Aide

to the President, SCLC; and Hosea Williams, Director of Voter
Registration and *politi¢al Education, “SCLO, that those responsi
therefor were in no way connected with SCLC but rather repres
a minority who obviously are neither in sympathy with Reverend
King nor SCLC. Reverend King and'his colleagues did not Know the
identities of these individuals put suspected they might possibly
be connected with some “black power" organization.

Because of the disturbance in Memphis on March 28, “1968,
Reverend King became extremely dejected and discouraged as to the
prospects for success of SCLC'’s contemplated Washington Spring
Project {VWSP). Reverend King told his colleagues oa this date
that because of his participation in the Memphis march, the
disturbance which developed, and the ensuing publicity he was
gravely fearful that his imige and that of SCLO as advocates of
nonviolence will be blem ad.

Subseribing to the thought that those responsible
for the aforementioned Aisturbance might represent some
“black power" organization, Abernathy, Lee,and Williams on
March 28, 1968, were extremely apprehensive for the perscnal
safety of Reverend King, particularly in the event he should
in the near future appear publicly in connection with activity
by the striking sanitation workers in Memphis.

Martin Luther King, Jr.
Security Matter - C

A confidential source, who has furnished reliable
information in the past, learned on March 28, 1968, that,
late on that date, Staniey Levison and Martin Luther King, Jr.
discussed the violence that occurred in Memphis, Tennessee
on March 28, 1968, following King's leadership of a protest -
march through downtown Memohis. King indicated that he has
become so depressed over the developments in Memphis that
he has considered calling off the Washington March (his
self-described Poor People's Campaign, scheduled to begin in
Washington, D.C. on April 22,'1968). :

Levison told King that his depression was aggravated
because he is physically exhausted as a result of his recent :
strenuous program.‘ He counseled King not to be on the defensive
over the eents in Memphis. but, on the contrary, should take
the position that the majority of people in the Memphis March
did not join in the rioting that took place, proving the
effectiveness of King's leadership and his policy of non-violence.
Levisorl emphasized that the Washington March will be different
in that King will have organized this march and his forces can

- stress the importance of non-violence. Levison suggested that
Saturday morning (Mareh 30, 1968) would be a better time to
meet in Atlanta to discuss the Memphis incident rather then
meeting on Friday night (March 29, 1968) because it will give
King time to rest.

NW 68262 Docld:32989577 Page 1135



” Y

Martin Luther King, Jr.

King agreed in every respect with Levison's
evaluation. et

The source also ascertained that, prior to conferring
with King, Levison spoke with the Reverend Ralph Abernathy,
an aide of Dr. King's, who advised Levison that King has
cancelled a scheduled appearence in Washington, D.C. on
March 29, 1068. Abernathy also noted that King is scheduled
to be in Virginia on Saturday (March 30, 1968) but will
probably cancel that appearance. Abernathy continued that |
it was a mistake for ‘the King forces not to‘ have a staff in
Memphis to train people in non-violence. He said it also was
a mistake on the part of the King forces not to have been
more aware of the local situation,

A confidential source, who has furnished
reliable information in the past, advised
in April, 1964, that Stanley Levison was
a secret member of the Communist Party,
United St of Am rico (CP,USA) . Dooonenig,

for nine single rooms for the night of March 22, 1968 at
the Holiday Inn, Savannah, Georgia.

Savannah, Georgia, about the planned "Poor People's Campaign".

On March 23, 1968, a second source advised that
Rev. King failed to appear the previous evening at Savannah

SCLC, came from Atlanta and spoke to a crowd of about 500
‘people in the St, Paul Church, urging support for the planned
demonstration in Washington, D, C, next month,

Reference is made to our memorandum dated March -19,
_1968, and captioned as above, which sets forth information
. concerning progress in, the organization and planning of the
Washington Spring, Project (WSP). :

Martin Luther King, Jee, President, Southern
Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC), has publicly announced
he will conduct a tassive cévil disobedience campaign in the
Nation's Capitol during April, 1968, in an‘ effort to pressure
Congress into passing legislation favorable to the Negro.

i In pursuit. of this project, the SCLC has opened an
* office in Washington, D. C., from which to organize and direct
the USP,

On March 22, 1968, a press confdrence was called by
WSP representatives at the SCLC Office, Washington,D. C. (WDC).
At the conference an announcement was made that King was expected
-to be in WDC on April 22, 1968, to initiate the WSP by presenting
-his requests ‘to Congress, They further announced that ‘late in
April or early May, 1968, they expect three thousand demonstrators
to arrive. The emphasis. is being placed on the length of the
demonstration rather than the number of demonstrators and they
do not expect the number of demonstrators to exceed five
thousand and will possibly limit the number to that figure. They
expect the demonstrators to remain in WDC ag long as necessary or
until they get tired and return to their homes,

Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.,
head of the Southern” Christian
Jjeadership Conference, will vis-
iil Columbia April 3 as part of
“qn extensive tour of Southeas-
fern and Northern states.

Al Pertilla, a spokesman for
King’s Atlanta, Ga., headuar-
ters said, “exact times” and
places (King’s visit) are not’
known yet, As of this time,
however, he will visit Colum-

King is making the tour in
connection with the S.C.L.C.’s

will speak to people in poverty:

dramatize the plight of some
three million low income people
in the U. S.

Organizers of the Poor Peo-
ples Campaign say that King
hopes to slowly increase pres-'
sure on (he federal government
for aid to poor people. His pri-
mary method will be the use of
sit-ins and marches. ,

The curreitt tour will culmi-|&
in a massive march in’
Washington on April 22. The’
match, King said, in December
is aimed at forcing Congress
and the administration {to pro-'
vide “jobs or income for all.”

King said an initial force of
3,000 demonstrators, trained in
nonviolent techniques, would
seck “massive dislocation” of
the capital “until, America res-|

The protestors, recruited in 10

meeting was small,in- comparison to those in the past that King
and his associakées had drawn, nor did King receive an

overwhelming support for his proposed project.

Mr. McKelroy advised that King departed Grenada

minute inspiring talk concerning the Washington Spring Project.

warned that the grandchildren of those present will also have
nothing if the Negro fails to act today’ and demand his God
given and constitutional rights. He strongly encouraged the
local Negro to rise up and join the Washington Spring Project.
King explained that the purpose of the Washington’ Spring Project

rights which are supposedly guaranteed to all American citizens

- but in reality are given only to American white citizens,

Source advised that the Church was crowded with ~

happen when Dr. Martin Luther King's "poor people's campaign"
begins in April, -Even though Dr. King has asked the
militants to stayjout of the activities, there is no
assurance the request will be honored.

It is believed there are some individuals in WDC
who may be inclined toward the creation of racial trouble
a in WDC, but these are not likely to initiate any actions
toward the starving of trouble. The feeling among many in the
Northwest ghetto is that in order for the "poor people's
campaign't to be successful, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.
Will have to bring in outsiders for his reported "civil
disobedience" in WDC. lr the event large numbers of outsiders
" are brought in, their behavior will be very difficult to
control, Therefore anything may happen.

Source number one further ash etek as follows on

ih In thle Northeast area near the source’s _residence,
there has been a-lack of enthusiasm by the WDC citizens for
Dr. King's "poor people's campaign''. These people are not in
sympathy with Dr. King's plans as ‘they fail to see that any
benefits may result from any demonstration involving civil.
o disobedience. : : :

Source number six who resides in Northwest WDC
and is employed in 4 Northwest ghetto area, advised as
follows on March 18, 1968; .
. The_ foremost concern of people in WDC is the unknown
potential for racial trouble which could take place when Dr.
Martin Luther King and his “poor people's campaign" begins
in Woo in April 1968. Many leaders of organizations in WDC
are attempting to evaluate the current and future potential
oz Dr. King's impact on the racial scene of WDC. These
leaders are very concerned and are trying to determine what

- Racial Matters. nel -

A confidential source, who has furnished reliable
information in the past, advised on March 19, 1963, that on that
date Stanley Levison contacted Harry Wachtel Levison, referring
to Martin Luther King's Washington, D.C. spring’ campaign, told
Wachtel that the National Committee for a Sane Nuclear Policy
passed a generalized resolution on the (Vietnam) war and
specifically endorsed the Washington campaign. He added that
Tudja Crowder, whom he descrided as the new Executive Director
of Sane, had contacted him and wanted to,have a meeting on March 20,
1968, with a small group of the Sane Directors’ to have them
briefed by someone from-the Southern Christian Leadership Conference
(SCLC) ‘to see how they can tie in. Levison felt this was important
and said that, if theresis an.element of the peace movement they

might get to join "this" (the Washington Project), it will be
Sane.

| Levison- also mentioned that the ‘Washington Jewish
Community Council had endorsed the Washington Spring Campaign
because Andrew Young, the Executive Vice President of the SCLC,
had told them that the SCLC would notify the Police on anything
they did. Levisoh questioned how Young could have” promised this
since he and Young had discussed how the building of "shanty towns"

He added that a person who had attended a non~ -black minority
conference - (the, 53 non -Negro Rinority groitp organizati ons,
representatives from which met in Atlanta, Gedrgia, March 14,
1968, with i atin Luther King to plan for King's "Door People? s
Campaign" campaign in Washington, DiC.) stated that "they"
specifically said "they" were not going to notify the Police.
Levison, apparently alluding to the Jewish Community Council,
said it was left on the basis that there is a general sentiment
to endorse the objectives but they would like to know more clearly
what is going to be done and why. He said this is good because
this is the Jewish establishment. EEE

Levison described the Washington Je ewish Community
Council as the leaders of the Jewish’ Community Councils all over
the country, all of whdm are Democrats and "tied into the machines"

Levison eee ‘to Jack Greefberg (Director of the Legal
Defense and Education Fund of the National Association for the q
Advancement of Colored People) stating that Greenberg, if his opinion,
had come up with the best publ icity idea thus far. and that is to
transport a cabin, which people live in, in Mississippi, to
Washington, D.C. and present it as a gift to the Smithsonian
Institute as shcwing the manner in which people live in America
in 1968. Levison said that he, Levison, is pushing ‘the. "shanty
town thing" but that Greenberg's idea is better... He added that
he intends to see, that Greenberg's suggestion is carried out.

Levison noted that their target in the Washington project
is full employment. He said a victory in terms of "countable"
jobs would be magnificent for King.

7 Job is massive and the time is short, we must act now. I'm sure
that that point isn't debatabe. The question is , what can we do?

RE: . WASHINGEON SPRING PROJECT

| A source, who has furnished “yeliable information in
the past, advised on Merch 5, 1968, that James Gibson, Southern
Christian Leadership Conference (strc), Representative from
National Headquarters of, SCL, Atlanta, Georgia, is presently
attempting to recruit participants for the Washington Spring
Project (WSP) in ‘the Virginia Counties of Ame diss Brunswick
and Lunenberg.

A characterization of SCLC is attached hereto.

; It is steted this recruiting drive, aimed at .
attracting persons in the hard-core unemployed and low income

employed groups, has not been too successful. Persons approached
have been asked to attend and paxticipate in captioned sctivities
at Washington, D.C. A lack of funds needéd to obtain the required

transportation is a major problem.

A second source, who has furnished reliable information

in the past; has advised that the participation of people from
Mississippi and, Alabama in WSP in/the Richmond - Petersburg,
Virginie, AYER, is still ina 7 zy nebulous planning stage.

It appears that reohGa11, Greneta, Mississippi, is
actively engaged in the formulation of such plans. These
+ tentative plans call for a march by these persons with persons

from Petersburg, Virginia, fron Petersburg to Richmond, Virginia.

This march is to be conducted on or about April 22, 1968, the -
_ announced date that a SCLC sponsored march from Baltimore,
Maryland, to Washington, DoCo, Will take place as a kick-off
for WSP. : ;

Virginie is to stimilete interest and participation in the WSP
as well as to promote the interest and growth of SCLC.

Reverend Smith and other sources, who are in a position
to earn of activities in connection with WSP. have advised
generally that they do not anticipate that promotion of WSP will
be too successful in.the Richmond area. ‘They based their
opinions on past experiences in this type or activity. They
advised these have not been too successful in the past, describing
race relations in the Richmond area as good.

They pointed out that there exists in Richmond a Miladle=
‘class complacency" that ha prevented a concerted or mass united
effort in the promotion of activities designed {bo better the
conditions of Negroes in the community. This "complacency", they
feel, is based on the fact there are jobs for Negroes, and tnis
group is, compared to other areas, economically well off. They pointed
out, further, that Negroes have been and are peing hired in
City jobs and in other positions formerly availeble only to
persons of the white race. a

WASHINGTON SPRING PROJECT (WSP) ;

Reference is made to Cleveland memorandum dated
February 23, 1968

MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR., President, Southern Christian
Leadership Conference (SCLC), has publicly announced he will a
eonduct a massive civil disobedience campaign . in the nation's
Capital the first week of April, 1968, in an effort to pressure
Congress into passing legislation favorable to the Negro.

"The Call and Post", a weekly Cleveland Negro newspaper
al circulation in its March 2, 1968 issue, page 4B,
orial and feature column page, had an article by. the
of the paper, Mr. WILLIAM 0. WALKER » captioned, "King
Reconsider His March on Washington." This article then
as follows; 7

"The old gliche is: 'Don't bite off more than you
ean chew.' I was thinking about this as I read that
Dr. Martin Luther King was touring down in Alabama trying
ba recruit participants for his 'Poor Peoples Campaign,'
: estined to march on Washington in April.
4 "When I first heard about Dr. Kingts proposed
march on Washington and his plans for camping his followers
in the public parks, I felt he had been ill.aavised to
embark on & project that at best, could be only 2a publicity
glumick.

"Dr, King, no matter how much compassion he may have
for his fellowman, must look at all the facets of the 7
problem and not be swayed by just one side..

RE: WASHINGTON SPRING PROJECT (WSP.

"Getting 3,000 poor, unemployed folks to pick up -
and leave their homes, humble as some of them may be and, -
for an indefinite period, to live out in the open, requires
more than enthusiasm and dedication. atin

"Qranting that Dr. King finally succeeds in get- _
ting 3,000 people to Washington, since they are poor
and without adequate funds for their sustenance,
how is he going to feed them every day? Where is he going
to house them every night? What about their health
problems? Their legal problems? The problems of discipline
Where is the money for all of these things going to come from?

"rf I understand Dr. King's program,.he says he
is going to keep his followers in Washington indefinitely.
Let's take a short period of 14 days. Feeding each person
cost at least $1.00 a day. This then, is $3,000.
ril weather even in Washington, these people will have
ve some kind of shelter over their heads at night. If
an get this for $1.00 per person per night, he wiil
be iucky. This is another $3,000 per day. To provide
other necessities that people require each day, will cost
a minimum of 50¢ per person a day. This adds another $1,500.
S05 at the lowest possible estimate, each person will cost
$2.50 per day. For 3,000 ssa ee this adds up to $105,000
for just 14 days.

then, there are the expenses of Dr. King's staff and

i eae other functionaries. ‘The traveling expense of these people
going and coming. The whole thing will add up to a staggering
ameunt of somebody's money.

"Yow does Dr. King propose to raise this money?
Moving on faith is one thing, but, 3,000 people, no matter
how much faith they have, need food and shelter. Somebody
Will have to produce this in fact, not theory. 7 }

"Since most, if not all of the people Dr. King is trying
to recruit are poor and unemployed, wouldn't it be better to :
, . try to get these people into training programs in their local
fi communities? Granting that some southern communities may not
have such federally: financed programs, isn't it better to
petition the government to provide them rather than
taking these people off on a wild goose chase to Washington
where, no matter what happens, they will have to go back to

. their heme coz ities for whatever benefits they are to
eventually receive. ;

RE: WASHINGTON SPRING PROJECT (WSP

“Since lobbying for meaningful civil rights legis—
Lation is the announced goal of Dr. King's efforts, isn't
he really using these unfortunate people who can least
afford the time or money, as human pawns. Inspiring them :
with promises as an inducement to get their participation, i
is creating a false hope of personel reward before they
return home. If they return home disillusioned and empty
handed, they became prime examples of futility in their
communities.

"This must not be permitted to happen. The best

way to prevent it, is not to take them to Washington
in the first place. If a demonstration of power or force
ox whatever you want to call it, is deemed’ necessary in
ington, then let those who can afford it march on
and the President. Past efforts have proven that
sizeable numbers can be induced to i.xn out for a just cause,

"J am afraid Dr. King's venture is frought with
y dangers and problems. The Negro has a just cause.
re is urgent need for putting pressure at every point
our civil rights fight to achieve meaningful resulis.
nis pressure should be pushed at the local, state and
netional levels. Every resource at the Negro's command should
. be pressed into the fight. : i

"on this, Dr. King or no one else will find any
oppositicn. However, doing something just for the publicity
of it and, using unfortunate human beings, is just going too
far.

"It would be most unfortumate if what happened to
the bonus merchers in the late twenties during the Hoover
administration, happened to Dr. King's marchers. Unforturiately,
the present feeling of a large segment of white people is to
use the police force and, even the National Guard and the U.S.
Army to supress any riots. You can see from the way the
National Guard acted recently : in Orengeburg, S.C., what to
expect in any future riots. Every law enforcement agency
has been in special training during the winter mouths. They
have been given special riot control techniques. Special
equipment and supplies have already been purchased for use.

There js no reason then for deliberately creating situations
_ that may endanger the lives of innocent Negroes.

RE: WASHINGTON SPRING PROJECT (WSP)

"I certainly hope Dr. King and his staff will think
very carefully about what they do and how they do it.
Racial tensions in this country are now st a high pitch.
Entirely too many people are of the mind that another
blcody summer is in the offing. No matter what anybody
says, Negroes have not benefited in any substantial way
from any riot. Other than a looters holiday, the riots
of the past have been very costly to all Negroes, We
must then do all we can to prevent riots. Weshington must
not become another frustrating, bloody battleground."

"The Cleveland Press", a Clevelend daily afternoon
newspaner of general circulation, in its March 6, 1968 issue,
page AS, hed an article entitled, "200 Clevelanders Sought
for Dr. King's March", which read as follows:

"Erforts have begun to enlist 200 Clevelanders to
take part in the 'jobs or income! dexonstration to be led
by Ly. Martin Luther King in Washington on Apr. 22.

“The goal is to have 200 representatives from 15
cities, totaling 3000 participants, reported Hilbert
Perry, director of the Bruce Klunder Freedom House.

"The Freedofi House is' one of three groups here
which have endorsed the demonstration and are recruiting
participants. The others are Domestic Workers of
America, a union of household workers, and the Cleveland
Welfare Rights Movement, made up mostly of mothers on
relief rolls and their supporters.

"They are attempting to raise funds to charter buses
to Weshington and also seeking contributions to pay for child
eare of mothers taking part, or families who will volunteer
to tend children.

"TN WASHINGTON, churches are to be asked to provide
meals and lodgings for those taking part.

"Perry said those being recruited here cannot be in-
formed yet of what.form tue demonstration will take be~
cause plans are still being worked out by Dr. King's head-
quarters in Atlanta. But it is expected to start with mass
calls on senators and representatives from the communities
_ represented.

"IVE HOPE to get a pledge that the Government.
will become the employer of last resort,' said Perry,
explaining that the Government would establish progvams
to employ those unable to get jobs elsewhere.

"tpresent training and employment programs are
woefully inadequate. And we doubt that business will pro-
vide the jobs needed despite the government subsidy to be

OBSERVATIONS: ~ | | i

On February 28, 1968, a WFO informant informed us HI
that Bernard Lafayette, project Director for SCLC, had informed !
him King's organization is experiencing difficulty with re- i
eruiting demonstrators for the "Washington Spring Project,"
Because of this, the demonstrations would not start the first H
week of April as originally planned. :

Another-WFO informant learned from Lafayette's t
assistant, Anthony Henry, that a secret meeting had been held ;
-by King's group and they had set April-27, 1968, as the date 3
for the project to start. Henry indicated this date can be | -
moved ‘up or back depending on future developments. : |

It is felt that the President would be interested in H
receiving information showing the communist help King is re-
ceiving.in his proposed "Washington Spring Project,"

Another source advised on February 28, 1968, that
- Bernard Lafayette, project Director, Southern Christian
Leadership Conference, had informed him“that King's orgarii~ He
gation is experiencing difficulty recruiting demonstrators
for the "Washington Spring Project," . Because of this, the

A third source learned from Anthony Henzy,, assistant
to Lafayette, that the Southern Christian Leadership Conference

cording to this source, ‘Heary indicated this date can be moved

F A fourth source advised, in April, 1964, that
Stanley Levison was a secret member of the Commmi st Party,

’ USA, in July, 1963, ‘In late 1963,’ and early 1964, he

criticized the Communist Party for not being sufficiently

ane militant in the civil rights struggle. lLevison was described <~
by certain Communist Party leaders as being to the "left" of
the Communist Party in his position on civil rights. His ~
differences with the Communist Party, however, are merely
tactical, and he continues his ideological adherence to
communism, - Stanley Levison is the owmer and operator of

‘ information in the past. furnished information on February 23,
.1968, reflecting that Stanley Levison was going to meet
Martin Luther King,-Jr., on’ the night of February 23, 1968,
at Kennedy International Airport, New York City, to take him
to the "Freedomways" Magazine: sponsored affair at Carnegie

Hall, New York City, that night.

. fhe same source learned on February 24, 1968, that

on that date, Stanley Levison told Clarence Jones about the
affair sponsored by "Freedomways" Magazine on the night of
February 23, 1968. Levison said he believed it illustrates

the degree of despair and. depression prevalent in progressive
circles. He described it as the "deadest meeting" -he had

ever seen and said that people are depressed because they are
frustrated over the Vietnem War and also feel there are no
answers to riots in the streets. Referring to Martin Luther
King's speech, he said that” King has never read, anything as
“badly. Levison attributed this to King feeling uncomfortable
at the meeting. He said that King felt it was his duty to :
pay a tribute to({W.E.B.) DuBoig$ but also. knew it was not really
- his (type of) crowd. He said King read his speech as if he

Reference is made to communication from this Bureau
dated February 19, 1968.

The "Miami Herald" a local Miami, Florida, newspaper
on February 20, 1968, reported that Dr. MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR.,
opened a series of neetings in Miami, Rlorida, on February 19,
1968, designed to help Negro clergymen minister to the social
\. end economic needs of their congregations. This article report-
: ed that Dr. KING and Reverend ANDREW YOUNG, one of his top aides
| in the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC), said the
sa five-day series of conferences will not include planning for
civil rights or anti-war demonstrations.
|
|
\

It was alse reported that Dr. KING and Reverend YGUNG
both Said they did not expect STOKELY CARMICHAEL and RAP BROWN,
leaders of the vocal Black Nationalist militancy to attend.
However, Reverend YOUNG said, “If STOKELY and RAP come we

- won't throw them out." This article goes on to report that
. im addition to the 150 official delegates, about 50 more
‘ ministers are expected to attend the meetings, which are not
| open to the public.
|

It was reported that about 125 delegates attended a
luncheon om February 19, 1968, and heard a talk by Dr. R. A.
ADERNATHY, a Vice-President of SCLC. In addition, this
article reports that three Lecturers, folloyed by workshop
sessions, are scheduled for February 20, 1968.

WM T-1 advised that the Ministers Conference at the
Sheraton Four Ambassadors, Migmi, Florida, opened on schedule
on February 19, 1968. In welcoming the,group, Dr. MARTIN
LUTHER KING, gR., reiterated that the purpose of this
conference was for discussion, Study and trdining in
conumection with problems facing the Negroes in the big city

He wlurthker. stated that attention ‘yould he given to
att enpting to reconcile the term “black power" with the over-
all cf vik rights movement in the ; United States, During the
opening conftrence, nonviolence as continuously stressed,

Br. KING stated that over- integration could occur to
_the point that Negrees could lose their identity. He gave
eS am example the integration of the Methodist Church, however,
this was not further explained.

Tke only remark that was made to the people in
attendance relative to the "Washington trip" was that this
copference in Miami would met be weed for the purpose of
recruiting people for the trip to ‘Washington, nor would it be
@ topic of discussion. :

On February 20, 1968, the entire group will be broken
up into "workshop wits” according to their interest and needs
of the area from which the various ministers came. All leaders
are to take part im the activities of the workshop and report
back to the emtixe assembly. ~

During the opening day of this meeting, only one
item of dissemsion occurred and that involved some opposition
to the fact that apparently DAN MONAHAN, who was formerly
commected with Ur Housing, has been invited to address the
conference in Wi: . Semne, ministers disagreed with this
imvitation, kewever, Reverend ANDREW YO stated that his
presence could contribute to the conference, and that he
should be heard.

On February 20, 1968, Lieutemant HARVERT SWILLEY,
Intelligence Unit, Miami, Fiorida, Police Department, reported
that several items of literature were being passed out to the
delegates. Included in the literature was a leaflet captioned
he Southern Christian Leadership Conference" and outlines
the. purpese of the training program, Im addition, a state~
ment made by Br, MARTIN LUTHER KEG, JR., Atlanta, Georgia, on
December 4, 1957, which.statement relates to the Washington
Spring Project, was also being passed out.

"Last week the staff of the Southern Christian
Leadership Conference held one of the most important
meetings we have ever convened. We had intensive
discussions snd anelyses of our work and of the
ehellienges which confront us and our nation, and at
the end we made a decision which I wish te-announce
today. to.

‘The Southern Christian Leadership Conference
will lead. waves of the nation’s peor and disinherited
to Washington, D. C., next spring to demand redress of
their grievances by the United States government and
to secure at least jobs or income for all.

“We will go there, we will demand to be heard,
and we will stay until America resyonds. If this
means forcible repression of ovr movement, we will =
confront it, for we have dome this before. If this
means scorn or ridicule, we embrace it, for that is
what fmerica’s poor new receive. £ it means jail, we
gecept it willingly, for the millions of poor already
are imprisoned by exploitation and discrimination.

But we hore, with growing confidence, that our campaign
in Washingtom will receive at first a sympathetic
understanding across our nation, followed by dramatic
expansion of nomvivlent demonstrations in Washington
and gimultanesous protests elsewhere, In short, we
wilt be petitioning our government moves against
poverty.

"We have nov begun preparations for the
Washington campaign. Our staff will swon be taking
mew assignments te erganize people to go to Washington
from 10 key cities and 5 rural areas, This will be
no mere one-day march in Washington, but a trek to

‘we have learned from hard and bitter experience
in our movement that our government does not move to correct
a problem involving racé until it is confronted directly
and dramatically. It required a Selma before the
fundamental right to vote was written into. the federal
statutes. It took a Biruingham to dramatize the
economic plight of the Negro, and compel the government
to act.

‘Unrest among the poor of Americ#, and particularly
among Negroes, is groving rapidly, In this age of

Reference is made to communication from the Miami
Office of the Federal Bursau of Investigation dated February
10, 1968.

The "Yiawi Herald," a local Hiami, Florida, newspaper,
reported February 18, 1958, that some Negro leaders, not further
identified, will urge Dr. NARTIN LUTHER KING, JR., at meetings
in Miami, Florida, to detour his planned massive civil dis-
obedience demonstration scheduled for April in Washington, D.C.
The Negro leaders will recommend that efforts be redirected
to demonstrate in districts of Comgressmen who have voted
against civil rights legisiation.

The "Miami Herald" reported that-:one prominent civil
rights leader, who requested his identity be withheld, said
“Cougressmen could careless about demonstrations in Washington--
and Negroes could be made to Rook bad tionally. But if the
demonstrations are held in the home di icts of certain
Congressmen they most certainly will feel the impact."

nae MM &-~1 advised on Februaxy 19, 1968, that Dr. NARTIN

LUTHER KING, JK., arrived at the Sheraton Four Ambassadors
Hotel at 10:30 Fa on February 18, 1968. Dr. KING refused to

: utilize the suite reserved for him and kept moving from room

: to room, Two of Dr. KING's aides, identified as Dr. A. YOUNG
and Reverend F, C, BENNETT, made a thorough check of the
yoom reserved for Dr. KING, apparently looking for a “bugging
device."

Dr, KING, through Dr. FOUNS and Reverend BENNETT,
according to the source, has already refused to be interviewed
> by the varicus vwews media and it appeared to the source that
KING was quite concerned with the amount of security being
effected by the Sheraton Four Ambassadors Hotel, along with
local authorities. :

On ‘February 12, 1968, a meeting of members of the

the Paschel Motor Inn, Atlanta, Georgia, concerning the

Re: WASHINGTON SPRING PROJECT (WSP) COE RRA

i a serious threat against the life of Martin Luther King and
. that an‘attempt upon his life will be made during this march.
In_order to counteract such an attempt, Reverend Bennette
was assigned to be in charge of security for Martin Luther
King and Ralph Henry was assigned to be Reverend Bennette's
{ assistant. It was indicated that those involved in this
4 security should be alert for danger, not only from white
persons but also from Negroes. No additional information
was given at this time concerning any -possible threats.

It was reported by Several of those present that
serious difficulty had been-sencountered in the northern states
in recruiting participants for the Washington Spring Project.
It was, therefore, decided to concentrate the recruitment of
participants in the southern states. |

It was also reported that serious financial problems
have developed, especially in certain areas. Hosea Williams
presented proposed budgets for the "financially deprived or
unresponsive areas involved in the Washington campaign." He
stated that for one reason or another the following areas
seemed to be having unsolved financial problemS in getting
their mobilization and recruiting started:

Mississippi
Alabama

* ' . Georgia

ve North Carolina

‘South Carolina

Virginia
Washington, D, C,
Baltimore, Maryland

Williams stated that it was originally planned that
each project area was to raise its own funds, however, this
-.does not seem possible in the poorer areas at this time. He
reported that he had conferred with project leaders in the
above areas and they state that they can do the job provided
they are furnished the resources to get it started. Based on
Williams' conversations with these leaders, a budget has been
“drawn up for each of the above areas which provides between
$1,200 to $1,500 per month with the exception of South Carolina
which will receive $740 and Washington, D, C,, which will
receive $3,500. These budgets include payments for items such

as bi-monthly payments to subsistence workers, travel,
telephone expenses, costs of utilities, mailing expenses,

: At the conclusion of this meeting, it was announced
1 that subsequent meetings will be held every Monday for the
‘ next three weeks in an effort to complete the plans for the

he had learned that Reverend Martin Luther King, dr., President,
Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC), continued to
be discouraged with the lack of progress made by SCLE staff
embers in recruiting and training demonstrators for SCLC's
. Washington Spring Project, (WSP}. In this connection Reverend
King recently held an "emergency meeting" of the SCLC areca daha
officers: to td the WSP. :

Reverend King pointed out that SCLC has previously
announced that it will have 3,009 demonstrators in Washington,
De Ces in early April-1968, Should only-'a few hundred denonstrators
appear in Washington,“ D. Coy Reverend King said he and SCLC would

SCLC produces 3,000 demonstrators and the nation fails te react
appropriately this ; Will be the responsibility, of the nation
and not SELC, On the. other hand, he said, SCLC will be greatly
at fault if it does not produce the ‘announced number of
demonstrators ,

consider whether or not they cau successfiully.carry out the
planned WSP, He said if they feel‘they cannot then it will be
necessary to. establish a reason as to why he and SCLC finds

WASHINGTON SPRING PROSECT

c On January ‘22, 1968, a second confidential source,
advised an SA of the FBI that a workshop to study non-violent
demonstration techiiques was’heild at the Ohio State University
Student Union puilding, Columbus, Ohio, on anaaitd 20 and 21,
1968. 7 . 2

. 1

fae The second ‘confidential source advised as follows:

The workshop was scheduled to be held from

10:00 a.m. to 11:00 p.m., January 20, 1968, and from 11:90 a.m. ?
to 11:00 p.m,, January ai, 1968. However, participants in aeeee)
the workshop did not begin arriving for the workshop until
late in the afternoon of Janusry 20, 1¥68.- There wore appr
thately twenty-six individuals present when the workShop finally
got underway. Pat Shafer, fieht secretary of the Ohio Peace
Action Council, was in charge of the workshop-

The principal speakers at the workshop ere
Reverend Ed Randall Osburn, Cleveland, Ohio, associated with
the Southern ‘Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC); Mike ileal
Biblex; and. James Bristol, associated with the American
Friends Service Committee.(AFSC). Reverend Osburn had driven
to. the workshop from Cleveland, Ohio, with Mike Bibler, while
dames Bristol had flown by airplane ta Columbus , Ohio, from
Philedelphia, eietetlah atta

From the afternoon of January 20, 1968, to the
conclusion of the workshop on that date, there was no discussion
of non-violent demonstration techniques. The discussions
eentered around the Washington Spring Project, being spohsoved
-by the SCLC at Washington, D.C., during the summer of 1968. fl
: » Dusing their comments to the group, Reverend Osburn,
Bibler, and Brist dicated they had attended a necting or
tha SCLC recently in Atlanta, Goorgla, ¥ iuther
King and other SCLC personnel scussed the Washi on Spring
Project. it was apparent that those three individuals hed
been scheduled to attend the workshop in the Ohio Union building
for some time.

-- Reverend Osburn indicated the demonstration in
Washington, D. C., would be composed initially of about 3,000
people from poverty areas in the United States, including whites,
Negroes, and Puerto Ricans. Those persons woulid travel to
Washington, D. C., and during the first week or ten days would
demonstrate on the issues of poverty and jobs. After that
period, the demonstration would pick up the peace issues.

Reverend Osbura indicated the Washington, D.C.,
demonstration would be 2 continuous “program. The initial
3,000 demonstrators would live in Washington, D.C., and carry
out dexonstrrtions in the offices of Government officials and
in other plzces.) In the event any cf the original 3,000
demonstrators were removed by arrest ox any other veagon,
they wou id ba replaced by other persons coming from the sane
area from which the original, demonstrator had come. ‘

Reverend Osburn emphasized that it was believed
this yould be the last:-chafce’ to prove non-violent demonstrations
couig be ertective in obtaining-concessions: on civil rights
matters. Reverend Osburn stated if that effort failed, black
‘nationzlist groups would take over the leadership in civil
rights matters, In ‘confection wigh that situation, Revencne
Osburn remarked, “Let's hope this works". ‘ i

Bibler and Bristol, in their talks to the group ]

attand.ng the workshop, added nothing new, but supported the
BEA GL ts made by Reverend Osburn, All three speakers made {
|

frequent favorable references to Martin Luther King. -

; “Et was determined that Bristol anticipated there
Would “it a Cincinaati, Onio, group participating in the

¥isted those as follows: ©

1. Gather information
i. 3... Education of people. i A

‘3. Regotintions.

4, Confrontation and dcwonstration
5. Reconciliation.

Bibler was somewhat critical of peace groups and
talvd ke feit they had not accomplished anything. :

During the worksko;). it -as brought out that there
see. two main points involved in the technique of civil disobed:..nce;

-CONEIDENTIAL—

NW 68262 Docld:32989577 Page 1466 , et : 7 ee



WASHINGTON SPRING PROJECT
1. Non-cooperation with an unjust law.

2. Nonscooperation with a just law to emphasize
an unjust situation not regulated by law.

Bristok pointed out that the technique of biocking
traffic was a case in-which the traffic laws were just, but
it could be used to emphasize a situation inw lving an unjust
jaw. .It was mentioned that as a technique, the demonstrators
in Vaghington, D. C., could tie up traffic. That could be
accomplished without breaking'a law, because while there are
Jaws which require a person to abey a stop light, there are no
jews requiring 2 person to drive on the green light.

A brochure ; “Training. in Non-Violence, " published
by the Fellowship of Reconciliation, was aval Tahle’ at the
vorkshop. A booklet, "Theory and Practice of Civil Disobedience,"
by Arthar Yarver, Centerbury, New Hampshire, also was avail-

+ able, and a charge of fifty cents for that booklet was requested.
‘

The yorkshop concluded at approximately 10:30 pim.
on. dJanuaryy20, 1968. Most of the persons present indicated
they world r2turn for the meeting on January 21, 1968, inase
much’ as many of the twenty-six individuals present appeared
Le be Ohio State University studerts.

ueaeueees On January 19, 1968, Pat Shafer had emphasized

that selection of individuals to attend the workshop on January 20
and 23, 1968, should be-done with great care, and persons
attending vould be expected to have the ability to return to

their own areas and hold workshops on non-violence.

a@ Negro male, bern April 9, 1937, residing at 1219 N. W. 66th

Supporter of KING rather than agitator.

ASHAUER stated that ke has discussed this matter’ in
detail with Sergeant EVERETT KAY, Intelligence Unit, Miami,

toward Dr. KING. BEEEEEEEEEEHT

On February G, 1988, ALPRONSO WOODALL telephonically
contacted the Miami Office “of the Federal Bureau of Investi-
gation, to reyort that he is currentiy employed at the Four
Ambassadors. He reported that Dr, MARTIN LUTHER KING will be
staying at the hotel in the near future. He went on to
relate that ke had been questioned by members of the Southern

wass going to picket Dr. KING when KING arrives in town.

Picket KING or to do anything agains t KING during KING's visit
to Miami. 7 BEEP

“On February 9, 1968, Hit 1, who has furnished
reliable information in the past, advised that ALPHONSO WOODALL
is well known to him. He reported that WOOPALL is violently
opposed to all. that Dr. HARTIN LUTEER KING stands for and
that it could be expected that YOODALL will attempt some type
of pretest, during KING'’s visit te Miami. MM T-1 reported
that he has no positive information in this regard, but will
be glort Zor aay unusual activities om the part of WOODALL.

i T+1L reported that a close friend and essociate
ef WOODALL is THOMAS WASHINGTON, a Negro male, described as
a "disciple" of ADAM CLAYTON PF LE. He said WASHINGTON comes
from the Liberty City section of Miami and is the type of
individual who would assist WOODALL in demonstrations against
Dr. MARTIN LUTHER KING. *



RE: WASHINGTON SPRING PROJECT

ALPHONSO WOOBALL first.came to the attention of
the Miami Office of the-Feder2l Bureau of Investigation. on July
ll, 1967, when he telephonically advised that a group of
Negroes “wore meeting at the Mary Elizabeth Sotel, Miami,
Florida, Wheh contacted on July 31, 1867, WOODALL displayed
newspaper clippings concerning himseif. These articles
indicated that in April, 1987, he*’picketed Dr. MARTIN
LUTHER KING in Cleveland, Ghio. He picketed KING because

-of KING's stand against, tte war in Viet Nam. [It was also

- indicated in the: clippings that he picketed KING because he,
WOODALL, had anl8 yéar old sehial who was killed in A fiaity Nam
in January, 1587,

WOODALL was aise yuoted in these articles as a
saying he was going to get STOKELY CARMICHAEL with violence
when he comes to Miami; however, CARMICHAEL has never come
to Miami. at

o It was alse’ indicated that he threw a brick through -
the window of Congressman ADAM CLAYTON POWELL’s campaign
headquarters in New York City a few years ago. He hoped to
get arrested and then expose the way POWELL was financing his
campaign for re-election to Congress. Accerding to WOODALL,
they just repaired the window and never said anything.

When questioned concerning these articles,
‘ WOODALL stated that he never intended to commit any act
ef violence if CARMICHAEL had come to Miami, but merely
intended to picket him as he had KING, and was misquated
by newspapers,

On August 2, 1967, WOODALL telephonically contacted
the Miami Office of the Fed 1 Bureau of Investigation ac
about midnight, , At this time, he appeared to be very upset,
and WOODALL stated that le had heard that MARTIN LUTHER XING
wes going to come to Miami in the near future and that he was
going to again picket him. He indicated that this picketing
would be of a peaceful nature.

- . WOODALL appears to become upset over information
concerning KiNG because of the death of his sen in Viet Nam
and also because he hus another son currently Serving in

“the United States Army.

On the morning of August 4, 1967, WCOLALL
telephonically contacted the Miami Office, at which time

a that on that date William*Rutherford, Executive Rivector
..0f the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC)

‘was in contact-with Stanley Levison. Ruthérford told

Levison that he had been’ in Philadelphia attending a .

meeting, that there are some very important things going

on in Philadelphia, and that the situation there is the

best situation "we" have*going. However, the source was

unable to ascertain clarifying information about the

situation in Philadelphia that Rutherford referred to.

The source continued that Rutherford advised
e Levison that the situation in Washington, D.C, was confused.
He noted that they (SCLC representatives) held a couple
. of ‘meetings "with Rap Brown and his commandos -occupying
the place with walkie talkies and bodyguards” He added
that "they invaded this church and took it over. They
wouldn't let people in," He said that "they" threw the
press out. of the meeting and that "they walked out of the
meeting, disrupted it, occupied the church, and literally
kept SCLC Board members out." The following morning,
according to Rutherford, a picture of Stokely Carmichael
appeared on.the front page of the "Washington Post",
captioned "Stokely Carmichael Discusses Washington Campaign
with King" (Martin Luther King, President of the SCLC).

Rutherford rvélated that the day following the
church meet ing they (SCLC officials) held a private
meeting “with these guys" and "Vit into them". Rutherford
stated that he told Stokely(Carmichael) that he, Rutherford,
' wanted to hear what Stokely had .to say,and that Stokely
~ "gave some "mealy-mouthed excuses" that did not stand up.
Rutherford also noted that he told Carmichael that "these
“men told us" that they are interested in the‘total
destruction of the United States. 7 .

. Levison commented that he had heard Stokely say
this and Rutherford's comment was that "this is what
Rap (Brown) said last nigtit". Rutherford continued
that Stokely is now “sweet as pie. He pulled a power play
on us in Washington", but did not win anything because
everybody was’ opposing him, 7

Levison commented that he could not see the: SCLC
letting ten persons who threaten violence take over from
hundreds, He described it’as a dangerous thing, a king of
black facism. :

Rutherford, in referring to the meeting, related
that a person named Courtland (phonetic),whom*he described
as having been with the Congress of Racial Equality, made

.' the statement that "they" would not support "our: campaign"
: in Washington, D.C.; but would nat participate in eny
opposition to it,” He said this is "their whole live", that
: although they could not take part in something they do
aon not believe in, even though they have trouble fron their
constituents, they would not oppose it because armthing
that-leads to liberation is worthwhile.

Rutherford said that King became very upset after
this private meeting and began berating him. He said he told
King that what "they'"said is clear and that the SCLC knows
now where they stand, that all the SCLC wanted and needed

"from them" was that they would ‘not attempt to “divide
the community. He said "they" were honest, that “they”
stated that if the SCLC.fails in Washington, "we're going
to get at lot of new recruits ! but if the SCLC is successful
‘se are goirig to be in trouble". He recalied that at
this moment King made a point, that if “they" should
denounce the government, denounce the SCLC campaign and
criticize it, this would create an atmosphere within wnich

- non-violence would -have a better chance of succeeding
He added that- Stokely responded that they have enough
problems, that there is enough confusion and division
in the black community, and that, if they should speak
out against King or what he is doing, People will not
lmow which way to turn. “ i

Levison commented that he agreed with Carmichael
and disagreed-with King on this point. He Meee as to
why King was upset. .

Rutherford stated that King said the” enemy was
vidlence and began to preach on how violence begets
violence.

Levison related that the key is that King states
the enemy- is violence which is not true. The enemy are
the forces preventing them from getting rights and violence
is one of the methods. He said that, therefore, they are Hq
trying to develop a counter technique to violence. |

WASHINGTON SPRING PROJECT (WSP)
, RACIAL MATTERS _- é :
A confidential source, an agency which collects
security type information in the Chicago area, advised as
follows, on sialecteercces 8, 1968:

On: the’ evening of February 2, 1968, a meeting

was held at the offices of the West Side Organization CwSO) ,
‘Chicago, for the purpose of affording Martin Luther King,
Jee, an opportunity to solicit support from WSO members

: . the Washington Spritig Project (WSP), being promoted
and organized by King's Southern Christian Leadership
Conference (SCLC). As publicly described by King, the
WSP is an effort to mobilize large numbers of persons
in Washington, D. C., in April, 1968, in protest of
alleged United States Government failure to solve the
problems of the poor in this country.

As it developed, King did not appear. It was
announced King's wife was ill.

Approximately 95 persons were present.
Appearing | for King at this meetirgwas Reverend Ralph
Abernathy; SCLC official, and Reverend James Bevel,
of the Urban Training Center, 40 North Ashland, Chicago,
former SCLC official in charge of the Chicago SCLC staff.

Both Bevel and Abernathy advised those present
of the purposes of the WSP, and requested support for
and participants for it, There was no response ab all
evident to appeals of either Bevel or Abernathy, to ~
the evident disgust of both. 7

RE: WASHINGTON SPRING PROJECT : _ SOHRIDENTrAt-

: : Both related that the demonstrators would set
° - up tents.on the White House law, in Washington, and
that evérybody who participatesishould be prepared to go
to jail. Bével advised that the White House does not
belong to President Johnson, that it was God given to
SeEEER the people. Bevel and Abernathy advised they would remain
in the "confines" of the White House, until Congress
++ agrees to such as a guaranteed annual income: for black
- people. caueauuuue : il .
Josephine Baker; described by source as a former
well-known entertainer, now residing in France, was also
a guest speaker, She stated she had experienced a
difficult time getting back into this country. She had
marched with Dr, King on his earlier march on ‘Washington,
and as a result it appeared she was not wanted here.
’She described the importance of the tent-in on the
e White House lawn, and urged all those present, to
participate. Her remarks, according to the source, were
. also received by those present with no enthusiasm, and
no apparent volunteers.

Regarding James Bevel, a second confidential
source, who has furnished reliable information in
the past, advised in March, 1966, that Bevel had
recently been present at offices of the West Side
Chicago W.E.B. Du Bois Club. Discussion concerned
the recent notification that the Attorney General
of the United States intended to label the DuBois
Clubs as a communist front. Bevel advised he would
have ignored this notification, feeling that if the
DuBois Clubs have a real program of help for the
people, then the people would answer for the clubs,
despite any labels.

Most present agreed that the attack on the
DuBois Clubs was a part of the plan of the
"establishment" to undermine the civil rights
movement, only a beginning which would lead to
a full attack on the SCLC, the real target.

On February 5, 1968, BH T-1 advised that Rev. F. L.

* Shuttlesworth was to have-participated in a leadership meeting

in Washington, D, C,, on February 6, eran regarding Rev,

M. L. King's planned march ‘in April. BH T-1 said Rev, Shuttles-
worth has stated he does not look with favor on any coalition
between hippies, radical-p&cifists, draft card burners, black
power exponents and the civil-rights ov “ganization becatse he
cannot conceive of anything short of violence taking place

when these type factions get into a demonstration.

BH T-1 said Shuttlesworth recently stated, "It would

‘be impossible not to get the wrong people in such a march and

once violence got started you couldn't control it." According
to BH T-1, Shuttlesworth intends to raise questions about the
wisdom of King's widely publicized Washington demonstrations
for April. BH T-1 said Shuttlesworth feels that Rev. hing will
try to find an honorable way to back down from the planned
demonstrations, Rev. Shuttlesworth said the country is in no
condition té stand "that type of thing" but he is opposed to

the Vietnam war and also to draft card burning.

It is noted that Rev. F. L. Shuttlesworth is president
of the Alabama Christian Movemene for Human Rights, a proe-
integration organization with headquarters in Birmingham,
Alabema. Rev. Shuttlesworth presently resides in Cincinnati,
Ohic.

According to this source, Wiley was at a recent

meeting in New York City, New York, where support for the
WSP was solicited by SCLC personnel} however, Wiley would not
agree to participgqte in this SCLC project. King's contact
with Wiley in Chicago, therefore, will represent an effort to
persuade him of the impor tatice of lending: his support to the
WSP,

WASHINGTON SPRING PROJECT

e

The discussion‘in this conference began with the
subject of financing the WSP. Also discussed were the merits J
of having Martin Luther King make.« speech during the WSr.
Stokely Carmichael stated that heé-is in favor of the goals
and aims of the WSP and that he would support this project
. wholeheartedly. However, he insisted that his organization,
SNCC, and any other organization which would take part in
this project, would keep their own identity separate from
SCLC. This was agreed to by the representatives of SCLC.

During the above discussion, George Wiley entered

the room in which the conference was being held, and after .
listening to the conversation, stated that his organization,
the National Welfare of Rights Oganization, could not support
and participate with SCLC in this project under the conditions
stated, A considerable time was then spent in an effort to a
convince Wiley to support this project, however, he stated

« that before agreeing to give his support, it would be necessary
that he discuss this matter personally with Martin Luther King,
President of SCLC,

i A copy of this communication is being provided
to the following local agencies: .

United States Attorney, Chicago, Illinois;
United States Secret Service, Chicago, Illinois; and

Region I, 113th Military Intelligence Group,
Evanston, Illinois.

Concerning Jesse Gray a second confidential source
advised in January, 1964, that according to a high level
official of the Communist Party in New York, .Gray was no
longer a Communist Party member but remained friendly to
the Communist Party. .

‘17 different areas, During the second week, calls will be

‘ a PROJECT (WSP) at

Au sources used in this communication have
furnished reliable information in the past. -
’- + gy 7-1 advised on December 3, 1967 that he
recently learned that during the week commencing
November 27, 1967 the Southern Christian Leadership
Conference (SCLC) held a retreat at Penn Center, Frogmore,
* South Carolina, which was presided over by Rev. ‘MARTIN
LUTHER KING, JR., President of SCLC and was attended °
by approximately 70 individuals comprising the headquarters
and field stafr of SCLC. :
The primary purpose of the retreat was to discuss
- .Various facets of SCLC's plan to conduct massive nen-
“violent demonstrations in Washington, D. C. and pessibly
a number of other cities during the early part of 1968.

Reverend KING outlined this plan to thess attending
the retreat; namely, that it had ‘peen tentatively decided
that in the forepart of February,” 1968, he, together with
other officers of SCLC and in all probability leading
‘representatives of other Civil Rights organizations (not
: identified) would ‘personally present to the Secretary of
Labor specific requests for prompt Congressional actioti’
pertaining to employment, income, housing, education, and
other matters which constitute major problems experienced
by ghetto people.” In the event these requests do not
receive an immediate unequivocal commitment insuring ~
prompt Congressional ection, an immediate massive non= ~ .
Violent demonstration would commence in Washington » DG.
-This demonstration would be conducted by SCLC and involve
.adults from all walks of life, including ‘Students - and
school children. If an-effort is’ made by civil and/or
military authorities to quell this demonstration, simultaneous:
Tot demonstrations of identical magnitude would: commence in

10-15 "target cities” throughout the nation.”

RE: WASHINGTON SPRING PROJECT (WSP

CV T-1 was not aware of the identity of all the |

“" Wtarget'cities" referred to by Rev. KING but he understood

Cleveland was one of the cities included. teat
- . Cv 1 went on that according to Rev. KING ‘that
during the period prior.to early February, 1968, one os
two SCLC staff members would be assigned to Washington,
oa C. and. each of the "target cities." It will be the
esponsibility of these members to select in each community
a to 200 individuals who will serve as leaders for
demonstrations. This type of individual sought will be
unemployed Negro males, whose general economic status is so
low that they could lose nothing by participating in the
proposed demonstrations. After selection of these individuals
it would then be the responsibility of the SCLC staff member |
-through mass meetings, workshops or other procedures to
indoctrinate these individuals with SCLC's overall :
objectives and technique. of non-violent demonstration,

- Rev.--KING emphasized that the individuals so sélected

“~

should be Negroes, however, he said once each demonstration
is actually commenced the assistance of white persons
would definitely be accepted and possibly solicited.

Reverend KING acknowledged this program of
demonstrations was.a very substantial undertaking for SCLS
to embark upon. He said it was imperative that SCLC be
successful in this undertaking because otherwise not only

Mould it be embarrassed by a failure but failure itself

would (ina large sense serve as a victory for the "Black
Power" groups. In this connection, he said’ it would be
necessary to solicit the cooperation of "Black Power"

leaders (not identified) in order thet such organisations
would permit SCLC to conduct its program without inter-
ference. He said he was extremely concerned over the —~
probability that such interference might easily turn any
Semonstration into a riot. He declared that if such a -
situation developed in any one of the communities in’ which

_SCLC contemplates demonstrating SCLC will immediately

cease all its activity in that community.

During the retreat an appreciable number of
SCLC staff members expressed doubt that the cooperation

“

of the "Black Power" organizations could be obtained and
raised a question as to whether the selection of up to

200 individuals in various communities might not pres ent”

a most difficult task. Reverend KING responded by stating ~-
he was most confident he couid obtain the desired cooperation
of "Black Power" leaders. He said he realized these people
did not agree with his methods or the activities of SCLC

-but is confident they have sufficient respect for him to

listen to his reauests: He also said he wes.quite confident

that people, after being apprised of SCLC's objectives,

will be anxious to assist. Furthermore, he expréssed optimism

that once the demonstrations commence there will be sufficient

Sympathy on the part of the general public that SCLC will

Will receive adequate financial support.
- eV T-1 subsequently learned that Rev. KING had

informed SCLC. staff members that this new activity would

be called Washington Spring Project. ‘

- CV T-1 also advised on December 19, 1967 that

he recently learned that various assignments had been

made of SCLC members to various, cities in the United

On January 17, 1968, CV pom also furnished ~
information regarding the SCLC conference held at Atlanta,

the conference, Rev. KING said there was no doubt that
the requests that would be presented to the various
government agencies would receive a non-committal type ia
response. Then 200 demonstrators previously recruited by
SCLC in approximately 15 communities will then commence
& massive non-violent demonstration in Washington, D. C.

In conjunction with the activity of the

approximately 3000 demonstrzters in Washington, D. C.

SCLC contemplates that in each community from which these
. demonstrators come there-will be sympathetic simultaneous
demonstrations. These demonstrations will be participated
“in by individuals who do not go to Washington, D. C. but
experience the same probiems and seek the same solutims
as the demonstrators in Washington. SCLC intends that the
demonstrators will not’ be intimidated in their efforts
by injunctions or other legal measures defigned to serve’
es deterrents. The demonstrators will submit to arrest and
‘incarceration without bail, however, the place of an incar-"
cerated demonstrator will be assumed by another demonstrator.

CV T-1 had also learned that Rev. OSBURN had
been out of town for some time as he had been attending
an SCLC conference in Atlanta along with 150 other people
but that OSBURN returned to Cleveland on January 18, 1968.

* OSBURN mentioned on his return that would have to” get the

returned -to Cleveland but_then made another.visit to .
Atlants. for additional inStructions regarding Cleveland's

OSBURN indicated that his organization now planned to

D.C. These people who will be unemployed and have nothing
to lose would not have the funds to wake this trip or to

WASHINGTON SPRING PROJECT
RACIAL MATTER

On January 17,1968, a confidential source
: advised he had learned that the Southern Christian
Leadership Conference (SCLC) on that date culminated
a three-day retreat held in Atlanta, Georgia. This
retreat was heid in facilities of the Ebenezer
Baptist Church of which Reverend Martin Luther King,
dr., President, SCLC, serves as co-pastor and aiso
attended by approximately 50 individuals. Approximately
‘one half of the individuals in attendance were SCLC
field representatives from various locations. A
. representative (identity not known) of the American
..Friends Service Committee attended this retreat.

Reverend King served as the presiding officer
at the retreat, the essential purpose of which was twofold.
First, to afford SCLC staff members opportunity to fully
understand the objective of the SCLC Washington Spring
Project, discuss anticipated problems and seek solutions
thereto. Secondly, to permit Reverend King to infuse
SCLC staff members with enthusiasm to participate in the

‘ project in order that it wild be a success.

An appreciable amount of time atthe retreat was
devoted to group discussions by the SCLC field representatives

WASHINGTON SPRING PROJECT

‘wko will: recruit demonstrators to participate
in the Washington Spring Project.- James Bevel,
former Director of Direct Action, SCLC, and
Hosea. Williams, Director of Voter Registration
and Political Education, SCLC, actively participated
in these discussions, Both Bevel and Williams have
- had considerable experience in the area of Civil. E
Rights demonstrations. . . ane

Reverend King lectured several times
during this retreat concerning the overall purpose
of SCLC's Washington Spring Project. He pointed
out this project would be predicated on the issue
of jobs or income for Ghetto Negroes and impoverished
people of all races in the United States. However,
he emphasized this would not solve all the problems
experienced by the Negro, particularly those
regarding ‘Lnequality and therefore the Civil Rights
Movement as a whole will have many things to achieve
as years go by.

Acquiring jobs or income for Negroes alone,
pr. King declared, will be a noteworthy achievement
on the part of the Washington Spring Project, however,
he stressed that the jobS or the income obtained would
represent a mere fraction of that which America owes
the Negro throughout history. He said America owes an
incalcunble sum to the Negro who throughout his long
years of involuntary servitude labored to build this
eountry.

Dr. King stated that the many problems of “the
Negro and other poor people will not be solved under
a Capitalistic system. Capitalism,he said, has no remedy
for the poor. The ultimate aim of all agerieved people
ct in the United States can only be to accomplish a change
7 in the existing Capitalistic economy and Government,
He suggested this change might be to "some form of
Socialistic Government". Reverend King did not discuss
7 _ in any detail how or when the change he referred to
might be accomplished.

| WASHINGTON SPRING PROJECT

i On January 17, 1988, during his closing
comments at this retreat Reverend King emphasized
to the SCLC staff that the forthcoming Washington
Spring Project will be one of the most difficult
tasks which it to date has undertaken and
accordingly challenged the staff to maintain itself
both willing and able in order that the project wiil
be successful.

Reverend King referred to how Jesus found
it necessary to send His disciples on various missions.
He told the members of the SCLC staff that they were
"his disciples".

. BEVEL, im early March, 1966 was observed to be
_present at the offices of the West Side 4.8.8, DuBois
Giub in Chicago (BCC). Discussion towk placé at this time
centering around reaction to @ recent motizication that
the Attorney General of the United States intended to
label the DuBois Clubs as a Communist front. BEVEL,
in conversation, stated that he would have igmored this
notification, and kept about the work im which he -
was engaged. He felt that if the PeSeis Clubs have &
reai program of help for the people, them people would
answer Lor the clubs despite amy Labels applied a them,

Most present agreed ‘that the attack on ‘the ce
DuBois Clubs was @ part of the’ plan by the "establishment":
to undermine the civil rights movement. They felt that™
the recent fearings imto Klan acti vities in this eountry was
only a beginning which would lead to @ full attack on the
Southern Ch Lew ease (SCLC), the real
‘target. Ome of those presene sed during the course
of this discussiea that he was mot a Communist, amd to this
BEVEL was overheard to.reply that every thinking American
should be. e Stated that Negroes Lave met begua to read

Re ee ee

: A source advised that on October 26-27, 1963, a
Conference of members of the Communist Party, USA (CPUSA),
including national functionaries, met in Chicago, Illinois, for
the purpose of setting in motion forces for the.establishment of
a new national Marxist-oriented youth organization which would

hunt for the most peaceful transition to socialism. The delegates

were told that it would be reasonable to assume that the young

Socialists attracted into this new organization would eventually
pass into the cP itseli. .

2 A. second source has advised that the founding conventiou
for the new youth organization was held from June 19-21, 1964, at
150 Golden Gate Avenue, San Francisco, California, at which time
the name W,.E,B. DuBois Clubs of America (DCA) was adopted.
Approximately 500. delegates from throughout the United States
attended this convention.

. “The second source advised in September, 1966, that MIXE

: ZAGARELL, CPUSA Youth Director, stated that in Negro communities

. the Party Still supported the plan to build "left" socialist
-@enters and to solidify the Party base through the DCA, This
source also advised in September, 1966, that DANIEL RUBIN, CPUSA -
National Organizational Secretary, stated the Party believes the

WASHINGTON SPRING PROJECT’ “

7 “on Jaruary 16, 1968, Lieutenant GEORGE FENCL, Philadelphia
Police Department, Civil Disobedience Unit, advised that on

January 11, 1968, SAMES ORANGE, who was ‘associated in some. way with -
Dr. MARTIN LUTHER KING and the Southern Christian Leadership
Conference (SCLC), was identified in Philedelphia and surveilled
throughout the day. Tf as determined by the surveillance that
ORANGE was staying at Q Lineoln Drive, Philadelphia, which was the
residence of Dr, ROBERT ANDERSON, novfurther identified by the.
Philadelphia Police Department at this time.

During the evening hours, ORANGE went to the Universal
Church of Restoration at Gorgas Lane end Stenton Avenve in Philadelphia.
ORANGE and another individual went into the rear of the church. A
List of license plates of other individuals! automobiles who entered
the church that evening was obtained by the Philadelphia Police’ Déepart+
ment. The registered owners of these automobiles are being checked
by the Philadelphia Police Department .

About 11330 pom.» ORANGE left the church with an unidentified
Negro male in a 1959 or 1960 Chevrolet, Tennessee license Jj8626. This
license was subsequently determined to be that registered to JAMES E,
WOODRUFF, 3211 Batavia Avenve, Nashville, Tenn. The Reverend JAMES E
WOODRUFF is presently employed by the Episcopal Diocese of Pennsylvania
in the Race Relations Section of the diecese., The Reverend WOODRUFF
is also the individual wno was involved in the summer of 1966 with

“the Liberation School in Nashville, Tenn., in which the Chief of Police

of Nashville, Tenn., alleged that the Liberation School, which was
finded -in part by the Federal Office of Economic Opportunity, was
teaching "hate whitey" classes.

ORANGE was observed driving a 1965 Pontiac sedan, Illinois ;
license KT3925, which later investigation determined was registered to

When ORANGE returned to the residence at ‘6514 Lineelsi
Drive around midnight, January 12, mae the surveillance was
dropped. :

"On January 12, 1968, ORANGE was spot surveilled by the
Philadelphia Police Department, however as of mid afternoon
Saturday ORANGE could no longer be located.

On January 17. 1968, confidenzial informant PH T~1,
who has furnished reliable information in the past, advised tha+
he had received unverified information that an individual
identified only as CRANGH had been at a meeving sometime around
the middle or latter part of December at the St. Thomas Episcopal
Church, 5end and Pine Streets in Philadelphia during the evening,
meeting with civil_rights leaders in Philadelphia. It was PH Tel's
understanding that GH represented Dr. MARTIN LATHER KING and
the SCLC in regard to KiG's coming project scheduled for the
spring of 1968 in Washington, D.C. and other cities.. The gist
of the meeting was to the effect that if Philadeiphia civil rights
leaders were to support Dr. KING's presence of SCLC in Philadelphia
sometime in early 1968, that any money collected through SCLC
‘efforts in Philadelphia would be used in Philadelphia rather than
‘being taken out of the city for the National Headquarters of SCLC
as had been done on a number of former epasenences of Dre. KING in
Philadelphia. 7

: PH pel had no information as to whether or not this was
: accepted by ORANGE, SCLC, or Dr. KING. °
