2. ™ (provided the writer with a copy of the cable
CIN 944357, dated 8 June 1976),
which is attached. In substance, the cable reflects that
circa 8 June 1976 a Guatemalan source, with the knowledge ef
Guatemalan President EAUGERUD, provided the (Guz ‘Station
a written report, and a detailed briefing, concerning a plot
to assassinate President LAUGERUD. According to the informa-

Guatemalan government for the past six months or
so. He claimed that two Americans were involved
with ZIMERI, one of them who runs a guard service

in Miami, ct "| did not mention names but
described one of the-Americans as about six feet
. four inches and weighing about 250 pounds.

4. The Guatemalan report of the assassination plot ends
with five requests for information by President LAUGERUD:

a. Is ZIMERI still in the United States?

b. In the event ZIMERI is not in the United
States legally, deport him to Guatemala.

c. Is ZIMERI recruiting merceraries in the
United States for possible use in
Guatemala?

d. Does ZIMERI receive any kind of prefer
tial treatment by U. S, authorities whi
permit him to carry firearms, as well as
to purchase arms and ammunition for
shipment to Guatemala?

e. Any information on Robert and Gerald .
HEMMING?
S. On 19 June 1976 ww wo advised

that DDO is referring the entire matter to the FBI and State
Department.

6. Office of Security indices are negative in pertinent
variations of the name of ZIMERI or Robert HENNING.

7, From the name, physical description, activity

is identical with the subject of Office of Security file
423 229, who has been described as six-foot five, 250 pounds,

of Nay 1975 was ostensibly employed by a private investigation

Claimed Agency affiliation when in fact there has besa.
The most. recent incident wherein HENMING claimed s
affiliation was in May 1975 when he volunteered his servi
to the Drug Enforcement Administration, Geraid Patrick I
is a long-time cohort of Frank Anthony STURGIS (SF#353 459),
aka: Frank FIORINI, of Watergate notoriety who also has a
long-time record of falsely claiming Agency affiliation. In
the late 1950's HENMING and STURGIS, both former U.S. Marines,
joined Fidel CASTRO in Cuba but returned shortly thereafter
claiming disillusionment with the CASTRO cause. Soon thereafter,
STURGIS organized a group of mercenaries for Caribbean and
Central American activities which he named the International
Anti-Conmunist- Brigade. A reported sub-unit of this "Brigade"
(the backers of whom have never been fully established) was
named the Intercontinental Penetration Force, headed by Gerald
Patrick HEMMING.

9. For an appreciation of the possible ramifications of
a Guatemalan government expose of this assassination plot
involving HRNMING, you are referred to attachments to instant
memorandum, to wit: a memorandum by the writer dated 10 Jun>
1975 in the name of Frank STURGIS and Everett Howard HUNT, J
and-an extract from a book published in early 1976 written by
Michael CANFIELD and Alan J. WEBERM The book Coup dtetat
in America--The CIA and the Assassination of John
Ts a@ diatribe a; against the Agency and attempts to link the
with the assassination of President KENNEDY. One of the major
links attempted by the authors is through Everett Howard HUNT,
Jr. to Frank STURGIS to Gerald Patrick HEMMING to Loran Eugene
HALL. Loran Eugene HALL was a member of HEMMING's Interconti-
mental Penetration Force. Loran Eugene HALL received nationwide
publicity in 1967 when New Orleans District Attorney "Jim"
GARRISON alleged that HALL (and the Intercontinental Pene
Force) was involved in the assassination of President KEN
and that members of this unit were connected with CIA. G.
shortly thereafter dropped his interest in HALL, but it is
interesting that he did so after Gerald Patrick HEMMING and
another cohort, Robert K. BROWN, joined GARRISCN's investigation.
