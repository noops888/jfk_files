quedo en segundo lugar en el campeonato del D.F. que turo lugar

en el Clué francia, donde practica este deporte. Cuida euchisimo

su condicion fisica y mas que nada su apariencia. En este sentido

es muy vanidoso, Muy pocos amigos saben que tiene una bija de

16-17 años. Cuando le preguntan si tiene hijos hable solo de su

hijo de Il años de edad. Le da pena presentar a su mujer, que es

muy amable y buena, porque se ve de mis edad que el. No fuma, toma

muy poco, aunque cuando la ocasion requiere de tomir mucho agucente

y siempre se le ve sereno. Es muy amablé en el trato. Nunca trata

rompe diplomaticamente los relaciones amistosas con el sujeto.

En sus ideas es de la escuela estalinista: solo cuenta lo Union

Sovietica y la altima, linea a seguir del Partido.

Eso quiere decir

que no tiene ideas propias. Sigue fidelisimamente la "linea" porque

sabe nuy bien que es la anica forms rapida y eficaz de escalar en

su carrera. Le gusta muchisino la vida buena, tipo occidental,

aunque antes se dejaria cortar un brazo que confesarselo asi misto.

Es nuy ambicioso y se ve que tiene problemas con sus conpajeros de

trabajo. Hable despectivamente de ellos. No le gusta nada la idea

de tener que permanecer en losca les dos años que vienen.

que haria lo posible que al transcurrir esos años lo mandaran de

preferencia otra vez a texico. Su ilusion sas grande es trabajar

en sspaja, duora i los españoles, La forma de ser de los rejicanos

no lo gusta. Por eso si quiere regresar, quiere decir que prefiero

cualquier lugar donde vivir, menos rusia. Creo que precisanenie

No sé hasta que punto sus ambiciones puedan guiarto, a prosresar

porque casi desde el principio sentis instintivamente que queria

Subject's story was that he has been in contact with

Valentin LOGINOV (P-11,/12): (he showed COS LOGINOV's cara) and;

as a

matter of fact,

has had no less than 12 contacts with him,

He is scheduled to have dinner with LOGINOV tonight: (20 June) at

2000 hours but he would not say where as he was afraid that COS

would contact the CIA people and survell bim.

He t's also scheduled

to have dinner with LOGINOY on 25 June.-

In the past,

they have

had dinner at such places as la Cava and the other Tecald Restaurant.

Subject

refused to say very nuch about the nature of bis

contact with LOGINOV.

His reason for contacting' COS was to get a

copy of tie latest Embassy phone directory, which LOGiNOV had

asked hin for.

wanted to bring it to LOGINOV so that LOGINOV

would do things for him. He did not say exactly what LOGINOV

could do

for him except that LOGINOV had tavited hin to visit the

Soviet Unton.

LeGINOY has also &iven him several bottles of vodka.

He was not worried about

what LoGTrov could get out of him because,

west an insurance salesman. In othet words, he

seened to be enjoying playing games with LoGInOV and was not

particularly

ready to cooperate

with us. cos said that he would

have to contact the "proper people" to see about the phone book.

: Subject asked Cos to do that and said that he would call cos at

1800 hours on 20 June to vet the answer.

He also said that 1t the

"proper people" were interested, they could contact hin at the

representative of these people will call Subject

lor the phone book, COS will say that this is entirely out

the man who contacts Subject on 23. June v1ll

presumably deal with that.

possible without being hostile of aggressive.

long-range possibilities here because, unless there are unexpected

successor

that Subject contires to show the promise that

he has apparently shown thus raf

I want FERNALD to get as much as

he can out of Subject without either frightening Subject away from

LOGINCY or ruining the possibility of future cooperatiod against

LOGINOV's succesSor.

As for the phone book, I have no intention

of

passing it, at least without knowing a lot more about wnat 18. going

Tale meet was held infleu of. the one scheduled for hey 14

before the scheduled time but I was there still earlier and

I observed

nothing suspicious in terns of stakeouts or surveillance. The meet lasted

75 min. NEXT NDET: Tednesday Hay 28 at the same pick up place.

2.

As we rett I-l stated that he cancelled the last week reet

becaure he was seized by one of hir nervous criste of bysteria followed

by depression (sic). He innediately added that ke prepared for re nothing

because in his condition be was not able to do any work.:

3..

In the rentaurant he kept on describing what effect the nervous

crisis das on him and he added that ke still felt depressed. During: his

description he did cot indulge in dramatizing the matter.

4.

I asked him what happened to the lunch he was supposed to have

with LOGINOV and he repeated what he told me by phone on lay 8 and added

that LOGINOV was to

call him but ald not do it. He added that if LOGINoY

had called during

the past & days the phone would, beenewered only if

his wife vas home. I told him that this fact was a reacon for hin to

Ting up LOGIllOT, because, es me discuesed and agreed on the last reet,

1t would serve no good purpose to I-1 11 LOGINOY would characterize him

as a not desirable person from the sov point of view. He cormented that

he knew nothing ebout fellnsi, except, that hie rife save a birth to a

child during his absence and he added that if Valet had returned be

would had heerd about it.

Speasing about ferel he recalled the fact that Cerole HIRsa,

an Ecuadorian girl of 22 approx. returred to lexico end sbe 1l1 be

takins an lotesive course of Rusten tron I-l. He stated that be spote

to KARTASUX about this girl, she wes here and sorked with lue Olympic

now she returned bere; she came with her mother who found her an epartment

her stat heres in vlew of his nervous crisis he did not keep in touch

wIth her, but he believes that her motter had returned to Quito by now:

LOGINOV knows her fron some of the perties Isl and his friends were

eiving during the Olympies or briefly after thes.

7.

He forgot to tell we that he was with Andrea CATAÑO (P-13,546)

after abe returned fron her trip to the us end Canade and she told him

that she definitely broke with CHERNISH (P-13,042) by telling him that

ke (C) 18 wellcome to come to her (parents) bose when be wishes, but

she le la no porition to reet with hin out.

I asked I-i wes it possible that LOGINOV, who according to bim.

have attenpted to rectuft Juan Tuld Alvinss, director of the language

s0bo0l on Thher, during the past 2 roathe, Il stated that he doubted

that JIA would even vant to see LOGINOV because CG in mary instances

lenored Jis requests through I-l to pase by the school. I-l weat on

thie day and time. Rafael came to thie meet on time ).

The fact that Rafael did not ehow up for the losson wan no

surprice to In1. Neverthelees, about 1830 Rafaelo wife phoned to Il.

I-l concluded that he was inolined to belleve that Rafael got angry #1th

are nor solved (as I surmised they would). Essentially, he has

sold 50% of his business (INZA.) to ä syndicate-group that 1s

paying off Subject's debts. They will construct a big new

factory complex: in Cuernavaca to bring all of Subject's

manufacturing enterprises under one roof and double capacity.

They're also going to open up offices and a showroom on Insur-

gentes Sur. Subject figures he will probably stay

active-for

a couple of years more and then sell his remaining 50s for

about a half million dollars.

3. I told Subject again that I am now anxious for hia

to establish a social relationship with SPYRA (P-6601) and

that I an no longer interested in his developing MAJCHCHRZAK

bitten nearly a week before our date. Once again I

did not smile and gave him little ooporitunity for

that I was annoyed. I could see from Val's expression

that he was embarrassed and off-balance. He has a pecu

good Mexican custom in chatting lightly before

getting

to the matter about which the meting was called.

Neche and San Luis fotosl0 I asked Gloria 1f

she wate going to San Duis Potost this year for the

Holy Week tennis tournaments. She said that she had

planned to do so but was unable to find some one to

go with her. at the last moment. Pepe did not want to

go, and would not let her go by herself unless accom

panied by several other women or by Meche. Meche re-

fused to go saying she would have no fun if with her

mother and planned to go to Corpus Christt by her-

Pepe to Europe addin. Gloria volunteered that

she was annoyed with fede. She deplores his latin

attitude about the double standard. She has been

prohibitted to take several brief trips to various

cities in Mexico

to see friends and family. She is

not welcome to accompany Pepe on his trios. Yet he

will soon

take another month off to travel either

to Europe or to south imerica. Gloria said that she

has been walting all these years for her children to

gron up so that

she could go with pepe on his trips.

that they are grown up, she finds that she still

axpectede to stay home;

Glorla watched carefully. Glorla must account for

her time very carefully to Pebe during the day. And

under no circumstances can she stay out after dark.

Pepe apparently disapproves of Gloila working for me.

He does not like the idea that she will be visiting

businessmen throughout the city both in their offices

and homes. He has expressed his disapproval, but

Gloria has chosen to ignore it.

Discussion.of val. Having completed our business

I raised the matter of Val. I reminded her that I had

explained to her some time ago that I was annoyed with

val's treatment of me in public, namely his flagrant

attempts to recruit me in the presence of mutual frienas..

i tolä her tha t I still hadn't had a chance to talk to.

val in private. I repeated that all I wanted to do was

make it clear to him that I held him in great esteem as

a person, valued his friendshin, was not interested in

assisting his

government, and wanted him to stop jeo-

pardizing our fttendship

with his offensive approaches,

whether subtle and implied of direct and coarse..

I told Gloria that I had planned to have lunch

with val today. I

enjoy Val's companys rarely have a

chance to chat quitely, don't like to eat luach by

myself, and looked forward to explaining to val my

position before he completely destroyed any chance

for us to continue as friends.

Not aware of accident to Dmitri. I tola Gloria

that val had excused himself from our lunch date due

to an accident to his son. She did not know of any

accident other than the dog bite the previous week.

Glorla said that his declining my Invitation

night have been an afterthought. That he did not want

to hurt my by being seen with me in a public place.

Wolds "hurtina" his friends.

Gloria then told me

that val rever accented an invitation to have coffen with

her or l'ene or to dine out. He explained to her that. it

could hurt her to ba seen with him. She savo an crample

of when sho was invited to the ballet with val and a

group of islends.

After the ballet, l'eve and Gloria Invited Val to

join them for dinner. Val declined. Pepe and Gluria

and a large number of embassy officers also arrived.

Val stecred them away from Pepe and Gloria. Shortly

afterwards a man arrived, sat at a remote table and

12133

took notes while watching the sovlets.

Val works mornings only. Gloria mentioned that

val is in the embassy only in the morning. This was

1n response to my statement that. I had tried to call

the embassy and talk to Val to find out what had hap

pened to Dmitri, but since he was out, I would call

in the afternoon. She added that he of course works

in the afternoon,

but outside the embassy. I said "try-

1ng tỏ buy gringos". She said "trying to convince

Mexicang"

COMMENTS

•It seems to me highly unlikely that val is

really concerned about the welfare of his friends

seen with him. It seems quite clear that he con-

siders Gloria

and Pepe,

and perhaps me, as potential

assets. He does not want to be seen with us because

we would lose

our value to him. He told Gloria that

they should confine their contacts to the French

club. This seems to confirm

the suspicion that he

belleves that thesis a secure place to meet people.

It is possible that he chocked with his colleagues

arid they were of the opinion that my choice of the

Liave de Oro for lunch was too public, exposed us

to too many Americans.

I feel.

that Gloria has served a very useful

purpose in this matter. If she 15 working for val,

which I doubt, she is in a position to seo that my

business is indeed legitimato,

time-consuming, and

with considerable financial potential.

Further,

she is in a position to relay to val my unwillingness

to cooperate uith him and his governentn and my threat

to-take

the matter to the embassy 1f his harrassment

continues.

the economic. He secmer disgusted, and sadd Spruce

wasn't worth anything.

Val then said that he wanted me to know that he

was prepired to pay a lot of money for any Information

I might obtain for him. I said I'd talk to Spruce about

It and see if he had anything to sedl so that I could

take my commission. I added that Spruce would probably

faint or tremble with terror--this pleased val greatly.

I then asked val if the Americans had ever offered

him any money for his Information. lie averted my eyes

and answered "not yet".

COMMENTS

Interest In Arerican School. Val asked me 1f I

could recall the address of the American school. He will

call me for xx it. He wants to have his son Dmitri par-

tIcipite in some activities with the children at the

school in order to learn English. Dritri finishes

school at the Russian embassy at 1400 hours. val hopes

that maybe there are some afterschool activities such

as football for Dmitri.

COMMENT

This may be just val's inate stucidity. Maybe he

really couldn't find the American Stdool in the tele-

phone directory.

Perhaps val already knows of some after-school activity

of which I an unaware. Mayke he already knows that someone i

child 1s there, someone he wants to meet. Perhaps he wants

an excuse to wander about the school, meeting people.

Perhaps val couldn't care less abous the school. Per-

haps he is hoping for

an excuse to call me, suggesting our

children practice English together. Perhaps he is preparing

the ground for to go to soncone else he already has in mind

to explain that there is no convenient program of after-

school activities for Dritit. He might ask that person to

agree to have Dmittt play with his children.

It just occured to me that for the first time in many

months Valentin, spoke Russian to me.

Lisa, was present In thu house during the meeting which prompted RIDENANN

to Inquire of Ill 1f the daughter was lausa avare of the type of ro-

lationship which the LIROBBINS had with RIDilAN. WI replied that

"they" had toid thetr daughter inasmuch as she had come to suspect such

a relationship over the past year or so. ASIDENuN felt that It would bo

of little purpose, at this time, to admonish the LIROBEINS and dropped the

subject. REIDEMAN has jound the LIROBBINS to be woefully lacking in

general security principles and has strived, in a tactful manner, to point.

out past shortcomings and possible

socurity hasards - especially with

main course, Chinese beef, prepared by Natallya SARATOVA. Dessert was

accompanied ulth brandy and the evening progressed with long drinks after

Ill stated that SARAIOV drank with the group although b/1 doubted

SARATOV staunchly

C/IC

SUBJECT

:

Consular Corps. Visit to Veracruz

1.

The undersigned visited Veracruz on 9 and 10 November

together with other members of the Consular Corps on

an

official visit to that city.

Although the Cubans were

scheduled to attend and official diplomas proclaiming them

suests of the City of Veracruz were prepared, none of them

showed up, including Lino

SALALAd Chia,

who is stationed in

Veracruz.

The Czechs,

East Germans,

and Poles for a number

of reasons also failed to go on this trip.

Thus, the only

Communist representative was Valentin Sergeyevich LOGINOV,

with whon the undersigned had plenty of opportunity to talk.

It seems that LOGINOV, at least for public consumption,

considers the undersigned "his friend." LOGINOV was accompa-

nied by his wife:

The following were the main points of interest

discussed by LOGINOV:

2..

The Soviet appeared very anxious to get.

the undersigned's opinion on a subject to which

he

kept going back time and again during the visit:

the position

of the Richard N. NIXON administration

vis-a-vis Communist China.

Specifically, what

"LOGINOV wanted to know was what the chances are

that the NIxoN administration night attempt to briug

about a rapprochement between Coumunist China and

the United States.

LOGINOY approached this topic

fron various directions, and the undersigned had

the distinct impression that he had received a

speciric query on

this subject.

At one point,

LOGINOV stressed the importance of Comaunist China

to his country,

"indicating that his government is

beconing increasingly concerned

with developments

there.

SECRET

-2-

b.

Connected with the above was LOGINOV's

concern for peace in Vietnam... For

the first time

that the undersigned can

remeber, a Soviet stated

that the United States and his country had "a

connon interest of utmost importance" in bringing

peace to Vietnam. That the Soviet interest may

be connected with their concern about Communist

•China was indicated by LOGINOV when the latter

indicated that peace sliould be obtained in Vietnar

as a way to keep out the Chinese Communists.

This did not prevent LOGINOV from making the usual

noises in favor of the National Liberation Front

and the Vietcong, blasting avay at South Vietnamese

militarism.

c.

While talking about the Middle

East,

LOGINOV said that the Soviet Union was

in the

Mediterranean to stay

and fully intended to give

such

support to the Arab nations in that area as

to someday

"get rid of Israel."

LOGINOV specifically

stated,

"The Jews have it coming to them, and the

day of

reckoning is coming."

The undersigued was

curious

to know whether this was prompted on

LOGINOV's part by a dislike of the Istaelis or an

anti-Semitic feeling.

LOGINOV was quite blunt and

categorically stated

that he for one

"hated' all

JEWS,

te

and did not hide his profound anti-Semitisu.

LOGINOV added that Jews are parasites who have.

little nationalism other than that gencrated by the

Zionist causc.

lic implied that those Jows left in

the Soviet Union are foreigners who have done little

to help the Soviet cause.

The undersigned pointed.

out that anti-Semitism has been a long Russian

tradition,

dating back to before the Revolution,

and deplored this obvious discrimination.

He added

that this reminded him of the anti-semitisn of the

party which

not so.long ago made mass murder of

Jews a matter of national policy.

d. It took LOGINOV about one day to bring. up

the Sucesos para Todos article.

The undersigned

Jokingly asked him whether this was a Soviet or

cuban sponsored joke,

saying that rumor had it that

Sucesos was financed by both the Soviets and the

SECRET

- 3-

Cubans.

LOGINOV denied this, saying that the staff

of sucesos could not be put by any stretch of the

imagination into the category of "Communists." He

then point-blank asked the undersigned whether he

belonged to the organization mentioned in the

article.

The undersigned laughingly answered that

if such trashy publications is Sucesos were believed

by

anyone "of course he belonged to that organization."

LOGINOV laughed and made a few more noises about how

Sucesos obtained the undersigned's name.

replied that his name was probably selected at

random from stolen pages of the Embassy directory

or other such document:

'He added that if LOGINOV

had wanted his phone number he would have been glad

to have given

it to him rather than see it appear

in Sucesos.

e.

The discussion the undersigned had with

LOGINOV in Guadalajara about the KGB was apparently.

not forgotten by the Soviet,

for the latter pulled

out of his purse a copy of the stamp commemorating

Some KGB anniversary that the undersigned had

mentioned to him.

The undersigned has no idea uf

the reasons for this gesture.

One of the topics

which seems to embarrass LOGINOV the most is the

number of visas he signs at

the Soviet Embassy.

Whenever LOGINOV gets a little too pointed in

his

provocations;

the undersigned raises

this subject,

with LOGINOV invariably giving a little laugh and

no answer.

LOGINOV indicated that he was aware that

the undersigned had met with Jiri SVESTKA at the

time of the Sovlet intervention in Czechoslovakia

and asked for his opinion of SVESTkA ad a long lunch

The undersigned

made no bones about the fact that he

with the czech.

ile said he had found him to be lnuy

belonged to the

very small minority of his country

which had wolcomed Soviet intervention.

The under-

signed predicted that the Soviets would have con+

siderable troublo with Czechoslovakla and pointed

out that this serious error had tarnished the causo

of the

Soviet Union.

He said, for example, that

the soviet intervention was very unpopular in Mexico.

This seemed to draw a little blood from LOGINOV,

he abruptly interrupted the undersigned and asked,.

"There is it popular?"

1o. I met Subject in his room at the del Paseo from 1430 to

1615-

The next weeting will be arranged by telophone.

2. LOCINOY. Not hearing from LOGINDY after their telophone

conversation on 10. May, Subject called him on 30 or 31 May.

Subject told LOGINOV. he couldn't remember who was supposed to

call whom about setting a date for the LOGINOVS" visit to

Subject's home, and he just wanted to check to see that thay

hadn't gotton their signal crossed. LOGINOV said that it wasn't

that he was waiting for Subject to call, but simply that a free

date hadn't opened up yet. LOGINOV said that it didn't look as

though he was roine to be able to set to subject's home for

the next couple of weeks, but that he he definitely wanted to

take Subject up on his invitation and would call him just as

soon as he definitely knew he would have a free Saturday or Sunday

when he could como.

3. I instructed Subject to leave the initlativo for the nost

contact to LOGINOV.

4a Pedro DALMA. DAINA is the general managor of mistAMAr

in Cuernavaca. The firm deals in citric acid. To the best of

„Subject's knowledee, DALMA was born in Hungary and came to

Mexico about 10 or 15 years ago.

Ho is a member of tha

"Industrial Club" In Cuernavaca, and Subject occasionally beets

him there, Subfect said that DAlAl hag tried to be friendly

with him for several years and has many times inylted Subject and

his wife to his home. Subject said he has never liked DALMA,

however, and has always found a say out of the invitations.

One reason ho didn't I1ko DALMi, Subject said, was that he always

grewed to have sonethink good to say about Communist Hungary.

About nine months ago, DALlA took a trip to Hungary, and whenever

Subject has seen him since then, ho has made a point of tolling

Subjoct how good conditions are in Huncary and how happy evoryone

Is there. Subject said ho thought we should therefore have the

follöw's name in our filos.

S: BESABER'S PERSONAL LIFE. In late March, Subject told ne

abort a woman he had met on a business trip to New York earlier

In the month. Hor name 1s Velia SANCHSZ Belmont, Mexican citizen,

age approximatoly 33. Subject happened to sit next to her on the.

flight to New York, struck up a conversation, and ultimtely

spent a few nights with her in New York.

6. Subject told me that Vella was once married to an

American singer, but had been divorced and subsequently become

the mistross of Jultan RODRIGUSZ Adame, a former Mexican

Secretary of Agriculture (under IOFE2 Mateos) and currently the

President of the International Cotton Association. Subjoct said

that through RODRIGUEZ Adame, Velia had gotten to know many of

the top poople in the PRI and had becone particularly friendly with

the wife of Alfonso MARTINEZ Domingues, the new head of the

PRI. Subject said that Velia had becomo fairly wealthy as tha

result of hor influential contacts and now owned an apartment

in Acapulco, where she also had a sizablo piece of undeveloped

Lindo Subject deseribed Te)la as both extremely intelligent

and a tremendous sexual partner, and spoculated that because of

her excellent political contacts, she micht from time to time be

able in provide some interesting information on the Mexican

political scene.

7. I was in Acapulco on 6 and ? Abril, and at Subject's

Invitation spent the afternoon of 7 April with him and Veila

on the beach at the Pierre Marquas Hotel. Subject Introduced no

(by phony name) as a business contact from the States, and I had

the opportunity to calk with Vella at Intervals throughout the

afternoon. As Subject told mo, sho 1a attractive, well-built,

intelliant, polished, very sharp, and evidently very shrewd.

Sho also speaks very good English. She told me she had just

roturned two days aro from a shopping trip to New York with the

Wife of MARTINEZ, domingues, She said the señora 1s really just

a country woman and had asked her to go with her to slow York to

help her pick out a new wardrobe, which she needed for her new

rolo as the wife of the leader of the PRi, He later drove to

Villa's house for à drink, and from its size and Location

(overlooking the bay betreen the socalo and the Caleta Hetol, 1t

would indeed appear she had a considerable amount of money.

8. On 3 June, Subject told me that his romance with volla

had rotten out of hand, as she was extrenely demanding and

rossessive and wanted him to divorco his wife and marry hor.

The problen, Subjoct said, was that he felt dust strongly anowen

about her that he couldn't just dismiss the idea. Moreover, h1s

wife had learned abuut Vella, and =lthough she vas accustamed to

Subjoct's phtlanderIne, she recognized that Volta was a little

different fron subject's other girl friends and was extremely

upset. Subject asked my opinion and advice, and for what 1t

was worth, I told him I thought ho was crazy to even think of

breaking up his family and his marrlage with a woman whom he

clained to still lové and who was tolorant to tho point that

subject: was able to have both her and all the routine extra-

curricular activity he wanted at the same time. I pointed out

that this certainly woulda't bo the case with Vella, who would

probably poison him if ho even looked at another woman. After

battine this around for sume time, Subject finally said he

agreed with me and that 1f he couldn't simply keep Volla on

the string, he'd have no choice but to drop her.

This 1s

hardly to say, however, that this 1s what Subject will do, and

I suspect Volía vill continue to disrupt Subject's personal 11fo

for some time to come.

9. As for our possible use of Vella--and she does seem to

have the credentials to bo one of the kreat femalo sples--there

are clearly two considerations which should be mentioned. Pirst,

any attempt. to use Subject in hor exploitation (at least at thia

point) would further complicate his relations wich her and

presunably firther disrupt his porsonal life. Second, based on

what I know about her from subjoct and from personal contact, I

Soviet Union would nost like to see as the next President.

The two Soviets laughingly romarked that the undersigned's

ipparent dislike for KENNEDY might one day cost him his job.

The undersigned said that forturately the American Government

had a good chuckle over this but did not comment.

3.

The undersigned, who has already had the feeling that

Jiii SlE. Wi apes the Soviets, coples their line, and mimics

their comportment, had confirmation of all this during the

trip.

SVESTKA was one of the fiist to raise the topic of

Vietnan and pour oil over the fire.

During dinner in the

dining co on the vay to Guadalajara,

where he sat with the

undersigned and the

two soviets, the

topic of the Red army

cane up.

The undersigned, who had previously told the Russians

thut he seived ion & brief time wich that army, said that ne

hnd siert admiration for the rilitary forts of

the Russians.

This led SVESTKA to say that the Rod army was never beaten.

The undersigned then gave SVESTKA a short refresher course

in what had happened in War'saw in 1920 or 1921, when a Franco-

Prussian ainy led by Gen. Maxine WEYGAND and Gen. Jozei

PILSIDSKI boat an invading Soviet army,

which had, among

other things,

Joseph STALIN as its commissa.

SVESTKA tried

to dispute the fact that this took place, whereupon the under-

signed

offched to wuy hin a histury book.

That seemed to

pre' ent SVESTkA from making any other expeditions into history

during the remainder of the trip.

most of the discussions

with the Czech, Soviets, and Cubans were on extremely friendly

cerns, in spite of their pointediess t times.

During the

night of 18 May, during the train trip lack to lexico diüy,

a particularly heated discussion took place in a compartment

*CIC CHERNYSH, SVESTKA, and CICARD were present.

This

üiscussion will be reviewed in the noxt paragiaph. Suffice

it tó say. that at one point SVESTKA intervened in the defense

Of CHORNYSH to say something about how indebted Czechoslovakia

was to the Soviets.

The undcisigned tion told him that it it

had not been the decision of president Franklin D. ROOSEVELT,

at the urging,

apparently, of STALIN,

to stop the

advance of

the United States any into Crochoslovakia to allow the

Russians to liberate Prague, the amistice would not have,

and "things

that czechoslovakia would have becona a Communist power had

the soviet amies not occupied the country by the end oi the

SVESTiA said that there was no doubt about this, that

the

coning of the Conmunist regime is Czechoslovakia had

been inevitable because of the historical and social backgrouad

of: he Czechs. The undersigned expressed horror at a staterezt

liko this, which did not take into consideration the fact

that such anti-communists as Jan MASARY and Eduard BEVES

vere

the fathers of the czech state.

SVESTKA then went oa to

say that indeed neither MASARYK NOI BEVES had been Communist,

but

that neither had any deep knovledge of the inborn desires

of the Czech people.

The undersigned told him that this

was enough to make both NASARYK and BENES turn over in their

giaves.

lie pointed

out that there nad been a violent excharge,

uccording to the varican press,

between the Czech and Soviet

paper's over MASARYK, with the Russians

saying that ISARYK

had participated in an attempt to kill Nikolai LENIN.

CHERISH

said that this was a pack of lies,

that he had reviered the

Soviet press for that period and found nothing about MASARYX.

This was quickly endorsed by SVESTKA.

When the undersigned

once more stated his belief that people who had known better

would take the first opportunity to overthrow Comnunism,

both

CHERNYSH and SVESTKA started speaking at the same time.

The

undersigned pointed out that

the Russian people had never

krown anything other than a curb or personal freedom and very.

strong central government, but the Czechs,

the Poles, the

Hungarians, and others had known diffezontly. Such people

were

thirsty for personal freedois and direct control over

neir destiny:

When CHERNYSH said he doubted this, the under-

signod reminded him

that

it was Russian tanks that

had crusted

the students and workers'

revolt in Hungary in 1956.

He also

pointed to the recent quiet but radical revolution which had

taken place in Czechoslovakia, saying that, for example,

che

day ifter the right to strike ned been re-established practi-

cally all workers struck to protest 20 years of mismanagement,

poor housing,

arid lack of freedom.

From that point on SVESTKA

renained sint, apparently having been shaken up.

The

undersigned ailowed himself to thirk that in

several year's

at least the Czechs, like the Runanians before them,

would be

governing themseives without liaving fiest to check with loscor.

sao sis worrying about how things would turn out in Czecho-

siovakia and about his future.

SVESTK4, as a matter of fact,

centioned to the undersigned when he saw him a few minutes

Inter that he had felt that part of the previous night's

discussion had been corducted in what he phrased as a rather

cool atmosphere.

This feeling was obviously not shared by

despite the heat of the discussion, who warmly

in ail of cherist's regazeats.

The undersigned scored a

little

moie duiing the previously tentiored discussion during

the diglt

of 18.lay.

He then hid a bortei chance to compare

the incriona Consticution with the Soviet one, underscoring

the elements of centralisa and cures on personal choice.

The discussion of the toie on the sussians in world lar

perritted his question of whether the Russions had fought for

ChanTSh that his contact with Soviet soldiers during the War

had

"* no doubt

in his tird that the latter had fought for

their country and

families first,

and much later to back up

their regire.

Both SVESTRA and CHERNYSH naturally argued with

this view, paticularly SVESTit,

who at tiris can be nore pro-

Soviet than the Soviets.

as pointed out above, CHERNYSH seems

to like the undersigned's company, and the farewell between

him and the undersigned at the station in lexico City appeared

1.

The celebration of the Czech national day on 9 May

was held at the residence of the Czech Ambassador, Karel HANUS,

in Polanco,

where the undersigned estimated that the crowd

numbered

at least 150 people.

The only other Americans

present were Mr. Wallace W. STUART, head of the Political

Section, and Mr.

David N. WIESLEY, Honorary Consul of Iceland.

•The undersigned

was a little bit surprised to see Rodolphe

BABOUN,

the new

Haitian Actirg Ambassador, In attendance with

a colored Haltian.

BABOUN, as

¿ matter of fact, spoke briefly

to the Cuban Ambassador, Joaquin HERNANDEZ Armas.

Jir1

The undersigned had several little discussions with

SVESTKA, Czech Consul and krown intelligence officer.

When

he casually reminded SVESTKA that Czechoslovakia was an

industrtal power before World War I and that Czech produets

flooded Western Europe,

SVESTKA, sharply comnented that his

country was

'still

an industrial power.

When the undersigned

mentioned that MASARYK was very popular in the United states,

SVESTKA countered that that was no doubt because he had lived

as an exile in the United States. SVESTKA cut short a remark

by the undersigned about the effort currently being

made to

throw light on MASARYK's death by saying, "There is no doubt

that he committed sutcide."

SVESTKA showed himself

on this

occasion a rival of LOGINOY as far as provocátions are •

concerned. After the undersigned answered coments on the

Negro problem and forthcoming urban terrorism and guerrilla

warfare in the United States, SVESTKA mentioned the "overt

letter' to the American Ambassador which appeared in various

local newspapers.

He hinted that the incident

in tho opon

Ambassador FREENAN, but also indicative of the superiority

complex of the United States.

At one point, when Valentin

LOGINOV hnd Joined in the discussion, the undersigned retorted

that tho min who had written the article was a fourth-class

writer without a dime who somehow had found the thousands of

pesos nocessary to place his editorial.

when the Czech and

the Russinn lnughed, the undersigned continued that if the

Sovlet Union wanted to give money to the Nexican Communist

Party to ongage in such shenanigans to amuse the local nerbers

of socialist countries, it was fine with the Americans,

as

this is Just about all

it could hope to achieve.

SV ESTKA

and LOGINOV naturally denied that their countries had anything

to do with tho Mexican Communist Party, not to speak of the

overt lettor on the Ambassador.

The undersigned, tongue in

cheek, thon pointed out that he was glad to tell them for

their information that a Communist Party did exist in Mexico.

Perhaps the most interesting.

reaction of SVESTKA came towards

the end of the party just before

the undersigned left.

During a discussion which included SVESTKA, LOGINOV,

one'of

the soviet

military attaches (a tall. colonel with white hair),

another Russian, and & youngish, short, and chubby member of

the Nexican

Foreign Ministry the undersigned expressed a

thought that the two systems of government, the capitalist and

the

soviet, were gradually inching closer together:

Then

SVESTKA allowed himself to doubt it with a nasty little laugh

the undersignod naturally could not resist telling him to

have a look at what was going on in his country.

The reaction

of SVESTKA was both immediate and noticeable.

le sort of

straightened out, Jerked his head back,

opened his mouth,

dopped the ashes of his cigar on the floor, and obviöusly

bit his tongue as he said nothing.

Fron the above and from

the fäct that SVESTKA plans to drive to the next Consular

Association meeting in Guadalajara with his Soviet colleagues,

the undersigned feels that SVESTKA is not only & lackey of the

ex-NOVOTNY regime,

but very probably in the employ of the

Soviet KGB.

He seems to be inseparable from LOGINOV and has

lately mouthed

the same provocations in the same techniques,

showing himself more and more aggressive, a thing which he

was not a year ago.

Among other nasty little remarks made by LOGINOV,

Including reforences to the open lotter against

the Ambassador,

the

war in: Viotnam, the Negro problem, the difficult finanetal

-position

of the dollar, et cotera, was a reference to this

Station. LOGINOV at one point asked the undersigned where

he worked (not the first time he has asked this).

The under

signed told him that he worked in the Consular General's

Office:

LOGINOV then sald,

"What about the fifth floor?"

The undersigned told him that the fifth floor comprised both

the Anbassador's Office and the political Section.

LOGINOV

went on

to say something like,"'I know about the Ambassador,

but what about the other offices, those occupied by WOFIRM?"

The undersigned let that one go by as LOGINOV had obviously

found it very funny.

He proceeded to pay back the Soviets a

little later by counting on his fingers the number of visas

issued at the Soviet Embassy each year, the number of cultural

oxchanges handlod by the Embassy, staff, and "all the work

done for trade promotion with Mexico:" - The undersigned felt

tha

the soviets probably issued some five visas. a month,

1f

that many, had about ten cultural exchanges a year, and had

practically no trade with the Mexicans.

what, then, he asked,

were the 40 odd "diplomats" in the Soviet Embassy doing in

Mexico?

LOGINOV laughed,

but he laughed green and promptly

broke off this conversation.

4.

The undersigned had no opportunity to talk at any

length with Ambassador HANUS, who was very busy it the

reception. The Ambassador, howver, greeted him warmly and

gave him

a prolonged bear hug as he left.

The undersigned

had no talk with the Cubans except & few words which he

exchanged with Sergio MARTINEZ, whom be had not met before.

to Cuernavaca next Saturday morning (Il May) ?" Subject interjected.

He (LOGINOY) and Mrs. BESABER could play tennis in the morning while

to hear from LOGINOV, and when LOGINOV didn't call, he called

LOGINOV (confirmed by LIENVOT). LOGINOV, according to Subject,

said he was afraid he was not roine to be able to nake it, after

all, because the Mayor of Moscow was visiting Mexico and he would

5. On 246 Apr1l 1967, LIENVOY reported the following call

frOm GAZIYEY to LOGINOW:

GAZE:

"I say him, he arrived yesterday. o

"Excellent.

Then I'd like to see you to discuss

certain

things."

GAZ:

"Then I can come there tomorrow?"

"No, better Wednesday."

Mall right..

He usually comes there at 6 o'clock.

He got

married and came here with his wife. Now

they look for an apartment.

I'll go there on the

10th, because I want to attend courses in English.

This week I'll be busy."

LOG?

"Ok, until the next then."

6. From this conversation, it appeared that CAZIYEY was

probably talking about subject, sinco:

(a) GAZIYEV had been taking Spanish at the Mexican-North

American Institute and I knew from Subject that Subject had had

GAZIYEV in one of his classes, that Subject occasionally chatted

with GAZIYÉV after class, and that GAZIYEV had once given Subject

an invitation to a Consular night at the Soviet Embassy (although

Subject told me he had not gone).

(b) Subject had gotten marrled that month.

(c) subfect had just returned to Mexico with his bride,

Subject and his wife were looking for an apartment.

(a) Subject normally arrived at the Institute at 1800

to teach evening Spanish classes.

7. Prior to this reported telephone conversation, I had

considered using Subject as an actess agent against GAZIYEV,

but had decided not to approach Subject on the matter unless

there was evidence that his relatlorship with GAZIYEV vas

developing into something more than occasional chats between

classes. I did not soo much potential in approaching Subject

before this with oatsdo the idea of having his doliberatoly

cultirato a frlondahly with GAZIYEY, as I Sole SubjocE was lIving

## Page 206

206

such a busy, and hectle I1fe that I would sot very little out

of him. Prior to his marriago, ho was kooping such a hectic

schedule between his Instituto and private classes that he

nasn't sleeping or eating proporly and was having Increasing

problems with his health. If anything, his pace and health

problems increased after his marriage and his taking of the

job with the American School (although he gave up most of his

privato classes) •

8. Since the GAZIYEV-LOGINOV conversation made Subject's

relations with the Soviots look much more Interesting, I attempted

to find out what I could about then from Subject.. Por a number

of reasons, however--including my, going to the States in June

we were not able to get together, until ll July. On that date

I took Subject to a belatad "bachelor's luncht at a littlo

Spanish restaurant downtown.

9. The lunch was disappointing and, for me, misleading.

I as certain that if given the opporturity, subject would

Toluntarily tell me if his relationship with GAZIYEV had

devaloped any further. When I casually brought the conversation

around to GAZIYEY, however, Subject simply told me that GAZIYEV

was still studying at the Institute and that he still occasionally

chatted with him in the halls or over a cup

of coffee in one

of the near-by coffee shops during the 20-ninute break between

the two evening classes.. Subject commentod that he enjoyed

talking with GAZIYEY, as ho vas a simpatico, intorosting guy,

as wall as an outaranding Spanish student. He also added that

they never talked polltles. In roply to an offhand question

about whether he had not any othor Sovlets through GAZIYEV, subjoct

---

## Page 207

207

said that he had not. My inclination wad to believe Subject, and

I went away thinking that either GAZIYEV and LOGINOV had been

talking about someone else over the phone or that they had

never gone beyond the stage of simply talking about subject.

100. On 1 Myember 1967, I ran into Subject and his brother

Javier In Sanborns-Insurgentes. They were about to have a

quick lunch and insisted that I join them for a cup of coffeo.

As soon as we sat down, Subject told ne ha had a problem and

would like my advico. He said GAZIYEV had given him an invitation

to tho 7 November celebration of the Revnlution at the Soviet

Embassy, and although he would like to go for the experience,

he was very concerned that his name nould be put on "the black

List" at the U.S. Embassy 1f he went. He sald that he had

tried to call me at the Embassy after ho got the invitation to

ask my advice, but had been told I was out of town. (I was in

•El Paso fron 25-29 October.) He stated that if he had not been

able to reach me in the next day of two, he was going to simply

walk into the Embassy and ask to see someone from the "security

department" about his predicament. What did I think he should

do?

11. I told Subject to relax and forget about going to the

M.S. Embassy, as the Embassy would not give him any advice

other than to tell him that it

was entirely his own business

whether ho went to the sovlot reception or not. Besides, I

asked, what made subject think hia name would bo put on a

"black Iist" 1f he went. Subject replied that he didn't know

hor the U.S. Embassy did 1t, but reveryone knew the U.S.

the Soviet Babassy. Moreover, he said, even if the U.S. Babassy

refused to give him any advice, at least it nould make a record

of his visit and anyone who was ever interested would his

heart was in the right placo.. He simply did not want and couldn't

afford to get into any trouble with the U.S. Enbassy, he said.

After all, he had an American wife, he might want to go to the

states to study sometine, and they might even vant to go to

the States to live soneday. Seeing that. Subject was indeed very

serious, I became more serlous myself and told him that just so

he wouldn't worry, Ild write a seno to the proper Embassy

department stating for the sake of the record that Subject had

told me ha planned to attend a Sortet Embassy reception, but

wished the U.S. Embassy to know he has doing it solely out of

curiosity and was in no way in sympathy with the Soviet Union.

Subject seened greatly relieved and thanked me very much.

12.

Seizing of the fact that GAZIYEV had given Subject the

Invitation, I asked 1f Subject saw much of him anynore. Subject

replied that yes, he still saw him occasionally, as GAZIYSY nas

now studying English at the Institute. Subject added, on kis

own initiative, that he had also been to GAZIYEV's apartzent

twice and had met another Soviet there on one occasion. He said

that the first time he went to GaZlaYrs was shortly before he

(Subject) got married (Subject it sas marrled about mid-April

• 1967) and the second time was shortly after his marriage, as he

and his wife had gone to dinner at the GAZIYEVS". Subject finisned

eating about this timo, and since ho was in a hurry and bad

his brother with his, I didn't try to question hia any further,

time.

13. My wife and I entertained Subject and his nife at our

lous on 27 November, but the evening was not

meant to and did

not afford an opportunity to discuss the Soviets any further.

Subject did tell me, howover, that he had not gone to the.

7 November Soviet reception afterall, because, despite by

assurances that there was no reason for him not to go, he

felt it was simply safer to stay away foon the Soviet Erbassy

altogethar..

At my suggestion, we agreed to get together for

lunch sometime in the near future.

14. For various reasons, including the poor state of

Subject's health when I called him one day in January, wa did

not get together for the lunch until 7 March. This time, I

played it straight with Subject, told him that I was interested

In anything he could tell me about GAZIYEV and the othersoviet

he had met, and questioned him closely regarding the details.

Subject was completely cooperative, and I am satisffed he answered

wy questions to the best of his abllity. It seeued to me, and

still does, that there has only one possible reason why Subject

had not told me on ll July what he subsequently told me on

I November (1.e., that he had boen to GAZIYEV's home twice and

on one occasion had net another Soviet there). This was that

he felt sorewhat guilty about going to GAZIYEV's and nesting

the other soviet there, and as long as I didn't push him too

hard (which I didn't on ll July), ho felt nora confortable

Ignoring it. The roason he so readily mentionad the tro visies

and the other Sovlot on 1 November was, I think, that he vas

genuinely concerned not to "get luto any trouble" with cho u.s.

Babassy over attonding the Soviet Embassy reception, wished to

Impress no with his sincerity about whose side he was on, and

folt obliged to completely clear the record by mentioning tho

visits to GAZIYEV's home and meeting the other Soviet there.

15• Subject stated that

GAZIYEY had Invited him to his

apartment for dinner about a month before he (Subject) want to

Chicago to get married. This means that the dinner took place

about mid-March 1967. Subject said he had expected to find

only GAZIYEY and his wife in the apartment, but that a third

person was there when Subject arrived. Subject sald GAZIYEV

Introdured the third person as Valentin "something " When I

asked if the last name were LOGINOV, Subject imnediately reacted

and said he was almost positive that was it. Subject's description

of the Soviet also fit LOGINOV: GAZIYEV stated that LOGINOV was

with the Embassy (Subject couldn't remember in what capacity) and

described JOGINOV as a good friend. Subject said that the evening

started off very casually, with LOCINOV expressing interest

In the Spanish courses at the Mexican-North American Institute.

LOGINOV, who Subject noted spoke almost as good Spanish as most

of the Spanish teachers at the Institute, said he'd like to got

a cortificate in Spanish from the Institute and asked Subject 1f

ho could help him enroll, choose the best course for hinto

start with, otc.. Subject replied that herd be happy to, although

It didn't seem to him that LOGINOV needed much instruction 1a.

LOGINGY tould drop around to the Institute sometimo soon.

LOGINOY, no took the load in the comersation most of the

avening, thon began to ask Subject questions which left sunject

ta

day

with "no.

doubt" that he (LOGINOV) was trying to fool Subjoct out

on his political vlous: Subject sald that he couldn't remembor

most of LOGINOV's questions, but he did recall that LOGINOV

began the feeling-out procedure by asking Subject 1f ho didn't

find that the Americans were much poorer at learning Spanish

than other natlonalitler.. He also made various derogatory

remarks about the extent of American Influence in Moxico, Subject

said that after about ten minutes, LOGINOY's purpose became so

blatantly obvious, that he (Subject) stopped the conversation

and told LOGINOY that before they went any farthor, he thought

LOGINOV should know that he was talking to somone who was

"100% capitalist," completely pro-American, and had absolutely

no sympathy with Conmunism. (While this sounds awfully blunt

and Subject was unquestionably trying to make himself look good

in my eyes, the fact of the matter 1s that Subject does tend to

be at* a bit blunt at times, and knowing his Ideological leanings,.

I would not. put it past him to have said exactly this.) Subjact

said that LOGINOV tried to backtrack a bit after this, but the

conversation heated up again a few minutes later when Subject

commented that he had a pretty good idea of what the soviets were

up to in Mexico. When LOGINOY asked what Subject moant, Subject

related the story he once told ne about having boen in Veracruz

a few years ago when a soviet ship was actually of virtually put

under arrest there. Subject told LOGINOV that "everyone know

, the ship was

loaded with Conmunist propaganda."

16. After about twenty minutes, according to Subject, politica

were dropped and the conversation turned to moro innocuous topics.

Subject sald that LOCINOV seemed somewhat Irritated with him, but

on the mole kept his composure very woll and treatod subject

politely for the tro houry of less subjoct remained. As SubjecE

I ras leaving, LOGINOY again said hold come by the Instituto to

see subject in the near future, 'but he never did. One day 1n

Jato 1967 SubJect saw LOGINOY at the gas station on the corner

of Tacubaya and Juanacatian, and LOGINOY greated Subject by

name. However, they did not converse with each other.

17." Subject said that GAZIYEV left most of the politically.

rolated part of the conversation to LOGINOV and never reforred

to the evening again. Howaver, a few weeks after Subject

roturned to Moxico witli his bride, GAZIYEV had Subjoct and h13

wife over to dirner (this would place the second dinner in

abouò mid-May) • This time GAZIYEY and his wifo were the only

others present, and the evening passed without any reference

to polities. Subject saated that he still occasionally goes

across the street 'for a cup of coffee with GAZIYEV between

evening classes at the Institute, but that be has not. been.

to GAZIYEY's apartment again and has never had GAZIYEV to his

home. •

18. Although subject was very aware that LoGiNoV's purpose.

In meeting him was to assess his exploitability, he did not seem

to fully appreciate that GAZIYEV had both fingered him for

LOGINOY and set up the situation for IOGINOV to meet him. I

spelled this out for Subject

and also informed him that LOGINOV

was an exceptionally capable Soviet Intelligence officer. I

also explained that it nas very possible GAZIYEV was using trio

Institute to spot other candidates for intervlows with sovlot

intelligence officers, and questioned Subjoct about GAZIYEV s

activities and contacts at the Instituto, luwover, Subject said

that as far as he could tell GAZIYEV pretty much stuck to himself

at the Institute and did not have any particudar frionds there

whom Subject knew about. Subjoct said he rould keep his eyes

open for the type of thing I was looking for, however, and would

let no know 1f he came onto anything interesting. Subject also

offered to "play up to* GAZIYEV and/or LOGINOV under my guidance

1f I wished, but I declined the offer with appropriate expressions

of appreciation.

19. The question that remains unansvered after all this 15,

of courso, why LOGINOV and GAZIYEV were talking about Subject

ove= the phone on 24 April 1967. According to Subject, the

dinner which LOGINOV attended took place in March 1967, while

LOGINOY did not attend GAZIYDV's second dinner, which took

place about mid-May. Since I am satisfied Subject told me the

truth, it would appear that the "certain things" which LOGINOV

told GAZIYEV on 24 April he wished to discuss with GAZIYEV

concerned how to handle Subject in the light of the LOGINOV-

Subject encounter in March. Whatever LOGINOV had in mind on

2y Aprii, It would appear that it was firally docided that

GAZIYEV and his wife should simply have Subject and his wife

over to a peaceful dinner in order to at least partially erase

the memory of the first dinner.

that she had just played tennis, or was about to play tennis, or plays tennis

boy. she had no partner.

COMMENT

It is possible that Hrs. Laguinor and Mrs.

are part of a communications

channel. Loguinov's basie night have been due to the unexpected appearance a

my wife and the risis that

Subject asked him about the status of the proposed Soviet

PRIKHODKO said that the koxican Governmont had

turned it down. Specifically SALVAT had told the Soviets that

the tourist exchango botwoen the Sovlet Union and Mexico was

so insignificant that it did not justily a reciprocal exchango

of tourist offices (Comment:

Evidentally the koxicans used

the reciprocity lague to deny the Soyiot roquest.)

PRIKHODKO also Bald that Oleg NECHIPORSNKO (P-7482)

would arrive in lexico in October and that he would have a

Job 1n the Embassy, not in the consulate.

While PRIKKODKO was In Subject's office, Senador

ECHEVARRIA, the brother of the Secretary of Goberhavion cano

2. Subject had not seen or talked with CHUTKHOY or any

other Soviet since he and CHMIKHOV were out together on the evening

of d August. At that time, CHNYKHOV suggested that he and Subject

have dinner together the next time Subject was in Mexico City.

Subject agreed

and told CIMYKHOV he'd call him the next time

he was in tonn.

Due to Subject's tight schedules on his visits

to Mexico City, however, it wasn't until 28 September that he called

CHNYKHOV. When Subject called the Embassy, however, he was told

CHMYKHOV wasn't in.

He therefore asked for LOGINOV, who proved

to be in. LOGINOV immediately recognized Subject's voice and

sounded very pleased to hear from him.. He stated that he had

had a wonderful holiday in the USSR (he returned on 27 August),

but was now swamped with work. He added that he had planned to

call Subject as soon as he got things under control. Subject

thereupon said that he was actually calling for CHNYKHOV, because

he didn't think LOGINOV had returned to Mexico yet. LOGINOV replied

that CHNYKHOV wasn't in just then, but they'd both very much like

to visit Subject in Cuernavaca. Subject said that heid like.to

have them, but suegested they hold off for a wook or so until

2. The Soviets: As of 19 January, Subject had not seen or

talked with any of the Soviets since his telephone conversation

IdEn ICGINOV on 28 September. Subject did, however, receive a

Christmas card from LOGINOV.

with my agreement, Subject sent

inexpensive gifts along with Christmas cards to LOGINOV and

GUIKHOV, but they weren't delivered until the week of 15

Jaruary. Subjet explained that before Christmas, he assigned

his salesman the job of delivering a score of Christmas gifts,

including LOGINOV'S and CHAYKHOV'S, around town, but shortly.

after Christmas, found that the salesman had not delivered any

of them. This discovery caused Subject to fire the salesman,

wico had been increasingly derelict in performing his job over

the past few months and who, Subject had recently learned, had

bagun taking

dope.

Subject consequently wrotc "better-late-than-

läd his new salesman deliver them. I have instructed Subject to

Leave the initiative for the next contact up to the soviets.

Policeman Recrutted by LOGINOV

1.

In reviewing LOGINOV's SPR which WEENING has just

completed, I note that LOGINOV recruited this policeman

1577 months

ago and that his first requiroment was on the

BOESTRO! couple.

At that timo no gave LITEMPO-8 traces on

LOGINOV saying that do was a dangerous KGB officer.

LITEMPO-8 subsequently nentioned that the case was continued

and that he, himself, was directing 1t.

like to know the following about this case:

(a) Is it still active?

(b) Did the policeman pass info to LOGINOV.

on the BOESTROM couple?

If so, what?

Was

(c). What type of requiremente has LOGINOY

given to the policeman?

Are any Americans

Involved?

(d). Have any other soviets boen involved with

this case?

no date 0 to man do in 0 stunes

3.

As a basis for discussing

this case you could mention

that

we are especially concerned about LOGINOY because he

specialises in US operations.

He tried to recruit a chauffor

at

the babasay and trted to develop a female Foreiga Service

officor (true):

You might also say ho

MN 1,000.- 11 the printing of the article should be hold because of lack

of advertiaing. $ brought to LoGs attention that half of page of advertising

money as a price of keeping the door open to the Ohinese Emb for S. To

put some coating on the pills added that he would try to obtain an add

Since NECHIPORNin's wife was

Considerable drinking was done and Subject said it was obvious

why they had asked him since the third girl needed a partner. Hor na

Subject said that all of the girls were quite

subject believes. that NECHIPORENKO is very intelligent.

the best Spanish

of any of the Soviets known to subject and due

this facility as well 'as his looks, can pass for a Mexican. Subject

believes

that ALC!!IPORENHO was given the task of cultivating and

attemptia to re-recruite him after LOGINOY falled.

some inter-sting comments about LOGINOV (P-1l,7.12) which seem to

jive with ctber comments which have been made

about him.

had apparently originally bees given the task of re-recrutting

Subject. When he failed, he felt rebuffrd ind las since been very

cool towards Subject.

Subject believes that LOGINOV either has or

thinks he has been given bad marks by his superiors for having

falled with Subject. -LOGINO! is probably jealous of NECHIPORENKO whO

has at least managed to retain Subject's frlendship.

that LOGINOV is not dumb and that he uses his good looks to great

advantage particularly with women.

Subject has recently had some dealings with IVANOV (P-1612) who

is furious for the following reason:

Formerly Soriots leaving Mexico

would take KiM or Sabena to Europe where they would pick up Aeroflot

the following day.

KLl and Sabena would pay overnight hotel costs.

Now, however,

Soviets are picking up Aeroflot in New York.

Because of scheduling, however,

they still must spend at least one

night in New York.

The airlines will not pay this and IVANOV wanted

Subject to cover it.

Subject refused for the very sound reason that

It did not make sense for him to pay $20 for selling a $127 ticket

from which his profit was only $9.

IVANOV became furious and Sibject

jelded by agreeing to pay for IVA!OV'S accommodations and he said he

would do it for those becoming as friendly, such as NECHIPORENKO, but

he would not do it as a general rule.

While Subject was away;

however, his wife went overboard aud got IVANOV four rooms (for two

people). ..

Now Sibject is furlous.

31 July Subject was visited by PRIKHODKO (P-2270) who came

In carrying a copy of Pravda or Izvestiya.

Subject quoter the old

"There is no truth in. Pravda and no

news in Izvestiya," and

PRIKHODKO got mad claiming Subject was acting very unfriendly by

making anti-Soviet propaganda.

PRIKHODKO was very serious.

probably as good and as

accurate a thumbnail sketch on PRIKHODKO that

we are. likely to get. PRIKHODKO,

who said that he wes leaving in

Septeuber; had visited Subject to find out what Subject knew about

a congress of Jewish intellectuals which is to be held in mid-September

in Bogota to discuss the Jewish problem in the Soviet Union.

santed to know whe was going from Mexico.

Subject told PRIKHODKO that

he had not heard if the congress but would check into it.

He did chees

any bualnesa with the sov and they meet about twioe a month for a dinner

At thie point 8 asked was he intarested in meeting hie for friend

Intruot bin how to keep out of troubles and it appeared that s did not

thats be wanted this to be entirely on privato and personal barla mitbout

political elements lovolved, to show the 11ln at Versailles would be

stupid, 1t would just ensble the imperialiste to blast in the papera

that the SovA were gotting Involved in internal politioal mattara of

Mexico, In view of the coning Preaidential electione this could be blown

up Into a coandal.. I-l renarked that he sar no differenoe in showing the

Int told that loG that quite roently he saw in the press bone-

thing written to the effeot that there are preaently in the USSR 4 types

of datention ( concentration.) camps and he wondered whether that was

an Indication that the froedom in the USSR was being trimned agein. LOG

stated that "this was pure imperialiet propaganda". He went on tu say .

that in the USSR the cafes are full of people and that one can hear them

even oritisizing the government. le added that in his opinion there. in

too much (damasiado mucho) freedon in the USSR and other Sociallet countries

Il Stalin was alive 1t could not happen that while the people in America

are openly protesting against the war in Vietnam and against Imperialim

a Sociallat country as Ozecho rizes 1t3 people In Lavor of American and

West Gernan empirialion. "Too such freedom in the USYR results with st1ll

3 Decarber 1969

On 3 December 1959.I nd n uriet conersatic with

HolLy to find out if he knew nny of the Soviets nt the French

club

,and to brief him on these individuals:

He did not know

either CHARMYSH (1-13, 012) Or SHEVCHINKO (P-15, 623) by name' and

WU them uy sight either.

it is not likely that

they

He said,

however,

that he nould keep his cyes

open for them

and would

try to identify sone of the contrcts

Ithey appear to be making at the French Club:

I explatied to hin

who the two soviels

werc.and why

we were interested in them, and

he said that he would be only to happy to do mhat he could.

.?.

I also asked

him about Glorir PINTO (P-13,225) and showed

hin a picture of hoi, but

while he

thinks he nay have seen her,

he does not know her.

He will chock with his wife who may very

well know her since she is a regular player and probably more or

less in the same league with Gloria:

I told ILLY that Glol'ia

had been very close to LOGINOV (l'-11, 712) and that I was interested

to find out

If she would now, since he has departed, transfer her

attention to one of the other Soviets.

(I vas specifically

interested in finding out whether or not floria and CHERNISH had

met on the morning

of

29 November as indicated by LINVOY, but

ELLi had not been at the French Club that worning.)

3.

HiLy commented that he had found it hard to make contacts

at sports clubs in Mixico than in other countries.

Mexicans vere

particularly difficult to becone friendly with and it was not at

all uncommon

to have a tonnis matci with no personal contact

whatsoever.

He said,

C/CUB

Visit to the Soviet Embassy, Night ol

1 October 1969;

Occasion:

Dispedida for

valentin LOGINOV

1. As members of the Cuerpo Consular, Terence D. SISTONE

and his wife were formally invited to Valentin LOGINOV's

despedida. The scheduled hours on the invitation were from

7:00 to 9:00. Actually,

they arrived at about 7:45 and loft

at about 9:15. SISTONE had two main purposes in attending the

reception: 1) to determine LOGINOV's replacement, and 2) to

meet the Cubans present, if any. On the first count SISTONE

was

successful. Öleg Maksimovich NECHIPORENKO was formally

introduced to the crowd as LOGINOV's replacement by

sir. KAZANiSEV,

the Sovlet Charge. On the

second count SISTONE was not

successful. The only Cuban present that he recognized from

mug photos was Rafael MIRABAL Fernandez, who quite obvlously

avoided any contact with SISTONE, rather furtively staying on

the other side of the room at all times. In all, SISTOVE

talked to some nine Soviet imbassy officials that he could

recognize from lhe

mug book and had somewhat extensive con-

versation with three, LOGINOV; KAZANTSEY, the Chargé; and

Eduard Anatolyevich SARATOV, TASS representatiro.

purposes SISTOrE, of courso, also had to spend muct of his

time with follow members of the Cuerpo Consular, mostly with

Leander YOURVOULIAS, the Cuorpo Consular president and ex-

-.

Greek Consul General, and Sia. liarta FOSSECA Guardia de

though not a member of, the Cuerpo Consular. It ts very

early to tell, of course, but a man like this could concelvably

become an access agent to either Soviet or Cuban offichals.

2. At the entranceway SISTONE met and recognized

col. Konstantin Nikandrovich BOGATYREV, the Soviet Military

Attache.

Both on this occasion and later in the evening

BOGATYREV seened to have a forced grin on his face. de

exchanged pleasantries but provided nothing of significance.

3., In the reception area inside, SISTONE greeted Yalentin

LOGINOV and his wife, who readily recalled SISTONE and wife

from the excursion to the Ford factory in July. LOGINOV also

recalled that SISTONE was Raymond A. FRADYER's replaceuent

and asked after the latter: Had he get arrived in Paris?

SISTONE sald that he understood that FRADYER probably had

arrived by now..

SISTONE asked LOGINOY when he was leaving

for the Soviet Undon.

LOGINOV answered that he was leaving

not be visiting puris to see his iriend FRADYER. LOGINOY all

surrounded by

a circle of very young and apparently unattached

sexican ladies - perhaps university students. Mrs. LOGINOV.

was quite transformed from the very drab woman of the Ford.

excursion. She

was quite dressed up, even attractive, and

did her best to be a charming hostess, although this was

obviously a forced chore for her. (Later in the evening she

busted herselt pointing out what she thought to be the choicest

items on the buffet table.) Valentin LOGINOV invited SISTONE

and his wife to visit him in Russia. SISTONE answered to the

effect that this would be wonderful someday if he or the

Russian Goveriment would pick up the tab. LOGINOV replied

that that was not necessary because all Americans are so rich

they can afford a trip anywhere. Later, talking to SARATOV

(see paragraph g below), SIStONE was told that LOGINOW would

be spending three days in New York City: Later in the evening

LOGINOV had his picture taken, probably by a press photographer, iy

with SISTONE's wife, and he was in general quite gallant with

her. In tho little speech following the buffet, LOGINOV thanked

Baying, "Thanks on my wito's behalf and

mine. You all have

been very attentive to my great cointry." About the only

times that LOGINOY secmed reflective and serfous during the

evening woro during this little speech and later in saying

good-by to SISTONE (accompanying this with an abrazo).

LOGINOV's last words to SISTONE were said with much real or

imagined leoling: "You Americans and we Russians have to be

real frlonds in these days of the world."

4. Negatively, SISTONE did not see LIREALN-1; SAO's

friend, Yurly VANOVSKY; or Chief,. SB's friend, Boris CHNYKHOV,

at the Soviet reception.

Since there were over 100 people

mIlling about, SISTONE, of course, could kave missed those

people.

5. Prior to the buffat, SISTONE net again beon (Spanish

version of Lev) N. GOLOUZOV, a member of the Soviet Comnercial

• Staff. SISTONE had met COLOUZOV on the Ford excursion as

well, and the two chatted brlefly about that trip. CoLouzOY

gave SISTONE his calling card. which is attached,

6. Standing beside COLOUZOV, and obvlously a very junior

officer undey the latter's wing, was Vladimir PETROV, also of

the soviet Commercial Office. Following the example of big

brother, PETROY also gave SISTONE his callies card, funich 1s

attached. PETROV jooked to be no more than in his late 20's.

He is almost baby faced, has sort of a pug nose,. is perhaps

S' 9' tall, is of medium to slim build, and has light hair.

PETROV said he had only been in Mexico two reeks and was

terribly confused by the vehicular traffic, which is much

noisier and extensive than that of Noscow. Although he

speaks Spanish quite well, he said

that-this is his first tour

in Latin America.

7.: Also early in the evening SISTONE net Vladislav

Sergeyevich KORNUSHKIY, Soviet Vice Consul. He is a fairly

tall, heavy built, athletic-looking young man with a very

strong handgrip on being introduced.. KORNUSHKIN was almost

the only Russian with whom SISTONE talked who did not ever try

to be friendly. He just stood around most of the evening,

listening and looking very ill at ease.

8. SISTONE only met Oleg Maksimovich NECHIPORENKO,

LOGINOV's replacement, very briefly and on an occasion when

LOGINOV was not around. Therefore, SISTONE was not formally

introduced by title or as FRADYER's replacement to VECHIPORENKO.

This man looks very Latin and could nix in a crowd on the

sane bet-

street without any difficulty. He stayed very much in the

he was introduced by the Chargé as LOGINOV's replacement, he

The Charge described him as a young man advancing rapidly in

the Soviet Foreign Service.' He also said he had

been a simple

Military Attache before but is now a Second Secretary and

is taking over as Consul. The Charge descrihed NECHI PORENKO

as a non-Great Russian. SISTONE missed his nationality, 1f 1t

was mentioned.. The Chargé hastened to add that NICHIPORENKO'S

wife, however, is Great Russian.

.9.

Possibly the longest conversation SISTOVE had with

any Russian was that with Eduard Anatolyevich SARATOV, the. TASS

representative. SISTONE was introduced to him by Findley

HOWARD, local Pan American representative:

SARATOV was

the

only one with whom SISTONE spoke in English. All other con-

versation with Russians and other non-Americans was in Spanish.

SARATOV is a very

smooth, gallant man-about-town.

He seemed

to really enjoy talking to Americans and other non-Russians at

the reception, and bowed and established rapport with the ladies

of all ages.

He said he has been in Mexico two years, is

married, and has one son

in the

fourth grade, who is naturally

attending the Embassy school and who will be sent next year

to the Soviet Union for his further education. He asked

SISTONE how many children he has and commented

on the answer,

five, by saying that in his business it is not practical to

have many children. SISTONE asked him how he gets his news to

send home. SARATOV replied that he is obliged to send home

daily a resune of the most important Vexican events, much of

which he obtains from the Nexican press. He. added, with a

smile, that he, of course, has to supplement such newspaper

accounts with information from his own contacts. SISTONE

asked if this meant, among other things, getting handouts from

Government offices. SARATOV dismissed such sources as

unimportant. He sald this dally resume which he sends home

the lone TASS representative here. He has his. own office

separate from the Embassy and prefers it that way. SARATOY

claimed to have traveled around Mexico quite a bit. He seemed

• to be impressed with the Yucatan and wanted to know if SISTONE

has visited there. The latter replied that he has not yet

visited the fucatan since being stationed here, but that, as

a tourist, he had seen the fuins there some years ago. SARATOV

said that he is fron Siberia, and in answer to à SISTONE

question said he thinks the Georgians are the warmest and

friendliest people of the Soviet Union. SARATOY obviously

likes to brag about having been stationed previously in

Washington. He also said he would very much like to have been

assigned to the new

TASS office being opened in San Francisco.

agreement between

the United States

and the U.S.S.R. the former will have

the TASS office in San Francisco is somchow connected with

the establishment of the Consulnte. In speaking of LOGISOV's

three days in New York, SARATOV sald he would recomnend

three things

for him to visit: a good steak house, a good

Chinese restaurant, and Rockefeller Conter Music Hall.

10. Somewhat after the despedida ceremony; SISTONE noted

the Charge, Boris Aleksandrovich KAZANTSEY, alone and intro-

duced himsell. From a distance KAZANTSEV looks extremely

young for his high position; closor up he looks a little older.

KAZANTSEV was extremely affable when he learned that SISTONE

was a new member of the Cuerpo Consular. He said he is a

member of an equivalent organization among the diplomats and

AN'EOSED

Iri that context knows Mr. Wallace STUART quite well. He said

He thinks the space program a wonderful adventure for both our

countries, and he mentioned the current negotiations between

the American Atomic Energy Commission and its Russian equivalent

In working out the rules for use of peaceful nuclear energy.

While affable, KAZANTSEV does not impart any feeling of

sincerity whatsoever. He seems transparently cynical, and

reminds one of a second-rate American politician. After the

above conversation and when SISTONE was talking to a Mexican

airport official, for some reason KAZANTSEV reapproached

SISTOSE and said to him and the doxican that he hoped

there

would be a rapprochement soon beticen the United States and

Cuba. SISTONE cannot figure out why kAZANTSEV made that

remark at that particular time unless l) he thought the

Mexican

airport official was. a Cuban, or 2) he had

been briefed by

LOGINOV

not only on the fact that SISTOVE is FRADYER's replace-

ment, but that FRADYER had somehow been connected with Cubar

operations.

11.

SISTONE only met Yurly CHERNYSH, Soviet Vice Consul,

very briefly to shake hands neor the end of the evening. He

was easily recognizablo from his very light gray hals.

12. SISTONE was only sure of one Cuban's being present,

Rafael MIRABAL. At one time, SISTONE thought he saw a gentle-

man who looked a little like Ambassador Joaquin HERNANDEZ Armas,

but at second glance he did not think so. There was no doubt

In SISTONE's mind that MIRABAL was avoiding him. On one

occasion, MIRABAl was quite close, within earshot, and may well

have beard SISTONE either talking English to a fellow American

or his wife, or discussing something American. Thereafter,

every time sistove tried to work his way toward lirabal, the

latter would shortly move further away. Tvice SISTOVE talked

to people that vaguely looked like they might be Cubans from

the mug book, only to discover in both cases that they were

Mexican.

13. One of the above Mexicans turned out to be Alfonso

SIBAJA C., who described himself as a nechanical engineer

and industrial consultant. His address is Ezequiel 82,

Mexico 14, D.F., and his telephone number 1s 17-88-85. This

man 1s the husband of a lady he described as fress and Cultural

to her somewhat: later and got the impression that she is not

ancestry; SIBAJA and SISTOVE exchanged calling cards (SIBAJA's

is attached). SIBAJA said that he and his wife attend such

functions as this reception quite frequently and definitely

recalled not having met SISTONE before. The latter explained

his recent arrival. SIBAJA claimed that he is a good singer

of folklore songs and that his wife knows how to dance them.

They have performed spontaneously quite often at diplomatic

and consular affairs. Asked whether he would be going on the

to Meiterri,

Cuerpo Consular excursion

scheduled for late October, SIBAJA

said

he would like to go. He is a working man, however, and

was not sure he could get away. SIBAJA and wife and SISTONE

and wife established rapport rather easily, and all agreed

they should meet again rather shortly. SIBAJA said that

he

is of partial. French ancestry. He looks as though he might

be Mideastern, however. He is proud that he is from JUAREZ'

home state of Jaraca. It would seem to SISTONE that this is

circulates in their social milieu. SISTONE intends to follow

up oa this man. de sala be lives in Colonia Lindavista, where Acad

SISTONE's wife's relatives are concentrated. He has a son

going to Colegio Tepejac in that area.

14. The only Americans SISTONE was aware of at the

reception were 1)

Chief of the Visa Section of

the Consulate, 2) Findley HOWARD, of Pan American, and 3) David

WIESLEY, American businessman and Honorary Consul of Iceland.

15. Considering the fact that SISTONE was only in the

Soviet Embassy a little over one hour and had to spend a good

part of his time talking to

VOURVOULIAS, and that real

pain-in-the-neck, Sra. JINENEZ, he considers his contact with

Soviets about the maximum that could be achieved under the

circumstances.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chlof SB

ITO

: Chef, CUBA

SUBJECT

3 Relationship Betveea MEDIEHARD and Gloria PINTO

1.

In response to 8 conversation betucen Chief, SB, and the under-

signed, LIREALM-I was questioned Idletail on 25 September concerning

the relationship uhich exits between AEDIZHARD and Glorla PINTO with a

view toward possible enbarrassment of ASDISHARD before his superiors.

--?.

LIREALM-1 ANd his wife both belleve (but have no proof) chat

it is

probable that Gloria PINTO is having or has had an affair with

ASDIEHARD.

Both LIREALM and his wife are close friends of the PINIO's

sind know that Glorla 18 strongly attracted to AEDIEHARD wie ls Doch

physically and Intellectually superlos to her busband. Due to Gloria's

continued friendship with AEDIEHARD at the French Club and ochei places,

LIREIM-I feels sure chat Glorta's husbarid, Pepe, does not yet know of

the affair.

3.

LIREALM-l characterized Pepe PINTO as: sweet, slow witted and

below average in intelligence..

He l's a physiclan specializing in lung dis-

orders, born in the Canary Islands. He considers hinself a Spanlard with

the Characterlatic gpanish lack of respect for women.

He attempts to.

cigutiy control Glorla's activities while, according to Glorla, having

as many affalos himself as he cao.

Gloria ¿seatly resents Pepo's attitude

coward her.

Pepe 1s basically defensive and would not want anyone to know

1f Glorla were having an affair with another mn. He vould probably deny

It af anyone said so, even 1f he vere avare of 1t.

He souid take it out on

Gloria, however, and would probably beat her and restrict her novements even

more closely.

In view of che above, it would certainly appear chat chere vould ba

nothing to galn, and perhaps such to loose, by any artespt at exposing ber

supposed affair wich AbDIsHArD.

Subject: ABDIBHARD (P-11,712) & ThoughtsRo poealbility of Pitching Hla

1.

Asauming

it was agreed

that A should be pitched before his POS

departure, because there are no indicationa that he rould be more miscept-

ible taker to an approach inter then he comes to a new poat abroad in lew

yeare and, to the contrary; It Is more likely that he would be still more

daring, more salfconfident and more deteruined to advanoe aná solidity

11e position within the KGB, I wish to add some viewe of mine to the llet

of posalbilltlos an to bow a pitch could be carried out.

2.

My vlaws and thoughtn on this subject mill be based on the posdiblo

use of existing asseta and means. I am fully aware that there m1ll be

plenty of room for improvemente, additions and modifications of what will

be said in the following paras.

3.

As far as I know we are lacking adequately solid facts in which

we could put our teeth, 1.e. we do not radonat posses worthwhile mention-

I am Inclined to belleve that we are in a position to make a

serious attempt to obtain a "pressure argument" through the use of existing

assete mhich are targeted againat A and that it can be done without taking

an undue risk.

of a busineds suocosa and he was given a subetantial

advance on bis commission: After A and SARORI have

their routine two drinks, SARORI will state to A that

he would plok up the tab for the evening ( after being

treated by A so many times ) but he would want to

calebrate the ocoacion. It would be desirable that A

agrees on e drink or two to pleaseS, but even if that

does not take plabe, it 1e anticipated that A mould

A; because that rill strangthen S' position in the deal.

I mentioned the platinum deal because it mould give

some common ground to the new person being introduced

on the soene, but some other story might be as good.

The new person showing up under the platinum deal

or any other pretext mould be a case officer of ours.

I feel that such a pereon should at firet sight show

that he was a Yankee,. that he be verged in platinum

or what ever the pretext may be and that he should be

a Russian language speaker. I am Inclined to believe

that after some business. talk and after creating an

atropher of mitual understanding there would be no

problem for the case officer to start speaking Russian.

II A takes this fact in good mood and the business

conversation continues in Russian, s would be in a

position to excuse hinself as a person who was no longer

needed. It is almost impossible to anticipate what.

would be As reaction to the fact that s wanted to leave.

If insisted, that s stay, me will have to accept 1t.

Nevertheless, S will be inatructed to "go to the bathraon'

opportunity to drop his cover and go on with his job.

It is the fate of any offloer moking the pitch to lie

to get a suitable laguage speaker case officer fron

I am aware of the fact that beat the above discussed scheme has

a quite certain weakness in as much as it is built on and arouid an untested

asset as S 18. Neverthelesa, in terms of security and protection uf Agency/

7.

It should be assumed that s might come up with some objections

when it comes to introducing another person to A from fear that he would

not consider it difficult to put hin at ease.

SCENARIO OF CONTACT

I arrived about 0900 and took an instructor.

About 0950 Olegk arrived to play with and 1n-

structor on the adjoining court. He made no effort to

greet me. He had been pointed out to me by val, but

I had not been pointed out to him do my knowledge.

though 1t is certain that Oleg and Jual must have

discussed the "players" in thoir"game" and counted

me as possibly on

the other team. That ta, I an sure.

that val has pointed me out to oleg, but olog would

not have wanted to achnowledge this.

'At 1000 my hour was up and I told my instructor

was through-I did not want to continue for another

hour. As I was paying my instructor I noticed that

Oleg was paying his. It is very unusual and possiblg

even had form to take an Instructor for less than

half-an-hour. I am suggesting that he wanted to be

free to contrive an accidental meeting with me.

I set a course for one of the several gates

from the courts we were using. I could see

that 01eg

had headed for the same gate (this could have been

perfectly natural) and at a speed which after some

thtity yards would bring him to the gate at the same

moment as I (this was not entirely natural).

since I had an excuse to greet him, having had

pointed out in front of Pepe Pinto

the preceding

weeks, I did so. I tikan sald Good Morning and asked

Incident where AEDIEHARD

approached LIREALM-l with an offer to pay LIREAHM-I

for any information he could obtain from the U.S. Embassy, has avoided

contact with AEDIEHARD at the French Club, LIREALM-l's wife, an almost

dally vialtor to the Club, has been asked by LIREALM-1 co nose AEDIEHARD'g

activities and assoclaces and report anything. interesting to LIREALM-I.

DIet 19p

b.

MIs. LIREALM recently told LIREALM-l that for a number of

consecutive Saturdays, AEDIEHARD had brought a young lady, whom MRa LIRALM

thinks to be German, to che Club as his guest.

Mrs. LIREALM did not attempt

to determine the Identity

of the fepale, but reported the information to

her husband.

She has noted no other items of interest in AEDIEHARD'O

pattern of activities at the clus.

He has not seemed to single out any

Individual as a tennis partner, nor la he frequently seen socializing with

anyone in particular while at the club.

2.

LIREALM-I was advised that the Station had learned that MEDIEHARD

will not return to MHHARSH Immediately as originally thought, but he will

probably remain in Mexico for another five wonchs. LIREALM-I was told that

this Information was not yet public krowledge, but the Station would like

IIREALM-1 to confira this if possible. This led to a general discussion of

LIREALM-I's assoclation with AEDIEHARD since the recent incident. LIREALM-1

was instructed that lt was not the Station's wish that he avold contact wich

AEDIEHARD, but rather chat he not single out AEDIÉHARD for special attention

or closely court his friendship.

It 19 ake writer's opinion that a cufficleat

time has

elapsed alace the last incident for LIREALM-l to again renew some

association wich AEDIEHARD, and a particularly opportune caance to do 8o 18

avallable:

LIREALM-1 and AEDIEHARD both belong (as has previoussy been reported)

to a group

of teanis enthuslasts at the Club who take turns entertaining each

other in their homes.

To dnte, all the members of this group hame given partles

except LIREALY-).

home since

he represents a government ao opposed to the principles of her govera.

vient, etc.

Based on ¡InIMAlD's extension in Mexico and the face that che LIREALM's

Erlands a party, LIREALM was Instructed to plan a party for the group

and to Include AEDIEHARD

and his wife in the group invited.

At che party,

LIRLALM-l should not focug

an undue amount of attention da MEDIENAPD, but

should

take advantage of the opporcunity to soney chelr general friendahl, and let che

During the langunge class on l'on Sert 1 IlyACO! told I-l that

lted to come to TIRACli-l's house for dinner on Sept I5 about 1900 - 1930

¡hours. IIRACOl'-1 raded that Yuriy CIPIU YSI! (I-13,042) Ould nos also

attend the dinner.

T.IPACO1-1 told I-l thet he vantea to invitento the sare ainner

I-I with wife, irs. Fa and odil, but his siie rofused to have more

rests than the two sov courles, because they did not have suffient

sace and could not afford to siend the anount noncy the additional

nuber of quests would cost. He went on to state

that even this wey

he wes in a quite embarrassing situation vecruse he would not have

moncy to buy nore than a botile of Castillo rum.

4..

Int thorked II3200!-1 for thirking of hin ard added that no vould

not have been able to conc for dirner that evening because he had to

five a class which he was not able to concol. IIRACOI-1 felt releaved,

but he errearod to be very rervous. I-l added, es xxxed an afterthought

that he would bring to IIsACOi-i a bottle of vishy, because his friend

Octavio fron latanoros was scheduled to core to town before Sert 15

and he usully brings him a courle of bottles of wiskey; if not sooner

J.-1 sas certain that Coterio could call on hin Sort 14 or 15 the

Intest end in that case In could hend the kottle to IIsACOi-1 on the

crening of the rarty at 2100-2130 hrs. IINACCI-l felt that this

would be treat and that I-l could remin with his guests for a drink.

5.

I-1 contented that the above mentionca develorents mece it

unnccossary for him to so throug: the cinnic of coking to ngue his clrssee

ITMCOr-1, felt inbarrassed for not being able to invite him to the

dirner. I-l cormented that IBACO! -1 had no ronson to tell hin any-

thing cout the dinner and if he kept it to hinself thero would had

been no rencon for emuarrassment. We agreed that there was no roacon

to sicculate, but to wit and sec. I-l stated that his hores went high

Requirement:. In view of the fret that IIENCO:-1 1s used to

Reference: ESBW-13096, 14 Novenber 1972

As requested in Reference, Station queried INBREED as to

why they had inciuded Valentin Sergeyevich LOGINOV (201-0285112)

In their list of Soviets who had been PNG'd or expelled from

2.

In INBREED's reply to our query, they stated that in the

periodic "Das Beste" there was an extract from the Reador's Digest

of 1 January 1972, of a bookotitled "Moscow's Attack on Mexico" by

John Barron.

Fron this article it was learned that the KGB cfficer

LOGINOV met secretly with Mexican students it the time of the

student demonstrations in Mexico in 1968;

In March 1971,

when

five Soviet offtrials were PNG'd from Mexico, it was belleved that

Valentin Sergeyevich LOGINOY was among those

ousted.

3.

Upon learning that LOGINOV served in the Soviet Embassy

in Mexico City as Third Secretary/Vice Counsel fron August 1965

to October 1969, INBREED has now advised the Station that LOGINOV's

name sa erroneously appeared in their list of soviets who had

been PNG'd.

that he usually left his seet about 2300 hours and went out to the lobby

for some time. She did not know where the contects were actually made.

Once she and LOGIOV encountered, apparently accidentally, outside the

Cine Mod theater, a Mexican Army Colonel, who was introduced to her by

LOGINOV as "Col, Sergio." In this instance LOGINOV did not excuse hinself

to have a private conversation with the Mexican. "Col. Sergio" was de-

scribed by AEMIDIT as about 40, tall, no moustache or glasses, thick,

curly hair, appeared to be of Sranish descent. The wozan with "Col.

Sergio" appeared to be about 25 years old and was introduced as his wife

(which ABIDRIFF doubted because, es she put it, he didn't treat her as.

one would a wife, but rather as

they had in the police here.

Sin said she had also overheard FoIckyAroV,

BRULIN, AND CHAKHOY tel about hor tany good police contacts the Soviets

of any of the lexicans she net on these occasions, and of course there is

no ray of knowing whether such private conversations were oforational

«cetings.) AEIDRIFF connented that at purely Soviet parties, husbands al1

stopped their conversation.

Parlod Covered: January 30 to August 11, 1969

1. LIBACON-I was recrulted by Saruel J. KARTASUK on January

30 and.

was handled by him until March 26.

During this period

they held nine ops meetings.

2.

Bruce H. FERNALD took over LIBACON-L on March 26 and

handled hen to sugust 14,

During this period 16 ops mootiny. were held.

of craverting LIBACON-l's agreement tu were fus

KARTASUK personally into a regular working arrangement.

Of the nine meetings KARTASUK held with LIBnCoN-1,

actually only six wero working meetings.

Info was obtained on

LIBACON-l's personal background as well

as his ops potential.

LIBACON-1 was SÜSWIRLED with jatisfactory results..

Further,

LIBACON-1

was motivated to work for us and he was

mentally prepared

to accept another handler..:

During this period the condition which

LIBACON-1 had placed on his agreement to work for us was suspecind

(1.e.,

that he would not be asked to report on his personal friands

sich a3 Sydilards, his students, or Mexicans. to whom he vs

620*: lonally ittached).

LIBACON-I did complete for KANTAsiK a

15-1100 pritien report on AEDIEHARD.

FERNALD

encountered no problems in getting along with ad

handling LiBiCON-l, whom he got accustoned to following instructions

and to sibmitting reports in writing.

G.

LIBACON-l's Initial attitudo was that he had greed ic work,

or more accurately..

to.asgist

Us

in our work against ASKICK, but ne

was doteruined to keep hinsell away fiom evorybody and overything

FERNALD succeered in convincing LIBACON-l that he sbould

maintain sociul or friendly personal contact with ADILURD and his

dolleaguos and that he could do it without either giving in to bis

or their demands, or at the other oxtreme, without sajing no to

everything they

vention oi ask for.

LIBACON-1 followed instructions

and went to AFDIElARy's

why he had not. called

him for ten peris.

The result was that LIBiCOlal had two luncheon

meetings with ALDIERARD

in July, and on August 8 LIBACON-l and his

wife were dinner guests of ALDIEHARD and his wife at their apartment.

The AÈDIElARDS agreed to come to LIBACON-l's place for & Iniewall

dinner in September and in the meanwhile LIBACON-1 and AEDIEHARD

he ascribes it to the fact that he grew

there are restricted to the area which does not affect his rellability,

THAT REGARDLESS WHETHER THEY DID INVESTIGATE HIM OR NOT,

THEY WOULD PLACE HIM ON SOME SORT OF "SUSPICIOUS LIST" AND

TilIS COULD HANDICAP HIS BUSINESS INTERESTS AND SOCIAL

RELATIONSHIPS WITH VARIOUS EMBASSY COUPLES WITH WHOM HE AND

HIS NIFE NERE FRIENDLY.

(3) HE SAW NO REASON WHY HE COULD NUI CONTINUE TO SEE

AEDIEHARD SOCIALLY AS BEFORE BUT THAT HE KNEW THAT IF HE

REPORTED TO EMBASSY HE WOULD PROBABLY BE ASKED TO CEASE

• THIS CONTACT IN HIS BEST INTERESTS AND THOSE OF THE EMBASSY.

• SPY ACCUSATION BUSINESS OR I WILL HAVE NO RECOURSE BUT TO

PROTECT MYSELF AND REPORT TO THE ENBASSY. "

5. THIS ACTION ON THE PART OF LIREALM IS IN PERFECT HARMONY

WITH ACHIEVING OBJECTIVE NUMBER ONE: PROTECTING AND MAINTAINING

LIREALM'S COVER. HOPEFULLY IT WOULD SET STAGE FOR CONTINUING

CONTACT WITH AEDIEHARD ON PROFITABLE BASIS SO THAT WE CAN PROFES-

SIONALLY ASSESS THIS SOVIET WHICH FULFILLS THE SECOND OBJECTIVE.

WE EVALUATE LIREALM'S REPORTING ON HIS SOVIET CONTACTS AS ACCURATE,

LUCID, AND USEFUL. THE RECENT BAC

ON AEDIEHARD COMPLETED BY

LIREALM IS POSITIVE STEP IN RIGHT DIRECTION. HOWEVER, SHOULD

AEDIEHARD PERSIST WITH HIS GAMES PLAYING WE HAVE NOT CLOSEN DOOR

ON LIREALM GOING TO THE EMBASSY AND CARRYING OUT ACTION DESCRIBED

IN STATION MESSAGES. THUS THIS OPTION STILL VALID.

6. APART FROM SEEKING TO OBTAIN ABOVE OBJECTIVES BY TAKING

THE INITIATIVE NE ALSO AVOID A LIREALM WITHDRANAL FROM AEDIEHARD

HICH, NO MATTER HOW WELL PLANNED, SOVETS WOULD PROBABLY SUSPECT

AS SOME FORY OF DEFENSIVE ACTION ON LIREALM'S PART IN VIEN OF NIS
