22 July 1969

1, The undersigned attended the celebration of the

Polish national day at the Polish Residence on Insurgentes
Sur on 22 July 1969. The following points were the most
significant:

a. The only Soviet the undersigned could
identify was Col. Konstantin Nikandrovich BOGATYREV,.
the. Soviet Military Attache. Someone the under-
Bigned's wife talked to mentioned the presence of
the Soviet Consul, but this certainly Was neither

‘Valentin LOGINOV nor Yuriy CHERNYSH, and the

undersigned cid not met that person.

b. Whether the Cubans were invited or not,
they were not. in. attendance.

¢. Jiri SVESTKA, of the Czech Bubassy, was
there. Per SB Section briefing, the undersigned
mentioned hia departure and told SVESTKA.that at
least he would remain in Mexico. SVESTKA said that
this would not be the case, that he. is scheduled
to leave within 15 days for Czechostovakia. The
undersigned then mentioned a conversation with his
Czech friend in which the latter told him that he
expected to stay in Mexico for quite a while longer.
SVESTKA denied eyer having said this, pointing
out that he was glad to return home. The under=

signed made no further comments.

K

d. The ex-Haitian Ambassador, Julio Jean
PIERRE-AUDAIN, was geen by the undersigned but
left before he could talk to him. In view of the
nay foct that PIERRE-AUDAIN ceased to be Ambassador
# ~ of Haiti a long timo ago,.the undersigned feels
that.:his presence at the Polish national day ~
cele ng: has some Significance. He remembers

‘ In
other Words, the Communists have made it a point
Shaskabial ~ to maintain contact with him, probably in view of
the fact that PIERRE-AUDAIN may return to Haiti if
something happens to DUVALIER and may secure a
position of some importance in his country. B

2. The President of the Consular Association, VOURVOULIAS, 4

told the undersigned that: he would contact LOGINOV at the \

su Soviet Enbassy to see. whether ‘the latter would agree to a 1
“© foint’celebration of both the. undersigned's and LOGINOV's

Remarks: i
1. Concerning the preblezs.waich Log tas With hie colleagues

LIBACON-1 waa not able to offer specific. exasples. In at, least 3
tnatanees-Z06 spoke to IL-l teat ‘the psychological atnospher within

the Sov Sribaesy ie horribte a aepréeseing. stated thet there. wae.
not a-eingle pergon in the EAbassy ia whieh one cen confides everyboay
is ready +o. cut otherones throat just to advac if there te nothing
the colleagues can pin ageinst a person they. start intriguing ‘hoping
that one might loce his tenper and coamit something stupid which
would be sufficient to hera the person involved: if ones aske for
edvise te would in no time find out thet he was considered incompetent.

"Ya Feld 1968 Lek invited Lec to Attend a party and told hin

_ that Yuriy CHBRNISH (P-13,042) would be there. LOG ‘stated that te

would not come, because it would mean or getting himself ia troutie
or getting CHERNISE in. trouble; ‘to keep avay from Sov cdlieqenes is
the only of keeping ¢ out of troubles, concluded LCs.

2. Vith regard to the statenent that LCG was commiting errore

by exterting pressure on other people L-1 etated that he reported

LOG’ renewed attempt to reeruit Nigvel Angel: In doing so L0G abandéned,
hie tact and ignored the sensitivity of. the other person; LOG tél

to. L-i. in Cuautie tock place in less ‘than a moath from, LOGs piten to:
Miguel Angel: the way ZCG spoke to I-l nade it evideat that LG die-
regarded ops security rules. Sich things did rot heppéen before end

Lel concluded that 237 reat etl out to & v2 Soe success vafere:

he leaves TIS. "cont what it may". : :

spoke to Subject in e heavy accented broken Eng. slick
and vas delighted “hen Subject curpested that they
speak Spanish, LOGLOVS general line of conv was that
the essential thing in the life is understending and
to be able to understand others one aust get to know
them; this in turn calls for having as many friends
es possible. The sane applies to countries and nations.
Before leaving the party LOGINOV stated that he. would
like to teconée friendly with Cuoject and asked hia
vould he be willing to meet with him. Subject agreed
and they met next Fridey at the Tecali. Restauzant.

The conv at the Tecald wee to an extent dealing with
the theme of friendship and understanding with an
added emphasis that if there was understanding and,
consequently, friendship between the U.S. and Soviet
Union ve vould be living in a. much better world.
Subject ctated his agreement with LOGs views. In a’
further part. of the conv LOGIHOV was interested in
knowing whether Subject had many friends in Nexico"
Subject clains to have. stated that he had many good
friends here, (NOT%: It is quite likely that he
bragged about the nurber of inflnential friedds he had
here). At the end LOGINCY told Subject that he would
like tc cee Kin again and Subject asked hin to come
to hie house. According to Subject, LCCINOV. asked
would not the fact of réceiving a Sov official con-
promise Subject or lead him into Some kind of troubles.
Subject assured hie that the receiving of a Sov or

any foreinn official could net affect him in no way.
Then, LCGINCY asked Subject would they be alone and
Eubject ensvered affirnetively. (Xcte: this point
Subject indiceted that te'received LOTINOY at the
apt et the Jeibuite 297), Finally, Locivov ecreed to

are now solved {as I surnised they wuld), Essentially, he has

paying off - Subject ts dettss They will construct a big new.
factory complex. in Cuernavaca to bring all of ‘Subject 's :
manufacturing enterprises under one roof and double capacity.”
They're also going, to open up offices and a showroom on Insur=
gentes Sur. Subject figures. ke will probably stey active for
a couple of years’ more and then sell his eae 50% for

about: a half million dollars.
3, I told Subject again “ that I am now anxious. for hin

to establish a-social relationship with SPYRA (P-6601) and.

that: Iam no longer. interested in his developing BAJCHCHRZaK

per se, I suggested that he might use vad. sinply as an entree

retainer for three months (Jan., Feb. and March) and agreed to
have the balance o£-$3000 for him on Tuesday. He gave me @
pile of hotel bills and other expenses which will be charged
against. the $3000 revolving fund he has outstanding. He asked
me 1f I could get him a case of champagne, a couple of bottles..
of cognac, a bottle of gin. I told him that I'd see if these

are available and that, if they are, I would charge them against

either his salary or fund rather than. as-outright gifts as in

Meche!and San Luis Fotosie I asked Gloria if
she were qoing to San Duis Potosi this year for the
Holy Week tennis tournaments. She said that she had
planned to do so but was unable to find some one to
go with her at the last moment. Pepa did not want to”
go, and would not let her go by herself unless accom
panied by several dther women or by Meche. Meche re~

she was annoyed #ith Pepe. She deplores his Jatin

cities in Nexico to see friends and family, She is
not welcome to accompany Pébe on his trips. Yet he

will s6on take another month off to travel either

has been waiting all these years for her children to

Now that hey are.grown up, she finds that she still

Gloria has chosen to ignore it. E

the attitude of suneriority over women that Latin men
have, but on behalf of her daughter, not herself. Gdoria

t raised. the matter of Val. I reminded her. that I had
explained to. her some time ago that I was annoyed with’
Val's tredtment of mé in public, nemely his flagrant
attempts to recruit me in the presence of mutual friends.
I told her tha t I still hadn't had a chance to talk to.

make it clear: to him-that I held him in great esteem as
a person, valued his friendshin,.was not interested in
assisting ‘his government, and wanted him to stop jeo-

whether subtle. and implied or direct, and coarse..

Not aware of accident to Dmitri. I told Gloria
that Val had excused himself from our lunch date due -

to an accident to his son. She did not know of any
accident other than the dog bite the previous week.

Gloria said that his declining my invitation
might have been an afterthought. That he did not want
to hurt my hy being seen with me in a public pla



Avoids "hurting" his friends. Gloria then told me
that Jal never accented an invitation to have coffee with
her or rene or to dine out. He explained to her that it
could hurt her to ba seen with him, She gave an exam le
of when she was “invited to the ballet with val and a-~~

group of triends.

After the ballet, Peve and Gloria invited val to
join them for dinner. val declined. Pepe and Glorda.

Peete val is in the embassy only in the morning. This was
in response to my Statement that I had tried to call
the embassy and talk to Val to find out what had hap~
pened to Dmitri, but since he was out, I would’call

in the afternoon, but outside the embassy. I said “try-

Neue _It seems to me highly unlikely that val is 7

seen with him. It seems quite clear that he con-
siders Gloria and Pepe, and perhaps me, as potential >
assets. He does not.want to be seen with us because ;
we would lose our value to him. He told Gloria that
they should confine their contacts to the French
Club. This seems td confirm the suspicion that. he
believes that thts-is a secure’ place to feet people.

It is possible that he checked with his colleagues | ©
and they were of the opinion that.my choice of the
Liave de Oro for lunch was too public, exposed. us 5.
to too many Americans. . : :

I feel that Gloria has served a very useful
purpose in this matter. If she is working for Val,
which I doubt, she is in a position. to seo that my
pusiness is indeed legitimate, ‘time-consuming, and
with considerable financial potential. “Further,
she is in a position to relay to val my unwillingness
to coopevate with him and his governemtn and my threat
to take the matter to the embassy if his harrassment
continues. ,

and vas. unable to participate in this meeting. The LIROBLINS ‘S daughter,
Lisa, was present in the ho¥se during the neeting which prompted REIDSNANN
to inquire of L/1 if the daughter was S2XEX aware of the type of res
lationship which’ the LIROBSINS had with RSIDSMANN. 1/1 replied that

"they" had told théir daushter inasmuch as she had come to suspect such
a relationship over the past. year or so. RSIDSMANN felt that it would be
oz little purpose,at this tine, to admonish the LIROBEINS and.-dropped the “
subject. REIDENANE has found the LIXOBBIXS to be woefully lacking in : cal
general security principles and has strived,in a tactful manner, to point
out past shortcomings and possible security hazards = especially with
regard to telephone conversations. ~ .
2 In response to REIDEMANN's question regarding attendance at the E
vi Novenber reception, L/1 Pied that they had both attended. L/1 cone
“nented that there apses: rea tower people this year than last.. As a matter

13 November 1968 -

MEMORANDUM FOR: DC/IC/SB

VIA : Chief of Station
c/ic soa
SUBJECT : @onsular Corps. Visit to Veracruz 2
1. The undersigned visited Veracruz on 9 and 10 Novenber .

together with other members of the Consular Corps on an
official visit to that city. ‘Although the Cubans were ;
scheduled to attend and official diplomas proclaiming them \° -
guests of the City of Veracruz were prepared, none of them :
Showed up, including Lino SALAZAR Chia, who is stationed in f
Veracruz. The Czechs, East Germans, and Poles for a number

of reasons also failed to go on this trip. Thus, the only
Communist representative was Valentin Sergéyevich LOGINOV, ‘. ~
With whom the undersigned had plenty of opportunity to talk.

It seems that LOGINOV, at least for public consumption,
considers the undersigned "his friend." LOGINOV was’ accompa--

nied by his wife,

2, The following were the main points of interest 7
discussed. by LOGINOV: : 7 t

a. The Soviet appeared very anxious to get
the undersigned's opinion on a subject to which he :
kept going back time and again during the visit:
the position of the. Richard N. NIXON administration
vis-a-vis Communist China, Specifically, what

that the NIXON administration might attempt to bring
about a rapprochement between Communist China and
the United States. LOGINOV approached this topic a
from various directions, and the undersigned had . ts
the distinct impression that he had received a

specific query on this subject. At one point,

LOGINOV stressed the importance of Communist China

to his country, “indicating that his. government is
becoming increasingly concerned with developments

there. : 2 ‘

Pot



SECRET

-2-

b. Connected with the above was LOGINOV’s
concern for peace in Victnam.. For the first time
that the undersigned can remeber, a Soviet stated
‘that the United States and his country had "a
common interest of utmost importance” in bringing
peace to Vietnam, That the Soviet interest may
ibe connected with their concern about Communist
“China was indicated by LOGINOV when the latter
indicated that peace. should be obtained in Vietnarc
as a way to keep out the Chinese Communists.
This did not prevent LOGINOV from making the usual
noises in favor of the National Liberation Front
and the Vietcong, blasting away at South Vietnamese
militarism.

¢. While talking about the Middle East,
LOGINOV said that the Soviet Union was in the
Mediterranean to stay and fully intended .to give
such support to the Arab nations in that area as
to someday "get rid of Israel." LOGINOV specifically
Stated, "The Jews have it coming to them, and the
day of reckoning is coming." The undersigned was
curious to -know whether this was prompted on
LOGINOV'S part by. a-dislike of the Israclis or an
anti-Semitic feeling. LOGINOV was quite blunt and
categorically stated that he for one “hated all
Jews," and ‘did not hide-his profound anti-Semitism.
LOGINOV ‘added that Jews are parasites who have
little natfonalism other than that generated by the
Zionist cause, “lNe implied that those Jews left in
the Soviet Union are foreigners who.have done little
- to help thé Soviet cause. The undersigned pointed .
out that anti-Semitism has been a long Russian
tradition, dating back to before the Revolution,

. + and deplored this obvious discrimination. He added
that this reminded him of the anti-Semitism of the
party which not so.long ago made mass murder of
Jews a matter of national policy. — :

qd. It took LOGINOV about one day to bring. up
the Sucesos ‘para Todos article. The undersigned
jokingly asked him whether this was a Soviet or
Cuban sponsored joke, saying that rumor had it that
Sucesos was financed by both the Soviets and the

SECRET

.Cubans. LOGINOV denied this, saying that the staff

of Succsos could not be put by any stretch of the
imagination into the category of "Communists." He.
then point-blank asked the undersigned whether he
belonged to the organization mentioned in the
article. The undersigned laughingly answered that
if ‘such trashy publications as Sticesos were believed
by anyone "of course he belonged to that organization.
LOGINOV laughed and made a few more noises about how
Sucesos obtained the undersigned's name. The latter
replied that his name was probably selected at
random from stolen pages of the mbassy directory
or other such document. ‘He added that if LOGINOV
had wanted his phone number he would have been glad
to have given it to him rather than see it appear
in Sucesos.

e. The discussion the undersigned had with
LOGINOV in Guadalajara about the KGB was apparently
not forgotten by the Soviet, for the latter pulled
out of his purse a copy of the stamp commemorating
some KGB anniversary that the undersigned had
mentioned to him. The undersigned has no idea of
the reasons for this gesture. One of the topics
which seems to embarrass LOGINOV the most is the
number of visas he signs at the Soviet Embassy.
Whenever LOGINOV gets a little too pointed in his
provocations, the undersigned raises this subject,
with LOGINOV invariably giving a little laugh and
no. answer.

_£. LOGINOV indicated that he was. aware tha’
the undersigned had met with Jiri SVESTKA at the |
time of the Soviet intervention, in-Czechoslovakia |
and asked for his opinion of SVESTKA. The undersigned
made no bones about the fact that he had a long lunch
with thé Czech. He said he had found him to be “muy
de la izquierda," adding that unfortunately SVESTKA |
belonged to the very small minority of his country
which had wolcomed Soviet intervention. The under~°
signed predicted that the Soviets would have con=
siderable trouble with Czechoslovakia and pointed
out that this serious error had tarnished the cause!

of the Soviet Union. He said, for example, that

the Soviet interventi-a was very unpopular in Mexico,
This seemed to draw a little blood from LOGINOV, as
he abruptly interrupted the undersigned and asked,
“Whereis it popular?" : :

Trere was 20 doubt. froma LOGINOV's statexents to the
undersigne that the Soviet had made at least some mental
in before he went on the trip shout subjects he should
raise with the undersigned. Vietnam, of course, was profusely a"
discussed, but LOGINOY also wanted to know about the state of :
the ciection campuigns in the United States and dbout the
March ofthe Poor on Washington. One afternoon that LOGINOV
was with CI YSH, the undersigned told him that he could not
sine how the Soviets could. favor the candidacy of Bobby
DY, an aristocrat and millionnaire who had nover worked
n fis bands and was liberally spending the family fortune
to infiuence people's minds, when * i HREY,* for ple,
was far more to the left in the & an political spectrum
and obviously had the support of the labor unions. No matter
What the undersigned said, the Soviets found something good
to say about KENNEDY, who appears to be the candidate the
Soviet Union would most like to sce as the next President.
The two Sovii laughingly remarked that the undersigned's
apparent disl tor KENNEDY might one day cost him his job.
The undersigned ad that fort tely the American Government
was not at. the mercy of the prevailing winds as were the c Fi
- governments of "other countries."" he manner in which LOGINOV a
+ Went about collecting his “information” was interesting and iH
auusing. For example, on‘ the way to Guadalajara, waen the
undersig.ied and LOGINOV were alone in the corridoy of. their
- coach, LOGINOV mentioned the armistice negotiations in Vietnam.
The ersigned, ashe has done many times in the past,
emphasized that this oyportunity to find an adequate peace should
not be. thrown away, as a backdown in negotiations might increase
the tempo of the war to tae point where = much larger conflict.
could sesuit. LOGINOV agreed that no one, including his’
country, wanted such a conflict and indeed a maximum effort
sneuld be made to find peace in Vietnam.’ The undersigned
iterated that muca ceponded on the Soviets, as the latter
bvdsusly had some influence over the orth Vietnamese Govern-
ment. He then said that peace was possible providing that

Russians to liberate Prague, the armistice would not have, ¥ ice

Like this, which did not take. into consideration the fact °
that. such anti-Communists ds Jan MASARYK and Eduard BENES

were the fathers of the Czech state. SVESTXA then went on to
say,that indeed neither NASARYK nor BENES had beea Comaunist,
but that neither had any deep knowledge of the inborn desires
ef the Czech people. ‘The undersigned told him that this

was enough to make both MASARYX and BENES turn over in their
graves. He pointed out that there nad been a violent exchange,
according to the Mexican press, between the Czech and Soviet .
papers over MASARYK, with the Russi saying that MASARYK

had participated in an attempt to kill Nikolai LENIN, .CHERNYSH
said that this was-a pack of lies, that he had reviewed the
Soviet press for that period and found nothing about MASARYK.
This was quickly endorsed by. SVESTKA. When the undersigned
once more stated his belief that people who had known better
would take the first opportunity to overthrow Communism, both
CHERNYSH and SVESTKA started speaking at the same time. The
undersigned pointed out that the Russian people had never
anything other than a curd on personal freedom and very
ong central government, but the. Czecis, the Poles, the a
Hangarians, and. others had known diffezeatiy. Such people
were thirsty for personal freedcus and direct control over
tneir destiny, When CHERNYSH said he doubted this, the uuder—
signed reminded him that it was Russian tanks that had crushed
the students and workers' revolt in iungary in 1956. He also
pointed to the recent guiet but radical revolution which had
taken place in Czechoslovakia, saying that, for example, vhe
day after the right to strike'had been re-established practi-,
cally all workers-struck to protest 20 years of mismanagement,
poor housi: and lack of freedom, Fron that point on SVESTKA

numbered at least 150 people. The only other Americans
present were Mr. Wallace W. STUART, head of the Political
Section, and Mr. David N. WIESLEY, Honorary Consul of Iceland.
“The undersigned was a little bit surprised to see Rodolphe
BABOUN, the new Haitian Acting Ambassador, in attendance with
@ colored Haitian. BABOUN, as a matter of fact, spoke briefly
to the Cuban Ambassador, Joaquin HERNANDEZ Armas.

diri. SVESTKA, Czech Consul and known intelligence officer.
.When he casually reniinded SVESTKA that Czechoslovakia was an
industrial power before World War I-and that Czech products
flooded Western Europe, SVESTKA sharply commented that his
country was qtitt an industrial power. When the undersigned
mentioned that MASARYK Was very popular in the United States,
SVESTKA countexed that that was no doubt because he had lived
as an exile in the United States. . SVESTKA cut short a remark
by the undersigned about the.effort currently being made to
throw light on MASARYK's death by saying, "There is no doubt
that he committed silicide." SVESTKA showed himself on this
ecedsion a rival of LOGINOY as far as provocations are
: coacerned.. After the undersigned answered comments on. the
Negro problem and forthcoming urban ‘terrorism and guerrilla
arfare in the United States, SVESTKA mentioned the “overt
letter" to ‘the American Ambassador which appeared in various
- local newspapers. He hinted that the incident “described” EE

PIR



“that the min’ who had written the article was a f

in tho opon letter was not only a blunder on the: part of
Ambassador FREEMAN, but also indicative of the superiority
complex of ‘the United States. At once point, when Valentin
LOGINOV chad joined in the discussion, the undersigned retorted
‘th-class.
writer without a diméwho somehow had found the thousands. of: 4
Pesos necessary to placé his editorial. When the Czech and
the Russian laughed, the andersigned continued that: if the.
Soviet. union wanted to give money to the Mexican Communist
Party to ongage in such shenanigans ‘to amuse the local members
of socialist countries, it was fine with the Américans, as
this is just about all it could hope to achieve. SVESTKA
and LOGINOV naturally denied ‘that their countries had anything
to do with tho Mexican Communist Party, not to speak of the
overt lettor on the Ambassador, The undersigned, tongue in
cheek, thon pointed out that he was glad to tell them for
their information that a Communist Party did exist in Mexico.
Perhaps the most interesting reaction of SVESTKA came towards
the end of tho:party just before the undersigned left. iz
During a discussion which included SVESTKA, LOGINOV, one ‘of
the Soviet military attaches (a tall colonel with white hair),
another Russian, and a-youngish, short, and chubby member of
the Mexican Foreign Ministry the undersigned expressed a
thoucht that the two systems of government, the capitalist and ~
the soviet, were gradually inching.closer together. When
SVESTKA allowed himself to-doubt it with a nasty little laugh
the undersigned naturally could not resist telling him to
have a look at what was. going on in his country. The reaction
of SVESTKA Was both immediate and noticeable. He sort of
straightened out, jerked his head back, opened his mouth,
dropped the ashes of his cigar on the floor, and obviously

- bit his tongue as he said nothing. From thé above-and from.

the fact that SVESTKA. plans to drive to the next Consular
Association meeting in Guadalajara with his Soviet colleagues,
the undersigned feels that SVFSTKA isnot only a lackey of the
€X-NOVOTNY regime, but very probably in the employ of the
Soviet KGB. He seems to be inseparable from LOGINOV and has

“lately. mouthed the same provocations in the sane techniques,

showing himself more and more aggressive, a thing which he
was not a year ago.

3. Among other nasty little remarks made by LOGINOV,.
including references to tho. open letter against the Ambassador,

_the war in-Wietnam, the Negro problem, the difficult financial

-position of ‘the dollar, et cetera, was a reference to this
Station.- “LOGINOV. at one point asked the undersigned where _ 7
he worked (not the. first time he hasasked this).° The under= &
gigned told him ‘that he worked .in the: Consular General's f
Office: . LOGINOV then said, "What about the fifth. floor?"

The undersigned told him that the fifth floor comprised both
the: Ambassador's Office and the Political Section. LOGINOV
went on to say something like,. "I know about the Ambassador,
but what about the other offices, those occupied by WOFIRN?”
The undersigned let that one go by as LOGINOV had obviously
found it very funny. fie proceeded to pay back the Soviets a
littte later by counting on his fingers the number of visas
issued at the Soviet mmbassy each year, the number of cultural
exchanges handled by the Embassy, staff,--and:"all tho work
done for trade promotion with Mexico." ~The undersigned felt ~
tha ‘the Soviets probably issued some five visas.a month, if
thac many, had about ten cultural exchanges a year, and had
practically no trade with the Mexicans. What, thon, he asked,
were the 40 odd "diplomats" in the-Soviet Embassy doing in
Moxico? LOGINOV laughed, but he laughed green and promptly
broke off. this conversation.

4. The undersigned had no opportunity to talk at any
length with Ambassador HANUS, who was very busy at the
reception. The Ambassador, how.ver, greeted him warmly and
gave him a prolonged bear hug as he left. The undersigned i
had no talk with the Cubans except a few words which he
exchanged with Sergio MARTINEZ, whom he, had not met before.

driveway, Subject, in View of his wife phir two children and the

and returned and shot the dom while the children screamed, Mrs.
BESABER tried to suppress her own tears and shoo away the children
at the same time, and the four Russians sat aghast in their car
and: watched. LOGINOV acted extremely sorry and did his best to
console Mrse BESABER and Subject, Mrs. BESABER recovered quickly,

replied that he still wanted very, fuch to play, but that it was
always a question of time for him. "Why didn't LOGINOV come down

He (1ocTKO¥) and Mrs. BRSABER cou)d play tennis in the morning while

to hear from LOGINOV, and when LOGINOV didn't call, he called
LOGINOY (confirmed by LIENVOY). LOGINOV, according to Subject,
said he was afraid he was not going to be able to make it, after ;
all, because the Mayor of Moscow was visiting Mexico. and he would)
be tied up with the Mayor on Saturday. Subject said he suggested |
that perhaps they could make it for the following Saturday, then, i
LOGINOV replied that he thought he might be able to make it then, |
but, again, he couldn't say for sure just then. "But anyway,” |
LOGINOV added, “we're going to be seeing each other more often
because we've (ees, the Soviet Embassy) taken a house on Calle

Unbolt (in Cuernavaca) for the summer, and I'll be coming down
to Cuernavaca every weekend." Subject expresséd pleasure at

BEXFEP to Bellas Artes for a performance. Subject said that
unfortunately, he wouldn't be able to Ro, but suggested that

The undersigned then went ono step further and pointed out that

4. Subject and I froa the beginning have had a very friendly
and informal relationship. He is an intelligent person with-a
friendly, open Personality and a good sense of. humor, Politically,
he is pro-American to the point that he magnifies our strengths
and positive qualities and tends to minimize or overlook negative

factors in our society. Subject knows I am with the Political.
Section of the Embassy and that I have been in the Soviet Unions
We have consequently gotten onto the topic of Russians and
Communism several times, and he has always: come out a strong
anti-Communist. He has one brother and two sisters living in
she United States. The brother is married to an American and
lives in Virginia, where he is in the construction business.

One of the sisters is also married to an American aad lives in
Californi: (I believe San Francisco}. The second sister is
married to a Polish immigrant and lives with him in Chicago.

The sister in "1ifornia is a naturalized American citisen. The
brother and the sister in Chicago are not.
5+ Om 2h April 1967, LIEWVOY reported the following cali
from OAZIYEV ‘to LOGINOV:
GAZ: "I saw him, he arrived yesterday.”



05

L0G; "Excellent. Then I'd like to see you to discuss
certain things."

GAZ: "Then I can come there tomorrow?”

LOG: "No, better Wednesday."

GAZ: "All right. He usually comes there at 6 o'clock.

i He got married and came here with his wife. Now

Hl they look for an apartment. I'11 go there on the

E 10th, because I want to attend courses in English.

This week -I'1l be busy.” f

‘ "L0G "OK, until the next then.” | :
6. From this conversation, it appeared that GAZIYEV was

probably talking about Subject, since: H

(a) GAZIYEV had been taking Spanish at the Mexican-North : \

American Institute and I knew from Subject that Subject had had :

GAZIYEV in one of his classes, that Subject occasionally chatted
with GAZIYEV after class, and that GAZIYEV had once given Subject
an invitation to a Consular night at the Soviet Embassy (although
Subject told me he had not gone).
(bv) Subject hed gotten married that months
(ce) Subject ‘had just returned to Mexico. with his brides
(d) Subject and his wife were looking for an apartments
(e) subject normally arrived at the Institute at 1800
to teach evening Spanish classes.

: 7. Prior to this reported telephone conversation, I had
considered using Subject as.an access agent against GAZIYEV,
but had decided not to approach Subject on the patter unless
there was evidence that his relationship with GAZIYEV waa
developing into something more than occasional chats between

classes, I did not see much potential in approaching Subject
before this with tnezae the idea of having him deliberately
cultivate a friendship with GAZIYEV, as I felt Subject waa living



such @ busy and hectic life that I would get very little out
of hin. Prior to his marriage, he was ‘koeping such a hectic
schedule between his Institute and private classes that he

wasn't sleeping or eating properly and was having increasing
- problems with his health, If anything, his pace and health
problems increased after his marriage and his taking of the
_ Job with the American School (although he gave up most of his
private classes). ff
8. Since the GAZIYEV-LOGINOV conversation: mado Subject's

relations with the Soviets look much more interesting, I attempted
to find out what I could about then from Subject... For a number

of reasons, however==including ny going to the States in June--
we were not able to get together juntil 12 July. On that date
z took Subject to a belated “bachelor's lunch" ata little
Spanish restaurant downtowns :

9. The lunch was disappointing and, for me, misleading.
I was certain that 1f given the opportunity, Subject would
voluntarily tell meif his relationship with GAZIYEV had
developed any further. When I casually brought the conversation
around to GAZIYEV, however, Subject ‘simply told me that GAZIYEV ..”
was still studying at the Institute and that he still occasionally
chatted with him in the halls or over a cup of coffee in one
of the. near-by coffee shops during the 20-minute break between
the two evening classes. Subject commented that he enjoyed
talking with GAZITEV, as he was a simpatice, interesting guy,
as well as an outstanding Spanish student. Hoe also added that
they never talked politics. In roply to an offhand question
about whether he had met any other Soviets through GAZIYEV, Subject



c oe : ci oa
1

said that he had not. My inclination waa to believe Subject, and
I went away thinking that either GAZIYEV and LOGINOV had been
talking about someone else over the phone or that they had
never gone beyond the stage of simply talking about Subject.
: 10.. Onl November 1967, I ran into Subject and his brother
"Javier in Sanborns-Insurgentes. They were about to have a
quick lunch and insisted that I join them for a cup of coffee.
As. soon as wa sat down, Subject told me he had ‘a problem and
would like my advice; Hé said GAZIYEV had given him an invitation
to the 7 November celebration of the Revolution at the Soviet
Embassy, and although he would like to go for the experience,
he was very concerned that his name would be put on "the black
list" at the U.S. Embassy if he went. He said that he had
tried to call me at the Embassy after he got the invitation to
ask my advice, but had been told I was out of tow. (I was in
El Paso from 25-29 October.) He stated that if he had not been
able to reach me in the next day or two, he was going to simply
- walk into the Embassy and ask to seo someone from the “security
department” about his predicanint. What. did I think he should
‘do? i

LL, I told Subject to relax and forget about going to the
U.S. Embassy, as the Embassy.would not give him any advice
other than to tell him that: it was entirely his own business
whether he went to the Soviet reception or not. Besides, I
asked, what made Subject thi ia name would be put on @
"black list" ag he went. Sub, + replied that he didn't know
how the U.S. Embassy did it, but Feveryone knew" the U.S»

Embassy obtained the names of everyone who went: in and out of


the Soviet Embassy. Moreover, he said, even if the U.S. Sabassy
rafused to give him any advice, at least it would make a record
of his visit and anyone who ws ever interested would his

heart was in the right place. He. simply did not want and couldn't
afford to get into any trouble with the U.S, Bnbassy, he said.

after all, he had an American wife, he might want to go to the
“States to study sometime, and they might even want to go to

‘

the States to live someday. Seeing that. Subject was indeed very

: serious, I became more serious myself and told him that just so H

‘he wouldn't worry, I'd write a meto to the proper Enbassy

t .
‘ department stating for the sake of the record that Subject had

told me he planned to attend a Soviet -Eubassy reception, but
wished the U.S. Embassy to know he was doing it solely out of
curiosity and was in no way in sympathy with the Soviet Union.
Subject seemed greatly relieved and thanked me very much.

12. Seizing of the fact that GAZIYEV had given Subject. the

: invitation, I asked if Subject saw much of him anymore. Subject

replied that yes, he still saw him occasionally, as GAZIYSV: was

“now studying English at the Institute. Subject added, on his

own’ initiative, that he, had also been to GAZIYEV's. apartrent
twice and had met another Soviet there on one occasion. He said
that the first time he went to GAZIEV's was shortly before he
(subject) got married (subject e@ was married about mid-April

1967) and the second time was shortly after his mrriage, @s he
‘and his wife had gone to dinner at the GAZIYEVS'. .Subject finished

eating about this time, and since he was ina hurry and had
his brother with him, I didn't try to question him any further,

“but decided to wait and have a second go at him alone another

not afford ap opportunity to discuss the Soviets any further.
4 te i Subject did tell me, however, that he had not gone to the .
: 7 November Soviet reception afterall, because, despite by
assurances that there sas no reagon for him not to go, he
felt it was simply safer to stay away foom the Soviet Enbassy
= altogether. At my suggestion, we agreed to get. together for
{ pees lunch sometime in the near future.
| Uy. For various reasons, including the poor state of
_Subject's health when I called him one day in January, we did :
. not get together for the lunch until’ 7 March. This time, I
Played it straight with Subject, told him that I was interested
in anything he could tell me about GAZIYEV and the otherSoviet
he had met, and questioned him closely regarding the details.

Subject was completely cooperative, and I am satisffed he answered

my questions to the best of his ability. It seewed to mé, and .

still does, that there was only one Possible reason why Subject

had not told me on 11 July what he subsequently told me on

l November (1.e., that he had been to GAZIYEV's home twice and

on one occasion had met another Soviet theré). This was that

| | i he felt somewhat guilty about going to GAZIYEV's and meeting

the other Soviet there, and as long as I didn’t push him too

i hard (which I didntt on 12 July), he felt wore comfortable
ignoring it. The roason he so readily mentionad the two visits
and the other Soviet on 1 Novenber was, I think, that he was

genuinely concerned not to "get tuto any trouble” with the U.S.

15. Subject stated that GAZIYEV had invited him to his
. apartment for dinner about a month before he (Subject) went ta
+ Chicago to get married. This means that the dinner took place
about mid-March 1967, Subject said he had expected to find
i only GAZIYEV and his wife in the apartment, but that a third
i 7 E ‘person was there when Subject arrived. Subject said GAZIYEV

introduced the third person as Valentin "something." when I

asked if the last name were LOGINOV, Subject immediately reacted

and said he was almost positive that was it. Subject's description

of the Soviet also fit LOGINOV:. GAZIYEV stated that LOGINOV was

with the Embassy (Subject couldn't remember in what capacity) and

described MOGINOV as a good friend. Subject said. that the evening :
t.

started off very casually, with LOGINOV expressing interest.

in the Spanish courses at the Mexican-North American Institute. ; | =

LOGINOV, who Subject noted spoke almost as good Spanish as most

of the Spanish teachers at the Institute, said he'd lake: to get

a certificate in Spanish from the Institute and asced Subject aft |
“he: could help him enroll, choose the best course for him to |

i start with, ete, Subject replied that he'd be happy to, ‘although
ae it didn't seem to him that LOGINOV needed’ much instruction in

Spanish, LOGINOV simply. laughed this off, ani it was agreed

: : LOGIMOV would drop around to the Institute sometimd soon,
LOGINOV, wno took the lead in the conversation most of, the
evening, then began to ask Subject questions which left Subject



with "no. doubt" that he (LOGINCV) was trying to fcol Subject out
on his political views. Subject said that he couldn't remember
: most of LOGINOV's questions, but he did recall that “LOGINOY
began the feeling-out procedure by asking Subject if he didn't
find that the Americans were much poorer at learning Spanish
than other nationalities. He also made various derogatory
; remarks about the extent of Amrican influence in Mexico. Subject
\ said that after about ten minutes, LOGINOV's purpose became so
y blatantly obvious, that he (Subject) stopped the conversation
‘and told LOGINOV that before they went any farthor, he thought
LOGINOV should know that he was talking to someone who was
"100% capitalist," completely pro-American, and had absolutely
: no sympathy with Communism, (While this sounds awfully blunt
| and Subject was unquestionably trying to make himself look good
ie my eyes, the fact of the matter is that Subject does tend to
be #8 a bit blunt at. times, and knowing his ideological leanings,.
: I would not. put it past him to have said exactly this.) Subject
‘ said that LOGINOV tried to backtrack a bit after this, but the
: conversation heated up again a few minutes later when Subject
‘ Commented that he had a pretty good idea of vhat the Soviets were
up'to in Mexico. When LOGINOV asked what Subject meant, Subject
,Felated the story he once told me about having boen in Veracruz
a few years ago when a Soviet ship was actually or virtually put
“under arrest there. Subject told LoGINoy that "everyone knew
the ship was loaded with Commnist propaganda.”
16, After about twenty minutes, according to Subject, politics

were dropped and the conversation turned to more innocuous topics.


Sudject said that LOGINOV seemed somewhat irritated with him, but
on the wiole kept his composure very woll and treatod Subject
politely for the two hours or less Subjoct remained. As Subject
; Nas leaving, LOGINOV again said ho'd come by the Institute to
, See Subject din the near future, but he never did. One day in
late "1967" Subject saw LOGINOV at the gas station on the corner
of Tacubaya and Juanacatlan, and LOGINOY greeted Subject by
nae. However, they did not converse with each other.
17.° Subject. said that GAZIYEV left most of the politically.
related part of the conversation to LOGINOV and never referred
to the evening again. However, a few weeks after Subject
returned to Moxico with his bride, GAZIYEV had Subject and his
wife over to dinner {this would place the second dinner in
about mid-May), ‘This time GAZIYEV and his wife were tho only
pthers present, and the evening passed without any reference
to politics. Subject stated that he still occasionally goes
across the street fora cup of coffee with GAZIYEV betweem
eVening classes at the Institute, but that he has: not. been
to GAZIYEV's apartment again and has never had GAZIYEV to his
home. :

18, Although Subject was very aware that LOGINOV's purpose
in meeting him was ‘to assess his exploitability, he did not seem
to fully appreciate that GAZIYEV had both fingered him for.
LOGINOV and set up the situation for LOGINOV to meet him. I
spelled this out for Subject’ and also informed him that LOGINOV.
was an exceptionally capable Soviet intelligence officer. I
also explained that it was very possible CAZIYEV was using the
Institute to spot other candidates for interviews with Soviet

open forthe typé of thing I was looking for,

intelligence officers, and questioned Subject about GAZIYEV's

activities and contacts at the Institutes iiowever, Subject said

that as far as he could tell GAZIYEV pretty much stuck to himself
at the Institute and did not have any particudar friends there
whom Subject knew about, Subject said he would keep his eyes
‘ however, and. would
let me know af he came onto anything interesting. Subject also
offered to "play up to™ GAZIYEV and/or LOGINOV under my guidance

ag. wished, but I declined the offer with appropriate expressions

of appreciation.
196 The question that remains unanswered after all this is,

of course, why LOGINOV and GAZIYEV were talking about Subject

over the phone.on 24 ‘April 1967. According to Subject, the
dinner which LOGINOV attended took place in March 1967, while
LOGINOV did not attend GAZIYEV's second dinner, which took

concerned how to handle Subject in the light of the LOGINOV~

Subject encounter in March. Whatever LOGINOV pad in mind on

2h Aprii, it would appear that it was finally decided that
GAZIYEV and his wife should simply have Subject and his wife

over to a peaceful dinner in order to at least partially erase

the memory of the first dinner.

the reciprocity issue to deny the Soviet request.)

after Christmas, found that the salesman had not delivered any

 Policeiian Recruited by LOGINOY -

1. In reviewing LOGINOV's SPR which WEENING has “just
‘completed, I note that LOGINOV recruited ithis policeman
1938 moaths ago and that his first requirement was on the _
BOESTROM couple, At that time we gave LITEMPO~8 traces on
LOGINOV saying that he was a dangerous KGB officer,
LITEMPO-8 subsequently mentioned that the case was continued
and bie he, himself, was directing it. -/ :

23. If you think that LITEMPO-8 will. cooperate, i would
like to°know the-following about this case; ‘

(a) Is it still active?

(>) Did the policeman pass info to LOGINOV
‘on the BOESTROM couple? If so, what? Was
there any follow-up? : . i

(ce), What type of requiremedts has. LOGINOV {
given to the policeman? Are day Americans
Asvoived?

(a). Have any other Soviets been involved vith 5 2

this. case?
{bord

we
(e)_. Who as hand2ing him while LOGINOV 46 ie the
USSR.on vacation (he left Mexico on 16 Jjuly¥?

As a sf for discussing this. case you could mention
that j about LOGINOV because. he:
specializes in US operations tried to recruit a chauffer

¥. and tried to develop a female Foreign Servi

_ policeman may be in support of American operatio:

“thie would not necessarily be apparent, There fo.

hie name in the diplomatic list. Further, he told S that he waa doing a
good job, which he appreciated, but he muct be very cautious because the
Chinese are clever people and extremely auspicious.

6. “Ta reply to S'question L0G stated thatfor anyone of them (Sov
Embd offioial)would meet with TANG, because that it too dengerous. § que~
ried what was dangerous about it and LOG steted that there was always

@ chance that they (TANG and LOS or another Sov) might be seen together
and that would bo very bad. 5 went on to tell S that it would be his

job to develop friendly relatione with TANG ot possibly another Chinese
offioial and slowly obtain from him the info LOG and his embassy needed;
LOG will guide him ae to how to go about it and if they show confidence
in & he will have it made and Sove (‘L0G used the expression: VE ) would
pay him very well for that job. £ commented that he had believed that
what he Wae doing he did out of personal friendehip with LOG and not

for money. LOG emiled at §' statement and added that in addition to meney
they (Sovs) enable & to travel to Eov Union and heve a vacation on the
Blaok Sea. :

Te While § wae thinking whether to say something or keep quiet, LOG
told him that the next. time he went to TANG he should limit hie conv

to the publishing of the article about Net Ohina and if neéded 4 deny

ga it sounded, because one cannot just eek a pereon what wee his nase

that the publishing of the article about Kat Ohina may end in @ blind alley

not want that to happen and he told 6 that he (L0G) would give him

MY 1,000.- if the printing of the article should be held because of lack
of advertising. S brought to LOGe attention that half of pase of advertising
‘brings to Pierre (RUDIAN) 1,500.- pesos. L0G felt that he would pay that
money 48 8 price of keeping the door open to the Chinese Emb for §. To
put eome coating on the pill §-added that he would try to obtain an adit
or two from Ohinese restaurants, but he daoubted ‘that the owners would
be interested in advertising in a magazine which is far from being well |
known. Just the idea that $ conteplated going to Obinese restaurants
plessed 106G's ear.

LSHIPORENKO was given the task of cultivating and
Sktemptivx to re-recruite hin after LOGINOV failed Subject had
Stve Anteresting comments about LOGINOV (P-11.712) which seem te
dive with ctber comments which have been nade abeyt hin, LOGINOV

Subject.- When he failed, he felt rebuffed nnd has since been very
cool towards Subject. Subject believes that LOGINOV either has or
thinks he has -been given bad marks by his superiors for having

failed with Subject, =LOGINOV is Probably jealous or NECHIPORENKO who
has at least managed to retain Subject's friendship, Subject says

-—_that"LOGINOV is act dumb and that he uses his good looks to great

Advantage Particularly with women, :

. Subject has recently had some dealings with IVANOV (P-1612) who
is furious for the following reason: Formerly Soviets leaving Mexico
Would take KLM or Sabena to Eutope where they would pick up Aeroflot
the following day. KLM and Sabena would pay overnight hotel costs,
Now, however, the Soviets are picking up Aeroflot in New York.
Because of Scheduling, however, they still must spend at least one
wight in New York. The airlines will not pay this and IVANOV wanted
Subject to cover it, Subject refused for the very sound reason that
At did not make sénse for him to pay $20 for selling a $127 ticket

TfrOm_which his profit was only $9, IVANOV became furious and Subject
* ylelded by agreeing to pay for -IVANOV's accommodations and he said he
would do it for those becoming as friendly, such as NECHIPORENKO, but
he would not do it as a general rule, While Subject was away,
however, his wife went overboard aud got IVANOV four rooms ~(for two
People), Now Subject is furious,

On 31 July Subject’ was visited by PRIKHODKO (P-2270) who came
in carrying a. copy of Pravda or Izvestiya, Subject quoted the old Beate
Saw, _ "There is no truth in Pravda and oo news in Izvestiyz," and
PRIKHODKO got mad claiming Subject was acting very unfriendly by
making anti-Soviet propaganda, PRIKHODKO wos very serious, This is
Probably as good and as accurate'a thvmbnail Sketch on PRIKHODKO that
we arelikely to get. PRIKHODKO, Who s2id that he wes leaving in
Septeyber, had visited Subject to find out what Subject knew about
@ congress of Jewish intellectuals which is. to be held in mid-September _
in Bogota to discuss the Jewish problem ‘n the Soviet Union. PRiKHODKO
wanted to know whe was going from Mexico. Subject told PRIXHODKO that
he had not heard 3f the congress but wev'ld check into it, He did check

of the meet waa ‘to have £112 the PAQ on LOGINOV (Pe11,712), which wae
accompliehed to a eatisfactory degree, 1.¢. 26 pages out of 53. Further,
FERNALD wented to check what S hes done or prepared for his next meet

2. 04 Priday Aug 1 at 1400 brea 3 celled on OIN@USI“N TANG, Minieter
Gounselek of tha Nat Ohinese Emb at his office, The purpose of the

co was to explain that the magazine La Mision goes to press the latest

6n the 18th of the month and it was too late to have anything published

on Nat. Obina. In accordance with the instruction § received from Pierre
RUDIAN, 8 told TANG that in publiching euch articles the magazine writes
then aeqording the wishes of the embassy of the country about which
they are written, Because embassies pay only the subscription, they

‘usual: eee to tt that at least a palt of page of advertising is in-
eluded in the same issue. ’

Se PANG expreased unde retarding for such a pasties and stated that
he wae intereated in hevPHRTAR"ERtiole on the Republic of Ohina and
probably one on ChienwXax-Shek and that he would ree to it that a proper
amount of ade be purchased.

4. TANG went on to eek which entsaries are oubreribers of the
mogasine and which use it for publishing articles. 8 atoted that precticale
ly all endsesies ere subscribers acd almost all of then had their ertiolee
published at one tise or tie other. TANG, apparently, wae not estiafied
with this anewer and he asked point fa blane was the gov Babaesy @ sub=
soribor,
a

than 8 anewnved affirastively. TANG asked 8 did he know onybody

in.the Sov Bstassy, 8 stated tuat ue was on friendly terma with an
official of the Sov Embsssy. TANG commented that thie wae tinsual, because
Sove saké- frends with nobody. 8 stated again that he had no other way
of calling hie relation with the.Sov officiel than a personal frienéehip.
In “reply to TAKC question $.etated that he prefered not to mention the
nase of bie Sov friend and. TANG asked what position did 88 Sov friend
have. $ replied that an far as he knew the Sov official quite nigh up
(G40). TANG continued hie questioning: what was the nature of S relation-
ship with the Sov, wae it a basiness type relationship; how often did they
see each other; where daw they meet. S stated that he never transacted
any busivesa with the Sov and they meet about twice a month for a dinner
or lunch in various reoteurante. 8 added that the Sov plays tennis every
week~end and that he (£) sometine goes to watch him playing (Note: the
latter statement ie not true), TANG asked did 8 play tennis and he an-
swered negatively.
6. At thie point 3 asked wae he interasted in meeting hie Bov friend
and TANG stated that be was. Then, 8 asked tuk TANG whet should he say
to his Sov friend. TANG commented that thie was a good question and he
told $ that he would think about it. Consequently, he asked 8 could he
pass by on Honday or Tuesday (Aug 4 or 3 ) and S said he would.
7 Inu reply to Fe question & stated that he intended to tell L0G
exactly what tranpired on his weet with TANG and that he planned
visiting TANG on: Monaday so that he would be able to tell LOO did TAND-
decide to meet LOG.
a. F told § that he was going too far in pleasing LCG and. was
getting in a deeper and deeper moss by retting involved with the Nat
Chinese, it wee obvious from the attitued of ur. TANG that he read him
through and wae taking hie time to find,could he benifit. something out
of the whole scheme. erefore, S eshoald aleo take it easy end not
ruch to see TANG on Monday, {.e. before seeing LOG; further, he should |
stick to hie previous decision that it was rather dangeroue to be
peeting with L0o often, :
9. § felt that LOG would presa for a moet wath § 88 soon as possible {

if we wanted him to drop L0G we would had told him to do it. Nevertheless,

consequently, the US security is getting nothing out of S collaboratton

2. No cocktails were taken before the meal and with the meal beer
wae drank. LOG lead off with questions concerning L-le family, health,
work and ontertainment. “|

3. Ammong questions concerning L-l'swork there were also questions
concerning LIOVAL-1: was Iel giving him classes regularly; was LIOVAL~1
asking L-l questions about the USSR or Sov offieiele; did LIOVAI-1 make
any statements which would show "how he breates. politically"(eio). Lel
gave routine answer pcinting out that LICVALe1 does not hesitate to epeak
about hie family matters and work, but he never aeke questions of any
kind; be takee his languece classes regularly s there were no statements
concerning political matters,

4 Iel told Log that July 24 or 25 @ young man Victor I RAMOS
ealled on him in the eveniog at home and told him that he needed a trance
lation of about 20 pages of Russian text into to Spanish ard that he

was sent by LOG and he seked tim iio waa the pereon. LOG stated that he
did not know. the person and aince it wae a matter of translation he (L0G)
sent him to L-1 hoping that he may earn some money by making the translation
L-1 asked LOG did he know that RAMOS epoke come Rusedan which he learned
at the IIORK. LOG stated that he wes not aware of that fact. L-1 will
make the traslation if he oan handle the terainoxogy dealing with economy.

3. I-l told LCG that he spoke to ¥, MUNOZ about the Sov fils and
that MUNOZ wae pleased with the offer. Due to the fact that UNOS ia
presently undergoing @ trestsent he waé not adle to sake arrangexenta
for showing of the film. In reply to LOG's question I-] stated that
HUNOZ wanted to show the fils in the Communist Party Centro (sic) at

Verssillee, L0G exclaimed that for 4eavens sake he did not anything like
that; he wanted this to be entirely on private and personal basis without
political elements involved; to show the film at Versailles would be
etupid, it would just enable the imperialiste to blast in the papers
that the Sove were getting involved in internal political matters of
Mexico in view of the coming Presidential elections this could bé blown
up into a ecandal. I-l remarked that he eaw no difference in showing the
film in the OP0entro or in the Centro Asturiano ae LOG wanted originally.

LOG explained at length the difference and IL-1 promised to have another

talk with MUNOZ. 7 :
6. L-l told shat LOG: that quite recently he saw in the prees some—
thing written to the effeot that there sre presently in the USSR 4 types
of detsntion ( concentration ) camps and he wondered whether that was
@n indication that the freedom in the USSR wae being trimmed again. LOG
stated that "this was pure imperialist propaganda". He went on tu say
that in the USSR the cefees are full of people and that one can hear then |
even oritisiging the government. He added that in hie opinion there is

too such. (demasiado mucho) freedon in the USSR and other Socialist countries!|

1 The meet was prearranged and it lasted about two hours. The prev
viously used procedure wae followed: S and LOG met in front of the re-
etaurant and they entered it together. As ususlly, LOG wae sharp in ap-
pearing a& on the spot.
TE2ZIR NEXT MEET: On Aug 4 at Samborns Insurgentes-Tarquena at
2000 bre.

2. Qourse_of the eet.

LOG aeked § why he did not come "to play tennis with bim” at
the Praneh Olut on July 12. $ explained that he was not. feeling well
and that he did not recover completely from the flu which he had all
week, 5 added that. only for the reason of keeping the word given to a
friend (L0G) he came to thie meet. Nice worde by LOG who concluded that
he brought 8 2 bottles of Votka which can be used ag " a medicine” for
colde and similar disconforts.
3. As it could be expected after such an opening of the meet LOG
wae interested wae 8 able to accomplish something for him. 8 told him that
he had done what he promised snd gave LOG the written report which L0G
read, When-he finished the reading LOG remarked that 8 did not eign the
report, When 8 said that he was willing to do it right there, 100 eaid
that. it wae not necessary and that he was only joking.
ae LOG spent considerable amount of time in questioning 8 about
the reasons, consequences whick the cancellation of PEMEX contract(e)
with eome US 012 companies. At certain. point the questions lecked clarity
and 8 esked L0G point blano what wae he driving at. L0o stated that &
should reolize that the WSR 16 the second largest producer of of] in
the world (#10) and that he wae interested in finding out wan it possible
for the USER to etep in whore the Americane kicked out (ic). & told LOG

3. LOG commented that the USSR wae very much interested in ape
ing strong economic interchange, especially trade, with Mexico a wore
not finding the right atmosprere nor proper respouse. in Mexico. Ye asked

8 what, in hie opinion,. eould or should be done to overcone this situation.
8S sanewered that ne belteved that the Sova ought to change their mentality ;
if they wanted to trade with Xexico, naimly, in the field of trade they
should forget about Socialism and adapt the Capitalietic mentality: to
trade with Mexico Sve would have to establish industrial plante here

and to do it Xexicene must have $1 per. cent share in each case, which
meane the controling atook; in reality this does not mean that Nexicans
would invest 51 per‘Gent of the value.....ere

6. 106 went to the other item of the written report and he ssked

8 how he went about in contacting Ohin-Ueien TANG, counselor of the

Net Chinese 3mb. 6 told him about posing as @ reporter for the magazine

La Kieion and going there on reocommendation of Pierre RUDIAN ( fee
FERNALD's previous contact report). 8 edded that in the Sept iseue of the
magazine there would be an article dealing with Nat China and the

Poiking © Moecow coflict and if needed another artciole on Ohing-Kai Shek
would be pudlished. 10G told § that he was pleased with the manner in
whiah 8 handled the task he gave him. LOG did not disouss the contents

of this part of Ss report and he questioned § about CHTANG: he wanted

to know wae 8 ia s position to keep this scoquaintance alive and develop

it in to @ eort of friendly inforwal.relationehip; he (L0G) knew TANG from
some formal diplomatio gatherings and he liked the person. 8 believed that
he wae able to keep alive the established acquaintance and was not able

to guese as to bem far te would be able to develop it. LOG suggested

that 6 do not allow too mich time to pace until his next vieit to TAN.

B gaia that he cculd cell on TANG on Fri July 25 to explain him that

he 414 net succeed in getting the article in the Aug issue of the magazine

Se

to bring his relationship with TANG to a point that LOG could meet TAES
ina friendly unofficial manner. LOG concluded that for such a job he
was willing to pay 8 in terme of thourands of Dollars, After the dust
of verbage settled LOG..told 8 that he should try to feel out TANG was
he willing to speak about the military stregth of Red Ohina. LOG ex-
plained to S that presently the Sova were completely in dark as to the
nilitary strength and operational organisation of the Red Chinese army;
they have no way of acquiring the info because even if they had friends
in Red China none of them dared to maintain contact with Sov officials
nor offioials of other Socialist countries which are known to be on the
Sov side; Net Ohina has many spies in Red Ohina and they are well infced
on all aspects of developments in Red Ohinar 1¢ is poseible that TANG
would be willing to sake arrangements with hie government for exchange
of info, especially, military info between the USSR and the ep. of Ohina
and this would be beneficiary to the USSR and the USA. LOG went on to
tell 6 that he should think in terms of using RUDIAN for getting to
meet TANG out of hie embassy: be that a party or whatever might be |
needed, the expenses will taken oare of by LOG, because money is no:
problem.

TM. Then, LOG etated that § should arrange something to enable LOG
to meot RUDIAN in a emall, family type, circle. 8 wae cought by surprise

“and told LCG that he told him that he and RUDIAN were quite often seeing
_ 80h other. LOG stated that he knew RUDIAN well and wae in say instances

with RUDIAN at Teoeptiona and other formal social functions, but he er
had an oportunity to be with RUDIAN in friondly and unforms1 circumstances.
8 commented that the only problem he found. in trying to make such an:
arrengenent was in the fact that RUDIAN often, sometime even twice in a
week, drops in to seé § at hie (Josephine's) apt but he never announces

hie visite in advance’ more than an hour or two before he comes. i i

8. L0G asked 8 what happened to the US Eb phone directory; ‘asa the.
girl (friend of S) return, 8 anewored that he did not have the slightest
idea what was going on, "because in his condition (of health) he did joven :
go to oheck dia the girl return",

9. LOG was proposing that thoy meet in the course of the next week
but S told hia thet he felt that they were nesting too often and in view



- o4e

of his atatus of a tourist it may be aseumbed that the Gobernacion carry

out spot checks on him; if he was to be eeen by the Sebernacion or Security

agente in company of LOG it is prety certain that they would take hia

--_—tn-and interrogate him; he thinks that this can be avoided if they do not

see each other so often. |

10. LOG agreed with 8" “reasoning and added that he himself realised
“that they were getting together too often and he aleo cannot be 100 per
cent sure that he is not tailed core-time. Therefore, he will out a plan
by whioh they will be able to see each other whenever 1t¢ is needed and
will limit their regular peraonal meets to twice per month. He went on
to tell S that he would pick up an aprepriate spot on which 8 will place

~. @ ohalk sign when he neede to se LOG urgently; LOG will paes by the place

every morning and if he see the sign he will erase it which will assure

§ that he und retood his request and they would then meet the same evening
at a place (restaurant) which they would select only for this purpose.

&0G concluded by stating that thie wae the general idea and that he would
work out the details which he will explain to 8 on their next meet which
they would hold in two weeks, i.e, August 4. :

n. S commented that.the plan looked good and if LOG was sure that
it would work then there was no need for them to meet wore than one a
month. LOG stated that 2 meets per month were needed in spite of the

fact that he was positive that his system was dependable.

12, 5 told LOG that he did not spend any of tha MH 400.- he gave
bim for the purpose of establishing contact with an official of the
Bat Ohinese Bmb and consequently wanted to return the money. LOG told
him to keep it for himself and that he would give him money, as much ae
needed, if he had an oportunity to entertain TANG.

“1s. There was some pnconsequential talk and LOG told 3 to coge
to the Prench Oiub any Saturday and that he would teach him to play
tennis. LOG expleined that he wae going to the club every Saturday
about 1000 hret 6 will be allowed to enter if he says that LOG was
waiting for hin. ‘

filma picture of her, but while he thinks he may have seen her,
he does not know her, Ne will check with his wife who may very

_ had been very close to LOGINOV (P-11,712) and that I was interested
" to find out if she would now, since he bas departed, transfer her
‘attention to one of the other Soviets, (I was specifically
interested in finding out whether or not Gloria and RNYSH had
met on the morning of 29 November as indicated by LIENVOY, but
ELLY had not been at the French Civb that worning.)

3. FULLY commented that he had found it hrrd to make contacts
at sports clubs in Mexico than in other countries, Mexicans were
particularly difficult to become friendly with and it was not at
‘all uncommon to have a tenis match with no personal contact
whatsoever. He said, however, that he thought the French Club
_was bette: than most in Mexico City, Even though the people
at the Frerch club were rather clanish, it was easier to get to

7:00 to 9:00, Actually, they arrived at about 7:45 and left

at about 9:15, SISTONE had two main purposes in attending the

.Yeception: 1) to detexmine. LOGINOV's replacement, and 2) to

meet the Cubans present, if any. On the first count “SISTONE

was successful,

introduced to the crowd as LOGINOV's replacement by Mr. KAZANTSEV,

Oleg Maksimovich NECHIPORENKO was formally

the Soviet Chargé. On-the second count SISTONE was not

successful, ‘The only Cuban present that he recognized from.

mug photos was Rafael MIRABAL Fernandez, who quite obviously

avoided any contact with SISTONE, rather furtively staying on

the other side of the room at all times. In‘all, SISTONE

talked to some nine Soviet ‘Dubassy officials that he could

recognize from the mug book and had somewhat extensive con-

versation with three, LOGINOV; KAZANTSEV, the Chargé; and

Eduard Anatolyevich SARATOV, TASS representative.

did her best to’ be a charming hostess, although this was
obviously a forced chore for her. (Later in the evening she
busied herself pointing out what. she thought to be the choicest
items on the buffet table.) Valentin LOGINOV invited SISTONE
and his wife to visit him in Russia. SISTONE answered to the
effect that this would be wonderful ‘someday if te or the
Russian Government would pick up the tub, LOGINOV replied
that that was not necéssary because all Americans are so rich

they can afford a trip anywhere. Later, talking: to SARATOV

Bood-by to SISTONE (accompany ing this with an abrazo), |
LOGINOV's last words to SISTONE were said with much real or

real friends in these days of the world.”

4. Negatively, SIsToNE did not see LIREALM-1; SAO's
friend, yuriy VANOVSKY;, or Chief, .S§'s fricnd, Boris CHMYKHOV,
at the Soviet reception, Since there were over 100 people
milling about, SISTONE, of course, could have missed those
People.

8. Prior to the buffet, SISTONE met again Leon (Spanish

version of Lev) N, GOLOUZOV, a member of the Soviet Commercial

" Staff. SISTONE had met GOLOUZOV on the Ford excursion as

The Chargé described him as a young man advancing rapidly in
the Sovict Foreign Service.’ He also éaid he had been a Fempe
Militury- Attache before but is now a Sccond Secretary and
is taking over as Consul. The Chargé described NECHIPORENKO
as a non-Great Russian, SISTONE missed his nationality, if it
was mentioned. The Chargé hastened to’ add- that NECHIPORENKO' s |
wife, hovever, is Great Russian. eens :

9. Possibly the longest conversation SISTONE had with
any Russian was that with Eduard Anatolyevich SARATOV, the. TASS
representative. SISTONE was introduced to him by Findley
HOWARD, local Pan American representative; SARATOV was the
only one with whom SISTONE spoke in ‘English. All other coa-
‘versation with Russians and other non-Americans was in Spanish.
SARATOV is a very smooth, gallant man-about-town. He seemed
to really enjoy talking to Americans and other non-Russians at
the reception, and bowed and established rapport with the ladies
of all ages. He said he has been in Mexico two years, is
married,, and has one son in the fourth grade, who is naturally
attending the Embassy school and who will be sent next year
to the Soviet Union for his further education. He asked
SISTONE how many children he has and commented on the answer,
five, by saying that in his business it is not practical to
have many children. SISTONE asked him how he gets his news to

send home. SARATOV replied that he is obliged to send home

daily a resume of the most important Mexican events, much of
which he obtains from‘the Mexican press. He. added, vith a
snile, that he, of course, has to supplement such newspaper
accounts with information from his own contacts. SISTONE
asked if this meant, among other things, getting handouts from
Governzent offices. SARATOV dismissed such sources as
unimportant. He said this daily resume which he sends home
by Telex takes him about two or three hours. tad said he is+
the Jone TASS representative here. He has his: own office :
separate from the Embassy and prefers it that way. SARATOV

claimed to have traveled around Mexico quite a‘bit. He seemed

- to be impressed with the Yucatan and wanted to know if SISTONE

has visited there. The latter replied that he hae not yet
visited the Yucatan since being stationed here, but that, as

a tourist, he had seen the ruins there some years ago. SARATOV
said that he is from Siberia, and in answer to a SISTONE
question said he thinks ‘He Georgians are the warmest and
friendliest people of the Soviet Union. SARATOV obviously
likes to brag about having been stationed previously in
Washington. He also said he would very much ike to have been
assigned to the new TASS office being opened in San Francisco.

and the U.S.S.R, the former will havé a Consulate in Leningrad

the TASS office in San Francisco is somchow connected with

three things for him to visit: a good steak house, a good . :

He thinks the space program a wonderful adventure for both our A
countries, and he mentioned the current negotiations between
the American Atomic nergy Commission and its Russian equivalent
in working out the rules for use of peaceful nuclear energy. yb
While affable, KAZANTSEV does not impart any feeling of oA iy H
sincerity whatsoever. He seems transparently cynical, ana \U" ug d

above conversation and when SISTONE was talking to a Mexican

airport official, for some reason KAZANTSEV reapproached —

SISTONE and said to him and the Nexican that he hoped there

would be a rapprochement soon between the United States and

Cuba, \ SISTONE cannot figure out why KAZANTSEV made that

remark at that particular time unless 1) he thought the Mexican .

airport. official wag.a Cuban, or 2) he had been briefed by
LOGINOV not only on the fact that SISTONE is FRADYER's replace-

ment, but that FRADYER had somehow been connected with Cuban

, Operations, .

i
very briefly to shake hands near the end of the evening. He
was easily recognizablo from his very light gray hair.

12. SISTONE was only sure of one Cuban's being present

” Rafael MUIRABAL. At oné time; SISTONE thought he saw a gentle-

man who looked a little like Ambassador Joaquin HERNANDEZ Armas,
but at second glance he did not think so. There was no doubt
in SISTONE's mind that MIRABAL was avoiding him, On one
occasion; MIRABAL was quite close, within earshot, and may well
have heard SISTONE either talking English to a fellow American
or his wife, or discussing something American. Thereafter,
every time SISTONE tried to work his way toward MIRABAL, the
latter would shortly move further away. Twice SISTONE talked
to people that vaguely looked like they might be Cubans from

the mug book, only to discover in both cases that they were

SUBSECT 2 Relationship Between AEDIEHARD and Gloria PINTO
1. In response to s conversation between Chief, SB, and the under-
‘signed, LIREALM-1 was questioned inletail on. 25 Septecber concerning

the relationship which exixts between AEDIEHARD and Gloria PINTO with a
view toward possible embarrassment of AZDIEKARD before his superiors,

-2, - LIREALM-1 atid his wife both belfeve (but have no proof) chat

~+it-is probable that Glorfa PINTO 4s having or haa had an affair vith
AEDIERARD. Both LIREALM and his wife are close friends of the PINTO's
snd know that Gloria is strongly attracted to AEDIEHARD wie is beth
physically. and datellectually superior to her busband. tue to Gloria's
continued friendship vith AEDIEHARD at the French Club and other placés,
LIREALN~1 feels sure chat Gloria's husband, Pepe, does not yet know of
the affeir. . .

3. LIRBALM=1 characterized Pepe PINTO as; avect, slow-witted and
below average in intelligence, ‘He is a physician specializing in lung dis-
orders,’ bora in the Canary Islands, He considers himself a Spaniard with
the @haracteristic spanish lack of respect for women, He attempts to
tigutiy control Gloria’s activities while, according to Gloria, having
: aa many affairs himself as he can, Gloria gseatly resents Pépe's attitude
ye - toward her, Pepe is basically defensive and would.not vant anyone to know
if Gloria were having.an affair vith anothar man, He vould probably deny
: it 4f anyona said so, even if he were aware of it, Re weuld take it out on
: Gloria, however, and would probably beat her and restrict her movements even

more closely,

| By In view of the above, it would certainly appear that there would be

is more to this invitation than meets the cye and that the KGB will

be going all out to recruit him, I think Subject may be right and

I think he should probably find a good excuse for not going.

Subject states that ho had complained to KAZANTSEV (P-880) about
the shoddy treatment he had been getting from LOGINOV (P=11,712),
Never before had he beon forced to "stand in line’ for Soviet visas !
for his clients, In the past, he had been able to sent passports
to the Soviet Embassy any day--nevor mind the office hours-~and get
the passports back with yisa the samo day. Subject says that 2Quey y arpretaar
LOGINOV hinself finally admitted that thicMias Voddusersubjevtshad- 4
been uncooperative (meaning that he had refused to let LOGINOV 1
recruit him), Subj¢ct. saya. unequivocally that LOGINOV is leaving
PCS by tho end of October and that he is not being replaced by a
newcomer, Subject Understands thatNECHIPORINKO, who in a former tour
bad worked in the Consular Section, will take over as Chief of the

Consular Section when LOGINOV leaves, : a
i

Subject days that KAZANTSEV is about to leave (in fact, Subject
thought KAZANTSEV had already loft} and that both a replacement for
hin and a now ambassador were on the way, I told Subject that as
far as I know, KAZANTSEV was to be replaced by another concierge Comeau
who would be Guareé, but Subject insisted that an ambassador had
been named and would be coming soon. He ‘did not know who the

ambassador would be.
A wi Foe:

Subject remarked that both IVANOV and NIXETO Soy had left and he
said that NIRITORON | was; he thought, a very decent person,

Subject said that PRIKHODXO (P-2270) had come to see him to say
goodbye. PRIKHODKO had said, almost with tears in his eyes, that
Subject had been a very good friend and that he vould never forgot
him, He invited Subject and wife toc visit hin in Moscow,

Then when Subject asked PRIKUCDKO for address, PRIKHODKO hemacd

and hawed and said that ho didn’t really have an address yet but
nt of

tho Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Subject remarked that PRIKHCDXO
was undoubtedly boing sincere, but when you cane right dova to it,
he wag just as henned in and afraid as anything of the others,
Subject said that 4 vas a real tragedy that the Soviet systen

Memorandum . isbestenbssunsteee

~ TOs RIZZUTO through ARCHBOLD

From: FERNALD
Subject: ABDIEHARD (P=11,712) & Thoughts Ro poesibility of Pitching His

1 Assuming it wae sgreed thet A should be pitnched before his PCS
departure, because there are no indications that he would be more suacept=
ible ixter to an approach-later. when he comes to 8 new post abroad in few
yeare and, to the contrary, it ie more likely that he would be etili more
daring, more selfoonfident and more determined to advance ané solidify

hie position within the KGB, I wish to add geome views of mine to the list

of possibilities aa to how a pitch could be cerried out.

2. My views and thoughta on this subject will be based on the postible
use of existing assets and means. I am fully aware that there will be

plenty of room for improvements, additione and modifications of what will

be said in the following peras.

3. As far as I know we ere lacking adequately solid fects in which

we could put our teeth, i.e. we do not wocatecnak posses worthwhile mention-
ing materiel whioh we could use to exert @ desired pressure on A. :
he I am inclined to believe that we are in a position to make @
serious attempt to obtain a "pressure argument" through the use of existing
agsete which are targeted against A and that it can be done without taking

an undue risk.
5e Ae a nove in this direction I was thinking

recorded @ SABORI“A meet for which we would prepare
specifio I have in mind a situation along the following 1inas:

in terms of having
SABORI. To be more

g

be SABCRI should go to such a meet with experession of
@ person Who ie in exceptionally good mood, because
- of a businese success and he wae given a subetantial
advence on his commission: After A and SARORI have
their routine two drinks, SABORI will state to A that
he would piok up the tab for the evening ( efter being
treated by A’ 80 many times ) tut he would want to
celebrate the ocoasion. It would be desirable that A
agrees. on 6 drink or two to please S, but even if that
doea not take place, it ie anticipated that A would
want to accompany 5{ ih hie good humors. What ever
ve the case, the situation lends itself to a free
talking, eritiosl commenting and aome bitching, juat
tu play it big. Jt will bé up to us, to prepare S as
to hew to run the benvereation to get out of A a few
statementé which he would not like hie superiors to
know abouts

-~8-
questions before opening the Jetter of ¢redit and that
it. war essential that the person who arrived here see
A, because that will strangthen S' position in the deal.
I mentioned the. platinum deal because it would give
some common ground to the hew person being introduced
- on the scene, but some other story might be ae good.

e. The new person showing up under the platinum deal
or any other pretext would be a case officer of ours.
I feel that such a person should at firet sight show
that he was a Yankee,.that he be versed in platinum
or what ever the pretext may be and that he should te
a Russian language speaker. I am inclined to believe
that after some business. talk and after creating an
atnospher of mtual understanding there would be no
problem for the case officer to start speaking Russian.
If A takes this fact in good. mood and the business
conversation. continues in Russian, S would be in a
position ‘to excuse himself as a person who was no longer
needed, It is almost impossible te anticipate what.
would be Ab reaction to the fact that & wanted to leave.
If insisted that S stay, we will have to accept it.
Nevertheless, S will be instructed to "go to the bathreom!
for a waile and the case officer will have to use this
opportunity to drop his cover and go on with his job.
Re will have in his pocket a reel. of tape to counteract.
AS emphatic refusal ( which we must anticipate ).

f. It may be mentioned that S will not have to know

Supervisor's coments (continued)

3. If he had teen looking for me, it could ba
that he has been asked to step in where Val failed.
That is,.as an American friend, I never invéted val
to my home. He never met other Americans through
ma. Note, however, that he never invited me to his
home either-=though he did invite us frequently to
various evonts which were under the auspices of the
Soviet embassy. We did net but rarely accept, One
such-occasion was the Noscow circus, :

4. If he had been looking for me, it could be
that he wants to assure his acceptance by our tennis
group where Gloria Finto isa possible target. Oleg
has gotten to Gloria, but I, the American who is
somewhat and Sometimes hostile to soviets, might be
considered a.stiumbling block. Perhaps he, Oleg, will
try to reach all the other mombers of the group in-
dividually so that an invitation by Gloria to one of
our functions will meet with general acceptances

SCENARIO OF CONTACT
YX arrived about 0900 and took an instructor. ,

About 0950 Oleg arrived to play with and in=
structor on the adjoining court. He made no effort to
grect me. He had been pointed out to me by val, but
I had not been pointed out to him 60 my knowledge-~
though it is certain that Oleg and jval must have :
discussed the "players" in their"game" and counted ,
me as possibly on the other team, That is, I am sure~
that Val has pointed. me out to Oleg, but Oleg would
not have wanted to acknowledge this.

“At 1000 my hour was up and I told my instructor
I was through--I did not want to continue for another
hour. As I was paying my instructor T noticed that
Oleg was paying his. It is very unusual and possibly
even had form to take an instructor for less than
hhalf-an-hour. I am suggesting that he wanted to be
free to contrive an accidental meeting with me.

I set a course for one of the several gates 4
from the courts we vere using, I could see that Oleg
had headed for the Same gate (this could have been
perfectly natural) and at a Speed Which after some
thirty yards would bring him to the gate at the same
moment as I (this was not entirely natural).

Since I had an excuse to greet him, having had
him pointed out in front of Pepe Pinto the preceding
week, I did so, I xakz2 said Good Morning and asked
if Kal were hore. He looked very pleased (I kthoughe
possibly relieved) when I took the initiative and

recognized hime i"

Oleg said that val had not arrived &s far as
he know, I said I had been training to get ready for
val. I wanted my revenge for last weeks i

. Oleg seomed amused: by this and immediately asked : :
4 1 would like to play with him sinco Val was not
here. I agreed. We found @ court and played for about ,

ona hour. Olgg won 6-3, 6-4.
Oleg is very athletic in appearance and. played

Oleg asked if I were with the Awerican Bubassy.
I answered"no, I have my own pusiness", It was then
that he asked if I. knoew another "BilL® who is in

2. S was advieed by phone from that the

was able to meet the Sov requirements concerning the platinum

s whioh enadies him to: purchase 10 ounces of platinum per month from the
Sov seller ( an export company ). According to the same phone message
the contract provides for a US3.00 commission per ounce.

3. S hopes to receive the contract before he meets with AEDIKFARD
on Sept 10 at 2000 hrs. On his own intiative S decided that he would
wont to show the contract to FERNALD before teking it to A. That was the
resson for arranging another mest with F before the scheduled meet with
A : :

he The gensrous commission provided for by the contract enables

8 to offer to A US$1.00 per ounce. Kven if the ainisum required by Sova

to 6 estimates, 5 anticipated that the purchases would go above the
required sinisun. B was taking in. consideration the possibility thet

A would not want to accept eny commipsion.ami Therefore, 5 came up wigh
@ scheme by whieh there would be a benk account for A and the money would

to hin Yooide when he wanted to uso it.

Ss. At thie point it say be mentioned that apart of the faet whether

6. _ In spite of the fact that at the tize of. this writing one can.

A would like to fsctlitate S to get the deal, because in that. case S would
be on one hand sorally obliged to him and on the other S would had
collected a nice eum of money. In turn thie would make A feel that he

vious. Other than reccurring to methods which are quite rarely used gainst
people ao 8, we in a situation of a very inconfortabie spectator left with
@ hope or @ which that A might go for the commission.

Te _ As far as §* willingness to give to A the attractive chunk of
money 18 concerned he is doing it for a double purpose: to please us
(indirect protectioa of his interest) and to protect his interest directly
by assuring A® willingness to help him in getting the deal.

8. Although, our situation is not plessent ( if tke deal ia to
materialize) we are not helpless onlookers.’ § mentioned that if it comes

to closing of the deal he will have to travel to Zurich, Switzerland, and
for that he needs a passport. How such § ie aware of our control positiion .
( dy enabling him to get a pessport faat or dragging ite granting) can be f
best illustrated by the fact that he told F that he would certainly put
aside s worthwhile sum for FP, Néedless to mention that F gave him a iteaxn

Nilly-willy P was obliged to turn weaknese into etregth and 8 understood
that he could as well forget stout the deal ( if it comes hie way ) if

he would not play it fair and equere with us. :
9. S brought up quite reasonably the question that A would most likely

a. LIREALN-1, folloving Station advice Seitacing the the recent | ion.
imeident where AEDIEHARD approached LIREALM=1 with an offer to pay LIREAHM- Shee
for any information he could obtain from tho U.S. Embassy, has evoided FeV Gyeh
contact with AEDIEHARD at the French Club. LIREALM-1's wife, an almost ‘1%,
daily vieitor to the Club, has been asked by LIREALM“L to note AEDIERARD's wr, wy
activities and associates and report anything. interesting to LIREALN-1. ia f a i

b. Mrs. LIREALM recently told LIREALM-1 that for a number of Mon aan)

[consecutive Satiprdays) AEDIEHARD had brought a young ledy, whom MRs LIREALM ee

thinks to be Getdan, to the Club ae his guest. Mrs. LIREALM did not attempt

to determine the identity of the femele, but reported the information to

her husband, She has noted no other items of interest in AEDIEHARD's

pattern ef attivities at the Club. He has not seemed to single out any we

individual as a tennis partner, nor ia be frequently seen socializing with 1a

anyone in particular while at the Club. ay ie by

2. LIREALM*1 was advised that the Station had learned that, AEDIEHARD etc

will not return to MHHARSH iomediategy aa originally thought, but he will W'qe!
‘probably remain in Mexico for another five-months. LIREALN-1 was told that

thia information was.tot yet public knowledge, but the Station would like

LIREALM=1 to confirm this if possible, This led to a general discussion of :
LIREALM#1"a, association with AEDIEHARD since the recent incident. LIREALM-1

was instructed that it was not the Station's wish that he avoid contact with
AEDIEHARD, but rather that he aot single out AEDIEHARD for special attention

or closely court his friendship, It ia fhe writer's opinion that a eufficient
time has elapsed. since the last incident for LIREALM-1 to again renew some
association with AEDIEHARD, and a particiilerly opportune chance to do so 1s
available: LIREALM-1 end AEDIEHARD both belong (as has previousiy been reported)
to a group of teanis enthystasts at the Club who take turns entertaining each
other in their howes, To date, all the members of this group hawe given parties
except LIREALM-1. Mrs, LIREALM, following theincident and thinking that AEDIEHARD
was soon to depart, has stated that she id not want to have AZDIERARD in her

hoae since he represents a governsent 90 opposed to the principles of her govern~
ment, etc. Based oa AEDIERARD's extension in Mexico and the fact that the LIREALM's
ove their friends a party, LIREALM was inetructed to plan a party for the group
and to include AEDIEHARD and his wife in the group invited. At the party,
LIREALM-1 should not focus an undue acount of attention on AEDIENARD, but should
take advantage of the opportunity to renew their goneral friendship and let the
matter, sore or less, take its own head from there. Ae a firet step in this
general direction, LIREALM"1 plans to go to the Club over the weokénd of 6-7

the club and frequently takes pictures of his wife and thelr friends, Under

various countries in the past five years. :

2. In INBREED's reply to our query, they stated that in the
periodic "Das Beste" there was an extract from the Reader's Digest
of 1 January 1972,.of 4 bool\atitled "Moscow's Attack on Mexico" by
John Barron, From this article it was learned that ‘the KGB cfficer

. LOGINOV met secretly with Mexican students at the timo of the
student demonstrations in Mexico in 1968; In March 1971, when
five Soviet officials were PNG'd from Mexico, it was believed that
Valentin Sergeyevich LOGINOV was among those ousted.

“, 1. Porwarded herewith is Bruce E. FERNALD's Progress report
on LIBACOH-1, covering the pericd 30 January to 15 August 1969,

3, As FERNALD’s report indicates, steady pregress has been
wade in developing LIBACGN-1 into a responsive agent. LIBACON-l's
credentials viseaevia tha Sovieta ara excellent, acd ke is learning
to use these credentisla to the Station's benefit. He was
reluctant at first, possibly because he did not want to do the sane
thing for RVROCK that Ae refused to do for AESICK. Patient handling
by FERNALD seens to ‘have overcoue this reluctance, and LIBACON-2
Row respords. vell to direction.

3. Bo far, thore seens to be no reason to suspect the sincerity
of LIBACOHel's relationship with RVPOCK. He developed strong
Porsonal affection. and prefessiesal respect for both KARTASUK and
FERNALD, aud his turnover to Douglas F, DITMANSON ‘on 14 August 1969
represents an effort to strengthen the emotional attachment, which
seons to be so important to hia, by providing him with a case
officer. vho speaks his native tongue, And, although LIBACGH-l'a
private life is a sess, we willwtch closely to sea that this does
got cauge any groater problem than cecasional missed meetings and.

delays 1a conpictisg asejgnzents.
4.. In the pext phase of LIBACON-1ts activity, wo expect to
concentrate on tuo things: i

B. Strengthening the tics with AEDIEHARD (there have beon
ingications that AXDIEHARD's ‘tour may not bo ending shortly
after all, in which case he will remain a prise Station target).

Acting Chief ot Btation, Bexico City.

G6, LIBACON-1's initial attitude was that he
or moreaccurately, to.assist us in our work against AEKICK, but he
was deternined to keep hinself away frem everybody and everything
associated with AEKICK, Pe did net seo AEDIEHARD for ‘anre than
four .onths, and whea they met accidentally in a resort, LIBACON=1
vas decistvuly ‘turning down everytt.ing AEDIEHARD asked for, He
at wc fm~.ae to accept a lunctecs appointment with AEDIEHARD, and

vent x gay before it was to take piace he postponed it indefinitely,

: SECRET

had agreed tc work,”



Sau

ECRET i

7. FERNALD succeeded in convincing LIBACON=1 that he should
Maintain social or friendly personal contact with AFDIENARD ‘and his.
dolléagues and that he could do it without either giving in to his

- or their-demands, or at the.other extreme, without saying no- to

everything they tiention or ask for,  LIBACON~-1 followed instructions
and went to AFDIEVARY's office to ask him why he had not. called

him for ten weckc, rhe result was that LIBACOX-1 had two luncheon
meetings with ALDIEHARD in July, and on August 8 LIBACON=1 and his

" wife were dinner guests of AEDIEHARD and ‘his wife at their apartment,

The ‘AEDIEWARDS agreed to come to LIBACON-1's place for a farewell

‘dinner in September and in the meanwhile LIBACON-1 and AEDIEHARD

will meet,for a luncheon on. August 29,

8. FERNALD insisted from tho beginning of his handling of
LIBACON=-1 that the latter prepare bio sketches on the SfiHARSHers
he know personally and on Spaniards who had lived in the USSR.
LIBACON-1 prepared bio sketches, which are actually personality
agsessuents, on AEDIENARD, IDENTITY A, IDENTITY B, IDENTITY C, and
IDENTITY D. The latter two reports showed that he would also report
on two Spaniards who are close friends of his, ia spite of his
earlier con ivas, Further, FERNALD instructed LIBACON~1 to contact
2 good friend of hi 5 (IDENTITY E) when the larte: returned from a
djonger trip to Czechoslovakia, LIBACON~-1 carvicd out the assignment
well and reported (orally) about IDSNTITY S's observations, impressions
and conélusions concerning what ho sev aw! heard during his stry it,
bib country, IDENTITY E is also 2 good personal friend ot LIBACON-?.

>. From the aboye it can be seen that LIBACON-1 has developoa
inte 4 person who has confidence in us, and. he bauaetechad without
reservation that we know what we are doing. i:

10, In analyzing. LIBACON-1's written reports it can easily
be soen that LIBACON-1 takes his assignments seriously and when he
makes a statement about a person he is scrupulous about drawing
enly ‘that conclusion which can be corroborated with facts. UIBACCN=1
it equally vious and reliable. when he reports about his nestitge |
sty AEDIEUArD: He first. reports the course of the aectiig and
reports AELJCIARD's statements..vorbatim, as much as pissibly, Then,
he uses b*~ srea knowledge and the knowledge of the person to relay,
the actr.al meaning of the statements, FERNALD not only believes.
that LIBACON-1's reporting. is reliable, but he also feels that ore
can deperd or, LIBACON-1 to use his knowledge of the area and people
to sepa.a.e the appearance and verbiage from the facts, be they

gocd cr vid.

cto An assessment of the moral and political reliability of
LIBACON-1, from the point.cf view of his work and activity on our
behalf .-can only be favorable, Thy same cannot be said when ore
views his p.rec.al life. In this field ho has many problems, which,
gouerw)v cyenying, are a result cr the fact that while he is
intellectually mature (or at leas: adequately mature for bis age),

whon 1t comes to emotions he acts like a toon-ager., LIBACON-~1

is aware of this fact and he ascribes it to the fact that he grew
under conditions of regimentation and morat terror; and when he

found himself in a world in which people live free and -there are

no restrictions on personal activities, as long ar they do not
violate the laws of the country, he remained prsscssed by the desire
to enjoy this freedom, Fortunately, hi:. personal {mmaturity :
affects his work for us only to the extent that he occasionally

-may. not complete an assessnent;, but when he doos do a job he does.

it very well. L

12, To conéludé: --Although LIBACON=-1 has his problens,
there are restricted to the area which does not affect his reliability,
dependability and loyalty to us and our cause, It is felt that
LIBACON-1. will be still more productive and easier developed when
handled by a case officer speaking Russian;i.e., the language of
his formative years,
