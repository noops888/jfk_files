intelligence which you stated was "an early and high
priority" in your letter of May 31, 1989? (2) To what extent
has political change in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe
diminished their intelligence threat in the 1990s and the
requirements for CI operations and security measures against
that threat? (3) To what extent do other traditional
threats, such as the PRC and Cube, require greater attention
in the 1990s? (4) What are the emerging threats in the 1990s
from third world and "friendly" intelligence services, as
well as narcotics traffickers and terrorists? (5) What new
challenges do technological advances and transfers to

Memorandum from J. H. Geer to The Director
Re: Senate Select Committee on Intelligence
Report on the FBI and CISPES (U)

FISA, includes domestic groups that are believed to be providing
personnel, training, funds, or other means for the commission of
terrorist acts abroad." This statement is an inaccurate
conclusion of law which we could see in the future as
determinative as to the intent of Congress in which activities
they choose to consider as under our counterterrorism program.
Footnote 89 acknowledges acceptance of the current definition of
terrorism as being the one favored by the FBI. The fact that
this particular definition is utilized in FISA, as well as in the
Attorney General Guidelines governing the conduct of the
intelligence aspect of our counterterrorism cases, is a quantum
leap from the conelusion that our investigative jurisdiction is
derived from the FISA. The definition utilized by FISA is
determinative only for jurisdiction of the FISC. (U)

A case in point are the requirements for subjects of
counterintelligence activity in FISA, which are more stringent
than the requirements of our counterintelligence guidelines for
subjects of a full counterintelligence investigation. In fact,
an entire class of cases, those involving targets of intelligence
activity, are omitted from the FISA. This in no way limits our
counterintelligence jurisdiction, only the ability to utilize
FISA in those particular cases. (S)

PURPOSE: To recommend the Director approve the briefing of

DETAILS: Attached is a request from Senator ALAN K. SIMPSON,

| Ranking Minority, Committee on the Judiciary, Subcommittee on
Immigration and Refugee Policy, for a briefing on September 7,

| 1989, at 10:00 a.m. concerning Soviet efforts to infiltrate

| illegals into the United States. As the FBI does not ordinarily
1 provide such classified information to other than the
intelligence oversight committees, CAO contacted SSCI staff to
inquire of Committee interest. Both GEORGE TENNET, Staff
Director, and JIM DYKSTRA, Minority Staff Director, expressed
interest on behalf of Chairman DAVID L. BOREN and Vice Chairman
WILLIAM S. COHEN. It is anticipated that either Chairman BOREN
or Vice Chairman COHEN would attend the proposed briefing along
with Senator SIMPSON. Mr. TENNET proposed that the FBI treat the
SIMPSON request as an SSCI request. If Chairman BOREN or Vice
Chairman COHEN cannot attend the briefing, Mr. TENNET and Mr.

i DYKSTRA will sit in on their behalf. 93

Immigration and Refugee Policy, and Steve Hooks of your agency,
concerning the growing numbers of immigrants, parolees, and
refugees from the Soviet Union entering the United States.

Aye we Apte2..

ene OE

I am writing to request a briefing from the Bureau on the
possibility of the Soviet Union infiltrating agents into the
flow of refugees and other emigres to the United States from
the Soviet Union.

It has been called to my attention by several sources that
the Soviet government might well be using our refugee program

for that purpose. 5 ae
-~ “2 3PS— / 7 4G
Legislation is currently pending in the Congress to
provide a presumption of refugee status to all members of
certain groups within the Soviet Union. The bill, if enacted,
would make a substantial number of Soviets presumptively
eligible for our refugee program, which gives rise to such
concerns about the infiltration of agents into that flow.

I would appreciate having the briefing after the August—-~—"
congressional recess. If 10 a.m., September 7th, is
acceptable, that would be a good time for me. NOV 6 1989

Mr. Day has a top secret clearance and will be avaiable noosa.
during the August recess to help arrange the briefing.

I appreciate your consideration of this request.

Most sincerely,

United States Senator

appear below, introduced by the appropriate page, paragraph,
sentence and line numbers of the draft; the sentence or sentences

"Upon returning in 1985, Conrad attempted to continue his
espionage operation through active duty personnel.

Conrad was arrested as a result of a long term Army CI
operation to determine the source of an apparent compromise of
U.S. Army, Europe, and NATO warplans. ‘The operation led to the
identification of Clyde Lee Conrad as the source of the
compromise. Leads to possible additional suspects are being
pursued in the U.S. and abroad.

In April l9e7 Army CI investigation mounted an.
undercover operation using an active duty Army source who knew
Conrad. Under Army CI control, the source recontacted Conrad and
eventually passed him approved "feed" material, for which Conrad
paid $15,000. -

In June 1988 the West German Government was informed of
the developments in the Conrad case, accepted criminal 5
jurisdiction, and arrested Conrad. They found extensive
materials providing further evidence and leads, including a
computer on which Conrad kept records of his activities. Conrad.
is accused of selling NATO plans to Hungarian intelligence Cah
will be tried by the West Germans for state treason. If
convicted, he faces a possible maximum sentence of 15 years in
prison.

In August 1988 the Kercsik brothers, two Hungarians who
were the alleged couriers for Conrad to the Hungarian
intelligence services, were arrested by Sw2dish authorities. on
October 18, 1988 Swedish authorities sentenced the Kercsik
brothers to one and one-half years in prison. The Kercsiks were
released from prison on May 23, 1987."

the 'Soviets' classified documents, and signed a receipt for
money."

Upon confrontation by FBI agents, Dolce admitted
providing the South Africans with classified documents. In
exchange for his agreement to cooperate during his debriefing,
Dolce was charged with only one count of espionage. In April
1989 Dolce was sentenced to a maximum prison term of 10 years,
and was fined $5,000."

“While serving as a radioman in the Navy, Henry Otto Spade stole
classified information, including a crypto keycard, Top Secret
operational plans and a change of code words for all current
fleet operations. Spade mailed and hand-carried these materials
to his home and, after his discharge, told a cooperating witness
that he could make a lot of money selling them. The cooperating
witness reported this to the FBI. Spade was indicted for
unauthorized possession of classified material, and all of the
material is believed to have been recovered. The FBI does not
believe that Spade actually compromised any classified material.

On March 13, 1989 Spade was sentenced to three months
probation and charged $50 for court costs. The Federal judge
ignored sentencing guidelines as he felt that his were merely the
actions of a stupid young man."

11. Technology Transfer section, Recommendation 33, no
page number indicated:

The FBI disagrees with this recommendation. The FBI is
statutorily Limited in its investigations of technology transfer.
The FBI's main priority in technology transfer investigations is
foreign counterintelligence, as the FBI has the primary
responsibility of countering hostile intelligence services
activities and collection efforts in the United States. ‘he FBI
only becomes involved in an investigation regarding technology
transfer when a hostile intelligence service is involved or the
technology in question is classified. There must be specific and
articulable facts that a hostile intelligence service or a
criteria country is involved in some phase of technology
transfer. Until one of these criteria is met, the primary
investigative responsibility for violations of the export control
laws remains with the U.S. Customs Service and the U.S.
Department of Commerce,

PURPOSE: To recommend a briefing be provided on the captioned
matter.

DETAILS: Attached is a note concerning the proposed increase in
the ceiling of U.S. foreign service officers in the Soviet Union.
As is detailed in the note, the Department of Stateg (DOS)
recently justified the need for an increase of foreign service
representatives in the USSR to SSCI staff. On May 19, 1989, JOHN
ELLIFF requested a briefing by the FBI on the impact a reciprocal
increase of Soviet officials in the United States will have on
counterintelligence. On May 22, 1989, KEITH HALL, Budget
Director, SSCI, advised the request_is on behalf of the Committee
with the knowledge of the Chairman.

The DOS briefing was provided by JOHN EVANS, Deputy
Director, Soviet Desk, to 10 SSCI staff members. CAO recommends
an FBI representative from CI-l1 provide the FBI briefing.
Although Mr. ELLIFF requested a representative from WMFO attend
the briefing, CAO recommends against that request.
—

The proposed briefing will not require the FBI to
evaluate the DOS need for a ceiling increase or make any
counterproposal. Only the facts should be presented as they
relate the response to address the increase. Potential resource
needs rising from the possible reopening of the New York City

Memorandum to Director, FBI

the first briefing. A large portion of the Director's briefing book
will consist of materials prepared for the House Permanent Select
Committee on Intelligence (HPSCI) hearing which occurred on March 9,
1989. Additional requirements are set out below:

1. ISSUE: Although zero is expected for counterintelligence in the
1990s, there will be additional requirements placed on the FBI by the
growing numbers of criteria country nationals present in the United
States and increasing immigrants from the Soviet Union, Cuba, etc.

QUESTION: A. How will the FBI address the increased presence of
criteria country nationals in the United States in the 1990s?

B. There is a proposal by the Administration for $100,000,000 to help
relocate Soviet emigres in the United States. Does the FBI desire a
portion of this funding to address this immigration? What resources
are needed to address this increased immigration?

Cc. How will the FBI get greater productivity from available resources
in the 1990s?

The Intelligence Divison (INTD) should prepare a response.

2. ISSUE: A National Academy on Public Administration report
recently recommended the FBI be exempted from the pay classification
requirements of Title 5, United States Code. It is presumed by the
SSCI that the FBI would need additional resources to implement the
flexibility this proposal would allow but that such resources may not
be available in the 1990s.

QUESTION: If the FBI had the flexibility recommended by NAPA, how
could it currently be utilized without additional resources? (The
answer should discuss the current pay scale that forces the FBI to
contract for engineering services as it is unable to hire engineers.)

The Adminstrative Service Division (ASD) should respond with input

from CI 3-D and the Engineering Section, Technical Services Division
(TSD).

3. ISSUE: The FBI is requesting 55 work years for its Security
Programs in FY 1990 although in FY 1988 131 work years were expended
and in FY 1987 in excess of 100 work years were expended.

QUESTION: A. Why is the request so much lower than the actual number
of hours TURKed?

B. Is the field burning too many hours for the Security Programs?

i NW 65360 Docld:32989599 Page 32



Memorandum to Director, FBI

c. Are the additional hours utilized for Security Programs coming
from man years intended for counterintelligence investigations?

D. What is the position of the FBI in moving the Security Programs
from the Records Management Division (RMD) to the INTD?

RMD should respond.

4. ISSUE: For the past 2 years the SSCI has requested the Domestic
Terrorism Program justification be submitted simultaneously with the
National Foreign Intelligence Program (NFIP) budget request.

QUESTION: Would the FBI object to including the Domestic Terrorism
justification in the NFIP budget?

Criminal Investigative Division should respond.

5. ISSUE: The SSCI seems reluctant to support the FBI's current
request for access to Social Security account records and past
requests for access to taxpayer records in counterintelligence cases
and has suggested we work cases jointly with the Internal Revenue
Service to get taxpayer information.

QUESTION: A. Does the FBI conduct joint investigations with the
Internal Revenue Service?

B. Would the FBI object to increasing its joint investigations with
the Internal Revenue Service to gain access to taxpayer information,
and if so, why?

INTD should respond.

6. ISSUE: The HPSCI and the SSCI support the expansion of the New
York Demonstration Project to include all New York Office support
employees. There is concern by the committees that amending the
Demonstration Project legislation passed in 1988 might jeopardize the
current project as members of Congress from other high cost areas
might attempt to include other FBI offices in the Project without
providing the FBI with increased resources to fund the participation
by those offices.

QUESTION: A. How serious is the New York Office support problem in
terms of turnover, vacancies, moral, etc?

The ASD should respond with input from the New York Office.

7. ISSUE: The Director's opening statement before HPSCI pointed out

that the Interagency Group on Counterintelligence (IG-CI) was a very

important entity. It is proposed that the National Advisory Group on
Counterintelligence (NAG-CI) will replace IG-CI.

Memorandum to Director, FBI

QUESTION: A. What is the current status of the NAG-CI? -

B. What Agencies will be represented in the NAG-CI?

Cc. How important will the NAG-CI be?

The INTD should prepare a response.

8. ISSUE: The SSCI has followed the FBI's POWERCURVE investigation
and is interested in the FBI's findings.

QUESTION: What is the outcome of the FBI's investigation into the
security leaks of the Moscow Embassy?

INTD should prepare a response.

9. QUESTION: A. What is the status of the Conrad case?

B. How many people have been implicated in the Conrad Case?

The INTD should prepare a response.

10. ISSUE: The Congressional Budget Justification Book (CBJB)
indicates a reduction in the number of double agent cases conducted

in 1988.

QUESTION: A. Why has there been a reduction in the number of doublé
agent cases?

B. Is the FBI conducting fewer double agent cases but cases of better
quality?

The INTD should prepare a response.
ll. ISSUE: There is concern by the SSCI that the FBI is less capable
in conducting analysis than other intelligence agencies.

QUESTION: A. How many analysts (Special Support) are there at FBI
Headquarters? In the Field?

B. How do these numbers compare to the number of analytical positions
available 5 years ago?

Cc. Could the FBI use more analysts?

The INTD should prepare a response.



Memornadum to Director, FBI

12, ISSUE: The Committee believes the FBI does not share all
information contain in its files with other members of the
intelligence community when asked and that a centralized file would
ensure full information is available to all intelligence agencies.

QUESTION: What are the advantages and disadvantages of a single
database for CIA, FBI, and DOD?

RECOMMENDATIONS: 1. That the INTD, ASD, CID, and RMD prepare
responses for the questions identified above and submit those
questions to the Congressional Affairs Office by close of business
April 5, 1989 in the format currently in use classified as appro-
riate with a heading for issue, question, summary response, details,
and approval signed by the appropriate Assistant Director or Deputy
Assistant Director and date signed.

Memorandum to 0. B. Revell from Milt Ahlerich

RE: FBI RELATIONS WITH THE SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE
ON INTELLIGENCE (SSCI) AND THE HOUSE PERMANENT
SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE (HPSCI)

Requests will be accepted only if the staff member
certifies the request is on behalf of and with the knowledge of
the Chairman. On a case by case basis, whenever deemed
appropriate by the Chief Counsel of the Congressional Affairs
Office, certain of these requests will be required to be
presented in writing signed by the Committee Chairman. Requests
for visits to FBI field offices, those that appear to be clearly
politically motivated, or those concerning FBI investigations
where the Privacy Act would prohibit the release of information
but for the Congressional Committee exception would fall into
this category. CAO may continue to initiate briefings whenever
CAO and the concerned FBI Headquarters Division deem the briefing
is in the interest of the FBI.

For all other congressional committees, a written
request signed by the respective committee Chairman will be
required for briefings.

RECOMMENDATIONS: None. For information only.

SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE. ONIN
STAFF TO THE WASHINGTON METROPOLITAN FIELD OFFICE (WMFO)

PURPOSE: To recommend WMFO host SSCI staff on 11/18/88.

DETAILS: On 11/1/88, John T. Eliff, Professional Staff Member,
SSCI, advised that he; James H. Dykstra, Minority Staff
Director; Britt L. Snider, Minority Counsel; Edward P. Levine,
Professional Staff; and Charles Battaglia, Professional Staff,
wish to visit WMFO on 11/18/88. Mr. Eliff was reminded that a
letter from the Chairman would be required for a field office
visit and advised that a letter would be produced. The visit
to WMFO was briefly discussed during a 10/26/88 meeting at

FBI Headquarters concerning an update the SSCI is preparing of
a 1986 study entitled "Meeting the Espionage Challenge: A
Review of United States Counterintelligence and Security
Programs" and will be used to gather information for that
update. In that regard, Mr. Eliff requested that an
Intelligence Division (INTD) official in a policy making,
position accompany the SSCI Staff during the visit. CAO" agrees
that, given the subject matter, this is a reasonable request

and is in the interest of the FBI.

On 11/2/88, SSA Monty C. Strait, CAO, and John 8S.
Hooks, Jr., CAO, met with Messrs Eliff, Snider and Dykstra to
develop issues for the visit at WMFO. Those items are set out
below. CAO notes that SSCI requests to visit offsite
operations will likely be impossible given time constraints.

Provide an explanation of WMFO's organization for
both counterintelligence and criminal investigative
matters. An organizational chart would be helpful

to demonstrate how resources are deployed.

Memorandum from M. Ahlerich to Mr. Geer

Re:

Visit of Senate Select Committee in Intelligene (SSCI)
Staff to the Washington Metropolitan Field Office (WFMO)

and the SSA's should be available to meet with SSCI
staff. Data on the number of establishments covered
by WMFO should be available. A map identifying their
locations would be helpful.

Provide an estimate of the approximate number of known
intelligence officiers and suspected intelligence
officiers under investigation. Provide detail on the
number of Look-Out sites currently in use. Provide
data on the total number of offsites in use by WMFO.
Provide details of additional resources needed to
maintain the attack on the hostile foreign intelligence
presence in the WMFO territory. SSCI Staff has
expressed an interest in visiting a Look-Out if time
permits. Staff members visited a Look-Out in New York
City in early 1988.

There is a proposal for an increase of 30 U.S.
diplomatic representatives assigned to the

United States Embassy in Moscow. If this proposal
is approved, the USSR might ask for reciprical
treatment. If 30 additional Soviet officials were
posted in the WMFO territory, how would it impact on
WMFO's counterintelligence missions?

FISA-Prepare to discuss how decisions are made to
conduct electronic surveillance of an establishment
or a subject, including Bureau policy as it differs
from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, and
necessary paper work to implement coverage. Provide an
update on Double Dagger and a tour of the monitoring
plant. Explain any problem with utility service that
impacts on the electronic surveillance efforts staged

by WMFO. Discuss cooperation with the National

Security Agency and National Security Agency

facilities. Discuss minimumization-prepare to answer
questions that might be posed: What happens if a

Senator calls the USSR Ambassador? Describe the
investigative processes taken if a Senate Staff

member calls a known Intelligence Officer and holds

a conversation that stimulates FBI investigative

interest. Discuss any needs for additional language
specialists.

Memorandum from M. Ahlerich to Mr. Geer
Re: Visit of Senate Select Committee in Intelligence (SSCI)
Staff to the Washington Metropolitan Field Office (WFMO)

Physical Surveillance-Discuss the utilization of
SSG. If time permits, Committee staff would like
to speak with SSG as they did in New York in early
1988, How are FCI cases prioritized to determine
SSG deployment? Has the TSD Engineering Section
provided new technology assisting in Physical
Surveillance, example grid, satellite systems,

or other techniques.

Terrorism-Counterterrorism squad supervisors,
ASAC John M. Kelso, and ASAC David W. Johnson
should be available, if possible, meet with

SSCI Staff. They should explain the difference
in the investigative efforts of the two
counterterrorism squads. They should prepare to
discuss the use of the Hostage Rescue Team in
terrorist matters.

The Congressional Affairs Office has scheduled the WMFO
Meeting to begin at 10 a.m. If desired, this time could be moved
to 8:30 a.m.

WMFO should plan time for lunch. The cafeteria in the
building will be suitable.

Some SSCI Staff members visited the New York Office and
the San Francisco Office in early 1988. During those visits, time
was available for SSCI Staff to have an informal discussion with a
small number of office managers and with a small number of case
Agents after regular business hours. The SSCI valued those
opportunities and inquired if a similar setting could be used to
complete the WMFO meeting. This communication makes no
recommendation in this regard other than to note that such contact
did create good will between the Committee staff and the Bureau.

Dear Director Sessions:

As part of our current review of counterintelligence
programs, we are looking at the challenges and opportunities
confronting the FBI. For this purpose, we believe it would be
valuable for our staff to visit FBI field offices, beginning
with the Washington Metropolitan Field Office which plays an
important role in the national counterintelligence effort.
Such visits have helped in the past to identify ways of
strengthening FBI capabilities. We would appreciate your
making appropriate arrangements for an oversight visit to the
Washington office by Committee staff members Jim Dykstra,
Britt Snider, Ed Levine, Charles Battaglia, and John Elliff on
Friday, November 18, 1988.

We are grateful for the assistance of FBI headquarters
and field personnel in preparing for this visit.

Sincerely.

Honorable William Sessions

Dear Director Sessions:

The Senate Select Committee on Intelligence is
conducting a comprehensive review of U.S. counterintelligence
and security programs and capabilities. Included in this
review will be Executive branch efforts to stem the flow of
sensitive technology and equipment to foreign governments.

Recent press reporting has alleged that such transfers
have been made by the military offices of Egypt and Israel.
Accordingly, I request that the FBI brief the Committee staff
on any unauthorized transfer of technology and equipment from
the United States by the Egyptians and by the Israelis. For
the latter, we are particularly interested in any role played
in these transfers by the Israeli Defense Procurement Mission
and Trade Center in.New York.

Memorandum from M. V. Hale to Mr. S. M. McWeeney

Re: Senate Select Committee on , Intelligence (SSCI)
Request to Discuss the Office of Liaison and
International Affairs (OLIA) and the
Counterintelligence Situation in West Berlin

DETAILS:

Mr. Hale opened the session, advising Mr. Eliff that, on
his recent trip to Western Europe to visit certain U. Ss.
Embassies and establishments, including the U. S. Mission in
West Berlin, where Legal Attaches were desired and needed, he had
conferred with appropriate U. S. military, U. S. Department of
State (USDS) and Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) personnel in
order to present the FBI's case for representation in
West Berlin. During these discussions, Mr. Hale was advised that
staff members of the SSCI had recently visited West Berlin
concerning counterintelligence issues and Mr. Hale, in that
context, wished to brief Mr. Eliff regarding the FBI's
perspectives on opening a Legal Attache, particularly from a
counterintelligence point of view.

Mr. Eliff stated that although he had not recently
visited West Berlin, he was intimately familiar with the
intricacies of the counterintelligence atmosphere in West Berlin
and supported the FBI's presence there. He indicated he was well
aware of the gap which existed in the counterintelligence
coverage of U. S. civilians, both students and businessmen in
that neither the U. S. military nor the U. S. civilian
intelligence intelligence components were addressing the threat
to these individuals and this for two reasons.

The first involved the basic functions of the U. S.
intelligence components in West Berlin, a function he described
as being the collection of positive intelligence as opposed to

counterintelligence, the latter being at best a secondary
requirement.

Memorandum from M. V. Hale to Mr. S. M. McWeeney

Re: Senate Select Committee on Intelligence (SSCT)
Request to Discuss the Office of Liaison and
International Affairs (OLIA) and the
Counterintelligence Situation in West Berlin

DETAILS CONTINUED:

The second reason for this gap involves the legal
guidelines under which the U. S. military, by virtue of their
authority of an occupying power in West Berlin, conducts
technical surveillance and mail openings. Mr. Eliff stated that,
as an occupying power, the U. S. military, much like the FBI
domestically, is the entity which conducts telephone monitorings
of criteria country establishments and personnel in the U. S.
sector of West Berlin. It also opens certain mail of interest
from the East which passes through this sector. However,
whenever there is an overhear of a U. S. national or whenever
there is mention made of a U. S. national in a piece of
correspondence, that U. S. national's name is not disseminated to
any other U. S. intelligence agency. This lack of dissemination
is as a result of a lawsuit in the early 1970s against the U. Ss.
Army which, at that time, had in fact been monitoring the
activities of U. S. nationals. As a consequence of this lawsuit,
very stringent guidelines were written which compelled the U. s.
military to use the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court to
monitor Americans including stringent guidelines for minimizing
overhears of U. S. nationals when monitoring non U. S. nationals.

The net results of these restrictions is that, according
to Mr. Eliff, 15 years worth of overhears of U. S. nationals as
well as the like potential collection of names of U. S. persons
via mail openings has been lost.

Mr. Eliff advised it was his belief these minimization
restrictions were too stringent and should be amended to allow
for dissemination. He however stated that he thought the issue
should be brought up after the upcoming elections in that he did
not believe a "lame duck" administration would be interested in
undertaking the issue.

Memorandum from M. V. Hale to Mr, S. M. McWeeney

Re: Senate Select Committee on: Intelligence (SSCI)
Request to Discuss the Office of Liaison and
International Affairs (OLIA) and the
Counterintelligence Situation in West Berlin

DETAILS CONTINUED:

As an aside, Mr. Eliff indicated that Allan Kornblum,
Office of Intelligence Policy and Review, Department of Justice,
had visited West Berlin on two occasions and was conversant with
this U. S. military monitoring issue.

Mr. Eliff also stated that he further supported an FBI
presence in West Berlin in that his study of the
counterintelligence venue in that city indicated to him that the
many double agent cases run by the U. S. military there were run
for parochial reasons with no strategic view of
counterintelligence. He stated that even though the U. Ss.
military services were professional and did coordinate the
turnover of some of their many double agents to the FBI when
these agents are rotated back to domestic assignment, he believed
the FBI should have input at the outset of these double agent
cases insofar as the double agent technique was a fundamental
counterintelligence tool which demanded consultation with the
principle counterintelligence service, the FBI, at their
inception in order to better globally address counterintelligence
issues.

He stated he believed FBI presence in West Berlin would
therefore be necessary if the U. S. were to have a coherent
national counterintelligence strategy.

Mr. Eliff concluded by reiterating his support for the
FBI's presence in West Berlin, by indicating that he would be
willing, were we to ask, to indicate his support of this position
to the USDS, the U. S. military and the CIA as well as Mr. Jeff
Smith, Chief Staffer for Senator Sam Nunn, the latter also well
versed in counterintelligence issues and a potential strong
supporter of the FBI's cause.

Messrs L'Allier, Hooks, and Hale thanked Mr. Eliff for
his time and indicated that the FBI had designated a new
assistant Legal Attache in Bonn whose function would largely be
to travel weekly to West Berlin in order to prepare the FBI's
case for a permanent presence there.

Memorandum R. L. Leffler to Mr. E. J. O'Malley

Re: Senate Select Committee on Intelligence (SSCI) Staff
Request for Briefing Concerning the Marine Resources
Company Joint Fishing Venture

Mr. Butterworth requested a briefing on the counter-
intelligence implications of a proposal made to Senator Jackson
by Bellingham Cold Storage Company, Seattle, Washington, to
establish a servicing and dry dock repair facility in
Bellingham, Washington, for Soviet fishing vessels. The
vessels would dock for repair for a two to four-week period
and would be accompanied by a maintenance crew of 25 to 50
Soviets. These maintenance crews would live on the ships
being repaired, would be allowed free access to the port
community and would be rotated back to the Soviet Union
every six months. (U)

I advised Mr. Butterworth that this proposal was
similar to one made in 1979 by Bellingham and that the FBI
had recommended against implementation at that time because
it represented potential for significant intelligence
exploitation by the Soviet intelligence services. Moreover,
it would constitute a major drain on our investigative resources
which would be required to effectively monitor Soviet activity
in and around Bellingham. Our reasoning was based on the fact
that there were major sensitive defense installations in the
area and that Soviet intelligence personnel, fully capable
of mounting HUMINT gathering operations, undoubtedly would
be assigned to the semipermanent Soviet complement. It was
also speculated that the Soviets would eventually require
some type of permanent shore facilities which would add to
the coverage problem.

It was further explained to Mr. .Butterworth that
insofar as repair work on the Soviet vessels by U.S. persons
was concerned, it would probably be limited to the exterior
of the ships, with any interior work being done by the Soviets
in order to protect sensitive SIGINT gathering equipment
known to be aboard at least some of these vessels. Hence the
need for such a relatively large Soviet "maintenance crew." (G+

Mr. Butterworth was told that from the FBI's view-
point nothing has occurred since we last studied this matter
that would alter our recommendation against the implementation
of this proposal.for counterintelligence reasons.

Briefing provided by Acting Section Chief Rodney L.

Leffler and was attended by Margaret Owens, Congressional
Affairs Section. (U)

_COMPANY JOINT FISHING VENTURE —_-

ti Ul hy Director's Secty —

PURPOSE: To advise of the above,

DETAILS: On 1/26/83, Mr. Bob Butterworth, Senator
Jackson's designee on the SSCI, telephoned Congressional
Affairs Section and requested a briefing concerning

a proposal by Bellingham Cold Storage Company, a Seattle,
Oregon business which is part of the Marine Resources Company
Joint Fishing Venture, The proposal relates to establishing

a vessel repair operation for Soviet fishing vessels in the
North Pacific. It is expected that these vessels will dock

at Bellingham, Washington, (or as an alternative, in Coosbay,
Oregan) for 2 to 4 weeks for repairs. The crew of the vessels
will return to the Soviet Union but a Soviet maintenance group
of 25 to 50 individuals would remain to supervise the work. ~
These individuals would live on the vessels but would be free
to visit the port community. These maintenance crews would
be rotated back to the Soviet Union every 6 months,

ORIGINAL FILED in /6$ -300 7.23 Lg

Senator Jackson has been advised of the economic
benefits to the community but is concerned that there may
be some counterintelligence problems with this arrangement.
Therefore he has asked Mr. Butterworth to discuss this matter
with the FBI, (Mr. Butterworth received a’briefing on Soviet
shipping at headquarters and at the Seattle field office
in December 1981 and January 1982 respectively).

This request was discussed with Deputy Assistant
Director Phil Parker and SA Rodney Leffler on 1/27/83.

Dear Judge Webster:

Thank you for your letter of 7 December replying to our
questions raised at our Committee's counterintelligence brief-
ing on 28 October.

We hope you will amplify your response considerably so
that we can understand as clearly as possible the threat fac-
ing us and the protective responses we should be developing.
We understand that, in some instances, appropriate corrective
action must be taken by agencies and departments outside the
intelligence community. We on this Committee are interested
in helping to affect such changes, but to do so effectively
we need complete and actual information.

+ In this spirit, we hope you can provide, by 25 January

oY 1982, fuller and more detailed responses to our questions pro-

~SIviding, at a minimum, more information on the following topics:

in obtaining foreign counterintelligence or counterterrorism
intelligence concerning such operations?

~®he FBI’s Intelligence.Division investigates. foreign

counterintelligence regarding hostile intelligence services within
the United States. The FBI's Criminal Investigative Division
investigates and collects counterterrorism intelligence. When
these two areas overlap, coordination between the two divisions

35. How do intelligence and FBI domestic terrorism efforts
relate to the efforts of the military services to prepare for

terrorist incidents?
FBIHQ maintains close liaison with all branches of the

Inited “States.military. “The “FBI ‘provides “the military ‘authorities

all pertinent information developed concerning any terrorist

activity directed against or affecting military bases, personnel

or resources. wy

NW 65360 Docld:32989599 Page 85 _



36. Unlike the Bureau's FCI guidelines, its domestic

security guidelines for domestic terrorism investigations have

not been revised significantly since 1976. Should they be reexamined
in light of any specific problems that have arisen over the past

five years?

Although .it is believed that .the Guidelines have. enable:
the FBI to cope with the domestic terrorist problem in an effective
a manner, the Guidelines limit the use of one of the most effective

investigative techniques at our disposal. The Guidelines forbid

the FBI to develop and direct the activities of an informant
against an individual or group unless that individual or group is
currently the subject of a full domestic security .investigation.
“Thus, we: cannot continue ‘to operate an informant in a group

once that group's activities fail to meet the criteria for a

full investigation. This prevents us from obtaining valuable

information regarding the group's possible decision to return to
or instigate violent actions prior to these actions taking place.
This prohibition has also created an obvious lack of intelligence

data to assess the terrorist threat. In view of this, a re-examination

of the domestic guidelines as well as all guidelines should be

undertaken on a periodic basis. WO)

(a) What special training is provided in the terrorism field?

seminars on terrorism. All the above-mentioned training is provided

to all interested Federal, state, and local law enforcement

recent and current practices for review and approval of full

Initially, the Justice Department is notified that a
*-full-domestic security investigation has been authorized. After
a 90 day period, the FBI field office is required to submit a 90 day
report on the progress of the investigation. This is forwarded to

Memorandum from Mr. E. J. O'Malley to The Director
Re: Director's Appearance Before

Senate Select Committee on

Intelligence, March 25, 1981

SYNOPSIS:

On March 2, 1981, a preparatory meeting was held at Central
Intelligence Agency (CIA) Headquarters chaired by Admiral Showers of
the Director of Central Intelligence (DCI) Staff and attended by representatives
of CIA, Department of Defense (DOD), Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA),
and the FBI, The purpose of this meeting was to block the time necessary
for each agency head to make a statement and answer questions. The
enclosed questions were handed out and each agency present is to draft
answers and submit them to CIA for distribution to all participating agencies.

Another meeting on the same matter was held on March 3, 1981,
with Staff members of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence to
discuss the Director’s March 25th appearance before that Committee.

In the past, intelligence community members responsible for
counterintelligence were afforded individual appearances. This year all
such members will appear jointly allowing cross commenting and questioning.
This is a marked change and a departure from the notion that each agency
in turn would appear and answer questions for a limited time.

The emphasis in questioning will be the Committee's perception of
a lack of strategic planning within the community from a multi-disciplinary
counterintelligence view. :

Specific questions asked the Director will center on Bureau strategic
planning and the role of foreign threat assessment in this planning.

Opening remarks are expected to specifically justify resource
requests through concrete appraisals of hostile intelligence service threat.

It appears that the thrust of these changes is to force the Intelligence
Community to establish mechanisms for threat assessment and strategic
planning below the White House level where they will fall under Congressional
oversight. :

Memorandum from Mr. E, J. O'Malley to The Director
Re: Director's Appearance Before

Senate Select Committee on

Intelligence, March 25, 1981

RECOMMENDATION:

That Intelligence Division prepare an appropriate briefing book
for the Director.

i
“hi

DETAILS:

Three Staff members of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence
met with representatives of the Intelligence Division on March 3, 1981. The
purpose of this meeting was to discuss the scheduled March 25, 1981,
appearance of the Director before that Committee.

In the past, members of the Intelligence Community have been afforded
itidividual appearances before the Senate Select Committee. The March 25,
1981, meeting has been scheduled as a simultaneous appearance of all
Intelligence Community chiéfs having counterintelligence responsibilities.

It is the intent of the Committee that this be a joint appearance. That is,
while individual statements from each Intelligence Community chief will be
expected, questions may be directed to any member appearing, allowing
cross commenting on answers of other chiefs. This is a marked departure
from previous procedure.

The emphasis in questioning before the Committee this year will be
into who has overall responsibility for counterintelligence operations from
a multi-disciplinary view. How is the counterintelligence "puzzle" put
together, and how can the Committee augment the budgets of each Intelligence
Community member to increase the effectiveness of the total counterintelligence
effort.

e e

Memorandum from Mr. E. J. O'Malley to The Director
Re: Director's Appearance Before

Senate Select Committee on

Intelligence, March 25, 1981

DETAILS (Continued):

In line with these directions, questions can be expected to center on
FCI strategic planning, FBI strategic planning and the synthesis of the
multiple threats of foreign intelligence services into a coherent response.

Participants should additionally expect specific questions as to illegals
presence, numbers of foreign recruitments and their threat, war-time
contingencies, the utility of budgetary augmentations (what could be done with
an additional 10%), and changes in the law which might increase performance.

Participants have been requested to address, in their opening remarks,
the following three major areas pertaining to the area of inquiry being conducted
this year.

1. What is the mechanism within your organization for assessing the
overall hostile intelligence threat and how do established mechanisms in
your organization allocate resources to respond to that threat ?

2. What is that threat both quantitatively and qualitatively citing
concrete examples ?

3. What resources are needed by your organization to meet this
threat ?

It appears that the thrust of these changes is to force the Intelligence
Community to establish mechanisms for threat assessment and strategic
planning below the National Security Council level where they will be within
the Senate's oversight responsibilities. During this meeting, one Staff
member, Mr. John Elliff, stated that these matters were currently
"unaccountable" as they were done by the White House staff, implying that
the Committee wished to extend its oversight to the strategic planning
mechanisms.

has made counterintelligence e top FBI priority. Last year i
this Committee recommended thet the FBI move towards the

(39) Tnere is some evidence that particular agencies, such

covnterintelligence that the FBI needs to monitor possible
foreign intelligence threats to this country. This problem mey
be due to a fear of collecting and disseminating information|

authority they have under current guidelines. a

which has been forwarded to the Office of Management
and Budget for approval. She requested the FBI's
comments oh the proposed legislation.

The primary effect of the proposal would be

Memorandum to the Assistant Director
Criminal Investigative Division
Re: PROPOSED ELECTRONIC SURVEILLANCE LEGISLATION

The impetus for the first change came from the
FBI, which for several years has urged the Department to
formulate legislation to provide emergency wiretaps for
life endangering situations. The impetus for the second
change above has come from the domestic policy staff of
the White House in response to the recent Supreme Court
case United States v. Dalia, — U.S. | {April 18,
1979) a

The bill also requires prior notice, when
practicable, to the issuing magistrate for subsequent
entry under the same order to repair or replace the sur-
veillance device. When prior notice is not practicable,
notification to the authorizing judge should be made
within 48 hours after the re-entry (see page 30, Section
5Ig]f[iiil). Previous Congressional requests for prior
approval before the re-entry and for additional minimiza-
tion provisions have been dropped.

Bob McNamara of Senator Kennedy's staff is
anxious to introduce this legislation as a Kennedy bill
and has requested that it be submitted as soon as possible.
Accordingly, Ms. Warlow requested that Bureau views be
provided to the Department by Monday, 7/23/79. SA
Stearns has provided copies of this draft legislation to
Section Chiefs Douglas Gow and Shawn McWeeney of the
Criminal Investigative Division.

RECOMMENDATIONS :

1. That the Criminal Investigative Division
review the attached draft and advise SA Stearns, Legal
Counsel Division, regarding its impact upon Bureau
investigative operations.
