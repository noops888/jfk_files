The Chairman. The hearing will come to order.

I would like to ask Mr. Schwarz if he would give us a
{

brief synopsis of what we intend to question our witness
|

about this morning.

Mr. Schwarz. The witness this morning will only be a
single witness. He is Mr. Samuel Halpern. He was in the
Far East, and I have now found out he was involved in (ie
some alleged killing of an agent in
Tailand, which are collateral matters that we may want to
take up with him at the end.

But he came back here in the fall of 1961 and was in-
structed as assistant to get into the Cuban matter. And
he will testify that he was told that they would proceed
to overthrow the Castro government, and that there were no
holds barred.

He will then describe the way in|whch they worked
with the Special Group.

The Chairman. What was Halpern's |/position?

Mr. Schwarz. Halpern's position was as Executive
Assistant to Harvey. And Harvey, you will’ remember, was the
man that was actually in charge of the /Cuban position.

The Chairman. When are we going to get Harvey?

Mr. Schwarz. He is coming next |Wednesday morning.

We are going to get some of this|same conflict between

the no-holds-barred testimony, which in his mind I guess he

Mr. Schwarz. Who else was present at that meeting?

Mr. Halpern. He was my branch
chief. |

Mr. Schwarz. Is he alive today, or is he dead?

Mr. Halpern. He died last year.

Mr. Schwarz. Approximately when'in the fall of 1961
did that meeting take place?

Mr. Halpern. About the middle of October 1961.

Mr. Schwarz. What instructions were you given by Mr.
Bissell at tht meeting?

Mr. Halpern. Mr. Bissell said he had recently -- and
he didn't specificy the date or the time -- he had recently
been chewed out in the Cabinet Room of the White House by
borh the President and the Attorney General for, as he put
it, sitting on his ass and not doing ahything about getting
rid of Castro and the Castro regime. | His orders to both

QUEZZogBey} and to me were to plan for Lm operation to
accomplish that end.

Mr. Schwarz. Was any content put,;into the term
"get rid of", or was that the term that was used, and only
that term?

Mr. Halpern. To the best of my recollection, that was

it. There was no limitation of any kind. Nothing was for-

bidden, and nothing was withheld. And_jthe objective was to

Mr. Schwarz. And did you talkj about tactics at all
in that meeting, or was it just a general discussion about
getting organized. H
Mr. Halpern. Just a general discussion as to what we would

do, how we would proceed, and what we|would need. And at

that point I had no idea how many people were left on the stata

|
in the branch only having been on the Job a day or a day and

i H
a half. | |
Mr. Schwarz. Shorly after that time did you get put in

contact with a general?
i

Mr. Halpern. Yes, sir. General Lansdale.

Mr. Schwarz. And what was his act icn when you were
introduced to him?

Mr. Halpern. Both {Mrs Zogbey) and I were introduced
to him as the new chief of Operations for a government-wide
effort to accomplish the removal of eaeees and the Castro
regime. This effort was to include not |only CIA but the
Department of State and the Departmentjof Defense. And
General Lansdale was to be the Chief of Operations for that
outfit.

Mr. Schwarz. And did you brief him about Cuba or did

he brief you about the operation, or what was the nature of that?

Mr. Halpern. No, we briefed him first in the old

Situation Room, what used to called the Ibell Building, which

Mr. Halpern. It wasn't a matter/of General Lansdale's
being in charge, or the Attorney General being in charge,
nobody objected to General Lansdale Peerriie to the Attorney
General.

It was a matter of whether this would be done through
the normal chain of command, or whether we would actually be
under the General's direct command. H

Mr. Schwarz. But it still is a chracterization, you
were dealing with organization and bureaucracy?

Mr. Halpern. That is right. And drafting papers.

Mr. Schwarz. Drafting papers to do what?

Mr. Halpern. To try to get organized in terms of how
we would accomplish the objective.

Mr. Schwarz.Did any of those papers that you drafted
in those early stages include any reference to assassination
as a device to accomplish the objective?

Mr. Halpern. No, sir.

Mr. Schwarz. Now, did Mr. Helms enter the picture in
the latter part of December 1961?

Mr. Halpern. That is correct. |

Mr. Schwarz. Describe how he came into the picture.

Mr. Halpern. To my knowledge, fi yl described to

me a meeting he had been at at the Director's morning staff
meeting -~- this is Mr. McCone's morning staff meeting -- in

which Mr. McCone, almost in terms of a bombshell for the

recall to a female operative.

Mr. Schwarz. There was no such previous evidence.

Mr. Halpern. We had a number of female officers} and

still do, in our branches. And there were some in the |Cuban

branch and the Cuban task force.

Senator Huddleston. What types of activities did they

participate in?

Mr. Halpern. Oh, recruting of agents, the handling

of agents, disseminating reports, preparing propaganda guid-

ances, preparing papers for a special group as appropriate,

doing the work of any other officer.
