COMMRUATION OF
DISPATCH SECRET

osun - 276227

Subject is President or Director of the l
siology institute (formerly fligher Nervous
ty Institute), Academy of Scicnees: subsource
thinks that Subject is also Professor of Medical
Psychology at Havana University. Subject is a very
well trained psychiatrist and has always enjoyed
great prestige as such; nevertheless, he has always
been reputed to have very low morals, and in medical
circles is "famous" as a woman chaser. He is widely
reputed to attempt to seduce his female patients and
his colleagues' wives. Major Bernabe ORDAZ ,
Director of Havana Psychiatric Hospital, considers
Subject to” be a vulgar political schemgr utterly
lacking in personal prestige among Cuban "new"
Communists; Ordaz has stated that he considers that
Subject wants to control Cuban psychiatric practice
for his ovn personal benefit.

Activ

c. When Castro took power, Subject surprisingly
abandoned the Immediate Action medical doctors' party
and joined the recently organized Revolutionary Medical
Party; Ordaz did not join this party until 1960.

In medical circles, Subject is reputed to collaborate
with the DSE in brain-washing activities, but subsource

had never seen any direct indications of such “

collaboration.
+ NID WA et

d. /prf ‘Armando *DE CORDOVA ,-Psychintrist “

employed a¢ a professor at Havana University, is

a good psychiatrist about 70 years old vvho has always
been.a leftist but is not the type of immoral person
that Bustamante is. De Cordoba and Bustamante travel
together to almost all the psychiatric congresses
held abroad; according to Major Bernabe Ordaz, the two
of them would like to take over the Havana Psychiatric
Nospital, and base their desire on the iact that ordaz
is not a psychiatrist. In subsource's opinion, they
will never be successful in replacing Ordaz, because
Ordaz enjoys the backing of both Fidel Castro and
Celia Sanchez, who are good friends of his.

e. Subsource has known a Dr. -Fdmundo GUTIERREZ

Agramonte, Psychiatrist, since 1959; Gutierrez is
Director of the magazine of Havana Psychiatric Hospital
and attends psychiatric congresses held abroad. te is
a competent psychiatrist and has an ofiice located on
Calle 23, corner of Calle 18, Vedado, Havana City:

In subsource's opinion, he is antiregime although he
speaks in favor of the regime when with proregime
persons, and against the-regime when with antiregime
persons. He does not belong.to the PCC cell at the

“hospital and is not a militiaman. In an assembly held

at the hospital in 1969 with the express purpose of
increasing the number of members of the PCC cell, no

one proposed Gutierrez as a possible aspirant. Gutierred
is about 50 years old and was married about February 196

1. /Dr/ #MXIGNAGARA 7 whose first

name subsource thinks is Ruben, worked at Havana
Psychiatric Hospital (formerly Mazorva) prior to
1959. He is proregime but not an extiemisi, auc
} _ + does not appear to be "willing to dic for the
{ regime". Mignagaray was proposed as-an aspirant
to the PCC cell at the Hospital, in an assombly
held in 1969, but stated that he had a defect
consisting in the fact that he was in love. Subsource
did not know whether he was accepted as an aspirant.
In mid-December 1969, Dr. Cristino Cabello, employed
as a psychiatrist at Havana Psychiatric lospital,
told subsource that Mignagaray had told him that he
(Cabello) would have to take over Migntgaray's ward
because he was going abroad to attend a psychiatric
congress; subsource could give no further information
‘i on the congress or Hignagaray's date of departure.

: Mignagaray is described as a light-skinned mulatto,
about 5'9" tall, weight about 160 pounds, 60-65
1 years old, brown eyes, greying hair, married; subsource
H thought he had tliree children,

g. Dr. Lino Bernabe FERNANDEZ Martinez,
Psychiatrist, joined the anti-Castro counterrevolutionary
forces in the Escambrzy mountains a few months’ before
the Playa Giron invasion; he was arrested shortly
before said invasion and sentenced to 30 years in
prison. Subsource had met him when both were students ¢
at Belen High School; their friendship continued at
Havana University, when both were members of the
: Havana University Catholic Group, and later as members
an of the Movement for the Recuperation of the Revoluticn =
(RR). Subsource took leave of Fernandez the day that
: the latter joined the anti-Castro counterrevolutionaries,

and never saw him again, When subsource visited his
brother-in-law, Enrique Casuso,. held first on the
‘ Isle of Pines, then at La Cabana and later at the
Guanajay Jail, he habitually asked for news of
Dr. Fernandez; the information he reccived made him
-believe that Fernandez is. one of the most respected
prisoners because of his bravery and equilibrium.
Fernandez was mentioned as ‘an example of integrity.
Other prisoners such as Dr. Andres CAO , Juan
BUSTAMANTE , and Antonio GARCIA told
os subsource that Fernandez' attitude had not varied.

Fernandez! wife, Emilia LUZARRAGA , who

frequently visited subsource professionally (subsource

was her psychiatrist), also told subsource that

Fernandez! attitude was firmly antiregine: ‘Luzarraga

is also antiregime, :

visits to subsource, is married to Dr. Armando ZA LD
Pita, M.D., aka "Manduco", who is incarcerated at the
Guanajay Jail. Subsource thought that he had been in
jail since before the Playa Giron invasion; he had
belonged to both the Havana University Catholic Group
and the MRR. Subsource's brother-in-Jaw, Enrique Casuso
and Vicky Andrial both told subsource that Dr. Zaldivar -

CONMNUATION OF
DISPATCH

4. Vicky Andrial lives in Miramar, Havana,
with Iliana ARANGO , the wife of Rino PUIG
imprisoned at La Cabana since 1961; subsource did
not know the length of Puig's sentence but did know
that he had refused to accept "rehabilitation".
Andrial works at the Canadian Embassy in Havana.
Arango also works at an embassy- in Havana, but subsource
did not know which. Both Andrial and Arango are anti-
regime and teach the catechism to children at Reina
Church, Havana City.

a. Dr. Jose *BUSTANENTE O'Leary, psychiatrist, |

was brought up by his aunts; he does not know the

identity of his mother. He, together with Raul Roa,

Justo Carrillo, and others, comes from the ranks of

the left wing of the student movement: tie joined the
Communist Party of Cuba in 1938 and, in 1944, supported
presidential candidate Dr. Carlos Suladrigas in the
presidential elections held that year. - When Dr. Grau

was elected President, Subject’ concentrated.on his =
professional activities, earning considerable pres-

tige and acquiring a good practice, while maintaining .
his political relationships with senators, cdlonos, ‘
etc. In 1952, the year of the coup d'etat, Dr. Bustamente
had such friendly relations with both presidential
. candidates that, if the general elections scheduled

for June. 1952 had been held, Subject would have been

made (a) Vice-Minister of Foreign Relations if Dr. Agramonte
had been elected, and (b) Minister without cartera
(portfolio) if Dr. Hevia had been elected.

: . ‘After the. 10 March 1952 coup d'etat,’
¥\ | Subject_opposed the de facto government in i
spite ui.nas ciose relations with Dr. MORALES
del Castillo, who offered Subject the post of A
Consulting Counsellor (Consejero Consult ivo)
- which post Subject rejected, Subject began to
conspire against the regime with Justo Carrillo Pe.
: and Dr. Araujo, constituting the organization fof
i , called the Montecristi Group. Subject continues i
to maintain a close relationship with Dr. Araujo, i
now President of the Cuban Medical College,
Professor of the School of Medical Sciences of
Havana University, and functionary of the Higher
Nervous Activity Research Institute.

c. After the 1 January 1959 Revolution,
Subject hastened to exploit the Communist con-
tent. of the Revolution and participated directly
in the denunciation of Dr. Urrutia. One of
Urrutia's assistants was Subject's patient and

{ informed Sutject of events occurring within the
Presidential Palace, Subject then consulted with
aes Raul Castro and denounced Dr. Urrutia as anti-

. Communist.

d. Subject is very intelligent, very com-
petent, and an extraordinarily hard worker. He A
=| : is Professor of Psychology at the Havana University iP
i Medical School, and Director of the Higher Nervous Pa 7
Activity Research Institute. During the decade
1950-60, he held a high post within the Cuban
Medical College and was President of the World
" - Medical Group; during this decade he made many
visits to the USA on matters related to:his pro-
fessional activities. ‘|

: e. It has been commented that Subject performed

F “brain washing" activities for the Havana DSE.

a vos z During the period in 1966 that subsource was held
prisoner at Villa Marista, he did not sec Subject;
subsource has never heard anyone state that he
actually saw Subject at Villa Marista. In subsource's
opinion, if Subject has ever worked for the MININT,
it was probably as professor of psychology in classes
given to MININT personnel; subsource presumes that

ii the classes would have been similar to those that
Subject gave to Cuban artists.

ts 1. In 1956, Subject acquired an extraordinarily
beautiful mistress that he still continues to visit
_ and support, This mistress, Nanolita Canto, was
divorced by her husband, Salup (fnu), after a. private
wt 3 detective hired by the husband surprised Subject and
7 Canto in a hotel room in Miami, Florida; subsequently,
U.S. immigration authorities prohibited Subject from
entering the U.S.A, Canto had. had one son by her
fiusband; when her husband died, the son itherited
the father's wealth, which was considerable: The
laws against private property promulgated by the
Castro regime undermined Canto's economic position
to the point that she has had to go to work; she now
works at the INIT (National Tourist Industry Institute),
located at 23 and L Streets, Vedado, Mavana City.

Subject surrendered his private pract to the Cuban
Government, and receives only his salary as Director |
of the Hygher Nervous Activity Research Institute,

which salary amounts to 800 Cuban pes: this salary’
is insufficient to permit Subject to maintain his i
own home and his mistress's separate home and to lead
the type of life to which he was accustomed,

g. Subject is described as lacking in. normal
affections, cold and. calculating, a typical schizoid
interested only in himself, never makes.a friendly i
gesture, has almost no friends.” Subject is generally. - aad
disliked and has many enemies who feel real ‘hate towards !
him. The young Revolutionary medical doctors refuse
to have anything to do with him. Fidel Castro does
not know who Subject is and has certainly never been
treated by Subject or received psychiatric treatment
from any other psychiatrist. Subject must be very un-
happy and downcast at his present situation: His
income is insufficient forhis normal mode of life;
he no longer travels extensively abroad (formerly,
he traveled abroad every three months); he holds no
representative office; he is not politically or socially
prominent and, indeed, no one pays him the slightest
attention, Subsource states categorically that he
believes that "Dr. Bustamente would be willing to
accept any offer, He would take the bait if given
half a chance."

for employment as (a) CNIC researchers, (b) researchers for the
National Research Institutes that collaborate with the CNIC, oot
(c) medical school faculty members, (d) industria: scicntistc,
(ec) and researchers and workers in the pure sciences, The CNIC

2, The National Center for Scientific Research (Centro
Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas, CNIC) is located in i
Reparto Siboney (formerly Country Club), Marianao, Havana Pro~ i
vince, next to the Victoria de Giron premedical school (formerly
Colegio Sagrado Corazon), and occupies several impressive new ‘
buildings; in addition, large private homes in the area have
been equipped as laboratories and residences for CNIC personnel.
As of mid-November 1967, some of the residences were occupicd by
; foreign scientists. i

3. The CNIC is an autonomous organization controlled by :
the Office of the Prime Minister, through which its funds are i
budgeted. Important matters concerning the CNIC are handled
. personally by Fidel Castro, whose approval is required for
foreign exchange expenditures. such as the purchase of equipment.
contracting of foreign’ personnel, ‘trips abroad by CNIC per-
sonnel, and recruiting campaigns aimed at foreign scientists.
: Fidel Castro, rather than ex-Minister Machado Ventura, appointed
Hy the director and other important CNIC executives. Dr. Wilfredo iz :
Torres, M,D., hematologist, is CNIC director. The Public Health ~
Ministry (MINSAP) plays no part in the supervision of the CNIC :
and cannot influence the decisions of its executives.

4. The organization and functions of the CNIC are con—-
fidential alfhough not secret, and any person who has contact
with medical professors can acquire some information on the
CNIC. Since about June 1967, an ID card issued by the CNIC to }

cseee its employees is required to enter the CNIC’ buildings and the seesees
fat pbs homes that have been equipped as laboratories and resi- “4 -
lences. al

5. CNIC activities are oriented towards three fundamental
: objectives, namely; “.

a, Scientific research related to’ the medical sciences. ;

b. The preparation of highly qualified research and - £
professorial personnel for employment, after gradu-

. ation, as (1) CNIC researchers, (2) researchers of i
The National Research Institutes (see Ldow), ¥

as CNIC researchers; part would join the faculties of
the university schools of pure sciences, and: part would
enter Cuban industry to work on the applications of
technology to production,

Scientific Research

6. Scientific research related to the medical sciences
is done at both the CNIC and at the National Research Institutes.
The general directives for such research are oriented towards:

a. Theexperimental verification of conclusions arrived at,
or discoveries made, by foreign scientists, This work
of verification is effected (1) principall» in order
to train Cuban personnel in the methods of higher r
search, but also (2) as an attempt to contribute in-
formation complementary to the discovery.

“b, Original research work done by Cuban personne) advised
by foreign scientists, This work is directed towards -
(1) the attainment of results of international or=
tance to be used in propaganda praising Castro‘s
education system, and (2) the achievement of discoveries
“in applied science that would serve either as an econ-
omic saving or to earn foreign exchange. AS of mid-
January 68, CNIC research projects had produced nothing
of scientific importance, During the first half of 67,
. Fidel Castro ordered the CNIC.to orient all its re-
: Search projects ‘towards production technology so that -
the foreign exchange invested in the projects could be
partially recovered through improved production.

7. Department of Biochemistry. -The most important of the
CNIC departments isthe Department of Biochemistry; it occupies
Several new buildings and former private homes, It is headed’ by
Dr. Mora (fnu), a Chilean microbiologist. This department was
conaucting research on polarimetry, enzymology, spectography,
and the synthesis of a steroid hormone from stigmasterol, a
sugar-cane by product.

8. As of mid-January 1968, all attempts to synthesize a
steroid hormone from stigmasterol had failed and will alnost
surcly continue to fail because stigmasterol is un inert
steroid lacking in biological activity,

9. Dr, Carlos J, Finlay, M,D,, was preparing a resci.c
thesis for the degree of Doctor of Basic Sciences; his research
“project, the biochemistry of lipides in cardiovascular diseases,
is of scientific interest although not of international. impor-.
tances” 7 i ides ttenaseeSealenerienaniltets :

10. Department of Ultracentrifugation, Although nomi
& scparate department, the Department of Ultracentrifugati
in fact functions as a subdivision of the Department of Bio-
chemistry. As of mid-November 1967 it contained the most moder.

centrifuges then available, Its basic function is the analysis
or separation of the diverse elements that constitute a bio-
logical substance, :

11. Department of Electronic Microscopy. This: department: waa
functioning in Nevomber I967 and contained two electron micro-
scopes of the highest quality, one Polish-made and the other
believed to be Japanese. It was performing research in cytology,
ultrastructuse (the sltremicsrescopic structure of tissues of
living beings), crystallography, and the three-diwensional -
spatial structure of certain biological substances.

12, DEpartment of Medical Botany. This departuent is headed
by a very inlolTigent and coTeared Spanish agronu st naned
Guillermo Cid who has been in Cuba since 1940. It is effecting
a systematic study of Cuban flora in order to deteruine the
pharmacological and therapeutical properties of Cuban plants.
The department works in coordination with the experimental
station ia Santiago de las Vegas that is directed by the eminent
92-year old Dr. Juan Tomas Roig Mesa, who is the greatest Cuban
expert on Cuban and tropical Tlora and one of the greatest
authorities in the world on medicinal plants. In addition, the
department has the cooperation of all the experimental agron-
comical stations in Cuba, which send the department samples of
any plant considered worth. investigation; the department con-
ducts an exhaustive analysis of such samples, The research has
two objectives:

a, The utilization of the curative properties of the
plants, which constitute a cheap supply of national
raw materials and can replace many imported pro-
ducts, i:

b. The launching on the world market of competitive
pharmaceutica] products, following the example
. of Red China and Bulgaria.

13. The work of the Department of Medical Botony will pro-
bably be successful because of (a) the qualifications and com-
petence of its director, Guillermo Cid, (b) the extraordinary
impulse that has ‘been imparted to its research program, and

(c) the extraordinary richness of Cuban flora-in medicinal plants.

14, Department of Microbiiogy and Virology. This depart-
ment is very well equipped and manned. Tt has Ultracentrifuges
and isolated installations for virus cultures, and installations
for experimental animals.

15, Biomechanics and Biomedical Studies. Biomechanics is
the study of the biological activity of living organisms from
the point of view of the physicochemical Jaws that goveru them.
As of September 1966, a department that would do research on bio~
mechanics was being organized within the CNIC. The Cuban Govern-
ment is aware of the enormous medical importance of the appli-
cation of cybernetics (problem solving by electronic computers)
to the analysis, organization, and resolution of the very complex
physicochemical. problems that the biology of living ‘beings pre--
sents; the Government is attempting to organize. this departnent,
which will train highly qualified personnel and import. electronic
computers (a) for the study of the complex. physicochemical pro-
blems related principally to hematology, neurophysiology, and
cardiology and. cardiovascular surgery, and (b) for the couputa—

health data of different types that the MINSAP regiond organi-
zations would provide. .

‘directed fundamentally towards the study and electronic comput
“tation of the medification ir both healthy and sick persons of +
Such: biological parameters as hemodynamic curves, concentra :
tion and saturation of gases and alterations-in the basic acid
equilibrium of the blood, and were to include the study of the
variations in the biological parameters from the biochemical
and hemodynamic point of view during cardiovascular surgery
and in physiological research related to the cardiovascular ap
Paratus. In neurophysiology and neuropharmacology, the re~ _

‘ search projects would be oriented towards research on higher 1
i nervous activity including electrical modifications produced i
i in higher nervous activity; in hematology, the projects would : :
be oriented towards the study of isoimmunization and patho-

} logical alterations of the different blood cells. The electron- |
: ic computers would be needed to process the immense quantities

of data such research would produce,

7 17. Dr. Fernando J, Toro, a medical doctor who is also i
| an electrical engineer, was to head this department. Toro
Hl is reputed to be very intelligent, a gifted organizer, highly
| motivated, and by far the best man available in Cuba for the

{ : type of research described; he has more than 20 years ex-

| perience in electromedical instruments. i

research, and such training requires years of effort. The few
Persons prepared to do important research are at the present
time occupied in the administrative and pedagogical organization
of the CNIC and cannot work full-time as researchers. :
ie . 19. Research in Antibiotics. In 1960, Dr. Jose Antonio
ce Padron, an €minent research ecientist, began work onthe isola-
a tion and culture of antibiotic. substances. the study of their !
Properties, and experimentation with said substances; he ini-
2 tiated this work at the Oncological Hospital but is now a CNIC
tances a collaborator. As of December 1967, he had isolated and exhaus-
tae tively studied 89 new antibiotics, many of which are too toxic
i for human use. His work demonstrates his great ability and
perserverance, and with the material resources of the CNIC at

his disposal, should result in discoveries of scientific im-
Portance.

CRIC Training Program
ERIC Training Program

fi 29. Doctor of Basic Sciences. The CNIC offers a three-
year training program leading to the degree of Doctor of Basic
Sciences for which program fifth-year medical students with
exceptional academic standing can qualify if (a) during their
college career they have shown special aptitudes for teaching
and research, (b) the WJC gives them-an "A" grade in political
standing or reliability, and (c) they are cleared by a DSE
investigation. In 1966, of the students then in the fifth

ee . year of medical school, only six were accepted by this trainang
program; all were excellent students and UJC members and are

. Row medical doctors: Ramon Ortiz, Rosa Elena Simeon, . Ismael

Ff Clark. Arce, Hilda Donderis, Julio Rolriguez Docal, and his
WiTe Naira (Inu). As of April 1968, probably no more than 30
students were studying in this training program, chiefly be-
cause of the rigorous entrance requir 2ments.

Neither Santiago de Cuba nor Santa Clara has a similar iusti-
tute.

28. As of September 1967, students from Las Villas,
Camaguey, and Oriente Provinces who desire to enter medical’
school as first-year students must matriculate at either
Santa Clara or Santiago de Cuba University; this measure was
put into effect. in order to reduce congestion at Havana Uni-
versity.

National Research Institutes

_ 29, The following National Research Institutes, organized
by medical specialties, work in coordination wits the CNIC but
are’ subordinate to the MINC\P. All were organized as "inpsti-

tutes" during the first three months of 1967,.although some had

been functioning for years under different names. All] are
clinical research institutes that work primarily with patients.
Each institute centrols all the hospital departsents throughout
Cuba that correspond to the specialty of the institute. For
example: The Endocrinology Institute controls #11 the hospital
departments of endecrinology in Cuba.

30, Endocrinology Institute. The Endocrinology Institute
replaced thé former Institute for Endocrinological Research fi
that was founded and directed by Dr. Yamil Kouri. The insti-
tute is located at the same site as the former institute; the
ground floor of the leit wing of the Fajardo Nospital, Havana
City. It is headed by Dr. Oscar Mateo de Acosta, M.D., Cuba's
most eminent endocrinologist. Dr. Mateo is extraordinarily
intelligent, a university professor and PCC member, and is one
of the scientific bulwarks of the Castro Regime. Mateo's
assistants include Dr. Catalina Eibenschuz, who is marricd 10
Dr. Mora, head of the CNIC Department of Biochemistry, and
was studying endocrincology in-France in early €8; Dr. Barto-
lome Arce, who studied in Rumania and: was studying in France
in early 68; and a young medical doctor named Oviedo (fnu),
who was probably. to be sent to Sweden to study.

31. The Endocrinology Institute enjoys a large budget
because of Dr. Mateo's scientific eminence and political.
nyirtues". It has excellent equipment for electrophoresis,
ultracentrifuges, and. photocolorineters. ei

. 32, Nephrology Institute. The Nephrology Institute is :
located on thg fifth floor of the Joaquin Albarran Clinical-

” Surgical Hospital, Avenida 26 at Avenida Rancho Boyeros, Havana.
It 4s headed by Dr. Abelardo Buch, M,D,, an extraordinarily
‘abl. researcher who was working on:

a. acute, chronic renal insufficiency,

b. microdeterminations of certain normal quantities o1
the renal apparatus, and :

c. the experimental verification of modern theories
that explain the physiopathology of shock and its
treatment; his experiments were based on the research

me -y hypothesis of Dr. Richard Lillehei; -chicf of-the-~ - --
= Department. of Surgery, Minnesota University.

residency in nephrology and appointed Dr. Frankie Dorticos as-
the first resident; Dorticos is the son of the Dean of the
Havana University Medical School and nephew of President
Dorticos, Artifical kidneys were installed at to the Santa
Clara Civil] Hospital and the Santiago de Cuba Nous, ital in
late 1967; these artificiz} kidneys are for use in treating
kidney discase rather thaa for medical research,

! ; 35.. Mcmatology Instituté. The Hematology Institute

. . has departments at_ the Willvam-soler Hospital, the Fajardo j
. Hospital, and the National Hospital, all located in Havana

a . City. The institute has no building of its own and its

i activities are located at:the three best hematological clinics

in Cuba, as enumerated above, The Director of the Hematology i

Institute ia Dr. Eduardo de ta Torre, who is also chief of the i

Department of Hematology, william Soler Hospital. Dr. Ulacia

i (fnu), who is probably Cuba's best hematologist, is chief of

the Departmeat of Hematology of the Fajardo Hospital,

36. The most important research Project of the Hematology
Institute was initiated about duly 66 and consisted of the
Study of the "utilization of isoniazida in the treatment of
H Werholf's (as received) disease J purpura trombopenica idio-

i EEE patica." The value of isoniazida in the treatment of werholf's

j ‘diséaSe was discovered by~chance under the following circum-

i . stances: A clild hospitalized in the hematological department

; r of the William Soler hospital for treatment of Werholf's dis-—

. ease contracted a primary tuberculosis infection; when this

i ios infection was treated with isoniazida. the’ symptom-complex of

j z Werholf's disease disdppeared completely and no relapse occur-

. red: As of January .1968,. 22 such cases had been studied and the

¢ conclusions were being prepared for presentation at a Henato-
logical Congress; the biological mechanism of the treatment had
not yet been determined, but it was considered that the experi-~
mental stage had- been completed, :

37.. Dr. Eduardo de la Torre was performing research —

. : principally of a statistical nature — on leucemias. Infantile
* leucemia was being studied at the William Soler Hospital and

at the Angel Arturo Aballi Children's Hospital, located in

Arroyo Naranjo, liavana; this research followed the treatment

scheme of Swelzer and the University of California scheme is

known internationally as V.A.ML.PL

38. Gastroenterology Institute. . The Gastroenterolozy
Institute Occupies the two-story building at the Calixto Garcia
Hospital which was formerly occupied by the hospital library.
Its Director is Dr. Raimundo Llanio Navarro, who was brought
to world-wide eminence when he presented his study "Colanzio-
grafia Laparoscopica en la Lactante" at the Brussels Congress
in 1965. When the Gastroenterology Institute was officially
established in early 1967, it had been functioning for about _
~ c two years. In January 1967, ‘Dr.. Humberto Rodriguez Hidalgo and,
i Dr. Mirna Quintero were admitted as residents; their admission
as residents coincided with the establishment at the institute-
of atraining progran for specislists in gastroenterology.

very ambitious plans to use electronic data processing machines
to.study the electrochemical processes and the servomechanisms
of higher nervous activity; these ambitious plans were to be
put into effect in 1967, - The land located behind the institute
was to serve for the construction of other departments of the
institute.

46. Hygiene and Epidemiology Institute. .The Hygiere and
Epidemiology listitute functions at two Separate installations.
Institute headquarters and its hygiene section occupy a
building on Calle Infanta, Havana City. Dr. Cosme Ordonez,
M.D., is director of the institute; he is described as very
intelligent and very well-organized. During the first six
months of 196% he took a course in hygiene and epidemiology
at the University of London. Or. Plasencia (fnu) is another of

- . the principal figures at the institute.

47. Public health data received from all parts of Cuba
are processed at the institute headquarters on Calk Infanta
(DOJ; September 1966), In addition to the hygiene section
institute hoadquarters contains a well-equipped Virology Depart-
ment, which has an electron microscope, a well-cquippéd Serums

Dear Dr. Bustamante:

I have recently completed a reading of your
paper entitled "Cultural Pactors in Hyster{as with
Schizophrenic Clinical Pictures." I found it to be
of great interest and I appreciate your sending it
to me. I have been working with Dr. William Wolf
on the projection of medical education and psychiatry
ae they are likely to be in the next century. The
first of a series of articles and of a monograph,
was published in the April 1966 iesue of the American
Journal of Psychotherapy. This takes in @ great deal
of analysis that would be included under transcultural
peychiatry. Indeed, we are using the systeas analysio
approach which, of course, must take into account the
broad psychosocial and socioeconomic forcee thdt in-
fluence the psychodynamics matrices in individuals.

1 am interested in the particular securities that are
precipitated in the ego structure of individuals by
the very nature of the sociceconomic, sociopolitical
and sociophilosophic system in which the individual
lives:. In an opposite vein, ve are interested in the
stresses that are placed upon the individual by vari-
ous social systems from individual and practical stand-
points. Awarenesses such as these should be of help

+ dm the planning of social systems for underdeveloped
nations. While this seems like a very ambitious con-
ceptualization, I do not believe that it is an unlikely
possibility in the coming generations.

I look forward to receive the copy of your
book "Psicologia Medica", Volume I. I believe that the
outline as you presented it to me seems very inclusive.

definite evolution hed taken place between 1961 and 1966, bringing life ta
the Soviet Union several steps closer to that in the Western countries. He
also found radical changes in the field of his ‘professional specialty.
Psychiatric and psychologicel trends in the USSR, he felt, had broken avoy

Dear Dr. Redlich: :

@ll the information about our activities at the Inetitute. I have
not heard from you ever since, and I am afraid this letter did not
’

reach you at al therefore, I am enclosing .a copy and following
ere a few more news about this year's activities so far.

I wish to let you know that in July our new Review called
A | @ranscultural Psychiatry will be published here. Ag soon as it ia
HI 7 out, I will mail you a copy. We are editing it and it will be the
u t firat of ite kind in our language.

We have an Anthropologist working with us at the Institute
‘now, Dr. Antonio Santa Cruz, a Yale graduate, and we are planning a
oint book on Transcultural Paychiatry since there is not a treatise
eer dae on this subject. I will let’ you know as to ita develop-
ment. eee

In ‘reference to the Reviews that you so kindly offered to send
us, we are for the time being overcoming the shortage we were ex-
periencing. Instead, and if at all possible, I would like to receive

‘ol. III of the American Handbook of Psychiatry, edited by Silvano
Arieti. I have Vols. I and II, and would be obliged to you if you
could send it.to me.

- Although I know your interest is.in Psychiatry, I wish to
inform you that we are organizing a Symposium of Psychology which
_ Will take place in-Hevana, the 24-30 of November, 1565, convened by
the Institute and the Academy of Sciences. Its subject will be:
“Motivation: neurophysiologic, psychologic and sociai factors. Fers-

pective of an integration", The peper could te on motivation: 2%

- Can be an interdisciplinary aubject, es well as neurophyeiologic,
psychologic or -a social one.

I do not know whether you are interested or not, but in case
you are, please let me know and I will send you'’an invitation. The
gueste' stay will be borne by the Academy of Sciences, and we heve

I think I should let you know that I have written to Dr. De r ‘

. Leigh, Secretary to the World Psychiatric Association and among other

things I indicated the convenience to create one Committee or Section
of Transcultural Psychiatry within the World Psychiatric Association
because this is a rather new and multi-disciplinary field (comprising
peychologista, psychiatrista,- anthropologists, etc.) requiring more
than any other one the cooperation and help to facilitate the efforta

this field.

I have secured a better way to get our mail and it consista
of the following: address your envelope to Laboratoriog Erba, Apartado

the letter and see it is addressed to me, a member of the laboratory
will bring it pergonally to me ag they travel back and forth between
our countries. I will addresa my lettera to you and they will mail
them in Mexico to you. In this way, we are both sure our mail will
not get lost since I have absolute confidence in then.

I think I have covered everything of interest to you,

Querido Amigos S!

Aprovechsndo un nuevo viaje del amigo V,risco te escribo otra vez pare
s8luderte y darte unos informes que cred de importancia.

Tembién le estoy escribiendo,e Segufn y Dévila. Les hago saber a todos
que en el mes de Julio ssldré el primer numero de nuestra Revista Psi~
guistrfa Transcultural de la cusl les enviare un ejemplar tan pronto
-salga. z

En,el mes de Noviembre se ha de celebrar una reunién de 1a Organiza—
eioén Sanitaris Popener icone sobre la "Ensefisnze de le Psicologia uédi-
cs y la Psiquiatria en América," a la que pienso asistir puss he sido
invitedsa le Facultad de Medicine de le Universidad de la Habana por le
organizecion y la. F,culted casi con toda seguridad -me ha: de designer,
en ese caso no tendria problemas pues ellos se ocupan de conseguir le
visa y de todos los demés detalles relacionados con le reunion.

Bn e1 mes de Enero le escrib{ una extensa carte a Pichot que en el
Congreso de Madrid estuvo tratando de producir @ reunion de los
esistentes 81 mismo que se dedican s la Psicologia Médica.

“Yo recib{ su citecién con gran entusiasmo pues creo que es necesario
cambien impresiones los norteamericanos, europeos y latinoamericanos 4
“ ya que cads uno de dicho grupo tenemos nuestra propia opinion como 4
- gon sin dads las tres opiniones que rigen en el mundo en esta materia. ad
‘1 por su,parte nos defraudo tanto a como 8 Seguin pues realizo at
uns reunion intrascendente y se. puso en contacto con gente que no re=
presente la Psicologis Hedica en el mundo y por ejemplo, concretamen—
nP velacién a1 Peru, entrd en contacto, no con Seguin que estaba
alli, sino con un muchscho que no se dedica a esta disciplina.

Ese es la razén por 1a cual le escrib{ esa carta haciéndole esas eri-~
ticas y sugiriendole que para tratar de esos problemas con nosotros
letinosmericencs tenfan fundsmentalmente que entrar en contacto con-
tigo, con Seguin y conmigo pues creo fuera de toda falsa modestie que
somos le mis alta experiencie de la Psicologia Médice en América Lati-

“ne y de hecho una corrdente de importancia en el mundo,

No he tenido respuesta a esta carta todavia, pero si recin{ una neta

de él donde me decfs que habia estado varios meses fuera de Francia,

Ahore bien yo creo que lo mejor es que cembiemos impresiones los tres
por correo antes de llegar a la reunion en:Novienbre en Lima pues allf
nos yemos a poner de 8cuerdo los latinoamericanos sobre dicho problena.
Beguin bare ellf, ta no debes falter y yo voy a hecer todo lo Posi~

ble por ire

.Claro que hay cdtedras de Psicologia Médica en Argentine, Venezuela,

Colombia y tal vez otras HBS, pero ei dessrrollo que hemos logredo en
Peru, México y Cubs por nuestros respectivos esfuerzos todo el mundo

reconoce y de no satarlo lo ecepta en cuento se le informa.

Por ello es que creo que es importante que cambiemos impresiones los
tres antes de llegar a Noviembre, para llegar a Lima con perspectivae
de wa linea sdecusds.

Luego debemos demandar de los norteamericenos y de Pichot y los Europeos
: Un cambio de impresiones o indicérselo a la OMS como acuerdo de nuestra
+ veunion en Lima, F

Con los mejores deseos bara ti y un fuerte abrazo, se despide tu amigo,

We would appreciate. an early answer from you about this so we
can begin the necessary arrangements.

As for your information about publishing a version of my letter
to you on activities at the Institute ie all right with me. In fact,
I consider it a great honor to tell your readera about us.

I am happy. to know that you have received ‘and read my paper on
"Cultural Pactors io Hyaterias with Schizophrenic Clinical Pictures."
Por ay part, I will let you know that I have read your monography
published in the April 1966 number of the American Journal of Peycho-
herapy. I found it extremely interesting and was glad to know that
there is more to come on this subject.

‘ Thank you for your kind words about my book on Medical Paycho-
logy. The one pou received is Vol. I; Vol. II will be out in August,
and I am working on Vol. III. ‘As soon as Vol. II is out, I will: mail
you @ copy.

Three of the acientista that have already accepted to come to
the Symposium visited the Institute this year. (ne of them was Dr.
Vladimir D, Nebylitsyn, Vice-Director of the Institute. of Psychology
from Moscow, who stayed two months with us, He helped us to create
@ typology laboratory in our Psychology Department, At the same time
ei mee @ course on topology variables according to Teplov and

elf. :

" He works principally. studying personality. Hig conception is
primarily based in. ‘the human brain properties that were discovered

by Pavlov and later on were developed by Teplov and hig collaborators.

Dr. Nebyliteyn, as well as other investigators, have developed
some acientific methods on the investigation of such properties of
the nervous syetem and their studies nowadayea can very well be
correlated with certain personality dimensions. It has been thus
proven by some investigators abroad and today, in Cuba, we need to

~ begin developing ‘Such acientific methods.

We algo had Dr. BE. Roy John, from the New York Medical College,

who spent a month here. Following is a brief resumé of his activities

at the Institute.

In the mornings, Dr. John gave a lecture on physiology of

every possible
way, psychological, physiological, biochemical and enatomically.
The lecture was discussed by those attending, and experimental so-
lutions were proposed for various problema not yet resolved. The text
book used in this course was written by Dr. John himself and will be

‘ out of print by now,



Stanley Lesve, B.D. ‘ : oe

_ In-the afternoons, four different experiments were carried
out. The first one on evoked potentials in humans, correlatione
ef case facing luminous stimulations of different colora.. Infle-
ence of expectancy situations. The second experiment was on
learning, observing cate with alimentary roflex, The third one
wae in influence epecific and, unspecific structures of the
Central Rervous System on learning. Stimulations of differest
gpecstie. structures and of reticular watching the importance of
the facilitation of this mechanism. The fourth experiment Has. a
atudy with microelectrodes of neuronal: activity changes during the
loarning stage 4n cronic animals. : _

Both Dr. Hebylitsyn and Dr. John dictated very interesting
conferences at the Academy of Sciences’ Conference Hall and at the
Soientific Council of the Ministry of Public Health.

At the moment, we have Dr. B. Grastyan, from the Universit:
of Pocs, Hongary » who will leave goon. after Collaborasing with the
Dopartzent of Psychology for tuo wonthe, He has been working on ;
motivation and cooperating in a joint work. for. our coming Sympodius.”

: I tolé you in my previous letter that I was receiving your
Scurnel because the dues had boon paid, but T just found out that
because of the dollar situation ny gub@cription was not renewed,
something I am unable to help. If at all possible I would like
you to do the following:

ie We are publishing a Bulletin for the Institute, and ag of next
: July, the first number of a Review called Transcultural Psychiatry,
the first of its kind in Spanish, will be out. ‘I beg of you that,
apart from sending you news about Cuba from time to time to bi
pobiished in your Journal, to please accept ae an exchange thi
eviews for your Journal, otherwise, I could not guarantee to re eive
4t periodically. Thus, I am propo! ing an official exchange of both
Reviews until this abnormal situation can be remedied, because the
Journal ia very important to me. :

Please refer to ny letter of arch 27 ae te. the fastest way
of communication betw us. Thie will reach you via the same 7

Dear Dr. Kiev:

I received yours of May 17 a few days ago and I thank.
you for the information. . ‘

Pirst of all, I wish to acknowledge receipt of your book,
"Magic, Faith and Healing = Studies in Primitive Paychiatry
foday", for which I am grateful. It is most interesting and I
am reading it with great pleasure.

I want you to know that in July a new Review called
Transcultural Psychiatry will be published here. We are editing
it-and it will be the first of ite kind in our language. Ag
soon.as it ig ‘out, Iwill mail you a copy. .This Review will be
the official organ.of the Transcultural Paychiatry Commission of
the Cuban Society of Psychiatry and tho Cuban Group of Trans-
cultural Studies in which a resumé, translation or ‘comments in
Spanish of all the works written the world over will be published.
Later on, it will become the publication media for the Cuban
Society of Psychiatry works, as well as. those written by the Trans—
oultural Psychiatry Section of the Institute, gathering in it all
Cuban publications and giving opportunity too to some latin
American scientists' papers, but always keeping comments, trans-
lation or resumé of other Reviews. “At the beginning, the Review
will appear every 6 months, but. later on it will be a quarterly.

We have an Anthropologist working with us at the Institute

“now, Dr. Antonio Senta Cruz, a Yale graduate, and we are planning

a joint book on Transcultural Psychiatry, since there is not a
treatise in Spanish on this subject that I know of, Iwill let
you know as to ita development.

Just todey I received the 1966 Report on Activities of the Inter-
taken during the luncheon in Madrid, for which I thank you.

Reading the Report I noticed thore is a Bulletin de Centre de i
Peychiatrie et de Reurologie in Haiti. I would like to receive copy
or copies of numbero that have already appeared. I do not know cxactly
where to write, or to whom address the letter, so will you kindly take }

Algo, I am interested in the International Journal of Paychiatry

published in Boston, which I would like to receive too. You could give

hen ay name with the Institute address so they can send me the copies. | -

To both these Reviews you can tell them that since I am Director. of -

both the bulletin of the Institute and the new Review of Transcultural i

Paychiatry I am.officially proposing an exchange for ther Review, or {

else they can tell me what they want-me to do. : ‘.

Incidentally, I wish to call your attention to the fact that the:
Institute's name now ie Instituto de. Neurofisiologia.y Psicologia, not
Instituto de Investigaziones de la Actividad Nerviosa Superior, ag the i
aforemontioned Report was addressed; The address was correct, Loma y :

I think I should let you know that I have written to Dr. D. Leigh,
Secretary to the World Paychiatric Association and among other things
I indicated the convenience to create one Committees or Section of Trans-

the following: address your envelope to Laboratorios Erba, Apartado

the letter and see it is addressed to me, a member of the laboratory
will bring it personally-to rie as they ‘travel back.and forth between
our countries. I will address my lettera to you and they will mail
them in Mexico to you. In thig way, we are both sure our mail will
not get lost since I have absolute confidence in then.

I am taking this opportunity to send you book, "Medical Paycho~

"Sgedo puede vensgloriarse de haber sido cuna de-dos nombres. preclaros en 1s Hia~

Con el advenimiento del régimen commista de Fidel CASTRO, comenzé la desintegra—

en donde desempeié diversos cargoz, pwo conocer ampliamente el: desarrollo h. ‘
do la uedicina en Cuba hasta 61 30 do Atri de 1967, es decir ha podido co-

nocer también el desernvolvimiento de la medicina oubana durante el réciuon
costro-comunista, Siendo lo que a continuacién expreso un enjuiciamiento

del mismo en su triple especto docente, profesional y clasista.

Appecto docente.

La Universidad de 1a Habana fué fundeda en el efio 1728 y fueron preciaarente

Jos estudios médicos los primeros en ser organizados cozo Facultad. Si o} pe-

tcria de la Medicina, como son Tomis EOMAY, sabio introductor de la vecuna er
Luba y el Dr. Oarios J, FINLAY, genial descubridor del agente tranamisor de la
fiebre amarilla, Bn la época republicana adquirié justa fama por la celiaud de
evs profesores, la rigidez de sus planes de estudio y la brillante de sus gre~
duados. Pero no es; el romento de citar nonbres que justifiquen tales escuera-
Ciones. Basta decir tan solo que la Facultad de Medicina, Preoisamente, estaba |
clasificada coco 4-2] en el ranking de las facultades similares del imunio entero,
al igual que les mejores universidades de los Estados Unidos de América.

cién de la Universidad de 1a Habana, para volverla a integrar, como une rueda mis

er-le inmensa naguinaria comunista del Gobierno, Siendo.precisamente °:. faculties

de Medicina 1a prinera en ser atacada, alegando diversos protextos de indcie se-

cundaria, 1o que trajo como consecuencia la remmncia de la mejor parte de su pro-
fesorado. Con la enigracién de los médicos cubanos casi en masa, que repudieban

el régizen totalitario y tiraénico que se instauraba en Ja Isla, agudizaniose la

carencia de profesores en la Facultad de Medicina.

Eodo do resolver este grave problema se le creaba al rézinen Cast.

En primes lugar noubrando profesores de "dado", es decir que munca hicic:

nine

guna prueba de capacided fara adquirir sus catedras, sino que deben eu nowirts:

to por ser milituntes cununistao o por Ja oxclusiva voluntad uel Hector o itera,



“"profesores improvisedos, sin ninguna historia o experiencia médica-peduydzioa.

-¥ aquollos rarisimos, repetimos, que pueden poseer alguna, por haber sido ante-

” fianza, lo que si se exige es una nilitancia activa dentro de los cuadros uel Per~

autoridades commistes cubanas que dirigen la salud piblice. En segundo lugar,

icportanio profesionales extranjeros de Feises Comunistas o Socialistas, o Lien

de Pafses Democréticos, pero que son militantes o sizpatizantés ocultcs de loa
pertidos comunistas loceles. Todos estos profesionales son habilitadcs inuedia-
tamente, incluso pare ejercer la protesién médica, por un simple decreto recto—

rel.

Asi como un exdmen irparcial de este profesorado, nos pernite afirmar su baja

celidad, y por una razén muy sercilla; por ser todos'con rarisimas excepciones

tiormente profegores de le facultad, no tienen la libertad de ensefianza propia

del cardcter liberal de la Medicina, sino que estén sujetes a le férrea discipli-

na colectiva propia de los sistecas msrristas-leninistas.

Dol alumnads puede decirse ein exageracién alguna, que es él més malo eu 1a larga
historia de la ya bi-centenaria Universidad de la Eabsna. Como lo qué se quiere
obtener es un tipo de médico politico, ciego observante de les reglas conunistas
poco importa la proparscién médica dé los alumnos.” Si antiguamente se requerfen
1 afios de Bscuela Primaria y 4 0 5 de Bachillerato, hoy cualquiera, con un simple
exmen, las mis de las veces amaiisdo, puede hacer su ingreso en los estuiics mé~

@icos sin haber curasdo ningin tipo de preparacién en la Primera o Seguda Enser~

tido Comunista Cutano, ea decir, que no estudie en la Facultad de Medicina, el que |

quiere o tiene vocacién por estos estudios, para ello hay que demostrar de un modo :

fehaciente le vinculaocién al réginen. Y cuando se tiene sospecha de use" tBiia ad-

celebra una “Asaublea de

tilmente a la grar masa de profesionales emigrados, las notas se dan for sicple

cemunistas y para que se vea hasta donde llegan en esté sentido, vaya 1a siguier.

te anécdota vivida por el Dr. BEATO, 1a cual refleja con exactitud esta gran

época pre-comunista, que cuando CASTRO se epodera del poder, le faltutan pocas

esignaturas pare greduarse de médico, Como es un cubano demécrata, aprobé to-

das, menos una, que no quiso exaninar, para no coger el titulo do médice bajo el |

réginen comunista, cosa que Fepugnaba @ su conciencia, pero cuando los dirigente: :

Fensable para continuar le carrera. £1 alumo que no poséa el sprobado en la

misma, jands sera médico, no importa que sea brillante en Patologia o Terapéuti-

esignatura, As{ que lo que se quiere obtener por el régimen es un tipo de né~

nista y no a los canones sagrados del clésico arte de curar.

Todas estas cosas han dado origen a un tipo especial: de’ médico, que el pueblo L

importa que el ainmno tenga una gran vocacién por los estudios médicoa, no
importa que haya demostrado su capacidad en la materia que son propise de la
Medicina, si no tiene aptitudes de alpinista o no quiere hacer la gran esca~

servar del tezor casi sagrado con que son mirados estos médicos denowinados

Los nédicos cubanos, como clase habfan llegado a uma organizacién modcio an

similares de otros paises, tal era el Colegio Médico Weoional (autigua Zeie~_
Facién Médica do Cuba) que agrupaba hacie el afio 1959 unos 7,000 médicos ou-

anos. Asi como bajo su’ actuacién se obtuvieron una serie de conjuistas la~

““borales y un ansiado Retiro Kédico para 1a hora del desoanso y de la vejez.

Tribunales de Distiplina, que velaban por el estricto cumplimiento méaico, os

decir agrupaciones con criterios disimiles en cuanto a la orientacién de Ja

"medicina como clase, independientes de todo lo que significara militancia ao-

versity of Havana

: @ days In the late 1930's at the Facultad de Medicina. Ui
After Bustamante's graduation tn’ 1339 and
graduation in 1940, thelr professional contacts stilt: continued although thelr

folitical persuastons were quite different, From 1359 or 1969 to August 1361,

id little or no contact with Bustamante. and since
when-he left Cuba for permanent residence In the US
Fiest-hand knowledge of Bustamante's activities, TI formation which he pro-
vided on Bustamante Is presented below and is dated between the late 1330's and

1154/1360.

3. Or. Bustamante was born about 1911 In Havana and has lived there al}
of bis life. He never knew his father. He made his home with his so-called
aunt, who was locally belleved to be his natural mother. tls aunt {s no lonjer
living. The uncertainty about his ancestry has constantly plagued Bustamante,
ane [ie cinnnniHiainiette anageets that it may be one of the motivating factors
In his personality. | ‘

4, Or, Bustamante Is married to the former Haria Luisa Rodriquez-Colunble,
a native of Barracoa, Cuba. It Is commnly believed that Marla Luisa Is part
Negro, Lending credence to this statement Is the fact that -Macla Lulsa: kept her
mother completely in the background and never brought her ‘to Havana vhere she

: would have become known to Marla Luisa's and Jose's frients.

Sugjests that Harla Luisa's excessive concern over her antecedents probably matl-
vates her aggressiveness. In seeking high social position. in the community. Har
brother ts Or. /fny/ Rodriquez-Columble, a child psychiatrist, who Is a well=
known homosexual. aie *

5. Or. and Mrs. Bustamante have tro children, both of -whom have been
enrolled In the best Roman Catholic private schools In Havana, Thelr daughter
is row about 13 years old and Is described as being a fretty, healthy teenayer,
Their son, Jose, Jr., Is about 19 or 20. years of age and Is very effeminate in
manner. Dr, Bustamante’ Is known to have been worried about his son's personality
Problems when the boy was nine years old and his classmates taunted him as being
a-sissy. - In the Intervening years, Jose. Jr. has become a homosexual and has. -
been under the psychiatric core of, first, his father, who was not successful In
treating him, and more recently of Dr. Carlos Acostaclladal and of Dr. /fnu/
Soraéyul (now deceased). “On many occasions, Or, Bustarante complained to our

informant that his son was frequently Involved in scrapes ond had caused him
a great deal of trouble. n nts eta ner sos esarett that Marla Lulsa’s
attitude towards and relationship with her son may have a strong bearing on

the latter's behaviour. He also suggests that Marla Luisa, but not Jose, Srey
Is vulnerable where thelr son, Jose, Jr., 1s concerned, /The subject of sexual

aberrations ‘cama up several’ times during this Interview. {t seems appropriate
to point out hero that, according t there are many homo=
sexuals among current Cuban governnent officials and the possible exposure as

deviates would not serve as a threat to the securliy of these Individuals. He
states that homosexuality is glven no importance in Castro's Cuba./

6, The Bustamonte marital union has not run smogthly, to say the least.
fn 1945 or 1946, Jose, Sr. had an affair with Mrs. /fnu/ AL ez-Tabio «hich
become a “public scandal," as the saying goes In Cuba. Hrs. Alvarez-Tablo
ettempted sulcide and cave very cldse to death. While Jose, Sr. is know to
have had affairs with other women both before and since fils Maison with
Urs, Alvarez-Tablo, the onc In which he was Involved betreen 1951 and 1360
(and possibly later) brought him the. greatest amount of notorlety. Unfortu-
nately, |cannot recall the name of this mistress. On one
occasion, Dr. Bustamante and his Inamorata registered as man.and wife In a.
Hew York Clty hotel. .The lady's husband sot wind of thelr whereabouts, had
private detectives to obtain compromising photographs, and precipitated
Pr. Bustamante's local arrest and detention on several charges. The Jatter put
up.ball, but subsequently fled the US before the case came to trbal, When he
was President of the Cuban Medical Association, Bustamante tried to use his prom

_ fessional influence to solve the problem of his being a fuyltive fron justice

so that he could travel to the US with impunity. His efforts to exert pressure
on certain Iaportent officials met with no success. The mistress was divorced
by her husband and continued her relatfonship with Bustanante, as recently as
1360 and possibly later. She Is reported to have become a “mental case."

7. During the course of this latter affair, Jose, Sr. “and Maria tuisa’”
‘on 8 few occasions came almost to the point of divorce. But, by then he had
become a man of some Importance In the Castro regime and for appearances’ sake
they rematned together. As recently as 1960, Maria tulsa spoke vehemently
against Jose, Sr. In priva while In public she tried to make It appear that
all was well In thelr menag as no first-hand knowledge
of Or, Bustamante's extramarital fs since 1351." From refugees why
left Cuba tn recent years, however, he learned that Or, and Mrs, Bustamante
still Hive tn thelr large residence in Miramar, located on 12th Street between
first and’ Third Avenue, Havana. eae

8. Or. Bustamante obtained his medical education at the University oF
Havena and recelved his HO degree from that Institution In 1939. He was one
of the fifteen outstanding medical students. tn his class. He interned at the
University hospital In Havana. His specialty 1s psychiatry and his practice

12s Dr. Bustamante's actions during the Batista regime are of Interest.
Batisca's mother-in-law (the mother of his third wife, Harta Fernandez de Battsta)
worked In some capacity for Maria tulsa Rodriguez Columble de Bustamante absut
this time and, on the surface, the Batista and Bustamante fami iles vcre on
friendly terms. llowever,. In reality, Jose, Sr. was vorking against Batista as
a menber of the underground group, Monte. Cristo, ‘headed by the el f-lnain
dusto Carrillo. At the same time, he malntained contact with the Communist
Party and Is known to have had private meetings on a continuing basis during the
Batista regime with Carlos Font, now /1966/ Vice Minister of Health, and Jove
Lopez Sanchez, current Vice President of the Cuban Academy of Sclences.

13, When Fidel Castro cama to Power, Bustamante's potential was brouyht
to the attention of Raul Castro. He offered to take charge of the brainwashing
actlvitles of the G-2 and thus put Into Practice the techniques he had learned
from Kira-Lopez. He was subsequently put In charge of ‘such work and ‘was assisted
fn ft by Drs. Acostactodal. and Soracgut. After Dr. Soraegul's. death, Riul Castro

" went’ to the latter 's office and supervised the removal 8f patients". Files, abvi=

ousty for future use in bublding up dossiers on the subjects, z

m, Pointed out that, also after the Castro takes”
over, Bustamante wanted to sade Director of the Mental Hospital fn Mazorra,:
elght miles outside of Havana. The position was given instead to Dr. Ordaz,
who tad fought with Castro In the Sterra Haestra; At first, Bustamante come

plained bitterly about losing out, but since then he fas*not asked for or -
otherwise sought another similar. Important Professional post.

Sugyests that Bustamante most probably has been told that: he Ts Perforaing
en Important military service for the reglms ard therefore {t. would be wise for
hin to remain In the background. He further states that Bustamante Is believed
to exert. 3 considerable amount of Influence Inthe Ministry of Health, although
he holds: no officiel position In It. It should be noted: that Bustamante's
Importance In the regiae,~ however great, stems_principally: fram his usefulness
to Raul Castro. Bustemante ts current 'y £1966/ considered: to be one of the 10
Rost effective enemlas In the regine of the non-Conmunist Cuban doctors.

“ 15. OF. Bustemanta ts not belleved to be in‘any sort of financtat
trouble. As his professional stature grew and his wealth Increased, he and his
wife soon acquired a taste for a luxurious way of. tlie. They bought  pre-
tentlous home In an exclusive.residential section of Havana, bought s Cadillac,
and enrolled thelr children in select, private schools. They both are drives

by ambitions for social prestige and high political position. They crave money
end power, want to be assoclated with those at’ the highest” echelon in’ the regime,
and, above all, are opportunists of the first water. Marla Lulsa his always
longed to bea menber of the Jockey Club and'of the Liceo (a ladies" cultura}

President of it. Then, In 1960, Harta Luisa was made interventor of all. private
