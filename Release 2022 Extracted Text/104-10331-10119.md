Appreciation for Thomas Crispell

1.

This is to convey our appreciation for the fine briefing

that Tom Crispell provided on 16 October to the JFK Assassination

Records Review Board (ARRB) . The Board was appointed by

President Clinton under a statue establishing the Board to

oversee the release of all government records related to the

assassination of President Kennedy.

The briefing was part of a

program that included a meeting with Executive Director Slatkin,

the DDO, and the General Counsel.

Judge John Tunheim (ARRB Chairman) and the other four

Board members, as well as their Executive Director and General

Counsel, all told me that they found Tom's briefing interesting

and informative. They appreciated Tom's helpful responses to the

various questions that they asked about the functions and

organization of the Ops Center.

Tom's performance was professional and reflected a good

knowledge of his responsibilities. His enthusiasm and ability to

put the activities of the Ops Center in perspective clearly made

a positive impression on the visitors.

4. Thanks for making Tom available for the Board's visit.

His efforts contributed to the good relationship that the Agency

has maintained with the Board.
