bad about 5 drinks befare ba and RASKE finally left. Source retarted to

COLOB earlier that de vas not sure that be vould be able to manage tbo

any special problem and asted him to come to the soviet Bubassy tbe

the USSR add back vithout cast... At one point in the conversation after they

study and sald

to his, "this RASXS 1s a svide."

constantly with such people but resents the fact that his vife must mingle

with them socially.

Communists politically but that they cannot be trusted.

8. The conversation became quite free as the three sen drank a l1ter

of champagne and a firth of Stotch.

The vives conversed very little during

the evening.

States--how much professors are paid, bor many cars Asericans own, etc. At

first be asked the questions for the purpose of pointing out tbat conditions

vere better In the USSR, but later said that be bad bad a number of alscon-

ceptions about the United States and warmed up someubat. He said that be

bad never set an Aserican faully and Source felt that his curtosity vas

genuine.

The three discussed their general backgrounds freely. In all tbelr

conversations they used finalsh, which both of the soriets nev ratber vell.

They did not appear to know other languages.

Both had apparently been in

Belsinkl for a number of years, and source doubted 11 they had been assigned
