You may soon be sent to Vietnam. You have heard about the war in the news; your
officers will give you pep talks about it. But you probably feel as confused and uncertain
about it as most Americans do. Many people will tell you to just follow orders und leave
the thinking to others. But you have the right to know as much about this war a: anyone
else. After all, it's you---not your congres sman---who might get killed.

WHY ARE WE. FIGHTING IN VIETNAM ?

We are supposed to be fighting to protect democracy in Vietnam, and yet our own
government admits that South Vietnam is a dictatorship. General Ky,.the latest military
dictator. is as bad as they come. - Insert here quote about Ky admiring Hitler ete. -

General Ky doesn't mean much to us; we're not even sure how to pronounce his name.
@ut the South Vietnamese have lived under him and men like him for ten years. As far
as they are concerned, we are fighting on the side of Hitlerism; and they hope we lose.

WHO IS THE ENEMY ?

U.S. military spokesmen have often said that their greatest problem is finding the
enemy. "The enemy" they say, "is everywhere."' The old woman feeding her chickens
may have a stock of hand grenades in her hut. The little boy who trails after the America
soldiers during the day slips out to give information to the guerillas at night. The .
washerwoman at the American air base brings a bomb to work one day. "It is impossible
says the militafz. "to tell who is the. Viet Cong and who is the people."

And so, because the whole Vietnamese people seems to be the enemy, the military
is taking no chances. They use tear gas---a weapon only used against civilian populations:
never against soldiers. They order American troops to fire at women and children---
because women and children, after all, are firing at American troops. American fighter
planes destroy civilian villages with napalm; American Bd2s are flattening whole regions.
That is why the war in Vietnam is so often called a "dirty war."

When the South Vietnamese people see you in your foreign uniform, they will think of
you as theirenemy. You are the ones bombing their towns. They don't know whether
yor're a draftee or a volunteer, whether you're for the war or against it; bat they're not
taking any chances either.

FREE ELECTIONS

The Vietnamese would dearly like to vote the foreigners out of their country, but
they have never had the chance. According to the Geneva Agreement of 1954, there were
supposed to be elections throughout Victnam in 1956, But the U.S. government was
afraid that our man in Vietnam, Premier Diem, would lose. In fact, President Fisentow
himself admitted that "Ho Chi Minh... . 80%" (Eisenhower quote). So we decided not to
allown any election there until we were sure we could win. Diem set up a political police

aud pul all polit
it was clear that there weren't going to be elections, and the guerillas known as the
Viel Cong began to fight back. By 1963 our govermment.was fed up with Diem, but still
wasn't willing to risk elections. Our CLA helped a group of Vietnamese generals to over-
throw Dien and kill him. Since then there have been a series of "better" military
dictators. General Ky---the man who admires Hitler---is the latest one.

FIGHTIUG FOR DEMOCRACY

Your job as a soldier is supposed to be "'to win the peopte of South Vietnam." Win
them to what? Not democracy. We keep democracy for ourselves---they get’, military
dictators. What then? The American way of life ? But why should they care sny more
alout that than we care about the Vietnamese way of life? We can't speak their. language
or even pronounce their names. We don't know anything about theiy religion or even what
‘it is. We never even heard of Vietnam until Washington decided to run it. :

You are supposed to:be fighting to save the Vietnamese people from Communism. Ae
Certainly Communist influence is very strong in the National Liberation Front, the rebel
government. Yet most of the people support the NLF. Why? Many of the same people
who now lead the NLF led the Vietnamese independence movement against the Japanese
during World War II and then went on to fight against French colonial rule. Most Vietname:
think of the NLF leaders as their country's outstanding patriots. In fact, many anti-
Communists have joined the guerilla forces in the belief that the most important thing is
to get rid of foreign domination and military dictators. On the other hand, very few
Vietnamese support the official government of General Ky. His army has low morale and
a high desertion rate.

THE TOUGH GUERILLAS

The newspapers and television have told us again and agian what a brave, tough fighter

_ the Vietnamese guerilla is. Short of ammunition and without any air cover, he can beat

forces that outnumber him five or ten to one. . Why do they ave such high morale? They
are not draftees; no draftees ever fight like that. They are not high-paid, professional
soldiers; most of them are peasants who work their fields. ‘They are not well-trained;
they can't even spare the ammunition for target practice.

“Their secret is that they know why they are fighting. They didn't hear about Vietnam
in the newspapers; they've lived there all their lives.. While we were in high school,
they were living under the Diem regime and hating it. Now American planes are bombing
their towns and strafing their fields; American troops have occupied their country; and if
they complain out loud, an American- supported dictator sentences them to jail or the
firing squad. .Is it any wonder that they fight so fiercely ?

CRUSHING THE RESISTANCE i

The war in Vietnam is not being fought according to the rules. Civilians are gassed.
Prisoners are tortured. Our planes drop incendiary bombs on civilian villages. Our
soldiers shoot at women and children. Your officers will tell you that it is all necessary,
that we couldn't win the war any other way. And they are right. Americans are no more |
cruel than any other people; American soldiers don't enjoy this kind of war. But if you
are going to wage war against an entire people, you have to become cruel. The ordinary
German soldier in occupied Europe wasn't especially cruel, either. But as the eases

|

movements grew, he became cruel. He shot at women and children because they were
shooting at him; he never asked himself why they were shooting at him. When a certain
town became a center of resistance activity, he followed his orders and destroyed the

Fray 266

whole town. He knew that SS men were torturing captured resistance fighters, but it
wasn't his business to interfere. ee : v

FOLLOWING ORDERS

As a soldier you have been trained to obey orders, but as a human being you must

take responsibility for your own acts. International and American law recognize that

an individual soldier, even if acting under orders, must bear final legal and moral re-
-sponsibility for what he does. This principle became a part of law after World War I, |
_when the Allied nations, meeting in London, decided that German war criminals must H
be punished even if they committed war crimes under orders. This principle was the
basis of the Nuremberg trials. We believe that the entire war in Viet:nam is criminal

and immoral. We believe that the atrocities which are necessary to wage this war
“against the people of Vietnam are inexcusable.

OPPOSE THE WAR

‘Ve hope that you too find yourself, as a human being, unable to tolerate this night-
ma: ‘» war—we hope that you will oppose it. We don't know what kind of risks we are
taki.g in giving you this leaflet; you won't know what risk you will be taking in opposing:
the war. Several GIs have already refused to,fight in Vietnam and have been court-
martialed.: They have shown great courage. We believe that they, together with other

*.courageous men who will join them, will have influence far out of proportion to their
numbers.

There may be many other things you can do; since you are in the service, you know
better than civilians what sorts of opposition are possible. But whatever you do, keep
your eyes open. Draw your own conclusions from the things you see, read and hear.

ied ‘At orientations sessions, don't be afraid to ask questions, and if you're not
satisfied with the answer, keep asking. Take every chance you get to talk to your fellow
soldiers about the war. Demand to hear civilian speakers who oppose the war debate
military spokesmen.

You may feel the war is wrong, and still decide not to face a courtmartial. You may
then find yourself in Vietnam under orders. You will have to do some fighting—-but don't
do any more than you have to. Good luck. Z

was distributing the leaflets at the Oakland Induction Center on
the morning in question. SF T-18 added he was also present at
the Oakland Induction Center on the particular morning; however,
he did not distribute any of the leaflets.

A review of the printed leaflet, "ATTENTION ALL MILITARY
PERSONNEL” indicated it was printed by the Berkeley Free Press.

SF T-18 informed on May 16, 1966, that the Berkeley Free

The April 6, 1960, edition of "The New York Times"
newspaper contained a full-page advertisement captioned
“What Is Really Happening in Cuba," placed by the Fair Play
for Cuba Committee (FPCC). This advertisement announced
the formation of the FPCC in New York City and declared the
FPCC intended to promulgate “the truth about revolutionary
Cuba" to neutralize the distorted American press.

“The New York Times" edition of January 11, 1961,
reported that at a hearing conducted before the United States
Senate Internal Security Subcommittee on January 10, 1961,

Dr. CHARLES A. SANTOS-BUCH identified himself and ROBERT TABER
as organizers of the FPCC. He also testified he and TABER
obtained funds from the Cuban Government which were applied
toward the cost of the aforementioned advertisement.

On May 16, 1963, a source..advised that during the
irst two years of the FPCC's existence there was a struggle
between Communist Party (CP) and Socialist Workers Party (SWP)
elements to exert their power within the FPCC and thereby
influence FPCC policy. This source added that during the
Past year there had been a successful effort by FPCC leadership
to minimize the role of these and other organizations in the
FPCC so that their influence as of May, 1963, was negligible.

The SWP has been designated by the Attorney
General of the United States pursuant to
Executive Order 10450,

On May 20, 1963, a second source advised that
VINCENT "TED" LEE, FPCC National Office Director, was then
formulating FPCC policy and had indicated that he had no
intention of permitting FPCC policy to be determined by any
other organization. This source stated that LEE believed
that the FPCC should advocate resumption of diplomatic
relations between Cuba and the United States and should
support the right of Cubans to manage their revolution without
interference from other nations. LEE did not advocate <
supporting the Cuban revolution per se.

| that Senator DODD was a member of the Ssanate Inte 1

FPCC.

The December 27, 1963, edition of “The New York
World Telegram and Sun" newspaper stated that the pro-Castro
FPCC was seexing to go out of business and that its prime
activity during its lifetime had been sponsorship of pro-
Castro street rallies and mass picket lines, and the direction
of an active propaganda mill highlighting illegal travel-to-
Cuba campaigns. Its comparatively brief span of life was
attributed to mounting anti-Castro American public opinion,
the 1962 Congressional hearings which disclosed FPCC financing
by Castro's United Nations Delegation, end ultimately, the
bad publicity which the FPCC received from disclosure of
activities on its behalf by suspected Presidential assassin
-LEE H. OSWALD.

On February 6, 1964, the previously mentioned
second source advised that V. T. LEE had recently remarked
that the FPCC was dead and that there were no plans to
organize another similar organization.

there had not been any FPCC activity in many months and that

Wl. E. B. DU BOTS CLUBS OF AMERICA (BCA)

A source has advised that on October 26-27, 1963, a
conference of members of the Communist Party (CP), including national
functionaries, met in Chicago, Illinois, for the purpose of setting
in motion forces for the establishment of a new national Marxist-
oriented youth organization which would hunt for the most peaceful
transition to socialism. The delegates to this meeting were
cautioned against the germ of anti-Soviet and anti-CP ideologies,
These delegates were also told that it would be reasonable to assume
that the young socialists attracted into this new organization
would eventually pass into the CP itself.

A second conference of over 20 persons met in Chicago
on December 28-29, 1963, for the purpose of initiating. a "call"
to the new youth organization and planning for a founding convention
to be held in June, 1964.

A second source has advised that the founding convention

‘for the new youth organization was held from June ‘19-21, 1964,

at 150 Golden Gate Avenue, San Francisci, California, at which
time the name W. E. B, DuBois Clubs of America (DCA) was adopted.
Approximately 500 delegates from throughout the United States
attended this convention. The aims of this organization, as set
forth in the preamble to the constitution are, "It is our ‘belief
that this nation can best solve its problems in an atmosphere of
peaceful coexistence, complete disarmament and true freedom for all
peoples of the world, and that these solutions will be reached
mainly through the united efforts of all democratic elements in
our country, composed essentially of the working people allied in
the unity of Negroes and other minorities with whites. We further
fully recognize that the greatest threat to American democracy
comes from the racist and right wing forces in coalition with the

_ most reactionary sections of the economic power structure, using the

tool of anti-Communism to divide and destroy the unified struggle

of the working people. As young people in the forces ‘struggling

for democracy, we shall actively strive to defeat these reactionary
and neo-fascist elements and to achieve complete freedom and
democracy for all Americans, thus enabling each individual to freely
choose and build the society he would wish to live in. Through
these struggles we feel the American people will realize the
viability of the socialist alternative."
