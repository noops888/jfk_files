CG. 6498-PC was contacted by SA WILLIAM F. ROEMER, on

11/25/63, but at that time had no personal knowledge of RUBY. On

- 11/26/63, CG 6498-PC advised that he had solicited information. from
politicians of the 2lth Ward, the forner voting residence of RUBY.
PC advised that he talked to two persons who appeared to know RUBY
from many years ago. They advised that RUBY was never anything but
“a punk" and never had any hoodlum connections or associations. One
person advised that he recalls thet RUBY attempted to sneak into a
prize fight in Chicago, believed to be the second DEMPSEY - TUNNEY
fight, and was ceught by a police officer who beat him over the head
with his night stick. As a result of this beating, RUBY now has a
plate in his head. Apparently this causes pressure when RUBY becomes
excited and causes RUBY to act emotionelly.
