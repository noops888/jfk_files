requests for information concerning his father, Winston
McKinley Scott ("Winston Scott"). I understand that Scott

(requesting all information on Winston Scott) and 93-1040
(requesting re-review of Winston Scott's unpublished
manuscript) .

request number 91-1231 is completed, pending referral of two
documents for coordination to the PBI and the Department of
the Navy. During the processing of FOIA request 91-1231,
Winston Scott's affiliation with the CIA became publicly
acknowledged pursuant to information releases processed by
the Historical Review Group under the Assassination Records
Collection Act ("ARCA"). Pursuant to ARCA, certain chapters
of Wineton Scott's manuscript also were released in full. :

Specifically, would it be possible to release the documents
for which the CIA has completed processing (request number
91-1231) and to request that the other two referrant
agencies (PBI and Navy) respond directly to Scott, in view
of the unusual equities in this case? As always, your

Subject: Request from Scott's son

The HSCA-orginated material in the CIA JFK Collection
and HSCA documents referred to the CIA by NARA are scheduled
for review later this year. I expect copies of the two
documents mentioned in Mark Zaid's letter to be within this
material. However, there is no inventory of this materials
and a search could be very time consuming.

HSCA documents referred to the CIA by NARA are usually
held at NARA for review by an HRG reviewer (John C). NARA
has sent some documents (mainly testimonies) directly to HRG
but two documents are not among them.

The HSCA report on Oswald in Mexico city was released
in August 1993. The pages attached to Zaid's letter are
from that report.

We could ask NARA to pull the two documents and send
them over for review. Otherwise, they will be released
later this year.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Fred Wickham on

FROM: Barry Harrelson

SUBJECT: ARRB Request re Angelton and Scott

1. Jeremy Gunn, ARRB staff, has requested (via
telephone) access to the following files/documents: fd

a. Winston Scott documents, including the entire

manuscript_It Came to Little, and personal effects seized on

Winston Scott's death; © 3

ib. files of James Angelton housed ‘in the CI
vault. - :

2.  As(Linda CGipriani/ handled the recent FOIA.
litigation brought by Michael Scott (Win's son) for all
documents on his. father,(Linda}has copies of documents
responsive to Gunn's first request: in her office. I have
spol en. with (inda\ and we agree that, with your concurrence,
the best coursé of action would be to have Gunn view the
Scott: documents and manuscript at OGC. You should be aware
that during the course of that litigation, searches were
conducted to locate personal effects seized by CIA upon
Scott's death. Those effects were never located, but a
destruction record that seems to refer to these personal
effects was located and provided to OGC. Gunn would need
access to that destruction record as well. Sia

3. The second request of Gunn also was an issue in
the Scott FOIA litigation. At that time the DO told IP&CRD
that all Angelton documents were sorted through in the 1970s
and that a separate CI Angelton holding no longer exist.
Official files were incorporated into DO record system and
material not deemed to be official records were destroyed.
To the ‘extent that any destruction records exist on™
Angelton's records, Jeremy would like to see these as well.

i and I suggest that the DO search for any such’
destruction records and forward them to OGC. In this way,
Jeremy can view them at the same time he views the Scott
documents.

4. Jeremy has agreed that if CIA allows him to view
the above records "informally" and he finds nothing that
relates to the assassination, then he will not make an
“official request" for these records. Of course, any
records he believes to be relevant, he will have to make an
official request and they will then become part of the JFK
Collection.

DRAFT NOTES BY TIG FOR ASSASSINATION RECORDS REVIEW EOARD
JANUARY 13, 1997

On January 13, 1997, Michelle Cambs and Jeremy Gunn from the ARRB Staff reviewed the files
of Winston McKinley Scott at CLA headquarters in Langley, Virginia. The General Counsel's office
stated that that the files presented for our examination are the “complete” files known to the CIA on Scott.

‘The documents total approximatily 6 inches, and include:

(1) A manuscript entitled “It Came to Little,” by Ian Maxwell (pseud.), which contains 221
enumerated pages, The foreword to the manuscript states that the events recounted therein contain “no
exaggerations and no deviations from basic truth:” (unpaginated forward). It reveals that some true,
names have been used, and that thie has been dons without ths consent af the persons named. The author
expresses his “most sinceré admiration and utmost respect for: Mr. John Edgar Hoover, Director, Federal ~

Bureau of Investegation [sic]; Mr, James R. Murphy, wartime director of OSS/X-2; and » the
Tate Allen. Welsh Dulles, OSS Chief in Switzerland during World War I, a principal ith
‘¢reation af CIA for President Harry Truman and the Greatest Director CIA has*had.” The author

the blight of communiam, and the courageous people who have worked to fight it, but nevertheless
Concludes that “all the effort {to thwart Communism] has come to little.” (unpaginated forward)

There is only one chapter that makes any identifiable reference to the assassination of President
Kennedy and to the eventa related to Mexico City at the time Lee Harvey Oswald was alleged to have
visited. That chapter has been roleased in full to thé public,

(2) A Supplemental Declaration of J. Barry Harrelson from the case Michael Scottv. CIA, CA.
No, 1:95C'V00686 with attached docuinents. ‘The attached documents contain documents released in full
and some that are redacted. Acéording to CIA, all redacted documents are a part of the JFK collection,
This should be confirmed, If they are part of the collection, no further steps need be taken, ‘Ifnot, they
must be fully reviewed to determine whether they sire assassination recordg,

3) Documents that appear to be copies of the personnel file of Win Scott. All of the documents
in this file were reviewed to determine whether any assassination records are included. Our review
disclosed no “assassination records.” Although not assassination records, the following information was
located in the personnel file:

-- The records disclose that during World War II, while in the employ of the FBI, Scott worked in
“connection with espionage and subversive activities” and in “counterespionage” while based.in Havana.

= Document, dated 7/23/69, refers to the possibility that CLA might attempt to recruit Scott for
the “Civilian Reserve Program (HR 20-15) following his retirement from the agency.

— On May 6, 1969, Scott was recommended for a Distinguished Intelligence Medal by William
V. Broe, who was then Chief of WH. The recommendation includes the following statement:

“Mr. Scott built a large and highly effective organization targeted against highest priority
national security targets, namely, the Soviet bloc presence south of the border. Given the nature
of the target, Mr. Scott mofded his station with a predominantly CI orientation until it has
become a highly effective counterintelligence mechanism capable of covering Soviet Bloc and
Cuban [activitiog].”

His Citation for the Distinguished Intelligence Medal includes the following statement:

“[H]e has served brilliantly in Mexico for aver twelve years where among other things he has
built a remarkable counterintelligence machine—a trus bulwark helping to guard our southern
border, His station hai long been a showcase of technical intelligence methods as well as
classical operations.”

— There ig no record in the file that suggests, one way or thé other, that Mr, Scott was eve
treated for or suffered from any mental or emotional issue.

Unless the following are already part of the JFK collection, they should be designated “assassination
records” and processed under the JFK Act. i

DRAFT NOTES BY TJG FOR ASSASSINATION RECORDS REVIEW BOARD
JANUARY 15, 1997

Cleveland Cram
Tadiled QSetory of old Ci sa (eglaning te ddan of Aagioneh
11 Volumes (¢. 1981)

Albert S. Bonner

A

2 volumes (July, 1993)

The ARRB requested access to any and all internal CLA histories of the CI staff for the purpose of
determining whether they contain any information that would be useful for understanding the
assassination of President Kennedy, including, for example, the activities of Lee Harvey Oswald, the
structure of CI with respect to the components of the affice that had responsibility for handling Oswald’a
file at different times (particularly C1/SIG), and any aspect of HTLINGUAL related to Because
the Agency keeps these histories closely held, it was believed that they are relatively more tobe
candid assessments of Cl and its activitics than one might obtain from more widely circulate circulate documbate,

Twas provided complete access to the entire 11 volumes of Cleveland Cram’s (untitled) history of the old
Cl staff.” The Cram history covers counterintelligence at the CLA from its origins to the departure of
James Jesus Angleton. The histories appear as typed legal-aize pages in green, cardboard folders. The.
first volume is hand dated (1981) and signed “Cleveland Cram.” There are 1063 pages in the Cram
history. I was also provided complete access to Al Bonner’s history of counterintelligence, which starts
with the departure of Angleton and continues to the present,

By all appearances, the histories appear to be relatively candid assessments of CL I was able to identify
information that illuminated some of the iasues of concer, and thogo will be outlined below, I identified
‘no information that would lead to any significant reevaluation of the role of CI in issues related to Oswald
‘or to the assassination, For the purpose of understanding the assassination of the President or the other
issues that come within the scope of the Review Board's mandate — other than the information identified
below 1 do not believe that the histories themselves, nor coples of any of the pages af the historics,
would provide any significant useful additional information that would enhance the understanding of the
‘assassination and I see no noed for any further information to be released from the histories, 2f ia my
Preliminary udgment that the page number highlighted below should be copled and atached tothe
memorandum so that they can be made public.

The information contained in the histories consists largely of case studies of important counterintelligence
activities, As a rule, thé histories do not describe the structure of the Cl affices, the personnel, the filing
system, or operations generally -- although discussion of some of thes¢ issues arises. The principal
‘sources used by the authors consisted of documents from CI and interviews with officers. There are
relatively few footnotes and the citations are, accordingly, quite thin. There are, for example, only 8
footnotes in volume 1, which themselves are sketchy. The points that enhance the historical ,
understanding of the assassination are:

1, The introduction to Cram’s history refers to an earlier CI history that was written by a person
who was provided only limited access to Angleton and the files, The author of the firet history
was given, for example, no access to any CI/SIG documents, Cram, accordingly, found the

history to be unhelpful for understanding sensitive CI activities. (Cram, p, 1-2). There are
references to two additional documents that should be requested: the Goleniewski study on
Golitsyn (1975) and the John Hart study on Nosenko (called the “Monster Plot” ). (Charles
Battaglia, Staff Director of the SCI, told me that the ARRB should request the Monster Plot for
review under the JFK Act.)


13-00000

te JAN 27 '97 10:25AM USGOVERNMENT P.S/B8

= SECRET

2, There is a reference to a 1959 IG survey of CI which should be requested for review. (See,
e.g., Cram 47, 56

3. The 1959 1G analysis stated the within the Cl staff, “96 were professionals, 75 clerical and
four staff agents. ‘The Staff also had one Headquarters contract agent, and several agents under
projects.” (Cram, 48),

4. There is a discussion of the Special Investigations Unit (circa 1959) and HTLINGUAL,”
Coples of pages 49-51, and $5, which describe the STU and HTLINGUAL, should be evaluated to
détermine whether they contribute to understanding of relevant issues, te

5. Angleton was on sick leave from the agency from May, 1960 to 12 January 1961. During
Angleton’s absence, 5. Herman Horton was Acting Chief and James Hunt was Acting Deputy
Chief. Hunt subsequently became the regular deputy and served until 1969,(Cram,, $8).

6, Routine liaison with FBI was conducted by Jano Roman “from the late 1940s onward... .

(Cram, 70). Ser ae wa bn oe, yng rn (ra) igh
this practice “did not develop until the early 1960s after the defection of Golitsyn . .

n).

7, The activities of CI/SIG are described on pp. 144-48, Cram’s cited sources are the 1955 and
1973 descriptions of its activities. It should be decided whether these two pages should be copied
for attachment to this memo.

I did not find that the references to Nasenko provided additional information that enhances the historical
understanding of the assassination. Mr. Angleton's testimony to the Church Committee is much more
illuminating in that regard.

‘The Bonner history, although after the period of Oswald and the assassination, discusses the issues of the
disposition of the files of James Jesus Angleton and a few other matters. Because of ths speculation about
the contents of the files, discussions af their disposition would seem to be relevant. The pertinent points

are as follows:

‘Bonner volume I:

1, Bonner describes the CI staff, at the departure of Angleton, as being seriously unorganized
and as beltig intellectually detached from the work of the agency, Gonner, p. 16-8).

2. ‘The Angleton office files were voluminous and in disarray at the time of his departure from
the Agency. It may be appropriate to make copics of pp. I:8 (last paragraph) up to the last
paragraph on p. 14, 53-87 to illustrate this,

3, “[Fliles were found on the assassinations of President John F. Kennedy and his brother Robert
F. Kennedy, These included autopiy pictures of the remains af Robert Kennedy. Although
Nosenko's account of the KGB's involvement with Lee Harvey Oswald and his denial that the
KGB had anything to do with the murder of John Kennedy might reasonably explain an
Angleton interest in the John Kennedy assassination, neither Kalaris nor Blee, with whom.
Kalaris consulted on this bizarre finding, had any idea why Angleton had the pictures. Neither
could they think of any reason why it was appropriate for CI Staff files to contain them. They
‘were accordingly destroyed.” (Bonmer, p. 1:11). I subsequently interviewed Bonner, who told me


13-00000

“2, JAN 27-797 18:26AM USGOVERNMENT

_ > ep pnrt

that he had spoken to Kalaris and Blee about this, and neither man could remember anything in
the files except the Robert Kennedy photographs.

4. The files revealed evidence that Angleton ran “countorintelligence [operations] abroad as
Chief of the CI Staff in the way in which the local statlon would be effectively cut out and _
command cliannél and communications would run direct to counterintelligence headquarters in
Washington.” (Gonner, p, 1:22.) (sic). I believe Bonner is saying the following: Angleton ran
counterintelligence operations abroad as Chief of the CI Staff in such way that local stations
‘would be effectively cut out; command channel and communications would run direct to
counterintelligerice headquarters in Washington.

s. Bonner cites two examples where Angleton ran laicon with flendly goveraments without the
local station chiefs being specifically aware of Angleton’s activitics, The station chiefs found this
“frustrating.” (Bonner, pp, 1:25-26),

6. (Circa.1976) “[Hjandling [FOIA requests for information cancerning Lee H Oswald]
required the creation of a task force of 13 operations officers and analysts, plus Deron,
‘and their fill-tisne efforts for over a month,” Gonner, p. 3:67.) oe

2 Discussion of activities of part of CI stuff circa 1976; “Double Agent Branch + was charged
services, the branch was very heavily a cootdinator rather than active runner of operations.”
@onner, p. 1:71).

8, Bonner refers to an August 1976 IG report cometimes called the Freer report. It analyzes

"s stewardship over Cl,comparcd to that of Kalaris, It discusses how Angleton ran Cl.
We should review this report, His cited in Mangold, Cold Warrior, at 316.)

Bonner volume II:

The only significant reference in Bonner pertains to the final completion of the review of the Angleton
files. (Bouner, p, 11:114)
