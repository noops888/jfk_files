MEMORANDUM FOR: Director of Personnel
Fred: :

1. The facts behind the question raised with the
Director by Mr. Maksymec on Saturday, 26 April, are,
according to him, as follows. iz

2. After NPIC had done its fine work during the
Cubin missile crisis it appears that two different types
of recognition were given. Determinations were made
first on Certain individuals whose contributions were
such that they should receive an Agency medal award. A '
second group of some 200 were then identified for their
level of. contribution and received some kind of certifi-
cate from the White House signed by the President. Mr.
Maksymec was in the latter group and espouses the cause
that a “special medallion" should have been given along
with the White House certificate. Mr. [_ Jalso
spoke to me’ on this matter on Saturday, and has a good
recollection onthe whole matter,

3. Will you do what you can on the matter and pre-
pare me a letter to be sent to Mr. Maksymec?

Of a request under the Freedoz af
Main Reception Interview Rooa at

Tae duration of the meeting was one (1) hour of waten tine
Ne. Makeymlec used aparoximately 7 to 3 minutes to quickly thunb-
thru the OPF. It is my impression that he was ourprised: 1) ve
Rizy Stlowing hin to see all the material in the tiie ( he ceseribed
vividly, @ 1971 unpleasant encounter vith Me, Fehols, the Director
of Fersonnel, vho refused to show him a document and would ont

reat to him @ small portion from tt - this caused his Feqi

subsequent interview with the OCI, Mr. Nelms), and 2) at the
reality that the file contained nothing actually derogatory
(ne stated he had geen and signed the fitness reports so these
represented nothing unknown),

The major portion of the time was consumed tn my listening
to. bis evaluation and assessment of the various supervisors and
co-workers at NPIC and thelr shortcomings. He regaled me vith
mush of bis background and’hiatory with the military and initial
application and entrance on duty with the Agency; his ‘personal

acquaintans:

COMMENTS OF REVIEWING OFFICIAL

I concur with the rater's comments. We have been making every effort
to aid Mr. Maksymiec in becoming an asset to RED as a laboratory technician.
To date, there has been little noticeable Progress; in fact, the temper out-
bursts mentioned above indicate a deteriorating condition. Unless this
situation improves, it may be necessary to recommend terwination action.

As. I have stated in previous comments, it's unfortunate that he cannot
find a position which takes advantage of his expertise in photography, since
this would go a long way to resolving his problems. :

GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY
WAOHINGTON, 0. ©. 20007

August 24, 1966

Name: Mr. Myroslaw A, Maksymiec

Ne. Myroslaw A. Maksymice, age N94 came to this Burcau on august 1,
1966, in connection with the Veterans Administration's educational and
vocational counseling prosran for formers, rvicemen. Mr, Maksymice ig
marricd, has two children,ayes Five and ef nt, and is employed by a federal
governmental agency as a photographic research technician (63 09/3). He
revived From the United states Aumy in 1961 in the grade of Master Sergeant
‘after serving for over 20 years with primary duties as an intelligence
Photographer. His education includes cight years of formal schooling, a
high school completion equivalence certificate, and additional courses with
the Graduate School, Department oF Agriculture, and the United States Armed
Forees Institute. Mr. Muksymice stated that he was interested in further
Cducation at the college level in order to improve himself both personally
and professionally in a field related to his present vocational activities,

qn addition to several conferences with the undersigned, Mr. Maksymiec
was administered a battery of educational and vocational tests. This report
Spatains the results. of these conferences and tests, the results of which
should not be interpreted either as conclusive or final, They should be
considered primarily as indications of various Psychological factors that
should be Seriously considered by. Mr. Maksymiee in making decisions concer-
ning his educational and vocational goals, EE

In order to determine Mr. Maksymice's fields of vocational ‘interest
he was given the Kuder Vécat ional pre When compared to a
seresentative group of men in the nationaL population, Mr. Maksymiec in-
dicated that his interests are Significantly similar to persons who are
gngaged in computational, scientific, and literary activities. Men who have
interests similar to Mr. ‘Maksymiec’s are found in various engineering fields,
astronomy, scismology, ‘economies, Psychology, and technical publ ications
writing. These fields are closely allied co his present occupational endeavors.

on the Educational Interest Inventory, a device that is beneficial
to an individual in discovering Iris interests in various fields of study,
Mr. Maksymiec's responses indicated that his Study interests are very high
in physics; high in engineering, chemistry, earth science, and history aol
Political science; high average’ in Somunication, zoology, and mathematics;
gnd average in psychology. The arcas in which he showed low to average
Anterest were music, education, industrial arts, agriculture, botany,
Sociology, literature, art, business administration, and economics. ~

Nr. Maksymice also took the Amy General Classification Test, Civilian
Gdition, to find out his overall level of mental ability, Wis score HeveaTed
that he exceeds approximately 78 percent of general mental capacity
as measured by this instrument, A safer evaluation of his performance ia
{hat he is probably in the upper 25 percent of adults regarding his global
intelligence.

an “instrument that attempts:

on the Michigan Vocabulary Pro
to measure a person's inte Tectual im as well as the amount of infor=
mation he-has retained in various areas of knowledge, Me. Maksyniec indicated,
when compared with college freshmen, that he cxceeds approximately 50 percent
in Mis Knowledge of human’ relations, 69 percent in government, and 67 percent
in the physical sciences. on ‘the jower sidc, he does as well or better than

24 percent in his familiarity with commerce, 31 percent in mathematics, and
24 percent in fine arts.

In order to find out Mr. Muksymicc’s ability to handle English, a
basic necessity for one to perform well in college, he was given the
Cooperative English Tests. when compared-to college freshmen, he showed that
he execeds from S2 percent to 78 percent in his unlevstanding of vocabulary;
from 5 to 17 percent in his ability to comprehend what he reads; From 2 to
iI percent in his speed of comprchension; and from 18 to 36 percent in his
overall ability to know and understand what he reads under timed conditions,
In his skill to express himself properly in English, he exceeds from 1 to ;
& percent of college freshmen. When reading and expression are combined !
info one score, it may be said that Mr. Maksymice exceeds from 6 to 12 per-
gent of college freshmen in his overall usage of fngiish.

|

The results of the above tests indicate that Mr. Maksymiec has made |

the most of his learning opportunities both within and outside the military |
service. Although he completed only eight years of school, he has acquired H
a ‘considerable amount of knowledge by observation, reading, and personal |
pxperience. In spite of his broal experiences and acquired knowledge, it. will '
be necessary. for him to improve his reading and writing skills in Laglich, |
however, before he begins college vou Although he manifests a high |
i

|

t

i

|

interest in engineering and scientific fields, he should probably not con-
sider these Ficlds as majors becmise of his deficiency in mathematics. ft
is believed the skills in English can be devcloped but it is doubtful if
the mathematical deficiencies can’ be overcome sufficiently to major in a
scientific area. It is probably advisable, therefure, for Mr. Maksymice to
consider one of the social scicnces as a college major. His background in
photography and military subjects, combined with a college major in an ap-
Propriate social science, would’ probably provide him with the necessary
Gualifications to become a geographer or an intelligence analy/st in govern-
ment service, :

It_is understood that Mr. Maksymice has enrolled in Montogomery Junior
College, Takoma Park, Maryland, for the 1966 fall semester and that he will
take a special English course concentrating on the fundanentals of reading

and written expression. After he completes this instruction, he might con=
sider working for an associate of arts degree in a social science at this
junior college with the ultimate goal of transferring later to a four-year j
college to work toward a bachelor degree.

I have appreciated knowing and taking with Mr. Maksymice and I trust
he will contact this Burcau if he requires further counseling assistance.
My best wishes go with this report in whatever plans Mr. Maksymice makes
concerning his future plans and goals.

Dear Mr. Lundahl:

' While I would like to make public the truly

E i you are performing under most trying circum-
u 4 stances. The analysis and interpretation of the
1 Cuban photography and the reporting of your
findings promptly and succinctly to me and to
my principal policy advisers, most particularly
the Secretary of State and the Secretary of

You have my thanks and the thanks of your
