REPORT ON THE COLD WAR USE OF RADIO BROADCASTING BY CIA

le Radio As a Medium in the Cold War

&@. The USSR and its satellites, including China, broadcast
te ceuntries outside the Orbit 1,395 hours per week of aggressive psych=
olevical warfare.

be The free world responds with 1,015 hours per week.

co This gives the enemy a numerical advantage of approximately
seven to five. In reality, the Communist advantage is.mch greater
because of their successful interference with free world broadcasts to the
Orbit through jemming and the penalties they impose on their own peoples
for listening to foreign broadcasts. It is estimated that these measures
reduce the effectiveness of free world broadcasts to the Orbit by. as much,
if not more than, 50 percent. An illustration is that the Commnists
devote an estimated 900 transmitters to the jamming of free world broad=
casts. There is no jamming of Orbit broadcasts. to the Western world, nor
any restrictions on listening to them.

de Onky the English speaking world holds its ow mumerically in
the over-all radio war with the Orbit. OA, BRC and Canada together
brosdeast 238 hours per week against the Orbit; whereas the Orbit countries
combined direct 222 hours per week to Fnglish language audiences in North
America, the: United Kingdom, and the Pacific area.

Se In the rest of the world, the balance is drastically in
favor of the Commmists. They broadcast 1, 173 jam-free hours to all
other countries around the world in miltiple languages, compared with a
mere 26); hours broadcast to all Orbit countries by non-English speaking
nations of the free world. :

£. Of the total of 1,015 broadcast hours beamed by all the free
world to the Crbit, CIA, through TP?CHIC and other quasi-clandestine
stations, breadcasts 513 hours, or more than half, in the name of exiles
from Commmnis’ dominated arezs.

go Tho greatest disparity in effort is most noticeable in
Western Europe. France, whieh receives 29 hours of broadcasts per week
from the Orbit as-a whole, responds with only 35 to the Orbit. Italy
receives 97 hours from the Orbit but broadcasts only ll to it, Spain 9h
to 12, Greces 89 to 9,:-Turkey 3 to 7. Even relatively aggressive
Yugoslavia receives 19); brcadcast hours from the Orbit against its outout

to the Orbit of only 89 hours.
anil ho The one-sided

he The one-sided contest is even more marked in a comparison
of the broadeast output of the USER alone, without the satellites,
against Europee It subjects Spain, Greece and Italy together, for
instance, to 1)0 hours of broadcasts per week. The combined broadcasts
of these three countries to the USSR, however, number only 19 hours per
week. France and Turkey who, together, receive 64, hours per week from
the USSR, make no broadcasts at all to the USSR. -

i. Appendix I gives a compilation by country or area of the
international broadcasts to and from USSR and the satellites. It shows
that the Communists are outslugging the free world, and that Western
Europe, in particular, is doing far less than it should in the radio
propaganda battle with the Orbit. :

2. Capabilities

Several techniques are available to CIA for the use of radio
broadcasting in its covert psychological warfare mission.

ao Overt international broadcasting on fixed frequencies under
cover of covertly controlled emigre groups. This technique normally
would be calculated to reach wide audiences by means of high power and
the use of mitiple frequencies; but it invites heavy jamming, is costly
and presents security, control and political problems in the acquisition
and maintenance of suitable bases and frequency allocations.

a

bo Quasi-clandestine broadeasts in the name of notional or
"captive" resistance movements using relatively low power and employing
a frequency switching technique to evade jamming. This technique presents
more manageable security and control problems, delivers a signal in spite
of jamming and costs less than high power, but it places a burden on
listeners and presents special problems.in avoiding interference with
broadcasts of friendly countries.

a a ac

Ce Subsidization of overt nonpolitical, but anti-Commnist,
religious broadcasts. . * % +: :

da. Through covert nenetration and/or support, the maripulation
of free world domestic broadcasting systems for the purpose (1) streng=
thening their anti-Communist broadcasts to the Orbit and/or (2) influence
ing them to more aggressive anti-Communist, pro-Western attitudes in their
domestic services.

This technique lends itself naturally to clandestine
operations. It requires a minimum of U.S. personnel, presents no

problems concerning

problems concerning bases ana management, and requires relatively

infiltration, spot forthcoming political changes by observing changes
ain government prepaganda directives, recruit agents with reliable
cover for other covert undertakings and cooperate in planning for
denial of the facilities to an eneny in the event of hostilities.

We believe it should be the agency's established policy
te carry out such-penetrations wherever opportunities offer or can
be created. A glance at the world map is sufficient to indicate the
immensity of this field of potentialities, both as concerns the
countries on the peripheries of the USSR and Communist China in
Europe, the Near East and Far Easts and in Latin America as wolle
We propose that an immediate start be made, in cooperation with Aree
Divisions, on a country-byecountry survey of possibilities in this
area and that setion be taken to achieve penetration wherever this
study indicates it may be feasible.

bilities in the free world but none for broadcasting to. the Soviet
Orbit o- : aon

‘De Bases

: (1) Because governnents object to vroviding bases for
aggressive psychological warfare which they do not influence or control,
4t ig difficult to find bases in areas suitable for broadeasting to the
Orbit. Furthermore, adequate breadcasting facilities take time te

Plan, build,.and staff and long tenure is therefore important. How
ever, the political climate of a country can change abruptly, with
vesulting. uncertainty as to length of tenure. . Munich, for. instance,
whieh once furnished.an exeelient base for a variety of broadcasts
targeted to the Orbit, appears to be becoming less and less satisfactory.

: ‘Cover and control problens are closely related to
this. .A base for a secure and competently managed operation should be
less difficult.to obtain than for a loosely organized one. :

(2) Seaborne transmitters offer mch in mobility but,
antenna limitations restrict their effective power. As in the case
ef the VOA COURIER, stationary antennas on land are required for
maximum effectiveness. ‘Thus, the political problem becomes: the ‘same
as for land transmitter bases, and.costs in investment and maintennance
ace considerably higher than land. based operations. Moreover, the
aiffieulties of providing credible cover for a covert seaborne operation
are ‘manifest. While this office will contime to study VOA experience
in this field, it sees no Prospect of any agency use for it.

(3) The VOA presently controls numerous broadcasting
bases and are developing additional bases; in ereas of the world
suitable for our purposes. The necessary agreements with host
Sountries have. already been negotiated; power, housing, transnorta=
tion and other.logisties have been provided.. The present. manage=
nent of VOA are sympathetic to sharing these bases with CIAs
In addition to.the saving in cost, this would furnish us secure

areas for transmitters with the minimum of housekespiag problems o

resolved, such Locations: would be ‘ideal “for our: purposes»

upon intelligence reports, interrogation of defectors, escapees

and exiles, indigenous newspapers and a regular flow of intercepts
from onemy broadcasts. These are indispensable to eredible, intere-
esting, and timely broadcasts. Despite our vast potential resources
and large U.S. expenditures in these fields, the effective "take" is
far from adequate, rarely timely, and unnecessarily costly. FBID, VOR,
and several others monitor the same foreign broadcasts to extract the
same or similar information. Several U.S. agencies interrogate the
same exiles for PW information, whereas a single interrogator, trained
in Pil needs, could supply most, if not all, the requirements not only
for all radio but all other Pu activities better and faster. A cleared
consultant, on behalf of one of our more successful operations, pro=
duced on abundance of excellent support information and evaluation
datas The same data, properly sterilized and speedily disseminated,
could equally serve the VOA and any other covert or overt Pil effort
tergeted to the same area.

This complex problem needs a high level decision
by State and CIA and the appointment of a small team of officers
experienced in both Pi and interrogation work with power to devise
an effective and efficient program to exploit our rich resources,

d. To Deliver a Signal That Can Be Heard

(1) Soviet jamming of propaganda broadcasts raises
serious questions concerning our ability to deliver a signal that
can be heard above the jamming. To be sure, some of our broadcasts
get through because they are unable similtaneously to jam broadcasts
in all areas nor do they in practice jam a given broadcast trans-
mission at sll hourse

For future planing purposes, however, these factors
seem clear:

(a) Soviet capabilities for jamming are large and
on the increase.

(») The degree of their jamming seems to be re=
lated to their estimate of the harmful effect of the broadcasts on
their interests. Hence, the more effective parts of our propaganda
are likely to be jammed even though other parts get throughs

{c) We have no present capabilities to monitor
their jamming if they use--as they probably do in congested areas=~
low-powered local jammerse

(2) Prudent planning would, therefore, require that
any substantial future investments by CIA in radio broadcasting
transmitters include provision for all possible techniques to ensure
our broadcasts being heard to the maximum in spite of jamming.

(3) What techniques

aan

NW 50955 Docld:32424022 Page 10 SECRET


SECRET
Security Information

(3) What techniques are available to meet this requires
ment?

(a) fo deliver a signal of such power as to be
nearé above the jamming. Here we are at a disadvantage in that s
low-powered and inexpensive local jammer is capable of rendering |
unintelligible 1 signal of substantially higher power from a distant
Point. The greater the power of our transmitter the more complicated
the installation and the more expensive the investment. And the more
difficult becomes the cover and security problems as well as the
political considerations involved in base negotiations. Since the
ensny is not required to equal our power with his jammers, we would
therefore be fighting a losing battle if we attempted to "slug it out"
on & power basis only.

(b) Jamming evasion through the device of vary=
ing the frequency has so far proven to be an effective means of lay~
ing down a signal that can be heard clearly despite jaming. Tnis
method requires constant dial changing by the listener and must
assume therefore a desire on his part to hear the program sufficient
to overcome the annoyance of dial twisting. When used in combination
with appropriate programming techniques and the use of two or more
frequencies similtaneously this has so far proven to be the most
effective means of jamming avoidance.

Such frequency shiftings cannot be accomplished
within the legal. rules laid down for international broadcasting.
These mst_ therefore, be “black” broadcasts in the sense that they
cam be credibly denied by our Government as well as the govermnent
of the host country. The movement at will through various frequencies
proc:.ces an annoying interference for the listeners to broadcasters to
whom those frequencies are legally assigned. This interference, while
fully justified in the case of USSR and satellite assigned frequencies,
must be avoided in the case of frequencies assigned to our friendss

Our broadcasts using this technique have so
fay avoided annoyance to friendly countries by the use of very Low
pover, This Limits us to a small part of the total Soviet Orbit
‘arget and that only on the neriphery. The same techniques can be
used with higher power and at greater distances from the target.
fe-aveid interference with friendly nations' broadcasts the base
must be located in an area which, with the proper antenna adjust=
nents, permits our signal to "skip" over the territory of friendly
countries in its path. An example would be that, given a transmitting
bass in Sandi Arabia for broadeasts to the USSR, the facility would
have to be engineered so that its signal would not interfere with
lecal broadeast reception in Turkey and other friendly countries in

techniques for the penetration of enemy domestic radio broadcasting
services might well enable us to overcome the handicaps imposed by
the jamming of our conventional broadcasts to the Soviet orbit and
seize the cold war initiative in the radio sphere. It is a field
which has been neglected thus fer.

Some possibilities in this area are described
in the ore tye froy" report of the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology (Vol. IV, Annex 26) of 1 February, 1951. :

Among them is the "intrusion," or "side-band
injection,” technique which was used successfully by the Russians
against Germeny during World War II. It would enable us to intrude
our own propaganda messages into radio programs being broadcast on,
enemy Home channels. Jt would enable us in effect to talk to the
Soviet, satellite and neutral radio audiences. over enemy facilities
or compel the enemy to disrupt his own broadcast service in an effort
to prevent it. It could also be used in turning Soviet propaganda
broadcasts to Western Europe to the advantage of our friends. The Troy
report observes as to’ the technique itself: oe

‘ "This would be an effective and annoying
technique which would be extremely difficult to counter."

Utilization of this technique appears to. be
within. our.capabilities at the moment. It has been field tested
and is ready for use as soon’as the necessary technical adaptations
ean be made to conventional transmitters. The time and cost involved
in mounting a facility for utilizing this technique is now being
explored by ADCO at the suggestion of this office.

Another unconventional technique being devel~
oped by an agency consultant and now almost ready for field testing
4s the so-called This operates on the theory that

Other unconventional means of carrying the
cold war to the Orbit by means. of clandestine radio might be cap-
able of invention and development, and the scientific and practical
potentialities in this field should be explored to the utmost.

This office is convinced that emphasis must
be placed more and more om unconventional radio broadcasting tech-
niques if the cold war of the air waves is not to become more one-
sided than it already is in favor of the Communists. Properly devel-
oped and utilized, those techniques already perfected or in the pro~
cess of perfection and those which might be invented might even be

12 to 18 months to design, construct. and install 4 transmitter.
Prior to such approval time is required for the planning cycle, negotia-
