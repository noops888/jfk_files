Re Paris letter 8-25-64.

Captioned matter was further discussed with

LAWRENCE GOURLAY of CIA, Paris, on 10-27-64.

He advised

that CIA at the present time has no particular interest

in GIBSON and has no plan to interview him or to establish

contact with him. He stated that in the event the Bureau

desires to interview GIBSON or make contact with him, they

would have no objection and would be interested in knowing

the outcome. I told him that we have no plans along these

lines at the present time and that we are mainly interested

in keeping

track of GIBSON's activities and knowing if and

when he returns to the United

States. GOURLAY stated that

it is his impression that GIBSON is no longer connected

With the pro-Communist Chinese magazine "Revolution"

but

that this may be incorrect

Referenced Paris letter indicated that the Direction:

de la Surveillance du Territoire (DST), French domestic

counterespionage service, is now interested in GIBSON, and

they have been requested

to furnish us with up-to-date

information regarding his present employment, residence,

and activities.

We are continuing to follow

this with the

DST and will furnish the Bureau with any information

received from that source.

ROUTING

CHes

This is to advise that I was contacted by LAWRENCE

GOURIAY, of CIA, Paris, on August 20, 1964. He advised that

his office received an

inquiry from the Direction de la

Surveillance du Territoire (DST), French domestic counter-

espionage service, in July 1964 regarding GIBSON. He advised

that they have very little information in their files other

than that which has been furnished by this office.:, It was

agreed that we would furnish information directly to the DST

since all of the information originated with the Bureau. (S

GOURLAY advised that they have thus far taken no

steps to contact GIBSON or to attempt to develop him as a

source of information. He stated that he is contacting his

headquarters to determine what the desires of his headquarters

are in this regard. GOURLAY stated that it is his impression

that GIBSON is no longer employed by the pro-Communist Chinese

magazine

"Revolution" but that he is still residing in Paris.

He stated that he will advise us in the near future as to

whether or not they still have an interest in the subject

and as to whether

they intend to

take any action with regard

to him.
