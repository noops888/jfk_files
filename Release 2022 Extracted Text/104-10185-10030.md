RE: ZRRIFLE

1, Per our discussion of 2 July 1962, Ieexpect that we
shall proceed to transfér QJWIN to Baden-Baden per the proposal
in QULA1463 dated 2 February 1962, LUXE/0489 dated 19 June
1962 stated that COS would have the full detaiis of the
capital outlay required by 23 June; however, the information
has not been received as of 3 July. fhe last cable to the

Station, DIR, 18391 told COS to contact you directly on his
arrival on 16 July. :

2, With regard to candidates spotted by QJWIN, the
two whom he spotted in Italy a year and a quarter ago can
Probably be used if needed, if we can accept the assessments
of them by the Trieste Base contract agent, Magonetti,
Wagonetti’s assessment is contained in OTRA,27542 dated
19 May 1961, The names of the two French candidates are con-
tained in QLIA, 1426 dated 15 December 1961. No action has
been taken on’these names regarding tracing or anything ‘clse.
My handwritten notes attached to that dispatch contain
fuller descriptions of the two People than appear in the

dispateh,

3. --the other spotting effort that can be made is
through (Hank (IN) in Rome. [ilank]was well briefed
on the qualifications desired and the~security precautions
to be observed in the spotting activity. COS Rome has a
copy of the qualifications and restrictions in his safe; a
however, if is told to proceed with his contact in
Florence, I suggest that he be re-briefed in detail,

crud except for the pay receipts, which are assembled in one
envelope. I have already given) he ZORTFLE authorization

tract, including the extension to 1 March 1963,
