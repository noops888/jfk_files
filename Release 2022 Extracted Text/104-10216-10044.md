MICROFILA

1.

One of the last of the UNADAGIO tapes, which is transmitted herewith,

contained a passage (marked on the attachment) which Peter !!. Gloaden

spotted as possibly referring to Polando CUBELA (201-252234). Though

transcriber UNOPAl has insisted that the first name which he heard

was Fernando, Stockwood feels confident that the conversation 1s be-

tween a slightly intoxicated Antonio CARRILLO and CUBELA, with another

person possibly also present.

Unfortunately, raddening hammering

noises make any full transcription here impossible. If the tape can

be cleaned up at Headquarters, it may sive additional insights into

CUBELA's current attitudes.

2. CARRILLO is the rather thick-tongued Individual who is initially heard

making comments which include the illuminatin? remark "... es un

soldado de carajo . ..

equivocado, ah, Polando i CARPILin continues after a sudden abrupt

Slightly later he appears to say, • estás

break in the shoutin? at the start of the passare. CUBELA's voice,

which should be identifiable from other informatior. available to Head-

quarters, is heard less often than CARRILLO's.

3. In further support of the thesis that CUBELA is CAPRILLO's interlocu

tor, we note that the conversation takes place about half way through

a reel which began at 1050 and ended at 1645 hours on 17 February.

Reference submits evidence that CUBELA tas at the Cuban Embassy as of

about mid day on 17 February for the purpose of having lunch with

CARRILLO.

4. If retranscription of the tape at Headquarters should produce informa-

tion of interest to this station, please send us a copy of the rele-

vant material in

Spanish or English.
