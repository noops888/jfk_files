REFEREICE OFPA 78420

1. One of the last of the UNADAGIO tapes, which is transmitted herewith,
contained a passace (marked on the attachment) vhich Peter %!, Gloaden
spotted as possibly referring to Rolando CUBELA (201-252234). Thoush
transcriber UNOPAL has insisted that the first name which he heard
was Fernando, Stockwood feels confident that the conversation is be-
tween a slichtly intoxicated Antonio CARRILLO and CUBELA, with another
person possibly also present, Unfortunately, maddening hammering
noises make any full transcription here impossible. If the tape can
be cleaned up at Headcuarters, it may rive additional insights into
CUBELA's current attitudes.

CARRILLO is the rather thick-tongucd individual who is initially heard
making comments which include the illuminating remark ". . . es un
soldado de carajo . . . ." Slirhtly later he appears to say, © estas
equivocado, ah, Roland CARRILLO continues after a sudden: abrupt
break in the shouting at the start of the passare. CUBELA's voice,
vhich should be identifiable from other information available to Head=
quarters, is heard less often than CARRILLO's.

In farther support of the thesis that CUBELA is CAPRILLO's interlocu~
tor, we note that the conversation takes place about half way throuch
a reel which began at 1050 and ended at 1645 hours on 17 February.
Reference submits evidence that CUBELA vas at the Cuban Embassy as of
about mid day on 17 February for the purpose of having lunch with
CAPRILLO,

If retranscription of the tape at Headquarters should produce informa- ’
tion of interest to this station, nlease send us a capy of the rele- ae Ct
vant material in Spanish or English. arn
