° 7. organization. of CIA Investigation

of President Kennedy's Assassination

In his Executive Session testimony before the Select

Committee, Richard Helms, the CIA's Deputy Director for

Plans during 1963,\described the CIA's role in the
investigation of President Kennedy's assassination as
follows:

This crime.was committed on United

States soil. Therefore, as far as the

Federal government was concerned, the pri-
mary investigating agency would have been
the Federal Bureau of Investigation without

any: question.. The role of the CIA would

have been entirely supportive in the sense

acquire outside the limits of the United

States at all. So when I used: here the -~
word “supportive," I meant that in the
literal sense of the term. We are (sic)
trying to support the FBI and Support the
Warren Commission and be responsive to
their requests, but we were not initiating
any investigations of our own or, to my
recollection, were we ever asked to.
(Executive Session Testimony of Richard
Helms, 8/9/78, pp. 17-18.)

On November 23, 1963 Helms called a meeting of senior-

level CIA officials. to outline the Agency's investiga-
s

jagger sive responsibility vis a vis the assassination. (SSC,
(ge

“ $eelso testified before the Select Committee,
that he was. given charge of the ‘Agency's investigation ‘
on the basis of two considerations: 1)!his prior 3 Bb
experience in conducting major CIA security investi-
gations and 2) the observance of Oswald y(n

less than two months prior to the assassination. (ssc
Book V, p- 25, HSCA Class. Deposition of John Scelso,

5/16/70, pp. 111-112.°;) Scelso also noted that
during the course of his investigative efforts, Helms
did not pressure him to adopt specific investigative
theories nor reach conclusions within a set period of
time; Executive Session Testimony of Richard Helms ,

8/9/78, pp. 9-10)*

* Raymond Rocca, Chief of Research and Analysis for ®
CIA's Counterintelligence Staff characterized Scelso's
responsibility not as a mandate to investigate but
rather to. "coordinate traffic (code facilitation,
telegram or telegraphic consideration) for. working
with the DDP with respect to what was being done over
the whole world..." (HSCA Classified Deposition of
R. Rocca, 7.17/78, p. 9.)

manner in which he conducted the Agency's investiga-

Mr. Goldsmith. Earlier, when I asked you which

indicated that.on balance the primary area of emphasis
was the Soviet connection.

Mr. Rocca... That was certainly the one that I would
say dominated -- looking at it from my point of view.

Mr. Goldsmith. Now, had you known about the anti-
Castro assassination plots on the part of the CIA,- would
you have given more priority, more emphasis, to thé
possibility of a Castro conspiracy to kill the President?

Mr. Rocca. Again, I say that it would have
simply intensified. it, that there was attention given
to it, not particularly by the staff.. I had no capabilities

getting started. This was WH's area. This was Win 07.
Seott's area of proficiency. So the defectors had only aa
begun. to come out and they came out-later, the Cuban
defectors.

So, I can't -- I really can't say that (a) the
“Cuban connection was ignored, because it wasn't. The
press was filled with it at the time.

The Harker interview should have been undoubté@¥ily »
given greater attention in a generalized sense; but it
was given specific attention, I was told at the time of
the Rockefeller thing.

Mr. Goldsmith. .In what way was. the Cuban. connection
investigated?

Mr. Rocca. I don't know. I don't know this.

Mr. Rocca... Primarily, primarily. But I didn't

Mr. Rocca. My recollection is that at the time

Mr. Goldsmith. That's another possibility.
There are different --

of an assassination plot by Castro against the President
was adequately investigated?

As noted ahove, the CI Staff assumed responsibility:
in late December 1963 ~ early January 1964 for. the
coordination of CIA efforts to assist the Warren
Commission in its investigation. At that time, Raymond
Rocca, Chief of Research and Analysis for CI Staff,
was designated point of contact with. the Warren
Commission. (HSCA Classified Deposition of James
Angleton, 10/5/78, p. 77.) Rocca's Research and
Analysis component was’ concerned with: A

"analytical intelligence, analytical —~

brainpower, which meant all source, “all

overt source comprehension; a study of

cases that had ceased to occupy opera-

tional significance, that is, closed cases, -

to maintain the ongoing record of overall

quality and quantity of counterintelligence
being performed by the entire DDP operational
component;... the Deputy Director for Plans

(HSCA Classified Deposition of R. Rocca,

of James Angleton, 10/5/78, p. 77.)

Mr. Rocca: testified that assagsination=related

Warren Commission) in the normal flow of. day to day

Mr. Rocca testified that even though

CI staff in general displaced the direct relations of

Mr. Helms or any other concerned Agency official with

the Warren Commission. (Ibid.;. Rocca testified that either

A, Opinions of Warren: Commission and CIA Representatives

Regarding Warren Commission-CIA Relationship

The. Committee has contacted both representatives of
the Warren Commission staff and those representatives of
the CIA who played significant roles in providing CIA-
generated information to the Warren Commission. The
general consensus of. these representatives is that. the
Warren Commission and the CIA enjoyed a successful
working relationship during the course of the. Commission's
investigation. (HSCA Class. Depo. of R. Rocca 7/17/78,
Pp. 18) (See also Exec. Sess. Test. of Richard Helms,
8/9/78, p. 24.) William Coleman, a senior staff counsel
for the Warren Commission who worked closely with Warren

Commission staff counsel W. David Slawson on matters

which utilized the CIA's resources, characterized
the CIA representativés with whom he dealt as
highly competent, cooperative, and intelligent. rs

(See HSCA staff interview of William Coleman,

wi. GR

8/2/78.) Mr. Slawson expressed a similar opinion

regarding the Agency's cooperation and quality

John McCone , Director of Central Intelligence

(Ibid. p. 24.) Mr. Rocca concluded that on-this basis:

"the CIA was to turn: over and’ to develop any information nae

bearing on the assassination that could be of assistaice
to the Warren Comission." (Ibid., p. 26.) ;

A different view of the CIA's. role regarding the
supply of CIA's information to the Warren Commission was
propounded by Richard Helms. Mr. Helms, who served as

the CIA's Deputy Director for Plans during the Warren

Commission investigation, was directly responsible for the

“CIA's investigation of President Kennedy's assassination andthe
asteplishmerd of ClApelicy vida ris tha Warren Commission,

(Ibid., p. 23. ) le testified to the. Committee that the

CIA made every effort to be as responsive as possible to

Warren Commission requests. (Exec. Sess. Text. of Richard.

Helms, 8/9/78, p- 10.) Mr. Helms added further testimony
regarding the manner in which the CIA provided its infor-
mation to the Warren Commission. He stated:

An inquiry would come over (from the Warren. Com-
mission). We would attempt to ‘respond to it.

But these inquiries came in individual bits and’® 6
pieces or as individual items...Each individual

item that came along we took care of as best we
could. (Ibid., pp. 10-11.)

However, it was Mr. Helms' recollection that the CIA

provided information to the Warren Commission primarily

Mr. McCone testifed that he first became aware
of the CIA's anti-Castro assassination plots
involving CIA-Mafia ties during August 1963. He
stated that upon learning of these plots he directed
that the. Agency cease all such activities. (HSCA

These comments indicate that ‘Slawson placed

Moreover,’ there is no indication that Slawson had

concerning the Mexican police report, it would
appear that the Warren Commission, as of March 25,

the Commission had been forced to rely upon the two
memoranda that did not make reference to the surveil-

Standing by itself, Luisa Calderon's cryptic
comments do not merit serious attention. Her words
may indeed. indicate foreknowledge of the assassina-
tion but may equally be interpreted without such a
sinister implication. Nevertheless, the Committee
has determined that Luisa Calderon's case should
have merited serious attention in the months following
the assassination.

In connection with the assassination, Luisa
Calderon's name first surfaced on November 27, 1964
in a cable sent by then Ambassador Mann to the State
Department (CIA Doc. DIR 85573, 11/27/63).

In that.cable Mann stated: »
“,..Washington should urgently consider
feasibility of requesting Mexican authorities
to arrest for interrogation: . Eusebio Azcue,
Luisa Calderon and Alfredo Mirabal. The two

men are Cuban national and Cuban consular

officers. Luisa Calderon is a secretary

During the Rockefeller Commission inquiry,
Calderon's conversation was identified

as a possible item of information from

thel Agency's Cuban and Soviet[telephone
intercepts Jthat might suggest foreknowledge

of a plot to assassinate the American Presi-
dent. This involves a faulty translation of an
answer Calderon gave to her caller. In answer
to the latter's question as to whether she

had heard the latest news, Calderon said:

“Si, claro, me entere casiantes que Kennedy."
The verb entere is mistranslated. Me enfere

(the first person of the verb enteratselie,

past tense) should be translated as -1 found
out (or I learned) about it -- the assassination/
almost. before Kennedy /aid7." In other words,
Calderon was saying she -heard about the shooting
of Kennedy almost at the time the event took
place..." (CIA Doc., Memorandum Regarding
Luisa Calderon conversation, p.1).

The Committee fundamentally disputes the

narrow interpretation of Calderon's comments

assigned by the Agency. It is the Committee's

position that translation of Me Entere as

either "I found out" or "I learned about"

does not foreclose interpretation of Calderomsp , +

comments as a suggestion on her part of possible

foreknowledge of President Kennedy's assassination.

Calderon. This was because, during the time

she was in Mexico, the DGI had intercepted
a letter to her by an:American who signed
his name. OWER (phonétic) or something
similar. As you know, the pronunciation
of Anglo-Saxon names is difficult in
Spanish so I am not sure of how the name
mentioned by Hernandez should be spelled.
It could have been "Howard" or something
different. As I understand the matter,
the letter from the American was a love
letter but indicated that there was a
clandestine professional relationship
between the writer and Luisa~Calderon.

I also understand from (the case officer)
that after the interception of the letter
she had been followed and seen in the
company of an American... Ido not know if
this could have been:.Oswald...(Ibid.)

in what form this information was provided,

The CIA. responded by memorandum:

-"Although the (Mexico City) Station considered
the conversation of sufficient possible :
interest to send a copy to headquarters,
the latter apparently did nothing with
it, for there appears to be no record in the
Oswald file of such action as may have

The available evidence thus supports the
conclusion that the Warren Commission was never
given the information nor the, opportunity by
which it could evaluate Luisa. Calderon's

clearly be traced to the CIA; and °
unlike the earlier plots, the CIA had
endorsed AMLASH's proposal for a coup;
the first ‘step to him being Castro's

to retaliate for such plotting. No one

as the 1977 IGR has identified it, is whether
the AMLASH ‘operation was of sufficient relevancy

In the case of the AMLASH operation this
determination is a most difficult matter to
resolve. Reasonable men may differ in their
characterization of the Agency's operational
objectives.

Based upon the presently available evidence

“it is the Committee's position that such informa—

tion, if made available to the Warren Commission,
might have stimulated the Commission's investiga-
tive concern for possible Cuban involvement or
complicity in the assassination. As J. Lee Rankin
commented before this Committee:

---when I read...the Church Committee's
report--it was an ideal situation for Bo
them to just pick out any way they

wanted to tell the story and fit it

in with the facts that had to be met
