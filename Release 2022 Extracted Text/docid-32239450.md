Con Hitchcock is very interested in working on the committee's

MEMORANDUM

| TO: Tom Lambeth
|
| 1 |
FROM: Robert J. Lehner | |
DATE: May 26, 1977 é \

\° SUBJECT: Con Hitchcock

This is to request a salary adjustment from $15,000
to $20,000 per year for Con Hitchcock. Mr. Hitchcock was
| hired in December at a salary of $15,000. ‘The thought
of the then Staff Director and Chief Counsel was that after
members of the staff were working here for a period of time
and we were able to evaluate their work, salary adjustments
would be made. Unfortunately those salary adjustments were t
never made because of the delay in reconstituting and re-
| budgeting the Committee. \
Mr. Hitchcock graduated from Law School in 1975. ‘The
only other attorney on the King Task Force that graduated

that year was Sheila Jackson Lee. Her salary is $23,000 a
per year.

Mr. Hitchcock has demonstrated a quick ability to
assimilate factual situations, gives insightful legal
analysis of those situations and writes cogently in these
areas. He is a definite asset to our team and one of the
brightest people we have on the staff.

“tT haa recommended to Al Lewis this same adjustment. Mr.

| Lewis agreed and was prepared to make:.that recommendation to
the Committee.

For the above reasons, I hereby recommend Mr. Hitchcock's
salary adjustment be made forthwith.
