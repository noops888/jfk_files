26 November 1976

TO: MR. SHORTLEY

Ms. Renshaw, LA Division Office of Special Assistant,
called re ms. by Winston Scott, COS Mexico City at the
time of the Kennedy assassination. She said he was
thought to have left behind him a ms. which has not been
published. She said if it had ever been submitted to
the Agency it would have been four or five years ago.

I doubted we would have it in this office that long.

File attached.
