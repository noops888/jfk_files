2022 RELEASE UNDER THE PRESIDENT JOHN F. KENNEDY ASSASSINATION RECORDS ACT OF 1992

26 November 1976

TO: MR. SHORTLEY

Ms. Renshaw, LA Division Office of Special Assistant,

called re ms. by Winston Scott, COS Mexico City at the

time of the Kennedy assassination. She said he was

thought to have left behind him a ms. which has not been

published. She said if it had ever been submitted to

the Agency it would have been four or five years ago.

I doubted we would have it in this office that long.

File attached.
