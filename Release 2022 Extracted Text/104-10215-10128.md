An' of Aug 60 the three usjor refineries conflaested by tha Castro rogies

are operating in fairly good shape. Their principal problem la that

the soviet crude being supplied is very light and they caunot run as

nich; volung because gie pressure bulldo up. The lcdo refinary, for

ample, has a capselty of 36 thousand bbls per day on heavy crudo, but

26 thousind bois per dsy lo the beat they have besa abie to do on the

sores crude, dad it has bezn salag at a rate of only 20 thoussnd bbla

per day since 20 Jul 60.

The Sortet crude arailable to dste has been compatible with the refineries

and u1ll not dimage then, but in addition to not being able to get as

much volume, tha Infineries canzo: get sa much fuel oll because of light

ends.. Thie 18 trus of all thres usjor refineries.

The refinerats were desigued for 26 gravity crude which is fairly heavy.

Tha Sovlet crude 1s 33 gravity, end has coused an imbalance 1n chat

they are nou producing more gasoline than la seeded. As a consequence,

Ciba 18 sesrchies desperately for fuel 011. The USSR bas gald that 1t

Is not 1o a position to supply fuel oll and so Cuba bas turned toward

Mexico, even to the extent of attempting to arrange deals unereby they

u1ll trade gasoline for fuel o11.

Tea tabalance of gasolias la ladiested by tha fact that the Cabaiguán

refisary uns shut dous recently becauze 1t8 gasoline storage sas completely

filled.

Cuba will resch a criticsl point about 1 Sep 60. The Baso refinery slowed

down fron 26 thousand bble per day to 20 thousand bble fer day because

1t had only a 10-day eupply of crude. The supply os hand vas sufficient

De Paule was considered one of the better. nen of the plant and could be

classed as & key techniclan because of his knouledge, background, and

ability, and 1t would definitely burt the Castro regime lf he fled Cuba.

Homever, the opportunitles for employment in the o1l Industry in Latin

Cubans on the pert of other countrles li thich there are refining operations.
