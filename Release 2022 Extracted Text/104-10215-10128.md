As of Aug 60 the three mejor refineries confiscated by the Castro rogies
, ate operating in fairly good chape. Their principal problem ie that
the Soviet crude being supplied is very light and they connot run os
wich voluzs because gee pressure builds up. The Easo refinery, for
example, has a capacity of 36 thousand bbls per day on heavy crude, but
26 thoussnd bbls per dey ta the best they have tesa abie to do on the
Soviet crude, and it bas been meaning at a rate of only 20 thoussnd bbls
Per dey since 20 Jul 60. :

‘The Soviet crude available to date haz been compatible with the refineries
and will not damage ther, but in addition to not being able to get as
much volums, the rafinsries cannot get as much fuel ofl because of light

ends. This is trus of all three usjor refineries.

The’ refinerats vere designed for 26 gravity crude which 1s fairly heavy.
Ths: Soviet crude is 33 gravity, and has caused @n imbalance in that
thay are now producing more gesoline than is needed. As a consequence,
Cuba is searchicg desperately for fuel ofl. The USSR hes said that it
is not in a position to supply fusl ofl and so Cuba has turned toward
Mexico, even to the extent of ettezpting to arrange deals whereby they

SOURCE:

1, In Aug 60 the Castro regime sent two representatives to the US to attempt

to obtain replacement parte and machinery for the oil industry. One of -
these men is Julio Caunedo, on the staff of ICP, and the second ic Leonel

de Paula Arias, a former employee of Hose Standard Ot! SA,

2. De Phule is about 28-29 years’ old, 6 180 lbs. He has black curly hatr
and fair skin. He is married and I believe has one child, He ie a Roman
Catholic; and has never been considered. as having any left-wing inclinaticas.

3. Be Paul speaks excellent English, and I believe studied in the US, He has
a degree in engineering and worked three years with the Esso refinery,
mainly :; 4m maintenance and construction. As of Jul 60 he was. section head
of the Refining Department, Purchasing and Warehousing.

4. The choice of de Paula to go to the US to obtain necessary supplics is
sound because he is the man which the company vould have.chosen to do such
@ job if required, He has a reputation of being a good hard vorker,
intelligent and de, endable. be adit cere personality and handles
himself very well. Ee =

5. De Paula was considered one of the better men of the plent and could be
: elessed as a key technician because of his knowledge, background, and
ability, end it would definitely hurt the Castro regime if he fled Cuba.
However, the opportunities for employment in the oi] industry in Latin
America! are not good because there is considerable prejudice against
Cubans on the pert of. other countries in which there are refining operations.
