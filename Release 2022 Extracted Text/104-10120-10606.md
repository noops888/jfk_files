Goleniewski was dissatisfied with the current Agency

calls and does not answer letters. Subsequent to this

memorandum I again met with Kimsey and finally persuaded

Kimsey to have Goleniewski write a letter to his contact

man through the appropriate channels.

to Goleniewski

and he again telephoned me later on and

said that Goleniewski had agreed to do this.

received some documents from Goleniewski and I took the

documents and gave them to George List," On Thursday,

19 May, List) advised me that he also received, through

the proper channels, the same documents.

In addition,

Kimsey sent me a copy of the same report.
