MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT : HSCA Access to Mexico City History

1. HSCA requested access to some 200 pages of the
three-volume history of Mexico City - about a third of
the material. The substantive content runs the gamut from
the history of Mexico University through detailed operation-
al support capabilities and-high level political connect~-
ions and activities. It is an impressive. accumulation of
operational activity - classical sources and methods, as
well as detailed revelations about past events.

2. We pointed out that the agreement between Chairman
Stokes and DDCI Carlucci directly faced the issue of the
irrelevancy of the vast majority of the history, and the
sensitivity of it. The HSCA position had been that it had
to verify this, and the access given to senior levels was.
to satisfy this. Now it was being requested in connection
with depositions, which would serve to get this material
into a Committee transcript. Since some two-thirds of the
station's history (the work covers 1947 through 1969) pre-
ceded the visit of Oswald to Mexico in 1963 and assassination
of the President, that clearly had nothing to do with the
Committee's charter. I added that Mr. Carlucci’is out of
town, and will not be back until some time Sunday, so I
could not go back to him. The request was so far beyond the
agreement, that I felt I could not modify it. Cornwell then
asked that I speak to the Director.

3. I saw the Director at about noon, and summarized
the agreement and the dilemma, also going over the above.
He stated that I could offer access to one senior staff
member (in addition to Blakey and Cornwell)on the condition
that material from the history not be used in depositions.

4, I spoke with Cornwell, giving him the message. He
said that they may wish to use some of the material. I
replied that the history is based on other sources; those
related to the portion that is within the Committee's charter

was based entirely on sources to which Committee investi-
gator's have had access. Our problem was the overall
collection, and particularly some of the substance of the
history. He asked if he could come back and ask for it,
if they wanted to use something in particular. I said
that we had never closed a door completely, but that the
Director's condition was fairly clear. Those things
relevant to their authorized inquiry were already in
their hands, so I could not think what they would have

to use from this. They will ask us, and we can react
when they do.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Examination by Mr. G. Robert Blakey of Sanitized
Portions of History of Mexico City Station

1. At 1745 hours on 23 August 1978, Mr. Scott Breckinridge,

Mr. Norbert Shepanek and the undersigned met with Mr. G. Robert
Blakey, Chief Counsel of the House Select Committee on
Assassinations (HSCA). The meeting took place in Mr. Breckinridge’ s
office. The purpose of the meeting, inter alia, was to make
available to Mr. Blakey certain sanitized portions of CS HP 329
(SECRET), a three volume history of the Mexico.City Station
covering the period 1947 - 1969. The portions selected for
sanitization were previously designated by Mr. Gary Cornwell as
heing of interest to the HSCA. Mr. Edwin Lopez, of the HSCA

: if, was also present, but did not have access to the Mexico
City Station material.

2. Mr. Blakey was furnished the following sanitized portions
of the Station history which he read in my presence:

a. Volume I, Chapter II (C) - Station Expansion and
Joint Operations (1959-1969), consisting of pages 34 ‘through 57.

b. Volume II, Chapter III (A-3) - The Cuban Embassy,
consisting of pages 221 through 256

c. Volume 11, Chapter III (A-4) - Operational Support and

Technical Collection Activities, consisting of pages 257 through 298.

d. ' Volume II, Chapter III (B) - Covert Action Operations
(portion relating to student operations. only), consisting of pages
327 through 336.

----e. Volume II, Chapter IV = Joint Operations and Projects

3, I assured Mr. Blakey that I would be happy to discuss
with him any of the deleted items and explain the nature of
the content and the reason for its deletion. I told Mr. Blakey
that since he was personally reviewing the material, and the
same would hold true for Mr. Cornwell, I felt that I could be
very candid in describing the deleted portions. Mr. Blakey
thanked me, but did not at any time raise any questions about
deietions. After he had finished his reiyew I repeated my
offer to discuss any portion of the material. He again thanked
me and said he had no questions.

4. Mr. Blakey did not indicate (nor did I ask) whether
he would continue to seek access to the entire three volume

history in its unsanitized form.

Historian's Note

This paper covers activities of the CIA sta-
tion in Mexico City and bases in Monterrey, Nogales,
and Merida from 1947 to 30 June 1969. While re-
search on this paper was being done from late 1969
to mid-1970, some projects of long duration were
terminated for security or economic reasons. In
those instances, the descriptions of these activi-
ties extend beyond 30 June 1969.

Because the paper is not indexed, the table
of contents contains a detailed synopsis of each
chapter, The reader will note some repetition of
operational events in the text. There is a reason
for this. Chapters I and II were an effort on the
part of the writer to reduce to a reading minimum
a chronological summary of the origins of CIA oper-
ations in Mexico from 1947 to 1969 for persons who
do not have the time or the need to read several
hundred pages of station history. Subsequent chapters
treat the projects in more detail.

For the convenience of the reader, the writer

has grouped together those projects which pertain to

the same target. Each of these target categories
begins with an introduction which is nothing more

than a brief history of the target for the benefit
of persons not familiar with the Mexico operations.

The Mexico City Station had one of the most

extensive and expensive unilateral technical col-
lection programs conducted by the Agency. For that

reason, those projects are presented together,
although they are also mentioned in station coverage
of specific targets. These unilateral projects had
two characteristics which should be remembered:
the majority of those still current in 1969 were
sources turned over to the station in 1947 by the
FBI or were recruited from contacts of these sources;
the agent networks in the unilateral operations were
a series of family relationships.

Readers may be confused by a Mexico Station
practice of changing cryptonyms of sources when
they were switched from one project to another.
Some sources used by Mexico were identified by as
many as four project cryptonyms. Insofar as possible,

the writer included all the previous cryptonyms for

the convenience of readers who may wish to review

used,

Inactive project, chronological, and subject
files were provided by Lucille Long and Dorothy
Kishter of the Records Integration Division (RID),
both of whom devoted considerable time to search-
ing indexes for records which were not included in

the Clandestine Service records system. A presenta-

tion of the current projects (1969) could not have

been written without the cooperation anc generous

assistance of all personnel of the Mexico Branch

ational files which were excellently maintained in

responded by asking that Jones be assigned to
Mexico City as a "civil attache" to investigate
the activities of German residents.

Jones opened the FBI office in Mexico City
in June 1942.0n the second floor of an office build-
ing at Londres 85, across the street from the US
Embassy chancery and residence which was located
in a compound at Londres 101. He had a staff of
two men, the assistant civil attache, Marion Stokes
Davis, and the chief clerk, Charles Turnbull. In
the fall of 1942 Clarence Moore replaced Jones,
and in August 1943 Birch D. O'Neal replaced Moore.~

By mid-1943 the FBI had between 25 and 30 agents
working under cover throughout Mexico. One of them
was who became the chief of the
CIA station in Mexico in 1951. The number of( *

slots in the Mexico City 32

office had also increased to eight. These agents
concentrated on two cases which involved extensive
investigations, the code names of which were ALTO
and CLOG. The ALTO case involved censorship of

and Captain W. C. Ford (USN). They visited 16
countries in Latin America to examine relationships
between station officers and those in other Embassy
components, station morale, and operational and
administrative matters. A memorandum prepared by
these inspectors after their return to Headquarters
noted that Ambassador Walter C. Thurston was com-
pletely satisfied with the manner in which Doyle
was handling his operations. The same memorandum
reported that the administration and operations
were in excellent condition, and that the Mexico
City Station gave every indication of being the
outstanding station on the circuit,

——
In the early years the station acquired some

surveillance assets for sporadic use on the CP and

leftist groups, but they had no organized team that
could cover the activities of Soviet Embassy offi-

cials. The FBI refused to turn over the background
data from their files on the Soviets. Furthermore,
it soon became apparent that the Mexican Government
could not be relied upon to provide detailed cover-

age of the activities of such a large number of the

Soviet Bloc officials who had complete freedom of
movement all over Mexico and clandestinely into the
United States. The Mexican security agents had
neither the training nor the motivation for this
sort of effort. Accordingly, the station embarked
on a program to develop unilateral support operations.
‘This was not to the detriment of, the other
targets which, according to SOI 23, took priority
over the Soviets. LIFTER, LIBETHENITE, and
LIONHEART (turned over by the FBI) were covering
Communist and leftist activities. LIBELER (turned
over by the FBI) was a high-ranking Mexican Govern-
ment official who kept the station fairly well in-
formed on events that.were happening inside govern-
ment circles. He also provided some personality
information on the Soviet officials with whom he

came in contact.

B. Development of Unilateral Operations (1951-1958)

The first significant, productive unilateral
support operation was developed by Charles W. Ander-
son, III, in October 1950, This was LIFEAT, which

in 1969 passed its 19th anniversary. Initially a

small telephone tap operation with a yearly budget
under $5,000, it developed into a large, sophisti-
cated, audio operation covering telephones, TELEX*
systems, and microphone plants with capabilities
limited only by the availability of persons to man
the recorders and, transcrihe the take. In 1969
the LIFEAT budget waG$102,000, >

In the process of getting the telephone tap
operations under way, other support agent prospects
were developed. “LIMESTONE (201-150706), a Mexican
employee of the Hoof and Mouth Control Unit, US
Department of Agriculture; and LIMEWATER (201-
183704), a telephone company supervisor, were ‘the
original LIFEAT agents. They suggested their sons,
daughters, parents, in-laws, and friends for recruit-
ment. From this assortment, the first 12 agents
were recruited for an umbrella-type project (LIPSTICK)
to provide mobile and fixed surveillance teams to
parallel LIFEAT and to man three photo observation
posts around the Soviet Embassy. These agents were

all untrained in clandestine activities; they were

mechanics, clerks, salesmen, a housewife, and the

were related in some way to LIMESTONE and LINEWATER.

This project was developed by Charles Anderson and
Harry T. Mahoney. These original LIPSTICK agents
formed the nucleus for the extensive operational
support projects in Mexico, and in 1969 many of
them were still on the job.

While the station was developing unilateral
support operations, contact was continued with the |
head of. the Mexican Security Service (Direccion

Federal de Seguridad - DFS). In 1952, a police

training officer, Robert L. Melberg, was assigned

to Mexico under official cover. His assignment

was to develop and train a liaison investigative
unit to be used jointly against the Communist target.
The head of the DFS designated a group of five
agents who could be used in this project (LIVESTOCK).
No sooner had the training program started, than
LIVESTOCK-2 (the team leader) shot a politician.
‘This killing by a member of the President's secur-
ity service caused such an uproar in the newspapers
that LIVESTOCK-2 was jailed until the public forgot
about it, which was almost two years later.

In early 1954, while Harry T, Mahoney and
his wife were occupying temporary quarters after
their arrival in Mexico City, a young Mexican-
American student tapped on the door one day. He
introduced himself to Mahoney's wife as a student
at Mexico City College. He explained that his
mother was an American schoolteacher, and that he
was working his way through college by selling +
eggs, chickens, and cheese to people in the apart-
ment building where the Mahoneys lived. That even-
ing Mahoney learned about the egg salesman and

stayed home the next day to meet him. After that

Embassy and gathered enough background information
for a request for an operational clearance. The
salesman was Raymond H. GERENDE (201-119523) who
became the principal agent for the photographic
bases, acted as a transcriber for LIFEAT, alternated
as a handler for the unilateral surveillance teams,
and performed various other operational tasks from
1955 until 1970.* His family and friends provided
a recruitment field for several other agents within
the operational support agent network of the station.
Ta 1954, the budget requirements for the
Mexico City Station were $463,692,-~ The five cate-

gories were:

Station Support $275,545
FI 133,795

From January 1953 to March 1954, the station for-

By 1955 the-Mexico City Station had tapped
every teléphone line in the Soviet, Czechoslovakian
and Polish embassies, as well as the Communist Party
headquarters. In addition, Projects LIFEAT and
LIPSTICK had the capability for a quick swing off

son in 1956, LIKAYAK-2 developed the unilateral
mail intercept and Mexican Government file search
project (LIBIGHT). Indirectly, LIKAYAK-2 laid the
groundwork for the joint telephone tap operation
(LIENVOY) by introducing his Mexican mentor
(LIELEGANT) to his station case officer, Alfonso G.
Spera, in 195&. In 1969 the LIBIGHT Project, with
LIKAYAK-2 as the principal agent, passed its 13th

C. Station Expansion and Joint Operations
1959 969

The only new requirement in the Related Mis-
sions Directive (RMD)* for 1959 was the addition
of the Chinese Communists as a minor reporting tar-
get even though there was no official Chinese Com-
munist establishment in Mexico, (The Mexicans had
diplomatic relations with the Chinese Nationalist
Government.) There was a flurry of acti-
vity which resulted in
having a troupe of Coy Communist acrobats

denied entry to Mexico.

The outstanding achievement of the station in
early 1959 was the setting up of a joint 32-line**
telephone tap center (LIENVOY), backstopped by the
President of Mexico This gave the station the
capability for intensified coverage of the Soviet
and Satellite installations.

In July 1959 the Nogales Base, after operating

for three years, was closed.

General James Doolittle of the President's Board of
Advisors on Foreign Intelligence Activities visited
Mexico for a study of station activities. Pat M.
Holt of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee was
briefed on Soviet and CP activities during the same
month.

In November 1961, two inspectors from the staff
of the Inspector General (1G) spent four days in-
specting the station. The inspectors reported that

the Mexico City Station was the best in WH and pos-

sibly one of the best in the Agency. It hada broad
eA

range of assets commencing with a close personal Y
relationship between the station chief and the Presi- -
dent of Mexico, high-level telephone taps, photo-

graphic surveillance, unilateral intelligence assets,

and a broad scale of CA capabilities. The station

had been aggressive and well managed with the excep-

tion of a possible tendency to neglect administra-

tive details. During 1961 the station produced 722

intelligence reports of which about 45 percent came i

from telephone tap operations. [The_t: ili-

for offensive purposes. On 25 October 1962, with
the approval of Headquarters and Ambassador Mann,
Scott met with Lopez Mateos in Mexico City and
showed him photographs (supplied by Headquarters)
of some of the areas where Soviet missiles and
launching sites were located in ryan Lopez was

very grateful for this briefing.

In November 1962, approval was obtained to

open a base in Merida, Yuca tan.

base was to provide support to possible paramilitary
operations against cuba”

In January 1963, four additional secretaries

arrived at the Mexico City Station with designee

cover. They were needed because of the increased

-emphasis on technical operations against the Cuban

and Soviet installations and the vast quantity of
paper produced by these operations which could not
be processed by the previous start.

At the request of Headquarters and the{ Gua tema1a}

Station, the Mexico City Station devoted a great

deal of time and manpower to the coverage of the

activities of Juan Jose Arevalo Bermejo (201-006803),
former President of Guatemala, and a candidate in
the 1963 presidential elections of Guatemala. Sta-
tion operations against Arevalo included a LIFEAT
telephone tap, an informant (LICOOKY), and physical
and photographic surveillance (LIENBRACE and LIENTRAP),
From some of the information collected through these
sources, the Mexico City Station prepared a compos—
ite photograph of Arevalo and the Soviet military
attache’ to Mexico, Alexander G. Sidorov (201-018498),
standing together in the lobby of the apartment build-
ing where Sidorov lived. This photograph appeared
in at least three Guatemalan newspapers 2

In May 1963, Scott learned "confidentially"
from Gustavo Diaz Ordaz that he would be selected
by Lopez Mateos as the next President of Mexico.
Later in the year, Diaz became the PRI candidate

himself as Lee Oswald and Harvey Oswald. This

1964, It was ostensibly to pay for his two body-
guards during his campaign tours. In reality, it
was paid to LITEMPO-1 (Diaz Ordaz' nephew) and may
well have gone into his pocket, This was in addi-
tion to a regular salary of $512 per month paid to
LITEMPO-1 as a station support agent.

The LITEMPO Project provided cover for a
16-millimeter passport camera concealed at the
Mexico City International Airport.* For the first
two years, Robert Zambernardi, the station technical
officer, serviced the camera and picked up the film
during meetings with the Mexican Chief Immigration
Inspector (LITEMPO-10) in locations other than the
airport. In 1964 the operation was turned over to
their replacements, Lewis D. Humphrey, Jr. and
LITEMPO-11). Later, the operation was turned over
completely to indigenous personnel under LITEMPO-12.
The film was delivered by LITEMPO-12 to his case

spot because Mexico was the only direct air link

between Cuba and Latin America,

Station personnel devoted considerable time
providing support for JMWAVE and other stations on
a worldwide basis in their coverage of the Cuban
target. This support consisted of: obtaining
travel permits for Cubans to enter Mexico; obtain-
ing visas for Cubans to enter the United States;
renting and servicing accommodation addresses; and

briefing, debriefing, training, and dispatching

agents to and from Cuba. The station also handled
Cuban defectors who chose to make the last minute .
jump in Mexico City rather than return to Havana =
One of the most demanding of these support cases
was the reception and protection of the younger sis-
ter of Fidel Castro Ruz who was surfaced in Mexico
City on radio and television on 29 June 1964. The
station then kept her sequestered for the better
part of a month. She and her two friends were first
accommodated for four days in the luxurious guest
house of an American in the outskirts of Mexico City.

JMWAVE case officer who remained with the three
women throughout the unorthodox situation, was flown
to the destination and back in the private plane of
still another friend of the station. Finally, when
the delights of the Pacific retreat began to pall,
the group was taken to a career agent's ranch located
& couple of hours south of Mexico City. In eddition
to protective custody, the station was called upon
to provide daily mail service to the group for the
two weeks they were at the ranch. On 24 July 1964,
they were restored to their relatives in Mexico city

accomplish this wide range of tasks, the station
was organized into Soviet, Cuban, Satellite, Covert

This center screened refugees (about 350 per week

and debriefed those with information of intelligence
value.

During 1964 approximately 47 percent of the
station's cable traffic was concerned with Cuban
operations, and 70 percent of the positive intel-
ligence concerned Cuban travel. The staff of the
station had increased to 87 (54 inside and 33 out-

The budget for fiscal year 1964 was $2,278,219.

In the CA field, the inspectors noted in 1964
that the Mexico City Station had a comprehensive
and competently managed program. It had effective
projects in media, and and in the

and fields.

Three of the station's media operations
(LILISP-z, LILISP-M, and LISIREN) included press
placement in two major daily newspapers, a weekly
press bulletin with wide distribution, a weekly
magazine for mass distribution in rural areas, radio
and TV programs, and a mechanism for publishing vari-
ous pamphlets and bulletins on a spot basis. In 1964,
the three principal media projects constituted the
most costly in the station's operational program

The inspectors in 1964 also looked over the ;
file room, They considered the Mexico City Station :
files _as being more complete than those of any other
station in the Western Hemisphere Division. There

were more’ than 9,000 personality files, a large

number of subject files, and a vast accumulation
of 3x 5 cards. The volume of the files was in-

creasing at the rate of almost two linear feet per
68/

month,

The file section also had responsibility for
name tracing for other Embassy components,* prepa-
ration of pouches to Headquarters and lateral sta-
tions, indexing, cross referencing, and filing.
The smooth functioning of this section was hampered
by a lack of trained clerical employees. It was
difficult to get people to accept an assignment in
the file room because the tasks were dull, tedious,

and infinitely demanding of the individuals' time.

During 1965 two key officers were transferred ‘
from Mexico City to the Dominican Republic. They
were David A. Phillips, chief of the Cuba Section,
and James M. Flannery, chief of the CA Section.
In response to an amendment in the RMD for
1965, the station began reporting information on
leaders and activists of the Communist and extren-
ist movements for the Key Subversive Watenlist.—
For budgetary and operational reasons, the
Merida Base was closed in May 1965 and emphasis was
concentrated on covering the Cuban target in Mexico
City by an increase in the outside case officer com-
plement and inside offical staff of the Cuban Section.

cover slot in 1967 and 1968, that of assistant
attache for the Olympic Games, which was filled by
Philip A. Agee. This Headquarters-directed assign-
ment was of marginal value to station operations.*
The station holdings of classified materiel in
the file room continued to expand to the point that
by the end of 1967, they measured 1375.5 linear
feet (874.0 for subject files and 501.5 for index
cards). This tremendous influx of paper came
largely from the extensive technical operations.
The chief of station maintained a close personal
hold over the administration of files and felt”
strongly with regard to his need for this volume of
classified material. To a Headquarters survey team
in late 1967, he pointed out that he felt he would
get adequate advance warning of any critical emer-
gency, in which case his plan was to ship the clas-
sified material to the United States. It was esti-
mated that it would take approximately six days and

In addition to the Soviet Union, Czechoslo-

Slovakia had any serious commercial interests in
Mexico.” Under the aegis of a commercial treaty
of 1949 and a payments agreement effective in 1950,
the Czech commercial office actively worked to re-
capture its prewar market for textile machinery,
machine tools, and consumer goods in the face of
strong competition from Germany and Japan. A
degree of success was evident from the fact that
Mexican imports from Czechoslovakia in 1956
($1,900,000) were more than double those of 1955.

an extensive network of double agents. These were
terminated one by one as individual evaluations of
these operations revealed them to be of dubious
value to CIA as compared with their greater value
to the Soviets. This program was followed by the
development of access agents through recruitment

From the time the station opened, several
Soviet officials were singled out for recruitment

1964. A controlled staff agent enrolled at the
University of Mexico School for Foreigners and
acted as a spotter of agents in contact with Soviet
intelligence officers, also enrolled at the school.
The purpose of the project was to obtain information
concerning the personnel, targets, and methods of
operation of the Soviet intelligence service and to
identify American students being developed by the
Soviets. The first yearly estimate of the cost

for the project was $9,840 for the period 1 August
1957 through 31 July 1958. The Mexico City Station
case officer who developed this operation was
Charles K. Jett,

The University of Mexico School for Foreigners
was set up as a place to provide Spanish language
training for foreigners, primarily American students
who planned careers in Latin American studies. The
University of the Americas (formerly Mexico City

arts courses and fine arts workshops were taught in
English while the students were learning Spanish.
This atmosphere of several hundred students pre-

sented the Soviet intelligence service with an

ideal pool of candidates to choose from. Most of
the students were impressionable and naive, re-
sponding to the attention of other foreigners in-
terested in them. Four young Soviet intelligence
officers from the Soviet Embassy in Mexico City :
were enrolled at the schools and quickly made head-
way contacting the students. Some of these stu-
dents reported their contacts to the US Embassy,
and others were spotted and developed by the out-
side LIMOTOR staff agent. LIMAGPIE was one of the
first students to walk into the Embassy. He was
handled as a project separate from LIMOTOR. Alfred
L. KONITZER (201-185999) was recruited at Headquarters
and enrolled at the University of the Americas in :
October 1957, acting as an agent spotter for the i
LIMOTOR Project. !
Within the first few years of the project

some 20 sources had been used at various times to

report on contacts with the Soviets but their short
one-quarter schooling in Mexico (in many instances)
then going on to another location, created all

sorts of security problems, Nevertheless, a 4

develop within the LINOTOR complex. In other pro-
fessional areas, the Mexico City Station already
had a half dozen time-consuming double agent opera-
tions against the Soviets. In the LIMOTOR Project,
the Soviets were not so interested in obtaining
information as they were in guiding the young stu-
dents into a US Government career. This raised
the policy question of how far CIA could go in en-
couraging these students to maintain contact with
the Soviets, knowing that this contact would sur-
face (perhaps against them) if they should seek
employment in some sensitive US Government job at
some later date. In one test case the Mexico City
Station was advised by Headquarters that LINOTOR-21,
who had passed the Foreign Service examination,
should not be considered for recruitment as a double
agent. It was also stated that while Headquarters
could attempt to clear him with the State Department
security that "at best LIMOTOR-21 would never be

fully trusted by State Department Security."
This raised the question of why CIA was engaged in
these operations involving young, naive American

students if they could not be protected (assuming,

government. Massip's tour im Mexico (February
1959 to March 1960) was characterized by a series
of unpleasant incidents. Soon after his arrival,
he alienated the Mexican Foreign Ministry by re-
fusing to pay the normal courtesy calls upon many
of his colleagues in the diplomatic corps because
they represented "dictatorship countries." He
aleo ignored many Western ambassadors at formal
receptions, and associated principally, if not ex-

clusively, with Soviet Bloc representatives, In

October 1959 Massip appealed to the Mexican public
for support of Cuba in a "moment of imminent dan-
ger" from aerial bombardment by planes operating
from “foreign bases." In January 1960 Massip
publicly aligned himself with the Mexican Commu-
nist painter, David Alfaro Siqueiros, during the
latter's attacks against Mexican President Lopez
Mateos.* The Mexican press charged Massip with
interfering in Mexican affairs. He was subse-
quently recalled to Cuba and assigned to Ghana.

Jose Antonio Portuondo Valdor (201-40662)
replaced Nassiz in June 1960 as Ambassador to Mexico.
After experiencing difficulties in using the Mexican
press as a propaganda outlet, he turned to direct
agitation among students and labor. Portuondo, a
former university professor, invited Mexican pro-
fessors to teach in Cuba and reportedly paid $8,000
to 12 students of the National Polytechnic Insti-
tute in Mexico City to organize and pay for agita-
tion in support of Cuba, The Mexican Government

retaliated by confiscating all incoming propaganda

* In 1959 Lopez Mateos ordered raids on Communist
Party headquarters, arrested Siqueiros and a number
ofmrcy leaders, and expelled two Soviet diplomats
for plotting in a nationwide rail strike.

materials from Havana. The searches at the Mexican
airport of baggage of incoming travelers from Cuba
were so intensive that Portuondo went to the Mexi-
can Foreign Ministry to ask that Cubans be permitted
to travel through Mexico to other countries without
having their baggage searched, The Mexicans, of
course, went right on searching baggage of those
who had a stopover in Mexico. Furthermore, the
Mexican ringleaders in the pro-Cuba demonstrations

were arrested and thrown in jail, and kept there

for as long as six months before they were sentenced.

They were charged with "social disruption" which,
under Mexican law, resulted in sentences of from
five to ten years.

Carlos Lechuga Hevia (201-262106) replaced
Portuondo in May 1962 as Cuban Ambassador to Mexico.
Lechuga was not particularly active in Mexico and
soon went on to become Cuban Ambassador to the
United Nations in New York. This appointment led
some to believe that Cuba no longer considered
Mexico as its key springboard for Latin America.

Joaquin Hernandez Armas (201-301755) arrived

in Mexico in May 1963 as a replacement for Lechuga.

Hernandez did not participate in the Castro revo-
lution to any extent, but his CP membership dated

to his student days in law school at the University
of Havana. In 1946 he was head of the CP in Pinar
del Rio Province where he was said to be active in
party espionage activities. He served in the Cuban
Foreign Ministry under Castro and then was Ambassador
to Brazil (1961-1963).

Mexico was the only country in Latin America
which had continuous diplomatic relations with Cuba
from the time Castro assumed power. The Cuban Em-
bassy in Mexico City was staffed with four officers
in 1959 and expanded to 28 Cuban officers by 1968.
Half of those were known or suspect Cuban intelli-
gence officers. There were three Cuban consulates
in Mexico in the port cities of Merida, Veracruz,
and Tampico. They were staffed in Veracruz and

{ Tampico by a consul in each and by two vice consuls
at Merida. All were known or suspect intelligence

officers. They handled Cuban fishing boats and

There were five branches of the Mexican-
Cuban friendship associations run by Mexicans but
supported by Cubans. They were located in Veracruz,
Monterrey, Tampico, Morelia, and Mexico City. They
distributed pro-Castro propaganda and maintained a
steady program of free cultural events attractive
to students. From 10 to 20 such students were
given free trips to Cuba each month beginning in
1968 as "scholarships." Travel from Mexico City

to Havana was provided by Cubana, the Cuban Govern-
ment airline. 135,

The Cuban consul in Mexico City was the co-
ordinating point for arranging travel of a steady
stream of pro-Castro revolutionaries to Cuba from
throughout the Western Hemisphere. Some went for
sightseeing trips, and otherswent for guerrilla
training. A large percentage of these travelers
were dissident students from the United states.

During 1968 there was a sharp increase in
the number and type of Cuban travelers. These in-
cluded visits to Mexico of a Cuban ballet group, a
theater group, lecturers, artists with exhibits,
delegations to international conferences, and

travelers to the Olympics.

Prensa Latina was the Cuban Government press
organization which operated worldwide. In Mexico
City, it hada staff of 13 employees in 1968 and

1387
had direct teletype service with Havana.

CIA operations against the Cuban target were
developed by Thomas J Hazlett who was assigned to
Mexico City under official cover in February 1957
as the officer responsible for CP exile operations.

Hazlett was an unusually energetic and imagi-
native officer with fluent Spanish, who had the
personality and background that appealed to exile
intellectuals, He assembled information from in-
formants among exiles, such as LINLUCK, and targeted
the unilateral telephone tap, LIFEAT, against leaders
of the groups as they were identified. He used
agents from the Mexican security service (LIVESTOCK)
to supply information from their files on the activi-
ties of various exiles, Thus, he located their hang-
outs and meeting places which were usually restau-
rants and coffee shops, then circulated in these
places developing friendships. In 1958, Hazlett
chanced a meeting with Gustavo Arcos Bergnes, a

leader of the pro-Castro 26th of July Movement

in Mexico. An avid reader, Hazlett visited every
leftist bookstore in Mexico City collecting paper-
backs published by leftist exiles. By the time he
met the authors, he had read most of their books
and had mutual topics to engage their interest and
gain their confidence.

In August 1959 two officers of the Cuban Em-
bassy in Mexico (LITAG-1, 201-267743, naval attache,
and LITAINT-1, 201-98818, air attache) walked into
the US Embassy office of the naval attache and ex-
pressed their dissatisfaction with the Communist
influence over the Castro government, Hazlett
talked with them and they agreed to remain in their
positions and cooperate with CIA. Both of these of-
ficers were used as sources until early 1960 when
they defected to the United States.*

In October 1959 Hazlett made contact with

LITAMIL-1 who helped develop a network of 18 access

In April 1960 Hazlett recruited LITAINT-2
(a close friend of LITAINT-1) and developed, from
information supplied by him, a network of 14 access

agents who performed various tasks.** Five of

them formed a "goon" squad which carried out harass- ,__
ment operations such as tossing "stink" bombs inside 7
Cuban installations, painting city walls with anti-
Castro slogans, saturating the Cuban Embassy gate
with false telephone calls, distributing false in-
vitations to Cuban Embassy receptions, and scatter-
ing anti-Castro leaflets clandestinely at night.
Another one recruited the garbage and trash col-
lector from the Cuban Embassy. °

When the chief of station returned from a

station was directed against the Cuban Embassy and
the Cuban exile community in support of the JMARC
operation. Jack Stewart was assigned as a second

case officer under official cover to work with

Hazlett on the Cuban target. During 1960 the Mexico
City Station had agents who were members of the
Cuban Embassy staff and others who were closely
connected with the Embassy staff. The station also
had the cooperation of the Mexican Government through
LIENVOY and LITEMPO for support and security protec-
tion. Travel control was provided by LIFIRE. An ‘out-
side covert action group working on the Cuban target
was set up by Moos in August 1960 but was
compromised in November 1960 when two briefcases

Two months later three officials from the Cuban !

Lucas Roig Ortega (201-324221) defected and, after

a press conference arranged by the station, departed
for the United “States. He had previously been
recruited by Hazlett.

In October of this same year the station set
up in an apartment just across the street from the vA
front gate of the Cuban Embassy a photographic
surveillance project which provided photographs of
visitors and license plates of automobiles of in-
terest. By tracing license plate numbers and show-

and exploited some of them for intelligence purposes.
This photographic surveillance project was identified
by the cryptonym LIONION.

The Merida Base was opened in December 1962 to

provide support for Cuban operations in Mexico.*
Robert T, Shaw was assigned to Mexico City as
the case officer for Cuban operations in April 1963
as a replacement for Hazlett who was transferred to
the Dominican Republic. In October 1963 David A.
Phillips, former chief of the CA Section, was added vA i

informants and to consolidate their administrative
control into three formal projects: LIRAVINE,
LICOMET, and LIRENO. Information from these in-
formants was supplemented by that obtained from a
surveillance teams, telephone taps, audio opera-
tions, and the Mexican security service.

The telephone taps (LIFEAT and LIENVOY) and 5
audio operations (LISAMPAN) revealed Cuban involve~
ment in subversive activities in Latin America.
One example of this activity was a naturalized
Mexican of Spanish origin, Victor Rico Galan (201-
336474). He was one of the founders of the pro-
Castro National Liberation Movement in Mexico.
He visited Cuba for two months each in 1962 aad a
1963. In late 1963, at Cuban direction, he visited
several Central American countries, Venezuela, and
Brazil, contacting key Communists. He again visited
Cuba in 1964 and 1965. In Mexico his contacts with
members of the Cuban intelligence service at the
Cuban Embassy increased sharply. In 1964 and 1965
he took trips to Guatemala and the Dominican Repub-
lic. The Mexico City Station had followed his

activities from the unilateral telephone tap project

(LIFEAT) and passed some information on him to the
Mexican Government which whetted their appetite
enough for them to put him on the joint telephone
tap coverage (LIENVOY).* This revealed intense
criticism of the Mexican President Diaz Ordaz and
that Rico Galan was trying to form a new leftist
political party in opposition to the PRI. The re-
sult was that the Nexican Security Service picked
him up in 1966, He was subsequently charged and
convicted of being a part of a conspiracy against
the Mexican Government.

The Mexican Security Service (through LITEMPO) !
cooperated closely with the station on Cuban opera-

tions. This included security protection and ex-

change of information. For example, in September
1966 a wooden box fell off a delivery truck in
Mexico City and broke open. The box contained guns.
The security service investigator called to the
scene was a station agent, LITEMPO-12. He and"
another agent went to the address on the box, a
small residence in Mexico City, and arrested the

two people there, ‘Two agents remained in the empty
house and a short while later, after a tap on the
door, the cultural attache from the Cuban Embassy,
Julian Lopez Diaz, walked in. He flashed his dip-
lomatic identification but the Mexican agents (after
checking with their headquarters) tore it up,
searched the man and discovered $6,000 in $20 bills
in his wallet. They took Lopez to the security
service detention room and held him incommunicado
for 72 hours while he was being questioned. By
almost sheer accident, the Mexican service had
stumbled onto a shipment of arms intended for the
Guatemalan CP guerrilla group. The police seized
an additional $4,000 and a large quantity of car-
bines, submachine guns, and ammunition at the resi-
dence which was the home of a Guatemalan revolution-
ary. Lopez was released to the Cuban Ambassador
and declared persona non grata. The Guatemalans
and Mexicans were sentenced to prison terms.
The Cuban diplomats in Mexico resorted to
terrorist tactics when it suited them. In September
1968 they kidnapped from a Mexico City street a

Cuban (former code clerk AMDAUB-1, 201-802332) who

had been granted asylum in Mexico
The Cubans took him to the Cuban Embassy
and drugged him until departure of the next Cubana
flight when the Cuban Ambassador and two Cuban Em-
bassy diplomats waving pistols attempted forcibly
to put him on the flight to Havana. Fortunately,
AMDAUB-1's caretaker had advised the station that
AMDAUB-1 was missing when he did not return from
an unaccompanied trip into the city. Thestation
notified LITEMPO-12 who arranged for a "stake-out"
at the airport and at border points. When the
Cubans arrived with AMDAUB-1, LITEMPO-12 inter
vened 2nd took them into a small office wiere he
asked the Ambassador and his two aides to wait
while’ he and ANDAUB-1 talked in an inner office.
Once inside the inner office LITEMPO-12 locked the
door and had AMDAUB-1 sign a statement that he was
being forced to go to Cuba against his wishes.
Next, LITEMPO-12 telephoned for a ladder to be,
brought to a window from the inner office to the
outside of the building below. He and AMDAUB-1
climbed out the window and down the ladder to a

leaving the Ambassador and his two aides waiting
in the outer office. They were furious when they
learned that the defector had gotten away. Both
the Cubans and the Mexicans had considerable press
play over this episode. *

LISAGA-1 proved to be an embarrassment to CIA
and the Méxican Government. He was a Mexican opera-
ting in Cuba for CIA under Mexican diplomatic cover,
who was discovered by the Cuban intelligence service
and exposed publicly. Their complaints to the Mexi-
can Government were brushed off as improperly pre-
sented. **

For reasons dictated by a nationalist foreign
policy, Mexico appeared to have "bent over backwards"
to avoid a break with Cuba, in spite of considerable
evidence that Cuba used Mexico as a base to conduct
subversive operations in the United States and Latin
America. There was no reason to- believe that Mexican
foreign policy would change so long as Cuba's subver-

LIRAVINE

This project was submitted in late 1964 by
Robert T. Shaw for the purpose of consolidating
into one administrative group a number of active
Cuban informants, some of whom had been working
for CIA since 1959, The objective was to develop
positive intelligence and counterespionage informa—
tion on the activities and personnel of the Cuban
Embassy complex in Mexico, with a view toward re-
cruiting intelligence officers and placing techni-
cal devices inside the official installatioas.
Both of these objectives were realized. The agents
inside the Embassy provided CIA with sufficient
casing data to permit the installation of the only
unilateral audio network (LISAMPAN) in any Cuban
Embassy in the world.

The project was approved in 1965 at a cost of
$20,000. Through some expansion and turnover of
agents who left the area and were replaced by new
recruitments, the cost edged up to about $30,000

for 1967 but dropped again to $20,000 in 1969 when

some of the fat was taken out of the budget by re-
moval cf marginal informants.

The first project provided for 11 access
agents. The most productive of these were the
LITAMIL's and the LITAINT's. Marginal agents were
LIOLEO-1, LISICLE-1, AMSEVER-2, AMPACA-1, and

LICARD-1, °

LITAMIL-1_(201-267298) od

This agent was born in Cuba in 1913. Becom-
ing extremely anti-Batista, he went to Mexico City
as a young man and went to work in a printing com-
peny which he later bought. He was an original
member of the 26th of July Movement and had contribu-
ted $50,000 to this group. The leader of this group,
Gustavo Arcos Bergnes, was also a close friend of
LITAMIL-1.

Hazlett, in the course of developing informa
tion on Communist exile activities during 1957 and
1958, had met Arcos and held several conversations
with him. LITAMII-1 knew of this acquaintanceship
because he had taken telephone messages from Hazlett

when Arcos was not at home. He had also telephoned

_ Hazlett on one or two occasions when Arcos could not

keep an appointment.

When Castro took over the Cuban Government,
Arcos returned to Cuba and received an appointment
as Ambassador to Belgium. Hazlett was still fol-
lowing unilateral telephone coverage of exile ac-
tivities and learned that Arcos’ old friend,
LITAMIL-1, was becoming disillusioned with Commu
nist influence in the Castro government,

In October 1959, Hazlett contacted LITAMIL-1
as a friend of Arcos and arranged a meeting.
LITAMIL-1 agreed to cooperate with Hazlett and pro-
vide information on persons in the pro-Castro Cuban
colony who still considered him as a part of the
revolution. This cooperation led to the recruit-
ment of practically all of the early sources on
Cuban activities in Mexico and lasted until 1963
when Hazlett left Mexico. LITAMIL-1 received no
CIA salary but was given a loan of $800 in 1959 for
which a request for repayment was not made because
of his valuable service to the station. .
LITAMIL-2 (201-275992)

Hazlett met LITANIL-2 on 13 April 1960 in com-
pany with LITAMIL-1 in Mexico City. Hazlett had

learned (from LITAMIL-1) that LITAMIL-2, once a fan

of Fidel Castro, had “soured” on the revolutionary
government of Cuba sometime during 1959 when a
hoped-for job in the Cuban Embassy in Mexico did
not materialize. He agreed to cooperate with
Hazlett and was recruited for use as a cutout for
LITAMIL-3, consul of the Cuban Embassy in Mexico
(1959 to 1961).*

LITAMIL-2 was born in 1918 in Cuba and lived
in the United States from 1936 to 1941 when he
moved to Mexico City as an employee of the Venus
Pen Company.

When Castro was in Mexico, prior to 1957,
LITAMIL-2 joined the 26th of July Movement and
worked as a support-type officer. He rented safe-
houses, automobiles, and other equipment which were
needed. On occasions, he fed and housed the train-
ees in his home in Mexico City. LITAMIL-2 worked
closely with Castro but did not join the expedition
back to Cuba in the Granma*% he remained in Mexico

City assisting the revolution by collecting money

which he used to buy arms and equipment for Castro
and the group in the Sierra Maestra Mountains of
Cuba, He also took part in the establishment of a
clandestine radio station in Mexico which served
the Castro forces with information and propaganda.
Following the Castro victory, LITAMIL-2 went to
Cuba but, to his dismay, was snubbed by Castro who,
according to rumor, thought LITAMIL-2 had leaked
information to the Mexicans. LITAMIL-2 returned
to Mexico somewhat disappointed by this treatment.
He also was distressed by Castro's turn to Commu-
nism, At this point, Hazlett met him and made the
recruitment.

LITAMIL-2 agreed to play a middle-of-the-road
role as a CIA agent and continue apparent friendship
for pro-Castroites and anti-Castroites alike.

He was a source of information on all types
of Cubans, and he provided information of a person-
ality nature to use as a means of determining if the
person might be of use to CIA and susceptible to a
recruitment approach.

During 1966 he became friendly with members

of the New China News Agency in Mexico and exchanged

dinner invitations with them at station direction,
While in their residence he memorized the interior
of the house and supplied detailed descriptions

and drawings which assisted the station in making

a technical installation, In fact, he was the only
station source who had been inside the house before
the clandestine entry was made to install the trans-
mitters.

LITAMIL-2's wife was an Am-
erican citizen who was also recruited by the station
to process telephone tap and audio tapes.

LITAMIL-2 was paid a salary of $280 from 1961
until 1963 when he was raised to $300 per month.
This salary continued until 1968 when it was raised
to $320 per month which continued until 1969 when
his salary was cut in half because of a decreased
access and a different approach by the station to
the Cuban target.

LITANIL-3 (201-290894)

Hazlett recruited LITAMIL-3 on 29 November
1960 at a meeting arranged by LITAMIL-1. The meet-
ing was made after the station CA assets placed a

newspaper article brutally attacking LITAMIL-3

(pointing out his alleged pro-Communist activities

in the Cuban Embassy). LITAMII-3 was very upset

over the article and wanted desperately to talk

with some US official to see if this press cam-

paign could not be stopped since he was pro-United

States and wanted to explain that his work in the

Cuban Embassy had always been that of a dedicated

career diplomat. He was anxious to clear his name

with US officials.
LITAMIL-3 was born in Cuba in 1907. He had

spent 31 years in the diplomatic service and served

in Mexico as attache and consul from 1938 to 1952

and from 1959 to 196i. 5
This agent was a proud old man who would not

take any salary from the station. He arranged the

recruitment of four officials from the Cuban Em-

bassy, all loyal friends of his, who agreed to co-

operate with Hazlett (LITAMIL-6, 7, 8, and 9). '

These were known as "deathbed" recruitments because

he introduced Hazlett to each of them at different

times when he was in the hospital awaiting surgery

for kidney stones. As a token of appreciation, the

station paid the hospital bill.

LITAMIL-3 resigned his job from the Cuban
Embassy in 1961 to remain in Mexico. To support
himself, he took a job working for his nephew,
LITAMIL-1, as a salesman at $200 per month, Dur-
ing this time he continued to cooperate with the
station by providing information and identifying
photographs of Cubans and visitors to the Cuban Em-
bassy until mid-1968 when he became a semi-invalid
suffering from a recurrence of kidney stones.

LITAMIL-7_(201-330173)

This woman was the Cuban secretary of
LITAMIL-3 at the Cuban Embassy. Hazlett met her in
the hospital room of LITAMIL-3 the day before he
was to undergo surgery in July 1962. In LITAMIL-3's
presence, she agreed to cooperate with Hazlett and
provide information on persons in the Cuban Embassy.

From 1962 until 1967 (when she retired after
30 years' service) she provided the station with
personality and background information. This =
a valuable source for identification of new employees
and their positions. She also was helpful in identi-
fying LIONION photographs of visitors to the Embassy.

LITAMIL-7 cooperated with CIA out of loyalty

to LITAMIL-3 and, like the proud old man, she re-
fused to accept compensation for her services.
During 1968 she became ill and was hot available
for contact for some time. After her retirement,
her access to information of value to CIA became
virtually nil. The only remuneration she received
was some flowers sent when she was ill and a few
inexpensive gifts.
LITAMIL-9 (201-329609)

Hazlett approached LITAMIL-9 on the night of
18 July 1962. The scene of the meeting was the
hospital room of LITAMIL-3 who lay near death await-
ing the kidney stone operation the following day.
He had summoned LITAMIL-9, an old friend, to the
hospital and then introduced Hazlett. This meeting,
in the presence of LITAMIL-3, lasted three hours.
LITAMIL-9 talked freely of Cuban personalities and
activities but expressed reluctance at becoming in-
volved in clandestine activities with a US official.
At a subsequent meeting, however, he agreed to pro-
vide information. His position as cultural officer
in the Embassy provided no access to classified

information, but his observations gave the station

an additional source on personality data and rela-
tionships inside the Embassy.

He also traveled to Cuba but would not com-
municate with the station from there. In the
spring of 1965 he was transferred to Cuba and re-
mained there until December 1966 when he left his
position with the Cuban Government and obtained
permission to reside in Mexico. When he contacted
the station in December 1966, he was paid $5,000
which represented accumulated salary while he was
in Cuba, although he had not been productive during
that time. He had no access of particular interest
to the station after his return from Cuba, but he

This agent was recruited on 28 April 1960 by
Hazlett who met him when he was trying to contact
LITAINT-1 who, without prior station knowledge,
had crossed the border at Laredo, Texas.* .

LITAINT-2 was born in Cuba in 1930 of a Mexican

mother. He had lived in Mexico City since 1957 and
was a salesman for a television firm when he was
contacted by Hazlett, LITAINT-1 and LITAINT-2 had
been close friends for many years. As a result of
this friendship, LITAINT-2 knew all of the Cuban
diplomats and many of them patronized the store
where he worked. Hazlett developed LITAINT-2 for
access to Cuban intelligence officers.*

In 1962 LITAINT-2 was also used to direct a
harassment team of lower-level agents (LITAINT-8,
9, 10, 11, and 12). This harassment team created
confusion at the Cuban Embassy by throwing "stink"
bombs into the installations, painting signs on the
walls of the Embassy compound, and making anonymous
telephone calls. By ‘late 1963, the station discon- 4
tinued these operations because they were coming
under the eye of the Mexican Security Service and
the Cuban Ambassador was protesting loudly that it
was the work of the American Ambassador. LITAINT-9
was transferred to the LIRICE surveillance team.

The other members of the harassment group were terminated.

* LITAINT-2 was sent by CIA to Miami, Florida, in
November 1960 for clandestine training by the AMOT
group.

LITAINT-2 was also in charge of the Cuban trash
operation. A "rag-picker" sat in the truck that
picked up the garbage and trash from the Cuban
Embassy and sorted out the waste paper that had
writing or photographs. This little garbage-spattered
bundle was turned over three times a week to LITAINT-2
who passed it to the station where the bits were pieced
together and, to the surprise of the station, contained
some worthwhile information. One item was a draft of
a report that concerned contact of an access agent with
a US official. The operation also identified persons
seeking employment with the Embassy or trying to get
visas to go to Cuba.

LITAINT-2 was paid $256 per month salary in

July 1962, and was raised to $304 per month in 1968.

LITAINT-7_(201-288953)

Cuban Embassy and was a source of LITAINT-5 (201-

wife (a consul at the Cuban Embassy) and LITAINT-6
(an employee in the Cuban Embassy Consular Section)
went to the Mexican Minister of Interior and asked
for permission to remain in Mexico after resigning
their positions. LITAINT-7's greatest contribution
was a dramatic defection speech which received wide-
spread covert action coverage. He was retained by
the station as a source until 1965 when he and his
wife emigrated to the United States. He received

no salary.

LISICLE-1 (201-350663)

This agent was a Mexican medical specialist
who first came to the attention of the station in
1964 when he walked into the US Embassy to report
that he had been invited to Cuba to participate in
a medical congress. He was interviewed by a sta-
tion officer and was given some operational train-
ing and guidance for his travel to Cuba. This,
initial assignment rattled him and he returned to
Mexico full of cooperative spirit but psychologi-
cally incapable of performing any task which he
considered risky. He subsequently dabbled at the

Cuban target, attending cultural institute meetings

LICOMET-1 (201-285165) was the titular head
of the unit and principal agent for the project
from 1964 until 1968 when he obtained full-time
employment with a private firm and was replaced in
the LICOMET operation by LICOMET-2’ (201-327270).

The project expanded in size from a staff of
five in 1964 to twelve in 1969. The group consisted
of a principal agent, four interviewers, two secre-
taries, a visa processer, a guard, a janitor, a
receptionist, and an informant in an airline office.
The project cost $30,000 in 1965, $56,000 in 1966,
$50,000 in 1967, and less than $30,000 each year
for 1968 and 1969. The production in 1965 was 52
positive disseminations. During 1966 the figure
increased to 165 disseminations.

In 1967, despite a 75 percent drop in the
number of Cuban refugees arriving in Mexico, intel-
ligence production showed an improvement in both
quality and quantity. During this year, 175 dis-
seminations were made. Of special importance was
information obtained on live practice firings of
SA-2 missiles in Cuba. The project also provided

the station with Prensa Latina pouches which were

opened in the station by the TSD officer, who photo-
graphed the contents, resealed the pouches, and re-
turned them to the LICOMET agent for insertion in

the mail channel to Cuba. These pouches contained
communications from Cuban intelligence assets
throughout the Western Hemisphere. In 1968 the pro-
duction dropped to 46 disseminations, primarily be-
cause of the continued decrease in the number of
Cuban refugees, as well as in their knowledgeability
of information which was of interest to CIA.

One of the problems of the project, over which
the station in Mexico could exercise little control,
was a constant change of LICONET personnel, The
project staff consisted of refugees rather than per-
manent residents, These refugees were, for the most
part, in Mexico waiting to go to the United States.
No one could predict the processing time for US
visas. As a result, it was impossible to plan. for
personnel changes. Oncethevisas were issued, the
refugees, with very little notice, left for the
United States, It was then necessary to train others

to fill the vacancies,

4, Operational Support and Technical Collection
Activities

The Mexico City Station had an extensive net-
work of investigative operations which, for want of
a better term, was called operational support. These
included a unilateral telephone tap capability of
18 lines (LIFEAT); a joint telephone tap capability
of 30 lines (LIENVOY); a unilateral surveillance
team (LIEMBRACE); a travel control operation (LIFIRE) ;
liaison with the Mexican Security Service (LITEMPO);  —~
a mobile surveillance phototruck (LIENTRAP); six
photographic surveillance basehouses (LIMITED, LI-

CALLA, LILYRIC, LIHABIT, LIONION, LITABBY); a mail
intercept (LIKAYAK-2); audio operations (LIPALLET,
LIROMANCE, and LISAMPAN); and highly sensitive tech-
nical operations (LINIMENT, LIMESA, LICASA).

From 1961 through 1969, the station spent ap-
proximately a dollars annually for these
operations. Most of this money was used for payment
of salaries of the large networks of agents required
to maintain the operational bases for these projects.

These operations were the primary sources of

operational information on Soviet Bloc and Cuban

official installations. Mexico City was also a
location with a continuous requirement for short-

term targets and support to other CIA stations

throughout the world. This consisted of surveil- -

lance of agents traveling from Latin America
through Mexico en route to Cuba, providing accomo-
dation addresses, arranging meetings for agents,
hiding Cuban defectors, and providing clandestine
transportation of agents to the US border.
LIFEAT

The basis for unilateral telephone tap opera-
tions was laid in the fall of 1950 when two employees
of the telephone company were recruited by Charles W.
Anderson, III. One was a supervisor for repairs and
maintenance (LIMEWATER-1), and the other was one of
his subordinates (LIMEWATER-2), a lineman who did
repair and maintenance work. These two telephone
company employees were handled by an outside prin-
cipal agent, LIMESTONE. * .
* LIMESTONE worked for the FBI during World War IT
and knew that LINEWATER-1 and 2 placed telephone taps
for the FBI from 1941 to 1945. After World War II,
LINESTONE worked for the Department of Agriculture,
Hoof and Mouth Control Unit, until about 1950 when
they closed some of their offices. He was then hired
by CIA. He died of a heart attack in 1956 while still
employed by the Agency.

The principal agent (as of 1969) was David M.
WILSTED (201-9195) who was hired in November 1951
as a transcriber of Polish in one of the LIFEAT
basehouses. *

During 1951, taps were placed on the telephone
lines of the Soviet, Czech, and Polish official in-
stallations. The cost for the first year was about
$5,000. By the middle of 1955, the operations
coverage had been extended to leaders of the local
CP and Communist-front organizations, and the cost
had increased to $78,000 a year. In 1955, LIFEAT
produced 19 positive and six counterintelligence -
disseminations, The Soviet Bloc country desks WA
judged the operational information of this tap op-
eration to be the best CIA had anywhere. In 1956,
LIFEAT produced 36 positive and 74 counterintelli-
gence disseminations. The cost of the project for
this year shot up to $132,519 which included the

official cover.

During 1957, LIFEAT had 23 target lines and
produced 141 positive intelligence disseminations.
It also covered the lines of several US Communist
expatriates (at the request of the FBI). There
were seven listening posts located near the various
intercept points. The station had plans to add
four or five more lines, but expansion came in the
form of a new operation (LIENVOY).* This was an
unofficial but joint teiephone tap operation with
the Mexican Government. :

The targets of LIFEAT were adjusted to com-
plement coverage by LIENVOY. For instance, in 1960

it was learned that LIENVOY coverage would be placed

on all Soviet and Satellite official installations.
LIFEAT taps were taken off and placed on other
targets of interest to the station.

LIFEAT maintained an average of six listen-
ing posts (as of 1969) and could operate about
three lines from each (in instances where there
were three targets close enough together to run
wires without security problems). One of the
problems with LIFEAT was its cost, which hovered
around $100,000 a year. Salaries and fixed allow-
ances for this network of Americans and
Mexicans were $73,241 in 1969. Rent for listening
posts amounted to $16,600 for the same period.

Positive intelligence declined to zero in
1969. The reason for this was elimination of the
disseminations of marginal information. Also,
LIFEAT was used to concentrate on residences of
Soviet Bloc and CP personalities considered sus-
ceptible to recruitment. .

There was no indication that the Mexican Gov-
ernment was aware of this project.

The LIFEAT Project also gave the station a

capability for mounving other unilateral operations,

TELEX system of two Soviet Bloc official installa-
tions.

LIEMBRACE —

This project consisted of a network of nine
agents (a six-man surveillance team, a radio repair-
man, and a two-man phototruck team). This was an
outgrowth of the LIPSTICK Project which was handled
unilaterally from 1952. The surveillance team used
four radio-equipped vehicles in addition to the
panel truck which had a camera with telephoto lens
mounted in a concealment device. As of 1969 the
agents were LIEMBRACE-1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, and 14.
LIEMPTY-10 and 11 manned the phototruck. .

LIEMBRACE-1, 2, 4, and 5 were recruited in
the 1950's under the LIPSTICK Project and were
handled by Joseph G. Sancho, an outside case offi-

cer, until June 1958 when four members of the team

were arrested by the Mexican Secret Service while

During 1958, the project cost an estimated
$24,000 of which $16,200 was for salaries of six
team members. By 1966 the cost had increased to
$50,663. Team members received a monthly salary
of $250 each for the two leaders and $200 each
for their subordinates in 1958. These salaries
had doubled by 1966, increasing the cost of the
project. However, the team members were recruited
when they were young men, some just out of college,
and in order to prevent their leaving for better-
paying positions in private industry, the station
had to periodically increase their wages.

The team was handled by a case officer under
official cover who held clandestine meetings in
various downtown areas with LIEMBRACE-1 to pass
assignments and receive reports. During demonstra-

LIRICE

The LIRICE Project provided for a surveil-
lance team handled unilaterally for investigations
against the CP of Mexico. This project was the
outgrowth of the LIJERSEY surveillance group, re-
cruited in 1957 to parallel the LIPSTICK (LIEMBRACE
group). After the arrest of team members in 1958
by the Mexican Secret Service, one surveillance
team was given the cryptonym LIEMBRACE. The other
team (LIJERSEY) was included in the LIEMPTY Project.
In 1960 the LIJERSEY agents were taken out of the
LIEMPTY Project and included in the LITEMPO Project.
Their cryptonyms were changed to LITED. This change
was made because their outside case officer, Simon D.
CLACKETT, resigned and returned to his home in
Arizona.

In 1961, CLACKETT asked for his job back.

Since the team had not been effective under the

LITEMPO Project the agents were again put under‘

CLACKETT. A fourth cryptonym, LIRICE, was assigned.
agents were included in this project for
various periods of time. They consisted, primarily,

of marginal assets from other projects who were

assigned to surveillance and investigative tasks
under CLACKETT after efforts to use them effectively
in other areas had failed. However, at no one time
were there more than | persons in the group.
These men lacked the education, interest, and moti-
vation to ever develop into good surveillance assets.
The LIRICE Project was approved in May 1961 for
$29,815, of which $13,115 was used for CLACKETT's
salary and allowances. Salaries for | agents
were $10,200. Approximately $6,500 was earmarked
for operational expenses, including the purchase of

a $4,000 automobile.

Ca 29 March 1965, Jeremy KX, BENADUM, career

agent for the LITEMPO Project, called his station
case officer and advised that LITEMPO-4 agents had
arrested two men on the previous Saturday morning,
27 March, The men were conducting a surveillance of
a Panamanian, HYSAGE-1, who met another Panamanian
under LITEMPO surveillance. As the two surveillance
teams came together, the LITEMPO team arrested LIRICE
agents. The LITEMPO surveillance was being conducted
at station request. Clearly, there was a lack of

LIRICE agents were taken to the Mexican Security
Service headquarters and interrogated throughout

the weekend. The two men had a meeting with
CLACKETT scheduled for Monday morning at 1100 hours.
They gave their meeting instructions to the Mexican
police, and LIRICE-1 went along to identify CLACKETT
who was known to him as "Ricardo," Three Mexican
Security agents walked up to CLACKETT, put a gun in
his back and escorted him to their headquarters, He
was relieved of his identity documents (true name),
money, and other personal papers. After questioning
by the Mexican Security Service and intervention of
the station through the LITEMPO Project, CLACKETT
was permitted to leave the country. He resigned
again on 31 March 1965. The agents (LIRICE-1 and 7)
were also released with the project automobile which
had been impounded.

After the above episode, the team members were
again placed under the LITEMPO Project. This arrange-
ment lasted until October 1966. Wade E, Thomas, the
station's CP case officer, was not satisfied with
the LITEMPO handling of the team, justifiably because

the communications were poor and investigations were

conducted in a haphazard manner. Thomas took over
direct handling of the team with LIRICE-5 as his
routine channel of communication to other team
members.

By November 1967, it was apparent that LIRICE
would not become an effective investigative unit.
Team members were constantly being replaced for
various reasons. They had annoying personal problems
that had been tolerated, such as constant requests
for loans and histories of family illnesses for
which they needed money. Their salaries were com-

received less than $300 per month. The other agents
received from $80 to $175 per month. By January
1968 there were only two members of the team left
(LIRICE-1 and LIRICE-7) reporting on the CP target
and neither of them had cover employment, They con-
tinued in contact with the station CP case officer
until 1969 when a decision was made to pay them ter-
mination bonuses and release them.
LIEMPTY

This project was approved in 1958. LIEMPTY

was a new cryptonym for the LIPSTICK Project which

had provided the station with visual and photo-
graphic surveillance of the Soviet Embassy in Mexico
City from 1954. The original agents were recruited
by Charles W. Anderson, III, and Harry T. Mahoney.
One two-story house (LIMITED) and two apartments
(LILYRIC and LICALLA) were used as observation posts
overlooking the front and back of the Soviet Embassy
chancery in Mexico City.
The LIMITED base was used until 1955 as a

LIFEAT basehouse and was occupied by LIPSTICK-7*,
the sister-in-law of LIMESTONE, the first principal
agent of LIFEAT. In June 1955, the house was for
sale. It was located diagonally across a four-street
intersection from the front gate of the Soviet Embassy
compound, the only exit and entrance to the compound.
The station, using a US real estate dealer in Mexico,
LIMOUSINE, purchased the two-story colonial house in
1955 for $12,000, Another $3,500 was spent for reno-
vation, including a concealment area

which faced the Soviet

and balscope lens with room for one person to operate
the camera (provided he was not very large and did not
stand up). Philip Roettinger instructed LIEMPTY-6
(formerly LIPSTICK-14), the agent who moved into the
house after renovation, how to operate the camera

and how to prepare daily operational logs of events at
the gate of the Soviet Embassy. This base operated
without a major security problem until September 1964
when it was closed. The station received word from
Headquarters of a decision to publish (in the Warren
Commission Report) an operational photograph taken
from this base in September 1963 during the time Lee
Harvey Oswald was in Mexico City. Furthermore, the
publication carried the statement that the photograph
was made by CIA in Mexico City and showed an unidenti-
fied person leaving the Soviet Embassy, The photo-
graph (of an unidentified man who appeared to be a
Caucasian) was passed by the station to Eldon Rudd,
FBI agent in Mexico City, on 22 November 1963. Rudd
carried the photograph to Dallas, Texas, where it was
shown to the mother of Lee Harvey Oswald to see if

she could identify the person. Subsequently at a

press conference, Oswald's mother accused the FBI
of showing her a photograph of Jack Ruby, taken by
the CIA in Mexico City. To prove that the photo~
graph was not Ruby, the FBI insisted that it be
published in the Warren Commission Report.

To protect the LIMITED agents, the station '

had no choice but to remove the photographic equip-

ment and relocate the agents, The LIMITED house a
had suffered from a long rainy season in 1964 dur-

ing which time the concealment area caved in,

leaving a gaping hole in one corner of the front

of the building. LIEMPTY-6 and family were moved

to another location in late 1964 (in tho same -
apartment building which housed the LILYRIC base).

The LIMITED property was sold to LIMOUSINE for

$12,000.*

and was maintained by LIEMPTY-14 (formerly ‘

agents to move into LINOUSINE's new building, there
was no question that LIEMPTY-14 was the best ob-
server in the group. The LILYRIC base was moved

into the apartment with no security problans. AS

of 1969, she had completed her 12th year with CIA.

The LICALLA photobase was located in a row
house, also owned by CIA (through LINOUSINE) along-
side the Soviet Embassy property overlooking the
garden and back of the chancery, The agent in this
base was LIEMPTY-9 (formerly LIPSTICK-39). He was
recruited in 1956 by LIEMBRACE-1 as a member of the
LIPSTICK surveillance team, LIENPTY-9 was the
brother of LIPSTICK-47 who was arrested by the Mexi-
can Secret Service in 1958 and resigned when released.
The LICALLA base provided photographs of. Soviet activi-
ties in the garden areas. From the LICALLA reports,
the station determined which Soviets worked in the
same offices, identifying intelligence personnel by
association. The LICALLA work base was located in

the maid's room on the roof of LICALLA and afforded

The LIEMPTY Project was approved in 1959 for
$95,000. This included salaries for agents in the
three photobases, Oliver G. SCANTLING, Raymond H.
GERENDE, the LIENTRAP truck and personnel, and a

man (recruited but untrained) surveillance
team with LIJERSEY cryptonyms who were directed by
an outside case officer, Simon D. CLACKETT. In
1960, the costs declined to $53,000 when CLACKETT
resigned and returned to the United States and the
LIJERSEY agents were transferred to the LITEMPO
project. The costs for 1966 were $45,300 (as a
result of SCANSLING's transfer to Project LIRAZOR).
With the transfer of the LIENTRAP truck to the
LIEMBRACE Project, the cost for 1969 was $43,500.
Approximately $32,000 was spent on salaries for

agents in this group (1969); the remainder was
spent on vehicle maintenance, rents, utilities, and

the street from the entrance to the Embassy. The

Two types of photographic equipment were used.

One was a 35-millimeter Exacta, equipped with a bal-

scope telephoto lens.. The other was a high-speed

“impulse” 35-millimeter camera devised by the TSD

at Headquarters. The lens of this camera was acti-
vated as persons appeared near the entrance of the
target. It photographed continuous shots until the
person moved out of the line of sight of the lens.

Two rolls of 100 5-millimeter film were pr

duced each wee! This film was developed at the

station but sent to Headquarters for exploitation

because of its sheer volume. The manually-operated

balscope provided the station with sufficient daily
coverage of persons visiting the target to satisfy
local operational requirements for identification.
The average yearly cost of the project from 1966
through 1969 was $10,000.

The value of the project was the identifica-
tion of Cuban Embassy official personnel and visi-
tors to the Embassy, for future operational ex-

ploitation such as the recruitment of access agents.

LISAMPAN
LISAMPAN was a unilateral audio penetration

of the Cuban Embassy and consulate in Mexico City
from September 1967 until May 1969 when silence
came to the last of six audio devices. It was the
only unilateral audio operation which CIA had
against any Cuban official installation in the

world, The operation lasted 20 months and cost

CIA about $60,000 for rent and salaries for the sup-
port mechanism. This did not include salaries of
the principal technical specialists, David M.

WILSTED, LIFEUD-2, and John J. McGee who were paid

intelligence, It did yield useful background data
and some very valuable operational leads. Initially,
it also produced a volume of noise, which, if noth-
ing else, added texture to the lives of the six
monitors and transcribers.

LISAMPAN was first proposed in October 1966
when the Mexico City Station learned one of its
agents, LIFEUD-2 (LIFEAT Project), a lineman for
the Mexico City telephone company, would have access
to the Cuban compound in connection with a moderni-
zation program of the telephone system.

Between April and August 1967, during three
entries, LIFEUD-2 installed five hot-miked tele-
phones and one carrier current transmitter in the
Cuban Embassy and consulate offices. The installa-
tions were supervised by David M. WILSTED, American
principal agent of the LIFEAT Project, who in turn
was directed by the inside case officer for the
project, Michael J. Farmer,* and the station's
technical officer, John J. McGee. Management of
the monitors and transcribers was handled by

personnel in this section,

‘Two separate listening posts were established
to monitor the devices, LISARI, located behind the
Cuban compound, and LISASH, located directly in
front of the gate to the compound. In addition,
another listening post was established, as a part
of the LIONION Project, directly across from the

door to the Cuban consulate on the corner. From

this site, LIONION-1 and his mother ran an "impulse" Y

through a carrier current circuit running through
the LISASH listening post, could also listen in on
conversations of visitors to the gatehouse of the

witting of one another. .
LISASH monitored two hot-miked telephones
(DOG and EASY), while LISARI monitored one of the

other three devices on a rotational basis. The

following indicates the location of each hot-miked

ABLE : The telephone of the chief
of Mission.

BAKER : In the office of the Ambas—
sador's secretary.

CHARLIE : In one of the inner offices
: originally; the room was
later changed into a waiting
room, and the take was not
of significant value.

DOG : In the gatehouse to the com-
pound, where visitors to the
chancery were admitted.

EASY : In one of the consular offices.

FOXTROT : In an upstairs consulate of- 5
fice.

In March 1968, ABLE was lost. Through

routine telephone: company maintenance, the tele-
phone instrument was removed by a telephone com-
pany employee and replaced by another telephone.

The company employee was not aware of the CIA opera-

tion. The telephone was lost in the shuffle.

* The LIENVOY Project tapped every telephone in °

the Cuban Embassy. This was a joint project shared
with the Mexicans. The advantage of LISAMPAN

(which to some extent duplicated LIENVOY coverage)
was that it also provided conversations in the areas
of the telephones by persons other than the callers.
Thus, LISAMPAN supplemented the product from LIENVOY.

In October 1968, EASY was lost. The tele-
phone company in another routine action cut the
loop connection for its own use. Efforts later to
reactivate EASY from another listening post were
unsuccessful.

BAKER was lost during the installation of a
new TELEX machine in the secretary's office on
7-16 January 1969. The last tapes did not indicate
that a search or sweep was made for the device, but
rather that the wall block was removed as part of
the normal TELEX installation.

On € May 1969, a countermeasures sweep was
conducted in the gatehouse where DOG was installed.
Since DOG was live-monitored at the time, the loop
was not disconnected and the countermeasures activity
was recorded. The audio device was disconnected,
then reconnected by the sweepers, and at that point
quit functioning. The station was of the opinion
that it was possible that the block was changed
during the test, suggesting that it was not compro-
mised, It was later determined by LIRING-7 (a pene-
tration of the Cuban Embassy) through visual obser-

vation that the wall block was changed. In spite

of this fact, the transcripts indicated with a

rar}

reasonable degree of certainty that the device

was discovered by the sweepers, by the comments: UU
“Hey ... there is something here. It is inside.”

These remarks were accompanied by whistling, sing-

ing, "yoo hoo-ing," high frequency tones, scratching,

and knocking. Furthermore, FOXTROT was either live-

re ee

monitored or taped until 12 May. The conversations

of the Embassy employees indicated very clearly

that they suspected that the Embassy telephone sys-
: tem had been tampered with and that, in the future,
telephone company employees would not be allowed to
enter to make repairs and adjustments.

On 12 May, the station disconnected the loops
to the LISARI and LISASH listening posts and re-
moved all incriminating equipment. (The LIONION
carrier current circuit had already been discon-
nected on 30 April.) LISARI was still able to

live-monitor FOXTROT.

About a week later, still in May 1969, the

DOG and FOXTROT loop connections were remade to

LISARi. The devices were negative, although the

telephones functioned normally. As of 1230 hours,

24 May, CHARLIE was still functioning, but at 0900
on 26 Nay CHARLIE was dead, though.the telephone
performed normally.

In addition to the LISAMPAN devices, there
was a hot-miked telephone in the residence of the
Cuban Ambassador. This was not continually manned
but could be monitored from a nearby listening post
(LIHACK-4). Sometime between 22 and 23 May while
the Ambassador was out of the country the device
was removed, apparently by the Cubans. Although
the station had instructed LIHACK-4 to continually
monitor the device or watch the residence, he ad-
mitted that the surveillance was limited to spot
checking by his wife, The station was, therefore,
unable to determine when the Cubans entered the
residence to take action resulting in the loss of
the device.

It was not resolved whether all the devices
were discovered as a result of a special or routine
sweep, (It appeared obvious enough that DOG, and
subsequently FOXTROT, and the device in the resi-
dence were discovered as a result of the search.)

It was not clear whether BAKER was discovered

accidently as a result of the TELEX installation,
{f discovered at all. It was equally unclear

in statements made by ANBEDEW, a Cuban intelli-
gence officer who defected to CIA. He disclosed
that in February 1969, Armando Lopez Orta, Cuban
intelligence chief in Paris, briefed his subordi-
nate officers on a device found in the Embassy in
Mexico, It was not clear whether this discovery
was that of BAKER, or whether Lopez referred to a
much older installation (LIROMANCE) which had long
since been abandoned.

There was also a question whether the arrival
and departure in Mexico of possible Cuban sweep
specialists was connected with the losses. The
sweep on 6 May, which resulted in the loss of DOG,
was probably conducted by regular Embassy employees.

A possibility considered was the
Cuban Ambassador. The was alp-
proached under a "false flag" (Mexican Government)
by LIENBRACE-4, a member of the station's unilateral
surveillance team, on 15 January 1969 to provide
information on the residence and to allow him to

enter and take photos. At first she was generally

uncooperative and failed to appear for a scheduled
meeting, but on 1 February she accepted the re-
cruitment, reluctantly. On 15 February, he cbtained
a plan of the residence from her; she accepted money;
and, subsequently let him enter and obtain informa-
tion on the telephones. On 24 February she permit-
ted LIFEUD-2 to enter the residence. He changed

the telephone instrument in the office of the Ambas-
sador leaving one which was hot-miked, He had been
instructed to change only the inner component of

the instrument, but found that the screw holes on
the bottom did not match those with the component

he had, so he changed the whole unit instead. The
new telephone was similar to the old one except that
the old one had a cracked dial.

The audio device in the residence worked per-
fectly. LIHACK-4 monitored a conversation between
the Ambassador and unidentified visiting Cubans
that indicated either he and his visitors were un-
aware of the device or were pretending to be unaware.
No really sensitive information was discussed, how-
ever. The device ivom the residence was the last

to be removed but the Cubans may well have noticed

knowing that no conversations could be reported on

The discovery of DOG led to a telephone-by-
telephone search resulting in the finding of FOXTROT

and the device in the residence. It was speculated

as to whether this could have been prevented if all

the loops had been disconnected for sometime after

the loss of BAKER. It would have made the detection
more difficult, but the station could never have pre-
vented the eventual loss of the devices installed in
the telephones because LIFEUD-2 lost access to the

Cuban compound (because of his assignment to another
area) and could not control the telephones. Without
Such control, there was no possible way to prevent

their routine replacement, as was the case of ABLE.

During the period of this operation, about

The operations of this project centered around
a basehouse (Unit 11) equipped with an electrical
apparatus which conducted a technical surveillance
of the Soviet Embassy. The basehouse was a part of
a four-unit complex, collectively known as LIMUST
and owned by CIA. It was purchased by Harry T.
Mahoney (through LIMOUSINE) in September 1957. The
six LIMESA personnel were husband and wife teams
who acted as basehouse operators for three of the
four units in the complex. The fourth unit
(LICALLA) was a phctographic surveillance base
administered under the LIEMPTY Project.

The property cost $50,000 in 1957. Another
$50,000 was spent during the next two years for
rebuilding and furnishing the properties. From
1966 through 1969, the project cost approximately
$12,000 per year, of which about half was spent
for salaries and bonuses, The remainder was spent
for equipment and operational expenses.

of Communications at.a diplomatic reception.- Scott

expressed an interest in communications and was

introduced by the Minister to the Chief of the Inter-

national Section. This was LICASA-1, the only

agent in the project, who was developed socially

by Scott. He was offered $1,000 a month to provide

copies of all Soviet Bloc cable clear text and

coded traffic. At first, LICASA-1 was possessed

with a fear of being discovered but $1,000 a month
was too good to turn down. Scott set up an elabo-
rate meeting system for the first year which in-
volved four persons plus LICASA-1.

Harry T. Mahoney or Frank R. Estancona ac~
companied Scott to a street location where LICASA-1
was parked in his-automobile. Scott, LICASA-1, and
the station case officer then drove in Scott's
quasi-personal car to a safehouse apartment where
Scott and LICASA-1 sat in the living room and
chatted while Mahoney, Estancona, and Anne Good-
pasture copied the telegrams on a high-speed
Rekordak set up in the maid's room off the kitchen.
LICASA-1 was not willing to let the material leave
his possession during 1958, The copying operation
took three people two hours because LICASA-1
brought copies of traffic for three to six months
periods of the previous year. At the first meet-
ing on 17 June 1958, six rolls of 100-foot micro-
film were needed to copy these files. Meetings
were held once a month. By 1959, traffic was ob-—
tained with only a one-month backlog and kept

overnight at the station.

Oliver G. SCANTLING was inserted into the
operation as a cutout for Scott from 1962 until 1969
when the station case officer began meeting LICASA-1.

In addition to Soviet Bloc traffic, the proj-

orn oes

ect expanded to include traffic of most other coun-

tries throughout the world and was considered useful

to the NSA, In June 1968, NSA advised that when the

LICASA production was compared with that from simi-

lar collection resources, it was rated "among the

most valuable." Two-thirds of the production for
i 1967 concerned Cuba, some 40 percent of which was
unique. NSA published 140 reports on Cuba during

1967 as a result of LICASA production. The critical

element in dissemination of this information by NSA
was the delay in receiving the material as the
agent was met only once a month, To speed up this
process, the station began weekly meetings to re-

i ceive information on priority targets.

The project cost was approximately $13,000

fee

per year which included $12,000 for the agent,

gifts, and entertainment.

5. SO was to provide OPC pouch
facilities with the understanding that

OSO had a right to see OPC dispatches.

6. Hunt was to be completely inde-
pendent of OSO financially.

On 20 December 1950, Headquarters advised
the OSO station chief that a letter in regard to
Hunt's assignment had been pouched for delivery to
the Ambassador. The station was asked to find out
if the letter had been received and if so, to have

Hunt report for duty. The OSO station chief
62;

in Mexico replied:
Letter to Aubassador arrived. Mr.

Doyle called in by Counsellor of Embassy

to interpret letter which referred to

Mr. Hunt by his pseudonym and also to

Mexico by cryptonym. This flagrant

violation of security was embarrassing

to both Mr. Doyle and Mr. Hunt.

In a meeting in Mexico in the Ambassador's
office, Hunt advised the Ambassador that he (Hunt)
was assigned to Mexico to set up a new and separate
facility. Operational responsibility was to run,
not through the OSO station, but directly from Hunt
to the Ambassador, Doyle's position at the same

meeting was that, as the ranking CIA officer in

wexico, he should be responsible to the Ambassador
for all CIA activities and operations. At the
Anbassador's request, the matter was.referred to
Headquarters for clarification. Headquarters re-
plied that Doyle was not responsible for opera-
163/
tions of Hunt. Hunt was to have his own cable
facilities when personnel were available and was
responsible only to OPC, Headquarters, and to the
Ambassador. Further, Doyle was not authorized to
see OPC pouches. The Ambassador was not satisfied
with this explanation because he did not wish to
deal with two senior persons representing different
activities of the same government agency. By this
time, Doyle was awaiting a transfer to another sta-
tion. ‘The OSO replacement was Raymond J. O'Mara
who would not arrive in Mexico until June 1952.
Clareace W. Moore, Jr., was sent to Mexico for tem-
porary duty as acting chief of OSO until O'Mara
arrived. Both Moore and Hunt were directly under

the Ambassador until July 1951 when O'Mara was

164,

designated as chief of all CIA activities in Mexico.
Hunt was named deputy chief with specific responsi-

bility for OPC activities. O'Mara was charged with

- 301 -

operational responsibility for both OPC and OSO
activities and was authorized to direct, supervise,
coordinate, and control all OPC functions.

At a meeting with State Department officials
in Washington on 19 July 1951, senior CIA officials
were advised that, as a matter of policy, it was
most desirable that normal overt activity in Mexico
be supplemented by a CA campaign conducted by OPC. =
The CA program in Mexico included all areas of the
public media: press, radio, television, motion
pictures, private journals, and editorial/opinion

publications.

In 1954, the station had four CA projects at
a total cost of about $35,000. The first project
was a funding mechanism using the cryptonym LILISP.
As other projects, dependent on this mechanism for
funding, were approved, they had cryptonyms —
LILISP-A, B, C, D, and through the alphabet to N be-
fore the practice was stopped when the funding

mechanism folded because of the illness of the

Principal agent, LILISP-X was a cryptonym which

identified the funds available for operational de-
velopment activities for any type of CA capability.
In 1961, there were CA projects with a
total budget of $229,600, This increase was part
of an overall WH expansion in political action and
covert operations on Cuba in order to combat and
overcome threats to US security arising from revo-

lutionary turmoil centered in Cuba and the Caribbean
166

in general. For the same reasons, the CA budget
and program continued to expand until in 1964 there

were) projects at a cost of $542,000. Inspec-
tors from Headquarters in August 1964 noted that

the Mexico City Station had a comprehensive and “
competently managed CA program. It had effective
projects in media,

The most important gap was in

the field of which was extremely difficult

to develop because of the firm government control

in this area. LIETHIC, an outstanding Mexican

At this point, there were ca projects.

The bulk of station ck Activities were direc-
ted towards the support of other stations in the
Western Hemisphere. This was accomplished through
use of placement media in the replay of articles
and broadcasts ini support of activities in other
countries in Latin America. a

Historically, there were never more than i)
CA case officers under official cover at the Mexico

City Station at any given period, as compared with

a top figure of FI case officers in (086)
The reason for this was that CA operations were
much more sensitive than most FI operations and
could not be traceable to an official installation.
All of the CA operations were handled heat

contract agents or staff employees using nonofficial

cover. There were of these outside case offi-

cers in (964) but the number was reduced to

should seek support from businessmen such as LISIREN-1,
which he did. Thus, the Mexico City Station did not
believe that LISIREN-3 knew the source of funds

which he received from LISIREN-1.

As the propaganda activities developed,
LISIREN-3 ‘refused to take the advice of LISIREN-1
on communications matters, and the relationship be-
gan to sour.

In March 1963, LISIREN-3 advised David A.
Phillips, the station CA chief, that LISIREN-5
(201-725282), a close personal friend of DCI John A.
McCone, had arranged for LISIREN-3 and LISIREN-5 to
meet with McCone in Washington. The station cabled
Headquarters to be prepared for a request for finan-
cia) support. LISIREN-3 and LISIREN-5 briefed the
Director on the activities of the Social Studies
Center and asked for a direct subsidy of $80,000
per month.

When LISIREN-3 returned to Mexico City, he
contacted Phillips and advised that he did not
really expect to receive $80,000 a month but expected

to receive at least $40,000 per month from CIA which

which included the cost of termination payments.
ARLISS received a salary of $3,000 per year.
LITEAR-1 was paid a salary of $245 per month.
LITEAR-2 was paid no salary because she was the
wife of ARLISS and a full-time employee of the
USIS library in Mexico City. LITEAR-3 was paid a

salary of $235 per month.

Student Operations
The University of Mexico was founded in 1553

(some 80 years before Harvard). It was a faithful
copy of the medieval University of Salamanca until
about 1929 when President Emilio Portes Gil, in a
wave of enthusiasm for democratic processes, rein-

corporated the National University as the National

Autonomous University, entrusting its government to
a mixed directorate, half of the members of which
were elected by the faculty and half by the student
body, with the power of hiring and firing all-per-
sonnel. The result, which should have been antici-
pated, was that the university became a training
school for politicians, The professor who failed

among the student leaders. University politics
took on all the excitement of national politics: |
the same cleavages appeared, and rival student
leaders used the same methods as their elders.

In 1944, for example, the rector (who stood with

the right wing) appointed a director of the National
Preparatory School. The left wing was annoyed, and

on 26 July a battle was fought between those who

were in favor of the rector and those who were not.
Students climbed to the roofs of the buildings and
dropped bricks on the heads of their enemies, two '

of whom were killed. That was all it cost to pro-

cure the resignations of the rector and the newly
181/
appointed director. ;
A new rector, approved by the left wing, was

elected; he was Alfonso Caso, a distinguished

archaeologist. By this time the right wing was un-
happy and raised a row. A self-styled "Committee
for the Defense of the University" staged a noisy

demonstration against Caso, accusing him of being

j a Communist because he was the brother-in-law of
the Marxist Vicente Lombardo Toledano.

ultimatum to Caso's successor demanding more lenient
examinations. A right-winger, he refused to yield,
and the students threw him bodily into the

street. Called “hoodlums" by the Mexico City press,
4,000 students marched in protest against the insult
of being called "hoodlums." President Miguel Aleman
wearily intervened and managed to quiet the storm.

In 1950, the student body of 27,000 was moved
to the new University City where it was hoped. that
the gymnasium, athletic fields, space, and fresh
air would siphon off student surplus energy. If
anything, the students became wilder. In 1952, the
right-wing group ousted the rector; in this opera~
tion the LILISP-C
group.

During 1956 the National Polytechnic Institute
called a strike of 25,000 students demanding re-
Placement of the administrative staff. Student
demonstrations broke out all over Mexico City in
August 1958 over a rise in bus fares, with students
wrecking and seizing new buses. Other strikes and
demonstrations occurred periodically, but the big

outburst came in 1966 when striking law students

took control of the National University and demanded
the resignation of the rector, Ignacio Chavez. An
estimated 2,500 students stormed the administration
building and forced Chavez and at least 35 other
faculty members to submit theirresignations in
writing, which were accepted. The strike began
when two law students were dismissed for distribu-
ting Communist literature. The left-wing law stu-
dents touched off the strike with demands that the
law school dean be dismissed and the students rein-
stated. Chavez refused and was forcibly ousted.
The internal struggle at the university closed
classes to the entire 70,000 student body for two
and one-half months before a new rector could be
agreed upon. Meanwhile, the Mexican Government
proclaimed that university autonomy was a status
related only to academic matters and one not to be
exploited by subversive elements for their ulterior
purposes 7 To put some muscle into the proclama-

IV. Joint Operations And Projects Using
Mexican Government Officials

The branches of the Mexican Government of
particular interest to CIA were the Presidency,
the Ministry of Interior, and the Mexican Secur-
ity Service (called the Department of Federal
Security - Direccion Federal de Seguridad, DFS).

Federal executive authority in Mexico was
vested in one single person who was elected as
President of the United Mexican States or, more
commonly, President of the Republic. Despite the
fact that the Mexican constitutional system shared
some of the characteristics of the parliamentary
system, it was frankly, presidential. In fact,
the President was head of state and head of govern-
ment, contrasting with the parliamentary character-
istic of collective responsibility for government.
The internal structure of the Federal executive
authority possessed a certain degree of flexibility
because the number of ministries and departments

was not fixed by the Constitution, but by lesser

- 372 -

laws which could be modified (as in the United
States) according to the circumstances and the
personality of the President.

The Ministry of Interior (called Secretary
of Government - Secretaria de Gobernacion) was
responsible for the conduct of relations with the
other Federal authorities, with the governments
of the Mexican states, and with the municipalities.
It also provided the Federal judiciary with the
aid it required for the proper exercise of its
functions. This Ministry was responsible for the
appointments of high officials of the administra-
tion, magistrates, and judges after their designa-
tion by the judiciary. A function of this Ministry
of great importance in the political life of the
country was that of controlling, administering,
and monitoring elections. It was responsible for
the supervision of all printed matter together with
all radio and television broadcasts. Furthermore,
it directed the internal demographic policy of the
country, with the exception of the colonization of

unoccupied land and, finally, it exercised control

over all affairs related to internal politics.

This Ministry was often a springboard to the

presidency (all but one of the nine Presidents

of Mexico between 1928 and 1969 served as Minister

of Interior prior to election as president) Samos
Upon recommendation of the PRI, President

Miguel Aleman Valdez created the DFS by presidential

decree in January 1947, The DFS was placed under

the Ministry of Interior. General Marcelino

Inurreta was the first DFS chief and a most ardent

promoter. It quickly became influential as a per-

sonal intelligence service of the President. No -

provision was made for the DFS in the national bud-

get. Funds were, siphoned from the appropriation

of the Ministry of Interior Police (an agency ex-

elusively for law enforcement). At its inception,

the DFS's primary responsibility was the investi-

gation of national security matters; in fact, its

principal attention was given to domestic political

affairs. These functions had been the responsi-

bility of the Attorney General of the Republic,

the Attorney General of the Federal District, and

- 374 - .

the Political and Social Section of the Ministry
of Interior. During the Aleman administration,

the DFS had representatives in each state of the
Mexican Republic and attempted, through its sources,
to penetrate the political parties and movements
opposed to the government. The DFS also engaged in
placing informants with civilian governmental agen-
cies and military installations to report on dis-
loyal employees. The DFS had no power of arrest
and was obliged to depend upon other police organi-
zations for this function. Sometimes the DFS in-
vestigators merely borrowed and used credentials
belonging to other policemen for this purpose. The
early days of the DFS were marked by illegal ar-
rests, killings, detentions, extortion, blackmail,
and outright thievery. The Ministry of Interior,
to which the DFS was nominally subordinate, was
precluded from exerting any control over the DFS
organization and operations. General Inurreta was
Fesponsible only to the President, who was con-
vinced of his personal loyality. When the general

left the DFS at the expiration of the Aleman admini-

Stration in 1952, he took large quantities of modern

police equipment, which had belonged to the DFS,
and established a private investigation and strong
arm group.

Adolfo Ruiz Cortines, Aleman's successor to
the Presidency, continued the existence and powers
of the DFS by verbal decree and, at the same time,
personally ordered the illegal activities of the
DFS investigators to cease. Without the driving
influence of Inurreta, the DFS relaxed its activi-
ties and became relatively innocuous in comparison
to its first five years of life. Colonel Leandro
Castillo Venegas replaced Inurreta as head of the
DFS until 31 December 1953. His deputy was Luis
Suarez Torres. They were replaced in 1954 by
Lieutenant Colonel Manuel Rangel Escamilla as
director and Captain Fernando Gutierrez Barrios
as deputy director

When Adolfo Lopez Mateos came to power in
December 1958, he retained Rangel Escamilla and
Gutierrez Barrios in their positions in the DFS.
Although there were frequent rumors that Lopez

Mateos intended to fire Rangel Escamilla, the

latter remained director of the DFS until 1963.
The real power in the DFS was Fernando Gutierrez

Barrios, who as deputy director revitalized the

service and, under more than normal handicaps,

attempted to give it the semblance of a genuine

nonpartisan investigative agency. Most of the

strong-arm men were dismissed and were replaced

with young lawyers and graduates from the schools

of higher education and from the military academy.

Gustavo Diaz Ordaz was Minister of Interior in the !

Lopez Mateos administration and © eded in bring- .

ing the DFS under control of his Ministry. He was
able to do this because he and Lopez Mateos were
close personal friends with mutual peteeee tas

In 1964 Diaz Ordaz became President of Mexico,
and in May 1965 he named Gutierrez Barrios as direc-
tor of the DFS. .

The DFS was responsible for investigating
activity which endangered the political security
of the country, including espionage, sabotage, and
other subversion. It investigated frauds involving

membership lists of political parties and other

Political irregularities. It was charged with

monitoring the activities of foreign embassies;
most of this effort was directed at the Cuban
Embassy from 1960 to 1969. With regard to the
other foreign missions in Mexico City, the DFS
generally restricted its activity to pericdic
interviews with responsible embassy officials
concerning events of interest to their respec-

tive establishments. The DFS monitored Cuban
travel, overtly and clandestinely, at the inter-
national airport in Mexico City and collected
intelligence on all political parties, labor unions,
governmental miaistries, and other organizatio:

of political interest.

There were 150 agents assigned to the DFS
as of 1966. The service was organized into three
groups: the Operations Group which was respon-
sible for political investigations, special in-
vestigations, and regional representatives; , the
Support Group which operated a telephone moni-
toring unit, archives, photo laboratory, and a
criminal laboratory; and the Administrative Group

which handled vehicles, weapons, credentials, office

of contraband (where the payoff was greater) and
Doyle felt that DFS demands made upon the station,
resulting from association with them, outweighed
any future usefulness. He indicated that a "social"
relationship would be retained in the event that
the station was ever required to call on the DFS
for assistance. __

federal penitentiary until 20 April 1955. During
this time, he remained on the station payroll, but
the DFS agents who had been under him were inactive.

Mexican Government officials was in essence, a
political one. It became an unofficial channel

for the exchange of selected, sensitive political
information which each government wanted the other
to receive but not through public protocol exchanges.
Ambassador Hill and his successor, Thomas C. Mann,
gave their blessing to this relationship but Fulton
Freeman, who replaced Mann in 1964, felt that he
should be the one to confer with the Mexican Presi-
dent on sensitive political matters.*

The telephone tapping operation (LIENVOY) was
successful as a producer of positive intelligence
and was considered by Headquarters as a "model" for 4
imitation by other stations, particularly in the
area of efficient processing and exploitation of
raw take. The reason for this success was the
presence of staff agent Arnold F. AREHART, inside
the listening post. This assignment was vital to
the preservation of CIA's equity in this operation
which cost $150,000 for the installation. Even with
AREHART's presence, there was petty theft of equip-
ment and periodic laxity in processing the tapes.

Independently of the LIENVOY mechanism and
LIBIGHT, CIA maintained a working-level relation-
ship with the DFS through Project LITEMPO. This
project initiaily evolved around a senior FBI agent
(Jeremy K. BENADUM) who resigned from that organi-
zation in Mexico and was recruited by CIA in November
1960. BENADUM had been in the FBI office in Mexico
since 1953 and was the assistant legal attache.
During that time he was responsible for police liai-
Son with the Mexican DFS. He knew Gustavo Diaz Ordaz
in the Ministry of Interior but he knew his nephew,
Emilio Bolanos Diaz, even better. BENADUM and
Bolanos were godparents to each other's children.

BENADUM had hired Bolanos when he was a messenger

in his uncle's (Diaz Ordaz) Ministry of Interior.
BENADUM proposed to bring his sources with him

when he was hired by the station. It was expected

that through BENADUM and Bolanos (LITEMPO-1), the

station could develop an effective penetration of

the Ministry of Interior. As it developed, both

BENADUM and LITEMPO-1 were so self-seeking that

the project floundered for lack of management and

initiative. It became a network of 11 fairly un-

productive and expensive agents until October 1963

when $10,000 of fat was cut from the budget. It

did provide the station chief covert access to Diaz 4
Ordaz and to the DFS deputy director, Gutierrez

Barrios.

Through the LITEMPO Project, the station sub-
sidized the campaign of Diaz Ordaz for President by
providing special radio equipment for automobiles
and a monthly payment of $400 for salaries of two
additional bodyguards. The LITEMPO Project also
operated a concealed passport camera at the inter-
national airport which was used to cover travelers

from Cuba. In 1965 at the request of Gutierrez

of the chauffeur of President Adolfo Lopez Mateos.
Through his political connections, LIFIRE-1 received’
a position in northern Mexico along the US border in
1963 and resigned. He took LIFIRE-4 with him, but
LIFIRE-4 quickly became disillusioned and returned
to Mexico City and was hired again by the station.
The secretary, LIFIRE-2, was terminated when LIFIRE-1
and LIFIRE-4 left Mexico City because the remaining
two agents did not have enough work to warrant full-
time employment for her.

The two agents (LIFIRE-4 and 5) had credentials

tioned at the international airport where they

obtained a copy of the passenger manifest of every
incoming and outgoing commercial flight.* These

two men also extracted information from passports
‘of persons traveling through Mexico of interest to
the station. They provided a limited surveillance
capability and could follow a traveler to his hotel.
However, obtaining travel manifests consumed most
of their time because of the sheer volume of inter-
national flights. Mexico had one of the busiest
airports in the world, which had an average of 75
international flights arriving and departing each
day. These manifests were of great value in
checking travel for the Mexico City Station and
other stations throughout the world. The Mexico
City Station was constantly called on by the local

FBI office for confirmation of travel of persons of

interest to that office. These manifests were

delivered to the station case officer in clan-
destine meetings in an automobile at various loca-

tions in the city three times per week and were

packed in suitcases. The two agents also used a
necktie photographic concealment device for spot
clandestine photography.

Headquarters rated this project as perhaps
the most prolific and reliable source in CIA of
timely information about travel to Cuba. Frequently,
it was the only source of information about Cuban
travel of Latin Americans who showed only Mexico
as their destination and concealed their true desti-
nations from their governments. During the period
1 June 1963 through 30 April 1964, the LIFIRE Project
was the source of 615 reports on Cuban travel and
air shipments. The volume of reporting from this
project was consistently high, and much of the travel

data was reported by cable on Headquarters instructions.

In addition to air travel and spot surveillance,
this couple operated a mobile phototruck equipped
with a concealed camera and telephoto lens that oper-

ated through a periscope in a specially-built turret

an economy measure in April 1967 since it dupli-
cated a phototruck operated by the LIENTRAP team.
The LIFIRE Project cost approximately $30,000
for its first year (June 1960 through May 1961)
because of the large investment of equipment, in-

cluding the purchase of two automobiles with radio

communications, However, costs averaged about

$12,000 from 1966 to 1969, of which approximately
$10,000 was paid for salaries and bonuses to the
two agents.

LIKAYAK-2 was an employee in the Mexican
Ministry of Interior in the early 1950's and be-

former Mexican Government official, LIKAYAK-2
formed a private investigation agency. He was

The LIBIGHT Project also provided access to

which included all foreigners except diplomats.

These dossiers could either be copied by LIKAYAK-2

was a valuable asset for checking biographic data
on agents or target individuals. The files con-
tained photographs, copies of passports, marriage
data, residences of the subject, and a notation of
travel to and from Mexico.

a securify unit under him, LIELEGANT reported this
to Scott who met with Lopez Mateos on 16 December

telephone central, This residence had the cover
of a restricted government office.

Mexican Army officers were detailed as tran-
scribers and monitors, Other employees of the
listening post were friends of the Army officers
or persons known to LIELEGANT or his son, LIENVOY-2,
who became the Mexican responsible for the listening
post, The station placed a staff agent, Arnold F.
AREHART, in the listening post as an outside case
officer responsible for supervision and mainten-
ance of the equipment. As of 1969, AREHART com-
pleted his tenth year in this position.

The initial project provided for a listening
post and a separate unit to investigate leads from
the taps. The separate unit (LITABLE) folded quickly.
The agents consisted of semi-illiterate bodyguard
types who could not respond to training. The train-
ing officer, Bernard E. ELAKMAN, was returned to
Headquarters in 1959 (shortly after his arrival in

Mexico) for health reasons. He was not replaced.

The LIENVOY Project cost about $60,000 per
year after its first year. This figure did not
include salary and allowances for the outside staff
agent, AREHART, who worked exclusively on LIENVOY
but was paid from "support" funds. There were ten
Mcxican employees working in the listening post who
prepared the daily transcripts and a summary of
information from the lines which were not fully
transcribed. This summary was delivered each morn-

AREHART. Any items of unusual significance were

The project had many frustrating situations

for office rent and the salary of LIENVOY-19 even
though the office no longer existed and the agent
vas not doing anything for the station. Scott de-
cided to continue making the payments rather than
confront LIENVOY-2 with this fraud and offend him
or his father, LIELEGANT.

LIENVOY-2 also claimed to Scott that two of
the LITABLE agents were retained as investigators.
Scott agreed to subsidize their salaries as a part
of a monthly stipend paid to LIENVOY-2 for oper-
ational expenses. According to AREHART, he paid
all the operational expenses at the listening post
from his station revolving fund. Therefore, the
payments to LIENVOY~2 represented a flat subsidy
of $500 per month in addition to a salary of $480
Per month. This payment of $980 per month to LI-
ENVOY-2 was recognized by Scott as an ante for main-
ining the relationship with LIELEGANT who received
no salary from the station.

FBI in the face of a transfer to the United States
and was hired by Winston M. Scott, COS, because of
BENADUM's numerous contacts in the Ministry of
Interior. One of BENADUM's main contacts was LI-
TEMPO-1, the nephew of the Minister, then Gustavo
Diaz Ordaz.

The budget for the first project year (1961)
was $55,353 which supported four employees of the
Ministry of Interior ($9,000), a five-man surveil-
lance team of agents transferred from LIEMPTY who
had been recruited under LIPSTICK/LIJERSEY ($10,000),
salary and allowance for BENADUM ($21,000), and some
$15,000 for operational expenses. The project suf-
fered constantly from lack of effective management.
The surveillance team reports were of little or no
value because the agents did not receive proper
direction. They were removed from the LITEMPO
Project and placed under LIRICE in 1962. BENADUM
and LITEMPO-1 were so occupied with station requests
for operational support and security backstopping in
connection with the JMNET operation that all other

aitivities were neglected. They arranged through

Chetumal and Cozumel for use during the Bay of Pigs
veperation, the evacuation of an unmarked C-54 Agency
plane with a Cuban exile crew which made a forced
landing in Chiapas, the location and arrest of
Cuban nationals who had deserted their training
posts in Guatemala and were "at large" in Mexico,
and the legal entry into Mexico of Cubans whose
presence was necessary in connection with operations
against Cuba directed from Miami and other stations.
In the handling of these sporadic security and sup-
rort operations, day-to-day management of the LI-
TEMPO Project personnel was neglected by BENADUM
and LITEMPO-1,

Once the project got off on the wrong foot in
the way of effective management, it was difficult
to repair the damage. None of the original agents
had the slightest concept of positive intelligence
reporting. As a result, the project produced noth-

a cost of approximately This request
received Headquarters' approval in principle but
vas never implemented as a project because the
LITEMPO group, under BENADUM, had not convinced

getting people out of jail, putting people in jail,
and arranging meetings for bribes. They did not
have the discipline required for day-to-day manage-

phone tap information. Also, their concept of tele-
phone tap operations was to listen to the conversa-
t4on, jot down an address or name but make no tran-
scripts, Further, their targets were criminal cases
or political enemies rather than those of interest
to the station.

Although the original surveillance team mem-
ters were removed from the project, the cost con-

Vv. Clandestine Collection, Concept and Assessment

In examining the collection product, two

types of information must be distinguished, The

first, positive intelligence, was aclearly defined
item, collected for customer agencies, disseminated
according to their needs and interest, and was sub-
ject to evaluation, The usefulness and importance
of each report was manifest when the report was
weighed against other information on the same sub-
ject, considering the source's access and reporting
record.

Security intelligence, on the other hand, de-
fied precise definition. It was largely self-
generated in response to Agency internal require-
ments or in pursuit of obvious, but not necessarily
formalized, security objectives. It received limited
distribution to a few other agencies with security
responsibilities (if it was disseminated at all).

On receipt it was sometimes impossible to evaluate
with any degree of accuracy. In fact, its importance
did not become apparent for months or even years un-

til it was matched against other information received

from a different source, or until a sudden, specific

and often urgent need arose (inconnection with a
Presidential visit, for example). Security intel-
ligence included all information concerning the
identities, activities, contacts, and movements of
US and foreign subversive personalities, foreign
intelligence personnel, and other persons known or
suspected of being engaged in activities inimical
to the United States. It was used to improve US
security or to assist in the implementation of US

national policy.

The station produced a large volume of security

intelligence concerning: US citizens initiating or
maintaining contact with the Cuban and Soviet diplo-
matic installations; travel to Cuba by US citizens
and residents; activities of Cuban and Soviet intel-
ligence personnel; travel of Mexican and other Latin
American key subversive personalities; and methods
used to support subversive groups outside of Mexico.
In FY 1966, 82 formal disseminations of security
intelligence were made to the FBI, the I&NS, the
military services, and similar customers, More than
half of these related to the activities of US na-

tionals, The bulk of the security intelligence,

however, was retained by operational elements of
CIA for analysis and internal use, The Mexico
City Station referred daily toindexes based on this
material in tracing applicants for US visas, and in
support of its own and other stations’ operational
programs. The same indexes were also regularly
consulted in tracing applicants for US Civil Ser-
vice positions, employees of private industry whose
access to classified information required a US secu-
rity clearance, and Mexicans visiting the United
States as members of official delegations scheduled
to receive classified briefings, The station ser-
viced approximately 35,000 name traces annually

Mexico, Reporting on students’ domestic activities
was considered insufficient in relation to the im-
portance of the subject.

One-third of the reporting related to the
Communist Party, the National Liberation Movement
(MLN) and the Popular Socialist Party (PPS). Over
one-third concerned trips by Mexicans to the Soviet
Bloc or Cuba for international Communist activities,
and visits of Bloc and Cuban nationals to Mexico.
Many of the reports were too general in nature to
meet community requirements for detailed data.

All reporting was consonant with objectives
of the RMD, There were no significant areas of
marginal reporting where the CS should not be sup-

plying information.
An assessment prepared by FI/INT/RE of CS

reporting on Mexico for the period 1 February

through 31 July 1966 covered 359 reports dissemi-

nated from Mexico City and Monterrey during that

need for more and higher level CS reporting on the

the leftist influence in the Government. The volu-
minous reporting on low-level affairs of the PCM

cerned Cuban and Soviet activities in Mexico, and
the Mexican Government. The reporting relevant to
RMD Objective B-1, which concerned the CP and re-

duction reviewed. Low-level domestic activities
of the PCM, the PPS, and front groups were over-
reported. Lacking was more information on active
militant groups. .

were hailed as complete, timely, and very well
handled.

Another review of reporting against the Opera-
ting Directive Objectives was completed in early
1968. This covered 337 disseminations to cus~
tomer agencies during the period July through
December 1967. The study revealed that while there
was some excellent reporting from the Mexico City
Station, on an overall basis the same gaps, needs,
and overreporting characteristic of the 1966 review
continued in 1968, The station had the same low-
access agents and continued to disseminate their
reports even though customer agencies did not want
to receive this information.

To correct this situation, Headquarters
recommended that the station attempt to obtain
higher access agents among Communist groups. Also,
some of the political information was passed td
the Embassy Political Section for background and
situation reports, The elimination of this low-
level information cut sharply the overall volume
of formal dissemimtions from the station but it

resulted in a better quality product. To meet

VI. Relations with the US Embassy

During the period covered by this history
(April 1947 to June 1969), there were six US Am-
bassadors assigned to Mexico: Walter C. Thurston,
May 1946 to November 1950; William O'Dwyer, December
1950 to November 1952; Francis White, March 1953 to
April 1957; Robert C. Hill, May 1957 to November
1960; Thomas C. Mann, April 1961 to January 1964;
and Fulton Freeman, March 1964 to November 1968.

Relations between the first COS, William H.
Doyle, and Ambassador Thurston, a Foreign Service
Career officer, were cordial and friendly. To
Captain W. C. Ford and William G. Tharp, who in-
spected the Mexico City Station in February 1949,
Thurston volunteered that he had no problems what-
soever regarding CIA operations in his area. He
stated that he was completely satisfied with the
manner in which Doyle conducted his operations,
although he did not know what these operations con-
sisted of, but added that Doyle in his own quiet,
efficient manner appeared to be well informed and
to have good coverage concerning subversive activi-

ties in Mexico.

Doyle served in Mexico from April 1947 until

February 1951.

Relations between Doyle and O'Dwyer were
strained by circumstances surrounding the attempt
by Headquarters to set up an OPC station in Mexico
independent of the OSO station. O'Dwyer refused
to deal independently with two senior CIA officials
when neither could speak for all CIA activities in
Mexico. His insistence that one person represent

all these activities led to the designation in July

O'Dwyer also objected to the opening of the
CIA base and the FBI office in Monterrey. Ina
cable to O'Dwyer asked
2147
what three additional people there would do.
The only difficulties between CIA and Ambas-
sador White occurred after the arrival of Winston M.
Scott in 1956. This was over an increase of
slots in station personnel in the Embassy. White
was adamant in not wanting to increase the size of
the Embassy. He reluctantly agreed to the use of
documentation for these persons, provided
the Embassy would have no responsibility for them
and they would not admit that they were employed by
the Embassy.
Scott's relations with William Snow, Minister-
Counselor of Embassy, were excellent. In fact,
Snow was So impressed with Scott that he asked him
in September 1956 if he could persuade Headquarters
to send.a team of file experts to Mexico to survey
the Embassy records and made recommendations for a
complete reorganization of their filing system. As
a result of this request, Lorenzo B. Sanchez and

John M. Scott were sent to Mexico City from

Headquarters and conducted a review of the Embassy
files as a part of their reorganization of the sta-
tion files. .

There was a marked increase in services per-
formed by the station for al] Embassy components
after 1956. This included traces of names of visa
applicants, persons on the Ambassador's guest lists,
and employee applicants. Station photographic
facilities were made available to the Embassy.

The COS took an active part in the Ambassador's
staff meetings, and he briefed visiting US Con-
gressmen and newspapermen. Headquarters permitted
Ambassador Hill to detail Thomas J. Hazlett as the
Ambassador's secretary during Lopez Mateos inaugu-
ration ceremonies. The increased dependence on the
station for Embassy service led Headquarters in-
spectors in 1961 to suggest that the COS might need
command guidance on the extent of station services
for the Embassy to insure that CIA activities would
not be neglected.

Through Ambassador Hill, Scott met a wide
range of Mexican political figures. Hill promoted

Scott as his "expert on Communism," and was instru-

mental in placing Scott in contact with President
Lopez Mateos. Because of this friendly relation-
ship, Hill endorsed Scott's request for additional
personnel with nominal cover rather than
cover. He assigned to the station office space
twice the size assigned under previous ambassadors.

Ambassador Thomas C. Mann was briefed at
Headquarters on station operations and Scott's
clandestine contact with President Lopez Mateos.
Mann had grown up in Laredo, Texas, and was aware
of the sensitivity of the Mexican President to
close and open association with an American Ambas-
sador for fear that he might be subject to criti-
cism by opposition nationalist elements. Mann was
perfectly satisfied to use Scott as a channel to
the President of Nexico for certain sensitive
political matters. Mann also considered the joint
telephone tap project the best intelligence bpera-

‘216/

tion in Latin America.

Mann's successor, Ambassador Fulton Freeman,
did not share Mann's viewpoint and felt that he,
Freeman, should deal with the President of Mexico

on all matters. In November 1964, Mann (then

Assistant Secretary of State) ordered Freeman to
Washington and held a private conversation with
him regarding his relationship with the President
of Mexico, Raford W. Herbert, Deputy Chief, WH,
met with Freeman and Mann at this time, Freeman
agreed that the COS could continue to have his own
channel to the President-elect, Diaz Ordaz, pro-
vided that Freeman was kept thoroughly informed of
all that transpired between him and Diaz Ordaz.
CIA, as evidenced in the LISAGA Project, did not
keep the Ambassador fully informed on all discus-
sions with President Diaz Ordaz.

Freeman exhibited some distrust of CIA. For

instance, in November 1965 he advised the COS that

beginning 22 November he wanted to see all cable
traffic between Headquarters and the station to
see what was going on; cable traffic was made
available by the station but sensitive sources
were not identified in these communications.
Freeman made the same request of the local FBI
office. a

The station had access to consular files and

Political Section records. The visa and security

offices were cooperative in permitting use of
their offices by station officers for interviews

of "walk-in" cases or persons of operational inter—
est who called at the Embassy for pretext interviews.
One example of cooperation by the Embassy occurred
in 1962 when Roger Abraham, the Embassy administra-

tive counsellor, gave the station

In 1967 the Mexico City Station provided the
Embassy with file traces of 32,197 names. Memoranda
with derogatory information were written on 1,333 of
these names.

Relations with the Federal Bureau of Investigation

The FBI used the cover of legal attache, and
the size of its staff inside the Embassy compared
roughly with that of the station's integrated
personnel.

Relations between the station and the FBI
were generally cooperative. Every COS from 1947
until 1969 had been a former FBI agent. John N.

Speakes, Jr., was the senior FBI representative

in Mexico when Doyle opened the station. Speakes
remained in that position until his retirement in
1958. He was replaced by John Desmond, who served
in Mexico until 1963 when he retired and was re-
placed by Clark Anderson, who remained in Mexico
until he was transferred to Santo Domingo in April
1965. Nathan Ferris, who had served in the Wash-
ington FBI office as the senior representative for
the Westem Hemisphere, replaced Anderson and was
still in Mexico as of 1969.

Headquarters recognized that Mexico was in a
unique position as a consequence of its proximity
to the United States and its obvious utility as a
base for third-country operations directed against
the United States. In view of the fact that the
FBI was charged with responsibility for the internal
security of the United States, the necessity for
FBI activity could not be denied.

The Mexico FBI office received copies of all
disseminations from the station. It also received
counterespionage or security intelligence on all

non-US citizens of interest to that office. In-

” formation on US citizens, except those in contact

with the Cuban or Soviet Embassy, was passed at
Headquarters. Copies of legal attache reports
were passed in Mexico to the station.

From 1947 until 1959 legal attache officers
concerned themselves with criminal cases (fugitives
from justice, stolen cars, and fraud), espionage
investigations involving US citizens who fled to
Mexico, and US Communist Party leaders in temporary
exile in Mexico.

From 1960 on, the legal attache targets were
identical with those of the station, plus criminal
cases with which CIA was not concerned. This led
to some unavoidable duplicate reporting by the FBI
and CIA.

Liaison with the FBI in Mexico sometimes be-
came delicate because many persons of interest to
them were US citizens on whom CIA had acquired
information as a byproduct of technical operations
against. the Soviet Bloc and Cuban official instal-
lations. The station was prohibited from passing
this informatien locally to the FBI without first
sending it to Headquarters and receiving clearance
to pass it locally. By this time, the value of the

- 454 -

information had perished. For instance, US citizens
telephoned the Cuban Embassy to pick up visas to
travel to cuba. They usually gave their name
over the telephone. By the time the station re-
ceived permission from Headquarters to give these
names to the local FBI office, the visitors had
gone to Cuba. ifhen this was pointed out to Head-
quarters, an exception was made to existing regu-
lations, permitting the station to pass locally
information on Americans who contacted the Cuban
or Soviet Embassy.

The station began placing telephone taps for
the FBI in the 1950's. These were on the US CP
leaders and persons who were wanted in the United
States for questioning on espionage activities.
The targets were named by the FBI and consisted of
at least two simultaneous lines and sometimes as
many as four, Their chief clerk transcribed ‘the
reels and returned them with copies of the tran-
scripts. The station occasionally checked the
reels against the transcripts to make sure that
they were complete, The same group of FBI targets
were covered by the station mail intercept opera-

tion.

Between 1947 and 1969 there were a number of
FBI double agents who met with their Soviet case of-
ficers in Mexico. The station provided support to
these operations in the form of surveillance and
photographic coverage of the agent meetings and the
agent activities while in Mexico.

The FBI did not always protect CIA sources.
An example of this was the handling of a CIA clan-
destine photograph in the Oswald case when the FBI
told Oswald's mother that the photograph was made
by CIA in front of the Soviet Embassy in Mexico
City.

As of 1969, the FBI maintained a staff of
three officers in the consulate general in Monterrey,
one officer in the consulate general in Guadalajara,

and one officer in the consulate in Mazatlan.

Relations with the Department of Defense

Relations with the military officers were
formal but not particularly close when the Mexico
City Station was opened. The military attache com-
plained that, when Doyle assumed charge of activi-
ties formerly handled by the FBI, the military

officers were cut off from the distribution of

reports which they had previously received. Doyle
had provided them information in response tc specific
requests, but the military office wanted to receive
copies of all local CIA disseminations. From Septem-
ber 1947, a11 local disseminations were sent to the
military and naval attaches.

In 1956 Lt. Colonel Oscar M. Doerflinger was
assigned to the military attache office in Mexico
City in response to a specific request from CIA,
Doerflinger had served at Headquarters as the branch
chicf for Mexico just prior to his assignment to
Mexico. During his tour in Mexico City, cooperation
with the station was excellent

At the station's request in 1956, the air
attache flew at low altitude over the Soviet Bloc
official installation and made aerial photographs
with a 70-millimeter aerial camera. The photo-
graphs were so clear and sharp that they showed a
powerful radio antenna concealed in a well of the
roof of the Soviet Embassy. The air and naval
attaches also made their aircraft available to CIA
on special flights for cargo from the United States.

On these occasions, CIA paid the operating costs.

In an economy move in 1967 the US Government with-
drew the aircraft which had formerly been assigned
to the Ambassador.

Military officers worked closely with the sta-
tion in the investigation of servicemen who were in
Mexico without leave from their bases. Periodically,
these persons were in contact with the Soviet Bloc
and Cuban official installations attempting to
travel to Cuba or the Soviet Union. In several
instances, information provided by the station
assisted in locating the men and returning them to
their US military bases.

The LIOYSTER operation was an example of sta-
tion cooperation with the military officers and
the FBI when an enlisted man in the US Army came
to Mexico, under military guidance, and met with
his Soviet intelligence case officer.

Military and naval attaches were members of
the attache association and provided the station
with personality information on the Soviet Bloc
attache. In one instance, based on derogatory in-
formation from a CIA technical operation, the US
military attache made a recruitment approach to
the Soviet attache which was turned down.

Operational Directives

From April 1947 until 1 March 1948 general
operational priorities were outlined in National
Security Council Intelligence Directive Number 5
(NSCID/5). Grouped in order of importance, these
priorities were: espionage and counterespionage
operations against the Soviet Union; Soviet activi-
ties outside the USSR; scientific research and
technical developments relating to atomic, biologi-
cal and chemical warfare, guided missiles, and
electronics; and collection of information on
political, economic, and military developments
likely to affect the security of the United States.
Correspondence between Headquarters and

Mexico City Station indicates that Special Opera-
tional Instruction No. 23 (SOI/23) dated 1. March
1948, established the following more specific
targets:

a. Communist Party of Mexico.

b. Activities of the leading Marxist

ec. Soviet and Soviet Satellite

d. Spanish Communist Party.
e. Political and financial plans
of
This directive was valid for three months.
Progress of the Mexico City Station in covering
these targets was reported monthly to Headquarters.
In July 1948 SOI/23 was extended for six months and
reporting requirements were changed to quarterly
intervals, Headquarters continued extensions until
the SOI was replaced by the first RMD dated 27 July
1954 which defined the CIA mission in Mexico. The
chief of station was assigned responsibility for:
a. All US Government foreign intel-
Ligence (FI) operations in Mexico, except
for agreed intelligence activities con-
ducted by other US Government agencies.

b. All US Government political and

with the International Organizations
(10) Division on pertinent international
programs and with the United States In-
formation Agency (USIA) concerning gray
propaganda.

c. Any paramilitary (PM) operations
that might be necessary for Mexico.
This directive outlined the station's position

on relations with other US Government and foreign -

ad

agencies. Relations with the State Department were
to be in accordance with the provisions of State
Department-Office of Special Operations (STOSO)
agreement. Coordination with the FBI, I&NS, Depart-
ment of Defense (DOD), and USIA was authorized by
Headquarters in cases of mutual interest. No formal
liaison was authorized with foreign intelligence

services, but the station was permitted to continue

British intelligence representative.

The basic FI mission in Mexico was to promote

and use of clandestine FI assets to collect informa
tion on the intentions, capabilities and courses of
action of Mexico, the Soviet Bloc, and of other
countries likely to affect the security of the
United States.

The basic PP mission in Mexico was to promote
the security of the United States by covert opera-
tions, planned in such a way that the US Government's
role would not be evident but if uncovered could
plausibly be denied. The purpose of these opera-
tions were to:

a. Contribute to the worldwide
objective of reducing the political and
economic power and potential of the Soviet
Bloc and its capability to wage hot war.

b. Discredit the ideology of inter-
national Communism and exploit its prob-
lems.

c. Combat the activities of Communist-
oriented parties and other radical groups
in Mexico.

d. Combat the activities of elements

hostile to the United States.

L. Counteract and negate overt and
covert Communist activities and promote
pro-US sentiment in intellectual and
cultural circles in Mexico and when
feasible throughout Latin America.

(One of the PP tasks listed with this
objective was to "obtain and widely
publicize the confession of the murder-
er of Leon Trotsky, thus exposing the
terroristic and brutal nature of Commu-
nism and Communist rule.")

PRIORITY IV

M. Readiness for general war situa-
tion.

The next year the same RMD was approved with
objective "K" deleted because the 1956 Operational
Program for Mexico contained no provision to cover
it. It also provided for an area-wide anti-Communist
front organization with chapters in all Latin Ameri-
can countries and yearly congresses to coordinate
anti-Communist activities.

In 1956 the RMD had only 10 objectives. ("K"
and "M" were deleted and "J" was included with the
Soviet Bloc requirement). The need for CE and CI
operations against Soviet officials and the Soviet
intelligence services was emphasized, Soviet Satel-
lites and their services dropped to "Priority II."

This directive also called on the station to identify

and report on the activities of US Communists in
contact with Soviet officials in Mexico.

The 1957 RMD represented a complete change in
format but very little change in content or opera-
tional emphasis. The long-range purposes of US
policy remained that of counteracting international
Communism and encouraging democratic governments
friendly to the United States.

In 1958 one additional task was added. This
was recruitment of third country national diplomats
who might be assigned to Soviet Bloc countries.

About the oniy change in the 1959 RMD was the
recognition of the Chinese Communists as a Priority
III objective. This was a worldwide activity and
not of special significance to Mexico since there
were no Communist Chinese officials in the country.
Another objective included in this RMD was the plot-
ting of Latin American revolutionary exile groups.

An effort was made in 1960 to revise the RMD
to more accurately reflect operational conditions
and capabilities. Coverage of Cuban revolutionary
groups in Mexico was made a specific requirement

under Priority I because of the threat presented

by Communist Cuba to US interests in Latin America.
Covert action operations were authorized against

the Cuban targets in Mexico. The same instruction
remained in effect until October 1963 when the opera-
tional priorities were reduced to three major targets:
the Cubans, the Soviets, and

These remained the primary reporting targets in 1964,
1965, and 1966 though the Mexico City Station pressed
for higher priorities for the CP of Mexico and Soviet
Satellite activities.

In 1967 the RMD's were replaced by Operating
Directives which were included as a part of the
operational programs.

The Operating Directive dated January 1967 re-
peated the unchanged long-range United States policy
toward Mexico. Operational targets in order of
priority were:

A. ‘Cuba
B. Soviet Union

Cc. Communist Party of Mexico

D.

E. Soviet Satellites

F. Latin American Exiles

In 1968 the Operating Directive format was
changed back to the Priority I and II categories
used from 1956 through 1966. This directive was
effective through FY 1969, the cutoff date for this
paper. In general terms, the Priority I targets
were:

Soviet Union

A.
B. Cuba
¢. ——
D. Communist Party in Mexico

The Priority II targets were travelers to the
Soviet Bloc, Satellite intelligence services, and
anti-US extremists.

Generally, the Soviet Embassy in Mexico was
the main target of the station. From 1947 to 1954,
SOI/23 gave higher priority to the CP and the Popular
Socialist Party coverage but by 1954 when the first
RMD was written, it was recognized that the Soviet
Embassy was the number one target. During the
period 1960 through 1967, Cuba was placed ahead of
the Soviets as an operational target because of the
threat posed in the Western Hemisphere by exporta-
tion of Castro-type revolutionary and guerrilla

activities, In 1968 the Soviets again became the

assassination of "Che" Guevara, the Latin American

revolutionary, and it appeared that the Soviets

were pressuring Castro to discontinue these opera-
tions, The and CP activities

were of continuing interest but of a lower priority.
Soviet Satellite intelligence services were of lesser
interest. They, like the Latin American exiles and
targets of opportunity, followed behind the Soviets,
Cuba, and the CP of Mexico.

The Soviets used Mexico as an important base
fer their operations against the United States, and
two-thirds of their officials in Mexico were experi-
enced intelligence officers. They also enjoyed a
permissive attitude as far as the Mexican Security
Service was concerned. For these reasons, the
Soviet Embassy was the primary target of the station

during most of the first 22 years of its history.
