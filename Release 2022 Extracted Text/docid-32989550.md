U. S. SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE TO
STUDY GOVERNMENTAL OPERATIONS WITH
RESPECT TO INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC)

Reference is made to SSC requests contained in letter
of Senator Frank Church dated November 7, 1975, for materiais
concerning Martin Luther King, Jr.

The purpose of this memorandum is to effect delivery
to the SSC of information and materials in response to requests
contained in the above SSC letter,

The attention of the SSC is invited to YBI memorandum
dated November 11, 1975, which referred to a highly sensitive
eral briefing furnished to Senator Church and selected members
of the SSC Staff by FBI personnel on November 5, 1975. This
briefing was intended, in part, te serve in lieu of any
written information in response to SSC requests for comnuni-
cations documenting Stanley David Levison as a secret member
of the Communist Party, USA (CPUSA).

Because of SSC. insistence in requesting items to
establish factual basis for Levison's secret CPUSA membership,
as set forth in referenced SSC letter, our New York office
was contacted for documents representing orlginal recordings
from Bureau informants concerning Levison. As a resuit our
New York office provided the material which is now being
delivered and which has served as a basis for statements in
bipe aiteg documents that Levison was a secret member of

SENATE SELECT COMMITTER ON INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES

Et is noted that referenced SSC letter requested un-
axcised copies of the lebruary 22, and June 12, 1962, communi-
cations from New Yorks which appear to have been the “articulated
predicates for the ‘cominfil' case.'' The SSC letter did not
identify captions of these communications; nor identify any
specific “cominfil case." Therefore, we were unable to locate
any pertinent documents bearing these dates in our Headquarters:
files. At a meeting on November 12, 1975, between SSC Staff
Member Michael Epstein and representatives of the Intelligence
Division of the FBI, it was agreed that. the two documents
apparently referred to above are New York airtel dated February 12,

62, captioned "Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.; SM*C" and New York
letter dated August 21, 1962, captioned “Communist Infiltration
of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference; iS-c."

New York airtel dated February 12, 1962, is being
delivered with this memorandum among those documents received
from our New York office. Excisions in this document are
fewer than those made in a capy previously provided the SSC. A
copy bearing no or fewer excisions cannot be provided the SSC
for reasons made clear during the oral briefing of Senator
Church and selected SSC Staff members on November 5, 1975.

It is noted that New York letter dated August 21, 1962,
which is being delivered with this memorandum, is not believed
to have been previously provided the SSC.

Dear Mr. Shaheen:

I want you to know how much I appreciated the’
opportunity to meet with you and your associates the other
day about the Martin Luther King, Jr. case. It was most
helpful to have the benefit of the Bureau's knowledge con-~
cerning the background of the case, and I can assure you
that we will do everything possible to avoid joepardizing
any sensitive FBI sources or ongoing operations.

I do want to reiterate our need for the specific
items set forth in earlier document requests which would
presumably establish the factual basis for your conclusion
as of various dates in 1962, 1963 and'1964 that Stanley . :
Levison was a "secret member of the Communist Party, usA."

Of course in the event that there is no particular document

. in any of those years wherein Levison was so-identified to

the FBI, L think it would be helpful for you to let us know
so that we may consider our outstanding requests in that
context. Finally £ course, we still need mexcised copies -
‘of the Febriia @° June 12, 62. communi
New York which appear to have been the articulated pre
for the "cominfil” case. -! i

at to thank you for your time and

Once again, I w.

I look forward to hearing

SUBJECT: STANLEY LEVISON on__JO/A7 {4.0

IS-C o
SEQE ITIVE fahdiy ue ENTELUGENCE or
fon 4/9/64, fry "654-g% made the following observations

with regard to tha) CP svatus of STANLEY LEVISON:

LEVISON has been an important Party member for
many years (and never at any time differed with the Party with
respect to the Party line. His only difference with the
Party has been with respect to the fact that in his opinion
the Party was not sufficiently "militant" in defending
Negro rights. In this respect, he has been to the "left"
of the Party, LEVISON's differences with the Party are merely
"tactical." He has never criticized the Party, except with
respect to the Party's handling of the Negro question. ‘The
fact that he does not accept domination by the Party with
regard to the MARTIN LUTHER KING movement should not be
construed to mean that he has broken with the Party in all
respects. ‘The Party today is as anxious to reestablish friendly
relations with LEVISON as it was in the past,

It should be noted that LEVISON never has been
officially "drummed out" of the Party, nor has anyone ever
-eviticized him for being opposed to the Party's general
principles. It further should be noted that according to
‘the CP Constitution, it would require formal expulsion of

QLEVISON to state that he is officially out of the Party.

LEVISON never has said anything reflecting that
he does not continue to be a CP member. It.should be noted
shat it would be in the interests of the MARTIN LUTHER KING
movement, with which he is associated, if he would publicly
wrepudiate>the Party, which he has never done. It should be
Surther noted that in an effort to renew friendly relations

with LEVISON, the Party designated BEN DAVIS to contact

LEVISON. LEVISON had always expressed the opinion that

BEN DAVIS was the only CP functionary who had a sufficiently

"militant attitude" as regards CP activities in behalf of

the Negro movement. ‘The fact that DAVIS and LEVISON as yet

have not met should not be construed to mean that LEVISON

has refused to confer with DAVIS. As NY 6944S5* understands

the situation, DAVIS has been awaiting contact by LEVISON,

and LEVISON similarly has been awaiting contact by DAVIS.

Each of these individuals is sufficiently egotistical to

expect that the other would make the first move in an effort

to establish contact, NY 694-S* believes that probably the

reason why DAVIS and LEVISON have not met is that arrangements

for their meeting were to be made by LEM HARRIS and that

HARRIS has not made the proper efforts to effect a meeting
sp petween LEVISON and DAVIS.

NY 694-S* has never obtained any information re-
flecting that LEVISON has changed his thinking with regard to
Marxism, Even though his present estrangement from the Party
might be construed as reflecting he is no longer a CP member,
there is no reason to come to the conclusion that LEVISON is
no longer an ideological Communist.

JACK talked to LEM HARRIS yesterday who said he
contacted STAN LEVENSON by phone and was given a cordial
-hello which was a change from the past when he was cool.

LEM said he had not seen LEVENSON, tried to call him
and would like to see him immediately to which LEVENSON said,
"TY would like very much to see you but I don't have the time
now. I'm leaving and packing for a trip. I will be glad to
see you in six weeks,"

LEVENSON impliec. that he was going to Ecuador but
LEM doesn't know why. @ was no anger shown, and LEVENSON
will see LEM when he retu:ns in six weeks,

(00 6/13/63, N¥ 694~S* furnished the following
informati6n to SA ALEXANDER C, BURLINSON:

On 6/12/63, LEMENT HaRRIS,CPUSA Reserve Fund
functionary, told NY 694-S* that in a recent meeting with
STANLEY LEVISON, the latter furnished him the following
information:

The LEVISONS, particularly STANLEY, are still
MARTIN LUTHER KING's "brain trust"--now more than ever before.
This is so despite the fact that at a meeting of STANLEY
LEVISON, ROY LEVISON, HUNTER PITTS O'DELL, MARTIN LUTHER
KING and "the Attorney General's chief assistant", the
Attorney General's assistant, pointing to the LEVISONS
and HUNTER PITTS O'DELL, stated to MARTIN LUTHER KING,
"These men are Party members; watch out for them."

MARTIN LUTHER KING did not "bat an eyelash" upon
hearing the Assistant Attorney General's remark, and after
the latter left the meeting, those in the group smiled at each
other. STANLEY LEVISON said to KING, at this:time, "I
congratulate you on the way you acted regarding his warning.
You are a real Marxist~Leninist. This is how a true
Marxist~Leninist acts."

Everything that KING does he first discusses
with STANLEY LEVISON and he accepts LEVISON's advice whole-
heartedly. KING also wholeheartedly accepts the advice of
HUNTER PITTS O'DELL as regards matters within the latter's
local jurisdiction,

T

7am i MARTIN LUTHER KING was asked by a group of newspaper
renorters whether he takes orders from "the Communists”
and also, whether he took “orders from STANIEY LEVISON, és
KING's response was that he took orders only from God.

By reason of the fact that the LEVISONS feel that
the Party has done little, if anything, to assist the fight

NIWW"65360~Docitd:32989550—Prage



NY 100-136585

for civil rights for Negroes, and further, since they feel
that the Party, as a result of this "do nothing" attitude,
has lost prestige, they will no longer permit the Party
spl? to dominate or control their activities in the MARTIN LUTHER
KING movement. They are severing themselves, financially
and in a disciplinary way, from the Party. The LEVISONS \
(ana O'DELL\ are still Party members,(but do'not desire to be
openly "linked up" with the Party. “Although they are "dis-
enchanted! with, the Party, they are not quitting the Party.
With respect to the MARTIN LUTHER KING movement, they will
act on their o initiative, and will not accept instructions
from the Party.

(Gan HARRIS then advised that the Party, however,
still would like to control the MARTIN LUTHER KING movement.
BEN DAVIS has been assigned to be "liaison or intermediary"
with the LEVISONS and HUNTER PITTS O'DELL. Whether or not
the LEVISONS and O'DELL will maintain liaison regarding
matters concerning the MARTIN LUTHER KING movement is a
matter for them to decide. In view of LEVISON's statement ~~
with respect to advising MARTIN LUTHER KING independently
of Party instructions, it would seem that DAVIS may not have
any success in maintaining liaison with the LEVISONS and
HUNTER PITTS O'DELL. The LEVISONS and O'DELL are aware of

F 1 the fact that BEN DAVIS has been given this assignment
§ 7 by the Party.

MARTIN LUTHER KING, according to LEM HARRIS, is
referred to by such top Party functionaries as GUS HALL,
BEN DAVIS, JIM JACKSON and “LAUDE LIGHTFOOT as a "true,
genuine, Marxist-Leninist from the top of his head to the tips
of his toes," In the Party, the report is that MARTIN LUTHER
KING is following a Marxist-Leninist line.

NY 694.S* advised that he asked LEM HARRIS whether
or not, to the latter's knowledge, MARTIN LUTHER KING was
a member of the CPUSA, LEM HARRIS replied that he did not
know. 7

When Dr. MARTIN LUTHER KING was invited to address
the AFL-CIO convention some time ago, KING, on LEVISON's ad-
vice, first obtained approval to do so from A, PHILLIP RANDOLPH,
negro labor leader, who, if he had not been consulted in the
matter, might have felt that KING's making a speech at the
aforesaid convention was a blow to RANDOLPH's prestige.

KING delivered a remarkably effective speech at the
AFL-CIO convention, and, asa result, received invitations
from numerous labor leaders, including "MC DONALD of Steel,"
to address their respective unions. As the outstanding
champion of negro rights in the country, KING is a powerful
political influence, recognized as such by the higher echelons
‘of the Democratic Party. He has access to Attorney General
ROBERT KENNEDY and President KENNEDY, who, politically, need
KING, particularly in the South, where in cities like Atlanta
and New Orleans the negro vote now constitutes the balance of
power, and where KING controls the negro vote,

: JAMES EOFFA, Teamsters Union "boss" appreciates
the political power of KING, particularly the fact that KING
can influence the 90,000 negro members of the Teamsters
Union. HOFFA invited KING to address the Teamsters Union,
and KING accepted the invitation. Knowing that KING is being
deferred to by Attorney General KENNEDY, and President; KENNEDY,
HOFFA requested KING to contact the Attorney General in an
effort to influence the latter "to lay off" HOFFA, KING was
inclined to do as HOFFA requested, but LEVISON convinced him
that to do so would be politically unwise, inexpedient, and
likely to be a "boomerang," since the Attorney General would
os een accede to such a request, particularly in the case of
OFFA, i

ve LEVISON had to steer KING away from another politi-
cally hazardous situation. Some months ago OTTO PREMINGER,
Hollywood movie director, entered into negotiations with a
KING representative for KING to play a part in 4 picture
which PREMINGER woulddirect, Although PREMINGER's offer was
"tempting," since it meant "fast, easy money" for KING's
organization, LEVISON realized that for KING to accept the
offer bey eer the latters prestige. After convincing
KING o: is fact, LEVISON personally, telephoned to o GER,
telling him that ‘the deal was off.) slicecenetied

“Qe

NW 65360 Docld:32989550 Page 18


NY 100-136585 7

What LEVISON particularly wanted GUS HALL to knew
is that “KING is a wholehearted Marxist, who has studied
it (Marxism), believes in it, and agrees with it, but because
of his being a minister of 1eligion, does not dare to espouse
it publicly."

GUS HALL, according to HARRIS, was "elated" to
veceive LEVISON's report on LUTHER KING.

that of a person interested in contributing money to the
KING committee. The person answering the phone during
the conversation identified himself as JACK O'DELL, and
furnished the following informatim:

His office is the Northern Branch of the SCLC.

The Committee to Defend MARTIN LUTHER KING, at 312 West
125th Street, was organized as an "ad hoc" committee to
“assist in the KING defense, when he was the subject of
court action, When the reason for this committee's

being in existence was removed, it was formakly dissolved.
The same personalities them formed the Committee to Aid
the Southern Freedom Struggle, which is now operated at
312 West 125th Street.

O'DELL stated that it would make no difference
as to whether a person contributing money makes out checks
payable to the Committee to Defend MARTIN LUTHER KING, the
SCLC or the Committee to Aid the Southern Freedom Struggle,
because they are all one and the same. 7 .

“Dear Mike:

As.a follow-up to our briefing of Assistant Director
Wannall on November 6 concerning our proposed format and
witnesses for public hearings on December 4-5 on the FBI's
use of intelligence informants ‘and sources, we would like
to make the following requests.

“As discussed ‘in our ‘meeting with Mr. Wannall, we in-
. vite the Bureau to submit a memorandum on its intelligence |
informant and source program that could be inserted in
the record of the testimony of Bureau representatives at
the hearing. This memorandum would enable the Bureau to
. present to the Select Committee a complete description
“ofits program and to discuss the issues of particular
“interest to the Committee members. These include, for
example, 1) the size, scope and purpose of the program,
including an assessment of the program's cost and effective-
‘ness, and the distinctions and relationships between the
“intelligence informant program and the Bureau's criminal
informant activity; 2) the criteria that determine when
an informant may be used in an organization or group; and
..'3) the program's command and control system, including the
: limits that are placed on the activities of informants
_ and the type of information an informant or source is per-
mitted to report to his handling agent and the Bureau.
In_ addition, the memorandum would discuss. possible leg-
islation in the informant area, such as the imposition
of a warrant requirement or additional administrative re-
view. To permit the Select Committee members to study this
memorandum in advance of the hearing and to discuss it

with FBI representatives during their testimony at the a

lic hearing, we request that the memorandum be submi

| :

As you ara aware, a computerized ADBX listing is pre-
parad ‘monthly at PRIHO. he SI List was prepared in the same
manner and, as with the former SI, when a new monthly ADEX List
‘is prepared copies of the old list are destroyed inasmuch as they
are outdated and no longer serve a useful purrose. As you have ‘
heen previously advised, names appearing on the former ST and
the ADEX have been printed on 5 % 8 cards with a single name
printed on each card. Background information, file numbers, and
type of activity in which the individual is engaged are also
placed‘on these cards. As you are.adware, approximately 15,000 of
these cards, all outdated, Rave been lovated ag FBIHQ. These

‘ ecards include some which contain the identity of individuals who ©
were maintained oa the Priority ITI level of the former SI and
all ADEA cards deleted or cancelled since its inception.

During the initial peried of establishing the ADEX, in
orger te obviate the need for conducting massive file reviews,
the ADEX consisted primarily of the identity of those individuals
who had been maintained on the former SI. Samant these naaes
were originally placed in thie.manner on th ADEX, ag cases
were reyiewed.under our then existiag Scone procedures, each
cass was to be reviewed on its-owm merits utilizing the then
current criteria’ for ADEX te determine whether conti: in-
clusion on the ADEX was warranted. If aot, the individual's

name was deleted. As previously indicated, during 1972 the aDEx
was evaluated and revised. Following this revision, the nunber
of individuals who were included on the ADEX began to decline
and thus the high numbar of cancelled cards. In accordance with
Bureau policy, which was instituted during the SI program, these
cancelled cards are maintained at FPBINQ for a period of three
years and there is no way to reconstuct a formor SI or ADEX list
for a particular time period by roviewing these cancelled cards.
These cards, however, will roflect the identity of those in~ |
dividuals whe have beon placed on the SI and the ADEX for the
peried for which these cards were maintained.

Per your request, these outdated SI and ADEX cards |
are availabie for review by appropriate SSC representives
at PBIHQ. In this reqard, SSC Staff Members Martha Talley and
John @. DILiZE have had access to these cards on Octoker 30,
1975, and Novembor 7, 1975, respectively.

During Mr. ELLif£'s review of these cards, the names
Sheliey Blum, Emanuel James Brisker, Jr., and Gregory Allan
Calvort were selected by Mr. ELLI££ in connection with request
number two of your October 28, 1975, letter. Documents re-
quested rogarding these individuals are enclosed.

A review of pertinent files at FBIMQ regarding the SI
and the RE indicates there are no other versions of the former
SI or RI at FRIHO. Contact was also made with knowledgeable
individuals of our New York City Field Office and it was deter-
mined these programs had boon handled in accordance with thon
existing FBIHQ policy and no other versionsof these programs
wore compiled by that office,

Materials requested for delivery under item number
four of your Octobor 28, 1975, letter are enclosed. In this re-
gard, it is noted the correct FBINQ file number for tho Emma
Lazarus Federation of Jewish Women's Clubs is 100-400394 and
the correat file number for the file regarding Communist Infil-
tration of the National Association for the Advancement of
Colored People is 61-3176. In order to be responsive to your
request, pertinent doouments of the typo desired aro being fur~
nished regarding these organizations from these files.

LEGAL, ATTACHES

Department of State advised that the primary objective of
the visitors was to discuss with the Ambassador and
members of his staf£ the relationships and exercise of
authority by the Ambassador of the intelligence activities
in the field. The Department of State further advised that
operational details, sources and methods were not construed
to be logitimate avenues of inquiry by the SSC Staff
Members.

Legat, Brasilia, was interviewed on September 22,
1975, by Messrs, Aaron and Truchart, with Aaron being
dominant in the interviewing process. The interview was
directed mainly toward attempts to elicit examples whereby

Specific questions were p.
if the FBI was involved in Soviet Embassy PEK Act
recruitment of double agents and
Discussion coneerning Legat's role
Brasilia appeared to be routine, with few,
if any, pointed questions directed at FBI operations
overseas, The subject of two paid confidential sources in
Brasilia was briefly discussed and both SSC investigators
appeared understanding and in agreement with the necessity
of each confidential source to serve FBI's and U. Ss.
Government's best interests in Brazil, The question
seemingly bearing the most weight during the interview
concerned possible unauthorized activities of CIA and its
lack of cooperation and coordination with FBI and the
Defense Attache's Office. The duration of the intervicw
was approximately forty-five minutes.

Legat, Buenos Aires, was interviewed by the two
SSc Staff Members on September 26, 1975. Again Aaron
played the dominant role during interview. He commenced

Memorandum advises concerning proposed SSC
hearing on FBI foreign counterintelligence (CI) matters;

On 10/30/75 Mr, John Elliff, SSC Staff Member,
met with Assistant Director W, R, Wannall, Intelligence
Division (INTD), Also present were Section Chiefs W. A,
Branigan (CI-1) and W. 0. Cregar (CI-2) and Acting Section
Chief F, J, Cassidy (IS-3) and Unit Chief E. W, Larson,
Training Unit (IS-3). Mr. Elliff advised that the Committee
proposed to have an executive session tentatively scheduled
for the morning of Friday, 11/14/75, wihichdwouldndeal with
foreign CI operations. In addition to representatives from
the FBI they envisioned also having present representatives
from CIA and the United States military intelligence services,
He stated that the session would be scheduled for approximately
2 and one-half hours,

During the conference the following three themes
were outlined by Mr. Elliff as the probable areas of
discussion:

1, Changes in CI operations during recent years

Items discussed as probably worthy of attention
were physical surveillances, the walk-in operations,
defection (recruitment—in-place), CI training programs,
Also suggested as a prime topic was the future projections
concerning administration of foreign CI operations in oD ioe the, os

Re: U. 8, Senate Select Committee
on Intelligence Activities (SSC)

2, Counter-subversion

In this category Mr, E1liff indicated a particular
interest in foreign influence in domestic groups and the
assessment of danger/risk in investigations undertaken to
detect such influence, He brought up the disclosures of
surveillances by CIA of Americans abroad at the request of
the FBI, He also indicated an interest in borderline cases,
such as those in which domestic counter-subversion
investigations develop a CI aspect, and was particularly i
interested in the policies and coordinating mechanisms
affecting such instances,

3, Positive intelligence collection

In this category Mr, Elliff was interested in
the responsibility for collection of positive intelligence
within the United States and the apparent gap which existed
in this field, He was also interested in situations under
which the FBI might target friendly foreign intelligence
services in the United States for CI attention,

Considerable discussion was held during the
conference during which INTD representatives set forth the
FBI's position and experience in the many areas noted,
They are being set forth here to illustrate the probable
scope and nature of the executive session which is being
planned, Further discussions will be held with the SSC
staff to clarify these matters and a firmer agenda for the
proposed 11/14/75 hearing will be developed,

With respect to the proposed plan. to include
representatives of CIA and the military intelligence services
along with the FBI in the proposed session of 2 and one
half hours, it was pointed out to Mr, E1liff that this would
not appear to be a very productive procedure, The CI
perspectives and responsibilities of CIA and the military
services are much more narrow and generally in a completely
different context than the CI perspectives and responsibilities
of the FBI, These differences, particularly in the short

time allotted, appear to represent a disadvantage to all
parties concerned, including the Committee, It was pointed
out that the FBI, in particular, would have considerable
difficulty in presenting a comprehensive and valid picture
of its own CI operations under the conditions imposed by
such a sesSion, Mr, Elliff, after considering these
objections, stated that he could understand the FBI
position but was somewhat doubtful considering the pressures
under which the Committee was operating that he would be

In addition to the review of all files pertinent to
this inquiry, WFO should review the newspaper morgues of daily
newspapers published in Washington, D. C., at such time for
articles concerning the burglary and which may shed some
additional ight on this mettsr.

This matter must be given expeditious attention
and results submitted by airtel to reach Bureau by
¢.0.b. 1/30/76.

NOTE:

Bureau memorandum dated July 23, 1973, referred
to in enclosure and to which Kraft raised a question
sets forth the information that Kraft advised WFO on
9/4/69 of the burglary of his residence 9/3/69. Kraft
now has no recollection of having spoken to the FBI
about the burglary. Pertinent FBIHQ main case files
on Kraft (62-115682, 65-75629, 87-107157 and 105-68548)
were reviewed by Supervisor T. E. Burns in connection
with this inquiry. Such review failed to develop
required information. Review by WFO as directed within
should develop appropriate information necessary to
resolve this matter.

"On the morning of September 4, 1969,
the Metropolitan Police Department was advised
by the Washington National Airport Police that
some silverware had been found near one of the
entrances to the terminal at the Washington
National Airport. The silverware was recovered
by the Metropolitan Police Department and
processed for latent fingerprints without
success and the items were returned to Mrs,
Kraft upon her identification of the silverware.
No suspects were developed by either the FBI
or the Metropolitan Police Department in the
investigation of the matter."

Mr. Kraft does not recall having spoken to the FBI about the
purglary. Documents provided more recently to Mr. Kraft pursuant
to the August 5, 1975, agreement do not shed any light on this
question.

The incident is curious in that the only reference to it comes
in the memorandum of July 18, 1973, discussing a press report about
the activities of John D. Erlichman. Could you have someone look
into this matter for me? The obvious questions are: What other
documents in FBI files say about the September 3, 1969, burglary?
What files of the Bureau or its Washington field office indicate
about how the conversation about the burglary took place?

As the Bureau is aware, I am gravely concerned ove
the potential for serious violence occurring in Chicago during
the period of the Democratic Convention, which commences
August 26, 1968 and the days immediately preceding this
convention, Had the convention occurred within 30 days after
the President made his announcement that he was not going to
run for reelection and after the Viet Nam peace talks started
in Paris, I feel that we might not have had serious violence
as these two occurrences took much of the Paeaaad out of many of
the organizations comprising the “Nt

2 ‘New Left Their direction
at that tine was primerily against Pr -esident JOHNSON and
against Viet Nam and much of the steam went out of their
programs following these two announcements, ope

It is our observation, however, that these "New Left"
organizations have now had time to redirect their programs
and are now concentrating primarily on demonstrations and
activities against Vice President HUMPHREY, characterized
by them as the "Dump Humphrey Campaign". The fact that the
lwar still continues in Viet Nam, has again given emphasis
to the organizations which exist on the basic theme of anti-
, Viet Nam, I am thinking. particularly of such organizations

On August 12, 1968, USA THOMAS A.FORAN contacted
SAC, Chicago, advising that WARREN CHRISTOPHER, Deputy U.S.
Attorney General, desired to meet with the SAC, Chicago.

DATE: 8/03./68

As a result of the above request, SAC, Chicago,
and Supervisor RICHARD L. STRAIN met briefly with Mr. WARREN
CHRISTOPHFR and Mr. WES POMEROY of the U.S, Department of i
Justice, Washington, D.C., in the presence of USA FOREN in
his offices.

Mr. CHRISTOPHER was most congenial and expressed
his high regard fox the FBI and asked for a current evaluation
of activities in the Chicago area which could possibly affect +
the Democratic National Convention (DNC) being held the last”
week of August, 1968. Mr. CHRISTOPHER was advised that all

At gne point in the discussion mentzon was made of the

holding talks|with the city administration in an effort to obtain
necessary park permits to have their followers live and sleep in 3
one of the Chicago area.parks during the week of the convention and
hold a "happening" which the Yippies referred to as the "Festival
of Life." During this discussion USA FORAN confidentially advised
that when he had received the FBI's notification of the anticipated
plans on the part of the Yippies, he had contacted certain city
officials known to him and attempted to persuade them against the
issuance of such a permit in view of the known moral conduct of
such groups. USA FORAN advised he had been assured that such
permits would not be granted. He stated these ‘permits have as yet
not been granted and that his sources have indicated no serious

For the Bureau's information, Sgt. JOSEPH GRUBISIC,
Intelligence Section, Chicago PD, advised previously that he
had learned from DAVID STAHL of the Mayor's Office, Chicago,
that they had received a telephone call, a couple of days ago,
from one WES POMEROY of the U.S. Attorney General's Office,
to the effect that the Attorney General wanted the Chicago
city officials to give every consideration to the granting
of the permits requested by the Yippies.

Sgt. GRUBISIC was unable to comment on the feeling

* of the city administration to this request but was of the

opinion that such permits would not be granted as requested.
Sgt. GRUBISIC based his opinion on the fact that four repre-
sentatives of the Yippies, from New York City, had gone to

the office of the Deputy Superintendent of the Chicago PD and
had requested immunity from arrest for all Yippies during the
convention for crimes around the possession of narcotics. The
Yippies stated that any arrest would cause the Yippie community
to cause large scale riots, and the blame of any riots resulting
from such arrests would fall on the Chicago Pp.

These representatives of the Yippies were advised
in no uncertain terms that the laws of the City of Chicago
would be strictly enforced fairly on all persons and that no

_ one would be granted any immunity during this period.

The Bureau's attmtion is invited to the August 9,
1968, issue of the "Daily World," daily publication of the
Communist Party, USA (CP), wherein an article appeared on page
one captioned "Rallies Will Ring Demo Convention" written by
CARYL /DAVIAU, current memberl, CP of Illinois, in which the
reporger indicates that the National Mobilization Committee
to my the War in Vietnam,which is working around the clock to
mobilize demonstrations against the convention,has petitioned
the Justice Department to investigate the Chicago Police to
determine if there is any conspiracy to deprive "us" of our
full civil liberties. ,

Chicago will continue to. follow these matters
closely and immediately advise the Bureau, and continue to
disseminate all information of intelligence collected to
interested agencies.

No recommendation is being made nor is Chicago
involving itself in any plans affecting the issuance of the
abovementioned park permit.

As the Bureau is aware, Chicago is in receipt of
information from confidential scarces indicating a potential
for demonstration arising out of the "New Left" calling for
direct confrontation with the Chicago Police Department as a
diversionary tactic for a "crash-in" at the convention site,
Sources have also reported independent action on the part of
individuals to cause some form of "sabotage" activity inside
the convention itself. Information received from confidential
informants in other divisions indicates attempts on the part
\ of dissident young people not organizationally affiliated with
the "New Left", to hire 50 buses out of New York to bring
demonstrators to Chicago and a caravan of militant Latin
&mericans to come from the Miami, Florida area to Chicago for
; the specific purpose of disrupting the Democratic National
’ Convention,

The Chicago area activists in the Youth International
Party are currently planning a "Festival of Lights" in one of
[ the parks on Chicago's lakefront during the period of the
Democratic National Convention, This “Festivai of Lights"
characterized by Chicago area Yippie leadership as being peaceful
to show America thut there is an alternative to the "festival
of death", or the Democratic National Convention, However,
sources report that there are elements within the Youth Inter-
national Party which are calling for direct confrontation with
the Chicago Police Department during the "Festival of Lights".
There is a very definite indication that more and
more plans are being made by these groups to cause violence and
* : trouble and undoubtedly this will increase even more as we
approach the time of the convention, [I strongly feel that we
must use every possible means at our command to insure that
the Director, the President of the United States and other, pertinent
officials are furnished every possible piece of. intelligence
information which we can gather from any source,

I am specifically asking for the services of two
Special Agents who proved during their assignment, in Chicago that
they are expecially well qualified to handle informants and make
contacts in the "New Left" area. They proved during their
assignments in Chicago that they have the knowhow, the interest,
the dedication and the personality to be highly successful in

NW 65360 Docld:32989550 Page 86

this area. [I would like to utilize them specificaily to work
cases in the "New Left" area, maxi contacts and would also
request authority where necessary to utilize them in under-
cover work under my personal supervision and guidance, They
would be specifically assigned fulltime to solicit information
from the leadership cf the "New Left" concerning their plans

f : for demonstrations, confrontations and disruptions of the
Democratic Convention and matters relating thereto,

ioprsSuREREEEE iam, therefore, urgently requesting tha
: yd. DILLON, IJi, presently assigned to Los Angels A WAYNE

: A NiS, under transer to Anniston, Alabama Resident ency ,}
be assigned on a temporary basis in Chicago for the above stated
purpose from August 15, 1968 through August 31, 1968, Both

men, while young in years in the Bureau, demonstrated outstanding
judgment and I am convinced that their assignments, as recommended
above, would prove to be most beneficial in carrying out our
responsibilities in connection with the Democratic Convention.

A meeting of the National Defense Committee of
the VVAW/WSO was held on 6/7~9/74 at St. Louis, Missouri,

-organization's Defense Committee will take steps to secure
the release or acquittals of any members arrested.

A representative from the National Collective
in Chicago talked about the Gainesville 8 in a derogatory
manner, implying the Government did not try the Gainesville
8 for purely political reasons, but that the leader and
some others plannéd some Kind of illegal aciivity. He ulso
said if there had been no Agent provocateur there would
never have been a trial and that the National Collective
would not have permitted violent activity. 17 items
were handed out, a large portion of which were reprints
from national and "movement" publications covering such
topics as how to avoid being questioned by the FBI, -
One of these, on jury selection, is attached.

During July, 1962, Rowe advised that a Klansman
told a select group of other Klansmen that “it

looks as if the Negroes should be stopped new.”

had promised them protection and that a high

state official would pardon them if arrested.

Phis Klansman further advised that if a particular
“militant Negro Integrationist" would appear at

Negro Integrationist" did not appear at this
restaurant but scent other Megroes to staga a
sit-in, then there would be no Killing. He stated
that these Negroes should be beaten with chains
and clubs instead.

cussions regarding a plan to handle alleged “race
mixing" at a local night clue. Also discussed
was a plan by Klansmen to bomb this night club.

know what informant's thoughts are as to meeting this
obligation to his exewife. Also advise if infoxymant considers
theses payments as necessary monthly obligations that he would

The Birmingham Office is to give this your immediate
attention and promptly advise the Bureau.

NOTE:

The Birmingham Office has pointed out that Rowe has
performed an aluable service to the Bureau.and has saved an
_untold amount of inan power and various expenses in connection
with the shooting of Mrs. Viola Liuazzo. Informant has been
in protective custody of the Bureau since 4/1/65 and not had
opportunity to be gainfully employed to meet various obligations,
The Birmingham Office has recommended that the Bureau pay
informant's outstanding bills in order to continue the exceilent
relationship developed, We are presently paying him $16 per day
subsistence in lieu of expenses which figure was decided upon
after discussion withthe Department. It is not desired to make
a large payment at this time which could be construed as a payment
to Rowe for his testimony in the up-coming trials, Birmingham
previously requested to submit a detailed accounting of Rowe's
debts showing their basis, when contracted and schedule of
payments, The information received from the field needs to he
further clarified after which time this matter will be discussed
with the Department and its views obtained as to whether or not
payment of these debts would be judicious at this time.

Meriorandum to Mr. Belmont
' RE:, EUGENE THOMAS, ET AL

OBSERVATIONS OF GENERAL INVESTIGATIVE DIVISION

: The Bureau is currently paying Gary Thomas Rowe
$16.00 per day subsistence in licu of expenses This figure
was initially decided upon after discussion with the Depart..ent,
and with the Department's approval, as it was recognized that
the informant had to be removed from the Birmingham area for
his protection and safety. The Department pointed out that
it would not be desirable to make any lump sum or large
* payment .to the informant so long as he might be called upon
to testify, as any such large payments might be construed
in court as a payment for his testimony, whereas payment
of his living expenses can readily be’ justified as a necessity,
Gh. ins which
was called
upon to Se a record of ev aeneat to the informant. Ina
future trial, it is reasonable to expect that we will again be
called upon to produce such a record. The payment of Rowe's
debts at this time amounting to over two thousand dollars
}wowld appear in this record of payments to Rowe, and we
certainly could not agree to pay such a large amount at this
time without the Department's approval,
acme AA

With regard to the debts themselves, it would not
appear from information furnished by Birmingham that they are
all due and payable immediately, as the larger debts to the
two banks would probably be payable in monthly installments.
We could, with Department's approval, agree to payment of
his smaller debts and monthly installments on these larger

debts as they come due.

RECOMMENDATION

: In view of the above, it is recommended that
Birmingham be instructed to submit a detailed accounting of
Rowe's debts showing their basis, when they were contracted,

_@ue dates and a full breakdown of any installment contracts
showing detailed schedule of payments. Upon receipt of this
information, the matter will be discussed with the uapeialpeae
and their viows as to whether or not payment of these debts
at this time would be judicious, will be obtained. hater

Alabama, beginning 11/29/65, had exhibited feelings of reluctance
-to testify for the Government and set forth certain conditions
under which he would agree to testify. seed

t

These conditions consist of an agreement from the
*Attorney General that his testimony would not be required in any
future proceedings, that he be assisted-in obt tatming employment
and that some assurances be given him for the future security of
his ex-wife and children and parents, He aiso expressed a desire
to visit his wife and children in the Tampa, Florida, area over

the Thanksgiving holday,. ‘

Rowe's conditions were discussed in detail’with ©. Jf
Assistant Attorney General John Doar, Mr. Doar advised that he
would discuss these conditions immediately with the Attorney

SUBJECT STIMONY_BY_ THE. . ‘ATTORNEY GENERAL. BEFORE... THE
7 / SENATE SELECT COMMITTER ‘ON INTELLIGENCE A ACTIVITIES ~

On 11/21/75, Inspector John B. Hotis met with Doug
Marvin, Counselor to the Attorney General; Mark Wolf, Special
Assistant to the Attorney General, and Michael E. Shaheen, Jr.,
Special Counsel for Intelligence Coordination, concerning
Mr. Levi's forthcoming appearance before th Senate Select
Committee on Intelligence Activities. The Attorney ‘General
will have a prepared st Statement which will probably deal with |
the future relationship between the Bureau and the Department
and the kinds of contacts. needed to. prevent abuse of authority.
Mr. Marvin asked that the Bureau provide the following materials,
which will be used in the preparation of a briefing book for

Mr. Levi's testimony: : Ai ao
(I) A general synopsis of major areas of the Bufeai's ©

activities that have been investigated by. the Senate and House
Select Committees. Mr. Marvin gave as examples, the “Official

and Confidential" files, COINTELPRO, use of informants, and in-
terception of mails. He said the purpose is. to identify those
. topics which have been of primary concern to the Committees.

Mr. Marvin asked that :the synopses. contain a brief statement iG

. the Bureau's position on each 45 the. subiecss;, —_ hh (ES

ne il ~f2 a

(2). A general oe coneérhing ae began eationel

| structure and functions of the FBI, with particular emphasis on
the responsibilities of the Inspection Division. This should
include a description of how complaints are received, the review
process, and any recent changes iin the operations of that Division.
In addition, the Attorney General wants a write-up of all investi-
gations of alleged misconduct presently being. conducted by the
“Bureau. He is particularly concerned about any incidents that

may have occurred during Mr. Levi's tenure as Attorney een

such ‘as those in Richmond, Detroit, and Houston. _

Legal Counsel to Mr. Adams

RE: . TESTIMONY. BY. THE ATTORNEY GENERAL BEFORE ‘THE
SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES.

(8).. A history of Congressional oversight of. the Bureau.
Mr. Marvin asked that we identify. those Subcommittees of Congress °
which have exercised some oversight responsibilities over. the
Bureau. In particular, he asked that we review appropriations
testimony going. back ‘to 1955. to determine whether we discussed
. topics which ‘are presently of concern to: the Select Committees.
This will be very useful in demonstrating Congressional aware-
ness of these matters. He also asked that we ‘furnish a statement -
of the Director's. position concerning Congressional oversight :
which he has: previously. expressed in speeches or testimony
before Congress.’

(4) .A list of major investigative techniques. employed
by. the Bureau, specifying in each ‘case whether we seek Depart~
mental approval. . The more obvious. examples are electronic
surveillance,: use ‘of body recorders, pen registers, informants.
and photographic surveillances.:

(5) A list of any formal or informal proposals which have
been made. ‘concerning, organizational ‘changes of the FBI. © Examples -
are ‘the icreation of an Inspector General's Office in the Depart-
ment or elsewhere having review authority over the FBI, transfer
of. counterintelligence functions to: another agency or. the creation

. of a separate Division within the Bureau for that function, trans-
_ fer of drug enforcement responsibilities. to the Bureau, and the
proposed statutory limitation on the term of the office for. the
Director.

It should be noted that several position papers concern-
ing ‘such topics were prepared at ‘the request of former. Acting
Director L. Patrick Gray which might be useful in responding. to.
this request..

Although no date has been set for the Attorney General's
. testimony, it is expected that he will testify after Mr. Kelley's -
appearance on 12/9/75. In view of the limited time available,
Mr. Marvin asked that we expedite the preparation of these
materials and furnish ‘them to his office as soon as. ‘they are
_ completed. It is requested that ‘these materials be submitted
. to the Office of Congressional Affairs, when completed, but no
latex than cob, Friday, 11/28/75: . They should be submitted in
insert form suitable ‘for inclusion in a letterhead memorandum.

Dear Mike:

As_a follow-up to our briefing of Assistant Director
Wannall on November 6 concerning our proposed format and
witnesses for public hearings on December 4-5 on the FBI's
use of intelligence informants and sources, we would like
to make the following requests.

As discussed ‘in our meeting with Mr. Wannall, we in-
vite the Bureau to submit a memorandum on its intelligence —
informant and source program that could be inserted in
the record of the testimony of Bureau representatives at
the hearing. This memorandum would enable the Bureau to-
present to the Select Committee a complete description
of its program and to discuss the issues of particular
interest to the Committee members. These include, for

“example, 1) the size, scope and purpose of the program,
including an assessment of the pregram's cost and effective-
- ness, and the distinctions and relationships between the
intelligence informant program and the Bureau's criminal
informant activity; 2) the criteria that determine when
an informant may be used in an organization or group; and
3) the program's command and control system, including the
- limits that are placed on the activities of informants
and the type of information an informant or source is per-
mitted to report to his handling agent and the Bureau.
In addition, the memorandum would discuss possible leg-
islation in the informant area, such as the imposition
of a warrant requirement or additional administrative re-
view. To permit the Select Committee members to study this
memorandum in advance of the hearing and to discuss it
with FBI representatives during their testimony at the pub
| lic‘hearing, we request, that (Ehe memorandum be submitted | y
! by November 24, pervs ‘i i 3

Also I am enclosing requests for documents relating
to two of the three former FBI informants who are scheduled
to testify on December 4. These requests supplement our
document request of August 20, 1975 pertaining to informants
(Part IV-4). 7

‘In addition, we wish to interview and possibly de-
pose the Special Agents who handl7d the three former in-
formants (Rowe, Hardy and Cook) who are scheduled to
testify at the public hearing on December 4. Because of
the limited time remaining before the scheduled hearings,

“we request'that the Special Agents be made: available for
interviews and dépositions as soon as possible.

in the afternoon to discuss counterintell gence investi-

. this particular topic would be the main focal point of the hear-
ing. Elliff stated that the questions asked of the Bureau's
witness would deal primarily with the feasibility of removal of
counterintelligence out of the FBI including problems of a
logistical and practical nature resulting from such a change.
E1liff asked that he be advised as to the identity of the Bureau
witness as soon as possible.

Inasmuch_as the aforementioned topic is_a_question of _
policy,. the Direct Director may desire to appear or designate a

John T. Elliff, Domestic Task Force Director of fit ee —
Senate Select Committee, advised at 9:15 a.m. on 12/3/75 that .
the following is a statement to be read by Senator Frank “Lit

of that Committee on 12/73/75. gy}

Attorney General Kennedy authorized wiretaps in

1962 on New York Times reporter Hanson Baldwin and his
secretary and that lasted for about one month. In addition
to the wiretap on New York Times reporter Hanson Baldwin in
1962, the Committee has received materials from the FBI re-
flecting authorization by Attorney General Kennedy of a
wiretap on a reporter for Newsweek Magazine in 1961 during
the investigation of another leak of classified information.
Further materials reflected authorization by Attorney General
Nicholas Katzenbach for a wiretap on the editor of an anti-
Communist newsletter in 1965, also during the investigation

of a leak of classified information. The Committee has received
materials from the FBI reflecting authorization by Attorney
General Robert F. Kennedy of wiretaps on at least six American
citizens, including three Executive Branch officials, a Con-
gressional Staff Member, and two registered lobbying agents
for foreign interests. The materials also reflect that these
wiretaps relate to an investigation of agents by foreign in-
terests to influence United States economic policies. NE

El1iff was advised by SA Paul V. Daly of this Division -
that an impression would be created by the aforementioned statement
that this Bureau may have conducted an electronic surveillance on
Capitol Hill and that this, of course, was inaccurate. The elec-
tronic surveillance concerning. the Congressional Staff Member was
not located on Congressional property. EL11iff agreed with this
observation and indicated that he would check the material to
insure the electronic surveillance in Guesthorwas"tot on Con-
gressional property and as agreed, make a change in
