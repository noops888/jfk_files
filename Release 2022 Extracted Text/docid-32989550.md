U. S. SENATE SELECT CO:MITTEE TO

STUDY GOVERNMENTAL OPERATIONS WITH

RESPECI TO INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC)

Reference is made to SSC requests contained in letter

of Senator Frank Church dated November 7, 1975, for materials

concerning Martin Luther King, Jr.

the purpose of this memorandum is to citect delivery

to the Sse of information and materials in response to requests

contained in the above SSG letter,

The attention of the SSC is invited to IBI menorandum

dated November I1, 1975, which referred to a highly sensitive

oral briefing furnished to Senator Church and selected members

of the SSC Staff by FBI personnel on Novenbar 5, 1975. This

briefing was intended, in part, to serve in lieu of any

written intormation in response to SSe requests for conuuni-

cations documenting Stanley David Levison as a secret member

Because of SSC insistence in requesting itens to

establish factual basis for Levison's secret CPUSA membership,

as set forth in referenced sse letter, our New York offiCe

was contacted for documents representing original recording:

from Bureau informants concerning Levison.

As a result our

New York office provided the material which is now being

delivered and which has served as a basis for statements in

various FBI documents that levison was a secret member of

the CrUSA.

"ALL, FSIINFORMATION CONTAITED

:

Dear Mr. Shaheen:

4277003YJ0L

I want you to know how much I appreciated the

opportunity to meet with you and your associates the other

day about the Martin Luther King, Jr. case.

helpful to have the benefit of the Bureau's knowledge con-

cerning the background of the case, and i can assure you

that we will do everything possible to avoid joepardizing

any sensitive FBI sources or ongoing operations.

I do want to reiterate our need for the specific

items set forth in earlier document requests which would

presumably establish the factual basis for your conclusion

as of various dates in 1962, 1963 and 1964 that Stanley

Levison was a "secret nember of the Cormunist Party, USA."

Of course in the event that there is no particular document

in any of those years wherein Levison was so-identified to

the FBI, I think it would be nelpful for you to let us know

so that we may consider our outstanding requests in that

still need unezcised copies

And N

Once again, I want to thank you for your time and

I look forward to nearing from you

SENSITIVE

SiEGiO INTELUGENCE OPERATI ON

Con 4/9/64, INY 594-S* made the following observations

with regard to the CP siatus of STANLEY LEVISON:

LEVISON has been an important Party member for

many years (and never at any time differed with the party with

respect to the Party line.

His only difference with the

Party has been with respect to the fact that in his opinion

the party was not sufficiently "militant" in defending

Negro rights. In this respect, he has been to the "left"

of the party. LEVISON's differences with the party are merely

SFIO

He has never criticized the party, except wich

respect to the Party's handling of the Negro question.

The

fact that he does not accept domination by the party with

regard to the MARTIN LUTHER KING movement should not be

construed to mean that he has broken with the Party in all

respects.

The Party today is as anxious to reestablish friendly

relations with LEVISON as it was in the past. )

It should be noted that LEVISON never has been

officially "drummed out" of the Party, nor has anyone ever

criticized him for being opposed to the Party's general

principles.

It further should be noted that according to

the CP Constitution, it would require formal expulsion of

SFOIsVISON to state that he is officlally out of the Party.

LEVISON never has said anything reflecting that

te does not continue to be a CP member.

It. should be noted

That it would be in the interests of the MARTIN LUTHER KING

novement, with which he is associated, if he would publicly

repudiatesthe Party, which he has never done. It should be

further noted that in an effort to renew friendly relations

FOR MAGRIT

NY 100-111180

with LEVISON, the Party designated BEN DAVIS to contact

LEVISON. LEVISON had always expressed the opinion that

BEN DAVIS was the only CP functionary who had a sufficiently

"militant attitude" as regards CP activities in behalf of

the Negro movement. The fact that DAVIS and LEVISON as yet

have not met should not be construed to mean that LEVISON

has refused to confer with DAVIS.

As NY 694-5* understands

the situation, DAVIS has been awaiting contact by LEVISON,

and LEVISON similarly has been awaiting contact by DAVIS.

Each of these individuals is sufficiently egotistical to

expect that the other would make the first move in an effort

to establish contact. Ny 694-s* believes that probably the

reason why DAVIS and LEVISON have not met is that arrangements

for their meeting were to be made by LEM HARRIS and that

HARRIS has not made the proper efforts to effect a meeting

between LEVISON and DAVIS.

NY 694-S* has never obtained any information re-

flecting that LEVISON has changed his thinking with regard to

Marxism. Even though his present estrangement from the Party

might be construed as reflecting he is no longer a CP member,

there is no reason to come to the conclusion that LEVISON is

no longer an ideological Communist.

JACK talked to LEM HARRIS yesterday who said he

contacted

STAN LEVENSON by phone and was given a cordial

hello which was a change from the past when he was cool.

LEM said he had not seen LEVENSON, tried to call him

and would like to see him immediately to which LEVENSON said,

"I would like very much to see you but I don't have the time

now. I'm leaving and pacling for a trip. I will be glad to

see you in six weeks."

LEVENSON implier, that he was going to Ecuador but

LEM doesn't know why.

There was no anger shown, and LEVENSON

will see LEM when he retuns in six weeks.

(on 6/13/53, MY 694-s* fumished the following

information to SA ALEXANDER C.

BURLINSON:

On 6/12/63, LEMENT HARRIS, CPUSA Reserve Funa

told Ny 694-5* that in a recent meeting with

STANLEY LEVISON, the latter furnished him the following

information:

The LEVISONS, particularly STANLEY, are still

MARTIN LUTHER KING's "brain trust"--now more than ever before.

This is so despite the fact that at a meeting of STANLEY

LEVISON, ROY LEVISON, HUNTER PITTS O'DELI,

MARTIN LUTHER

KING and "the Attorney General's chief assistant"

Attorney General's assistant, pointing to the LEVISONS

ana MUNIER PITTS O'DELL, stated to MARTIN LUTHER KING,

"These men are Party members; watch out for them."

MARTIN LUTHER KING did not "bat an eyelash" upon

hearing the Assistant Attorney General's remark, and after

the later left the meeting, those in the group smiled at each

other.

STANLEY IEVISON said to KING, at this:time,

congratulate you on the way you acted regarding his warning.

You are a real Marxist-Leninist. This is how a true

Marist-leninist acts."

Everything that KING does he first discusses

WIEL STANLEY LEVISON and he accepts LEVISON's advice whole-

heartealy. KING also wholeheartedly accepts the advice of

HUNTER PITTS O'DELL as regards matters within the latter's

local jurisdiction.

MARTIN LUTHER KING waS asked by a group of newspaper

reporters whether he takes

"the Communists"

KING's response was that he took orders only from God.

By reason of the fact that the LEVISONS feel that

the Party has done little, if anything, to assist the fight

that the farty, as a result of this "do nothing"

With respect to the MARTIN LUTHER KING movement, they will

act on their own initiative, and will not accept instructions

Irom the Party.

LEM HARRIS then advised that the Party, however,

still would like to control the MARTIN LUTHER KING movement.

BEN DAVIS has been assigned to be "liaison or intermediary"

with the LEVISONS and HUNTER PITTS O'DELL. Whether or not

the LEVISONS and O'DELL will maintain liaison regarding

matters concerning the MARTIN LUTHER KING movement is a

matter for them to decide.

In view of LEVISON's statement ••

with respect to advising MARTIN LUTHER KING independently

of Party instructions, it would seem that DAVIS may not have

any success in maintaining llaison with the LEVISONS and

HUNTER PITTS O'DELL.

The LEVISONS and O'DELL are aware of

the fact that BEN DAVIS has been given this assignment

by the Party.

MARTIN LUTHER KING, according to LEM HARRIS, i:

referred to by such top Parly functionaries as GUS HALL.

In the Party: the report 1s that MARTIN LUTHER

KING is following a Marxist-Leninist line.

NY 694-S* advised that he asked LEM HARRIS whether

of not, to the latter's knowledge, MARTIN LUTHER KING waS

a member of the CPUSA, LEM HARRIS

replied that he did not

know.

When Dr. MARTIN LUTHER KING was invited to address

the AFI-CIO convention some time ago, KING, on LEVISON's ad-

vice, first obtained approval to do so fxom A. PHILLIP RANDOLPH,

negro labor leader, who, if he had not been consulted in the

matter, might have felt

that KING's making a speech at the

aforesaid convention was a blow to RANDOLPH's prestige.

KING delivered a remarkably effective speech at the

AFL-CIO convention, and, asa result, received invitacions

from numerous labor leaders, including "MC DONALD of Steel,"

to address their respective unions. As the oubstanding

champion of negro rights in the country, KING is a powerful

political influence, recognized as such

by the higher echelons

of the Democratic Party.

He has access to Attorney General

ROBERT KENNEDY and President KENNEDY, who, politically, need

KING, particularly in the south, where in cities like Atlanta

and New Orleans the negro vote now constitutes the balance of

power, and where KING controls the negro vote.

Teamsters Union "boss" appreciates

the political power of KING, particularly the fact that KING

can influence the 90,000 negro members of the Teamsters

Union.

HOFFA invited KING to address the Teamsters Union,

and KING accepted the invitation.

Knowing that KING is being

deferred to by Attorney General KENNEDY, and President KENNEDY,

HOFFA requested KING to contact the Attorney General in an

effort to influence the latter "to lay off"

Inclined to do as HoFfA requested, but IEVISON conviliced him

but

HOFFA. KING was

that to do so would be politically unwise, inexpedient, and

likely to be a "boomerang,"

since the Attorney General would

never accede to such a request, particularly in the case of

HOFFA.

LEVISON had to steer KING away from another politi

cally hazardous situation.

Some months ago OTTO PREMINGER,

Hollywood movie director, entered into negotiations with a

KING representative for KING to play a part in a picture

organization, LevIsoN realized that for KING to accept the

offer would lower the latters prestige. After convincing

telling him that

KING of this fac"the deal was off.'

LEVISON personally telephoned to PREMINGER,

What LEVISON particularly wanted GUS HALL to knaw

is that

KING is a wholehearted Marxist, who has studied

1t (Marxism), believes in it, and agrees with it, but because

of his being

His office is the Northern Branch of the SCLC.

The Committee to Defend MARTIN LUTHER KING, at 312 West

125th Street, was organized as an "ad hoc"

committee to

assist in the KING defense, when he was the subject of

as to whether a person contributing money makes out checks

payable to the committee to Defend MARTIN LUTHER KING, the

administrative assistant. LEVISON stated that in the

past LEVISON had not considered it wise for O'DELL tO

take on such a position, but he is the only one who could

do the job and should be considered for it. LEVISON stated

as long as O'DELL did not have the title of Executive

Director, there would not be "as much lightening flashing

around him"

• O'DELL could be called a coordinator and

still fulfill all the duties of Executive Director.

ELSUR

LEVISON stated, according to & 3575-5*

that

•KING liked LEVISON's suggestion with respect to @'DELI

taking this position, because KING felt that O'DELL

what a man was, if he could stand up now and say he is

not connected,

then as far as I am concerned, he is eligible

to work for me"

as:

"All income less expenses is transmitted to the

Southern Christian Leadership Conference or directly paid

out to sources indicated by the Southern Christian Leader-

ship Conference.

DI. MARTIN LUTHER KING is President of

,the Southern Christian Leadership Conference."

A "note" attached to the application stateà that

the committee was created by resolution as an unincorporated

association at an organizing neeting held at the home of

HARRY BELAFONTE, 300 West End Avenue, in June, 1960.

The application for exemption from the New York City

amusement tax was denied by letter 1/31/61, sent to the

Committee to Aid the Southern Freedom Struggle, 312 West 125th

Street, attention of STANLEY D. LEVISON.

Ny has considered the above facts and is of the

opinion that a Cominfil investigation of the NY Chapter

of the SCLO is warranted, due to the dominant CP influence

on the executives of the NY Chapter of the SCIC.

Ny will conduct no further investigation without

prior Bureau authority.

ATE FBI INFORVIATION CONTAINED

• Dear Mike:

As a follow-up to our briefing of Assistant Director

Wannall

on November 6 concerning our proposed tormat and

witnesses for public hearings on December 4-5 on the FBI's

use of intelligence informants

and sources, we would like

to make the following requests.

As discussed in our meeting with Mr. Wannall, we in-

vite the Bureau to submit a memorandum on its intelligence

informant and source program that could be inserted in

the record of the testimony of Bureau representatives at

the hearing. This memorandum would enable the Bureau to

present to the Select Committee a complete description

'of its program and to discuss the issues of particular

interest to the Committee members.

These include, for

example, 1) the size, scope and purpose of the program,

including an assessment of the program's cost and effective-

and the distinctions and relationships between the

intelligence informant program and the Bureau's

criminal

informant activity; 2) the criteria that determine when

an informant may be used in an organization or group; and

3) the program's command and control system, including the

limits that are placed on the activities of informants

and the type of information an informant or source is per-

mitted to report to his handling agent and the Bureau.

In addition,

the memorandum would discuss possible leg-

islation in the informant area, such as the imposition

of a warrant requirement or additional administrative re-

view.

To permit the Select Committee members to study this

memorandum in advance of the hearing and to discuss it

with FBI representatives during their testimony at the

Iic hearing, we request that the memorandum be submite ub

by November 24.

Reference ia further made to our memoranda dated

July 17, 1975, and September 25, 1975, which provided hackground

information and documents pertaining to the SI, ADEX, and RI.

As you are avare, a computerized ADBY listing is pro

pared monthly at

the SI list was prepared in the same

manner and, as with the former SI, when a

new monthly ADEr. list

ls prepared copies of the old list are destroyed inasmuch as they

are outdated and no longer serve a useful purpose.

As you

have

been previously advised, names appearing on che formor bI and

the ADEX have been printed on 5 & 8 cards with a single name

printed on each card:

Background information, file numbers, and

type of ectivity in which the individual 16 engaged are also

placed 'on these carda.

As you are aware, approximately 15,000 ot

these cards, all outdated, have been located as FBINg.

These

cards include sone wion contain the identity of individuals tho

were maintained on the Priority III level of the formar sI and

all ADEa cards deleted or cancelled since its inception.

During

the initial period of establishing the ADEX, In

order to obviate the nood for conducting massive file reviews,

the ADaX consistad primarily of the identity of those individuals

who had been naintained

on che

former SI.

Although these names

vere originally placed in this manner on the new ADIX, as cases

reviewed under our then existing reporting procedures, each

was to be reviewed on its on merits utilizing the then

current criteria for MeX to determine whether continued in

clusion on the ADEX was varranted.

If not, the individual's

name was deleted. As previously indicated, during 1972 the ADEX

was evaluated and revised.

Following this rovision, the number

of individuals who vero included on the ADEX began to decline

and thus the high number of cancolled cards. In accordanco with

Bureau policy, which was instituted during the SI program, these

cancelled cards are maintained at FBIIlD for a period of three

years and there is no way to rcoonstuct a formor SI OI ADIX list

fos a particular time period by roviering these cancelled cards.

These cards, however, vill roflect the idontity of those in-

dividuals who have been placed on the sI and the ADEX for the

period for which these cards were maintained.

Por your request, theso outdatca SI and ADEX cards

are available for review by appropriate SSC reprecontives

a: FBIHQ.

In this regard, SSC Staff lembers Martha Talley and

John I, Illiff have had access to these cards on October 30,

1975, and Novembor 7, 1975, rospectively.

During it. Illlit's review of these cards, the names

Shelley Blun, Emanuel James Brisker, JI., and Gregory Allan

Calvert were selocted by lix. Elliff in conncotion with Icquest

number two oi your October 28, 1975, letter.

A review of pertinent files at FBIIQ zogarding the SI

and the RI indicates thore are no other versions of the formor

mined these programs had boon handled in accordance with then

ALL INFORMATION CONTAINED

HEREIN IS UNCLASSIFIED

DATED /21/DE BY SP2 ALC

Reference is made to my letter dated July 1, 1975, which

enclosed a memorandum of the same date relating to a request for

documentary materials made by the Senate Select Committee (SSC)

under the date of May 14, 1975.

The referenced memorandura, on page 1, paragraph 4,

refers to a briefing by FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover to the National

Security Council, presided over by the President, on November 6,

1958. A further review of our records has determined this briefing

by vir, Hoover was actually furnished to the President and members

of his Cabinet on November 6,

1958. Although it is likely members

of the National Security Council were present, technically it was a

briefing of the President and his Cabinet.

Attached for your approval and forwarding to the Committee

is the priginal of a memorandum correcting this technical error and

requesting the Committee appropriately change its records.

A copy of the memorandum is provided for your records.

Reference is made to a memorandum dated 11/12/75

from Legal Counsel to Mr. J. B. Adams, Deputy Associate Director,

in which a recommendation was made that the Intelligence Division

determine whether there is a memorandum describing a briefing of

former Attorney General Ramsey Clark by Mr. Cartha DeLoach,

former Assistant to the Director, concerning the Counterintelligence

Program.

Mr. DeLoach, during an interview under oath by staff

members of the Senate Select Committee on 11/11/75, advised that

he had briefed Ramsey Clark regarding the Counterintelligence

Program and, when asked whether he had written a memorandum

regarding that briefing, advised that he could not specifically recall

whether a memorandum was prepared. During the interview by

Committee staff members, they advised Mr. DeLoach that they had

asked for such documentation from the Bureau, but a memorandum

indicating Mr. DeLoach had briefed Ramsey Clark regarding the

Counterintelligence Program was not received among the gocuments

furnished by the Bureaus

Department of State advised that the primary objective of

the visitors was to discuss with the Ambassador and

members of his staff the relationships and exercise of

authority by the Ambassador of the intolligence activities

in the field. The Department of State further advised that

operational details, sources and methods were not construed

to be logitimate avenues of inquiry by the SSC Staff

Members.

Legat, Brasilia, was interviewed on September 22,

1975, by Messrs. Aaron and Truehart, with Aaron being

dominant in the

interviewing process. The interview was

directed mainly toward attempts to elicit examples whereby

JFK Act 5 (g) (2) (D)

Specific questions were placed with Legat to

ascertain if the FBI was involved in Sovlet Embassy

JFK Act 5 (9) 1211D

"walk-ins" as well as recruitment of double agents and

JFK Act 5 (g) (2) (D)

I Discussion concerning Legat's role

and functions in Brasilia appeared to be routine, with few,

it any, pointed questions directed at FBI opcrations

overseas, The subject of two paid confidential sources in

Brasilia was briefly discussed and both SSC investigators

appeared understanding and in agreement with the necessity

each confidential source to serve FBI's and U.S.

Government's best interests in Brazil. The question

scemingly

bcaring the most weight during the interview

concerned possible unauthorized activities of CIA and its

lack of cooperation and coordination with FBI and the

Defense Attache's Office.

The duration of the intervic

vas approximately forty-five minutes D

Legat, Buenos Aires, was interviewed by the two

SSC Staff Members on September 26, 1975.

Memorandum advises concerning proposed ssC

hearing on FBI foreign counterintelligence (CI) matters.

On 10/30/75 Mr. John Elliff, SSC Staff Member,

met with Assistant Director W. R. Wannall, Intelligence

Division (INTD). Also present were Section Chiefs W. A.

Branigan

(CI-1)

and W. 0. Cregar (CI-2) and Acting Section

Chief F. J. Cassidy (IS-3) and Unit Chief E. W. Larson,

Training Unit (IS-3). Mc. Elliff advised that the Committee

proposed to have an executive session tentatively scheduled

for the morning of Friday, 11/14/75, whichdwouldndeal with

toreign et operations.

In addition

to representatives from

the FBI they envisioned also having present representatives

from CIA and

the United States military intelligence services.

He stated that the session would be scheduled for approximately

2 and one-half hours.

During the conference the following three themes

were outlined by Mr. Elliff as the probable areas of

discussion:

I. Changes in CI operations during recent years

Items discussed as probably worthy of attention

were physical surveillances, the walk-in operations,

defection (recruitment-in-place), Cl training programs:

Also suggested

as a prime topic

was the future projections

concerning administration of foreign CI operations in

United States,

i.e.s

new division for CI work within FBI;

separate CI service; or other modifications.

Memorandum to Mr. W. R. Wannall

Re:

U.

S. Senate Select Committee

on Intelligence Activities

(SSC)

2. Counter-subversion

In this category Mr. Elliff indicated a particular

interest in foreign influence

in domestic groups and the

assessment of danger/risk in investigations undertaken to

detect such influence.

He brought up the disclosures of

surveillances by ClA of Americans abroad at the request of

the FBI.

He also indicated an interest in borderline cases,

such as those in which domestic counter-subversion

investigations develop a CI aspect, and was particularly

interested in the policies and coordinating mechanisms

affecting such instances.

3. Positive intelligence collection

In this category Mr. Elliff was interested in

the responsibility for collection of positive intelligence

within the United States and the apparent gap which existed

in this field. He was also interested in situations under

which the FBI might target friendly foreign intelligence

services in the United States for CI attention.

Considerable discussion was held during the

conference during which INTD representatives set forth the

FBI's position and experience in the many areas noted:

They are being set forth here to illustrate the probable

scope and nature of the executive session which is being

planned. Further discussions will be held with the SSC

staff to clarify these matters and a firmer agenda for the

proposed 11/14/75 hearing will be developed.

With respect to the proposed plan to include

representatives of CIA and the military intelligence services

along with

the FBI in the proposed session of 2 and one

half hours, it was

pointed out to Mr. Elliff that this would

not appear

to be a very productive procedure.

The CI

perspectives and responsibilities of CIA and the military

services are much more narrow and generally in a completely

of the FBI, These differences, particularly in the short

As the Bureau is aware, I am gravely concerned ove"

the potential for serious violence occurring in Chicago during

the period of the Democratic Convention, which commences

August 26, 1968 and the days immediately preceding this

convention. Had the convention occurred within 30 days after

the President made his announcement that he was not going to

run for reelection and after the Viet Nam peace talks started

in Paris, I feel that we might not have had serious violence

as these

two occurrences took much of

the steam out of many of

the organizations comprising the

"New Left". Their direction

at that time

was primarily against President JOHNSON and

against Viet Nam and much of the steam went out of their

programs following these two announcements.

It is our observation, however, that these "New Left"

organizations have now had time

to redirect their programs

and

are now concentrating primarily on demonstrations and

activities against Vice President HUMPIREY, characterized

by them as the "Dump Humphrey Campaign".

war still continues in Viet Nam, has again given emphasis

to the organizations which exist on the basic theme of anti-

Viet Nam.

I am

thinking particularly of such organizations

as the National Mobilization Committee to End the War in Viet

Nam,

Students for Democratic Society, Student Mobilization

Committee to End

the War in Viet Nam and the Youth

International

Party (Xippies).

CHRISTOPHE?, and Mr. WES POMEROY of the U.S. Department of

Justice, Washington, D.C., in the presence of USA FOREN in

his offices.

Mr. CHRISTOPHER was most congenial and expressed

his high regard foi the FBI and asked for a current evaluation

of activities in the Chicago area which could possibly affect

the Democratic National Convention (DNC) being held the last-

week of August, 1968. Mr. CHEISTOPHER was advised that all

information has

been previcusly furnished to him by letterhead

memoranda and was in his possession and he was assured all

information coming

to our attention would be immediately

furnished to the Department and to the USA in Chicago.

one of

the Chicago area parks during the week of the convention and

hold a "happening" which the Yippies referred to as the "Festival

of Life."

not been granted and that his sources have indicated no serious

For the Bureau's information, Sgt. JOSEPH GRUBISIC,

Intelligence Section, Chicago PD, advised

previously that he

had learned from DAVID STAHL of the Mayor's Office, Chicago,

that they had received

a telephone call, a couple of days ago,

from one WES POMEROY of the U.S. Attorney General's Office,

to the effect that the Attorney General wanted the Chicago

city officials to give every consideration to the granting

of the permits requested by the Yippies.

Sgt. GRUBISIC was unable to comment on the feeling

of the city administration to this request but was of the

opinion that such permits would not be granted as requested.

Sgt. GRUBISIC based his opinion on the fact that four repre-

sentatives of the Yippies, from New York City, had gone to

the office of the Deputy Superintendent of the Chicago PD and

had requested immunity from arrest for all Yippies auring the

convention for crimes around the possession of narcotics.

Yippies stated that any arrest would cause the Yippie community

to cause large scale riots,

and the blame of any riots resulting

from such arrests would fall on the Chicago PD.

These representatives of the Yippies were advised

in no uncertain terms that the laws of the City of Chicago

would be strictly enforced fairly on all persons and that no

one would be granted any immunity

during this period.

The Bureau's attention

is invited to the August 9,

1968, issue of the "Daily World," daily publication of the

communist Party, USA (Ce), Wherein an article appeared on page

one captioned "Rallies Will Ring Demo Convention" written by

CARYL DAVIAU, current member, CP of Illinois, in which the

reporter indicates that the National Mobilization Committee

to End the War in Vietnam,which is working around the clock to

mobilize demonstrations against the convention, has petitioned

the Justice Department to investigate the Chicago Police to

determine if there is any conspiracy to deprive "us" of our

full civil libertles..

Chicago will continue to follow these matters

closely and immediately advise the Bureau, and continue to

disseminate all information of intelligence collected to

interested agencies.

No recommendation is being made nor is Chicago

involving itself in any plans affecting the issuance of the

abovementioned park permit.

As the Bureau is aware, Chicago is in receipt of

information from confidential scirces indicating a potential

for demonstration arising out of the "New Left" calling for

direct confrontation with the Chicago Police Department as a

diversionary tactic for a "crash-in" at the convention site.

Sources have also reported independent action on the part of

individuals to cause some form of "sabotage" activity inside

the convention itself.

Information received from confidential

informants in other divisions indicates attempts on the part

of dissident young people not organizationally affiliated with

the "New Left"

, to hire 50 buses out of New York to bring

¡ demonstrators to Chicago and a caravan of militant Latin

¡ Americans to come from

the Miami, Florida area to Chicago for

the specific purpose of disrupting the Democratic National

Convention.

The Chicago area activists in the Youth International

Party are currently planning a "Festival of Lights" in one of

the parks on Chicago's lakefront during the period of the

Democraiic National Convention.

characterized by Chicago area Vippie leadership as being peaceful

so show America thut there is an alternative to the "festival

of death", or the Democratic National Convention. However,

sources report that there are elements within the Youth Inter-

national Party which are calling for direct confrontation with

the Chicago Police Department during the "Festival of Lights"

There is a very definite indication that more and

more plans are being made by these groups to cause violence and

trouble and undoubtedly this will increase even more as we

approach the time of the convention. I strongly feel that we

must use every possible means at our command to insure that

the Director, the President of the United States and other pertinent

officials are furnished every possible piece of intelligence

information which we can gather from any source.

• I am specifically asking for the services of two

Special Agents who proved during their assignment in Chicago that

they

are expecially well qualified to handle informants and make

contacts in the "New Left" area.

They proved during their

assignments in Chicago that

they have the knowhow, the interest,

the dedication and the personality to be highly successful in

They

fulltime to solicit information

from the leadership of the "New left" concerning their plans

for demonstrations, confrontations and disruptions of the

I am, therefore, urgently requesting that sA WILLIAM

• MANIS, under transer to Anniston, Alabama Resident Agency.,

be assigned on a temporary basis in Chicago for the above stated

purpose from August 15, 1968 through August 31, 1968.

Both

men, while young in years in the Bureau, demonstrated outstanding

judgment and I am convinced that their assignments, as recommended

above, would prove to be most beneficial in carrying out our

responsibilities in connection with the Democratic Convention.

The following is a summary of a five page report,

dated /19/74, furnished by Mary JO Cook,

former EBI

informant.

A meeting of the National Defense Committee of

the VAW/WSO was held on 6/7-9/74 at St. Louis, Missouri.

Eleven identified individuals attended.

The purpose was to ascertain the feasibility

o setting up a National Deiense Committee which would

be operational throughout the United States.

As concerns

VYAW, WSO, the meeting sought to advise members that the

•organization's Defense Committee will take steps to secure

release or acquittals of

any members arrested.

A representative from the National Collective

in Chicago talked about the Gainesville 8 in a dezogatory

manner, implying the Government did not try the Gainesville

8 for purely political reasons, but that the leader and

some others planned some kind of illegai acuivity. He also

said if there had been no Agent provocateur there would

never have been a trial and that the National Collective

would not have permitted violent activity. 17 items

were handed out, a large portion of which

were reprints

from national and "movement" pubiications covering such

topics as how to avoid being questioned by the FBi.

One of these, on jury selection, is attached.

debts showing their basis, when contracted and schedule of

payments. The information received from the field needs to be

further clarified after which time this matter will be discussed

The Birmingham Office has advised that our informant

Gary Thomas Rowe has current outstanding debts in the Birmingham,

area "totaling $2350.03, and the SAC, Birmingham

recommends that these debts be paid by the Bureau in full.

Birmingham points out that Rote has performed

invaluable service to the Bureau in connaction with the case:

¡involving the shooting of Mrs. Viola liuzzo, and his services

have saved the Bureau an untold

amount of Agent manpower and

various expenses connected with an extended major investigation.

They point out that informant has been in protective custody

of the Bureau since 4-1-65, and as such, has not had 2.2

opportunity to be gainfully employed in order to meet various

financial obligations that he has been meeting in the

past.

Birmingham points out that it is absolutely imperative to insure

the possible success of the next trial tentatively scheduled

for September, 1965, that the excellent relationship developed

with Rowe must be retained, and to accomplish this Rowe should

be free as much as possible from the receipt of bills from

various creditors when he is not in a position to make payment.

Birmingham listed outstanding bills of informant

Rowe as follows:

Alabana Power Company

Southern Bell Telephone Company

Memorandum to Mr. Beimont

RE::

EUGENE THOMAS, ET AL

OBSERVATIONS OF GENERAL INVESTIGATIVE DIVISION

The Bureau is currently paying Gary Thomas Rowe

$16.00 per day subsistencin lici of expenses. This figure

was

initially decided upon after discussion with the Departent,

and

with the Department's approval, as it was recognized that

the informant har to be removed from the Birmingham area for

his protection and safety. The Department pointed out that

It would not be desirable to make any lump sum or large

In the trial of subject Collie veroy Wilkins which

began 5-3-65 and resulted in a hung jury, the Bureau was called

upon to produce a recora of payments to the iniormant. In a

future trial, it is reasonable to expect that we wild

again

be

called upon to produce such a record.

The payment of Rowe's

debts a this time amounting to over

two thousand dollars

would appear in this record of payments to Rowe,

and we

certainly could not agree to pay such a large amount at this

" time without the Departnent's approval.

With regard to the debts themselves, it would not

appear from information furnished by Birmingham that they

are

all due and payable immediately, as

the larger debts to the

two banks would probably be payable in monthly installments.

We could, with Department's approval, agree to payment of

his smaller debts and monthly installments on these larger

debts as they come due.

RECOMMENDATION

In view of the above, It is recommended that

Birmingham be instructed to submit a detailed accounting of

Rowe's debts showing their basis, when they were contracted,

due dates and a full breakdown of any installment contracts

showing detailed schedule ot payments.

information, the matter will be discussed with the Department

and their viows as to whether or not payment of these debts

at this time would be judicious, will be obtained. Airtel

On 11/21/75, Inspector John B. Hotis met with Doug

Assistant to the Attorney General, and Michael E. Shaheen, Jr.,

Committee on Interigence activities.

will have a prepared statement which will probably deal with

the future relationship between the Bureau and the Department

and the kinds of contacts needed to prevent abuse of authority.

Mr. Marvin asked that the Bureau provide the following materials,

which will

shan the procan

be used in the preparation of a briefing book for

Mr. Levi's testimony:

(1.)

A general synopsis of major areas of the Bureau

activities that have been investigated by the Senate and House

Select Committees. Mr. Marvin gave as examples; the "Official

and Confidential" files, COINTELPRO, use of informants, and in-

terception of mails. He said the purpose is to identify those

• topics which have been of primary concern to the Committees.

Mr. Marvin asked that the synopses contain a brief statement of

• the Bureau's position on each of.

EX-115 the subjects:

-1155

(2). A general statement concerning the organizational

structure and functions of the FBI, with particular emphasis on

the responsibilities of the Inspection Division.

This should

include a description of how complaints are received, the review

process; and any recent changes in the operations of that Division.

In addition, the Attorney General wants a write-up of all investi-

gations of alleged misconduct presently being conducted by the

Bureau. He is particularly concerned about any incidents. that

may have occurred during Mr. Levi's tenure as Attorney

• General,

such as those

in Richmond, Detroit, and Houston.

RE.:. TESTIMONY. BY THE ATTORNEY GENERAL BEFORE THE

SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES

(3). A history of Congressional oversight of the Bureau.

Mr. Marvin asked that we identify those Subcommittees of Congress

which have exercised some oversight responsibilities over the

Bureau.

In particular, he asked that we review appropriations

testimony going back

to 1955 to determine whether we discussed

topics which are presently of concern to the Select Committees.

This will be very useful in demonstrating Congressional aware-

ness of these matters: He also asked that we furnish a statement

of the Director's position concerning Congressional oversight

which he has previously. expressed in speeches or testimony

before Congress:

by the Bureau, specifying in each case whether we seek Depart-

mental approval.. The more obvious examples are electronic

surveillance, use of body recorders, pen registers; informants;

A list of any formal or informal proposals which have

been made concerning organizational changes of the FBI.

Examples

are the creation of an Inspector General's Office in the Depart-

men't or elsewhere having review authority over the FBI, transfer

of counterintelligence functions to another agency or the creation

of a separate: Division within the Bureau for that function, trans-

fer of drug enforcement responsibilities to the Bureau, and the

proposed statutory limitation on the term of the office for the

Director.

It should be noted that several position papers concern-

ing such topics were prepared at the request of former Acting

Director I. Patrick Gray which might be useful in responding to

this request..

Although no date has been set for the Attorney General's •

testimony, it is expected that he will testify after Mr. Kelley's

appearance on 12/9/75. In view of the limited time available,

Mr. Marvin asked that

we expedite the preparation of these

materials and furnish

them to his office as soon as they are

completed.

It is requested that these materials be submitted

to the Office of Congressional Affairs, when completed, but no

later than cob, Friday, 11/28/75:. They should be submitted in

insert form suitable for inclusion in a letterhead memorandum.

This will confirm our conversation on

November 26, 1975, wherein you authorized the Bureau

to use a videotape recording of your "live" telecast

concerning the appearance of Deputy Associate Director

James 3. Adams before the Church committee. You

indicated that this was authorized for the exclusive

viewing by FBI personnel.

This is to advise you that the videotape

of Mr. Adams' testimony is being restricted solely

to FBI personnel.

We certainly appreciate your

consideration in

this regard.

With respect to the excisions in materials being

monitored during electronic surveillances of King.

In some

there exist areas where documentation of the information is not

Dear Mike:

As a follow-up to our briefing of issistant Director

Wannall

on November 6 concerning our proposed format and

witnesses

for public hearings on December 4-5 on the FBI's

use of intelligence informants and sources, we would like

to make the following requests.

As discussed in our meeting with Mr: Wannall, we in-

vite the Bureau to submit a memorandum on its intelligence

informant and source program that could be inserted in

the record of the testimony of Bureau representatives at

the hearing.

This memorandum would enable the Bureau to-

present to the Select Committee a complete description

; of its program and to discuss the

issues of particular

These include, for

example, l) the size, scope and purpose of the program,

including an assessment of the program's cost and effective-

and the distinctions and relationships between the

intelligence informant program and the Bureau's criminal

informant activity; 2) the criteria that determine when

an informant may be used in an organization or group; and

3) the program's command and control system, including the

limits that are placed on the activities of informants

and the type of information an informant or source is per-

mitted to report to his handling agent and the Bureau.

"the memorandum would discuss possible leg-

islation in the informant area, such as the imposition

of a warrant requirement or additional administrative re-

view.

To permit the Select Comnittee members to study this

memorandun in advance of the hearing and to discuss it

with FBI representatives during their testimony at the pub

lic hearing,

we request

by November 24.

o Relaunde

that. the memorandum be submitted

Also I am enclosing requests for documents relating

to two of the three former FBI informants who are scheduled

to testify on December 4.

These requests supplement our

document request of August 20, 1975 pertaining to informants

(Part IV-4).

In addition, we wish to interview and possibly de-

pose the Special Agents who handl^d the three former in-

formants (Rowe, Hardy and Cook) who are scheduled to

testify at the public hearing on December 4.

Because of

the limited time remaining before the scheduled hearings,

we request: that the Special Agents be made: available for

interviews

and depositions as soon as possible.

Director Sec'y

On 11/25/75, John T. Elliff, Task Force Director of

the Domestic Intelligence Task Force for the Senate Select Com-

mittee, requested the Bureau designate a witness to appear in

executive session before the senate select committee on 12/3_0r

I2/4 in the afternoon to discuss counterintelligence

• investi-

gations by. the Bureau.

i Elliff stated because of Chairman Frank

Church's interest in a study as to whether counterintelligence

investigations should be taken out of the FBI and placed in

another agency or a separate component of the Justice Department,

this particular topic would be the main focal point of the hear-

ing.

Elliff stated that the questions asked of the Bureau's

witness would deal primarily with the feasibility of removal of

counterintelligence out of the FBI including problems of a

logistical and practical nature resulting from such a change.

Elliff asked that he be advised as to the identity of the

Bureau

witness as soon as possible.

Inasmuch as the aforementioned topic is a question of

Shaheen, Jr., Special Counsel for Intelligence Coordination in the

Department,

• is aware of the aforementioned testimony and the pos-

sibility exists that

the Department may make a decision with

regards. to the Bureau's providing a witness concerning this

matter.

John I. Elliff, Domestic Task Force Director of thector So'y-

Senate Select Committee, advised at 9:15 a.m. on 12/3/75 that

the following is a statement to be read by Senator Frank

Church

of that Committee on 12/3/75.

Attorney General Kennedy authorized wiretaps in

1962 on New York Times reporter Hanson Baldwin and his

secretary and that lasted for about one month. In addition

to the wiretap on New York Times reporter Hanson Baldwin in ‹

1962, the Committee has received materials from the FBI re-

flecting authorization by Attorney General Kennedy of a

wiretap on a reporter for Newsweek Magazine in 1961 during

the investigation of another leak of classified information.

Further materials reflected authorization by Attorney General

Nicholas Katzenbach for a wiretap on the editor of an anti-

Communist newsletter in 1965, also during the investigation

of a leak of classified information.

The Committee has received

materials from the FBI reflecting authorization by Attorney

General Robert F. Kennedy of wiretaps on at least six American

citizens, including three Executive Branch officials, a Con-

gressional Staff Member, and two registered lobbying agents

for foreign interests.

The materials also reflect that these

wiretaps relate to an investigation of agents by foreign in-

terests to influence United States economic policies.

N

Elliff was advised by SA Paul V. Daly of this Division

that an impression would be created by the aforementioned statement

that this Bureau may have conducted an electronic surveillance on

Capitol Hill and that this, of course, was inaccurate.

The elec-

tronic surveillance concerning the Congressional Staff Member was

not located on Congressional property.

Elliff agreed with this

observation and indicated that he would check the material to

insure the electronic surveillance in question was not on Con-

gressional property and as agreed, make a change in the afore-

mentioned statement.
