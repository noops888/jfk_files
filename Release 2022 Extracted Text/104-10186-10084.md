groups of agents, is expected to do upon returning to his native
country and TORRES arranges a training schedule which will prepare
each individual for his assignment; he decides how many hours of :
instruction éach trainee will have and in what subjects. In addition,
he arranges the schedules of the instructors in the various schools
and handles the overall administration for them. TORRES does not

works particularly close with the Venezuelan desk officers and has
relatively less to do with other LN Department operations officers.1
