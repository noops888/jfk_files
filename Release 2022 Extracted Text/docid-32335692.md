declined to interview by parole

authoritios

On 3/17/64, ELLSWORTH advised MASEN is still await-

ing trial and MASEN's trial will probably commence about the

first of May,

1964.

Patrolman PRESTON SNOGA, Irving, Texas,

PD, was con-

at his residence, 2517 Dewitt Street, Irving,

and

fur'-

nished the following information

• to SA WIEHL

on 2/11/64:

SNOGA advised he had known JOHN MASEN

since approxi

this acquaintanceship had furnished information

concerning

MASEN's activities to ATTU, Dallas, Texas.

MASEN's activities;

he advised, included changing semi-automatic weapons to fully

automatic weapons. He advised MASEN is strictly in the gun

business for the

money he can make.

MASEN 1s full of a lot of

"big talk" which he never substantiated.

MASEN told SNOGA he

had been contacted by Cuban revolutionists for the purpose of

supplying guns and ammunition.

MASEN also advised him that

"Minutemen"

'and John Birchers in the Dallas area had contacted

him for the purpose of buying ammunition.

MASEN never mentioned

the names or locations of these individuals. MASEN never advised

SNOGA that he was himself a member of a John Birch Society or

"'Minutemen""

..It was

SNOGA's impression that MASEN was not a

member of either of these organizations, 1f, in fact, he was im

contact with them.

This impression

based primarily on the

fact that MASEN was more interested

In money than in political

beliefs.

On 2/28/64, SA JAMES P. HOSTY, IR. conducted the

following investigation:

DONALD G. KIMP advised that he had no further informa
