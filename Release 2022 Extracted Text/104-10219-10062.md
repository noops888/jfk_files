DATE OF INFORMATION: June 1968 - January 1975

1. Following his move from Leningrad to Moscow in June 1968,
Source met Aleksandr Aleksanrovich ROZINKIN, a translator who works
for a number of Soviet publishing houses in Moscow but actually
does his translation work at his residence (address: Moscow 452,
be Balaklavskiy Prospekt, House No. 4, Korpus No. 5, Apartment No. 353;
home phone number: 110-2311). ROZINKIN's father is Jewish and his i
! mother is Great Russian: ROZINKIN graduated from the Moscow State i
7 Pedagogical Institute of Foreign Languages imeni Maurice Thorez in
7 1956 or 1957, traveled to Australia in connection with a one-year
3 assignment as an interpreter attached to the Soviet antarctic :

expedition, and traveled abroad to at least one other foreign i id
country (location unknown by Source). He was married twice. His .
first wife (name unknown to. Source) bore him a son and his second
(named Lena Inu) gave birth-to a daughter. Although he is still
married to Lena, ROZINKIN does-not reside with her and the daughter.
ROZINXIN loves his daughter and frequently visits her at his wife's
residance located in the area of. the Preobrazhenskaya metro station
in Hoscow, ROZINKIN had a mistress named Galina Sergeyevna ZHIRKOVA
(refer to SX-28663, dated 14 April 1976, for data on ZHIRKOVA) who
worked as a typist at the Higher Diplomatic School and was scheduled
to be assigned PCS in 1975 to a Soviet embassy in an unidentified
foreign country. 2 E ies

2. ROZINKIN expressed anti-Soviet regime attitudes to Source -
“and to other friends, and indicated he-had thought in principle of we
emigrating, but stated he did not wish to leave his daughter. Although
he complained about Soviet propaganda and about 1i

opinion. On one occaston in about January 1970 or 1971, Source
approached an American official -in the restricted parking area of
the Luzhniki Palace of Sports in Moscow - Source obtained a special :
pass and parking permit from a friend in order to observe boxing. i : H
matches, and while parking his car noticed what appeared to be an

American official car being driven by a foreigner. (Source claimed
that he already had thoughts of wanting to leave the Soviet Union

and hoped the American could help or parhaps provide. some suggestions.
It should be noted, however, that Source was in at least semi-official
contact during this time frame with a KGB officer naned Lev
Mikhaylovich GAYRILIN who reportedly was involved in operations
against American Embassy personnel.) During the brief conversation u
which was held in English, the American official mentioned that he :
was the assistant to the American Military Attache, replied to

| Source's queries that Source's only chance of leaving the USSR would
i be through approved TOY or tourist travel, gave Source a calling

i card (Source could not recall} the American's name), and suggested .
| that Source phone him the next day. Source mentioned the encounter i i i
i to ROZINKIN and on the following day ROZINKIN and Source phoned the

1 American from a public phone booth. (In actuality, ROZINKIN spoke

: to the American during the telephone conversation because he was

j considerably more fluent in the English language than Source.) The

American merely stated that there was nothing he could add to his i
previous statements and the telephone conversation was terminated. :
Source described the American as taller than average, having a thin ‘|
face and perhaps light colored hair; Source was uncertain of the i
latter because the American wore a hat at the time of the initial
contact, ROZINKIN had occasional contact with foreigners in Hoscow
and reportedly had lengthy correspondence with an Australian national.
When questioned about the aforementioned correspondence and probable
Soviet knowledge of it, Source commented that ROZINKIN might have
been "hooked" by the KGB.

3. In approximately 1972 ROZINKIN introduced Source to an
‘ American defector named fnu MARTIN at the. latter's apartment in ‘one
of only two high-rise apartment buildings located on the southeast
corner of the Obrucheva Akademika Ulitsa - Leninskiy Prospekt
intersection in Moscow. Source visited MARTIN together with
ROZINKIN on one other occasion during the same year. The front door
to MARTIN's apartment had at least several locks. The apartment
oe itself, consisting of two rooms, had unidentified. security devicas,
according to ROZINKIN who related to Source most of the information
reported below. MARTIN, who had stereo equipment and played music
during the two. brief encounters, allegedly would not permit anyone
into his apartment without receiving an advance phone call. He
had some capability in the Russian language and reportedly was not
married at that time, Based on what ROZINKIN mentioned, MARTIN,
during his early years in Moscow, surrounded himself with prostitute...
and black marketeers who often visited his apartment, aad had been
treated in a Soviet psychiatric clinic at one time. He later became
suspicious of people and frightened of possibly being apprehended

o “or harmed by American authorities and therefore curtailed his social

activities and became cautious in inviting visitors to his
apartment. No impertant or interesting Soviets associated with
him on a social basis. He allegedly consumed large amounts of
alcohol and usually was found in a rotten mood. ROZINKIN stated
that MARTIN received 500 rubles per month from the Soviet
authorities and had been assigned to work at the Institute of
Hathematics imeni Steklova, but actually did not work there.
: ROZINKIN also remarked once that MARTIN indicated he felt he made

é a mistake in defecting to the Soviets and regretted it. Reportedly,
E MARTIN has had contacts with foreign diplomats in Moscow-and in

this connection ROZINKIN stated that a Swedish diplomat offered

his assistance to spirit MARTIN out of the Soviet Union, apparently

through the use of a diplomatic vehicle. MARTIN, as Source was told,
‘declined the offer because he was afraid that the Americans would

get ahold of him once he left the USSR.

4. Source claimed he did not know the reason for ROZINKIN'S
association with MARTIN and only guessed that ROZINKIN may have been
involved in obtaining translation work for MARTIN. Relative to this,
however, Source stated it was his (Source's) impression that MARTIN
had no interest in seeking any form of employment. As concerned
Source's relationship with ROZINKIN, in the fall of 1973 ROZINKIN ~
became miffed at Source's one-time il) treatment of him (ROZINKIN)
during a petty incident and the friendship dissolved at that time.
They did not see each other after the incident and ROZINKIN did not
bid farewell to Source at the time of the latter's emigration fron
the Soviet Union. Source did not know ROZINKIN's friends well, but
did state that ROZINKIN was a very close friend of Yuriy pnu SHIROKOV
{a translator/interpreter who had studied at the Moscow Institute of
International Relations, is the son of a Soviet diplomat, and has a
good capability in the English language).
