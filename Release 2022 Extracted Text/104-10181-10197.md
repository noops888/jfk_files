auts in exile, for the most part Uving in San Juan, but
with gome representatives.in New-York and Miam!. Ut is

States Government Lf it will serve their best interests, how-
ever, with or without United States Government coordination
and/or support they intend to go ahead with their plans.

This organization does need more money and equipment

for future cperations which may have to wait until they can
get the resources that they need. Their criticism to date

of all other Cuban exile groups is that they have wanted
power, money, and position, Because this group wants
none of these, except supplies and cash to get their harrass-
ment projects underway, they are, therefure, only tell-

ing what they-must lo convince interested helpers of their
serigusness and intent and will disclose only what they

- must of their plans to asgure them success of this purely

aggressive, retaliatory, harrassment organization, They
claim they want nothing to do with the student group organ-
ization which recently shelled Habuna. As ex-CPA'‘s their
very businesslike manner requires them to give receipts
for any funds received for help.

c. They now have enough supplies to carry out their
first operation successfully and maybe one other. The
organization purchased these supplies in Europe to avoid
being identified with strictly United States support and
endorsement. They have approximately $30, 000.00 wluch
they coliected {rom private, business subscribers, but
obviously need mure to go ahead after the first attack, At
the prevent time they have one-buat, but need more for
future operations. They plan to use six to ten men per
operation, and all of their training has 50 far teen carried
out in Puerto Rico. According to their contact man in New
York, one of their first operations 1s to blow up ail the A
power stations in Cuba.

d, Their personnel in the executive or lade rstup

phase as well, are as followe:
