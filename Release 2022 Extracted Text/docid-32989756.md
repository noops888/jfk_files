A review of the flight schedules of both airlines

revealed that it would be impossible to take a flight

at 2:22 A.M., on the following day. She indicated

that

anything departing

Louisville or Washington would necessitate a lay over until

the following morning, that is after 8:00 A.M. to get a

flight into Roanoke.

She expressed the possibility

that a flight to Wash., D.C., then a bus to Roanoke would

possibly put an individual in Roanoke at 2:22.

If not already done,

that Richmond at Roanoke identify flights arriving in

HAROLO GALLONAY, ALtOn POLiCe Department, were re-contacea

regarding the identity of JIM NEVILLE.

They advised that they

had been unable to develop any information concerning this

individual's identity. GALLOWAY advised that WILLIAN GENE

COATNEY, 215 Dorris,

Alton, Illinois, is apparently making

an effort to keep out of trouble with the police and that he

might be cooperative if interviewed. Since COATNEY is supposed

to have been involved with JIM NEVILLE in captioned bank robbery,

according to informant information, it is possible that he might

be able to identify NEVILLE. It is left to the discretion of

the Case Agent as to whether COATNEY should be interviewed at

this time.
