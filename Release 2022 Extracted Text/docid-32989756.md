close association with RUSSELL EUGENE BRIDDLE, FBI #198 3717,

Kansas, on 4/28/69 and from that time he is believed to have
resided in the St. Louis area under various aliases.’ St. Louis

Re SI airtel to SL, 11/5/69.

Miss P, OLIVASTRO, Ticket Agent, Eastern
Airlines, St. Louis, Municipal Airport on 1/9/70,
advised that any flights departing from SL to Roanoke,
Va., would only be possible through TWA and Eastern
Airlines. These flights would not be direct but would
have to go to either Louisville or Wash., D.C., to make
appropriate connections, A switch would be necessary from
either of the above-mentioned airlines to Piedmont Airlines.

A review of the flight schedules of both airlines
revealed that it would be impossible to take a flight
from SL subsequent to 8:00 P.M., and be in Roanoke, Va.,
at 2:22 A.M,, on the following day. She indicated that
anything departing SL subsequent to 5:00 P.M., for
Louisville or Washington would necessitate a lay over until
the following morning, that is after 8:00 A.M, to get a
flight into Roanoke, She expressed the possibility
that a flight to Wash., D.C.,then a bus to Roanoke would
possibly put an individual in Roanoke at 2:22.

If not already done, SI may want to consider
that Richmond at Roanoke identify flights arriving in
Roanoke during the late evening hours from Wash., D.C.,
or Louisville for any information reflecting WAYNE ELMER

On 2/23/72, Detective DONALD SANDIDGE and Detective
HAROLD GALLOWAY, Alton Police Department, were re-contaced
regarding the identity of JIM NEVILLE. They advised that they
had been unable to develop any information concerning this
individual's identity. GALLOWAY advised that WILLIAI GENE
COATNEY, 215 Dorris, Alton, Illinois, is apparently making
an effort to keep out of trouble with the police and that he
might be cooperative if interviewed. Since COATNEY is suppesed
to have been involved with JIM NEVILLE in captioned bank robbery,
according to informant information, it is possible that he might
be able to identify WEVILLE. It is left to the discretion of
the Case Agent as to whether COATNEY should be interviewed at

he is supposed to be living in the Peoria, Yllinois area
and is possibly connected with prostitutes in that area.

COATNEY advised that if someone had named him
{COATNEY) as being involved in a bank robbery it ig possible
that the individual had him confused with a BILL COATES
who lives in Alton. He stated that the police have
cecasionally pulled him in for questioning when they had

have robbed a bank in southeastern Missouri about three
years ago. COATNEY believes that WHITE may have also been
involved in robbery of azbank in upper Alten.
