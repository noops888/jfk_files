II. Politios:

Ao In fugust of 1957 it was

reported thet. the Cormaniat woul

attempt to penetrato the Partido Accion Renovadora (FAR) tr

such an oxtint that they would have cuntrol, whereby they could

elect Communists to tho National Assemuly.

The Communists did

Infiltrate PAR, but they became so rumorous and so vociferous

that the members of PAR finally realised what had happened and

printed leafluts dennouncing the Communists within the Party.

PAR practically dissolved theroafter and again the Communists

waro left without a political front group.

The Comminiats dur

ing this time did a lot of talking and planning, but thoy admit

tod that it was difficult "undor the OSORIO regime" to make pol-

Itical strides, but that they were making great advances in the

labor movement. It can be written that the Communists' Parsy to-

day has had no success in either astabliahing itself as a strong

political force nor has it buun able to use another political par

ty as lta tool.

MENEZ Barrios has lost his position with the uni-

versity and has been roplaced by a adamarit anti-commnist sulio..

FALSTO FERNANDEZ iS probably Salvadorfs

most intelloctual Corumist. He recently returned from Chile

where he was Counselor in the Salvadoran Ambassy. He was accused

of smuggling in tax-free cigarettes and stealing government doc-

unents.

Upon his return to Salvador he vindicated himself with

both the Foreign Ministor and the Prosident. On 31 January, 1953

FAUSTO FERNANDEZ spoke at the National University at which time

he dinnounced Hamdam and declared that he had raturned to the

Catholic faith. The consensus of opinion among Communists, stu-

dents, the Army, and the Priests is that he, FAUSTO FERNANDEZ,

has not renounced Camnunism, but is using another tactic (and the

only one that would per.it him to remain in the good graces of the

Government) to further the Conmunist cause. On or about 16 Feb-

i Juary, 1953 thure appeared on the streets a clandestine Communist

In cumation, the PCS 1a inoffectivo as a political force at

the prasent time. It has not been a political force in the

last twenty years, but 1t hasspade progress in labor matters

and probably at one time controlled more than one half of the

syndioatus.

This 18 no longet true, however, and the PCS has

lost most of 1ts influonce among labor by a strong goverrment

polloy againgt Communism.

In acidttion, anti-Communist propa-

ganda, by both the lovernment and private interesta, has been

effective in waning labor away from Communist influence.

The now policy of the PCS is to to be less overt and moro

clandostino.

The PCS alma to "plant" 1 to members in atrategic

unions and govorment officos, to "cooperate», and to avalt

the opportune time baforo they announce thenselves as Commnists.

Is appaars that tha PCS 1a almoat complotoly dependent upon the

Communist Party of Quatanala for 1ta Instruations and directives,

consequently the suocosa or failuro of the Communisto in duate
