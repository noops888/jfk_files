dmorica coming into El Salvador from (vatemala. ‘ore prop-
aganda was discovered on both the train, in brucks and auto~
mobiles and on suspicious persons entering Yd Salvador from
both Guatemala and Honduras, In the sumer of 1952 the Cov-
ernment began to inspect the baggage of exiled Salvadoran
Cormunists who were landing at ILopango airport intransit to
Guatemala, In this faehion they discovered and consficated
Commnist pins, leaflets, books films (Bd films printed by
Peiping), addressed, etc., from Salvadorans treveling to Con-
munist, China and Commnist Europe on Guatemalan passports.

One week after President OSORTO and President ARBENZ ‘of Guate-
mala mat on the common border, Prosidént OSORIO declared a
"gtate of Seige” at which time he arrested about two hundred
"Commnist" in the Capital city of El Salvador and about a
“thousand” throvghout the country. He deported 18 Commnists
to Costa Rica and kept another forty or fifty in jail. The
Government had published"Communist Party Plans for the over=
throw of the Government* with photographs of grenades, rifles,
pistols, mimeograph machines, etc. purportedly found in the
homes of various Conmunist leadera, Neither the Party Plans |
nor the amount of ams appeared to the undersign = nor to other
kmbassy Officials - authentic, logical, sufficient, and danger=
ous enough to warrant the State of Siege. It appeardd to be
Géuernment propaganda aimed at explaining its actions to the
mass of people. It is believed that the real reason for the
Governments action was tho fear of the future if Commnist
propaganda was contimed.

The background for today's situations vis a vis the Com
munist Party of El Salvador, must include certain political, »
military,and economic facts. President OSORIO is politically _
acutes he io sincere; ho is progressive and desires greater i
denocracy for his country.which he realises ie dependent upon
greater literecy and educations OSORIO has permitted the growth
‘and the ereatdon of other political parties, but no other pol-
itdcal party threatens tho etrenght of the President's party
Partido Revoluoionario do Union Democgatica, The Amy isa com
pletely loyal to the President and if there are political mach-
dnatéione within tho Amy thoy are in the form of plans for the
nomination and election of their respective cartidates in the
elections to ba held in 199. The Amy, itself has various
political cliques within it, tut to the beat of our knowledge
ell oliques give OSORTO: their full support. Keonomically, the
country 4s very sound with a high degree of employment and wages
dnoreaping. In view of strong economy and a stable anti-Com-
munist Governemt the Commnist Party of Bl Salvador finds very
few oracke in tho political wll in which to offectively place
their propaganda wedges.

Ife Politics:

In August of 1951 it was reported thet, the Cormunigt would
attempt to penetrate the Partido Accion Renovadora R) to
suoh an extent that they would have control, whereby they could
Slect Commniste to the National Assembly, ‘The Communists did
infiltrate PAR, but they became so mmerous and so vociferous
that the members of PAH finally realized what had happened and
printed leaflcts dennouncing the Communists within the Party.
PAR practically dissokved thereafter and again the Communists
were left without a political front group. The Communists dure
ing this time did a lot of talking and planning, but’thoy admit~
ted that it was difficult "under the OSORIO regime" to make pol-
itdcal strides, but that they were making great advgfges in the
labor movement. It can be written that the Commnis$ Party to-
day has had no success in either establishing itself os a strong
political foree nor has it been able to use another’ poligical par-
ty as ite tool.

Within the Government, the /linistry of Labor and the Ministry of
Culture and Education are frequently attacked for harboring Com-
munists. It hasbeen reported at various times that Renaldo
GALINDO PHL, Minister of Culture and Education is e Communist.
Quan Bosch, the Dominican Commnist is eupposed to have called
GALINDO a "reliable comrade.” Presidnet OSORIO is reportedly
aware of GALINDO'S political beliefs, but disregards then since
they are friends and GALINDO ia not knowingly plotting against
OSORIO. The President also belioves that GALINDO can be well
tyatohed" where he ie and that to discharge him or exile him would
ake him nore dangeroue. GALINDO is also accused of creating the

plotely under the control of the Comminist Party, There was

no doubt. And it was immediately seitad at the time the State

of Siege was declared, ‘The Co ‘munigts Students have been since

exiled, jailed, and/or removed from any influence in student

circles. JUHENKZ Barrios nas lost his pesition with the Uni-

babes and has been replaced by a adamant anti-Commnist. Julio -

the Scholl of Humanities. ANSTO FERNANDEZ is probably Salvador{s
most intelloctual Communist, We recently returned from Chile
where he was Counselor in thu Salvadoran Hmbassy. He was accused
of smuggling in tax-free cigarrettes and stealing government doce
uments, Upon his return to Salvador he vindicated himself with
both the Foreign winister and the President. On 31 January, 1953
FAUSTO FERNANDEZ spoke at the National University at which time
he @:nnounced Marxism and declared that he had returned to the
Catholic faith. The consensus of opinion among Communists, stu-
dente, “he Army, and the Priests ie that he, FAUSTO FERNANDEZ,
jas nob renounced Comaunism, but is using another tactic (and the
only one that would pervit him to remain in tha good graces of the
Governnent) to further the Conmmnist cause. On or about 16 Feb=-

, ruary, 1993 thore appoared on the streets a clandestine Commnist
leaflet, which is believed by several sources to have been written
by FANSTO FERNANDEZ, It can be said that at the present FAUSTO
HERNANDEZ is being discreet and only the future will prove or dis-
prove his own statements.

D. In the Ministry of Labor, the Communists appoar to have had some=

11 known, it was just as dangerous. The Minister Mario Hector >

the labor leaders by the Communist, But without his knowlodge
that he is a creature of the Commmist. One report states that
GALINDO POHL is behind the rise of JJLE. At any rate, he has
become an important labor figure ofer night. Labor unions and
their individual members are now more cooperative with the Min-
ister of Labor and-with government policy than they have been in
the past. Several unions. have lost their Commnists directors
through elections which were held throughtout November and Dec-
ember. The rank and file members of the unions have been made
aware of Communism by means of Government action and a strong
Propaganda campaign; consequently, it is knwon that Labor, in
its newly acquired political consciousness has given its support
to the Governnent.

TV. Propaganda

Communist propaganda is neglible. Since the State of Siege was
declared the 27th of September, 1952 there have been enly two
instances in vhich commnist propaganda has appeared on thestreets
of San Salvador. In both cases the propaganda was mimeographed
and did not appear to have a large circulation as persona _re-
ceiving such propaganda were difficult to find (not even GUULAR
could find a copy among hie Communist friends) and there wereOz
no editorial coments on the appearance of the propaganda, The
Law in Defense of the Constitution passed by tha Kstional Assembly
in December, 1952 makes it illegal to be a C st, to partie
cipate in any Communist activity, or to work on of Commun-
iem in any manner. This law and the fairly rigid’ cation of
it by the Government has undoubtedly deterred many: fren pronoting
in any fashion Communist propag: «(The Govortment has in the
past failed to recognised the right of Habeus Corpus in those cases
of jailed Communists). i

Recently there have been two newspaper articles which may have been
Commnist inspired but this is pure speculation end nothing more.The
ario de Ocoidente of Santa Ana which ie edited ty ons Alfredo. —>

an article that the United States Marines had lendad in Guatemala
to protect the United Fruit Company. No oource ar bysline wae given.
Another article published by several of the newspapers but which

Summary

Ae

Be

Ce

In cumastion, the PCS ia ineffective as a political force at
the present time. It has not been a political force in the
last twenty years, but it haegmade progress in labor matters
and probably at one time controlled more than one half of the
syndicates. This is no lon; true, however, and the PCS has
lost most of its influence among labor by a strong government
policy against Commnism. In acdttion, anti-Commnist propa-
ganda, by both the Government and private interests, has been
effective in weaning labor away from Commnist influence.

The new policy of the PCS is to to be less overt and more
clandestine. The PCS aims to “plant” its members in strategic
unions and governnent officer, to “cooperate”, and to await

the opportune tima before they announce themeelves as Communists.
Ib appears that the PCS is almost completely dependent upon the
Communist Party of Guatemala for ita inetructions and directives;
consequently the success or failure of the Communists in duate-
mala will determine the futero policies of the PCS. (This is
also the belief and the fear of the Salvadoran Government).

The PCS wll produce anti-US propaganda at every opportunity,

bat at the present thoy have no organ of propaganda and the two
leafleta they have produced since September, 1952 are consider-

od ineffective. The people of El Salvador appear to completely
support President OSORIO whom they recognise as dedicated to in-
creasing wagos, raising the standard of living, granting better
education, and obtaining better food and living quarters for all
Clasves of workers. In addition, the Covernmont hae made it clear
that the threat of Communism comes from Guatemala which has made ITs
enti-Commnist propaganda quite effective.
