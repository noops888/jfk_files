MEMORANDUM FOR RECORD

SUBJECT: "Alpha 66"

FROM: EPIDEMIC (C)

CONFIDE

The following was translated from a written report from COUTIN (P),

DUJ 315, to SCHILLER received 15 October 1962:

in the afternoon of Saturday, 13 October 1962, I had a meeting with

Rene DECHART, whose phone number is FR 34369 and who belongs to the or

ganization of Eloy GUTIERREz Menoy (Second Front of the Escambray) We

conversed for more than an hour and a half. The following points of inter-

est were brought to light:

Lo The organization "Alpha 66" is a front for the Second Front of

the Escambray (Segundo Frente del Escambray) whose leader is Menoyo.

2.. After"Alpha 66"conducts one more operation, it will publicly state

that even though it was crediting the operations to "Alpha oo", the truth

Is that the authors of the deeds performed by "Alpha 66", were and are per-

sonnel of the Second Front of the Escambray.

3. Jose: Antonio VECIANA, who is the treasurer of "Alpha 66", is aloo

the treasurer of the Second

Front of the Escambray.

Rene DECHART was the person who introduced VECIANA to the Second

Front of the Escambray®

5. Eloy GUTIERREZ Menoyo, has definitely left US territory. He is

presently located at a place near the island of Cuba with more than 40 men

and is awaiting a propitious moment to infiltrate to the Escambray mountains

(Las Villas Province). He will attempt to consolidate the counter-revolu

tionaries in the Escambray and so doing, will establish a Provisional Gov

ernment. He has purchased weapons in the US but has shipped them out of

US territory. They have 2500 rations and first aid equipment sufficient

to provide themselves with adequate supplies for an extended period of time.

6. They have trained six radio-telegraph operators including GUTIERREZ.

The radio-telegraph instruction was given by a Cuban refugee named Teodoro

TEJEDA Setien

They have a very powerful radio transmitter and the most

modern communications equipmento

020710d

..To. They have designated Armando FLEITAS as a representative of the

Second Front and given him the job of collecting financial contributions.

FLEITAS will also assist in coordinating all matters related to the organ-

ization.

out by eight men. This operation was conducted with the assistance of cons

tacts within Cuba. He (DECHART) also told me and gave me details of the

attack on the boats at Caibrien,

, Las Villas Province, 10 September 1962.

DECHARI told me that there (CAIBARIN), one of the two frogmen almost

drowned when they attempted to attacks a bomb to the hull of one of the boats

and that the bomb could not be attached. As a consequence they had to attack

openly.
