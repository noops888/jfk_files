FROM: EPIDEMIC (t}

The following was translated from a written report from COUTIN (P),
DUJ 315, to SCHILLER received 15 October.19628

In the afternoon of Saturday, 13 October 1962, I had a meeting with
Rene DECHART, whose phone number is FR 3-4369 and who belongs to the or- '
ganization of Eloy GUTIERREZ Menoy (Second Front of the Escambray). We
conversed for more than an hour and a half, The following points of inter-
est. were brought to light:

1. The organization "Alpha 66" is a front for. the Second Front of
the Escambray. (Segundo Frente del Escambray) whose leader is Menoyoo

2.. After"Alpha 66"conducts one more operation, it will publicly state
that even though it was crediting the operations to "Alpha 66", the truth
is that the authors of the deeds performed by "Alpha 66", were “and are per=
sonnel. of the Second Front of the Escambray. aad

3. .Jose Antonio VECIANA, who is the treasurer of "Alpha 66", is also
the treasurer of the Second Front of the Escambray.

4. Rene DECHART was the person who introduced VECIANA to the Second
Front of the Escambray.

5. Eloy GUTIERREZ Menoyo, has definitely left US territory. He is
presently located at a place near the island of Cuba with more than 0 men
and is awaiting a propitious moment to infiltrate to the Escambray mountains
(Las Villas Province), He will attempt to consolidate the counter-revolu-
tionaries‘in the Escambray. and so doing, will establish a Provisional Gov- |
ernment. He has purchased weapons in the US but has shipped them out of |
US territory, They have 2500 rations and first aid equipment sufficient !
to provide themselves with adequate supplies for an extended period of time.

6. They have trained six radio~telegraph operators including GUTIERREZ.

TEJEDA Setien, They have a very powerful radio transmitter and the most i
modern. communications equipment, a :

out by eight men. This operation was conducted with the assistance of con=
tacts within Cuba, He (DECHART) also told me and gave me details of the
attack on the boats at Caibrien, Las Villas Province, 10 September 1962.
DECHART told me that there (CAIBAREEN), one of the two frogmen almost
drowned when they attempted to attack a bomb to the hull of one of the boats

and that the bomb could not be attached. As a consequence, they had to attack
openly. “
