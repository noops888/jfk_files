ANSELMO sonrou ané VICTOR VICENTE,
mentioned H@rein in connectTon with information regarding
the Cuban ilission to the UN raising $60 for an FPCC
mailing of an announcement that’'an FPCC picket
demonstration woyld be held on 10/8/62, are subjects

of NY files 13446626) ad 13-59U, respectively. (3)

The CubaneAmerican Civil Rights, (mene shea:
herein, is the subject of NY file 1105-56134 and the
Bureau has been made cognizant of results of investigation
to date in this case.

DOROTHY W, DOUGLAS, mentioned herein,is
subfect of NY file (0~122751 and Bufile 100-355436,
Investigation reflects that DOUGLAS wrote a check
payable to IYLE STUART in the amount of $2,000 and
the’ day after STUART deposited this check in-his
bank o.F860., fin 00 wrote a check for $2,000 payable

to the FPCC, In connection with DOUGLAS, it is

to be noted tht her file reflects DOUGLAS disclosed
to a source in March, 1962, that she had made several
trips to Czechoslovakia in the past.and hoped to make
another trip in the«summer of 1962, It is possible
DOUGLAS may have been-instrumental in channeling the
two deposits of $5,000 and $5,500, all in $100 bills,
into the FPCC bank account in April, 1961, inasmuch
as there was some indication that these $100 bills
might have come from a source in Czechoslovakia,

It is to be noted that investigation
reflects that the "Cuban Press. Survey" is being
y the Translation Bureau of the NY Chapter
of the FPCC and that henceforth, a review of this
publication will be reported in that file.

Investigation of DANIEL JUSTIN BERNSTEIN
(NY file 105-51763, Bufile 105-103763) nas not developed
any additional pertinent inforiiation which would indicate
that funds from the Cuban Government are being channeled
through BERNSTEIN into the FPCC nor has there been
any further indication that BERNSTEIN has advanced
additional money to the FPCC,

It is to be noted that RICHARD GIBSON's
offer of his services to the FBI and/or CIA for
financial reimbursement is set forth in the interview
of GISSON, inasmuch as the Bureau and CIA made a
determination not to use GIBSON's services. The purpose ts
in setting this forth is to show the character of
GIBSON who is the principal functionary of the FPCC, el

oceurring on the same date across the country would produce
effective publicity. According to NY T-24, LEE further
informed MEDIAVILLA that he could now rally many people

to demonstate against the United States going to war, but
he added that Bynes? people were not all peo-CASTRO, merely
anti-war.

stamps plus $15.00 miscellaneous expenses for a total of
about $75.00, LEE said that the CMUN spokesman promised

that the money was to be given to ANSELMO RODRIGUEZ, a
member of the FPCC and also a meriber of the Casa Cuba, for
relay to LEE so that the necessary stamps could be purchased.
