SEMET

and VICTOR VICENTE,

mentioned herein in connection with information regarding

the Cuban Mission to the UN raising $60 for an FPCC

i sion to ement that

mailing of an announcement that an FPCC picket

demonstration would be held on 10/8/62, are subjects

MY files 134566263 and 134-5924, respectively. u

The Cuban-American Civil Rights: /mentioned'

herein, is the subject

of NY file 105-56134 and the

Bureau

has been made cognizant of results of investigation

to date in this case.

DOROTHY W. DOUGLAS; mentioned herein, is

subject of NY file 100-122751

and Bufile 100-355436,

Investigation reflects that DOUGLAS wrote a check

payable to LYLE STUART in the amount of $2,000 and

the day alter STUART deposited this check in his

to the sP0o.

to be noted

to a source in March, 1962, that she had made several

trips to Czechoslovakia in

the past and hoped to make

another trip in the summer of 1962.

It 1s possible

DOUGLAS may have been instrumental in channeling the

two deposits of $5,000 and $5, 500=

all in $100 bills,

into the FPCC bank account in April, 1961, inasmuch

as there was some indication that these $100 bills

might have come from a source in Czechoslovakia.

However, a review of subject's Ni file discloses no

specific information nich ouzd support this as a fact 3(4)

ADMINISTRATIVE CONTID

It is to be noted that investigation

reflects that the

"Cuban Press. Survey" is being

paspared by the Translation Bureau of the NY Chapter

of the FPCC and that henceforth, a revie of this

publication will be reported in that file.

Investigation of DANIEL JUSTIN BERNSTEIN

(NY file 105-51763, Bufile 105-103753) has not developed

any additional pertinent information which would indicate

that funds from the Cuban Government are being channeled

through BERNSTEIN into the FPCC nor has there been

any further Indication that BERNSTEIN has advanced

additional money to the FPCC.

It is to be noted that RICHARD GIBSON's

offer of his services to the FBI and/or CIA for

financial reimbursement is set forth in the interview

of CIsSON,

inasmuch as the Bureau and CIA made a

determination not to use GIBSON's services.

The purpose (8) (U)

in setting this forth is to show the character of

GIBSON who is the principal functionary of the FPCC. (Sl184)

effective publicity.

According to NY I-24, LEE further
