CASTRO'S SUBVERSIVE
CAPABILITIES IN LATIN
AMERICA

THE PROBLEM

To describe and evaluate Castro’s capabilities, with Soviet aelp,
for carrying out subversion and sabotage in Latin Americ« after
satisfaction of all US conditions relative to the withdrawal of
strategic weapons systems from Cuba and a consequent US com-
mitment not to invade.

NOTE: In this estimate we have considered Castro's raw capabilities,
taking note of, but not working out in detail, US and Latin
American capabilities for counteraction.

QO

SUMMARY

A. The dangerously unstable situation that prevails through-
out much of Latin America is the product of fundamental in-

* equities and historic circumstances; it is not the creation of °
Castro and the Soviets. Castro’s efforts, with Soviet help, to
exploit this situation by means of subversion and sabotage nave
not produced significant, results. Propaganda exploitatic:. of
Castro and Cuba as symbols of revolution has probably beer’ more
effective to date than other subversive activities. Casi i
fluence in Latin America had waned by the time of the missile
base crisis and was further reduced by the revelation that he
had accepted Soviet strategic missile bases on Cuban soil and
by the manner of the Soviet decision to withdraw them.

B. Implementation of an agreement between the US anc. the
USSR whereby the strategic weapons systems would be with-
drawn and the US committed not to intervene in Cuba with ferce
will leave Castro with a new immunity and a greater freedom

for subversive actions throughout Latin America. The extent
to which this potential is realized will depend upon the situation
in Cuba, Soviet policy toward Cuba, and the policies and perform-

hemisphere vulnerable to Castro-Communist subversicn-and sab-
otage, and the Soviets are likely to assist. Castro in reaching them
by contributing both to his security at home and to his capability
for action overseas. As in the period before the missile base
crisis, the effect of Castro’s subversive activities will depend not
only upon his capabilities but upon the attractiveness of the
Cuban example and the willingness of the American governments
to take determined counteraction. This willingness will probably
be weakened by fulfillment of the US commitment not to invade
Cuba.

C. We have examined how Castro’s subversive potential would
be affected by alternative courses of Soviet policy regarding Cuba:
(1) virtual withdrawal of support; (2) continuation of economic
and military support ranging from present up,to substantially
increased levels. We believe that course (1). would considerably
reduce Castro’s subversive potential, and that the Soviets are
unlikely to elect it. We conclude that Soviet course (2) would

’ maintain Castro’s potential for subversive action at least at pres;
ent levels or actually raise it to the point where he could under-
take amphibious and/or airborne subversive operations against

THE ESTIMATE

“1. CASTRO'S SUBVERSIVE ACTIVITIES BEFORE THE MISSILE. BASE CRISIS *

. Aims

1. From the time of his accession to power Fidel Castro has sought to
gain acceptance of the Cuban revolution as a model for others and of
himself as the leader of revolutionary forces throughout Latin America.
He has constantly sought to foment revolutions in other Latin American
States. Moreover, Castro has generally had the support of the Sino-
Soviet Bloc in the pursuit of these aims.

Means

2. Castro began. his career of sponsorship for revolutions in Latin
America in 1959 with landings of small rebel forces in Nicaragua, Pan-
ama, the Dominican Republic, and Haiti. None of these were successful
and he turned to other means.

sf 3. From the beginning, propaganda has been one of the principal in-
nN : _ struments on which Castro has relied. In addition to the main trans-
eves missions of Radio Havana for external listeners, which have had a great
deal of revolutionary content, he has beamed special programs devised
’ to stimulate revolutionary action to each of half a dozen selected
uae countries. A major effort has been made through Prensa Latina, the
i Cuban news service, to disseminate Castro-Communist propaganda.
Ls/.. 2. ...'.,..Printed propaganda has also been sent from Cuba into most other
: Latin American States, and Cuban diplomatic missions and personnel
have actively disseminated it. Students returning from indoctrination
in Cuba have helped establish Cuban Institutes for Friendship among

Peoples which have functioned as propaganda outlets.

4, Thousands of Latin Americans have been brought to Cuba; about
1,200 foreign trainees are believed to be there now. Many hundreds
have been trained in revolutionary techniques and guerrilla warfare.
Cuba has been made a main transit point for travel between Latin
America and the Bloc. a

5. Financial support has ‘been frovided by Cuba to revolutionary
groups in a number of-countries, although the cases on which we have
reports reports involved relatively small sums of money. Arms shipments have

a
also been reported, but the evidence is unclear as to-quantities shipped
and the extent of Cuba’s role in thesé transactioxs. We believe that
there is an extensive agent net in Latin America directed from Havana.

6. Castro has associated himself with revolutionary activist groups
throughout Latin America. In most cases these have been Communist,
but where the regular Communist Party favored a legal or parliamen-
tary line he has not hesitated to support dissident Communist groups,
eg., in Brazil, and non-Communist revolutionaries, e.g., in Guatemala
and El Salvador. In some cases he has sponsored new revolutionary
organizations, e.g., in Panama, Colombia, and Peru. In Chile he has
endorsed a popular front coalition made up of Communist and moderate
leftists.

Evaluation

7. Instances of financial and material support sent by Cuba to revolu-
tionaries in other countries which have come to our attention are
probably only a part of the total effort. Even so, the effort seems to
have been relatively small and ineffective. Yet along with the political
and psychological stimuluswhich Castro’s influence has provided, Cuban
subversive activities have perceptibly strengthened activist revolutionary
groups. Dangerous situations subject to exploitation by Castro and
the Communists exist in a number of Latin American countries—
notably Venezuela, Brazil, British Guiana, the Dominican Republic, and
Bolivia, These dangers arise from political and social tensions which
existed long before Castro came to power. They might lie dormant
for some time; but with Castro as a potential detonator, they are more
likely to blow up. The detonative compound will exist as long as Cas-
troism survives, whatever may happen to Castro personally.

2

8. The most dangerous aspect of Castroism has been its broad appeal

as a symbol of revolutionary change and nationalist assertiveness in

i Latin America. Propaganda from Cuba has taken advantage of this

fact and has almost certainly been a more important influence in the

} Latin American situation than Castro’s other subversive activities.

i During 1960 and 1961 Castroism became a ‘force to be reckoned with

politically in a number of Latin American countries. Certain govern-

ments felt obliged to move in the direction of neutralist and leftist posi-

tions. This influence waned, however, after Castro identified himself

i with the Bloc in late 1961. Nevertheless, the. appeal to Castro’s move-

Hl ment continued to be a source of major concern to almost all govern-

ments and seriously restricted their willingness to associate themselves,
at least publicly, with the US. fi

Il. CASTRO'S SUBVERSIVE POTENTIAL IN THE AFTERMATH OF AN
AGREEMENT. UNDER WHICH THE SOVIETS WOULD WITHDRAW
THEIR STRATEGIC MISSILES AND THE US GIVE ASSURANCES THAT
IT WOULD NOT INVADE CUBA e

“9. Castro’s subversive capabilities—and his disposition to use them—
will be enhanced by the sense of security provided by such sophisticated
weapons as are retained in Cuba after the withdrawal of, Soviet strategic
missiles. The IL-28 bombers, if retained, and other modern equipment
noted in Annex B, would be important in this regard. A US commit-
ment not to invade Cuba will further strengthen his sense of immunity
from reprisal and almost certainly encourage him to intensify subver-
sive activities in other Latin American countries.

Response of Castro Supporters to Missile Base Crisis

10. Castro’s supporters throughout Latin America, with few though
important exceptions (e.g., sabotage of oil facilities in Venezuela) , failed
to respond to the missile base crisis with effective acts of sabotage or
with impressive public demonstrations. Two important limiting factors
should be taken into account in judging this response, however. US
action to alert Latin American governments led them to make extensive
advance preparation, including deployment of security forces and the

ry roundup of suspects, a condition’ of readiness which is unlikely to be
a maintained indefinitely. There also may have been some uncertainty
= SH among the activist followers of Castro whether they should make their
pied big effort in response to the announcement of the US blockade, or wait

to for the anticipated US invasion. _Moscow’s;apparent failure to provide

guidance may have contributed to the confusion. It is our judgment,
however, that the response to Castro’s appeal for attacks on the US.
and its friends indicates that his power to command revolutionary
action, at least in the circumstances of the missile base crisis, is limited,

j
Support Which Castro Can Expect in the Future

11. The range of Castro’s support has been, we believe, considerably
: narrowed by events since Castro declared himself a Communist.’ Rev-
iy, elation of the fact that he had allowed the Soviets to establish offensive
bases under exclusive Soviet control has alienated many non-Communist
nationalists, genuine neutralists, and even revolutionaries seeking social
and economic betterment. San Tiago Dantas, formerly Foreign Min-
ister under President Goulart and an author of Brazil’s nonalignment
policy, and leading Mexican officials have publicly expressed their
disenchantment.

12. The activist revolutionaries are probably the only important force
on which Castro can’now count, but even their support has apparently
been rendered less effective by differences on the question of Soviet rela-
tions with Castro and with Latin American Communist parties.

Castro’s Resources for Continued Subversive Activity

13, Arms. (See Annex B.) Castro has substantial stocks of arms.
In addition to Soviet Bloc materiel there are stores.of arms’ inherited
from the Batista regime not being used by Castro forces and available
for distribution outside Cuba. In the past he has apparently been ham-
pered in his efforts to use arms for subversive purposes by problems
of transport and delivery. He has at his disposal, however, 11 IL-14
transports belonging to Cubana airlines which could be used to deliver
arms under certain circumstances. The IL-28’s now in Cuba are in-
appropriate for subversive purposes. However, they could be used for
air drops. Cuba has many small craft suitable for, infiltration of men
and arms. The 6 Khronshtadt subchasers, 16 P-6 motor torpedo boats,
and 12 Komar missile boats-obtained from the Bloc could also bé used
for arms deliveries. If the projected trawler base is built up, trawlers—
both. Cuban and Soviet—could be used for arms deliveries. If Soviet ia
submarines call at the trawler base or at other Cuban ports, they, too/
could be used in support of subversive activities. We see no evidence
that Cuba has or is. developing’ a sophisticated amphibious warfare
capability, and all the means of delivery of arms by sea noted above
would be vulnerable to precautionary measures by Latin American mil-
itary and naval forces.

14. Propaganda apparatus. Castro’s propaganda machine remains
intact. For-the time being, however, his diplomatic missions are likely
to find it harder to disseminate propaganda than in the past, both be-
cause of new precautions by local governments and because of a reduc-
tion-in the numbers of cooperative volunteers outside the organized
Communist’ groups. }

}

15. Money and equipment. Despite differences between Castro and
the USSR concerning dismantling of the missile bases, we believe that the
Soviets will continue to supply Castro with money, supplies, and equip-
ment for subversive activity. The Soviets have certainly supplied Castro
with sophisticated instruments of intelligence collection, sabotage, and
clandestine communications.

16, Organization. The organization of Castro’s subversive assets
throughout Latin America was shown by. the recent crisis to be loose
and otherwise faulty. We estimate that Castro will make a strong
effort to strengthen and improve it, and that he will continue to receive
support in this effort from the Soviet apparatus, both in Cuba itself,
where the Soviet Ambassador is a veteran officer of the KGB, and in
other important centers of Soviet activity such as Mexico City and
Montevideo. "

Other Factors on Which Castro’s Subversive Capability Will Depend

17. If the US and USSR reach and implement the agreement stated ~
in the problem Castro will gain an immunity which he lacked before the ,
missile base crisis. He will, furthermore, still have most of the arms
and equipment which were delivered in the post-July buildup, as well
as enhanced capabilities provided by accelerated training. Presumably
his enemies will have about the same, or less, freedom to engage in
propaganda, sabotage, support for resistance activities, and other actions
designed to overthrow Castro than they had before the crisis—almost
certainly not more. Unless Castro is gravely endangered by internal
political and economic.problems, there is no reason to believe that anti-
Castro activities-aré any more likely to jeopardize his position than they
did before-the crisis. :

ae 18. Situation in Cuba. Castro’s ability to engage in subversive activ-
ed ities will be influenced significantly by the strength and stability of his
pee position at home. Heightened political and economic difficulties in
Cuba would restrict Castro’s subversive effort, while the more secure
he is at home, the more freedom and strength he is likely to have for
subverting other governments and re-establishing his prestige and in-
fluence. Castro’s position in Cuba will depend in part on his own
.. policies, but is likely to depend even more upon those of the Soviets.

. Ge ‘ 19. Alternative Soviet policies. There are several courses of action

i with respect to Cuba which the Soviets are likely to consider. Some

leaders may argue that the whole policy of economic and military .
support for Castro should be abandoned along with the plan for the id
deployment of strategic missiles in Cuba. We believe, however, that

the Soviet stake in Cuba as an ally and as a Soviet center in Latin
America is still too high to abandon. The stake in Castro as a person,
however, is questionable. If the Soviets did make a decision to with-

draw support either from Castro or from Ciba, we bélieve that, Cuban
Gapability for subversion.in Latin America would be greatly reduced, at
least for a time. This capability would be redticéd more in the case of

the Soviets” withdrawing support from Cuba than in the case of their
abandonment of Castro alone.

20. An alternative course would be for the Soviets to continue to
extend economic and military assistance. Such assistance could range
all the way fromthe amounts necessary to maintain Cuba in its present
condition, inchiding\support of the expanded military establishment,
to substantial increases. Such a policy would probably reduce con-
siderably Castro’s internal problems and thus give him additional free-
dom to engage in external subversion and sabotage. Additions to Cas-
tro’s stocks of small arms would not in themselves change his capa-
. bility for subversive activity, as he already has supplies of surplus arms.
However, if the Soviets were to provide substantial additional air and’

sealift capability, the Cubans would be able to mount large-scale
subversive interventions in neighboring countries. Furthermore, what-
ever degree of success is achieved in improving Cuba’s position and in
expanding its physical resources, Cuba’s net capability for subversion

and sabotage will in the last analysis largely be determined by the.

overall situation in Latin America.

21. We do not believe that Castro or the Soviets can yet foresee what
the effects of the recent crisis will be over the long term on their rela-
tionship. The crisis has probably created difficulties of a political and
psychological nature that neither of them can readily solve, however
determined they may be to do so. Castro may have been moved by the
treatment he has received at the hands of the. Soviets to consider
modifying his relationship with them and seeking to improve his rela-
tions with the OAS and possibly even the US. We believe, however,
that he is unlikely to find feasible ways.of reducing his dependence
upon the USSR. The Soviets certainly must consider that they have
effective means of exercising control over Castro. Furthermore, his re-
peated assertions of continued loyalty to Marxism-Leninism make it
unlikely that he is seriously contemplating a restoration of relations
with the OAS, or that he could succeed if he tried.

22. Policy of other American nations. Castro’s subversive capabilities
will be greatly influenced by the policies.and actions of other Latin
American nations, as by those of the US. We believe that the high
state of security alert that has prevailed since 22 October and the show
of unity that marked the recent crisis are unlikely to last. There is
‘sure to be a revival of nationalist sentiments. On balance, however,
we believe that the prospects for countersubversive action by Latin
American States, on their own and in conjunction with the US, are im-
proved. Many responsible Latin Americans will have interpreted recent
events to mean that firm. and united action can be effective against
the Soviet threat from Cuba. However, Latin American governments
will probably be less willing to take coordinated action against Com-
munist inroads if the US commits itself not to invade Cuba.

Likely Future Targets for Cuban Sabotage

23. The extent of Castro’s capabilities for sabotage and other clan-
destine activity in Latin America will depend upon the complicated
factors noted above. Whatever his capabilities are, he will not be at
a loss for targets against which to use them. Some of the more obvious
targets are:

a. US missions and personnel. US missions and personnel all over
Latin. America were designated as targets for attack in the various
calls for action which went out during the recent crisis. Action against

: _—_

NW 65360 Docld:32423995 Page 12



—SECREF-

such targets has a primarily political and propaganda value to Castro
in that it tends to show public opposition to US policy. It is also rela-
tively easy for Castro to promote attacks against official US installations
in a crisis situation and to get help from all the various elements which
are opposed to American influence in the area. Future attacks may
be anticipated in situations in which Castro feels that the public resent-
ment of US policy exists or can be stirred up.

it mn b. Physical targets vulnerable to a limited sabotage effort. Prime
f targets for sabotage will be mining, industrial, and business installa-
tions in which there is a large proportion of US capital, which are other-
wise associated with the US, or which are so important to the local
economy that damage to them would create difficulties for govern-
ments which are anti-Castro and cooperating with the US. Oil facilities
in Venezuela, including the oil and water pipelines to the’refineries on
the Paraguana Peninsula, and similar facilities are likely to be chosen
as targets for Cuban sabotage. Installations for the handling of Vene-
zuelan iron ore are also likely objectives. US installations in Panama
might be attacked.

~. c. Port and communications facilities are generally vulnerable to

te sabotage and are appealing targets to Cubans and other Latin American

Communists particularly in countries which are cooperating with the

US and whose communications media are taking an anti-Castro line.

Telephone, telegraph, radio and television facilities, and most public

utilities, particularly electric power and transformer stations, are poten-

tial targets. Selection of targets for sabotage will depend on the im-

4 portance of particular facilities but even more on the varying access of
Castroites and Communists to them.

oO

d. Political targets susceptible to exploitation. Political instability
throughout Latin America, in almost every case characterized by pres-
i. sures from below upon relatively conservative and generally anti- r
f Communist governments, provide Castro with opportunities for sub-
versive political activity. Particularly unstable situations include the
following:

(1) Venezuela, where Communist-inspired disorders have been kept |
in check by the government, but where continued Communist
and leftist violence may lead the military to take control.
In a country such as Venezuela, where the stability of an anti-
Castro and anti-Communist government depends heavily upon
one man, assassination is another danger.

(2) Nicaragua, where Communist-led groups, in anticipation of
coming elections, may seek to incite or exploit violence against
the Somoza regime.

* (3) Guatemala, where President Ydigoras’ position is weak and

(4) The Dominican Republic, where the problems of political recon-
_~—struction after a generation of dictatorship have proved almost
more than the caretaker government can handle, and where
some political groupings amenable to Castro’s influence are
seeking to gain a footing.

(5) Bolivia, where the struggle for dominance within the ruling
MNR Party between the moderates and those on the far left
is ready-made for exploitation by Castro.

(6) Brazil, where Communists have penetrated the government
and military to some limited extent, the tide of nationalist and
anti-US feeling is strong, and depressed socio-economic condi-
tions and inefficient government administration provide Castro
many opportunities, especially in the northeast.

The following description of the Cuban Government's measures this
past year to organize propaganda and press control fs based upon the
25 Septenber report of an official German service supplemented by August
1962 information from o felrly reliable independent source.

Tn early 1962 the ORI decided to egtablich « Comite de Orientaciton
Revolucionaria (COR) to be vespancible for all propaganda activities
of the Gubsn Government and for censorship of the presé. Cesar Bhealente,
en old-time Coummnist, a wonber of the ORE National Directorate and brother -
of Anthel Bucalente who wan later “purged” by Castxo, was appointed head
off the COR qnd thus given control over the entire Cuban press, radio, and
television. By August, Cesar Escalante was reported to. have & personal
eteff of 15 workers, moat of whom vere Commmnist Party members, end to
pe holding weeltly briefing sessions with editers of the four large Havena
newipapers, entrusting censorship to these editors,

Yn late June 1962, the ORT set up a committee to be in charge of
coordination of Cuban propaganda throughout Intin America, This committee
was subordinate to the COR, and consisted of representatives from the
Ministry of Poréiga Relstions, the Prensa Latine news agency and the COR,
The dixector of Prensa Intinn was the news agency's representative on this

conmittee, The representative of the COR, however, along with the repre-
sentative of thé Foreign Ministry, believed to be Ramon Penate y Molina,
were said to have actually dstexnined the policy of Prensa Letina.

The reorganization of Prensa Letina ds deseribed as Escalante’s
moet important accomplishment, Since mid-July 1962 the news agency

Ministry end is. serving se ite propaganda medium in these countries. with

in English,’French, and Spanish for Europe.and the Americas for a total

‘of 42 hours a week. Since then, "Radio Havana" has grown by leaps and —

i. The World Peace Council (WPC). was expected to pay for the
@ expenses of the Continental Congress in Support of Cuba,
which is to be held in Rio de Janeiro from 28 to 30 March 1963,
according to comments made by General Luiz Gonzaga Leite,
president of the Society of Friends of Cuba (SAC), at a
meeting of the SAC on 21 January 1963.

2. As of 21 January the SAC had not received any replies from
the invitations sent to the African nations to participate
in the congress. It was announced at the meeting that Valerio
Konder, acting president of the Brazilian Pro-Peace' Movement
and a member of the SAC,was planning to go to Tanganyika to
attend the Third Afro-Asian Peoples' Solidarity Conference
in early February and would take a copy of the convocation
for the congress with him.

3. Plans were made for painting slogans concerning the congress
: all over the city and for placing large signboards along some
of the main parkways. The possibility was discussed of
persuading a well-known painter, such as Emiliano di Cavalcanti,
to paint a picture for the congress, which would be raffled
off for the. benefit of the congress.

4, At a meeting of the SAC on 15 January a series of-pro-Cuba
meeti ; which would be held before the congress, was
planned. The possibility of inviting certain Brazilian
artists to perform at the meetings in order to attract a
large crowd was discussed. The SAC was also trying to obtain
the signature of Dias Gomes, the theatrical producer, on the
convocation of the congress. Gomes planned to go on 19 January
5 to Cuba, where he was to direct a play.

c n' Progr: Ci

The Voice of America broadcasts 8 ah hours in Spanish daily
to Latin America, of which 2 3/4 hours is tailored especially for
the Cuban audience. The transmission times of the Cuban hours are
6:00 to 7:00 a.m., and 10:00 to 11:45 p.m.

The "Appointment with Cuba" hour (10:00 to 11:00 p.m.) consists
of 15 minutes of news, followed by a five-minute commentary on some
development in the Cuban situation, a 30-minute Miami-produced package
(interviews with refugees, commentaries refuting the latest Caban
propaganda claims, excerpts of letters received from listeners inside

/ Cuba), and a ten-minute sports feature emphasizing the activities of
Cuban athletes in the U.S.

~ The 11:00 to 11:45 p.m. broadcast opens with 15 minutes of news
‘ec and is followed either by a half-hour dramatization or a 15-minute
news documentary and 15 minutes of features. A 150-installment series |
of a soap-opera type adventure, featuring three brothers combatting |
a Castro-like regime, was run at this time until recently. A new.
series of this dramatization is now being produced under contract in
Miami with Cuban writers and actors and will soon be broadcast to Cuba
in the same time spot.

The 7:00 to 8:00 a.m. broadcast to Cuba also opens with 15 minutes
of world news and repeats the Miami package and features of the previous
night.

In the six hours of daily broadcasts to the general Latin American
audience, which can also be heard in Cuba, the total material relating a
to the Cuban situation averages approximately one hour. This consists
of commentaries, interviews with refugees, and news documentaries.

In addition to the short-wave broadcasts (relayed also to Cuba
on medium wave by two mobile transmitters), the main features on Cuba
are sent out as tapes to all USIS posts in Latin. America for placement
with some 1500 local radio stations. The numberof listeners reached
by this means is many times greater than the shortwave audience.

The main themes emphasized in the Voice's Cuban programming are:
1). Castro's betrayal of a legitimate national revolution; 2) the sub~
a : servience of the Cuban regime to international communism; 3) the economic
E failures of the regime, relating these to the pattern of communist failures
in the rest of the world; 4) the isolation of Cuba in the face of continental
solidarity opposing Cuba's alliance with the communist bloc; and 5) the U.S.
position that Cuba will one day be free. :

GENERAL: Despite continuing reports of Castro/Commnist

offers of financial assistance to individuale and groups in Latin
America, there is no proof thet the delivery ¢f funds was ectually
made. Cash transactions other than those made with Cuban pesos
outside of Cuba would be virtually impossible to trace. There is
some fairly firm evidence thet in March 1962 an mount of $10,000
was provided to the Guatemalan "13 Noverber Movement” besed in Mexico

City for use in actions againet. the Government of Guatemala.

The group, which led a guerrille outbreak earlier this year,

$10,000 in Cuban financial assistance since last March. Meanwhile,
sporedic bomb explosions in Guatemalan City may mark the beginning of

Source Comment. Plata, who appears to be approximately 60 years old,
is well acquainted with the MOEC contacts in Ibague. He also has

“a very close relationship with Zapata, who was in complete agreement
with the criticism of the "soft line" of the PCC as represented by
Vieira. It also appears there is a much closer understanding and
co-operation between MOEC and PCC at this level than appears

‘lower levels.

Field Comments H }

1: Members of the Regional Committee of the Department of Valle have
expressed differences in the recent past with the action of the
"(Central Committee of the PCC over the lack of action during

““the Cuban blockade. They also have spoken of their plans to
participate in sabotage in the Cali area. Apparently the aggres-
Sive faction, headed by Zapata, has been overruled by Jose
‘Cardona Hoyos, secretary-general of the local regional committee.”

Cucuta, capital of the Department of Norte de Santander, is on

‘the -Yenezuelan border and is a traditional center of smuggling

of recruiting and controlling Cuban assistance to the organiza -
€ion in the Cali area. fi

7. The-FUAR seems to have been in a recess during recent months in
the Cali area. In early November Luis Emiro Valencia, one of
the leaders of the FUAR, was asked directly if there was any
truth to the story circulating in Cali that Castro had given
him 50,000 dollars R. He laughed and asserted the
afount mentioned in Bogota is only 30,000. He said his only
assistance from Cuba was a 1,000-dollar first prize in a literary
contest in 1959 or 1960 and~two paid trips thereafter to
judge other literary contests. It_is difficult to determine
the truth of Valencia's denial or the charges mentioned herein.
The story hasbeen circulating in Cali for approximately six
months and could be hearsay on the part of either Plata or
Zapata. It is noteworthy that Valencia has refused to espouse _-
common ideology with the PCC, except for Castro, which Valencia
insists he will not accept if it is a tool of international

"i think I seid that we knew of some 1,000 to 1,500 that were in training

from 4 to 4o weeks, CIA has indicated informally thet the bulk of the
1,000 to 1,500 reported abové are still in Cuba,

U.S. intelligence agencies are largely dependent upon
third country sourees for information conceming those who received train-
ing in Cuba. Systems of documenting these yleitors and their travel to and
fvom Cuba are in the process of betng undertaken by many Latin American
nations, Among the problems which cohfront latin American security forces
are the fact that Cuban visitors employ many devious means in travelling
to and from Cuba; some states deaire not. to infringe on the freedom of

. movement of its citizens; the use of felse documents or aliases by
travellers; and the difficulty of obtaining  weful exchange of intelli-
gence auong Letin States, There is also some problem of separating Cuban~
dnspired plotters from the leftists, oppositioniste, and political plotters

SUBJECT: The Training of Latin Americans 12 Guba

1. Xt is estimated, that at‘ least 1,000: and
perhaps ‘as many as 1,500 individuals. from other.
Latin American countries were in Guba for ‘varying
periods of time during 1962 to receive ideological
indoctrination or guerrilla warfare training."

Guiana and an undetermined. number, ‘perhaps 100,

vom various African countries; including Aagolaas, -

Kenyans, Zanzibaris, and Negre nationalists trem
the Republic of South Africa. Most of the traiacoo
are young--in thelr teons, twenties, and early
thirties.. A sizable proportion had attended unde
versities or secondary schools in home countries.

2. Ina public addeess, on 9 ‘June 1L96L,. PAdod
Castro amhounced ‘that his government intonded to
grant 1,000 scholarships to "poor students” from
other Latin American countries for the noxt. school’
term,and 100 scholarships to students rem otkhor,

they are to take standard courses at Cuban univer-
sities or other institutions in such subjects as_,
agronomy, irrigation techniques, industrial manage”
ment, etc. Even if their courses in Cuba are as é
represented to them before theix arrival, they are
undoubtedly given heavy ideological indoctrination —
and, like Cuban students, expected to tyolunteeh™ ”,
for various emergency tasks such as picking coffee
and harvesting sugar. Many ev these probably also
veceive training in guerrilla tactics and other
techniques of subversion. a :
4, ‘Other students are grankly told before :
they leave their home countries: for Cuba that their
training in Cuba will be. in guerrilla warfare tactics,
that it will be a rigorous program, and that they
will’ be .required to maintain strict staidards of 6oa-
duct and security. © : : :

5, There have been & number of rveports--f£ron
clandestine sources in Cuba, from sources in contact
with the trainees after. they have returned -£rom Cuba,
from Cuban refugees, and from 4. few of the trainees
themselves-=conceraing the typos of training which
the young non-Cubans undergo in Cuba. “Phe guorrilla
training programs for Latin Americans: in. 1961 and
1962 do not appear to have “peen particularly weld
organized. in some instances, the. trainees were -
moved to protest the fact that thexe wore long ‘porieds
when they wexe doing Little or nothing; an other Ane
stances they were disgruntled over what, they elt was
harsh treatment, OF when they thought. too much was

.expected of them. The majority: of the trainees, how-

ever, probably took the experience in stride.

6. ‘Included ia the guerrilla training prograns
have been long tiarches through the forests and mouBe
tains, especially in the Sierra Maestra mountains
where Castro carried on his guerrilla campaign agains

Batista. Students often are required to hike to tho +
- top of Pico Turquine, Cuba's highest mountain 6,230 ~

feet). ‘During the hikes, they engage in simulated
guerrilla defensive and offensive exercises, are
taught how to gend for themselyes dm’ the wilderness,

of the cnemy and in Latin America the authorities
use US weapons. They are 21so given instruction.

in demolition of bridges and other structures, in:
the manufacture of explosives and the construction
of Kolotov cocktails. au

7. Scattered, throughout the entire course
are periods of ideological indoctrination, some=
times given in the training camps and sometimes
for .large groups in Havana. They are also given
instruction in.the general ‘strategy of the “antie
imperialist struggle" and often specific advice
on how. best to carry out the struggle in- their ime
dividual. countries. A group of students from El
Salvador, for instance, visiting Cuba last October, «
were told that they should give more emphasis to
the penetration and qontrol of groups ‘at the National
University and to the control of the labor movement»
It was explained to them that they should initially
seek as wide support as possible from all political
factions and. that when the imitial stages of the
revolution had been accomplished the non-Commuaists

_ could be eliminated.

8. The instructors are mostly. Cubans, but .
there have:-been some Spaniards and a few Algerians.
reported among the instructors.: General Enrique
Lister, Spanish Communist veteran of the Spanish
civil war who subsequently received military training

in the USSR, is in Cuba, He reportedly assists in

the guerrilla training program. - None of the reports
on the subject give credible evidence of Soviet oF
other bloc instructors for these trainees: However, -
a small portion of those trained in Cuba subsequently -
go on to the Sino-Soviet bloc where they may bo syube

carly last July and left ia late. December has deo
Scvibed some detail his experiences in.Cuba

during ‘this period. He was first approached by
r gentine pro-Castro leader last June as to.
whether he would be interested in taking courses
in Cuba on guerrilla warfare and “elty fighting.”
After several days he agreed, With three ether
Argentines, none .6f them orthodox Conimunists but
all of them radicals, he left Buenos Aires on :
about 1 July... He traveied by way of Uruguay, . ee,
Chile, Brazil; and Trinidad to Cuba. In Chile,
the Cuban emhassy supplied him with travel money
- and "complimentary visas" to enter Cuba. . He are
vived sin Havana on 5 July. - During most of July
he had little to do as a Erqup of about fifty
gradually collected at a camp near, Havana, Thoy
eventually protested this lack of action and
were visited by Fidel Castro, who apparently camo
"to assure them that thoir program would shortly eee
get underway, On 30 July they began a series of : 7 h
marches into the woods somewhere in the Organos
mountains in Pinar del Rio province under the
command of two Cuban officers; Most of' his activity
a between August and October seems to have beon CORe
cerned with guerrilla training. Training with ain
were 34 others, most if not all of them-apparentiy . -
Argentines.. There were ‘political disputes among
them, particularly concéraing the pro-Communist
Argentine Peronist leader John William Cooke, a
political exile in Cuba who apparently had some
- ‘degree of authority over the Argentine trainees
but who was resented. by them, . tees

i il. During the October crisis the entire ae i
group “volunteered” to join the militia in defense .
of the Cuban revolution “threatened by Yankee in-
vasion." After the crisis eased, they began classes
in "political economy"taught by a Spaniard: nained . !
“Guillen.” -These classes were. held daily for elgne : :
days until ‘5 November, when the ‘group was again _ : : ;
sent into the field for guerrilla training. They ‘4
engaged in firing practice, with various types o”

rae ‘weapons, including rifles and bazookas, On 14 i
November they were moved to a new area for a new : : i
course in “guerrilla tactics." This included prace i
tice in hanging hammocks, digging trenches, making '
wire cntanglenents, as well 2s exercises in the

Leas part in the Course;

1.'a group of Argentines, varying in number between 34 and 50,
and including Peronists, Trotskyites, and Vanguard Social-
ists, attended a six-month course in guerrilla warfare in
“ Cuba’ from July to December 1962. Part of the group

traveled from Buenos Aires to Cuba by way of Chile “|

‘they received courtesy visas for Cuba and financial
assistance from the Cuban Embassy. They had been told
“by Reinaldo Frigerio, leftist Peronist, that they would /
be met by John William Cooke, leftist Peronist residing/
‘,in Cuba,! but instead were met in Habana by a member of
poe ©" Cuban G-2 and taken to the Hotel Riviera, where they
eee - later met Cooke. Cooke told them that it was necessary
: : to train expert guerrillas who could carry out the,
er  yevolution in Argentina. He insisted that General Juan
Peron knew about the training.

“ From the hotel the trainees were transfgrred to the Tabare

| finca, behind the Buen Pastor Seminary.” After several
.| weeks of inactivity they were visited on 20 July by

Fidel Castro who promised that they would soon begin
bes “their training. They were transferred the next day to

Rio; the march lasted about one month. .On 26 August the
41 men returned to Tabare.

On 3 September, the trainees were moved to a house called
"San Antonio," at kilometer no. 18, Arroyo Arenas,
Habana Province. The house had belonged to Celia Rosa
Toucezt Masfera. From 28 August to 10 September, when
classes began, training consisted mainly of Communist
films which they were taken to see several times. From
10 September to 14 November classes were held in the
following subjects: weapons and explosives, ballistics,
communications, strategy, tactics, marksmanship, :
sanitation, and closed and open drill, Manolo (1nu),

a Cuban, gave classes in explosives; Guillen (fnu)

taught economics; Angel Martinez taught the class in

guerrilla tactics and strategy; ‘an unidentified mulatto
instructed the class in communications; a 17-year old
youth named Jose (1nu) taught marksmanship; and a man
known as "Cara de.Goma" (Rubber Face), a Cuban, served
aS political commissar. Weapon practices were made
with 22-calibre Mauser rifles, Garand rifles, Thompson
submachine guns, Browning and Husine rifles, bazookas,
and 8l-mm mortars. They also practiced with a 57-mm
recoilless cannon.

Alicia Eguren de Cooke, John William Cooke's wife,
visited the school at San Antonio; on one occasion She
told the students in a speech that they had to forget
Peron and Peronism since they had to organize a
guerrilla army, an Army of Liberation,

On 14 November the trainees were moved to "Las Mil Lomas |
de Echeverria," five kilometers from the town of Pan de
Guajaibon (N 22-48, W 82-21), Pinar del Rio Province.
They dug trenches and individual foxholes and studied
mines and fuses, illumination with infrared rays, and
Bengal lights, and the construction of electrified and
simple wire entanglements. On 17 November, under the

. direction of a Cuban lieutenant known as Manolo Nunez,

they carried out two sighting exercises. Later that ‘
day they carried out two more sighting exercises and
made a march with topographic maps of the area; the
march did not turn out well because of errors of caleu-
‘lation on the map. Daily training from 18 November
through 25 November was as follows:

18 November - Rested and studied.

19 November - Made observations from a hillock,
: studied, and made a scouting-type march,

20 November - Practiced defense exercises and fighting
from individual foxholes; explored and
located elements of a simulated barracks

... in the hills, taking notes with regard
io .to an attack.

21 November - Studied plan of attack. on the encampment.

ie | °22 November - Studied plan of attack on the encamp-
ment; marched in the rain, camping in
the woods,

23 November - Practiced hanging and taking down
hammocks; studied tactical manual.

24 November -" Practiced security and emergency plan
of the encampment.

ie oso 25 November - Studied tactical manual.”

On 26 November, during an exercise to practice security
on the march, the advance and rear guard groups got lost
in the woods. As a result there was criticism of poor
leadership, and the instructor ordered them to repeat
the operation. Several men refused, and the instructor ~
ordered that they not be given anything to eat. Because
of the order, the rest of the men refused to eat but
through argument_and an appeal to the Revolution they.”
were eventually persuaded to do so. :

While they were studying on 27 November, Lt. Manolo
“Nunez arrived from Habana with news that the course

- would be intensified because some of the group had a
fixed date for their departure from Cuba for Argentina.
During the day a conversation was overheard in which a
Trotskyite said that the Cuban Government ought not

to allow those who wanted to leave to do so since they
might be dangerous when they got to Argentina. The
conversation was repeated to members of the Peronist
group, one of whom loaded 'a rifle, intending to shoot
the Trotskyite. The shooting was prevented but the
atmosphere was so tense that the two groups were ready
to fight. At that moment the lieutenant instructor
appeared and took away the rifles and ammunition; he
immediately went to Habana to report the incident.

By night the five Trotskyites were separated from
their group.

33

On 29 November Cooke arrived and urged the immediate
withdrawal of the Peronists and the Vanguard Socialists
so that they could return to Argentina. That evening

the trainees left for Habana, where they were housed in

a residential building on Calle Septima. On 30 November
the trainees, because of their semi-abducted situation,
became very concerned and put on civilian clothes instead
of their military, uniforms, On 1 December some of the
men left the housé without permission, intending to take
aie a walk; they were told by Ulises (Inu), a Negro member

& a of G-2, that, they could not go out without the permission
: of the Cuban Government, They said that they wished to
deal directly with 'the Cuban Government concerning their
return home since they did not wish to have anything to
do with Cooke, who they thought was deceiving them.
Ulises immediately asked them for a written, personal
report, including 1) their regard for and opinion of
‘John William Cooke; 2) the type of work which they
desired to do when they arrived in Argentina; 3) their
political affiliations; and 4) the impressions produced

NW 65360 Doctd:32423995 Page 90



i by the Cuban Revolution. :

| 10. Even after the reports were submitted the rule against

| - leaving the building continued in effect, so they then
talked with the political commissar who went to see

H about the matter. When he returned he said that he

iH - had not been able to put the case before higher

H

'
authorities. |
/ 11.- on 6 December one Guidi (1nu),4 someone Cooke's wife |

had met in Montevideo, took several of the trainees to
have their photos taken for the visa required for
leaving Cuba. The Vanguard Socialists refused to i
go because of the man's connection with Cooke; they ~‘‘!
wished to deal with the Cuban representatives. When

one of the: trainees who was taken to see Cook explained
his position, stating that he no longer would obey orders
from anyone but General Peron, Cooke replied that he
should be careful what he said, especially since the
Cuban Revolution had taken a turn toward the Chinese
policy in view of the behavior of the Soviet Union.

: 12, Guillen, the Spanish instructor, said that he had spent
a an entire afternoon in the Albanian Embassy trying to
obtain aid for the Argentine guerrilla army.

13. During the period when the events described above took
place,> Hector Villalon, an emissary from General Peron, ,,
arrived with instructions to demand the immediate .
departure from Cuba of all those who were studying in
she schools; in this he was supported by the Vanguard
Socialists.

14.°:The first group of trainees left Habana for their
yeturn home via Prague on 11 December, Thé’men,. in
some cases, were given two passports, one Cuban and
one Ecuadorean. In Prague they were interviewed by

c Vila (fnu), who is in charge of Cubana Airlines
flights in Prague. His assumed name is Velasquez.

15, The last assignment given the students in Habana was to‘... |
send a telegram after their arrival in Argentina to

a Yolando Perez, Instituto Cubano de Amistad con los \**

Pueblos (ICAP, Cuban Institute for Friendship with the

People) with the message "I could not accept the -* 5

Instructions were also given to return the passports

the men were organized in squads which were composed
as follows:6

In addition, there was a group which made up the general
staff in which the acquaintances of one "Lucero" from
Cordoba, Argentina, figured; he belongs to the Tres
Banderas Party, of neo-Peronist ideology. Persons known
- as "Marelli;" "Mellin," and "Belaz," followers of Cooke,
were also associated with the general staff.

Josef Hokes, former Czech Ambassador to Mexico, plays an
importan{ role in Cuba's revolutionary activity in Latin
America. He is allegedly connected in Peru with Hugo
Blanco, a revolutionary leader who lives in the mountains
of Cuzco,. to whom he has sent economic assistance and*
armaments. He is said to have carried out similar actions
for Alljo de Fleitas, a priest and guerrilla leader of
Brazil.

Invasions are not contemplated as a part of the revolutionary
program in LAtin America unless there are first internal up-

. risings. These could: possibly be carried out, because
equipment for. such uprisings is already stored in strategic
places. :

<Hokes was present at a reception which the Czech Embassy in
Habana gave for Fidel Castro and other Cuban officials.3 Among
those invited were Manuel Galich, of Guatemala, and Aleksandr
Ishkov, Minister of Fisheries of the USSR. :

. Latin American leaders who wished to speak with Hokes.in order
aa to obtain assistance were presented in Mexico by Natividad Rosales - |)
sand Luis Suarez. ~ ‘ é

Chinese leaders are~demanding that Cuba invade Guatemala,
Nicaragua, El-Salvador, Costa Rica, and Puerto Rico, and
bombard-Panama. They are also demanding that Cuba issue
ordérs that the Communist and liberal soldiers in Venezuela f
overthrow the government and take power, and that the
guerrilla organizations in Chile, Colombia, and Peru prepare i
for the declaration of a general revolutionary strike. As for -:.!
‘Mexico, there they will only await an occasion when the military
supporters of General Lazaro Cardenas and other active groups
will take over power by means of a passive insurrection.

ee

Cardenas and his supporters would rely upon receiving decisive
assistance from the internal and external revolutionary {
organizations resulting from the coalition of Communist and k
revolutionary parties of Central America and Mexico which was {|
;
|

carried out in Mexico in August 1962 and in which the Mexican
leaders exercised control and supervision through Arnoldo
_ Martinez Verdugo, a member of the central committee and the
i political commission of the Partido Comunista Mexicano (PCM,
“Mexican Communist Party). The coalition is made up of the
PCM, the Partido Guatemalteco de Trabajadores (PGT, Guatemalan i
“Communist Party), the Partido Socialista de Nicaragua (PSN, 00.) |)
Nicaraguan Communist Party), the Vanguardia de Accion |
Nacional (VAN, pro-Cuban revolutionary group), the Partido
Communista Salvadoreno (PSC, Salvadoran Communist Party), :
Partido “Comunista de Honduras (PCH, Communist Party of
Honduras), Partido de los.Trabajadores de Honduras. (PTH,
Honduran Workers Party):, and other leftist groups. The :
administrative Secretary of the organization works in the ei
building of the Mexican-Czech Institute of Culture, at - :
:Calles Insurgentes, and Reforma and in its Political Bureau j
‘at Calle Londres 252. The coordinator is the international q
Communist Max Aub Mohrenwitz, a resident of Mexico who works |
for \the National University of Mexico, Also, Emilio Portes |
Gil,” former" president of Mexico, is ‘involved in this: |

coalition and relies upon the support of soldiers on active
duty and on the National Front of Liberation.

10. The coalition has arms which were disembarked at Vera Cruz,
& Mexico, from the Soviet vessel TARKA (phonetic spelling)
during late September or early October 1962. Arms have
also allegedly been unloaded, in accordance with the plans
referred to, somewhere along the coasts of Peru and Chile,
and possibly in Brazil, in spite of the fact that the
coalition did not include Argentina, Chile, Uruguay,
Paraguay, Bolivia and Brazil.

11. In addition to General Cardenas and the PCM, Mexican
organizations associated with the coalition include the
Partido Obrero-Campesino Mexicano (POCM, Mexican Worker-
Peasant Party), the Federacion Obrera:Revolucionaria (FOR, -

|. Revolutionary Workers Federation), and the Movimiento

<.'. Reyolucionario del Magisterio (MRM, Revolutionary Teachers

--° Movement); they have allegedly been organized into a

permanent association at Calle Salvador No. 30-301,

profiting by the passive attitude of the official

intelligence organizations, a portion of whose personnel
also belong to this Communist conspiracy.

Headquarters Comments
‘11, Hokes left Mexico on 4 October 1962.

9. Fleitas is probably identical with Alipio de Freitas, who
has made many speeches favoring revolution along Cuban lines.

it was in October 1962.

4. Suarez is probably identical with Luis Suarez Lopez,
* naturalized Mexican of Spanish origin, who is a
Communist newspaperman.

° Recently Portes Gil publicly denounced Cardenas and charged
that he is working for a foreign power.

‘ All these questions (the 58) had three principal motives:
; to know the future guerrilla fighter better; and, above all,
his needs and limitations for the struggle; and, generally,
his personal~problems and those of morale. Time given for
answering each question was unlimited. One of the possibilities
4s°that of introducing arms by smuggling, as, for example, in
the case or relatives who work on the borders, such as comrades
from Cuzco; also, in the case of Comrade Betancurt (pseudonym)
who is from the town of Ayabaca, Piura, and who has facilities
for smuggling arms, since his community borders on Ecuador,
where large-scale smuggling of arms has developed. Also, the
experiences of soldiers, such as Vallejos, who have served in
such localities, show considerable practice in effecting such
contraband.
“1, Source Comment. In the question regarding possibilities
OF guerrilla warfare, the Cubans asked about possibilities
of supply by air--suitable drop-zones, etc. It is possible
that this questionnaire has been filled out by at least
100 Peruvians who have gone to Cuba. Among those who have
enlarged on these topics, the range is from lawyers down
to those who can barely write their names. Likewise, from
“the interest they are showing in Peru, it is presumed that
many Cubans can introduce themselves into the country,
passing as Mexicans or Panamanians, and set up profitable
businesses and commercial firms. One of those who presented
the questions had been in Brazil. The Cubans took two photos
of those in training, front and profile, in militia uniform,
but without EN

7. The FUAR seems to have been in a recess during recent months in
the Cali area. In early November Luis HEmiro Valencia, one of
the leaders the FUAR, was asked directly if.there was any
truth to the story circulating in Cali that Castro had given

* him 50,000 dollars to help FUAR. He laughed and asserted the
amount mentioned in Bogota is only 30,000. He said his only
assistance from Cuba was a 1,000-dollar first prize in a literary
contest in 1959 or 1960 and two paid trips thereafter to
judge o y literary contests. It is difficult to determine
the truth of Valencia's denial or the charges mentioned herein.
The story has been circulating in Cali for approximately six

nonths and could be hearsay on the part of either Plata or

Zapata. it is noteworthy that Valencia has refused to espouse

common ideology with the PCC, éxcept for Castro, which Valencia

insists he will not accept if it is a tool of international

Communism.

from 7 to 21 Getober 1962, at vhich thirteen countries were represented,
allegedly were used by the Cuben Government 8s an opportunity to indoctrigate ».
and train a number of Latin American students. Several Salvadorean athietes
reportedly took no part in the games but spent their tine in training classes
for "Socialist revolution" conducted by Cuban instructors. A number of
athletes fron other unspecified coumtries followed the same schedule,

He OST COMMENT: (C) (Gp-1) Such events es this competition supple-

ments the vast treining program conducted in Cuba. Meny of the partici-

pants in the 1960 conference of the Commmist front World Federation

of Democratic Youth (WFDY) in Hevana stayed behind to teke part in a

“work cep" sponsored by the WDY in the Cierra Miestras. Attendance

at such events may algo serve ag eover for Party travel and other

personnel previously selected for specialized training. ‘The events

also served to promote the imagé of Cuba as a major regional, Coummist

stronghold. (SCIB, Vol XI, #2h, 28 November 1962)

O8t Commu: (8) (Gp-1) As was noted in the Penama section of this
