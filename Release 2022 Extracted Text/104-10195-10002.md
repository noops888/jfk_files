for the Station

through my

assignment 1n

the

at. Heudquartors and, for the past 2 1/2 years,

as the Station officer responsible for

I

have always considered CASASIN to be a highly skilled, experienced

senior case officer.

thoroughly devoted to the work of

BKHERALD.

He la becoming

Increasingly

effective 1n his present cover position

at

operating agalnat both soviet and IKC targets, and

am delighted that he

has agreed to continue his cooperation with

the Station

as a fleld agent

following his retirement from

BKHERALD effective 30 June 1974.

CASASIN can look back with pride

over his years of service wich

BKHERALD but he can also look

forvard to additional years of highly useful, productive work for

Paris Statlon.

CASASIN's attitude can best be summed up by a comment on my

first operational

meeting with hin following his officlal retire

ment.

He instinctively went immediately to a discussion of

operations, not of rettrement.

I am confident that CASASIN will

continue to be a highly motivated, effective asset of Paris Station,.

and I wish hin

well.

level; in point of fact, It would, in the writer's opinion, merit a solid "S",

but no more.

Recognizing that such ratings are perforce subjective, and

that the rating officer has a closer, almost daily experience factor,

nonetheless, the reviewer simply does not believe that the written record of

the NOC's accomplishments on the specific targets will support an "0"

rating. at this time. Even accepting the limitations which the cover

situation imposes upon

henas still' not perförmed in a manner

which would correspond to theliteral definition of "0".

Other than this divergency, the reviewer shares the laudatory comments

set forth in the narrative

He is all the things the rater has

stated and more: highly intelligent,

versatile, linguistically extremely

vell qualifred, and professionally experienced in his cover role.

He has

begun

very well to utilize this new cover position on the Organization's

behalf, and it is quite accurate to note that

landed this particular

plus (in terms of competition for the cover vacancy) solely on the basis of

his own demonstrated: talents in the cover context.

In sun, this is an experienced, rifective

whose nui cover affordo him

an expanded natural access to a host of the Station's primary targets; he has

begun to exploit this. access in a sound, logical fashion,

programs. In fairness to all concerned, it is simply too early in this new

position to attempt a definitive judguent uf che depth of access which can be

Comments by Chief,

Although concurring with an overall rating of "S", I consider the "o"

-ratings for specific duties numbers one and two to be soneshat high and I recommend

"s" for both. Casasin certalaly has naintained his cover and ve anticipate

BY FEVIEWIN; OFFICIAL

COMMENTS OF NEVIEMING OFFICIAL I

I concur with

the supervisor's letter ratings

and with the

substance

of his narrative comments.

•Put as simply as possible, Subject has

done

an outstanding job in establishing superb access cover; it now remains

for him and the Station to exploit it operationally.

On the basis of

his ability during the reporting period to establish meaningful

relationships with target Soviets or to spot and assess leads to

potential

agents who can, Subject's retention is this assignment would

not be justified in terms of costs.

The 40% rebate does rake this effort

entirely defensible, however, buf Subject should understand that we

expect nore concrete results now that his cover position has been

salidif-iad.

than in that of sore than chort-range operational development.

subject's operational altuation makes it Impossible for hia to

attempt recruitmento. Thus, hia very real achievaments are not

by essence of the apoctacular variety.

subject's reporting has been satisfactory and continue to

be copious.

He could, hovever.. further improve the selectivity

of the leads provided the station and make more of an effort to

"Jigout" c..e

intoration contained in his roports.

Although subject has, at present, no supervisory functlon.

he has repeatadly requested such a responsibillty.

He is caroful

During the parlod under raviow, additional efforts have been

made to make full use of subject's potential and integrate hia

further in the work of the station componant with which he rocks.

He is a particularly valuable asset for the Station programs:
