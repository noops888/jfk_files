have dlways considered CASASIN to be‘ a highly skilled, experienced
senior case officer thoroughly devoted to the work of BKHERALD.

He 16 becoming increasingly effective in his present, cover position
at operating against both Soviet and PKC targets, and IL

an delighted that he has agreed to continue hie couperation with
the Station as a field agent following nis rétirément from
“BKHERALD effective 30 June 1974, CASASIN can look back with pride
over his years of service with BKHERALD but he can also look
-forvard to additional years of highly useful, productive work for

“Paris Station,

CASASIN's attitude can best be summed up-by a comment on ay
first operational meeting with. him following his official retire-
ment. He-instinctively went immediately to a discussion of.
operations, not of retirement. I am confident that CASASIN will

continue to be a highly motivated, effective asset of Paris Station,

and I wish him well.

I concur with the supervisor's letter ratings and with the substance
of his narrative comments, ‘Put’ as siuply as possible, Subject ‘has done
an outstanding job-in establishing superb access cover; it now remains
for him and the Station to exploit it operationally. On the basis of
his ability during the reporting period: to establish meaningful
relationships with target Soviets or tc spot and assess leads to
potential agents who can, Subject's retention is this assignment would
net be justified in terms of costs. The 402 rebate does make this effor
entirely defensible, however, buf Subject should understand that we

[EGUMENTS OF BEVIEWING OFFICIAL

The Staticn submitted comments -on Subject officer recently in OF?T-
16549 (8 April 1971), to which we should add that Subject has, largely
on his own merits, acquired a solid and potentially highly useful
cover employment, However, this new employment will demand a very
substantial amount of time and energy from sibject, and the unanswere
able question at ths moment relates to his availability for Organiza—
tional tasks. We shall need additional time and careful working with
this officer to determine the answer, since the fiscal outlay from the
Organization to support his continued stay in Paris is still quite

Although Subject has, at present, no supervisory funct loa, j
he has repeatedly requested such a responsibility. He is careful
with operational expenses ‘and has exercised good security.

During the period under review, additional efforts have been
made to make full use. of subject's potential and integrate hia

: On the fitnoss report itself, this rater would have p=
an "s° rating for specific duty number one; Subject may ultinately
deserve an "0", but it does not seem warranted at the present time..
Moreover, I believe the overall rating would more properly have
been in the higher range of the “P" category, rather than °s",

but it is of course a subjective judgment of the rating officer,
who is more intimately and directly involved with subject'on a

frequent basis.

In sum, the cover is superb, and only time will reveal to
what extent the cover requirements permit a full measure on be=- {

Virtually unlimited access to Para interest to us, both .
Soviet and potential access agents. In evaluating tho manner’ in:
which the exployee set up and managed this cover, I would tend to
agree with his.comentsa to the fitness report on the «°°;
Geniids on hin although these comments are scmwhat éverdravn.

The principal difficulty has boon the time it haa taken to
relate the cover potential to the speciiie operational coyutre=
ments of the Station. We havo not received trom CASASIN as . |
leads andassessment reports to persons of operational interest
in the se? field a1 .wa think he could ‘have produced. It may be
that the earlier listing of the project (viewed as a regional
undertaking) contributed to this.

Recently we have noted significant improvement in that we
have received responses to requests wo have made for assessment
and development of potential access agents within a cover context.
We hops, therefore, that this last year of CASASIN's stay will
be the most productive ever. It is unfortunate that the cover
sust. and because of tha cover company's decisions over which wo
had no control.

After_all, the cover position is to thém a lecitimate, normal,
workaday post in their firm. What work is done at their bidding,
it follows, must be accoaplished according to the high standards
of thoroughness and accuracy which they have set.

In the case of -(b) -- which derives frez (a) -- and can prove to
be so demanding that the necds of the CS could no longer -be served,
the incumbent is required to manage a span of huzan contacts at
several levels in order to preserve his cover position and enhance
its value to the CS, This means planning, directing and _

managing the work of multinational, multicultural teams of
technical correspondents, as well as meetings and negotiations to
improve the (cover firm's] relations with similarly widespread

viduals at the levels of editor-in-chief, publisher, corporate

societies.

Having previously managed both a CS base and the principal denied~
areas operating couponent of a major field Station, I can report
quite honestly that ny present managerial responsibilities exceed
the former -- despite the apparent lack of "supervisory
responsibilities" in my present position.

: sacTicy ¢ NARRATIVE coments

- The ecoignnent, of thts: ‘employes to the field
was designed to. ‘edmpensate for the losa of ‘an etiployee in an offictal cover
slot which was cut from thé Statian’s ODACID-allotment of porsonnel positions,

During the: reporting period thie employee has ‘as éonpLtianod with success
tho convincing establishment of ‘his cover in.a complex milieu, and had ‘been
eocepted as. legitimate by his professional colleagues, the pereons whom he. _
meots under cover, and the Frenoh authorities. It should be noted that Lis i
ability to assume his cover has been largely the result of his om offorts .
over a period of yéars to acquire and uaintain a faniliarity with the general ‘i

eolentific field.

During the reporting pertod-he has developed a wide otrole of contacte
in the wotentific and joumalistic fields and applies a long background in
@ variety of assignments in KUDOVE to the determination and asseasment of
LE operational potential azcng these contacts, At the sane time hie cover
organization, in which only four persons are witting of hia sotual status,
has-ahow itself to be more than aatisfied with hia performance of his cover

. duties. :
This employee requires a cinimum of dotatiea operational supervision
it 16 necessary in spooifie cases only to indicate the ciel ceed or infor-
mational objectives.

From the point of view of administrative support, his attenticn to
detail and metioulousness reduce the problems of his support by the Station
to a minimum.

‘This exployee uses the French language continuously, and his facility

ia such as to perwit him to handle himself excellently in a broad of
@omplex technical subjects. He has in addition undertaken specialized

~ Language training to dovelop thio capability further. Hia operational re-
porting is excellent both with regard to clarity and pertinence, -

In the immediate future he will be assigned cass work, for the nost
part in fields wibre it will complement, and be complemented by, his in- ae
dependent operational sotivities and cover work.

COURSE OLJECTIVES ~ CONTENT AND METHODS zt
The Management Course is designed to fainiliarize scnior line arid

“ staff managers with-both the thoory and the practical problems of

managecent in CIA. The tinderlyirg assumption of the course is that
manugenent devclorment is a process of growth on the jeb. Tho course,
however, enables the farticipents to exsmine their job activities in
an environment.where, gaided ty the instructors, they can critically
examine their oim actions, exchaies ideas with managers from other
conponents, and develop an understanding of the complex ro!stionrhips
that exist axong the peopie, the pattern of organization, aud the
purposes of the Agency. The course approaches the preblens of

“management in the Agency by discussing the formal and informal structures,

concepts of leadership and comrinication, the problens of personnel
managemont, and theories of planning and controlling. These subjects
are related as closely as possible to the activities of the class members.

The content of the course is developed throug) lectures, case and
group discussions, filmed presentations, and problem-solving exercises.

American Hospital on 20 February. Since, because of

his cover there could be no LNHARP connection, CASASIN's dependents
made arrangements for their physicals as private cttizens, on the
pretense that they required state: nts that they were in good
