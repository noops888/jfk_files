Review of LIFFAT and LIE:

i. Here is the KUYUBE draft paper prepared by Paul ¥. LEVISTER
after hig recent vistt to your station, It has nad the bencfit of
valuable suggestions from the cesx. It hws buen read with daterest by

is senior ZU8ALK officers who thinx tho paper tllustrates the essentials,
of gvod tap operations. The etress of the paper is on latelligeuce
collection, but come mention bad to be unde of operntious! leads and
CI/CE information, otherwise we would have had only a partial picture
of the operations. fe will appreciate any comments or corrections you
wish to mate, so vant to present the true facts and convey the right

iapression.

4. Finally, there vas the question of the Polish lines, on which
the files are mystifying. The 1960 Project Kenewal reyuest mentions
LITENSOR'a desire to cover those as well as the other two, but subso-
guent correspondence omits all mention of Polish lincs. Did he really
gention the Folish target? If 00, how did ve manage to get out of it?

5. The tough probles, of course, will be to sanitize tho paper
without dowagradiag the operations. The essence of the message is
that so much can be done, and done well, by relatively few people,
provided these few people have tho right ezills and sufficient drive.

We might omit sll references to Latia America, the Spanish iacguage,

and Cuban case officers; te might even throw in a fev misleading phrases
like “the {er-away Cuban target." Ye certainly vould not want tlie
location to be recognized except by persoas already ianiiiar with the
operstions. We will be guided by your vishes in this and other aspects:

ox tne paper.
