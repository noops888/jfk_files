8.

Gerald Patrick HEMMING is well known to this Agency,

the Office of Security Miami Field Office, and JNVAVE.

On

numerous occasions since at least the early 1960's, HEMING

had clained Agency affiliation when in fact there has bees

попе.

The most recent incident wherein HEMMING claimed such

affiliation was in May 1975 when he volunteered his services

to the Drug Enforcement Administration.

Gerald Patrick HEMMING

is a long-time cohort of Frank Anthony STURGIS (SF#353 459),

the late 1950's HENNING and STURGIS, both former U.S. Narines,

joined Fidel CASTRO in Cuba but returned shortly thereafter

claiming disillusionment with the CASTRO cause.

Soon thereafter,

STURGIS organized a group of mercenaries for Caribbean and

Central American activities which he named the International

Anti-Connunist Brigade.

the Internationa!

A reported sub-unit of this "Brigade"

(the backers of whom have never been fully established) was

named the Intercontinental Penetration Force, headed by Gerald

Patrick HEMMING.

9.

For an appreciation of the possible ramifications of

a Guatemalan government expose of this assassination plot

involving HENMING, you are referred to attachments to instant

memorandum, to wit: a memorandum by the writer dated 10 June

1975 in the name of Frank STURGIS and Everett Howard HUNT, Jr.;

and an extract from a book published in early 1976 written by

Michael CANFIELD and Alan J. WEBERMAN. The book Coup ennedy

in America--The CIA and the Assassination of John F.

links attempted by the authors

through Everett Howard HUNT,

JI. to Frank STURGIS to Gerald Patrick HEMING to Loran Eugene

HALL.

Loran Eugene HALL was a member of HEMMING's Interconti-

nental Penetration Force.

Loran Eugene HALL received nationwide

publicity in 1967 when New Orleans District Attorney "Jim"

GARRISON alleged that HALL (and the Intercontinental Penetration

Force) was involved in the assassination of President KENNEDY

and that members of this unit were connected with CIA. GARRISON

shortly thereafter dropped his interest in HALL, but it is

interesting that he did so after Gerald Patrick HEMMING and

another cohort, Robert K. BROWN, joined GARRISN's investigation.
