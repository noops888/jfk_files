CRYPTOGRAPHIC CLEARANCE - BRIEFING STATEMENT

1. I, (print)

HOWARD

HUNT, SA.

about to be authorized to have custody of, access to, or knowledge of KUBARK

staff cryptographic material or information, and fully understanding that the

preservation of the security of cryptographic material or Information 1s vital

to the national interests of the United States, do solely swear (or affirm)

and declare without any mental reservations whatsoever that I will protect the

security of such material or information to the best of my ability, and that I

will not disclose such material or Information to any unauthorized person. I

understand that the only persons authorized to have custody of, aucess to, or

knowledge of KUBARK staff cryptographic material or information are those who

hold a current KUBARK cryptographic clearance and need the speuific material

or information for the proper performance of their official duties.

2. I further swear (or affirm) that I will also protect to the best of

my abllity the securlty of the cryptographic naterial or Information of other

U. S. Government agencies should I gain possession or knowledge of such material

or information as the result of my performance of KUBARK cryptographic duties

or in any other manner.

3. I will thoroughly familiarize myself with the pertinent communications

security regulations, instructions, and principles which govern the proteotion

of cryptographic material or information. I will at all times provide the re-

quired degree of physical security in the handling of the material to ensure

that 1t does not fall into unauthorized hands or be exposed to or otherwise

be made known to unauthorized persons.

4o I have read the provisions of Public Law 513 of 13 May 1950. I under-

stand that I am bound by that Act, both presently and also after the termination

of my employnent with KUBARK and/or the revocation of my cryptographic clearance.

I fully understand that improper disclosure or loss of cryptographic material

or information could subject me to punishment under the provisions of that Act,

or as provided by the appropriate regulations and practices of KUBARK.

5. I understand that a cryptographic clearance is not a permanent clear-

ance, that it will be revoked immediately should I fail to maintain the required

security standards, or for lack of need or for other substantial reasons.

understand that revocation of my cryptographic clearance bars me automatically

from further access to cryptographic information, but does not release me from

my obligation to protect the security of cryptographic information, the know-

ledge of which I might still retain.
