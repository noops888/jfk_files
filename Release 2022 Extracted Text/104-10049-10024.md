MEMORANDUM®

SUBJECT: Frank FIORINI - STURGIS'

Following is information from further review of FIORINI's

official file in response to Daniel E. Schultz' inquiry to

the Agency dated 27 September 1973.

There are four volumes to FIORINI's 201 file, the

majority of its content being reports from the FBI dated

from 1958 through April 1969.

Agency information includes a cable from Santiago de Cuba

dated 7 January 1959 stating FIORINI claims to be chief of

26 July Arms buyer Miami and willing cooperate 100 percent

in supplying info.

Cable stated it possible FIORINI may lose

value to rebels but believe worthwhile CIA endorse his staying

on. Hqs CIA replied that FIORINI had been under FBI

investigation for possible registration act violations and

base should deal with FIORINI under strict Consular cover

and not make any commitments which might later be construed

as USGOVT approval his activities. Wish to reiterate here

that FIORINI was never employed by the CIA.

The following is worthy of note. FIORINI was involved

in Nov/Dec 61 leafIet dropping flights over Cuba. . The FBI

queried CIA about allegations that the flights by FIORINI and

Alexander RORKE, Jr., were entirely supported by CIA with CIA

arranging Air/Sea rescue, and that all of FIORINI's actions

were known to CIA Miami and his activities being done on CIA

instructions. Has CIA was satisfied allegations not true but

troubled in view fact FIORINI was in contact with CIA rep

Florida who used name "Barker" who supposedly gave FIORINI

phone number for CIA Miami office. FIORINI was to call this

number if he was arrested or stopped on flights and CIA would

"get him out".

These Cuban overflights were not authorized

by CIA and the FBI was alerted to fact it was not CIA

operation. (BARKER was generally known in Miami Cuban exile

community as a CIA source.) Since BARKER was a close friend

of FIORINI, BARKER, shortly before the Bay of Pigs invasion;

was asked by CIA to attempt to obtain from FIORINI information

concerning FIORINI's activities. BARKER met with FIORINI

several times a month from fall of 61 to July 62. BARKER

insisted when queried by CIA case officer, that he never

revealed classified info or operational data including JMWAVE

phone numbers to FIORINI. FIORINI told BARKER that the

leaflet op was conceived by Sergio ROJAS. A Hqs cable to

JMWAVE dated July 1962 stated that ROJAS had been non-operational

since Feb.

62.
