ZRRIFLE/QJWIN

Summary Chronology

ummary

ZRRIFLE is ostensibly a program to rectruit criminals for teams
hich could break into §Romentenwenbastesmecmsteaimcodes. However,
here is evidence in the files that this purpose, though useful to
he Agency, was in reality a cover for another operation. From other
ources, it appears that the real purpose was at least kidnapping and
ossibly murder.

ZRRIFLE was run out of the (coypeotoeutsy counterintelligence shop
(iNstongoy in the Bureau of Foreign Intelligence. It began sometime
n 1960/early-1961 and lasted until at least mid-1963, although
‘ayments to its principal agent QJWIN were continued into 1964.

ZRRIFLE appears to have been part of a larger set of programs

ents which included at least one other SOUS ATNERA who in fact

1. What was your responsibility in regard to (Division D:
of the FI Division? Would you describe its functions?

@Sionsy in the Congo in late 1960? Wouldn't you have
to approve such a project?

3. Have you ever heard of project ZRRIFLE or an agent by
the name of QJWIN? Would you describe your recollections?

4, Did you askf nell in 1960 to recruit an agent in
Europe (use real name if necessary) to assassinate
Patrice Lumumba? To kidnap him?

5. Did you cause to be delivered to the CIA station in the
Congo in late 1960 a quantity of poison or a biological
agent for the purpose of killing Patrice Lumumba?

6. Could these things have happened without your knowledge?

7. Have you ever heard the term "Executive Action"? If so,
@ explain meaning and circumstances.

8. Do you recall a meeting on January 25 and 26, 1961, where
Executive Action was discussed?

9. What do you make of these handwritten notes?

10. What do you make of the handwritten note that says
"ZRRIFLE started in 1961 on Bissell's say-so"?

lI. Did you ever authorize a program to (Break, into, cabassies §
abroad? To recruit people for that purpose? How high up
would such a project be approved? Be known?

12. Would you know if such a supposed counterintelligence
operations were in fact a cover for an assassination
capability? If not, why not? If so, explain.

13. Do you recall any discussion of the use of Executive Action,

ZRRIFLE, QJWIN, (the agent's real name), in connection
with plans to assassinate Trujillo or Castro?

HW 50955 DocId:32201957 Page 3


This is apparently based on 1967 CIA Study which states that
Harvey said that early in the Kennedy Administration

"Bissell called him in to discuss what Harvey refers
to as an Executive Action Capability, i.e., a general
stand by capability to carry out assassinations when
required. Harvey's notes quote Bissell as saying
"the White House has twice urged me to create such a
capability.'"

It should also be noted that ZRRIFLE was not a covert action but
was conducted under the aegis of counterintelligence--for which no

formal mechanisms of high-level review appear to exist, even today.)

(Comment: Apart from the handwritten notes and Ggsz
there is nothing to suggest assassination was the purpose of ZRRIFLE. On
the other hand, there is also no suggestion that the "candidates" developed
by QJWIN ever did any "jobs" for the Agency.

However, the Inspector General's Report of 1973 (First pages of

its purpose as an Executive Action operation. It alleges (with no
reference as to source) that:

“trhe White House’ urged Richard Bissell to create an
Executive Action capability; i.e., a general stand-by
capability to carry out assassinations. The Executive
Action program came to be known as ZRRIFLE. Its principal
