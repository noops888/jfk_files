mately May, 1965 to the fall of 1968. . .

affairs? :

Mr. Weatherby. I have not. .

Mr. Baron. Drawing your. attention now to the veriod of
time when you were working on Cuban affairs, in what office of
the CIA were you doing this work?

Mr. Weatherby. Desmond FitzGerald and also William
Harvey who preceeded Desmond FitzGerald.

Mr. Baron. When did FitzGerald take over from Harvey?

Mr. Weatherby. I believe it was in the late spring of
1963. I am not certain.

Mr. Baron. And can you describe the structure of Task
Force Wat the time that you jeinéd it under Harvey's direction4

Mr. Weatherby. I conld tell you only about the unit in
which I belonged to.

Mr. Baron. What unit was that?

Mr. Weatherby. That was Third Country operations, which
concered obviously operations against Cubans in countries other
than Cuba or the United States.

Mr. BAron. Did that unit have a cryptonym?

Mr. Weatherby. It did not.

Mr. Baron. What was it known as in Agency jargon?

Mr. Weatherby. I do not remember. It was an operational

section, but the exact nomenclature I do not recall.

Mr Baron. And its purpose was to work in relation to
Cubans or Cuban affairs in countries other than the United
States or Cuba?

Mr. Weatherby. That is correct.

Mr. Baron. Do you know how many such sections there were
within Task Force W?

Mr. Baron. Yes.

(Discussion off the record.)

Mr. Baron. Go ahead.

Mr. Weatherby. Let me say during my period of time there,
which was some thirteen years ago, there were a number of
Deputies and they have slipped my recall. re I do recall it,
I will pass it to the record.

Mr. Baron. Have you had a chance to refresh your recol-
lection: generally about your activities on Task Force WN?

Mr. Weatherby. I have not. I was informed of this
interview yesterday afternoon, late.

Mr. Baron. Did you have.a chance to read the IG Report
before you came here today?

Mr. Weatherby. I did read that this morning.

Mr. Baron. And what sections of the IG Report did you
read?

Mr. Weatherby. I read only those portions that concerned
my activities with AMLASH.-

Mr. Baron. About how many pages would that have been?

Mr. Weatherby. I think ahout six to ten.

Mr. Baron. And did you discuss your coming here today to

answer questions before the Committees with anyone who is not

Mr. Weatherby. That's correct.

Mr. Baron. And can you relate to us the major points that
you discussed with the case officer who has testified before
us recently?

Mr. Weatherby: Yes, I can. I purposefully did not
discuss my portion of the operation with him on advice of the
Office of General Counsel. I talked to him in general terms
about, frankly, you fellows and your personalities, what I
could expect, and we related at lunch today old times since we
have not seen each other for probably at least .six or seven
years. But I should like to reiterate we did not discuss each

Mr. Baron. At any point, did anyone at the CIA tell you
what to say here today?

Mr. Weatherby. Absolutely not. In fact, if I might
add, they cautioned me, they told me they were not going to
say because that is against the rules. They made a very strong
point of that.

Mr. Baron. So we have then the understanding of the
fact that you have been asked to testify on very short notice
and that your recollection. might not be pinpoint precise as
far as names and dates go? ;

Mr, Weatherby. Thanks, that is correct.

Mr, Baron. But we will try to do as ‘much as we can to
refresh your recollection as we move through the events we are
discussing.

Mr. Weatherby. Yas.

I should like to point out for the record that I have not
worked in Latin American Affairs before nor afterwards, and that
it has been some thirteen years since I delved into this
material, so, therefore, please bear with me, if ‘my answers
are not as complete perhaps as you wish. I shall do my best.

Mr. Baron. Turning back to the subject of the structure
of Task Force W, you were unable to recall the name of the
Deputy to work under Harvey. Do you recall who took over as

the Deputy under FitzGerald?

Mr. Baron. Would that have been Samuel Halpern?

Mr, Weatherby. Samuel Halpern was an Executive Officer,
I do believe, who was essentially divorced from operations.

Mr. Baron. Would it have been Bruce Cheever?

Mr. Weatherby. That'is ‘correct.

Mr. Baron. And Bruce Cheever was the Deputy Chief of

Task Force W during the entire period that you served on Task

Force W?

Mr. Weatherby. That is correct. I believe he had a
short tenure as Chief until Mr. Hart took over, John Hart.

Mr. Baron. When did John Hart take over as Chief of
Task Force W?

Mr. Weatherby. It was quite near the end of my time on
it, so I would say approximately in early spring 1965.

Mr. Baron. For how much of this time did you work on
Project AMLASH?.

Mr. Weatherby. I worked on that project shortly after I
came aboard on the assignment, which would have been June--
1962, through turning it over to the previously mentioned
AMLASH Case Officar in September, 1963.

Mr. Baron. ‘This case officer is the man who testified
here under the alias of Garmire?

Mr. Weatherby. I continued to handle Third Country
Operations, excluding this particular operation, in a support
capacity.

Mr. Baron. With whom did you work on those operations?

Mr, Weatherby. We worked, we were a focal point in a,
and a coordination péint with, the various desks of the

countries involved. I cannot recall the people on the desks

at that time.

Mr. Baron. Were you responsible for operations, or was
this simply support activities?

Mr. Weatherby. It was, in the bureaucratic structure
that we have I was responsible for providing guidance for
operations which were run by the individual country desks in
their countries.

Mr. Baron. Did you work out of CIA headquarters at
Langley?

Mr. Weatherby. That is correct.

Mr. Baron. Were you at any time stationed in Florida?

Mr. Weatherby. I was not.

Mr. Baron. During the period of time that you worked on
Project AMLASH, were there any other CIA officers who worked
closely with you?

Mr. Weatherby. Not at that time, with the exception of

Mr. Maurelius who provided guidance, and subordinate officers

information of that nature that contributed for a better

Mr. Baron. Would you assume generally that Mr.
Maurelius would be intimately familiar with any operation: that
you were running under Project AMLASH?:

Mr. Weatherby. I do not think I would ~- I would ask you
to clarify the term “intimate.”

Mr. Baron, Would he be aware of tha major=contacts you
were making and any significant support to those contacts?

Mr. Weatherby. I should say at the time, yes, any major
aspect of it. It would be difficult for him to follow every
operation of every officer in complete detail.

Mr. Baron. But he would generally be aware of any
significant development of your activities on Project AMLASH
and in your relationships with your contacts inside Cuba?

Mr. Weatherby. Yes, sir.

Mx. Baron. Would he in turn have made the Chief of Task
Force W aware of any such significant developments?

Mr. Weatherby. Of significant developments, yes.

Mr. Baron. And was it a frequent practice for you to
xeport directly to the Chief of Task Force W and to his
Deputy and bypass Mr. Maurelius?

Mr. Weatherby. As a matter of course, no. In answer to
general questions of a professional’ interest, how I was doing,

and how the operation was going, I could be-called in on an

Mr. Weatherby. Mr. Maurelius is deceased. He died three

days ago.

Mr. Baron. And do you know where Mr. Cheever is now?

Mr. Weatherby. I do not. I think he may be someplace
in the Southwest. Heiis retired.

Mr. Baron. I would like to review with you a few events
that occurred before you joined Project AMLASH, but about which
you may have become knowledgeable after you joined the Project.
Starting in March of 1961, the IG report indicates that GE
ep) who was a CIA officer assigned to Mexico City, met
agent AMLASH in Mexico City to sound him out generally on his
views about the Cuban situation.

. Do you recall anything that you learned about contacts
between SEREREED ana AMLASH in Mexico City?

Mr. Waatherby. No, I do not, other than what appears in
the paper which you have just quoted from or referred to.

Mr. Baron. Were you aware of the reasons why that contact

took place?

Mr. Baron, Do you remember ever learning about the source

of the initiation for that meeting? Did it come, in other

Mr. Weatherby. To the best of my recollection, from an

intermediary. _

Mr. Baron. Would that have been a man whose eryptonym

Mr. Weatherby. Yes.

Mr. Baron. Do you know whether the CIA had contact with
Carlos Tepedino prior to the time they came into contact with
AMLASH?

Mr. Weatherby. I don't -- I do not think it was on a
professional basis. He may have known people in Havana Station
on a social basis.

Mr. Baron. Do you recall being briefed about the state
of contacts with agent AMLASH at the time that you took over as

having never worked with Latins before and mostly with
Germanic types; I prefered to form my own conclusions.

Mr. Baron. Do you'recall, however, being made aware by
any source before you came in contact with AMLASH that he had
a propensity to assassinate Castro or any leanings in that
direction.

Mr. Waatherby. I recall only that he perhaps had said or
made statements that he was totally dissatisfied with Castro
and I do not recall from my own memory if he used the word
assassinate as you did.

Mr. Baron. Whether or not he used the word assassinate,
at the time you took over the contact with AMLASH, would you
have assumed that this was someone who was at least capable
of doing that sort of thing?

Mr. Weatherby. I think if I can recall correctly that
my impression of the man was that he was quite mercurial and
I did not understand him well enough to know whether that was
whiskey talk or an expression or a Latin exaggeration. I

remember saying that I had got to see the man and talk to him

18 Mr. Baron. What was that program about?

21 | to produce information from dissidents, or perhaps even to

22 forming a group which would be capable of replacing the then

Mr. Weatherby, I think the program was in effect, or it
was concurrently started. I do not recall honestly.

Mr. Baron. Do you recall whether your assignment ‘to work
with AMLASH was for the purpose of maintaining his participation
in the project MHAPRON, or did it have some independent purpose

Mr. Weatherby. The original purpose, to tha best of
my recollection, was to oversees his defection, and to monitor
him through northern Europe, with’ which I was familiar, and to
help in a planned dafaction speech, et cetera, in some ‘Western
European country.

Mr. Kelley. The word "defection", can that have more than
one meaning? The meaning, the obvious meaning, is that the
person leaves his country and comes to another one. Is there
another meaning that he becomes disaffected from the government
er the country in which he resides but stays there?

Mr. Weatherby. That is correct.

There is two, there are two defections, which means he
defects from their ranks and becomes overtly an amigre from
his country, and the other term would be to defect in place
which is in effect means he becomes a recruited agent.

Mr. Kelley. And in your later testimony, would you keep
those two meanings in mind.and tell us if you use the word
“defect,” which one we are talking about?

Mr. Weatherby. Yes, sir.



TOP SECRET

ae *
\., é 1 the original purpose of the AMLASH operation, you used the
3
3 2 word defect. What was, the meaning at this time?
3 3 Mr. Weatherby. The original, the original intent when he
4 was sent to Helsinki was to aid in the defection, meaning for
5 the man to leave Cuba and Fidel Castro's ranks and come to the
6 West in the classic sense.
va Mr. Baron. One more question on project MHAPRON,
8 Do you recall:whether one of the goals of that project
9 would have been to support an attempt by high Cuban military
10 officers to initiate a coup against the Castro regime by killing
LL the leadership?
i 12 My. Weatherby. I would say no. The killing of the

13 leadership was never a prerequisite for replacement of the

WARD & PAUL

14 government.
15 Mr. Baron. Whether or not it was a prerequisite, would

16 it have been one acceptable means of initiating a coun?

1? Mr. Weatherby. I would say not.
18 Mr. Baron. Why not?
19 Mr. Weatherby. Because that was not, as far as I know in

20-| any paper I had ever read, or any directive I had ever seen.
21 Mr. Baron. What kinds of directives did you have as to
22) the means that should be used by contacts established through

other words, the means to be used. I think before that is
going to be even addressed, you have got to loék at the people
and assets yau have, and determine what course of action might
be taken.

Mr. Baron. So that you would tailor a course of action
against Castro to the specific characteristics and capabilities

of the contacts with whom you were dealing, is that correct?

Mr. Weatherby. One could do that. -

Mr- Baron. Would that have been a normal operating
procedure for you at that time? ,

Mr. Weatherby. I would think that, that that follows
from my previous statement that any activity would have to be
looked at in the context of the paople who might be available
“and willing to do it.

Mr. BAron. So that you are saying certainly a major
factor in determining what kind of operation to arrange with
a Cuban contact would be the character and capability of that

contact?

Mr. Weatherby. I would think that that is an accurate
statement.

Mr. Baron. Did you carry on projects MHAPRON at the
point when you joined Task Force W;, did you hava operational
responsibility for that project?

Mr. Weatherby. I did not. That was an overall project,

podfad aye my capacity, did not run that program. ~

Mr. Baron. Was Project AMLASH considerad a sub-unit of
MHAPRON, a subproject?,

Mr. Weatherby. It fell into that broad category, but to
the best of my knowledge it was not an integral part of that
program which in itself was really a mechanism for looking at
the problem, and AMLASH was @ separate entity at the concept -

pardon me, at the inception, of course, it was a defection

operation.

Mr. Baron. In relation to just one man?

Mr. Weatherby. Yes.

Mr. Baron. And Project AMLASH throughout velated
essentially to the use of just one high-ranking Cuban military
officer, is that correct?

Mr. Weatherby. That's correct, as the principal person
involved. ,

Mr. Baron. In your attempts to aid the defection of
AMLASH, dia you ever come in contact with a man named Juan
Orta?

Mr. Weatherby. I did not.

He was a large man, and perhaps flamboyant is not the correct

Mx. Weatherby. I would think it was certainly one of the
most promising and one in which I put the most time, but it
was the kind of a case which was on again, off again. When
the man was out and we could talk to him, it was a full-time

job. And then it would just almost go into abeyance for months

ata time.

Mr. Baron. Despite the amount of time that you put in

same way about it?

Mr. Baron. Was it also a case that was important enough
to be subject to inquiries from the DDP?

Mr. Weatherby. I would think so.

Mr. Baron. But you don't have any direct . recollection of
inquiries by the DDP, or do you?

Mr. Weatherby. I do not have any direct ~- I am sure
there was interest shown because of the potent{a1 it showed.
After all, the man was probably number four in the government.
at that time.

Mr. Kelley. That's the way you conceived of him, you
realized that he was number four? ,

Mr. Weatherby. Yes.

Mr. Kelley. You treated him, in other words, you were

four man?

Mr. Weatherby. I thought he was. I think most people

Mr. Kelley. This meant that after Fidel, Raul and Che,

that your meeting was not observed by members of Castro's

1962 in Helsinki?

Mr. Weatherby. Yes.

The purpose, the initial purpose of my going over, as has
been pointed out, was to arrange for the defection of a
prominent Cuban revolutionary with maximum publicity for the
West.

In talking to him -- and again, we are stretching back
over thirteen years from memory -- he was stillsvery much
interested in that. He was fed up with the sale of the
vevolution by Castro to the Russians, and it didn't represent
what he thought he had been fighting for with the old DR at
the time they overthrew Batista.

He had a thread throughout his thinking though that he
would, he would rather, if there was a reason, he would rather
stay and change events in Cuba, if he possibly, if this
possibly. could be done.. In other words, to put the revolution
back in its proportions as he had contributed to it and he
imagined it should have bean. But he didn't have a real plan
and he didn't, he wasn't sure how to accomplish this. The
purpose became then to keep him in place rather than defect
him, because an agent in place is always worth a qreat deal
more than one who defects.

As you probably have heard, you get a debriefing of what

he knows, you get a little Press play, and that's the efid of

it with the man normally except the contacts he might have and

so forth, but an agent in place is worth a great deal more.

This then became my assignment, was to convince him to
stay in place and to report to us.

Mr. Baron. Do you recall what kind of proposals he may
have made or prospects he may have raised ahout operations
that would have been significant enough to merit his staying
inside Cuba instead of defecting?

Mr.. Weatherby. Well, he wanted to overthréw Castro, he
wanted to change the regime, or at the very. least’ bring Castro
around to his concept of the revolution.

Mr. Baron. Did ‘he ever mention that as a realistic
possibility, bringing Castro around to his concept?

Mr. Weatherby. Not really. He discussed it, but I don't
think he really beliaved it.

Mr. Baron. And how likely did he feal at the time the
prospect was of leading a widespread coup against Castro?

Mr. Weatherby. You know, 1 don't think he even thought
that far. He was -- it was interesting. He was mercurial
at times, thoughtful, and methodical in turn. He had a great
Many things evolving in his mind, none of which were practical,

none of which he could tie down. One of the interesting parts

of meeting him was to attempt to sort out what the man really

balance of the tima that I was with him.

Mr. Weatherby. I like to think he meant to get rid of

obviously blood will be shed on both sides.

Mr. Baron. Was it not clear that whether or not he at
that time had a specific plan or a specific intention to
proceed to eliminate Castro by taking his life, he was interested
in the prospect of having support for such an operation if
it could be mounted?

Mr. Weatherby. He was interested in, as he put it, and
again we are talking dover 13 years, in getting rid of the man's

regime, and he didn't limit himself to any particular method,

Mr. Baron. .But was assassination, though perhaps mentioned
by other names, one means that was acceptable to him of
getting rid of Castro?

whether you wrote those excerpts?

Mr. Weatherby. If it came from the file, sir, I an

Mr. Baron. And do you have any independent recollection
of writing this document or of the events referred to in it?

Mr. Weatherby. I don't have a personal recollection of
these subjects in a discussion with him until I have seen
the paper again.

Mr. Baron. Now that you are looking at this excerpt
from your contact report, do you recall that AMLASH felt that
he would be interested in returning to Cuba and in risking his
life by doing so, “if he could be given a really large part
to play"? ;

if necessary." .

Do you recali his expressing that feeling to you?

Mr. Weatherby. JI do not recall today his expressing the
feeling in the words in the exhibit. However, I believe that
that represents at least a portion of his thoughts at the time,
only as an idea or an expression of the degree to which he
felt he wanted to do something and was totally frustrated in
doing it. I mean, just look at the large list he has, and --

Mr. Baron. What large list are you referring to?

Mr. Weatherby. The one there in which he talks about
Rodriguez and the Ambassador and Fidel. I mean there is
no ~- as I say, I believe that represented a feeling he had
that he has to get rid of these people in some manner.

Mr. Baron. Do you really characterize this list of three
people that appear to be carefully selected as a large list
of targets, or doesn't it appear to be, as I said, a fairly
careful selection of key people whose elimination would
seriously affect the stability of- the Cuban government?

Mr. Weatherby. Wo, I don't feel that way. If I may digreg
a little for the record, I think it is an expression of his
frustration simply because it isn't a diabolical scheme the
man is talking about if, in fact, he talked about these people

because he's probably upset with the Soviets there. Therefore,

one in, and that doesn't do anything to the stability there.
And if you get rid of Carlos Rodriguez, Rodriguez didn't have

a great following of his own, he was somebody that was probably
a principal that came to his mind and, of course, Fidel as
the head of state represents something to him that he would
like to have changed.

In other words, I'm trying to say that when you deal with
aman like this and you have not met him very much, you have
to let the man express himself, you have got to find out
by questioning what he really means, what's really bothering
him, what does he really want to do. Does he have any plans,
how deep is his thinking, is he just an emotional type?

Mr. Baron. But isn't it significant in some way that --
strike that.

Wouldn't his desire to plan the execution of Fidel Castro
have appeared to” you at that time significant in light of the
fact that you included it in your contact report?

Mr. Weatherby. His statement there represents to me again
as I have said before, the degree of emotion that he felt
about the problem in Cuba and the Cuban situation politically
as it turned out. A contact report, which is a piece of paper
basically to refresh the case officer's mind about what took
place, I wouldn't, I wouldn't read into it too much.

Mr. Baron. Nonetheless, didn't you see his expression of

this desire to eliminate Fidel by execution, if necessary,

significant enough so that there should be some record of it?

Mr. Weatherby. I thought that it certainly should be
a matter of record to indicate his degree of concern, certainly,
And it also became a point for me to dissuade him of at that
time.

Mr. Baron. In the same contact report you indicated that
you were “making no commitments or plans," but that you were
pointing out to AMLASH "that schemes like he envisions certainly
had their place,’ but that a lot of coordination, planning,
information collection, etcetera were necessary prerequisites
to ensure the value and success of such plans."

Doesn't that indicate that his mention of eliminating
Fidel and other key figures in Cuba at that time were at least
considered by you to have had a place in future contacts with
AMLASH?

Mr. Weatherby. Absolutely not, in that case. What you
have got to do with a man like this who may have thoughts of
that intensity, or even register thoughts of that intensity
is not disabuse him immediately of his thinking because if
“I want him for something else I can't make a -- I would be --
it would be poor planning to alienate the man right away if
I immediately turn off the idea he has. And this is all in
one meeting, don't forget, as best as I recall. I have got

like that it takes, if someone is going to do anything it
takes coordination and planning and etcetera. And you have
got to gradually take the man from an intense thought and
perhaps mold it into something that can work, or something
that is acceptable.

In other words, I wouldn't.

Mr. Baron. Doesn't the language here, though, indicate
that although you may have wanted to mold his deSires into a
workable plan, the fact that he had mentioned desire: to eliminat:
Castro by execution, if necessary, wasn't something that was
rejected out of hand, that. it might be something that you
would want to work into a usable plan.

Mr. Weatherby. Well, I think we are a little out of
context by looking at just this excerpt. I think you have to
look at Castro to see how it develops and what is said in a
few words ina contact report, which is not verbatim, you
would acknowledge should not be taken absolutely literally.

Mr. Baron. You have mentioned that these events were
a long time ago.

Mr. Weatherby. Uh huh.

Mr. Baron. And that your recollection is not crystal
clear about them.

might have occurred, and probably some initial impressions.

Mr. Baron. And that would be a cable that we should find

Mr. Weatherby. Okay, I read it,

Mr. Baron. Does this document refresh your recollection
about the substance of your meeting with AMLASH in Copenhagen?

Mr. Weatherby. It is not enough to refresh my recollection!
of the meeting in Copenhagen per se, but I think in earlier i

testimony I discussed the use of the term in talking to him,

"assassinate," and indicated that he was opposed to a term
of that nature.

I think it would show that I perhaps was not sure where
that particular discussion took place, Stockholm or Copenhagen
or in Helsinki.

Mr. Baron. In referring to the portion of this excerpt
from your contact report that says "We used the term ‘assassinate.
The use of this term we later learned from Tepedino and from
AMLASH himself was most objectionable to the latter, and
he was visibly upset. It was not the act he objected to,
but rather merely the choice of the word used to describe it.
‘Eliminate’ was acceptable."

Does that generally desribe your recollection of AMLASH's
attitude toward the use of the word “assassinate"?

Mr. Weatherby. To the best of my recollection, yes.

Mr. Baron. Do you recall reporting directly to anyone

in Task Force W about AMLASH's attitude toward assassination?

Mr. Baron. Do you recall this involved actually a series

of meetings between August 24th and August 23, 1962, as

indicated by the I.G. report?
Mr. Weatherby. That's correct.
Mr. Baron. Was AMLASH given secret writing training
and issued secret writing supplies shortly after that meeting?
Mr. Weatherby. Yes, sir.
Mr. Baron. Was he also taken to the south of France for
a demolition demonstration?
Mr. Weatherby. Yes, sir.

Mr. Weatherby. That was done to show him we were willing

Mr. Baron. Was it clear to you at that time that AMLASH
had direct personal access to Castro?

Mr. Weatherby. He had direct personal access to him as
far as we knew in the company of others.

Mr. Baron. Did he clearly have no access to Castro in
any one-on-one setting?

My. Weatherby. I have no idea of that, sir. I might say
that Castro was constantly surrounded by an “entotirage and
you would have to be awfully friendly with Castro to ever get
into that situation with him.

Mr. Baron. It was true, though, was it not, that AMLASH
was personally friendly with Castro and had a long history
of personal relationship with him?

_Mr. Weatherby. He was no longer friendly with him since
his. movement was eased out of control of Cuba. They had
a relationship probably as one conspirator against natista
to another. He had a degree of accessability and was still,
I am sure, held in some respect by Castro, but the degree
of friendship, I don't think you could say it was very deep.

Mr, Baron. Do you recall anything that occurred in
these meetings in mid-August in Paris that would have contribut
further to the belief that AMLASH had a propensity to carry
out an assassination mission?

informed about the content of that cable, and perhaps the
discussions that the Spanish-speaking case officer had with
AMLASH. I may have not been at the meeting -as they conducted
it in Spanish, and I do beliéve they had several meetings in
which I was not in attendance. Of that I am not certain.

Mr. Baron. Do you have a general recollection of AMLASH
making statements or behaving in such a way to indicate that
he "could or might try to carry out on his own initiative"

a “physical elimination mission"?

Mr. Weatherby. He may have continued to discuss it, but
I didn't feel that he really meant what he said.

Mx. Baron. Would he have been discussing a physical
elimination mission against Castro?

Mr. Weatherby. With this Spanish-speaking case officer?

Mr. Baron. Yes, or in the content of these general
meetings?

Mr. Weatherby. He could have been. That I don't recall
precisely. It is one thing to have a man perhaps thinking or

iff he could overthrow the government, or take power, or divide
it, that of course was an objective.

Mr. Baron. If he could have done, if he could have
accomplished that objective by means of physical“elimination
of leadership of Cuba, that would not have been objectionable

a different story. In other words, I draw a distinction between,

assassination of an individual, individuals, and those who
lose their life in a battlefield, whether it is in a building
or on a battlefield.

Mc. Baron. What about killing the sentry who is guarding
the door to the palace?

Mr. Baron. As a means of initiating an attack.

Mr. Weatherby. That's sort of like asking me when I
stopped beating my wife, sir. I would rather not comment on
that.

Mr. Baron. I am simply trying to point out that or to
ask you whether there is not some middle ground between a
combat situation and an individual murder where it might have
been acceptable to you at the time for our government to be
involved in targeted elimination of political leaders in
a regime that we found unacceptable. —

Mr. Weatherby. I had not really thought about that, and
it is a rather philosophical question, sir.

Mr. Baron. Can you tell me first whether you have an™
independent recollection of such a: directive reaching you
in Paris; namely, a directly "strongly concur that no physical,
elimination missions be given AMLASH"?

Mr. Weatherby. Well, I can believe this as an exhibit.

Mr. Baron. In other words it is credible to you but

you don't have any independent recollection of receiving such

a directive?

Mr. Weatherby. No. But it is within keeping with my
directions at all times, so, therefore, it seems to be
perfectly logical.

Mr. Baron. Why would such a directive have been sent at
that point?

Mx. Weatherby. Probably only te reinforce a case officer'd
judgement in the field that he's not about to condone such
activity, and they are going on record, as in the bureaucracy,
saying you are absolutely right.

in Project AMLASH that occurred between the time of these
; meetings in August of 1962 and your departure from Project

we learned that he was coming out to Porto Alegre in Brazil,
and we made arrangements to visit with him.

That's the other AMLASH case officer and myself.

Mr. Baron. What transpired when you met with AMLASH in
Porto Alegre?

Mr. Weatherby. That was essentially a turnover meeting.
We met-him and he was debriefed in.a safe house by the other
case officer in Spanish, and I was posted as a 1Gokout, and

the turnover. I am not sure.

Mr. Baron. Do you recall --

Mr. Weatherby. I certainly didn't.

Mr. Baron. -- the nature of any assignments given to
AMTRUNK 10?

Mx. Weatherby. No, I don't.

Mr. Baron. How soon after this meeting in Porto Alegre
did you leave Project AMLASH?

Mr. Weatherby. Well, normally when you turn the case over
you leave it immediately, for compartmentation's sake, I

believe I may have heard or seen Tepedino once or twice after

states. 2pgethat would be the termination of my portion of the

Mr. Baron. Were you present at any further meetings in
Paris with AMLASH?

Mr. Weatherby. Ho, sir.

Mr. Baron. Do you recall briefing thé succeeding AMLASH
case officer at the time that he took over?

Mr. Weatherby. I had to have.

Mr. Baron. Do you recall briefing him on AMLASH's

propensity for assassination? cs

Mr. Weatherby. His propensity to discuss it, I am sure,
was common knowledge.

Mr. Baron. But not his propensity for carrying out the
‘act itself? ,

Mr. Weatherby. Correct.

Mr. Baron. Did you mention to the new case officer
AMLASH's, AMLASH's willingness to carry out such an act?

Mr. Weatherby. I would never -- I don’t recall having
mentioned that precisely, but I would not have said his
willingness, but his tendency to talk about it, because I
personally didn't believe that the man ever really meant to

do that physically.

Mr. Baron. Were you aware of any meetings that tock place
in October of 1963 at which Desmond FitzGerald met AMLASH
in Paris at Red Stent's house and discussed the kind of
support that AMLASH could expect from the United States

government?

Mx. Weatherby. I knew he went because it was very
soon after, I think, I had last seen him but I wasn't invited
for any operational guidance bu. then.

Mr. Baron. You weren't invited to brief FitzGerald at
that point?

Mr. Weatherby. I don't recall. I may have briefed him
er talked to him with the other AMLASH case officer.about the
man, what kind of an animal he was -- can we.strike that?
What kind of a man he was, and maybe so. And of course his
idiosyncrasies, that's normal procedure.

Mr. Baron. Do you recall any discussion with anyone at
CIA at that point about the need to meet AMLASH's request
for assurances that a high U.S. official was willing to
stand behind his operations in Cuba, preferably Robert F.
Kennedy?

Mr. Weatherby. I heard, probably without invitation,
or by the by that FitzGerald would go over there, but f didn’t
know the details. I knew -- °

Mr. Baron. Did you know that FitzGerald would go over
there to make a representation to AMLASH that people higher
in the government than FitzGerald would stand behind AMLASH?

Mr. Weatherby. Yes, I remember that. To the best of

.my knowledge -- I don't remember who he represented, but during
the trip obviously he was preparing for it and ~-

Mr. Baron. Did you! have any sense of the relationship
that existed between Robert Kennedy and Richard Helms?

Mr. Weatherby. No, sir. ,

Mr. Baron. Do you have any recollection of drops into
Cuba of caches of arms intended for AMLASH?

Mr. Weatherby. No, sir.

Mr. Baron. Do you recall any planning for such drops
or even the discussion of such drops? oss

Mr. Weatherby. I may have heard it. I didn't participate
and I don't know any details.

Mr. Baron. Do you recall any discussion of dropping arms
to ANLASH or people associated with him during your period
of operational control of the AMLASH Project?

Mr. Weatherby. No. Tt may well have been discussed at
that point, but nothing during my tenure was ever done like
that. The man didn't communicate. It would be pretty hard
to drop anything to him at that point.

Mr. Baron. What do you mean by the fact that he wasn't
communicating?

Mr. Weatherby. Well, as I said earlier, there were
great periods when the man, we didn’t know really what he
was doing. We heard second-hand or they had seen him here or

there, and he was well and healthy and so forth, but he

wouldn't communicate with us. It's just simply not, it's not

nothing of significance until we finally found out the man
was going to come out. ,

; That was one of the frustrations of the case, that the
man wouldn't communicate.

Mr. Baron. Going to come out to where?

Mr. Weatherby. To Porto Alegre. “as

Mr. Baron. Do you have any knowledge from any source
about the development of a pin containing a hypodermic syringe
capable of administering poison?

Mr. Weatherby. No, sir.

Mr. Baron. You don't recall the development of such a
device in relation to the AMLASH case?

Mr. Weatherby. No, I don't.

Mr. Baron. Do you recall discussions with the Technical
Services Division or the Office of Medical Services about
developing any devices capable of, you know, eliminating an
individual Cuban leader?

Mr. Weatherby. No.

Mr. Baron, If I told you that a ballpoint pen was developdd
at the CIA which contained.a hypodermic syring and was capable
ef administering a lethal poison, and that such a device was

offered to AMLASH at a point subsequent to your involvement

Mr. Weatherby. I wouldn't think it was accurate. I
really don't know.
Mr. Baron. Would it strike you that either the story
is inaccurate, or if it is accurate, that such device would
clearly be designed for offensive use against some individual?
Mr. Weatherby. May I have that question again?
(The reporter read back the prior question.)
Mr. Weatherby. Well, I have no knowledge of.it. I think
it is probably inaccurate. However, if it were accurate,
use the conjectural, then obviously it must be used perhaps
in the manner which you describe.

Mr. Baron. Wouldn't it seem unlikely to you that that

"kind of device would be designed as a self-defense weapon?

Mr. Weatherby. I don't know. I really, I don't, I am
not getting the train of your questioning now.

Mr. Baron. I am simply asking in the abstract your
opinion as, in effect, an expert, as a case officer with
some operational experience, wouldn't such a device be next

to useless as a self-defense weapon?

Mr. Weatherby. No, I don't think so. No different than
mace.

Mr. Baron. Except that this device obviously can only
be used --

Mr. Weatherby. Once.

Mr. Weatherby. Yeah.
Mr. Baron, Where there could be more than one, you know,

Mx. Weatherby. Yeah. That's such a hypothetical question
that it's difficult to answer. You know, if I were talking
to you and you were a Russian case officer, and ¥ said I
am not going to do something, and you decided that you were
going to turn me in, all I can do is get rid of you and leave.
If, on the other hand, in a cast of thousands it would not
be worth a whole hell of a lot.

Mr. Baron. If somebody were asking you for a self-defense
weapon, would you supply them with this kind of a device that
I have described?

Mr. Weatherby. Oh, I would have to think about that.

That's fairly -- that would depend entirely on the circumstanceg.
Mr. Baron, After you left Project AMLASH, what was
the nature of the other projécts that your pursued on Task

Mr. Weatherby. I would have to go back on the record on

which was the same organization as Task Force W?

Mr. Weatherby. Absolutely. I am not interested in >
subterfuge. ,

Mr. Baron. Okay. In your intelligence collection
operations on Task Force W or the SAS staff, did you make
any use of members of the gambling syndicate in Havana?

Mr. Weatherby. No, sir.

Mr. Baron. Were you ever made aware of CIA contact with
members of the gambling syndicate that ran gambling operations
in Cuba for the purpose of intelligence gathering?

Mr, Weatherby. Mo, sir.

Mr. Baron. Were you aware of any contact with gambling
syndicate members?

Mr. Weatherby. No, sir.

Mr. Baron. “And does that include gambling syndicate
figures in the United States who may have had an interest in
Cuba?

Mr. Weatherby. Yes, sir.

Mr. Baron. Did you visit the 3.M. WAVE station in
Miami as a part of your activities on Task Force W or SAS?

Mr. Weatherby. No, sir.

to the second one was no, sir.

Mr. Baron. All of which goes to indicate that you never
visited the J.M. WAVE station at any point?

Mr. Weatherby. During my attachment to the“Cuban Task

Mr..Baron. Did you visit it at some other point, that

Mr. Weatherby. That is correct.

Mr. Baron. Is that correct?
