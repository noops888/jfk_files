Hy Once coup appears successful, AMLASH/1 feels the following officers
i will fall in line:
j a. Gmdte. Juan Alm@dja Bosque ae
b, Cmdte, Faure Chomon Mediavilla (must check
Chomon thoroughly to determine extent and depth
of his ideological feelings toward Marxism, AMLASH/1
is not completely sure of him at this point).

i e. Cmdte. Antonio Castell:
Although it has never been confirmed to AMLASH/1 that KUBARK is
in contact with AMTRUNK/10, AMLASH/1 again mentioned as he had :
several times in the past meatiened his concern for the security a
ITRUNK/ LO, and his feeling if AMICE/14 continueg to contact i i
himjinside Cuba we rin the risk of losing him. : ; ;
4. AMLASH/1 asked for the following items to be included in ¢ :
1 a cache inside Cuba: 20 hand grenades, 2 high power rifles : t ;
| with scopes and approximately 20 Ibs, C-4 and related equipment. |
AMLASH/1 suggested best place for cache was finca managed by
AMTRUNK/10.
| - 5. Since he was returning via Prague AMLASH/1 did not
| désire to carry any incriminating material with him. In order to
provide him time to establish his normal pattern once he returned
to Havana, it was agreed his S/W material would not be sent to
t him until sometime between 5-15 January 1964, AMLASH/1 suggested
| and C/O agreed he should not engage in any activity which may
draw suspicion to him for at least a month. During December he
planned attending the various anniversary functions coming due
during this month and again speaking in Santa Clara as he has done
each year in the past on the anniversary date of the battle of
Santa Clara. He also felt this would give him an opportunity to
check the pulse of his friends in that city.Don Roberto (Bob Owen)
arranged the attached plan for the S/W delivery which if needed

fe
asked the cvestion "why do such things
i



1, Coumunications problem and training: .
AMLASH aensitive this point but believe he will see need good, rapid
commo if we to provide support he needa, ,

Beat solution to commo problem would be:

&. Qive AMIASH two weeks of intensive como training on AR-l8 so that.
he will be knowledgeable enough to train his om como operator inside PARUMEN,
(We realize AMLASH personally will not maintain a satieiactory como link, therefore,
we feel bost solution ts for him to find.a trusted person to do it for him. Best
poustbility appears to be his foraer secretary whom he claims to trust.)

b, AMLASH already trained in S/w but wrote only two letters in one year,
One letter was never received. Extra carbons and developer pills are in brown
envelope in safe marked “AMLASII/1 SW Carbons and Pills.” (ANLASH/1 may also be
able to train the above radio comuntoator and use her or him as case may be to

write his 3/W messages.)

0, If€ and when the training can be given a trainer will come to do
the Job. :
2. If the opportunity presents itself it would be helpful to have more
of the foilowing information before cur final period of briefings and discussions
with AMLASH/1:
@. Info on individuals who close friends and AMLASH may use in his
operation, such as:
1, Maj Raul Diaz-Arguelles Garcia
2. Maj Antonio Castells
3. Capt Pauste Lopez Miranda 7
Capt Juan Nuiry Sanches 7
5. Maj Bfizenio Ameijetras Delgado

b. How can the following revortedly anti-Communist officers be used:

~ 2. Capt Felipe Guerra Mate, who is now Chief of the Milith and
reportedly a dlose friend of JUéan Nuiry Sanches 4
3. Maj Pedro Miret Prietofieneral Staff, Chief of artillery
