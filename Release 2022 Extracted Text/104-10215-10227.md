CONTACT REPORT:

PERSONS PRESENT:

TIME & PLACE:

AMLASH/1, Matthew H. ONTPICH, (alias

Nicholas Sanson)

22 November 1963, Charlie Gray's Apt.,

Paris, France

1. AMLASH/1 planned return, and held reservations on Cubana

from Prague to Havana on 28 November 1963. He planned depart Paris

on 25 or 27 November for Prague on Czech Airlines but still did

not have reservations. He was asked to inform Mr. Roberto (Bob

Owen) when reservations confirmed.

2. AMLASH/1 stated he was returning to Cuba fully determined

to pursue his plans to initiate a coup against AMTHUG. Subject was

pleased to read a copy of President Kennedy's 18 November speech

in Miami and was even more pleased to hear that Mr. Clark (DAINOLD)

had helped prepare the President's speech. ONTRICH reiterated

the assurances given by DAINOLD of full U.S. support if a real

coup against the AMTHUG regime is successful.

3. AMLASH/l continued to insist that as long as AMTHUG is

around the number of individuals knowledgeable of a coup against

the regime must be kept to an absolute minimum. The individuals in

whom AMLASH/1 has the most confidence and whom he believes can be

trusted in the initial stages of the operation if it is necessary

to cut other individuals in are:

a. Cmdte. Efigenio Amajeiras Delgado

b. AMTRUNK/10

c.

Jose Naranjo Morales, Mayor of Havana.

d. Jose Assef, former sub-Sec. Ministry of Interior and

presently Assistant to Naranjo, Municipality of Havana.

AMLASH/1 feels that once AMTHUG is removed, the following officers

can be counted on to support the coup:

a. Cmate. Raul Diaz-Arguelles Garcia

b. Nieves Brothers

c. Capt. Fausto Lopez Miranda

d. Capt. Juan Nuiry Sanchez who is a close friend and

can influence stand of Capt. Felipe Guerra Matos.

Once coup appears successful, AMLASH/1 feels the following officers

will fall in line:

a. Cmote. Juan Almedia Bosque

b. Cmidte. Faure Chomon Mediavilla (must check

Chomon thoroughly to determine extent and depth

of his ideological feelings toward Marxism. AMLASH/1

is not completely sure of him at this point).

c. Gustavo Arcos Berghes, Amb. to Belgium.

d. Enrique Rodriguez-Loech&, Amb. to Morocco

e. Coote. Antonio Castell;

Although it has never been confirmed to AMLASH/1 that KUBARK is

in contact with AYTRUNK/10, AMLASH/1 again mentioned as he had

several times in the past mastioned his concern for the security

Of MeTRYNK/10, and his feeling 1f AMICE/14 continues to contact

him/inside Cuba we rin the risk of losing him.

4. AMLASH/l asked for the following items to be included in

a cache inside Cuba: 20 hand grenades, 2 high power rifles

with scopes and approximately 20 lbs. C-4 and related equipment.

AMLASH/1 suggested best place for cache was finca managed by

AMTRUNK/10.

5. Since he was returning via Prague AMLASH/1 did not

desire to carry any incriminating material with him. In order to

provide him time to establish his normal pattern once he returned

to Havana, it was agreed his S/W material would not be sent to

him until sometime between 5-15 January 1964. AMLASH/1 suggested

and C/O agreed he should not engage in any activity which may

draw suspicion to him for at least a month. During December he

planned attending the various anniversary functions coming due

during this month

and again speaking in Santa Clara as he has done

each year in the past on the anniversary date of the battle of

Santa Clara. He also felt this would give him an opportunity to

check the pulse of his friends in that city. Don Roberto (Bob Owen)

arranged the attached plan for the S/W delivery which if needed

enn still be ured, but OTarCH arrenged the following chonge with

M1ibl/1 in case the person making the dolivery does not icalie

personal contact with Dunestina seesti

^. "Tipposeil address for delivesy of 5/: natorial # 56638

romains the some, tiar urd antes of delivery the sore.

b.

Alternate mottod of cellurry:

A letter containing the 5/i anterinl Is placed in Ernestina's

mailbox in the building. Once the letter in placed in the

mailbor, the person maling the dolivery enlie Cana", it 30-31-15

elving the name "Luis". Do talls her that he sent the modicine

for her nother over to for, "Ya te mende la redicina para tu

mama"!

• The envelope should preferably have on it the none

of a medical lab. ond the S/l pille should be in a small

envelope, also containing the name of the medical lab.

(One in Mexico is fiar,.

The letter to "Ene" should simply state "enclosed is

the medicine you requested I get for jou, signed "luis".

Letters signed "Luis" will be written on the S/i carbon,

and indicate resupply of 5/% materiel.

Letter's signed "Tepe" will contain an Sir message.

Milishl hesitated when asked if he was

sure there were mil-

bores in the building, but then answered he was sure there were.

If by any chance there are no mallboxes in the building, the

individual maling delivery should simply call "üne" and toll cr

he has the medicine for her and tell her where to fick it up.

ANLASH/l's Ofs thinking appeared much less fossy than before.

He is now also including in his planning the necessity for taking

over the lavana radio station in the early stages in order to broaá-

cast his appeal for support.

7. When coming out of the meeting the C/D and WLiS1/1 vere

informed of the assassination of President jennedy. 2iL15H/1 was

visibly moved over the news. He asked the question "why do such things

happen to good people?"

8..

AMLASH/1 was given $350.00 for personal expenses. ‹

AMASH sensitive this point but bolleve he will see nood good, rapid

cosmo 18 we to provide support he needa.

Beat solution to commo problera would be:

(We realize AMLASH personally will not mintain a saticidatory commo link, therefore,

we feel boat solution is for him to find a trusted parson to do lt for hin. Best

poualbility appears to be his forder secretary shou he claina to trust.)

One lotter was nover recolved. Extra carbons and developer pills are in broan

able to train the above radio coamunloator and use her or him as case may be to

the job.

Proposed address for delivery of S/W material

Residence of Ernestina ("Ene") ACOSTA

Located at top floor, modern apartient buildin; at corner of 25th and H

streets

in Havana.

See sketche

Friend said that it is a "casa de huespedes"y

"Ene" thus is one of

several young women who live in the apartment. Everybody 18

"de

confianza" according to our friend but he doesn't seem to know the

nanes of the other inhabitants and cannot say whether or not there

are any other apartments on the top floor. He, does not know whether

or not there 18 an elevator.

The telephone at the apartment 18 30 38 65. Anyone may answer, including

"Eno".

The address is a block from the Medical Faculty of the Unit. of Havana.

"Ing" is a pharmacist.

Proposed time of delivery of S/l material

During the first tho weeks of January.

Proposed nethod of delivery.

Person to deliver (or obvlously someone working with that person) calle

30 38 65, preferably about 0800 hours, and asks for "Ene". The

conversation should then go approximately as follows!

BiTING ARE E813 "Llano para saber al consegulstes la medicina

para mama."

("'Ene"

(1f conditions are right for delivery)

«S1, pasa por qqui para entregartela."

(116 conditions are not right for delivery)

¿No, no la tengo todavia. Vuelve a llanar •

If the ansver is affirmative, our person goes immediately to the building.

It seems best that our person go to the apartment where "Bne" 1s and for

her to be waiting there at the door. An alternative, which can be

established by the person telephoning, can be to make delivery in the

entrance to the building. However, that entrance 1s visible clearly

tron the street.

On delivering the S/l naterial, our person simply hands the envelope

(preferably one with the nane of a sedical lab or the medical faculty)

to "Eno".
