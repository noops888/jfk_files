Two kings and the Queen of Greece, eight presidents, three
crown princes, and four members of royal -Eamilies, thirty prime
ministers and foreign ministers attended these ceremoniés; but with-
out any doubt at all the outstanding personality at this ‘gathering
was General DE GAULLE, and the next, ‘most outstanding was ERHARD,
despite the fact that the German President was present too.

The funeral ceremonies were splendid and magnificent, and it is
said that Washington has seen’ nothing like them since the burial of
the Unknown Soldier. .

After the internment ceremonies, all the representatives went
to the White House so that Mrs. KENNEDY might thank thém. While
talking with H.I.H., Mrs. KENNEDY said, "I thank the gfeat King of
Kings of Iran very much for sending Your Highness to Washington

on his behalf to attend my husband's funeral." Moreover she men-
tioned her pleasant memories of the days when their two majesties
