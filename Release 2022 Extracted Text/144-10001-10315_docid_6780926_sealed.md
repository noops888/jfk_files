After 23 hours of flying, I arrived in Washington 'Saturday

at about 0200 hours in the night. The welcoming formalities were

carried out by RUSK and the top officials of the State Department.

Mr. RUSK was assigned to meet all foreign representatives,

even the heads of state.

Two kings and the Queen of Greece, eight presidents, three.

crown princes, and four members of royal families, thirty prime

ministers and foreign ministers attended these ceremonies; but with-

out any doubt at all the outstanding personality at this gathering

was General DE GAULLE, and the next, most outstanding was ERHARD,

despite the fact that the German President was present too.

The funeral ceremonies were splendid and magnificent, and it is

said that Washington has seen'nothing like them since the burial of

the Unknown Soldier.

After the internment ceremonies, all the representatives went

to the White House so that Mrs. KENNEDY might thank them. While

talking with H.I.H., Mes. KENNEDY said, "I thank the gfeat King of

Kings of Iran very much for sending Your Highness to Washington

on his behalf to attend my husband's funeral." Moreover she men-

tioned her pleasant memories of the days when their two majesties

were here.

Then the new president received all the representatives in

the white. House and thanked them. In this reception Mr. JOHNSON

spoke privately with His Highness and me and the Imperial Am-

bassador; and he described his good memories of the time of his

visit to Iran; and most of his talk was about H.I.M.'s'revolu-

tionary rejorms, which he lauded and praised; and he expressed

pleasure at the progress and development of these, reforms.

In the conversation with the Presidents of France and Germany

and the Crown Princess of the Netherlands all spoke of the pleasant

memories they had of their visits to Eeheran. • In general the con-

versations gave each one a chance to praise the revolutionary re-

forms of the king of kings.

His Highness left today for Florida.

"After staying a couple

of days there he will go to New York, and on Saturday he will leave

from New York. All the representatives left in the course of last

night and today.

Naturally the Secretary of State these past few days has been

busy with work for the new government, and probably it will not be

possible to arrange a meeting with him. However, Mr. TALBOT is

coming to the embassy tomorrow for some discussions. For luncheon

also a few top State Department officials have been invited to the

embassy.

I am leaving for New York tomorrow afternoon and on Saturday

am going to Europe with His Highness, and Monday I shall be in

Belgrade. Details by post.
