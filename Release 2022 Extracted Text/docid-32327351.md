the purchase of arns. JUE ronarlied that "they" had made

other arrangenents.U

on 2/3/64 Lucas BurGEs,

PSI, (protect) who has

furnished reliable Inforuation in the past, advised that luGo

ABICH of Elizabeth, New Jersey, is a refugee who works hard

for the overthrow of the CASTRO Begine. ABICE has collected

money lor Juic

although he is not a fornal menber of JURi or

an officer. M(4)

DIEGO ABRALAM ABICII CHAVAN iS belleved Icentical with

JUD (LNU). U

On 2/10/64 JURGINA ABICH (designated NK T-l in enclosed

letterhead menorandun) telephonically contacted the Newarks

uffico and advised that she is very concerned over the

activities of her brother DIIGO ABICH and wished to furnish

information regarding his activitios.U

On 2/12/64 JORGINA ABICH stated she is very concerned.

over the activitles of her brother because their parents reside

In Santiago de Cuba and are planning an imminont trip to Spain as

refugees and already have their tickets.

His actions she 1s

afraid, will jeopardise their parents position in Cuba. 4

She also stated that she is concerned that DIEGO

night find out that she has furnished infornation concerning

his activities. Also her sister has recently called CISNEROS.

about their parents' problens and her concern about DIEGO's

activities. U

She also requested that in any interview of members

Of JURE in illani that her brother's name not be mentioned as

he would eventually find out about it and would suspect that

she rurnished the information or else JURI officials would

suspect he was an informant.&

Referenced Miani report reveals that in December of

1963 FAY was interested in obtaining 500 to 1,000 pounds of

C-4 explosives and had funds avallable for the purchase. u

From infornation available it appears probable that

JUne has plans for an inninent raid on Cuba and that ABICH

had attempted to secure arms and explosives for JUrE although

he appears to have abandoned this attempt stating they had

made other arrangements. U
