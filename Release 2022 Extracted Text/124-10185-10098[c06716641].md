ATTACKS AGAINST BUREAU (MEXICO CITY AND FRANCE - 1951)

Although Agent Papich did not begin handling Liaison

with CIA until 1952, it is important to refer to highly signi-

ficant differences with CIA which culminated in a serious

conflict in the Fall of 1951. Our Legal Attaches in Mexico City

and Paris reported that CIA representatives were attacking the

Bureau, were endeavoring to place us in an unfavorable light,

were questioning our jurisdiction, and were making disparaging

remarks concerning the Bureau.

Some of this was summed up by

characterizing it as covert hostility within CIA, stemming

largely from disgruntled former employees of the FBI.

In October, 1951, General Walter Beddil Smith, then

Director of CIA, asked to meet with the Director and other

Bureau representatives for the purpose of discussing the

existing differences. General Smith denied that there was any

covost hostility against. the Bureau and maintained that there

was a general feeling of respect for us.

He admitted that

there had been isolated instances of friction for which CIA

must accept its share of responsibility.

It is my recollection that the Director and other

Bureau officials did meet with General Smith, at which time

guidelines were set forth for maintaining future relations

between the two agencies.

I was not able to find a memorandum

of record covering

meeting. (62-80750-1712, 1715, 1716,

1726, 1728, 1748, 1750)

2. PROSELYTING OF BUREAU PERSONNEL BY CIA

The Agent clearly recalls that early in the 1950's

we encountered difficulties with CIA because the Agency allegedly

was recruiting Bureau-employed personnel.

We vigorously pro-

tested, and subsequently.

the Agency advised that it would follow

a policy of not having any contact with a Bureau employee until

the Individual had been separated from the Bureau for a period

of at least thirty days.

The Agent could not locate the back-

ground of this matter in the files reviewed by him.

It is pos-

sible that the pertinent information lies in the personnel file

of some former Bureau Agent.

S. CIA EVALUATION OF MOCASE

In February, 1954, we complained to CIA because the

Agency had evaluated information coming frow the key source

in the captioned case as emanating from a fabricator. We had

disseminated certain foreign intelligence information originat-

ing in this case to CIA.

The source was a sey double agent

under CIA sponsorship.

He was

afforded a tour of the Bureau

It is believed

that if all available facts were col-

lected, the evidence would strongly indicate that CIA did a very

ineffective job of assessing Di. Otto John and permitting the

United States Government to be embarrassed by even promoting

& visit for him to this country.

We could consider this instance

an affront to the Director and

By letter dated October 13, 1954, a very strong letter

of protest was sent to General T. J.

Defector Committee at CIA.

This letter made reference to

political asylum which was being considered for certain Polish

sailors who had been seized by the Chinese Nationalist Government.

General Betts disseminated a memorandum indicating that members

of the Committee had agreed that in view of commitments made

by the United States and Chinese officials, that failure to

arrange re-entry for the Polish

seamen would have an adverse

effect on the over-all United States Defector Program.

emphasized to General Betts that this matter had never been

officially presented before the Defector Committee.

He was

informed that his action was not conducive to mutual cooperation.

countries.

Although CIA has not ventured to emphasize the

point, It

is believed that in many instances it has not pro-

duced

satisfactorily and efficiently because of the absence

of reliable sources.

72. LACK OF PROPER ORIENTATION OF BUREAU

RESPONSIBILITIES AND JURISDICTION

Although there has been decided improvement in

recent years,

the Liaison Agent continues to note a definite

lack of knowledge of FBI responsibilities and jurisdiction on

the part of CIA employees.

They do receive some training in

this regard, but the impression is left that such training

could be much more extensive. The Bureau's Liaison Agent has

lectured to hundreds of CIA employees in the last few years

and this has produced significant signs of concrete benefits.

CIA employees encountered the Liaison Agent on a very regular

basis and asked questions pertaining to our responsibilities.

Nevertheless, there is room for much improvement.

level in our embassies.

is in the immediate jurisdiction of a particular agency, it

will only disseminate at the Seat of Government.

example,

if CIA received information concerning the existence of a U.S.

crininal fugitive in a foreign country, it would disseminate

to the Legal Attache.

However, if the

information falls within

the area of intelligence, which includes subversive activities,

the Agency has stated that under its system the information is

considered to be "raw material" and that it must be evaluated

at

headquarters and reviewed in the context of what has been

received from other countries, and then disseminated to inter.

ested customers.

We have not

raised an issue, but dissemination

regarding political conditions in a country where the Legal

Attache is assigned could be useful because it would further

orient him in his dealings with foreign officials. There have

been exceptions where the CIA chief in an area, on his own

initiative, has given such information to our legal Attache.

After CIA disseminates at headquarters, we are in a position

helps, but it would be much more convenient for the Legal

Attache to receive itfat the local level:]

receive information regarding a subject, such as an alleged

spy traveling to the United States, or the case abroad

simply-has ramifications in this country. In these instances,

CIA has

followed a definite pattern over

the years of not

furnishing such information to the Legal Attache, but

disseminating to us at Seat of Government. Here

again, CIA

has maintained that its headquarters must

review the data and

make the decision regarding dissemination. We have not raised

an issue.

We could by claiming that the Legal Attache could

be useful in evaluating the case and being in a position to

follow Bureau interests as soon as possible. However, if we

pushed for a change in current conditions, we should consider

that the Legal Attaches possibly could inherit responsibilities

abroad which might present risks or operational headaches.

For several years there existed a coordinating

mechanism

In Germany headed by CIA.

This was a committee

headed by the Agency and composed

oi representatives of other

Uos. agencies.

The committee reviewed espionage and counter-

espionage developments in Germany which had a bearing on U.s.

interests.

If a problem of operational jurisdiction arose

among the U.S. agencies, the committee mechanism was used' to

establish an agreed-to operating agreement.

Quite often various

responsibilities were divided among the ditterent agencies.

It is my recollection that the Bureau has not been interested

with responsibilities not entirely agreeable to us:

74. SOME PAST HISTORY WHICH IS VERY RELEVANT

When evaluating our relationship with CIA, including

our grievances, it is believed that we cannot overlook the

relevancy of the serious differences we experienced with the

Office of Strategic Services (OSS) during World War 11. Ine

seeds leading to the establishment of CIA came from OSS. Willian

Donovan, who was

the head of OSS, has been referred to as the

"Father of CIA."

There were instances when OSS blatantly ignored FBI

jurisdiction and failed to coordinate on numerous matters:

There

was a number of CIA officials who obviously had a definite dislike

for the Bureau.

The loose administration of OSS, its employment

of known subversives, its alleged penetration by the soviets,

and its attitude toward the Russian Government at the time posed

serious problems to the Bureau.

At one point OSS was actually

giving serious consideration to establishing liaison with the

NKVD.

Because a substantial number of OSS officials subsequently

became important figures within Cla, It would be logical to

assume that the FBI was justified in being most prudent, if not

circumspect, in dealings with the Agency.

When evaluating its position in 1970, the Bureau

rightfully cannot forget the troubles with oss.

At the same

time, it would be most unwise if we neglected to examine the

role

played by the Bureau when we disbanded our SIS operations

in 1947.

In a matter of hours, we destroyed hundreds of files

in our SIS offices abroad, and we did not turn over to CIA a

that the Agency could

argue that the actions

by the Bureau were detrimental to U.S.

interests and impaired CIA's early efforts to establish desired

coverage in Latin America.
