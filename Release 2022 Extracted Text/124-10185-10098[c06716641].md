7 ATTACKS AGAINST BUREAU (MEXICO CITY AND FRANCE ~ 1951)

Although Agent Papich did not begin handling Liaison

"with ‘CIA until (1952, it is important to refer to highly signi-

ficant differences with CIA which culminated in a serious
conflict in the Fall of 1951. Our Legal Attaches in Mexico City
and Paris reported that CIA representatives were attacking the
Bureau, were endeavoring to place us in an unfavorable light,
were questioning our jurisdiction, and were making disparaging
remarks concerning the Bureau. Some of this was summed up by
characterizing it as covert hostility within CIA, stemming
largely from disgruntled former employees of the FBI.

In October, 1951, General Walter Beddfl Smith, then
Director of CIA, asked to meet with the Director and other
Bureau representatives for the purpose of discussing the
existing differences. General Smith denied that there was any
covert hostility ageinst the Bureau and maintained that there
was a general feeling of respect for us. -He admitted that
there had been isolated instances of friction for which CIA
must accept its share of responsibility.

It is my recollection that the Director and other
Bureau officials did meet with General Smith, at which time
guidelines were set forth for maintaining future relations
between the two agencies. I was not able to find a memorandum
of record covering this meeting. (62~80750-1712, 1715, 1716,

1726, 1728, 1748, 1750)

2. PROSELYTING OF BUREAU PERSONNEL BY CIA

The Agent clearly recalls that early in the 1950's
we encountered difficulties with CIA because the Agency allegedly
was recruiting Bureau-employed personnel, We vigorously pro-
tested,and subsequently the Agency advised that it would follow
a policy of not having any contact with a Bureau employee until
the individual had been separated from the Bureau for a period
of at least thirty days. The Agent could not locate the back-
ground of this matter in the files reviewed by him, It is pos-
sible that the pertinent information lies in the personnel file
of some former Bureau Agent. ,

4, CIA EVALUATION OF MOCASE

: In February, 1954, we complained to CIA because the
Agency had evaluated information coming from the key source
in the captioned case as emanating from a fabricator. We had
disseminated certain foreign intelligence information originat-
ing in this case to CIA, The source was a key double agent
in one of thé most important cases handled by the Rurean, and
the CIA evaluation was not proper or correct. as far as we were
concerned, (Re: MOCASE) :

6. DR. OTTO JOHN, VISIT TO BUREAU - 1954

Dr. Otto John, a West German security official,
defected to the communists in East Germany in July, 1954. A
few weeks before his defection, he came to the United States
under CIA sponsorship.’ He was afforded a tour of the Bureau
and he briefly met the Director,

| It is believed that if all availzble facts were col-
lected, the evidence would strongly indicate that CIA did a very
imeffective job of assessing Dr. Otto John and permitting the
United States Government to be embarrassed by even promoting
a visit for him to this country. We could consider this instance
an affront to the Director and the Bureau. (Memorandum Roach to
Belmont October 13, 1954, "CIA Tours Afforded by Bureau")

By letter dated October 13, 1954, a very strong letter”
of protest was sent to General T. J. Betts of the Interagency ~
Defector Committee at CIA. This letter made reference to
political asylum which. was being considered for certain Polish
sailors who had been seized by the Chinese Nationalist Government,
General Betts disseminated a memorandum indicating that members
of the Committee had agreed that in view of commitments made
by the United States and Chinese officials, that failure to
arrange re-entry for the Polish seamen would have an adverse
effect on the over~all United States Defectoy Program. We
emphasized to General Betts. that this matter had never been
officially presented before the Defector Committee. He was

informed that his action was not conducive to mutual cooperation.

13. WILLIAM P. BUNDY

In March, 1956, Allen Dulles announced that William
P, Bundy would serve as a secretary for the Intelligence Advisory
Committee (IAC), of which the Bureau was a member. Bundy, son-
in-law of Dean.Acheson, admitted contributing to the Alger Hiss
Defense Fund. At the time of this contribution, Bundy was in
the same law firm with Donald Hiss, brother of Alger Hiss.

Although we did not object to the appointment of Bundy,
this is another item to be kept in mind in the event we desired :
to uphold an argument that there was reason to be circumspect :

On February 7, 1962, Colonel Sheffield Edwards,
Director of Security, CIA, informed the Liaison Agent that
CIA was preparing a report containing extremely sensitive
information, He stated that this information came from a
sensitive source and he was not certain as to how it should
be handled, As a result of a discussion with Edwards on
February 26, 1962, it was ascertained that CIA had maintained IFEGYB)
a@ technical surveillance on Kar iow[ over an extended period.
Edwards explained that he ha mH reluctant to identify this
‘source at an earlier date because he feared that prosecution
could have been jeopardized and, furthermore, he did not want
his Agency embarrassed in the event the Bureau objected to ‘
CIA maintaining a capability such as technical surveillances.
It was made emphatically clear to Edwards that it was absolutely
necessary that we be provided with all the details and, further-
more, that CIA, at the outset, should have apprised us of the
lexistence of the coverage, The Director made the notation,
“I only wish we would eventually realize CIA can never be
depended upon to deal forthrightly with us. Certainly my
skepticism isn't based on prejudice nor suspicion, but on
specific instances of all too many in number, Yet, there
exists wistful belief that the ‘leopard has changed his

Sometime prior to the Bay of Pigs fiasco, CIA had

Instructions were sent to the field and we then learned in
New York City that CIA allegedly planned to make a recruitment
approach. The matter was taken up with CIA headquarters and
a protest was made because of the wide discrepancy in the
reports we received on CIA_intentions. (Mgmorandum Brennan to

67. PASSING OF BUREAU DOCUMENTS TO
SENATOR ROBERT.C, BYRD BY CIA EMPLOYEE - 1966

In September, 1966, we developed information indicating
that copies of FBI documents had been passed to Senator Byrd by
CIA. The matter was discussed with the Director of CIA and the yr
Agency subsequently conducted an investigation and established ar)
that one of its employees, [Stephen M, Quinn, dr’, ,| had submitted S
a name check request to the Bureau concerning one (Ralph D. Fertig{s
evel) who was the subject of the material in question. At that time
(2) Eauinal had a responsibility of handling name check requests for
CIA and, in this connection, was in contact with our Name Check
Section. He admitted that he instituted a name check on an "ots

the cuff basis" for another CIA employee named (John Snoddy -(s) PEQYCBRS

It is my recoilection that one or puih CIA employees
were subsequently fired * or asked to resign. (Memorandum

the Agency allegedly had failed to report to us concerning a
communication which a Cuban exile, residing in the United States,
had received from the Cuban Intelligence Service. The particular
: communication had instructed the exile to initiate preparations

for the handling of an intelligence assignment in the United
States, CIA claimed that the exile had been reluctant to
operate in this country and CIA then instructed him not to
respond to the communication received from Cuba. We took the
position that despite this reluctance on the part of the exile,
the Bureau had been entitled to have had the opportunity to
make its own assessment. (Memorandum Brennan 4 Sullivan,

DEALING WITH THE "ERVIN BILL"

On June 5, 1969, information was received indicating
that Richard Helms had sent Senator Sam Ervin three proposed
amendments to the legislation being proposed by the Senator, |
‘all dealing with the protection of the constitutional rights
of Government employees. We had been following developments
relating to this proposed legislation because the provisions
had a very definite bearing'on Bureau operations. The proposed
amendments made by Helms included exemptions from certain
provisions of the Bill for FBI, CIA, and the National Security
Agency, These amendments. were suggested by CIA without prior
consultation with the Bureau. The Director made the notation,
"This presumptuous action of Helms' is astounding." (M. A. Jones
to Bishop memorandum, June 6, 1969, "S,. 782; Protection of
Constitutional Rights of Government Employees to Prevent
Unwarranted Invasion of Their Privacy")

71... CIA COVERAGE OF BUREAU LEADS

Historically, CIA's coverage of Bureau leads had
been decidedly spotty from the standpoint of delivering
“gatisfactory content and servicing the leads within a reasonable
period of time, It would be necessary to review hundreds, if
not thousands, of files to document what we consider delays in
following our leads. It should be noted that CIA, organizationally,
has never maintained an atmosphere of discipline in any way
comparable to that of the Bureau. Matters are not followed
as promptly and responsibility is not firmly fixed. This
evaluation is made in Tight of standards followed by the Bureau.
We continually prod and push CIA for responses. To develop all
of the evidence to explain these delays would require an inspection
of CIA operations, CIA has given the following types of responses:
hazards of adverse operating conditions in backward countries;
limited personnel; undue exposure to hostile intelligence, police,
and security services; pressures placed on the Agency on priority



Attache to receive itfat the local level TEX C9 :

targets quite often dealing with political crises in foreign
countries, Although CIA has not ventured to emphasize the
point, it is believed that in many instances it has not pro-
duced satisfactorily and efficiently because of the absence
of reliable sources. F

72, LACK OF PROPER ORIENTATION OF BUREAU
_ RESPONSIBILITIES AND JURISDICTION

Although ‘there has been decided improvement in

“recent years, the Liaison Agent continues to note a definite

lack of knowledge of FBI responsibilities and jurisdiction on
the part of CIA employees. They do receive some training in
this regard, but the impression is left that such training

could be much more extensive. The Bureau's Liaison Agent has
lectured to hundreds of CIA employees in the last few years

and this has produced significant signs of concrete benefits.
CIA employees encountered the Liaison Agent on a very regular
basis and asked questions pertaining to our responsibilities.

‘Nevertheless, there is room for much improvement.

73. CIA POLICY REGARDING DISSEMINATION TO OUR LEGAL ATTACHES

There has been a sore spot in connection with CIA
policy relating to its_dissemination of information|at a local
level in our embassie This policy allegedly has applied sof)
all other agencies and includes our Legal Attaches. CIA has
maintained that unless the information it develops or receives
is in the immediate jurisdiction of a particular agency, it
will only disseminate at the Seat of Government. Asan example,
if CIA received information concerning the existence of a U.S.
criminal fugitive in a foreign country, it would disseminate
to the Legal Attache. However, if the information falls within
the area of intelligence, which includes subversive activities,
the Agency has stated that under its system the information is
considered to be “raw material" and that it must be evaluated
at headquarters and reviewed in the context of what has been
received from other countries, and then disseminated to inter-
ested customers. We have not raised an issue, but dissemination
regarding political conditions in a country where the ‘Legal
Attache is assigned could be useful because it would further
orient him in his dealings with foreign officials, There have
been exceptions where the CIA/chief in an area, on his own
initiative,] has given such in ormation to our Legal Attacne RCL
After CIA disseminates at headquarters, we are ina position”
to'communicate the information to our Legal Attaches. This
helps, but it would be much more convenient for the Legal

: There are situations where CIA offices abroad
receive information regarding a subject, such as an alleged
spy traveling to the United States, or the case abroad
simply-has ramifications in this country, In these instances,
CIA has followed a definite pattern over the years of not
furnishing such information to the Legal Attache, but
disseminating to us at Seat of Government, Here again, CIA
has maintained that its headquarters must review the data and
make the decision regarding dissemination, We have not raised
an issue. We could by claiming that the Legal Attache could
be useful in evaluating the case and being in a position to
follow Bureau interests as soon as possible. However, if we
pushed for a change in current conditions, we should consider
i . that the Legal Attaches possibly could inherit responsibilities
te abroad which might present risks or operational headaches,

For several years there existed a coordinating
mechanism in Germany headed by CIA, This was a committee
headed by the Agency and composed of representatives of other
U.S, agencies, The committee reviewed espionage and counter-
espionage developments in Germany which had a bearing on U.S.
[ . interests, Ifa problem of operational jurisdiction arose
among the U.S. agencies, the committee mechanism was used’ to
‘ establish an agreed-to operating agreement. Quite often vari
: responsibilities were divided among the ditterent agencies. jG @)

It is my recollection that the Bureau has not been geusies: |
in becoming a part of such a committee, If we did, we could
end up with responsibilities not entirely agreeable to us,

74 SOME PAST HISTORY WHICH IS VERY RELEVANT

ae When evaluating our relationship with CIA, including
our grievances, it is believed that we cannot overlook the
relevancy of the serious differences we experienced with the

: Office of Strategic Services (OSS) during World War II. The

L seeds leading to the establishment of CIA came from OSS. William

Donovan, who was the head of OSS, has been referred to as the
"Father of CIA,"

There were instances when OSS blatantly ignored FBI

isdiction and failed to coordinate on numerous matters, There
@asya number of CIA -officials who obviously had a definite dislike
ee : ee the Bureau. The loose administration of OSS, its employment
eee of known. subversives, its alleged penetration by the Soviets,
\ and its attitude toward the Russian Government at the time posed
i serious problems to the Bureau, At one point OSS was actually
giving serious consideratien to establishing liaison with the

~ (SEGRE

NKVD. Because a substantial number of OSS officials subsequently
became important figures within CIA, it would be logical to
Assume that the FBI was justified in being most prudent, if not
circumspect, in dealings with the Agency.

When evaluating its position in 1970, the Bureau
rightfully cannot forget the troubles with OSS. At the same
time, it would be most unwise if we neglected to examine the
role played by the Bureau when we disbanded our SIS operations
in 1947. In a matter of hours, we destroyed hundreds of files
in our SIS offices abroad, and we did not turn over to CIA a
large number of sources and informants. There have been many
ex-Agents who had been connected with SIS, who were familiar -
with the file destruction operation, and who later became
-connected with CIA. It is possible that the Agency could
argue that the actions by the Bureau were detrimental to U.S.
interests and impaired CIA's early efforts to establish desired
coverage in Latin America.
