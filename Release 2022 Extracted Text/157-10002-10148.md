Mr. Schwarz. Did.he hand the pills to you?

Mr. O'Connell. Yes,

Mr. Schwarz. Did he know what the pills were for?

Mr. O'Connell. I don't think so.

Mr. Schwarz. But he knew they were illegal?

Mr. O'Connell. He knew they were illegal.

Mr. Schwarz. And were the pills not tried out on some
experimental subjects in the U.S.?

Mr. O'Connell. Yes.

Mr. Schwarz. And proven to be lethal?

Mr. O'Connell. Well, to the extent -- I will tell you
that, we used them on hamsters.

Mr. Schwarz. And. also monkeys?

Mr. O'Connell. No, as far as I know, just the hamsters.

Mr. Schwarz. But anyway, you knew they were lethal.

Mr. O'Connell. Yes.

Mr. Schwarz. And you handed them over to Rosselli?

Mr. O'Connell. Yes.

“Mr. Schwarz. And had the Technical Services made poison
pills before as far as you know?

Mr. O'Connell. As far as I know. TI have no idea.

This was my first experience with that sort of thing.

I am giving to you now.

Mr. Madigan. We don't have it presently.

Mr. O'Connell. I am sure it is over there.

Mr. Wides. With regard to the discussion of ereerenieerira
would it have been following on Mr. Madigan's point, that this
was a fairly serious and unusual operation that you were given,
and that you would have asked, is this authorized? Or how did
the question of Mr. Dulles authorizing it come up, as best you
recall?

Mr. O'Conhell. I told you, I knew that Mr. Dulles -- I was
told that Mr. Dulles had authorized it, I can't say quite when
it happened, but I know I was told.

Mr. Wides. You testified this morning -- I don't want
to put words in your mouth -- I thought you testified that you
were sure that Mr. Edwards told you at this meeting when he first
gave you the assignment that you were not sure that Mr. Bissell!s
also mentioned that when you later met in your office.

Mr. O'Connell. I would stick with that, yes. I think itl
probably was when I -- when Colonel Edwards called me he

said, this probably has the blessing of the DCI.

Mr, Wides. Do you know if[-pr. iv ealea who
was head of the Technical Services Division at the'time, was
witnessing about this?

wasn't. But he was at a meeting when the bills were delivered,

i Mr. Wides. But you don't recall whether you ever knew
chat isere: ag knew what it was in connection with as distinct
from merely knowing it was a lethal pill, is that right?

Mr. O'Connell. I can't say -- to my personal knowledge,
the discussion never came up when I was there. I don't think

he is a dummy, and I don't think[igg

is any dummy, and
I think they had a general idea.

But as far as I know they were never officially told.

Mr. Wides. To your knowledge, before you went overseas
no one else in the office of Security, Mr. Bannerman, Mr.

White or Mr. Hall, none of those men or anyone else knew about
the project, only yourself and Mr. Edwards?

Mr. O'Connell. Well, I would say this, to my knowledge
they were never briefed. However, I think I brought up an
incident this morning where Colonel Edwards was on leave and
cohonet King called Mr. Bannerman, who was his
deputy, and assumed that Bannerman knew all about it and started
talking about it, what are we going to do about
this -- I don't know what the conversation was about. And
Bannerman called in and said, what was this all about?

Mr. Wides. This was in 1962 before you left?

Mr. O'Connell. Yes. It was while I was up in the office.

And I said, I don't have the authority to brief you on it.

Mr. Wides. Were you ever aware, whether you were formally
notified or just got a rumble or heard through the grapevine,
that the CIA was getting some information about these threats,
or some information about groups who might pose a threat in the
Washington area, not from Bureau sources or military sources,
but from CIA sources, did you ever hear any rumble of that kind

Mr, O'Connell. Yes.

Mr. Wides. What did you hear?

Mr. O'Connell. The only way I got involved in it was that,
Howard Osborn would have a nine o'clock meeting every
morning with his deputies.

And they had a proprietary organization in the Office of
Security which I think had informants.

Now, I don't know their identities, but it would come out
in the meeting, and they would have some names for them. I
couldn't tell you what they were.

Mr. Madigan. What was the proprietary called?

Mr. O'Connell. The name that strikes me -- and I
know part of it, but I couldn't tell you exactly -- I think it

was a!

Mr. Madigan.

Mr. O'Connell something like that.
Mr. Wides. You say you think they had informants?
Mr. O'Connell. They obviously did, I guess, because the

way this would come out, so-and-so advised at a meeting last

Mr. Wides. If you associate that with

How would it be discussed at the meeting, through this

Mr. O'Connell. No, it usually would be the Deputy

Mr. O'Connell. Victor White.

Mr. Wides. And what would he say about how |
fitted into the picture?

Mr. O'Connell. That never came up. I just drew that
conclusion, that they had potential.

Mr. Wides. Why would you assume that they used a proprie-
tary as opposed to just having some agents penetrate a group?
Why would you think in terms of their using the fae

Mr. O'Connell. I can tell you what I think. :

First of all, I wouldn't want to use government employees,

agents who would be --

Did you have any knowledge during the 1970-1971 time frame

of any effort outside of Florida with regard to Cubans to fire
on the Keys or on the Florida area there with a boat that
would be disguised as a Russian boat, which was really a
group of people, some of whom were assets of the Agency?

Mr. O'Connell. No.

Mr. Madigan. You never heard of anything like that?

Mr. O'Connell. Nothing of that, no.

Mr. Madigan. Did you ever run across a fellow by
the name of Jerry Henning in your ‘dealing with Roselli
and Maheu?

Mr.O'Connell. No.

Mr. Madigan. You never heard of the name?

in San Francisco?

Mr. O'Connell. Yes.

Mr. Madigan. And were those the only two times now that
he was involved in the operations’ field?

Mr. O'Connelll. Oh, no. He did a lot of other things.

Mr. Madigan. Let me ask you this question.

When Maheu was having his problems with the authorities,
was there any reference back to his involvement in those kind off
activities, or was the only discussion about his role in
the so-called assassination plot? 7

Mr. O'Connell. Well, I am not even so sure that they got|
into that aspect of it. It was just that he was involved
to the extent that he had set up the operation against Rowen
or he was the one that got in touch with DuBois to do it.

Mr. Wides. When did you come back from overseas?

Mr. O'Connell. July of 1965.

Mr. Wides. After you came back did you learn of a time,

either after you came back or very shortly before you came

involved in that, officially or otherwise.

Mr. Wides. Or surreptitious entry?

Mr. O'Connell. He did one surreptitious entry for us once

k
Mr, Wides, What were the specifics of that?

Mr. O'Connell. There were a group of ___)Students.

jana they were staying

r

Heaind said that one of the group was acting very suspiciously,

in a rooming house up there right outside of Georgetown some-

here. And one of the students

taking a lot of notes where they were not supposed to be taking)
notes,or: certainly after operational briefings, and he would go
back to his room and he would write voluminous notes. And

he thought that was very strange that this guy was not acting
as he should.

And that aroused the suspicion

And they wanted to know whether we would get in and photo-

graph what he was writing to see whether he was really
violating his agreement.

So I called Maheu and he went up to the rooming house, and
he went to the people who owned the house and asked if they
had a room to rent and she had one. And he did know where the

students were staying. And she showed him one room. And

he said, anything up on thenext floor? And as luck would
have it, she had the adjacent room,

So he brought what would appear to be a suitcase up there,

which was his photographic equipment. And we knew the students

were in school, and has going to alert us if

_they came back, so he wouldn't get caught in the act.

And he went in, it was a very simple matter. It was
a tin box that he could open with a paper clip and he took it o
and photographed it, and put the case back in the drawer and
locked up and left.

But { __|was a gal, a woman. And “she was
looking at one part of the school over there. And this guy

stairs the students were coming up, with amatter of maybe
a split second timing.

Mr. Madigan. This wasn't Mendoz?

Mr. O'Connell. No.

Mr. Wides. What period was this that we are talking
about?

Mr. O'Connell. This would have been about 1955,

Mr, Wides. And other than that, and the two incidents
involving female companioship, what other kinds of sensitive
things would he undertake? Was that in the period that you
were paying him 500 a month?

Mr. O'Connell. The film was made, but they never did
release it, because things started to get better with the
leader, and they felt that they wouldn't use it,

Mr. Madigan. Were Agency facilities used by Maheu for
the production of this thing?

Mr. O'Connell . No. I hired-a small independent studio ih
Los Angeles.

Mr. Madigan. And did Agency officials fly out hota.
the ones that knew about the backdrop and all that? How was
that done? ~ ret

Mr. O'Connell. It seems to me that they were just --
at this point I am not too sure whether they superimposed it,
I guess is the word, with that background. I am not so
sure at this point, it has been so long ago. That was away in
the mid-fifties.

Mr. Wides. Could we get back to the question that we had
started on, which was the files and where they would exist?
You said that the operational files from all of your dealing
with him would be in the Family Jewels, because they were all
