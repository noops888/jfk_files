TESTIMONY OF BRONSON TWEEDY

Tha Chairman.. Would you please state your name?

Mr. Tweedy. Bronson Tweedy.

The Chairman. Mr. Baron, ara you going to commence the
questioning?

Mr. Baron. Mx. Tweedy, are you aware that you have the
right to counsel?

Mr. Tweedy. I am.

Mr. Baron. You are appearing voluntarily today without.

Mc. Tweedy, Tam.

Mr. Baron. Are you also aware that vou have the right

Mr. Tweedy. I am.

Me. Baron. Are you finally aware that all of your Consti-
% eutdonal rights are intact before the Committees, including vour
Fifth Amendment rights?

ar. Tweedy. Loam.

Mr. Baron. Mr. Tweedy, the Committee has been informed that
wa have gone over your testimony on the Lumumba case in som:

detail in two sessions, one today when you reviewed some slocu

». ments that wa obtained since your first examination, And |

_. would like to beqin by reading a quotation from your first

examination before you had saen theasu documents.

TOP SECRET



At page 30 of the: transcript of your examination on
September 9th, I would Like to ask you whather today's review of |
documents has changed your answer to this question. At that’ :
tima I asked you: “Do you have any knowledge of a messenger
from CIA Headquarters having vo go to the Congo to provide the
chief of station in the Congo with instructions to carry out
the assassination of Lumumba if possible, ‘and also provide him
with the tools to carry out such an assagsination, namely
poisons and medical equipment for administering them?"

You said, "No, I do not.” . ;

Later on in your testimony of that. sama session when you

were asked your opinion as to the truth of testimony we had

ived from Dr. Gottlieb excuse me, from tha Chief of
oe

' Station, who was in Leopoldville at that time, about a visit

i that he received from pr. Gottliab,; where the Chief of Statior

' testified that he received poison and instructions from(pr.

Gottlieb, whan asked your cpinion about ths truth about the

testimony of the Chief of Station, you responded that “Thare
is nothing in my experience with the Agency that would reatly
bear on that point whatsoever." And thet was at
your transcripts

llave your answers to those two questions changed in lient
of your review of the documents today?

wr. Tweedy, { heve not hal a chance to read tha transer

of my first testimony. As you know, I started reading it this

morning but did not gat a chance 9 get through te. There
to be something incomplete with that answer of mine, howev
there is no question in Treading the documents that I read‘ this
morning, which I had not seen in the batter part of fifteen
years, that a min did go out from Headquarters and was provided
with material which you mentioned and had a discussion along
these lines with the Chief of Station.

Ha Aid not, how + go out with instructions to the Chief
of Station without further referance to Headquarters to set
about assassinating Lumumba,

Mr. Raron. In your answers that we have just reviewed in

| your first examination, you indicated that you had no knowledirs

of « mission by'pr. Gottifab to the Congo and that there was

-_

; nOthing in your experlence in the Agency that would really bear

on the question whether such a mission was undertaken or what

the character of it was.

Nas the review of the documents today refreshed your

recollection to some substantial degree?

Mr. Tweedy. What T wes certainly trying to say the first
iy

time, and T repeat it, I said T hat no recollaction oF tir

Gigttlieh goina to tha Conao, but if the Chief of Station sala

{he Was thera, I was perfectly prepared to baliuve the Chief of

T have now reviewed thase docamants, I recall the circum-

TOP SECRET



that Dr. Gottlieb want to the Congo.

T was merely telling you, at that time, whet I coulda
remember, and there was an awful lot that [ did not. and do not.

Mr. Baron. To move to the perio when you were Chief of
the Africa Division and Richard Bissell was NDP in the summer
of 1960, did you have conversations with Richard Bissel) where
the subject of the assassination of tumumba arose?

Mr. Tweedy. Yes, I did. In fact, the first conversation,
as I recall it, that I ever had on the subject. was one he

initiated with ma, and, as f think I tela you, T do not recall

p exactly what was said, but thers was no quastion about (t but

“what Mr. Bissell was saying to ma was that thare was eqreemant.
policy aqreamant in Washington, that Lumumba must be removed
from the position of control and influence in the Congo or that
the Congo was going to be in serious trouble and thus Africa,

j at that stage of its development; and that. among the possibil-
ities of that elimination was indeed assassination.

In terms of the detail of that conversation with “r. Nissell.
1 really cannot go any further than that. This certainly was
the aist of it.

Mr. Baron. Was Mr. Dinsell any more specific at any point
with you about the policy level whers the consideration to
assassinate Lumumba had bean male?

Mr, Tweady. No, sir. Tha most authoritative atatement. on

that was a cable that went out to tha field from the Director,

TOP SECRET



Mr. Dilles, which implied to me there was policy agreement in

Washington. When I aay policy agreement in Washington, I cannot

ba mora spacific because I naver knew any more specificity.

Mowever, it" waa perfectly clear that the Agancy felt that it
had some sort of policy consensus in Washington about the need
for the removal of Lumumba. When I say removal, I mean by
whatever means: this does not necesearily have to be confin
to assassination, a political way of doing it, or anything

| elec.

Mr. Baron. It did not excluds assasmination?

Mr. Tweedy. No, indeed it did not.

Mr. Baron. You are referring to the cable of Auqust 24rh
from Alisn fullas to the Chief of Station in the Congo. fled
you seen that cable shortly after it was sent?

Mr. Tweedy. I suspect, aqain I cannot be sure, I suspect
that I saw it when it went out. At this point, Tt could not
even tell you. On instructions, I might even have drafted it,
this seems odd. I might have done, or had a hand in drafting
it, I do not know. it was basically Mr. Dulles’ cable exore
sing to the Station the typs of authority that he had to pess
such a massage to the fiald, { cartainiv would have seen it
on its way out.

Mr. Raror.. When you spoke to Mr. Nissall, either in the
first talk or in any subsequent talks -~

The Chairman. Where ia this cable?

TOP SECRET



Mr. Baron. Tab 2 in the Senator's pack:
The Chairman. Thank you.
Mr. Raron, In your talks with Mr. Aissell, where the
subject of the assassination of Lumumba was raised in any
i fashion, did Mr. Biesell move from thie general information
ij te you that the subject had been opened at very high levels
q to asking you to procaad to explors meana to getting access to

Lumumba for the purpose of assassinating him?

Mx. Tweedy. The purpose of hie conversation with me was

{ to ini¢date correspondence with tha Station for tham to explore
with Headquarters the possibility of this, that is ssaassina-
tion, or indead any other means of] removing Lumumba tram power.
In other words, the purpose of thel exercise was to tell the
Station what Hwadquarters had in mind, giving it some {daa of
the policy background of it, and then to have the Station
start reviewing possibilitias, assets, and discussing them with
Headquarters in detail in the same way ‘hat we would with any
operation, whether it was as sensitive as this, or lass so.

It was, in other words, the initiation of quite normal
operetional dialogue between Headquarters and the field, apart
from the fact that it was an unusual subject.

Mr. Baron. At some point after the serias of conversatious

with Richard Bissell, di@ you have a conversation with Sidney

Nottlich ‘about a mission that he was to undertake in tha

Congo? / -

TOP SECRET

f
'

Mr. Tweedy. |I was certainly reminded of that tn this
correspondence, as I think I told you in the first instance.

- a .
If Gottlieb went to the Congo, there {# no- question that 1 would

| have seen him befora he want, This traffic makes it perfactly

clear that I did. The actual content of that conversation is
no more clear to ma now as is revealed in this cable traffic.
On the cthar hand, I do think that is the qist of it.

Mr. Baron. You are referring to the cable that appears in

Tab 3, a cable of September 19th that you signed and Richard

| Bissell signed and dispatched to the Chief of Station in

Leopoidville telling him that/Sid from Paris, a man who would

announce himself as Sid ‘from Paris, would be coming acon to

Leopoidville to explain an assignment to tha Chief of Station.

Mr. Tweady. ‘That. is correct.

The Chairman. Sid from Paris being Dr. Gottlieb?
StS .

Mr. Tweedy. Yes, sir.

Mr. Baron. . As we discussed earlier today, you do have

“ g recollection of setting up a specially restricted channel of

++ communication by this cable which would hold all communications

Ou this operation. to the wyss Only of the Chief of Station,
is that correct?

1
Hr, Tweedy. ,Yes. This was done immediately after my

first discussion with Mr. Rissell.

Mr. Aaron. No you remember any instauce where “r. Risse!)

‘asked you to speak} to Dr. Gottlieb ast qive him this asaiqument?

TOP SECRET



Me. Tweedy. No, I do not. My assumption would be that
he would have had the first conversation with Dr. Gottlieb and
quite routinely hava said, now you talk to Mr, Twaedy, Chief of
the Division, before you go aut.

Mr. Baron. Would you assume in thds normal course of
operations in the DDP at that point you would have spoken to

Mr. Baron, As best you can recall, what instructions (id

Mr. Tweedy. his ta very general, but I think 4¢ covers
‘le: to assist the Chief of Station in his operational plannina

for this particular purpose.

Mr. Baron. Would that plannina have included plannina for

the assassination of Lumumba?

Mx. Tweedy. Specificallv, I do not think bre Toentien |
would have been thare to discuss Constitutional means of over-
throw of Lumumba. ile was thers for one purpose only. Ile was
a technician. He had this material with him, fly was thus
to act, as T think, a technical advisor on thane matters to

the Chief of Station. 1 do not think he was to be there as 4

general operational afvisor. That was not within his competencs,

hia training, or anything else. Et would not have been his
{

assignment. .

Mr. Baron. What did you tell'Dr. Gottlieb about the source

of authority for this mission?
Mr. Tweedy. I am not sure I told him anything. I assume?
that came through Mr. Bissell.

Mr. Baron, I will represent to you, aa I did earlier today,

that or. Gottlieb testified that in his conversation with you
| you indicated to him that you were giving him this mission on
| che authority of Richard Bissell.

Would that be consistent with the way you operated at thet
time?

Mr. Tweedy. Yes. Tha only thing thet is wrong there is
the use of the verb -- [ was not sanding him to the Cengo. He
routinaly checked, probably on Mr. Bissell's instructiona, with

‘ma, Chief of the Africa Divielon. He had already beun given

his marching orders to go to the Congo by Mr. Aisseli, not by

Me.

a

Mr. Baron. You would assume thatjpr. Tottlieh had a
a =
Beparate conversation with Richard Bissell, where Richard Niss<1)
told him, it is time for you to qo to the Congo and deliver a
lethal material and a certain set of instructions to the Chief
of Station.

Mr, Tweedy. I cannot assuma what was said in such a

couversation, but that/Dr. Gottlieh talked to Mr. Bissell befor:

he want to the Congo is without question, I do not know what
|:;was said. T aseume the general outlines of the purposes of
| him going to the Congo wers discussed, and I would be discussing
| them with him in greater detail.

Mr. Baron. Turning to Tab 6 of the Senator's book:
referring to a cable we reviewed this morning issued on
September 27th by tha'Chief of Station and sent to you, Eyes |

Only, at the CIA lteadquarters where the Chief of Station indi-

| cates that he contacted Gottlieb on the 26th of September and

they wera on the same wavelength.
Mr. Tweedy. Which one is this?
Mr. Baron. This should be marked number 6.

Mr. Twoedy. Oh, yes, excuse ma.

Mr. Baron. It begins, “Iden Raf contacted 26 Saptember.”
In this cable, the Chief of Station indicates that he had had
' two talks withibr. Gottlisb. He and pr. Gottlieb. had bean
considering a list of possibilities as follows.
In paragraph slat the pottom of the next paqa, the Chief
of Station says, “Plan procead on basis priority as listed
abeve unless instructed to contrary.”
And paradraph A on tha first page was Chief of Station's
top priority plan which related to racalling a cartain agent
from Stanlayville and having him taks refuge with Nia Prothar.

The cables coutinues,* "would thus act as inside man to brush on

deteils to razor edqe.”

Having reviewed thia cable early thia morning, de it your
standing, Mr. Tweady, that Big Brother refers to Lumumba?
Mr. Tweedy. Yes, I do.
Mr. Baron. That this was a report from the chief of

Station to yourself informing you that the top priority plan would

be to recall an agent from Stanleyville and ask that agent to

j infiltrate the entourage of Lumumba where he could ase the

possibility for polsoning Lumumba, would that be your under-

| atanding?

Mr. Tweedy. Fvaentually, when @ number of other steps had

taken place before and they would, for example, have included

+a discussion between the Chiaf of Station and this agent which

would hava made clear to tha agent what this was all about.

At this stage, he had no idaa of it, and our series of

, exploratory cables between Leopoldville and Headquarters

outlining the desrwe -f—— is nis sane i ) Ip

- accass to the entourage, what ha-found out and whether any of

this basically bore on the feasibility of the operation.

Mr. Baron. This was one of a sarias of cables whera the
Chiaf of Station was reporting ou his attampt of finding means
of access to Lumumba for the purposa of moisonina him?

Mr. Tweedy. Throuthout this whole period, the activity of
the Chief of Station in correspondance with Usadquartars was
exploratory.

“yr, Baron. What wag baing axplorad was the means of access

to Lumumba for the purpose of as

Mr. Tweedy. That was one of the things that was being

|
|

| explored. Tha other thing explored and constantly under review
was the whole situation of Lumumba and were there other alter-
natives, That does not appear in this particular cable: it
(appears in others.

Mr. Baron. Turning now to Tab 9 of the Senator's books,
| this is the cable of October 7 which you received in the Fyes

Only channel from the Chief of Station which indicated that

{Gottlieb had departed from Leopoldville for America on the
‘sth of October, and it says: “View expiration date his
pr materials, However left certain items of continuing usefulness
° Guthman" -- which-is a pseudonym for the Chief of Station whom
we have bean calling Hedgeman -- "Guthman plans continued
| try implement op."
Doas that indicate that you received a report ‘trom the
Chief of Station that he would continue to try to implement
this operation against Lumumba even after ‘Goeeties had left
the Congo?
Mr. Tweedy. He would continues to explore the posainiliti
of this operation and continue to renort to Headquarters. That
is all that this means.

Tt dows not mean with the disappearance of ‘Gottlieb he

would try to pull off the operation without further reference

to Headquarters. Tt just means a continuation despite the

a this out.

4 |, Mr. Baron. ie was to continue, in your mind, at least up

until the point where he had determined there w

a feasible

7 Would that be correct?

6 Mr. Tweedy. I would put it more broadly than that. 1
9 || would say that he was to continue to explore it to determine

10 | whether or not there was a feasible meana. tie perfectly well

could coma to the conclusion that with the hardest work in the

i world that he could sew no way to do it: That would have beer
a perfectly acceptable conclusion to Neadquarters, because a

decision would have to be made professionally.

ib | Mr. Baron. Turning to Tab 12 of the Sanator's books, there

yo is a,cable that you sant in this Fyas Only channel to the Chie!

In the second paragraph, you told the Chief of station:
"Raise above so you ara not confused by any apparent duplication
referring to the othar cable. “This channel remains for

apecific purpose you discuss with colleague also ramains highest

priority.”

Was the colleaque that you ware refarring tolor. Gottl ish?

Mr. Tweedy. Without doubt.

Mr. Baron. What did you mean by disposition spontaneous]?

ME. Tweedy. The fagiish of that cable, ag I mentioned
this morning, is absolutaly appalling.

What I am actually saying is, wherever vou talk to people

like wa did with the French, as I mentioned in the asxt sentence:

ji or anyone is studying the situation in Africa, thay all came

up with tha same conclusion, that there was to he no solution

' to the Condo with Lumumba still in power,or in a position of

overcoming it.

“Mr. Baron, To summarize what we discussed this morning,

despite the serias of cables and the indication here that

Lumumba's disposition spontaneously was the number one consi:
ation and highest priority. You are still maintaining that

the Chief of Station, was not. amnowared to co through with

assassination without checking back with Naadouarters?

Senator Goldwater. Mr. Tweedy, how long did you sarve
with the CIA?
Mr. Tweedy. I started with CIG on the lst of May, 1947 and
rved until March, 1973.
Senator Goldwater. You have had experience with intelli-

gence gathering agencies all around the world, I assume, or

|.moat of them?

Mr. Tweedy. A considerable number, yes, afr.
Senator Goldwater. Is it common practice in intelligence
encies such as the CIA for a lot of people to know about
everything that is going on, or am I riaht in assuming that
there are many things that you do in the intelligence field,

particularly the covert field, that the man sitting next to you

may know nothing about. Is that corract?

Mr. Tweedy. That is correct, gir. Compartmentation ‘was
very heavy in CIA. Thera were a qruat many thinds going on that
1 never knew anything about and do not know to this day.

Senator Goldwater. Is that not in vour experiance the

since before its, conception. I want to ask you, and of your
experience, what you think as a professional of the men in ths :
CIA, Man and women? ~

Mr. Tweedy. I came away from a career in intelligence in
March of '73 with rether strong convictions. 1 might preface
my remarks hare in answer to your question, Senator, by saying
Iwas in intelligence during the War, I was in Naval Intelli-

gence. This was not OSS, but I was in intallinence. ft also

determined me, if the circumstances permitted, to make a

| career of intelliganca after the War, and after the difficulty

of making the right contacts and so on and so forth, eventual !~
it worked and I svent a career in CIA.

I have two very strong impressions of that sxpariance.

Ous of them has to do with my colleagues, the personne) of the

Agency, who I found to be a remarkably telanted group. The

second was, and it was something that [I think all of us were

' basically proud of, the esprit de corps was at a very high

level and resulting from esprit de corps, «es it usuelly doas,

discipline was equally of a very high level, and if, came quits

aaturelly, this was not a matter that hed to be Inculcated ¢
beaten into junior officers, it came quits naturally because
this was quite clearly thea wav the orqanivation was run, and
basically, we were proud of it.

I have never reqratted for ¢ second my carear, and ft am

very proud of it and my associations.

Senator Goldwater. Are you still close to the members of
the CIA, your old friends?

Mr. Tweedy. Obviously I havea a great many friends who are
still serving. This is increasingly not the case as retirements
are catching up with my colleagues, but I do keep abreast of
Agency affaira to the extent I can. I do not attempt to inter-
fere with them, At their request, I did a consultation job in
the Agency this summer. It's the first time I was asked to do
it. I was vary glad to do it. I found 1¢ interesting,

stimulating, I was glad to be back. I do not necessarily

expect to do it again. However, if they askad me, I would If

I thought I could be of any help.
Senator Goldwater. Have you ever known of any actions
or activities to be taken in a precipitous manner in the CIA?
Mr. Tweedy. That is a very broad question, Senator. I am
not quite sure how to answer it.

As in every organization, I have certainly seen decisions

“taken and actions implemented that miqht hava been better

considered. This includes me, and there are a number of things

“thet professionally I would have done different if { had been

Imerely felt that the concensus at the policy levals of

Senator Huddleston. Do you recall being told specifically
that this operation had the approval, or was, in fact, the
policy of the highest authority?

Mr. Tweedy. No, sir, I do not recall that. Highest

authority was normally used in cable traffic, so we did not hava

Mr. Tweedy, Or send a magsenger personally cut.

no possibility that thers would be a misunderstanding as to

My. Tweedy. Really thy only peopla that wore sur iously

be Mr. Tweedy, in the August cable that Alten Mulles sent to

Mr. Twaedy. The policy luvel. As I say, 1 cannot necessaiil:
say it included a spscific conversation with the President. re

perfectly content to have thie discussed with the Stata Depart-
i ment in the field, i , the Pmbassy, if this should prove to
be necessary.

Senator Schweiker. Mr. Bissell testified before this
Committee that T4n high quarters hers” meant the Presidant to
him, I assume that you are not as convinced of that as Mr.

Bissell?

Mr. Twsedy. I do not think “it a question of conviction.

Director who would talk directly with the Director. Conceiv-

ably ~~ I do not say he did not, and IT do not say he did. ‘He

i may even have talked to the senior mambers of tha government:
I did not.

Senator Schweiker. Sis also testified thet the further
part of the paragraph, consequently we conclude that kis ren
that ramoval meant assassination.

Does that or dows that not concur with vou?

Mr. Tweedy, Tt does not concur; it would refer to assas-
sination but not exclusively.

Senator Schwuiker. [Tt qoes on to say “We further author:

TOP SECRET



axpanditures of up to $100,000 to carry out any programa an
which you do not have the opportunity to consult. Plea:
advise.”

Does that not mean to you, here de $100,000, do with it as
you want, you do not have to consult if you do not have the
opportunity?

Mr. Tweedy, This ia cartainly the way it would read. 1
vesd it, and T think I read it at the time, when you are talking,

about that kind of money and crash programs, what you are talking

basically are political action type programs, not assassination

type programs.

Senator Schweiker. Of course’:

Mr. Tweedy. Tho beginning of that paraqraph says, “Hence
Swe wish to give you wider authority,” et catera, et cetera,
*ineluding more aqgresaive action, if it can remain covert.”

Sunator Schweiker. What does the term mean, "mors
aggressive action? How aagressive can you get, even more
aogressiva, “including even more accressive action, 1 it can
remain Covert” meaning if you can get away with it.

Mr. Tweedy, Corract.

My own belief is, because quite frankly T cannot rece]!
what this had specific reference to -- my beltef is that thy
hed reference to general political action along the lines o°
mounting succassful political operations against Lumumba. ©

is the sort of thing that would cost a lot of money.

TOP SECRET



Of course, we know now that at the time, *
or very shortly about the same time we were sending poison down
| there, certainly it was not political action. In light of what
"wa know now, would it not mwan fairly clearly that this was an
authorization for an assassination?

Mr. Tweedy. No, sir, I do not believe so, for tha simple

| reason that although we sent, pr. cottlieij and his mater

down to the Conqo, the chief of Station waa always exploring.

ag many of thaas cables indicata, other means of qatting rid of
Lumumba besides assassination. It was always, certainly in my

mind, and I think in Mr, Bissell's mind, a clear realization --

and certainly the Chief of Station's mind -- shat whan evary

thing had been axamined, 4 suecagsful way of doing assassination

was not necessarily to be axpacted. Maybe it would, but it

was not necessarily to be expucted.

Thus, it was incumbent upon the Chief of Station to keap

his eye on the whole spectrum of possibilities of aatting rid

of Lumumba, politically or any othar wav.

Senator Schweiker. We know two thinas now in light of
this. One is he asked an vecant to kill Lumumba, one agent
declined. We asked another avent to no down and do that, :
he assented. Since he specifically mantionad the two saparete:

s he was weaver asked to assassinate Lumumba, When you say that

I characterized it es exploratory, may I just axpatiate on thes
for @ moment?

Whenever, under our system and in our profession, you «ao

to the field asking that something be accomplished which aad

is not the sort of thing that you just do off the top of your
head, like having lunch with Mr. Smith tomorrow, but achieving
the difficult result, the task of the field is to explore the
feasibility of such a request by Headquarters.

This might be done quite quickly. It might take an
infinite amount of time. Headquarters would expect the field
to report regularly on its progress, giving lleadquarters a chance
to comment, as we have dons in this traffic. This particular
modus operandi was no different in this case than the cases of
' infinitely less sensitivity or importance. that aspect of it
was quite routine, There was no way in tha world that the Chin!
\ of Station was goins to come back, air, I understand what you

inkling that this was qoing to occur, It took him obviously,

what you know about the business, would he have conducted
himself any differently than what you now see as this case?

Mr. Bweedy. Not the slightest. He would consider himself
in a disciplined organization, a servant of his chain of command
af a member of the organiaation and not receiving some direct
word from the President which, in affect, would have made him
feel to go out and do anything he pleased,

Mr. Kirbow. Is it not the paramount situation, the non-
attribution type situation, was the only thing that he coul4
undertaks, that it could not be attributed to the United States?

Mr. Tweedy. That was inherent in a1] of the correspondance
on the subject, our intercourse in the field on this. tth
this makes it amply clear in something lixe thin, on attridu-

tion obviously would be very important. The other was just

! plain feasible access.

Mr. Xirbow. Thank you.

Mr. Tweedy. I would immediately have ehared it with Mr.

and I know Mr. Bissell would have talked to Mr. Dulles, Where
; 4t would have gone from thera, I just cannot do anything more
than epaculate, I do not think that would be very helpful.

My duty was quite cluar. 1 was charged up the chain

Mx. BL 11. I would say, profaseionally this seems sound or
' professionally T do not agree with it.

Mr, Smothars. It is your assumption that it would have

of work with tha Adency?

Mr. Tweedy, T think that would be fair to say, but that

: would depend so much on tha understanding butwaen Mr. Dulles
and the policy levels of qovernment to which ft was not privy,

1 really cannot comment substantively on that.

Mr. Smothers. I have some problem in looking back at the

Mr. Tweedy. The only one to which I was aver exposed of

Me, Smothera. In terms -- the only one of its kind, you

Mr. Tweady. Let us be quite clear: exactly. I was never

was 1 aware of any other, so this was the only ona that rt

Mr. Smothars. After lecking at the documented evidence,

To put it differently, there was no reason for ma to,
because I would have had nothing to say to him that I was not

Mr. Schwarz, In that sense, you would distinguish him

Mr. Tweedy. No, let ma try to answar your question, which

; has to be answered more fully than just discussing Lumumba.
Tha concern with Lumumba was not Feally the concern with

Lumumba as @ person. [t was concerned at this very preqnant

1) pednt in the new African development of the effect on the

“ balance of the Continent of 2 disintegration of the Congo, ant

‘it was the general feeling that Lumumba had it within nis

* power to bring about this dissolution, and this was the fear
that it would merely be the start -- the Congo, after all, was

, the largest geographical expression.” Contained in it ware
enormously important mineral resources. Africa as a whole,
the Congo itself, is adjacent to Nigeria, which at that point
was considered to be one of the main hopes of the future
stability of Africe, and if the Conde had fallen, then the
Chencas were Nigeria would be saized with the sama infection.

This was why Washinston, after the point the Western

world was so concerned about Lumumba, not because there was

something uniqua about Lumumba, but tt was the Conqo.

Mr. Schwarz. Pid you ever consider in your discussion of

thie subject what effect i¢ would have on the United States!
position in Africa if it were to be known. the policy makers
in Africa sat around thinking about killing Patrice Lumumba?

Mr. Tweedy. Policy makers in America?

Mr. Tweedy. Indeed we did, which waa one of the reasons,
