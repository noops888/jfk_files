A. REFORT O1 FINDINES

ROTC ASC at Fort Riley, Kansas.

In July 1981, while Source was assigned an an

Individual Tactical Training (ITT) Instructor at Fort Riley, Kansas, he re-

ceived performance evaluations from SUBJECT'S peers and cadre personnel de-

scribing SUBJECT as immature and unable to interact with HIS peers. As a result

of these reports, SUBJECT was required to appear before an administrative review

The review board was to decide if SUBJECT was to be given credit for

completing ASC. Source, acting as defense representative for SUBJECT, sub-

mitted testimony to the board that SUBJECT should be granted credit for ASC.

Source could not recall any specific statements other than saying SUBJECT was

immature but should be given the benefit of the doubt and be granted credit

for completing ASC. The board ruled that SUBJECT would be given credit for ASc.

Upon completion of ASC, SUBJECT was to report for Annual Training (AT) with

C Battery, 128th Field Artillery Battalion, MNG, Marshall, Missouri. When

SUBJECT returned to KMSC approximately 15 September 1981, HE told Source that

HE had failed to attend HIS AT. (NFI). SUBJECT further stated HE had attended

airborne training at fort benning, Georgia, "from August 1981 to September 1901,

(NFI). In September 1981, SUBJECT'S financial trouble led to HIS disenrollment

from KMSC, which subsequently led to SUBJECT being disenrolled from the ROTO

program, (NF1).

In approximately February 1981, Source was informed by Thomas McCarthy,

Professor,

that SUBJECT and McCarthy debated the benefits of National

Socialism (Nazism) during McCarthy's American Government class.

SUBJECT'S

support for Nazism enraged the other students and further widened the gap with

SUBJECT'S peers, (NFI). Source believed SUBJECT to be loyal to the United

but, because of HIS beliefs on Nazism and Communism, 'HE was branded

"Anti-US" by HIS peers.

Source, personally could not recall any occasions in

which SUBJECT specifically denounced the United States Government. In approx-

imately May 1981, Booker T. Washington, SUBJECT'S former Cadet Commanding

Officer, A Company, KMSC, told Source that he was having trouble with SUBJbCT.

Washington related that because of SUBJECT'S beliefs in Nazism, and HIS

"superior" attitude over HIS peers, HE was alienating HIS peers against HIM.

Washington related further that SUBJECT had gone AWOL overnight in approx-

imately April 1981 to attend a debate between the Grand Wizard of the ku Klux

Klan (KKK) and a representative of the National Association for the Advancement

of Colored People (NAACP). The debate was held in Columbia, Missouri.

Washington also advised Source that SUBJECT had National Socialist reading mate-

rial in HIS barracks room, (NFI). Source did not know Washington's presont

address, only that Washington may be in the Berkley of Oakland, California

area, (NFI).

Source believed SUBJECT was mentally stable, but emotionally immature.
