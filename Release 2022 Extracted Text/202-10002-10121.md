‘THE JOINT STAFF

MEMORANDUM FOR THE CHAIRMAN, JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF

Subject: Military Personnel Detailed to the
Central Intelligence Agency (C)

1. (C) In response to your request, attached at Tab A is
a summary of the service personnel currently on detail to
the CIA. The report includes a breakdown by rank and service,
and by country of assignment. The attached information was
provided by the Director of Personnel, CIA, because the
personnel syStems of the two services providing the bulk of
the personnel are not programmed to respond promptly to your
request.

2. (S) In the pursuit of the requested information SACSA
learned that the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Systems
Analysis) on 11 August 1966 signed a letter to the CTA
approving the Agency request for military manpower spaces
for FY 1967. (Total 874, see copy of memorandum at Tab B.)
The entire action on the Agency manpower request was handled
by ASD/SA with the Services through Secretarial channels.
The JCS were neither consulted nor requested to coneur in
this major CIA support action. However, it will be noted
that a copy was furnished your office.

3. (S) I believe that lack of involvement of the JCS in

the matter of the annual military manpower authorization.to

CIA is a serious omission. It stems from an OSD/OSO directive
of 1957 which was pertinent as long as the Erskine-Lansdale
office existed. (Copy attached at Tab c.) When Lansdale's
office was disestablished in 1963 the OSD’ directive should have
been rescinded and replaced by an appropriate JCS directive.
With your approval SACSA will initiate the necessary action
with ASD/SA and CIA to insure that future personnel actions
involving CIA are properly actioned within the JCS organization.
