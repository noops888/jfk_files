opening individual cases on those persons rather than

veloping the information in captioned matter. It does

not appear that mere membership or leadership in captioned

organization is suflicient basis for opening such cases

unless the activities of the individuals come within the

purview of Section 87 D of the Manual of Instructions or

meet the criteria for the Security Index or one of the

Reserve Indices.

Rerep is classified "Contidential." Cover

Page D states it is so classified since data reported by

T-I "could reasonably result in identification of a

confidential source of continuing value and compromise the

electiveness thereoi." T-l is identified on Cover Page C

as Patrick Price who requested his identity be protected.

The major criteria for classilying a communication is

whether the disclosure of the information or the compromising

of a source or informant would adversely affect the national

defense intorests of the Nation.

It cannot be seen how the

compromising of Price, who i not an established confidential

source or informant, would have such an adverse eifect.

Denver should re-evaluate this matter and advise by return

aircel whether or not the report should remain classified as

diascmination is being held in abayance pending receipt of

this information.

5.

RereD. discloses that most of the information

reported deals with the Denver area.

Denver shoald advise

by return airtel'the extent and results of the investigation

conducted to determine il there are any units of "Minutemen"

active in the other parts of Colorado and in the State of

Wyoming.

The above shoul receive expeditious attention.
