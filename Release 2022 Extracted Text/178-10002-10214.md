MEMORANDUM

TO : The File

FROM 3 ‘Davia W. Belin

SUBJECT : Interview with James P. O'Connell

Belin: This is a memorandum of an interview with James P.
O'Connell, who resides at-~

O'Connell: 1333 Elsinore Avenue, McLean, Virginia

B: And what's your zip code there?

O: 22101

B: And what's your ‘phone number?

O: 356-9666

B: The date of this interview is May 17, 1975, and Mason

Cargill of the Commission staff is also present. I

reviewed with Mr. O'Connell matters pertaining to an ali
pilot to assassinate Fidel Castro of Cuba. Mr, O'Connell says
that he is not certain now concerning particular dates when
matters might or might not have taken place because they in-
volve situations that took place approximately fifteen years
ago. And he also says that he believes that he made some
notes which the last time he knew the notes were in the
personal safe of Howard Osborne who was then Director of the
Office of Security, and he indicates that with regard to
particular matters of this interview that the best recollection
he could make would be if he had the notes in front of him.
He is goingand try to see if he can get those notes but the
interview is going to be based on his best recollection now
in the absence of his notes. Is that accurate, Mr. O'Connell?

THOT * a

AMVdaIT

O: Correct.
B: Mr. O'Connell I believe that you said that you came

to the CIA from the FBI approximately in 1951, Is
that correct?

a


O: December 1951.
B: And when you came to the CIA, what @id you do?
O: I was assigned to the Office of Security and ini-

tialiy my first assignment was a desk chief, the
title of--at that time, I believe was Covert Security
Clearance Branch, or Desk.

' B: And then what did you do?

O: Well, I progressed through the years in the Office

of Security--it's the only office I ever worked with
in the CIA, and eventually when I retired two years ago, I
was Deputy Director of Security for Physical, Technical, and
Overseas Affairs.

Br I believe you said that you were in the metropolitan
Washington area during the latter part of the 1950s
until approximately June of 1962?

: O: That's correct, I was assigned in the Washington

area until I went overseas--the Far East--in June
of '62.

B: During the 1950s, did you ever have an opportunity
to become acquainted with Robert Maheu?

O: Yes, I did.

Br And what was the occasion of that?

O: The occasion was about 1952 or '53. He was at that

time working independently as a security consultant
and he had just left the job with Small Business Administra-
tien where he was the Security Officer and he was striking
out for himself. Robert Cunningham, who was my boss at that
time, knew Maheu and the FBI had high regard for his capa-
bilities and abilities, and we were looking for a covert
asset in the Office of Security and Mr. Maheu was struggling
in the sense that he didn't have very much capital. We gave
him a retainer so he could open up an office and in return
he did certain assignments for us.

B; In the Office of Security.
O: For the Office of Security.
Bs For the Office of Security. Maheu had been an FBI

agent at one time. Is that correct?

HW 50955 Dochd:32275519 Page 3

AUVddIT GUOd “A CTWaID FHL WONT AaODOLONA


O: Right.

Br And do you remember off-hand what the retainer was?
O: I believe we gave him $500 a month.

B: Subsequently, did you have contact with him from

time to time over the latter part of the 1950s?

O: Well, from the time I was assigned as his case offi-

cer, which was approximately 1953-54, again I'm not
too sure of the dates, I handled him, if you want to call
itmthat; until 1962 when I went overseas.

Br You were his case officer?
O: Right.
Br Now, I want, to ask you whether or not you ever heard

inside the Agency of any plansor schemes which might
have involved the assassination of any foreign leader other
than Fidel Castro?

OG: Iocan say categorically no.

Br To the best of your knowledge has the Agency ever
been involved in any plots involving murder or assas-
sination of anyone in this country?

Oo: Not. to my knowledge.

B: Now, Mr. O'Connell, some time in the latter part of

1960, according to our interview before-we started
making this tape, you said that Shef Edwards came to you
with regard to a particular matter. Is that correct?

O: That's correct.

Br. Could you just relate what Edwards said to the best
of your recollection and what you said.

O: Yes. He indicated that he had gotten the--the office

had gotten--the assignment to come up with somebody
or some organization that could take on the assassination of
Fidel Castro, and he thought perhaps Bob Maheu might know
somebody that we could contact or he could contact, and I was
told to talk to Bob, which I did.

ade ~ :

B: Did Edwards state to you who gave him the assignment?
O: Well, as far as I recall he said it was Bissell.
B: Did he ever state whether or not the Director of
Central Intelligence, Mr. Dulles, knew about the
i matter?
O: Yes, he did.
Br And what did he say?
O: .He said it had the approval of Mr. Dulles.
B: All right. Do you have any idea «° approximately

when such a conversation would have taken place
between you and Edwards?

QO: No, Not at all. I--as I say~~I think I have or I
have some sort of material that may give the approximate
dates, but I don't know at this point.

B: Do you know whether it would have been in 1960 or in
1961?

O: My guess would be probably 1960, but again I just can't
be sure.

B; Do you know if it would have been in 1960 if it would

have been in the first part or the last part of 1960?

oO: Well, I do recall that I think it was October that I
met ~ROselli for the first time, and that was at the

Plaza Hotel in New York, and my guess is it was probably

October 1960, but again I don't--it could have been 1961.

AUVddIT dod “Wd G1IWaFD FHL WONT AGODOLONG

B: All right. Really, what you're saying is that you

have no exact recollection as to when it was except
your best recollection right now was that it was in the Fall
of 1960. Is that correct?

O: That's right.

B: Now you mentioned | Roselli. Before we get to Mr.
“Roselli, did you get in touch with Maheu?

O: I didn't know "Roselli. Maheu was the man that con-
tacted fRoselli.

HW 50955 DocId:32275519 Page 5


-5-

B: _ All right. After Edwards talked to you to get in
touch with Maheu. Did you get in touch with Maheu?

O: Yes.

B: And what did you say to Maheu, and what did he say

to you, if you remember?

O: Well, I explained what the project was all about.
He wasn't particularly happy about taking on the
assignment, primarily, I guess, because he was .getting very
close with the Hughes people and they were demanding a lot
of his time and he didn't feel he could spend too much time
“with us, but he did aiso recognize the fact that we had in
the past subsidized him, and he felt that ‘he owed us the
~~he was committed to a degree, and he took it on on that
basis.

B: And then what happened?

O: Well, he said he knew a fellow out in Las Vegas, |

because at that point that's where Hughes was operat—
ing out of. He didn't know his background but he figured he
must be somewhere involved with organized groups out there
because he--as he understood it--he had the ice machine con-
cession of all the casinos out there, and he identified him
as a fellow by the name of “Roselli. 1 met “Roselli--he came
in to New York--

{End of tape 1, .begin tape 2)

B: Now you mention that you met ‘Roselli in New York.
Was that pursuant to a pre-arranged plan with Maheu?

O; That's correct. He asked “Roselli to come to New

York and that he had something he wanted to talk with
him about. I was introduced to.. Roselli as an associate of
Bob Maheu~-the discussion pretty much on the basis of Maheu
having several international clients who had interests down
in Cuba. They were concerned about losing their investments,
and they were pooling together a sum of money that they could
offer if somebody could eliminate Fidel Castro. Initially
“Roselli didn't want any part of it. We did appeal to him
on the basis that this was in the best interest of national
security--at that time of course we were aware of the fact
that the Cubans--the Russians were bringing in missiles, and
so forth and that they were threatening the country.

b=

B: Well, let me backtrack a minute. The Cuban missile
: crisis was in October of 1962, and I believe you
said that you left for the Far East in June of 1962, but of
course, did you mean that this conversation took place when
the Soviets were bringing missiles in there, or iust that
they had Soviet influence there? .

0: It was the Soviet influence. I now withdraw that
because I guess we really didn't know that there
were missile there but we knew there was a potential for

it there.

B: Were you introduced as being a person from the CIA?

O: No, I was introduced as being an associate of Bob
Maheu-who worked for Bob Maheu.

B: And what name did you use?

0: At that time I used my true name, O'Connell.

B: When you met with Roselli for the first time?

QO: Right.

B: All right, then what happened?

0: Well, he eventually decided he would try to help us

but he made it quite clear, if it was in the interest
of national security and so forth, that he would do it. He
didn't want to do it for any compensation - he never did
take any money, paid his.own way, not only his hotel fees,
but he also paid for his air flights and so forth and so
on. I don't think that I was fooling him, I think he knew
who I was. :

B: You mean by that that you were a CIA agent?
Q: That's right.
B: Did you ever mention any particular sum involved

that might he paid?

GO: Yes, we said that this syndicate, these groups,
were willing to pay I think it was a $100,000.

HW 50955 Docld:32275519 Page 7

AMVdGIT Quod -u GIvagD gH Nous AdOD0LOHaA


B: It was a figure that you think right now was a

$100.000?
0 I think it was, right.
B: It could have been more - it could have been less?
(o} Right.
B: And when you say this syndicate you are referring

to the ostensible group of international businesses
that supposedly were trying to arrange this? Is that

correct?

O: Right.

B: Now, what happened after this conversation?

0: Well, Bob Miheu and I went down to Miami, we met

Roselli and he was staying at the time at the
Fontainebleau and he said that he would work out some deal
where he could get in touch with people in Cuba that could
handle the assignment. Bob was being pressed by Hughes and
he was sort of commuting back and forth from L.A. to Miami-
subsequently I was sort of left with Roselli as sort of his
hand-holder and Bob was spending more and more time out in
the West Coast. He did get in touch with these people who
I didn't know who they were, he said that they were types
that had contacts in Cuba and they could handle the assign-
ment. Eventually I did meet a fellow by the name of Sam
Gold who I later found out was Sam Giancana. I didn't
know it at the time. Imet a fellow who was identified as
Joe who was considered a claims courier ~ I found out he
was Trafficante who was one of the top Mafia ficures and
this all came out when we saw their pictures in the Sunday
newspaper. lb to that point neither Bob Maheu nor myself
knew really who we were dealing with.

AMWdGIT GYOI “A AIVEED FHL WOUT AGODOLOHa

B: Now, do you remember about when this first meeting
in Miami took place?

oO: Well, again, I say if I met Roselli in October which
I'm just staking as the starting point in October
"60, it was probably sometime in February of '61.

B: Now, at that particular time the Bay of Pigs
operation was being planned. Do you know if there
was any relationship between what you were doing and the

Bay of Pigs operation? -

HW 50955 DocTd:32275519 Page 8


O: There was absolutely none. As a matter of fact
the project handling the Bay of Pigs had absolutely

no idea of what was going on as far as we were concerned,

We had no relationship with the project down there, it

was an entirely separate operation.

B: The only relationship might have been the fact

that Bissell knew what you were doing and Bissell
was involved with the direction of the Bay of Pigs. Apart
from that relationship you don't know of any other?

0: There wasn't any other. Of course, Colonel King,

who was the W.H, Division Chief, naturally was
involved with the Bay of Pigs project and he knew about
this, but that's where we were cut off.

B: I believe you said that the knowledge of this
particular project at the time you were involved
was kept to a very few people, is that correct?

0: That's correct.
B: Who knew besides you and Colonel Edwards?
0: Well, starting from the top I assume, I only can

assume, that Mr. Dulles and certainly Mr. Bissell
because I sat in Mr. Bissell's office when we discussed
it so at a later time, not at the inception of it but I,
at one point, we had sort of a reporting situation where
we brought him up to date on it. J.C. King - Colonel
J. C, King, W. H. Division, the Chief of T.S.D. who I
think at the time was probably one of the Roosevelts,
either Corney or Archie, I don't know which one, the
people in T.S.D. at the lower echelon as far as I k
were never officially briefed on it. There was a Dr
:TreicHerand a Dr. Gunn, but I don't - they may have known
what was going on but they were not as far as I know ever
officially briefed.

I

B: Gunn is G-U-N-N and TréichHer is T~R-E-I~C-H-L-E~R °
I believe, is that correct?

0: Right.

B: Did Banneman Edwards’ assistant know at the time?

Oo: No.

AUVdGIT Tsod “a CIVUID AWL WoNd AdODOLONA


B:
Oo:

Now, you mentioned T.S.D. how did they get involved?

Well, they got involved in the determining whether
they could come up with some sort of esoteric

materials to take care of the assignment.

Br
“0:

This was rather than using a gun, is that correct?

Well tHe, I guess this was discussed beyond me.
I don't know. . I think they thought that they'd

use something a little bit more exotic than just having

an out-and-out shoot-out. I don't know who made that

decision,

B: Well, to the best of your knowledge were pills
developed inside the Technical Services Division?

O: Yes.

B: And these were pills designed to poison and kill
someone?

0: That's right.

Br Do you know what kind of pills they were? The
technical names that were used for them?

QO: No. All I know is that it had a very lethal
amount of botulism. :

B: And the pills were supposedly going to dissolve
in liquid. . .

O: That's right.

B: Now, did you ever obtain any of these pills?

O: Yes.

B: And when you got them to whom did you give them?

O: To sRoselli.

Br Do you knew approximately whether this took place

HW 50955 DocId:32275519

Again, I'd say it was probably '61 because I have
to @ back to the, and if I'm wrong on the starting
en I'm going to be wrong on all of my dates. I

y it was October '60 that I first met ‘Roselli so
have to be ‘61.

You said it would have to be in 1961, is that
correct?

Isay if my starting figure is October '60.

Right, now approximately how many pills did you
turn over, if you remember?

IT know - it ‘probably was either three or four.~

And where did you get the pills?

They were delivered

to me in Colonel Edwards!
office by Dr er’

éri.

Was Colonel Edwards there?

Yes.
(End of tape 2, begin tape 3)

When you got the pills in Colonel Edwards office,
then what did you do with them?

Well, I don't know exactly how it came about but
I eventually gave them to - Roselli.

And do you know to whom Roselli gave them?

Well, again, I'm a little vague on the sequence, but
I think he eventually turned them over to Sam Gold
as we knew him who in turn turned them over to Juan
Orta but I don't know whether anything in

that chain whether Sam got it directly from

Roselli or there was some intermediate person
there or what the sequence was I don't know.

duan Orta was a person inside Cuba.

As far as I know, yeah.

-ll-

You never had any personal knowledge that the pills
actually got there?

NO.

It was hearsay so far as you were concerned?

That's right.

Did anyone tell you the pills were there?

Roselli said that they were delivered into Cuba
but I'm only taking his word.

And Orta was the person that supposedly had access
to Castro?

That was my understanding.
Then what happened to the best of your knowledge?

Well, things dragged on a bit. I returned to
Washington and then we got the word that Orta got
cold feet. He didn't want to get involved. The
pills apparently were returned to Gold, back to
Roselli and to the best of my knowledge I brought
them back to Washington and they were kept in the
Agency until they worked up another deal with Tony
Verona.

When you say they worked up another deal, who do
you mean by they?

Roselli and his people down there.

And what was the substance of the deal with Tony
Verona?

Well, Tony Verona was one of the leaders of the
Junta who became apparently discouraged with the
way the Agency was handling their operations down

there.

Was Verona an exile of Cuba?

Yes and he...

He lived in the Miami area?

He lived in Miami and he became disanchanted with-
apparently became impatient with the way the Agency
was handling things and the word was out that he
wanted to start his own little show, and how they
knew that I don't know, but they did and so they
approached Verona and asked if he would take on
the assignment, which he did with certain stipula-
tions. He wanted $10,000 worth of gear and an
amount of money, which I think could vary between
$50 and $100,050, I really don't know. There was
money involved upon delivery of the assignment.

Did you assist in getting the gear?

Yes, we went down - we had a man from our Commo
Division who really didn't know what he was buying
or what was involved but I had to use him as an
expert not knowing too much about the Commo gear
and we were told specifically what Verona wanted
so we had a shopping list and we went down and this
Commo man bought the equipment.

By Commo, you mean communications?

Communications, right.

And, that equipment was turned over to Verona?
That was delivered to Verona.

Who delivered it?

Seems to me that, now here's where I get real big.
I'm not so sure that this wasn't at the time that
I was turning this whole project over to Bill
Harvey...

Pardon me, go ahead.

Because I remember one of the last things I was
involved in was turning over some equipment.
Roselli and I delivered the material.

By material, you mean the pills?

HW 50955 Docld:32275519

No.
The equipment?

And I think that was probably the last act I was
involved in.

When did you turn the project over to Bill Harvey,
if you remember?

It would be April of '62, that I can pinpoint that.

Now with regard to Verona, did you turn the pills
over to Verona too? ‘

No. As far as I know, I. didn't.

Well, you mentioned in our interview that there was
then going to be a chef who was going to put the
pills in Castro's beverages at a restaurant?

Yes, well that was before Harvey got involved as

I recall. We brought back the pills the second
time. This should be somewhere in here, we're
getting a little beyond our story at this point.
Well, let me go back -.the first stage was to

deliver some pills to Juan Orta who supposedly
had access to Castro, is that correct?

That's right.

“And then Orta either lost the access or in your
phrase "got cold feet" and the pills were delivered
back?

Right.
Then were they redelivered again?
They were pedelivered again because they had this
new asset or somebody that had access to the kitchen
where Castro used to frequent - the restaurant.
By access supposedly a chef or someone.
A chef, yes, I would assume.

You don't know whether it was a chef or waiter or
waitress?

I can't be sure.

And, then what happened so far as the delivery of
the pills the second time?

This again I'm very vague, I have a recollection
and I may be wrong. I think we got the pills back
again and I think when I left the pills were back
at headquarters.

So, what happened is that either. the person didn't
have access in the restaurant or if the person did
have access Castro stopped frequenting the restaurant
T assume it was one of those two possibiliites.

I don't know.

You don't know whether it was either one of those?
Well, the pills eventually got back and some time
after they got back and you aren't quite sure of
these dates, but you do know that eventually you
turned the whole matter over to Bill Harvey, is
that correct?

In April of '62, that is something I can say with
quite a bit of positiveness.

And then Bill Harvey became Roselli's case officer,
is that correct?

Right.

Now, do you believe that before you turned the
matter over to Harvey that Roselli knew that you
were a CIA employee?

He told me he knew. I never admitted it, but he
knew. He told me so.

I think you said he referred to you as "Big Jim?"
That's right.

And that at times he introduced you not under your
correct name, is that correct?

When he introduced me to his friends the name
Olds was used.

By his friends do you mean Sam...

Sam and Trafficante ‘and -I only met them on two
oceasions.

Do you know where that was?

Yes, first time I met them was in a clothing store
which cbviously was one of their headquarters. It
was down on Miami Beach. I don't know what street
it was but it was a sort of an areade type thing

and he wanted to buy me a shirt. He said I looked

a little seedy which, of course as government
employees, you know, sometimes you don't dress that
well. But, anyway, he insisted on buying me a shirt
but we went into this place, which I thought was
just walking off the street, and in there we met

all his friends. They had a big office in the back.
But I couldn't tell you what street it was or where”
it was. It was in Miami Beach.

Would this have been in the first part of '61?

I don't know.

It was during the winter of 1960-61?

Probably.

When was the second time you met the people?

I met them at the Fontainebleau, Bob Maheu, and
Johnnie and I went to dinner there one night and

we ran into Sam - Sam Gold (Giancanno). It was

just a shake-hand type of thing. We didn't spend
much time with them. That's the only two times I've

ever met the man.

Do you:know when that second occassion was,

Yeah. Bob got a call from Sam saying that he was
disturbed from reports he was getting from Las
Vegas that his girlfriend, who is Phyliss McGuire,
was having an affair with Dan Rowan, who they were
both entertaining apparently in the night clubs
there. And he was going to go back to Las Vegas

to straighten this thing out to his satisfaction.
This would have interuppted the project at a very
eritical time and the only alternative was if Bob
would run a tap on Rowan's room to determine what
was going on. ‘I say Rowan's room, it may have been
McGuire's room, I'm not sure one way or another.
But in any event this was one of, the conditions
that he would stay on and continue on the project.
Maheu told him that he did not have the facilities
or the assets to do such a thing but when Gold said
that he was going to leave, Bob agreed to get
somebody to do the job and he got a former friend,
or an FBI-former FBI man that he knew in Miami to
send a crew out and they did, in effect, instead of
bugging the room they bugged the telephone, which
was not what they were supposed to do and they
eventually were caught.

Now this resulted in some disclosures that had to be
made to the FBI or Department of Justice as I under-
stand it, is that correct?

As I understand it, that is correct. It occurred
while I was out of the country.

You mean the meeting with the Attorney General?
That's right.

Do you know whether or not the request for help
from Sam Gold came at a time that you were in the
process d@ trying to get the pills delivered over
there to Cuba?

Well, it certainly must of been because as I recall
it was a critical time and so I can just put things
together. I assume that that was when we were
trying to do it.

And so basically again you stated you aren't quite
sure of dates but if your original date of October
1960 of your first conversations with Roselli are
correct, ‘this would have placed the Sam Gold
incident sometime in the first part of 1961, so far
as the Phyliss McGuire bugging, is that correct?

I. could have been, I couldn't be sure. It could
have been later than that.

Okay. Now, I've asked you whether or not you know
of any CIA files on this matter and I wish you
would respond to that for the record.

Well, as I mentioned to you it was a very closely

held project. There was nothing, as far as formal
files were concerned. I did periodically write
memoranda for the record. I don't know where

they are now. They were at one time kept in Howard
Osborn's office. I assume thev're still there or mawha
they've been destroyed. I don't know, I have no
access to them.

Any other facts that you might want to add that
you think might in any way be relevant to our

inquiries here?
I don't have any.

Any other facts which relate in any manner whatsoever
to any alleged assassination plots against Castro?

No, this is ‘he only - as I say, I was assigned
as case officer to Bob Maheu. J got my instruc-
tions and I contacted Bob and my involvement was
as I stated right now, that's about it.

Mr. O'Connell, John McCone took over the position
as Director of Central Intelligence in late 1961,
do you. have any knowledge as to whether or not he
was ever briefed about this project?

I don't - his name never came up. All I know is
that Mr. Dulles was aware of it. Mr. McCone's

name never came up.

You went over to the Far East in June of 1962,
when did you come back to the country then?

I came back in July of 1965.

Do you hear any information as to what took place
with the pwoject after you turned Roselli over

to Harvey?

I never have, I don't think I ever met Harvey

or saw Harvey from the time I turned Roselli over.
I did see Roselli once. We had a social luncheon
but nothing was ever discussed. JI have no idea
what transpired after I left.

When was that social luncheon, approximately, if
you remember?

Probably sometime in 1966,

Anything else you can think of that might in any
way be relevent to the inquiries: of this Commission?

I don't have anything.

Now, I have one more question, Mr. O'Connell. You
indicated that you knew the people that you might
be dealing with, at least Roselli and subsequently
Sam Gold, might be what you called in an interview
"tough guys" or "Mobsters" but when you first met
them did you know that they were involved with the
Mafia.

No, we had no idea. Maybe we should have but we,
neither Bob Maheu or myself were aware that they
were in the Mafia and that came out eventually by
seeing their pictures in the Parade supplement ‘in

a Miami newspaper and that's the first time we knew
we were dealing with Sam Giancanno and a fellow, I
forget his first name, trafficante who we knew under
a different name.

And, after yu knew that ‘these people were Mafia
people, did that change your plans at all?

Well, at that point it was sort of beyond doing
anything we could change. We were into this thing
so deeply we figured we may as well go along but
we were both a little bit, quite a bit, surprised
that who we were dealing with.

Anything else that you wish to add?

No.

Thank you very much for coming sir.
