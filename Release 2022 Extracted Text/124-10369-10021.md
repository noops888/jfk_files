“CACHITA" mons PROENZA DE ROJAS, complained that Cuba has
become a police jstate and that Cuban authorities have the
family “all tied up." ROJAS and his wife told MEY 197. that

a Cuban communist named JUAN MARINE is a friend of the family.
On one trip to Guba, CACHITA ROJAS asked him to look into the
situation of her sister TERESA PROENZA to see how it could

‘be straightened ‘out. MARINE recently visited Mexico "incognito"

and informed the ROJAS that the situation now is extraordinarily
good but that TERESA was once under a death sentence because
she had dealt with LEE HARVEY OSWALD while assigned to the
Cuban Embassy prior to the assassination of JOHN F, KENNEDY.

Her friends interceded for her and her life was spared. ROJAS
told MEY 197 that MARINE warned them not to tell the Cuban
Embassy in ilexico City that he had spoken to them about this
matter, : :

The source stated that JORGE ROJAS and his wife
do not know how to cope with the present situation, They
fear going to Cuba and they are speaking out against the Cuban
revolution in a most forthright manner. The bitterness dis-
played by ROJAS! wife far exceeds any ‘that a source
can recall in the past.

The source stated that some years-ago, as best he
could recall, he heard JUANA. LUISA PROENZA, a sister of CACHITA
who died some years ago, telling a similar story of how TERZSA
PROENZA was somehow involved with LEE. HARVEY OSWALD at the
Cuban Embassy. At the time TERESA was employed at the embassy,
she lived with JUANA-LUISA and another sister. Within the
family it has always been said that JUANA LUISA worried herself
to death after TERESA was ordered to Cuba,

The Mexico City Cffice has conducted a review of
references to TERESA PROENZA especially those dealing’ with the -

' OSWALD investigation and it is noted that as set forth in eae

Mexico City letter to the Bureau 1/24/64 in. the OSWALD case
MEY 18 and MEX 19, both of whom have furnished reliable infor-
mation in. the past, reported on 1/13/64 that they had conversed
with ELIZABETH CATLETT MORA, Bufile 100-395934, who told them
of a conversation she held with TERESA PROENZA, the Cultural
Attache of the Cuban Embassy in Mexico City. According to
MORA, TERESA PROENZA had told her that OSWALD walked in "cold"
to the Cuban Zmbassy and the first person he talked to was
PROENZA. Since PROENZA did not speak English, she turned him

fe * i .

@hile it ds not clear from available information,
it would appear that PROENZA was able to return from Cuba
for a visit to Mexi¢o following her dismissal and departure
in 1/64, 4 : : : :

By report ‘dated 1/14/65 the CIA reported on the in-
vestigation by the guban government of olc line communist
JOAQUIN ORDSOQUI MASA. In this report it was indicated that
TERESA PROENZA had been arrested at her home and was being
held incommunicado.

A review of the foregoing material indicates that
TERESA PROENZA got into trouble with the Cuban government more
as a result of her criticism of the handling of the OSWALU
matter following the assassination of President KENNEDY than
because of anything: she did when CSWAL) visited the Cuban
Embassy. Her harsh' criticism of aigh Cuban officials (the
kwbassador and Yoreign Minister) was apparently well isnown
in the embassy and hardly helped her case. it fails to
indicate that she cid anything for CSWAL) that would substantiate
the remarks made by JORG NOJAS and his. wife to Mixx 197 that
TERESA PROENZA hac nearly. been.executed because of her activities
during CSYALD's visit to the Cuban Embassy in 1963. In the
absence of additional informetion regarding this activity, no
further investigation is contemplatec at this time. it is
noted that it is not feasible to directly interrogate JORGE
RCJAS or his wife. However, Mx 197 will closely follow this
matter with them and any additional, significant developments
will be called promptly to the attention of the Bureau.

Cne information copy is being furnished to Philadelphia
in view of their. interest in,ALVARO PROENZA. Concerning ALVARO
PROENGA, MBE 197 reported on“7/5/79 that he hac recently visited
the ROJiS family: in Mexico City anc CACHITA remarked that
ALVARO saic he was surrounded by "gusanos" (referring to
Cuban exiles in a Gerogatory manner) in Philadelphia.

LEE HARVEY OSWALD
I§ ~ RUSSIA ~ CUBA

ReBulet 9/12/69 to Assistant Attorney General, Internal
Security Division, copies of which were forwarded to this office.

Enclosed herewith are two Reroz reproductions of the
Mexico City file copies of Mr. CHARLES THOMAS’ memorandum dated
12/10/65, and the memoranda fros this office to the Ambassador
dated 12/27/65 and 3/23/66. .

Background

ELEMA GARRO DE PAZ, or Mies GARRO as Mr. THOMAS calls
her, is a well known figure in Mexican political, social and
literary circles. She was a playwright and well known to many
officials of the Eabessy including the then Ambassador FULTON
FREEMAH, the then Deputy Chief of Mission CLARENCE A. BOOKSTRA,
and many others. All of those officials expressed to me on
various cccasions the epinion that Mies GARRO is a very interesting
person and @ scintillating conversationaliat, but that she has a
vivid imagination and frequently appears to be unable to distinguish
between truth and fiction. Although interesting, they all considered
her ag highly unreliable as ® source of information except for
Mr. THOMAS who apparently placed consisteat credence in what Misa
GARRO0 said. . :

When Miss GARRO visited this offiee in Roveaber 1964, she
claimed that she had seen LEE HARVEY OSWALD at a party given at
the hone of RUHEH DURAN on September 30, Octeber 1, or October 2,
1963,a8 reported in Mexico City letterhead memorandum of 12/11/64.
As previously reported, Miss GARRO claimed that her daughter,

ELENA PAZ GARRO, who accompanied her at that party, met for the
first time a young man later identified by her ag ARIO ALEJANDRO
LAVAGNINI STENIUS. Identification of this individual, who had

(1 = Liaison Section)
1 - Mexico City j
NLF/ako :

(5)



HEX 105-3702

merely been introduced at the party as "ALEJANDRO", was made on
the basis of correspondence received by her daughter from ARIO
ALEJANDRO LAVAGHINI STEIUS after the party. Miss GARRO was

‘insistent ‘that ber daughter had ‘not ‘met’ that young man prior —
te the party. When it was pointed cut to her that the letter
from ARIO ALEJANDRO LAVAGNINI STENIUS was dated °/1/63 and
postmarked 9/2/63, she merely commented that probably the
communists have facilities for falsifying postmarks.

When LAVAGNINI was interviewed, he was unable to fix
the date of the party but he believed it was probably early in
September and neither he nor the two acquaintances of his wao
aecompanied him ‘te the party could recall any Americans having
been present.

Oa 12/10/68 while talking to former Foreign Service .
Officer CHARLES W. THOMAS, Miss GARRO claimed that the party
where she had met OSWALD was held at the home of RUBEN DURAN
“in September 1963, shartly after her return from abroad" as
reported in Mr. THOMAS’ memorandum of 12/10/65,

In her conversation with Mr. THOMAS on 12/25/65 as
reported in bis memorandum of that date, Miss GARRO claimed that
she believed the party waz about September 2 or 3, 1963, "a few
days before the visit of Soviet astronaut GAGARIN™ +

inasmuch as the Bureau is in possession of all of Mr.
THOMAS‘ memoranda concerning ELENA GARRO DE PAZ‘ story except
his memorandum of 12/10/65 (his semoranda are dated the date of
his conversations and not the date typed), copies of that
memorandum are enclosed herewith for the completion of the
Bureau's files. The Bureau will note that all the pertinent
information contained therein is set forth in Mexico City cable-
gram of 12/17/65.

Observations

The following is submitted in response te the Bureau's
request regarding my observations of Mr. THOMAS' statements in
his memorandum furnished to the Secretary of State:

O-. . Ce

_. GQ) With regard to paragraph 3 in which he refers to
his meeting with me and Mr. WINSTON SCOTT, then head of cla,
Mexico: .

. I first met Mr. THOMAS, one of the officers assigned

to the Political Section of the Embassy on 12/17/65, the day
after I took over as Legal Attache, when Mr. SCOTT told me he

hed received a memorandum which he believed I should see. It

was Mr. THOMAS’ memorandum dated 12/10/65. As originally prepared
that mezorandum was designated for the Ambassador, ‘the Deputy
Chief of Mission, the Political Section, Political Research (CIA),
and the Central Biographic Department. He subsequently furnished
this office a copy although that dissemination does not show on
the Embassy file copy of his wemorandum. In view of the nature

Of the ‘information, Mr. THOMAS was asked to join Mr. SCOTT and

me in a conference. Since the investigation of the OS¥ALD case
had been handled by a previcus Legal Attache, I remained non-
coamittal about the allegations made by Miss GARRO, but pointed
out the Bureau's interest in that case. It was algo pointed out
to Mr. THOMAS that the information in his memorandum was in~
complete in many respects, including the fact that Miss GARRO did
not pinpoint the date of the alleged party but described it only as
“in September 1963, shortly after her return fron Europe". He
stated that Miss GARRO was extremely reluctant to discuss the
matter and doubted that she would éiscuss it with anyone else.

He therefore volunteered to raise the subject again with her to
obtain more details. He was thanked at that tise for his
cooperation.

@) Regarding paragraph 5 in which Mr. THOMAS stated
“he got no reaction from Mesars. SCOTT and FERRIS regarding his
memorandum of 12/25/65":

In view of the expressed interest of the Ambessaador and
the Deputy Chief of Hiasion who had received copies of Mr. THOMAS'
nemorand’ of 12/10 and 12/25/65 in the factualness of Miss GARRO’s
story, they were advised by mescranda from this office dated
12/27/68 and 2/23/66, copies of which are enclosed, that in view
of the fact that Miss GARBO's allegations had previously been
eheeked cut without substantiation, no further action was being
taken concerning her recent repetition of those allegations. Those
memoranda were based on Buairtel 12/22/65 and Bulet 2/15/66. Both

-3-

MBX 165-3702

memoranda were sent.on a circulation basis. to Mr. THOMAS'
superior, the Counselor. for Political Affad:
. -¥eceived a copy of Mr. THOMAS' memoranda
- concluded ‘that’ the ‘Counselor’ for “Political. i t
route this cffice's memorandum of 2/23/66 to Mr. THOMAS or
that Mr, THOMAS dooo not recall it.

(3) Regarding paragraph 6 concerning Mr. THOMAS’
interview with me relative to Mise GARRO again having changed
the date of the alleged party to the end of September:

I never interviewed Mr. THCHAS alone. The first time
I saw bim was inthe presence of Mr. SCOTTY. When he visited
my office I called the Agent to whem the case had been ags:
to come in and sit in on the interview. I did not tell him that
Mise GARRO had given the late September date “accurately” when
' she had come to the Eubassy and made her first report. I did
con . tell him that her newly revised date was the same time that she
7 had given when she came to the Embassy in November 1064 to tell
her story. The investigation conducted at that time, as reflected
in Mexico City letterhead memorandum of 12/11/64, showed that
the late September date was not accurate. Neither did I tell
him that someone else who was at e party had stated that
, there were no Americans there. Frankly, although I had reviewed
i the file after this matter first came up in December 1965, I
did not memorize all of the details and I did not recall this
fact which I did not becose aware eof until my current review
in connection with Mr. THOMAS' recent allegations. Neither did
I tell him that I considered the case “closed”. 1 would not
have considered it to be of concern to him whether the case was
_ closed or not. I did tell him in response to his inquiry, that
a it would not be necessary for him to pursue this matter any
further with Hiss GARRO since we had heard her story before and
it had been checked cut without being substantiated and I
therefore considered her story te be a closed issue.

(4) Regarding paragraph 9 in which Mr. THOMAS referred
to Mr. ALLEN WHITE's alleged statement that the Federal Security
Police’ interrogation of the DURANs was unsatisfactory aad
coment, "This transcript may be the source of Mir. FERRIS’ belief®
that ELENA GARRO's story had been checked’out and found to be
untrue”:

3° Docld:32319387 "Page 8 a ’ : en



MEX 105-3702 2

oo This statement is uninformed speculation. I know
-nothirmg about Mr. WHITE's evaluation of the interrogation of
the DURANs which so far as I know,: had nothing te do with the

. story about "the alleged party subsequently ‘related by Mise —
GARRO. iy "belief" was based on the investigation conducted
by this office as reported in Mexico City letter and letterhead
memorandum of 12/11/64, and the Bureau's concurring evaluation
as set forth in Bureau airtel 13/22/65 and Bulet of 2/15/66.

(5) With:regard to paragraph 10 in which Mr. THOMAS
. Commented that “whereas the FBI has discounted ELENA GARRO's
ae allegations, the. CIA is still considerably diaturbed by them":

I am avare of no foundations for this observation that
CIA ig “still considerably disturbed" by Miss GARRO's stery.
Mr. WINSTON SCOTT gave absolutely no indication of such reactions
to me, but on the contrary indicated that he was well aware of
. Miss GARRO'’s unreliability.

With regard to Mr. THOMAS’ claim that CIA may not
have pressed further investigation for several reasons including
“eonsidering the sensitive overlap and subtle conpetition between
two intelligence collection agencies, it had to yield to the
FBI's jurisdiction":

a This can only be described as a product of Mr. THOMAS’
. imagination. During the period in question, relations between
1 this office and CIA in Mexico were maintained on a friendly,
matually cooperative basis with respect for the authority and
responsibilities of the two parent agencies. The principal
function of CIA in Mexico in connection with the investigation
of the OSWALD case was in checking out allegations concerning
possible Cuban aspects through their established sources and
confidential converage. The remaining points covered by ur.
THOMAS under items 2, 3 and 4, paragraph 16, are extransous

to Miss GARRO's story and appear to have been included
gratuitously in his memorandum to the Secretary of State.

(6) With regard to Mr. THOMAS’ terminal comment in
paragraph 13 that the records should show that a representative
of a major American publication has at least some knowladge of
Hiss GARRO'’s story:

-8-

“MEE 105-3702
Sy a

This office has no information indicating such to
be a fact or that either Mr. THOMAS had given the story to such
an individual or that Miss GARRO herself ,.in spite of her _
repeated protestations that she should not be revealed as the
source of this information, had passed the stery on to such an
individual. :

Comments

The significance ig not known as to why the State
Department disseminated Mr. THOMAS' memorandus under the subject
“CHARLES WILLIAM THOMAS", ingtead of under the LEE HARVEY OSWALD
anvestigation as Mr. THOMAS captioned his memorandun.

It appears that Mr. THOMAS has undergone a change in
attitude since his departure from Mexico which is difficult to
understand. This may possibly be a reaction te his separation
from Foreign Service. According to Embassy sources, Mr. THOMAS
is believed to heave been “selected out", a phrase used when an
officer is “retired” after having been in one grada for the
maximum period of time and is not considered qualified for
promotion te a higher grade. ‘This involuntary separation from
| the Foreign Service may account for his present attitude which

i otherwise is difficult to comprehend.
aa .

During the time after { took over as Legal Attache on

H 12/16/65 until his departure from Mexico in 1667, I and other
i personnel of this office had very Limited ceatact with Hr. THOMAS,
H He was one of various officers assigned to the Political Section
| and although he was ostensibly friendly, his assignment had

little in common with the wark of this office and therefore our
relations, both official and personal, were closer with other
officers in the Political Section. The enly official contact
I had with him was in connection with instant matter. Although
at that time he exhibited somewhat of a “detective complex” in
desiring to probe into the story recounted by Miss GARRO, he at
. no time demonstrated 2 desire to take over the OSWALD investiga-
H tion from the authorized authorities.

Mr. THOMAS’ current attitude as set out in his letter
and memorandum te the Secretary of State dated 7/25/69 is obvious
from his statement, "Since I was the Embassy officer in Hexico

-6=

MEX 105-3702

who acquired this intelligence information, I feel a
responsibility for seeing it through to its final evaluation.”

It appears, therefore, that Mr. THOMAS has now decided that he

and not the FBI or the Department of Justice is the one to

decide how the story given by Miss GARRO is to be evaluated.

The concept that every person who passes on to another govern-
ment agency information relating to matters within the jurisdiction
of that agency has the responsibility and authority to review

and evaluate the action taken by that agency is, of course,
untenable.

Further question concerning Mr. THOMAS’ judgment is
raised by item 3 of paragraph 10 of his mem dum furnished to
the Secretary of State. Any reference to the/"close and delicate™{s)
relationship between the head of CIA Mezico and top Mexican
officials, if true, is a very highly classified matter and any
"leak" or revelation to unauthorized individuals concerning such
an arrangenent would, in view of the delicate Mexican political
situation, be disastrous to the Mexican Government as well as
to Mexican-American relations. The delicacy of the situation
has recently been greatly augmented by the published Cuban
allegation that one of the officers of the Mexican Embassy in
Havana was acting as a CIA spy with the knowledge of the Mexican
Government. Mr. THOMAS, however, included such a highly
classified reference in a memorandum which he classified only
as “confidential”, contrary to regulations relative to classification
of documents. While this reference relates to the activities and
operations of another Government agency and therefore is not of
primary concern to the Bureau, it is nevertheless called to the
Bureau's attention for consideration in evaluating Mr. THOMAS'
current allegations.

An additional copy of this letter is being forwarded
for use in the event the Bureau desires to forward a copy to
Dallas which received a copy of referenced Letter.
