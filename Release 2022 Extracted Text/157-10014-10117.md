Re: Richard Goodwin Materialls and Summary

Summary

\
A. Goodwin Interview of July 16, 1975

Mr. Goodwin was interviewed for .a second time
on July 16, 1975. He indicated that he chaired the "Cuba
Task Force" after the Bay of a Paul Nitze had pre-

Hl

viously chaired the group. It was this Cuba Task Force
that suggested the establishment of the Lansdale project.
In this regard, Goodwin noted that Lansdale proved to be
very efficient. Goodwin indicated that he was present
during the conversation between President Kennedy and Tad
Szulc concerning the question of assassinating Castro.
(See Szulc's testimony infra.) | He spoke with the President
after that conversation and remembers JFK saying about
assassination: "We can't get into that -- we'll all be
targets." He noted that Bissell never mentioned anything
to him, Goodwin, about assassination attempts. With regard

to the August 10, 1962, meeting, which he attended, Goodwin
i

noted that McCone never made any oration upon the immorality

iy
of assassinating Castro. He remembered the August 10 meet-
ing and said that “assassination was not shot down". When

pressed for details at this point, and after being shown

the Lansdale (8/13/62) and Harvey (8/14/62) memoranda, he

said he wanted to think about the meeting before he made a
any more statements about who said and did what. He noted, —
however, that in 1966 while in|Peru with Robert Kennedy that

Kennedy, in a fleeting retort to a series of questions

\
about U. S. assassination attempts against Castro, said
i

"Tell him (the interpreter) I saved his (Castro's) life."
At the conclusion of ithe interview he turned over
to the Committee various documents related to Cuba which he
had found in his personal papers. Those are appended to
this summary. H
B. Goodwin Interview of May 27, 1975

During the course of |this earlier’ interview, f

Goodwin alluded to the Cuba Task Force. According to the

Committee notes of that interview, the discussion went as
]

follows: |
|
In general, Goodwin had not heard much
specific talk of assassination, although
it would not have|surprised him if it had
gone on. He mentioned one specific in-
stance in which he had heard talk of

assassinating Castro. After the Bay of
Pigs, a Cuba Task Force was established,
first chaired by Plaul Nitze and then by
Goodwin in his capacity as White House —
Staff Officer. Ati a.meeting of the Task
Force, held at the) State Department,
McNamara suggested "getting rid of Castro",
someone from the CIA, perhaps Bissell,

then asked if McNamara meant "Executive
Action". McNamara’ responded that he did
and stressed his interest in the idea.
However, Goodwin did not bring the topic
up later in the meeting after McNamara
left. (See interview infra.)

Cc. The Goodwin Documents
The documents which Mr. Goodwin has furnished

the Committee are of no startling significance. One docu-
\

ment, the May 2, 1961, memorandum from Bissell to Goodwin,
is noteworthy because it does ae advise him of the Roselli
connection or the efforts to assassinate Castro. Bissell
notes, "I have not attempted te provide you with much

detail." A May 24, 1961, Memorandum of Conversation with

Bissell by Goodwin -does not mention any reference by Bissell
to actions against Castro on the assassination front. An
Arthur Schlesinger memorandum of June 30, 1961, to the i
President discusses the need for revamping of the "intelli-
gence set-up" of the United States. In a footnote in that
memorandum, Schlesinger notes that the CIA is not ‘able to
control its operatives once they are in the field and of

the attendant dangers this poses. (See page 6 of the memo.)

Areas of Inguiry for Goodwin

7 i
-- What, if anything, does Goodwin remember of the August
10, 1962, meeting of the Special. Group which he attended?

-- Is this meeting different than the meeting he refers to pescooean
in his initial interview where McNamara broached the sub-
ject of assassinating Castro? Or has he simply confused
them and are they one and the same?

-- How does he explain McCone's recollection of having given
an oration on the immorality of assassinating Castro when
it was brought up at the August 10 meeting?

-- Was McNamara the person who/jbrought up the subject at
that meeting?

-- What discussion, if any, followed?

2 May 1961

As indicated by the combined INR/ONE estimate, anti-Castro

activity within Cuba will probably be muted at least for the next
several months, Most individuals whose loyalty is in any way

suspect have been arrested, A recent report from the Swiss

Ambassador indicated that political prisoners now number 100,000,

All internal services will continue to work ou a theory of repression
. /
plus undoubtedly swift and brutal penalties. Consequently, it will be

' very difficult to.carry on any clandestine operations and it is doubtful ae

j
that such operations can have any significant impact in weakening

the Castro regime.

In spite of this, evidence is still available that there is opposition :

' to the regime among individuals still at/large and that such opposition ‘

is prepared to undertake action despite the risks involved. Moreover,

i
there are still agents distributed through most of the six provinces

and communications can still be had either directly or indirectly with
these individuals, At the very least these agents can and will continue '
to collect information and to transmit it to the Ayency. ‘In addition,
certain of these individuals, plus some additional ones who might be

infiltrated, could’attempt to carry out’some sabotage. Individual
i :

acts of sabotage are possible with relatively few men and small

amounts of material, Successive acts 9f sabotage or extensive



sabotage operations are more difficult and inevitably more costly in
terms of loss of men, Nevertheless, it would be possible, starting
in the near future, to attempt limited savjotage with a view to determining
H
its feasibility and with the hope that gradually an increased program
might be developed. H
i

A capability also exists for types of. maritime operations including :

infiltration and exfiltration of individuals, landing and caching of arms,
under-water sabotage of shipping and small raider operations, Under
present circumstances it would seem wrong to atteinpt these except on
a very limited scale and,in all likelihood} raider operations should not
be attempted until more information regarding feasibility has been
obtained,
The Agency also has a small air armjincluding some transport
aircraft (C-54 and C-46 types) plus attack bomber aircraft (B-26).
Although it is not absolutely certain, there is reason to suppose that
Cuban crews also are available for operational flights, At the moment,
air operations should be substantially eliminated with the possible
exception of supply flights to support aera elements unable’ to
survive without such support, Even with |respect to such operations,
however, it should be remembered that the percentage of successful

night oreee is extremely limited so that i urgency should be great

to justify the risk, B-26 strikes could, Je course, be flown against

chosen targets (e.g. refineries, power plants, tire plants) and, if



i i
successful, might have the effect of extensive sabotaye, In. view i
: ae
i
: + {
of the risks involved, however, and the poor deniability of U.S,

support where aircraft are involved, |it is recommended that such |

operations be avoided at least for the present,

Manolo Ray of the MRP has asserted an independent MAP
capability to conduct infiltration, intelligence collection, sabotage
and defection operations into Cuba, He recognizes a need for U.S.

support but is very firm in his. desire to operate as independently

as possible of any official U.S. connection, His initial request

is for five boats, some materiel and|some money, He admits,

however, that, looking ahead, additional support such as real :
estate, some help with training and communications will be required,
He offers to share his information hak pa the U.S. Goverment, seek

U.S, advice and, at least fora period of time, be willing to operate

with the Revolutionary Council, The| Council's views are being

canvassed and Ray has been asked to| prepare a prospectus giving

jn some detail his needs for U.S. support for the immediate future +

and the step-up required over a perigd of time should his efforts

prove successful, i

The Ray proposal should certainly be examined and given support
i

| ‘4 ‘
within reasonable limits if the relationships proposed both with the
{

i
Council and with the U.S, are satisfactory,

Cate
HW 50955


In addition to the activities described above, propayanda

activities such as radio broadcasts and publication of magazines

and newspapers can be continucd independently by the Agency or H
in support of Ray or the Revolutionary Council, Moreover, limited
political action operations are possible. As to both propaganda

and political action, however, the amount of effort and the type

of activity undertaken will depend to a large extent on the decisions

with respect to the operations descrived above, Consequently,

these will be noted here as mere possibilities, ~ 1

EET MEMORANDUM OF CONVERSATION aT

Dick Bis dou
Tracy Barnes

Mr. Bissell agreed that no major dect sions concerning covert activities :
.,, 4a Guba should be made before the President returns from his European wed
~ “trip. However there are a few things He thought should be done immediately:

1. That he revise the internal CLA organization in preparation for possible
covert activities. This means changes bothehere and in Miami.
- |

Z. That a small group (30 to 40) Cuban'pilots be continued os pilots under
commercial cover in Central Americal and perhaps one or two American
companies. No commitment should be|made to them that they would be
used in future activities. They would be trained as individuals and not .
“ge any group or "movement." This is primarily to keep their skills |

alive and to keep them available. i
3. He wishes to clean up the Nicaraguan situation, We have left a lot of
Military hardware there as a residue of the Cuban operation. He would
like to pull this equipment out of there, turning some of the B 26's over
‘to Somoza and allowing some of the Cuban pilota to remain there to train.
Nicaraguans in flying these planes. This would be at Somoza's request
and would only be done if he insisted upon it as a re-payment-for services
> rendered, I stressed that no — should be involved in the train-

ing of Nicaraguan pilots. . 4 ere

2

4. He would like to train a few Cubans'las radio operators. They would be Ste
trained as individuals and would not know each other or that any others
were being trained. This amounts to training some individual agents for
possible future use, No commitments would be made to any of the men
trained. It is felt that this much activity is necessary in the next few weeks. ae
5. In addition, the Agency would like uh survey the various potential insur-
recttonary groups which now exist. There are several of these groups,
- three or four of which claim to have an underground in Cuba. We should
: speak to them, We should tell them we could make absolutely no commit-
| ment_as to any future activities. However, he would like from them an ~
| assesment of what they thought they could do in the future and -- if they
were to be active -- what help they would require from the United States.

- 2.

‘ This would enable us to make a judgment as to whether we should en-

. gage in covert activity based partly upon this information -- informa-
tion which would tell us what help in specific terms would be required :
and what we could expect from these groups. This has already been
done in the case of Mirona Ray. The | groupe contacted would include
thetCouncil, the MRP, UNIDAD and MRR.

6. Inaddition, he was informed that Swan radio could not be used by the
USIA. They are unable to assimilate it into their system, I suggested
seco" that we might try to find a good Letin American group, @.g., The League
of Democratic Partics or the Institute of Political Education run by Jose
Figures, to use it, I said that for the Council to operate the station did
not seem to me to be desirable,

sso. J, I discussed the general situation in/Miami and the various newspaper
reports. I pointed out that the KIA agents now in Miami were known to
everyone, including the press, and were the same people who were

. identified with pre-invasion activities. Their presence I felt only in-
tensified tho rivalry among Cuban gro cups and served as a focal point of
discontent, I requested that this group be broken up and that to the ex-
tent agents wore necessary new people =~ people not identified with the
pre-invasion activities -- should be sent to Miami.

8. It was agreed that no future covert Jactivities should be conducted in

“ the Miami area and that the groups with whom we dealt should be scattered

in other cities throughout the SoutReastern part of the country, I said that

: working in Miami was like trying to seid on covert activities in the city
: room of a newspaper.

9. We also agreed that Dr. Miro could be informed that we were making
a survey of other Cuban groups but that he should be. told nothing more

specific than that, i
10, I also referred to the newspaper stories which reported that Batistiancs
were being used supported by U.S, CIA funds. They said this was not te
accurate. They said that this would be very carefully looked into and that ae
the most specific instructions would be given that absolutely no Batistianos
should be supported directly or indirectly by the U.S. government.

When CLA began, the State Lepertineas, stilt thinking too much in

forme ambassadors frankly prefozred Ret to know whet CLA wan upto

MEMORANDUM FOR MR. RICHARD GOODWIN

SUBJECT: Cuban Covert Plan

Analysis of this plan shows that it envisages (a) "an island-wide
resistance organization responsive to Agency direction"; "internal
assets under close Agency control and direction"; (b) 'support and
guidance to those anti-Castro groups who are revealed to have a
potential for clandestine operations"; and (c) "primary operations
bases" inthe US. In short, what is intended is a CLA underground
formed on criteria of operational convenience rather than a Cuban
underground formed on criteria of building political strength sufficient
to overthrow Castro.

Despite the pretense of political impartiality, the effect of these CIA
specifications is obviously to favor those groups most willing to accept
CIA identification and control, and to discriminate against those groups
most eager to control their own operations. l.e., the plan discrimi-
nates in favor of mercenaries, reactionaries, etc., and discriminates
against men of independence and principle. Thus these criteria elimi-
nate the Manuel Ray group; yet I ¢an find nowhere in the documents
any explicit exclusion of pro-Batista people.

Leaving aside the moral merits of this discrimination, the practical
effect is to invest our resources in the people least capable of generating
broad support within Cuba. The Agency fails to confront the key prob-
lem: i.e., that those most capable of rallying popular support against
the Castro regime are going to be more independent, more principled
and perhaps even more radical than the compliant and manageable
types which CIA would prefer for operational purposes,

My recommendation is that you stop this paper in its present form and
demand that it be recast to make political sense. The key is the

statement that our covert activity ''should be viewed only as the
covert contribution to any national program designed to. bring

about the eventual replacement of the Castro government," This

is correct; and there follows from it (a) that our covert activity
should encourage the spread of the political sentiments within Cuba
most likely to rally support for Castro's overthrow (which means, for
example, Ray rather than Batista), and (b) that our covert activity
should harmonize with our basic national policy of rescuing the Sealers
Revolution, as set forth in the White Paper.

It is a fallacy to suppose that clandestine activity can be carried out
in a political vacuum,

MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT

. The Cuban Task Force met at the White House on Thursday, August 31.
Present were Under Secretary Ball, Assistant Secrotary Woodward, two
_ members of the ARA Bureau, Dick Bissell, Tracy Barnes and myself, -

“The following decisions were made:

1, We would proceed immediately to discuss with other Carribean govern-
ments the possibility of organizing a Carribean Security Force, Thia could
be organized on the basis of informal understandings within the framework
of existing treaty arrangements, aa a series of new bilateral treaties, or a ~~
formal, multilateral treaty, It was thought that the basis of organization

vyee, WOULE depend on the Judgment of other Carribean countries aa to how they

*: could accomplish the objective of establishing the force without running
serious internal political riska, The United States, for ita part, would pre-
fer the formal multi-latoral arrangement. Such a Carribean Security Force
would have at least four major aspects:

(1) Advance committment to come to the aid of other signatories
. threatened by Castro revolutions and, perhaps the designation
of specific units for participation in necessary multi-lateral
actiona. ae

(2) The establishment of a pool of intelligence information con- ee
cerning subversive activities with provision for exchange of Nests
auch information, ‘ :

(3) The establishment of a Garribéan air and sea patrol to watch
for suspected infiltration of Castro arms or agents.

(8) A training program in combatting subversive tactics, police
organization and procedure, etc.

"It was conceded that the substantive aspects of this arrangement could, if :
necessary, be achieved informally. However, the decision to seck a more .
- formal arrangement was primarily arrived at on the basis of intermal political
considerations in the United States.

\\
HY S60925--"“Dockd: 3242350 5° Rage 52.



-2+,
2. It was decided that our public posture toward Cuba shouldibe as quiet as
possible -- trying to ignore Castro and his island,

" 1

» 3, Our covert activities would now be directed toward the destruction of
targets important to the economy, ¢.g., refineries, plants using U.S, equip-
ment, etc, This would be done within the general framework of covert opera-
tiong -- which is based on the principle that para-military activities ought to
be carried out through Cuban revolutionary groups which have a potential for
establishing an effective political opposition to Castro within Cuba, Within
that principle we will do all we can to identify and suggest targets whose des-
truction will have the maximum economic impact.

“4, We will intensify our surveillance of Cuban trade with other countries and,
especially U, S, subsidiaries in other countries; and then employ informal
‘mathods to attempt tmdlivert this trade -- depriving Cuba of markets and
sources of supply, I understand that we have already had a few successes in
’ this effort.

5. We will establish next week -- in the State Department -- a psychological
warfare group, This will be a full-time group of three or four people charged
with the responsibility of assembling all available information on the Sovietiza-
tion of Cuba, repression of human rights, failure of the Cuban economy, etc.
-- much of which has been hitherto classified -- putting this information into
_ readable, popularized form, and developing, methods of disseminating it through
“ Latin America. Such dissemination would’be primarily through USIA channels
‘but would include feeding it to Latin papers for "exclusive" stories,. helping to
“prepare scripts for Latin American broadcasts, perhaps a direct mailing list
_ of intellectuals and government officials to be handled by a front group, etc.
The basic idea is to get this stuff inte channels of Latin American communica-
tion, instead of treating it as official U. S, Propaganda. We have selected
someone to head this effort -- Jim O'Donnell of George Ball's office who was
a free-lance magazine writer (including work for the Saturday Evening Post)
for many years and who Ball highly recommends,

6. The CIA was asked to come up =- within ithe week -- with a'precise, covert
procedure for continuing the below-ground dialogue with the Cuban government,
The object of this dialogue ~~ to explore the possibility of a split within the
governmental hierarchy of Cuba and to encourage such a split -- was fully de-
tailed in my last memorandum to you, This is an effort to fink an operational

__ technique. :

MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT:

I believe that the concept of a "command operation" for Cuba, asdliscussed
with you by the Attorney General, is the only effective way to handle an all-
out attack on the Cuban problem, Since 1 understand you are favorably dis-
posed toward the idea I will not discuss why the present disorganized and
uncoordinated operation cannot do the job effectively.

The beauty of such an operation over the next few months is that we cannot
lose, If the best happens we will unseat Castro. If not, then at lease we will
emerge with @ stronger underground, better propaganda and a far clearer
idea of the dimensions of the problems which affect us.

The question then is who should head this operation. I know of no one current~-
ly in Cuban affaire at the State Department whe can do it. Nor is it a very
good idea to get the State Department involved in depth in such covert activi-
ties, Ido not think it should be centered in the CIA. Even if the CIA can find
someone of sufficient force and stature, one of the major. problems will be to
revamp CIA operations and mai e- and this will be very hard to do from
the inside,

I believe that the Attorney General would be the most effective commander of
such an operation, Either I er someone else should be assigned to him as
Deputy for this activity, since he obviously will not be able to devote full time
to it, The one danger here is that he might become too closely identified with
what might not be a successful operation, Indeed, chances of success are very
speculative, Timre are a few answers to this:

{1) Everyone knowledgeable in these affairs -- in and out of govern-
ment -- is aware that the United States ia already helping the underground.
The precise manner of aid may be unknown but the fact of ald is common
knowledge. We will be blamed for not winning Cuba back whether or not we
have a "command operation" and whether or not the Attorney General heads it.

(2) His role should be told to only a few people at the very top
with most of the contact work in carrying out his decisions being left to his
deputy. If that deputy is someone already closely identified with the conduct
of Cuban affairs then it would appear as if normal channels are being followed
except that decisive attention would be given to the decisions which came
through those channels, There are probably three or four people who could
fulfill this criterion, we

This still leaves a substantial danger of identifying the Attorney General as
the fellow in charge, This danger must’be weighed against the increased
effectiveness of an operation under hia command.

One of Bob Amory's prightest young men should be assigned to intelligence i

As for propaganda, I thought we might ask Tad Szulc to take a leave of absence

Murrow and Dick Bissell. : :

These people should have a headquarters. It should probably be at the Pentagon

perhaps for a breakfast or post-breakfast meeting.

This operation should not be discussed ‘at tomorrow's meeting. Jnitially only’
George Ball (and Rusk, of course), MacNamara, McCone and Bissell should
know of your participation. When they are named, the five section heads

will have to know ~~ tee the initial organizing work and contact work should

pe done through your Deputy and myself, If this subject is discussed tomorrow
then already too many people will know about it.

The first steps are (a) name the section chiefs (b) review with them all current

EXES ont
November 4, 1961

The following are some tentative recommendations meant te serve as &
basis of discussion: i
I would recommend that the Cuban operation be organized in
five compoucnts: :

Be Intelligence collection and evaluation

b. Underground and guerilla

c. Propaganda :

d, Economic warfare (other than covert activities
teithin Cuba)

@. Diglomatic relations |

Although these sections will make use of available agency capabilities the

_ operational authority for each of these aspects of the operation will be in
the hands of the section leader who is responsible to the chairmaa of the
group. All of these activities will be compartmentalized as much a3 posaible,
fe., only the chalrman will be kept completely informed on all aspects of
the operation. :

The operation should have ite physical headquarters in the Department of

\!. Defense, both for maximum security and to detach it es much ae possible

> from identification a3 a CLA activity.

The first steps gre:
1, Designation of eaction chiefs;
2 Acomplete survey by each section chief of current
operations in his field;
3. The eotablishment of controkt over operations by the
section chief; .
4. The expansion of operations where feasible,

Bob Amory should be asked to designate one of hia best men to centralize
the intelligence collection and evaluation.

The Defense Department should designate the section chicf for underground
and guerilla activities. 7

eee We should discuss expansion of propaganda operations with Ed Murrow .

“""" and appropriate CLA officers -- not relating it to stepped wp operations

4 in other fields. With these people we should select a single person te be
the propaganda chief, coordinating CLA and USIA operations. I have
suggested that Tad Smulc -- if he can be persuaded to take a leave of ab-
sence -- would be a useful person to advise on this aspect of the operation.

Both economic warfare and diplomatic relations should be handled by a”
designee of the State Department. It is important to keep the diplomatic
relations aspect of this operation under some sort of control so that we
con't involve ourselves in potentially embarrassing situations inthe OAS,
e.g. voting to send an investigating committee to Cuba when our operations
are at a height and Fidel has evidence to present of U.S, participation.

The Deputy ahould be from CLA.

The President should not talk to the press. It may be that same contacts
sith a few key newsmen should be made -= in the most general way. But if
the President approaches thera personally and the operation does not succeed
it is inevitable that he will become the focus of another Cuban failure. There
are two types of newsmen involved here, There is a rather large group which
will hear rumors and stories of various kind, There is nothing to be done
. + about theme There are a few newsmen whose contacts in the Cuban community
ape ao extensive that they might bo able to pat together a coherent story. If‘
any approaches are to be made it should be restricted to these; although they.
should never be told we are going to wage an all-out operation. In addition,
se rauch contact and operational work as possible should bo done outside the

Miami arca. : '
h

Our next step should be to desig te section chiefs, establish their authority
and have them make a complete survey of pessent operations. Thia would in-
clude a survey of current covertioperations and capacities here and in Miami
{and anywhere else they are going on), as the firat task of the Defense Depart~
ment desigace with CLA assistance. The physical headquarters should be
established. fs

Although the Attorney General should maintain a genera, operational super~
» vision, it is probably unwise for him to ke the formal chairman of the group

+. because the risk of identification 4a fairly high.

an outline of an alternate Course B for submission. The CIA paper
“Operational Plan (Reduced Effort)" will be used as the starting
basis.

Since this is to be a bare outline, to permit further policy
guidance to be developed, I believe the paper need contain only
a statement of objectives and a livt of irapicmenting activities. .
The List of activities will be under the headings of: Intelligence,
Political, Economic, Paycholosical, Paramilitary, and Military.

We will hold an Operational Representatives work session in
my office, at 1460 hours, Tuesday, 14 Aucuost, to complete the
outline paper for submiosion. Each of you is to bring 5 copies of
completed assigned work to this work session, to permit each of

INJERVIEW AND MEETING SUMMARY Page 1

INTERVIEW WITH RICHARD GOODWIN.

Date: May 27, 1975 Time: 10:00 a.m.
Place: Goodwin's residence, 1536 32nd St. ‘NW
Participants: Sel. Com. - David Aaron, Rick Inderfurth, Greg Treverton

Subject: Intelligence Activities in Latin America

Submitted by: Gregory F. Treverton

During the 1960 Presidential campaign, Goodwin did foreign
policy work for John Kennedy, specializing in Latin America. After the
election he moved into the aaa House to handle Latin America. During
that period he spoke with the President about a Latin American matter
on the average once a day. Goodwin left the White House in the fall of
1962, becoming Deputy Assistant |Secretary of State for Inter-American

Affairs under, first, Robert Woodward and then Edwin Martin. After

working for the Peace Corps, Goodwin was brought back to the White
House by President Johnson, in the spring of 1964, after the Panama
crisis. At that time, however, | he did not specialize on Latin America,
instead writing speeches for Johnson. He left the Administration late

in 1965.

1. Assassinations:

In general, Goodwin had not heard much specific talk of as~
sassination, although it would not have surprised him if it had gone
on. He mentioned one specific instance in which he had heard talk of
assassinating Castro. After the Bay of Pigs, a Cuba Task Force was
established, first chaired by Paul Nitze and then by Goodwin in his
capacity as White House Staff Officer. At a meeting of the Task Force,
held at the State Department, McNamara suggested "getting rid of Castro,

someone from the CIA, perhaps Bissell, then asked if McNamara meant

HW 50955 DocId:32423505 Page. 70 i G

i
FILE:
"Executive Action." McNamara responded that he did and stressed his
|
interest in the idea, However,' Goodwin did not bring the topic up later
i
in the meeting after McNamara left. To Goodwin, the idea was not reason
i 7
able even apart from moral objections, for the Bay of Pigs had shown tha

Cuba was politically stable; Castro would merely have been replaced

with Raul or with Che Guevara, ie worse than Castro. Somewhat later,

Goodwin sat in on an interview Tad Szulc had with Kennedy in which the

President pledged not to kill castro. Szulc reported that pledge in an

article in Esquire. When he finished his period as Chairman of the Cuba
t

Task Force, Goodwin wrote a memo recommending that the United States

let Castro alone; anything the United States did to him could only but-

tress his position in Latin America.

During his time at the State Department, Goodwin met every
week or so with E. C. King, Chief of the Western Hemisphere Division
of the CIA, and King never ie aeiona a plan to assassinate Castro. Nor
did Robert Kennedy ever mention such a plan to Goodwin when Goodwin
worked for Kennedy, in 1966 and, 1967.

Goodwin did believe, however, that the United States was in-
volved, at least indirectly, in the successful plot on Trujillo's life.
During the Eisenhower Administration, the United States had severed
diplomatic relations with Trujillo and attempted to isolate the Dominicar
Republic. There were frequent reports that Trujillo was about to be as-
sassinated, but the assassination never came off. In fact, the govern-
ment was surprised when it occurred. HenryDearborn, the American Consul
in Santo Domingo, had been charged with staying in contact with anti-
Trujillo forces. Prior to the eereeerrer tt he had transferred some

weapons, presumably handguns, to those forces. Goodwin suspected that

HW 50955 Docld:32423505 Page 71 | | s


:
INTERVEW AND MEETING SUMMARY Page _3 of 6

FILE:
the President probably did not iknow of the gun transfer, but he said
that the assassination and the U.S. role with respect to it would have
come as no surprise to ‘the Pea He, doubted that the CIA even
would have had to clear the transfer, although a general policy of that
sort might have been passed by ithe Special Group.

Goodwin reported no other mention of assassinations. In fact,
he said he once heard a CIA man say that assassination was a bad idea
because once started, it never fended. However, an agent in the field
might regard killings of one scrt or. another as within his mission in
supporting one political factidn over another. And of course someone
might have gotten carried away. It was clear from the Bay of Pigs that
the CIA sometimes acted without, or even against, instructions (e.g.
by bringing Batista followers into the Bay of Pigs invasion team). In

general, Latin American work seemed to attract the worst personnel in

all Washington agencies including the CIA.

2. CIA Activities in Brazil:

Goodwin knew little of CIA activities in Brazil. The United
States had strongly backed Quadros and never liked Goulart. In the
period before 1964, the U.S. gave political support to anti-Goulart
factions: followers of Kubitschek and even to the Furtado in the
Brazilian northeast. The U.S. had been involved in Brazilian elections
for many years and presumably spent a good deal in the 1963 congres-
sional elections.On the military side, Walters was brought from Rome
to keep a contact with the Brazilian military. How much further

Walters' activities might have extended Goodwin did not know.

INTERV{EW AND MEETING SUMMARY . Page _4 of 6

3. CIA Activities in Chile:

The Kennedy Administration decided that left wing democratic
forces “in Latin America were the only means of combatting communist
influence and promoting development in the region. That decision was

applied to Chile, and the U.S.| switched its support from the conserva-
tive Alessandri. Goodwin sat ta on meetings of the Special Group only
rarely, only if Latin America were the subject of the meeting. As he
remembered it, the proposals that came to the Special Group were genera
statements, policy papers, not. descriptions of recipients of support or
conduits. .In line with the policy, support was given to left democrati
political elements. The U.S. certainly provided assistance to the
Christian Democrats in the 1964 elections, but Goodwin did not know
how much. The figure of $20 million, mentioned by Stern, did not seem
inconceivable to Goodwin. He contested, ‘however, the assertion that
the Chilean election was the most intensely watched election in Washing:

ton since the 1948 Italian campaign. From his vantage point in the

White House it did not seem so.

4. Changes during the Johnson! Administration:

Johnson cared less about Latin America than had Kennedy--
Johnson was interested only in Mexico--and so knew less about covert
actions in the region. Thomas Mann was left to run Latin American
policy, although the President did become active in the two crises--
Panama and then the Dominican Republic. Goodwin saw a sharp change
in United States' policy under Mann. Mann supported the military and

conservative elements in Latin American societies, and American support

for left democratic reform ended. Goodwin professed himself puzzled
by Johnson's assertion that he had discovered a "murder incorporated"
in the Caribbean. The only specific instance Johnson ever cited was
Trujillo, yet Johnson had known about the Trujillo assassination from

the very beginning and so could hardly have "discovered" it after he

I
became President. |

5. Covert Operations and Counterinsurgency:

When asked about the ethos surrounding covert actions during
the Kennedy Administration, hada ehbaad responded that the major emphasis
was counterinsurgency, not covert action. There was certainly no
reluctance to use covert action, but no one believed that American
objectives could be secured through it. Counterinsurgency was some-
thing different. A good deal of money was spent training police throug!

AID, much more was spent through the Pentagon equipping Latin American

militaries, and there was as wéll some CIA activity. At that point,

the U.S. really believed that the communists could not get elected to
power and that the threat was subversion. Paramilitary operations
“were considered by the Special Group (counterinsurgency). Latin
American matters were considered there, and in some ways Latin
America was considered a kind of training ground for Southeast Asia.
Goodwin believed that in sum U.S. counterinsurgency efforts made little
difference to the course of events in Latin America. Cuba could not
in any case provide support to guerilla movements in South America
without substantial support from the Soviet Union, and the guerilla

movements that began had little indigenous support.

In response to a question about NSAM's, Goodwin noted that
these came out of the Bundy shop, which had little formal staff. Good-
win often wrote these document. They were both general and, on
occasion, specific, indicating groups to be supported and the like.

Kennedy wanted to know the details of American activities in Latin

America.

|

6. Goodwin Suggestions: H
|

Goodwin believed it ihpossible to control the activities of
intelligence organizations without becoming involved in their day-to-
day operations. What is required is an active Congressional committee,
on the model of the early Joint Atomic Energy Committee, with an active

staff. Once the President is permitted both to decide what is a major

operation, and thus needs to be communicated to Congress, and who to
|
tell, the game is over. Confidence in men will not do; institutional

checks are required.
With respect to people to be interviewed, Goodwin mentioned
ae
that the Station Chief in Mexico functioned as a kind of regional sub-
director. He also thought we might talk with the FBI person in Puerto
Rico, with Arthur Schlesinger, and with Tad Szulc. In response to a

: \
question, Goodwin indicated that Nixon had been interested in the Bay

of Pigs through Cushman. He thought that Douglas Dillon might know of

that.

of that trip and ‘several other contacts I maintain with
representatives of the Cuban government at the United Nations
and the Organization of Aer ican States, because of my personal
friendship with a number of people at the White House and

Mr. Goodwin, Me. ‘Donnegan ‘and others, in a conversation with
Mr. Goodwin it au suggested that I come and see the Attorney
General. I was invited to lunch with Mr. Kennedy at the Justice
Department. We discussed ‘in considerable length the situation
in Cuba following the Gayo eaane the pros and cons of some

different possible actions by the United States government in

that context.

At the end of this conversation, the Attorney General
asked me whether I would have objections to meeting with his

brother.the President. Ijsaid I would of course be pleased
i

to do so.

The following day I received a call from the White House
indicating that the President would like for me to come in at
11:00 o'clock in ‘the morning on that day in November, which I

\
did. And I was received by the President in the company of
Mr. Goodwin in the Oval Office for a conversation which lasted,
iff. memory serves, in excess of an hour and a half, in which the

President discussed a number of his views on Cuba in the wake

of the Bay of Pigs, asked me a number of questions concerning

completely.

And then he went on for a few minutes. to make the point
how strongly he felt and his brother felt that the United States
for moral reasons should never be in a situation of having
recourse to assassination in foreign policy. Again, the
precise quotes and the pederes paraphrase I placed in the artic]
and again I'm paraphrasing from memory now.

And the President added in this context that the’reason I
have raised it with you, or words to this affect, is because
I am under very, very strong or sSaor pressure from certain
people, whom he did not identify, to authorize an operation
resulting in the assassination of Premier Castro. And I think
we talked about this for a few more minutes, and I think I
repeated the points I made originally and the President said
he felt.very strongly that same way and the fact he was testing
me or trying to see what my response as a reporter or as a
citizen would be.

I might: add ‘that several days ago Mr. Goodwin and I had
the opportunity to discuss this and compare our respective
recollections of it, and Mr. Goodwin's recollection is exactly
the same as mine. We discussed this at some length, this
being last week, and the subject being relevant to the current

PROGRAM OF COVERT ACTION FOR (THE DOMINICAN REPUBLIC

A. On 29 December 1960 the Special Group approved a plan of covert

BACKGROUND

action to support the internal and exiled Dominican dissidents which
involved provision for increased propaganda directed against Trujillo,

and the financial support of selected exiled groups. Additionally this

authority included authorization for,CIA to make available to selected
exile groups communications and equipment support necessary for them to

develop a capability to undertake the infiltration of personnel and

|

|

equipment into the Dominican Republic. Since none of the exiled groups |

had an existing underground organization within the area, it was the |

Special Group's concept that this delivery capability could be eventually 7

used to support the plans and activities of the internal opposition with |
whom the Agency and the Consulate are currently in contact.

B. On 12 January 1961 the Special Group authorized CIA to make
available to Dominican dissidents a ‘Limttea supply of small arms and
other materials on the condition that the internal opposition develop
the capability to receive these naterials and that the materials be in-

troduced into the Dominican Republic by Dominicans themselves.

i A
CURRENT COVERT ACTION OPERATIONS j

A. In late January 1961, CIA advised selected internal opposition
leaders that we were prepared to make available to them limited supplies
of arms, communications, equipment , and sabotage materials which they

th
had repeatedly requested jprovided they developed a capability to receive

TAMLy



it via air drops’ or sea infiltration. ; To date the internal opposition has

not been able to. develop this capability, nor have they been able to -
nominate training candidates for code; radio operators or saboteurs.

This turn of events is primarily due to the comprehensive nature of
Trujillo's security services, the_ understandable. fear. that prevails
throughout the bi aaa of being caught or suspected of anti-Trujilo,_
eee wand the fact that the organized internal opposition apparently” i
consists. of only a few individuals with no real underground structure.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Mr. McGeorge Bundy
The White House

Following un on our discussion of the Dominican Republic at
yesterday's meeting of the Special Group, I am forwarding you a
draft telegram which we would like to send to Henry Dearborn, our
Consul General in Civdad Trujillo, supplement.iny the guidance he
will be receiving on the recently approved contingency plans.

The text of this draft telegram has been shown to the Agency and
agreed to by them. I am also forwarding copies of the exchange
with Dearborn leading up to the present draft telegram to him.

I lmow it will be. difficult for the President to find time
before he leaves to have a look at this but, in view of the situ-
ation in the Dominican Republic, I feel that he shovld approve it
personally so as to be sure that it is consistent with his views ©
as stated in the HSC Record of Actions for Hay 5.

FOR DEARBORN FROM DEPARTMENT

1. President has now approved contingency plans somewhat revised subse-

quent your departure and copy will be pouched to you soonest. Hope-this will
resolve uncertainties reflected your telegram of May 21 but your comments and
requests for any necessary clarification will be welcomed.

2. Department appreciates valuable’ work performed by Amb, Farland and your-
self and |in developing pro-US attitude among dissident elements, Would hope
this could be retained and strengthened but only if at a cost acceptable from
standpoint US national interest. If price tag for friendship of dissidents,
whose action capabilities and realistic prospects thus far remain unknown
quantity, places too great strain upon moral position and principles for which
US stands or involves risks which in our considered judgment should not be accepted,
feel sure you will agree we should stand firm,

3. While fully cognizant unique circumstances within Dominican Republic
which precluded normal operation, Department is nonetheless deeply concerned
by degree to which covert activities this case have been forced to deviate from
normal cover and cut-out safeguards with result USG too openly identified with
what should be clandestine activities.

4, Running through entire dilemma has been conflict between two objectives:

(1) To be so. associated with removal Trujillo regime as to derive
credit among DR dissidents and liberal clements throughout Latin America;
(2) To disassociate US from any obvious intervention in Dominican

Republic and even more so from any political assassination which might occur,

In Department's considered opinion, former objective cannot, repeat not, easily
override latter. For this reason you should not, repeat not, inform trusted ops i
position leaders at this time of draft document which you now hold nor deliver
copy to them. If you believe conditions specified in second and third paras

Department's telegram of May 17 fulfilled, you may advise trusted opposition

leaders that you assume any friendly group seeking to establish authority after

overthrow of Trujillo would promptly declare itself provisional government and

request armed assistance from OAS, US, Venezuela and perhaps other governments.
If reply affirmative, you may advise them orally lines you think such request
should take.

5. In May 19 meeting here with Yaguate and Cibao Department spokesman sought
disabuse them expectation USG acting either through Department or CIA could be
party to any political assassination, At same time assured them this government's

continuing sympathy for legitimate aspirations Dominican people achieve represen-

tative government offering civil rights and guarantees all citizens.
6. In response your comment re covert activities program you should be ie

aware Department's growing feeling any continuation thereof should be made con-

tingent upon deepening of cover arrangements so as effectively to disassociate USG.

tive conversations with dissidents be withheld pending receipt documents now to
