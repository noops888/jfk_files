Mr. Alan LOGAN a .

Position (Jan 65): Second secretary, US embassy, Moscow, USSR

A too. serious type, wife never smiles. Very impressed with

i “nis position in the embassy’- a “heavy" person. Both drink a

good deal and oaly after they've had a few drinks do they let

‘their hair down.” His wife is French, SOURCE sees them at a
number of American and British parties. Frequently present at

frican parties, since he is embassy officer responsible for ~

_. African affairs. Wife is a bore, -

“PATE ACQUIRED: SEPTEMBER 1966 ;
aan Source and her husband think LOGAN is an intelligence

officer because the Soviets are very interested in him and
‘publicized hin as a spy for his interests in Africans in
“Moscow. After this article, the Africans stopped seeing

LOGAN,’ He was very well liked however.

General Comments:
Embassy officers all believe they are very |

important people by virtue of tho fact that the Department sent.

them to Moscow to represent tke States. They try to impress \
everybody with their position and with their knowledge of Soviet

' {
affairs (which is not too good in the first place). They tend

' to live a Betto-like existence, do not wiz with other menbers of

the dip set. Stay at homo or in the enbassy and do not get out
