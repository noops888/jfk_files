a Thursday - 6 July 1978

1. (Confidential - MMP) LIAISON Accompanied Scott
Breckinridge, Special Coordinator for the House Select
Committee on Assassinations, OLC, and Rodger Gabrielson,

OLC, to brief Thomas K. Latimer, Staff Director, House

Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, on the state of

play as between the House Select Committee on Assassinations

and the Agency. Mr. Latimer immediately understood that the

crux of the proBlem lay in the House Select Committee on

Assassinations possible exposure of sensitive information

(Nosenko and/or Mexico operations) in open fora. He said

that he would brief Chairman Edward P. Boland (D., Mass.),

House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, and that

the latter might discuss the matter with Chairman Louis

Stokes (D., Ohio), House Select Committee on Assassinations.

He suggested that the best approach would be for the DCI to

raise the issues we were concerned about with Chairman Stokes

and, then, if necessary with the President. The latter in

turn could register his concerns with Speaker of the House Thomas P.
- O'Neill. Mr. Latimer said that the House Permanent Select Committee

on Intelligence charter precluded the House Permanent Select

Committee on Intelligence from playing a significant role in

this matter.
