MICROFILM

1. JAGUAR has forwarded us the attached press cuttings

by or about Jonathan power, whose name has cropped up from

to timo in our NACHAOS reporting: Jonathan Richard Adrian

Power was born 4 June 1941 in the UK and carries a British

passport No. D43031#,

renewed 21 July 1969.

He is a journalist

who has written for a

number of publications and has been

associated with television, but claims employment with the

Economist.

JAGUAR's only other comment was that

the Hazlemere Group (subject of previous reporting)

stated in June 1969 that Power spoke of Cuba in a way which

suggested that he had visited there.

2. The attached documents and the above information have

,also been passed to the local INFRGO representative.
