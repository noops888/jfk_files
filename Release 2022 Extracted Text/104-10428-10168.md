SUCHE

April 1977

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Possible Identity of the "Unidentified

Man"

Photographed in Mexico City in October 1963

REFERENCES: A. Photos Taken in Mexico City by Mexico City

Station

B. Paperback Book "Appointment in Dallas"

C. Soît File, Headquarters Information on

Yuriy Ivanovich MOSKALIV, Possible

"Unidentified Man"

1. Photographs of the unidentified nan were taken by

our Mexico City Station on 2,3,4, and 15 October 1963, going

into or coming out of both the Cuban and Soviet Embassies in

Mexico City. Copies were provided to the FBI in Dallas.

Texas on 22 November 1963: Although cropped copies have

appeared in various works, including Volume XX, page 691. of

the Warren Commission Report, and the book "Appointment in

Dallas", to our knowledge the individual has never beeni

identified.

2.

On 17. March 1977, a former member

0f the Cuban General

Directorate of

Intelligence (DGI) recognized photographs of

the unidentifie man

as Yuri LNU, a KGB officer. whom he met

in Moscow in 1964 while

attending

an intelligence course

there.

He said that Yuri, a fluent English

and Spanish

speaker, was acting as a trouble shooter for the Cuban grouD.

the Cuban and Bulgarian groups quartered in the same building

in Moscow. Any time the Cubans had a problem, Yuri would solve

it for them. Yuri was a good friend of Juan (pseudo) a KGB

officer who taught the Cubans about the Agency (CIA) and the

West German intelligence apparatus.

Juan told the DGI member

that he had served in Mexico for about 20 years and in the U.S.

clandestinely for about 10 years (specific dates unknown). Yuri

was

entrusted with their welfare only, and did not attend classes

with the Cuban group.

3. SE/X travel records were reviewed in search of an

individual by the name of Yuri who possibly fit

the description

of the unidentified man. This lead to an

individual by the

name of-Yuriy Ivanoyich MOSKALEV, a Soviet, reportedly a Doctor

of Medical Sciences, who has participated in international

scientific conferences for the USSR since 1962 or earlier.

Although there is no official 201 file on MOSKALEV, there is a

sizable dossier on him in the Central Reference Service. Many

of the documents in his dossier are 00 reports from U.S.

scientists concerning MOSKALEV's attendance and behavior at

scientific meetings. It is obvious that he has a

much

greater

knowledge of the English language than he admits. His capability

is said to improve greatly after a few drinks; however, it is

noted that he rarely, if ever, drank at the scientific meetings.

It is also noted that on

qualified to represent the Soviets

occasions he reportedly was not

at

particular conference.

His papers

rarely, if ever, were specific, or presented

new

data.

Following are items of interest from

selected documents in

MOSKALEV'S CRS dossier:

a. In 1961 PENKOVSKY identified a photo (with no

name provided) as that of Col. Yuriy Ivanovich MOSKALEVSKIY,.

Air Force Col,and GRU officer in the Information Directorate

of the GRU.

b. In December 1963 the FBI reported

C.

In October 1963 MOSKALEV was a delegate to

the

IAEA Symposium on Neutron Irradiation, Brookhaven, Long Island,

New York. :

Described by U.S. scientists as very sharp, MOSKALEV

was a frequent commentator on other people's work and made

a practice of denigrating their reports with respect to

radiation lethality.

d. In October 1967 MOSKALEV participated in the Second

International Symposium on Delayed Effects of Bone Seeking Radio

Nuclides, Sun Valley, Idaho, arriving two days early.

his knowledge of the English language to get along

on his own.

Although he complained about not I-nowing

much English, he

admitted writing the English version of

the paper he presented.

MOSKALEV attempted to make propaganda of a paper by a West.

German scientist. A respected U.S. scientist said he fran'-ly

did not believe MOSKALEV's findings. MOSKALEV took copious

notes on all papers, which indicated he understood what was

going on. He also took many pictures with a 35 mm camera.

From questions MOSKALEV asked, it was obvious that he "new

English quite well. Although considerable time was spent

arranging for MOSKALEV to visit a U.S. laboratory en route to

his home, he

4. On 23 March 1977. several identification experts of

the Disguise and Identification Section of OTS/GAD. compared

photos of the unidentified man with photos of May Yuriy

Ivanovich MOSKALEV from the FBI, British Liaison, and CRS.

It was their opinion that MOSKALEV could very likely be

identifiable with the unidentified man.
