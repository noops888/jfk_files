1. On 1 June 1960 ¥r. John G. Hayn and Mr. John Kennedy of WH,
Robert Brow of OI/oPs, 'r, Robert Bryant of FI/OPS and Mr.

Lo FI/ not with Pavid K. WISTS? (pa).

2. “ILSTED emphasized that the whole telephone systen in Yexico
City 1s undergoing a reformation. The company Telefonos de “exico, Sq.
has sub-contracted this vork of cleaning up and reorganising tho phono
systan to the independent fira, Intel. They are cleaning w unused and
ol linea; putting in new and spare Lines, redefining exchango areas,
laying underground cables, eto, Frentually ve should be better off bor
cause there, should te more surplus limes. The renovation vork his
henpered much of the LIF:AT vork, principally becauso mary af tha Linos
now are underground and we cammot get access to them before they enter
the central, This is particularly truo with respect to the Ceach Sme
bagay, to whose telephone linss we osnnot obtain access fran the vantage
point we now occupy.

3.  WILSTED eaid that we try to keop track of the activities of
"Intel" but since thoy seen to attack "Colonias™ at randoa, we havo no
prior warning of their presence in a certain urea. i

Ls In the recent past, Naxico has beer using houses for listing
posts for security reasons. We have moro control over tha eceess of
Phone company inspectors or repairman to houses. ilovaver,' under new
regulations, all new apartent buildings must have.telonione Lines ine
stalled in the building by the phone company during the constriction
phaso. This moans that the Lines and their destination are concealed.
WILSTED proposed that this will mean ve can agein use sperteenta since
we can siphon off a lino destined for use Ly another tenant in such a
way that the phone company cannot trace its destination without tearing
tho building aport and we can then insta?l a sanarato lina to the build=
ing and hook up the subseriver to this line which, 1f checked, will
bolong to a legitimie subscriber, :

5. One systom which has beon used offectively 1s to take one-half
of tyo separate pairs which have one faulty Line each, These wo hilf
pairs then form one good pair wiich wa can use.

64 \ILSTED explained that it cost about 3000 pesos to gob a.

reguler telephone. This entails the purchase of 2 telestane company
band, which later can be sold.


7. -Personnal ‘involved in the tapping of tha ‘Lines arer

= who has access to the contrals. He contacts the fol-
\__| lowing ment Srsasnsnsasaeegii

= does exchange connections.

8. The tako from oach baschousa is collected early in the corning
before office_hours by RAFAKSLLI. Ho only enters one basshouss which is
occupied by an elderly couple. ALL other contasta aro in autenobiles
mada at different spota each. day of the week. RAFAKSLLI thea takes the
n hin, WILSTSD ond SSCHSR where PaPANSLLE

matoriol to a neating betwee!
turns the material over to SECHEN and they all discuss the prebless and
