MFMORANDUM FORs Deputy Director of Céntral Intelligence

“ounsnere Crusade for Freedom and National Information Mureaw

1. On January 10th I called your attention to the fact that
the National Infomation Pureau, a reputable investigation agency
which conduets ingyiries into ciaritalle orgenl zations and advises
large donors, had given an adverse recomiordation on the Crusade
‘for Freedom {see Attachnoat 1). Tals cattor has now risen agains
It aay be that 1t would be ulse to undertake a iigh-level approach
to the Bureau throug yourself or General Saith, for the following
Teauons

According to an acreenent with us and with the State
Department at our recent matings, Crusade for Freedom will bank
heavily this year on donations fro: corporations. They rave now
discovered that these corporations rcly to a great extent on the
Wational Information Durcau's atvice. Sevoral corporations have
indicated thei, according to their practice, they cannot give to
the Crusade unless it nas tho Messing of the Bureau, and you will
note in Attachment 2 that one ouca corporation -- Barnes Nanufactur-
ing Company of Mansfield, hin — has written to the Crusade citing

its doubt.

2. Meantime, members of the Crusade Save nad conversations
with D. vaul Heed, Executive Director of tne Yational Information
Pureau (see Attachment 3) and he ‘ac insisted that ae caniot report
that the Crusade nas cot the baste standards in pailanthropy until
his Standards 7 and # are met. Tuesa are the pui.lication of an
annual audit and of a dctatied annual budget, the prime requirenent
being the disclosure of totals.

3. You may want to read this Attachment 3 with care tut I
cannot mysolf cee any manner in waici we can meet these standards.
Tierefore, [ believe that it nay be nocossary to make the ap=roach
to the National Information Kirem descrited above.

HORVAT, Pave

5 Pavle Horvat is of Slovenian oririn, atout 50 years old and was
born in the Prlekija district near the Hungarian border (formerly a
part of. the Austro-Hungarian monarchy).

Horvat decane known durins: the thirties throush his nunérous
manifestos and posters by which he attempted to organize his own
political movement, This "moverent" was labeled various nares at
different tines, At one tine it was sixply referred to as a "peasant
movenent," at another time as the "Slovenia Section of the Croatian
Peasant Party," and still later as an “inderendent Slovenian peasant
niovenent." Ke never had, hovever, any following and never set up his
ow electoral lists, On the other hand, it 4s true, that the Croat
Peasant Party of Dr. “acek considercd him as one of its trustees in

Slovenia for a short period.

He earned his living as a farmer, He also had a srall village
erocery shop and occuried himself in his district with "interventions,"
that is, performing ail types of secretarial services for the peasants
of the area, A.ong other things, he undertook to organize the
transportation of the seasonal workers who vent to Frence and
Gernary during the harvesting months, He had difficulties with the
hone authorities and police in this respect and had to ap-ear before
the courts on a number of occasions. .

At the beginning of the wor he fled to Zagreb, Croatia, at that
time the Independent Croat State (Nazi purpet recime) of Dr. Pavelic.
There he set up a small office for the relief of Slovenian refugees
but it never reached any large rrovortions, He was not connected
with the Refugee Committee xhich handled the main relief work (Cne
source tointed out that the rere fact that he xas able to establish
an office ahd function 4:. Zagreb during the period meant that he was
at least passive!y acceptable to the Nazi regime.

As far back as 1935 he is !mown to h:ve misrepresented himself
as a "peasant leader."

After the war Pavle Horvat fled to Austria where he avain claimed
to be a Slevenian peasant leader and atterpted to whip up propaganda
for the creation of a srecial "peasant group," axong the Slovenian
refuzcess he failed comlete?y. He vas uncble to find follovers in
a single cacp to forn such a group, and the refugees refused to attend
his meetings, In addition he is known to have boasted that he was
acting on behalf of Hr. hacek and the International Peasant Union,
thoush he was mancated by neither. The Allied authorities vere
finally forced to intervene and brin; a stop to his activities since
they were causing discontent anong the refusces and disorders in the

DP camps.



. In July i9h9, Horvat wrote the Honorable Josech C, Grew in care. |
of the National Committee for a Free Europe introducing himself ag 1
the Representative of ‘the Nexocratic Slovenes and President of the
Interrational Peasant Union for Eurore, and suz-esting that he join
forces vith the Comuittee in the common struq-le against Communism.

‘In return for a trip to the United States he offered to bring a
large confidential report on his activities to date and present a
scheme for successfully sunpressing corrunism and delivering the
subsugated nations in the shortest possible time. He was informed
ia that the Fund was confininz its activities to refugee leaders already
residing in the United States and that the prorosed visit was
: _ Ampozsible at that time,

Horvat has recently announced his forthcoming arrival in the
: United States, Several Slovenian and Croatian nevspapers in this
country have received articles (which he wrote himself) glorifying
bis past and present activities, None of then, so far, have taken any
notice of these articles with the excertion of the Croat separatist
(pro-ustashi) paper, "DA!'JCh," publiched in Chicero. Supposedly
Dr. sacek was highly amused on reading the article describing the
great "Slovene peasant leader.”

Nobody in Slovenia in pre-war days would have considered Favel
Horvat as a person to be taken seriously in public Life, He is
considered by a number of sources a political impostor and as
personally unethical, Neither the Internctional Peasant Union for
Europe, of which he claimed to te president, nor the Denocratic
Slovenes, of which he is a repres.ntative, is considered a levitinate
organization. The Director of the Fund's Yugoslavian Research and
Informaticn Desk was the editor of a daily paper in Slovenian for
eleven years before the var. He never net liorvath, seldom heard of
nim and his peper, as far as he knew, never tork notice of him or his

activities.

Committee for xussian Liberation

1. I called Bob Joyce in tho State Department yesterday
and asked him whether in nis view the State Department would
object..to placing the new Caazittee for Russian Liberation under

the Crusade for freedom.

I wentioned particularly a possible

caveat of the State Department -- that wo might be expanding the
Crusade at the very time we nad agrecd at a sories of meetings
held recently that wo would cut down its activities.

2. Joyce said that the
method and scope of Crusade

crecnent With State was as to
uLlicity and activity and that the

addition of the new Comittee under Crusade cover would not by

any mears‘abrogate this agrecnent.

said that we could go

ahead and count upon the State Department's ayproval. I asked"
him whether he would like a meaorandun to this effect or whether
fhe would Like to consult others in the State Department and he
sald no, that this was unnecessary, that we snould go ahead.

MENORANDUM FOR ASSISTANT PIRECTCR FOR POLICY COORTINATION
- “SUBJECT: NCEE

1. For quite sone time the stafi ofticers of this divigion concerned
with utilising the facilities of the NC! and with-oxploiting the
Albanian, Bulgarian, and Rumanian enigrations have been evare of a lack
of adequate coordination between our own activities and those of the
NCFE starf, 1n conjunction with those rf Civirsion officers responsible
for handling our relations with that organisation, ve have attenpted
to axplore the problem in arder to find a solution which could be
considered realistic and practical.

2. The difficulty.lles not only 1n the communication system between
OFC and NCE, which doos not alwaye transmit, at exactly the richt time,
the right ideas from one organisation to the proper individuals at the
right lovel nthe other, ‘lthonch ve hava maintained very. close contact
both informally and through formal channels, only too often we have not :
been in a position to learn why NCE staff officers have made a givon decia- i
fon in regard to some emigre organisation in which we had an interest; and
on the other hand, our desires and needs have not always been fully under=
stood or accepted in New York. Again, it has happened that we were
ignorant of developments that closely affected ovr operations until it
vas too late for us to maxe o.r influence felt, and, correspondingly,
+ it must be admitted that ve have ourselver pushed ahead with courses of
action without adequately briesing the NCF:, Tne most extreme cage in
point known to ue concerns tae Rumanian exigration, where we and NCFE
are now pursuing conflicting policies. Ihe upshot of this has deen the
gradual development of a situation wherein Or ie supporting an organise-
tion, the NCrc, which is’not fully responsive to it.

3}, This situation is not regarded by us as reflecting any fundamental
Anadaquacy in NCFé, or as ;resenting any insolueble difficulty. hore
exists a problem in staff interrelationship which can and should be
resolved by & reform in our organigational ap,roach, The goal toward which
we believe we should work is one where OrC communication with KCHE would .
be channolled directly along a single high-level line which wo:ld firmly ‘
tie in AdrC's office with thit of the head of the other organisation.
Tieas, suggestions, information, etc. sould flow, in the regular channels,
up from the O?C working level to A77C's office for review anz transaiasion
to the top office of NC*d, and flow down fron there through ¥-Fi's usual
channele to the proper individuals in itsoperational machinery, ‘ersonal
contacts betwen individuals at a lover level in the two organisations
would frequently occur to supplement thie agual crannel, when security >
permitted, but ehould be in the hands of responsible personnel who
understand the OPC policies involved.

Discussion

Dbfex y National gouncils Divist

The National Councils Division of the National Comittee for a
Free Europe vas croated on 3 April 1950 by resolution sf the board of
Directors, Tho underlying principle, as stated in the Declaration of
Policy in Juno 1950, vas to ald the “non-Fascist and non—Cormunist
leadors in thoir peaceful offorts to prepare the vay towerd the
restoration in Eastern Europo of the social, politicel and religious
Ubertivs in which they and we believe." Tho councile were to function
as "representative, harmonious and effcetiva groups" and, es such, to
play a part in the strupgle against Conmnisx in kastern Luroze, Thoy
were not to be considered as goverments in extle nor as exis in them
selves.

National Conmittees and Panels,* as suppor
fulfill a two-fold function: as 1) avert instruments, they were to
a) serve as a symbol of unity both in country and ebrosd, b) provide
a reservoir of "nane" manpover for pF a use, ¢) supcly general
Propacanda policy advice, and d) su; with both cenerai and
specific intelipence vith respect to hocelard activities and personal-
ities. ds 2) covert instruncnts, they vere to servo as a cover for
cractiae undertaxen by CIA aizai at contatting Soviet oppression in

the satelite states,

IV Foegible Courses of Action

Corfronte1 with the situation skotched above, it would acer that
Ancofar ag CIA 1s concernei, the following alternative cources of action
are poesibles 1) Keep rhe nt eet-up; 2) withdraw support from
eni:re affatre; 3) ask the Xsurtzent of State to take overs or 4) make

certain changce along iincs recommended telow,

Since the present set-ug 4s uncatisfactory for the reacone indicated

THE “VOICE” AND RADIO FREE EUROPE
COMPLEMENT EACH OTHER

Both Are Indispensable \

“NW hat’s the difference between the Voice of America and Radio Feee Europe?” “Why
is it necessary to hive buth the Voice and Radio Free Europe?” "These are frequent questions
asked of General Clay and the other leaders of the Crusade for Freedom.

The Voice and Radio Free Europe ate both vitally needed if we are to win the
Cold War. i

‘They are completely separate organizations. Each performs a distinct function in the fight
against the gigantic Soviet Propaganda machine.

‘The Voice speaks with the authority of the U. S. Government. I is financed by Govern-
ment funds,

Radio Free Europe was set up by private citizens. Ic is financed by millions of individual
contributions to the Crusade for Freedom.

Voice is World Wide
The Voice is a worldwide network, broadcasting in 46 languages over 75 transmitters. {ft
is the only American voice heard in the Soviet Union. Its 120 indwidual daily programs of
news, music, roundtables, conimentacies, documentaries, service programs, etc, have a potential
audience of 300,000,000 listeners.

Radio Free Europe is much smaller. It concentrates on the captive countries behind the
Iron Curtain: Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Rumania, Bulgaria and Albania. Its transmie-
ters are in Western Europe.

The Voice speaks for the American people, spreading the truth about democracy, giving a
ttue picture of. life in the United States, and spiking Moscow's lies about us. It repcrts in full
on official American acts and documents, presents news and world developments from our
point of view.

But Voice is not limited to Government pronouncements; it regularly reflects American
opinion as expressed in our press and radio. Ina friendly way—with programs of informa-
tion and service—it promotes a better understanding of the United States in Europe, in Latin
America, the Far East and the Near East. :

Exiles Speak Over RFE

Radio Free’ Europe, on the other hand, does not portray America. It concenteares largely
on what is taking place within the slave.countries. Over its transmitters Poles speak to Poles,

Hungarians to Hungarians, etc. They speak'as “the voice of Free Poland,” “the voice of Free

Hungary.” etc. They look at theie people's problems through their own eyes.

“ RFE programs specialize in identifying and denouncing Communist informers and collab-
orators, sending back messages from escapees, and exposirig the corruption and crimes within
the Red regimes.

In theie broadcasts to behind the Iron Curtain, the Voice and-Radio Free Europe have es-
sentially the same aims: co keep alive the hope of liberation; to let listeners know that they
have not been forgotten; to stitfen their resistance against their Communist oppressors; to ex-
pose the fraudulent basis of authority upon which the Moscow-dominated regimes rest.

Both combat ‘Communism and the persecution of-religion and denial of human rights.
Both repore the superior industrial power and fighting potential of the free world over the
Sovierenslaved world,

1951 Year of Progress for “Voice”

Daring the past year the Voice of America:

1, Stepped up daily programming from 30 to 50 hours daily.

2. Made progress in overcoming Soviet jamming.

3. Increased its broadcasts to behind the Iron Curtain, adding the “splincet” languages of

Georgian, Armenian, Azerbaijani, Tatar, Turkestani, Larvian, Lithuanian and Estonian. -

Inaugurated programs to Albania, Finland, Israel and Portugal in their respective languages;

to China in two additional dialects, Swarow and Amoy; to Japan and South and Southeast

Asia in Hindi, Urdu, Thai, Burmese and Malayan.

3. Became more outspoken afd hard-hitting. One of the principal chemes was the support of
the UN effort to ‘repel the Chinese and North Korean Communist aggression in Korea,
Major attention was given to exposing the fraudulent Soviet “peace” drive.

6. Began wotk on the “Ring Plan” approved by Congress, which calls for a nerwork af power-

ful relay bases girdling the globe.

Created “Vagabond"—a ship equipped with a transmier, so that radio broadcasts may

be relayed from shipboard.

Received 318,000 Jerrers from overseas listeners—an increase of 334, over 1950.

Need'ed the Communists so successfully that Radio Moscow and Sovier regional szations

doubled their attacks againss the Voice.

8. According to the foregoing telotyse exchange, RFE ‘tunich were
not advised until after mid-day “ontay, 7 January 1952, of the contents
of OFC's cable of Priday, h January 1952, suepending tho action pending

RFE to proceed.

9. The undersigned would like to point out that none of the threo
outgoing cables (NUT W920, ONT 97623, <7 71033) quoted atove, wore
eoordinated with the Psycholorical ftacf Division who have the primary
Feuponsibility for all matters conceming CIT. and RYr. Had we know
about the decision to suspend on h Jarcary 1952, we would have been able
to advise PFE in Yew York in plenty of tine to call off the operation.
In this connection, a subsequent message from Kunich stetos that RFF
does not consider that their oversoas staff is subject to commands of
OPC stations, the command channel runing only from NCPE New York.

10. Dn/rts menorandua of 16 January 1957 on this subject refers to

The fact that I. Roge: would proceed in @

MENORANDUN OF OONVERSATION

Present were Messrs. Jackson and Washburn of HCPE, Keaers. Barrett,
doyos, Devine, Sargeant and Kohler fraa State, aad Messrs. Dulles,
Wisner, Llayd and Eraden from CIA. The neeting was held in

Kr. Barrett's office on 17 January at 130 pm.

ONCIUSION: That the Crusade for Freedom organization should continue.

The Mllowing ic a transcript of Kr. Bradan's notes of the
moeoting.

C. Ds led off, adnitting the frustrations that a long ompaign
on tho Crusade for Precdos caused to the State Deperteent and og-
gested the following progren:

1. A leday dell-ringing campaign in ail cities.
2. Direct mail to corporations.

At this point, Hr. wachturn interjected to aay that he wuld need
about two weeks of "low drums” promotion before te i-day

Jacksen went on to aay that ‘undor euch a scheme there would be no
time on tho part of the chaiman for a bulld-up of invidious eapari-
gona in the creer. At Jackson's request, Hr. sashvurn passed around
@ Crusade publication entitled "Tne Voloo of amarica - 1951 - A lear
of Frogreos". This brochuro, which in four pages praises highly tho
work of the Voice of Amoriea, is to be nailed ly tae Crusade to (te
chief contritutors.

Hr. Barrett then mada the following points:

1. Tho National Camittee for a Free Europe grew out of the
idea of helping refugoes and of giving them a voloe. It has changed
over the years to a huge operation witn many now ideas, end the
Crusade for Freedom caso along as a cover necessity.

2. He asked nother the donando of fund-raising had not begun
to make loss affective the primary Job of bolring refugees, whether

the tail <= Crusade for Froedom == ia not wagiing the dog. He
renarked that in a conversation witn Aian Valentine ho had found
that Valentino ie inclined to agree with hin,

3. Against Hr. Wachburn and the Crusade for Freedom, he had
only one complaint. Thay were too soot, too bigetina, They nade
wich an effective appeal taat the recipients couid not avoid running
dow the cometitor. Ho stated as tis opinion tiat tho Crussdo was
Joopardizing a muitiemillion dollar operation == the Volcs of Amorica =
and might even be jeopardizing anotier muiti-miliion dollar operation =
Radio Free Europe <- for tho, sako of raining three adllicn dollars.

L. Ile thought balloons and sone other operations done by the
Comittes were best done by private meany.

S. Wo leaned toward going back to thu becinning and looking
at the Crusade as purely a cover operatisn and mt an attempt to
raise large fundo and making a lot of hoopla. lie sugzeuted that the
Crusado should raise only enough money and make only enough of a
cmmpaign to provide a dignified cover. He sugxosted mail colicita-
tion, magazine advortivements, tho publicising of two or three largo
enonynous gifts, all without hign-prosoure. Then he said, “Let's
got on with the main Job of radio and refugees.”

Mr. Dulleo asked whether thie danger to the Yotco wan so great.
"Didn't you get more money tais year!" Barrett's answer as "Ho?
and he pointed out that there was no damage done to tie Voice by the
Crusede tais year insofar.as fimds wero concemed but he feared the
foture. Dulles asked waetlior we couldn't work out the timing of the
Crusade eo that thore wuld be no interforence on tho hill. Hr. Barrett
did not directly answer the question. ile said the cover was bad. Too
adout tho Crusade and he is worried
about tt. He said it surprised nin that it worried niu more than it
vorried Xr. Dulles. A large campaign raises tho question, he said.

the Votco, atrate;teally the Crusade ould be of enormus holp to
the Voleo ly publicising the necd for communtcating to people in
alavery. ee

Sargaant thoucht point 3 wao tho most important. ito asked whether
the Crunado couldn't do tled in with this point. Jackoon suid, "Yeo,
emi wo aro atarting wth this issue of the Crunaier publicising the
Volos." Wachtum added that 25 million contritatore, oounting this
year’s and last year'o contributions, say prevent cutiing down the
operation aa Farrett sugcesta, They will raise a lot of queations.
Barrott disagreed and repeated his sugcoution of a one-month operation
eonfined to magagino advertising and dirvot mail. Jackson ankod atout
the magazine odvertiaing. lie sald you had to write copy for magasine
atvertiaing and tho copy would have to advertise ladto Free Furope.
Rarrett anowored, "You can control the copy on magasine ads. There
is a lot of time allowed for going ovor thom carcfully before they get
into print.®

Wachtarn repeated coveral tines that it would te a reat shano to
lot the Crusade go. Jackson said the Crusade gave a real lift to
exiles not only hero but abroad.

Rohlor said he had been thinking about tho prohles and had tw
suggeations to make:

1. Could wo exhort people to give a collar to Rartlo free Furopo
and at the ome tins to write a lettor to thoir Ongressmen backing up
the Voloo of Asortoa? ’

8 Gould the Nadia Advisory Chmnittes of the Volce of Amorica
tees up tt the Crusade to help with general publicity?

Jackson enowered the first question "No". He thought that would be

dsngerous. To the socond question, he eald "Yen", Me egain outlined
tie idea for a campaicn ealling for education on a genersl payeholoci«
sal warfare progres with o final request to contribute to the Crusade.

Mr. Pallos again acked Mr. Barrett atout hia financial problens
and the tintng of his request to tho hill, Barrett said he would nave
the nowt difficulty fron January to July. hashturn eaid, "Then wo!ll
re a campaign in Septenber only and there’l! be no horn-blowing until
then.

Dalles sald that he thought trat if the Crusade could be limited
to ceptander he doubted that it would interfore wth “r. Barrett's
fnd-raising problems. [hat, coupled wita a better degree of coomtina-
Moa, with tho use of Kr. Loulor's private advisers, and wits a gro:
effort on the part of tho Crusato toward paycbolocical warfare education
would give the Yaloo mich invisible cuert. vargeant oaid he agreed

SECRCI


with Mr. Dullos’ view of the Crusade giving invisible eupport and
wondered whether wo could not seke the invinible aspects visible,
fe thought that to hold tho whole crusade organisation togethor for
a@ yoar merely to conduct a twoeweck carpaign would waste many good
men's tino, Barrott agreed that a two-week campaign wouldn't keep
the organisation alive.

Sargeant askod Lf there wore rot othor ideas wig could be fed
through the Crusade macuinery, thus aaking wore constructive ues of

it.

Varrett ratoed the question >f internationaltaing tho Crusade
effort. Jackson replied that ther was an abortive French project
wnich he thought would shortly fall Mat on ita face. Tie British,
he thought, would chortly make a final deciclon ac to whethor to go
ahoad wth an exile program or not. He socmod dubtous that thay
would decide to do om. Ha mentioned Joan Faul David and i‘eix at
Literto as the only foreign operation in this field which had any
eperk to it. Barrett agreed but aaked wether or not sane Furopeana
couldn't be put on tho Board of Directors. Dulles replied that thie
was vary difficult, Uiat thay couldn't attend neotings for one thing.
Parrott said, “Couldn't there be an annual meoting simply ao a front,
ao cmouflago?®

Jackson said that NCFE did got involved in European organisations,
that they had close affiliations wit: tne Furopean hove.ent, with the
Pree Trade Union Comittoo in bile, wth the Intornational Journalists,
wdta Strasbourg Univermdty, and all the radio prograss were reaching
the point where thoy wore thought of as prograas belonging to the people
t whom they wore broadcast, NCFi had, he tnought, internationalitced
@ great deal and in a very natural way. A board 2f foreign directors
would epoil that natural process by setting up an obvious puoney.

Washbum again raiced tha arnrunent of timing the oampaipn to take
place only in September. There waa no direct mzyonee te thig eugsee-
‘lon.

Sargeant, referring again ty the uso of the invicible assets
mentioned ty Dulles, tought that if te Crusade cantinued it sould
de planned not primarily to raise funds except os cover. Attention
should be focused ont

1. ne development of uaterstandings the battie for tre ninds of
men,

2. Two or three concrete tings wiica private cltisens could do
in thie battle,



Tarrett took this up at ence end acntioned lettor writing. Turning

to bashtum he said, "Abtott, rut your mind to work." ilo thought wa
snould be able to find sasstxing. He ougzeoted we ask Washburn to
look into other projocts tice Ue lottcrewriting caxpatim tat vao
done for Italy. Ho montionet te Comaon Council for Anorican Unity
and Mr. Dulles sugrested tis Priendsitp Loague run ly Miristian dorter,

Dulles asked for agresnart of the group to do tie campaign on a
modest bacto for the month >! ceptoaber only, to komp the orgerd zation
together, ta include the comxittee of tho Volea, to assure ful ovr
@ination of all publicity ast i work hard on we spocific ideas

eaid, "Ho, 1t would not ness scat; Radio Free furope would eiaply be
one of tho themes that was ycsyed, somatines at the top of tis ‘adder
and somstinos dow the ladder, {t wuld depend. *

Barrett again raced te cover problo: and his diseat! faction
with the Crusade as cover. ‘ulles emlained tnat this was a problen
that had to be lived with.

Jackeon onco more atten ted to get agrecnent of the group on
the following pointer

2. The Crusade to enatisve.

At a meeting of the Executive Cosmittee of the Board of N.C.F.Z
held on Jomury 3rd Lett, the nembery felt that tuo of the subjects

aa a formal recuect, 20 action woe teken by the Comittee, but the in-

Desr Allen:

At the Grusade Soard Noetiny; last Friday, C.. reported in detail on our
Beeting in Ed Sarrott's office.

This was followed by a general discussion of the nature aad scope of the
1952 Crusade progran, Briefly, there was agreement thet the progrem in
1952 should be considerably reduced in scope, thet the emphasis should be
taken off publicity and placed on fund-raising with the promotional period
‘eing reduced fron two nonths to two or three weeks. . It was felt that a

: direct mail canpaicn to our present list of civers -- plus a thorough
solicitation of corporstions -- would be desirable.

There vas discussion also of a one-night house-to-house canvass, nation-wide,

on Constitution Day next September. Hr, Poole sucgested that, in addition to
i Radio Free Burope, the 1952, Crusnée might place emphasis on the newly formed
1 Free Europe University in Exile at Strasbourg, Franc eral Clay :
Fecommended that the Adverticing Council's assistance in the new cxmpaign

1. Regarding the project mentioned in tho referenced eenorantun
to transfer aprrezinately 100 Polish exiles to Portugal for tho
purpose of condzsting folish prograas froa that country, Hr. Robert 3.
Lang, Director of facio Free Zurope, hae adviced us that on
3 danuary 1952, the card of Lircotad of the National Committes
for a Free Kurepe, Ins. Cecided that at least for the present,
48 would be sAvisable to do all volish programming in Kunich. Be
stated that on hr. C. b. Jackson's last trip to Portugal, the
authorities there advised hin that. ary Polish oxiles brought in
under the ateove-keutioned cireuastances would have to live under
conditions spprexinating "house arrest,* since the Portugese
goverment would not tolerate their circulating freely within the

country.

2. Later Fr, Spencer Phenix stated that he and Mr. Oregery
‘Thenas believed that eoue fev Poles could de brought in without
such drastic actio: by the Portusese authorities. Ho alse expressed
@oncern that the short wave commnications between Munich and Lisbon
were not 100% eaticfactory for tranomitting the Polish prograas,
which are then relayed out of Lisbon to Poland. Ile felt that
programsing in Portugal would be the bast way to handle the probles
but eduitted that apprexiaately 100 people vould be needed, sad,
under the eirow=stances, he egroed that it was better to keep tho
eatire program staff all in one place.

Thank you for reminding me that Fd McHale may soon
be available. As you aay, I know him, though lightly,
but I have alvays heard excellent things about hin.

T have made an attempt to find out who expressed
interest in him to Ton Myers but cannot do so. Perhaps,
thorefore, you would pass this note on to Tom and ask him
to let ne know sometime soon who expressed the interest.
That would help me ascertain whether we will went to try
to bring hin down here.

Ny very best wishes to you for the Hew Year.

The National Committee for a Freo Furope is an organization of
private American oltizens whose purpose 18 to encourage the spread
of freedom behind the Iron Curtain in Furope. It is a maabersaip
corporation, chartered undor the laws of the State of Now York.

In spreading the doctrine of freedon and combatting Sovict
totalitarianien, the Qmmitteo operates radio stations which plores
tho Iron Qurtainj in close cooperation with the French authorities
and the Univoraity gf Strasbourg, it operates an educational centre
at Strasbourg for young men and women who have escaped froa behind
the Iron Curtainy it attempts by othor meane than radio to carry
messages of hope and of the poscibility of eventual liberation to
the nations witch are now enslaved; it conducts studies of the lays,
customs and cultures of theso nations av they existed prior to
Soviot occupations and it docunonts the changes which have been
Amposed by the Soviet #0 that if the timo should come when the
people risé against their conquerors, they may more easily cstab-

sh contimity with their past.

In all of this work the Comiittes draws information and support
from many sources -= from those who have escaped and wno must renain
anonymous for fear of roprisals on their families at home, fron those
in this country who wish to work voluntarily for the cause of frecdon
abroad, from the American people at large, and from goverment agen-
cles which, in the American tradition, give all possiblo aid to
private chtisens engaged in a worthwhile public cmse.

Fund raising for the Committee is done by a subsidiary, the
Crusade for Freccom which, in the courso of raising money, also
helps to keep before the Amorican people and people throughout the
world the noed for spreading tho idea of freedom. For example, the
Freedom Bell, which now rings regularly over the city of Berlin, was
the gift of sixteen million Anericans who contributed to the Crusade
for Freedom. All in all, signatures and voluntary donations fron
more than twenty-five million Auericans have come to the Crusade for
Freedom to date. Generous contributio: ave alco been made to tha
Committee by private foundations; and at the request of Governaent
agencies, certain specific research and other projects have been
undertaken and carried on with the assistance of funds provided by

the departuents or agencies concerned.

A Board of Directors consicting of prominent American citisens
from all walks of life pass upon the policies anc supervise tho

SUBJECT Radio Free Europe

1, For your inforration the following report on Radio Freo Europe
Mungarion broadcasts was received here recently, although the informa"
tion was obtainod last Warcht

"a, Radio Free Europe broadcasts from MUNICH, Germany,
are more popular than the Voice of America prograns and its
news coverare is considered both current and based on authen-
tic sources, However, ita cormentaries on foreign politics
are sevorely criticised and allogedly the general opinion in
Hungary is that whoever writes this program has not the
slightest idea either of the conditions in Hungary or of the

general needs of the people.

"y, There ane also objections to the prosram of News
Briefs (ROVAT ADASOK). This propram is considered a nuisance
and isn't even listened to by those for whom it is intended.
By scheduling 15 and 30 minute proprams specifically veamed
to different segments of the population, such as: the women’s
program, the church prorram, the farmer's program, book and
movie reviews, etc., Radio Free Europe reduces its listening
audience to those wno mirht be interested in tre specific
progran, while the majority o: the listeners are forced either
to cease listening to their radios or chanre to another broad-
casting station, As a result, Radio Free Zurope has beon losing
its audience and the decline is especially noticeanle during
the propran of News Briefs whon the majority of the listeners
allegedly change over to the BAC program.

"ce. The worers are particularly interested in political
news and are in un excellent position to spread the news
throughout the factories, Arain the BAC appears to be the
nost popular station, Informant learned of the fate of one
Inre HORVATH, @ proup leader in a Textile Mill in SZZGiD,
HORVATH passed on sone news conzernin; the activities of the
"Political Police" of SZ2cED whieh ha had criginally heard
on ona of these foreirn broaicasts. This resulted in HOVATH
being imeediately transferred to DUNAPENTEMEand nis "group"
was disbanied.

Dre Allen ii
Hr, Norberg H
Mtr. Korns H

after arrenging au sppointmont through his cousin, Senator Moody,
Mtr. Seripps called on the Director to discusa his proposal for a
“friendship Balloon Lift." Certain materials rulating to this proposal
had previously been transmitted to the Director by rir, Allen Dulles,

In reply to questioning, tr. Scripps asserted that he was well
sequainted with the SCFé winds of Freedom campaign, in wich he had
participated, but that he had not discussed his present proposal with
NCS. said he had talked to many American business men, who ware
sll enthusiastic and were prepared to donate the variety of products
which be proposes should be included in the payloads, He said that his
father was an ardent supporter of the projoct, along with a Ar. Fletcher,
Vies President of the Caterpillar Tractor Company and Ur. Harnett.

Mr. Fletcher epent sone tine in Russia, he said, when asked whether
Caterpillar vas in the balloon business, itr, Scripps said noe

Uther nares mentioned by Ar. Scripps as being familiar vith nis
proposal included Nick Naradi, identified as sn exaninister of the
Hungarian Governzents Frank Jewitt of General ‘ills (which holds a
balloon research contract with the Uffice of Naval ‘tesearch), who has
givon hia a letter to an adairaly an Admiral <illers and a Hr. sank
of CIA. (see below) Hr. Scripps also mentioned a ‘Paychological squipe
ment Developnant Uffice I-c=ted in the old rost vffice building,

(s00 below)

Mr. Scripps vas troubled by security probleas. It was apmrent
that he felt he had obtained confidential information from certain govern-
ment sources which he could not disclose, At tne sane time, ho stated
that in order to work out his proposal in any detail, he would need
access to information presently denied him, Therefore, ne suggested
that he be cleared for security by tne appropriate agency,

4s a rosalt, it proved Lmposaible to nail dow the technical
aspects of Mr. Serizes' proposal. In bis formal presentation, he had
doscribed a balloon capable of carrying a h0-pound payloed and costing
$5. In his conversstion, he asntioned a vehicle capable of carrying
300 to 800 pounds, together with a stagrarcd release mechsnisne-withoot

price, To questions as to whothor either type was in oxistence, tr.
Seripps replied that he was bound by confidences, In gencral, however,
he did not foresee any technical barriers, i

: A

then asked how he would finance his proposal, Hr. Serippo said ~>!:
that bo would begin with private contributions, with the thought that 2%
eventuslly the program would be taken over by the govegnaant, te laid,
etress.on the need for carly organization (osce fund raiping, balloon:
stockpiling, crow training, selection of leunching elites) in orier that:
operations could ba started invediately following s decision as to th
devirubilitys He atated that 90 days would be sufficient to prepare
for operations, once he got the "green light".

Dr, Allen expressed his personal interast in the proposal, but
Feminded Hr, Scrippo that PSi's field vas sirategic rather than oporae
tional, and that in an operational proposal of such complerity, PCB
could only give the mattor a cursury review. Therefore, Lr, Allen stated oc
hie intention to forward the propusal to the Paycholoyical uperations
Coordir sting Conmittes, whica was the proper hoay to give the project
the detailed screening to which it was entitled, vr, Allen also aug
gested that Hr, Scripps see C. D, Jackson,

Mr. Norberg then eugeested that as an additional aid Me, Scripps
prepare a brief but fairly sperific deseription of what he personally
was prepared to do, along with an outline of tie organization which would
de necded to carry out the project. Hr. Seripps said that he vould do
20 within tho next wiek.

COMENT

doe Frank, when asked sbout Hr. Seripoa, said he had ast hin several
times between Decenber 1950 and February, 1951. Daring this period of
early planning for balloon operations, Franx aaid that Scripps proved
quite helpful by quieting curtain private unt‘usissts, in addition to
aaintaining a discreet silence hinwelf, Frank did not know for a fact
that Mr, Scripps participated in the August uporation, but Judged that
1t wos Likely. In Frank's ovinion, Scrivve is a capaole person with
valuable connections in the business world and sufficient financial
independence to be ale to devote mst of his ties to good works, Frank
thinka it vould te a good itos to have him cleared as a consultants

Formative Staj

Mt ite Laceztion, the National Comdttee for a Free kurope
belleved that its Iron Curtein broadcasting operation, itudio Free
Europe, could and sroita te dovelozed and purcund through the mediun
of “National Councils* or “Committees of Liberation" composed of
exile groupe froa the target countries, It was considered that
prominent exile leaders 4-1 personalities of each nationality group
could express to their eartive countrymen, entirely without Anerican
advice ond guidance, tie nessuge of hore unten NCP» proposed to send.
Thie concept was not fu:filled, Experience in attexpting to weld a
talented, dedicated group of exiles into a non-purtisas broadcsating
operation early deconstreted that without Auerican control the riesion
of RFE would be lost ic t:e Jungle of extle-world politics. It soon
becaze evident that the leacership anong the exiles wae neither auffie
etently strong nor personally willing to rise above tie politicul cross
currents, factional rivalries, and splinter-group weaknesses character

istically reminiscent of tte political affairs of all bastern turopean

countries,

Theoe factors nilitated against tne original plan of pernttting


exiles, through their loosely oryanized Councils or Committees, to
wholly develop, manage, and contre) RFE broadcasting. :

Since the advent of RFL was tne most important development
affecting the extles witch sad occurred since thelr fliht fro: howe,
they quiekly understood and applauded its implications and potential
effect on their futures, Tnrourh this instruxent they could once
again becone prominent and powerful in the affairs of the honelands
once sore they could contend for place and power.

Slection of personnel for the purpose at hand quickly becane
a political football of rival leaders, personalities, and groups.
Rishtists, Leftists, Centrists, Labor Elenents, and Splinter-groups
argued with us for advancenent of their particular personal or political
views. Sponsorship of their own adherents as RFE exployees through whoa
such views would be broadcast to their captive countrynen becane the
pattern of their pseudo cooperation, This pattern was followed to such
an extent that ordinary progress and sensible development of our basic
purpose of truly free broadcasts under exile control soon appeared to
be not only impracticable, but dangerous, For exacple, the National
Councils Divieion atteapted to inaugurate broadcasts to Czechoslovakia
ander the auspices of a Czechoslovak National Council. The Gouneil was
of differiny political views and

isd is =ade up of exile personaliti
parties. Its factions proceeded to enrage in endless disputes and im
reconcilatle clains for control of seript production and progran content.

sought that objective, waile Crechs desired opposite views to be aired
faces and advocated the rebirth of pre-war Creshoslovakia, Lach group sponsored
and insisted upon exployment of its own sore or less qualified adherents

upon the assucption that its special views would te thereby expreased

toSlovak audience of RFL, Similar activities were

to the captive cx
pursued by Hungarians, Fulgartans, and Poles until the futility of per=
mitting the exile Councils to control the destiny and broadcasting
policies of RFE was nade clear beyond refutation, it becane tragically
obvious that uncontrolled extle-world Councils and professional poli=
tictans could not agree on personzel selection or progran content.

In spite of every effort to induce harmony in and obtain proper
", and individuals, RPL was

cooperation fro: the "Councils", "Comaltt
confronted with an inpasse, The alternative tieory and present policy

of Arerican selection of non-political exile personnel was the only way
out. It has worked. Technically qualified personnel produce properly
oriented proprazs =~ and have beer, doing so with docurented success

since July, 1950, Disappointed exile politicians, professional exile
camp followers, disturbed American special pleaders, and alarred Commnist

Agents all screaz, snipe and snivel — but RFE programs are doing the Job,

NCFE-RFS records of this stare can be supplied by Frederic R.

Dolbeare, Vice-President, National Councils Division, and Robert E. Lang,

Director, RFL, The current policy has the complete endorsement of these

officers and of the Board of Directors of NCFE.

-3- “


B, Development Stage

Upon the collapse of the oriinal concept of broadcasting under
exile auspices, RFE necessarily utilized soue exile personnel endorsed
and recorsended by the leaders of the various nationality :roups. Aa
technical radio facilities cane into being, exiies with radio background
or writing talent were required for the production of prograne, This
involved using individuals euinently qualified ty experience to do a
radio Job of script writing, announcing, acting, ete. without regard
for the fact that such individuals wight be at odds with one or another
political faction or leader of an exile "Council", It also involved
elimination of proven inefficient, inept or unworthy individuals without
regard for their exile "Council" sponsorship. In either instance crit~

icisa of RFE was predictable and indeed waa always forthcoming == often
in virulent acd dishonest fora.
The day to dey operation of RFE developed new techniques and

Jong range plans wich made Lt {:possible to eploy non-entities of no

political eolor or conviction. The best people to produce programs in

harmony with NCFE<RFE purposes and policies necessarily wore persons
known in their own countries for their views on dorestic political af=

fairs and their anti-Commalst activities, Hard-nitting propaganda

required hard-hitting personalities whose known association with KFE
and its prograzs would add validity and sigatfieance for our captive - : :
audiences, Gradually, therefore, the nationality desks of RFL at New

York and Municn were staffed with testeu, qualified exiles wuo iad been


Adontified publicly with doseotic political philosophies at issue in
their own countries. Many, in fact most of the staff pecple ure cone
troversial fi¢ures axonp tiiotr own countrymen in exactly the sane way
that prominent Americans are controversial in our political arena, Many
{adeed aro mombers of the Councils, but are men of sufficient stature
to give their primary aliegiance to the non-partisan policy of RFE, The

decisive factor is that there be no controversy or question about their

anti-Commniat convictions’ and records,

At this point, it mot be noted that our target countrios have
been subject to repetitive political ferment prior to and following

World var IT, as well as the successive occupations of Nagi and Communtot

Arai

The temper of the tines, therefore, in which these exiles have
Lived for the past fifteen years nas been one of exeitexent, bitterness,
-Fecrimination, rivalries, and personal turaoil -- all eterning fro. both
doceatic and foreign etrug, les for power, The tines have prodysed a
bunper crop of refugee traitors, collaborators, und opvortunists and at
the same time have developed pure Western style democrags, trie national
patriots, and unselfish honest aen, The exile who stood by placidly
through the era to not such rood, however talented, ag a militant nessen-
ger of hope via RFE; exiles wno were honorally active in public affairs

at hoce and who had radio talent were, therefore, the only kind of

Personne] suitable for RFE purposes,

As the neceasity for Acerican operational control of rationality

desks tecaze self-evident, the only feasible personnel policy was to



employ properly qualified individunla, regardless of exile politics.

In the execution of tis policy individuals w o were useless were

eliminated without regard Jor politics] sponsors, Thies process atill

goes on, Sintlarly, talented exile personalities recruited fro. any

source were exployed wherever needed. This process otill foes on,

Both processes are in vomue with a healthy disregard for exile political

nd protests, Neither proccss io satisfactory to self. styled

nuances
exile leaders, since it follows that the appointment of an individual
sponsored by one faction aa a representative of its views inevitably
fro: the opposite faction, This .

will evoke howls of rage and critictis:

Recruitment -- Special security Hessyres

Since RFE, although a private enterprise, iu by extension 4

RFE POLICY. WCi POR Pi NEL,

General Comment

\
The proprano alred by KFE are not left to whim or chance, ALL

program and tho ‘personnel responsible for ther are controlled by a
written policy manual, The manual sets forth in ninute detail the
position and policy of iE on every topie beared t. our target countries,
The marual 1s the daily guidance of all employees, both American and
Exile; deviation from its rules to not persitted, Continuous serutiry
of manuscripts and rosultant broadcasts 1s naintalned by Anerican en

Ployees to insure that there are no deviations,

The policy manual of KFE represents the considered views of
the responsible officials, including the Board of Uirectors, of NCFE,
It 19 0 statement of the principles and purposes of KUFE expressed in
operational form. It is considered and maintained as strictly cone

fidential document, but 1t 1s of course available for examination by any

proper authority,

The policy manual 1s in strict conforuity with current American

national policies as evidenced by the following quotation fro.. Article

Ones

"ke a non-rovernsental radio station resporsible to
the millions of Anerican citizens who euppory it,
RFE cannot take a line contrary to Unitea States
Government policy or to tre beliefe of tne Auerican
people reflected in the Conatitutio:: of tie United
States and in American Institutions.".



The above quotation 1s understocd by exile personnel par- ,
ticularly to be a solemn inJunction ayainat ideoloyical prograa content
wnich in any way violates the letter and spirit of American policy and
ideals, It is a guarantee to the, American people and to our captive
listeners that RFE and the cen who sake itu prograna are unconprotisingly

opposed to the Communiet regises now in power in Sovist Russia and the

satellite countries,

RFE Policy Defined by_fland! (Direct Quotations)

1, The purpose of RF: is to contribute to the Iberation of
the Nations imprisoned behind the Iron Curtain by sustainin; their
morale and estimating in thea a spirit of non-cooperation with the
Soviet-dominated regines by which they are, for the tice being, ruled.

2, The central characteristic of RFE is that it ig the ine
strunnt f men who are engaped in fighting for freedom and justice.

As such, it encourages resistance to every tyrant, great and small, in
the countries it addresses, Itsmpeakers speak == ao men of good will
who seek to contribute to the elinination of old ennities and the
building of an enduring Eurepean decocratic order,

3. Asa free forum in w.ich exiles speak to tueir own poeple
RFE is particularly dedicated to argumente by wiich exiles seex to
persuade their listeners of all devourix, ambitions of Soviet
Isperialisn, the cruelty and unworkability of Conmnist institutions,

ene



and the proven advantages of the denwcratic way of life for the worker,
and the peasant, the adninistrator, and the business and professional

strata of society,
4, RFi. takes councel with exile leaders and is respectful

of their views, but ita policy is not designed to further the aspira~

tions of 8.y single exile leader or party.

5. RFE policy is further based upon acceptance of the prin-
ciple that each of the berated peoples shall be free to deternine
for itself the political and social institutions under which it will

live once it has been liberated, i
6. Finally, the followinr summary in the nature of 4 specific

limitation on program content is quoted:

"Tt 48 indispensable that all concerned grasp clearly
that RF is a multi-national station established to
contribute to the liberation of all the peoples it
addresses, and not cerely of one of those peoples.
RFE policy is therefore commanded by the limitation
that nothing may be said over its facilities to one
national audience wiich will destroy the confidencs
in RF’ of its other audiences or which is likely to
induce any of its audiences to prefer conmnist rule
to a liberation which wight apnear to promise donina-
tion by a neirhboring people,”

Dear Oliver: \

Wiicn I last saw you, I spoke of tho Goneral

Hennyey matter explainin:; the great importance that
the Fund placos on expediting the arrival of Gensral
Honnyoy in this country for Fund purposes. I later i
mentioned this mattor in detail to one of your liaison |

that it is considered imperative that all possitie as-
sistance be developed looking toward the sponsored ar-
rival of General Hennyey in the shortest possible time. i
i : I now refer you to our letter of March 2, 1952, which I

delivered in person to Mr. Abramuon. That letter con-

We have just been informed that the unconscionable
delay in the processing and approval of General Hennyey's
entry presently will be made tho subject of pubite pro-

: test by elements of the Hungarian National Council.

! The details of this situation will be more fully explain-
ed by Leonard L. Stamm who will hand you this letter.
For your convenience, I am attaching a copy of our
letter of Narch 2 above cited, and I would furtner state :
that we believe that extraordinary action should be
taken to affect the immediate processing of Genoral
Hennyey by entry permit or otherwise. Our reprezenta-
tives in Munich are in daily contact with General
Hennyey and can be of particular assistance in the event
you desire to use extraordinary means to expedite hia
departure for the United States.

General Gusztav Hennyey is Representative of the Hungarian National
Council in Nestern Germany and a persen {n whom ‘the Fund places trust and
confidence in its dealings with the problens of the Hunzartan National
Council. ‘The Fund hag beon desirors for sonu time that General Hennyey
come to the United States, and bolioves that hig visit hore sould be most
helpM to the prysent activities and future of the Hungarian National

Council. :

An opportunity presented itself last fall for General Nennyey to
emigrate to the United States as a displaced porson. He was granted a
viea by the Consul Goneral in Munich on November 21, 1951, SC Number 256L12,

his file was sent by the local representative of the U. S. Immigration
and Naturalization Services in Munich to the Office of the Attorney Gon-
eral in Washington for special consideration under Noe 3-CFR:17557.
Noither General Hennyey nor the National Council have been able to deter-
mine why his case has been held in suspense, by the Immigration and Natur
alization Service. Indeed, in response to ono inquiry Genaral Hennyey

As stated above, the

Fund attaches great importance to General Hennyey's visit to the United
States, and considers this visit to be of high operational importance,
since it will deeply affect the work of the Hungarian National Council.
We shail be very grateful for any assistance which you can render ia th
expedition of the decision of the Inaigration and Naturalisation Service.
I may add that General Hennyey's visa will expire on the ist of this
month, and he also will lose his rights owing to the expiration of the
Displaced Persons Act in the near future should he not be able to enigrate

promptly.

Nr, Vioolam called at his rocuort to inforr us of tho high
lights of his recent trip to Durope, Ho hai firet attended the
Beoting of the Eastern European Section of the Burerean Movement
in London, then vieited Franco, -imany and Italy,

Me, Vinofer said that in Gormany ho had talved vith Chancellor
Adenauer, Secretary of Stato Hallatein, and other offictala of the
Bonn Government, @3 well ae vith Mr. Rober and other Al?iod officials,
Ho said that the Germans vora rymyathetic to his discussion of
Iumanian affaire and shoved come intercnt in the :roblens of Eastern
Europe. They, emphasized, hovever, thet Gormany's prvsent position
Aid not enable then to speak in terme of any positive rolicy at this
tine, Mr. Visolem got the inpruvston that the Ge-mans vere now, and
would be in the future, even moro actively interested in Rania ~
ard othar Eastern burspean countries than were France and Italy.

Mr, Visolanu felt that F.ance had completely abdicated ite position
in Eastern Duroye and vas ontiroly wrapped uy in ite om domostio
Problezs and relations vith Germany.

Mr. Visotam also discussed in Gurmany the cuestion of Rumanian
refugees there (most of thom aro Iron Guardists) ani of the rather
large comunity of Yolksdeutsche who came to Germany from mania at
the close of the war, lle said that the Gorman authorities vould
like to have this group returned to Rumania at such tine as the
country might be litcrated, both buosuse they contrituted to Germany's
over=popuiation problem and because tioy would represent, as they
have in the past, & poosiblo instrument for German policy in Kumanias
As a Rumanian, Mr. Vicolam was not over amdous to aii to the mmbera
of the German minority tut felt that a free Funantan Government would
not deny the right of return to those who wished to do sa.

Hr. Vieolam talked ot length vith Mr. Tyler in Saris. Ho
Fetains his distrust and dislixe of the NCFE, which be saya can never
aseiet effectively in bringing atout unity in the Rumanian enisration -
since it supports one group 100% and persecutes the other group 100%.
He vas particularly incensed about Mr, Berle’s recent intervention in
the Malexa case, He seid that he rejarded tho situation as having very
serious iz: liostiore mt only for the emigree lut cleo for the future
of the country iteclf, He denounced kadescu's conduct, giving
mmerous exazples, as detrinental to the true intercst of Rmania, Ono
of his more specific complaints against the HCPL var the a;;ointzent
of Comarniaiu head tutor (or somo such title) at tho Free burope
Univeraity in Stra:bourg. He said that Comurniciu ha: no education
and no qualifications for the post but vas there merely becsuso he ves
of the Radosou fection vhich KCFE favored.

INTRODUCTORY sISTORY

Formative Stage

At its inception, the National Committee for a Froa Europe
belteve: that its [ron Curtain broadossting operation, Radio Free
Europa, could and should bo developed and pursued throwh tho medius
of "Kational Councils" or "Comaittees of Liberation" composed of
exile grosps from the target oountrles, It wus considered that

promia: ile lenders and porsonalities of each nstionality group

could exzross to their captive countrymen, entirely without American

Advice acd guidanoo, the mezsage of hop» whieh NCFS proposed to sand.

This coscezt waa mot fulfilled. Experience in attempting to weld

talented, dedicated group of exiles into a non-partisan broadcasting

operation early demonstrated that without Amorican control tre mission
of RFS would be lost in the jungle of exile-morld politics, It scon
became evident thet the leadership among the exiles wie neither suffi-

y strong nor personally willing to rise above the political cross

of

currents, factional rivalries, ant 6;}intersgroup woaknosses characters
fatieatly reminiscent of the political affairs of all Eastern Buropean

countries, fnose factors militated against the original plan of permitting


exiles, through thelr loosely organized Couceils or Committees, to

nage, ad control RFZ broadcasting.

Since tho adver’ of KFE was the mcct important development

such views would be broadcart to their captive countrymen becaxe the

pattern of their pseudo covperation. This gettern was followed to such

be not only tepracticable, but dangerous. For example, tho National

to

pursued by Hungarians, gulgarians, and Poles until the futility of por-
mitting the oxile Counolle to control the destiny and broadvasting
yoliefos of RFE was made clear beyond refutation, It became tragioally
edrious thst uncontrolled oxile-merld Couno{is and professional polt~

tictass could not agree on personnel selection or program contents

In aplte of every effort to induce harmony in and obtain proper

eocperation from the "Councils", "Committoes", and individuale, RFE was .

Ley

eonfreated with an impasse, The ulternative theory and present

of Averican sclection of non-political exile personnel was the only way

out. It has worked. Technically qualified personnel produce properly

oriented programs == and have boon doing 8c with documentod succosa

since July, 1950, Disappointed exile politicians, professional exile

Deldeare, Vico-President, National Councils Division, and Robert E. Lang,

Director, EFE. The current policy

officers and of the Board of Directors of NCFE.



B. Devolopment Stage

Upon the collapse of the original concept of broadcasting undor
exile auspices, RFE nocorsurily utilized some exile personnel endorsed
and rocommended by the lavders of the verious nationality groups. As
tochnieal radio facilities came inty boing, exiles with radio background
or writing talont worn required for tho production of programs. This .
involved using individuals endnently qualified by experience to do a
radio job of seript witiog, announcing, seting, ote., without regard
for the fact that such individuals might ba porouna non grata with one
or another politieel fection or lesder of an exile *Council". It also
Anvolved elimination of proven inefficient, inept or unworthy Individuals

without regard for their exile “Council” sponsorship. in either instance

eritioism of RFE was predicteble and indeed wus always forthcoming ==

often in virulent and dishenezt form.

Tho dey to dey operstion of EFZ developed new techniques ang

long range plans which sade {t impossible to employ non-entities of no

politios! color or conviction. Thy best poople to produco prograus in

harmony with NCFE-HPE purzoses and policies necessarily wore persons
know in their own couatrise for their views on domostio political af-

feirs and their antieCommunist activities, Lardehitting propaganda

required hard-hitting personalities whose knoa: association with RPE
and ita programs would 44d validity and significance for our captive
sudlonses, Gradually, therefore, the nationality desks of RFE at Kew
York and Munich were staffed with tested, qualified exiles who liad been


Adentifiod publicly with domestic polities! philosophios at issue in
their own countries. Many, in fuel, moat of the staff people are con=
troversial Cigures among theittuen countrymen in oxactly the samo ay

Andeed are mombere of tha Couscils, but are mon of auffiolent stature
to give thelr primary allegiance to thy non-partiaan policy of RFE. Tho
“doctaive factor Le thut tines be no controversy or quostion about their

anti-Communiat convictions and records.

At this point, tt must bo noted that our target countries have

bean subjoct to repetitive political format prior to and following

World War II, as woll as the sucesssive occupations of Nazi and Communist
Armies.

The tempor of the times, therefore, in which these exiles have

lived for the past fifteen years has been one of excitement, bitternass,

recrimination, rivalries, aod personal turmoil =» all stemming from both

nad foreign struggles for powsr. The timas have produced a

domestic
bumper crop of refugoo traitors, collaborators, and opportunists and at
the same time have devoloped pure Western style democrats, true national

patriots, and unselfis!: honsat men. Tho exile who stood by placidly

through the era is not much good, hzwevor talented, as a militant messen-
gor of hope via RFF; exiles who were honorably active in public affeirs

at home, and who had radio talont were, therefore, the only kind of

personnel auituble for RFE purposes.

As the necessity for American operational control of nationality

desks decane self-evident, the only feasible personnel policy mas to


omploy proporly qualified individuals, regurdlssa of exile politics.
In the exvcution of this polley individwiis mio wore usoleus were
eliminated without regard for political sponsors. This process still
gocs ons Sintlarly, talented exile porsocalities recruited from any
source wore employed whérover noodod, This procuss still goes on.

Both processes are in vogus with a healthy dierngard for oxile pulitical
nuances and protests. Noitior process is satisfactory to selfestyled
exile loaders since it follows that the appointment of an individual
aponsored by one faction as a represontative of its views, inevitably

will oyoke howls of rage and eriticiam from the opyosite faction. This

is an uccepted fact of exile life. We have to live with it and got on

with the job.

C. Summary

Our formative and davelopmont exzeriences evolved the prosent
and continuing exile personnel policies of RZ. Exile desk employees,
whether at Now York or Munich, must respond to thres testes

(a) Security cluarance,

(b) Endorsement of technical profictency,

(c) Sufficient stuture to eliminate exile partisan
Anterssts from program content.

General Principles

Ae Recruitment -

The best source of exile personne! is referral by “non~

profossional® exiles themselves, Anong )1 nationalities there are



Be

many talented refugees who need employment and who can supply RFS's
nee2 for soript writers, actors, announcers, etc. Accordingly, desk
staffing has beon accomplished by examining the qualif‘eations of duly
reooyzmonded individuals, whether the recomzendations come from political
personalities or otherwise. Selection 1s basud on tho abllity of the
individual to fill a need efficiently in turning out or participating
in planned programs. Recruitment Ls determined only by tdoologieal
security, independence of oxile politics, and personal ability. This
is not to say that many individual exiles having decided personal con=
vietions aud well-knom political records are not employed, but «
positive statement is made that those exile employees who now produce

grams reflect the policies and guidance of RFE rather than prow

motion of partisan objectives and personalities.

Recruitment -- Detailed Procedures

The personnel complement of each RFE nationality desk is

founded on a hard core of dependable individuals, usually two or three

including the chief of the desk. “Dependability” is established

Peo
by extaustive inguiry at all available sources to establish the desir-

ability, reliability, technical proficiency and security of the working

core of the desk. Sources used ares

(a) Exile political personalities in the United States,

(b) Exile references of nigh standing and know im-
partiality in the United States and Overseas,

(¢) Overseas contacts and personal knowledge of our
Amerioan representative in Europe. (Royall Tyler-Paris),

(a) Checks and balances of our political advisor at
Munich (W. E. Griffith),



(e) British Broadcasting Corporation, where apzlicable,
(£) Voice of America, where applicable,
- (c) Special confidential sources.

Theso tests having been applied, confidence is placed in these
initial personalities, and particularly in the tad Chief, to cafry
forward rvcruitmont of additional personnel as needed in collaboration
with the American Director of RPE (Robert E. Lang, New York ), and his
associate officials. Tho leading porsonslitios of oach desk know what
1a expected of them and since they respond to the established criteria,
tine resulting full personnel complement is a group of exiles who, not-
with standing their porsonal political views, are suitable and capadle
progres production people. They meet our basic requirement of daily
production of truly free and properly constructed propaganda broadcasts

cepable of avaking the widest possible audience response in our target

countries.

In brief, the mission of RFE boing conceived as a marketing

problex, the best available salesmen are procured, trained, and utilised

to sell the market.

tnent _-- Spacial Seourity Meusures

Since RFZ, although @ private enterprise, is by extension a
collateral instrument of American national policy, special precaution
is exercised to insure the ideological security of all employees, in=

eluding exiles. In the case of exile personnel specifically, the



D.

additional approval of the Personnel Diroctor of NCFE is required bofore
employment, either at New York or Munich. Thus, even if @ proposéd

exile enployeo meets all the doscribed criteria ho may not be employod

without this ultimate approval, °

The Personnel Dirostor of NCFH utilizes appropriate and do
pondablo sources of infornation to determine the accoptability of
personnel froma security standpoint. His sources are investigative in
nature and aro conclusive as to the ideological record and security
acceptability of the proposed employee, In doubtful casés the Personnel
Director consults with the Vice-President in Charge of the National
Councils Division and with the Director of Radio Freo Europe. These
throe officers of NCFE jointly follow a policy of rejecting candidates
about whom there is the slightest doubt. It is to be clearly understood
that in making decisions of this kind tho conflicting interests and

frantic representations of politically minded exile leaders and groups

are ignored. Acceptance or rejection of candidates is wholly based on

Adeclogical security ond talent value.

Summary

(1) All nationality desks of RFE at New York and Municn are

ataffed by individuals who have passed all tests described above.
(2) All programa produced and aired by tho nationality desks
are checked and scrutinized by Anerican supervisory personnel for .ideolog=

ical content, audience acceptance and conformity to basic NCFE-RFS policies.

(3) These conditions have been progressively in force since

July, 1950,

RFE POLICY GUIDANCE FOK PERSONNEL

A. Gonoral Comment

The progroms aired by RFE are not left to whim or chunce, ALL

program and tho personnel responsible for them are controlled by @

written polloy manual, Tho manual sets forth in minuto dotat] the
position and policy of RFE on every topic beamed to our target countries.
Tho canual ia the daily guidance of all employoes, both Amorican and
Exiles doviation from its rules 1s not permitted. Continuous cerutiny
of nanuscripts and resultant broadcasts is maintuined by American om=

pleyoos to inaure that there are no deviutiona.

Tho policy manual of RFE reprecente the conaidored views of
thy responsible officials, including the Dosrd of Directors, of NCFE

It fc @ etatoment of the principies end purposes of NCFE expressed in

operational form. It is considered and maintained as a atrictly con-

fidential document, but it 1s of course available for examination by any

proper authority.

j the policy manual io in strict conformity with current American
national policies as evidenced by the following quotation from Article
ones, .

"As a non-governmental radio staticn responsible to
the millions of American citizers who support it,
RFE cannot take a line contrary to United States
Government policy or to tne beliefs of the American
poople reflocted in the Constitution of the United
‘States and in Arerican Institutions”.

-We-


Tho above quytation 1s understood by exile porsonne] par=
tioulerly to be a sclemn injunction against ideological program content .
which in any way violates tia letter and spirit of Amorican poliey and
ideals, It 4a 4 guarantec to the American people and to our captive
Uatenors thet RFE and tho men who make ite programs ure uneonproatetrgty!

opposed to the Comrunict regimes now in power in Soviet Kussia and thea |

satoliity countries, '

RFE Policy Definud by tlundbook (Diroct Quotations)
1. Tho purposo of RFE 1s to ccntribute to tho literntion of

the Nations imprisoned bohind tho Iron Curtain by sustaining their

morale and stimulating in them a apirit ef non-oooperation with the

Soviot-dominated regimes by which thoy are, for tho timo boing, ruled.

2, Tho central characterietic of RFE is that it is the in~
strumont. of men who ure engaged in fighting for fraedom and Justice.
As such, it oncourages resistance to every tyrent, groat and smll, in
the countries it addresses, [tu speukers speak s+. ac mon of good will
who seek to contribute to the elimination of old enmities and the

building ci an endurirg European democratic order.

3. As a free furun in which exiles speak to their own people
RFE ie particularly dedicated to arguments by which exiles seck to
persuade their listeners of tho all devouring ambitions of Soviet

Imperialiam, the cruelty end unworkability of Communist Institutions

ene



{

and the proven advanteges of the denocratic way of life for the worker,

the peasant, the administratcr, and the business and professional
atrata of society.

4. RPE tékes counsel with exile leaders and 1s respectful
of their viows, but its policy 1s not desigued to furthor tho aspira=

tions of any single exile leader or party.

8. HKFE policy is further based upen acceptance of the prin=
ciple that oach of the liberated pecples shall be froe to dotermine

for itself the polities) and social institutions under which it will

live once it hus been liberated.

6. Finally, the following sumrary in tho nature of a sposific

" Limitation on program content is quoted:

"It ie indispensable that all concerned grasp clearly
that RFE {a @ multienational station established to
contritute to the liberation of all the peoplos it
addresses, and not rerely of one of those peoples.
RFE policy is therefore commanded by the Linitation
that nothing may be said over its facilities to one
nutional audience which will destroy the vonfidence
in RFE of its other audiences or which is likely to
induce any of its audiences to prefer communist rule
toa literation which sight appear to promise domina-
tion by @ neighboring people.”

KEMORANDUM FORs SPC
SUBJECTS Laaflot Balloons for use in Paycholosical Warfare

1, On at least four occasions Mr. William Scripps, Detroit News,
directly or indirectly has approached the Goverunent with proposals for
utilization of ‘balloons for psychological warfare. Following is a list
of tho dates and mothod of those approachoss

a, 12 October 1950 - Letter from General W. Je Donovan to DCI
enclosing “Operation Ballast.” On 1 Novenber 1950 William H, Jackeon
responded to this meviorondum to the effect that this suggested opera
tion was being referred to’ the appropriate persons ani suggesting a
pubsoquent mooting with Donovan to discuss this and othar mattera,

b, In November 1950 as ve were undertaking planning for devolop-
mont of balloons vith General Mills, ve were informed that Mr, Scripps
planned @ general meating to be held in Washington to discuss balloons,
Through the Genoral Mills Washington Representative Mr. Soripps waa
persuaded to keep his meeting general and vas informed that the various
agencies of tho Government had the matter under consideration and
considered that it vould not be in the public intarest at this time
to disclose tho nature of their findings, Consequently, Mr. Scripps
forverded ua on 1 December 1950 a proposal "The Use of Free Balloons
for Load Carrying Purposes" which we acknowledged on 11 December 1950.

ee On December 26, 1950 General Smith reveived a letter from
Blair Moody sumsarising a suggestion from Mr. William Scrippe for
encouraging defection of Chinese Communist troops, A routine response
to his letter waa sent 6 Jamary 1951 from Mr. Jackson, I believe
elso Mr, Moody called upon the Director in early February of 1951 to
discuss use of balloons for psychological warfare, AUPC addressed a
briefing memorandum to DCI on 12 February 1951, Subjs Balloons for
Carrying PW Material to Soviet Areas,

2. In Septenbor 1950 the NPSB requested that ClA should represent all
interested azencies of this Goverment and should acooniingly take steps
te develop, procure and stockpile.an appropriate number of scientifically
designed balloons for future propaganda use in conditions of international
emergency, At mootinzs of the NPSB on 13 February 1951 and 11 June 1951
4t was agreed that OPC would procure and stockpile 1,000 large leaflet
balloons for use by tho appropriate ageacy when ani if such use vas
euthorised, The Board also agreed that inquiries vhich the various govern-

mental agencies

COR deA HAL



ABOU HAL ~

w2e-

ae mental agencies might receive concerning use of balloons would be answered
ae to the effoct"that the mattor 1s under continuous atudy by agencies of the
Government but disclosure of results at this time would not be in the public

interest.”

3. A perusal of tho NPSB minutes sinse June 1951 did not indicate
further consideration by that group of the subject of balloons, from this
we mist infer that CIA still bears the responaibility of the conmitacnt
made by Mr, Wisnor for procurement. i

4. For your information this research and devolopment has been con= i alee
ducted for CIA by Goneral Milla with ONR| .

= : continued along with ONK's program of coule
ray research, We/obligated to OMR to deny a newspaper access to these
dravings, specifications, movies and reports which bear a SECRET classification.

5. I might make one small suggestion that since Mr. Blair Moody is
now a Senator and running for re-election in the next election, 1t might be
possible to solicite his aid in bringing Mr, Scripps in line with adopted
policy regarding balloons should it become necessary.

TELEPIONC CALLA, WILLIA! SCRIPPS, DETHOIT MEWS COMP IDENTIAL

On ?'March, Wiliten Cripps of the Detroit Neva, called and asked for price
eotinate in lots of 100,000 of a carrier balloon syaten viuich vould carry

300 pounds great distances. On discussion, it epyeared that ho was in-

toreutod in sorathing equivalent to our interin cysten, a0 I told nim wo hed
made a quotation on such a pioce of ezuipvent in quantities for prices in the
rane of 5350 a unit, Tis plece of ejutpaunt under the expected wind con-
ition, whould carry 190 pourds 150u nile and deliver it vith the best possible

accuracy fro: @ balloon veiicle.

I aoked bin 1f he vanted specifications, but he said he would get these later.

Ue was vorking with a yratp vio vould use thes to carry propaganda, and he would
geo us in two weerz, acc tren would discuss an¢ ovtein exhibits, It vos pointed
out to hin that this e;ufpment and polyetiylere were well controlled by the
government, This eppeared t+ be no problen to hin. ae

Seripps called again on 14 Varch, and esked if we could atterd a lumcheon in
Detroit Wednesday noon, the 2nd of April, and then go on to New York for a
luncheon Thursday nom, te avued that we bring along data, cost eatinates,
exhibits, and all scales data, eu well as revies, to this meeting. I asked if
this had been, cleared vith AuLott's friends, and he didn't appear to know wht
I woo talking atout. I told him that some clearance would nae to be obtained
before wither the zeer wan chown, or before it would be permitted to leave the
country. Scripps is rost entiuslestic avout support forthcasing to carry suck
an operation forvard, ard felt that the State Lepartnent vould interpose no

objections for the procran plamed,

Seripps asked that we confirs on 19 Harch whether or not you and I would be
able to attend. This I promised to do. I vould also like your suidance es

to what course should be pursed in this, It is believed that certainly Datley
or Gatco Lloyd aboulé ve case aware of this effort, eo that we may deport
ourselves accordingly. Incidentally, Levey and Almy will be at both t#etings,
in Uew York and Letroit. Upon asked if ve hed any odiections, I said, "OF

A little incidont has caused o bit of trouble and a flurry of

Prenix's assistant, Mr. Hiller, has written to tolling

that Millor has been called in by our chop and questioned in
detail about recont/ | accounting.

khethor or not he was quostioned in detail 49 a matter on which ~
be and I might disagree tut is really of no consequence since tho
accounting by should normally go through us to Miller, and I
think you would agree that wo nad a right to ask questions about ite
Waat bothers me a little, however, 1o Killer's writing to »
giving details of how our two offices work together.
turns out, wae annoyed by the content of Ailler's letter, not eo

had been no mention ty Killer of details of our relationship there
would have been no annoyance.

Dear Bob,

IT have not done much reporting on cur Gerven
negotiations for suveral reasonsy first, there was not
Ruch to report and, second, whatever there was Dick Condon
undertook to forward from tontene I did write C.D. @
couple of letters outlining our da@laya ani sone of our un=
cartainties, and last week I cabled him thac J would send
a nore detafled narrative von I got to Paris. As ha is
now technically no longer President of NCFE, and a2 Aduirel
Miller may not have been completely inforaed of all thatw
are trying to do, Tam addressing this to you, with copy to

@ach of ‘home

mh the first Tiace, let ma say that progress
during the lnst half of last week was surprisinily epeedy
and encouraging, Thete sre stil! ‘any opportunities for
the well known ®slip ttwixt the cup anc the lip", and local
Gertan political considerations coulc roar their ugly heads
at any woment. J think it must algo be understood at, as
Dick Condon puts it, no satter now meny nor how good written
agroe-ents we may ‘have covering our operations, the whole
RPE enterprise in Gar-anyMll have t. be played pretty much
by oar once the contractual agreuments take effects, I rezurd
this, however, as an inescapable risk, and I ~extion it now
only to etphagize the parctouat importance of the ut-ost care
in programming and in ccndiet to «vol! a boror which could
upsat our entire apple-cart. The very ravorabdle repert which
apat friend Asher Lee made after his hurried inspe tion of
Munich underlines tn: need for regular spot check on program
output to avoid howlers, and the neec for this once our
relationship with tne Ger.ens is nc loner through the Occu=
pation Authorities or HICOG 4s even core imperative.

Dick Condon s-nt you from Munich the text of the
proposed Bunces post license which we acrecd on with Dre
Schuster on Fo. rucry 19, 1952, and this should long since

have rosched yous

the interest of tie Facurnl Nepuvlic®, We objected to this

on two grcouniss
a) thet such provision had no logical place in

a technical License, ond
hat 1t meds ar position far too precarious

since it uxposed us to license cancellation
practically at the whim of any Gercsn bureaus

crat,

b)

and we persuaded Pr, schustar to leave it out of the liconse
and let us discuss the preblem at Bonn. At Bonn, we vere
fortunately able to persuade the Foratin Office officials
that auch a provision hed no tectniczl place in the license,
and tat whatever shoul be seid on the subject should be
aid in an exchane of lotters, or the equivalent, batwoon
the yoreiin Office and ourselves. Accordingly, Article IT

. now contains but on: clause.

2) Guestion war reiacd by the Poretzn office

ofricials at Bonn rocarcine the largth of the
license. Thetext Dick sent you provides for validity until
August 31, 1960, The reason I chore tnat cate wos that it Js
the expiration date of our lesso on the Holzxirchen transe
mitter site, and I thought tuat if 45 arbitrary term were to
be fixed that tying it in with the ffolzkirchen lease gave it
a@ ylaugisility whien woulc hein accuptance = and that proved
to te the case so far a3 the Bundespost was concerned,

The Foreign Office pecple told us, however, that
nyterous «uestions had been «sxed in the Sundestag regarding
RPB and its programs, enc that for the dovern-ent, to give us
a license for a3 long a3 eivht years would cause surious
criticism, Ye are a peculiar surt of animal, anyway, and
for our irregular activities to ve vlessed with such long
tern 2o;raval would, they thought, be unwise for buth their
and our soints of view, accoraingly, they sus“sate? & fours
tee periods J counterod with: five, datin: from the date of

icense issuance whien (since It canact take place before

the contractual asrounsnta becore erfective, may 1 be late
in 1952) will give us consideratly nore tran five years life
expectancy. My om feeling 4s that $2 we have not done our
Job within five years, we might az woll pull down the shade
and go hom In any case, ny counter proposal was, x: ¥ said,
accepted, Article JII of tne license wili now reads

Tnis license shall be valid for a period

of five years com encing witn the d«te of
its issuance ant il be automatically
extenied thereafter from year to year unless

I had the very uncomfortable feeling that ve were

We finally got tne young cKap to agres that he wouls try to

AP. Phenix stated that the NCFE hed been founded in
‘1949 by @ group of private Auerican oitizens aninated ay
the desire to encourage by positive measures the eventual
Liberation from the oonsunist yoks of the peoplse of the
enelaved countries. of Sentral and Eastern Europe. He
oxplsined that with the help of endowmentea and publia
sontritutions to the Cruesde for Preeflong the Comittee had
undertaken, among ite other activities, the operation through
RaGio Pree Europe of radio broadcasting installations through
.Woieh 16 disseminated to listcners in the Iron Curtain

the furtherance of its objectives. He pointed out that

that ite prograne were prepared vith the help of lesiing

ur, Phenix explained that the inatallation of RYE
fagilitiea in the United 8t..tes Zone of Gersany hid been
effected by the neris the gocupation of that zone


cry

by the U.S. Amy and that the operations of RFE had been, and
wore being facilitated by the U.8 Arny authorities because of
FFE's status as an accredited Anerican information

agency. He observed that the NCYE was concerned leet the
termination of the Osoupation Statua would, in the absence

of specific agreement with the Federal German Republic, re=
sult in hampering the work of RYE and impairing ite effect
avene GB, and that, with the approval of the Departuent of
Btate, negoviaticns had been carried on with the BPMin which

had resulted in agreement as to the terne of a license which
would be granted by the BPMin to NCYE insediately upon the
termination of the Occupation Btatute. A copy of that license
is appended hereto,

ur, Phenix called attention te the fact that this license
deelt with the technical aspests of RFE's radio broadcast
operations and that there vere several non~teohnical matiers
Wiich required clarification before the HGYE would feel
Juetified in undertaking the long range program it has under

ooneideration,
Dr. stated that the objectives and purposes

of NCFE, 1a the realization of which RPE was enraged, vere
adjectives and purposes to which the Federal Covernaent itself
was unalterably eeanitted. The negotiations for a BRMin

license had been conducted with his full knowledge and apprevel.
Be was woll aware that by licensing RPE's eperation in Germany,
fully cognizant of the objectives and purposes of that operation,
the Federal Oovernzen® was on the ene hand encouraging the
expenditure by BCFE for that operation of large eunms of coney
eontrabuted by the Ancrican publis aad on the other



3

was giving NCFE an assurance that RFE's operation in Germany
would not be interfered with, but on the contrary would be
facilitated and helped by the Federal Government,

Yrou his viewpoint there was only one reservation he had
te makes RFE would be expected to refrain from using ite broad=
oaet facilities on Gemien soil for the purpose of advocating
and promoting political enda whieh the Federal Governuent con=
eidered in conflict with ite own basic policies. Hence, the
Voderal (overnment.would have the right, officially to aotify
NCFE through the Foreign Office of any such conflict. Should the
German stations of HFE thercupen not refrain frou advocating
and prouoting the policies to which the Federal devernsent had
objected, the Foderal Government would have no cholo? but to
require the surrender by NCFE of its licenge and the diccontinudnoce
of ite oroadcast operations fro: Gernan territory.

Nx, Phenix stated that he understood the reasona for
the views expreased by Dr. » ascepted his reservution,
and agreed to the procedure outlined, and that to provide a
factual basie for the consideration of any question whieh might
arise in respect of RFE broadcasts the latter would keep on
file for a period of 30 days froc the cate of use all tapes
recording prograss broadcart fron RFE transuitteres in Gernany
60 that any queetioned prorram would be ava‘lable te the appro=
rriate German aut}.oritiee when requested hy Chom. ur, Phenix
tren emphasized the inportance attached by CFE to certain other
@mecta of the operating pro>lens of RFE, for exenmplet



ce e 4e

(a) that prenerty of NCFE >rourht into Germany prior

to the temination of the Occupation Statute be recognised as
- lerally within Gernany and subject to the free dinposition of

KCPE,

(b) that NCFS be recopmized ae & non=profis orrvanization
