PCI EDWARD SORGER, JR. has advised SA CHARLES. E.
ROBINSON that he is acquainted with captioned individuals,
having become acquainted with them while endeavoring to
secure approval of the Washington State Patrol as an

become involved with BECKHAM and CRISMAN the more he is
suspicious of their operations. They have established ~<
a lobbying group known as the Associated Amitlance and
Tow-Car Operators, Inc. and the National Institute of
Criminology, Inc. Both. corporations were formed by CRISMAN
and BECKHAM as Washington corporations.

Captain CHET BREUER of the Olympia Police Depart-—
ment has obtained copies of material prepared for the
National Institute of Criminology, Inc., wherein there is
advertised a course of study promising a "PHD" for about
$400.00. It appears that the firm is very likely a
confidence game aimed at those with little educational
background.

heard a conversation between BECKHAM and CRISMAN wherein
CRISMAN said that he was taking $100,000.00.in "cold cash"
from the Democratic Central Committee to Calidrnia., About
ten days later CRISMAN appeared at SORGER's place of

$90,000.00 to someone in a hotel lobby in California, the
money coming from the Washington State Central Democratic
Committee for use of the Democratic Party in California.

However, he was short $10,000.00 and made a side trip to

Las Vegas, Nevada to obtain the additional $10,000.00.

SORGER advises that CRISMAN claims to be a
Doctor of Psychology working with various higher level
state employees who have psychiatric problems,

SORGER has claimed to have given $500.00 to
BECKHAM and CRISMAN to assist in starting the captioned
corporations and in response to their claims as lobbyists
and a pretense that they will assist him in getting his
ambulance business approved by the Washington State Patrol,
they in turn wanting ten percent of the profit in addition
to a $25.00 monthly retainer.

Captain BREUER has advised that he has made
inquiry at the Texas Department of Safety, Austin, Texas;
the Oregon State Police at Salem, Oregon, and the King
County Sheriff's Office at Seattle of the subjects with
negative results. The Seattle Police Department records
show that a FRED LEE CRISMAN, born 7/22/19,formerly
resided at 1048 South Thistle, Seattle, as of 9/28/66.

Captain BREUER has further advised that CRISMAN |
and BECKHAM as co-owners of the Professional Research
Bureau received a business license from the City of
Olympia on 9/14/66, stating their purpose was public re-
lations, research psychology and criminology.

I suspect that BECKHAM and CRISMAN are con men.
The Bureau is requested to advise if it has any

information inits files which can be identified with
BECKHAM and CRISMAN.
