_BYSPEBTALGEL

PCI EDWARD SORGER, JR. has advised SA CHARLES E.

ROBINSON that he 1s acquainted with captioned individuals,

having become acquainted with them while endeavoring to

secure approval of the Washington State Patrol as an

ambulance service operator at Olympia.

The more he has

become involved with BECKHAM and CRISMAN the more he is

suspicious of their operations. They have established

a lobbying group known as the Associated Amulance and

Tow-Car Operators, Inc. and the National Institute of

Criminology, Inc.

Both corporations were formed by CRISMAN

and BECKHAM.

as Washington corporations.

Captain CHET BREUER of the Olympia Police Depart-

ment has obtained copies of material prepared for the

National Institute of Criminology,

Inc., wherein there is

advertised a course of study promising a "PHD" for about

$400.00.

It appears that the firm is very likely a

confidence game aimed at those with little educational

background.

SORGER advises that in August,

1966, he over-

heard a conversation between BECKHAM and CRISMAN wherein

CRISMAN said that he was taking $100,000.00 in "cold cash"

from the Democratic Central Committee to

â€¢ Caliornia.

About

ten days later CRISMAN appeared at SORGER's place of

business at which time he commented that he had delivered

$90,000.00 to someone in a hotel lobby in California, the

money coming from the Washington State Central Democratic

Committee for use of the Democratic Party in California.

However, he was short $10,000.00 and made a side trip to

Las Vegas, Nevada to obtain the additional $10,000.00.

SORGER advises that CRISMAN claims to be a

Doctor of Psychology working with various higher level

state employees who have psychiatric problems.

SORGER has claimed to have given $500.00 to

BECKHAM and CRISMAN to assist in starting the captioned

corporations and in response to their claims as lobbyists

and a pretense that they will assist him in getting his

ambulance business approved by the Washington State Patrol,

they in turn wanting ten percent of the profit in addition

to a $25.00 monthly retainer.

Captain BREUER has advised that he has made

inquiry at the Texas Department of Safety, Austin, Texas;

the Oregon State Police at Salem, Oregon, and the King

County Sheriff's Office at Seattle of the subjects with

negative results. The Seattle Police Department records

show that a FRED LEE CRISMAN, born 7/22/19, formerly

resided at 1048 South Thistle, Seattle, as of 9/28/66.

Captain BREUER has further advised that CRISMAN

and BECKHAM

as co-owners of the Professional Research

Bureau received a business license from the City of

Olympia on 9/14/66, stating their purpose was public re-

lations, research psychology and criminology.

I suspect that BECKHAM and CRISMAN are con men.

The Bureau is requested to advise if it has any

information inits files which can

be identified

with

BECKHAM and CRISMAN.
