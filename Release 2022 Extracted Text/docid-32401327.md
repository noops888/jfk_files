DAILY SUMMARY

9 December 1963

This summary of significant information has not been coordinated

outside the Office of Current Intelligence. It does not represent a

complete coverage of all current reports received, nor does time

permit the complete evaluation of all reports which are included.

CONTENTS

MILITARY DEVELOPMENTS:

Three independent clandestine sources have reported on

the unloading of military equipment from the Soviet vessel

METALLURG BAIKOV in Havana harbor on 19 or 20 November.

(Page 1)

Soviet "coastal defense rockets" now belong to Cuban Army

artillery forces,

according to a recent speech by Raul

Castro; however, Soviets still appear to be involved in

the communications net which serves the cruise missile

system. (Page 1)

FIDEL CASTRO'S SPEECH:

In a 6-7 December speech devoted mainly to education,

Cas-

tro digressed to discuss the situation resulting from Vene-

zuela's charge that the arms cache discovered on

a Vene-

zuelan beach last month had come from Cuba. Castro implied

that the arms had been planted by CIA and

are being used

as a pretext for new action by the "imperialists and their

lackeys" against Cuba..

He expressed confidence that what-

ever the result, the Cuban revolution will not be defeated.

(Page 2)

CUBAN INTERNAL SITUATION:

Faure Chomon Mediavilla is replacing Omar Fernandez as

transportation minister; Major Jesus Montane Oropesa will

be new communications minister. (Page 3)

Heavy rainfall has apparently caused damages to military

facilities in Pinar del Rio Province and hampered travel

in Oriente

Province. (Page 4)

MILITARY DEVELOPMENTS:

Three independent clandestine sources have reported the

unloading of military equipment from a Soviet cargo vessel,

probably the METALLURG BAIKOV, on 19 or 20 November. This

vessel was suspected of carrying a military cargo long before

its arrival in Cuba.

(See Daily Summary of 12 November.)

It

carried what was probably the eighth full military cargo to

arrive in Cuba since the 1962 missile crisis.

One source,

retired civil engineer whose reporting has been factual and

in most instances based on personal observation, reported that

the METALLURG BAIKOV unloaded "large quantities of arms and

military equipment! in Havana on 20. November and left the next

Another

source reported that Havana longshoremen had

stated that a Soviet ship, which they did not identify, had

unloaded arms at Regla Wharf, Havana, on 20 November.

source,

an educated Cuban of

Western

European extraction who

is a resident of Havana, reported that tanks were among the

equipment unloaded from a Soviet vessel that arrived in Havana

on 19 November.

The three sources are probably referring to

the same shipment.

If the report on the delivery of tanks is

true, this would be the second consecutive reported shipment

of armored vehicles to Cuba.

The ORENBURG reportedly delivered

some 45 tanks on 23 or 24 October. (See Daily Summaries of 28

and 29 October.) It has previously been reported that another

probable military shipment, the ninth, is now en route aboard

the SLUTSK.

(See Daily Summary of 3 December.) (CIA TDCS-DB-

The Soviet "coastal defense rockets" now belong to the

Cuban Army artillery forces, according to a recent speech by

Raul Castro.

Cubans probably have been training in cruise

missile operations

since last spring, and the rotation and

withdrawal of some Soviet naval personnel in September suggested

that the cruise missile system was turned over to the Cubans

at that time.

A Soviet communications net which probably serves

the cruise missile system remains active, however, indicating

FIDEL CASTRO'S SPEECH:

Fidel Castro's speech of the night of 6-7 December was

on the occasion of the graduation of women teachers for the

literacy campaign. He devoted most of the 99 minutes to a

discussion of the development of local education in Cuba. At

one point, however, he made a moderately long digression to

discuss Venezuela and the situation raised by Venezuela's dis-

covery last month of a large cache of weapons, some of which

have been traced to Cuba.

Castro stated that,

while "the imperialists and their

lackeys" charge that Cuba is promoting subversion in Vene-

zuela, rebellion and subversion cannot be promoted from with-

The Venezuelan revolution, he maintained, stems from

the Venezuelan people's own disgust with their government and

with its permitting the "imperialists" to plunder Venezuela's

from the outside, why, he asked, have all

the resources of im-

perialism failed

to subvert the Cuban Government?

the United States to take military action against Cuba, Castro

As a pretext the Venezuelans say they have discovered

arms from Cuba on the Venezuelan coast, Castro stated.' "Some

01 the arms," he said, "are said to have borne an effaced Cuban

seal, and other arms are said to be bazookas, recoilless cannon,

mortars. But Cuban mortars perchance? No! Yankee mortars!

Yankee bazookas! Yankee recoilless cannon! Arms which we did

Cuba, by implying that the CIA had obtained Cuban arms from

Cuban deserters and that it would not be difficult to plant

these weapons in Venezuela.

to the Belgian-made light rifles and submachineguns which have

been identified as among those shipped to Cuba in 1959 and

FIDEL CASTRO'S SPEECH - cont'd

"Things have changed quite a bit," Castro declared, "to

attack or to blockade Cuba now would

not be easy; we can de-

fend ourselves; we are calm; we know what we have to defend

ourselves with."

Then, in an implied reference to the Soviet

shipment of strategic missiles to Cuba last year, Castro de-

clared:

"When we hear some of these lackeys of imperialism

talking so calmly about invading Cuba, when it has been only

they are once more proving

us right and are once more justifying Cuba's taking defensive

measures; this talk led to the October crisis." Castro then

declared that "these men are so deceived by their own propaganda

that...they cannot conceive of what any invader would meet here."

A war against Cuba, he said, "would not end while there was a

single mercenary soldier treading on our soil."

Castro then returned briefly to his views as to how peace

can be assured in the Caribbean.

"Whatever they want to dis-

cuss with Cuba," he said, "let them come and discuss honestly

with Cuba; because we have stated the indispensable prerequisites

for

a peaceful atmosphere...in the Caribbean."

Thus

far, how-

ever, "they have answered with aggressions on top of aggressions."

I'his course, he said, "is doomed to failure." (CIA FBIS Havana,

7 December, OFFICIAL USE ONLY)

CUBAN INTERNAL SITUATION:

A shake-up in the Cuban cabinet has moved Faure Chomon

Mediavilla to the post of transportation minister; he succeeds

Capt. Omar Fernandez,

whose ministry was recently under attack

oy Castro for alleged inefficiencies and "vices." Major Jesus

Montane Oropesa is replacing Chomon as comnunications minister.

Chomon, who served as Castro's first ambassador to the

Soviet Union, took over as communications minister in March

1962.

He is currently a member of the National Directorate

Of PURS.

Fernandez, his predecessor, is reportedly moving to

an unspecified position in the Ministry of Industries under

Che Guevara.

Montane took part in the attack on the Moncada Barracks

in 1953 and followed Castro to exile in Mexico. He took part

in the GRAMA expedition of 1956 when he was captured and im-

prisoned. After the revolution, he reportedly received only

a minor post in the government because he had talked too much

in prison.

His most recent post, dating from at least August

1962,

has been as number two man

â¢ in the Tourism Institute

(INIT). He is said to be an ardent Marxist-Leninist, who

preaches it at every opportunity. (UPI 63, 6 December, UN-

in mid-September when a guerrilla force ambushed a militia

unit and killed 1l militiamen.

The guerrilla forces lost 18

men, including Negro

guerrilla leader Andre Startabull and

three captains identified as Carlos Roca, Julio Garcia, and

After two weeks of fighting, the entire guerrilla

unit was destroyed but not until 115 other militiamen had been

killed.

to those of weapons known to have been delivered to Cuba from

Belgium in 1959 and 1960.

Similarly, in the case of the 81

In this

A clandestine source who is a civil

expert and affiliated with the Cuban Ministry of Trans-

refurbished CUBANA DC-4 with CUBANA registry number CUT-785 has

been issued a "Guiana license," presumably a license for operation

Cuban

ChargÃ© Lasalle has given two boxes of arms to leaders of the left

section of the party for use in the Catavi-Siglo mining area, ac-

The

that section and who is apparently trusted by Lasalle, was given

this information by a Bolivian labor leader who added

that he

Lasalle's house in La Paz. (CIA DD/P La Paz, IN 76093, 8 December,

In return, the weapons owned by
