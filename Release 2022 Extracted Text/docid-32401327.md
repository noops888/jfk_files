DAILY SUMMARY

9 December 1963

This summary of significant information has not been coordinated
outside the Office of Current Intelligence. It does not representa
complete coverage of all current reports received, nor does time
permit the complete evaluation of all reports which are included.

CONTENTS

MILITARY -DEVELOPMENTS:

Three independent clandestine sources have reported on
the unloading of military equipment from the Soviet vessel
METALLURG BAIKOV in Havana harbor on 19 or 20 November.
(Page 1)

‘ Soviet "coastal defense rockets" now belong to Cuban Army
artillery forces, according to a recent speech by Raul
Castro; however, Soviets still appear to be involved in
the communications net which serves the cruise missile ~
system. (Page 1)

FIDEL CASTRO'S SPEECH:

In a 6-7 December speech devoted mainly to education, Cas-
tro digressed to discuss the situation resulting from Vene-
zuela's charge that the arms cache discovered on a Vene-
zuelan beach last month had come from Cuba. Castro implied
that the arms had been planted by CIA and are being used

as a pretext for new action by the "imperialists and their
lackeys" against Cuba. He expressed confidence that what-
ever the result, the Cuban revolution will not be defeated.

CUBAN INTERNAL SITUATION:
Faure Chomon Mediavilla is replacing Omar Fernandez as
} transportation minister; Major Jesus Montane Oropesa will
+ be new communications minister. (Page 3)
Heavy rainfall has apparently caused damages to military

facilities in Pinar del Rio Province and hampered travel
in Oriente Province. (Page 4)

Cuban security forces on 8 December; this may be related to
an earlier report which stated that an undetermined number
of residents of Las Villas Province fled the country from
an unknown point of embarkation. (Page 6)

MILITARY DEVELOPMENTS:

Three independent clandestine sources have reported the
unloading of military equipment from a Soviet cargo vessel,
probably the METALLURG BAIKOV, on 19 or 20 November. This
vessel was suspected of carrying a military cargo long before
its arrival in Cuba. (See Daily Summary of 12 November.) It
carried what was probably the eighth full military cargo to
arrive in Cuba since the 1962 missile crisis. One source, a
retired civil engineer whose reporting has been factual and
in most instances based on personal observation, reported that
the METALLURG BAIKOV unloaded "large quantities of arms and
military equipment" in Havana on 20 November and left the next

ei day. Another source reported that Havana longshoremen had
stated that a Soviet ship, which they did not identify, had
unloaded arms at Regla Wharf, Havana, on 20 November. A third
source, an educated Cuban of Western Kuropean extraction who
is a resident of Havana, reported that tanks were among the
equipment unloaded from a Soviet vessél that arrived in Havana
on 19 November. The three sources are probably referring to
the same shipment. If the report on the delivery of tanks is
true, this would be the second consecutive reported shipment
of armored vehicles to Cuba. The ORENBURG reportedly delivered
some 45 tanks on 23 or 24 October. (See Daily Summaries of 28
and 29 October.) It has previously been reported that another
probable military shipment, the ninth, is now en route aboard
the SLUTSK. (See Daily Summary of 3 December.) (CIA TDCS-DB-
3/658 ,289, 6 December, B M NTR
BEM)

The Soviet "coastal defense rockets" now belong to the
Cuban Army artillery forces, according to a recent speech by
Raul Castro. Cubans probably have been training in cruise
missile operations since last spring, and the rotation and

. withdrawal of some Soviet naval personnel in September suggested
that the cruise missile system was turned over to the Cubans
at that time. A Soviet communications net which probably serves
the cruise missile system remains active, however, indicating
that some degree of Soviet involvemen jnues. (CIA FBIS,

FIDEL CASTRO'S SPEECH:

Fidel Castro's speech of the night of 6-7 December was
on the occasion of the graduation of women teachers for the
literacy campaign, He devoted most of the 99 minutes to a
discussion of the development of local education in Cuba, At
one point, however, he made a moderately long digression to
discuss Venezuela and the situation raised by Venezuela's dis-
covery last month of a large cache of weapons, some of which
have been traced to Cuba,

Castro stated that, while "the imperialists and their
lackeys" charge that Cuba is promoting subversion in Vene-
zuela, rebellion and subversion cannot be promoted from with-
out, The Venezuelan revolution, he maintained, stems from
the Venezuelan people's own disgust with their government and
with its permitting the "imperialists" to plunder Venezuela's
wealth and resources, If subversion could, in fact, be promoted
from the outside, why, he asked, have all the resources of im-
perialism failed to subvert the Cuban Government? zs

Betancourt, "that miserable lackey," is trying to incite
the United States to take military action against Cuba, Castro
charged. As a pretext the Venezuelans say they have discovered
arms from Cuba on the Venezuelan coast, Castro stated.’ "Some
of the arms," he said, “are said to have borne an effaced Cuban
seal, and other arms are said to be bazookas, recoilless cannon,
mortars, But Cuban mortars perchance? No! Yankee mortars!
Yankee bazookas! Yankee recoilless cannon! Arms which we did
not manufacture; arms which we did not buy!" Castro then went
on, without specifically denying that the weapons had come from
Cuba, by implying that the CIA had obtained Cuban arms from
Cuban deserters and that it would not be difficult to plant
these weapons in Venezuela, (Here he is obviously referring
to the Belgian-made light rifles and submachineguns which have
been identified as among those shipped to Cuba in 1959 and
1960.) With respect to the US-made mortars, bazookas, and re-
coilless rifles, Castro challenged the OAS investigating com-
mittee to "investigate thoroughly," make laboratory tests,
trace the serial numbers, and then "they will be able to reach
only one conclusion: that they belong to the CIA,"

Castro then attempted to show the "brazenness" and in-
consistency of those who would use the Venezuelan arms cache
as a pretext to invade or to blockade Cuba when for more than

+} four years the very same kind of subversive activity as is
now being charged to Cuba has been perpetrated against Cuba-~
without any hemispheric attempt to punish the aggressors.

FIDEL CASTRO'S SPEECH - cont'd

“Things have changed quite a bit," Castro declared, "to
attack or to blockade Cuba now would not be easy; we can de-
fend ourselves; we are calm; we know what we have to defend

ourselves with." Then, in an implied reference to the Soviet
shipment of strategic missiles to Cuba last year, Castro de-
clared: "When we hear some of these lackeys of imperialism

talking so calmly about invading Cuba, when it has been only

one year since the October crisis, they are once more proving

us right and are once more justifying Cuba's taking defensive
measures; this talk led to the October crisis." Castro then
declared that "these men are so deceived by their own propaganda
that...they cannot conceive of what any invader would meet here."
A war against Cuba, he said, "would not end while there was a
single mercenary soldier treading on our soil."

Castro then returned briefly to his views as to how peace
can be assured in the Caribbean. "Whatever they want to dis-
cuss with Cuba," he said, "let them come and discuss honestly
with Cuba; because we have stated the indispensable prerequisites
for a peaceful atmosphere...in the Caribbean: Thus far, how-
ever, "they have answered with aggressions on top of aggressions."
This course, .he said, "is doomed to failure." (CIA FBIS Havana,
7 December, OFFICIAL USE ONLY)

CUBAN INTERNAL SITUATION:

A shake-up in the Cuban cabinet has moved Faure Chomon
Mediavilla to the post of transportation minister; he succeeds
Capt. Omar Fernandez, whose ministry was recently under attack
by Castro for alleged inefficiencies and "vices." Major Jesus
Montane Oropesa is replacing Chomon as communications minister.

Chomon, who served as Castro's first ambassador to the
Soviet Union, took over as communications minister in March
1962. He is currently a member of the National Directorate
of PURS. Fernandez, his predecessor, is reportedly moving to
an unspecified position in the Ministry of Industries under
Che Guevara,

Montane took part in the attack on the Moncada Barracks
in 1953 and followed. Castro to exile in Mexico. He took part
in the GRANMA expedition of 1956 when he was captured and im-
prisoned, After the revolution, he reportedly received only

} a minor post in the government because he had talked too much

. in prison, His most recent post, dating from at least August
1962, has been as number two man in the Tourism Institute
(INIT), He is said to be an ardent Marxist-Leninist, who
preaches it at every opportunity. (UPI 63, 6 December, UN-

A trained clandestine source who is a-civil aviation
expert with the Cuban Ministry of Transportation reports that
several minor incidents of sabotage have been discovered on
CUBANA aircraft. On 15 November a CUBANA IL-14 made a
round-trip flight from Rancho Boyeros Airport to Nueva Gerona
without a storage battery. The source comments that serious
trouble would have resulted if one engine had stopped or had
been feathered while en route. This incident may be related
to various acts of subtle sabotage against CUBANA aircraft,
such as stuffing exhaust tubes with rags or obstructing car-
buretor intakes.

In addition, the source reports that a CUBANA Britannia
aircraft was sabotaged by Algerian personnel during a recent
flight to Algiers. The hydraulic line was fractured forcing
the crew to use manual controls to lower the landing gear for
a stop in Madrid. (CIA IN 75941, 8 December,

Press dispatches from Mexico City report that a leader

of the Revolutionary Students Directorate (DRE) announced
that 126 Cuban militiamen had been killed in a clash with
guerrillas 12 miles south of Sancti Spiritus, Las Villas
Province. Angel Gonzales said that “belated underground
reports just received" indicated that the clash took place
in mid-September when a guerrilla force ambushed a militia
unit and killed 11 militiamen, The guerrilla forces lost 18
men, including Negro guerrilla leader Andre Startabull and
three captains identified as Carlos Roca, Julio Garcia, and
Sergio Perez. The Castro regime then sent 5,000 men sup-

+} ported by tanks, mortars,and helicopters to destroy the
guerrillas. After two weeks of fighting, the entire guerrilla
unit was destroyed but not until 115 other militiamen had been
killed. There is no confirmation from COMINT or other sources
of any action of the magnitude reported by the DRE. (AP-131,

} SOVIET-CUBAN RELATIONS:

Fidel Castro may have been in Moscow about 15 November
for talks with Premier Khrushchev, according to a civil

has not appeared on Cuban TV and did not meet people he ap-
parently would have met if he had been in Cuba.

There have been no reported Castro appearances around 15
November. On 7 November he ,talked with a group of students
at Havana University and on 19 November he reportedly visited
a PURS meeting in Matanzas. However, between these two
dates there is no current evidence that he appeared on Cuban
radio or TV, and Hoy carried no reports of his personal appear-—
ances in Cuba. This does not, however, rule out the possibility
that he was indeed in Cuba in mid-November. (CIA IN 75946, &

BLOC ECONOMIC RELATIONS:
————————— mn

Warsaw has assigned five merchantmen with a capacity of
44,000 tons tothe Cuban - Central American trade, according to
an announcement by Havana television, The ships, one of which
is refrigerated, will be operated by CUBALCO--the Rostock-head-
quartered joint company chartered by Poland, the GDR, Czecho-
slovakia and Cuba to carry goods between Cuba and the northern
satellites. In the words of Havana television, "the enterprise
will be responsible for guaranteeing supplies to the first
socialist country of America, thereby contributing to the
defeat of the US economic blockade against Cuba." (CIA/FBIS,

7 December , UNCLASSIFIED) 7

Soviet air defense and Cuban civil air voice communica—
tions on 7 December reflected the arrival in Cuba of a Soviet-
made AN-12. (See Daily Summary, 6 December). The following
day, Prensa Latina announced that "the Cuban air force" had
acquired a four-engine, turboprop craft with a 14,000-ton
freight capacity for use in a service between Moscow and Havana.
Prensa Latina said that the plane would be used to carry
freight between the two capitals and "three or four stops at
cities not yet announced by the Cuban consolidated aviation
enterprise."

The references to the AN-12 being acquired by the "Cuban
Air Force," followéd by statements attributed to CUBANA offi-
cials as to its future employment, raise confusion as to
whether it is to be used primarily for military or civil air
purposes. As pointed out previously, however (see Daily
Summary of 3 December), the AN-12 can be used interchangeably

} In both types of service. Its employment in bringing mili-

. tary cargoes to Cuba from the Soviet Union would be hampered,
however, by range factors which would require it to refuel
at two or more nonbloc airports between Cuba and the USSR.

At these airports the aircraft could be subject to cargo in-
spections. (USA-71, 2/D R-853-63, 7 December ,-SE=—

NON-BLOC RELATIONS:

The Moroccan foreign minister has received a three-man
Cuban "good-will" mission for the second time and the Istiqlal's
Nation claims that a resumption of formal diplomatic relations
1S imminent, according to the US Embassy in Rabat (see Daily
Summary for 29 November and 6 December). According to a semi-
official account of the meeting, which took place on 4 December,
the Cubans reasserted their desire to normalize relations and
professed a lack of hostile intentions against the Moroccan
Government--which severed formal relations after Cuban "techni-
cians" arrived in Algeria on 22 October. ‘Informed sources"
in Rabat claim that the government is considering the Cuban
demarché with "attention." The Nation explains that the Cubans
now recognize that Morocco has not been the aggressor in the
Algerian conflict and that they are "repentant" over their pre-
cipitous action in aiding Ben Bella. (Am Emb Rabat, 866, 6 De-

There is additional information on Cuban use of a DC-4
aircraft allegedly to supply Venezuelan guerrillas with weapons
through British Guiana. A clandestine source who is a civil
aviation expert and affiliated with the Cuban Ministry of Trans-—
portation reports hearing rumors to the effect that the recently
refurbished CUBANA DC-4 with CUBANA registry number CUT-785 has
been issued a "Guiana license," presumably a license for operation
in British Guiana, and has been operated by military personnel.

He adds that "it is said that clandestine flights have been made
to Venezuela."' The same source had previously reported the re-
furbishing of this plane and some others and indicated that extra
fuel tanks had been installed on them. (CIA DD/P IN 75942, 8 De-
cember,

The Cubans are reportedly involved in the serious political
crisis now under way in Bolivia, where a split between President
Paz' section of the governing party and the leftist sector led
by Vice President Lechin threatens serious civil disorder. Cuban
Chargé Lasalle has given two boxes of arms to leaders of the left
section of the party for use in the Catavi-Siglo mining area, ac-
cording to information received by a clandestine source. The
source, a medium-level member of the left section of the govern-
ing party who has excellent contact with national leaders of
that section and who is apparently trusted by Lasalle, was given
this information by a Bolivian labor leader who added that he
had personally received the arms from Lasalle. The source re-
ports that the arms are of German origin and had been stored in
Lasalle's house in La Paz. (CIA DD/P La Paz, IN 76093, 8 December,

Two unnamed Cubans are reportedly with a group of 18 members
of the Peruvian Army of National Liberation (ELN) who are cur-
rently hiding in Bolivia, according to a usually reliable medium-
level member of the Peruvian Movement of the Revolutionary Left
(MIR) who is in regular contact with MIR leaders, The members
of the ELN may have been returning from training in Cuba, since
several such groups from that movement have gone there in the
past. According to Gonzalo Fernandez Gasco, leader of the MIR,
his group will help them return to Peru by providing them with
the necessary documentation. In return, the weapons owned by

t the ELN--automatic weapons and "San Cristobal" carbines--will

: be turned over to the MIR, reportedly in accordance with an order
from Fidel Castro. Once the ELN youths are back in Peru, the MIR
will look after them and try to convert them to the cause. The
object is to eliminate the ELN as a rival force.

Possibly related to this reported plan to upgrade the MIR

is a report from the same source that Fernandez said on 6 December
that Castro recently sent money to the MIR leaders and offered

to train more of its members in Cuba. Fernandez said that in the
future, groups of MIR members will go alternatively to North Korea
and to Cuba for guerrilla warfare training. (CIA Lima TDCS-3/566 , —
