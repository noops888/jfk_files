1. Mrs. Lilian SLOBODA was interviewed in Halifax on' 19 March
1963, by a member of the British Security Service.

2. Mrs. SLOBODA gives the impression of being a rather quiet,
nervous and not very intelligent north country woman, ill-equipped to
grapple with the upheaval of the past two years. At the outset I told
her that I was not a police officer but a member of the War Office in
London concerned with security matters and in this connection there were
a few questions I wished to ask her. However, she was under no obliga-
tion to answer any questions or indeed to be interviewed at all, but
should she agree to answer my questions then she should bear in mind that
the contents of our interview must not be discussed with anyone else at
any time. She said that she was quite prepared to be interviewed al-
though she did not think that she had any information of value to us. I
should mention here that at the beginning she was obviously very nervous
and reticent, then for a period she seemed much more self-assured, and
towards the end of the interview, when one or two rather delicate matters
were raised she became somewhat distressed, flushed and uncertain of her-
self. Before recording what she had to say I feel bound to make the re-
servation that I do not believe she told me the whole truth and that I do
not consider that she is quite so guileless as the impression she gave me
at the beginning of the interview led me to believe. In brief, she may
not be very intelligent, but she has lots of native cunning.

3. She supplied the following answers to the questions put by me
on the basis of the questionnaire received from CIA.

A. Under what circumstances was she permitted to return to
England? Does she plan to return to the U.S.S.R.?

Her object in returning to this country from the U.S.S.R. in
March 1962 was to take a holiday which, she said, she felt she
badly needed. It was obvious from what Mrs. SLOBODA had to say
that she had found life in Lvov very difficult, largely because
of her lack of Russian, and the fact that her husband's: parents
were living in the same apartment. After discussing the matter
with her husband she first applied for an exit visa in August 1961
and she admitted that the Russian Intelligence Officer responsible
for her husband's resettlement asked her more than once why she
wished to leave her husband in Russia and return home to England.
The resettlement officer implored her husband to bring pressure
to bear on her on the grounds that her husband was now living in
Russia:. and that it was up to her to knuckle down and become
"acclimatised" and stay by his side rather than to return to the
U.K. However, in the end her persistence won the day and after

depositing her passport with the authorities in Lvov she
received it back again in March 1962 with an exit visa stamped
therein. She wished to take not only her small daughter but
also her second son with her and on arrival in Moscow from Lvov
by Aeroflot she visited the British Embassy to discuss the status
of the son in question, Victor Edwin, born in 1956 in the U.S.A.

Her husband accompanied her to Moscow and made the arrangements
for her departure; she did not mention any meetings with any U.S.
officials in Moscow.

Before leaving Lvov she was presented with 50 roubles by the
resettlement officer with which to buy a present for her mother
in the U.K. and she was advised to contact the Soviet Embassy in
London regarding arrangements for her return trip to Russiavat
the conclusion of her holiday; her passport was validated for ninety
days. Mrs. SLOBODA, when interviewed on 19th March, said that she
is now desirous of returning to the U.S.S.R. She indicated that
whilst in this country she had taken stock of her position and felt
duty bound to return to her children. She considered it unlikely
that the Russians would be prepared to allow all three children to
leave the U.S.SR and thus she felt that the only alternative was
for her to return there. In this connection she had recently re-
ceived a telegram from her husband saying that he was planning to
despatch the eldest child, David, born in the U.K. in 1953, to
Halifax, but she had sent a telegram in reply telling her husband
to abandon this plan as she herself proposed to return to Russia
in the near futuge. Mrs. SLOBODA was questioned about her motives
for sending this telegram, seeing that her husband appeared to have
made a decision to return the British born son to this country and
bearing in mind that Mrs. SLOBODA herself had indicated her dis-
pleasure at the fact that this particular son (who was at boarding
school and who now spoke fluent Russian) gave every appearance of
growing away from the family and becoming a Young Communist. She
averred that she was still very much in love with her husband. She
did not seem to envisage any difficulty in obtaining the assistance
of the Soviet Consulate in London to return to the U.S.S.R, and she
expects the Consulate to provide her with the necessary passages
when requested to do so; she added that she had received an assurance
about the availability of free passages from 'Anton'.

B. Was she recruited by Soviet Bloc Intelligence? If so,’
What type of assignments, training, pay, methods of

communication did she receive?

Mrs. SLOBODA denied that she was approached by Soviet
Intelligence at any stage of her stay in the U.S.S5R., let
alone recruited by them. On her arrival in the U.S.S.R. at
Leningrad she was met by her husband who introduced her to
the R.I.S, resettlement officer referred to above. This
official arranged for her to stay a few days before making .
arrangements for her journey to Lvov. The name of the re-
settlement officer was given by Mrs. SLOBODA as ‘Anton' and
. she said that he is between 45 and 50 years of age. She said
| that all the arrangements for her trip to Leningrad were made
| by the Soviet Consulate in London whom she had approached after
. receiving a letter from her husband in Russie. The Soviet Consul
himself handled her affairs in a courteous and kind manner. The
Russians paid all her expenses for the trip and in addition
shipped her furniture. She maintained that on arrival at Leningrad
j she was subjected to no security interrogation or interview pro-
Hi cedures by the Soviet authorities and that the only person con-
nected with Soviet Intelligence whom she met during her stay in
the U.S.S.R. was the Anton referred to above. Furthermore, she
maintained that the R.I.S. had attached.no conditions (involving
intelligence activities in this Scamande to the granting of per-
mission to return hene.

| C. Before SLOBODA defected, did he reveal his intentions to
anyone? Was his decision influenced by Commnist literature,
i contacts with Soviet Bloc emigres, Soviet Bloc Intelligence agents,
or by personal difficulties? With whom aid SLOBODA associate prior

to defection who may have influenced or arranged his defection?

Mrs. SLOBODA maintained that at no stage prior to his defection
did her husband give her the slightest hint or indication of his
plans to defect. On the day in question he went off to work dressed |
in civilian clothes in the normal way and quite simply, did not come i
back at the normal hour. Later however, he telephoned from East
Berlin to inform his wife that he would not be home that night but
would see her again soon and that in no circumstances was she to
worry. A day or so prior to these events SLOBODA had received his
army pay and had handed over the usual amount of housekeeping to
his wife. A day or so after receiving the telephone call Mrs.
SLOBODA received a postcard saying in effect "don't worry, I will
write again soon", and she seemed to think that the postcard bore

NW 64954 Docld:34517475 Page 4


a@ Berlin postmark. She said his car was found abandoned near
Cologne. Mrs. SLOBODA said she knew nothing about her husband
having had any contact with any Russians in Germany at any time
prior to his defection. She indicated that she had been closely
questioned about this matter by the American authorities in
Frankfurt when her husband's defection had been reported to them.
She said that her husband worked as a "plain clothes" man in the
U.S. Army Military Intelligence group based in Frankfurt. He
never sought to discuss his work with her but he seemed to enjoy
it and it used to involve a certain amount of travelling. Mrs.
SLOBODA s@id that whilst relations between her and her husband
were normal as at the time of his defection, there had been a
number of disputes over money. It seemed that SLOBODA, contrary
to army regulations, had taken to visiting night clubs and cabarets
in Frankfurt and also to gambling. All this had led him to in-
curring substantial debts and in this connection Mrs. SLOBODA said
that at the time her husband was in debt to the extent of $4,000,
a fact which he feared would in time reach the ears of the military
authorities and result in him being court martialled. Mrs. SLOBODA
hinted that she had had more than her share of financial worries
whilst they were living in Germany. She said that life as a sol-
dier's wife in the U.S.A. had been extremely pleasant and that
both her husband and herself had more than once cursed the day
when they had been posted to Germany. Mrs. SLOBODA said that she
did not know why her husband decided to defect but agreed that his
state of indebtedness had been playing on his mind for some time.
(Incidentally Michael SLOBODA, brother of Vladimir, stated in
October 1960 that he knéw his brother to be heavily in debt due to
gambling and that on one occasion Vladimir SLOBODA had remarked
cryptically' "I don't want to go, but I must".) Mrs. SLOBODA in-
dicated that her husband had been out on gambling excursions for
many months prior to his actual defection.

D. Details of her travel arrangements immediately prior to her
departure from England for U.S.S.R., and details of her trip
from England to ultimate destination in U.S.S.R.
See (A) above.

E. What Soviet Bieg-Intelligence and pro} da exploitation of
SLOBODA and Mrs. SLOBODA were made? What type of questions;

nature and extent of information did they furnish? How many
and in what type of propaganda progress were they involved

and what were their themes?

Mrs. SLOBODA said that during her time in the USSR her femily

were troubled by propaganda workers on one occasion only. A
Soviet journalist sought to interview her to find out how she
felt about living in the U.S.S.R.; in fact the reporter was
handled by her husband.

F. What methods of indoctrination in the Communist ideology
were used while she was in U.S.S.R.?

None.

G. What is her opinion of SLOBODA's present attitude towards

Communism? What is SLOBODA's present mental attitude to-
wards the United States?

Mrs. SLOBODA sflgd that her husband did not discuss political
matters with her but that he appeared to like his job as a trans-
lator/librarian at the Polytechnic Institute in Lvov. Additionally

he appreciated living in close proximity to his own father and mother.
The authorities had provided a three-roomed flat and SLOBODA's income

was in excess of 300 roubles a month which was quite good by local

standards. The eldest boy attended a boarding school and he now spoke
fluent Russian and correspondingly, little English. In short, SLOBODA

seemed quite content with his present lot but Mrs. SLOBODA said she
did not know what her husband thought about the United States. She

repeatedly asserted that her husband had not only been reticent about
his plans to defect, but refrained from discussing any of his experi-
ences in Soviet hands prior to her arrival at Leningrad. Mrs. SLOBODA
did not seem to think that such reticence as between man and wife was

at all unusual!

H. What is SLOBODA doing now to include employment, political

activities, names and descriptions of persons with whom he is
in contact?

See (G) above.

I. Is or was SLOBODA connected or associated in any way with
Tadeusz LIPSKIZ Did LIPSKT know about SLOBODA's defection

pians?

At first Mrs. SLOBODA denied all knowledge of Tadeusz LIPSKI
but later said she thought that he must have been the person re-
sponsible for encouraging her husband to consider joining the U.S.
Army. Mrs. SLOBODA recalls that LIPSKI called on them in Frankfurt
on his arrival in Germany. Mrs. SLOBODA said she thought LIPSKI
was a Ukrainian who had been with her husband in the U.K, as.a D.P.
after the war. LIPSKI continued to see the SLOBODA family from

She did not see LIPSKI after her husband's defection. She is there
fore unable to say whether or not LIPSKI knew anything about her

husbfigd's plans in this connection.

J. Where are the SLOBODA children in U.S.S.R. ? What school |

are they attending ? Are they being given any type of 7
political indoctrination ? :

Two of the SLOBODA children are at present with their father
in Lvov. The eldest goes to the International boarding school
in Lvov whilst the second son (born in America) attends day
school. The third child was too young attend school in Russia
and is now in England with her mother.

K. What knowledge does she have of other Americans in U.S.S.R.?
Identity of any U.S. citizens contacted by SLOBODA since his

arrival in U.S.S5.R. i

Mrs. SLOBODA said that she travelled from Moscow to London
with the wife of an American citizen but she claimed to be unable
to recall the name of this person, even though at the time she
did agree to write to the woman concerned and took details of her
address in America. This woman also came from Lvov. She had to
wait seven months for an exit visa and did not propose to return i
to the U.S.S.R. Her husband was an electrical engineer and possi- : !
bly of emigre stock. Mrs. SLOBODA said she understood he was a 1
U.S. citizen in much the same boat as her husband.

L. How was communication established with her husband before
she went to U.S.S.R. and persons in England while she was
in U.S.S.R.? Did she notice any type of censorship?

In the first place her husband wrote to her from the U.S.S.R.
and she had experienced no difficulty in sending letters from Lvov
to her family in the U.K. or indeed subsequently receiving letters
from her husband, even though the mail was sometimes subject to de-
lays which might imply that censorship was taking place:

M. Has she contacted any US. military personnel since leaving
the U.S.S.R?_ Request full details of affirmative.

She has made no contact with any U.S. military personnel since
leaving the U.S.S.R. Her last contact with the American Military
was in Germany in 1960 and she recalled in particular the many
Kindnesses she then received at the hands of the U.S. Red Cross H
who were of great assistance to her in her hour of need, and who

in particular raised sufficient funds to clear all outstanding
SLOBODA family liabilities in Germany.

4. CONCLUSION

On the basis of my interview, which lasted upwards of two 1
hours, I found it impossible to make up my mind about Mrs. SLOBODA.
She is difficult to talk to and the conditions under which we met
in Halifax police station were by no means ideal. Whilst it is
possible that she has withheld information which might incriminate
her as an accessory before the fact of her husband's defection I
came across nothing in my interview with her to suggest that she
has. been recruited by the R.I.S. or that her husband was at all
forthcoming with her when they were reunited in the Soviet Union
as to the reasons and the method of defection.

A When it was suggested to her that it might be found desirable
l to see her again, and that it might be more convenient for such an
| interview to be conducted in London, her reaction was unexpectedly
1 sharp and adverse. With a flushed face, she said that she did not see
‘ (Way, and indicated her marked reluctance to take part in such an exer-
eise without, however, being able to adduce any particularly good rea-
son for being so reluctant. She also seemed to be taken aback when she
was asked what she would be saying to the Russians should they question
her on her return to the U.S.S.R. about possible approaches from U.K.
intelligence agencies. The question seemed to take her completely by !
surprise as though such a possibility had not occurred to her up to that
moment. Eventually she mumbled that she did not know. She was there-
fore briefed to deny having had any such contacts and to limit hereelf
to statements that of course she had been interviewed in the normal way
by the local police, as well as by the Press. She was asked to advise
us - through the Halifax Police - if she did decide to proceed with her
i plan to go back to Russia, and she reluctantly agreed to do so. Before
1 she left, I offered her 5/ - to meet the taxi fare to her home, and this
she gladly accepted. He
