MEMORANDUM FOR THE HONORABLE DEANNE SIEMER, GENERAL COUNSEL,
DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE

SUBJECT: Pending Congressional Requests

REFERENCES: (a) 15 December 1977 letter from Senator George
McGovern to Secretary of Defense

(b) Undated letter received on 20 December 1977
from Congressman Louis Stokes to Director, NSA

(c) 16 December 1977 letter from Mr. Ira Nordlicht
to the Honorable Deanne Siemer

1. Referenced letters iterating requests for information
from the National Security Agency present two common issues:
namely, whether signals intelligence information is to be pro-
vided to Congressional Committees which exercise no traditional
oversight over intelligence matters; and, if it is to be provided,
how it is to be done. NSA Charter legislation, now in draft form,.
would obligate the Director to keep the Committees of the Congress,
having jurisdiction over the Agency, fully and currently informed
of the Agency's activities. Provision of information to other
committees would be responsive to policy developed within the
community.

2... We anticipate that requests for information, as illus-
trated by the three referenced letters, will continue to increase
and can present difficulties in maintaining good relations with
the Congress. While this Agency has been fully responsive to
the needs of the Intelligence, Armed Services, and Appropriations
Committees, we have treated requests: for information by other
committees on a purely’ case-by-case basis. Several times during’
the past two years, Committees-of the Congress which do not have
jurisdiction for intelligence’ oversight have approached NSA
directly for foreign signals intelligence information. In each
case it has been our understanding that the SIGINT information
NSA has provided to the requesting committee is being used as
background information in assisting that committee in formulating.
U.S. policy matters. On these infrequent occasions, NSA has
responded directly to the requesting committee providing either
access to SIGINT product or briefings, as required.

3. Regarding these three specific requests, inclosed for
your information is a summary of NSA's contacts with Senator
McGovern's Subcommittee, on International Operations. As indi-
cated in the summary ‘and as discussed previously with Mr. Andrews
of your staff, we have not shown nor discussed any material with
Senator McGovern's staff representative pending the drafting of
an approved memorandum of understanding by your office and the
execution of such an MOU between the Executive Branch and the
Senator. &

4. In his letter received by NSA on 20 December, Representa—
tive Louis Stokes, Chairman of the House Select Committee on
Assassinations, requested certain information from NSA relating
to the Cuban intelligence network during the period 1959 - 1964.
Chairman Stokes also certified that access to any NSA material
would be restricted to those staff members with a TOP SECRET
security clearance; access to NSA material, of course, requires
indoctrination for SI as well. No response has been made to
Chairman Stokes' correspondence pending resolution of how NSA
should deal with non-oversight committees. Once that decision
is made, we recommend that any SIGIN? information selected for
the Select Committee on Assassinations be provided only by the
DoD or DCI as part of a larger submission of data and that the
SIGINT be properly sanitized.

5. Mr. Ira Nordlicht's 16 December letter to you requeste
information from NSA on the flow of oil to South Africa and
Rhodesia. At the time of his initial telephone’ call, Mr. Nordlicht
had a TOP SECRET clearance. It is our understanding that he has
since been indoctrinated for SI/TK by DIA. While any SIGINT
pertinent to Mr. Nordlicht's request may contain unique informa-
tion, it must be emphasized that SIGINT alone may be incomplete

or misleading unless it is examined in the context of all-source
intelligence information. In this instance, after the execution

of a suitable MOU, we recommend the requested information be
furnished by ‘the DCI combining the SIGINT with other materials

/

- available to him. You may recall that earlier this year the

Senate Subcommittee on Foreign Economic Policy requested and was
provided information on Arab, foreign:investments and the lifting
and ‘sale“of Saudi and. Iranian.oil...This is the information which
was provided specifically to:Mx. Jerome Levinson, then counsel

of the Subcommittee, and which subsequently formed the basis for
a 20 June 1977 letter from Senator Frank Church, Chairman of the
Subcommittee, to the Secretary of State citing "...a substantial
discrepancy between CIA and NSA estimates of Saudi crude oil
exports in the first quarter of 1977." This charge was repeated

by Mr. Levinson in an ‘article by Seymour M. Hersh appearing
in the New York Times of December 25, 1977. Mr. Nordlicht

stated his present request is not related to the previous
inquiry. ~

6. The lack of an MOU or other agreed procedure for deali
with requests for..SIGINT from other than the three traditio
oversight committees mentioned above has severely hampered
ability to be responsive to the Congress. We urgently reco
that an agreed procedure be developed between the Executive
Legislative Branches which would set forth the terms and con
tions on which sensitive cryptologic or other intelligence
information would be provided to the non-oversight committees.
In the absence of such an agreement with both the Senate Fo
Relations Committee and the House Select Committee on Assas
tions, we cannot respond to these queries. ‘We also recoa
that your office so advise Congressman Stokes and Mr. Nor
and also determine a proper response to Senator McGovern
consistent with the President's instructions.

SUMMARY OF SUBCOMMITTEE ON INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS
OF SENATE" FOREIGN RELATIONS COMMITTEE

. DISCUSSIONS WITH NSA
MAY -- NOV 1977

On 6 May 1977, Senator George McGovern, Chairman/of the Sub-
committee on International Operations, Senate Forei Relations
Committee, sent a letter to NSA informing the Agengy of the Sub-

sie committee's pending.investigation into matters refating to (1)

the activities of intelligence agencies of fore}4n nations in

the U.S. and foreign-sponsored surveillance, harassment or intimi-
dation of private persons, and (2) efforts by/foreign interests to
influence official U.S. Government policy. e understand that a
similar letter was sent to the Secretary on/15 June.

Since that time, Mr. Michael Glennon, Legal Counsel for the
Senate Foreign Relations Committee, visitéd NSA on 15 June to
explain in more detail the scope of the Gommittee's investigation
of item (1) above: (a) whether intelligence agencies of foreign
nations are engaging in harassment, intimidation and surveillance
of foreign nationals here in the U.S.;/(b) against whom these
activities are directed; (c) who is p¢rforming these activities
on behalf of the intelligence agencieS; (ad) how often it occurs
and what form it takes; (e) where th¢se activities are. conducted;
and (f) to what extent U.S. intelligence and law enforcement
agencies may be "cooperating" with gr "“acquiesing” in this activity.
This information will, according to/Mr. Glennon, help the Com tee
evaluate the extent to which intelligence agencies of foreign
nations can conclude that their activities are condoned. He
stated that it was his intention tp talk also with the PBI, DIA,
and CIA, and we understand he has j/done so.

NSA made no substantive contribution during this visit since
Mr. Glennon did not hold an SI clearance.

On 14 September 1977, Mr. onnon requested by secure tele—
‘phone that NSA brief him on inférmation NSA may have

caer



Doc,Ref ID: 44269469. -

Mr. Glennon did not ask for information on efforts by foreign
interests to influence U.S. Gdvernment policy at this time and
no search was made for SIGINT+on this aspect of the Subcommittee's
investigation. :

&

The Director, NSA, reviewed these reports on 17 November
and said they were not to be shown to or discussed with Mr. Glennon
until the memorandum of understanding between the Executive branch
and Senator McGovern on behalf of the Subcommittee on International
Operations is executed. Mr. Glennon was so advised in late
November and again in early December. -

Although the Senate Seldct Committee on Intelligence has been
conducting a similar investigation since January 1977, they have
focused primarily on KCIA activities. None of the product records
pertaining to Mr. Glennon's request -have been provided the SSCI.

M/R: a. On 17 May 1977, the Director proposed in a memorandum
to the DCI that the DCI assume responsibility for acting as the
focal point for requests for intelligence information from any
Committee of the Congress which does not have direct oversight
responsibilities. This proposal included the recommendation
that the channel of communications for such requests should

be through a designated individual on the IC Staff and that
responses to the Congress should flow back through the same
person, providing the DCI, on behalf of the President, the oppor-
tunity to review what intelligence information is made available
to the Congress. The DCI has never responded to this memorandum.

b. Instant memo recommends that an agreed procedure be
developed between the Executive and Legislative Branches which
would set forth the terms and conditions on which sensitive
cryptologic or other intelligence information would be provided
to the non-oversight committees. It also recommends OSD GC
assume action on R/S 5507 and provides background information
on two Congressional requests (references a and c) for SIGINT
information now pending in OSD.

¢. Deadline on R/S 5507 response to Ms. Siemer extended
to 4 January per Col. Steve Harrick, ATSD(LA);, and Mr. -Bob
Andrews, OSD(GC). 7

d. Mr. Yeates, Exec DDO, and Mr. Brady, GC, concur.
