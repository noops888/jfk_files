determined that $33,500 was advanced. to him

for: travel and transportation of household

goods to and from Madrid with one trip to

Paris for he and.his family to renew their

Spanish visas. All of this advance was fully A

accounted for._However, in his accounting, Lo 7 :
one item appeared unusual.” It was an’ : piteoerieceea
fie expenditure of $1,600. for a-sensitive . i

“ operation which was approved for write-off by Mr. 4

ce Desmond’ Fitzgerald on 1 June 1966 without :
siti further accounting. : E 7 i

3. Also, we confirmed. that no other Agency advance accounts
were established for Mr. Hunt during this. period. H

4. At the beginning of his non-official cover tour, it :
was necessary to establish a bank account in his name: The
EUR Division accordingly requested we’ open an account at the Ses :
Chase, Manhattan’ Bank in Mi. Hunt's name. to receive all non-
salary payments. (Mr. Hunt“had an account at Riggs National
Bank to receive his salary and allowance payments). The fa
following deposits were made to the account during 1965. and

1968:

All of the above have been: accounted for by submission

5. We feel at this time without specific- guidelines that
further searching would be-sonewhat” fruitless. One strange ~ t :
: aspect of the non-official cover assignment in Madrid is that i barest
: all the costs were charged to the support allotment of the : ee
? EUR Division which is not normal as non-official cover people
a are usually assigned to a project. It is unusual to have a i

6.. The Office of Finance has not found operational
the $1,600 mentioned above.
Therefore, it is suggested that Mr..Karamessines be questioned

as to a project or projects to which Mr. Hufit's operational |

- expenditures if incurred would have been charged.

the company. Mr. O'Malley recalled referring various
Agency officers to Mr. Hunt for guidance: when these indi-

in feeling Mr. Hunt. had generally been less helpful on

these occasions.

organization was advertised in the yellow pages and that
Mr. Hunt could be assured of the reliability of the ser-
vices, he felt this to be a reasonable Suggestion. Mr.
O'Malley stated that during a subsequent phone call when

At. this point Nr. O'Malley was asked whether or not from
his associations with Mr. Hunt he felt Nr. Hunt was in
the habit of making glib comments which were not neces-
sarily accurate in order to pass over a subject. Mr.
O'Malley stated that. this was categorically so. He said
he was sure that Mr. Hunt had lied to hin.on a number of

filcs of Mr. Itunt ware reviowed for possible indications
of the nature. of the operational activity undertaken in

in. Madrid;“Spain, on. 26 August 1965. The costs of this

matiied PCS travel expenses and included a payment for
apartaent rental for 16; 17 and 18 August 1965 with a
payment ia the amount of $125 to Mr. F. Reid Buckley for

this purpose.

4. It was determined that -an allottee bank account
in Mr. Kunt'’s'name had been established at the Riggs
National. Bank of Washington, ~All salary and other non-
operational reimbursements were made to Hr. Himt through
starile check to this account, An.oporational account ==.

Mr. Hunt through the Chase bank account through Mr. Hunt's
operational advance subsidiary account, or 1432 account,
had Eaen made. Thore wag no record of any operational
accounts or'advances being professed through this channel.
Ny. Yale stated that this fact defined his concern, He
felt that it waa inconceivable that Mr, Hunt could havo"
indi ortake: n operational activity without somé transfer of
or. accounting for funds, fo date, no such records have
been developed. No reference to a project or projact
digrash or eperational FAN number has been located, Al
enses connected with Mr; Hunt identified to date were
charged to the Nadrid Statioa Support. A review nade of
Madrid Station record3 has not indicated any, "Developmontal

undersigned interviewed Mr. Davis Powell, currently rH
a Budget Officer on the staff of the Deputy Director 7

sion. In July 1965 a contract was writton authorizing

ment under non-official cover to Madrid, Spain. The
purpose of this interview was to dgtormino if Mr. Powell
had aay information on Mr. Hunt's activities during this

period.
2. Mr. Powall responded that from his recollection,

it was Mr. Hunt's habit to deal only with the most senioz

officer available. In this case Mr, Hunt dealt dir. ectly vol
with the then Chief of Western Europsan Division, Mr. :
Rolf Kingsley. Mr. Powell states that, in his capacity :

as Chief of Support, any activity undertaken to support - : ‘i
Mr. Hunt's assignment to Madrid was undertaken sdcond anaes
and thirdhand on receipt of instructions frow Nr. Kingsley's

office. He further stated that he was never briefed on

the purpose of Mr. Hunt's mission and could add little in
terms of speculation, Mr, Powe3l recommended that Mr.
Edvard Ryan, who was then Deputy Chief of Western European
Division, be contacted. .Mr. Powell also suggested that

33 Martha Seville os interviewed. Miss Seville was the
Executive Secretary. in Westerh European Division during the
tine that Mr. Hunt's contract was written and Miss Seville
subsequently servad in Madrid-herself. Mr. Powell under-
Stands that Miss Seville is currently assigned to the

on the David St. Joha Novels Seer

1. On the morning of 15 February 1974 Messrs.
Fredérick EVans: ané-Lawrence Howe interviewed Mr. Raymond
A. Rocca, Deputy Chief, Counter Intelligence Operations,
The purpose of the interview was to follow up on infor-
mation contained in Office of Security files which stated
the belief that individuals ia the Counter Intelligence
Operations office had knowledge of tha writing activities.
of Mr, E. Howard Hunt. This belief was a matter of record
in the files of the former Security Research Staff and wad
attributed to Mr. Paul bi dai now retired, and Mr. Edward

Sayle.

2. During this interview Mr. Roces was specifically
askad whather or not he had knowledge of the existence of
any form of official sponsorship or encouragement to Mr.
E. Howard Hunt to-writo novels to improve the image of
this Agency, Additionally, Nr. Rocca was asked whether
or not any assistance was ever requasted of the Counter
intellizence.Operstions office to be provided to Mr. Hunt E

‘or ¢ staff-had ever had any relationship fie)

3 . Hunt whatsoever. © In -responss to these questions Hee
Mz. Rocea responded:.on the record" that he has no knowledge
of any such arrangements nor at any tine was he party to any
assistance or any tr. 3 to Mr, Hunt. Mr.
Rocca stated that: eacier Section which he had been. ay
most actively concérned in the past..years-was responsible . : pi
for handling a variety of task: categorized under the area : :
of "setting the record-straight." In this sense, the "image"
mission of the office was to counter misinfornation. cur- beetcester

".. rently in tha mediaor otherwise believed to be part of an Q

effort to discredit the Agency. Mr. Rocca fasls that any
assumption that Mr. Hunt’ was engaged in any form of Agency
sponsored ‘image activity would hsve prdébably lead to the
conclusion that: it was done under the Counter Intelligence :
Operations. - However, Mr. Rocca enphatically stated that
this was not the case.



3. Mr. Rocca -was,.thoroughly candid and cooperative
during the course of this intervicw. He was unable to
suggest alternate means of attemptiag to deternine if
any official Agency sponsorship of Mr. Hunt did in fact
exist. Mr. Rocca did venture the opinion that he felt
that in all probability an official acquiescence on the.
part of senior officials might have been involved rather
thaa an official sponsorship. It was agroed. by all in
this discussion that the nature of any informal support
given to Mr. Hunt would be far more difficult to define
in the absence of any, formalized agreements.

2. Gen. Gaynor advised that his memory is not altogether clear
on the matter, and that he was "reaching," but stated that has he
reconstructs the matter: .

a. He becamé aware that Hunt, while in WH, was accomplishing
‘eady flow of spy books, and that security approval was not being re-
questcd on the manuscripts before submission to publishers. (He stated:
that this activity continued later, as he recalls it, in CI Staff, and

+ agreed with idea that the volume of writings was su(ficient to indicate

that a great of time was involved in Hunt's writing.) Gen. Gaynor advised
that he raised the issue "up front" on several occasions. ‘The reaction
he recieved to his raising the issue was that "Keep your stinking nose out
of this business." He stated that he was lead to believe thet Mr. Helms
desired to improve the image of the intelligence profession and the Agericy
and that Hunt's books were a part of-the program to do so. - He stated, that
