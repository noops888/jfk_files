COMMENTS

oy

PI, Cl-and Central Cover Staffs concur in renewal.

PI STAFF: Value of the project is primarily as
an operational support mechanism. Last year
provided 36 disseminations. Although relatively
expensive, it appears to Le worth the cost in
view of its ability to perform a variety of useful

functions.

CI STAFF: Considers project as being an extremely
valuable producer of CI/CE coverage, leads and
support to other Station operations. CI Staff
appreciates the security protlems as described and

feels that the ctation has done a fine job in being

alert to and coping with these problems.
