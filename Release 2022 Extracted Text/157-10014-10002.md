Mr. Johnaton: That is correct. Would you state briefly
your rile as Assistant to Mr. Helms?

Mr. Karamessines.. It was generally to keep abreast of
our operational projects, to review the daily cable and other
traffic for referral to Mr. Helms, and matters of particular
interest. to him, to assist him by looking after managerial
problems relating to the general administration of the
Directorate of Plans, and to act in his place when he was
away.

Mr. Johnston. Were there any other Assistant Directors

for Plans?
Mr. Karamessines. In the Deputy Directorate for Plans?
Mr. Johnsten. That is correct.
Mr. Karamessines. No.
Mr. Johnston. And did Mr. Helms have an Executive
Officer? :
Mr. Karamessines. Yes, he had one or two. But I don't

recall who they were at that time.

WARO & PAUL

‘and ‘to-refresh your memory, Lee Harry Oswald visited

Mexico City in September and early October of 1963, and CIA
surveillance there picked up the fact of his visit to the
Soviet Embassy.

And I want to show you Director Message Number 74830
of 10 October 1963. Principally I am interested in the. fact
that on the third page of that you are the authenticating
Officer. And I will give you a chance to perruse the message.

Mr. Karamessines. Actually I am the releasing officer.

Mr. Johnston. You are the releasing officer?

Mr. Karamessine. That is right. I don't know who some
of the other people here are, because their names are not
listed. The only name that has been left on here is my name
as releasing officer, right?

Mr. Johnston. Right. Then the originating unit is
what on that message?

Mr. Karamessine. WH-3, Mexico.

Mr. Johnston. What you your capacity be as reviewing
officer of that message?

Mr. Karamessines. To make sure that it wasn't violating .
any particular policies of ours, particularly since it was
dealing with a man who at least had been American, and might
still be an American. And we were taking an interest in this
fellow even though he wasn't an American. And normally we

wouldn't do that, unless there was good reason -- as there

obviously was in ‘this case, because he had been a Marine, and
¥ :

had defected, officially defected to the Soviet Union, accord-
ing to this measage in 1959.

Mr. Johnston. We are operating with a.zerax copy of the
message. But is that a copy of your signature on the third
page?

Mr. Karamessines. Yes.

Mr. Johnston. And with that is it fair to establish
that you at least read the message and knew of the activity
on the date you read the message? i

Mr, Karamessines. I read the message. And it concerns H
a Marine defector to the Soviet Union who apparently, accord- °
ing to the incoming message to which this was a response,
was trying to get in touch with some Soviets or Cubans in

Mexico. ‘That would be the extent of my interest in it at the

time. And I would have ascertained that this certainly was
a legitimate interest of the CIA in an Ameriéan, as an :
exception to the general rule.
Mr. Johnston. Do you know of any operational interest
that the CIA had in Oswald?
Mr. Karamessines. No, never at any time to my knowledge./
Mr. Johnston, Were you aware that in the fall of 1963
the CIA took an interest in the Fair Play for Cuba Committee?
Mr, Karamessines. I didn't know that.

Mr. Johnston. Were you later aware of it?

Mr. Karamessines. No, absolutely not.
Mr. Johnston. Were you knowledgeable of the CIA progarm |

operations directed against Cuba?

Mr. Karamessines. Generally, in very general terms, yes.

Mr. Johnston. And those were run by whom at the time
in the fall of 1963? 4

Mr. Karamessines. They had had the Bay of Pigs. the
previous year, right?

Mr. Johnston. No, 1961, April and May of 1961.

Mr. Karamessines. That is right, 1961. I don't know

permit me to say with assurance that the Cuban activity had
been transferred back, had been transferred to the Wi Division,
or if it continued to function as a special staff of some
kind, I don't recall. But it was one or the other.

Mr. Johnston. Was Mr. Fitzgerald the Head of the Cuban
Division?

Mr. Karamessines, He was at one time, yes, before he
became DP at one time, he was in charge, yes.

Mr. Johnston. And did he have a unit called the Special

Affairs Staff charged with Cuban operations?

Mr. Johnaten. Who had in the fall of 1963 counterintel1i
gence responsibility for Cuban matters?.

Mr. Karamessines. General Cuban:matters?

Mr. Johnston. Yes.

Mr. Karamessines. Counterintelligence, responsibility,
in a case like that, would have been an integral part of the
special Staff, with the assistance and the contribution and
the general. staff supervision of our counterintelligence Staff,'
the senior Counterintelligence Staff.

Mr. Johnston. And that would have been ==

Mr. Karamessines. Mr. Angleton's Office.

Mr. Johnston. Mr. Angleton's Office. Was the Special
Affairs Counterintelligence separate from the general '
Counterintelligence Staff?

Mr. Karamessines. I would have been. How much of it
they had, I don't know.

Mr. Johnston. Who coordinated the Special Affairs Staff
counterintelligence withe Counterintelligence Division?

Mr. Karamessines. They just coordinated directly, I
would imagine. I don't think we had an additional officer
appointed to the former coordination function. They would have
been required -- normally that would be the SOP -- to
coordinate their actions with the senior Counterintelligence

Staff.

Mr. Johnsto Waa it S0P for SAS “to inform the

Mr. Karamessines. I don't know that. I was not very
close to the whole Cuban activity. It was an activity that a
been given birth while I was abroad. And it had its disaster
in late 1961. And I was brought back in 1962 as a DDP in |
i

March. And my guess would be that it was a conscious decision |

not to involve me too closely in the remnants of the other —

activity. :
Mr. Johnston. Moving to the assassination of President

Kenney and the day of the assassination, how was the matter

and the problem and.the investigation if any, of the assassina-

tion handled immediately upon receiving word? Was there any

task force created to handle the matter?

Mr. Karamessines. I don't recall the creation of any

task force. But I do remember that because the Counterintell
gence Staff was responsible in any case for conducting our '
liaison with the other American intelligence security agencies,
especially the FBI, the Secret Service, that the Counterin-
telligence Staff was designated, to my best recollection now,
as the focal point for the receipt of requests for information
from these other agencies, and for responding to those
requests for information. And as a result of that, as far as
I can now recall, all communications going out to Secret

Service or FBI in response to requests for information were

prepared by the Counterintelligence Staff, and were either sent
directly by that Staff, or if the content warranted, they were
brought up the line for review and signature by Mr. Helms or |
myself in his absence.

Mr. Johnston. And again, just so that we are clear, when|
you refer to Counterintelligence Staff you are referring to
Mr. Angleton's operation?

Mc. Karamessines. Yes, I am.

Mr. Johnston. What about the Cuban Counterintelligence

Mr. Johnston. Yes.

Mr. Karamessines. I don't know if they were still in

answer to your question, but my assumption would be that
anything they had to contribute would have been funneled into
the Counterintelligence Staff.

Mr. Karamessines. No, I do not. There may have been,
there may have been instructions from Mr. Helms, for example,
to Mr. Fitzgerald. But I don't recall seging any such

instructions.

Mr. Johnston. Did you ever participate in meetings or

see correspondence in which Mr. Helms directed Mr. Angleton

to perform those functions for the Counterintelligence Staff?

Mr. Karamessines. No. But Mr. Angleton certainly was

performing them, and he wouldn't have stepped in to take over

the activity if Mr. Helms hadn't made it plain that that was |
the way he wanted it handled. :
Mr. Johnston. Who was Mr. J. C. King in this era? |

of the DDP. But what capacity he was serving in at that

on those matters?

Mr. Karamessines. I had explained before you came in,
I think, that I came back here in March of 1962, after the
collapse of the Cuban thing, and the changes that had taken
place, and the place was in a bit of a turmoil. And my :

"Mr. Karamessines,” My charge from ‘Mr. Helms was that in
view of the turmoil that had been taking place in the Agency,
and specifically in the DDP, that we needed more than ever to

get back to norm#él operating, in other words, to bring people

down off the chandsiiers..We had a change of guard, Mr. Bissell

had been removed, and Mr. Dulles had been removed, and Mr.
Helms had been brought in as Deputy Director for Plans. And
the idea there was that we were going to get back to basic,

classic intelligence and counterintelligence operations, and

we were going to be done with some of these high flown ventures

that just get us into trouble, some of these ridiculous things |

that had been happening prior to that time.

When I camesback my charge from Helms was, look, you
see the general running of the DDP, the day to day, normal
functioning. We have got Fitzgerald ~- I think it was
Fitzgerald -- and he will be worrying about Cuban things.

He was a senior officer, don't forget. When Mr. Helms
went up to the Deputy Director of the Agency, Mr. Fitzgerald
was selected to be the DDP, not I, even though I had been the
Deputy to Mr. Helms.

Senator Schweiker. (Now presiding)

When was that that that happened?

Mr. Karamessines. 1965.

So that my job was to get matters back to the kind of

procedures, controls and phase by phase, and step by step

: familiar with, and which had ?
functioned, I.thought;- very well all through the fifties, when
I was serving for the most part back in Headquarters most of
the time at all.

In 1959 when Mr. Bissell took over he changed a lot of

i
|
things. And controls became very loosey goosey. And I think |
i
the Agency and the Clandestine Service suffered quite a bit |

from that short but for me devastating interval in the history |
of it. if

But what Helms tried to do was get this thing back on
track. And I was supposed to help him do this. That is why

he brought me back, when my tour of duty was nearly up.

Senator Schweiker. You were excluded from the chain of

* command?

Mr. Karamessines. It was simply made clear that this
was a,Special Staff whose only job would be this, and I
didn't have to be all that concerned about it. That didn't
mean that I couldn't know what was happening there if I wanted
to know. But I had my hands absolutely full with things that
I had to deal with myself. And here‘was a very senior fello~
with a staff of his own dealing with just this special thing.
which was-an outgrowth and a result, or whatever you want to
call it, of the Cuban operations, which I knew nothing about.

Senator Schweiker. And ‘how did the White House

coordination or liaison go with that Special Affairs Section?

assassination. Do you recall the incident with Sylvia Dura,
who was the Mexican employed by the Cuban Embassy in Mexico
City?

Mr. Johnston. The Cuban Consolate, that is correct.

Do you recall that you received information that Sylv-
Dura was going to be arrested by Mexican authorities?

Mr. Karamessines. Yes, I have a recollection of that
I don't recall the circumstances, but that rings a bell, if
that is what yo.u mean. And she was going to be arrested aac

correctly, is that right?
Mr. Johnston, That is less clear, as to your account.

Mr. Karamessines. I see.

Mr. Johnston. My question is, first of all, were you

ever told or do you know whether Sylvia Dura was a contact for |
the Agency?

Mr. Karamessines. No, and I don't believe she was ever

Senator Schweiker. Let's ask the same question of
Alvarado.

Mr. Karamessines. He was that nut that you mentioned
earlier that came inand gave them a tall story which turned
out to be false.

Senator Schweiker. Was he ever an informer or source of
information?

Mr. Karamessines. The answer is no as far as anything
I aver heard from anybody.

Mr. AN Do you recall ordering Mr. Whitten to call
off the arrest of Sylvia Dura, proposed arrest of Sylvia
Dura?

Mr. Karamessines, Do I recall ordering Mr. Whitney to

call it off?

Mr. Johnston. Yes.

ry
?

Mr. Raramessines. No, I don't recall that. Are you
sure I ordered him to call off the arrest? ‘Maybe somebody
else did. I don't recall any such thing. I don't recall
anybody ordering it.

Mr. Johnston. Let me show you, then, a cable which
apparently was sent out after -- by way of background, prior
to this cable going out, Mexico City had cabled and said,
Mexican policé havevalready arrested Dura, so we can't call
off her arrest.

Mr. Karamessines. I see.

Mr. Johnston. And then this cable followed, Director
84916 of 20 November 1963,

Mr. Karanessines, Yes.

Mr. Johnston. Who originated that cable?

Mr. Karamessines. The origin of this cable -~ it looks
like it came from the Mexican Branch of the WH Division. 1
notice that the CI Staff is on distribution.

Senator Schweiker. Who was Head of the Mexican Branch?

Mr. Karamessines, I don't recall at this point.

Senator Schweiker. Wasn't David Phillips working down

at the time?

Mr. Karamessines. I don't recall. You can get that,”

C
Iam sure, very easily from the Agency. I certainly can't

recall who was in charge of the Mexican Branch at that time.

Senator Schweiker. On the structure of operations the

way that you were structured then, would the Head of the
Mexico City Branch have reported to whom under your procedures?’

Mr. Karamessines. To the Director of the Western
hemisphere Division, the Chief of the Western Hemisphere
Division, who as J. C. King. :

Mr. Johnston. And he would have reported to whom?

Mr. Karamessines. And he would have reported to Mr.
| Helms, or in his absence, to me.

Mr. Johnston. In other words, it would go to Mr. Helms
unless you were acting in this capacity?

Mr. Karamessines. That ie right; he was the DOP at that
time,

wr. Johnston. - Now, if operations were going on out of
Mexico City against Castro, would they have fallen under the

special Affairs Section, or would they have gone up the chain

of command we have just described, or would it depend?

Mr. Karamessines. It could have happened either way.
In other words, they could have been handled by the Special
Affairs Section in close coordination with the Wi Division.
because it happened to be not in the States here but over 1A
the WH Division.

Mr. Johnston. In Director 84916 which you just locked
at, it is a flash message which is of the highes priority,

is that correct?

messages getting there, correct.

Mr. Johnston. and it says, arrest of Sylvia Dura is an
extremely serious matter which could prejudice -- using the
code word which I think means United States?

Mc. Karamessines. That is right.

Mr. Johnston, -- freedom of action on entire question
of -~ another code word which means Cuban --

Mr. Karamessines. Right.

Mr. Johnston. -- responsibility. Why was the arrest of
Sylvia Dura such an extremely serious matter that it could
prejudice the US freedom of action on the question of Cuban
responsibility?

Mr. Karamessines. The only thing I can surmise here --
and this is now out of context, and 15 years later, or whenever
it is -- that while she was still there, and we had the lines
on the phone, and sle was in here job -- and maybe we had
informants, I don't know, I don't recall -- the idea was there,
maybe we would learn some more about Cuban responsibility,
possible Cuban responsibility, since this guy had been talki
to the Consulate.

Mr. Johnston. Did you discuss this matter with Mr.
Helms?

Mr. Karamessines. I haven't the faintest recollection.

I couldn't possibly answer a question like that.

Mr. Johnston. Did you discuss it with Mr. Whitten or

has not necessarily been comprehensive, but this appears to be |

y
the only flash message sent out in the course of these events

Mr. Karamessines. I would be surprised if you didn't
find others, number one. And number two, even though it is
a flash message, and I read it, 1 couldn't possibly recall with
whom I might have discussed it at the time, who brought it to
me for signature, and whether it was sent, just sent in, or
handed to me by my secretary, I don't recall the circumstances.
But it is a very natural and very proper and quite under-
standable operational message, given the great interest that
we had in what this woman might be able to tip us off to if
we could continue listening secretly to here conversations
with others. She might call Aunt Tillie living in. Guadalajara
and say, Aunt Tillie, I am going to take it on the lam here,
because I think we have been caought trying to skp the bill,
or whatever.

Now, here are the Mexicans going to arrest her. And this

kind of cut the ground out from under our feet at that point.

And what the message is saying in effect is, let's try to keep

this as quiet as possible and see what we can salvage from it.

We are also hopeful that we could get to talk to her or
interrogate her or question her ourselves, or arrange for the
FBI or Secret:Service to do it.

Mr. Johnston. And they also put to you that this

}
message indicates the existence of a question at CIA of Cuban
responsibility?

Mr. Karamessines. There was a question at that point
after the President was killed of anybody's responsibilities,
starting with the Russians, because Oswald had been a defector
to the Russians, and then going right away to the Cuban,
because_they were palsy walsy and even in touch with the Cuban
Conaulate in Mexico. :

These were natural suspicions at the time and we would
have been derelict not to have had them. What we didn't have
was the kind of evidence that would have proved one or the
other.

‘

.Mr. Johnston. And to explore the question of Cuban
responsibility, who should -have heen directed to investigate
that? :

; Mr. Karamessines. It was under investigation consta

of that. WH was doing it, and CI Staff was interested in

Mc. Karamessines. Yes. i

Mr. Johnston. And you do know the Western Hemisphere
Division was involved?

Mr. Karamessines. Right.

Mr, Johnston. But you only assume htat SAS was involved?!

Mr. Karamessines, That is right. SAS's business was
an offensive role, responsibility, to send agents -~ their
counterintelligence intelligence was a very limited thing

designed to protect their own activities against penetration,

whereas this had much wider scope. This was talking: about
some fellow who had been a Marine, and had deserted and gone
to the soviet Union, all of these things. And then when he
shows up in Mexico he is not within SAS's perameter, he is
within WH's perameter.

Mr. Johnston. Did you ever ask Mr. Helms whether SAS
had gotten involved in the investigation?

Mr. Karamessines. I don't recall asking such a question.

Mr. Johnston. Off the record a second.

a situation in which we wouldn't want the Mixican Government
or any other government to know what Sylvia Dura may have to
say about Oswald or the President's assassination, assuming
she had anything to do, we wouldn't want anybody else to know
until we had had a chance to focus on it ourselves and decide
what our Government, what position our Government was going
to take about it.

Let me put the case this way, if I may. Let us assume

that Sylvia Dura is hauled in by the Mexicans, and she says,

afternoon of the assassination an unidentified passenger landed
at the airport in Mexico City on a two engine aircraft, boarded
a Cuban aircraft bound for Havana, bypassed customs and rode in
the cockpit of the Cuban aircraft that afternoon?

Mr. Karamessines. Was I aware of that?

Mr. Johnston. Yes.

Mr. Karamessines. No, at least I have no recollection

of it. Somebody might have mentioned it at the time in

passing. What was the significance of it?

Mr. Johnston. I just wondered whether you would
attribute any significance to it.

Mr. Karamessines. No, none at all. The DGI had quite
a lot of freedom of movement, freedom of action in Mexico in
those days.

report. Let's start to that. And secondly, I didn't under-
stand you to say that it was a DGI officer that got on the
airplane, you said somebody got on the airplane and sat next
to the Cuban pilot and took off, without going through
customs.

Mr. Johnston, I am sorry, I did not tell you that they

held up the Cuban aircraft.

Mr. Karamessines. You see the difference now? You know |
the story. He gives me a couple of tidbits and then you get
excited because I am not excited, see?

Senator Schweiker, The Cuban aircraft was held up for
1700 hours to 2200 hours awaiting this passenger. That was
the information the CIA received. And the passenger arrived
on a twir engine aircraft, bypassed customes, and went into thel
Cuban airlines craft and rode in the cockpit. So he was

basically unidentified arriving under those circumstances.

on any of this would a stopped dead after the frat nane

Commission.

Mr. Karamessines. The SAS, if thqt is what you are
focusing on, SAS'a charter, if, that is what you mean, I: don't
know when they were put ints, business as SAS. .For’a long tine
it waa known as the Cuban Task Force W, that is it,:\And ‘later
they were called SAS. I don't. know when they were created,
or when they became one or the other. But I do know this,
that their responsibility was the conduct of what you might
call offensive operations against Cuba, intelligence and action
operations against Cuba. And that was their charter. |

The President was assassinated by a fellow who has some i
contact with the Fair Play Committee in Miami, and he is in

touch with the Cuban Consulate in Mexico, and he is a former

Marine. I don't see how that would tie in with SAS at all,

in the absence of some indication that there was a tieup. But
I don't see the connection at all. And therefore I don't see
why one would get concerned about SAS not having been paraded

up to appear before the Warren Commission.

And I will tell you this. My clear recollection is that
there wasn't anything that we could provide the Warren
Commission as far as we were concerned that we didn't provide,
anything we were asked for, everything we could put in.

Senator Schweiker. Well, hypothetically it was certainly

Mr. Karamessines, I suppose. . But in ay aude any,
information the Warren Conmisaion asked for, or any of the othef
agencies asked for they got, and I think the record will show
that they got in spades. I took the Warren Commission down to

the Registry of our building and explained to the Chief Justice,
{

and to several members of the Commission how it was that we

were able to report as promptly as we reported on Oswald being i

in touch with the Cuban Consulate in Mexico whenever it was,
September or October. And he couldn't understand how we could !
have gotten that report out so quickly. And I showed him how |
it is done automatically with the machines, and so forth.
Senator Schweiker. One of the Senators asked Director
Helms when he was before the Committee why he didn't provide

the Warren Commission with information about the assassination

attempts against Castro. And he said he wasn't asked. I don't’

Mr. Johnston. You were not aware of that problem at the
time?

Mr. Karamessines. I still don't consider it as a

problem, But I was not aware of it at the time as a problem

or otherwise. Any information that SAS might have had was

not locked off somewhere in another building with no allowed
access or anythijng like this. It was there, Angleton, I, the;
Director, anybody, you know, could check names -- and names
were checked against their files continually. And this guy's
name, the information on Fair Play for Cuba and all that
business that we had, I will bet you money came from SAS's
files very likely. You see what I mean? This was accessible. i
the only question you are raising is, why didn't somebody go to
the Warren Commission -- and that somebody should have been

SAS -- and tell the Warren Commission, you know, we tried to
kill Castrol a couple of years ago or last year, or whatever

it was. Isn't that what you are asking? I can't answer that

Mr. Karamessines.. I can't answer that question.

I can assure you that SAS was not being kept locked up in the |

back room somewhere, their files were not being sequestered
from the Warren Commission or anything like that, if you think
you are making a point.

Senator Schweiker. I see your point. |

Mr. Johnston. How do you!know their files weren't being
sequestered?

Mr. Karamessines. Well, I know whetnever we needed to
get a run on any Cuban name or whatever, it would have been
run through itheir files, our Central Registrar, in Division,

a check -- in other words, there would be a three or four way

check. And I remember one of the complaints at the time from

several of the people was, well, you have got to check this from

three or four different points to make sure you have covered
all the bases.
Mr. Johnston. Are you aware that at least one of their

station down there, I don't know whether they called it JNWAVE
at that time or gave it some other name. But there was a

probably, when they mounted the Cuban invasion in the Bay of

Madigan. I want to ask you'a few questions, Me.
Karamessines, about a couple of areas that are involved
tangentially with the AMLASH situation, in that they take
place in the sasze time period, the first of which is with
regard to Howard Hunt. And as you may know, the Agency had
been trying to determina for sometime what Hunt's assignment
was in Spain in 1965, And that is the first area that I want
to ask you about. And my first qudstion would be, do you
yourself know what Hunt was doing when he was assigned to
Spain?
Mr. Karamessines. Yes.
Mr. Madigan. As background I might recall for you that
he was as you know a staff employee up until June of 1965,
when he was assigned on a contract basis over to Spain, until
November of 1966, a 14 month period. And .you were Assistant
