According

to Golub,

Subject had disappeared fron the Birgitta Hospital In Vadsteny

Sweden on 20 May 1959.

Vasa stated that Golub seemed to be "In a sweat" to get information on

subjegt, but did not reveal his reason for wanting it. Vasa conjectured

that subject may be olther suspected by the Soviets of being la NATO

dispatched spy," or "a soviet recruited any who decideg to give un the

business"

Vasa added that subject might possibly be in the Soviet Inion

now, and having

been appretended, the Soviets want to determine whether he

was sent by the West, or voluntarily returned to the Motherland.

Vasa expects no additional information on Subject fron us, but 1t would be

interesting to know whether Headquarters or Stockholm files contain any

information

on subjeet.

Data cored that o a colo trim to n to the miah

police officials at the upper levelg, and regularly Invites him, VAGUS/1,

TrinI, and Helsinki Police Chief Karl Erlk Gabrielsson, separately,
