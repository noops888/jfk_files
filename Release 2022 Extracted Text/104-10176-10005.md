Since Gerald D. FAHLANGER was the last

a memorandum describing his last relationship with LI CAHIL-T and

Contact was dropped with LITANIL-T by i

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

° SUBJECT: LITAMIL-7

1. According to Gerald D. FAHLANGER.

LITAMT. -7 whn

is a iemale, was a secretary in the Mexico City PBRUMAN Embassy

for more than 30 years.

She was originaily recruited by former

Station asset LITAMIL-3 in approximately 1966-67. Although Subject

was never a very productive asset, she did provide information on

activities of the installation and individuals working therein.

approximately 1969-79, Subject was retired by the PBRUMAN Embassy,

ending her previous usefulness for the Station. In spite of her loss'

of access to the embassy, she did continue to maintain contact with

the personnel, including the ambassador, For this reason the Statior

maintained contact with her through LITAMIL-3. However, this too

was not very productive because she felt she had been treated fairly

upor retirement, and felt a certain degree of loyalty to them.

was somewhat incongruous, since she did not feel such loyalty when

she was working in the embassy.

2. Subject met FAHLANGER, as Jose (Pepe) Martin, approx-

imately six times in her home.

The last time she was told that in

view of her retirement, which resulted in the loss of access to the

embassy, our relations with her would be termina'ed. However, if

sbe reestablished contact with the personnel, or was recalled to work

part or full time, we would, of course, consider contact again. This,

of course, never happened.

3. While Subject was not paid a regular salary, she did receive

spot payments for the information she submitted. She also received

occasional small gifts at Christmas time and on her birthday.

Leinent termination das given by

the fact that she was given

legs

duties as the nonths passed, until at the very end she

did little nore than put in her time.

with the spectre of

unemployment looniag over the horlzon, LITAMIL-T vas reluctant

to take any risk that might have compromigad our sirliaiion st

LIRING.

At stake was a sizable termination paynent unich tbe

PSRUMINers vere obligated to pay her according to local

esployment regulationg.

Obulously, she would do notbing to

jeopardize il. a paysent, which arounted to approxinately

$6,000 (U.S.).

A further deterrent to her collaboration vita

the statlos,

even after her release by LIßING on 31 March,

was the LIBING arrangenent to make the tersination payuent in

three incresents,

the last to be nade at the end of April 1968.

In view of this latest developent in this operation, the

Station has terainated the veekly meetings betveen the Station

Case Officer and LITAHLY.

1.

Introduction:

During the period covered by this

report, LITANIL-T was met and debriefed on a seekly basis.

Her information was very linited and usually dealt gith interual

actlvitles of a routine nature 1n LIlING. As pointed out abore,

"BE SU, EIVIDUSE ISULALEN HES ILUE diI iNA CiE ENGI UNiAME

administrative duties.

Consequently, she lost access to

virtually everything that may have been of interest to the

Station.

The Station asked her to bring out the book of

addresses and telephone numbers which she had compiled over

the years, but she refused for fear that it yould be nissed

curing the afternoon when she was not on outy.

The stailos

then asked that she begin to copy the contents of the book a

few pages each day.

She agreed, but before she began this.

process the book disappeared, and all efforts to find 1t talled.

sne then began to complie a ney doob oi aisresses and teleppoo

numbers, which she intended to bring out, but one

of the LIBIlG

officers asked for it on the day sbe was fired.

•In the end,

the sun total of LITANILT LIRING Information during the first

three nontha of 1908 vas the identlilcation of several

photograpis of LikInù empioyees, the teuiaiive identification

of offices and rooms in LIRING (tentative because she had

not been le the second floor area since 1961, thus much of

the Identification vas fION nemory), and finally, LITAUllY

confirned telephone numbers assigned to specific LIRING

personnel and furnished telephone nubers of individuals and

compantes servicing LIBING naintenance reguirenents (dry

cleaners, pharmacy,

typewriter repairnen,.etc.). LITAMIL-Y

volunteered to provide additional infornation on LIRING to the

station provided 1t nas vithis her capability,

and after she

received her final severance payuent fron LirIng.

IInANCO: LITANILY received so salary and no taralsa-

sion bonus from the station.

3.

security:

since all contact with LItaMIl? vAs

saintained through LITAHIL3, LITAMIL-Y does not/have a Statlon

telephone number.

She does not know the true nates of any of

the Station Case Officers who handled her.

All issetings vita

her were held in her home, thus no salehouses nere used, and

BAo vas sever seen vita Case Officers in public. She had so

telephone, so no contacts vere nade uith ter by pbone! FrOn

the socurity point of vieu, the LITAMil? operation enjoyed

a long 1118, January 1961 through Maich 1968.

Taking into

account her fear and apprebension, plus the fact that she

asintained good relations with LITAMIL3, tbis record 18 all

the bore reparkable.

From the intelligence point of vien, 18

is unfortunate that der production vas so sislaal.

4. Future of the Oneration: Although for all intents

and рогровев

the LITKIlY operation has coro to an end, the

Station intenos to baintain a casual contact vith her.

It

16 very likely that she sly know nez personnel assigned to

ISRING and may be abio to furnish Iniornation on these

1nd1v1duals.

There may also be developnents in LIBING which,

on the basis of her lengthy service in LIkING, she might be

able to assess and clarily.

In vior of her intense prida,

there 1a little reason

to belleve that she will accept morey

Station it will probably be done nithout any thought of
