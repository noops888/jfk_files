2, There is lirtie question that LIRING-3 seized the opportunity, given
: hia by the sudden spperition of OROZCO on the scene to cover vis a vis bis
i__ wife a few days of nistehaving. Instead of proceedixg to Tapachule to recetve
from the FAR new cootxact iostructions in Mexico Gity (an evkvard errangemmot
to sey the least), LIRING-3 resained at the safe hovee he uses in the capital
to receive the viste (oc indicated by LIVZAT) cf Berts VIGISSER hie “regular”
mistress, Silvia DURAH (of Lea Harvey OSWALD fame) acd possibly a certein
Yolenda (vbo appears for the first tine in this operaticn sad whose phone
gumber is not in the Station reversed Mexico City telepbone directory)
Pinned down on the fact that he waa in Mexico. City during the period of 19
to 21 July, LIRING-3 admitted thet he wae but felt thst he had to tell
snother lic racher then sdait his misbehavior, This lie vas that he did not
want to appear dependant on Sergio VALDEZ in the eyes of ROWTON and co
wade bio firet meeting with OROZCO “core intriguing" by inventing the trip
to Tapachula, Yo add credence to the Tapachula story, LIRING-3 previously
asked his wife to impress ROWTON with her concern for hin, telling ROVTOS
that he had disappeared for three days without telling ker where he weat.
This che did very convincingly vith much sobbing and crying, The LIROSIN
LP which continues to experience technical difficulties now and then did not
operate properly thet day (it's recorder broke down) but, as luck vill have
1€ LIROSIH live nooitored » conversation between LIKING-3 and his wife
éuring vbich the latter rported that her tears seemed to have convinced
ROUTE tncehne setae ne thdoh CREME ed came prerty hiont eal with
LIRING-3 coacerned the mention of the alias which ROvTOS uses with LIRDHG-3
and 4 to various persons vith vhom LIRIEG-3 fe in tosch. LIFEAT coverage
had indicated, for exaple, that LIRING-3 mentioned PO/TOS in alias to
Sergio VALUEZ, Thie LIRING-3 denied, He produced om 3 Auguet 1967 a
‘written review of sll the people of foterest to ROWTOH vithwhom he has
been in contact indicating whether or not he mentioned i0-TOH's alias to
them, This review is attached to, one of ROWTOM's reports dated 9 August.

3. What happened between OROZCU, LIRING-3, Sergio VALDEZ and Raul
MORENO ie explained in detail in ROWTOH's reports forverded with this
dispatch, A few additional points should probably be made here. First of
: : all, part of the first meeting between LIRING-3 and ORCZCO at LIRIRG_3‘s
sefebouse was live-moaitored by LIROSIN when the lstter returned home from
bis regular bartending job in the early hours of the morning. LIROSIN
heard enough (his recorder vas ouce core inoperative) to basically confira
LIRING-3's report of his meeting with OROZCO to ROWTON. Secondly, neither
VALDEZ nor MEHO vere present during the night of 31 July - 1 August vheo
LIRING-3 told OROZCO that the latter was in fact a deserter from the FAR,
refusing to indicate how he knew this (ROWTON had passed LIRING-3 infornation
om OROZCO received by the Station from both LIREBEL-1 sod 2), The two sea
: arrived at LIRINS-3's apartment in the early morning hours vhen OROZCO
i had admitted everything and the do not know what promted him to tell the
truth, Thirdly, LIRIKG-3 heists that he told CROZCO nothing about his
Plastic flower business and it's contempleted use to ccver activities ia
e support of the Guatemslan rebels. According to him, (a0zCO already knew
this as vell as other details of hie dealings with the PAR. LIRING-3
presumes that OROZCO learned this from the higher-ups cf the FAR guerrilles
while in the hille. OROZCO eistakenly apparently thought that LIRING*3 was
in the actual arms procurenent business whereas bis discussions with the
FAR have been liaited up to now to the eventual transportation of FAR
acquired supplies from Northera Mexico to Gusteanle (with the PAR assuming
the responsibility of smuggling the Lies over the Guatemlen border),
LIRING-3's plestiz flower business designed to cover support activities oa
behalf of the FAR, is not, matter of fact operative yet. Thus OROZCO
was badly informed df LIRING-3'o activities. How OROZCO hoped to obtein. sras
+ from LIRING-3, had the latter been able to. deliver som: at the Cuatemslen

c broke, is a matter of conjecture,

: and LIRING-3 could beve found hims ious trosble, Judging from the
FAR's shooting habite it is a good thing in any case thet OROZCO wes not:
armed during the argument at LIRING*3's apartment the right of'31 July to

: 1 August, particularly when VALDEZ started to threatea hia, =

CONTINUATICN OF
DISPATCH

4, This Station believes that the LIRIHG-3 Operation has reached #
eritical point as a result of the O20ZCO affair. Both the Cubans and the
YAR (vis Ernesto CAPUANO Del Yeechio) have beenwtified by LIRING@3 of
OR0Z50's conduct and statements (a copy of OxCzcG's «-seage forwarded
Attachment Two vas given CAPUAHO). If the FAR {c at si interested in
LIRING-3 he vill somehow hear frem the Guatesalen guerrillas and negocisttons
concerning ares and equinem~ “til be reanped. LIP ING-7 bee not heard from
“GARCIA” sincs Juns end does not even know if the latter io in Mexico,

It ts the Station's opinion thet he probably vill hear nothing directly
from the Cubens.

5S. Headquarters will note, per ROWTOH's report dated 28 July, the
relative ease with which LIRIBG-3 clains to be obtaining a falee passport
end other identity papers. The Cubsc’s passports that LIRING-3 purchased
ia Huevo Laredo, mentioned in the same report, vere 1ssued in 1953 and 1959
and may be of marginal value, They vill nevertheless be forverded to
Headquarters together with other documentation held by the bearers of these
passports,

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

° SUBJECT: LITAMIL-7 i}

1, According to Gerald D, FAHLANGER. Kona wha
is a temaie, was a secretary in the Mexico City PBRUMAN Embassy
for more than 30 years, She was originaily regruited by former
Station asset LITAMIL-3 in approximately 1966-67. Although Subject
‘was never a very productive asset, she did provide information on
activities of the installation and individuals working therein. In
approximately 1969-79, Subject was retired by the PBRUMAN Embassy,
ending her previous usefulness for the Station. In spite of her loss!
of access to the embassy, she did continue to maintain contact with
the personnel, including the ambassador, For this reason the Station
maintained contact with her through LITAMIL-3. However, this too

. was not very productive because she felt she had been treated fairly

upor retirement, and felt a certain degree of loyalty tothem. This
‘was somewhat incongruous, since she did not feel such loyalty when
she was working in the embassy. |

2. Subject met FAHLANGER, as Jose (Pepe) Martin, approx-
imately six times in her home. The last time she was told that in
view of her retirement, which resulted in the loss of access to the
embassy, our relations with her would be terminaed. However, if
she reestablished contact with the personnel, or was recalled to work
part or fulltime, we would, of course, consider contact again. This,
of course, never happened,

- 3. While Subject was not paid a regular salary, she did receive
spot payments for the information she submitted. She also received
occasional small gifts at Christmas time and on her birthday. The

(/ LIBAG TS LYTAMLL~T
Report for the Period January through March 1968

Action Required: FYI
Beference : MEXICO CITY-5139, & April 1968

Summary: During the period of this report, LITAMIL-7
vas met oa a weekly basis. Most of the meetings with LITAMIL-7
vere conducted in the presence of LITAMIL-3, who has known
— Sony Flaca onc ie the vasy veswom woo can pressure her
into reporting information on the daily LIRING activities.
Unfortunately, LITAMIL-7 has reported only routine information,
wuch of which the Station already obtained through other moans.
Im many cases, however, her information served to suyport
informatioa the Station suspected or needed to confirm. The
following were factors that contributed to LITAMIL-7'e apathy
and reluctance to collect and report information of value.
First, there was the problem of her health. Although she
did have high blood pressure, most of her preoccupation over
this cosditica was psychouumatic. it appeared that it provided
ber with a crutch to justify her inability to service Station
requirezents. Second, and this was probably the most signifi-
cant factor behind her reluctance to collaborate fully, she
was aware of the LIRING attitude towards retention of Zoreiga
espleysss in that office. im January 1948, LIRING released
all local expleyees except LITAMIL-7, and as the uonths vent
by it became increasingly evident that it was only a matter
of time before she would be released also. Evidence of her

imminent termination tas given by the fact that she was given
less duties as the months passed, until at the very end she
did little more than put in her time. With the spectre of
unemployment looming over the horizon, LITAMIL-7 was reluctant
to take any risk that might have compromisea oer sicuaciou at
LIRING. At stake was a sizable terminatioa payment which the
PSRUMENers were obligated to pay her according to local
exployment regulations. Obviously, she vould do nothing to
jeopardize tl.s paysent, which amounted to approximately
$6,000 (U.S.). A further deterrent to her collaboration with
the Station, even after her release by LIZING om 31 March,
was the LIRING arrangezent to make the termination payment in
three increzents, the last to be made at the end of April 1968.
In view of this latest developzent in this operation, the
Station has terminated the weekly meetings between the Station
Case Officer and LITAMIL-7. t

1. Introduction: During the period covered by this
report, LITANIL-7 was met and debriefed on a weekly basis.
Her information was very limited and usually dealt with internal
activities of a routine nature in LIRING. As pointed out above,
Ber suvesvaBUrs isULmieu MeL deum ad bus cue mums auucauS
administrative duties. Consequently, she lost access to
virtually everything that may have been of interest to the
Station. The Station asked her to bring out the book of
addresses and telephone numbers which she had compiled over
the years, but she refused for fear that it would be missed
curing the afternoon vhen she was not on acuty. The Station
then asked that she begin to copy the contents of the book 2
few pages each day. She agreed, but before she began thir
process the book disappeared, and all efforts to find it failed.
She then began to compiie a new book of asdresses and teliephore
Bumbers, which she intended to bring out, but one of the LIEIZG
officers asked for it on the day she was fired. -In the end,
the sum total of LITAMIL-7 LIRING information during the first
three months of 1968 was the identification of several
of offices and rooms in LIRING (tentative because she had
mot been in the second floor area since 1$61, thus much of
the identification was from memory), and finally, LITAMIL-7
confirmed telephone numbers assigned to svecific LIRING
personnel and furnished telephone numbers of individuals and
companies servicing LIRING maintenance requirements (dry
cleaners, pharmacy, typewriter repairmen, etc.). LITAMIL-7
volunteered to provide additional information on LIRING to the
Station provided it was within her capability, and after she
received her final severance nayment from LIRING.

2. Finance: LITAMIL-7 received no salary ~ no teraina-

“tion bonus from the Station.

3. Security: Since all contact with LITAM} L-7 was
maintained through LITAMIL-3, LITAMIL-7 does not! have a Station
telephone number. She does not know the true naites of any of
the Station Case Officers who hand! ber. All meetings with
her were held in her home, thus no safehouses were used, and
she was never seen with Case Officers in public./ She had no
telephone, so no contacts were made with ker by phone.’ Fros.
the security point of view, the LITAMIL-7 operation enjoyed
a long life, January 1961 through March 1968. Tnking into
account her fear and apprehension, plus the fact! that she
maintained good relations with LITAMIL-3, this record is all
the more remarkable. From the intelligence point of view, it
is unfortunate that her production was so nininal.

4. Future of the ore

Although for all intents

and purposes the LITAHIL-7 operatiou has come to an end, the
Station intends to maintain a casual contact with her. It
is very likely that she may know new personnel assigned to
LELRING and may be able to furnish information on these u
individuals. There may also be developments in LIRING which,
on the basis of her lengthy service in LIKING, she might de

able to assess and clarify.

Since LITAMIL~7 was not a

salaried agent for the Station, the operation cost nothing
more than the iavestment of Case Officer time, and an

occasional gift of flowers.

In view of her tatense pride,

there is little reason to believe that she will accept money
in the future. If she is able to provide information to the
Station it will probably be dome without any thought of

compensation.
