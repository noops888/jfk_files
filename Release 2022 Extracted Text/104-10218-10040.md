C. Background.
LIHUFF (identity A) was founded in 1953 under the auspices of a :
grocp of Mexican bankers, industrialists, and merchants to spread the i
principles af free enterprise and private initiative. Since its founding,
the group has arranged a number of meetings and congresses designed
- to exslore the dangers of Communism (particularly in its economic
: asrezs) and hyper-nationalism. It has also financed the publication of
pamcilets, bulletins on economic matters, and books. The director of :
this procs (LIHUFE=2) received support from LIHUFF-I and the business f
firm which LIHUFF-I headed in Mexico until 31 December 1962 when this

comgany decided to give up its franchise in Mexico.

fn June 1960 LIHUFF-l1 visited the ODACID Political Counselor and
requested an ODACID contact with LIHUFF~2's organization, Subsequently,
Chie ODACLD Mexico, asked the COS, KUBARK Mexico, to explore the
possibility of giving financial help to the group headed by LIHUFF-2, In
mid-August 1962 (HMMS-2530 RYBAT), Oliver G, GALBOND advised the
Mexico Station that the group had been receiving partial financial aid
from a group of PBPRIME business corporations (solicited by Mr. Heury
HeEand, now deceased) zad that KUBARK Headquarters had also provided
some financial assistance through this channel. After the death of :

Mr, Holland, it was recommended that the funding be handled through
the Mexico Station, Specifically, this was to help pay for the publication
(Identity B). The local ODACID Chief was consulted. He replied that he
thought LIHUFF~2 was one of the few economists in Mexico fighting
Communism, The ODACID Chief also said that everything possible
should be done to support the LIHUFF publication (HMMT=3023 RYBAT
1926, 30 August 1962). -

The LIHUFF organization has its offices in Mexico City, with
associated offices in Salvador and Guatemala, and working contacts in
the provinces of Mexico and in several capital cities of Latin America.

LIHUFF devotes its efforts to selling the free enterprise system as
an economic way of life and in defending at every turn individual liberty
or freedom. In Mexico this type of organization is rather unique, as the
trend in Mexico is towards more government intervention.

LIHUFF maintains an excellent library of source materials on
economice and free enterprise, which is open to interested researchers.
LIHUFF publishes regularly a considerable amount of materials,
including the monthly publication (Identity B), See Enclosure 5 for
samples of LIHUFF publications.

The group is extremely active in the student field, in the provinces
as well as in the capital. It supports student publicati has organized
a national student group (Identity C); and engages in militant student
political action.

LIHUFF also prepares and sends out to provincial newspapers
editorials featuring anti-Communist themes. In the last four years
LIHUFF has collected 65 loose-leaf binders filled with editorial clips
authored in the LIHUFF office. LIHUFF also sponsors a training course
at which interested groups (of 15 to 20 persons) are indoctrinated,

LIHUFF-2, Director of LIHUFF, has shown complete dedication

to his program, The members of LIHUFF, especially the students,
have demonstrated courage and competence in a variety of operations.

D. Operational Assets.

LIHUFF-1 is a 47 year old PBPRIME businessman who acts asa

SECRET/KAPOK

cut-out and operational adviser to LIHUFF~2, the Director of the group.
LIHUFF-1 worked for KUBARK in Panama from 1947 until April 1949
when he returned to Mexico. He was in contact socially with members
of the Mexico Station and in November 1962 was hired for the above
work, Biographical data is being forwarded via separate dispatch. He
is contacted by Willard C, CURTIS or Michael C, CHOADEN. Training
is not required since LIHUFF-1 has been in intelligence work from his
service with PBPRIME military intelligence during WWII. He was
engaged to work for PBPRIME military intelligence in Mexico until
recently. He knows that he is working for KUBARK. HMMW-11040 of
25 October 192 granted OA for LIHUFF-1.

LIHUFF-2 is a 46 year old Mexican lawyer. He is also a well known
economist who directs an economic research organization in Mexico and
other Latin American countries, He is met by LIHUFF-l. LIHUFF-2
probably suspects that funds may come to him from ODYOKE; however,
cover used is that the money is from private basiness groups. He was
granted an OA on 26 October 1962 (HMMW-~11089 of 9 November 1962).

2, Mechanisms

a. The principal officers of the Identity A group are listed in
Appendix I (separate cover enclosure No. 3), Other details of the
organization are included in C, Background above.

b, The LIHUFF organization frequently and regularly makes
prees placements in all of Mexico City's leading newspapers. Its
editorial features are also regularly accepted by provincial publications,
Radio and television placement is on an irregular basis.

(1) General propaganda and pol!
will be influenced and guidedy the Station for

(2) LIHUFF student operations have already been
utilized (often in coordination with other Station student assets).

(3) The LIHUFF editorial service for provincial news=
papers has been used by the Station,

(4) The press-placement capabilities of LIHUFF im- - -
capital city newspapers, which is considerable, has been used, This
will be taken advantage of by the Station for KUBARK purposes.

(5) LIHUFF's international connections, especially his
associated offices in Salvador and Guatemala, will be exploited.

(6) The Station will call on LIHUFF to fill research needs.

E. Security Evaluation,

The LIHUFF organization is funded through a cut-out in such a
manner that KUBARK participation is concealed, It is not connected in
any way with any other KUBARK operation.

F. Coordination,

All coordination with other PBPRIME elements will be handled by
COS Mexico as such situations arise. For the present there are none.
In the past, ODACID Chief Mexico asked COS Mexico to assist the group
-financially, Also, the operational use of LIHUFF-I was cleared with
PBPRIME military intelligence when it was learned that they also had an
interest in using him in clandestine operations, They are not using him
at the pre-ent time.

G. Costs.

1, It is requested that the following estimates be approved for use |
in the LIHUFF project for the period 1 May 1963 through 30 April 1964:

FY 1963 EY 1964
LIHUFF-1 Salary $1,000, $ 5,000, ! :
Identity publication 2,400, 12,000, !
Identity student organization 1, 60¢, 8, 000.
Total $5,000. $25,000, i t

Station Mexico proposes to pay only a portion of the LIHUFF operation. ! t
It is not intended that this partial support will make LIHUFF a completely i
controlled Station asset. It will make it responsive to Station guidance.
The organization receives funds from private groups but the Station does
not know the amounts or all the donors and it is unlikely that we will ~ i
know these exactly. The Station, however, will be alert for the future
possibility that the LIHUFF may begin to operate solely on Station funds. H
Should this occur, steps will be taken to place the organization under :

uf complete, classic control.

2. Foreign Currency.

There are no specal requirements for foreign currency.

Enclosure 4 to HMMA=
20931 (UNDER SEPARATE
COVER)
APPENDIX I

The Organization and its Director have:

a, Furnished the Mexico City Station with index cards and
summary information on some three (3) thousand Mexican Communists,
Although almost all of these Communists were already known to this
Station, the data confirms Station information and, in some cases, adds
to Station knowledge,

b. Organized a nationwide right-wing, anti-Communist and
active student organization in the nation's universities. It is called
Movimiento Universitaria Renovadora Orientacio‘’n (MURO) publishes
PUNO (Fist), a fighting anti-Communist student paper and has organized
shock brigades ready and willing to take offensive (street fighting)
action, MURO has been very active in the National University of
Mexico (UNAM); the University of Puebla and the University of
Michoacan. In the last two MURO can claim a large degree of the credit
for ousting Communist rectors at these universities.

c. Kept its publication, ESPEJO, actively attempting to counter
overwhelming odds and advantages held by pro~Marxist economists and
their teachings in Mexico, Chief ODACID believes the Director and the
organization are most useful in this regard.

d. Taught groups of students pro~capitalist, pro-free enterprise
economics ~~ a rare and much needed service in Mexico where the
Communists have taken over the field of economics in higher education,

e. Continuously published pro-PBPRIME, pro~free enterprise
and anti-Communist articles in Mexico City's leading newspapers and
in the provincial press of Mexico.

£. Attempted to spread to other Latin American countri
and to coordinate with appropriate organizations and individuals in
these countries, anti-Marxist economic theories.

&. Some examples of production from this organization are:
(1) HMMA-20947 of 14 March 1963; (2) HMMA~20306 of 3 December 1962;
(3) HMMT~3106 of 28 September 1962; (4) HMMA-~19296 of 6 July 1962;

(5) HMMA~18685 of 9 March 1962;.(6) HMMA-18678 of 6 March 1962.
