CIA-IR-23 Watch Reports of the United States Intelligence Board

I response to informal request CIA-IR-23, CIA has searched the records of the National

ntelligence Program Evaluation Staff (NIPE) for information relating to the assassination

›f President John F. Kennedy. The search encompassed the following records:

To/FROM DCI (USIB Master) 1963-1966

Action Memorandums 1963-1966

NIPE Staff Meetings with DCI October 1963-July 1964

Secretariat Summary/ USIB Agenda 1963-65

Critical Collection Priority Committee (CCPC) Minutes 1962-1964

United States Intelligence Board (USIB) Watch Reports

The search produced eight USIB Watch reports from the peniod 27 November 1965 - 27

May 1964. I have reviewed these eight documents, consisting of 14 pages, and have

narked portions of six reports as assassination records: 27 November 1963, 24 December

1963, 22 January 1964, 22, April 1964, 29 April 1964, and 20 May 1964.

Like the President's Intelligence Checklist and the President's Daily Brief, these

Jocuments cover multiple topics. I recommend that the portions of the document not

jeemed related to the Kennedy assassination be declared NBR and redacted.

Ince the six marked reports have been included for processing as assassination records,

his response is complete.
