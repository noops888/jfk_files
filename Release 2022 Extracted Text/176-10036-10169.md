10. WE ANTICIPATE THAT AT THE OUTSET OF THE COUP, UNLESS IT

“MOVES WITH LIGHTNING SWIFTNESS, THE GVN WILL REQUEST ME OR GEN

HARKINS TO USE OUR INFLUENCE TO CALL IT OFF. I BELIEVE OUR
RESPONSIBILITIES SHOULD BE THAT OUR INVLUENCE CERTAINLY COULD NOT
BE SUPERIOR TO THAT OF THE PRESIDENT WHO IS COMMANDER IN CHIEF AND

“THAT IF HE IS UNABLE TO CALL’ IT OFF, WA WOULD CERTAINLY BE UNABLE

TO DO.SO AND WOULD MERELY BE RISKING AMERICAN LIVES ATTEMPTING TO

“INTERFERE IN THIS VIETNAMESE PROBLEM. THE GOVERNMENT MIGHT REQUEST

AIRCRAFT. HELIOCOPTERS, FOR THE EVACUATION OF KEY PERSONALITIES
THAT WOULD HAVE TO BE STUDIED CLOSELY, BUT WE WOULD CERTAINLY

NOT COMMIT OUR. PLANES AND PILOTS BETWEEN THE BATTLE LINES OF THE
OPPOSING FORCES. WE SHOULD, RATHER, STATE THAT WE WOULD BE, WILLING
TO.ACT IN THIS FASHION DURING A TRUCE IN -WHICH BOTH SIDES AGREE
TO THE REMOVAL OF KEY PERSONALITIES. I BELIEVE THAT THERE WOULD
BE IMMEDIATE POLITICAL PROBLEMS IN ATTEMPTING TO TAKE THESE
PERSONALITIES TO ANOTHER NEIGHBORING COUNTRY AND PROBABLY WE WOULD
‘BE BEST SERVED IN DEPOSITING THEM IN SAIPAN WHERE THE ABSENCE OF
PRESS, COMMUNICATIONS, ETC, .WOULD ALLOW US SOME LEEWAY TO MAKE. 4
FURTHER DECISION AS’ TO THEIR’ ULTIMATE DISPOSITION. IF SENIOR
VIETNAMESE PERSONALITIES: AND’ THEIR FAMILIES REQUESTED ‘ASYLUM IN



THE EMBASSY “OR OTHER AMERICAN INSTALLATIONS, WE WOULD PROBABLY HAVE
“TO GRANT IT IN LIGHT OF OUR PREVIOUS ACTION WITH RESPECT TO TRI
QUANG. “THIS WILL UNDOUBTEDLY PRESENT LATER PROBLEWS BUT KOPE-
FULLY THE NEW GOVERNMENT MIGHT. FEEL DISPOSED TO HELP US SOLVE THIS,
PROBLEM. NATURALLY ASYLUM WOULD ‘BE GRANTED O# THE SANE SASIS aS
TRE BUDDHISTS, I.E., PHYSICAL PRESENCE AT THE EWBASSY OR OTHER
LOCATION. ;

‘L|. AS TO REQUESTS FROM THE : GENERALS, THEY MAY WELL HAVE’ NEED”
OF FUNDS At THE LAST MOMENT: WITH WHICH TO. BLY OFF POTENTIAL ~~
OPPOSITION. TO THE EXTENT THAT THESE’ FUNDS CAN BE PASSED
DISCREETLY, I BELIEVE WE SHOULD FURNISH THEM.” PROVIDED WE “ARE.
CONVINCED THAT THE PROPOSED’ COUP 1S SUFFICIENTLY YELL ORGANIZED
TO HAVE & GOOD CHANCE. OF SUCCESS. IF THEY ARE SUCCESSFUL, —
THEY WILL UNDGUBTEDLY ASK FOR PROMPT RECOGNITION aND SouE ASSURANCE
THAT NILITARY AND ECONOMIC AID WILL CONTINUE. AT NORMAL: LEVEL:
YE SHOULD BE PREPARED TO WAKE -THESE STATERENTS IF THE ISSUE
1S CLEARCUT PREDICATING OUR POSITION ON THE PRESIDENT'S STATED
DESIRE TO CONTINUE THE WAR AGAINST THE VC TO FINAL VICTORY. . VOA
WIGHT BE AN IMPORTANT MEANS OF DISSENINATIWG THIS MESSAGE. SHOULD
THE COUP FAIL, WE WILL HAVE TO PICK UP THE PIECES AS BEST WE CAN
AT THAT TIME. WE HAVE A COMMITMENT TO THE GENERALS FRON THE
AUGUST EPISOBE TO ATTEMPT TO-HELP IN THE EVACUATION OF THEIR
DEPENDENTS. “WE SHOULD TRY TO'LIVE UP TO THIS IF CONDITIONS WILL
PERNIT, AMERICAN COMPLICITY WiLL UNDOUBTEDLY BE CHARGED AND THERE!
WIGHT BE SOME ACTS TAKEN. AGAINST SPECIFIC PERSONALITIES WHICH VE
SHOULD ANTICIPATE AND.HAKE PROVISION AGAINST AS BEST ‘WE CAN.
“SHOULD THE COUP PROVE INDECISIVE AND A PROTRACTED STRUGGLE IS 1
PROGRESS, WE SHOULD PROBABLY |OFFER OUR, GOOD OFFICES TO, HELP
RESOLVE THE ISSUE’ IN THE INTEREST OF THE WAR AGAINST THE Vou,

IS OF amy"



VILL NATUF ALLY "INCUR “SOME “OPPROBIUN FROM “BOTH SIDES IN “OUR deat Ss

wEDIATOR. “HOWEVER, THIS OPPROBTUI ‘WOULD PRO3SABLY BE LESS
DISTASTEFUL THAN A DEADLOCK uxICH WOULD OPEN THE DOOR TO THE VC.
WE CONSIDER SUCH A DEADLOCK as THE LEAST LIKELY POSSIBILITY OF -

THE THREE.

12... AS REGARDS YOUR PARA ies T DG -NOT Know WHAT MORE PROOF

i BE OF FERED’ THAN THE FACT THESE HEN ARE OBVIOUSLY PREPARED Touts

RISK THEIR LIVES AND THAT THE} vant NOTHING FOR THEMSELVES. IF
1 AM ANY JUDGE OF HUMAN aaTuRE, DON’S FACE EXPRESSED OF SINCERITY :
AMD“ DETERMINATION ON THE MORNING THAT 1 SPOXE TO KIM. HEARTILY

AGREE THaT- a NISCALCULATION COULD ¥ JECPARDIZE POSITION IN SOUTHEAST

ASIA. WE ALSO RUN TRE nenbous |RYSks BY DOING NOTHING.

IF WE. WERE CONVINCED THAT “THE coup was GOING To FalLy
