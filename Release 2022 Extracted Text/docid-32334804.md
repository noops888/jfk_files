aka; PEGGY ANNE FRYE, aka, ITSMV, Albuquerque origin", contains
information that HOWARD and FRYE arrested NMSP in possession
of stolen auto, 3/29/55 armed with .38 revolver, later convicted
TTSMV; that HOWARD's sister is Mrs. GORDON MITCHELL ("MICKEY"),
whose ex-husband, GORDON MITCHELL, is an Oklahoma City Bootlegger;
that FRYE and HOWARD nave resided with 'MTCKEY" MITCHELL at
Route 2, Box 117, Choctaw, Oklahoma; that HOWARD is an
accomplished burglar in her own right and that FRYE drove the
getaway car. for one HURBIE FRANKLIN FERRIS as he fled after
peing wounded in a gun pattle, during which FERRIS killed an
Oklahoma City policeman in July, 1954. FERRIS was later
electrocuted. ©

On June 12, 1959, RUBY WHITTAKER, Clerk, USPO,
Choctaw, Oklahoma, advised SAs CHARLES F. ALDEN and JOHN J.
FLANAGAN that "MICKEY" MITCHELL had moved to 229 West Steed
Drive, Midwest, City, Oklahoma. This address was located and
spot checked with negative results. It was determined that a
neighbor of MITCHELL's was J. H. BARTELL, 209 West Steed Drive.

On June 12, 1959, SA RICHARD W. BOYD obtained from
Mr. O. L. COX, Retail Merchants Credit Association,
Oklahoma City, information that Mr. BARTELL, above, was 4
retired oil company employee; that his wife was employed at
the USAF Base, Tinker Field, Midwest City, Oklahoma, and that
the BARTELLS had been on record since 1952 as having 2 satisfactory
credit rating.

On the same date, Captain A. C. MYLER . Identification
Bureau, Oklahoma City Police Department, telephonically
informed SA ALDEN that Mr. and Mrs. BARTELL, above, had no
police record.

Mr. BARTELL was contacted by SAs ALDEN and FLANAGAN
on June 15, 1959, and agreed to watch the MITCHELL residence
for out-of-state cars and for PEGGY ANNE FRYE or the Subject.
He was shown photos of FRYE, POPE and DORIS HOWARD. He stated
that DORIS HOWARD was, at that time, residing with Mrs. MITCHELL.
Mr. BARTELL requested that nis cooperation in this matter be
kept confidential.

The above arrangement produced no information of value

City, Oklanoma, was contacted by SAs CHARLES F. ALDEN and
FRANK L. MELLOTT, at which time she was reluctant to discuss
POPE or FRYE. She stated that she feared that FRYE might be
harmed if she were present when POPE was arrested. She was
assured that every possible precaution would be taken to insure
that no harm came to FRYE or any other innocent person, upon
the arrest of POPE. She stated that she could determine the
whereabouts of FRYE and agreed to do so and inform the agents.
She stated that she last saw POPE in the Summer of 1958 in
Dallas, Texas, at which time he was in the company of one
LOUISE NORRIS. She stated she could furnish no information
concerning NORRIS. She also informed the agents that FRYE has
a sister in Dallas, Texas named MARJORIE LOFTIS. She stated
she did not know the address of LOFTIS but that her phone
number was Fleetwood 23245. She further stated that an
attorney in Pasadena, Texas named SAM HOOVER will know the
whereabouts of FRYE. She expressed doubt that HOOVER, LOFTIS or
"RUBY" would cooperate with agents in the location of FRYE or
POPE. She requested that her cooperation in this matter be
kept confidential and was assured that such would be the case.

On August 8, 1959, DORIS HOWARD telephonically
advised SA CHARLES F, ALDEN that she had telephonically
contacted MARJORIE LOFTIS in Dallas and had learned that
LOFTIS last saw FRYE four or five days previously in Dallas.
She stated she was afraid to inquire concerning POPE because
she might arouse the suspicions of LOFTIS. Further, according
to HOWARD, LOFTIS had said that FRYE had been trying to get
in touch with HOWARD but was unable to do so since she had
moved. HOWARD indicated that she arranged for FRYE to be
furnished the necessary information so that she could contact
her. She also informed the agent that FRYE has a small daughter,
DONNA, who lives in Dallas with FRYE's mother, one RUBY, last
name and address unknown, and that FRYE often visits her mother
and daughter there. She stated that she would continue her
efforts to locate FRYE and would immediately advise the agent of
any information she developed.

The following PCIs of the Oklahoma City Office, who
have wide acquaintance within the criminal element of the_Seuthwest,
were contacted, as indicated, in an effort to develop ingor- a
mation of value in this investigation but with negative j
results. They all agreed to remain alert for information
concerning POPE or FRYE and to promptly report to the Oklahoma
City Office any information coming to their attention.
