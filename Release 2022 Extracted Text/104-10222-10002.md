During the past year Mr. Christ has attempted to consolidate the large

arcas of responsibility in his Applied Physics Division which now encompasses

effort in positive audio surveillance, countermeasures, micropower and micro-

technology, und emplacement: de continues to be conscientious, responsive,

and aggressive in the management and development of these technical programs.

Further, during the past year giant strides have buen taken in the coordination

of many of these efforts with their eventual consumers. This coordination has

been atove and beyond that required by existing Agency regulationg.

His managerial talents encompass a wide range of activities and it must

be acknowledged that they are responsible in large measure for many of the

forward-looking, highly productive programs under his dircction. On occasion

his enthusiasm for some of the Division efforts tends to lead to over-acceleration

in some cases where perhaps careful reassessment would be in order. However,

his gonerally coopcrative and thoughtful exercise of initiative has resulted in

truly large steps forward in technical arcas where the cost effectiveness cannot

saved this Agency many hundreds of thousands of dollars.

Mr. Christ received a @SI for his efforts during this reporting period.

During the past year, Mr. Christ has expanded has responsibilities

for his Applied Physica Division, which now encompasses effort in positive

audiosurvellance, countermeasures, micropower-microldchirlogy, and

emplacement problema.

He continucs to be conscientious, responsive, and

aggressive in the management and development of the lechnical programs

linder his direction and supervision.

His managerial talents encompass a wide range of activitles, and it

must be acknowledged that they are responsible, in large measure, for the

forward-looking, highly productive programs under his direction.

Mis cost consciousness is best exemplified by his delailed planning and

charting of cost, time, and technical details in a variety of complex areas.

He has taken the lead in solving many involved, detailed and intriente interface

and coordination problems with virtually all other technical groups within the

Agency.

I expect a high degree of intelligence pay-off as a result of programs

under his supervision.

during a continuing period of growth and expansion in the Office of Research and

of the Radio-Physics area and has had responsibility for the tremendous growth of

a separate Audio-Physics group, both of which continue to comprise about 40% of

funds internally and reduced the costs of a number of contracts. Also, he is not one

to "rubber-stamp" approval of contractor efforts, and has called several of them

to task this year for what he considered efforts below what he felt their capabilities

• Mr. Christ has been under my direct supervision for about six months, during

a difficult period of growth, expansion, and change in the Office of Research and

Development.

tiring the process of reorganization of the Office, Mr. Christ hag

emerged as acting group leader of both the Radio-Physics and Audio Plysics arcas

of effort, which comprise about 40% of the eifort in the Physical Sciences portion of

the Office.

Considering his geographical location for the previous three jears, Mr. Christ

has done a remarkable job in organizing the Radio-Physics effort and in developing a

new effort in Audio-Physics which promises to be one of the major programs in the

Office. All of this required that he exercise considerable initiative and judgment in

the delegation of responsibility for existing projects and in the formulation and

organization of new projects with an extremely under-manned staff.

Mr. Christ was extremely imaginative, vigorous, enthusiastic, and responsive

in the performance of these difficult assignments, and demonstrated very clear

ability to manage programs and develop teamwork against these continuing and new

objectives. In the development of the organizations necessary to implement these

programs, Mr. Christ has demonstrated a high degrec of cost consciousness by.

organizing personnel of the two groups so that with a limited staft they could operate

in both programs, and by vigorously combing the country to locate the best contrac

tors to implement the program and to seek aduce as to appropriate sources for such

procurement.

the program under which TSD procures and supplies audio equipment for field use.

He is learning how to convert the intense enthusiasm. which he has at the start of a

Mr.

of men, is loyal to his suporiors, and is tochnically professional in his work.

Mr. Christ has one short coming, which in not of his own making--ho lacke

field experience only because his superiors have falt hia services were moro

needed at Headquarters. It li some times hard for him to understand the

operational aspects of things as outlined by his assiutants. To his credit it must

be said he realizes this lack of field experience and unes the advice of his men

to best advantage.

As soon as feasable he should be assigned to a responsible position at ono

SUBJECT:

Deputy Director for Science and Technology

Recommendation for Quality Step increase -

David L. Christ

1. It is recommended that Mr. David L. Christ, Chief of the

Applied Physics Division, Office of Research and Development, be

granted a Quality Step Increase from GS-16, step 6, to GS-16, step 7.

2. Mr. Christ entered on duty with the Agency on 16 November

1950. He transferred to ORD from the DD/P as a GS-16 in September,

During the past four and one half years he has assumed

increasing responsibilities and his expertly implemented and fulfilled

the objectives for which his Division was formed in the carly growth

period of the Office. Although he has performed equally as well, and

perhaps better than, many of his equivalent Division chiefs within the

Office, the supergrade 'I. O. limitation within the Office has prevented

a raise other than the Legislativs pay raises.

3. Mr. Christ is considered to be a key individual in ORD.

His energy, initiative, and enthusiasm in developing concepts and

upplying managerial talents make his services to this Orfice invaluable,

In particular, his development of audio surveillance,

micropower-
