SUBJECT 1 Evaluation of Contract Management Institute
Course

1, I attended the Contract Managoment Institute on 28 to
31 March 1967. Immodiately after thnt course I submitted ex-
tensive comments to Hr. Arthur Leach, DD/S&T coordinator for the
course, and I understand that those comments were included in
the overall recowrendations for future changes.

2. Since three nnd ono~half months have transpired since
completion of that course, details such as the names of speakers
and eubject material are a bit havy but I will repoat my overall
reortion to it for whatever benofit it might afford, The course

material was good although 1¢ could ‘have been oriented much more tj
|

toward ‘technical project managers rather than adminiatrative
officers, to the ultimate benezit of DD/S&T. Two of the speakers |
wore excellent; however, the third, who also was apparently 4
Director of the Institute was very poor both with respect to hig = 1
understanding of tho material snd bis presentation. Dr. XNennedy
of Notre Dame and the lawyor, whose name Y do not recall,

technica) investigation and management of a contract and when-
ever costs followed a nonlinear curve, most estimates becane
almost completely unpredictable, NASA and the DoD generally have,
therofore, gone from CPIF types to CPAF-type contracts; the CPAF
type ends up being simply anothor CPFF but.with the contractor
having the edvantage in the tabliahment of an award fee and
with the Governnent having no recourse to redetermination. By
reaction was simply that the DoD experience simply reaffirms my
own -- that for R&D there appears to be no good substitute for

a woll-managed CPFF-type arrangement.

puring the past year Mr. Christ has attempted to consolidate the large
arcas of responsibility in his Applicd Physics Division which now encompasses
effort if positive audio surveillance, countermeasures, micropower and micro
technology, und emplacement; He continues to be conscientious, responsive, ,
and aggrsuive in the management and development of these technical programs.
Further, during the past year giant strides have been taken in the coordination .
of many of these efforts with their eventual consumers, This coordination has
been above and beyond that required by existing Agency regulations,

His managerial talents encompass a wide range of activities and it must

be acknowledged that they are responsible in large measure for many of the
forward-looking, highly productive programs under his direction, On occasion
his enthusiasm for some of the Division efforts tends to lead to over-acceleration
in some cases where perhaps careful reassessment would be in order, However,
his generally cooperative and thoughtful exercise of initiative has resulted in

_ truly large steps forward in technical areas where the cost effectiveness cannot
yet be determined, His judicious application of other-agency funds has directly
saved this Agericy many hundreds of thousands of dollars, ;

Mr, Christ has been under my direct supervision for about cightcen months,
during a continuing period of growth and expansion in the Office of Research and
Development, During most of the past year Mr, Christ has doubled as group leader
of the Radio=Physics area and has had responsibility for the tremendous growth of
a separate Audio-Physics group, both of which continue to comprise about 40% of
the effort of the Physical Sciences portion of the Office, Mr, Christ has performed
these duties in a mangerial capacity in an extremely effective manner, so that both
groups are well developed and capable of continuing growth on a self-sustaining

basis,

Mr, Christ is extremely conscientious, receptive, and alert to the needs of

the Agency in terms of the substantive content of technical programs under his

direction and supervision, His cost consciousness is a continuing effort throughout

the year, und is best demonstrated by the manner in which he has reprogrammed

fea internally and reduced the costs of a number of contracts, Also, he is not one
"rubber-stamp" approval of contractor efforts, and has called several of them

a task this year for what he considered efforts below what he felt their capabilities

should be,

. Considéring his geographical location for the previous three years, Mr, Christ
has done a remarkable job in orgaiizing the Radio-~Physics effort and in developing a
new effort in Audio-Physics which promises to be one of the major programs in the

organization of new ‘projects with an extremely underemanned staff,
Mr, Christ was extremely imaginative, vigorous, enthusiastic, and responsive
lin the performance of these difficult assignments, and demonstrated very clear’
Jability to manage programs and develop teamwork against these continuing and new
objectives, In the development of the organizations hecessary to implement these
programs, Mr, Christ has demonstrated a high degree of cost consciousness by.
