Bureau file 92-3000, WFO file 92-81, Baltimore file 92-99.

By airtel dated 6/15/63, Baltimore had called at-
tention of the Miami Division to the fact that CHARLES A,
NORRIS, States Attorney for St. Marys County, Maryland had
peen indicted on 8/8/63 for malfeasance in office as a result
of his failure to subpoena before the Grand Jury of St. Marys
County, a pertinent witness. NORRIS was also charged with
failing to subpoena the same witness in the trial of JOSEPH
FRANCIS NESLINE, CHARLES TOURINE, and ALLEN CHARLES FISHER
on 6/18/63. It was also pointed out. that Bureau Informant
had previously indicated that "the fix" had been established
in connection with the gambling casino at the Sportsman
Club.

Deputy Sheriff BENJAMIN H, BURROUGHS had advised
that sometime subsequent-to the election of NORRIS in November,
1962 to the offijee of the States Attorney, he and a political
ally OLIVER proenien, an attorney in Leonardtown, Maryland _
had taken a trip with their wives to Miami, Florida. BURROUGHS
stated the possibility existed that if a collusion had developed
between the office of NORRIS and gamblers NESLINE and TOURINE,
this may have occurred during the week that NORRIS and GUYTHER
were vacationing in Miami.

A former associate of ALLEN CuanngseerSiian, GEORGE
AUD, Lexington Park, Maryland, had advised that whenever FISHER
visits Miami, he stays at the Treasure Island Motel In Miami.
Miami Division was therefore requested to determine. whether
NORRIS and GUYTHER were ‘at the Treasure Island Motel at the same
time that FISHER was registered there,

By airtel dated 9/3/63, Miami Division advised that
Mrs. FRANKIE CALLAHAN, Manager, Treasure Isle Motel, 1865- 79th St.
Causeway, North Bay Villa, Florida, adviséd on 6/30/63, that a
check of her records for the previous Fall months, reflected no
one by the names ALLEN CHARLES FISHER, CHARLES A NORRIS or
OLIVER R, GUYTHER had registered at this Motel.

On 9/27/63; PCI MADELINE ACTON advised SA GERARD R.

Informant, was formerly the subject of a WSTA investigation
conducted by the WFO Division wherein she received a sentence
for WSTA activities. She is also a very close associate of
subject NESLINE.

_ Informant advised that during the conference, TOURINE
and NESLINE requested their attorneys to make contact with the
States Attorney of St. Marys County, Maryland, CHARLES A, NORRIS.
Subsequently NCRRIS reportedly met with RAFT, TOURINE, NESLINE,
BAILEY and WEINER in the law offices of WEINER and BAILEY, It
was the desire of TOURINE and NESLINE to have StateS Attorney
NORRIS agree to a request of the defense at the hearing of the
appeal of TOURINE and NESLINE from their conviction of their
sentence on the gambling arrest on 6/13/63 at Charlotte Hall,
Maryland, TOURINE and NESLINE wanted to be assured that the :
States Attorney would agree to their request that when they
plead guilty, that maximum fines would be leveled and suspended jail
sentences imposed. i tea

On 9/27/63, BENJAMIN H. BURROUGHS, Jr., NA, Deputy
Sheriff of St. Marys County, Maryland advised SA LOWE that he
had learned from a close source of his, that PAUL J, BAILEY
had approached this source for the purpose of determining if
a statement could be reached by the defense and the States ‘
Attorney in connection with the appeal. BURROUGHS stated '
that BAILEY was attempting to determine if it would be agreeable i
with the County Commissioners of St. Marys County to state in
Court that maximum fines in this case would be most desirable
on the part of the St. Marys County Commissioners to assist
the. County Treasury. The chairman of the County Commissioners,
ELLIOTT BURCH, had indicated that no such statement was agreeable
with his office and in fact, his office wanted "hands off".

By airtel dated 10/23/63, WFO advised that on 10/22/63 :
WF 1108-C informed SA JOHN R. BUCKLEY, that subjects NESLINE and :

Miami indefinitely and has no current plans to return to Washington,
D.C. Informant previously advised that NESLINZ had recently
discontinued his affiliation with the numbers activities in the
Washington, D.C, area. -

On October 22, 1963, an effort by WFO Agents to con-
tact TOURINE telephonically at the Apolline Apartments, 1330
New Hampshire Avenue, N.W., Washington, D.C. resulted in the
determination that TOURINE had vacated his apartment and left
a forwarding address of 1125- 14th Street, N.W. 1125- 14th
Street, N.W. is the address for Mid City Deli, a well-known
