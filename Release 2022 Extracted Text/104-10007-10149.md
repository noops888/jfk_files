SUBJECT : ‘Suggested Graphological Assessment of OSWALD
Handwriting

1. I discussed this informally with Mr. Arthur Dooley, CI Staff,
who is knowledgeable on the OSWALD Case. Mr. Dooley mentioned that a
graphological assessment had not been done to his knowledge to determine _
if personality restructuring had been attempted on OSWALD in the USSR, © ~
Mr. Daoley questioned whether such an assessment would really make a
worthwhile or reliable contribution to the issue of OSWALD's motivation,
ond warrant the time and expense involved; that if such an assessment
was attempted in any formal sort of fashion, the "officiel" results ..
may only add confusion to the motivation issue, since such results
would not have truly scientific validity. He noted that the samples,
to his recollection, represented various environmental conditions ranging
from nomial passport applications, to condensed diary notations and notes}
that a child's handwriting changes from grade school to college as the -
speed of notetaking increases and the pressure mounts, In this case you

2. Based on his fanilarity with the case Mr. Dooley feels that
OSWALD's motivation is largely explained in terns of his neurotic background,
his failure to achieve status, and his very deep resentment to all authors: +
After his stay in the Soviet Unicon, OSHALD's writings indicate that he pee
neither society had nmch to offer; snd in effect, he rejected both. a

3. Mr. Dooley noted that undoubtedly other factors came into play tx:
formulate CSWALD's idea to assassinate the President. For example,
saw a movie on TV about en attempted presidential assassination with a rifle — |
shortly before his deed, which could have sparked him into action, As the
Warren Commission has indicated, the real motive may never be known.

4, Mr, Dooley said that the files are available for inspection by an =. 4
SB officer at any time to look for handwriting samples or any other purpose, :
of the above, he did not feel that anything could be proved for
therefore questioned the merit of the suggestion at this time.
