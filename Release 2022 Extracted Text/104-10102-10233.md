The Station copies of the original reports on SZULC have
been destroyed, I attdch, however, a memorandum consisting of

selected entries fron his cart.

2 All ‘the information ds from the seme source, a Polish emigre

“who knew SZULC personally and also had, informants in the Polish Embassy.
- There is little doubt that SZULC was pro-communist at the time,
FE . ani that he. co-operated with Ignacy SACHS, a cousin who was employed
i ‘by the Press Section'ef .the Polish Embassy, and provided him with
"information". , It would, however, be unwise. to jump to the conclusion
a . that: this collaboration took the fona of espionage, since SZULCs does

not to have made any secret of the relationship.

i he. I éan fini no evidence that Ignacy SACHS was an intelligence

officer, but hé seems to have been an active propagandist, He returned

to Poland in 1954. A report from the same source, dated June 1956,

stated that he then occupied the Brazilian desk at the Polish Institute

for International Affairs.
