AEBURBLE

Photographic coverage of the target installations by

LIEMPTY in early 1967 aided in the identification of

an unknown Soviet intelligence officer who assisted in

the training of a double agent being handled by the

FBI.

AEGIMMICK

In early 1967 during the iniiial phases of a double

agent case. under fBl control,

the LIENPTY/LIMITED/

LICALLA photographic surveillance activities

furnished useful evidence.

The LIEPTY project verified

the agent's contact with two. Soviet officials, enabled

their identification and established the fact of their

KGB

membership.

MENORANDUN FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT:

LIENPTY Photo Surveillance Project Contribution

to Soviet Operations Program

This rather unique operation his unquestionably

made a major contribution to the increasingly effective

Sov Ops program of the Mexico Station:

On the positive

side its principal value lies in the identification of

the Mexican and third national contacts of the Soviets,

from which he must select and develop the "access

agents" so rital to our operations against the Soviet

human target.

LIEMPTY also provides us with a much

cleaner picture of inner relationships

and activity

patterns within the Soviet mission itsolf, which in

turn

facilitates effective targetting.

The CE value of

an LIEMPTY type project as a monitor, of real ind

potential agent contacts of the Soviets, is of course

obvious.

2.

It is important to note that LIEMPTY is not,

as might be the case in Stations of lesser overall

capability, a simple case of photography (or observation)

for the record.

Rather it is an important facet of a

concerted high priority effort to get at and recruit

individual soviets.
