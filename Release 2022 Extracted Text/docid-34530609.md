1. REPORT OF FINDINGS

Germany, APO New York 09078, was interviewed at his place of duty concerning

an incident of possible Counter-Intelligence

interest, and stated substantially

as follows:

About two or three weeks ago, just before a schedulea exchange of

warheads at C Team, Source was approached in a Datteln bar, the Stadtschaenke,

another bar in Datteln, the Lord Nelson. Source thought that Dee Jay was

only a nickname and not John's real name. John asked Source and other Americans

in the bar if they knew where some of the former members of the unit are pre-

sently stationed.

Source could recall only one name John had asked about,

Gristobal Pimentel-Davilla. John tola source "If you see Pimentel, tell him

I have the package for him." Source knew that John had called the unit that

night asking for Pimentel-bavilla.

John at one time asked Source to tell him

who the Security Sergeant of the unit was, but Source refused to answer the

question. Source descriped John as follows: Height: Six feet to six feet

one inch tall; Weight: 200-210 pounds; Age: 22-24 years old; Build: Stocky;

Hair:

Dark; Dress:

Wore furry coat and shoes, possibly camel hair. Source

had not met John before and has not seen him since and gave negative responses

to all questions posed by him.

REMARKS: Source felt that the package John mentioned that he

had for Pimentel-Davilla was probably drugs, either hashish or marijuana.

jource knew that Pimentel-Davilla used both drugs and may have been selling

them to other members of the unit.

ACENT'S NOTES: Full identification of Pimentel-Davilla was as

follows:

Pimentel-Davilla, Cristobal, SP6,JEK Act 5 (g) (2) (p)departed C Team on

20 January 1972 on a permanent change of station to Fort Eustis, Virginia.
