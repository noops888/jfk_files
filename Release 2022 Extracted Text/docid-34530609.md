‘) On 1 February 1972, Peter D. Herpst, PFC, Act 5 (vl (21 (0iClerk,

G Team, 66th USA Artillery Detachment, Datteln (108,24), Federal Republic of
Germany, APO New York 09078, was interviewed at his place of duty concerning
an incident of possible Counter-Intelligence interest, and stated substantially
as follows:

) About two or three weeks ago, just before a scheduled exchange of
warheads at C Team, Source was approached in a Datteln bar, the Stadtschaenke,
by a man who identified himself as John Dee Jay. John was the Disc Jockey at
another bar in Datteln, the Lord Nelson. Source thought that Dee Jay was

only a nickname and not John's real name. John asked Source and other Americans
in the bar if they knew where some of the former members of the unit are pre~
sently stationed. Source could recall only one name John had asked about,
Cristobal Pimentel-Davilla. John told Source "If you see Pimentel, tell him

I have the package for him." Source knew that John had called the unit that
night asking for Pimentel-Davilla. John at one time asked Source to tell him
who the Security Sergeant of the unit was, but Source refused to answer the
question. Source descriped John as follows: Height: Six feet to six feet

one inch tall; Weight: 200-210 pounds; Age: 22-2) years old; Build: Stocky;
Hair: Dark; Dress: Wore furry coat and shoes, possibly camel hair. Source
had not met John before and has not seen him since and gave negative responses
to all questions posed by hin.

REMARKS: Source felt that the package John mentioned that he
had for Pimentel-Davilla was probably drugs, either hashish or marijuana.
Source knew that Pimentel-Davilla used both drugs and may have been selling
them to Om members of the unit.

AGENT'S NOTES: Full identification of Pimentel-Davilla was as

follows:’ Pimentel-Davilla, Cristobal, SP6,:K Act 5 ic) (2) (pideparted C Team on
20 January 1972 on a permanent change of station to Fort Eustis, Virginia.
