MEMORANDUM FOR: All Divisions and Certain Staffs

FROM : Philip F. Fendig
SA/DO/O0
SUBJECT : The CIA and the Cult of Intelligence

by Victor Marchetti and John D. Marks

1. Subject book was published in 1974 with 168
deleted items demanded by CIA and involved court
trial and decision. The lawyer for the authors has,
in effect, requested that a review be made of the
168 deleted items to determine which can now be
declassified and removed from the court's injunction,
particularly in view of the official disclosures
since the publication of the book. The Department of
Justice has advised that such a review is in order.

2. Since. the courts decided the 168 deleted
items were properly classifiable and classified in
accordance with the appropriate Executive Order in
effect at the time of the initial classification,
including Executive Order 11652, the review at this
time must include two points:

(a) Is the item still classified under
Executive Order 11652,

(b) Has the item been placed in the public
domain by official disclosure by the United
States, such as by an official in the Executive
Branch authorized to declassify the item, or by
a report of a Congressional: committee, or by
the courts.

3. Each addressee is requested to appoint a
focal point officer to review each component's
respective items which are held by this office.

This office also has the DDO documentation submitted
in support of deleting each item in 1973. These can
be reviewed by each focal point official as necessary.



A review will also be needed of those items which
may have been cleared or released by CIA when
reviewing manuscripts submitted by other authors
since the publication of the Marchetti book. A
few items will need to be referred by some of the
components to other departments and agencies of
government for their review.

4. Please advise this office of the name of

“your focal point officer by COB 11 April 1977.

Hussein on

Following the disclosure that Jordan’s
King Hussein had for years taken sqeret
payments from the CIA, Newswilex’s
Arnaud dé Borchgrave flew to Amman
last week for an exclusive interview joith
the King. The result was what Hussein
called “my first and very last words?’ on
The Washington Post’s revelation of the
payments and their possible impact on
chances for peace inthe Middle Bast.
Some excerpts:

DE BORCHGRAVE: How much truth is
there in.the story that appeared in The Wash-
ington Post?

HUSSEIN: The whole thing is ridicu-
Jous and insulting, But Lam prepared to
answer questions about it.

Q. Your government spokesman said the
story was a combination of “fabrication. and
distortion.” What has been fabricated and
what has been distorted?

A. What was fabricated in the story ivas
everything about funds handed over per-
sonally for private benefit. When friend-
ly Arab, countries extend aid, it has been
traditional for the checks to he made out
to, the Head of State, which then are
deposited*in the state budget account.
4 not an uncommon practice. ‘All
assistance received by us is handled in
the same way. What is true is that for a
number of years, we have been offered
security and intellige
which the government of Jorda
ed gratefully,

As for the story that the GIA p:
the protection of my children at school
in America, my request was made to the
State Department which kindly agreed
to ensure their security. Remember that
there have heen many extremist plots
against me and my family and this was a
perfectly nonnal request. Tf Amy Carter
decided to come to school in’ Jordan
we would, needless'to say, be responsi-
ble for her seciirity and would not be
sending a bill to the U.S. Government
for an elementary courtesy and'security
measure.

Q. How do you fee! about President Carter
ordering the arrangement—code-named "No
Beef""—stopped?

A. We had, T promise you, never heard
anything about allthis before. I the
reference is to the stance we have
been receiving for security and intelli-
gence, then 1 have not been advised
about its suspension, either officially or
unofficially. :

__Q. The Intelligence Oversight Board set up
in February 1976 reported to President Ford'a
few months later that they regarded the pay-
‘ments as improper and he did nothing about
't, What do you feel was improper about tho:

Q. Is it your impression that the PLO is now
ready to amend its basic charter and agree to
coexist peacefully with Israel in a West Bank-

A. This is the decision they must face.
But it is equally important to know what
the Isracli position will be. Why should
the PLO take such a step unilaterally?
There must be a degree of simultane
ity—tsracl recognizes a West Bank-Gaza
Palestinian state and the Palestinians
recognize Israel. Z

Q. Is it your intention to negotiate with the
PLO prior to Geneva a new organic link be-
tween possible Palestinian state on the West
Bank and Jordan proper?

A. This has been suggested by many
leaders in the area as a possible con-
structive development and we certain-
ly plan to explore the’ possibilitie:
But I must caution vou against overopti-
mism. The resumption of the Geneva
conference by itself means nothing and
if it doesn’t produce quick results
then there will be the danger of a
letdown, of the pendulum swinging
back and the extremists coming to the
fore again.

Q. How doyou think the latest CIA story will
affect relations between Jordan and the Unit-
ed States?

A. Throughout all these years I have
been very proud of the growing strength
of the relationship with our American
friends. We identified with principles
your forefathers held dear. We built
our relations on the ba of mutual
respect, confidence and faith, and be-
yond that anything I did to cement
relations with the U.S. was based on-a
deep conviction about our common ob-
jectives—stability, peace. and progre:
in.the Middle East.

My duty is to develop my country, its
human resources, armed forces and sect-
rity and jiitelligence services, to face the
tremendous threats that lie ahead. The

road is strewn with mines to sabotage the
peace process. One has just exploded in
Washington. There will he others. But

bear in mind that Jordan is not unique in
receiving such help, Istacl falls into the
same category and is a far greater exam-
ple of all kinds of assistance. As far as T
and
very last words on that matter. My per-
sonal pride is a very touchy subject. And
my main concern is to preserve Jordan in
freedom.

you choose to denude a vital arm that is
there to protect you, that is your affair,

MEMORANDUM FOR: Executive Officer to the DDA

FROM : M. L.. Latta
Deputy Chief, Plans and Review Group
Central Cover Staff

SUBJECT : Fairways Corporation

1. Per our telephone conversation today, attorneys
for Victor Marchetti have requested release of the 168
items previously deleted by court order from the book,
The CIA and the Cult of Intelligence. Fairways Corpora-
tion was referred to CCS by the SA/DO/O for review in
this connection.

2. Fairways Corporation is the subject of four items
(107, 128, 129, 279, on pages 123, 132, 133, and 403 respec-
tively,) in the original manuscript. The position of CCS on
all four items is that they are still classified, since they
describe intelligence sources and methods by identifying an
operational support facility located in the U.S., and are
therefore exempt from declassification under Section 5(B) (2)
of the General Declassification Schedule contained in Executive
Order 11652.

3. According to CCS files, in April 1975 Director Colby
was asked by an NBC reporter about CIA sponsorship of Fair-
ways in connection with a planned TV documentary on Agency
proprietaries. CCS files are unclear on the point, but there
are indications that Director Colby may have responded to
the question in a manner which could have been construed as
admission of CIA sponsorship of Fairways. In-any case, CCS
files contain other evidence that the matter was considered
to be still classified as recently as December 1976, when
Director Bush wrote to the Administrator of the Federal
Aviation Administration regarding CIA sponsorship of Fair-
ways and asked that the subject be withheld from public
disclosure.

on the extent to which CIA sponsorship of Fairways may
have been placed in the public domain since the court
order (i.e., since February 1975).

5. Please direct your comments to SA/DO/O.. For
your information, Mr. Halpern, Room 6 D 0120, red line

3. The.following items were heretofore classified SECRET

because they described sources and methods in identifying a
support base located in the United.States, but are now con-
sidered to have been placed in the public domain.

Items 124, 126, and 127 on pages 129 and 130 --
INTERMOUNTAIN AVIATION, INC. Intermountain Aviation,
Inc. is named as an Agency proprietary in Book I of
the Senate Select Committee Final Report, pp. 208-9,
and in the Report of the Rockefeller Commission on
CIA Activities Within the United States, pg. 218.

4. The following items fall into the questionable area

as to whether they have been placed in the public domain by
authorized Government officials:

a. Item 49, page 7la -- ROME DAILY AMERICAN.
Classified SECRET because it describes intelligence
sources and methods as related to several newspaper.
publications. . However, CCS files contain a newsclip
from the September and October 1974 edition of the
Columbia Journalism Review which states, "Landon K.
Thorne, Jr., the CIA's Bross, and a lawyer for CIA,
Benjamin Shute, then a partner in the prestigious
Wall Street law firm of Cravath, Swaine, and Moore,
now acknowledge that the fourth partner [in the
purchase of the Rome Daily American in 1956] was the
CIA. [Bross] recently catled the arrangement ‘atypical'
of what the Agency was doing, 'a bad example'." It is
questionable whether the remarks made by Mr. Bross, who
retired from the Agency in 1971, and Mr. Shute, who
left the Agency long before that, can be considered
as constituting official Agency disclosure of this
information.

b. Item 54, page 80 and item 236, page 262 -- FORUM
WORLD FEATURES. Classified SECRET because they describe
intelligence sources and methods and identification of
operations based in England. Forum World Features was
referred to -- but not by name ---in Boo of the Senate
Select Committee Final Report, page 199, as follows:
"Another example of the damages of [propaganda] 'fallout'
involved two proprietary news services that the CIA main-
tained in Europe .... the larger of the two was subscribed
to. by over 30 U.S. newspapers. In an effort to reduce the
problem of fallout, the CIA made a senior official at the
major dailies aware that the CIA controlled these two

press services." It may be argued that although - Forum
World Features continues to be protected to a degree
by deletion of its name in the Senate Report’, CIA dis-
closure to newspaper editors, if it in fact took place
and depending on how it was handled, placed the subject
in the public domain. NOTE: EUR Division and CA Staff
confirm the need for continued classification and will
comment. separately.

located in the U.S. [Section 5(B)(2)] According to
CCS files, in April 1975 the DCI was asked by an NBC
reporter about CIA sponsorship of Fairways Corporation
in connection with a planned TV documentary on Agency
proprietaries. CCS files are unclear on the point, but
there are indications that the DCI may have responded
to the question in a manner which could have been con-
strued as admission of CIA sponsorship of Fairways.
However, CCS files contain other evidence that CIA
sponsorship of Fairways was considered still classified
as recently as December 1976. NOTE: The DDA/Air
Advisor confirms the need for continued classification
and will comment separately.

m. Item 130, page 133 -- PAN AFRICAN AIRLINES
(NIGERIA) LTD. Classified SECRET; describes intelligence
sources and methods of operations based in Nigeria.
[Section 5(B) (2)]

n. Item 130, page 133 -- SAFARI AIR SERVICE LTD.

o. Item 226, page 257 -- GRACE SHIPPING LINES.

mercial company. [Section 5(B) (2)]

SCHOOLS WORLD LIMITED, INC. Referred to in the manuscript
as "a cover company which sold high school equivalency
diploma courses (advertised on the backs of match books)".

q. Item 280, page 404 -- RTV. Classified SECRET;
describes intelligence sources and methods which expose
an operation targeted against Egypt. [Section 5(B)(2)]



SECRET:

3. The following items were heretofore classified SECRET
because they described sources and methods in identifying a
Support base located in the United States, but are now con-
sidered to have been placed in the public domain.

Items 124, 126, and 127 on pages 129 and 130 --
INTERMOUNTAIN AVIATIONS INC. Intermountain Aviation,
Inc. is named as an Agency proprietary in Book I of
the Senate Select Committee Final Report, pp. 208-9,
and in the Report. of the Rockefeller Commission on
CIA Activities Within the United States, pg. 218.

4. The. following items fall into the questionable area
as to whether they have been placed in the public domain by
authorized Government officials:

a. .Item 49, page 71a -- ROME DAILY AMERICAN.
Classified SECRET because it describes intelligence
sources and methods as related to several newspaper
publications. However, CCS files contain a newsclip
from the September and October 1974 edition of the
Columbia Journalism Review which states, "Landon K.

orne, Jr., the Ss Bross, and a lawyer for CIA,
Benjamin Shute, then a partner in the prestigious
Wall Street law firm of Cravath, Swaine, and Moore,
now acknowledge that the fourth partner [in the
purchase of the Rome Daily American in 1956] was the
CIA. [Bross] recently called the arrangement 'atypical'
of what the Agency was doing, 'a bad example'." It is
questionable whether the remarks made by Mr. Bross, who
retired from the Agency in’1971, and Mr. Shute, who
left the Agency long before that, can be considered
- as. constituting official Agency disclosure of this
information.

b. Item 54, page 80 and item 236, page 262 -- FORUM
WORLD FEATURES. Classified SECRET because they describe
intelligence sources and methods and identification of
operations based in England. Forum World Features was
referred to -- but not by name -- in Book I of the Senate
Select Committee Final Report, page 199, as follows:
"Another example of the damages of [propaganda] 'fallout'
involved two proprietary news services that the CIA main-
tained in Europe .... the larger of the two was subscribed
to by over 30 U.S. newspapers. In an effort to reduce the
problem of fallout, the CIA made a senior official at the
major dailies aware that the CIA controlled these two



SECRET:

press services.". It may be argued that although Forum

World Features continues to be protected to a degree _

by deletion of its name in the Senate Report, CIA dis-

closure to newspaper editors, if it in fact took place

and depending on how it was handled, Placed the subject
in the public domain. NOTE: EUR Division and CA Staff
confirm the need for continued classificdtion and will

SUBJECT: The CIA and the Cult of Intelligence
by Victor Marchetti and John D. Marks

REFERENCE: Memo for All Divisions and Certain Staffs,
from SA/DO/O, 8 April 1977, same subject

Following are Covert Action Staff comments on items
24, 48, 54, 55, 56, 236, and 280, which are among the
passages containing classified information that were de-
leted before publication of the Marchetti-Marks manuscript:

a) Items 24 (p. 47), 55 (p. 80), 56 (p. 81),
and 280 (p. 404) are classified secret, and are
exempt from publication under Section 5 (b) (2) of
EO 11652, which protects intelligence sources and
methods of operation. Specifically, these items
name RTV, Inc. and describe it as a CIA proprietary
that was used for clandestine operations in a variety
of countries. In addition, items 55 and 56 are
especially sensitive because they describe an opera-
tion in Jordan, exposure of which could be harmful to
United States relations in the Middle East ( Section
5 b 3).

b) Items 54 and 236 (on p. 80 and p. 262) are
classified secret, and are exempt from publication
under Section G) (b) (2) of EO 11652, which protects
intelligence sources and methods of operation. These
items name Forum World Features, describe it as a CIA
proprietary that was used for clandestine propaganda
operations, specify that the clandestine operations

were directed especially at the Third World, and further

specify that the man who ran FWF was an experienced
CIA operator. It may be worth noting that the Senate
Select Committee declined to publish the name of this
clandestine proprietary when the Agency advised the
Committee that publication would damage the former
director of Forum World Features, who had entered into
a clandestine relationship with the U.S. Government in
good faith.

c) Item 48 (p. 7la) is classified secret, and

is exempt from publication under Section 5 (b) (2)

of EO 11652, which protects intelligence sources and

methods of operation. This item names African Forum,

Africa Report, Preuves, Encounter, and Forum as

magazines that received CIA subsidies. "In the case

of Preuves, Encounter, and Forum, these magazines were

published by the former Congress for Cultural Freedom.

The Government has not acknowledged covertty subsidizing

CCF or its magazines, although Encounter magazine's

ties to CIA have been the subject of press speculation.

Preuve magazine has been the subject of little or no

press speculation, as far as we know, and it is our

understanding that French laws prohibit covert foreign

subsidies to French publications, which makes it

especially important to protect the former CIA tie to

t that magazine. Exposure of the two Africa magazines
would be damaging to a number of prominent people and
organizations in this country and in Africa that have
worked for improved social conditions in Africa and for
good relations between this country and Africa, which
would be harmful to this country's relations with Africa.

relates to the Penkovskiy Papers. Marchetti and Marks wrote
in etia manuscript: ne of the CIA's most famous venture

"Another CIA book, the Penkovskiy Papers, was
published in the United States in 156s for
operational reasons', but actually became commer-
cially viable. The book was prepared and written
by witting Agency assets who drew on actual case
materials. Publication rights to the manuscript
were sold to a publisher through a trust fund
it which was established for the purpose. The publisher

was unaware of any U.S. Government interest."

3. In view of this published statement by the Senate

Chief of Operations, NE Division

SUBJECT : The CIA and the Cult of Intellis ence by
Victor Marchetti and John D. Marks

1. The following deleted items in subject book have been
placed in the public domain as cited below:

a. Item 72, page 97: This item, which was placed in
he public domain in Harry Rositzke's book, The CIA's Secret

Lary fPperations, on pages 173 and 174, is a problem area. The author
pao of this book is a former senior CIA officer who allowed the

wAgency to review his manuscript prior to publication. However,
CIA did not approve the manuscript for publication and, there-
fore, in our view Item 72 remains classified under Executive
Order 11652 under Exemption 5B (2).

b. Item 152, page 165 and Item 28, page 48: These
two items also fall in a problem area. The following references
to CIA's special relationship with the Shah of Iran imply, but
do not. specifically state, that such a relationship exists. See

ra ae
stan Book 1 of the Select Committee to Study Governmental Operations
with Respect to Intelligence Activities, page 552, an ay S.

QD

om TIine's book entitled, Secrets, Spies and Scholars; Blueprint

shy of the Essential CIA, pages 131 and 132. Additionally, though

Co oe Nr Cline, a former senior CIA officer, allowed the Agency to

E et review his manuscript prior to publication, CIA did not approve
Wei, he manuscript for publication. Therefore, in our view Items

oe 52 and 28 remain classified under Executive Order 11652 under
Exemption 5B (2).

_ SUBJECT : Marchetti/Marks Book

1. Mr. Sam Halperin has questioned our request
that Item 339, page 509 remain classified on the ground
that references to CIA activities in the Congo in an
official report of the U.S. Senate declassified the
reference to the Congo.

2. The existence of a CIA presence in the Congo
is reported in an interim report of the Senate Select
Committee on Intelligence dated 20 November 1975. It
may be argued therefore that to agree to declassification
of the reference to the Congo would have the effect of
singling out the Congo in the Third World as an alleged
target of CIA operations. This would have an adverse 1
effect on our relations with the government of Zaire.
We believe the item should remain classified and that
exemption 5(b)(3) would apply in the case of the Congo.

Question 10. During your tenure as Ambassador, did any U.S. Military Attachés
serve with Khmer military units in the field?

—What regulations did the U.S. En:bassy shave to govern the activities of
U.S. Military Attaches and the Military Equipment Delivery Teaw

—Were any changes in the regulations made after the incident at Kampot

Answer. No U.S, military served with Khmer military units in the deld. 1.5.

Military Equipment Delivers Team, Cambodia routinely visited and reported
the military status of Cambodian military units as part of their duties: however,

that they were adequate, I did, however. personally impress won my military
staff, on several occasions, the necd to abide seruput
and to avoid situations which might he interpreted as infringements cf their
prescribed duties.

Question 11, In November 1974, the Washington Post reported and the Ne
fense Department acknowledged that data on potential hombine tarzets in
Cambodia wax gathered by American reconnaissance dights from Thailand and
paseed an to Cambodian military authorities.

—When did this practice begin?

—Did sou know about it, and did you have a rete in it?

—Do you consider it a violation of the Congressional ban on American
advisors with Khmer Republic forees?

Answer. It-would be inconceivable to me that in a situation as existed ta
Cambodia that military information whieh we had would he deliberately withheld
or deuied to a country to which we were providing enormous military and
economie assistance. The information we had concerning enemy activities in
Cambodia was a by-product of our own intelligence collecting effort on com-
munist forces throughont Indochina. This information was provided to Cam-
bodian military authorities but the decision on what action, if ans, would be
taken was one which the Cambodians made for themelves. The provizions of
information preceded my arrival and I am not aware exactly when the practice
may have begun. I was aware of the practice although I did not plas a pivotal

Answer, Haviug served both in Laos and Cambodia, and knowing the CIA
operations in hoth ecuntries, I can honestly say that the CIA did not act as
. advisers to the Khmer Republic forces in a fashion simiiar to their activities
in Laos, China Airlines, under contract to Air America, transported supplies.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Deputy Director for Operations

VIA : Mr. Ralph J. Katrosh
Special Assistant to the DDO
for External Oversight

FROM : Samuel Halpern

SUBJECT : Review of 168 Deleted Items in
"CIA and the Cult of Intelligence"
by Victor Marchetti and John D. Marks

(U) 1. This is the report of the review done by
the appropriate DDO components of those deleted items
which are the basic responsibility of the DDO. The
remaining deleted items which are the basic responsi-
bility of the, DDS&T and DDA were reviewed by those
Directorates which are reporting directly to OGC.
Responsible components did the necessary inter- and
intraagency coordinations.

(U) 2. Several points need to be highlighted
concerning the completeness of the review, especially
as regards those items declassified by "official
public disclosure" as defined by the courts. While I
am sure that as diligent a search as possible was done
by the DDO components, a thorough and absolutely
complete search is impossible for the following reasons:

(U) a. There is no index of any kind,
let alone having the material in machine form
such as in the RSM, to the fifteen published
hearings and reports of the Senate Select
Committee’ to Study Governmental Operations With
Respect to Intelligence Activities (Church
Committee), the six published hearings and
proceedings of the House Select Committee on
Intelligence (Pike Committee) or the one volume
Report to the President by the Commission on
CIA Activities Within the United States
(Rockefeller Commission) ;

E2 IMPDET
CL BY 018630



ieee | (U) b. There is no comprehensive readily
available record of precisely what information

: has been declassified and released in accordance
: with the Freedom of Information Act. and the
Privacy Act; there are separate collections
with a limited capability to retrieve some such
information;

(U) c. There is no available record of
the information that officials of the Executive
Branch of government, with authority to
declassify information, have said or written
in public either before Congressional
committees, TV talk shows, radio talk shows,
college symposiums, the general’ lecture
circuit, other public forums, etc.

In view of the above, it is impossible to guarantee
that those items which are still classified by the
DDO components have not been deliberately or
inadvertently declassified in whole or in part as
“official public disclosure."

(U) 3. Bearing in mind the above, attachment A
lists those items of the DDO deleted items which have
been declassified by "official public.disclosure."
These thirteen complete and parts of four other items
can therefore be released from the court injunction.

S) 4. Attachment B (seven parts) contains
eleven deleted items (seven subjects) which are still
Here classified but about which there may be some possible
question. These are highlighted here so that
cognizance can be taken and final decisions made with
due regard for all legal and policy aspects.

(U) 5. Attachment C lists all DDO remaining
items which the DDO components advise are still
classified under Executive Order 11652 as amended and
cannot be released from the court ay

Item No. 22, 28, 152, 172 MSS pp. no. 46, 48, 165, 189
(U) NE Division has highlighted these items.

(S) Item 22 states in. part "A notable example of such
a ‘special relationship' is Iran, where a CIA organized coup
d'etat restored the Shah to power in 1953. The Shah was
understandably grateful..." Item 28 lists the Shah among
other "world leaders with whom CIA has developed special
relationships" as. does Item 152 and a similar statement is
made in Item 179.

(U) Ray S. Cline in his book "Secrets, Spies and
Scholars," pp. 131-132, states:

"... a covert operation so successful that it
became widely known all over the world was carried
out in Iran. The Shah, then very young, had been
driven out of Iran by his left-leaning Premier,
Mohammed Mossadegh, whose support came from the
local Communist (Tudeh) Party and from the Soviet
Union. CIA mounted a modest effort under a skillful
clandestine services officer who flew to Iran,
hired enough street demonstrators to intimidate
those working for Mossadegh, instructed Iranian
military men loyal to the Shah how to take over
the local radio station, and paved the way for the
Shah's triumphal return."

(U) _ The Church Committee, Book I, p. 111, briefly
mentioned "the overthrow of Mohammed Mossadegh in Iran"
as one of CIA's "boldest, most spectacular covert
operations."

(S) There is a vast difference between the classified
deleted items speaking about an active "special relationship"
with the Shah following the overthrow of Mossadegh and a
statement about CIA's role in overthrowing Mossadegh. The
former is still properly classifiable and classified.



ATTACHMENT B (2)

Item No. 49 — MSS p. no. 71a. .

(S) Reference to CIA sponsorship of the Rome Dail
American is still classified SECRET because it describes
intelligence sources and methods as related to newspaper
publications. CCS files contain a newsclip from the
September and October 1974 edition of the Columbia
Journalism Review which states; "Landon K. Thorne, Jr.,
the CIA's Bross, and a lawyer for CIA, Benjamin Shute,
then a partner in the prestigious Wall Street law firm
of Cravath, Swaine, and Moore, now acknowledge that the
fourth partner [in the purchase of the Rome Daily American
in 1956] was the CIA. [Bross] recently called the arrange-
ment ‘atypical' of what the Agency was doing, "a bad
example'." It is questionable whether the remarks made by
Mr. Bross,who retired from the Agency in 1971, and Mr. Shute,

“who left the Agency long before that, can be considered

as constituting-official Agency disclosure of: this
information.

ATTACHMENT B (3

Item No. 54, 236 MSS p. no. 80, 262

(S) Reference to CIA sponsorship of Forum World
Features is still classified SECRET because both items
describe intelligence. sources and methods and identifies
operations based in England. Forum World Features was
referred to - but not by name - in Book I of the Church
Committee Final Report, page 199, as follows: "Another
example of the damages of 'fallout' involved two
proprietary news services that the CIA maintained in
Europe... The larger of the two was subscribed to by
over thirty U.S. newspapers. In an effort to reduce the
problem of fallout, the CIA made a senior official at the
major U.S. dailies aware that the CIA controlled these
two press services." While Forum World Features was not
named in the Senate report and therefore continues to be
protected, it is possible that CIA disclosure to newspaper
editors may be considered as "official public disclosure."

Item No. 67 (lines 24, 25) MSS p. no. 92

(S) Under injunction as classified information is
"For its Tibetan operation of. the early sixties, the
Agency constructed extensive support facilities in
Northeast India and brought large numbers of guerrillas
to a deserted Army base in Colorado for special training."
Underlining @ine 25, ninth thru twenty-third word)
indicates the questionable part of the item since MSS
page 97, lines 24-26 states "Some Tibetans were quietly
brought to the United States for special paramilitary
training at Camp Hale in the mountains of Colorado."
This sentence was originally deleted, then reinstated and
appears in boldface type on page 115 in the published book.

Item'No. 72 ~ MSS p. 97
(U) NE Division has highlighted this. item.

: (S) The deleted item is "The CIA quickly made contact
with the Dalai Lama and a close relationship was established.
Financed and advised by Agency covert operators, he was..."

(U) Harry Rositzke, in his book "The CIA's Secret
Operations" pp. 173-174, states "As the Korean war was
winding down, the CIA began sending intelligence agents
into Tibet to assess the situation and see what could be
done to forestall the Chinese takeover that was in the
offing. Tibetan agents equipped with radios were dispatched
by air and made contact with the Dalai Lama ‘in Lhasa, giving
him a channel of communication with the West.

"When the Dalai Lama chose to flee from Lhasa to
avoid capture by the Chinese forces in 1959, he was
accompanied on his flight by a CIA-trained radio operator
who. was able to keep Washington posted on his often
hazardous progress."

(S) The classified deleted item speaks of a CIA
"close relationship" with the Dalai Lama and his being
"financed and advised" by CIA which is quite different
from Rositzke's statement about CIA trained radio operators
being with the Dalai Lama... These are two different
comments with the first being properly classifiable and
classified.

‘ATTACHMENT B (6)

Item No. 107, 128, 129, 279 MSS pp. 123, 132, 133, 403

(S) CCS states that all four items which refer-to
Fairways Corporation as a ClA-owned proprietary company
are still classified since they describe intelligence
sources .and methods by identifying an operational support
facility located in the U.S. and are therefore exempt from
declassification under Section.5 (B) (2) .of the General
Declassification Schedule contained in Executive Order 11652.

(S) According.to CCS files, in April 1975 Director
Colby was asked by an NBC reporter about CIA sponsorship
of Fairways Corporation in connection with a planned TV
documentary on Agency proprietaries. CCS files are unclear
on the point, but there are indications that Director Colby
may have responded to the question in a manner which
could have been construed as admission of sponsorship of
Fairways. In any case, CCS files contain other evidence
that the matter was considered to be still classified as
recently as December 1976, when Director Bush wrote to
the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration
regarding CIA sponsorship of Fairways and asked that. the.
subject be withheld from public disclosure.

ATTACHMENT B (7)

Item No. 339° i MSS p. no. 509

David Phillips’in his book” The Night Watch,
chapter 8, pp. 212-235, entitled "Brazil, Venezuela 1970-
1972" describes his. presence as Chief of Station of CIA
in Brazil and on page 209 he discusses CIA in Bolivia.

(S) In regard to the declassification of CIA presence
in the Congo (Attachment A, Item 339, MSS p. no. 509),
Africa Division states "The existence of a CIA presénce
in the Congo is reported in an interim report of the Senate
Select Committee on Intelligence dated 20 November 1975.
It may be argued therefore that to agree to declassification
of the reference to the Congo would have the effect of
singling out the Congo in the Third World as an alleged
target of CIA operations. This would have an adverse
effect on our relations with the government of Zaire. We
believe the item should remain classified and that
exemption 5 (b) (3) would apply in the case of the Congo."

It is not a question of whether to agree or not
to declassification of reference to the Congo. The Church
Committee report as cited in Attachment A has already made
"official-public disclosure" of the matter, rendering the
subject moot. In addition, as Item 339-in Attachment A
shows, four other countries of the Third World are also
mentioned, thereby not singling out the Congo alone. What
adverse effect could be expected now. by another public -
reference to CIA presence in the Congo as of the original
1974 publication date of the Marchetti/Marks book, is
difficult to comprehend. Since the government of Zaire has
not changed since the 1975 release of the information by
the Church Committee, it-would seem that whatever adverse
effects there might be have already occurred.

"CIA and the Cult of Intelligence"
by Victor Marchetti and John D. Marks

the. report of the review of the deleted items which
are the responsibility of the DDO. Appropriate
components of the DDO reviewed their respective

MEMORANDUM FOR: Deputy Director for Operations

VIA : “Mr. Ralph J. Katrosh
Special Assistant to the DDO
for External Oversight

FROM : “Samuel Halpern

SUBJECT : Review of 168 Deleted Items in
"CIA and the Cult of Intelligence"
by Victor Marchetti and John D. Marks

(U) 1. This is the report of the review done by
the appropriate DDO components of those deleted items
which are the basic responsibility of the DDO. The
remaining deleted items which are the basic responsi-
bility of the DDS&T and DDA were reviewed by those
Directorates which are reporting directly to OGC.
Responsible components did the necessary inter- and
intraagency coordinations. : 7

(U) 2. Several points need to be highlighted
concerning the completeness of the review, especially
as regards those items declassified by "official
public disclosure" as defined by the courts. While I
am sure that as diligent a search as possible was. done
by the DDO components, a thorough and absolutely
complete search is impossible for the following reasons:

(U) a. There is no index of any kind,
let alone having the material in machine form
such as in the RSM, to the fifteen published
hearings and reports of the Senate Select
Committee to Study Governmental Operations With
Respect to Intelligence Activities (Church
Committee), the six published hearings and
proceedings of the House Select Committee on
Intelligence (Pike Committee) or the one volume
Report to the President by the Commission on
CIA Activities Within the United States
(Rockefeller Commission) ;

E2 IMPDET
CL BY 018630


13-00000

(U) b. There is no comprehensive readily
available record of precisely what information
has been. declassified and released in accordance
with the Freedom of Information Act and the
Privacy Act; there are separate collections
with a limited capability to retrieve some such
information;

(U) c. + There is no available record of
the information that officials of the Executive
Branch of government, with authority to
declassify information, have said or written
in public either before Congressional
committees, TV talk shows, radio talk shows,
college symposiums, the general lecture
circuit, other public forums, etc.

In view of the above, it is impossible to guarantee
that those items which are still classified by the
DDO components have not been deliberately or
inadvertently. declassified in whole or in part as
“official public disclosure."

(U) 3. Bearing in mind the above, attachment A
lists those items of the DDO deleted items which have
been declassified by "official public disclosure."
These thirteen complete and parts of four other items
can therefore be released from the court injunction.

(S) 4. Attachment B (seven parts) contains
eleven deleted items (seven subjects) which are still
classified but about which there may be some possible
question. These are highlighted here so that
cognizance can be taken and final decisions made with
due regard for all legal and policy aspects. :

(U) 5. Attachment C lists all DDO remaining
items which the DDO components advise are still
classified under Executive Order 11652 as amerided and
cannot. be released from the court injunction.

documentary on Agency ‘proprietaries. CCS files are unclear
on the point, but there are indications that Director Colby
may have responded to the question in a manner which
could have been construed as admission of sponsorship of
Fairways. In any case, CCS files contain other evidence
that the matter was considered to be still classified as
recently as December 1976, when Director Bush wrote to
the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration
regarding CIA sponsorship of Fairways and asked that the
subject be withheld from public disclosure.

David Phillips in his book .The Night Watch,
chapter 8, pp. 212-235, entitled "Brazil, Venezuela 1970-
1972" describes his presence as Chief of Station of CIA
in Brazil and-on page 209 he.discusses CIA in Bolivia.

(S) In regard to the declassification of CIA presence
in the Congo (Attachment A, Item 339, MSS p. no. 509),
Africa Division states "The existence of a CIA presence
in the Congo is reported in an interim report of the Senate
Select Committee on Intelligence dated 20 November 1975.
It may be argued therefore that to agree to declassification
of the reference to the Congo would have the effect of
singling out the Congo in the Third World as an alleged
target of CIA operations. This would have an adverse
effect on our relations with the government of Zaire. We
believe the item should remain classified and that
exemption 5 (b) (3) would apply in the case of the Congo."

It is not a question of whether to agree or not
to declassification of reference to the Congo. The Church
Committee report as cited in Attachment A has already made
"official-public disclosure" of the matter, rendering the
subject moot. In addition, as Item 339 in Attachment A
shows, four other countries of the Third World are also
mentioned, thereby not singling out the Congo alone. What
adverse effect could be expected now by another public
reference to CIA presence in.the Congo as of the original
1974 publication date of the Marchetti/Marks book, is
difficult to comprehend. Since the government of Zaire has
not changed since the 1975 release of the information by
the Church Committee, it would seem that whatever adverse
effects there might be have already occurred,

SUBJECT : Review of Deletions from The CIA and the

Cult of Intelligence by Marchetti and Marks

1. The responsible and knowledgeable components of this
directorate have reviewed the appropriate deletions from subject
book per your request. The review was made to determine whether
each deletion was still classified under EO 11652 or whether the
information in each deletion has been officially released by the
U.S. Government.

2. Attached, Tab A, is a list of the deleted items reviewed
by this directorate. Tab B is'a list of those items of primary
interest of this directorate. All of these items remain classi-
fied; however, portions of one item, 135, can be released. Tab C
is a list of those items which we determined are still classified
under EO 11652; however, some portions of three items can be
released, but we recommend that all of the items in Tab C be
coordinated with other indicated elements. Tab D is a list of
items we determined are not of concern to this directorate and
should be referred to other indicated elements. Tab E is a list
of the four items.mentioned above which we believe portions can
now be released. The portions in red. brackets remain classified
and should not be released.

3. Since many of the deleted items involved the National
Security Agency (NSA), we attempted to coordinate our determina-
tions through our contacts at NSA. We were told that any
coordination must be handled between the NSA and CIA General
Counsel. As a result, no further coordination with other ele-
ments was attempted.

4. This memorandum completes the DDS§&T action on the
court ordered review of the deletions from subject book.

[Hussein and the U.S. Government became increasingly concerned about the (eZ) r]

strong and strident propaganda voice of Radio Cairo. Both parties shared a

Aw

desire to Counter its anti-American, anti-Hussein line (which was notfnew) ,

so the CIA funded the building of a Jordanian television station. A CIA 4
owned, New York based proprietary company, named RTV, provided the technical 4
expertise and management skills to put the station in operation. | 6
Still another example of a country-where the CIA enjoys a special 7
relationship is Nationalist CHina. On Taiwan, however, the CIA's link is 3
not with President Chiang Kai-shek but with his son and heir apparent,
Premier Chiang Ching-Kuo. One former CIA chief of station, Ray Cline, now the /
State Department's Director of Intelligence and Research, became something h
of a legend within the Clandestine Services because of his frequent all- /
night drinking boutspii th the younger Chiang. t
[over the years, the CIA closely collaborated with the Nationalists first Gs
to run guerrilla attacks against mainland China and then in-more recent L

years to use Taiwan as a base for U-2 flights (flown over China by Nationalist h

pilots trained in the United States), electronic surveillance of the mainland 4
and such covert action programs as propaganda and disinformation aimed at l

China during the Cultural Revolution, |

In South Vietaam, Ambassador Ellsworth Bunker insisted on personally z
conducting al) important meetings, with President Thieu; sometimes Bunker was 2
accompanied by the CIA chief, when there was Agency business to be discussed. 2
But there has been another CIA officer in Saigon who has known Thieu for Zz
many years and who has retained access to the Vietnamese President. 2
According to a former assistant to Ambassador Bunker, this CIA officer has zZ
served as conduit between Thieu and the American government when a formal hi

“meeting is not desired or when Thieu wishes to float an idea. \ 2

the information straight forwardly, thereby, handicapeing the analysts in making

a confident judgment of the accuracy of the report's content.”
Some intelligence analysts, both inside and outside the CIA, receive‘

large numbers of this type of report every day, many of which do come from

actual agents. But by mixing together information supplied by audio surveillance

(which 1s, by definition, an accuzate account of what was edid) with agent

reports which are sometimes exaggerated or false, the Clandestine Services

confuses and often misleads those people within the U.S. government whose

function it is to analyse foreign events and indirectly those leaders who make

decisions based on that intelligence analysis.

! Inthe mid-1960s, the Far East Division of the Clandestine Services and

the experts of the Scientific and fachnical Directorate combindddféaces to

carry. out one of the Agency's most imaginative (if ultimately unsuccessful)

intelligence collection operations ever undertaken. At that time, top-level

U.S. government officials were distwtbed by repprts that Communist China was on

the verge of developing an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) system.

They knew that the threat posed by Chinese IC3M's would play an important part

in the decision, then under consideration, to go ahead with an American anti-

ballistic missile (ABM) deployment program. As.a matter of the highest

priority, the CIA was told to find out what was happening at Shuangch'engtzu, the

Chinese missile test site in the far western corner of Inner Mongolia.

The Agency's technical specialists responded by designing a nuclear-

ppwered device which could monitor certain key electronic emissions coming from

the missile site, well over a thousand miles away, and then rely the information

to a CIA listening post. The plan was to emplace the device on a mountain

peak called the Nanda Devi, at an altitude of more than 25,000 feet, in the

Indian Himalayas from where it would have an unobstructed "line-of-sight" to

the secret test facility. As the device was being perfected in the CIA

Tahoratories. the Clandestine Services took on the resoonsibility for the nost /

[sifficurt phase of the operation -~ installing the machine on the mountain top.(Zéa),

The first thing that had to be done was to gain the permission of the

Indian government to implement the scheme, not a large problem in view of the

CIA's close relations with the Indian intelligence service. The Indians not

only agreed but, surprisingly, insisted on full participation in the project.

Next, the Agency recruited a group of experienced mountain climbers to carry

the device, complete wth its nuclear powerpack, pp the mountain and put it

into operation. A well-known American mountaineer who had previously conquered

Mt. Everest, Barry Bishop, was contacted and convinced to lead the climb.

Overall control of the operation, however, was placed in the hands of an experienced

CIA case officer.

That summer, the Agency operator along with the American and Indian
Paden

climbers, and a group of Sherpa porters, were brought together at a secret

CIA training base in the Rocky Mountains to practice as a team and to learn

how to assemble the monitoring device once they got it to the top-of Nanda Devi.

Cover for the operation was carefully built by leaking information in international

mountaineering circles that a joint American-Indian expedition was planning an

ascent of one of the more difficult Himalayan peaks. During the winter, the

technicians completed work on the sensor device, and a few months later the

CIA chief of station in Delhi reported ‘that all logistical and cover arrangements

with Indian intelligence had been completed. The monitoring device was

clandestinely flown to a secure staging area in northern India by a transport

plane from one of the Agency's proprietary airlines. Next, the climbers were

brought together and taken to the camp in the foothills of the Himalayas from

where they and the Sherpas would begin their long, difficult ascent of the Nanda
Devi. i

Things went well at first, but after the expedition passed the snow line, the

Indians began to tire and became irascible, claiming that they were backpacking

too much weight. The CIA case officer redistributed the load a ——! the

[voula do. Progress slowed and, behind schedule, the team reached the base (D)

camp from where the final ascent to the mountain's summit would be made by

a small party of climbers accompanidd by a few porters. Soon after the

group had started for the peak, one of the Sherpas returned to base camp to

tell the CIA man, who had remained behind to handle communications with the

staging area, that the Indians were causing trouble at the higher altitudes.

The case officer immediately set out to reach Bishop and the summit team in

an effort to restore peace among the climbers. The project was now wel off

schedule, and any more delays would have endangered the entire expedition

because of the onset of bad weather. With some difficulty, the Agency
operator was able to get the team moving again, and it finally reached its

target near the top of the Nanda Devi. Amidst howling winds and at temperatures
well below zero, the climbers assembled the monitoring device and put it into
operation. With spirits high, the group returned to base camp and the news ©

of the successful installation was sadioed back to the staging. area.

But within a few short months, the signals that the sensor had been

sending from the Nanda Devi stopped. The CIA dispatched a plane to. fly over
the mountain and photograph the monitoring site. It was learned that the

device had been knocked over by a snow slide. When the Indian government

was informed of the development, it complained to the CIA station in Delhi

that the nuclear generator might be polluting the headqaters of the sacred

Ganghes River which flow out of the Himalayas. The Indian concern was about

religious pollution, not ecological.

The CIA reacted by planning another climbfof the mountain for the following

At this point, the Agency gave up on mountain-top monitoring of the

Communist Chinese missile program, turning to other systems and new, improved

satellites for acquiring the information it was seeking. The Indians were

Tne fertile imaginations of the Syset experts during the following
years produced many more unique codirction schemes aimed ‘at solving the
mysteries of China's strategic missile program. Most eventually proved to be
unworkable, and at least one entailed a frighteningly high-risk potential.
The silliest of them all, however, called for the creation of a small one-man
airplane that could theoretically be packaged in two large suitcases. In :
concept, an agent along with the suitcases would somehow be infiltrated into
the denied area where, after performing his espionage mission, he would ~
assemble the aircraft and fly to safety over the nearest friendly border.

Even the chief of the Clandestine Services refused to have anything to do with

this scheme, and the projectydied on the drawing boards.

slowed by a parachute so that the device would penetrate only two or three

feet into the ground on impact. Afterwards, the system, anfaerial rising from

its top, would activate itself and perform its electronic sensing tasks. Still

later, the device would transmit its findings to a listening post, most

likely a circling aircraft. The need for secret air penetration deep into a

installation and dropping an object in an action that could quite easfly appear

ab

to a startled radar operator as a. lone bomber engaging in a surprise nuclear

attack. Development of the €oatly system was, therefore, pushed ahead. The

technicians were more concerned with the fact that the test drops of the device

in the southwestern U.S. desert usually resulted in the system burying itself

several feet below the ground surface or so jarring the delicate instrumentation

that the device failed to self-activate and function properly. _{ ‘

[a third system was a model airplane roughly the size of a large bird, 165,

such as a condor, which was powered by a miniature nuclear engine and which

could be launched from outside China and guided to the missile test site well

over a thousand miles away, all the while soaring in patterns that would resemble

on the air defense radar scopes the flight patterns of a large eagle. Once - “

over the target, the plane's electronic sensors and tiny television cameras

would be-turned on to record activities below and relay the information either

. to its Jauach site or much more likely a hovering aircraft that had penetrated

Chinese airspace for this purpose. Millions of dollars were expended by the

CIA in research on this “baby U-2" that called for numerous breakthroughs in

the state of the technical arts. Its chief advantage was, of course, that if

and when it was shot down there would be no pilot to confess it had been on an

Agency-sponsored spying mission. }

the proposed agreement, he raised some questions with the CIA station chief that ot
, blossomed into an inter-agency dispute. At this point Meyer cabled the State (A
Department for instructions and advice. 7

In the way of background, it should be understood that CIA communications x

C clerks handle nearly all classified cables between American embassies overseas 9

and Washington -~ for both the CIA and the State Department. To have a separate /¢

code room for each agency in every embassy would be a wasteful procedure, so a tt

senior CIA communications expert is regularly assigned to the administrative 12

ce part of the State Department in order to oversee CIA's communicators who work 3
: under State cover. In theory, CIA code clerks are not supposed to read the ite

messages they send for State, but any code clerk who wants to have a successful s

i career quickly realized that his promotions depend on the CIA and that he jis Ie
well advised to show the CIA station chief copies of all important State 17
' messages. The State Department long ago implicitly recognized that its most 13
secret cables are not secure from CIA inspection by setting up special 19
communications channels which sppposedly cannot be deciphered by the CIA. Zz

[Situation in private with his superiors. But Bob and his cohorts at FI/D were /
one step ahead of Ambassador Meyer. They had figured. out a way to intercept 2Z
his cables and the replies he received from Washington. So shortly after each gy
State message was sent, Bob would appear in the CIA executive suite with a copy Y
of the message for the personal inspection of the Director. Written on top of a
each rintercepted cable was a warning that the contents of the cable should be &
kept especially confident because State was unaware thet the CIA had a copy. 7

Despite Agency knowledge of all of Meyer's instructions and information, %
Meyer and State's director of Iranian Affairs in Washington refused to yield 9
to Agency pressure for a quick settlement. Even-after these two men met at MK
CIA headquarters with the Deputy Director of CIA, Vice Admiral Rufus Taylor, YW
they still insisted that the Agency's plans for the new installation were 2
unacceptable to the U.S. government as a whole. CIA Director Helms was so /
aggravated by this continued resistance thai he personally telephoned Secretary /

of State Rusk to settle the matter. Rusk promptly ended the dispute by agreeing r]
completely to the CIA position. /
[on was also involved in another series of events which started when FI/D — ep!

worked out a liaison arrangement with the codebreaking service of a certain i

South American government. This arrangement was ostensibly for the purpose of ‘

allowing the CIA and the other country to cooperate in decoding messages sent 2

by third countries. However, FI/D tood advantage of the liaison to intercapt 2

the ‘secret communications of the host South American government. Such arrangements :

were norma1} procedure to Bob. The intensely dedicated law and order advocate saw ‘

nothing wrong in practicing this sort of duplicity on an allied government which i
cooperated in good faith. ’

FI{D's liaison with the South American country continued for a long period ‘
of time until relations between the United States and that nation soured over ‘

unrelated issues, and asa result FI/D was forced to break off the relationship.

However, FI/D did not give up hope that the previous working arrangements could 4

[Sometime later, Bbb suggested to an officer in the CIA's executive suite GD
v e

that the Agency should help the South American country obtain a channel in the

international satellite communications network, Comsat. Always the secretive

operator, Bob did not explain why the Agency should do this, and the other

CIA man replied that CIA, afterall, was not the American foreign aid program; and

frether or not this particular country received a Comsat channel did not seem to

be a matter concer..ing CIA. Only later did the executive suite officer learn

from other sources that FI/D had worked out a deal with the South American

country in which Haison would be restored in return for a‘Comsat channel (which

CIA would intercept). But Bob could not bring himself to share his scheme w¥en

with a fellow Agency employee in the Director's office.

Eventually, the South American country received the Comsat channel; the

country restored liaison with FI/D; and CIA again had access to all of that

country's secret messages. i

Bob's job with FI/D is by no means one of the dirtiest jobs in the
Clandestine Services. There are operators in the paramilitary fields who
probably conceive and carry out more distasteful machinations. But Bob is in
a position where, on a regular basis, he misrepresents himself and even les
within the U.S. government -- not to mention the deceit he and his colleagues
perpetrate on friendly foreign governments which in good faith enter into
liaison agreements with FI/D.

relatively successful careers with the CIA and rose to roughly the same upper-
middle level of the bureaucracy as Bob X has. McCord was a CIA security

C a Agency had become involved in a chain of events which forced
it to intervene militarily in a second country to pratect its
operation against Cuba. The Presiient way have set the original
policy, but there was no way he could have known that Simply
by approving an attack on Cuba, he would set in train Agency
paramilitary activities against Guatamala.

CIA operations can have another unforseen effect on Amer-
ican foreign policys” Frey can subject the country to plackaail
4f something goes wrong. For instance, after th {SEA [abot was
shot down and captured by Indonesia in 1958, within vive days
the US government approved the sale for local currency cf 37,000
tons of American rice and lifted an embargo on $1 million in
small arms ana other military equipment. Considering at that

moment, the ds TA was actively backing-an armed revolution against
the Sukarno regime .chese would have been strange actions indeed
for the US eovermne to take if it were not extremely concerned '
about saving the captured pilot. :

A somewhat similar incident occurred in Singapore in 1960
after a CIA lie detector expert was flown specially into the city .
to make sure that a locally recruited agent was trustwor thy. ’
: When the Agency technician plugged is his polygraph machine fa
a hotel room, he blew out all the fuses in the building.* The

{enis was not the only time that the CLA blew major “sos uver~ 2

seas. During the mid-19608, the Agency added to Ate nusenor 7 nusenon 7

facilities on Taiwan by building e inege electronic ax ig



lie detector man, a CIA case officer, and the local ‘agent were
soon all under arrest. The Singapore government and the British,
who were in the process of granting Singapore its independencs,
‘were both quite disturbed bythe indident. Negotiations then
ensued to secure the men's release. According to Singapore
Prime Kinister Lee Kuan Yew, the US government offered33.3 mil-
lion to get them out. Lee claimed that he wanted ten times as
much and consequently took nothing. In any case, the two CLA

: officials were subsequently freed, the newly installed Secretary
: of State, Dean Rusk, wrote a secret letter of apology to the
Singapore leader. In 1965, Lee mentioned the affair in a speech
ie example of the type of activities engaged in bythe CIA.
The State Depaztment then issued a routine denial furnished by.
the ClA--State's press office not realizing the truth of Lee’s
charges. Lee reacted by publicly producing Rusk*s letter of d-
pology, and State was forced to retract its original statement,
although it still maintained that no ransom had ever been offered.

As weil as embarrassing the US government and meking headlines

around the world, the incident caused the State Department to
revanp its internal system for waking announcements about in-

telligence matters.

In general, the presence of American intelligence facili-

ties in a foreign country can have an important effect on Amer=

ican policy toward that country, especially in the @gird world. |

Closely aligned countries, such as[znglandy jermany, Japan, IG

and Australia, have usually allowed the Unived States to set

up electronic spying bases as part of the gensral framework of

cooperation batween allies. | But to the less dsvelopsd countries,

the presence of an American installation is both a threat and
an opportunity. The threat cones from domestic opposition fore
ces who look on the base ‘as an example of "neo-colonislica”
and use it as a weapon against those in powers The opportunity
arises out of the fact that the United States will pay dearly

for the right-to install its eavesdropping equipment--and to

keep {t in place, as [Archbishop Makartos] discovered. (Foo

eriticized by internal forces and neighboring countries for

giving the United States a foothold in their nations, but both

tively modest amounts of aid would have probvably beeri*supplied,
even if there had been no bases, the large size of the programs
represented, in effect, a direct payment for the intelligence

Similarly, from 1956 until theend of 1969, the US Air /orce

operated a huge base near Peshawar in Pakistan, which was prie

marily an intelligence facility. For several years before Francis

Gary Powers' abortive flight over the Soviet Union in 1960,
CIA U-2 planes used Peshawar as a principal take-off point for

reconnaissance flights over and along the edzes of the Soviet

Uniion. In addition, [Rilitary intelligence set up a vast array

In 1964, it was learned that the American embassy in Moscow had been thoroughly 2
bugged by the KGB. Scores of Soviet audio devices were found throughout the . 2

building. Counterespionage and security specialists determined that the 4
equipment had been installed in 1952 when the enbassy had been renovated, and a
that the bugs had been operational for roughly twelve years. The damage report

asserted that during this entire pariod -- at the height of the cold war -- 7

Soviet ibtelligence had probably intercepted every diplomatic cable between

Washington and the embassy. ints assessment was based on the discovery oe
audio devices in the code room which weski=tse allowed the Soviets to hear ‘ t

distinctly the sounds being maded by the typewriters and cryptographic equipment.

It was a reasonably easy technological feat -- well within Soviet capabilities --

to translate such sounds into their true alphabetical meaning. [ : I

American suspicions about the Soviet eavesdropping were apparently aroused "

early in 1964 when Soviet leader Khrushchev made a remark to Ambassador Rp Fry
Kohler about Kbhler's role in baocking the shipment to the Soviet Union of

steel for an important pépeline. Taken in context, Khrushchev's remark indicated
to Kohler that there was a leak somewhere in American security. Kohler started

a massive investigation, and within a month or two, forty-odd bugs were found

embedded in walls throughout the embassy. Although Kohler would Jater claim — ;

there was no connection between the discovery of the bugs and the investigation 4
he ordered after his conversation with Khrushchev, the timing would seen to s
indicate otherwise. ra

Tin any case, the official damage report concluded that for those twelve

crucial years at the height of the Cold War, the Soviets almost certainly knew 2

MEMORANDUM FOR: Mr. Halpern

FROM: H.G. Bean
Acting Executive Officer/DDA
SUBJECT: Fairways Corporation
REFERENCE : Attached memorandum from Central Cover Staff

1. With reference to paragraph 4 in the attached memorandum
from Mr. Latta, to the very best of our knowledge the CIA sponsorship
of the Fairways Corporation has not been officially placed in the
public domain. There has been at least one newspaper article relating
to Fairways and, in addition, at least one short television news
item on the same subject. However, official confirmation of the
allegations of a relationship which was made in these media presentations
has been carefully avoided.

2. There has been official acknowledgement of the fact that
CIA's Office of Training runs a proprietary to provide executive
transportation. Such a statement appeared in the report of the
Senate Select Committee on Intelligence Activities. However, here
again there has been no acknowledgement that such an entity was
identical with or related to the Fairways Corporation.

3. The DDA concurs with the position of CCS as expressed in
paragraph 2 of Mr. Latta's memorandum.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Executive Officer to the DDA

FROM : M. L. Latta :
Deputy Chief, Plans and Review Group
Central Cover Staff

SUBJECT : Fairways Corporation

1. Per our telephone conversation today, attorneys
for Victor Marchetti have requested release of the 168
items previously deleted by court order from the book,
The CIA and the Cult of Intelligence. Fairways Corpora-
tion was referred to CCS by the SA/DO/O for review in

this connection.

2. Fairways Corporation is the subject of four items

(107, 128, 129, 279; on pages 123, 132, 133, and 403 respec-
tively,) in the original manuscript. The position of CCS on

: all four items is that they are still classified, since they
describe intelligence sources and methods by identifying an
operational support facility located in the U.S., and are
therefore exempt from declassification under Section 5(B) (2)
of the General Declassification Schedule contained in Executive
Order 11652.

3. According to CCS files, in April 1975 Director Colby
was asked by an NBC reporter about CIA sponsorship of Fair-
ways in connection with a planned TV documentary on Agency
proprietaries. CCS files are unclear on the point, but there
are indications that Director Colby may have responded to

: the question in a manner which could have been construed as
i admission of CIA sponsorship of Fairways. In any case, CCS
files contain other evidence that the matter was considered
to be still classified as recently as December 1976, when
Director Bush wrote to the Administrator of the Federal
Aviation Administration regarding CIA sponsorship of Fair-
ways and asked that the subject be withheld from public
disclosure.

ATTENTION : ‘John Greaney
SUBJECT : Review of Deletions from The CIA and the

Cult of Intelligence by Marchetti and Marks

1. The responsible and knowledgeable components of this
directorate have reviewed the appropriate deletions from. subject
book per your request. The review was made to determine whether
each deletion was still classified under EO 11652 or whether the
information in each deletion has been officially released by the
U.S. Government.

2. Attached, Tab A, is a list of the deleted items reviewed
by this directorate. Tab B is a list of those items of primary
interest of this directorate. All of these items remain classi-
fied; however, portions of one item, 135, can be released. Tab C
is a list of those items which we determined are still classified
under EO 11652; however, some portions of three items can be
released, but we recommend that all of the items in Tab C be
coordinated with other indicated elements. Tab D is a list of
items we determined are not of concern to this directorate and
should be referred to other indicated elements. Tab E is a list
of the four items mentioned above which we believe portions can
now be released. The portions in red brackets remain classified
and should not be released. -

3. Since many of the deleted items involved the National
Security Agency (NSA), we attempted to coordinate our determina-
tions through our contacts at NSA. We were told that any
coordination must be handled between the NSA and CIA General
Counsel. As a result, no further coordination with other ele-
ments was attempted.

4. This memorandum completes the DDS§&T action on the
court ordered review of the deletions from subject book.

Some intelligence analysts, both inside and outside the CIA, receive‘

large nuinbers of this type of report every day, many of which do come from

actual agents. But by mixing together information supplied by audio surveillance —

(which is, by definition, an accugate account of what was edid) with agent ‘

reports which are sometimes exaggerated or false, the Clandestine Services

confuses and often misleads those people within the U.S. government whose

function it is to analyze foreign events and indirectly those leaders who make

decisions based on that intelligence analysis.

[iin. the mid-1960s, the Far East Division of the Clandestine Services and

the experts of the Scientific and Tachnical Directorate combindddféoces to

carry out one of the Agency's most imaginative (if ultimately unsuccessful)

intelligence collection operations ever undertaken. At that time, top-level

U.S. government officials were distutbed by repprts that Communist China was on _

the verge of developing an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) system.

They knew that. the threat posed by Chinese ICBM's would play an important part

in the decision, then under consideration, to go ahead with an American anti-

ballistic missile (ABM) deployment program. As a matter of the highest

priority, the CIA was told to find out. what was happening at Shuangch'engtzm, the

Chinese missile test site in the far western corner of Inner Mongolia.

The. Agency's technical specialists. responded by designing a nuclear~

ppwered device which could monitor certain key electronic: emissions coming from

the missile site, well over a thousand miles. away, and then rely the information

to a CIA listening post: The plan was to emplace the device on. a’mountain

peak called-the Nanda Devi, at an altitude of more than 25,000 feet, in the

Indian Himalayas from where it would have an unobstructed "line-of-sight" to

the secret test facility. As the device was being perfected in the CIA

Taboratories. the Clandestine Services took on the resoonsibilitv for the nos§PGRET

[sitficurt phase of the operation -- installing the machine on the mountain top. (a),
The first thing that had to be done was to gain the permission of the z
Indian government to implement the scheme, not a large problem in view of the 2
CIA's close relations with the Indian intelligence service. The Indians not 4
only agreed but, surprisingly, insisted on full participation in the project. S
Next, the Agency recruited a group of experienced mountain climbers to carry 4
the device, complete wtth its nuclear powerpack, pp the mountain and put it. 4
into operation. A well-known American mountaineer who had previously conquered 4g

Mt. Everest, Barry Bishop, was contacted and convinced to lead the climb.

Overall control of the operation, however, was placed in the hands of an expertenced
CIA case officer. i

That summer, the Agency operator along with the American and Indian

climbers, and a group of Sherpa porters, were brought together at a secret

CIA training base in the Rocky Mountains to practice as a team and to learn

how to assemble the monitoring device once they got it to the top of Nanda Devi.

Cover for the operation was carefully built by leaking information in international

mountaineering circles that a joint American-Indian expedition was planning an

ascent of one of the more difficult Himalayan peaks. During the winter, the

technicians completed work on the sensor device, and a few months later the

CIA chief of station in Delhi reported ‘that all logistical and cover arrangements

with Indian intelligence had been completed. The monitoring device was

clandestinely flown to a secure staging area in northern India by a transport

plane from one of the Agency's proprietary airlines. Next, the climbers were

brought together and taken to the camp in the foothills of the Himalayas from

where they and the Sherpas would begin their long, difficult ascent of the Nanda

Devi.

Things went well at first, but after the expedition passed the snow line, the

Indians began to tire and became irascible, claiming that they were backpacking A

too much weight. The CIA case officer redistributed the load by convincing the &S

[Tica do. ‘progress slowed and, behind schedule, the team reached the base (TD)

camp from where the final ascent to the mountain's summit would be made by

a small party of climbers accompanidd by a few porters. Soon after the

group had started for the peak, one of the Sherpas returned to base camp to

tell the CIA man, who had remained behind to handle communications with the —

staging area, that the Indians were causing trouble at the higher altitudes. -

The case officer immediately set out to reach Bishop and the summit team in

an effort to restore peace among the climbers. The project was now weal off

schedule, and any more delays would have endangered the entire expedition

because of the onset of bad weather. With some difficulty, the Agency

operator was able to get the team moving again, and it finally reached its

target near the top of the Nanda Devi. Amidst howling winds and at temperatures

well below zero, the climbers assembled the monitoring device and put it into

operation. With spirits high, the group returned to base camp and the news ©

of the successful installation was sadioed back to the staging area.

But within a few short months, the signals that the sensor had been

sending from the Nanda Devi stopped. The CIA dispatched a plane to fly over
the mountain and photograph the monitoring site. It was learned that the

device had been knocked over by a snow Slide. When the Indian government

was informed of the development, it complained to the CIA station in Delhi
that the nuclear generator might be polluting the headgaters of the sacred

Ganghes River which flow out of the Himalayas. The Indian concern was about

religious pollution, not ecological.

The CIA reacted by planning another cl imbfof the mountain for the following

year, both to retrieve the damaged equipment and implace a new monitoring

system -- this one powered by a non-nuclear generator. The climbing team,

led by Bishép, was gathered together again and this time it reached the

top of the mountain with comparatively little difficulty. The new device was

Tne fertile imaginations of the ysat experts during the following
years produced many more unique codirction schemes aimed at solving the i ‘
nysteries of China's strategic missile program, Most eventually proved to be ;
unworkable, and at least one entailed a frighteningly high-risk potential.

The silliest of them ail, however, called for the creation of a small one-man

rom

airplane that could theoretically be packaged in two large suitcases. In :
concept, an agent along with the suitcases would somehow be infiltrated into
the denied area where, after performing his espionage mission, he would ~
assemble the aircraft and fly to safety over the nearest friendly border.

Even the chief of the Clandestine Services refused to have anything to do with
this scheme, and the projectydied on the drawing boards.

A second system was a device, long and tubular like a rocket, that could( /

be dropped by a U-2 or another aircraft near the missile test site, its fall

slowed by a parachute so that the device would penetrate only two or three

feet into the ground on impact. Afterwards, the systen, anfaerial rising from

its top, would activate itself and perform its electronic sensing tasks. Stil]

later, the device would transmit its findings to a listening post, most

likely a circling aircraft. The need for secret air penetration deep into a

oblivious of the dangers involved. in secretly flying near a Chinese missile 2

installation and dropping an object in an action that could quite easily appear =

to a startled radar operator as a lone bomber engaging in a surprise nuclear 4
attack. Development of the €oatly system was, therefore, pushed ahead. The 7
technicians were more concerned with the fact that the test drops of the device &

in the southwestern U.S. desert usually resulted in the system burying itself

several feet below the ground surface or so jarring the delicate instrumentation ‘
that the device failed to self-activate and function properly. { ‘

A third system was a model airplane roughly the size of a large bird, @>

such as a condor, which was powered by a miniature nuclear engine and which

could be launched from outside China and guided to the missile test site well

over a thousand miles away, all the while soaring in patterns that would resemble

on the air defense radar scopes the flight patterns of a large eagle. Once - o
over the target, the plane's electronic sensors and tiny television cameras —
would be turned on to record activities below and relay the information either

to its lauach site or much more likely a hovering aircraft that had penetrated ©

Chinese airspace for this purpose. Millions of dollars were expended by the

CIA in research on this "baby U-2" that called for numerous breakthroughs in
the state of the technical arts. Its chief advantage WAS, of course, that if

unacceptable to the U.S. government as a whole. CIA Director Helms was so I

|" Following is @ transcrit of Presi-
dent Carter's news’ conference in
Washington yesterday afternoon, as
vecorded by The New: York Times
| through tI2 facilities of ABC News:

Opening Statement »

'* Goed: afternoon everybody. I'd like
to make a very brief statement as a
~progress report to the. American people
of some items that are important to
ius. ,

} We have submitted and the Congress
his now considering legislation to give
me the authority to reorganize «the
‘executive branch of Government, The
Senate Committee under Senator Ribic-
off has now completed their hearings
tnd they'll be marking up, the bill
. beginning tomorrow.

The House Committee on Govern-
“ment Operations under Congressman
Jack Brooks has‘scheduled hearings to
begin on March 1.

So because of the interest of the
‘American people and the Congress and
myself in completing this very crucial
project I think the Congress is moving
‘with great expedition to give me that

authority.
t. We've also initiated with directions
to the members ‘of “the Cabinet and
other agency heads a new program to
cut down on the extremely great over-
Joad of paper work with a requirement
that those who prepare Government
regulations be responsible for the
preparation assigned them. I've asked
my Cabinet ‘officers to read the regula-
tions that are forthcoming from their
departments each week until they see
‘the volume and the complexity of them,
and we hope to eliminate unnecessary
regulations, abbreviate those that are
necessary and express them in a Jan-
Ruage so that we can all understand
them.

' ve also asked major elements of

‘our own society, the university profes-.
sors and the state officials in this last
week to give me their suggestions on
how the regulations might be improved.

‘We have done the same thing with
reports required by the Federal Govern-
nient. I hope-to ‘reduce drastically the
number of-reports and the frequency
of those reports and the, complexity,
of them. :

We will complete the proposed fegis-
lation on creating a new Department
of Energy this week. The proposed
legislation is now on my desk. It will
be submitted 10 the Congress for action
the first of next week. And we've con-
sulted very closely with the key leaders
in the Congress and I believe there's
going to be a: rapid creatina of this
new department and a heavy emphasis
gn the importance of energy questions
to our people.

We will also present to the American
people. probably at a joint’ scssion of
the Congress a speech by,me about
April 20, a comprehensive energy poli-
cy which would involve all the com-
plexities of the energy question. It's
something that’s tong overdue and it’s
Boing to be quite profound in its impact
on the American consciousness and our
icty, and I hope it will be compre-

27 FECIVAP tHe

W YORK TINT,

President Carter walking past reporters after news conference at the E:

T'm not going to leave of not comment-
ing directly on any specific C.LA. ace
tivity. But I can tell you that I have
begun a:complete analysis which will
be completed within the next week of
all activities by the C.LA. I’ve received
substantial reports already.

Vve reviewed the more controversial
revelations that have been publicized
in the last few days, some quite errone-
ous, some with some degree of accura-
cy. These same operations have been
reviewed by the Intelligence Oversight
Board, an independent board, and also
by my predecessory, President Ford.
I have not found anything illegal or
improper.

If in future assessments, which will
come quite early, I discover such an
impropriety or an. illegality I will not
only take immediate action to correct
it but also will let the American people
know about it.

I might say this. This is a very serious
problem of how in a democracy to have
adequate intelligence gathered, as-
sessed and used to guarantee the-se-
cutity of our country. It's not part of
the American nature to do things in
secret. Obviously, historically anid still
at this modern time there is a necessity
to protect sources of information from
other nations. Sometimes other Gov-
ernments cooperate with us fully;
sometimes they don’t.

But I'll try to be sure, and so will
Stan. Turner, who will be the next
director of the intelligence community.
He will try to be sure that every thing
we do is not only proper and legal,
but also compatible with the attitudes
‘of the American people.

One other point I'd like to make is
this. It can be extremely damaging to
our relationship with other nations, to
the potential security of our country

with labor and management. Bu
whether I'll be successful, I don’t know
I'm just going to have to do my nest

6, Human Rights Abroad

Q. In your letter to Mr. Sakh-rov
you said that the United States would
use its good offices to seek the release
of prisoners of conscience. Ani you
said that you wanted to continue tc
shape a world responsible to human
aspirations. As you know there are
human rights problems in many. other
countries, And: some of them like Iran
or the Philippines we support with
arms, or we support with American aid.
‘These are countries where many people
believe we have more leverage than
we might have in the. Soviet’ Union.
What if anything do you plan to try
to do to help victims of political reores.
sign in these countries?

A. I think without my trying to take
credit for it there has been a substan
tial move toward concern about hi man
rights throughout the world. 1 think
this has tasen place in probably ‘a
dozen or more different cow. “i
‘There's an arousing interest in the posi-
tion that our own Government here in
our free country does take. Obviously
there are deprivations of human vighls
even more brutal than the ones on
which we've commented up to now.

In. Uganda the actions there have dis-
gusted the enlire civilized world and,
as you know, we have no diplomatic
relationships with Uganda. But hy 2 is
an instance where both Ambassador
Andrew Young and I have expressed
great concern about what is there. The
British are now considering asking the
United Nations to go into Uganda to
assess the horrible murders that :y-par-
ently are taking place in that countryv—

HO WUigAES atk WoHeHe Unto
B to be a rapid creation of this
new department and a heavy emphasis
‘gn the importance of energy questions
to our people.

We will also present to the American
people. probably at a joint scssion of
the Congress a speech by me about
April 20, a comprehensive energy poli-

which would involve all the com:

plexities of the energy question. It’s
something that's long overdue and it’s
Boing to be quite profound in its impact
On the American consciousness and our
society, and I hope it will be compre
hensive enough so that it can be well-
balanced and fair to all.
» We are quite concerned about the
Pressures of iniation, The advisers to
me on economics are trying to assess
all Government programs.and private
actions that contribute to inflationary
pressures. When this analysis is done

will use every means that I-havo
available to me to express ‘these con-
cerns and possibly corrective actions
tothe American people as well.

And the last. point is that we will
have 9. enmnlata; analycie nnderway
wow on deregulation. And the first
question is the deregulation of the eir

y lings. Legislation is in the Congress
now. We'll. be—submitting a~ message”

to Congress very shortly on that sub-
ject. We will not submit administration
gislation because the Congress has
already moved subst-ntially forward in
dealing with this important. issue.

‘And now I'd like to answer questions, .

Mr. Frank Cormier.
‘ Questions and Answers

fF k Defense Builget

*_ Q. Mr. President, you told the Demo-
tratic Platform. Committee that you
thought Present defense expenditures
could te reduced ‘by- five to seven bil,
lion dollars. Now I think you may have

Modified your position somewhat since

then. Obviously in. your. short time in
office you. didn’t find the opportunity
to make cuts like that in your precedes-
sor's budget. But isn't “it also likely
that next year’s budget for the defense
will exceed this year’s.

A. Well because of inflationary’pres-
sures ‘and because of an impossibility
of assessing the potential threat to our
vountry from other nations, it’s hard
to predict exactly what the level of
defense spénding will be. In the: short
time that we had available to work

"on the previous: Administration's budg-

et—about three weeks of hard work—
we were able to reduce the suggested
expenditures by almost $3 billion, I
think about $2.75 billion.

This was done—and I think Senator
Stennis in his recent public statements
has confirmed that it has been done
without weakening-our own defense
capability. And the substantial savings
in defense spending that will still leave
us muscle will be in such things as
the standardization of weapons, ‘long-
range planning, a mote businesslike al-
location of defense contracting, an as-
sessment’ of the defense contracts for
construction or repair already out-
standing.

A reassessment of priorities of the
evolution of new weapons which in the
future can become enormously expen-
sive; a longer assignment of military
personnel to a base before they are
transferred; some emphasis on the cor-
rection of inequities and unfairnesses
in the retirement system.

__ These things obviously can't be done
in three weeks, but they will be an
ongoing effort on my part. And I think
the 1979 budget, which will be my Ad-

ministration's firet hrAen

other natioris. ‘Sometimes “otter Gov
ernntents cooperate with us fully;
sometimes they don't.

But I'll try to be sure, and so will
Stan. Turner, who will be the next
director of the intelligence community.
He will try to be sure that every thing
we do is not only proper and legal,
but also compatible with the attitudes
‘of the American people.

One other point I'd like to make is
this. It can be extremely damaging to
our relationship with other nations, to
the potential security of our country
even in peacetime, for these kinds of
operations which are legitimate and
proper to be revealed. ft makes it hard
for us t0 lay a gruutid sone cat wits le
‘we might predicate a successful meet-
ing of a threat to us in time of war
if we don't have some degree of secre-
cy. ci

I'm quite concerned about the num-
ber of people now who have access
to this kind-of information: And I've
been workin very, closely with the
Congressional leaders, yesterday and

to trv to reduce.the overall num-

today,
- ber of people who have access to the

sources of information. that within the

bounds {hat T'ye.described—propriety-
‘and legalit; -and American attitudes to-

i And I'm
ing basis
a direct pe-sonal reponsibility for the
‘operation of all the ingelligence agen-
cies in our Government to make sure
that they are meeting these standards.

.. 3, Correcting Errors on C.LA.

Q. If there has been erroneous infor-
mation, wouldn't it behoove you to cor-
rect the record?

A. In'some ways we are correcting
the record, but if I began to either dis-
pute or confitm every individual story
that’s written whether correct or er-
Toneous on every matter relating. to
the C.LA, then these matters which
are necessarily secret would no tonger
be secret, so I’'m.not going to comment
on individual items that relate to intel-
ligence,

4, Difference With Meany

Q. Mr. President, George Meany says
he won't go along with your idea for
pre-notification on wage and price in-
creases. And my question really is, how
hard, are you going to press Mr, Meany
to go along and do you have anything
else in mind that you could use in the
way of Government involving itself to
try to control inflation? :

‘A. I announced earlier my firm com
mitment not to have mandatory. wage
and price Jaws or authority, not to have
“standby. wage and price authority. I've
not made any proposal to Mr, Meany
or ‘any other labor leader nor to any
representative of.industry or manufac
turing. But 1. will retain’ the option in
the future of assessing what we need
to do to control inflation.

I've emphasized always the word
“voluntary.” And to the extent that
I can arrive at a common understand-
ing with industry and labor leaders that
a certain amount of cooperation and
information can. be exchanged before
a major proposal is made. I think that's
a legitimate pursuit of mine. I can’t
force it. It's got to be voluntary. And
that’s as far as 1 can go with my an-
swer.

5, Wage-Price Guidelines
O. You mean iust directly about wage

even more brutal than the ones on
which we’ve commented up to now.

In Uganda the actions there have di:
gusted the entire civilized world and,
as you know, we have no diplomat
relationships with Uganda. But h« e is
an instance where both Ambassador
Andrew Young and I have expressed
great concern about what is there. The
British are now considering asking the
United Nations to go into Uganda to
assess the horrible murders that aypar-
ently are taking place in that country—
the persecution of those. who have
aroused the irc af Mr. Amin.

Ve exnrar st my concern ab © re
yrisoned ps wan avers an
Korea, in Cuba, in many countries —in
several countries, rather—in S aith
America and I'll continue to do so, I
have never had an inclination to single
out the Soviet Union as the only place
where human rights are béing abridged.

We have, J think, a respoiisibility and
a legal right to.express our disapproval
‘of violations of human rights, The Hel

sink sacar ot

these human rights shall'be preserved,
We are a signatory of the Helsinki
agreement. We are ourselves culpable
in somo ways for not giving people
adequate rights to move around our
country: or restricting unnecessarily, in
my opinian, visitation to this country
by those who disagree With us political-
ly,

So I think that we ell ought to take
a position in our own country and
among our friends and allies, among
our potential adversaries, that human
rights is something on which we should
bear a maior responsibility for leader.
ship. And 1 have made it clear to the
Soviet Union and to others in the East-
ern European community that I'm not
trying to launch a unilateral criticism
of them, that i'm trying to set a stand-
ard in our own country and make my
concems cxpressed throughout the
world, not singled out against any par-
ticular country.

Q. Mr. President, the other day. get-
ting back to this CLA. thing, when
that story broke your Press Secretary,
when he issued what amounted to a
“no comment” by the White House,
someone asked ‘him if this story had
broken back during the campaign when
you were running for Presiden’, v-ould
you have given a similar response? And
he said “well I don’t’know.” So can
Task you, what would have beer: you”
response?’ Would it have been the
same? A. I don’t know.

7. Review of C.LA. Activities

Q. Mr. President, on that same sub-
ject, you said earlier that you review
of C.LA. activities had found nothing
illegal or improper and you later said
that these activities are legitimate and
proper. Isn’t that a value judgment that
the American public might like to
share? But how can they if yor! refuse
to’ give them any idea of wuat you
hhave discovered dur'ag this review

Questions and Answers

1, Defense Budget :

.1-Q. Mr, President, you told the Demo-
tratic Platform. Committee that you
thought present defense expenditures
could be reduced ‘by: five to seven. bil-
lion dollars. Now I think you may have
modified your position somewhat since
then. Obviously in. your. short time in
‘office you. didn’t find the opportunity
to make cuts like that in your precedes-
sor’s budget. But isn’t it also likely
that next year’s budget for the defense
will exceed this year’s.
: A, Well because of inflationary ‘pres-
sures and because of an impossibility
of assessing the potential threat to our
country from other nations, it's hard
to predict exactly what the level of
Wefense spending will be. In the short
time that we had available to work
on the previous Administration's budg-
et—about three weeks of hard: work—
we were able to reduce the suggested
expenditures by almost $3 billion, 1
think about $2.75 billion.

This was done—and 1 think Senator
Stennis in his recent public statements
has confirmed that it has been done
without weakening-our own defense
capability. And the substantial savings
in defense spending that wilf still leave
us muscle will be in such things as
the standardization of weapons, song.

a direct personal reponsibility for the

cies in our Government to make sure
that they are meeting these standards.

3, Correcting’ Errors on C.LA.

if there has been erronéous infor-
mation, wouldn't it behoove you to cor-
rect the record?

4. In'some ways we are correcting
the record, but if I began to either dis-
pute or confirm every individual story:
‘that’s written whether correct or er-
roneous on every. matter relating. to

“the C.LA., then these matters whicl

‘are necessarily secret would no longer
be secret, so I'm.not going to comment
on individual items that relate to intel-
digence.

4, Difference With Meany

Q. Mr. President, George Meany says
he won't go along with your idea for
pre-notification on wage and price in-
creases. And my question really is, how
hard.are you going to press Mr, Meany
to go along and do you have anything
else in mind that you could use in the
way of Government involving itself to
try to control inflation?

‘A. I announced earlier my fitm com-
mitment not to have mandatory wage
and price laws or authority, not to have
‘standby wage and price authority. I've
not made any proposal to’ Mr, Meany
or any other labor leader nor to any
representative of, industry or manufac-
turing. But J. will retain the option in
the future of assessing what we need
to do to control inflation.

T've emphasized always the word
“voluntary.” And to the extent that
can arrive at a common understand
ing with industry and labor leaders that
a certain amount of cooperation and
information can be exchanged before
a major proposal is made. I think that's
a legitimate pursuit of mine. I can't
force it. It’s got.to be voluntary. And
that’s as far as I can go with my an-
swer.

5. Wage-Price Guidelines

Q. You mean just directly about wage
and price “guidelines” which might be
voluntary. How is that for an idea?

‘A, Well 1 think rigid. guidelines are
a mistake. If we said, for instance, that
no price increase or no wage increase
could exceed 6 percent this would be
too restrictive. It would be contrary
to my own philosophy of Government
and I think that because of the diversi-
ty of our society and the fact that it
is a free enterprise system, you've got
to have some flexibility.

But I'd prefer to deal with these
problems that. arise on’ increasing
prices on an individual bases and I also

he said “well I don’t‘know.” So can
Task you, what would have beer your
response? Would it have been the

7. Review of C.I.A. Activities

Q. Mr. President, on that same sub-
ject, you said earlier that you review
of C.LA. activities had found nothing
illegal or improper and you later said
that these activities are legitimate and
proper. Isn't that a value judgment that
the American public might like to
share? But how can they if you refuse
to’ give them any idea of wiat you
have discovered during this review
about payments, including ones nade
in secret?

A. That is a value judgment, It's made
by the independent Intelligence Over-
sight Board, which was established and
appointed ‘by President Ford. This
board has made itself available to the
Inspector General and to any employce

8, Problems With Congress

Q. Mr. President, Charles Kirbo, your
«friend Charles Kirbo seems to feel that
you're going to be having a continuing
Problem with. the Congress and that
you'll have to go over Congress's head
to the people in order to get results.
Is this true?
¢ A. I think if you read the whole
- statement that Mr, Kirbo made, which
is just a private citizen's opinion, he
= would say that every President has had
§ arguments and debates and disagree-
ments. with the Congress, And I think
"that's inevitable in our system of Gov-
ernment. That's part of the checks and
* balances that’s very precious to us:all.
T have found up to now a growing
sense of cooperation with the Congress.
I think Jast week when I was asked
roughly the same question. that the
troubles were perhaps underestimated
by the news media. I think now per-
“haps the troubles ‘with the Congress
‘are overestimated. I have frequent
{meetings with the Congressional lead-
Zers both Democratic. and Republican.
«And I think that the progress of the
b legislation that we consider to be cru-
Yeial which seemed to be moving very
slowly in the past is now speeding up.
So I don't believe that we'll have
nearly the problems with the Congress
that has been the case in recent years.
, And I have to say in summary that
Iam very pleased with my relationship
° with the Congress now.

assignment to Vice President Mondale
regarding the election laws, could you

ference on Foreign and Domestic Matterg:

the deregulation: of natural gas as a
part of an overall energy policy. By
April 20 I think we'll be prepared to

12. Energy Program Sacrifices

Q. Mr. President, we've been told that
the central thrust’ of your new energy
program - will involve sacrifice and
voluntary conservation, yet the public’s
always reading stories in.the paper of
how the major oil-companies are with-
holding natural gas. So I'd like to ask
how are you going to expect the public
to make sacrifices when there's such
widespread public suspicion about the
role of the oil companies in the energy
crisis.

A. I think the comprehensive nature
of the proposal that takes in all these
very disparate and sometimes  conflict-
ing elements at one time and a long-
range projection of our needs and a
tangible demonstration to. the Ameri:
can people, to the extent that I’m able
to put it forward, that there will he
direct ultimate benefits to them will
be the elements that will cause them
to make those sacrifices. At the same
time, I want to increase the surety that
we have that the reserve supply data
given to us by the oil companies and
others are accurate.

‘We are now conducting some admit-
tedly superficial studies by Secretacy
Cecil Andrus in Interior and also they’il
be followed uP, by more detailed studies
under Dr. Schlesinger, to see whether
or not the reserve supplies are ade-
quate and whether or not the oil com-
panies are giving us accijrate data. I
think it’s obvious to all of us that there
are some instances where natural gas
is withheld from the market. That’s
understandable. If I was running an
oil company I would reserve the right
to release or to reserve some supplies
of natural gas,

With the emergency’ legislation that
the Congress did pass, I think in about
a week of assessment during the frigid
part of the winter—it’s still very cold—
we were given some authority to buy
extra gas at a very high price. This
is obviously a transcient circumstance.

But I believe the American people
will be willing to make, the sacrifices
required, if they are convinced that fu-
ture reports will be accurate, that sup-
plies will not be withheld from the mar-
ket and if we can let the oil companies
know in a predictable way what. our
policy will be two moriths or two years
or-20 years in the future—within the
bounds of human reason—then | think
they'll be much less likely to withhold
supplies of oi! and natural. gas from
the market just hoping that they'll get
somé bonanza increased. price in the
future if the policies do change.

14. Rise in Gasoline Tax

Q. Another question, sir, on the sacri-

Q. Mr. President, I was a little unclear,
about what you're going to propose:

saying that you will propose to have

ito await further discussions with them-

‘indirectly, and also some tangible evi-
‘dence on our part that they are willing,

‘A. I don't know how to answer your

15. U.S. Ro!.: on Canada

Q. You said that in spite of the fact
that the. Canadian “:eople would have
to determine their future for them-
selves, particularly in regard to the
separatism issue in Quebec that you
had: confidence that the issue would
be straightened out relatively peaceful-
ly. Do you really think that there is
little concern in this country about the
future of a unified Canada and is there
anything really: that we can do about
it

A. There's a great deal of concern
in ‘this. country about the future of
Canada ‘and T have complete confi-
dence, as I said in an interview with
the Canadian news media in the sound
judgment of the Canadian people.

I'm familiar—and even more familiar

* today than I was two days ago after

Prime Minister Trudeau's visit—with
the problems in Quebec and the inclina-
tion of some of the French Canadians
to have an independent status from the
rest of Canadian Provinces.

T don't know what's going to be the
ultimate outcome. But I believe that
we are so closely tied together with
Canada on a mutually beneficial basis,

. sharing problems, sharing. opportuni-

ties, sharing trade, sharing manufactur-
ing companies that have joint owner-
ship, our exchange of ‘energy sources,
“our sharing of the St. Lawrence Sea-
way, the Great Lakes as far as water
pollution is concerned, the bringing of
Alaskan oil and natural gas down to
us that we have got to have a continu-
ing relationship with Canada,

‘My own personal preference would
be that the commonwealth stay as it
ig and that there not be @ separate
Quebec province But that’s a decision
for the Canadians to make and I would
certainly make no private or public
move to try to determine the outcome
of that great debate.

11. Defense Savings Goal

Q. In answer to an earlier question,
r, President, you said that you could-
t' say whether next year's defense
idget will be lower or higher than
ds year’s. But as I understood your
lier postion, you did want to achieve
five to seven billion ‘dollar savings
gardless of the overall level of spend-
g. Do you still hold with that figure?
that still your goal and a commit-
ent?

‘A. Yes. The analyses that -I've made
"the deferise budget so far—which

month’s study just part-time—indi-
ite that that’s a goal that will be
ached. :

15. U.S, Rol: on Canada

Q. You said that in spite of the fact
that the. Canadian “eople would have
to determine their future for them-
selves, particularly in regard to the
separatism issue in Quebec that you
had’ confidence that the issue would
be straightened out relatively peaceful-
ly. Do you really think ‘that there is
little concern in this country about the
future of a unified Canada and is there
Anything really: that we can do about

A. There's a great deal of concern
in this: country about the future of
Canada and I have complete confi-
dence, as I said in an interview with
the Canadian news media in the sound
judgment of the Canadian people.

T'm familiar—and even more famillar

“today than I was two days ago after

Prime. Minister Trudeau's. visit—with
the problems in Quebec and the inclina-
tion of some of the French Canadians
to have an independent status from the
rest of Canadian Provinces.

I don't know what's going to be the

ultimate outcome, But I believe that”

we are so closely tied together with
Canada on a mutually beneficial basis,
sharing «problems, sharing. opportuni-
ties, sharing trade, sharing manufactur
ing companies that have joint owner-
ship, our exchange of energy sources,
our sharing of the St. Lawrence Sea-
way, the Great Lakes as far as water
polhition is concerned, the bringing of

. Alaskan oil and natural gas down to

us that we have got to have a continu-

- ing relationship with Canada.

‘My own personal preference would
be that the commonwealth stay as it
is and that there not be a separate
Quebec province) But that’s a decision
for the Canadians to make and I would
certainly make no private or public
move to try to determine the outcome
of that great debate.

16. Keeping Campaign Promises

Q. Mr. President, you've had a month
now to enjoy: the view from the Oval
Office. Do you think you'll be able to
keep fully all the campaign promises
you made: Fe

A-As you know, we have issued what
I believe is the complete book of my
campaign promises, which is, I pre-
sume, being made available to all of
you. My determination is to keep all
those promises.

Obviously if circumstances should
change I would have to reserve the
tight to go back to the American people
and say “now that circumstances have
changed this a better approach to that
particular problem.” But I will do-my
utmost to keep all the campaign prom-
ises that I made to the American peo-

Raise Sub . wl Me

By Timothy S. Robinson
Washington Post staff Writer

The Central Intelligence Agency
has finally acknowledged publicly
that it was “involved” in the Glomar
Explorer's attempts to raise a sunken
Russian submarine from: the Pacific
Ocean floor, é

The terse acknowledgement came in
a court document filed in the U.S. ;
Court of Appeals .by the Justice De- :
partment two’ weeks ago. The docu-
ment asked that a suit against the |
CIA by a private group concerning
the Glomar's financing be sent back
to a lower court for further hearings.-

The filing marks an abrupt change
from the previous position taken by |
the Justice Department in the 18 |
month-old case that the mere acknowl- |
edgement of the CIA’s involvement in |
the project would ‘be harmful to na-
tional security. Although the. CIA’s
operation of the project has been re-
ported in numerous publications, the
agency has been adamant in its re-
fusal to say publicly whether those re-
Ports were true. oe

The case brought by the nonprofit |
Military Audit Project, which moni-
tors spending by the defense and in-
telligence establish ments, has in-
volved an unprecedented amount: of
secret court. proceedings as the CLA.
attempted to prove the need for sec- :

hard A. Gesell. The suit seeks the fi- |
nancial details of the Glomar project.

ously acknowledged only that the ship

For example, Gesell was forced to
issue a secret opinion in the case last ?
October that even the ‘attorneys in-*
volved still have not been able to
read, The opinion was issued in that
secret fashion upon direct orders of
the U.S. Court of Appeals, which in-
structed Gesell to accept secret affi- ;
davits from high-level government of-
ficials concerning the case. H
