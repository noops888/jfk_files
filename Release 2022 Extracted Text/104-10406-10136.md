3. DEFINITIONS

Within the context of this instruction, the definitions listed below will apply.
- Special note must be taken of the fact that the key term “operational use”
__ employed throughout this instruction has been defined in the most succinct
manner consistent with clarity. It has not been feasible; however, to cover in -
a definition the entire scope of possible variations in operational circumstances
which may be encountered in DDO activities. The definition of “operational
use” is intended to provide guidance for the majority of cases, and must be
employed with responsible operational judgment. Issues involving a deter-
mination of “operational use” which cannot be resolved with reasonable as-
surance by the responsible operating comporents will be referred to, the i
Deputy Director for Operations for decision. ie

dividual or group, responding to the direction or solicitation of a DDO

financial, material, or other support necessary for the accomplishment of
DDO operational objectives either directly or indirectly, to or for an ele-
ment of the Operations Directorate.
