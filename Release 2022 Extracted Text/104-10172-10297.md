1, We are sending under separa
fon the above subject written by Costille at the request of the Counselor
of Enbassy, We have never attempted to keep our contact with Golub unter
cover and have feriodically informed the Counselor of the status of this
contact. He has aprroved ani even encouraged thie contact and has sugcested
bringing in other Exbassy officials who might strike up frientships xith
Soviet officials other than Golub, :

2, At the most recent Colub-Costille lunch on 3 August, Golub again
hinted at an estrangecent between hinself and his wife, who is etill inthe
Soviet Union, He asked Costille if Costille could fix hir tp xith a Finnish
girl for some evening. Arrangecents have been made for a nicht on the town
this Saturday with Costille and date and Golub and a trusted Minnish girl

we are certain will give Golub a run for his money, All details will be in
the next pouch, The following information came out during this lunch, Solubd .
is a Comwunist Party member having this honor bestowed upon hia at the front /
during World Wer II, He also uentioned that practically ail Scviet diplceate |
were CP menbers, Golub was torn in Kharkov but spent most of his pre-kerld
War II life in Kiev. He considers Kiev to be the most beavtiful city in the
Soviet Union and is extremely proud of his Ukrainien backgrocad, Galub now
claims that for his next post he would prefer New York City. (This is a
reversal, ao Golub up to this point’ has told Costille that he sculd ret Like
an assignment in the U.S. because of the distance from Moscow.) When asked
why New York rather than the Soviet Embassy in Washington, he answered that
in New York he could be his own boss while in Weshington he wuld be tec much
under the thunk of the Anbassador, He did not eleborate on this ststenent,
However, he remarked that if assigned to the U.S, he would insist on im

tenaive English language training in Hoscows

3 We would like to elaborate’on Golub's “estrangenent™ fron his wife,
since this appears to be ebout his only vulnerability, Golub without
hesitation a number of times:has flatly stated that he is glad his wife is
on vacation in the Scviet Union dnd that he has been enjoying his freedoms
At the last lunch Costille asked him when his wife was returning. He answered
that he did not know and also that he did not care and intirated that she was
having @ good tine in Moscow “probably with some lover." However, we know
that he hears from his wife because Golub has mentioned she attended the U. So
exhibition in Moscow, Ske also phoned him on his birthday, 13 Aucust, from
gone vacation spot on the Black Sea, Golub has never intinated that she would
not be returning to Helsinki following her vacation, Colub has always made
these derogatory remarks about hie wife rather jokingly and never out of any
despondency, He seems to think these recarks will establish hia as “one of

tha boys,# :
