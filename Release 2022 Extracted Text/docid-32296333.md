JOSEPH VALACHI has advised that THOMAS GAGLIANO

resided at 168 Seminary Avenue, Yonkers, NY, and died of

natural causes about 1953 when he was

succeeded as "boss"

by THOMAS LUCHESE.

Files of the NYO reflect that in 1949 o0: HENRY

D. MULLER, a CI of the New Orleans (NO) Office, advised that

he had received information concerning one JOSEPH GAGLIANO

and THOMAS GAGLIANO who had opened a custom jewelry storc, in

New Orleans. The informant stated that it was his opinion

that the

store was

a front for some illegitimate enterprise.

не

advised that the GAGLIANOS were allegedly connected with

CARLOS MARCELLO and One HENRY BRNST, who was considered to

be an accomplished safe burglar in the southern part of the

country.

The records of the NOPD reflect that THOMAS GAGLIANO,

FBI #67129, NOPD #3196, and JOSEPH GAGLIANO, FBI #786311,

NOPD #3195, were Identical with the individuals operating

this

store.

Investigation is currently being conducted by

the NYO in the THOMAS LUCHESE matter to corroborate information

furnished by JOSEPH VALACHI. The Bureau will be immediately

advised upon receipt of corroborating information resolving

whether VINCENT ALO OF THOMAS GAGLIANO was the actual

predecessor of THOMAS LUCHESE.
