JOSEPH VALACHI has advised that THOMAS GAGLIANO
resided at 168 Seminary Avenue, Yonkers, NY, and died of
natural causes about 1953 when he was succeeded as "boss"
by THOMAS LUCHESE,

Files of the NYO reflect that in 1949 mc? HENRY
D. MULLER,: a CI of the New Orleans’ (NO) Office, advised that
he had received information concerning one JOSEPH GAGLIANO
and THOMAS GAGLIANO who had opened a custom jewelry storo.in
New Orleans. The informant stated that it was his opinion
that the store was a front for some illegitimate enterprise.
He advised that the GAGLIANOS were allegedly connected with
CARLOS MARCELLO and one HENRY ERNST, who was considered to
be an accomplished. safe burglar in the southern part of the
country. The records of the NOPD reflect that THOMAS GAGLIANO,
FBI #67129, NOPD #3196, and JOSEPH GAGLIANO, FBI #786311,
NOPD #31955 were identical with the individuals operating
this store.

Investigation is currently being conducted by
the NYO in the THOMAS LUCHESE matter to corroborate information
furnished by JOSEPH VALACHI, The Bureau will be immediately
advised upon receipt of corroborating information resolving
whether VINCENT ALO or THOMAS GAGLIANO was the actual
predecessor of THOMAS LUCHESE,
