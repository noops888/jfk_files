Hugh C. McDonald, President
406 Wilshire Boulevard DCS Case 52872
Suite 203

Santa Monica, Calif. 90401

1. Interviewed 23 Apr 69, Hugh C. McDonald, a cleared DCS source,
informed that there appeared to be a misunderstanding in connection with
hie visiting Washington. First, he does not plan on going to Washington
himself; a representative from the Chicago Office is goiog for the purpose
of meeting with the Financial Group Company. Next, McDonald said he has
not offered to demonstrate his Voice Ident System. Finally, he does not
Plan a “vorld tour". Rather, sometime this Fall he plans on visiting
bankers aad government security people in various Latin American countries.
He will return to the US; then, later on, visit various European countries.
Again he will return to the US and then visit various Far Eastern countries.
His.purpose in making these trips is to sell. Hughes helicopters to foreign
police departments combined with possible sale of his check cashing security
system to banking institutions. :

"2. McDonald will inform DCS/LAFO of his travel plans when they are
firmed up.

°3.. McDonald is willing to go ‘to Washington, D.C. himself on 8-9
May and eeet with TSD/ORD people there to "discuss" his Voice Ident
‘System, but he is not prepared to do so unless TSD/ORD have sone
specific problems which his system will help solve. Hé feele otherwise
it would be a waste of time. .2~

‘&, The above discussed with DCS/OSS (Musulin) 29 Apr 69. It was
‘decided that éince-eaD. (Carrick) has been in contact with McDonald

Previously that Carrick’ discuss the possible meeting on the Voice “z

IdentSystem directly with McDonald. J

: 5. McDonald was {aforned 29 April to expect a call from( Carricks”
as . that DCS/LAFO would follow up later concerning his travels abrodd.

1. In response to a request from Mr. Killgore, on the staff of

Senator Barry Goldwater (K., Ariz.), I met with Mr, Hugh C. McDonald
at the Madison Hotel this afternoon, MeDonald explained that ho is in
the banking and security business, having previously worked in the

Les Angelos County Sheriff's Office. He also said he had a contractual
relationchip with the Agency some years ago and served as chief of

cecurity for Senator Goldwater during bis campaign for the presidency
in 1953,

i 2. Mr. McDonald taixed thie morning with Senator Coldwater
about his taterest in- meeting with zomesne from tho Agency to. discuss

. 8 Feport which he kae prepsred on the aubject of highly sencitive Soviet

bacteriological warfare activitics on the island of Vogrozkdeniya in the
Aval Sea. . MeDonald eaid he originally bocame aware of the existence

of tho secret Sovict activity in thio locality while in Europe on a business
trip. Ho decided to follow it up and wae referred from one contact to
another until he wao virtually at the Russian border and decidod he had
Anveatigated tho matter as far as ho felt be could without the possibility
of personal risk. McDonald pointed ont that the infarmation (n hie report
was obtained from sources who apoke freely to him without any romuncra-
tion whatsoevor. , He added that he understood from seme_of his sources
that thay had been in touch with the Agency or with U.S. intelligonce
reprosentatives and had become reluctant to deal further with thece
representatives because they were not treated properly by them and

the sources feared the Agency had been penetrated by Soviet agents.

3. The reasons for McDonald's contact with us are threefold;

a. After preparing the 6S-page report (a copy of which
be gavo me) he became concerned that publication of this
document right not be in the rational interest, He is anxious
for our advice on this. .

b. He ie interested in knowing whether the information

to delve further into this matter,

_ 4. With regard to the possible publication ef the report, McDonalé
acid he planned to talk in very general torms this afternoon wth repre.
sentatives of Time/Life., He will make no commitments to'them and
will treat his meeting ae strictly exploratory. It ig MeDonald's opinion
