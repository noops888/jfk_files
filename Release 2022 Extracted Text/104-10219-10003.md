30 April 1969

DCS Cage S2872

1. Interviewed 23 Apr 69, Hurh C. McDonald, a cleared DCS source,

Informed that there appeared to be a misunderstanding in connection with

his vis1ting Hashlagton.

Pist, he does not plan as going to Washington

himself; a representative from the Chicago Office 1s going

for the purpose

of meeting with the Pinancial Group Company. Next, McDonald sald he has

not offered to demonstrate his Volce Ident System.

Finally, he does not

plan a "world tour".

Rather, sometime this fall he plans on visiting

bankers sod government security people in various Latin American countries.

He will return to the US; then, later on, vioit various European countries.

Agalo he vill returo to the US and then visit various far Eastero countries.

His purpose in making these trips 18 to sell. Hughes belicopters to foreign

police departments combined with possible sale of his check cashing security

systen to banking lastitutions.

2. McDonald will Inform DCS/LAFO Of hia travel plans when they are

firmed up.

*3.. McDonald is willing to 80 to Washington, D.C. himself on 8-9

May and beet with ISD/ORD people there to "'discuss" his Voice Ident

System, but he is not prepared to do so unless ISD/ORD have sobe

specific problems bich his system will help solve. He feels otherwise

It would be a waste of elopies?

'I. The above discussed with DCS/OSS (Musulin) 29 Apr 69. It wa8

decided that since OBD. (Carrick) has been in contact with McDonald

previously that CarIlck discuss the possible meeting on the Voice

Ident System directly wich McDonald.

McDonald vas Inforned 29 April to expect a call frow Carticks

that DES/LAFO would follow up later concerning his travels abroad.

the Chicago Office is goiaz for the purpose

of necting with the Financial Group Company. Next, Medonald said he has

pot offered to demonstrate his Voice Ident Systen.

Finally, he does not

plan a "world tour".

Rather, sozetime chis Fall he plans on visitiag

bankers and government security people in various latin Aerican cousirles.

He will return so the US; then, lacer on, visit various European countries.

Again he will return to the US and then visit various Far Eastern couatries.

His purpose in making these trips is to sell Hughes helicopters to foreign

•police departnents combined with possible sale of his checà cashing security

systen. to banking institutions.

452.

McDonald will inform DCS/LAFO of his travel plans when they are

firred up.
