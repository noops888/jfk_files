only five photostat copies of the letter could be obtained and these

2. The first two paragraphs of the letter to subject confirm
previous information that ATKINSON is married and is the father of a

marked "FLUSHING. N.Y. ‘NOV 27. 1130 AM. 1957", shows subject as

4. The writer of the letter, Margaret RICHTER, has not previously”
come to our notice and, to date, we do not know her connection with the
ATKINSON family. The letter creates the impression that they have not
met-in the past and we intend to contact the US Army CIC and request
that they make enquiries in the USA regarding the RICHTER fanily.

background information on subject.
