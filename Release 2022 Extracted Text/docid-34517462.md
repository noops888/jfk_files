â€¢ Attached at Annexure I to this report is a typed

reproduction of a letter written to subject by a person living in the

UNITED STATES Of AMERICA.

(NOTE: Owing to paper shortage a total of

only five photostat copies of the letter could be obtained and these

are enclosed with the report for distribution as may be deemed

necessary.

However,

we have the microfilm negative should higher

authority request: further photostats.

2.

The first two paragraphs of the letter to subject confirm

previous information that ATKINSON is married and is the father of a

daughter.

The address on the envelope of the letter, which was post-

marked "FLUSHING. N.Y. NOV 27. 1130 AM. 1957", shows subject as

living at BAUTZEN, Heringstrasse 27 and NOT 26 as previously reported.

4.

The writer of the letter, Margaret RICHTER, has not previously

come to our notice

and, to date, we do not know her connection with the

ATKINSON family.

The letter creates the impression that they have not

net'in the past and we intend to contact the US Army CIC and request

that they make enquiries in the USA regarding the RICHTER family.

It would be of assistance to us in our enquiries, 1f G (INT)

could be requested

to forward to us any information they may haw

regarding ATKINSON's contacts in the USA and any other availa

background information on subject.

6.

No additional information is, at present, available, but

enquiries are continuing and a further report will be submitted ao

soon as new information is received.
