MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Lee Harvey OSWALD
OS#351 164

1. On 22 March 1977 Gary M..-LONNQUIST, Office of
Communications, and the undersigned met during a social
engagement (a party in his honor prior to his PCS to
Manilay. During social conversations, \LONNQUIST: mentioned
an incident which occurred in the Security. Records D#vision
file room relating to the OSWALD security files. (ONNQUIST.
was subsequently interviewed by the undersigned and Jerry
Brown, Deputy Chief, Security Analysis Group, on 23 March
1977 in the Security Analysis Group, Room 3E49, and CLONN-
QUIST related substantially the following. _

2. Sometime between May 1975 and January 1976 while
an Office sf Security employee assigned to the Security
Records Division file room, ‘LONNQUIST\ was requested to
search SANCA in the name of Lee Harvey OSWALD. This request
was in connection with a Freedom of Information case involving
OSWALD, and LONNQUIST believed that Joyce HOWARD, also
assigned to the Security Records Division, made the request.
This search met with positive results, thus making LONNQUIST:
aware of the fact that OSWALD's name was entered in SANCA.

3. Subsequently, LONNQUIST came across a file which
he described as relating to OSWALD, and he intended to file
same.with the rest of the OSWALD files on the shelf. <LONNS
<QUIST described this file as covert, thin, and having a :
higher file number than the rest of the OSWALD holdings.
He could not remember the name which appeared on the outside
of the file but thought that it may have been one of OSWALD's
akas. He further related that he looked inside the file and
believed that it was related to, or possibly identical with,
the regular OSWALD holdings. While attempting to refile this
covert file, he observed that all of the regular OSWALD
holdings were permanently charged to the Security Analysis
Group; thus he believes he sent the covert file to the
Security Analysis Group.

4. Later, LONNQUIST again queried SANCA in the name
which he saw on the covert file but found no record.
Perturbed, he queried Francis DAVIS (Indices Chief) as to
why he could find no record in the name of a file which he
knew existed. He specifically asked DAVIS if the name
(which he_cannot remember now) could have been erased from
SANCA. DAVIS! replied that she did not think that was
possible.._He then apprised John BOLLINGER of the above,
since BOLLINGER had processed the OSWALD Freedom of Infor-
mation Act request. ®OLLINGER made unknown inquiries for
some three to four hours concerning the possible erasure ~
of a name from SANCA and finally told {ONNQUIST that there
was nothing to worry about, that he (BOLLINGER) took care
of the matter. (LONNQUIST also_advised that he made his
immediate supervisor, Chuck TACKETT, aware of the incident.
iLONNQUIST advised that he heard nothing further concerning
the incident but privately harbored doubts about the’ resolu-
tion of the incident. He mentioned that he entertained
thoughts of reporting the incident to the Inspector General
but has not discussed it with anyone subsequently until he
apprised the undersigned on the night of 22 March 1977.

5. WONNQUIST was advised by the Deputy Chief, Security
Analys that the Security Analysis Group would make
the in ent a matter of official concern and would begin
immediate inquiries. ‘LONNQUIST was cautioned not to vocalize
allegations regarding possible erasures of SANCA entries or
possible illegal destruction of official files. However,
he was told that he was perfectly Cree to bring the entire
matter up with the Inspector General if he felt it necessary.
