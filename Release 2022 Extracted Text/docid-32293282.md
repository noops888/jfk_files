ARCURI stated that he surmised that Mrs. GUTERMA had

apparently brought something very valuable from las

Vegas

to New York and that he was going to get it. ARCURI and

•AL CIMEI left and picked up JOSEPH CIMEI,-uncle of AL CIMEI.

At 11 o'clock that night, AL CIMEI called JEANNE and they

discussed the contents of a valise and decided that it

contained stock.

Later she learned that JOSEPH CIMEI and

PHILIP ARCURI went to the GUTERMA apartment and gained entrance

and carried out certain valuables.

AL CIMEI waited downstairs

in the pink Buick but because GUTERMA knew him and the Buick,

he became scared and took off. After the robbery, ARCURI and
