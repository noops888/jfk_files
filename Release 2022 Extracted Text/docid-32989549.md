. On 10/23/75, I was interviewed by two members of the Senate
Select Committee, Mrs. Mary DeOreo and Mr. Mark Gitenstein, at the Dirksen
Building in the office of the Senate Select Committee. The interview began at 7
10:30 a.m. and ended at Noon. I was not advised of anything pertaining to my :
rights.

The following are questions asked and the answers I gave, to the
best of my recollection:

pevareg en eet sane aeaeeee

QUESTION: When you went to the platform that morning ~ was it the day after
Mr. Hoover died, or two days later?

ANSWER: I can't remember,

QUESTION: On that particular morning in question, what did you do?

ANSWER: I went out to the platform and I found the truck sitting funny and I
wasn't sure if I had a flat tire or what. I checked the rear tires, but
found the tires were up so that I figured something was on the truck.

I can't remember if the truck was locked or what, but when I opened the
truck it was loaded with cabinets from front to back. I questioned my
supervisor, Tony Codi, ahout the cabinets on the truck. To his knowledge
he didn't know where they came from. He went around to the front office
to check and was told that the cabinets were te go to Mr. Hoover's house.

QUESTION: Who gave Codi the message to take the cabinets out to Mr. Hoover's .
house? i

ANSWER: It could have been Mr. Marsden or Mr. Gregory. I don't know which.
Tony double checked to find out who was going out to Mr. Hoover's house
after I questioned him if the moving crew was going. I was told there would
be no one going, but there would be a car following the truck.

QUESTION: Did you recognize the car or did you see it?

ANSWER: I couldn't tell the car from any other car out there in the street.

QUESTION: Did the car beat you to the house?

ANSWER: I didn't know if the car beat me there or not because there were other
cars parked there.

QUESTION: Where were the cabinets unloaded?

ANSWER: They were unloaded at the side gate. Rr)

any of them - were they Agents or what?

QUESTION: Were they dressed in suits?

ANSWER: No.

QUESTION: Were the file cabinets full or what did they contain?

ANSWER: I didn't know. All I knew was that they were heavy, that they contained
some type of file because while I was unloading one of the cabinets a drawer
fell open and I almost fell off the truck. They were manila type. light in
color.

QUESTION: Were they regular movers or what that helped you move the @binets?

‘ANSWER: No, because they were inexperienced in moving cabinets because I had
to show them everything.

to her office to make a run out to the house to pick up some mail and I was
told I had to take some other things out there and as we were walking along
she kept asking the same question over and over again - did I mind going
out to the house, and I told her no. When we got to the outer office there
were about 15 to 20 cases of soda. I was told to get a handcart to load the
sodas and to get a car. I told her if I had known that I had to take the sodas
out I would have brought a small truck around. She told me, "In other words,
you don't want to go out to the house." I told her I did not say that. Iwas
told "You can report back downstairs" and I told her that was perfectly all
right with me. I reported the incident to my supervisor, Mr. Gregory.

QUESTION: Did you see Miss Gandy anymore after that?

ANSWER: Yes, I had to take her to the doctor and the next time was out at !
Mr. Hoover's house.

made of my rights or that any statement that I might make was

Set forth below and as best I can recall is a series
of questions asked by mentioned SSC Staff representatives and my

STAFF REP. - You were Chief Clerk in the Washington Field Office
in June, 1972?

DUDNEY - Yes, that is right.

STAFF REP. - How long were you Chief Clerk in the Washington
Field Office?

DUDNEY - I was officially appointed to the position of Chief
Clerk approximately November 1, 1969, position I
an held until July 21, 1975. :

STAFF REP. - Mr. Dudney, wha is your recollection of being
contacted by Mr. Kunkel concerning the destruction
of material and when did that occur?

DUDNEY - Before we proceed, could I review my statement given
in early or mid-June of this year?

STAFF REP, - Yes - (statement reviewed)

DUDNEY - Concerning time and contact with Mr. Kunkel. As
best I can recall Mr. Kunkel appeared in my office,
Room 538 of the Old Post Office Building, one morn-

: ing about two weeks after the death of Mr. Hoover and

HE POR ney “commented that he was leaving the office and would

“STAFF REP. - Did you meet Mr, Kunkel at the loading dock?

DUDNEY - Yes,
STAFF REP, - What did you see and what were your instructions? §
DUDNEY ~ I observed 4 or 5 maybe 6 boxes in a sealed condition

and was told that either I or Mr. Shaffer (Asst. Chief
Clerk) was to personally destroy the contents. I

L was not told what the boxes contained or where they
came from.

STAFF REP. - Was anyone else with ifr. Kunkel?

DUDNEY - Yes, as I stated in my FD-302 I believe it was

4 Mr. Battle; however, I wasn't that concerned with who
was accompanying Mr. Kunkel. It could have been
Mr. Dowling, I just don't recall for sure.

STAFF REP. - What did you do with. these boxes?

DUDNEY - I loaded them on a dolly, took them to the 5th floor
of- the Oid Post Office Bidg. and secured them in a
vault until after working hours. We were not able
to run the disintegrator until after i hours
due to the noise factor.

STAFF REP, - Is there a disintegrator at FBI Headquarters?
DUDNEY - I believe there is.

STAFF REP, - Why do you think it was decided that the machine at
the Washington Field Office should be used?

DUDNEY - I really don't know - I can only assume that it was
for convenience purposes as I believe the Headquarters
disintegrator was located in the FBI Identification
Division then locatedon 2nd Street,:, S. W., WDC.

STAFF REP, - Did you destroy or participate in the destruction of
the material’ contained in the boxes you refer to?

DUDNEY - Yes, Mr. Shaffer and I worked together on it.

When was this material destroyed?

Mr. Shaffer and I destroyed the bulk of the material
after regular working hours of the day it was delivered
to me by Mr. Kunkel. We did not finish as . had to q
meet my carpool and Mr. Shaffer had other commitments:
We returned the remainder of this material to the

vault for purpose of securing it overnight and com-
pleted the destruction the following morning.

What did you see when you opened the boxes for
destruction?

Material which appeared to be personal papers 3f

Mx. Hoover and wet appeared to be nothing more than
bank statements, records relating to stock holdings,
etc. I do recall seeing one communication from
someone, I don't recall who, expressing appreciation
to Mr. Hoover for his appearance and comments before
some group, the name-of which I can't recall.

Did you see any documents or records with holes
punched in them?

No.

Did it appear that anyone had gone through these
records?

I saw no items that were torn or defaced. Every-
thing appeared loosely placed and intermingled in
the boxes.

Did you see any index cards?

No.

Did you see any other records?

No.

Were you ever contacted again by Mr. Kunkel and
asked to meet him, or did he tell’ you he was leaving

the office and that you should meet him upon return?

he left the office or upon return where he had been?

No.

Did you ever discuss this matter with anyone other
than Shaffer?

No.

Did Mr. Kunkel contact Mr. Shaffer subsequent to this
one occasion for the purpose of picking up and
destroying additional, material?

J don't know.

You stated earlier that on 4 or 5 subsequent occasions
Mr. Shaffer was called upon to meet Mr. Kunkel for
purpose of picking up and destroying additional
material, is this right?

No. I think there must be some misunderstanding. I
stated that I received 4 o¢ 5 maybe 6 boxes of
material from Mr. Kunkel.

Did Mr. Kunkel, subsequent to this one occasion,
contact Mr. Shaffer either personally or py telephone?

Yes - Mr. Kunkel was in frequent contact with

Mr. Shaffer both personally and telephonically. The
mere nature of assignments and work required frequent
contact.

Were any boxes ever stored in the attic of the Old
Post Office Bldg.?

Not to my knowledge - I think any-reference to
storage may relate to the one time I placed the 4 or
5 boxes in the vault until after working hours.

Mr. Shaffer and 1.

Concerning units 1 and 2 above, they asked what basic
duties they performed and were advised that they primarily
prepare charts, trial models and other two-dimensional and
three-dimensiconal items for investigative assistance and/or trial
use.

Mr. Gitenstein indicated that they were aware that
immediately after the death of Mr. Hoover in 1972, I was involved
in making arrangements for the funeral service and the burial,
and was thus away from the building most of the time. They asked
if employees of the Section packed any items in the Director's
Office after his death. They were informed that some employees
did assist in packing and that to my knowledge, this consisted
of items which were hung on the wall of the corridor leading into
his office such as award certificates and plaques presented to
Mr. Hoover over the years. We had an interest in these for
historical purposes particularly with reference to possible use
on the tour route for the new building.

assignments prior to being assigned to Quantico. I informed
them that Tt was not, They asked if I made arrangements for

in the negative, they asked who did this and I stated I presumed
it would have to be Mr. Hoover‘s secretary or somebody in his
office. They asked what association I had with Mr. Hoover's
drivers, and I told them that the Exhibits Section was responsible
for the good operating condition of the Bureau's armored cars
and that the drivers were acquainted with its safe operation.

Was there any destruction of material after the
first week of July?

No.

Knowing that the Bureau had its own disintegrating
facilities, why de you think Mr. Kunkel was requested
to handle the destruction of the material?

Prior to Mr. Kunkel's becoming a Special Agent, he
was a Clerical Employee assigned to the Director's
office. Miss Gandy may have requested his assistance

in the destruction of Mr. Hoover's personal papers.

The material was that of a prominent deceased

No, we have employees assigned this duty.

BY SSG STAFF MEMBERS.

Answer: Yes, I did.

Question: How did this affect you?

Answer: It really did not affect me. It became a private
4oke between Me, Dudney and myself in that we
may have mde the newspapers, but did not realize
Wervere or would ever be involved.

Question: Did you read an article in "Time" or "Newsweek"
xelative to the destruction of material from the
office of Mr. Hoover?

Answer: Wo sir, I did not.

Question: Did you discuss this matter with anyone?

Answer? No, I did not.

The interviewer emphatically stated that I did
discuss the matter at the time I was interviewd

as reflected by the copy of FD-302 in his possession.
(I stated that I thought he was referring to a
possible discussion with personnel assigned to

the Washington Field Office.)

There may have been other questions asked of me;
however, as stated above these are the questions I can recali.

Reference is made to a telephone call from. an SSC staff
member on November 17, 1975, to a Special Agent of the FBI regard-
ing this Bureau's discontinued Counterintelligence Programs (Cointelpros).

The SSC staff member raised questions as to whether two
suggested Cointelpro actions had been authorized and implemented,
These actions are as follows:

1, By letter dated March 8, 1965 (file reference
100-3+104-34~1001), the FBI New York Office suggested action be
taken concerning a Communist Party, USA, printing press to be
obtained from a foreign communist country. This action was not
authorized or implemented,

2, By letter dated October 13, 1970 (file reference
100~449698-985),. the FBI Detroit Office made inquiry regarding the
possible use of a foul-smelling chemical for Cointelpro purposes,
Attached is a copy of a FBI Detroit Office letter dated October 23,
1970, withdrawing the initial request, This action was _ authorized

Rez Interview of Former Deputy Assistant
Director Paul O'Connell by SSC Staff Member

“He stated Special Agent (SA) Paul Daly was aware of
their interest in interviewing me and suggested I contact Daly.
Tt did so and on the morning of November il, 1975, I came to
the Bureau and spoke to SAs Daly and Elmer Larson, 5A Larson
stated the Bureau had furnished the Committee various documents
regarding mail opening programs. I told him the only program
I was aware of was that involving mail from the Chinese
Mainland, SA Larson and SA Daly stated that my appearance
was voluntary and that if I felt I wanted to exercise my
Fifth Amendment rights, the Department of Justice could
be requested to secure an attorney for me, They stated
that the Bureau had no objection to my appearing or to my
admitting my knowledge of the Chinese mail opening program,

"Z thereafter met with Mr. Dick at approximately
3:15 p.m. that day, November 11, 1975. While I met Mr. Dick
at the Dirksen Office Building, the interview was conducted
with Mr. Dick in a room at thé former Carroll Arms Hotel. Only
Mr. Dick was present. He advised me that my appearance and
discussion was voluntary, that I had the right to an attorney,
etc. I told him that I had been given clearance from the
Bureau to discuss the mail epening program and that I would
answer any questions he mighk have. He stated there had been
three programs; SAM, GHIPROP and CHICLET, and he desired to
know of my knowledge of these programs, I told him that very
frankly the number of years that had elapsed prevented me from
recognizing the names of the programs, but I was aware that the
San Francisco Office had a program for the opening of mail from
the Chinese Mainland, Whether it was also opening mail to the
Chinese Mainland I did not recall. He showed me documents
regarding the programs which had been furnished the Committee
by the Bureau. These were, apparently, semi-annual justification
letters for the CHIPROP and CHICLET programs. He asked whether
I had recalled having approved any of these communications going
to the Bureau. I stated I could not recall, He noted that my
initials did not appear on the copies that he possessed.

Rex Intetview of Farmer Deputy Assistant
Director Paul O'Connell by SSC Staff Menber

"ith respect to my knowledge of these programs,
I explained that the ASAC was involved with the administrative
as well as investinative onerations of the office and that
once a program was instituted, the officials of the office
would not be knowledgeable of the day-to-day operations of the
program, but that any chanses in procedures, eb¢., would be
approved by supervisory officials. He asked which desk would
have supervised the Chinese mail opening program. I told him
that to my recollection it was the espionage squad, supervised
by Kichard Fietcher.

: “He asked for a vundown on my assignments in the Bureau
from the mid~1950's to the present, which I outlined for hin.
Iie requested the names of the SACs during my assignment to the
San Francisco Office, which I furnished. He then asked that I
describe the administrative setup of the office. As this did
not involve mail opening, I decided te telephonically contact
He. Gresar at Bureau Headquarters to see if there was any
objection to answering this and he said there was none. “1
then explained that in addition to the SAC and the ASAG, there
were approximately 12 desks (squads) including the night
supervisory desk and that there were three security squads:
the espionage squad, and two internal security squads. He
requested the names of the supervisors of these squads and i
informed him that the supervisor of the espionage squad was
Richard Fletcher, and that Harry Clifford and Glem Harter
were supervisors of the internal security squads. He asked
if the two internal security supervisors handled the sane
work and I told him I thought the breakdown was that one
handled organizations and the other individuals.

“Mr. Dick stated that they desired this information for
background information as the Bureau has acknowledged the existence
o£ the program and had furnished copies of various documents. He
said that there would be no more hearings by the Committee con-
cerming mail openings and that he anticipated the Committee vill
complete its work in February. The interview concluded at
approximately 4:00 p.m."

We know U. S. is prime target of Chinese Communist hitelligence.

; Dear Mr. Attorney General:

In my letter to you of August 28, 1975, concerning
Committee document requests, I said that we did not want
the DeLoach memoranda of August 24-27, 1964 (concerning
the 1964 Democratic National Convention daily summaries
from DeLoach to Walter Jenkins) at that time.

Because of the present posture of our investigation,
I am now requesting delivery of legible, unexcised copies
of these memoranda by Friday, November 14, 1975. I under-
stand that the FBI has compiled and readied these documents
for delivery and that the only delay in delivery concerns
my sending this request to you, since it does relate to,

the August 28 request. “] :

August 22-28, 1964

Monday, Aucust 24 1964

: On Sunday morning, August 23, 1964, we located a truck on Pacific

Avenue carrying < burned-out car, a liuge burlip-wrapped cross and a large church
-bell, Rumors.swept Atlantic City that the car was actually the one used by Schwerner,
Goodman and Chaney. Shortly after its appearance this truck was placed on a parking
lot close by Convention Hall. We quickly established the fraudulency of these rumors
and through police contacts we thwarted the racial group's plans to parade this burned
car through Atlantic City streets,

On Monday, we furnished Mr. Jenkins details regarding the plans of
CORE, the American Nazi Party, the Student Non-violent Coordinating Committee and
initial plans of the MFDP.

Appropriate officials were notified of the intention of the Negro racia
groups to establish a silent vigil on the boardwalk at the main entrance to Conventicn
Hall, This vigil was to be maintained until a report was issued by the Credentials
Committee regarding the seating of the MFDP delegates. :

Tuesday, August 25, 1964

Jenkins was advised that Martin Luther King had prevailed upon Ba:
Rustin to come to Atlantic City that day. We alerted White House representativ es
regarding compromise proposals for seating of the MFDP and furnished. them i

Democratic National Convention
August 22-28, 1964

Dick Cregory, through ACT, was attempting to promote a stall-in to block access to
Convention Hall, One of our key informants was instructed by Gregory to plan this
demonstration and through our control of him we were able to completely thwart

In consultation with Convention planners, we pointed out serious gaps
| in controlling admission to Convention Hall which had permitted entrance of dissident

elements on the Convention floor. ‘Jenkins immediately placed these recommendations
into effect, 7 pane -

Thursday, August 27, 1964 : : a

We determined Martin Luther King and his staff were departing from
Atlantic City early Thursday morning, and appropriate officials were advised of this.
We also reported efforts of CORE-SNCC leaders to secure uniforms of the Young
Citizens for Johnson groups and to utilize them for gaining entrance into Conyention
Hall. We were able to report that the number of participants of the silent vigil would
dwindle rapidly, Although the demonstrations quieted down Thursday night, we were
heavily involved in checking out the reports that a four-man group of Puerto Rican
terrorists from New York were in Atlantic City in an attempt to assassinate the
i President.

You are probably right that it is fT legal-to maintain
these records under the Privacy Act as indicated in your
memo of November 7, 1975. Doug Marvin is right that.the
Senate has requested us to keep them as suggested in his
memo of November 11, 1975. Congress obviously is wrong
in its contrary instructions on the subject. Why don't
we deposit them bodily in the respective laps of Scott and
Mansfield and let them make up their minds, if any?

xeferenced letter is a copy of the C. D, Deloach memorandum to
Mr, Mohr dated August 29, 1964, captioned "Special Squad,
Atlantic City, New Jersey, Democratic National Convention,
August 22-Asgust 28, 1964," and its enclosures which represent
1964 DNC daily summaries submitted at that time to White House
Aide, Mr. Walter Jenkins.

With respect to the exelsions in materials being
delivered herewith, where no notation appears as to reason
for excision, the excision was made for the reason that the
information actually summarizes or quotes from conversations
monitored during electronic surveillances of Martin Luther
King, Jr, In some cases, it can be ascertained precisely what
information in FBI files came from electronic surveillances
of Kings however, there exist areas where documentation of the
information is not precise and no accurate determination can
be madee Therefore, no assurances can be given that portions

A of the materials being furnished do not contain information
wh developed as a resuit’of electronic surveillances of King.

opportunities for penetration of key dissident groups in Atlantic City and to suggest

counter measures for any plans to disrupt the Convention. ee Ot 7

Our informant coverage worked particularly well, With Bureau approval, |
I instituted coverage similar to that on King and Rustin on CORE-SNCC headquarters at
their Atlantic Avenue meeting hall. Qur Negro undercover agents-successfully
penetrated the headquarters of the MFPD delegation at the Gem Motel and the head~
quarters for their strategy meetings, which was located in the basement of the Union

Baptist Temple Church. bes d ete

Additionally, we utilized a highly successitV cover through cooperation
of the National Broadcasting Company (NBC). Robert Nort

; As an example, one of our "reporters" was able to gain the confidence of Aaron
Henry, Robert Moses, James Farmer, Dick Gregory and Jesse Gray, the notorious
Harlem riot leader. Our "reporter" was so successful, in fact, that Henry was giving

him "off the record information" for background purposes, which he requested our
"reporter" not to print.

One of our Negro undercover agents successfully established contact
with Dick Gregory Saturday night, Aucust-22nd, and maintained this relationship
throughout the course of the entire Convention. By midweek, he had become one of
Gregory's confidants. This, of course, proved to be a highly valuable source of
{| intelligence since Gregory was constantly trying to incite racial groups to violence.

DISSEMINATION OF INFORMATION:

During our Convention coverage, we disseminated 44 pages of
intelligence data to Walter Jenkins, Attached for your information is a copy of these
daily summaries, Additionally, I kept Jenkins and Moyers constantly advised by
telephone of minute by minute developments. This enabled them to make spot decisions
and to adjust Convention plans to meet potential problems before serious trouble
developed.

In connection with communications, as you know, we arranged for a
leased line between the Bureau and our control post in Atlantic City. We also
established a private line for exclusive use by our informants, Appropriate code names
were arranged and informants dispatched from other cities and Newark informants used
this phone to submit their oral reports. This post was, of course, manned on a
24-hour basis.

RE: Special Squad, Atlantic City, New Jersey

Democratic National Convention
August 22-28, 1964

During the period when the Convention was actually in progress, we
established a secondary command post at the Convention Hail Rotunda operated by an
Agent using his "reporter" cover. As you know, the boardwalk was the center of
agitation by dissident elements. Throughout the course of the Convention, pickets
were active inthe area immediately in front of the Convention Hall entrance. We
necessarily kept these people under close observation.

PRELIMINARY PREPARATION:

Prior to the squad's departure for Atlantic City, we secured all
available pertinent background information on the dissident groups and their leaders
who were expected to be present. In addition, we took blind memoranda with us which
were prepared and approved prior to our departure, This proved most helpful. On
Wednesday morning, Mr. Jenkins urgently requested background information on Robert

| Moses, COFO leader who had emerged as the leader of the militant group within the

. MFDP delegation, The White House also requested a blind memorandum on

Dr, Aaron Henry, Chairman of this group. Within 15 minutes of the request, the
desired blind memoranda were furnished to Jenkins. He was highly pleased and said
this was of vital importance to their operation. (Henry as you will recall has an arrest
record for perversion. )

We also prepared thumbnail sketches on all key dissident groups expected
at the Convention and we maintained separate files on the activities of King, Communist
Party groups, area hoodlums, informants, the MFDP and other groups. This was
done in order that we could maintain separate running accounts on each major disruptive
organization which was present.

LIAISON:

On arrival in Atlantic City we immediately established necessary liaison
with the Secret Service, Atlantic City Police Department, New Jersey State Highway
Patrol and with the men directing Convention activities, We also established contacts
with Allegheny Airlines to arrange for courier service between the Seat of Government
and our heagquarters in Aj flantic City.

Monday, August 24, 1964

On Sunday morning, August 23, 1964, we located a truck on Pacific
Avenue carrying a burned-out car, a huge burlap-wrapped cross and a large church
.bell, Rumors swept Atlantic City that the car was actually the one used by Schwerner,
Goodman and Chaney. Shortly after its appearance this truck was placed on a parking
lot close by Convention Hall. We quickly established the fraudulency of these rumors
and through police contacts we thwarted the racial group's plans to parade this burned
car through Atlantic City streets.

On Monday, we furnished Mr. Jenkins details regarding the plans of
_ CORE, the American Nazi Party, the Student Non-violent Coordinating Committee and
initial plans of the MFDP. 7
Appropriate officials were notified of the intention of the Negro racial
groups to establish a silent vigil on the boardwalk at the main entrance to Convention
Hall. This vigil was to be maintained until a report was issued by the Credentials
Committee regarding the seating of the MFDP delegates,

Tuesday, August 25, 1964

| support of a move to bring the Mississippi delegates issue to the floor of the Convention.

Wednesday, August 26, 1964

We submitted reports reflecting that the militant members of MFDP
under the leadership of Robert Moses were revolting against the leadership of Martin

Dick Gregory, through ACT, was attempting to promote a stall-in to block access to
Convention Hall, One of our key informants was instructed by Gregory to plan this
demonstration and through our control of him we were able to completely thwart
Gregory. We also alerted the White House in advance regarding the telegram prepared
by ACT demanding amnesty for Harlem rioters and for Federal registrars to police
‘Negro voting in the South,

AUGUST 23, 1964

The following is 2 condensed summation of
uetivities which have come to our attention as « result
of the cover.ge which we hve instituted in Atlantic City.
This senorundum concerns activities during the psst 24
hours.

MARTIN LUTHER KING .

During a press conference on the afternoon of
‘August 23, 1964, Martin Luther King urged that the
Credentiuls Conmittee sexut the Liississippi Lenocratic
Freedom Party (LDFP). King added thut if this group was
not sented, they would still support the President and
gone beck four years later and seut the Freedom purty.

as I advised you orally shortly ufter 6 p.n.,
august 23, 19 S45 a highly reliable informant udvised that
King und Bob Loses were in the process of Grafting a
telegram to President Johnson, «ccording to our informant,
King and Hoses did not wish to offend the Presideat, but
they did want to register a mild protest. aAceording to
King, the President pledged complete neutrality regurdiag
the selecting of the proper Kississippi delegation to Le
seated ut the convention, King feels that the Credentials
Comsittes will turn down the ississippi Freedom Party
and that they ure doing this because the President exerted
pressure on the committee along this line, The EDFP
wauted to get the issue before the full convention bat
beciuse of the President's actions, this will be impossible.
Therefore, King and hoses are t.king the position the
President violated his pledge of complete neutrality.

August 22-28, 1964

Monday, August 24, 1964

On Sunday morning, August 23, 1964, we located a truck on Pacific
Avenue carrying < burned-out car, a huge burlap-wrapped cross and a large church
-bell, Rumors, swept Atlantic City that the car was actually the one used by Schwerner,
Goedman and Chaney. Shortly after its appearance this truck was placed on a parking
jot close by Convention Hall. We quickly established the fraudulency of these rumors
and through police contacts we thwarted the racial group's plans to parade this burned
car through Atlantic City streets,

at

On Monday, we furnished Mr. Jenkins details regarding the plans of
CORE, the American Nazi Party, the Student Non-violent Coordinating Committee and
initial plans of the MFDP, Z
Appropriate officials were notified of the intention of the Negro racial
groups to establish a silent v: on the boardwalk at the main entrance to Convention
' Hall. This vigil was to be maintained until a report was issued by the Credentials
| Committee regarding the seating of the MFDP delegates.

Tuesday, August 25, 1964

Jenkins was advised that Martin Luther King had prevailed upon Bayard
Rustin to come to Atlantic City that day. We alerted White House representatives
- regarding compromise proposals for seating of the MFDP and furnished. them information
regarding plans of the Progressive Labor Movement groups, ACT and other dissident
| organizations, Martin Luther King attempted to arrange a rendezvous with a
Mrs. Jackson of Philadelphia. Our sources reported that SNCC and CORE were
attempting to secure tickets to gain entrance to Convention Hall. Through a highly
confidential source, it was learned that CORE and SNCC had been advised that the
' President was bringing pressure to bear on the delegates of 15 states to preclude their

support of a move to bring the Mississippi delegates issue to the floor of the Convention,

|

Wednesday, August 26, 1964 >

We submitted reports reflecting that ‘the militant members of MFDP

“under the leadership of Robert Moses were revolting against the leadership of Martin
Luther King and Aaron Henry. We advised Jenkins that the MFDP delezates had iatly
rejected the compromise proposal to seat the MFDP delegation. We reported that

RE: Spécial Squad, Atlantic City, New Jersey
- + Democratic National Convention i
August 22-28, 1964

Dick Gregory, through ACT, was attempting to promote a stall-in to block access to
Convention Hall. One of our key informants was instructed by Gregory to plan this
demonstration and through our control of him we were able to completely thwart

dl

Gregory. We also alerted the White House in advance regarding the telegrara prepared <
by ACT demanding amnesty for Harlem rioters and for Federal registrars to police
Negro voting in the South.

In consultation with Convention planners, we pointed out serious gaps
in controlling admission to Convention Hall which had permitted entrance of dissident

elements on the Convention floor, Jenkins immediately placed these recommendations
| "into effect. :

Thursday, August 27, 1964 : : 7

| We determined Martin Luther King and his staff were departing from
Atlantic City early Thursday morning, and appropriate officials were advised of this.
We also reported efforts of CORE-SNCC leaders to secure uniforms of the Young
Citizens for Johnson groups and to utilize them for gaining entrance into Convention
Hall, We were able to report that the number of participants of the silent vigil would
{dwindle rapidly. Although the demonstrations quieted down Thursday night, we were
heavily involved in checking out the reports that a four-man group of Puerto Rican
terrorists from New York were in Atlantic City in an attempt to assassinate the :
President. _ : |

May 9, 1975_ a0 vas-0180

Enclosed are several documents referred to by Mr. Colson

and myself in the courseof his recent sworn deposition at your
office. In each case, what is provided is a typed version

of my rough handwritten notes. Those notes were prepared by
me approximately a year ago, when I was given access to the

underlying documents by the Watergate Special Prosecution Force
in the course of pretrial discovery in United States v. Ehrlich-

man, et. al.

The documents are as follows:
u

1. Several FBI memos and reports concerning Leonard
Boudin. The text of the first report (dated July 6,
1971) indicates that derogatory information about Mr.
Boudin had been furnished by the FBI to Ray McHugh
of the Copley News Service. Although I do not have a
copy, there exists in Mr. Colson's White House files
a memorandum from John Dean to Charles Colson, dated

July 20, 1971, transmitting to Colson a copy of McHugh's

article. As you know, Mr. Colson served seven months,
in prison for furnishing to Jerry terHorst a report on
Mr. Boudin prepare:} by Howard Hunt from these FBI
materials.

DR, BENJAMIN SPOCK

On January 5, 1068, Dr. Benjamin Spock was indicted
in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts
and charged with conspiring to violate the Selective Service Act,
Leonard B, Boudin of the firm of Rabinowitz and Boudin, $0 East 42nd
Street, New York City, is listed as Spock!s Attorney of Record.

A look into the background of Dr, Spock's attorney
proves to be somewhat interesting.

Boudin was the recipient of much publicity in the 1250's
in connection with an application which he filed for a passport to travel
abroad. The passport was initially denied Boudin; however, the.decision
was later reversed and a passport was issued to him for travel abroad,
At that time, then Secretary of State Dulles entered into the record a
sworn affidavit which included the following statensent:

"Yn the light of the number of pro~Communist

associations and activities of the plaintiff (Boudin) over

a lengthy period of time, including reliable reports as

late as.1950 of actual membership in the Conumunist

Party, I considered that these associations and activities,

coupled with ‘the plaintiff's refusal to state under oath
whether or not he had been a member of the Communist
Party prior to June 3, 1954, when he last received a
peesport, warranted me in concliding that he was still
a supporter of the Communist movement and should be
denied continued passport facilities under the established
policy of Secretaries of State in recent years of refusing
passports to supporters of the Communist movement."
Duiles listed a number of alleged associations and
activities of Boudin "disclosed by or inferred from the Department
of State files."' Among them were:
"He was a member of the Communist Party in
the 1980s and 1940s as well as a member of the Young
Communist League.
'™n 1926, he was a director of Science and Society,
ot Inc., publishers of 'Science and Society, ' an alleged
Communist publication cited as such in 1944 by the
special committee on Un-American Activities.
"In 1947, he was a member of the iaculty of the
dJefierson School-of Social Science, cited by the Attorney

7 General as Communist.

During Loudin's passport ditticultics in 1966, he
refused to say whether he had ever becn a mempecr of the Communist -

DIRECTOR'S PRESS RELEASE, DECEMBER 7, 1973

FBI Director Clarence M, Kelley issued the following
statement todays:

As the result of a suit filed against the FBI under
the Freedom of ‘Information Act, the court has decided that
certain documents must be made public concerning a former FBI
program, which was known more commonly by its acronym,
"COINTELPRO~New Left,"

These documents were released yesterday to the
plaintiff in the suit,

Because of the, misconceptions, misapprehensions, and
? false conclusions that could be drawn from partial disclosure
of this program, it is appropriate that I explain what the

program was about and why it wa:

deemed necessary when it was

implemented in May, 1968,

. In the late 1960's, a hard-core revolutionary movement
which came to be known as the "New Left" set out, in its own
words, to bring the Governinent to its knees through the use of
force and violence, 7

" What started, as New Left movement chanting of Marxist-~

Leninist slogans in the early years of their "revolution"

developed into, violent contempt, not only for Government and

Government officials, but for every responsible American citizen.

During these years, there were over 300 arsons or
attempted arsons, 14 destructive ponbings, 9 persons killed,
and almost 600 injured on our college campuses alone, In the
school year 1968-69, damage on college campuses exceeded
3 million dollars and in the next year mounted to an excess
of 9.5 million,

In this atmosphere of lawlessness in the cities mobs
overturned vehicles, set fires, and damaged public and private
property. There were threats to sabotage power plants, to

disrupt transportation and communications facilities, Intelli-

poison public water supplies,” .

At this time of' national crisis, the Government would
have been derelict in its duty shad it not taken measures to
protect the fabric of our society, The FBI has the responsibility
of investigating allegations of ‘eriminal violations and gathering

"intelligence regarding threats 6 the country's security.
Because of the violent, actions of the leadership of the New Left,
FBI officials coneludéd that some additional effort must be
made to neutralize and disrupt this revolutionary movement,

This effort was called the "Counterintelligence Program - New
Left" or "COINTELPRO=New Left,"

While there is né way’ to measure the effect of the FBI's

attempt at countersubversion, I believe that it did have some

impact on the crisis at that time,

Now, in the context of a different era where peace
has returned to the college Se and revolutionary forces
no longer pose a major threat to peace and ‘tranquility of
our cities, some may deplore and condemn the FBI's use of a
counterintelligence program-~even against hostile and arrogant
forces which openly sought to destroy this nation,

I share the public's deep concern about the citizen's
right to privacy and the preservation of all rights guaranteed
under the Constitution and Bill of Rights, 1 have expressed
this concern on several occasions since becoming Director of

Let me remind those who now criticize the FBI's
actions that the United States Capitol was bombed; that

other explosions rocked public and private offices and

The victims of these acts of. violence: were human

An important part of the FBI's

response was to devise counterintelligence programs to

“Hininize the threats and the fears confxonting these

citizens.

citizens both within and without the Government. Many

Reference is made to SSG letter dated November 7, ;
1975, containing requests for materials concerning Martin
Luther King, Jr.

The puxpose of this memorandum is to effect delivery
| to. the SSC of information and materials in partial response to
requests contained in the SSG letter dated November 7, 1975. ol

Being delivered with this memorandum are materials

| relating to Item 2 of the above-mentioned request. Also being
| delivered is a memorandum for the Attorney General dated

| April 28, 1966, which contains a notation by former Attorney
General Nicholas de B. Katzenbach, dated June 20, 1966. This
memorandum is being delivered in response to a verbal request
made by SSC Staff Member Michael Epstein at a meeting with rep-
resentatives of the Intelligence Division of the FBI on
November 12, 1975.

In xesponse to Item 3, efforts were negative to locate
‘ the memorandum dated November 27, 1964, which is referred to in
the first paragraph of the second page of the memorandum from
M. A. Jones to Mr, Deloach dated December 8, 1964, captioned
"Mertin laither King, Je., Possible Appearance Before Baptist,
\ World Alliance Congress in June, 1965, Miami Beach, Florida.
| ey The search conducted to locate this memorandum included a review
| of the King file, all related communist influence in racial
matters files and abstracts of correspondence of FBI officials
who could have logically written such a memorandum at that time.

; With respect to Item 4, repeated reviews of the King

knowledge of personnel handling the reviews of these files, no
memorandum or other materials are believed to exist in the above
files which indicate proposals, discussions, decisions or
accomplishments pertaining to permitting anyone outside the

FBI to “listen to sources” pertaining to King.

With respéct to the excisions in materials being
delivered herewith, where no notation appears as to reason for
excision, the excision was made for the reason that the infor-
mation actually summarizes or quotes from conversations monitored
during electronic surveillances of King. In some cases, it oan
be ascertained precisely what information in FBI files came
from electronic surveillances of King; however, there exist
areas where documentation of the information is not precise
and no accurate determination can be made. Therefore no assur~
ances can be given that portions of the materials being furnished
do not contain information developed as a result of electronic
surveillances of King.

Materials in resporise to Item 1 are being processed
and will be delivered to the SSC as soon as possible.
