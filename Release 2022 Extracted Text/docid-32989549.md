VIEW OF RAYMOND SM

, On 10/23/75, I was interviewed by two members of the Senate

Select Committee, Mrs. Mary DeOreo and Mr. Mark Gitenstein, at the Dirksen

Building in the office of the Senate Select Committee. The interview began at

10:30 a.m. and ended at Noon. I was not advised of anything pertaining to my

rights.

The following are questions asked and the answers I gave, to the

best of my recollection:

QUESTION: When you went to the platform that morning - was it the day after

Mr. Hoover died, or two days later?

ANSWER: I can't remember.

QUESTION: On that particular morning in question, what did you do?

ANSWER: I went out to the platform and I found the truck sitting funny and I

wasn't sure if I had a flat tire or what. I checked the rear tires, but

found the tires were up so that I figured something was on the truck.

I can't remember if the truck was locked or what, but when I opened the

ruck it was loaded with cabinets from front to back. I questioned my

supervisor, Tony Codi, about the cabinets on the truck. To his knowledge

he didn't know where they came from. He went around to the front office

to check and was told that the cabinets were to go to Mr. Hoover's house.

QUESTION: Who gave Codi the message to take the cabinets out to Mr. Hoover's .

house?

ANSWER: It could have been Mr. Marsden or Mr. Gregory. I don't know which.

Tony double checked to find out who was going out to Mr. Hoover's house

after I questioned him if the moving crew was going. I was told there would

be no one going, but there would be a car following the truck.

QUESTION: Did you recognize the car or did you see it?

ANSWER: I couldn't tell the car from any other car out there in the street.

QUESTION: Did the car beat you to the house?

ANSWER: I didn't know if the car beat me there or not because there were other

cars parked there.

QUESTION: Where were the cabinets unloaded?

ANSWER: They were unloaded at the side gate.

## Page 9

QUESTION: Who helped you to unload?

ANSWER: I didn't know the people.

QUESTION: Was anyone there that you recognized?

ANSWER: Yes. Miss Gandy.

QUESTION: Did you know Mr. Mohr, the SAC from Washington Field Cifice or

Mr. Dunphy and were they there?

ANSWER: I wasn't sure of that day - I wasn't sure of Mohr or Dunphy.. I didn't

know the SAC from Washington Field Office.

QUESTION: Did you know anyone in Washington Field Office.

ANSWER: No.

QUESTION: Did the people who helped you move the cabinets - did you recognize

any of them - were they Agents or what?

ANSWER: I didn't know.

QUESTION: Were they dressed in suits?

ANSWER: No.

QUESTION: Were the file cabinets full or what did they contain?

ANSWER: I didn't know. All I knew was that they were heavy, that they contained

some type of file because while I was unloading one of the cabinets a drawer

fell open and I almost fell off the truck. They were manila type. light in

color.

QUESTION: Were they regular movers or what that helped you move the cabinets?

ANSWER: No, because they were inexperienced in moving cabinets because I had

to show them everything.

QUESTION: Was this an unusual procedure?

ANSWER: Yes, but I didn't ask any questions.

## Page 10

QUESTION: Did the Bureau have their own crew?

ANSWER: Yes, or they generally had GSA come in, according to how big a

move they had.

QUESTION: Were they all white or what?

ANSWER: I didn't see any Blacks - everyone was white.

QUESTION: What was the number of cabinets?

ANSWER: There were 15 or more, I can't remember.

QUESTION: How could all of them fit into his basement?

ANSWER: I don't know - I just can remember how the cabinets were arranged

in there (the basement).

QUESTION: Were there other boxes and things there ?

ANSWER: Yes.

QUESTION: The second move - was it the day after the first move?

ANSWER: Yes, I think it was.

QUESTION: How many cabinets?

ANSWER: Not as many as the first.

QUESTION: Did you have help in moving the cabinets - were they the same people?

ANSWER: I did have help, but I couldn't say if they were the same people.

QUESTION: After unloading the cabinets, what did you do?

ANSWER: I reported back to the Justice Building.

QUESTION: How long did it take you to unload the cabinets?

ANSWER: Maybe an hour or two, I can't remember exactly.

QUESTION: Did you make any other previous trips out there?

ANSWER: Yes, Jesse Peterson and I took some cabinets or small safe files out.

NW 68486 Docld:32989549 Page 10

## Page 11

QUESTION: At that time were any cabinets out there?

ANSWER: Yes.

QUESTION: How many?

ANSWER: I couldn't tell, but not as many as I took out there.

QUESTION: Do you know Annie Field, who was his maid?

ANSWER: Yes.

QUESTION: Do you know her well?

ANSWER: I know her well enough as a friend.

QUESTION: Was Annie's room in the basement?

ANSWER: Yes.

QUESTION: Would she have seen the cabinets?

ANSWER: I would think so.

QUESTION: (This would go back to the series of questions on the movers.)

Could anyone else drive the truck?

ANSWER: Yes.

QUESTION: Who could drive it?

• ANSWER: Agents or anyone because the truck had been used for special

assignments and it was no big thing for someone else to drive it.

QUESTION: Did you keep official records on the trips that you made with the truck?

ANSWER: Mileage was kept; the truck was signed out every morning and in at

night, but there were no other records kept.

QUESTION: The day after Mr. Hoover died, Exhibits went up to move things out

of his office - if the cabinets were up there, wouldn't Mr. Dunphy have

seen them?

ANSWER: I don't know if the cabinets were up there or not - I couldn't answer

that question.

QUESTION: How did you get along with Mr. Hoover?

ANSWER: O.K. I had a job to do.

QUESTION: How did you get along with Mr. Tolson?

ANSWER: O.K.

QUESTION: On that morning of Mr. Hoover's death, where were you and

what did you know?

ANSWER: On that morning I had to pick up Mr. Tolson and I was told to go to

Mr. Hoover's house and to wait until further orders.

I waited until

Mr. Mouten (ph.), Mr. Hoover's chauffeur, came out and told me to

report back to the building. I questioned him as to what was going on,

but he didn't tell me, he just said to report back to the building.

QUESTION: Did you know if Mr. Tolson knew he was dead or what?

ANSWER: I didn't know myself because I didn't find out he was dead until I

got to the building.

QUESTION: Had you made any previous trips out to Mr. Hoover's house after

his death?

ANSWER: Yes. I took some plants from the Botanical Garden to his house.

QUESTION: After Mr. Tolson's death, did you go out to the house to move any

cabinets or anything?

ANSWER: No.

QUESTION: Why were you sent to Quantico?

ANSWER: The mechanic job came open - it was something I had worked at

part-time and when the job came open I applied for it and I was transferred

down there.

QUESTION: Were you drilled on anything?

ANSWER: No.

QUESTION: Have you talked to anyone concerning the cabinets?

ANSWER: Yes. I talked to Jesse Peterson because I was trying to make him

remember moving cabinets when we had to set the safe files on the platform.

NW 68486 Docld:32989549 Page 12

## Page 13

QUESTION: Why did they use you to drive? Did they trust you?

ANSWER: I don't know. I was just told to take them out there.

QUESTION: Were the cabinets moved out of Mr. Hoover's house at night?

ANSWER: I don't know whether they moved them in the day or night or what.

QUESTION: Do you think GSA could have moved the cabinets from his house

that night?

ANSWER: I don't think so.

QUESTION: How did you know something was on the truck?

ANSWER: Just like you would come out the next morning and see something

was wrong - I drove the truck each and every day and that's why I knew

something was wrong.

QUESTION: How did you get along with Miss Gandy?

ANSWER: O.K. The only trouble I had was one time when I was told to report

to her office to make a run out io the house to pick up some mail and I was

told I had to take some other things out there and as we were walking along

she kept asking the same question over and over again - did I mind going

out to the house, and I told her no. When we got to the outer office there

were about 15 to 20 cases of soda.

I was told to get a handcart to load the

sodas and to get a car. I told her if I had known that I had to take the sodas

out I would have brought a small truck around. She told me, "In other words.

you don't want to go out to the house." I told her I did not say that. I was

told "You can report back downstairs" and I told her that was perfectly all

right with me. I reported the incident to my supervisor, Mr. Gregory.

QUESTION: Did you see Miss Gandy anymore after that?

ANSWER: Yes, I had to take her to the doctor and the next time was out at

Mr. Hoover's house.

clean out their cellars and I considered

this abont the same thing.

Didn't you become suspicious and scared

when you read in the newspapers that

allegedly secret files were taken out

of the Diractor's office and destroyed?

No, why should I, as I said before,

I wasn't in the Director's office.

Mi. Battle, Mr. Shaffer states you and

he removed boxes from the Director's

office at the direction of Mr. Kunkel.

•Well, Mr. Shaffer is wrong. I never went

to the Director's office with he or anyone

else.

Have you discussed this matter with

anyone else?

Yes, with the FBI Inspectors who called

me in.

That was when?

In June, you can get the exact date

from the 302.

• Have you discussed this matter with

anyone else?

Well, you know Shaffer, Dudney and Dowling

and I came up here this morning together

and naturally the matter was discussed.

Do you know or see a memorandum that

No.

When did you last see Kunkel?

About 6 months ago, I saw him at an

How about prior to that?

When he left for St. Louls

You haven't discussed this matter with

No, other than the above.

How come Kunkel was transferred to St.

Wasn't there a personal feud between

Gray and Kunkel?

If there was, I don't have any direct

No.

tacilities, my do you think me. kunke. was requested

to handle the destruction of the material?

No, we have employees assigned this duty.

INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIIS (SSC)

RE: INTERVIEW OF CHIEF CLERK KENNETH SHAFFER

BY SSC STAFF MEMBERS.

Answer: Yes, I did.

Question: How did this affect you?

Answer:

It really did not affect me.

It became a private

joke between Mc. Dudney and myself in that se

may have made the newspapers, but did not realize

werwere or would ever be involved.

Question: Did you read an article in "Time" or "'Newsweek"

relative to the destruction of material fron the

office of Me. Hoover?

Answer:

No sir, I did not.

Question: Did you discuss this matter with anyone?

Answer:

No, I did not.

The interviever emphatically stated that I did

discuss the matter

at the time I was interviewed

as reflected by the copy of FD-302 in his possession.

(I stated that I thought he was referring to a

possible discussion with personnel assigned to

the Washington Field Offica.)

There may have been other questions asked of me;

however, as stated above these are the questions I can recall.

Re:

"He stated Special Agent (SA) Paul Daly was aware of

cheir interest in interviewing me and suggested I contact baly.

E did so and on the morning of November 11, 1975, 1 cane E

SA LarSOn

stated the bureau had furnished the Committee various documents

regarding mail opening programs. I told him the only program

I was aware of was that involving mail from the Chinese

Mainland. SA Larson and SA Daly stated that my appearance

was voluntary and that if I felt I wanted to exercise my

Fifth Amendment rights, the Department of Justice could

be requested to secure

an attorney for me.

They stated

that the Bureau had no objection to my appearing or to my

admitting my knowledge of the Chinese mail opening program.

"I thereafter met with Mr. Dick at approximately

3:15 p.m.

that day, Nov ember I1, 1975. While I met Mr. Dick

at the Dirksen Office Building,

the interview was conducted

with Mr. Dick in a room at the former Carroll Arms Hotel, Only

Mr. Dick was present.

He advised me that my appearance and

discussion was voluntary, that I had the right to an attorney,

etc. I told hin that I had been given clearance from the

Bureau to discuss the mail opening program and that I would

answer any questions he might have.

He stated there

had been

three programs:

SAM, CHIPROP and CHICLET, and he desired to

know of my knowledge

of these programs.

I told him that very

frankly the number of years that had elapsed prevented me from

recognizing the names of the programs, but I was aware that the

San Francisco Office had

a program for the opening of mail fron

the Chinese Mainland.

Whether it was also openine mail to

Chinese Mainland I did not recall. He showed me documents

regarding the programs which had been furnished the Committee

by the Bureau.

These were, apparently, semi-annual justification

letters for the CHIPROP and CHICLET prograns. He asked whether

I had recalled having approved any of these communications going

to the Bureau.

I stated I could not recall. He noted that my

initials did not appear on the copies that he possessed.

11th. Respect to Intelligence Activities (SSG)

Re: Interview of Former Deputy Assistant

Director Paul O'Connell by SSC Staff Menber

*With respect to my knowledge of these programs,

I. explained that the ASAG was involved with the administrative

as welt as investigative operations of the otrice and that

once a program was instituted, the officials of the office

would not be knowledgeable of the day-to-day operations of the

program, but that any changes in procetures,

approved by supervisory orticials.

He asked which desk would

have supervised the Chinese nail opening program.

I told him

that to my recollection it was the espionage squad, supervised

by Kichard Fletchet.

"He asked for a rundown on my assignments in the Bureau

fron the mic-1950's to the present, which I outlined for him.

lle requested the names of the SACs during my assignment to the

San Francisco Office, which I furnished. He then asked that I

describe the administrative setup of the office.

As this did

not involve mall opening, I decided to telephonically contact

tic. Gregar at Bureau Headquarters to see if there was any

objection to answering this and he said there was none.

then explained that in addition to the SAC and the ASAG, there

were approximately 12 desks (squads) including the night

supervisory desk and that there were three security squads:

the espionage squad, and two internat security squads. he

were supervisors of the internal security squads.

He asked

if the two internal security supervisors handled the sane

work and I told hin I thought the breakdown was that one

handled organizations and the other individuals.

"Ur. Dick stated that they desired this information for

background information as the Bureau has acknowledged the eristence

of the program and had fumished copies of various documents.

said that there would be no more hearings by the Comittee con-

cerning mail openings and that he anticipated the Connittee will

complete its work in February.

The intervlew concluded at

approximately 4:00 p.m."

RE: Special Squad, Atlantic City, New Jersey

Democratic National Convention

August 22-28, 1964

Monday, August 24, 1964

On Sunday morning, August 23, 1964, we located a truck on Pacific

Avenue carrying a burned-out car, a huge burlip-wrapped cross and a large church

bell. Rumors swept Atlantic City that the car was actually the one used by Schwerner;

Goodman and Chaney, Shortly aiter its appearance this truck was placed on a parking

lot close by Convention Hall. We quickly established the fraudulency of these rumors

land through police contacts we thwarted the racial group's plans to parade this burned

car through Atlantic City streets.

On Monday, we furnished MIr. Jenkins details regarding the plans of

CORE, the American Nazi Party, the Student Non-violent Coordinating Committee and

initial plans of the MFDP.

Appropriate officials were notified of the intention of the legro racial

groups to establish a silent vigil on the boardwalk at the main entrance to Convention

Hall.

This vigil was to be maintained until a report was issued by the Credentials

Committee regarding the searing of the MFDP delegates.

Tuesday, August 25. 1964

Jenkins was advised that Martin Luther King had prevailed upon Bajard

Rustin to come to Atlantic City thai day. We alerted White House representatives

regarding compromise proposals for seating of the MFDP and furnished them iniormation

regarding pians oi the Progressive Labor Movement groups, ACT and other dissident

organizations. Martin Luther King attempted to arrange a rendezvous with a

Mrs. Jackson of Philadelphia. Our sources reported that SCC and CORE were

attempting to secure tickets to gain entrance to Convention Hall. Through a higaly

confidential source, it was learned that CORE and SNCC had been advised that the

President was bringing pressure to bear on the delegates of 15 states to preclude weir

support of a move to bring the Mississippi delegates issue to the floor of the Conventione

Wednesday, august 26: 1964

We submitted reports reflecting that the militant members of MFDP

under the leadership of Rovert Moses were revolting against the leadership of Martin

Luther King and Aaron Henry. We advised Jenkins that the MFDP dele rates had slatly

rejected the compromise proposal to seat the MFDP delegation. We reported that

RE: Special Squad, Atlantic City, New Jersey

Democratic National Convention

August 22-28, 1964

Dick Gregory, through ACT, was attempting to promote a stall-in to block access to

Convention Hall. One of our key informants was instructed by Gregory to plan this

demonstration and through our control of him we were able to completely thwart

Gregory. We also alerted the White House in advance regarding the telegran prepared

by ACT demanding amnesty for Hariem rioters and for Federal registrars to police

Negro voting in the South.

In consultation with Convention planners, we pointed out serious gaps

in controlling admission to Convention Hall which had permitted entrance of dissident

elements on the Convention floor. Jenkins immediately placed these recommendations

into effect.

Thursday, August 27, 1964

We determined Martin Luther King and his staff were departing from

Atlantic City early Thursday morning, and appropriate officials were advised of this.

We also reported efforts of CORE-SNCC leaders to secure uniforms of the Young

Citizens for Johnson groups and to utilize them for gaining entrance into Convention

Hall. We were able to report that the number of participants of the sient vigil wouid

dwindle rapidly. Although the demonstrations quieted down Thursday night, we were

heavily involved in checking out the reports that a four-man group of Puerto Rican

terrorists from New York were in Atlantic City in an attempt to assassinate the

I President.

MISCELLANEOUS:

For the benefit of the Domestic Intelligence and General Investigative

Divisions, separate memoranda are being submitted regarding infomant coverage.

am also recommending letters of appreciation to cooperative individuals whose efforts

facilitated the squad's work in Atlantic City.

You are probably right that it is illegal to maintain

these records under the Privacy Act as indicated in your

memo of November 7, 1975. Doug Marvin is right that. the

Senate has requested us to keep them as suggested in his

meno of November 11, 1975. Congress obviously is wrong

in its contrary instructions on the subject.

Why don't

we deposit them bodily in the respective laps of Scott and

Mansfield and let them make up their minds, if any?

of King;

however, there exist areas where documentation of the

MAJOR ACCOMPLISHMENTS:

In connection with the assignment of the special squad to Atlantic City,

New Jersey, 8/22-28/64 at the direction of the President, I wish to report the successful

completion of this assignment. By means of informant coverage, by use of various

confidential techniques, by infiltration of key groups through use of undercover agents

and through utilization of agents using appropriate cover as reporters, we were ableto

Keep the White House fully apprised of all major developments during the Conventiones

course.

For example, through informant coverage and by controlling the

ithout the

situation, we were able to prevent a potentially explosive stall-in and sit-in demon-

stration planned by ACT and Dick Gregory. By counseling Messrs. Jenkins, Carters

and Moyers, we convinced them that they must make major changes in controlling

ssa.

admissions into the Convention Hall and thereby preclude infiltration of the illegal

Commentse and the

Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party (MEDP) delegates in large numbers into the

space reserved for the regular Mississippi delegates. Through our counterintelligene

efforts, Jenkins, et al., were able to advise the President in advance regarding major

plans of the MFDP delegates. The White House considered this of prime importance

challenge and with enthusiasm. The Agents were constantly alert to exploit

opportunities for penetration of key dissident groups in Atlantic City and to suggest

counter measures for any plans to disrupt the Convention.

Our informant coverage worked particularly well. With Bureau approval,

I instituted coverage similar to that on King and Rustin on CORE-SNCC headquarters at

their Atlantic Avenue meeting hall. Our Negro undercover agents successfully,

penetrated the headquarters of the MFPD delegation at the Gem Motel and the head-

quarters for their strategy meetings, which was located in the basement of the Union

Baptist Temple Church.

coktentedldrews.coo

Additionally, we utilized a highly successful cover through cooperation

credentials I selected several of the members of the squad to utilize this cover.

As an example, one of our "reporters" was able to gain the confidence of Aaron

Henry, Robert Moses, James Farmer, Dick Gregory and Jesse Gray, the notorious

Harlem riot leader.

Our "reporter" was so successful, in fact, that Henry was giving

him "off the record information" for background purposes, which he requested our

"reporter" not to print.

with Dick Gregory saturday-night, August 4nd and maintained this relationship

One of our Negro undercover agents successfully established contact rig

throughout the course of the entire Convention. By midweek, he had become one of

Gregory's confidants. This, of course, proved to be a highly valuable source of

intelligence since Gregory was constantly trying to incite racial groups to violence.

DISSEMINATION OF INFORMATION:

During our Convention coverage, we disseminated 44 pages of

intelligence data to Walter Jenkins.

Attached for your information is a copy of these

I daily summaries. Additionally, I kept Jenkins and Moyers constantly advised by

telephone of minute by minute developments. This enabled them to make spot decisions

and to adjust Convention plans to meet potential problems before serious trouble

developed.

In connection with communications, as you know, we arranged for a

leased line between the Bureau and our control post in Atlantic City. We also

established a private line for exclusive use by our informants. Appropriate code names

were arranged and informants dispatched from other cities and Newark informants used

this phone to submit their oral reports. This post was, of course, manned on a

24-hour basis.

De Loach to Mohr

RE: Special Squad, Atlantic City, New Jersey

Democratic National Convention

August 22-28, 1964

During the period when the Convention was actually in progress, we

established a secondary command post at the Convention Hall Rotunda operated by an

Agent using his "reporter" cover. As you know, the boardwalk was the center of

agitation by dissident elements. Throughout the course of the Convention, pickets

were active inthe area immediately in front of the Convention Hall entrance. We

necessarily kept these people under close observation.

PRELIMINARY PREPARATION:

Prior to the squad*s departure for Atlantic City, we secured all

available pertinent background information on the dissident groups and their leaders

who were expected to be present. In addition, we took blind memoranda with us which

were prepared and approved prior to our departure. This proved most helpful. On

Wednesday morning, Mr. Jenkins urgently requested background information on Robert

Moses, COFO leader who had emerged as the leader of the militant group within the

MFDP delegation. The White House also requested a blind memorandum on

Dr. Aaron Henry, Chairman of this group. Within 15 minutes of the request, the

desired blind memoranda were furnished to Jenkins. He was highly pleased and said

this was of vital importance to their operation. (Henry as you will recall has an arrest

Irecord for perversion.)

We also prepared thumbnail sketches on all key dissident groups expected

at the Convention and we maintained separate files on the activities of King, Communist

Party groups, area hoodlums, informants, the MFDP and other groups. This was

done in order that we could maintain separate running accounts on each major disruptive

organization which was present.

LIAISON:

On arrival in Atlantic City we immediately established necessary liaison

with the Secret Service, Atlantic City Police Department, New Jersey State Highway

Patrol and with the men directing Convention activities. We also established contacts

with Allegheny Airlines to arrange for courier service between the Seat of Government

and our headquarters in Atlantic City.

DAILY COUNTER MEASURES BY SPECIAL SQUAD:

As an example of the type of problems encountered by this special

squad in Atlantic City, following is a brief resume of some of the situations which

developed during the Convention:

Monday, August 24,. 1964

On Sunday morning, August 23, 1964, we located a truck on Pacific

Avenue carrying a burned-out car, a huge burlap-wrapped cross and a large church

bell. Rumors swept Atlantic City that the car was actually the one used by Schwerner,

Goodman and Chaney. Shortly after its appearance this truck was placed on a parking

lot close by Convention Hall. We quickly established the fraudulency of these rumors

land through police contacts we thwarted the racial group's plans to parade this burned

(car through Atlantic City streets.

On Monday, we furnished Mr. Jenkins details regarding the plans of

CORE, the American Nazi Party, the Student Non-violent Coordinating Committee and

initial plans of the MFDP.

Appropriate officials were notified of the intention of the Negro racial

groups to establish a silent vigil on the boardwalk at the main entrance to Convention

Hall. This vigil was to be maintained until a report was issued by the Credentials

Committee regarding the seating of the MFDP delegates.

Tuesday, August 25, 1964

Jenkins was advised that Martin Luther King had prevailed upon Bayard

Rustin to come to Atlantic City that day. We alerted White House representatives

regarding compromise proposals for seating of the MFDP and furnished them information

regarding plans of the Progressive Labor Movement groups, ACT and other dissident

organizations. Martin Luther King attempted to arrange a rendezvous it a

Mrs. Jackson. of Philadelphia: Our sources reported that SNCC and CORE were

attempting to secure tickets to gain entrance to Convention Hall. Through a highly

confidential source, it was learned that CORE and SNCC had been advised that the

President was bringing pressure to bear on the delegates of 15 states to preclude their

support of a move to bring the Mississippi delegates issue to the floor of the Convention.

Wednesday, August 26, 1964

We submitted reports reflecting that the militant members of MEDP

under the leadership of Robert Moses were revolting against the leadership of Martin

Luther King and Aaron Henry. We advised Jenkins that the MFDP delegates had flatly

rejected the compromise proposal to seat the MFDP delegation. We reported that

Dick Gregory, through ACT, was attempting to promote a stall-in to block access to

Convention Hall. One of our key informants was instructed by Gregory to plan this

demonstration and through our control of him we were able to completely thwart

Gregory. We also alerted the White House in advance regarding the telegram prepared

by ACT demanding amnesty for Harlem rioters and for Federal registrars to police

Negro voting in the South.

We determined Martin Luther King and his staff were departing from

We also reported efforts of CORE-SNCC leaders to secure uniforms of the Young

Citizens for Johnson groups and to utilize them for gaining entrance into Convention

Hall. We were able to report that the number of participants of the silent vigil would

dwindle rapidly. Although the demonstrations quieted down Thursday night, we were

heavily involved in checking out the reports that a four-man group of Puerto Rican

terrorists from New York were in Atlantic City in an attempt to assassinate the

President.

MISCELLANEOUS:

For the benefit of the Domestic Intelligence and General Investigative

Divisions, separate memoranda are being submitted regarding infomant coverage. I

RE: Specia! Squad, Atlantic City, New Jersey

Democratic National Convention

August 22-28, 1964

Monday, August 24, 1964

On Sunday morning, August 23, 1964, we located a truck on Pacific

Avenue carrying - burned-out car, a huge burlap-wrapped cross and a large church

bell. Rumors, swept Atlantic City that the car was actually the one used by Schwerner;

Goodman and Chaney. Shortly after its appearance this truck was placed on a parking

lot close by Convention Hall. We quickly established the fraudulency of these rumors

and through police contacts we thwarted the racial group's plans to parade this burned

car through Atlantic City streets.

On Monday, we furnished Mr. Jenkins details regarding the plans of

CORE, the American Nazi Party, the Student Non-violent Coordinating Committee and

initial plans of the MFDP.

Appropriate officials were notified of the intention of the Negro racial

groups to establish a silent vigil on the boardwalk at the main entrance to Convention

Hall. This vigil was to be maintained until a report was issued by the Credentials

Committee regarding the seating of the A1FDP delegates.

Tuesday, August 25: 1964

Jenkins was advised that Martin Luther King had prevailed upon Bayard

Rustin to come to Atlantic City that day. We alerted White House representatives

regarding compromise proposals for seating of the MFDP and furnished them intormation

regarding pians of the Progressive Labor Movement groups, ACT and other dissident

organizations. Martin Luther King attempted to arrange a rendezvous with a

Mrs. Jackson of Philadelphia. Our sources reported that SNCC and CORE were

attempting to secure tickets to gain entrance to Convention Hall. Through a highly

confidential source, it was learned that CORE and SNCC had been advised that the

President was bringing pressure to bear on the delegates of 15 states to preclude their

support of a move to bring the Mississippi delegates issue to the floor of the Convention.

Wednesday, August 26: 1964

We submitted reports reflecting that the militant members of MEDP

under the leadership of Robert Mloses were revolting against the leadership of Martin

Luther King and Aaron Henry. We advised Jenkins that the MiFDP delegates had flatly

rejected the compromise proposal to seat the MFDP delegation. We reported that

RE: Special Squad, Atlantic City, New Jersey

• Democratic National Convention

August 22-28, 1964

Dick Gregory, through ACT, was attempting to promote a stall-in to block access to

Convention Hall. One of our key informants was instructed by Gregory to plan this

demonstration and through our control of him we were able to completely thwart

Gregory. We also alerted the White House in advance regarding the telegram prepared

by ACT demanding amnesty for Harlem rioters and for Federal registrars to police

Negro voting in the South.

In consultation with Convention planners, we pointed out serious gaps

I in controlling admission to Convention Hall which had permitted entrance of dissident

elements on the Convention floor. Jenkins immediately placed these recommendations

into effect.

Thursday, August 27, 1964

We determined Martin Luther King and his staff were departing from

Atlantic City early Thursday morning, and appropriate officials were advised of this.

We also reported efforts of CORE-SNCC leaders to secure uniforms of the Young

Citizens for Johnson groups and to utilize them for gaining entrance into Convention

Hall. We were able to report that the number of participants of the silent vigil wouid

dwindle rapidly. Although the demonstrations quieted down Thursday night, we were

terrorists from New York were in Atlantic City in an attempt to assassinate the

President.

MISCELLANEOUS:

For the benefit of the Domestic Intelligence and General Investigative

Divisions, separate memoranda are being submitted regarding infomant coverage.

Dear Mr. Attorney General:

In my letter to you of August 28, 1975, concerning

Committee document requests, I said

that we did not want

the DeLoach memoranda of August 24-27, 1964 (concerning

the 1961 Democratic National Convention daily summaries

from DeLoach to Walter Jenkins) at that time.

Because of the present posture of our investigation,

I am now requesting delivery of legible, unexcised

copies

of these memoranda by Friday, November 14, 1975.

I under-

stand that the FBI has compiled and readied these documeris

for delivery and that the only delay in delivery concerns

my sending this request to you, since it does relate to.

Those notes were prepared by

man, et. al.

The documents are as follows:

Boudin

The text of the first report (dated July 6,

1971) indicates that derogatory information about Mr.

Boudin had been furnished by the FBI to Ray McHugh

of the Copley News Service.

Although I do not have a

copy, there exists in Mr. Colson's White House files

a memorandum from John Dean to Charles Colson, dated

July 20, 1971, transmitting to Colson a copy of McHugh's

DR. BENJAMIN SPOCK

On January 5, 1008, Di. Benjamin Spock was indictod

in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts

and charged with conspiring to violate the Selective Service Act.

Leonard B. Boudin of the firm of Rabinowitz and Boudin, 30 Bast 42nd

. Street, New York City, is listed as Spock!s Attorney of Record.

A look into the background of Dr. Spock's attorney

proves to be somewhat interesting.

Boudin was the recipient of much publicity in the 1950's

in connection with an application which he filed for a passport to travel

abroad. The passport was initially denied Boudin; however, the decision

was later reversed and a passport was issued to him ior travel abroad.

At that time, then Secretary of State Dulles entered into the record a

sworn affidavit which included the following statement:

"In the light of the number of pro-Communist

associations and activities of the plaintic (Boudin) over

& lengthy period oi time, including reliable ¿oports as

late as 1950 of actual membership in the Communist

Party, I considered that these associations and activities,

coupled with the plaintiff's refusal to state under oath

whether or not he had been a member of the Communist

Party prior to June 3, 1954, when he last received a

passport, warranted me in conciding that he was still

a supporter of the Communist morement and should be

denied continued passport facilities under the established

policy of Secretaries of State in recent years of refusing

passports to supporters of the Communist movement."

Duiles listed a number of alleged associations and

activities of Boudin "disclosed by or inferred from the Department

of State files." Among them were:

"He was a member of the Communist Party in

the 1930s and 1940s as well as a member of the Young

Communist Leagie.

"In 1936, he was a director of Science and Society,

Inc., publishers of 'Science and Society,' an alleged

Communist publication cited as such in 1944 by the

special committee on Un-American Activities.

"In 1947, he was a member of the iaculty of the

Jefierson School of Social Science, cited by the Attorney

General as Communist.

counsel, he was an adviser in other than legal matters;

Office and Professional Workers Oi America, a group

expelled from the CIO in 1950 because of consistently

pro-Communist policies and activities.

"He has from time to time contributed articles

to the 'New Masses,' an oiticial communist publication.

("'New York Journal American, " April 10, 1959)

A State Department spokesman has also asserted that

Eoudin was oiticially considered the attorney for Alger Hiss in con-

nection with his application for a passport to travel abroad. Miss,

it will be recalled, was convicted of perjury relating to his denial

that he had passed secret military and diplomatic documents tớ a

Soviet agent. He served three years and eight months in prison.

("New York Journal American, " April 10, 1959)

In 1984, Foudin and his partner, Victor Rabinowitz,

after a ruling by the Supreme Court, were requirea to register under

the Foreign Agents Registration Act as representatives of the Cuban

Government. (UPI ticker No. 44, 3/30/64)

During lOudin's passport ditticultics in 1956, he

refused to say whether he had ever bech a nemicr of the Communist

Party. He did state that he had not ocen a inemier since 1954, but

refused to discuss previous ycars.

DIRECTOR'S PRESS RELEASE, DECEMBER 7, 1973

FBI Director Clarence M. Kelley issued the following

statement today:

As the result of a suit filed against the FBI under

the Freedom of Information Act, the court has decided that

certain documents must be made public concerning a former FBI

program,

which was known more commonly by its acronym,

"COINTELPRO-New Left."

These documents were released yesterday to the

plaintiff in the suit.

Because of the misconceptions, misapprehensions, and

false

conclusions that could be drawn from partial disclosure

of this program, it is appropriate that I explain what the

program was about and why it

was deemed necessary when it

was

implemented in May, 1968.

In the late

1960's,

ahard-core revolutionary movement

which came to be known as the "New left" set out, in its own

words, to bring the Governinent to its knees through the use of

force

and violence.

What started. as New Left movement chanting of Marxist

Leninist slogans in the early years of their "revolution"

developed into. violent contempt, not only for Government and

Government officials, but for every responsible American citizen.

:

During these years, there were over 300 arsons or

attempted arsons, 14 destructive bombings, 9 persons killed,

and almost 600 injured on our college campuses alone. In the

school year 1968-69, damage on college campuses exceeded

3 million dollars

and in the next year mounted to an

excess

of 9.5 million.

In this atmosphere of lawlessness in the cities mobs

overturned vehicles, set fires, and damaged public and private

property. There were threats to sabotage power plants, to

disrupt transportation and communications facilities. Intelli-

gonco sourceo intomod the FBi cê glang that were discusseu to

poison public water supplies.

At this time of national crisis, the Government would

have been derelict in its duty had it not taken measures to

protect the fabric of our society. The FBI has the responsibility

of investigating allegations of criminal violations and gathering

intelligence regarding threats to the country's security.

Because of the violent actions

of the leadership of the New Left,

FBI officials concluded

that some additional effort must be

made to neutralize and disrupt this revolutionary movement.

This effort was called the "Counterintelligence Program - New

Left" or "COINTELPRO-New Left."

While there is

no way to

measure the effect of the FBI's

attempt at countersubversion,

*I believe that it did have some

impact on the crisis at that time.

NW 68486 Docld:32989549 Page 208

## Page 209

Now, in the context of a different era where peace

has returned to the college campuses and revolutionary forces

no longer pose a major threat to

peace and tranquility of

our cities, some may deplore and condemn the FBI's use of a

counterintelligence program--even

against hostile and arrogant

forces which openly sought to destroy this nation.

I share the public's deep concern about the citizen's

right to privacy and the preservation of all. rights guaranteed

under the Constitution and Bill of Rights. I have expressed

this concern on

several occasions since becoming Director of

the rei.

The Acting Attorney General and I have discussed this

situation, and we both agreed that an evaluation of FBI

reactions in national security emergencies, already underway,

should be continued.

I plan to: make a full report to the

Attorney General.

While such a counterintelligence program may not be

the answer, there must be some effective way for the Federal

Government to meet the.

challenge posed by those who will use

any means to foment revolution.

Mr. Bork and I both feel that perhaps additional

legislation is required, and this

is being given thorough study.

We must carefully define FBI responsibilities and authority so

that we can continue to fulfill the FBI's obligations to the

citizens of the United States.

DIPECIOR, FEDERAL DUREAU OF INVESTIGARION

NOVEL BER 10, 1974

Attorney General Milliam B. Saxbe today has

released a report regar&ing FBI counterintelligence

programs.

The report was prepared by a Justice

Department connittee which included FBI representatives

that was specially appointed early this year to study

and report on those programs.

Since taking the oath

of office as Director

on July 9, 1973, I also have mace a detailed study of

these sane ISI countcrintelligence prograns.

The first of tien--one directed at the

Conmunist Party, USA--was instituted in Septenber, 1956.

None of the prograns vas continued beyond April, 1971.

¡The purpose of these counterintelligence

programs

was to prevent dangerous, and even potentially

deadly, acts against incivicuals, organizations, and

institutions--poti puolic and private-across the united

States.

This document is prepared in response to your request and is not for dissemi-

Its use is limited to official proceedings by

your Committee and the content may nut be disclosed to unauthoriseu person

they were designed to counter the conspiratorial

efforts of revolutionary eloments in this country,

as well

as to neutralize extremists of both the left and the right

who wexe threatening, and in many instances forenting,

acts of violence.

The study nich I have made convinces me that

the FBI employeas involved in these programs acted

entirely in good faith ana within the bounds of what

was expected of them by the President, the Attorney General,

the congress, aná the American people.

Each of these counterintelligence programs

bore the approval of the then-Director j. Edgar Hoover.

Proposals for courses of action to de talen

under. these programs were subject to approval in auvance,

as yell as to constant revie., by rBI riela Office ana

Headquarters Officials.

•Throughout the tenure of these prograns, efforts

admittedly were nade to disrupt the anarchistic plans and

activities of violence-prone groups whose publicly announcea

goal was to bring america to its knees. For the ISI io have

Let me remind those who now criticize the FBI's

actions that the United States Capitol was bombed; that

other explosions rocked public and private offices and

buildings; that rioters led by revolutionary extremists

laid siege to military, industrial, and educational

- facilities; and that killings, maimings, and other

atrocities accompanied such acts of violence from

New England to California.

The victims of these acts of violence were human

beings-men, women, and children who looked to the FBI

and other law enforcement agencies to protect their lives,

rights, and property. An important part of the FBI's

response was to devise counterintelligence programs to

mininize the threats and the fears confronting these

citizens.

... In carrying out its counterintelligence programs,.

the FBI seceived the personal. encouragement of myriad

citizens both within and without the Government. Many

Americans feared for their own safety and for the safety of

their Government. Others were revolted by the rhetoric

of violence and the acts of violence that were being

preached and practiced across our country by hara-core

extremists.

invite your attention to the attached back-

ground material which illustrates the gravity of the

problem as it then existed, as well as the need for

decisive and effective counteraction by the criminal

justice and intelligence communities.

I want to assure you that Director Hoover did

not conceal from superior authorities the fact that the

FBI was engaging in neutralizing and disruptive tactics

against revolutionary and violence-prone groups. For

example, in a communication concerning a revolutionary

organization that he sent to the then-Attorney General and

the White House on May 8, 1958, MI. Hoover furnished

details of techniques utilized by the FBI to promote

disruption of that organization.

A second communication calling attention to

measures being employed as an adjunct to the FBI's

regular investigative operations concerning this same

revolutionary ofganization was sent to the Attorney

• General-designate and the Deputy Attorney General-designate

by Mr. Hoover on-January 10, 1961.

Sx. Hoover also sent communications to the then-

Attorneys General in 1965, 1967, and 1969 furnishing

them information regarding disruptive actions the FBI

was employing to neutralize activities of certain Rightist

hate groups.

COUNTERNTELLIGENCE PROGRAM

BACKGROUND MATERIAL

I. Introduction

The FBI's counterintelligence program was developed in

response to needs at the time to quickly neutralize organizations and

individuals who were advocating and fomenting urban violence and campus

disorder. The riots which swept America's urban centers, beginning in

1965, were quickly followed by violent disorders which paralyzed college

campuses. Both situations led to calls for action by alarmed Government

leaders and a frightened citizenry

Tenor of the Times

An Associated Press survey noted that, during the first nine

months of 1967, racial violence in 67 cities resulted in 85 deaths, injuries

108, 200 people and property damage of over $100, 000, 0D0.

The February,

-170, issue of "Security World" stated that during the period January 1 to

August 31, 1969, losses specificaliy traced to campus disorders amounted

to 88, 946, 972.

In March, 1965, then Senator Robert F. Kennedy predicted

nore violence in the South and North after Congress passed voting rights

legislation. Kennedy said, "I don't care what legislation is passed--we

are going to have problems... violence."

This document is prepared in response to your request and is not for dissemi-

Its use is limited to official procesdings by

your Committee and the content may nut be disclosed to unauthorized person

A United Press International release on December 5, 1967,

quoted Pennsylvania's Governor Raymond P. Shafer as warning that "urban.

disaster's in the form of "total urban warfare" is waiting in the wings to

strike if the race problem is not solved in the Nation's cities.

Attorney General Ramsey Clark reported to President Johnson

on January 12, 1968, according to the "Washington Star," that extremist

•=..

activity to foment "rebellion in urban ghettos' has put a severe strain on

-Jbe * BI and other Justice Department resources. Clark called this "the

most difficult intelligence problem" in the Justice Department.

A United Press International release on February 13, 1958,

stated that President Johnson expected further turmoil in the cities and

"several bad summers"' before the Nation's urban problems are solved.

IU.. Calls to Action

President Lyndon Johnson said in a television address to the

Bation on July 24, 1957, in describing events that led to sending troops

to Detroit during that city's riot, "We will not tolerate lawlessness. , We

will not endure violence.

It matters not by whom it is done, or under

what slogari or banner. It will not be tolerated." He called upon "all of

bus people in all of our cities" to "show by word and by deed that rioting,

"Jooting and public disorder will just not be tolerated."

In a second address to the Nation in just three days, President

Johnson announced the appointment of a special Advisory Commission on

NW 68486 Docld:32989549 Page 216

## Page 217

Civil Disorder to investigate origins of urban riots.

. The President said

that this country had "endured a week such that no Nation should live

through; a time of violence and tragedy." He declared that "the looting

and arson and plunder and pillage which have occurred are not part of a

civil rights protest?" "It is no American right," said the President, to

loot or burn or "fire rifles from the rooftops." Those in public responsi-

bality have "an immediate" obligation "to end disorder," the President

told the American people, by using "every means at our command.

The President warned public officials that "if your response

to these tragic events is only business-as-usual, you invite not only

disaster but dishoror." President Johnson declared that "violence must

'se stepped quickly, finally and permanently" and he pledged" we will

stop

Souse Speaker John W. McCormick said on July 24, 1967,

ater conlerring with President Jobnson that the President had told party

leaders that "public order is the first business of Government." The

next day, Senator Robert C. Byrd advocated "brutal force" to contain

schan rioting and said adult looters should be "shot on the spot."

On April 12, 1968, Representative Clarence D. Long of

Nazyland urged J. Edgar Hoover in a letter and in a public statement

to infiltrate extremist groups to head off future riots and said FBI

Agents "could take people like Negro militants Stokely Carmichael

and H. Rap Brown out of circulation."

The "St. Louis Globe--Democrat" in a February 14, 1969,

editorial entitled, "Throw the Book at Campus Rioters," described campus

disorders then sweeping the Nation as 'a threat to the entire university

educational systems" This newspaper called on the Attorney General to

"nove now to stop these anti-American anarchists and communist stooges

• in their tracks. He should hit them with every weapon at his command.

The American people are fed up with such bearded, anarchist creeps and

would applaud a strong drive against them. They have been coddled and

given license to run roughshod over the rights of the majority of college

students far too long. It is time to hit them hard with everything in the

book. +*

En October 2, 1959, Senator Byrd said that "events in the news

sa the past few days concerning activities by militant radical groups should

"fort us to the new trouble that is brewing on the Nation's college campuses

and elsewhere." Senator Byrd said that "áll of us would do well to, pas

heed now, and law enforcement authorities should plan a course of action

before the situation gets.completely out of hand."

After ti August 24, 1970, bombing at the University of

Wisconsin, Madison, a group of faculty members called for disciplinary

action against students involved in disruption and violence. In a statement

delivered to the Chancellor, 867 faculty members said "the rising tide of

intimidation and violence on the campuses in the last few years has made

NW 68486 Docld:32989549 Page 218

normal educational and scholarly activities increasingly difficult. There

has been a steady escalation of destructiveness that has culminated in an

act of homicide. Academic freedom, meaning freedom of expression for all

ideas and viewpoints, has been steadily eroded until now many are questioning

whether it exists on the Madison campus." The faculty members said that

"the acts of a few must not be allowed to endanger the rights and privileges

"of all members of the academic community."

"The New York Times" reported bi October 11, 1970, on

....

"'The Urban Guerrillas--A New Phenomenon in the United States" and

noted that the Senate Subcommittee on Internal Security recently heard

four days of testimony on four bills aimed at "crushing the urban guerrillas, "

including one "that would make it a crime to belong to or aid organizations

advocating terrorism, and would prohibit the publication of periodicals that

advocate violence against police and the overthrow of the Government."

The President's Commission on Campus Unrest in detailing

"the law enforcement resporse" noted that ""it is an undoubted fact that

on some campuses there are, men and womén who plot, all too often !

successfully, to burn and bomb, and sometimes to maim and kill. The

police must attempt to determine whether or not such a plot is in progress.

and, it it is, they must attempt to thwart it."

Finally, Allan C. Brownfeld, a faculty member at the University

of Maryland, writing in "Christian Economics," February 11, 1970, on

"The New Left and the Politics of Confrontation" noted that "in many

NW 68486 Docld:32989549 Page 219

## Page 220

..

instances, those extremists who have fomented disorder have been in

violation of state and Federal statutes." But, Mr. Brownfeld noted,

"what is often missing is the will to prosecute and to bring such individuals

before the bar of justice." Mr. Brownfeld's article was subcaptioned

"A Society Which Will'Not Defend Itself Against Anarchists Cannot Long

Survive."

TV. Appropriations Testimony

On February 10, 1966, FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover testified

regarding the Ku Klux Klan, saying that "the Bureau continues its program

of penetrating the Klan at all levels and, I may say, has been quite suc-

cessful in doing so. The Bureau's role in penetrating the Klan has

received public attention que to the solution of the brutal murders of

Viola Ivizzo in Alabama, Lieutenant Colonel Lamuel A Penn in Georgia

and the three civil rights workers in Mississippi. We have achieved a

number of other tansible accomplishments in this field, mosi i rache

are not publicly known but are most significant."

Discussion off the

record followed.

V. Public Support of the Counterintelligence Program

Following acknowledgement that the FBI had a counterintelligence

program, syndicated columnist Victor Riesel wrote on June 15, 1973,

"no apologies are due from those in the highest authority for secretly

"NW 68486 Dockd:32989549-Page-220

•".:

developing a domestic counterrevolutionary intelligence stratagem in

early 1970." Mr. Riesel detailed the record of "dead students,"

"university libraries in flames," and "insensate murdering of cops,"

and concluded "it would have been wrong not to have attemated to counter

the sheer off-the-wall terrorism of the 1969-70 bomb seasons. And it

would be wrong today. No one need apologize for counterrevolutionary

action."

"Our reaction is that we are exceedingly glad he ordered it,"

wrote the "St. Louis Globe--Democrat"' in a December 11, 1973, editorial

on the counterintelligence program. This newspaper noted that "the

Federal Bureau of Investigation under the late J. Edgar Hoover conducted

a three-year campaign of counterintelligence 'to expose, disrupt, and

neutralize' the New Left movernent." and that "many of these New Left

groups were doing everything they could to undermine the Government

and some of them resorted to bombings, street riots, and other gangster

tactics. Others waged war on police across the Nation and on our system.

of justice. Still others disrupted the Nation's campuses. The Nation can

be thankful it had a courageous and strong leader of the FBI to deal with

the serious threats posed by New Left groups during this period."

On June 18, 1974, Eugene H. Methvin, Senior Editor, "The

Reader's Digest," testified before the House Committee on Foreign

Attairs regarding terrorism and noted, "

...the FBI's counterintelligence

NW 68486 Docld:32989549 Page 221

---

## Page 222

program against the extremist core of the New Left was a model of

sophisticated, effective counter-terrorist law enforcement action first

developed and applied with devastating effect against the Ku Klux Klan

in the mid-1960's. In that context the strategy won great publicity and

- praise; yet now we have the Attorney General condemning it. In the

current climate of justifiable revulsion over Watergate, we are in

danger of crippling law enforcement intelligence in a hysteria of

reverse-McCarthyism in which we close our eyes to evidence and some

compolling necessities of domestic and international security."

THE BUREAU WHO HAD CALLED HIM ON THE WATCHLINE SEEKING THE

INFORMATION THAT. I KNEW DAMN WELL IT WAS GOING TO BE USED IN AN

UNRECORDED COUNTERINTELLIGENCE OPERATION TO DESTROY MR. YOUNG'S

CHANCES OF GETTING ELECTED TO THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,

• THE

REQUEST CAME ONLY A FEW DAYS AFTER MR. YOUNG HAD ANNOUNCED THAT

HE WAS SEEKING A SEAT IN THE HOUSE:

MY SUPERVISOR'S REACTION WAS, "NOW DON'T GET EXCITED ART,'

WE WILL MANAGE SOME OTHER WAY," AND I RESPONDED "I SUPPOSE YOU

WILL," • AND I TOLD HIM THAT IF HIS COUNTERPART AT THE BUREAU WANTED

TO FORCE THE ISSUE WE WOULD DO IT IN THE OPEN WITH LOTS OF PUBLICITY,

THAT WAS THE LAST I HEARD OF THAT REQUEST FROM MY SUPERVISOR AND

I NOTICED LATER THAT MR.. YOUNG MADE IT TO YOUR AUGUST BODY. SO I

MUST ASSUME THAT MY SUPERVISOR HAD NO OTHER SOURCE AT THAT TIME:

THAT COULD GET THE INFORMATION FOR HIM. YOU, OF COURSE, WILL FIND

NO RECORD OF THE ABOVE INCIDENT IN THE BUREAU FILES: .

I AM COGNIZANT OF YOUR MANDATE TO INVESTIGATE. THE INTELLIGENCE

OPERATIONS OF THE BUREAU AND OF THE GREAT MASS OF INFORMATION THAT

HAS ALREADY BEEN UNCOVERED REGARDING THESE OPERATIONS, I BELIEVE,

HOWEVER, THAT A CLEAR AND PRECISE PICTURE OF THE BUREAU'S INTELLI-

GENCE PRACTICES CAN ONLY BE SEEN BY ANALYZING THE ADMINISTRATIVE

STRUCTURE, THE ENTRENCHED BIASES AND THE PERVASIVE INDOCTRINATED

FBI MENTALITY THAT COMMANDS AND CONTROLS THEIR INTELLIGENCE PRACTICES,

IN THE INCIDENT. INVOLVING REPRESENTATIVE ANDREW YOUNG, IF: THE

SAME REQUEST HAD BEEN MADE TO MOST AGENTS WHO HAD REACHED THE LEVEL

WOULD HAVE GONE THROUGH A PROCESS WHICH. WOULD HAVE ELIMENATED

ALL THOSE WHO SAW ANYTHING WRONG WITH THE TYPE OF ACTIVITY

OF ALL OF THE PERSONHEL WORKING IN CONJUNCTION WITH ME ON THE

INTELLIGENCE SQUAD IN ATLANTA DURING THE PERIOD THAT THE YOUNG

INCIDENT TOOK PLACE ACCOUNTS FOR THE FACT THAT THE INFORMATION

• REQUESTED WOULD HAVE BEEN ROUTINELY OBTAINED, THE FEELING WAS

• THAT THE RACIAL MOVEMENTS IN WHICH MR. YOUNG WAS ENGAGED, : ALTHOUGH

NOT ILLEGAL PER SE, WAS INIMICABLE TO THE VALUE STANDARDS. THAT THE

SQUAD MEMBERS SUBSCRIBED TO, IF IT TOOK. A LITTLE ILLEGAL ACTIVITY

TO COMPROMISE THE MOVEMENT, THEN SO BE IT, PAST EXPERIENCE HAD.

MADE IT CLEAR. TO ALL AGENTS THAT MR, HOOVER HAD NO SYMPATHY WITH

ANY RACIAL MOVEMENT:

YOU MAY JUSTLY INQUIRE AT THIS JUNCTURE HOW I HAPPENED TO

SURVIVE IN THE BUREAU IF THESE SELECTION PROCESSES WEEDED THOSE IN

OPPOSITION OUT, THE ANSWER WAS AND IS THAT I WAS BOTH STUBBORN

AND SMART ENOUGH TO KEEP. MY RECORD GOOD AND CLEAR AND THOSE AROUND

ME KNEW IT, AS AN ATTORNEY AND SOMEONE WHO BELIEVED IN THE RULE •

OF LAW, I WOULDN'T CONFORM IF IT REQUIRED ME TO BE DISHONEST OR

TO VIOLATE THE LAW AND I KNEW THE LAW. I CAN SORROWFULLY SAY THAT

MY VIEWS WERE NOT SHARED BY MY PEERS IN THE BUREAU.

I JOINED THE FBI AS AN AGENT IN 1951 AND RETIRED IN 1971.

BY 195/ THE WEAKNESSES IN THE STRUCTURE OF THE BUREAU HAD BECOME.

ALL TOO OBVIOUS TO ME, IN 1950 AS A RESULT OF ADMINISTRATIVE.

ACTION TAKEN AGAINST ME BY MR, HOOVER, ON ACCOUNT OF AN ALLEGED

PROBLEM OF OVERWEIGHT, I FOUND MYSELF IN A YMCA ROOM IN MACON,

GEORGIA AWAY FROM MY

PAMILY FOR A PERIOD OF ABOUT

FIVE MONTHS.

DURING THAT TIME 1 DID A GREAT DEAL OF SOULSEARCHING AND READING

IN. AN EFFORT TO MAKE A DECISION AS TO WHETHER I SHOULD LEAVE THE .

BUREAU AND ATTEMPT TO EXPOSE THE WEAKNESSES IN STRUCTURE OR STAY

IN THE BUREAU AND WAIT FOR A MORE OPPORTUNE TIME WHEN THE PROBABILITY

OF SUCCESS IN CORRECTING THESE WEAKNESSES WOULD BE GREATER, • I

DECIDED TÔ REMAIN AND OBSERVE BUT I RESOLVED THAT. I WOULD UNDER

NO CIRCUMSTANCES PARTICIPATE IN ANY OF THE UNETHICAL OR ILLEGAL

• ACTIVITIES THAT WERE BY THEN SO PREVALENT IN THE BUREAU,

..... I WAS ABLE TO OBSERVE FROM MY VANTAGE POINT IN THE FBI THAT.

THE BUREAU WAS.ON A COLLISION COURSE OF COLLAPSE WHICH WOULD RESULT

IN CONGRESSIONAL INVESTIGATION, AND 1: SAID SO OPENLY AMONG AGENT

ASSOCIATES FROM 1960 ONWARD, I COUNSELLED WITH MANY, YES, PRACTICALLY

ALL, OF THE AGENT PERSONNEL WITH WHOM I CAME IN CONTACT AT THIS

TIME AND FOR THE REMAINING. 11 YEARS THAT I SPENT IN THE BUREAU AND

FOUND THAT THEY WERE VAGUELY AWARE IN 1950 OF THE PROCESS OF

WHICH I SPEAK AND THEY WERE ACUTELY AWARE OF IT IN 1971,

THE INHERENT ADMINISTRATIVE PROCESSES, WITHIN THE BUREAU WHICH

I HAVE ALLUDED TO BEFORE, WHICH" ADVERSELY. AFFECT. THE BUREAU'S

INTELLIGENCE FUNCTIONS CAL BE SUMMARIZED AS FOLLOWS:

1. SECRECY

MR. HOOVER THREW 'A VEIL. OF SECRECY OVER THE BUREAU AT

ITS VERY INCEPTION THOUGH THE GREAT MASS OF INFORMATION

HANDLED BY THE BUREAU COULD BE PLACED ON BILLBOARDS IN THE

MIDDLE OF TIMES SQUARE AND THE PUBLIC INTEREST WOULD NOT

BLOCK THE SIDEWALKS, BUI SECRECY SERVED MANY USEFUL PURPOSES

NW 68486 Docld:32989549 Page 237

## Page 238

TO THE BUREAU,

MADE •IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR

E PUBLIC OR

CONGRESS TO KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT WHAT WAS GOING ON INTERNALLY.

IT GAVE THE BUREAU OPERATION AN AURA OF MYSTERY AND GENERATED

A TYPE OF FEAR AND. RESPECT FOR THE BUREAU WHICH I PERSONALLY

FEEL IS UNHEALTHY IN A SOCIETY THAT STRIVES TO BE BOTH

DEMOCRATIC AND OPEN.

II.: COMPLETE UNFETTERED CONTROL OF THE PROCESS OF SELECTING

PERSONNEL.

THIS IS THE AREA TO WHICH YOUR COMMITTEE SHOULD DIRECT.

ITS GREATEST EFFORT; FOR IT WAS THROUGH A SELECTION PROCESS

EXEMPT FROM CIVIL SERVICE UNDER THE SOLE CONTROL OF THE

DIRECTOR THAT MR. HOOVER WAS ABLE OVER A PERIOD OF NEARLY

50 YEARS TO BRING IN THOUSANDS OF CAREFULLY SELECTED AGENT

PERSONNEL WHO WERE POLITICALLY DISPOSED TO THE RIGHT AS HE

WAS AND THEN THROUGH A PERSONNEL SYSTEM; WHICH OFFERED NO•

POSSIBILITY AT ALL FOR AN AGENT TO QUESTION HOOVER'S ETHICS

AND METHODS, TO FORCE THOUSANDS OF THOSE SELECTED TO LEAVE

THE BUREAU IN UTTER DISGUST SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY HAD NO

AVENUE THROUGH WHICH THEY COULD AIR GRIEVANCES INVCLVING

UNETHICAL OR ILLEGAL PRACTICES, FOR EXAMPLE, A YOUNG AGENT

WHOM I KNOW WAS SENT TO ALBANY, GEORGIA FOR HIS FIRST OFFICE:

HIS WIFE WAS A SOCIOLOGIST. SHE WAS OFFERED A POSITION IN

THE HEAD START PROJECT IN ALBANY, GEORGIA THAT WAS UNDER THE

DIRECTION OF A BLACK ATTORNEY NAMED KING, THE AGENT REPORTED

THIS INFORMATION TO HIS SUPERIOR IN ALBANY, HE WAS IMMEDIATELY

SUMMONED TO ATLANTA BY THE AGENT IN CHARGE AND TOLD THAT HIS

WIFE COULD NOT TAKE THE JOB BECAUSE THEY DID NOT WANT FBI.

PERSONNEL

OR THEIR WIVES ASSOCIATED

TH BLACKS WHO WERE

ACTIVE IN THE CIVIL RIGHTS• MOVEMENTS, THIS AGENT SUBSEQUENTLY

RESIGNED IN DISGUST,

IIl.. MANIPULATION AND CONTROL OF THE PRESS:

THE EXAMPLES OF THIS SUBJECT ARE LEGION,

THE ONE

THAT I

AM MOST FAMILIAR WITH WAS THE CONCERTED EFFORT TO GET

WHAT.

WAS ALWAYS REFERRED TO IN THE BUREAU AS "OUR FRIENDS

THE

MEDIA" TO PUBLISH PERSONAL AND VERY PRIVATE INFORMATION'

TAKEN

FROM THE WIRETAP WHICH ITSELF WAS OF QUESTIONABLE LEGAL:

VALIDITY ON DR. MARTIN LUTHER KING, OF COURSE, THE DAY TO

DAY MANIPULATION WAS ACCOMPLISHED BY LEAKING CHOICE ITEMS TO

OUR "FRIENDS", IT WAS NOT AT ALL UNCOMMON TO LEARN OF SOME

POLITICALLY DAMAGING INFORMATION ABOUT SOME. LEADING FIGURE

IN POLITICS AS HAVING BEEN DEVELOPED BY THE BUREAU AND THEN

ALWAYS AT A TIME WHEN IT WOULD BE MOST DAMAGING TO THE

INDIVIDUAL, THE INFORMATION WOULD SOME WAY SHOW UP IN THE

CHICAGO TRIBUNE OR SOME OTHER FRIEND OF THE BUREAU. IF THE

INFORMATION WAS MORE VALUABLE FOR PURPOSES OF POLITICAL

BLACKMAIL. BY HOLDING IT, THAN BY GIVING IT TO THE PRESS, IT.

WAS WITHHELD, THE LEAKED INFORMATION ALWAYS SEEMED TO INVOLVE

PERSONS OF LIBERAL PERSUASION, (FROM MY YEARS IN THE BUREAU,

I CAN ONLY ASSUME THAT THE BUREAU HAD DEDUCED THAT PERSONS

OF LIBERAL PERSUASION ARE SOMEHOW MORE APT TO SLEEP WITH

SOMEBODY ELSE'S WIFE, DRINK TOO MUCH LIQUOR, OR BE SEXUALLY

PERVERTED THAN ARE SOLID CONSERVATIVES.)

-7 ÷

BOTTOM AIDED BY THE SELECTION PROCESS.

THIS QUESTION OF LOYALTY IS INTERESTING SINCE, OF COURSE,

WE ALL LIKE OUR FRIENDS. TO BE LOYAL TO US AND WE RESPECT

IT AS A QUALITY. IN MAN. THE WATERGATE HEARINGS WERE

PARTICULARLY INFORMATIVE ON THIS POINT AS YOU WILL RECALL.

EACH OF THE WITNESSES WHO WERE IMPLICATED IN WRONGDOING IN

WATERGATE OPENED THEIR STATEMENTS WITH A BIT ON LOYALTY AND

WENT ON TO TELL EVENTUALLY HOW IN THE NAME OF LOYALTY. THEY•

HAD VIOLATED THE LAW, THE BUREAU HAS ITS PARALLEL IN THIS

CONCEPT OF BLIND LOYALTY, PERSONNEL HAVE BEEN WILLING TO

FOREGO THEIR OWN INTEGRITY TO ALLOW IMPROPER, UNETHICAL, OR

ILLEGAL ACTIVITY BY THE BUREAU TO GO ON UNCHALLENGED RATHER

THAN INJURE THE BUREAU BY A PUBLIC ATTACK WHICH MANY REGARD

• AS DISLOYAL TO THE BUREAU.

V, HARSH DISCIPLINARY MEASURES.

THE HARSH DISCIPLINARY MEASURES WHICH WERE THE HALLMARK

OF MR. HOOVER'S PERSONNEL POLICY ARE TOO EXTENSIVE TO GO

INTO AT LENGTH HERE. THEY SOMETIMES RESULTED IN HUMOROUS

SITUATIONS BUT VERY OFTEN IN VERY TRAGIC SITUATIONS, BY

THE MID-1960'S THESE HARSH DISCIPLINARY MEASURES HAD SO

ERODED CONFIDENCE IN HOOVER AMONG THE AGENT PERSONNEL THAT.

THE POLICY OF "JELL THE MAN NOTHING" HAD REACHED A POINT

WHERE INFORMATION COULD ACTUALLY GET. INTO THE HANDS OF BUREAU

SUPERVISORS AND IT STILL WOULD NOT GET TO HOOVER BECAUSE THE

HARSHNESS OF THE DISCIPLINARY ACTION MADE THE INTEGRITY OF

ALL AGENTS VERY PLIABLE,

IN A DEMOCRACY, DOMINATION OF A POWERFUL ORGANIZATION SUCH

AS THE FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION BY ANY SEGMENT OF THE

POLITICAL SPECTRUM THREATENS THE VERY EXISTENCE OF DEMOCRACY,

THE PROCESS RESULTS IN THE ORGANIZATION BEING USED TO AID THE

POLITICAL AND: PHILOSOPHICAL FRIENDS OR CAUSES

OF. THE LEADER AND TO

NEUTRALIZE ANY OPPOSITION:

• MR. HOOVER'S VENDETTA AGAINST DR.: MARTIN LUTHER KING ILLUSTRATES

THIS PROCESS: EN A GRAPHIC MANNER:

I SUBMIT THAT THE FBI NOW CONSTITUTES A DEGENERATE DICTATOR-

SHIP IN WHICH THE STRUCTURE STILL REMAINS BUT FROM WHICH PUBLIC

SUPPORT IS RAPIDLY BEING WITHDRAWN.. I FURTHER SUBMIT THAT SUCH A

DICTATORSHIP IS INCOMPATIBLE WITH THE CONSTITUTIONAL CONCEPTS UPON

WHICH THIS NATIONAL WAS FOUNDED,. 1. FEEL THAT THIS CAN BE HISTORICALLY

PARALLELED WITH THE ASCENSION OF OTHER: DICTATORSHIPS THROUGHOUT THE

WORLD.

I RECOMMEND THAT ANY REFORM WHICH YOU CONSIDER DEAL DIRECTLY

WITH EACH OF THE POINTS I MENTIONED. IN THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE

PROCESS BUT I URGE YOU TO GIVE PARTICUI ARLY CAREFUL ATTENTION TO

THE PROCESS OF AGENT SELECTION:

IN ORDER TO INSURE AGAINST RE-ESTABLISHMENT OF UNCONTROLLABLE

POWER WITHIN THE BUREAU I WOULD SUGGEST THE FOLLOWING:

1. SEEK THE REMOVAL OF ALL ENTRENCHED PERSONNEL INCLUDING

THE DIRECTOR AS QUICKLY AS IS PRACTICAL, NOT IN A.

VINDICTIVE MANNER, BUT FOR THE GOOD OF THE SERVICE.)

NW.68486 Docld:32989549 Page 241

## Page 242

•÷9-

ESTABLISH A SYSTEM BY WHICH LINE LEVEL PERSONNEL CAN

• REPORT UNETHICAL OR ILLEGAL ACTIVITY WITHIN THE BUREAU

TO AN OUTSIDE CONTROL AGENCY, ALTHOUGH THERE ARE SOME

CONSTITUTIONAL QUESTIONS INVOLVED, I WOULD RECOMMEND

THAT THE CONTROL AGENCY BE UNDER THE JUDICIARY, THUS

EXTENDING THE CONCEPT OF CHECKS AND BALANCES, AND THAT

THE TIME NECESSARY FOR SETTING UP HEARINGS AND RESOLVING

DIFFICULTIES BE EXTREMELY. SHORT, MAYBE AS LITTLE AS . .

SEVEN DAYS SO THAT CORRUPTIVE PROCESSES COULD NOT GET

STARTED..

3. THAT ALL PERSONNEL WORKING WITHIN THE AGENCY AND ALL NEW

PERSONNEL WORKING WITHIN THE AGENCY. BE REQUIRED TO ATTEND

INSTRUCTIONAL CLASSES GIVEN BY VARIOUS EDUCATIONAL:

INSTITUTIONS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY. IN WHICH THE RIGHTS AND

DUTIES OF BUREAU EMPLOYEES WOULD BE THOROUGHLY •TAUGHT SO

THAT WE WOULD NOT HAVE PEOPLE LIKE JIM MCCORD IN THE

WATERGATE SITUATION TELLING THE SENATE IN YEARS TO COME

THAT HE THOUGHT THAT WHAT WAS OBVIOUSLY ILLEGAL COULD BE

MADE LEGAL BY THE FLICK OF A PEN BY THE ATTORNEY GENERAL.

LEGISLATE THE PROCESS OF AGENT SELECTION IN SUCH A WAY

THAT FUTURE PERSONNEL WOULD REPRESENT THE FULL SPECTRUM

OF AMERICAN SOCIETY INSTEAD OF ONLY A NARROW SEGMENT AS

IT NOW DOES. EITHER REDUCE THE PAY OF AGENT PERSONNEL

OR ESTABLISH EDUCATIONAL REQUIREMENTS FOR ADMISSION THAT

WOULD JUSTIFY THE CURRENT HIGH-PAY STANDARDS, I WOULD

PREFER THAT THE STANDARDS BE MADE HIGHER AND LEAVE THE

PAY WHERE IT IS.

TELEVISION PLAY AS THEY DID IN THE PHILADELPHIA-MISSISSIPP

CASE AND; AS I BELIEVE, DISTORT THE TRUE PICTURE IN AN

EFFORT TO PROTECT THE BUREAU IMAGE, THEN I FEEL THESE

RECORDS SHOULD BE THROWN OPEN TO ALL OF THE MEDIA TO DO

WITH AS THEY CHOOSE IN THE INTEREST OF PROTECTING THE

FIRST AMENDMENT,) YOU HAVE HERE A CASE OF INVERSE ABRIDGE-

MENT OF THE FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHTS, PROHIBIT THE PRACTICE:

OF ALLOWING THE DIRECTOR TO USE BUREAU FACILITIES TO

PONTIFICATE THROUGH THE GUISE OF NEWS RELEASES IN WHICH

HE NEVER SUBMITS TO CROSS EXAMINATION BY THE PRESS, IT

SEEMS THAT MR. KELLEY HAS MODERATED THIS EVIL TO SOME

EXTENT. BUT IF YOU DON'T PROHIBIT THE PRACTICE THROUGH

LEGISLATION, HE OR A FUTURE DIRECTOR, ONCE THEY FEEL MORE

SECURE WOULD UNDOUBTEDLY FALL BACK ON THIS ODIOUS PRACTICE,
