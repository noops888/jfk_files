Black Nationalist Writers in Paris

I. At present there dows not saem to be many black nationalist

(merican Negro) writers residing in Paris, apart from William

Gardner SMITH who is employed by Agence France Presse as editor

of its English language service; the latter is now at work on a book

about his summer trip to the United States and meetings with black

power and other civil rights activists there.

2. According to Carlene POLITE, American Negro writer living

in Paris who is of moderate views although she knows many black

nationalists here, there are a couple of young Negro writers being

handled by Ellen WRIGHT, white widow of the late Richard WRIGHT

(author of Native Son), who is now a literary agent at 20, rue Jacob, Paris6.

"3. Ellen WRIGHT's daugbter Julia is married to a Frenchman

-named Ferve, and Julia is an editor of Jeune Afrique. The Herves lived

in Ghana along with the William Garder SMITHS until the coup which

coverthrew Nkrumah. Ellen WRIGHT has another daughter who, accord-

ing to Carlene POLITE, was seen at a jazz concert on 7 January with

"wen BI3BS. BIBBS, according to FOLITE, has written some pamphlets

which he has had published himself, as well as a poem or pampblet

/attacking James BALDWIN as an inadequate leader of his people (whom

be characterizes as a homosexual). Julia Herve and her husband want

to publish BIBBs' work, according to POLITE.

Leroy HAYNES an American Negro about 56 years old has been

a resident of France for eighteen years and runs an American Negro

restaurant near Pigalle. HAYNES is mentioned in William Gardner

SMITH's last novel, The Stone Face. His restaurant is a meeting place

for all American Negroes who visit France.

His guest book contains

"aignatures of the Martin Luther KING group and Stokely CARMICHAEL.

HAYNES gave a party for CARMICHAEL during his recent visit to Paris.

5.

--HIMES and Ale: HALEY. According to HAYNES, HIMES is not known

for his nationalist views and now mainly an author i crime novels.
