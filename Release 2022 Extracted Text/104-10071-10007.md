n Paris who is of moderate views although she knows many black
nationalists here, there are a couple of young Negro writers being
uw handled by ENen WRIGHT, white widow of the late Richard WRIGHT
(author of Native Son), who is now a literary agent at 20, rue Jacob, Paris 6,

“3, Ellen WRIGHT's daughter Julia is married toa Frenchman
~named Herve, and Julia is an editor of Jeune Afrique. The Herves lived
in Ghana along with the William Gardner SMITHS until the coup which
.overthrew Nkrumah. Ellen WRIGHT has another daughter who, accord-
[ ing to Carlene POLITE, was seen at a jazz concert on 7 January with
