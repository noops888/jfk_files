MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD eathorr arte

SUBJECT: "American Defectors to the USSR"

1, The attached material was part of a soft file entitled
"American Defectors to the USSR", which was set up by SR/6
(Support) around 1960 and maintained by various SR components
until ca, 1963, The compilations were derived from.a variety —
of sources, and contain both classified and overt data,

2, Inthe fall of 1966, the files were turned over to CI
Staff, In most instances, basic information was then abstracted
for the US Defector Machine Program, In all instances in which
the material was unique, or represented a valuable collation effort,
it has been incorporated into the appropriate 201 file, along with
a copy of this memorandum, :

3, It is suggested that any dissemination of this data should
be coordinated with SB Division and with CI Staff (CI/MROQ), in
view of the frequently inadequate sourcing and of the fact that
disseminations have already been made through the US Defector

Machine Program, ’ oF
