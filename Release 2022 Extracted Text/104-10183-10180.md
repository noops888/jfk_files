b. AMLASH/2 = A/2 1s currently staying with[Jose Luis
GONZALEZ Gallerretta, Attache of Cuban Embassy, Madrid
“(telephone 273-9687)} According to AMWHIP/1, (GONZALEZ who)
was usually known by his matronymic[Gallerretta), is anti-
Communist, friendly to AMLASH/1, a friend of AMLASH/2's
and who can be trusted to a reasonable degree (at least
to the point of not willingly compromising AMLASH/L),

d. A_Letter from Jose de Jesus JINJAUMA to Carlos
ZARRAGA, The letter in question was received by ZARRAGA
from JINJAUMA, stated that certain dissident and pri-
marily DR types were ready to take action against Castro
provided their personal safety and future means’ of sub-~

istence were guaranteed. . It named AMWHIP/1's friend

06 (Marcelo (Marzo) ARTINE Vega)as the channel for trans~
‘ittal of these guarantees. ZARRAGA, we recalled, is a
former JURE member who had recently resigned. The people
involved in the letter, in addition to JINJAUMA, were

identified as follows:

Captain (fnu) GIRON,
Luis FERNANDEZ de la Camara (member of Fidel's personal

body guard) i"

Guillermo (Billikéng)
Garcia RIESTRA
AMLASH/1

Tony CASTELLS&

Faure CHOMON

In discussing the letter with AMWHIP/1, he stated that
it was quite likely that this letter was legitimate and,
while JINJAUMA might have asked for such guarantecs, it
was unlikely that AMLASH/1 would have himself required
such guarantees. (C/O Comment: We report this as told
to us by AMWHIP/1 but do feel that duc to the closeness

op

Gp


of AMWHIP/1 and AMLASH/1, AMWHIP/1 may be allowing
AMLASH/1 the benefit of the doubt in this case.)
AMWHIP/1 stated that he knew all of the people in

the letter except Captain (fnu) GIRON. He stated

that it had been quite likely for JINJAUMA to write

to Gallerretta as they had been, as were all the |
others mentioned in the letter, hed-teen members of .
the old UIR group which functioned as a counter-
terrorist element against Batista's first regime circa
‘1944, AMWHIP/1 stated that, in fact, Fidel Castro
himself had been a’ member of the UIR. AMWHIP further
stated that there was no doubt in his mind that Fidel,
knowing these men as he did, was well aware of their
antagonism tevards his regime, Other members of the
UER. which AMWHIP/1 could recall were as follows:

Marin DAPICO Antonio oa

Herminio Diaz (friend of AZMEQEIRAS) -

Laureano ALVAREZ (presently in N.Y.C., Tel. LUdlow
9-0209)

r
Armando CORREA (presently in Miami)
Jesus DIEGUEZ (presently in Miami)
two PARSONS brothers (presently in Miami -
Other data unknown) rs

ZARRAGA of course was also a member of the UIR, ANWHIP/1
stated that the most influential members of this group
Were or had been JINJAUMA, Fernandez de la CAMARA,
Billiking, and possibly Marin DAPICO. AMWHIP/1 stated
that these people were action types and were reasonably
close-knit so far as their loyalty to each other and
in turn the organization was concerned.

e. AMWHIP/1 was also asked to elicit from AMLASH/2
any information which the latter might have concerning
Cuban officials with their hands “in the till" or other-
wise knocking down on the Government, and/or putting money

away in foreign banks,

3. Finances,
AMWHIP/L was given a token gift of a box of 50 cigars

in appreciation for the amount of time he freely devotes to
KUBARK business. He reluctantly accepted the sum of $500 against
his ops expenses in the past and for the coming trip to Europe,

It was thought, by the way, that a $1000 or more would have been

ore ay
eer


a much more realistic figure to have given him, However, as he
has always déae in the past, he is reluctant to accept money for
his services or for his expenses incurred on KUBARS's behalf.
He did admit, however, that he would probably again be touched
for a "loan" by AMLASH/2 and,as he laughingly Stated,these "loans"
«242 habitually +z ..«' forever. We also estinated that the
various transoceanic phone calls he has made in pis behalf, the 06
expenses he will incur in entertaining ‘AMLASH/2 Abbe to BLANCO,

o> Cixbsaru/is and others will easily exceed the $500 he has been
‘advanced. A signed receipt was obtained,

4. . Security

There were no incidents of a security nature to report
as stated above. There were very few people in the offices due
to the fact that today was Yom Kipper.
