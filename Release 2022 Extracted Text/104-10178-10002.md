WARNING NOTICE-SENSITIVE INTELLIGENCE SOURCES & METHODS INVOLVED

1,. We understand from press accounts that Orlando Bosch,
WKSCARLET-3 and several other, Cuban exiles were recently arrested
and charged with the sabotage of a Cubana Airlines airliner on
6 October. After having read these accounts NOC Byron W., GUTRADT
reported, for the record, that he once knew Bosch and WKSCARLET-3
in the early 1960's. ‘GUTRADT met WKKSCARLET-3 in 1964 when both
were enrolled in OCS at Fort Benning, Georgia. GUTRADT at that
time had already terminated his relationship with BKHERALD.

While at OCS GUTRADT was not particularly close to WKSCARLET-3
but WKSCARLET-3 was generally knowledseable of GUTRADT's back-
ground and past BKHERALD activities. GUTRADT has not seen
WKSCARLET-3 since 1964 after completion of the OCS course and
doukts seriously that WKSCARLET-3 would rererber him.

2. GUTRADT met Bosch circa 1963 in Miami when GUTRADT was
training Bosch in a BKHERALD-sponsored procrar. Bosch only knew
GUTRADT in alias. GUTRADT has not seen Bosch since completion

of this training.

3. Given the length of time that has elapsed plus the lack
of closeness to either WKSCARLET-3 or Bosch, GUTRADT and the
Station do not believe that their knowledge cf his past BKHERALD
activities presents any security problems today. GUTRADT, of
course, was unwitting of their alleged current activities and
was surprised to hear of, the borbing of the Cvtana airliner.
