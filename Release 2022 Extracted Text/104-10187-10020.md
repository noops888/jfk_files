Please forward the request for project renewal so that it
reaches Headquarters by 1 November. In accordance with the
questions raised during the past renewal period, as outlined
in paragraph two of referenced dispatch, please clearly point
out in the renewal that the value of all assets under this
project have been reviewed, and list those agents who have
been terminated, In referring to the justification of the
retention of three photographic surveitilance bases directed
at LIMERICK, the Station may merely make the statement that
they are justified, and refer to HMMA 23343 (which is avail-
able at Headquarters) for more details.

2. Any examples of where the take from LIENTRAP, LICAILA,—
LILYRIC, LIMITED contributed directly to the success of any
operation should be set out. With reference to LICALLA, and
the statement in paragraph 2 of HMMA 23343 that LICALLA providas
information which is of LAURICLE interest, please either provide
more particulars or refer to specific dispatches forwarded
Headquarters which the desk can trace, in order to provide
additional justification for the project.

3. Headquarters notes that the last progress report
covered the period through April 1964, and that another ono
is due. In view of the close attention paid to operational
reporting by the reviewing authorities, we suggest that another
progress report be prepared for the next quarter (May through
July) rather than waiting to include this period in the renewal

request.

A separate dispatch has been prepared on Raymond A. GERENTE,
suggesting that he be more fully utilized. ‘ith regard to the
photo surveillance basehouses and basehouse keepers under the LIEMPTY
Project, it is requested that during the next project year special
attention be given to the value of the take from each of these bases
keeping in mind the possibility of reducing the number of photo
basehouses against the LIMERICK target to at least two basehouses
without reducing the effectiveness. of KUBARK's coverage of this
prime target. If the Station finds that adequate coverage can only
be obtained through the continued use of all the assets presently
employed under the LIEMPTY Project, special detail should be presented
in the next Project Renewal Request which would justify their

continuance.
