It is to be noted the San Antonio Office advised
in connection with its interview of the subject on Febru-
ary 14, 15, and 16, 1961, that the subject appeared com-
pletely co-operative during the interview and at no time
\ refused to answer questions. It was further stated by
' San Antonio that it was the opinion of the interviewing Agents

that subject probably told the truth with regard to the bulk

of the information furnished by him and if he did distort any
|. information, it would have been in connection with his acti-
vities in Europe during the Summer of 1960 and his alleged
connections with anti-Franco and anti-SALAZAR activities.

San Antonio cautioned, however , that it did not
feel that it was possible to make a definite statement
as to the authenticity of the information furnished by
the subject or whether or not subject and his group are
bona fide defectors from the CASTRO regime. It is noted
by the San Antonio Office that subject and all members
of his group positively expressed their desire to actively .
oppose CASTRO, not by forming political groups in the
United States, but by returning to Cuba and providing
actual military opposition to the present Cuban Government.

_ The San Antonio Office pointed out also that in
view of the fact that Captain WOODROW Y. CHIN, CIC, Fort
Hood, Texas, headed a special team of investigators inter-
viewing the subject for a period of almost three -weeks con-
cerning military matters, the San Antonio Office did not
dwell upon these matters and Captain CHIN advised San
Antonio that result

ure, and he returned to Cuba and organized the Second
Front. He asked the 26th of July Movement of FIDEL
CASTRO, the main fighting group in Cuba at the time, for
aid, but it was never granted. All the aid went to
CASTRO, who was in another mountain group in Cuba. Sub-
ject’s group grew from fifteen individuals to approxi-
mately three thousand in late 1958. :

_ Upon CASTRO's taking power in Cuba after the
successful ousting of BATISTA, subject's Second Front
group was practically disbanded, which, according to
subject, was due to the fact that none of the members of
the Second Front were pro-Communist. Subject stated that
FIDEL CASTRO kept some of the high-ranking Second Front of-
ficers close to him, but they had no command position.

‘ Subject said he attended official gatherings and had body-
guards, but had no command position. Z,

In July, 1960, FIDEL CASTRO asked subject to
make a trip to the socialist countries, but subject re-
fused. Subject stated that at this time he began plan-
ning his departure from Cuba, as he felt that FIDEL CASTRO
was beginning to work against him, and that eventully a
situation would occur whereby subject would be arrested and
placed in jail. He said that because of his opposition to
CASTRO’s Communist actions, he was accused in newspapers,
on the radio, and by rumor, with being with counter-révolu-
tionary elements in bombings in Havana, and with involvement
| with groups of anti-CASTRO individuals who fled to the
Escambray Mountains, and in GUTIERREZ’ opinion, these were
CASTRO tactics to build up the image of the subject in the
minds of the Cuban people so that subject's incarceration
could be justified.

CASTRO Government to demolish the old market place in
Havana. Subject said that he fled Cuba, since it appeared
to him that arrest, trial, and probable imprisonment by
the CASTRO Government seemed imminent, and that in order

to fight for survival and to reorganize opposition

forces here in the United States, it appeared necessary

to defect when he did. Subject said he feels he has

been misled by CASTRO, and that since his value in Cuba
had diminished, he felt he could be of more use in the
United States consolidating and mobilizing resistance
forces here to return to Cuba in a body. He said his
immediate plan was to organize a force of sufficient z

Revolutionary Army appears to have been changed from a
fighting force to such tasks as operating labor battalions
and construction battalions, and that the primary function
of a fighting army has been delegated to the militia,
which, according to the subject, could reach a mobilized
force of approximately two hundred thousand men. Sub-
ject stated the militia is composed entirely of workers
who cannot be separated. from their regular tasks for an
extended period without causing complete paralysis of

all industry. Subject estimated that there was a per-

re It was subject's opinion that at the time of
his departure from Cuba, the only group which could be
considered loyal to the CASTRO Regime was the civilian
militia, and that their loyalty stems more from CASTRO's
constant reminders that they are the principal force
