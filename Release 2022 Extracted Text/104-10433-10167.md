FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE: ”
-

in observance of the tenth anniversary of President Kennedy's deat,

the Committee to Investigate Assassinations is sponsoring ‘a two-day

Conference at Georgetown University on Novenber 23rd and 2sth. A

brochure describing the Conference and its progran 1s attached. .As

you will note, seve#al of the Nation's prominent writers and investi-

gators of the assassinations of the past decade will speak.

While a number of differént points of view on the subject will be
represented, there is general consensus that the Executive Branch has
failed to make knova all the relevant fects of the assassinations...
We believe that the Congress nust ultinately take the initiative 1f
the public is to learn all -of the facts, and that Watergate has shown

us that Congreas’ action depends largely on disclosures by an informed

~ press and other news media.

A press paso will be available for you at the Conference registration

desk, For further information, please contact:
