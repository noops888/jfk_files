SUBJECT: Garrison Investigation of Kennedy Assassination: an
‘Allegations of Involvement, CIA and Cuban 1

as of the SB Division wrote 3 memorandum

entitled “Possible DRE Animus Toward President Kennedy” and dated

% March 1967. At that time Mr. Thomas had recently returned froin @
tour of duty in Yugoslavia, While there he had read about the Warren
Commission's investigation and had noted the pre-seaascination encounter
ia New Orleans between Carlos Bringuler of the Student Revolutionary
Directorate (DRE) and Lee Harvey Oswald. He secalled hie own dealings
tn Miami with the DRE, a CLA-subeldized group. He considered the
DRE inernbers whorn'he knew to be unpredictable and untrustworthy. He
speculated as to whether DRE elemento could have been involved in the
Kennedy easassination. He recommended that CIA investigate this

i possibility if it had not already done 60. Thomas was assigned to Miami
from July 1962 to August 1963. Neither CI/R&A nor SB has a retention
copy of the rnemorandum, but Mr. Thome is still at Headquarters.

Mr. Catvia Thom:

2. Mr. Arthur Dooley of CI/R&A discussed this matter with the

following :nembers of WH/COG:

a. Mies Margaret Forsythe. She stated that CLA's
interest in the DRE had beeri made known to the office of the
‘Attorney General by letters of 9 January and 18 April 1993
addresacd to J. Walter Yeagley. The earlier letter said, in
part, “The DRE Is of interest to this Agency which sponsors
and supporte ite propaganda and intelligence collection activity
in the Western Hemisphere . - «28 the DRE ie not a group
under complete Agency control, the avove docs not insure that
they will not undertake leclated paramilitary operations without

prior notification."

Hl b. Messrs. Howard Brubakerjthen recently returned H
from a tour of the Migav on Carl Trettin, DC of the ~
Ci Branch; WH/COG, who knew Bringuier and was stationed



Bee!

in New Orleans at the time of the Oswald-Bringuier
: confrontations in August 1963. It was concluded that
Oswald waa never a member: of the DRE, which in fact
rejected Rim, and that the DRE was not involved in the

assassination,

3.° April | dersigned showed a copy of the Thomas
memorandum to Mr. (Tom Flores} ‘tien C/WH/COG, who considered
that it reflected inadequr rmation and bias. It was agreed,

neverthelesa, that the charges which District Attorney James Garrison
was then begining to level against anti-Castro Cubans and this Agency
necessitated careful checking.

4. The first report tn the CI/R&A series on Garrison, 26 April

1967, Mated seven Cuban refugees then linked to the case (Sergio
ARCACHA Smith, Carlos BRINGUIER, Julio BUZNEDO, Manuel GARCIA
Gonzalez, Pascual GONGORA, Miguel Silva TORRES, and Carlos
QUIROGA.} It requested any additional WH/COG information about them
and about the following groups: the Cuban Democratic Revolutionary
Front, the DRE, the Information Council of the Americas, and any other
antl-Castro groups active in tha New Orleans'area. The request added,
“Information about CIA relationships with the above-named groupe should
not be restricted to.New Orleans but should algo include Miami and other
areas to which Garrison's investigations may lead."' Information wae
also requested on Edward'S. BUTLER, Alberto FOWLER, Emilio
SANTANA, and a parainilitary training site at Lake Pontchartrain. B

emorandum forwarded on 8 May 1967 the then AC/WH/COG, Mr.
b ilar atprovided the requested information and added, "WH/COG
wil nue to review all material that may contain information pertinent
to this subject and will forward such information to CI/R&A on a priority
bai :

5. Since that date CI/R&A bas prepareda series of reports on
the Garrison case, All of these have been forwarded to WH/COG. In
turn, WH/COG has provided additional information from its own files
and thoge of the Miami Station, to which It has addressed several inquiries.

6. CI/R&A to currently compiling a separate List of all Gubana
{as well ae other Latin Americans) whose names have been linked to the
Garrison investigation. This let will be forwarded to WH/COG with a
Fequest for checks if it contains any Identities not previously traced
against their files (including those of JMWAVE).

7. The problem arising from Garrison's charges of Agency
involvement in the assassination is compounded by ‘the nature of
some of our former Cuban operations, which resulted in a form of
indirect. association. ‘For example, Garrison has sought without.
success to extradite Sergio-ARCACHA Smith fromi Dallas. ‘FBI reporting
of 28'March -1967stated-that according toLayton Patrick Marten
Garri on’ Will try::to prove'that Arcacha waa the "second trigger mai
sination., The checks run by WH/COG and CI/R&A have not

reported that Arcacha‘waa the delegate of the Frente Revolucionario
Democratico (FRD) in New Orleans before the Bay of Pigs, that he
maintained regular postal contact with FRD headquarters in Miami,,

that the: FRD and the Cuban Revolutionary Council were supported by
CIA, and-that funds were supplied to the head of these groups, Dr. Jose
MIRO Cardona.’ ‘Consequently Arcacha may have-believed that his
activities in New Orleans were ClA-supported. This phenomenon of
indirect association appéars in other cases as well and may well undérlie
some of Garrison's accusations.

(8, It {8 Suggested that C/WH or his. representative might
profitably query Mr. Thomas about the allegations summarized in
paragraph 1, above. Although the date for the trial of. Clay Shaw has
not been it 1a plainly drawing closer. Once it starts, the newspapers
will carry a flood of accusations, old and new; arid it would be judicious
to be. prepared in advance.
