NOTE:

LCIA, Biami,

on

221/68 furnished report concerning

captioned anti-Castro group.

In part report stated Hector

Corpilot Liano either placed bomb at Soviet Embassy or made

Miant nded Cornilot reportedly was in kiant at time of

bombing and does not believe him to be involved. Report also

identified a number of alleged members of Cuban Power cells. 1C

Miami belleved the report is complation of unverified rumors

and determined from CIA that the source was the above-mentioned

Oscar Angulo Reyes. (S)

Angulo was

Interviewed 3/23/68 and in essence claimed

he had overheard a conversation between several Cubans, one of

whom was a woman identified as Irmina. Bousa.

Miami has deter= i

mined, however, that. Bousa was in hospital having baby at the

time and could

not possibly have been involved in the conversa

ne conversation he overheard and that his report to CIA wa

hereafter further edited by CIA prior being furnished to th

Miami Office.

From a comparison of the report mentioned in cal

referenced teletypes, it would appear that it is identical

(with the 3/26/68 CIA
