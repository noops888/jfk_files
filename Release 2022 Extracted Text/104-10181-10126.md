1. on 20-Oct 59, Major Rover: Cochrah of OBI and iis probable replace:
ment in Cleveland, NAJor Carroll Edelen,. dropped irito the office of the
; Cleveland Resident Agent to ask gbout Hobert E. Webster. In the absence of
c : . both Rittenburg and(John tezen) eg vere out on previc ily scheduled eppoint-

nents, ‘they asked one of the decretaries about the matter but vere told by her

that they vould have to talk with Mr. Rittenburg. .Cociran thereupon left the
following questions with the secretary réganiing the Reud-Webster cease, to
which he said that “high level air force interests" vanted an answer. These
questions, telephoned to Bot Travis on the same day, are as follows:

a. “Ie, this office doing anything concerning Webster's: defection?” :
bd. “If not, do they contemplate doing anythingt" i
©. “What would this office have done if Webster had retumed normally?”

2. Early on the 2let, after trying to reach Cochran unsuccessfully on a
the afternoon of the 20th to find that hie line vas busy, Rittenburg tele- |
Phoned the latter regarding this matter. Rittenburg had a secretary make
notes on the call, unwitting to’ Cochran. ‘ochran's first question, after the
usual "hello", was "Do you have the ansvers to those questions?" Rittenburg
informed him, "I don't know anything ebout this man, only what I have reed in
the nevepepers". He asked, "Nothing official?" to vhich Rittenburg reiterated
"No, only what I have followed in the press". Cochran went on to say tuat "It
tumed out it's not as bed as it looks on the surface. ie had no access to
classified material". During the conversation Rittenbur: informed Cochran
that he had tried to telephone the previous afternoon, bi found the tel-
epbone busy. Le also expressed his regret that he had n en in for Cochran's
visit and puinted out that the latter should have telephoned ahead. Rittenbury

"sada that he was sorry that he couldn't be of any help ‘n the matter, to which
Cochran replied with "Cleat la vie. Well anything I can do for yout" When
told “Not at the moment", he stated, "If there is, call re", for which Rittenburg
thanked iin before saying "Good-Bye". :

3. It was difficult to understand why Qvchran wuld attempt to make such
an approach to the Clevelend office, let alone expect answers to such questions |
as be put forth. :
