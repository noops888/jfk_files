Memorandum Branigan to Sullivan :
Re: ASSASSINATION OF PRESIDENT KENNEDY

. 62+109060
: Ae T
DETAILS: Sune :
iy. Mexvriman Smith, senior White House correspondent,
reported Garrison alleges David William Ferrie was associated
with a group of anti-Castro Cubans which trained at hal :
Pontchartrain, Louistana, during the period 1981-1962. On
February 23, 1961, CEA confidentially informed this Bureau
that in connection with a sensitive €2A project directed
against Cuba, one phase of which involved the training of
Cuban exiles, CIA would initiate a training operation at.
(Camp Belle Chase, located a short distance south of New Origans
and Lake Pontchartrain. CIA advised that this camp had been
a deactivated Naval base but would be reopened by CLA J
GIA further advised it would be
training from 15 to 40 Cubans at a time for a period of about
five weeks. We, of course, did not investigate CIA's activities
at Camp Belle Chase, Lowisiana, and)our files contain no(S)
te information that Ey Willian Fernie tad any connectionG th

this CIA operation.

Yn duly, 1963, we received information from seversi
sources that. a number of Giiban refugees had come ‘to New Orleans
from Miami, Florida, through the efforts of Rudolph Davis,
reportedly to attend a training camp after which they would be
sent to a trainiag camp in Guatemala. Sources reported this
group became disenchanted and returned to Miami shortly after
their arrival. VU

We interviewed Rudolph Pavis in this matter and he
indicated he acted as a coordinator between the Movimiento
Denocratica Cristiano GIDC), an anti-Castro organization, and
the New York City Police Department in 1961 and that he was the
delegate for this anti-Castyo organization in New Orleans. He
tated he came to New Orleans in August, 1961, and in early
1963 made friends with persone in the lumber business in
Guatemala with whom he formed the Guatemalan Lumber and Mineral
Corporation. Davis said he brought approximately 19 men to
New Orleans to train for lumber cutting work in Guatemala. Hoe
added that when the men learned they were to work in a lumber
industry and were not recruited foy military operations against
Cuba, they became disenchanted and returned to Miami.
files contain no information indicating that David Willian.
Ferrie or Lee Harvey. Oswald had any contact or connection with
Davis or the anti-Castro organigation which Davis represented. U
