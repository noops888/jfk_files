PROJEOP: QUASHED {of

1 af CIRCUMSTANCES OF CONTACT:

a. C/O met subject, at 1330 hours, 3) December 1968, for the purpose of
terminating ‘the source, Most of the meeting consisted of having lunch
while the C/O permitted the source to relieve his desire to talk about
the previous two months' frustrations, uncertainties and fear experienced
by the source and his wife, J-315/1l, as a‘result of the imprisonment of
J~315/12 and J~315/13. ‘

be The source had been asking repeatedly during this time for personal

" meetings with the C/O. These requests were ‘turned down for reasons of
security until it was decided to hold the termination meeting. The C/O
decided to let the source unburden his desire to talk to the C/o and
thus relieve his frustrations and get him in a good frame of mind,

c. C/O met the subject at the New England Oyster House, 125th Street and
Biscayne Blvd. The C/O took an indirect route to the meeting site. After
lunch the C/O and the source sat in the subject's vehicle, 1969 Chevrolet
station wagon, Florida license Plate 168321, and signed the necessary
receipts and documents incident to the termination. The source then drove
off. The C/O then entered his car, operational vehicle Chevy II, Florida
Idcense 1E-7522, and drove to the shopping plaza at 7th Avenue and 111th St.
where he called his office, advised them of his successful and safe termina~

tion, then took a deliberate and circuitous route to his home in Hollywood.

The meeting ended at 1625 hours and no surveillance afterwards was detected.
Lunch was consumed in virtual isoltation, for there were no other diners
within 20 feet.

26065 OPERATIONAL DISCUSSIONS;

“ ae The C/O listened to the source's conversation during lunch and
obtained the news that J-315/12 was no longer in prison in the Ge2 offices,
but had been transferred to a large holding camp at La Cabana Prison as
part of a group of several hundred other professional men such as doctors,
lawyers, etc, He had been assigned duties at the dispensary in hie capae
city as a surgeon and doctor, and he was in good health and was allowed
visitors once a week. His wife, J~315/13, had been transferred also to a
woman's rehabilitation center at an unknown location on the outskirts of
Havana, She has also received good treatment, performs no duties, and is
gaining weight. She lost while being questioned by the G-2, Both are
being well treated, have been given permission to urite to relatives in
the U.S., and have already done so.

b. J~315 said that he and his wife ware very relieved at the above
turn of events. Both believe that this indicates that their appeals through
the Vatican (Jesuits) and the medical commmity were instrumental in this
decision not to execute the two,

ce. d-315 believes that his father-in-law, J-315/12, blamed any wrong-
doing he was accused of by the GOC on him, J=315. J-315 believes that
J=315/12 probably admitted to some activity against the GOC, was probably
repentant, and accepted the usual offer of rehabilitation fo: :

his wife. J=315 seemed quite happy that his efforts nal Rave

prisoners. He feels that by permitting the present situation to continue
a few months, thus allowing a "cooling off period", the situation may
become favorable for further appeals of a humanitarian nature, requesting
the prisoners’ pardon and possible exit from Cuba, The C/O, of course,
agreed that the change of prison, assignment to duty and permission to
write, certainly indicated that the GOC was not considering violent action,
and expressed his own and the organization's gratification at this good
news. J-315 stated that when he felt the cooling off period had passed,
he had some more "aces" to play, and asked the C/0's opinion.

ad, J=315 stated that a friend of his, one sie FIouEROA, presently
a professor at the University of Puerto Rico, and “also the Cuban First

. Secretary in Rome during the beginning of World War II, At that time Cuba

and Italy severed relations. As a result, FIGUEROA was interned in, or
given refuge in Vatican City during the war years, FIGUEROA became a
personal friend of the present Pope, to the extent that the Pops became

God Father to one of the FIGUEROA children born in Italy. The two have
remained friends throughout the years. J-315 plans to ask one Juan Antonio
RUBIO Padilla, a friend of J-315 and relative of J-315/13, to visit the
Pope the summer of 1969 and convey FIGUEROA's personal request that the

Pope contact the GOC and personally intercede for a possible pardon Sy

exile of the prisoners, RUBIO is one of the prominent leaders of Catholocisn
in the world today and intimate frieni of set ows Fernandez, the Arch Bishop
of Cordoba in Spain. J-=315 believes such an appeal has an excellent chance
of success. The C/O agreed that this was a worthy effort and expressed

his wish that it succead. 2408 b

alerted that he was to transfer out of the area as 4 happened once before
during their association when Mario (P) had replaced him as J-315's
supervisor.
£, J-3S did not react in an adverse manner to the notice of temina~

tion. He agreed that cessation of operations was very wise and that he
Would keep the organization informed by mail, He did, though, earnestly
ask that although he was aware that operations were ended, that contact
with the organization be continued through the mail channel so that he
could keep the organization informed in the future. He also asked that,
if possible, he be permitted a telephone number to call either in Miami
or in Washington, or elsewhere, where he could contact the organization

- in the case of an emergency or when he had information om the prisoners
that, needed to be delivered in a hurry. The C/O stated that he would
relay his request to his superiors and advise him via telephone to a
pay telephone booth as had been done during the past three months, Je315
wished the C/O well in his new assignment and hoped that. they see each
other some day again, He hépedtthat if he were ever involved in other
work for the organization that he be placed in contact with a mature indivi-
dual whom he could talk te with confidence that he was dealing with an
experienced man, for although Mario was a fine individual, obviously dedicated
and sincere, he had found that he could not communicate his beliefs and ideas
as well as he could with the present C/O. C/O said that Mario had been
indeed an excellent individual to work with, but that sometimes old battle-
weary roosters seem to work well together.

ee 3-315 said he believed that the G0C did not have mich! proof of
any serious ‘crime against the prisoners or they would have’ executed them,
The fact that J«315/12's sister, Chucha, and her husband ‘had been picked
up and imprisoned in mid-November for questioning indicated that the Goc
investigation of J~315/12's e potivitdes had not produced too mech. They
apprehended: Chvcha poe tiece she was his secretary at his clinic.
The C/O agreed that, 8 were progreseing better than hoped and that
the future seemed » At this time the C/o brought up the subject
of the need for termination of operations, and tt dovetailed beautifully,
for J~315 had just said that he was glad that he Had not been dnvolvad in
J=315/23's overt political machinations for the last four to five months.

8 The C/o tora the subject that he had been directed to tenninate the opera~-
tions involving J=315 and the entire operation in order to safeguerd the
lives of the prisoners: Any contimiance of intelligence operations
against, the GOC would jeopardize their lives if detected. However, the
C/O desired that even though operations were terminated | that J-315 monitor
the status of the prisoners and keep the C/O's organisation informed. In
order to do this, the C/O was providing J-315 with a P. oO. Box in the
Washington, D.C., area so that he could mail periodical infornation con=
cerning the prisoners. The C/O stated that he was also providing J-315
with an allowance.for six months' expenses so that J-315 would not bear the
cost of monitoring the status of the prisonars alone. The C/O said that he
had recomended the sum of {125,00 per_month which had been approved by.
his sieriors. Additionally, he had recommended that J=315 be given two .
months' salary as severance pay. C/O continued, saying that he had been i 7

&. J=315 earnestly asked that the organisation. consider assisting
him to obtain a permit to carry a weapon in Florida. He stated he had
obtained a permit in Puerto Rico, but that he had no contacts in Miami
to assist hin as he had in Puerto Rico. He was afraid that he might be
the object of an attempt by the GOC to assassinate hin for his involve-
ment with IeRS/12. He cited the attempt on ex-Castro CAPT Oton PALAU
who was shot 6 or 7 times on 16 November, and is in critical condition in
Miami. J~+315 believes that he 1s probably on their list for assassination
and is ready to defend himself if necessary, He expressed deep concern
of his being aboard one of the hi~-jacked planes because of his weekly
round-trip between Miami and San Juan, Puerto Rico. He added that if an

- attempt is ever made to hi-jack a plane he is aboard, he would resist the

hi-jackers, for he fears if he lands in Havana, he will be sumarily shot.
He does not plan to carry a pistol aboard the planes, for he is aware that
he may be subject to search at any time. At present he fakes being lame
and carries a cane aboard, wishfully hoping that he could use that to over-
power any possible hi-jacker. The C/O replied that he would check this
request out, obtain an answer, whether favorable or unfavorable, and inform
the pees of whatever decision was reached.

END yo) COMMUNICATIONS: ‘

a member of the 111th HI Group, Miami. He is personally known to the
source as having been involved in intelligence operations in the Miamd
: area. The C/O is researching llith's reaction to the establishment of
Mr. Rodriguez as a contact for subject for emergency use and will include
that result as part of his termination report and summary of the imprison-
ment and status of the prisoners. C/O believes that we should monitor
their status in the future and make every effort to insure that J-315 and

his family or J-315/23 take no steps to embarrass ‘the U.S. by any accusa-

tions and/or publicity. In order to do this it may become necessary in
the future to have someone contact J-315 or his wife in order to permit
them to express their concern, fears or sorrow. This will act as a safety
valve and will enable U.S. to have advance notice of any proposed acts on
their part which may be injurious to the U.S.A.
