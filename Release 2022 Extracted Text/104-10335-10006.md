Re: ARRB Request for Additional Information and Records No. CIA-7

Dear John:

Pursuant to its authority under the President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records

Collection Act of 1992, the Assassination Records Review Board requests that the

Central Intelligence Agency provide access to any and all internal CIA histories or

retrospective studies or reports on the following topics:

1. The JMWAVE Station;

2. The Mexico City Station;

3. CIA activities with respect to Cuba covering the period October 1, 1962 to

January 1, 1964;

4. Two CIA stations whose identities will be conveyed to you orally;

5. John McCone as Director of Central Intelligence.

In addition, we would like to request:

6. All indices to CIA histories held by the history staff of the Center for the Study

of Intelligence.

This request should be interpreted in its broadest reasonable sense. To the extent that

you question whether a particular type of study or report is encompassed by our

request, please let us know and we can advise you whether we seek to include it.

Should any of these requests impose an unreasonable burden on you that we may not

have anticipated, please advise us so that we can work with you to modify or amend

the requests accordingly.

In requesting access to these materials, we are not designating them "assassination

records" and we are not, at this time, requesting that copies be given to the Review

Board.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Sincerely yours,

David G. Marwell

Dear David:

CIA SPECIAL COLLECTIONS

RELEASE I FOLL

2000

This is in response to your letter of November 8, 1995

in which you conveyed the request of the Assassination

Records Review Board to be provided access to "any and all

internal CIA histories or retrospective studies or reports"

on several topics.

We have begun to identify histories and other items

that would meet the Board's request. The CIA Historian is

assisting in this effort.

I suggest that we discuss with you or your staff the

possibility of modifying the request somewhat.

Several of

the items mentioned in your letter cover a broad range of

topics.

It would be helpful, for example, if the pertinent

historical time period for each item were specified, as well

as what topics in the requested items would be of interest

to the Board. This would assist us in excluding sensitive

information that the Board would regard as non-relevant to

the assassination or to the scope of the investigation.

Given the sensitivity of some of the materials

requested, we would prefer that you designate one or two

people to

review. the histories and other items in our

offices.

Please let me know your views on the above suggestions.

We appreciate the constructive efforts that you and your

colleagues have made over the past year to work out reasonable,

secure ways of handling documents.

For our part, we are

committed to being as

responsive as possible to the Board's

interests.

Sincerely,

John

F. Pereira

1. We are now at a crossroads on a number of issues,

including ARRB staff requests to review Agency files and

other materials which were not within the JFK assassination

collection.

A number of these issues have been pending for

over a year.

2.

One such request deals

A

specific history which has been

understanding that the JMWAVE history consists of 32

chapters and that they may not be all together in one volume

(see attached) .

In terms of timing, we need to move quickly

MEMORANDUM FOR:

(Directorate Focal Points for JFK Board)

FROM:

J. Barry Harrelson

DCI/CSI/HRG/JFK Project Officer

SUBJECT:

ARRB Request for Access to Selected

Agency Histories

REFERENCE:

ARRB Request for Additional Information

and Records No. CIA-7, dtd 8 Nov 1995

I. Background

In August 1996 with the concurrence of the Directorate

Focal Points for the JFK Board, Jeremy Gunn, ARRB General

Counsel, was given access to an inventory of Agency

histories (item #

6 of reference) held by the CSI History

Staff.

He made a list of 61 histories which might possibly

contain information of interest to the Board in its search

for additional records relevant to the JFK assassination.

II. Request

The ARRB's request is for access to the selected

histories to determine their relevancy or non-relevancy to

the JFK assassination story. It is not a request to review

the material for release.

Access by the Board's staff will

be limited to one or two members with appropriate

clearances.

Access to particularly sensitive material will

be limited to Mr. Gunn and/or Mr. David Marwell, Executive

Director of ARR. The Board, Mr. Marwell, Mr. Gunn and

their staff "CIA team" have TS/SCI clearances.

III. Procedures

1.

An HRG reviewer will screen the 61 selected

histories to determine if they have some substantive

relationship or connection to the JFK assassination story

(locations, time-frames, events, individuals, etc.).

a. It so, Hre will contact the Directorate Focal

Point for the JFK Board* and request that a responsible

component official review the selected history to

determine the level of access that may be given the

ARRB: (1)

access to the table of contents; (2) access

to selected pages/chapters, or, (3) access to the full

= chistory.

If the history is viewed as too sensitive to

Administrative. Internal Use only

---

## Page 17

13-00000

Administrative - Internal Use Only

be reviewed by the ARRB staff, the issue will be

- discussed with the Executive Director of the Board

and/or the Chairman.

b. If HRG concludes that the history is not

related to the assassination story, Mr. Gunn will be

asked to refine his request or drop that particular

history from his list.

A certification by the Agency

that the history contains no JFK assassination-related

information may be required.

2. After review by the appropriate Agency component,

the Directorate Focal Point will advise HRG of the approved

level of access.

3. HRG will then advise Mr. Gunn of the level of -

access

and make arrangements for him or a member of his

staff to review the history in designated Agency offices as

appropriate.

4.

Notes taken by any ARRB member are subject to

review

by the responsible Agency component.

If the ARRB

member identifies a history or any part of it as having

relevancy to the JFK assassination story,

HRG will again

review it to confirm the relevancy.

The identification of

relevant information in a history does not automatically

make the history an assassination record under the JFK Act.

Further discussion with the ARRB staff would be required to

determine how that information will be dealt with and its

possible release.

5. It you have any questions regarding this request,

please call me on extension 31825) or Gary Breneman,

extension 31839.

SUBJECT:

CIA-7, Request to Review Histories

1. This is in response to referent request.

2. The ARRB staff requested that it be permitted to

review the histories of CIA activities and components which

have been prepared over the years by, or under supervision

of, the CIA History Staff for possible leads to Oswald/JFK

assassination materials. CIA provided a list of all

histories for review by the ARRB staff. From that list,

certain histories were selected by the ARRB staff to be read

either entirely or in part.

Most of the selected histories

turned out to have no information relating to the JFK

assassination story. Those passages thought to have

information related to the assassination were marked by ARRB

staff for inclusion within the JFK collection and have been

placed in the queue for processing and release to the

National Archives.

3. This completes the Agency's action on this request.

If you have any question, please advise.

Subject:

CIA-7 Histories

The CIA History Staff has written or guided the writing of numerous histories on

projects, offices, divisions, or special events within the history of the CiA. In response

to the Review Board's Request for Additional Records and Information CIA-7, the CIA

provided an index to all the histories in the collection. This index was reviewed by

former Executive Director T. Jeremy Gunn and more than sixty histories which might

have contained information relevant to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy

were selected for review by the Review Board staff. Due to the sensitivity and breath of

information contained in the CIA histories, access was limited to two members of the

Review Board staff.

Most of the reviewed histories did not contain information relevant to the assassination

of President Kennedy. Sections of five histories were designated as assassination

records: DCI-8, CS HP-334, MISC-25, DDO HP 324, and CSHP 194. These sections will

be reviewed, processed, and placed in the JFK Collection at the National Archives.

The Review Board staff also reviewed the just published classified history, Fifty Years of

the CIA which was published in honor of the CIA's Fiftieth Anniversary. This history

contained no information believed relevant to the assassination.

MEMORANDUM FOR:

Bob Skwirot

FROM:

Charles A. Briggs-Y-

OFFICE:

DCI/CSI/HRG

SUBJECT:

Mexico City Station History

REFERENCE:

The Mexico City Station History contains at least 99 separate cryptonyms, for the most part

concorning projects, but in some cases, individuals, covering the period 1947 to June 1969. In

evory case, there is identifying information included with the crypt, ranging from a brief

paronthetical phrase to several pages of detail. Since the information far exceeds that thought

relevant to the JFK story, both in time and substance, an approach designed to provide a maximum

amount of information and guidance for historians concerned with the JFK assassination, with a

minimum of gratuitously useable leads for curious or hostile FOlA requestors concerning CIA

activities generally, was chosen and is reflected in the version the Board has for consideration.

The norm in handling cryptonyms when the entire crypt is not released is to protect the

digraph - the location indicator. What l've done here, to avoid unraveling, in effect, the whole

history of Station activity for subsequent curiousity seekers, is to reverse the process, releasing the

digraph and protecting the root - specifically because the text identifies each crypt. The Board is

familiar with the decision to release almost all Ll-crypts in full - while protecting identifying

information. The major relevant Ll projects (LIENVOY, LITEMPO, LICALLA, etc.) have had both the

full cryptonym and most of the details released.

Station and Operation Directorate division histories are among the most sensitive documents

in the Agency. They are very tightly controlled within the area divisions - they are not available to

clearod employees in other directorates or, traditionally, outside of the division within the Operations

Diroctorate. Thus concern about the release of the Mexico City History pages that, viewed through

the widest of lenses, do not appear to be relevant to the JFK story, is very great.

Re:

Status of Assassination Records Review Board Requests to CIA for

Additional Information and Records

Dear Barry:

I am writing to memorialize our conversation of October 1 regarding the status of

Assassination Records Review Board requests for information and records from the

CIA.

We discussed the following formal requests:

CIA-1 (Organization materials)

CIA has made records available to the Review Board. The Review Board

staff will continue its review and make recommendations to the Board

and will request further information, if necessary, from CIA. CLA needs to

do nothing further at this time.

CIA-2-5 Complete

CIA-6 (Cables and dispatches)

CIA originally informed the Review Board staff that these materials could

be made available by December, 1995. CIA now agrees to make the

records available (or to have a response) by the first of November, 1996.

CIA-7 (Histories)

Mexico City. CIA has shown the Mexico City history to Gunn. CIA will

compile the portion of the history that was shown to G. Robert Blakey,

BOARD MEMBERS: John R. Tunheim, Chair • Henry F. Graff • Kermit L. Hall • William L. Joyce • Anna K. Nelson

which will be processed as an assassination record. Gunn will then

determine whether there are any additional portions of the history that

should be added to the Blakey version. CIA will compile the "Blakey

version" as soon as possible and Gunn will promptly thereafter review the

documents.

Index. CLA has made an index available to Review Board staff and the

staff has identified certain histories that may be appropriate for review.

CIA will make available those histories that are of obvious relevance, and

will raise with Review Board staff any questions regarding the requests

where the basis for the request is unclear. CIA will begin to make

histories available on a rolling basis. Review Board has agreed to review

histories promptly once they are made available. Although it was not

discussed at our meeting, we would very much appreciate it if you would,

within the next two weeks, identify which histories you are prepared to

make available and those that CIA believes should be subject to further

discussions.

Cram's multi-volume counterintelligence history. Although Cram's

history was not specifically discussed. at our meeting, the Review Board

staff understands that the history has been located and the Review. Board

staff awaits its being made available.

CIA-8 (Intelligence community staff)

CIA will provide a report to the Review Board staff within two weeks.

CIA-9 (Publications and analytical materials)

The Review Board staff provided CIA with a list of certain publications as

they appear in an LBJ Library finding aid. CIA will report back on

recommended action to the Review Board promptly.

CIA-10 (Interagency source register)

CIA has compiled information responsive to the request. CIA will make

records available within two weeks.

CIA-11 (Duran's original statement)

CIA has been unable to identify to date Duran's original statement. CIA

will make some further attempts to locate it.

CIA-12 OMWAVE materials)

CIA will begin to make materials available on a rolling basis.

With respect to the informal requests, it is our understanding that:

CIA is inquiring into matters related to Spas Raikin. The Review Board staff will

discuss issues with CIA once the pending research is completed.

CIA is locating a cable number IN 24738 (7 July 62), which is identified in record

number 1993.07.20.10.18:29:650630 (Box 34, F 22), p. 2.

CIA is inquiring into matters related to Marilyn D. Murrett. The Review Board

staff will discuss issues with CIA once the pending research is completed.

CIA is continuing to search for HTLINGUAL records, particularly those

identified in Church Committee index that was provided to CIA by Review

Board staff. CIA is prepared to provide oral briefing on HTLINGUAL.

Please let me know if you have any supplements or corrections. We would very much

like to ensure that these matters are handled expeditiously.

As always, thanks for your cooperation and assistance.

Re:

ARRB Request for Additional Information and Records No. CIA-7

Dear John:

Pursuant to its authority under the President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records

Collection Act of 1992, the Assassination Records Review Board requests that the

Central Intelligence Agency provide access to any and all internal CLA histories or

retrospective studies or reports on the following topics:

1. The JMWAVE Station;

2. The Mexico City Station;

- 3. CIA activities with respect to Cuba covering the period October 1, 1962 to

January 1, 1964;

4. Two CIA stations whose identities will be conveyed to you orally;

~ 5. John McCone as Director of Central Intelligence.

In addition, we would like to request:

6. All indices to CIA histories held by the history staff of the Center for the Study

of Intelligence.

This request should be interpreted in its broadest reasonable sense. To the extent that

you question whether a particular type of study or report is encompassed by our

request, please let us know and we can advise you whether we seek to include it.

Should any of these requests impose an unreasonable burden on you that we may not

have anticipated, please advise us so that we can work with you to modify or amend

the requests accordingly.

In requesting access to these materials, we are not designating them "assassination

records" and we are not, at this time, requesting that copies be given to the Review

Board.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Sincerely yours,

David G. Marwell

Executive Director
