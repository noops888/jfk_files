Review Board

600 E Street, NW

Washington, DC 20530

Dear David:

This is in response to your letter of November 8, 1995
in which you conveyed the request of the Assassination
Records Revigw Board to be provided access to “any and all
internal CIA histories or retrospective studies or reports”
on several topics.

We have begun to identify histories and other items
that would meet the Board's request. The CIA Historian is
assisting in this effort.

I suggest that we discuss with you or your staff. the
possibility of modifying the request somewhat. Several of
the items mentioned in your letter cover a broad range of
topics. It would be helpful, for example, if the pertinent
historical time period for each item were specified, as well
as what topics in the requested items would be of interest
to the Board. This would assist us in excluding sensitive
information that the Board would regard as non-relevant to
the assassination or to the scope of the investigation.

Given the sensitivity of some of the materials
requested, we would prefer that you designate one or two
people to review the histories and other items in our
offices.

Please let me know your views on the above suggestions.
We appreciate the constructive efforts that you and your
colleagues have made over the past year to work out reasonable,
secure ways of handling documents. For our part, we are
committed to being as responsive as possible to the Board's
interests.

Sincerely,

John F. Pereira

MEMORANDUM FOR: (Directorate Focal Points for JFK Board)

FROM: J. Barry Harrelson
baaaaaed DCI/CSI/HRG/JFK Project Officer
SUBJECT: ARRB Request for Access to Selected

Agency Histories .

REFERENCE: ARRB Request for Additional Information
and Records No. CIA-7, dtd 8 Nov 1995

I. Background

In August 1996 with the concurrence of the Directorate
Focal Points for the JFK Board, Jeremy Gunn, ARRB General
Counsel, was given access to an inventory of Agency
histories (item # 6 of reference) held by the CSI History
Staff. He made a list of 61 histories which might possibly
contain information of interest to the Board in its search
for additional records relevant to the JFK assassination.

II. Request

The ARRB's request is for access to the selected
histories to determine their relevancy or non-relevancy to
the JFK assassination story. It is not a request to review
the material for release. Access by the Board's staff will
be limited to one or two members with appropriate
clearances. Access to particularly sensitive material will
be limited to Mr. Gunn and/or Mr. David Marwell, Executive
Director of ARRB. The Board, Mr. Marwell, Mr. Gunn and
their staff “CIA team” have TS/SCI clearances.

III. Procedures

1. An HRG reviewer will screen the 61 selected
histories to determine if they have some substantive
relationship or connection to the JFK assassination story
(locations, time-frames, events, individuals, etc.).

a. If so, HRG will contact the Directorate Focal
Point for the JFK Board* and request that a responsible
component official review the selected history to
determine the level of access that may be given the
ARRB: (1) access to the table of contents; (2) access
to selected pages/chapters, or, (3)access to the full
“= whistory. If the history is viewed as too sensitive to

eee

13-00000

Heer eeeeenery

Seeeeeeee : Administrative - Internal Use Only

be reviewed by the ARRB staff, the issue will be
~ discussed with the Executive Director of the Board
* + and/or the Chairman.

b. If HRG concludes that the history is not
related to the assassination story, Mr. Gunn will be
asked to refine his request or drop that particular
history from his list. A certification by the Agency
that the history contains no JFK assassination-related
information may be required.

2. After review by the appropriate Agency component,
the Directorate Focal Point will advise HRG of the approved
level of access.

’
3. HRG will then advise Mr. Gunn of the level of ©
access and make arrangements for him or a member of his
staff to review the history in designated Agency offices as
appropriate. a

4. Notes taken by any ARRB member are subject to
review by the responsible Agency component. If the ARRB
member identifies a history or any part of it as having
relevancy to the JFK assassination story, HRG will again
review it to confirm the relevancy. The identification of
relevant information in a history does not automatically
make the history an assassination record under the JFK Act.
Further discussion with the ARRB staff would be required to
determine how that information will be dealt with and its
possible release.

=‘. 5. If you have any questions regarding this request,
pease call _me on extension (31825) or Gary Breneman,

FROM: J. Barry Harrelson

JFK Project Officer, HRP/OIM
SUBJECT: CIA-7, Request to Review Histories
\ 1. This is in response to referent request.

2. The ARRB staff requested that it be permitted to

‘review the histories of CIA activities and components which

have been prepared over the years by, or under supervision
of, the CIA History Staff for possible leads to Oswald/JFK
assassination materials. CIA provided a list of all
histories for review by the ARRB staff. From that list,
certain histories were selected by the ARRB staff to be read
either entirely or in part. Most of the selected histories
turned out to have no information relating to the JFK
assassination story. Those passages thought to have
information related to the assassination were marked by ARRB
staff for inclusion within the JFK collection and have been
placed in the queue for processing and release to the
National Archives.

3. This completes the Agency’s action on this request.
If you have any question, please advise.

From: Michelle Combs 262 Gon

Associate Director for Research and Review
Subject: CIA-7 Histories

The CIA History Staff has written or guided the writing of numerous histories on
projects, offices, divisions, or special events within the history of the C#A. In response
to the Review Board’s Request for Additional Records and Information CIA-7, the CLA
provided an index to all the histories in the collection. This index was reviewed by
former Executive Director T. Jeremy Gunn and more than sixty histories which might
have contained information relevant to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy
were selected for review by the Review Board staff. Due to the sensitivity and breath of
information contained in the CIA histories, access was limited to two members of the
Review Board staff.

Most of the reviewed histories did not contain information relevant to the assassination
of President Kennedy. Sections of five histories were designated as assassination
records: DCI-8, CS HP-334, MISC-25, DDO HP 324, and CSHP 194. These sections will
be reviewed, processed, and placed in the JFK Collection at the National Archives.

The Review Board staff also reviewed the just published classified history, Fifty Years of
the CIA which was published in honor of the CIA’s Fiftieth Anniversary. This history
contained no information believed relevant to the assassination.

” 25 September 1998

MEMORANDUM FOR: Bob Skwirot

FROM: Charles A. Briggs-Y-

OFFICE: DCI/CSI/HRG :
SUBJECT: Mexico City Station History

REFERENCE:

The Mexico City Station History contains at least 99 separate cryptonyms, for the most part
concerning projects, but in some cases, individuals, covering the period 1947 to June 1969. In
every case, there is identifying information included with the crypt, ranging from a brief
parenthetical phrase to Several pages of detail. Since the information far exceeds that thought
relevant to the JFK story, ‘poth in time and substance, an approach designed to provide a maximum
amount of information and guidance for historians concerned with the JFK assassination, with a
minimum of gratuitously useable leads for curious or hostile FOIA requestors concerning CIA
activities generally, was chosen and is reflected in the version the Board has for consideration.

The norm in handling cryptonyms when the entire crypt is not released is to protect the
digraph - the location indicator. What I've done here, to avoid unraveling, in effect, the whole
history of Station activity for subsequent curiousity seekers, is to reverse the process, releasing the
digraph and protecting the root - specifically because the text identifies each crypt. The Board is
familiar with the decision to release almost all LI-crypts in full - while protecting identifying
information. The major relevant Li projects (LIENVOY, ene: LICALLA, etc.) have had both the
full cryptonym and most of the details released.

Station and Operation Directorate division histories are among the most sensitive documents
in the Agency. They are very tightly controlled within the area divisions - they are not available to
cleared employees in other directorates or, traditionally, outside of the division within the Operations
Directorate. Thus concern about the release of the Mexico City History pages that, viewed through
the widest of lenses, do not appear to be relevant to the JFK story,is very great.

Re: Status of Assassination Records Review Board Requests to CIA for
itional mation :

Dear Barry:
Tam writing to memorialize our conversation of October 1 regarding the status of
Assassination Records Review Board requests for information and records from the
CIA. .
We discussed the following formal requests:
=" CIA-1 (Organization materials)
CIA has miade records available to the Review Board. The Review Board
staff will continue its review and make recommendations to the Board
and will request further information, if necessary, from CIA. CIA needs to
do nothing further at this time.
CIA-2-5 Complete -
CIA-6 (Cables and dispatches)
CIA originally informed the Review Board staff that these materials could
be made available by December, 1995. CIA now agrees to make the
records available (or to have a response) by the first of November, 1996.
CIA-7 (Histories)

Mexico City. CIA has shown the Mexico City history to Gunn. CIA will
compile the portion of the history that was shown to G. Robert Blakey,

Executive Director: David G. Marwell

which will be processed as an assassination record. Gunn will then
determine whether there are any additional portions of the history that -
should be added to the Blakey version. CIA will compile the “Blakey”
version” as soon as possible and Gunn-will-promptly thereafter review the
documents.

Index. CIA has made an index available to. Review Board staff and the:
staff has identified certain histories that may be appropriate for review.
CIA will make available those histories that are of obvious relevance, and
will raise with Review Board staff any questions regarding the Tequests
where the basis for the request is unclear. CIA will begin tomake™) ) :
histories available on a rolling basis. ‘Review Board has agreed to review’
histories promptly once they are made available.. Although it was not '~:
discussed at our meeting, we would very much appreciate it if you would,
within the next two weeks, identify which histories you are prepared to
