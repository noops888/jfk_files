Classification Division/OIT

VIA: Director, Center for the Study of

FROM: John F. Pereira

Chief, Historial Review Group/CsI

SUBJECT: Appreciation for Assistance with JFK
Assassination Documents

1. This is to express my appreciation for the
important assistance that you and your colleagues provided
to the Historical Review Group recently. As you recall, we
were directed to count the documents in the 80 boxes of the
JFK Assassination files and the Oswald 201 File, in
preparation for the DCI's testimony before Congress on
12 May. This involved determining the number of pages in
four specific categories of information, consisting of more
than 160,000 pages. Without your Division's help, we would
not have been able to meet the short deadline.

2. Please extend my thanks to the following eight
individuals who assisted us:

Bob Shipp -
Maria Tovar.
3. Again, many thanks for your cooperation.
