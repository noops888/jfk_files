Re:

Office of Personnel Management Equities in the Records of the Federal Bureau of

Investigation Subject To The John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act

1992,44 U.S.C. § 2107

Dear Office of Personnel Management:

The staff of the John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Review Board has identified a

number of FBI documents that we intend to present to the Review Board for review of

postponements at the Review Board meeting on October 14 and 15, 1997. Among the

documents we identified are documents in which your agency has equities. These

documents are identified in the enclosed form. .

We are identifying these documents to you now so that you can decide whether you

wish to postpone release of the information in question. Please keep in mind the

provisions of the JFK Act which anticipate that information will be withheld from

public release only in "the rarest cases" and only pursuant to one of the provisions of

Section 6 of the Act.

So that we may adequately prepare our presentation to the Review Board with the

benefit of any submission you may wish to make, you must submit evidence or

arguments in support of any postponements you choose to assert in writing no later

than October 1, 1997. If you do not respond to this letter by the above deadline, we

will assume that your agency intends to release in full its equities in the FBI record at

issue, and we will recommend that the Review Board vote to release in full your

agency's equities in the record.

BOARD MEMBERS: John R. Tunheim, Chair • Henry F. Graff - Kermir L. Hall • William L. Joyce • Anna K. Nelson

EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR: David G. Marwell

agencies could, consistent with their current guidelines for JFK assassination-related

information, consent to full release of the information at issue.

›lease call Carol Keeley or Debbie Beatty of the JFK Task Force at the FBI at (202) 324

Dear Ms. Keeley:

This is in reference to your August 11, 1997, letter in which you forwarded documents

'concerning Declan Ford, William Gaudet, and Gerald Patrick Hemming for our determination on

the release of information to the John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Review Board.

Postponement under Section 6(3) of the President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records

Collection Act of 1992 applies to the records of Declan Ford, William Gaudet, and Gerald

Patrick Hemming. We have redacted personal information which if released would be an

unwarranted invasion of personal privacy so substantial that it outweighs the public interest.

Postponement under Section 6(4) of the President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records

Collection Act of 1992 also applies to the records of Gerald Patrick Hemming. This information

compromises the existence of an understanding of confidentiality currently requiring protection

between a Government agent and a cooperating individual and public disclosure would be so

harmful that it outweighs the public interest.

Document #7 regarding Gerald Patrick Hemming contains information that originated with the

Central Intelligence Agency (CLA); therefore, this document has been referred to the CLA for

review. You will be notified of the results of that determination. In addition, documents #8 and

#30-32 originated with or contained information that originated with your agency. These

documents are returned to your office for a determination. Postponement 6(3) applies to the

OPM material on pages 30 and 32.

Document #48 regarding William Gaudet contains information that appears to have originated

from the subject's Official Personnel File. This information should be forwarded to the

under those Acts.
