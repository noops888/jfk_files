Re: Office of Personnel Management Equities in the Records of the Federal Bureau of
Investigation Subject To The John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act
7.

Dear Office of Personnel Management:

The staff of the John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Review Board has identified a
number of FBI documents that we intend to present to the Review Board for review of
postponements at the Review Board meeting on October 14 and 15, 1997. Among the
documents we identified are documents in which your agency has equities. These
documents are identified in the enclosed form.

Weare identifying these documents to you now so that you can decide whether you
wish to postpone release of the information in question. Please keep in mind the
provisions of the JFK Act which anticipate that information will be withheld from
public release only in “the rarest cases” and only pursuant to one of the provisions of
Section 6 of the Act.

So that we may adequately prepare our presentation to the Review Board with the
benefit of any submission you may wish to make, you must submit evidence or
arguments in support of any postponements you choose to assert in writing no later
than October 1, 1997. If you do not respond to this letter by the above deadline, we
will assume that your agency intends to release in full its equities in the FBI record at
issue, and we will recommend that the Review Board vote to release in full your
agency’s equities in the record.

In many of the FBI documents with third agency equities, we believe that the third
agencies could, consistent with their current guidelines for JFK assassination-related
information, consent to full release of the information at issue.

If you have any questions regarding the documents identified on the enclosed forms,
please call Carol Keeley or Debbie Beatty of the JFK Task Force at the FBI at (202) 324-
0571 or Laura Denk or Kevin Tiernan of the Review Board staff at (202) 724-0088.
Thank you, in.advance, for your cooperation.

Dear Ms. Keeley:

This is in reference to your August 11, 1997, letter in which you forwarded documents

‘concerning Declan Ford, William Gaudet, and Gerald Patrick Hemming for our determination on

the release of information to the John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Review Board.

Postponement under Section 6(3) of the President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records
Collection Act of 1992 applies to the records of Declan Ford, William Gaudet, and Gerald
Patrick Hemming. We have redacted personal information which if released would be an
unwarranted invasion of personal privacy so substantial that it outweighs the public interest.

Postponement under Section 6(4) of the President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records
Collection Act of 1992 also applies to the records of Gerald Patrick Hemming. This information
compromises the existence of an understanding of confidentiality currently requiring protection
between a Government agent and a cooperating individual and public disclosure would be so
harmful that it outweighs the public interest.

Document #7 regarding Gerald Patrick Hemming contains information that originated with the
Central Intelligence Agency (CIA); therefore, this document has been referred to the CIA for
review. You will be notified of the results of that determination. In addition, documents #8 and
#30-32 originated with or contained information that originated with your agency. These
documents are returned to your office for a determination. Postponement 6(3) applies to the
OPM material on pages 30 and 32. i

Document #48 regarding William Gaudet contains information that appears to have originated
from the subject's Official Personnel File. This information should be forwarded to the

SUBJECT: ARRB Request to OPM
Barry:

On 11 August 1997, ARRB forwarded to OPM for review one OPM document containing CIA information. Unfortunately, OPM

‘September 1997 for our review of the CIA information contained therein. It was then forwarded through the entire system for review
under those Acts.

Upon my review of OPS' response {attached}, | discovered that the request should initially have heen forwarded to your office for
handling.

Accordingly, attached is a copy of the package of material forwarded to the Agency by OPM for your response to OPM or ARRB as
appropriate. | will advise PIRD that you will providing the final response and that they only need to advise OPM of same. Also attached is
OPS' review response. We have no objections to the release of the CIA information contained therein.

ff you have any questions, please call me on 31201. Frieda
