MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT:

17-18 February 1972

This memorandum covers recent meetings with

MPTROIKA-Y in New York City and in the Northern Virginia

The meetings were held under secure conditions and

there were no security incidents noted.

2. Operational:

a. United States - China Friendship Association

(USCFA) Study Group: QM)Y's persistent efforts to locate

and join a pro-Mao study group finally paid off..The manager

of the China Bookstore finally broke down under U>7's

campaign and put her in touch with a local USCFA study

group under the leadership of Mrs. Susan Narren. aka Frank.

04M-7 has attended one session and, based on her initial

observation, provided the assessment

of MIS. Warren attached

hereto at the undersigned's request..m7 believes she has

hit it off with Mrs. Warren because of her understanding

of dialectics (thanks to Andy Ness's tutoring) and, consequently,

she was instructed to attempt to develop a social-business

relationship with herg- With respect to the other members

of the study group; b7 claims that the situation,

to date,

has not been conducive to ferreting out the identities of

these individuals, but that she hopes that as the group

continues to meet,

some rapport will be established with her

classmates.

b. New School and language instruction:

(M.7

has formally enrolled at the Graduate Faculty of the New

School for Social Research in a course entitled "Comparative

Legal Systems," which

studies the theories, institutions,

concepts, customs and which purports to analyze and compare

the law and the administration of law in selected countries,

included China

Soviet Union. D7 will also enroll in a French language

instruction course in the near future.

Ramparts' Tours - New York Media Workshop's

Womens' Tour:

Acting on a suggestion proposed by Mr. Jason

Horn, CI/SO,

the undersigned raised the subject of the Women's

lour which is scheduled to visit London, Paris (where they

will meet the DiV peace delegation) and Rome from 27 May

25 June 1972 withMt7 and instructed her to attempt to determine.

the interest in and likely composition of, the New York

group and explore the possibility of joining such a group

and explore the possibility of joining such a group.oM7's

first reaction tothe tour was that the cost ($699, which

price includes airfare, trains, hotels, etc.) was

too high.

It was explained to her that the cost factor should not

deter her from following through. It was then that M77

voiced some concern that the timing of the tour mayzinterfere

with her own PCS departure (we had been talking in terms of

mid-May or June 1972 up to this point).

It was made clear

to her that no fixed date has been established as yet for

her PCS departure and that the aforementioned tour may well

prove to be.of operational interest, e.g. meeting the DRV

delegation and continuing the staging process prior to her

actual departure.? My said that she understood and would

look into the matter.

She did not believe she would have

any difficulty in covering for funds should she find herself

included on the tour.

d. South East Asia Reports (SEAR).: M7 produced

a copy of the first issue of sEar, a bi-weekly newsletter

put out by the New York University Students Mobilization

566. LaGuardia Place,

of this mimeographed new

left publication.

A copy of this first issue is attached

hereto. • One of M7's articles will appear in a subsequent

issue of SEAR.
