1967, The purpose of the conversations Kas to determine the most
suitable cover to be used under the broad umbrella offered by

Punkeler's various enterprises.

2. The following conclusions were reached:

That Di Gerveno will come to Caracas as the

a.
representative for some of lunkeler's sales lines.
Specifically he will he the representative for IDENTITY-1,

which is Hunkeler's marketing firm,

be In addition to representing INENTITY-1, generally,
he will specifically be IDENTITY-1's sales agent for IDENTITY-25,
IDENTITY=3; and IDENTITY-4 and possibly for ID NTITY-S.

3, IDENTITY-2 is the manufacturer of a wide variety of
industrial epoxy products used in the construction industry and
AB anti-corrosive coatings required by nost petroleum companies
in Venezuela. Hunkeler has conducted talks with ID-NTITY-6, a
large local holding cerpany engaged in a broad variety of business
enterprises. IDENTITY-6 is interested in marketing the (DESTITY@2
line, As sales agent for IDENTITY-1, Di Gerveno would also serve
see tcchnical advisor to IDENTITY-6, and would not interfere with
aResTiy-6's marketing activities. inder these circumstances Mi Gerveno
would enjoy a degree of immediate sponsorshin ty an important local
firm which should assist in the rapid solidification of his status

prospective buyers is limited. Such a line would not of itself support

discussion of financial arrangements. If, as we hope, Mi Gerveno
does make some sales, commissions will be payable to him. If under
existing regulations he cowld keep at least a proportion of these,
we would favor it as an incentive to work at his cever. {f not, we
have confidence that he is a weil enough disciplined professional,

to work at it in any event.

for Di Gerveno will take about 29 hours a week This would involve

NONOFFICIAL COVER REQUEST
FOR INDIVIDUAL

To insure the most effective application of nonofficial cover, it is
essential that cover requirements be brought to the attention of Central
Cover Staff in the earliest stages of planning. As soon as it has been
determined that an agent is to be placed under nonofficial cover, either
in the United States or abroad, a mecting with a representative of
Central Cover Staff should be arranged. (When outside recruitment of
an agent for a nonofficial cover assignment is contemplated, Central
Cover Staff facilities are available to facilitate “clean” reeruitments and
protect the agent against identification with CIA during the integration
period.) Initial discussions will be informal and exploratory and should

<ig.,fesult in the elimination of unsuitable cover possibilities. Central Cover
“Staff, Nonofficial Cover Branch telephone extensions are 5144 and 5122,

Following the initial discussion, and based upon it, a cover require
ment memorandum signed by or for the operating division chief should
be submitted to Central Cover Staff. It 1s specifically requested that a
headquarters case officer other than the agent himself be designated
to deal. with Central Cover Staff in the development of the desired non-
official cover, including the preparation of the cover requirement mem-
orandum, in order that this development may procced on a completely
objective basis, This memorandum may be keyed to the paragraphs
numbered-below to obviate repetition.

No commitments will be made with any cover organization ‘until
Central Cover Staff has been advised by memorandum that the proposed
cover and the agent's participation in the operation have been concurred
in by the field and/or the Chief of Operations, DD,P. Such memoranda
are to be signed by or for the division chief. Each agent proposed for
‘a nonofficial cover assignment is subject also to personal interview by a
designee of Chief, Central Cover Staff, for assessment as to his sult-
ability for the proposed cover. This interview, when required, will be
requested by Central Cover Staff.

At the conclusion of the discussions with the operating divisions and
discussions between representatives of Central Cover Staff and the cover
organization, two formal documents ordinarily will be prepared:

a, The fizst, a “Letter of Cover Instructions” addressed to the agent
will be prepared by the Central Cover Staff. It will outline exactly
the cover story to be employed and will specify what is expected
of the agent to maintain a proper relationship to the cover fa-
cility. Each item in the instructions will be discussed with the
agent and/or his case officer by the Central Cover Stat? case officer,
after which the agent will be required to acknowtedge the receipt
of these instructions, The branch chief concerned will also be

to a more compromising ccver status after completion of the non-
official cover tour.

. If this request is for interim cover, what are foreseeable plans

for eventual, more permanent cover?

Identity, relationship, degree of knowledgeability, and address of
person ignated to Chief, Benefits and Counseling Branch,
Office of Personnel for contact in the event of an emergency situ-
ation involving agent, as prescribed by HR 20-46.

Government or Agency-affiliated beneficial plans in which agent
participates (WAEPA, GEHA, Federal Employees Group Life In-
surance, Association Benefit Plan, etc.) and other personal in-
surance held, together with identity and location of beneficiaries

and whether or nut each beneficiary is witting of agent's CIA
affiliation. a

&

Agent's Selective Service, military or naval reserve status, includ-
ing current unit attachment.

Clearance status 0: agent, spouse, and other adult dependents
who will accompany agent overseas. Are spouse and adult de-
pendents knowledgeable of agent's CIA connection? His Govern-
ment connection? Has agent been polygraphed?

». OPERATIONAL INFORMATION
Type of Operation. *

The general type of operation involved, Le., CA, FI, COMMO,
Logistics, etc., and the expected duration of assignment. The
sensitivity of the opcration should be indicated—é.g., observation,

spotting and reporting only; case officer for established agents;

1

;

SECRET

recruitment of new agents; penctration operation—and a state-
ment should be included as to the identities of any individuals
and organizations, in the U.S. or abroad (other than CIA stafl
personnel, cover facility officials, and those listed under 2(C)
(4) above), who are or will be made witting of agent's CIA or
U.S. Government affiliation while he is under this nonofiicial cover.

. Location

The city in which the agent is to reside should be spectficaily
stated and alternates in order of preference should be given

. Indicate localities outside of agent’s permanent: location which

agent should be free to visit and state the frequency and duration
of such visits. Also it is important to know whether or not the
time and intervals of such mectings will be determined by the

agent or dictated by influences or circumstances beyond his con-
trol.

. Special groups agent should be able to contact

It is sometimes possible to relate a cover to a particular group
in the opcratior.al area, Le., social, cultural, political, commercial.
If this is considered an important factor in the cover, this aspect
of the requirement should be explained in detail.

. Approximate annual income which agent must be able to at-

tribute to the cover organization. Sound cover, of course, re-
quires overt (cover) explanation for a reasonable approximation
of the sum actually to be available to the agent through Agency
salary and allowances. However, a professional intelitgence
agent's qualifications frequently cannot plausibly command an
ostensible income from commercial or other lay sources nearly
approaching his Agency income, Firm understanding should be
had relative to the agent's living within his cover income. Reser-
vation of a portion of his Agency remuneration may be required.
A less desirable alternative is the provision of additional cover
for income.

. Estimate of the minimum number of hours per week which the

agent must devote to operational duties.

. Communications channels desired

In rare instances it may be possible to set up SW means of com-
munication through the cover facility. If this ts desired, the

justification and frequency of such communication facilities
Should be indicated.

. Cover Suggestions

Any specific cover suggestion or preferences expressed elther
by the agent or the operating division emphasizing the agent's
special suitability to the cover suggested andor the special ad-
vantages of the cover vis-a-vis the target.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, WH/3 =
FROM : Chief, WH/3/Venezuela
SUBJECT : Assignment of Emilio Rodrigues

1. I wish to make it clear that I do not oppose

__.__.. the assignment of Rodrigues per se to Venezuela, but I

do have some reservations on what he is going to be
doing. COS, Caracas intends to use him as the case
officer for the CIHAVOC and CITILT Projects. Since both
are basically CE/CI projects I think this is a great
mistake. The amount of research in these projects
necessarily requires a great amount of files research
which Rodrigues in his cover situation will not be
able to do. This will entail a greater amount of work
for the inside case officer, defeating the purpose for
which Rodrigues was originally considered: freeing the
inside case officer for developmental work.

2. The intoduction of Rodrigues into the CIHAVOC
Case will also intoduce one more step through which most
of the vital information that CIHAVOC-2 produces must
pass. For example, his info now goes through CIHAVOC-1
to the case officer. With the addition of Rodrigues
one more time consuming step will be added.

3. I am also of the firm opinion that different
case officers should be used for these operations
since both are penetrations of the same party and at
times produce similar info. In addition, both are
extremely sensitive and.the compromise of one could
possibly lead to the compromise of the other.

4. If£ Rodrigues was assigned to Caracas for the
handling of a sensitive case which exposure would be
embarrassing to the United States, such as a high level
political penetration or a sensitive Soviet/Satellite
Case then it would be well justified. However, I feel
that his assignment as an outside case officer for
these two activities is not since they could be better

handled and serviced from the inside.



: pe th 3 eel a

Page 2 18 August 1967

5. Finally, the cost of placing Rodrigues in the
field is not commensurate with his planned utilization.

It will cost over $49,000 for the first year and

approximately $35,000 per year from then on. See
attached approximate schedule prepared by WH/Support.
* An amount the current budget cannot easily absorb.

2, HUNKELER is a former staff officer who resigned from WOFACT
in 1964 to-éStablish a market research and marketing firm, He was
recontacted in the spring of 1965 and employed as an independent con-
tracter by the then COS, JMWAVE, who expressed the hope that this
relationship might set a standard for use by WOFACT of former staff
officers as long term clandestine assets and outlined HUNKELER's duties

and responsibilities as follows:

4, The following summarizes the progress that was made in these
areas during the two year Period of HUNKELER's contract status with us.

&, Cover was provided for a Berlin based agent, ANTHRILL/1,
Although the agent was terminated by Berlin Station, management of iis
cover was competently and professionally handled by HU! <
has continued to offer his services to WOFACT in this r
although he could provide a cover office anywhere in the Latin American
sphere, has specifically suggested Haiti) the Dominican Republic, Costa
Rica and Venezucla, Ho is now in the process of opening, on his own
initiative, branch offices in Venezuela and the Dominican Republic and
again volunteered them for possible use as cover, According to HUNKELER
Station Caracas has shown some interest in taking advantage of the offer
There has been no other use by WOFACT of this HUNKELER potential during
the past two years.*-Such use in the future is an open question depend-
ing in part on whether WOFACT has a-requirement for cover facilities
such as this, and ‘in part on the nature of our relationship with HUNKEL]

b, HUNKELER has met frequently with members of the Central
and Latin American consulur community in’ the Miami area, These assoc-
dations were enhanced by HUNKELER's activity and participation in
several international organizations concerned with business and social
relations among Latin and North American countries, Some operational
information was gathered about these persons, but none of them ever
shaped up as a valid’ intelligence target worthy of further development
and recruitment, It is not expected that this target area will be of
any more interest in the future than it is now,

c. HUNKELER has a large number of business associates through:
out Latin America and in his travels has contacted a number of governmen
. officials up to the presidential level, Most of these contacts have

been of a business nature, One of them, a Panamanian legislator, is of
some interest to the Panama Station, Interest in the others has been
minimal, Future prospects remain open, but must be considered as long

range,

d, There has been no use made of HUNKELER as a third party
recruiter and agent handler during his.two year tenure, He has de~
clared himself always ready and willing to take on agent handling tasks,
but the Station has found it more advantageous and efficient to use
inside personnel for this, It is highly unlikely that station policy
will change in this regard,

4,  HUNKELER has been on several business trips during this Period,
On these occasions ho was given an intelligence brief and his operation-
al expenses were defrayed by WOFACT, The results, in terms of dissemine
ated reports, have generally been negative,

5. Recently, HUNKELER proyided an introduction to some individuals
who have a potential for use in the JMUNION program, There was some
discussion of continued activity for HUNKELER in this program, but it
was the consensus that there was not sufficient promise in his contri-
bution to merit retaining him for this purpose alone, It can ba ex-
pected, hewever, that he might, in the future, assist in entree to
other persons of JNUNION interest,

6. Station JMWAVE is of the opinion that employment of Robert S,
HUNKELER bay not had tho results that were hoped for when the contract-
ual relationship was first established, Recognition of this was implici
in the renegotiation of his salary scale from $4800 to $3600 per annum
in March 1966 at the end of his first year's contract, It is also the
opinion of this Station that there ts little likelihood of improvement
in the near future althouxh it is recognized that a long range potential
exists, These statements are mado without prejudice to Robert 8,
HUSKELER, who has at all times taken a responsible, willing and coop-
erative attitude in his relationships with Station representatives. and
discussions of tasks and tho prospects of future employment, It should
be noted that HUNKELER wants very much to retain some torn of relation=
ship with the organisation, as much for reasotis of interest in the
intelligonce profession an for income he might derive,

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Operational Review of Robert S, Hunkeler
DATEs 16 “ebruary 1967 ecseceecs
Backgrounds

1. Shortly after Hunkeler resigned from KUBARK he _

met with the then Chief of Station on several occasions
concerning Hunkelers potential use as a Station asset.

It was between the period following his resignation, and
pefore his first contract with the Station, that the cos
told Hunkeler that he wasin a "cooling off period" during
which time Hunkeler should devote his energies towards the
settlement of his personal affairgand the development of
his own business interests. Hunkeler was also told that
his value to the Station and to KUBARK would be increased
if he were free from all ties with KUBARK and ODYOKE in
order that Hunkeler may be available at a later date for
KUBARK assignments, The COS did not, however, make any

commitments to Hunkelere

Developments:
2. During the months which followed Hunkelers resignation

he proceeded to attend to his personal affairs in Lakeland,
Plorida, and established his company, Identity A, in the

WAVE area.

gent


3. After a number of months had lapsed, Hunkeler \
was contacted by the Station COS and was recruited under |
a@ contract in the amount of $500.00 a month plus operational
expenses. Hunkeler expressed a willingness to undertake
any assignment and a desire to actively participate in
operations. (His initial target was largely limited to \
the monitoring of the activities and the personalities of
the foreign consular corp in the WAVE area and reporting

on matters of operational interest as they came to Hunkelers 2
attention.) \

: |
4e Shortly after Hunkeler was placed under contract’

he submitted a paper to the Station which spelled out a
number of specific tasks which he could, under the cover iH

of hie company if required, undertake for the Station
or KUBARK, (Sheee—escignments—ere—otili_compsable with. -
-his_present—eover_and—background,) There follows a list

of these tasks;
(a) Sale of KURIOT doctored parts and supplies

to the government of PBRUMEN through middlemen
and in a manner as to not disclose Hunkelers
involvement.

(b) Providing non-official cover facilities

to persons being assigned overseas and who require

a tight, realistic and flexible cover,


-3-

(ce) Recruitment pitches, courier work, or

related assignients anywhere in Latin America.

(a4) Monitoring of diplomatic and commercial

activities in the WAVE area. :

(e) Reporting on targets of operational

interest, both in the WAVE area and in those

countries here Eunkeler visits.

(f£) Spotting and assessment of specific operational
7

targets in the PBPRIME and in Latin America.

Review of Accomplishments:

Se Whereas Hunkeler remained ready and willing to

travel anyvhere at anytime for any KUBARK assignment, he

was advised that his long range value would be jeopardized

if he were to take operational assignments involving any
degree of risk. Hunkeler was, in his opinion, "kept in a
vacuum" as regards his being able to serve ficld Stations
which have not to this date been made aware of his availability
to travel except in those cases when his business travel takes

to a country and the field Station is advised of his presence

in the area.

6. From the outset Hunkeler began to report on develop-
ments in the WAVE area and he bagan to work in organizations

which would permit him to penetrate the diplomatic community


and strengthen his operational capabilities in terms of
being able to spot and aggess Latin American political :
leaders. Hunkeler got him-self appointed to a policy
making position in the Identity B, he was elected to
the position of President of Identity C, appointed to
the Board of Directors of Identity D, was elected to
the position of President of Identity E, and became a
delegate to several conferences (Panama, Jamaica and

in PBPRIME) of the Identity F.

1. It was largely as a result of Hunkelers Latin
American oriented commercial activities and his organizational
activities that he was able to provide timely and valuable
reports on the Dominican crisis, estatlish a personal
relationship with Identity G and persons close to him,

spot and access several Panamanian targets, and report

on the activities and recommendations of Identity H, an
organization which provides commercial policy to the President
of Panama.(See ss *d):SsHunkeler kept the Station

up to date on the personalities and activities of the Consular
Corp in the WAVE area, and has furnished assessments and

biographic information on 12 members of this group.


-5-

Other accomplishments include the followings

(a) Operational senorting: During the last two
years Hunkeler has traveled to and submitted
operational and/or intel reports about Mexico,

the Dominican Republic, Haiti, Jamaica, Venezuela,
Panama and Costa Rica, in addition to reports
originating in the WAVE area.

(b)  Egtablishnent of Cover Pacilities: In 1966
Hunkeler set up and maintained cover facilities
for an agent who was initially trained in Hunkelers
companies and subsequently assigned to a European :
post where he remained until a person¥21 reduction

cut caused his termination, The cover aspects of G
this cover operation, however, were tight and

professionally mmaged by Hunkeler. Other cover

facilities developed by Hunkeler in this period

included a cover office facility in Haiti, Venezuela

and the Dominican Republic.

(c) Other: In late 1966 Hunkeler met with an Officer

assigned to the WAVE Station for the purpose of
reviewing the operational potentials of the “aribbeane
Hunkeler was able to provide the Officer with the
names and introductions to persons well known to
Hunkeler who are now in the Caribbean or residing

in Miani and available to participate in gent, p.a.,

or informant capacities.


Present Situation:
9 In early February, 1966, Hunkeler met with a Sase

Officer of the Yracas Station who reviewed Hunkelers existing
business activities in Venezuela and who told Hunkeler that
the Caracas Station desired to use a Hunkeler company for
non-official cover purposes in Venezuela. The success

of Hunkelers commercial activities in the Dominican Republic
(and the corresponding move by Hunkeler to open an office

in Santo Domingo) is a recent development and there has not
yet been time to query Station Santo Domingo as to whether or
not they have a requirement to use Hunkelers facilitiess
(Hunkeler is presently phasing out of much organizational
work in the WAVE area in order to devote more time to the
chore of setting up his operations in Santo Domingo and

Venezuela where both of his companies are currently doing

business.)

106 There are several aspects of Hunkelers present business
activities which have not yet been finalized: He Wilt soon
terminate his lease at his present address and has not yet
decided where to re-locate !:is offres; he is still in
negotiations with an investment group in Haiti and may
undertake a consultant type survey there which would provide

access to Haiti of possible interest to that Station.


Future Potentials:

We When iunkelers contract was about to expire in
Pebruary, 1966, he met with a Station Officer and advised
that he was fully in accord with a salary cut from $500.00
to $300.00 a month in keeping with budgetary cuts which
were evident at that tine. Moreover, Hunkeler volunterily
ceased requesting reinbursement for operational expenses
choosing to use his KUBARK income for entertainnent expenses
which oftines have operational value to KUBARK. Although he
has expressed his strong desire to continue his KUBARK
relationship under a renewal of his present contract for
$300.00 a month, he has advised that he does not care to

renew his contract for a figure of less -than £300.00 a month.
