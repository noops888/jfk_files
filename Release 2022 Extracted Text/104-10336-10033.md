OGC searches under JFK Act

Per your request, OGC has conducted searches for documents regarding Lawrence Houston and Scott

Breckinridge for the time period 1959-64.

There are no OGC files on either individual. However, documents were located on each individual as

described below.

With respect to Scott Breckinridge, compute searches of OGC record systems were conducted and

approximately 100 documents were located, dating from 1977 to 1996. I have reviewed the computer

summaries of all these documents, only 5 mention HSCA or President Kennedy which | will make available

to you. The remainder deal with prepublication review of manuscripts written by Breckinridge. One

document deals with a unrelated FOIA request by another individual which mentions Breckinridge's name.

I will retain these summaries should you wish to review them yourself.

With regard's to Lawrence Houston, during the relevant time period, OGC published a volume entitled

"Opinions of the Office of General Counsel, Central Intelligence Agency". Each volume contains all the

opinions from all the attorneys in the office during a particular year. I am currently in the processing of

reviewing the volumes for 1959-64. Please advise as to how you want to handle the appropriate review of

these volumes.

CIA-IR-34 Files of CIA Officials and /or Offices

The Review Board requested that the CIA locate and provide the files of various CIA

offices and officials. In response, the CIA provided indexes to extant files and complete

access to the fles chosen for review by the Review Board staff.

files of the Office of the Deputy Director of Central Intelligence (DDCI), 1959-

1964

General Charles Cabell, 1953-1962

General Marshall Carter, 1962-1965

The Review Board staff examined six large boxes of material from the Office of the

DDCI and the chronological files of Cabell and Carter. These materials included

intelligence community reporting, material on the Bay of Pigs, various general subject

files, personal chronological files, and the minutes of the Director of Central

Intelligence's (DCI) daily morning meeting. Much of the material duplicated material

found in the files of DCI John McCone or in the file of the Deputy Director of Plans. A

small number of documents were designated assassination records.

.

files of the Office of the Deputy Director for Plans (DDP), 1959-1964

Richard Bissell, 1958-1962

Richard Helms, 1962-1965

The Directorate of Operations (DO), (formerly the Directorate of Plans or DP) provided

a massive index of over 2600 pages to the Review Board staff. This index, which took

several days to review, covered the archived files of the Office of the DP/DO, including

the extant records of Bissell and Helms, from the late 1940's until the mid-1980's. Over

150 files, covering a broad time period and a wide variety of issues, were selected for

review from this index. The Review Board staff was given full access to the files

provided by CIA. These files were examined and documents were designated as

assassination records for inclusion in the JFK Collection. Of the files selected, only four

could not be located for examination by the Review Board staff. One of these missing

files had been removed by the Historical Review Program to be reviewed for materials

relevant to the assassination, two of the files had been noted as missing by the History

Staff, and one had been signed out by a CIA employee over a decade ago and not

returned. The DO also provided two very small indexes to files which could be

identified particularly as belonging to Bissell and Helms. No files were selected from

these indexes. CIA reported that it generally maintains the files held by senior officials

within the files of the office held by that individual. Below the level of the DCI, only

rarely can records be ascribed to a particular individual holder of an office.

•• the chronological files of C. Tracy Barnes, 1959-1964

The DO provided a small index of files which could be identified as belonging to

Barnes. No files were selected for review and no assassination records were designated

by the Review Board staff.

files of the Office of the General Counsel, 1959-1964

Lawrence Houston, 1959-1964

The Office of the General Counsel (OGC) identified numerous documents from the

Opinions of the General Counsel for 1959-1964 which consist of legal opinions,

memorandums for the record complied from the OGC chronological file. These records

were examined by the Review Board staff but no documents were designated as

assassination records. CIA reported that no working files which could be identified as

specifically belonging to Houston could be identified. His records were incorporated

into the files of the OGC. The OGC also provided eight microfiche of correspondence

on the OGC and the Warren Commission, The documents concern the Warren

Commission Report and the declassification of documents on the assassination for the

Warren Commission and Freedom of Information Act requests. All of these documents

were designated as assassination records.

operational diaries of William Harvey

The CIA was unable to locate any operational or working diaries or any records which

could be identified as belonging to William Harvey. The Review Board staff also

consulted with CIA historians and reviewers who had worked on materials relating to

the Bay of Pigs. No operational or working diaries had been located in the Bay of Pigs

materials.
