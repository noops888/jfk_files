that Mr. Hunt was referred to his office for placement

assistance through the Office of the Executive Director,

then Colonel L. K. White. Mr. O'Malley stated that in

net MI. Hunt some years previously in Paris, trance.

shown in Mr. Hunt's post-employment placement,

the company•

Mr. O'Malley recalled referring various

Agency officers to Mr. Hunt for guidance when these indi-

viduals expressed an interest in entering the public

relations field.

Mr. O'Malley did recall disappointent

in feeling Mr. Hunt had generally been less helpful on

these occasions.

requesting referral of retiring Agency employees with

specific qualifications.

ly after Mr. Hunt had assumed his responsibilities with

the White House.

In one instance Mr. Hunt requested re-

ferral of a recently retired Agency secretary.. As in

previous memoranda and discussions, Mr. O'Malley was unable

to recall the name of this individual.

state that he is quite certain Mr. Hunt turned down the

individual whom he referred. As a point of clarification,

Mr. O'Malley said that this individual had not previously

been known to Mr. Hunt, nor had she previously worked

for him in any capacity.

Mr. O'Malley also recalled a

request from Mr. Hunt for an individual having skills in

the area of locks and

•O'Malley recalled that Mr. Hunt expressed dissatisfaction

with that suggestion in part because of what Mr. Hunt

viewed as that firm's political orientation.

Nt. O'Malley

did not elaborate further on that remari..

Nr. O'Malley

securIty.

Mr. O'Malley stated that insofar as this

organization was advertised in the yellow pages and that

Mr. Hunt could be assured of the reliability of the ser-

vices, he felt this to be a reasonable suggestion. Mr.

O'Nalley stated that during a subsequent phone

call when

Mr. O'Malley asked how his suggestion had worked out,

MT. hunt responded

"Yes, they had done a fine job."

At this point Mr. O'Malley was asked whether or not fron

his associations with Mr. Hunt he felt Mr. Hunt was in

the habit of making glib comments which were not neces-

sarily accurate in order to pass over a subject. Mr:

O'Malley stated

that this was categorically so.

He said

he was sure that Mr. Hunt had lied to him on a number of

occasions and that, therefore, he was in no position to

• be sure that Mr. Hunt had actually, in fact, used the

services of Anderson Security Consultants.

Mr. O'Malley

volunteered the opinion that he suspected

the electronic

countermeasures "sweep" was to be carried out in the offices

of the Committee to Re-elect the President..

f. In response to a question as to whether he had

ever referred anyone to McCord Associates, fir: O'Malley

replied that he remembered having referred Walter Brayden.

Nir. Brayden for a time acted as bodyguard to Mrs. Martha

As an aside Mr. O'Malley mentioned that Mr.

Brayden had refused to carry a firearm in spite of the

fact that Mr. McCord told him he could do. so on the author-

ity of the Attorney General. Asked specifically if he had

ever referred either William Shea or Teresa Shea to Mr.

McCord, Mr. O'Malley stated that he did not recall specif-

ically referring Teresa Shea and that he was sure that he

had not referred William Shea to him..

So, contrary to

previous statements, it is now Mr. O'Malley's belief that

in all probability Mrs. Shea was not referred by this

Agency to Mr. McCord.
