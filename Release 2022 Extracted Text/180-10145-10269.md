15. 11/17/60. cate to Director from MASH

On 11/15/60,[Periet#] alins Bender met with Rey in complete privacy.
"Unquestionably, thé youtlful, softspoken, unassuming, almost humic Ray!

is a natural leader of highest intellect, deepest sincerity and convistion."
Ray's political posture doubtful as far as U.S. government acceptance is
concerned.

Explained to Ray the U.S. goverment's desire to have all Cuban exiles
unified in their efforts. Ray says MRP does not wish to reinstate 150
constitution. Provisional government of 30 honorable Cubans would be
established and elections held 18 months thereafter. Castro lavs passed
at beginning of his regime to be promilgated. State would regulate
privete investment end utilities would be nationalized.

Ray wants to keep MRP "lean and hungry" -- each member to have specific
responsibilities and feel important to revolution.

Ray asked for permission to start a fund drive in Cuba and U.S. Also
asked for $10,000 by next Wednesday -- Bender made commitment.

Debdetetoetteves net result of meeting wes establishment of private MRP-
U.S. link end door remains open for some kind of relationship with FRD.
Ray agrees to discuss this with Miro Cardona, Of ell the groups being
supported, FRD, MRP and MRR are most significant. All Cuban groups seem
to be looking to Bender group to show a preference before joining one of
‘the above three. How long current flexibility can be mainteined is
problematical.

to the fact that Ray opposed the idea of shooting Hubert Matos as a

traitor. Ray resigned his post but said publicly that he approved and
supported the Castro regime without any mental reservations. Says in
Cuban clandestine circles Ray is regarded as boastful, ostentatious and:
deceitful. Intimate friends of Ray feel that he is a man of anti-democratic
Procedures, and does not like to take advice, even from members of his own
movement.

Synopsis of paragraph 12. Dr. Alvarez said Ray was in favor of maintaining es
relations with USSR and not making Communist Party illegal. Said that

although Ray withdrew all these statements when threatened with press

coverage, Alvarez thinks they are representative of Ray's thinking and

also mentioned Rays thinking on nationalization of public services,

socialized medicine, nationalization of banks, etc.

Synopsis of paragraph 13. Dr. Beruf? said Ray well-intentioned with no
Communist tendencies. Cited 2 meeting at which the basic points of the

MRP platform were discussed and said that since Ray was in disagreement with
the others on most of the points, Dr. Felipe Pazos acted as chairman of the

meeting came a declaration of 14 points, including the nationalization of
the banks and public utilities.

On 9 March, Ray said that ideas attributed to him in Paragraph 12 were not

frue and part of a "campaign egainst him by Mr. Pawley of the Miami City

Signed: Calvin Hicks ¥/k/PM/operations

“Ray is balieved to have accomplished pratically nothing towards the effort
to overthow Castro. Instead, it seems that whenever we played with his so-
called assets, we were burned. He is notorious for claiming assets or
operations, several days after some other group had already set them up or
claimed them. Whenever it came to producing and backing up his claims, he
always came up with excuses for not producing, rather than results. He has
always tended to try to take over other goups, rather than cooperate with
them, and when he couldn't take them over he would "politic" against them.
His actions all seemed to be directed toward making him the future power
in Cuba rather than toward overthrowing Castro. It is believed that Manolo
RAY is so far "left" in his thinking thet he would be as dangerous (or more
so in the long run) to United States interests as Castro, if he ever got to
be the power in Cuba.”

a 25-foot boat outfitted in Miami area to be operational vy about Sept. 10.

not pose as many difficulties as present Mexican and Spanish air travel
conditions.

Ray says he hoped to soon penetrate the Cuban delegation to the U.N.

Rodriguez questioned Ray's using newspaper correspondents as emissaries to
departments of the U.S. govt. Ray stated that Szule took it upon himself
to speak about matters related to assisting Ray. Fodriguez says it would
be wrong to assume that Ray is controlled by Szulc but Ray "undoubtedly
knows that Szulc has worked hard, first with President Kennedy and now, for
him and his interest. This cannot but influence Ray."

Origin of Autonomous Operations
Integrated Covert Action Program for Cuba, approved by itigher authority
in June 1963, provided for "support of autonomous anti-Castro Cuban groups
fo supplement and assist in the execution" of other courses of action
foucept was first voiced in Sept. 1962 in Walter Rostow's proposal for a
“Track Two" approach to Cuban operations. Parallel to regular CIA-
controlled Cuban teams, CIA wold extend financial aid and some aivice and
guidance to independent and uncontrolled Cuban leaders such ag Manuel Ray.

Rules of Engagement incorporated into June 1963 program,

“sasdt is the Keystone of autonomous operations that they will ve
Gxecuted exclusively by Cuban nationals motivated by the conviction that the
Guerthrow of the Castro/Commnist regime must be accomplished by Cubans,
Doth inside and outside Cuba acting in consonance.

2s nine effort will probably cost many Cuban lives. If this cost
in lives becomes unacceptable to the U.S. conscience, autonomous operations
Gan be effectively halted by the withdraval of U.S. support; but ones halted,
they cannot be resumed,

3, All autonomous operations will be mounted outside the territory
of the United States,

4. ‘The United States Government must be prepared to deny publicly
ony Participation in these acts no matter how loud or even how accurete may
be the reports of Ui S, complicity,

5. The United States presence ani direct participation in the
Gperation would be kept to an absolute minimum. Before entering into ox
cpezational relationship with a group, the U.S. representative will make it
clear that his Goverment has no intention of intervening militarily, except
to counter intervention by the Soviets. An experienced CIA officer would be
assigned to work with the group in a liaison capacity. He would provide
General advice as requested as well as funds and necessary material support,
He may be expected to influence but not control the comiuet of operations.

6. These operations would not ve undertaken within a Pixel tie
schedule,"

Cisneros thinks Raul Chibas will soon also resign. Cisneros said Ray not
Prepared for ill-fated May attempt into Cuba and Cisneros thinks Ray nad
believed he could arrange for CIA to take him into Cuba. "Ray is politically
unformed --- politically that which he last read", Cisneros further stated
that he believed Ray had planned his entire return-to-Cuba angle vith President
Kennedy and the presidential elections of November 1964 in mind. According to
him, Ray planned to make JURE and Ray outstanding liberal and denocractic
exile group with the thought that prior to the 1964 elections, Mr. Kennedy
would have to do something about Cuba, With Kennedy's death, according to
Cisneros, all of Ray's plans went awry. Rodriguez expresses to Cisneros

that this seems like a far-fetched possibility and Cisneros admits he got
idea out of thin air, but said theory widely held within Directorate of SUR,

for good. “If Ray is succesful in Cuba he will not need our help, if he is
not, our help won't do much good.

"He is honest and at least the money will largely be spent for the
purpose he wants to achief . °

The President was visibly shaken to learn that US government was not in-

President Orlich made clear he would be happy at any time to undertake
action such as this if US government wanted him to, ‘ihile he does wish

avout 25 April and that Arcos still in prison but charges against him
were thin. "( This means there was at least one more telephone call than
we knew of previously, and this has probably served to increase the pressure
on Arcos)." Anderson tells of his concern and strong interest in Arcos on
the chance that Ray might assume Arcos nad ceen CIA agent. Doesn't know
if Ray will construe remark this way but it seemed like an opening "to use
an important exile channel as a possible deception mechanism,”
