no apparent difficulties.

CHIBAS' sources of information:

This should get a good picture of the U.S. anti-Castro activities.

Explained to Ray the U.S. government's desire to have all Cuban exiles

wallied in their efforts.

Ray says MRP does not wish to reinstate 1940

onstitution. Provisional government of 30 honorable Cubans would b

stablished and elections held 18 months thereafter. Castro laws passe

at beginning of his regime to be promulgated. State would regulate

private investment and utilities would be nationalized.

Ray wants to keep MRP "lean and hungry" -- each member to have specific

responsibilities and feel Important to revolution.

Ray asked for permission to start a fund drive in Cuba and U.S. Also

asked for $10,000 by next Wednesday - Bender made commitment.

[arlett believes net result of meeting was establishment of private MIp-

U.S. link and door remains open for some kind of relationship with FRD.

Ray agrees to discuss this with Miro Cardona. Of all the groups being

supported, FRD, MRP and MR are most significant. All Cuban groups seem

to be looking to Bender group to show a preference before joining one of

the above three. How long current flexibility can be maintained 1s

problematical.

Background, Character and Economic Concepts of Manuel Ray Rivero

16 March 1961

Sources:

Not a cover note end comment a ten into ged a minety

to disseminate it.

Synopsis of paragraphs 1-11. Dr. Salas says during his childhood Ray was

a Protestant but today is completely atheistic.

Said Ray organized the MRC

against Batista and shortly after Batista's fall, MRC and 26th of July

lovement fused into one, ans as soon as Castro came into power, control

of the organization was given to the Communists.

Tells of Ray's association

with Castro and that he did not resign his position when his own brother

was renounced by Castro. Stated that Ray's rupture with Fidel was due

to the fact that Ray opposed the idea of shooting Hubert Matos as a

traitor. Ray resigned his post but said publicly that he approved and

supported the Castro regime without any mental reservations.

Says in

Cuban clandestine circles Ray is regarded as boastful, ostentatious and:

deceitful. Intimate friends of Ray feel that he is a man of anti-democratic

procedures, and does not like to take advice, even from members of his owa

movement.

Synopsis of paragraph 12. Dr. Alvarez said Ray was in favor of maintaining

relations with USSR and not making Communist Party 1llegal.

although Ray withdrew all these statements when threatened with press

coverage, Alvarez thinks they are representative of Ray's thinking and

would try to put ideas into practive 1l he ever came to power. Alverez

also mentioned Rays thinking on nationalization of public services,

socialized medicine, nationalization of banks, etc.

Synopsis of paragraph 13. DI. Beruff said Ray well-intentioned with no

On 9 March, Ray said that ideas attributed to him in paragraph 12 were not

Ray said relatives

of Gustavo Arcos in P.R. had telephone contact with Arcos family in Cuba,

about 25 April and that Arcos still in prison but charges against him

"(This means there was at least one more telephone call than

on Arcos)."'

Anderson tells of his concern ard strong interest in Arcos on

the chance that Fay might assume Arcos had been CIA agent. Doesn't know

if Pay will construe remark this way but it seemed like an opening "to use

an important exile channel as a possible deception mechanism."
