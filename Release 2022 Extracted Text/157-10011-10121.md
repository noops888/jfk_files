@ : EVENTS LEADING TO RECRUITMENT

Charles W, Wiley first came to the official atten-
tion of the Office of Security (0S) on 9 September 1955,
when Carl F. Heney (Executive Officer, OS) forwarded a
letter written by Wiley to Ermal Geiss (Chief, Personnel
Security Division, 0S), who in turn directed the letter
to James W. McCord [Security Research Staff of the Office
of Security (SRS)]. How Heney obtained the Wiley letter
is unknown, inasmuch as the name of the addressee was
deleted in the letter. However, the letter was recorded
in the Executive Registry under number 6-9881. The Wiley
letter is dated 27 April 1955, gives Wiley's address and
telephone number, and Wiley advised that he was working
on an index of the Daily Worker for the years 1933-1945
“and thought that perhaps you might be interested in
specific information that I am likely to find."

On 10° September 1955, James W. McCord contacted Wiley
in Flushing, New York. At that time Wiley explained the
nature or rne index of the Daily Worker for the eae
1945, by stating that he was prepa ing the index under a
grant from the American Legion Americanism Committee,
headed ty Lee Pennington (a former employee of the FBI).
Wiley started the index in November 1954, Wiley stated
he contacted the major government agencies in Washington
to ascertain what information in the Daily Worker would

“be of most interest to them, and in addition, contacted

a couple of Congressional Committees which McCord surmised
were the House Committee on Un-American Activities and the
Senate Internal Security Committee. Wiley estimated it
would take two and a half years to complete the index At
that time, Wiley was receiving part-time clerical assis-
tance from the Women's Auxiliary of the American Legion
Post in Flushing, New York. Wiley also indicated an in-
terest in Agency employment after finishing the index.

The results of McCord's interview with Wiley were
brought to the attention of Robert Bannerman, Deputy Direc-
tor of Security, by 21 November 1955, when Bannerman opined
that "this may be valuable."

McCord met next with Wiley in Washington, D. C., for
two days, ending on 1 December 1955. By that time, Wiley
had indexed 150,000 names of the Daily Worker covering
January 1954 through June 1936, Wiley stated that the
FBI in New York City and the American Legion were already
making "extensive use" of the index cards. Wiley stated
that one of his purposes being in Washington was to secure
financing for the index cor nuation. He stated that his
$5000 a year grant from the American Legion Americanism
Committee would expire at the end of December 1955, and
if negotiations with that body were unsuccessful, he would
attempt to secure financing from the Senate and House Inves-
tigating Committees. Wiley stated that the FBI has indi-
cated the strongest desire that he continue the indexing
but that in his discussion with Mr. DeLoach (Cartha DeLoach,
an FBI senior official), no indication of forthcoming finan-
cial support from the Bureau for this work was indicated.

In recording this contact with Wiley, McCord opined:

“YT think it is obvious that the index
which Wiley is working on ould be of con-
_ siderable value io the ty Ottice and
@ to CIA, particularly since the Communist
Party membership and activities during the
1934-40 period were for the most part very
open and extensively advertised in the Daily
Worker. An example of how open their activi-
ties were is indicated in the fact that
Elizabeth Bentley's name was. mentioned in
a 1935 issue of the Daily Worker at a time
rior to her going underground and acquiring
a RIS (Russian Intelligence Service) mission.
Jf the Daily Worker thus bears a record of
(Communist) Party activities of an indi-
vidual such as Bentley, who later became
so prominent in RIS activities in the
United States, then the possibility always
exists that the names of persons later con-
nected with OSS (Office of Strategic Services)
and other governmental activity may also be
mentioned in the 1934-40 Daily Worker issues,
which have heretofcre never been indexed by
any government agency.

: "Because of the obvious value of

: having access to such an index, the writer
(McCord) recommends that we encourage the |
continuation of Wiley's index project in :
any way in which we are able to further
such work,"

(There is no objective evidence in the file other than
the above to support Wiley's contention that he was given
encouragement by Mr. DeLoach of the FBI to continue the pro-
ject.)

The above was brought to the attention of Harlan
Westrell (Chief, Counterintelligence Branch, SRS), who
in turn brought the matter to the attention of Colonel
Sheffield Edwards, Director of Security, circa early
December 1955.

Via a memorandum dated 19 December 1955, McCord
informed Westrell of the receipt of additional correspon-
dence from Wiley, and McCord included a rehash of the
metter including statements:

can encourage the continuation of the
project, at least until the index is
completed up through 1940, which would
take about another year of work by Wiley.
The index has considerable potential CE
(counter espionage) value to this Office,
for one thing, by virtue of the fact that
there will be numerous heretofore unidenti-
fied Communists' names turn up in the
index, some of whom went underground
during the World War Il years. The

index may give us the one clue neces~
sary to detect any such penetration
existing within this Agency. The value
in protecting the Agency thereby is of
course inestimable. The continuation

of the project would have other merits,
which we have discussed previously."

@ "TI hope the Office of Security

McCord also recommended that, should the project fail,

: the -Agemcy consider employing Wiley.

McCord recommended tha ley had a personal acquain-
tance with a number of the well-known ex-Communist Party
key functionaries, such as Louis Budenz, as well as a
personal acquaintance with tt eads and research people
in all of the Federal Congressional Committees, and State
Investigating Committees in New York State.

McCord was next in contact with Wiley on 27 December
1955, receiving an account of pertinent points retrieved
by Wiley from the indexing project. In addition, Wiley
stated he had discussed the indexing project with Herbert
Philbrick (an ex-FBI penetration of the CPUSA), who had a
continuing interest in the project and had indicated he
would be wiliing to help Wiley get a job in the newspaper
field should the project be terminated. Wiley also com-
mented that he had had lengthy political discussions with
Karl Wittfogel (one-time Communist) in recent years, and
was in contact with Wittfogel a few weeks vefore.

Speculation on identity of Private Individual

When McCord's 27 December contact with Wiley was
brought to the attention of Bannerman, he directed Westrell
to "Explore with Jim Angleton (CI Staff) the possil lity cf
getting about two months' expenses for subject (Wiley) and
in the meantime we can complete our clearance of him and

try to make out a project. We should also make a survey

of his work to be certain a project is justified." Westrell,
in turn, directed McCord to talk to Birch O'Neal (CI Staff)
about the matter.

In the interim, on 21 December 1955, Wiley completed
a Personal History Stat t (and a report of medical his-
tory) reflecting he had en employed since November 1954

. on a grant from the American Legion, 1608 K. Street, NwW.,
‘ Washington, D. C., under the supervision of Lee Pennington.
As a result, McCord scheduled National Agency Checks in

the name of Wiley on 9 January 1956. 5

On 17 January 1956, McCord informed Westrell, receiving
his OX, that Wiley intended to place an article in the
monthly newsletter, "Political Research" published by an
organization affiliated with the NTS (anti-Soviet Russian
emigree organization). The article was to announce Wiley's
indexing project and solicit funds.

On 27 January 1956, McCord informed Westrell, Paul F.

Gaynor (Chief, SRS), Bannerman and Colonel Edwards of the
results of a meeting he had that day discussing Wiley'’s
indexing project with Birch O'Neal and Herman Horton (CI
Staff}. In essence, it was agreed that some Agency funding
of the project should be forthcoming, and Horton evidenced
interest in Wiley for CI Staff employment after completion
of the project. Both Bannerman and Colonel Edwards evi-

: denced interest in Agency funding of the project, the latter

o asking for figures as to cost.

= ~ McCord was next in direct contact with Wiley in flushing,
New York, on 29 January 1956, obtaining highlights of security
interest developed from the indexing.

By 6 February 1956, figures were produced showing that
$13,500 would cover one year continuation of the indexing,
$7,000 for Wiley, $3,000 for a clerk typist; and $3,000 for
part-time help and supplies. On this date, Gaynor noted he
‘would like to see this project completed if at all possible."

By the first week of March 1956, "front office" verbal
approval had been given for OS funding of the project, labeled
Operation Recall, concurrent with a meeting between McCord
and Wiley and arrangements were made for transporting the
completed portion of the index to Washington, D. C. McCord
estimated the value of the index at that time as being be-
tween $15,000 to $25,000 in labor alone. During this week,
favorable National Agency Name Checks were concluded on Wiley
and Colonel Edwards and Colonel White had approved using
Security Office funds to total $10,000 in all, to continue
Wiley's indexing for one additional year. The partially
completed index was turned over to the Agency on 8 March 1956.

chasing the end product of his work and that he was not
now a CIA employee. However, McCord did advise Wiley that
he would attempt to secure Agency employment for him at the
conclusion of the project; and that in the coming year Wiley
should work on the indexing, continue regular contact with
his sources of information in New York City - keeping the
Agency advised of anything that may be pertinent to our
areas of interest, and finally, build a cover story which
would enable Wiley to contact and interview various ex-
Communists and ex-Soviet agents in the New York area.

SECURITY PROCESSING

On 9 January 1956, James McCord of SRS requested
National Agency Checks (NACs), excluding CIC, to be made
on Wiley. These checks were returned on 24 February 1956
and all were either favorable or no record. NACs were
again requested on 50 September 1958 and were returned
either favorable or no record on 30 October 1958. On
24 November 1958, a Covert Security Approval was issued
to the Security Research Staff to permit Wiley's use as
a covert associate of the Security Research States

March 1956 ~ June 1959 }

In mid-March 1956, through a letter by McCord extended
from his home address, arrangements were made for Wiley to
come to Washington, D. C., for three days to.brief Hazel
Mackie, Personnel Pool (Office of Personnel), on certain
administrative matters for the processing and typing of the
index. The Personnel Pool work would result in 8 full copies
of the index: three copies to the Security Office, one copy
to Staff D, one copy to CI Staff, one copy for the FBI, one
copy for the American Legion and one copy for Wiley.

(It is presumed that a copy of the index was given to
the FBI; however, there is no document which could be located
that states a copy was in fact given to the FBI.)

Concurrent with McCord's interest in Wiley, he and
Morse Allen (SRS) were warkina an Ananasia. na?

a (i recengant to tnis operation, by April 1956, Wiley
at the request of McCord had completed:

ject on 9 April 1956. By 22 May 1956, he had met Morse
Allen.

McCord further reported on 1 May 1956 that during dis-
cussion with Wiley he told Wiley that there are three areas
in which he could work during the coming year (1956-57)
which would be of interest and would enhance his value to
CIA. One would be the continuation of the index project,
another would be the continuation of regular contact witn
his sources of information in New York City, keeping CIA
advised of anything that may be pertinent to our areas of
interest. The third would be the building for him a cover
story which would enable him to contact and interv various
ex-Comunists and ex-Soviet agents in the New York area.

Wiley told McCord that he, Wiley, was in contact with
Herbert Philbrick during the spring of 1956, and asked

On 20 March 1957, McCord informed his supervisor that
@ Wiley's work on the index project would expire in May 1957,
S McCord indicated he would like te use Wiley for another year
on the indexing project.

On 13 April 1957, Wiley tendered additional materials
from the indexing project; a copy of an article by Alfred
Kohlberg, "A Red Dream"; an open letter to the President
of the United States requesting either a new trial or par-
don for Morton Sobell, attaching a list of 200 signers; and
a list of publications and organizations fighting Communism
in the U.S. prepared by Herb Philbrick, given to Wiley.
Wiley was advised that he may be called upon soon to work
on some material on Soviet Espionage (David Dallin material,
a noted author of books on Soviet Intelligence), requiring
about one month's work; that he may be called upon to fol-
low the Albam (Jacob Alban) trial developments in the press;
and that an attempt would be made to renew his grant for
another year.

_ On 21 June 1957, Harlan A. Westrell, Chie£,| SRS, re-
quested the Director of Security for authorization to con-
tinue the Daily Worker indexing project for one year which
had yielded approximately 590,000 names in the index. On
22 August 1957, Sheffield Edwards, Director of Security,
requested and received, such authorization for circa
$10,000 from the Deputy Director of Support.

During this period (1956-1959), Wiley worked with
Herbert Philbrick on a book which Philbrick was preparing
entitled "The Most Dangerous Group in the World." Iie also

From 5 to 19 January 1959, Wiley made a fact-finding
trip through the Mid-West and the Southeastern states of
the U.S. contacting newspapers, "conservative" individuals,
police agencies, and information repositories to determine
the extent of their information concerning Communism and
the Communist movement.

@ : CONTRACTUAL RELATIONSHIP - July 1959

On 1 July 1959, this Agency entered into contract
with Wiley, as an independent contractor, at the salary
rate of $9,100 per annum, with additional compensation
in the amount of 5% of the above sum, to be paid in
quarterly installments, representing the Government's
contribution toward Wiley's choice of programs for insur-
ance, retirement, medical and health. The contract speci-
fied that he would be reimbursed for operational travel
as directed by OS, and for other approved operational
expenses, subject to accounting applicable with Govern-
ment regulations.

The annual compensation was subsequently increased
on 1 July 1960 to $9,900 per annum and on 1 July 1961 to
$10,500 per annum, plus additional 5% as noted above.
Salary has remained at the latter level to the date of
his termination. The contract was to run for an inde-
finite neriod, and could be terminated without notice in
ract cr by Wiley rennering

himself unavailable for acceptable service, and could

@ otherwise be terminated by either Wiley or the Agency
with 90 days' notice.

From 1955 to 1959; Wiley was paid in cash, and for
several years after the contract was signed, officers of
SRS continued to pay Wiley his salary either in cash or
through bank money orders. In 1964 payments of salary
were made by the Office of Finance directly into his bank
account in New York City.

From 1959 to the present time, SRS obtained a copy
of each year's Federal Income Tax Return, and on at least
two occasions, Wiley was given a personal briefing on the
management of the Agency funds, vis-a-vis income from his
self-established firm, Worid News Analysis, by Agency
Finance Officers. In 1964, because of his failure to
comply with the SRS's instructions to furnish complete
details on his claimed expenses, the regular payment of
"operational" expenses was terminated, necessitating that
he reduce expenses which were not reimburseable from the
firm's income.

On 18 May 1959, Morse Allen wrote a memo to’ the
Chief, SRS that Wiley is now 2 newspaperman and a maga-
zine writer, accredited under the auspices of the North
American Newspaper Alliance, the Spades Syndicate, The
Indianapolis Star, The Richmond Times Dispatch and pro-
Dably several other publications.” Wiley iS a ember of
an anti-Communist group privately sponsored who will attend
the Vienna Youth Festival and will make themselves known
during the Festival. Niley will probably cover the Festi-
val for the Newhouse Newspaper Chain, National Review and
U.S. News and World Report. He has received 5500 in pri-
vate subscriptions to cover the cost of his transportation
to the WYF. The cost of his proposed itinerary amounts to
$1,056.70 for transportation. Allen recommended the Office
of Security pay the additional cost of $556.70 with the
understanding that any remuneration received from his
writings be offset on an equitable basis.

On 19 May 1959, James McCord noted to Allen, "Ok, see

The New York Times reported on 3 August 1959 that
Charles Wiley, his wife, and Joanne Mellor, a British sub-
ject living in New York City, weve "roughed up" when they
attempted to join a parade of Eastern Bloc delegates to
the WYF. Wiley and company waited until the parade had
started and then unfolded their banners with such slogans
as "Remember Hungary," "Remember Tibet," and "What About
Soviet Imperialism?" That incident got much press cover-
age, particularly because Wiley's wife was obviously preg-
nant.

A 14 September 1959 memo for the record from Wiley
reflects that in a meeting with staff members of the HCUA,
Wiley was instrumental in talking HCUA out of holding
hearings which would be intended partially to expose the

@ : In February 1960, Wiley did testify before HCUA as
. "an expert regarding the 7th WYF and covered "violence"
against himself and other anti-Communists and the Commu-
nist dominance of delegations,

- On or about 1 April 1960, the House Committee on
Un-American Activities was interested in consultations
with Wiley based on articles by Wiley appearing in the
Anerican Legion Magazine, Elks Magazine, National Review,
and the Ukranian Juarterly, apparently based on Wiley's
observations of Iron Curtain countries derived from his
travels to the USSR, the World Youth Festival in Vienna,
and other Iron Curtain countries during the summer of
LO Oe (abTy February 1960, Wiley had testified before
HCUA about his experiences at the Vienna Youth Festival.)
The HCUA staff members interested in Wiley were Francis
McNamara and Richard Arens.

During the course of his trip to the WYF, Wiley
apparently drew some official attention to himself in
Israel.

was forwarded to McCord regarding conversations Willian
Anthony, Press Officer, American Embassy, Tel Aviv, Israel,

himself as a columnist connected with the "Newhouse Chain"
but in his questioning of Anthony about Israeli politics,
he (Wiley) "tries to give the impression he either is in
or just outside the Washington intelligence community."
Upon receipt of this memo, McCord advised Morse Allen,
SRS, "We need to straighten Wiley out on being too clan-
destine."”

@ . CUBA TRIP, ARREST AND DETENTION, 1960 H

(There is no conclusive evidence such as formal memo-
randa in the file to indicate that this Agency initiated
action to send Wiley to Cuba, However, inferences from
routing slips, memoranda and expense voucher Payments would
indicate that this trip was for CIA, Contrary to inferences
by SRS officers, there is-no indication, again such as a
formal memorandum, in the Wiley files that he, under CIA
instruction, courted arrest and detention so that he could
find out information about the three staff employees tho
were imprisoned there, This does not Preclude that there
might not be written notes of such a plan buried in other
files. The best indicator is Paul Gaynor's comment on a
routing slip to CIA Cover Employee dated 2 February 1970,
"His (Wiley's) imprisonment in Cuba Was an operation on
behalf of FE-TSD-OS-DCI-DDP.1)

On 9 August 1960, Wiley reported the following infor-
mation to Morse Allen of SRS concerning his tcip to Cuba:

doing nothing but moving about the Libre Hotel. Wiley
Stated further that during the 26th and on the 27th he
had been interviewing delegates to the Latin American
Youth Congress then convening in Havana, Cuba. During
these interviews, Wiley had acted as a typical newspaper-

@ : Wiley stated that the actual arrest came about in the
* following way. He stated that he had talked with a young

man from the United States. The young Cuban whoiwas obvi-
ously violently pro-Castro and also had talked with a young
man from the United States. The young Cuban had been telling
Wiley that everything was fine in Cuba and that it was not
a police state and he was conducting his discussion with
this young Cuban in more or less routine reported style
when all of a sudden a police officer with two others moved
to the table where he was sitting and stated that they wanted
to talk to Wiley outside. Wiley asked the ranking officer
who he was and was told that he was the Chief of the Public
Relations of the Youth Congress. However, after some argu-
ment , Wiley was forcibly taken outside although not roughed
up by the two assistants to the ranking police officer and
also taken at the same time was the young Cuban whom Wiley
had been interviewing. All these police officers were in
plain clothes.

Wiley stated that they were placed in a car and taken

Havana which is a building between 14th Street and Fifth

ride in the car to the G-2 Headquarters, he needled the
® young Cuban who kept insisting that this was not an arrest
and seemed shocked by the whole performance. Wiley added

that this Cuban, as far as he knows, was dismissed from
the prison after a statement had been taken from him by
the police the same evening.

Wiley stated that he was taken to a reception type of
room in the G-2 Headquarters and to his complete amaze-
ment some fifteen minutes after he was taken there, into
the reception room came Jake Rosen, a well known New York
Communist whom Wiley spoke to and positively identified
and another U.S. Communist whom Wiley identified as being
one of those who was on tour of the Soviet Union with
Wiley after he had gone to the Vienna Youth Festival pre-
viously. Wiley stated that he could not recall the name
of the second Communist but stated he could be identified
since Wiley has a photograph of him at his residence.
Rosen and this other Communist were dirty and their feet

covered with mud and he learned later from one of the
guards in the reception room that both of these men had
come from Sierra Maestre where they had been visiting,

Wiley said he talked to Rosen and there could be no
question of his identity. (NOTE: In discussing the iden-
tity of these individuals with Wiley, it was agreed that a
Possible examination of both cases would be in order since
2 possibility exists that Rosen and the other Communist
were illegally in Cuba.)

Following this short period of time in the reception
yoom, Wiley was placed in a cell in the jail about 9x 15
feet long which contained six bunks and 15 other prisoners,
Niley stated that in this cell he met ENU Acosta, a man
named Costas and Major Gallo Martinez whom Wiley described
as the former Adjutant General of Castro's Army.

Wiley stated that after about one hour in the cell,
the guards came and took hia to another Toom for interro-
gation. On the way to the interrogation room, Wiley stated <
he saw Jake Rosen and the other aforementioned man in ane
OL the diner offices and buth seewed in high spirics.
Wiley commented that he had learned later from other pri-
Sonsers that Rosen and this other individual had complete
run of the Headquarters and were allowed to make phone cz71s
and Wiley stated that he established through other prisoners
that Rosen had made at least three Phone calls; one to the
National Hotel, one Possibly to the United States Embassy
and one to an unknown private number, Wiley also learned
that at one of the three numbers Rosen spoke to someone
for about an hour and apparently this someone was known
as "Mike," Wiley stated that he also learned that the two
Communists were seen with Captain Alvarez of G-2 and were
observed on most friendly terms with Alvarez and were, in
fact, reported as being arm in arm with Alvarez. One pri-
soner believed that they were talking about Wiley since
this prisoner overheard the name "Cholly" (ph), the way
Cubans referred to Wiley's first name Charles.

According to Wiley, the interrogation was conducted

by the Previously mentioned Alvarez and a Cuban woman who
claimed that she had been arrested by the FBI recently in

& . Miami, Florida, and further claimed that she had been
slapped by an FBI agent. Wiley stated that this woman
mentioned the name of the man but he cannot as yet recall
the agent's name. Wiley also believed that the arrest had
occurred in Miami within the last few months, also no speci-
fic date of arrest was mentioned. Wiley stated that Alvarez
and the woman both spoke English although not well.

Wiley stated that the interrogation was strictly rou-
tine. Theprsantad +o othe he : 4 ee nebteas :

tough at times but Wiley laughed at him and denounced the
Cuban police, the Cuban military and the Cuban government
to Alvarez and, in fact, invited Alvarez to do anything
he wanted to. Wiley stated he bluntly asked Alvarez just
why he was arrested and according to Alvarez said "we
think you are an FBI spy."' Wiley stated that he pointed
out the stupidity of Alvarez to his face and that Alvarez
from time to time became furious during the interrogation.

wa

Wiley stated that the interrogation which was com-
pletely fruitless lasted about twenty minutes, at the

@ conclusion of which he was given a sandwich and was told
that he would be released in the morning. Wiley stated
that he demanded that he be allowed to call the U.S. Em-
bassy but this was denied. Because of this, Wiley stated
that he wouldn't eat a thing until the U.S, Embassy. or
one of their representatives had made contact with him.
He stated that he took the sandwich and gave it to some
prisoners. Wiley stated at the conclusion of this interro-
gation he was taken to a different cell which he described
as being about 15 x 15 feet having triple bunks in the cell
occupied by 26 other men whom Wiley described as MRR types.
Wiley described this cell as filthy, no ventilation, no
lights. He stated he spent seven days in this cell and in
fact went on a hunger strike. He stated he refused to eat
anything and touched no food except on the Sunday following
his arrest after he had been promised his release the fol-
lowing morning at which time he had a little soup and some
other food. He added however because his release was not
forthcoming as agreed, he went on another hunger strike and
had no food until he was released on the following Wednes-

from the U.S. Embassy visited hin, Wiley did not know
this man's name and Mr. Kessler from the Embassy who has

Wednesday, Wiley commented that prior to his release he
gave what he regarded as significant information (which

surfaced and he could not tell how long he would be kept
in the prison. Wiley cautioned the writer at this time
the possible compromise of his connections if this infor-
mation was handled incorrectly.

Wiley stated that he suffered no particular harass -
ments while in the prison. He Stated that some of the
guards talked tough and tried to act tough but Wiley stated

scorn and hostility. “He stated that as a form of annoy-

ance he was told twice that he was going to leave and then

@ after he had prepared to leave, he was told that it was a
mistake and that his leaving had been cancelled. :

Wiley stated that on Friday or Saturday in the morning
which had been the 29th or 30th of July he was checked over
by a doctor at the prison for fungus infection and because
of the fact that he was on a hunger strike and that it was
obvious that he was weak from hunger, Wiley said nothing
came of this but on Tuesday the 2nd of August, he was taken
within the prison to a doctor who immediately sent him to
a hospital, address unknown (in Havana), Camp Libertad.

At this hospital Wiley was given a check up and he was told
he would have to eat, Wiley stated that he would resist

any effort to force feed him and he refused to take any

food and any medication from a Cuban doctor or Cuban atten-
dant. Wiley said that at the hospital he was placed in a
psycho cell with about twelve persons some of whom Wiley
thought were political types but most of whom were criminally

insane. Wiley commented that obviously the prison atten-
dants and officials were very worried about Wil s health
because of his refusal to eat and he was constantly being
checked by various doctors. Wiley stated that he was re-
leased from the hospital and was given back all of his
effects except his tape recorder and his hat. On Wednes-
day, 3 August, he was released.

Wiley commented that the individuals who were political
prisoners impressed him very much; they seemed "real men"
and were fanatically anti-Castro; most as far as Wiley could
tell were connected with the MRR. He stated the. regular
guards were obnoxious and were detested by the prisoners.

He commented that the G-2 Headquarters, as far as he could
tell, had been in operation somewhat over two months and
that they had probably processed over 5,000 prisoners
since he recalled seeing the number attached to his card
as 5028.

Wiley commented that while at the hospital a civil
officer, Rolando Fiallo, came to his cell and acted as an
interpreter. Fiallo told Wiley that he wanted to help him
and offered ta da anythi for him that he could, Accard-
ing to Wiiey, Fiailo appeared tu be a Sirong anvi-Casiio
type who had a great desire to come to the United States.
Fiallo told Wiley that he had a good friend who was an
important defector from the Cubai Embassy in Mexico.

Wiley commented that Fiallo sounded very honest) but that
he could not tell whether this man was a plant or not.

Wiley stated that while he was in prison, guards
brought in a man by the name of Leonardo Julio Walter, an
Argentine doctor. Wiley stated that he found out that this
Walter had been picked up at the airport as soon as he had
landed and that when he was placed in the cell with Wiley
and the others, the doctor gave the impression of a per-
fectly furious individual. “According to Wiley,| Dr. Walter
kept insisting that he was a friend of "Che" Gueverra.
Walter was an obnoxious type, according to Wiley, and
stated time and time again emphatically that hel hated all
North Americans and in no circumstances would he treat
them medically. Wiley could not understand why, this man
was brought into the prison but reported it simply as an
incident of interest.

; Set out below are items of particular interest which
‘ have been reported in more Specific terms by Mr. Wiley
to assist Chief, SRS and are set forth below for! record:

Wiley reported that MRR source who was interrogated
said that a man FNU Gorky was a Russian or East German
who sits in on all interrogations of political prisoners
at the G-2 Headquarters Building, According to Wiley,
this man does not speak Spanish and his Source could fur-
nish no description,

According to Wiley, an MRR source told him that he
had received the following information from another MRR
man who worked at the place mentioned. This source re-
ported that there were twenty crated MIG fighter planes
at the San Antonio "bath" Gviley could not recall the
Spanish word used here). This source Stated that this
was an air base built by the U.S. Government. The source
further reported that he had heard that between 30 and 35
Cuban pilots were presently in Czechoslovakia on a seven
months training course getting instructions for flying
the aforementioned MIG fighters.

Wiley stated that he had given full details concerning
the Soviet freighter that had come in with the large crates
@ to Assistant Chief, SRS. Wiley Stated that it was most

interesting that his source told him that the freighter

any routine harbor clearance and had swung immediately into
its berth along side one of the Havana docks. According to
Wiley the source was one of the longshoremen who !had been
impressed to unload this Soviet freighter. The ¢rates un-
loaded were enormous being 70 feet long approximately.
Source also stated that one of the crates had broken but
because of the careful packing of whatever it contained,
source was unable to identify its contents. According to
Wiley, these huge crates were placed on big trucks and were
taken to specific areas, each one accompanied by ‘jeeps.
Wiley himself could offer no explanation of the crates or
what they were made of nor the size or Capacity of the trucks
that moved these large crates, Apparently Wiley's source
could furnish no additional details other than those given
to Assistant Chief, SRS,

Wiley stated that he learned from a former, police-
man who served under Batista that every G-2 station in
Havana had cached 400 Czech machine guns and approximately
two million rounds of ammunition. Source told Wiley that
he knew this to be true because he had worked putting these
items there. Wiley himself definitely discounts this story.

Wiley reported that a source had obtained from another
source who worked at this place that there were 200 Russian
or East German (European) technicians at the Baracoa (ph)
base,

Wiley reported that he had received information that
at Marianu or Marianal there had been observed a number of
pairs of cranes. These pairs of cranes consisted of a large
crane and a small crane which are apparently built together
and are so designed that they are used for handling odd
shaped or unusual sized material. No other details given.

Wiley stated that inside the prison cell while he was
first incarcerated, he heard that the Cuban police claimed
that they had in prison the head of the sabotage group,
the head of the Activist groun and the Chief of Finance
of the MAR wovement in davana. Wiley siaied that he got
pretty close to the men in the cell. They apparently
liked him and in fact talked quite freely to him and that
when he szentioned this to several of these individuals, the
various men did not deny to him the above. Wiley said that
these prisoners admitted that they were connected with and
were leaders of one of the two major sections of the MRR in
Havana,

Wiley stated that one of the above mentioned men whose
name is Hermando Marchecho claimed that while being interro-
gated he was able to see reports which were signed by three
or four individuals which he recognized as double agents in
the ranks of MRR. Marchecho stated that as far as he was
concerned, the appearance of these names on reports indicated
that a heavy penetration of the MRR had been made by Castro's
intelligence. According to Wiley, Marchecho was completely
discouraged by this but nevertheless clearly indicated to
Wiley that he and his associates and his organization would
continue the struggle against Castro.

@ which he could then be considered an expert. Subject has
contacted a number of organizations in radio, television,
newspapers and magazines who had evidenced an interest in
securing from him stories, victures and taped interviews.
Approval for the trip was requested and $3,000 toward
financing of this trip. He was to depart toward the end
of May and return around the first of August. The memo is
initialed "OS/SE" (SE being Sheffield Edwards, Director of
Security).

Ultimately his travel voucher covering this trip reflected
expenses of $4,544.38 with $3,000 advanced and the "balance not
Claimed." His cover accounting for 7(6)-6/62 lists "Deficit on
trip to Asia" 1,544.38 as an expense and is offset against
listed income for that period. Besides other countries he was
in during the period 5/15 to 8/18/62, he spent 12 days in the
USSR and 14 days in Helsinki.

In September 1962, Wiley reported on an item from a
September 1962 edition of the National Review concerning @
statement by Red China's Marshal Chen.

Sometime in the fall of 1962, Wiley submitted three

veports relevant to a trip ho mace Guring the eee
& One report covered reports Wiley made to the U.S. Embassies
in 1962, reflecting that after travelling through Sydney,

Australic, Wiley contacted Rollard Haggart Bushner, American
Embassy, Djakarta, in early June, reporting that the Dutch
were preparing to pull out of New Guinea; that in late June
Wiley gave a copy of an exclusive interview with President
Diem of Vietnam to Robert Francis Krill, a USIS,official in
Vientiane; and that in late July (1962) Wiley contacted the
political section of the American Embassy in Helsinki reporting
information he had obtained in Samarkand and Tashkent, Soviet
Union. In each case he identified himself only as a newsman
who thought he should report interesting information to his
government. Wiley also reported to SRS interesting persons

visiting the USSR in July 1962, to wit: and
Professor and Mrs. who he met in Tashkent;
and who he met in Tbilisi. He also
formally reported on who he met in mid-June 1962

on a flight from Phom Penh to Saigon. In addition, he formally
reported information he received from an enlisted man at the
U.S. Air Station in Peshawar, Pakistan, in early June 1962,
concerning overflights by U.S. jets in Southern USSR.

@ .. TAIWAN AND FAR EAST TRIP - 1964

1
According to a memorandum dated 27 October 1964 -from

Morse Allen to Chief, SRS, the "Chinat" government offered

Wiley a two week, all expense paid, round trip to Taiwan as

a result of Wiley's American Legion magazine article on

Tibet. Wiley will lecture and talk in Taiwan, and his planned

departure was on or about 5 November 1964,

Allen recommended that Wiley be authorized to proceed
in this trip without any outside instruction in targets.
Allen further recommended that Wiley be given money in amount
of $500 to $1,000 to permit him to take advantage of the
"Chinat" trip and make a "free lance" trip through Far East
(Tokyo, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Thailand, Vietnam,| Malaysia)
and return via Manila, P.I.

Paul 5. Gaynor, Chief, SRS, noted in a slipiof paper
attached to Allen's memorandum that the Director|of Security
approved $1.000 advance on 28 October 1964. Wiley acknowledged

receipt of the $1,000 cash on 10 November 1964.
@ On 16 February 1965, an accounting for the above trip was

submitted by Wiley and $37. 28 of the $i, 000 advanced was returned
as the unused portion of the advance.

In the interim, by 16 November 1964, Wiley had contacted
Radio Free Europe in New York on his own, and had been slated
to do research on the Far East utilizing RFE files or in con-
junction with RFE officials. Wiley was also scheduled to act
as a free lance interviewer and reporter during the course of
an impending trip to the Far East. Through efforts of SRS,
this activity on the part of Wiley was curtailed,

WORLD YOUTH FESTIVAL, ALGIERS - 1965

The 9th Communist sponsored WYF, after early
speculation as to the probable site at which it would be
held, was finally announced for Algeria from 27 July to
6 August 1965. This WYF, however, was cancelled) in late
June 1965 despite the advance planning and arrangements
that had gone into it.

An August 13, 1964, memo from Morse Allen to C/SRS,
Subject: 9th WYF, concerns what, if anything, SRS and/or
Wiley might do regarding the probable holding of| a 9th
WYF during the summer of 1965. Wiley had severajl weeks
earlier reminded Allen that he, Wiley, had attended the
last one at Helsinki and had been active in the
"disruption of that festival." Wiley wanted to |know if
SRS had any planned operations in connection with 9th

or had SRS given any thought to setting up some plans.

He pointed out that it would take considerable tlime to
oxccuts plans for another penetration effort. Allen told
Wiley that Wiley was coo cid and itso TO
spearhead any U.S. activities in that Allen
said Wiley could, however, organize and direct it, possibly
from without the area, if it were decided for SRS to take

part. Wiley indicated that he would be perfect

ly willing

to commence working on it and to direct the operations
from behind the scenes. Allen asked Wiley to write up and
submit a proposal regarding same if he had a chance.

Allen suggested to C/SRS that the matter of penetration
and a disruptive effort in connection with the 9th WYF

be given consideration in the near future.

An October 1, 1964, memo for the record by |Morse Allen
records an interview he had with Wiley on 30 September 1964.
One long paragraph titled "Communist Youth Festival,
Algiers, July 1965" - notes that Wiley had spearheaded
anti-Communist attacks on Youth Festivals in Vienna and in
Helsinki previously, has disrupted their programs, and has
to a considerable extent interfered with their propaganda
at these festivals. Because of this, Wiley is interested
once again in divisive and disruptive efforts against
the Communists in Algiers in 1965. This time Wiley states

~ 44 -

SECRET

HW 50955 DocId:32203889 Page 32


- i

@ that it would be impossible to bring a big group|to

e Algiers and would in fact be dangerous because of the
attitude of the Moroccan government. Wiley believes
that it would be best to have a small team of 3 to 6
trained individuals who could proceed to the Youth
Festival at Algiers and who would be directed not at
disruption or propaganda, but would aim at intelligence
gathering. Wiley himself stated that he would again
volunteer to go to Algiers at this time, not ostensibly
connected with the aforementioned group, and only as a
free lance newspaperman. Wiley pointed out that
undoubtedly he is now the top news authority in the U.S.
on CP Youth Festivals. Wiley states that he believes
he can arrange financing from private organizations and
individuals for the 3 to 6 individuals mentioned above
and possibly enough for travel by himself although this
may not be obtainable, Wiley requests a study of this
matter and advice. |

Ethel Mendoza, SRS, received a phone call from

Wiley on 30 March 1965, wherein Wiley advised hé had
mailed material to Mendoza she had requested. Wiley
further adyised he was then on a Lecture tour enc

© United States. Wiley also discussed a previous

De
proposed trip to Algiers to cover the World Youth Festival
and recuested information as to whether he would be al-
lowed to cover the festival. Paul F, Gaynor recorded
that the Director of Security gave his approval|on
31 March 1965, but that Wiley's activity at the| festival
should be as a passive observer only.

A note dated 12 April 1965 to Chief, SRS from
Ethel Mendoza regarding a 9 April 1965 phone conversation
with Wiley states that in view of Wiley's plan to attend
the Youth Festival in August, she suggested that he not
repay the $1,000 advance for the China trip, but keep it
until he is assured of complete outside financing for the
Algiers trip. He would, as in the past, utilize this
fund to cover any deficit for his own travel costs; not
for any of the group which he supervises at the festival.
Wiley also inquiried as to extending his travel in
August to include 4-6 weeks in South America. jAlso,
regarding Algiers financing, Mendoza said she learned only
very recently that the anticipated funding in some part
will come from the backers of the American Security Council.

@ _ An April 16, 1965, note fr M

A 21 June 1965 memo from Wiley reflects the status
of his fund raising activities for the 9th WYF project
and some data regarding the project. Funds raised to
that date were some $1,485 or more under auspices of
"Christianform, Inc." Wiley said the goal is to send
6 delegates, 5 young men and a girl with a seventh
Person in Algiers outside the delegation. He will take
no active part in the project than to keep in touch
through the coordinator cutside the delegation Among
other things, each delegate is to get as much information
as possible about the U.S, delegation, including photos.
On return, all information on domestic leftists: will be
given to the FBI directly by the delegates. Wiley said
there is cood hope that the projected budget of $3,000
will be fulfilled and that none of the money raised for
this nroject will be used to pay Wiley's expenses. They
Wili be covered by the Cover Crganizati i

Ui €arniigs.

eS Although the WYF was belatedly cancelled in late
June, Wiley did follow through with the So. American
phase of his planned travel. Expense and travel vouchers
reflect that Wiley was in the U.S, in July and in the
U.S. and South America in August and September 1965.

Among the numerous potential contacts listed by
Wiley were Paul Bethel and Jules Dubois who Wiley was
told to avoid because they were being watched by local
services in South America. Wiley was told to be careful
in contacts with Manuel Artime and the DRE representatives.

On 30 July 1965, Allen met with Wiley in Washington,
D.C., giving him instructions and a briefing for the
South American trip. This data was formalized into a
memorandum by Allen on 5 August 1965 and forwarded to
Chief/SRS, P. F, Gaynor. Allen recorded:

"1 - On Friday, 30 July 1965, pursuant
to instruction from Chief, SRS, the
writer met Wiley at the Washington
National Airport and talked with

Suggestions and certain instructions

a. He was under no circumstances
to visit Latin America and
the trip was to include only
countries on the continent
of South America, starting
at Panama and thence South.

b. He was not to see either
Paul Bethel or Jules Dubois.

OTHER ACTIVITY, 1965-1974

There are handwritten notes of conversations with
Wiley dated 7, 14, 18, 19 and 24 May 1965. The gist is
that Wiley was apparently planning a trip to the mid west
and then later to Algiers in North Africa. During the
19 May 1965 conversation between Morse Allen and Wiley,
"Allen talked to Charles re Miss M's (Mendoza's) comments
that Charles had not complied with instructions re vouchers.
He (Wiley) claimed misunderstanding and that he could not
accurately furnish desired info on vouchers she presently
held. Allen told Chrles to use his memory and any notes he
had and to fill in desired info per the written instructions
given him by Miss M. (Ethel Mendoza). He said he would do
so. Allen then told him to explicitle follow written
instructions from Miss M. (Ethel Mendoza) or vouchers
could not be accepted....... Charles was also reminded of
reports due which he should get out prior to leaving on
his speaking tour. He agreed." Apparently, the trip was
to start on 23 May lasting until 1 June 1965 and the
Youig aAmwcricans
Wiley was going to Cleveland, Milwaukee, Chicago and
Minneapolis.

There are notes of conversation with Wiley dated
2, 7, 10, 15, 17, 22, 25, 28 June; 2, 6, 9, July and 27
July 1965. Apparently Wiley was having trouble with
his back at this time and could not sit down and bend
for typing. He was given the name of Dr. David S. Baldwin,
20 East 68th St., N.W., to contact. Regarding his travels,
Wiley was told he would have to submit detailed reports
of contacts to show what he is doing, etc. Apparently,
the mid-West speaking tour. was partially geared to gather
funds for Algerian trip.

There is a note in the file, to wit:
"For Wiley 7

“Why not get the American Legion magazine
to publish an Article 'Chaos in our Colleges’
with a hard attack on the weak knee college
and university advisers that permit violence,
disruptions, waste of college and tax payers
money, phoney students - what about the decent
students who want to study, etc." This note
was apparently written by Morse Allen.

HW 50955 DocId:32203889 Page 41


@

A 2 July 1965 handwritten note apparently pre-
pared for a briefing of Wiley states partially, "Turn
over any assts to 'B' (FBI) they want - cooperate."

In July 1965, Mendoza received information from
Wiley concerning his contacts with the American Security
Council (ASC) and a mid-West speaking trip during the
period 24 May to 1 June 1965. The latter trip, according
to Wiley, was paid for by the Young Americans for Freedom.
Regarding his contacts with tne American Security Council,
Wiley advised:

"My contact with ASC goes back to the
middle 1950's when I first met
At that time he was setting up the organization
based on | files. Before it was
named ASC, the org. was the Mid-American
Research Library, and, later, Fidelifax.
(Perhaps vise versa).

“Over the years I've been in touch with
ASC frequently. In addition to I know
- both Former FRI
men who worked on the subversive desk in New
York (and elsewhere?). left ASC in 1962
to join the Hoover Co., Canton, Ohio. My
last information is that he was in their White
Plains, N.Y. office. Another man in the Chicago

office whom I met was a research
specialist. I have no knowledge of his back-
ground.

"In the Washington Office, I know Lee: Pennington
a friend for years before he joined ASC. While he was
in Washington, I also knew Frank Johnson (a former ONI
man?). I believe he is presently in Europe.

“My first contact with Dewitt Copp was in the fall
of 1964. (NOTE: During my conversation with Copp he
told me that the Chinese Air Force U-2 Flights were tied
in with CIA). I spoke to him about my trip to Asia
because of his having been in the area and to obtain
outlets for material. Copp was in close touch with
the Chinese Embassy, and I think it was Frank Toa who

1 suggested I see him. Copp offered to take taped material
. from me. My only other contact was a-phone talk with him
in March 1965S.

"While in Taiwan I was told by Col. Caithness
of the U.S.M.A.A.G. office that Copp had directly
attributed information to another MAAG officer who
had briefed him. When the story was printed (by North
American Newspaper Alliance?), the officer was in trouble.
Caithness indicated that he thought it was an honest
breakdown in communication between the officer and Copp
and that it was not deliberate. During. my March phone
conversation with Copp I told him about Caithness'
disclosure to me (he had agreed that I tell Copp about
the situation). Copp seemed quite surprised.

"On March 16 I had dinner with [ss in New
York. is handling radio programs for ASC (out of
the Washington office). He also produces shows for NBC
radio (including a farm Program). I've also had several
es Phone couversations with] jin Washington.

On 29 Docember 1y65, witey callea Morse Alien, vave
information concerning a forthcoming Esquire article on
espionage; and brought up the idea of moving to Washington.

@ Apparently Allen arranged to have Wiley call Cecil Tighe,
SRS, the following Monday and for Tighe to advise Wiley
to come to Washington in the near future to discuss the
matter with Tighe and Gaynor. Apparently, Allen was
removing himself from contact with Wiley at about this
time.

Apparently on 14 January 1966 Gaynor and Tighe met
with Wiley discussing his possible move to Washington,
his lecture tour and use of vouchers for travel expenses,
A notation dated only 1966 states to the effect that
Wiley's company, World News Analysis, is known on the
"Hill" because of the relationship between Filipello
(sic) and Congressman Daddario. “Numerous persons know
Wiley is CIA, other than perhaps a half-dozen of his own
friends. These include Eugene Lyons, Jay Kennedy, Elsa
Bernaut, Hede Massing, etc. (Note: Mccord is not aware
of the first two names above, and this possibly would
have some bearing on any assignment McCord may have been
considering.)"

Arlington House Publishers was the subject of a
report submitted during January 1967. The report dis-
cusses the factional fight to control the publishing
company.

In March 1967, Wiley prepared a report which he
captioned, "D.C. Reaction to Exposure of CIA Cover
Operations." It would appear that the majority of the
information came from Nick Nonnenmacher, administrative
assistant to Rep. Henry C. Shadeburg,

Circa March 1967, Wiley forwarded three brochures
distributed by the Canadian Loyalist Movement which were
mailed to Wiley (?) by F.C. Pilkington, North Vancouver,
B.C., Canada.

An undated report, captioned, “Edward (Ted) Scott"
is based presumably on information provided to Wiley by
Malcolm (Mac) Johnson, news manager, NBC-TV, New York
City. Scott was then an NBC stringer in Cairo, Egypt.

parades throughout the country on October 21-22 1967,
mobilizing support for U.S. soldiers in Vietnam and

_ respect for law and order. Wiley's participation with
this group was the topic of an article appearing in the
20 August 1967 edition of The Worker, captioned,
"The Elusive Charles Wiley,” rehashing some of the
prior material published about Wiley's background.

At least two magazine articles written by Wiley
were introduced into the "Congressional Record." One
on 22 June 1966 by Senator Peter H. Dominick (also
previously submitted by Senator Joseph M. Montoya)
and another on 27 April 1965 by Representative E. Brad-
ford Morse.

In December 1970, Wiley prepared a report concerning
David Braum of the Vietnam Veterans Against the War.

In early January 1972, Wiley submitted a program

captioned "Friendship Program for Foreign Military Per-
sonnel Stationed in the United States," which in) essence

would be a U.S.O. for foreign military personnel stationed

in the U.S. Wiley contended it would build up good will and
. friendship. Wiley was told we have no interest in such a
«+ project.

The fall 1972 "Arlington House Publishers" contained
an article by Intelligence Source edited by Charles Wiley, as
to why Source . a charter manber of the Americam Communist
Party, joined the Party and then left to Fight Communisn.
From 1970-72, Wiley, at t request of SRS, monitored

Source book to make sure any cperations in which Source
might have been involved were not exposed.

Intelligence Source _ a former KGB officer who
defected in . has been and continues to be of Agency
interest. For some time, Source had expressed a personal
desire to author a factual book on the KGB based on his per-
sonal knowledge and observations. The draft of a proposed
manuscript was prepared, and Source requested assistance
in obtaining an editorial review and an introduction to
persons in’ the publishing business who might be interested
in publishing a factual type book on the KGB.

Wiley was introduced to Sanree (as an indivi

could give torial assis ol ain
in the publishing business. During July - August i972,
@ Wiley met Source on three occasions. There was a degree
of incompatibility of temperaments, in addition to a dif-
ference of opinion concerning general content, format and
tenor of the proposed manuscript, and at the request of
Source; any further involvement of Wiley with regard to
the proposed manuscript was terminated.

Circa September 1973, Wiley prepared a report which
he captioned, "Personnel on Staff of Soviet Exhibition at
EXPO, Montreal, Canada - July 1973," wherein he indicated
he attended EXPO on 14 July 1975. He also provided a photo-
graph of an individual believed Russian, he thought of interest.
Vasaly directed the report of photos to John Dempsey, C/RB and
Bruce Solie. The latter said he was unable to do anything w
the photos at the time and directed the material back to Vasaly
for the Wiley file.

the Foreign Ministry of that country. The Vietnamese
Government will pay all his transportation and living
@ : costs while on the trip and the invitation resulted from

. urgings by Nguyen Quoc Ten, press officer of the
Vietnamese mission to the U.N. in New York City. Wiley
was certain that his reputation as a friend of the Vietna-
mese triggered the invitation.

Approval was given him to make the trip; however,
his request to extend the trip through other places
in the Far East and Europe was turned down.

On 18 December 1967, Cecil Tighe(SRS) reported in
the memo to the Chief, SRS, that Wiley briefed him on the
forthcoming trip on 15 December 1967. Wiley was told
to stay out of the front lines and take precautions not
to involve himself in any situation that might jeopardize
his safety. Ralph True (Chief/SAD, OS) accompanied Tighe
to the meeting and True presented a requirement to Wiley
to which he acceded. Apparently True's Presence at the
meeting had the approval of the Chief, SRS. Wiley

Wiley submitted a report concerning a debriefing
concerning his Vietnam trip.

"During a debriefing session in Washington, D.C.
30 April 1968 (by Bob Long?), I was rather surprised
by the lack of interest in my findings. The interviewer
asked almost no questions and didn't take notes. In
talking to someone who has a great many sources of
information available, I had little way of knowing what
might be of interest to hin. On several occasions during
the interview I specifically asked if there were any
particular information that he wanted. There was no
response,

"I was in Vietnam for over a month - through the
Tet "truce" offensive - as a guest of that country's
government. I had private discussions with President
Thieu, Vice President Ky, Some of these were very
frank. All were long (over two hours each with Thieu
and KY) and I was treated as a friend. In addition,

or reached these men through personal introductions from
mutual friends, At no point in the debriefing was I
asked whom I had contacted and there was no interest
when I volunteered the information,

"The fact that I have an almost open door to the office
of the Vietnamese ambassador in Washington and their United
Nations Mission also met with no response. I am in a posi-

co) EUROPEAN TRIP, 1970

Wiley, who claims that the basic reason for the trip
was an invitation from the German Ministry of Defense, visited
West Germany, England, Italy, France, Belgium, The Netherlands
and Yugoslavia. During the German sojourn he visited the
German Army, Navy-and Air Force installations. He was told
prior to departure that CIA had no tasks for him to perform.
The results of Wiley's trip appeared in the American Legion
magazine for March 1971. Financial and other records fail
to reflect any approval of and payment for Wiley for this
trip.

Circa August 1970, Wiley prepared a report on one
Benigno Naval from the Philippines, near Manila. Apparently,
Wiley met Naval "enroute to the Bonn Airport." This informa-
tion was formalized into a report on 25 September 1970 and
sent to C/ID/1 with the intention it be provided to FE Divi-
sion.

considered her his protegee and claimed to have given her
training and counsel and also to have directed her to the FBI.

Mendoza of SRS, his then case officer, that he, Wiley,
believed a trip to Miami, Fla, in the near future could
be very profitable from both the straight reporting
aspect, and through his thus being able to re-establish

. contact with several Cubans with whom he is acquainted.
His most important contact is with Manuel Artime, one
of the leaders of the Cuban invasion force, who has just
been released by Castro. Miss Mendoza further noted
that Wiley is also acquainted with several other Cubans
of some importance, one of these being a member of the
"Alpha 66" group which ran several small operations
against Cuba during 1962.

From 31 January through 10 February 1963, Wiley
was in Miami, Fla., contacting Cuban exiles and exile
organizations. His main target was Manuel Artime and
his associates, with secondary target, the Cuban
Student Directorate. He submitted a long and detailed
report of his trip. Some of the information was pub-
lished into finished memoranda.

@ a A. If Mr. Wiley, because of his talents

and capacity as a writer-journalist

‘ and his considerable knowledge of

a Soviet activity throughout the world,
is offered a highly remunerative job
job with a major publication, news
service or radio chain, Mr. Wiley
(ostensibly) will sever his connection
with us and go on the payroll of the
organization chosen and will retain
our connection on a purely personal
basis.

B. If Mr. Wiley does not find this
situation attractive, he is to be
considered for conversion to staff
employee, where his considerable
capabilities could be fully exploited.

"However, these ideas are not yet at the point of develop-
ment and Mr. Wiley is to continue to operate under the current
arrangement."

On 15 January 1963, Allen wrote a further description
of Wiley's use to the Chief, Security Research Start thivugi

2 the Deputy Chief, Security Research Staff as follows:

- "1, Attached herewith is a summary and a status
report on Charles William Wiley which was requested by
Chief, SRS, several weeks ago. The report was prepared
after numerous conferences with Mr. Wiley by Miss Finan,
Miss Mendoza and Mr. Allen. The attachment referred to
as a 'Contact List' was prepared upon our instructions
by Mr. Wiley himself and no additions or corrections
have been made. It is believed self-explanatory.

"2, For matter of record, we wish to again em-
phasize that certain items are omitted from the Con-
tact List and omitted generally from the report itself
for security reasons. These are as follows:

1) Because of Mr. Wiley's various

3). In addition to the above, Mr.
Wiley has conducted activities with
cognizance of SRS which are omitted

Very briefly, these activities can be
summarized as follows:

a. Scouting anti-CIA attacks in

d. Writing or helping write pro-

of this report that Mr. Wiley's services are unique and
outstanding and that he should be retained for the pre-
sent in the same contractual way, with consideration
strongly urged to effecting a method whereby his salary

(Apparently the summary and status report and Contact
List to which Mr. Allen refers is the previous quoted memo
of 9 January.)

During February and March 1963, SRS representatives met
with Wiley for discussion of an objective to place a skilled
and controlled source in the newspaper community in Washington,

{D. C. who would have normal, routine, and ready access to the

' Washington writing and radio colony. The long range plan was
to have Wiley move to Washington, and begin extensive writing
and lecturing to establish his prestige, and to slowly cur-
tail his other activities except for keeping his “excellent
Cuban and anti-Castro connections.'"' The basic plan was to be
forwarded to the Director of Security by the Chief, SRS, for
consideration. Tentative approval must have been received
inasmuch as on 26 March 1964, Morse Allen requested the
assistance of[ fr information as to an assess-
ment of Wiley's work, and the best method for establishing
prestige for a writer. Wiley was not identified by name.

In the interim, on 30 March 1964,[.~~~-~-—~«dr contacted
Morse Allen, confirmed Wiley's writing talent, and arranged
for an introduction of Wiley to General

Manager of Script (sic) Howard, Wiley contacted| through

The plan, as follows, was presented in an undated memo-
randum form for the Director of Security:

"During the week of February and on 7 and
8 March 1963, extensive discussions were held with
Wiley concerning matters which are set out in de-
tail following. Mr. Wiley is in agreement with
Chief/SRS and representatives of SRS that the pro-
posed plan which follows is the most sound, logical,
and secure method of obtaining the desired results:

"OBJECT - To place a skilled and controlled
a abe A :
source in some type of a position in Washington,
D. C., Which will have normal, routine, and ready
access to the Washington writing and radio colony.

“PROBLEM - Source must have sufficient back-
ground and prestige to be accepted; he must have

from his own efforts); he must have a valid rea-

: son for being in Washington; he must have high

d capacity to produce; he must-have a strong secu-
rity sense; and he must have unquestioned loyalty.

"PROPOSED SOLUTI

"a. SOURCE - Source to be used is Wiley. Wiley
fits in nearly every particular to the elements set
out in the 'Problem" above.

"b. METHOD OF SOLUTION:

"1, Source will begin at once to write
articles of importance, aiming at the placing
of these articles in national magazines, partie-
ularly magazines of the type of Life, Look,
Readers Digest, McCalls, Argosy, etc. Source

has numerous valid ideas for these articles and

already some interest has been shown
writings by Editors of the aforementioned type
magazines. Source will slowly divorce himself
from his numerous activities in New York City,
maintai

connections. Sovrce will need approximately

three months to write these articles and to sell
them, It is Source's intention that these articles
carry his by-line, which is a basic element to
building prestige necessary for Source's future
activity. Source is convinced he can handle this
successfully.

"Note: Heretofore Source has, under instruction,
kept the use of his name to an absolute minimum for
obvious reasons. This requirement will now be
lifted.

"2, At the same time Source will prepare
brochures for a lecture tour to be given by
Source during the Fall and early Winter, basically
on Cuba and Latin America. Already Source has
drafted brochures and he will have professional
guidance in this matter.

aa ‘Note: Source is an excellent lecturer. He

has a high capacity in this area. This
lecture tour, details of which will be set
out below, is considered of key importance
to the basic problem.

"3, Starting on or about the first of
July, Source will make an extensive tour of
Central and South America as a free lance re-
porter/writer/photographer, using his credentials
from the World News Analysis. Entree basically
will be provided using numerous Cuban contacts
Source has obtained throughout Latin and South
American countries. This trip will take probably
the most of July, August, and part of September
and is regarded as essential for back up, for
prestige, for area knowledge, and for lecture
material.

"Note: , Source is known to have excellent
Cuban antitCastro connections which will be sharpened
for use on this tour. (Source has been in every
area of the world except Latin and South America.)

and prepare for the aforementioned lecture tour.
© (It should be noted that there is no lecture

activity during the Summer months.) After pre-
paration, Source will proceed to make a lecture

tour covering all parts of the United States and
addressing all types of audiences. Source's

lecture tour will be run through the sponsorship of
the Babcock Agency of Virginia Beach, Virginia. This
Agency, which handles among others the important
members of the National Review Staff, will be
handled on a direct commission basis taking a usual
ten percent fee. In addition, through other organi-
zations Source will.arrange lectures on his own which
is routine and which will not conflict in any way
with the Babcock Agency interest. Source antici-
pates completing the lecture tour about the first

of the year 1964, at which time he will return to
New York City.

Source (spreadhis name before the public),
@ and it will give him the necessary oppor-

tunity to conduct the following business:

As Source makes his lecture tour he will
attempt, by direct contact and through al-
ready established channels, to determine
whether or not he can set up for the basic
plan (a) a daily column, (b) a newsletter,

(c) a radio spot news broadcast. The lecture
tour, of course, will place Source in given
areas and it would be completely logical for
him to talk to local editors and radio station
owners and managers while in the area. He will
be backed up by the fact that he is lecturing
and that he is a writer because of the pre-
viously mentioned articles.

"d. Upon his return to New York City on or about
the first of the year 1964, Source will then be
able to make a definitive statement as to whether
or not he can conduct on a continuing basis and
on an economically sound basis (a) a daily column;
(b) a weekly newsletter; or (c) a radio newscast
enna

"Note: Source has evolved an idea of making
@ short newscasts which he believes can be peddled
is on a spot basis to various local radio chains,
perhaps weekly. This idea, which is novel, ap-
pears to have a great deal of merit.

"e. After Source and SRS staff have had a chance
to analyze the total result, a decision will then
be reached as to the feasibility of moving Source
to Washington. If the results of the above set
out plans indicate that Source can logically appear
in Washington, he will then, for a period of about
30 to 60 days while operating either his column,
newsletter or radio broadcast bureau, shuttle back
and forth between New York and Washington obviously
seeking news. He will let it be known to his friends
in the newspaper and writing business that the pres-
sure of his work is such that he will need some
office space in Washington at which time, more or

downtown location a combination business office
and living quarters, possibly at some such place
‘ as the 1028 Connecticut Avenue Building.

"f£. After this test, Source will 'discover' that
“he can best operate out of Washington and he will
then establish an office and purchase a house or
other accommodations and bring his family to Wash-
ington.

"g. At this point Source will be operating on

his own as a news gatherer. He will be established
as such and he will have access to the various
press conferences and other news making areas in
Washington and he will by necessity mingle with

the local newsmen and radio people.

"COMMENTS:

"The main question concerning the above plan was
whether or not this could be accomplished in a shorter
time guaranteeing soundness, logic, and security. Many
approaches were studied and for the reasons set out be-
low they were discarded as not workable or unsound, pe-

tails follow:

"1. Do we have a cover organization in
Washington that would be usable in connection
with the set out plan?

As far as we can now determine, there
is no suitable cover organization in Washington
\that would cover the movement of the Source into
\Washington, explain his presence there, and give
‘him a required freedom of movement in the area of
‘interest. We have no totally controlled newspaper
“property, news bureau, or radio bureau in Washing-
ton, nor do we have any organization where Source
could be planted without creating a questionable
situation.

"2. Could we establish a 'grant' which
would do as a cover for bringing Source into
| Washington?

“A very careful study of this problem in-
it . pefspqates that this is probably not logical. A

"4. Could Source obtain employment on a
Congressional Committee on either side of the
Hill which would give him access to the areas
of interest? :

"Source has exceptional connections on the
Hill and it is believed that through these con-
nections he might obtain some type of assign-
ment on a temporary basis or perhaps on a regular
basis. However, in the opinion of the SRS staff
this is exceptionally hazardous and if it became
known through some misfortune, it would be of
enormous embarrassment to Agency officials. In
addition, Source might well obtain employment
with the Congressional Committee, but his work
might be too limiting to permit him to move about
and it might well preclude any opportunity he had
of making contact with the local press. Further-
more, most Committee assignments, investigative or
otherwise, generally follow a 9 to 5 routine on
the Hill and free lancing and freedom of movement

are not easily obtained in Congressional Committees.

It is regarded as impossible to place Source on a
Congressional Committee if the employing Senator
or Congressman was ta be informed even in a most
nominal way of Scurce's mission.

"S. Can the basic plan be telescoped on a
shorter basis?

"This is considered questionable by those
who have worked in this area for some time. If
we shorten the approach, we would obviously cut
down on our Source's background and prestige,
particularly in an area where stature is neces-
sary. The articles using Source's by-line, if
they are successful, would be very important and
would serve as a basis for everything that would
follow. The South American trip is needed and
Source would have at the present time the best
possible chance for success based on his Cuban
contacts which are very strong at the present
time. A possibility also exists on such a trip
that Source might be fortunate enough to achieve
an important newspaper scoop which, of course,
would build prestige and quite conceivably place

effort can be aimed at this. However, it is pos-
sible that a long range plan as set out above
might be used successfully in combination with a
shorter more direct plan unless the shorter plan

SLUAL EA

@ i On 1 October 1964, Morse Allen wrote a memorandum
* €or the record reporting an interview with Wiley as follows:

"On 30 September 1964, the writer talked with Wiley
at the writer's apartment in Washington, D.C., for several
hours. The conversation was general and part of it was
devoted to the discussion of financial matters, routine
operational problems, and comments primarily on the local
New York scene.

“Of particular interest, however, in addition to the
above, were the following:

"(b) Malcolm X - Wiley had previously interviewed
Maicolm X (Glalcolm Little) before the former's recent
trip to Egypt and Africa and the Middle East. The
writer requested Wiley, at his earliest possible con-
venience, to reinterview Malcolm X, particularly stress-
ing Malcolm X's views of individuals with whom he had
talked and any personalities of information which could
be of intelligence use. It should be noted that Wiley
regards Malcolm X as probably the shrewdest of the
Negro leaders and according to Wiley, Malcolm X talks
freely to him because Wiley and Malcolm X have an
understanding not to mince words or to be evasive

when they are talking.

"(c) Communist Youth Festival, Algiers, July (2) 1965

It should be noted that Wiley has spearheaded anti-
Communist attacks on Youth Festivals in Vienna and in
Helsinki previously, has disrupted their programs, and

has to a considerable extent interfered with their
propaganda at these festivals. Because of this,
Wiley is interested once again in divisive and dis-
ruptive efforts against the Communists in Algiers

in 1965. This time Wiley states that it would be
dangerous because of the attitude of the Moroccan
Government. Wiley believes that it would be best

to have a small team of three to six trained in-
dividuals who would proceed to the Youth Festival

at Algiers and who would be directed not at dis-
ruption or propaganda, but would aim at intelligence
gathering. Wiley himself stated that he would again
volunteer to go to Algiers at this time, not ostensi-
bly connected with the aforementioned group, and only
as a free lance newspaperman. Wiley pointed out that
undoubtedly he is not the top news authority in the
United States on Communist Party Youth Festivals.
Wiley states that he believes he can arrange financing
from private organizations and individuals for the
three to six individuals mentioned above and possibly

enough for travel by himself although this may not be

"(4) Bay of Pigs Book Review - Wiley stated that he
cannot as yet explain why the National Review did not
publish his Bay of Pigs review, but in Fact paid him
for it. He is convinced that the review was withheld
because of some Agency influence. He submitted cor-
respondence from Frank Meyer, one of the editors of
the National Review in this connection.

"(e) The Kennedy Book - Wiley commented that his friend
Dick Whalen, an outstanding young writer, has just com-
pleted a book on either Joseph B. Kennedy or the Kennedy
—— family for which Whalen received ‘$100,000 in advance.
Wiley states that he has helped Whalen write the book,
giving him advice and assisting him editorially. Wiley
States that there are two items of which he is extremely
pleased of his work in connection with this book:

(1) He convinced Whalen to rewrite

(2) He had deleted from the book an
entire section which .was devoted
ta alleging that CIA was respon-
sible for the assassination of
Trujillo.

(3) Wiley added that the Kennedy
book contained an index and
just before the book was to
go to the printers, a proof-
reading of the index showed
that there were numerous. errors
in it. The publishers, upon
discovering this, asked Wiley
to correct the index, making

_— such annotations and correc-
tions as necessary with highest
priority. Wiley stated that
it took him 36 hours of con-
tinuous work to complete and
correct the index and for this
effort he has sent the publishers

a bill for $500.

' Free China Weekiy, dated 6 September 1964. This publi-

Cation is published for overseas distribution from

top of page 3 in which the Free China Weekly comments
on the article written by Charles W. Wiley in the Sep-
tember issue of the American Legion Magazine concerning
Tibet. Wiley indicates that is good publicity since
the paper is sent all over the world."

\ lining the use of Wiley, to wit:

"Wiley has been # contract agent of sps

an index of the Daily Worker on a grant from the
Americanism Commission of American Legion. The
grant was depleted before the index was completed;
SRS arranged to finance same, and eventually ob-
tained a copy of the index. From 1957-1959, Wiley
was financed as a cleared source from.both OS and
CI Staff funds.

"Wiley's contract does not require renewal
and can be terminated for cause or otherwise with
a meximum of 90 days notice, SRS has no agree-

» Ments with Wiley as to length of contracc and he
is not entitled to leave, retirement, or other
@ benefits normally due an employee.

"Wiley is paid from OS funds in the amount
of $10,500 base salary, plus a quarterly payment
of $131.25 in lieu of retirement and hospitaliza-_
tion. He is paid his local travel expenses (which
in the last fiscal year have been extremely low)
on a monthly voucher arrangement. All payments are
deposited through covert Agency channels into a
separate bank account for Wiley in New York.

"By virtue of his non-government activities in
obtaining photographic assignments and in assisting
other writers in research, in addition to occasional
sales of his articles directly to publishers, Wiley's
cover firm has so far been self-funding.- He usually
requires a large out-lay of cash in addition to his
regular payments only if he is making an overseas trip.

at the front in Vietnam with American enlisted men
during 1964 received considerable attention when
utilized by one of the major radio networks, and
his articles regarding Vietnam and other projects
which appeared in a well-known magazine received
much favorable comment."

Sometime before 24 January 1967, Wiley prepared two re-
ports relative to a possible trip to Hanoi. When the reports
were presented to Paul F. Gaynor, Chief, SRS, on 27 February
1967, Gaynor designated "No" to certain proposals made by
Wiley, to wit:

a. The use of credentials from established media.

b. Accompaniment of Wiley by FBI controlled sources

2. To assessing them, but under

any recruitment.

On 26 April 1967, Tighe formalized to the C/SRS a
memorandum of discussion with Wiley, captioned "Wiley's
affiliation with the Support Our Boys in Vietnam parade,
New York City, 13 May 1967," to wit:

"1. In accordance with your instruc-
tions, I advised Wiley that he had received

"2, Wiley advised he had been
appointed Press Office for the Support
Committee and had as his first act in
this capacity obtained from the New
York City Police Department a permit
to parade on Fifth Avenue on 13 May.

At the present time, he is attempting

to locate a colored Congressional Medal
of Honor Vietnam veteran to appear and
speak on the day in question. At. the
moment, he is attempting to reach Gen.
Westmorland to obtain a statement from
him regarding the uplift of morale such
a parade will have on the fighting forces
in Vietnam.

"3. Today Wiley is also attempting
to have an audience with George Meany,
President, AFL, in order to enlist his

7 assistance in obtaining participants
for the parade. Wiley. in addition,
. is aiso going tu request Mr. Meany
to issue a directive to all AFL-CIO
® unions to send participants and back
the parade to its fullest extent.

seen Gleason, President of ILA and
ILA has promised its full cooperation.

already lined up all of the veteran

"6. Finally, Wiley said that if
he had difficulty with the military in
New York City with respect to his re-
quest for a Negro Medal of Honor winner
to appear for the parade, he may ask
assistance from us. In summary, he H
said that if this thing bombs, the
New Left, including Martin Luther King,
Stokley Carmichael, McKissic, et all will never
let the country forget it."

When the C/SRS, Paul Gaynor, reviewed this memo,
Gaynor - adjacent to the last paragraph - commented, "No.
He should deel with Army. Tiere is only one such Caolored

@ i Medal of Honor winner), a medical corps specialist."

On 1 May 1967, Tighe wrote a formal memo of a dis-
cussion with Wiley on that date regarding "A report from
Wiley regarding the forthcoming parade in New York on 13 May."
The body of the memorandum reflects among other matters that
Wiley claimed he had phone contact with John Roach regarding
possible White House support for the parade. John Roach was
an assistant to Harry McPherson of the White House Staff.
"Roach has promised the Committee substantial support."

A brief memorandum by Tighe, dated 3 May 1967, con-
tains as an attachment an article from the 3 May 1967 edi-
tion of the New York Times concerning the "Support Our Boys
in Vietnam Parade.” The C/SRS brought the article to the
attention of the Director of Security, Howard J. Osborn,
who penned the word "Encouraging" on the transmittal slip.

On 15 June 1967, Tighe formalized information from
Wiley, to wit:

“2. Much of his ambition stems
from a remark that Tina is reported to
have made to him and to which he agrees.
Wiley said that Tina said he could make
a million dollars in public relations
work if he promoted something in which
he was really interested, Wiley stated
to me that this is true because he has

his recent work

for us. He said now he plans to start

"3. He is so carried away by his
exuberance that he requested permission
to use up to and including $1,000 of our
funds to establish an office, print up
letterheads and use our fund$ to make
long distance telephone calls to the
various 120 cities. He plans to call
his office, The Committee for Responsi-
ble Patriotism. From what I can gather,
he has no support from any source but on
his own initiative he prepared two letters,
one to General Eisenhower and one to former
President Harry S. Truman, which IT have
attached for your information, He re-
quested that through our liaison with
General Eisenhower and Harry S. Truman
we approach them and solicit their sup-
port in his behalf.

"4. I explained to Wiley that his
interest was well motivated but under no
circumstances would we permit an expendi- |
ture of any funds in this regard. I also |
told him it would be extremely awkward for

"5. There is a strong possibility

courage Wiley in his efforts, particularly
when it's going to cost us money." |

At the conclusion of the last paragraph, C/SRS, Paul
. F. Gaynor, noted, "Yes. We cannot spend our funds for
| internal propaganda purposes."

There is a record of a 2 January 1970 phone conversa-
tion with Wiley concerning Wiley's involvement in pro-Viet
Nam activity. "Wiley said had been coordinated at a high
lovel with tne Pentagon and ho has their OK," regarding
prisoner of war activity. The writer noted, “Discussion
with Wiley relayed to P.G. I suggested that during next
meeting with Wiley, he be told that while we do no (sic)
disapproval of his actions in this respect, we cannot
approve, sponsor or imply approval in any way. P.G.

said

This record is quoted as follows:

"Charles Wiley called collect
and said his organization's campaign
to get humane treatment for prisoners
of Hanoi (i.e., signatures to petitions)
was going very well and that they had
‘tens of thousands' of signatures with
the efforts his workers had put out.
This activity, Wiley said had been
coordinated at a high level with the
Pentagon and he has their OK. Through
the Pentagon, they have been in touch
with the wives. However, they plan to

phase out of this activity at the end
of the month. They'tll.turn it over to
the wives. They are running out of
money and have enough to last until

end of month. They'll put this activity
on shelf for a few months. They have had
‘unbelievable backing’ from #2 man in
New York State. Wants to hold off a
week or so on status report on this,

In coordination with Pentagon, they
merely advise of what they plan and

tell Pentagon to object in writing if

they do. Discussion with Wiley relayed
to P.G. I suggested that during next
meeting with Wiley, he be told that
while we do no disapprove of his
actions in this respect, we can

not approve, sponsor, or imply

approval in any way. P.G. said

OK tell him."

A blind memurandum regarding Wiley was prepared iy

CIA Covert Employee: SRS, on 14 April 1970, being directed to
Paul F. Gaynor, who noted his concurrence. In total, the
memorandum states:

"Subject (Wiley) telephoned today
after having talked with Mr. McCord and
advised that he had unfortunately lost
the race to be a Congressional candidate
from his district. I extended sympathy
but personally felt this resolved a pro-
blem that could have resulted in his
termination should he have been elected
a candidate.

"Subject asked whether there were
any questions concerning his income
tax form, and I advised him, after con-
sulting with the Head of the Covert Tax
Committee, that there did not appear to
be any significant questions. Subject

informed me that he would then go
ahead and file his return to IRS,
Mr. Powell, however, of the Covert
Tax Committee, did say that they
had some questions concerning Sub-
ject's expenses under Schedule C.
Specifically, whether Subject's
trunk line to New York City, cable
address, and trips to Washington
had been reimbursed by the Agency.
I informed Mr. Powell that we had
no record of any such reimburse-
ment and that these expenses were
assumed by Subject, solely.

"It was indicated by Subject
that it was hopeful his throat ail-
ment would soon clear which would
make it possible for him to visit
Washington within the next week or
two.

“It would seem prudent to me,
prior to Subject's pending visit,
that we prepare something akin to
an agreement or letter of instruc-
tion which would clearly indicate
to Subject that assignments to him,
whether oral or not, would eventually
be followed up by written confirma-
tion of such assignment. Such a
letter of understanding or agree-
ment would, it seems to me, serve
to protect Subject as well as the
Agency in the event of any further
problem or incident which might
involve Subject. For example,
many of Subject's activities may
be construed as domestic political
action and as such could be identi-
fied as an Agency contractual em-
ployee. From time to time, as you

. and may assume that such advice and
acknowledgement on our part would be
Agency approval for his activities.
While such is not the case, it is
believed that we should formalize
this part of our contract with him
so that he knows that his personal
activities, regardless of area, are
not construed as an extension of
Agency plans or programs. At the
same time, Subject can be assured
of our continuing interest in him
as a "standby" asset.

"Should you have any questions
concerning this subject, I would be
pleased to discuss them further."

Attached to this blind memorandum is a Memorandum of
Understanding, dated 29 April, signed by Wiley, with an
indicated copy given to Wiley, stating:

misunderstanding in the future and in
recognition of my many personal and
official activities, I agree that any
assignments given to me by my associates
in Washington will be made a matter of
written record, As security permits and
when convenient and possible, I will be

i PERSONAL ACTIVITY

Since 1966, Wiley's specific assignments for OS have
been at a minimum, whereas his personal activities have
increased, Much of his personal activity has been or
might be construed as having been domestic political action.
In 1970, his name was placed as a candidate for U.S. Repre-
sentative from the 15th district of New Jersey, but he
failed to receive the nomination. However, in‘1972, he
did campaign as an Independent candidate: for the U.S. Senate
in New Jersey. He received approximately one per cent of the
ballots cast in the election won by Senator Clifford P. Case.

He has been active in and frequently the prime mover
in a number of organizations of conservative or right-wing
persuasion. As such, he has earned considerable reputation
as a capable coordinator and organizer through actions in
support of "pro-American" and conservative causes. The
parades, receptions, petition gathering, demonstrations
and other publicity making ventures in which he has par-

iu pated have run the ¢ t ef support tor the kenuoiic
@ of Vietnam, U.S. war policies, strong national defense pos-
ture, the Nationalist Chinese, U.S. prisoners in foreign

lands and anti-bussing for integration.

Among these organizations with which he has been pro-
minently identified are: :

Parents and Taxpayers: an organization opposing bussing
for integration. He was doing public relations for this group
as early as 1964 and has been periodically involved in this
activity with this and other organizations to date.

Free China Support Group and The Committee of 1,000,000:
these organizations are pro-Nationalist China and actively
opposed the U.S. recognition of the Peoples Republic of China.

Young Americans for Freedom: a conservatively oriented
youth group.

Committee to Unite America: as a member in 1971, he
was active in its efforts aimed at lowering the level of
public hostility toward government policies.

National Committee for Responsible Patriotism (NCRP):
as its Executive Director and one of its foundens in 1967,
he has been its principal member and has been involved
with managing its office, raising funds, and charting its
activities. Operating principally with volunteers and
donated funds, Wiley, who has occasionally received some
private remuneration for his services, has organized
numerous parades, receptions, motorcades, banquets and
programs. He has arranged publicity and made a number
of media appearances. In connection with these and other
activities he has had close contact with labor leaders,
the military and the White House. In April 1973,! Wiley
received a signed commendation from President Nixon in
recognition of his efforts, which states:

“Dear Mr. Wiley:

@ 1 TERMINATION

During the course of the reorganization of the Office
of Security, it was decided that the Security Research
Staff would be abolished. This decision led to the prepa-
ration of a memorandum for the Director of Security from
the Chief, Security Staff, dated 1 June 1973, captioned
"Request for Director of Security Assessment Regarding
Continuance of Functions and Possible Replacement." The
last paragraph of this memorandum stated:

"For immediate planning purposes, to
fulfill the early deadline already established,
it would be appreciated if you would review the
attached outlines of existing functions and in-
dicate your desires regarding thé function (con-
tinue, continue with low priority, discontinue)
and where you wish any retained functions to be
2ced in the reorganization structure. In the
ce, T have attempted to indi
_ the more likeiy options for this to facilitate

your assessment."

On 4 June 1973, the Director of Security indicated
that "Special Access Sources" should
continue on a low priority and be transferred to the Opera-
tional Support Branch.

On 8 June Hogs cannon iaae (SRS), in a memorandum
to the Chairman, Clearance Division Implementation Committee,
OS/PSI, reorganization subject "Research Branch, Clearance
Division, OS/DD/PSI, Implementation" noted that Special
Access Source Wiley had been approved to be continued,
but on a low priority basis and transferred to the Opera-
tional Support Branch.

Shortly after the implementation of the reorganization
of the Office of Security on 1 August 1973, John Dempsey,
Chief, Research Branch, verbally discussed and reviewed
with Edwal Jones, Chief, Clearance Division, the disposition
of certain SRS functions still in the possession of the

HW 50955 DocId:32203889 Page 94

i
Research Branch, but recommended and approved for| transfer
to other components of the Office of Security. Among those
items discussed was "Special Access Source” Charles Wiley.
Messrs. Jones and Dempsey agreed that Wiley was not worth
the money spent, performed little or no useful service for
the Office of Security, and in fact had done little or
nothing to justify his keep. It was further agreed that
Mr. Jones would discuss Wiley and make known to the Deputy
Director of Security (PSI), Stanton Ense, the agreed assess-
ment of Wiley.

Mr. Jones next informed Mr. Dempsey that a memorandum
should be prepared reviewing the Wiley case, making recom-
mendations as to disposition. A memorandum was then pre-
pared by Louis Vasaly of the Research Branch, dated 18 Sep-
tember 1975, which recalled the history of Wiley's associa-
tion with the Office of Security with a recommendation for
termination. The only disagreement was as to timing.

Mr. Dempsey recommended 30 June 1974; Mr. Jones 1 February
1974, The Deputy. Director of Security (PSI) agreed with
the 1 February 1974 termination date and suggested using
tie Sanc p dure as in the Pennington case.

On 25 October 1973, Louis Vasaly and John Dempsey,
both of the Research Branch, met Wiley at the Key Bridge
Marriot Motel, Arlington, Virginia, to effect his termina-
tion. Wiley was most unhappy with the proceeding although
claiming to understand that budget problems and curtail-
ment of domestic activities lead to his separation. He
acknowledged that written notice of his termination by his
signature; however, he appended that the notice was "Signed
with the reservation that the terms will be appealed," and
stating he would seek redress either with the Director of
Central Intelligence or contacts on Capitol Hill.

Wiley was contacted twice more on 6 November 1973,
and on 12 February 1974, both times in New York City, by
Sidney Stembridge, Deputy Director of Security (P&M) and
Louis Vasaly. At the former meeting, Mr. Stembridge politely
explained to Wiley.that CIA is no longer engaged in matters
in which he had been assisting and that there was, there-
fore, no further need for his services. Mr. Stembridge
indicated that the Office of Security might be able to
assist financially in a limited sense beyond the (31 January
termination date, but that would be the limit of jany help.

On the latter occasion, Mr. Stembridge informed
Wiley that he had been awarded a termination bonus of
$4,000, which figure, in essence, represented his !salary
covered forward from 31 January through 30 June 1974. He
again objected to OS help, expressing dissatisfaction with
his termination, and rejected the terminal bonus.
Mr. Stembridge concluded the interview by reminding Wiley
that his termination was effective, previously executed
Secrecy Agreement was still binding and Mr. Stembtidge
would be available to him for additional assistance if
required, It was definitely made clear to Wiley that the
next action is to come from him.

An “information only" memorandum from the Director
of Security to the Director of Central Intelligence con-
cerning Wiley was sent on 25 February 1974.

CHARLES WILEY'S CONTACTS AND RELATIONSHIPS ' WITH
JAMES McCORD, LEE PENNINGTON, DONALD SWEANY AND HOWARD HUNT

7
|
JAMES McCORD

i
James McCord was the first peoresentarivelca the Office
of Security to have contact with Wiley and was undoubtedly
the driving force behind the Agency's funding of the Daily
Worker index. McCord was Wiley's primary case officer from
1956 through January 1962 and during this period, guided and
was more or less responsible for Wiley's direction and con-
trol,

The nature of McCord's contacts with Wiley after 1962
are not exactly known since McCord left SRS in January 1962
for other positions within the Office of Security. The files
do, however, contain the following information which indicate
some contact between McCord and Wiley after 1969. The exact
nature of these contacts is not definitely known, especially
those in May - June 1969; however, the presumption is that
Wiley at the direction of McCord may have reported on and
photographed anti-Viet Nam War demonstrations in Washington,
B. C., during t d and gave the results of his wosk to

McCord who re CIA on 31 August 1970.

On 30 May 1969, Cecil Tighe of SRS recorded, "Jim
McCord notified me today that Wiley would arrive in Washing-

“— ton, D. C., tonight for a meeting with McCord concerning

some Mayday Project that has been assigned to Wiley."

On 5S June 1969, Tighe recorded, "Wiley telephoned
from New York City on 4 June 1969 to request that I turn
over to Jim McCord the light meter which we drew from
Logistics for his use last month in connection with his
photography work. Wiley said that Jim McCord planned to
meet him in New York City over the week-end." Tighe then
called McCord's office and instructed them that Tighe had
the meter and it would be available in a package for trans-
mittal to Wiley if someone would come by and pick it up.
As of June 1969, no one had called or inquired further
into the matter.

5 On 6 June 1969, Tighe recorded that Jim McCord
@ , advised him on that date that he, McCord, had visited
+ Wiley in New York City on the 4th and Sth of June 1969.
McCord gave Tighe photographs from Wiley which had been
— "entrusted" to Wiley "many years ago" by Morse Allen:
The photograph had the following names on the back:
Vianamin Belitsky, Fred Borodin, Michel Reschal, and
Deak Zoltan.

Memorandum, dated 12 March 1970 by IA Cover
Employee states: "Wiley apparently had ceTEbi red Jim
McCord and at the end of their discussion, Wiley, or
McCord, had the call transferred to our number."

Memorandum, dated 6 April 1970 by CIA Cover
Employee to Chief, SRS states: "I received the attached
vouchers and an accounting from Wiley on Saturday. I note
that among other things, he spent over $120.00 on film.
Should this part of the accounting be referred to McCord,
or do we accept it as presented? It is not clear that it
meets Agency requirements, as all expenses are not matched
up by necessary receipts." :

A memvuraidut, Gated 14 Apeil 1970, capiionucd "Charics
Wiley" states: "Subject telephoned today after having

@ talked with Mr. McCord and advised that he had unfortunately
lost the race to be a Congressional candidate from his

district.”

McCord may also have been in contact with Wiley during
1970-71 concerning the monitoring of a book to be written
by CIA Covert Agent an ex-Communist and CIA source, who had
been involved in certain operations for this Agency (not
mentioned in the file)_in Mexico. The Agency was rather
concerned whether ¥12,C°V@tu1d expose his working for CIA
and assigned Wiley to help edit the book. The following
excerpts from the file tend to support the above contention:

A memorandum, dated 30 June 1970, captioned "Contact
Report, Charles Wiley," states: "Wiley further suggested
that, along with Jim Necerd, he continue to handle ClA Covert Agen
and would brief Agent so as to keep him content until he,
Wiley, returns from his European trip." (This very probably
refers to CIA Covert Agent, :

A memorandum, dated 13 January 1971 captioned "Charles
Wiley" states: "Says C14 Covert has stated that|he now
wants to leave in some material (Mexico) that earlier
McCord suggested Bee be included." (Apparently material
for book “Agen@’ Was writing with Wiley's assistance.)

A memorandum, dated 5S February 1971, captioned

outlines Wiley's problem with Ke Ge Veahe states: "Wiley

gether that dim impressed with face thac any mention of
the company or personnel by in his book would be at

In a memorandum, dated 19 February 1971, it is
reflected that Vasaly "had brief telephone conversation
with Wiley this p.m. He understood fromCIA exert that

A memorandum, dated 9 March 1971, captioned "Charles

Wiley" suggests Wiley intended to contact McCord regarding
CIA ter i 7

TBS vee Agenfatter in the near future.

A memorandum, dated 29 December 1971 records a con-
versation with Wiley concluding with the statement: "He
repeated his holiday greetings and was a little concerned
apparently that he hadn't had a card from McCord - wondered
if anything had happened to him, etc."

On 28 June 1972, Wiley telephoned Louis W. Vasaly of
SRS and remarked that he, Wiley, was really surprised at
the depth the FBI must be covering this, i.e., Watergate,
as he had already been approached and interviewed by a
couple of FBI agents based on several long distance calls
Jim, i.e., McCord, had made to him. Wiley further stated
he siuiy tele th ficol, FRI Tim was an oid Friend and
occasionally solicited intormation from Wiley, just as
the Bureau did.

On 9 April 1973, Wiley called Louis W. Vasaly to in-
form him that his wife, Tina, had taken her life. Wiley
suggested that Ruth and Jim McCord, Lee Pennington, Morse
Allen, Cliff Carrico and Paul Gaynor be advised. Mr. Vasaly
called Lee Pennington who in turn would advise Ruth McCord
on the afternoon of 9 April.

LEE PENNINGTON

The exact degree of Wiley's knowledge of and associa-
tion with Lee Pennington is not fully known from records
available in the Wiley file. However, it is known that
Pennington probably knew Wiley as early as 1954 from
Pennington's work with the Americanism Committee of the
American Legion and Wiley's index work on behalf of that
organization. Wiley has claimed on several occasions to

&é

have a close association with Pennington without; elaborating
as to specific details. For example: On March 1967, Wiley
prepared a report which states as follows - "In dealing with
Don (Sweaney) and Lee (Pennington), both of whom know of my
connection, I avoid any talk of my company activities.

At one time, both knew some of my work because we received
cooperation from them on certain projects. However, since
Don went to his present job there has been little contact.

I talk to Don as I do to everyone else. I ignore any
questions or statements with double meanings, surreptitious
glances, etc. This is because of two reasons - need-to-know
rule and Don is seldom out of earshot of fellow workers. No
one overhearing us will learn anything I don't want them to
know.

"Since the recent exposure of company activities is
the chief topic of discussion, and especially since I am
considered by many as an ‘expert’ on one of the projects,
there is little way of avoiding the subject without arousing
suspicion. I have always taken the same stand, that of a
critic - but with qualifications - regarding the area of
my knowledge. Under the circumstances, it would be quite

impossible to take any ether position. i

"During my discussion with Don, the only company
business that was mentioned was the project with which
everyone knows I am familiar. It is, therefore, obvious
that I could not have said what was reported. I would
suggest that someone other than the original source talk
to Don. I would also urge that both Don and Lee be reminded
not to mention, under any circumstances, their knowledge of
me."

DONALD SWEANY

Wiley's knowledge of and association with Sweany is
not fully known from the Wiley files, nor is there any
reference to any such association in the Office of Security
file on Donald Sweany. However, it can be presumed, based
upon their mutual association with Lee Pennington at the
American Legion, that they probably have known each other

since 1954. Other than Wiley's comment concerning Penning-
, ton and Sweany, previously mentioned, there is nothing else
* from Wiley concerning Sweany.

HOWARD HUNT

There is nothing in the Wiley files to indicate any
contact or association with Howard Hunt. Sometime prior to
24 August 1970 and probably between the fall of 1969 and
April 1970, Wiley provided SRS with a manuscript entitled
"Give Us This Day," which was circulating amongst some New
York publishers none of whom wished to publish it because
of its controversial nature, i.e. Bay of Pigs operation.
The writer of the manuscript was later identified as Howard
Hunt. The exact details concerning this incident are not
available in the Wiley files.

Further on this theme, on 19 June 1973, Wiley called
Louis Vasaly of SRS to say that he had in his hands a copy
of Howard Hunt's manuscript "Give Us This Day." Wiley was
advised that he had probably forgotten but that we had had
access to it several years ago when Hunt submitted it to

a different publisher. (Wiley reportedly had made it
@ available at that time). Wiley said that he believed that
this publisher was going to take advantage of the recent

publicity (meaning Watergate apparently) and, of course,
bring it out under Hunt's true name. Wiley was told that
we (SRS) had no interest in his copy and that he could
return it to the contact who made it available to him.
There was no further discussion on the matter.

The above is the extent of references to Howard Hunt
in the Wiley files.
