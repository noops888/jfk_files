FAIR PLAY FOR CUBA COMMITTEE

The April 6, 1960, edition of "The New York

the Fair Play for Cuba Committee (FPCC). This advertise-

and declared the FPCC intended to promulgate

; "the truth

about revolutionary Cuba" to neutralize the distorted

American press. u

"The New York Times" edition of January 11,

1961,' reported that at a hearing conducted before the

United States Senate Internal Security Subcommittee on

January 10, 1961, Dr. CHARLES A. SANTOS-BUCH identified

himself and ROBERT TABER as organizers of the FPCC. He

also testified he and TABER obtained funds from the Cuban

Government which were applied toward the cost of the afore-.

mentioned advertisement. U

On May 16, 1953; a source advised that during

the first two years of the FPCC's existence there was a

struggle between Communist Party (CP) and Socialist Workers

Party (SWP) elements to exert their power within the FPCC

and thereby influence FPCC policy. This source added that

during the past year there had been a successful effort by

FPCC leadership to minimize the role of these and other

organizations in the FPCe so that their influence as of

May, 1963, was negligible.

The SWP has been designated pursuant to

Executive Order 10450. U

On May 20, 1963, a second source advised that

VINCENT "TED" LEE, FPCC National Office Director, was then

formulating FPCC policy and had indicated that he had no

intention of permitting FPCC policy to be determined by

any other organization.

This source stated that LEE

believed that the FPCC should advocate resumption of

diplonatic relations between Cuba and the United States

and should support the right of Curans to manage their

revolution without interference from other nations.

LEE

dià nos advocate supporting the cuban revolution per se.

FATE PIAY FOR CUBA COMMITTEE

The November 23, 1963, edition of "The New Yolk

Times" reported that Senator THOMAS J. DODD of Connecticut

had called FPCC "the chief public relations instrument of

the CASIRO network in the United States."

It is to be noted

that Senator DODD was a member of the senate internal Security

subcommittee which twice conducted hearings on the FPCC.

The December 27: 1963, edition of "The New York

World Felegram and Sun" newspaper stated that the pro-

CASTRO FPOC was seeking to go out of business and that

its prime activity during its jifetime had been sponsor-

ship of pro-CASTRO street ralliee and nass picket lines,

and the direction of an active propegande mili nighlighting

illegal travel-to-Cuba canpaigns.

Ite comparatively brief

span of life was attributed to mounting anti-CASTRO American

public opinion, the 1962 Congressional hearings which dis-

closed FPCC financing by CASIRO's United Nations Delegation,

and ultimately; the bad publicity which the FPCC received

from disciosure of activities on 1ts behalf by suspecied

presidential assassin, LEE H. OSWALD.

on February 6, 1964, the previously mentioned

second source advised that v.

T. LEE had recently remarked

that the free was dead and that there were no plans to

organize another similar organization. U

On April 13, 1964, a third source advised that

there had not been any FPCC

activity in many months aud

that the FPCo had been dissolved.

Party (CP) member.

Times" newspaper contained a full-page advertisement

captioned "What Is Really Happening In Cuba," placed by

the Fair Play for Cuba Committee (FPCC). This advertise-

ment announced the formation of the FPCC in New York City

and declared the FPCC intended to promulgate

"the truth

about revolutionary Cuba" to neutralize the distorted

American press.

"The New York Times" edition of January 1l,

1961,' reported that at a hearing conducted before the

United States Senate Internal Security Subcommittee on

January 10, 1961, DE. CHARTES A. SANTOS-BUCH identified

himself and RÖBERT TABER as organizers of the FPCC. He

also testified he aná TABER obtained funds from the Cuban

Government which were applied toward the cost of the afore-.

mentioned

• advertisement.

On May 16, 1963, a source advised that during

the first two years of the FPCCis existence there was a

struggle between Communist Party (CP) and Socialist Workers

Party (SWP) elements to exert their power within the FPCC

and thereby influence FPCC policy.

This source added that

auring the past year there had been a successful effort by

FPCC leadership to minimize the role of these and other

organizations in the FPCC so that their influence as of

May, 1963, was negligible.

The SWP has heen designated pursuant to

Executive Order 10450.

On May 20, 1963, a second source advised that

VINCENT "TED" LEE, FPCC National Office Director,

was then

formulating FPCC policy and had indicated that he had no

intention of permitting FPCC policy to be determined by

any other organization. This source stated that Lit

belleved that the FPCC should advocate resumption of

diplomatic relations between Cuba and the United States

and should support the right of Curans to manage their

revolution without Interference from other nations.

LEE

did not advocate supporting the cuban revolution per se.

FATE PLAY FOR CUBA COMMUTEE

The Novemher 23, 1963, edition of "The New Yoik

Times" reported that Senator THOMAS J. DODD Of Connecticut

had called FPCO "the chief vublic relations inatrument of

the CASTPO network in the United States."

It is to be noted

that Senator DODD was a member of the Senate internal Security

Suhcommittee which twice conducted heurings on the FFCC.

The December 27, 1953, edition of "The New York:

World Telegram and Sun" newspaper stated that the pro-

CASTRO FPCC was seeking to go out of business and that

its prine activity during its lifetime had been sponsor-

ship of pro-CASIRO street rallies and inass picket lines,

and the direction of an active propaganda initi highlighting.

iblegal travel-to-cuba campaigns.

Its comparatively brief

span of life was attributed to mounting anti-CASTRO American

public opinion, the 1962 Congressional hearinga which dio-

closed FFCC financing by CASIRO e United Nations Delegation,

and ultimately: the bad publicity which the FPCC reccived

fron discosure of activities on its behalf ky suspected

presidential assassin, LED H. OSWALD.

On February 6, 1954, the previously menüloned

second source advised that V. T. LEE had recently remarked

that the PPec was dead and that there were no plans to

organize another similar organization.

On April 13, 1954, a thira source adulied that

there had not been any FICO activity in many months aid

that the FC had been dissoived.
