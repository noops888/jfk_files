The April 6, 1960, edition of "The New York’
Times" newspaper contained a full-page advertisement
captioned "What Is Really Happening In Cuba," placed by

ment announced the formation of the FPCC in New York City

‘about revolutionary Cuba" to neutralize the distorted
American ‘press. Ne :

i the New York Tiines" edition of January 11,

1961,‘ reported that at a hearing conducted before the

ig United States. Senate Internal Security Subcommittee on
January 10, “1961, . CHARLES A. SANTOS-BUCH identified
himself and ROBERT TABER as organizers of the FPCC. He
also testified he and TABER obtained funds from the Cuban
Government which were. applied toward the cost of the afore-
mentioned advertisement.

On hay 16, 1963, a source advised that during

the. first two years of the FFCC's existence there was a

struggle between Communist Party (CP) and Socialist Workers

Party (SWP) elements to exert their power within the FPCC

and thereby influence FPCC policy. This source added that

during the past year there had been a successful effort by
FPCC leadership to.minimize the role of these and other
" organizations in the FPCC ye their influence as of

May, 1963, Was negligible.

VINCENT "TED" LEE, FPCC National Office Director, was then

\ formulating FPCC policy and had indicated that he had no

h intention of permitting FPCC policy to. be determined by
any other organization, This source stated that LEE
believed that the’ FPCC should advocate resumption of

that Senator DODD was a meniber of the Senate internal Security
Subcommittee which twice conducted hearings on the FPCC. iw

The Lecember 27, 1963, edition of "The New Vork

-" World Telegram and Sun" newspaper stated that the pro-
CASTRO FROG was seeking to go ovt of business and that
its prime activity during its Jifetime had keen sponsor-
Ship of pro-CASTRO street ral
and the direction of an active prepegands mill
illegal travel-to-Cuba cainpaigns. rts comparatively brief
span of life was attributed to mounting anti-CASTRO American
public cpinion, the 19€2 Congressional hearings which dis-
closed FPCC financing by CASTRO’s- United Nations Delegation,
and ultimately, the bad publicity which tre FECC received

: from discicsure of activities on its behalf ty suspected

On February 6, 1964, the previously mentiobed H
second source advised that V. T, LEE had recently remarked

FAIR PLAY FOR CUBA Cot

The Novemher 23, 1963, edition of "The New York
Times" reported that Senator THOMAS J. DODD of Connecticut
had called FPCC "the chief public relations instrument of
the CASTRO network in the United States." It is to be noted
that Senator DODD was a member of the Senate internal Security
Subcommittee which twice conducted hearings on the FFCC.

The December 27, 1953, edition of "the New York
wc World Telegram and Sun" newspaper stated that the pro-
CASTRO FPCC was seeking to go out of business and that
its orime activity during its lifetime had been sponsor-~
ship of pro-CASTRO street rallies and wass picket lines,
and the direction of an active propaganda mili highlighting
illegal travel-to-Cuba campaigns. Its comparatively brief
span of life was attributed to mounting anti-CASTRO American
public epinion, the 1962 Congressional hearings which dis-
closed FFCC financing ty CASYRO’s United Nations Delegation,
and ultimately, the bad publicity which the FPCC received
from disclesure of activities on its behalf by pid gehaa
presidential assassin, LEE-H, OSWALD,

on February 6, 19 ou, the previously mentioned
second source advised that V. T, LEE had recently remarked
that the PPCC was dead and that tnere were no plans to
organize ‘another similar organization.

On April 13, 19 a third source advised that:
there had not been any PPCC activity in many months and .
that the FPCC had been dissoived. siesee
