Cognizant elements of the Department of Defense have made a thorough and

detailed search in an attempt to find records which might, relate to the

relevant operational procedures existing during the 1963 tine frame, a revi

of records of stored fi that might be applicable to your inquiry, and a

most records from this period no longer exist).

The Search efforts described above revealed no information relevant

to your request.

Sincerely,

JOHN G. KESTER

M/R: -On 8 November, Mr. Robert G. Blakey, Chief Counsel and Staff Director

for the House Select Committee on Assassinations, posed a number of questions to

NSA regarding a former Air Force enlisted man's allegation that he had intercepted

information linking an assassination plot against President Kennedy with a figure

in organized crime. Mr. Blakey subsequently submitted a written request (datad

15 November) to support his verbal one. _
In essense, the questions probed NSA's ability to quickly and thoroughly

probe for records from the Air Force site in Kirknewton, Scotland (USA-55,

now closed), for information relating to tne allegation.

G809 and N33 personnel reviewed both a listing of data and boxed records
from USA-55, but their efforts failed to reveal evidence of the alleged inc
The actual traffic from this period was minimal and no other records are extant.

ED SAPP, LAO, 3747s, 21Nov78, llr

The Director has approved.
