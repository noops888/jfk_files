& February 1965

Mr. Rastetters

When Nestor Sanches wont to see AMLASH-1 in Paris recently, I asked hin
to got LASH?s coments on Fidelts habits, mind, et cetera, LASH said that Fidel
is anything but "crazy" - far to the contrary. ASH could efte no examples of
“public peculiarities". For some months prior to LASH's departure for Europe in
mdid-Novenber 1964, Fidel had been taking very good care of himself. Ee hes
almost stepped drinking - he now drinks very little indeed. He no longer eate
as he used to - an enormous meal, simply enormous - and then perhaps nothing
for 24 hours. He eats a reasonable anount now, and with more normal frequency.
In addition, he is taking exorcises steadily. He also goes to the bosch at
Varadero every wookent, to swim ani skin dive, which he is very foni of.
