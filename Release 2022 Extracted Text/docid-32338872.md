EVIDENCE OF LL.

V BOF LANSON'S COMMUNIST PARTY MEMBERSHIP “SEGREL

As Direct £ Evidence of ¥ vembership

Testifying. before the Joint Fact-Finding Comnittee, California

. Legislature, in the fall of 1944, Lawson, under oath, denied that he was

a member of the Communist Party. However,.a highly reliable and delicate .
confidential source, whose reliability has been well established, but

whose admissibility in Court may be somewhat doubtful, has definitely
identified Lawson ds a member of the Communist Party for the last twelve
years. According:to this source, Lawson was first a member of Branch K

of the North West Section of the Los Angeles County Communist Party until
that branch was reorganized in June, 1943, at which time he was transferred
to Branch A-3 (writers! branch) of the North West Section and pene 1943
Communist Party Book #30198.

This very reliable source also stated that Lawson enrolled in
the Communist Political Association and was assigned 1944 CPA Card 41850,
and. on’ December 10, 1944, according to the source, was ‘again registered
for the CPA and was issued 1945 CPA Card 47275. In the Communist Political
Association, Lawson reportedly was assigned to the special group which

. was also ‘known as Group #9 and was a. member of. the commission which was

Soe

the governing body of the Communist movement in the motion picture industry-
which replaced the North West Section's Executive Committee. Lawson,
according to the source, served on the commission for three years.

It was further stated by this source that’ when the Communist 7
Party, USA, was reorganized to replace the Communist. Political Association,
Lawson was assigned to the Davis Club and was issued 1946 Communist Party
Book #35392. This source made available Lawson's 1946 registration card
which reflects that he was 50 years of age, a writer in the motion picture
industry, of American-Jewish descent, and that he had been in the Communist
Party for twelve years. This source has also identified Lawson's wife,

Sue Lawson, as a member of the Communist Party and is in a position to
document the branches to which she has belonged.

William Hynes (LA-3), a discontinued paid confidential informant
of the Los Angeles Office, has identified Lawson as a member of the Communist~
Party in 1941.and has stated that Lawson is-a "CP member, a playwright, and
the leader of the CP fraction among the artists of all varieties in Holly-

“ wood".

In a sworn statement which Rena Vale gave to the Joint Fact-
Finding Committee, California Legislature, more commonly known as the. Tenney

{ NW 64578 Docld:32338872 Page 3



‘Committee, she identified John Howard Lawson as‘ a member, of the Communist
Party. She stated that’ he was active in Communist circles in Hollywood. * +
when she was in the Communist Party and that in Communist meetings, Lawson
had stated that Communist. propaganda must be integrated into. all screen,
plays.

‘on August 8, 1944, Walter Wanger, a a Movie producer; stated that
he definitely knew that John Howard Lawson was a Communist. - This source
stated that a few days before he had contacted Lawson to see if he was
available to write a screen play to which Lawson replied he. was hesitant
to work for Wanger for fear it met cast some reflection ‘on a This
source au Laws jon as stating, "I ama Communist".

Joseph Nathaniel Earl, Confidential Informant of. the Los Angeles

Office, advised that he talked to John Howard Lawson on July 25, 1945, -at
which time Lawson stated that if he were called as a witness before the
State Un-American Activities Committee, he believed he would admit to them
that he was. a member of the Communist Political Association, Ww

On March 1, 1947, Ben Kadish, a confidential source of thé Los
-Angeles Office, and a former member of the Communist Party, ‘advised that
he recalled John Howard Lawson's attending Communist meetings. ‘This
source was in the Communist Party from September, 1943, through-December,
1945, and for a time was in Branch A-3, which was the same branch to “
which Lawson belonged.

B. * Attendance at Communist Party Meetings

“paring the time that Lawson has been in Ios Angeles, he has been
identifiéd as having attended numerous meetings at which all of those
identified as being present were known Communists, according to a highly -
reliable and: delicate confidential source. ‘In those cases where the highly
reliable and delicate confidential sovrce was not,in a position to iden-
tify the particular person as a Communist, the source that can so identify. a
the person is mentioned. There are set forth hereinafter several examples 7
‘of this character of meetings which Lawson attended.
t
e on February Dy 1943, Agents of the Bureau observed Alexander
Trachtenberg, head of International Publishers and a member of the National
Committee, Communist Party, USA, met with John Howard. Lawson, Albert Maltz

IIT. OTHER EVIDENCE OF BA

IST AFFILIATION

“In July, 1941, a memorandum was furnished to the Chicago Field
Office by Colonel Walter L. Furbershaw, a representative of the Carnegie

“ Tllinois Steel Company, which cited meetings of the National Committee

Plenary Sessions df the Communist Party on June 28 and 29, 1941, in New
York City. .It was stated in the memorandum that those definitely known to
have been present were William Z. Foster; James W. Ford; Alexander Bittel-

‘man and numerous other high ranking Communist leaders. The memo further

related that John Howard Lawson attended these national meetings as a dele-
gate from California and there is a notation to the effect that Lawson had.
been in New York for the previous few months in connection with theater work.”
-In October, 1941, Howard Emmett Rogers, c/o Metro: Goldwyn Mayer .
studios, Culver City, California, a temporary confidential national defense
informant of the Los Angelles Office, advised that John Howard Lawson was one
of the leading Communists in the United States. He stated that on an occasion
approximately four years previous, when he was at’ the Clover, Club in Holly-
wood, he met Lawson and drank with him during the evening. He said on this.
occasion Lawson talked of the purge that took place in Russia and the mass
slaughter of the Kulacks. The source advised that Lawson stated to -him that
he hoped the revolution would come here without bloodshed, but that it would
come "even with bloodshed if necessary". The same source stated that two
years following this incident, he attended a debate at the Roosevelt Hotel
in Hollywood where Lawson stated publicly that everything should be done to
avoid bloodshed and that under no circumstances should this country get into
war. Rogers related that he got on his feet at this meeting and recalled

- to Lawson his conversation concerning the, revolution referred to heretofor

and asked Lawson how he’could justify such an inconsistericy. Lawson, accord—
ing to the informant,: turned to the audience and stated that this was a
typical, example of Hollywood red- baiting and refused to answer the question

7 put to ) him.

7 On November 15, 1941, former confidential informant Harry J.
Pfalsgraff-of the Chicago Office, advised the Communist Party was in the

reorganizing its structural set-up. He said that District #13 was to
include all of the States of California and of Nevada. According to the
source it was to have centralized offices at 121 Haight Street, San Francisco,
and another at Los Angeles. The San Francisco Office was to be headed by
Steve Nelson. Further, Betty Garmett is the Organizational Secretary of
District #13 and John Howard Lawson and Herbert Biberman will control the .
organizational work in the Hollywood Area, according to the informant.

"T, read Hew Masses for two reasons: -first, because it is a une)

was in Chicago at this time, advised Abowitz that he would arrive in
Los Angeles by plane the following day and requested that she arrange
a conference for him with about five of the "right people". ‘Abowitz,
according to the source, immediately conferred with Carl Winter,
Executive Secretary ofthe Communist Political Association of los Angeles
County, concerning this matter. Subsequently a surveillance by Agents
of the Los Angeles Office reflected that this meeting was actually held
on Sunday, July 23, 1944, at the home of Hllenore Abowitz with six
people in attendance. These persons included, in addition to. R. W. Kenny,
Carl Winter, previously idemtified; Paul Cline, ex-Secretary of the A
Communist Party in Los Angeles County; Joseph Aidlin, member of the
State Central Committee of the Democratic Party in Los Angeles, and

_ John Howard Lawson. W : .

It was also reported-by this highly reliable source that in

June, 1945, Doretta Tarmon,. field representative of the New Masses, know
Communist publication, and Joe Foster,. film critic for the New Masses, came
to Los Angeles from New York City to organize New Masses Benefit Rallies.
It was stated that both of these individuals held conferences with John
Howard Lawson. According to the. source, an invitational benefit for the
New Masses was held at the home of Frank Tuttle, Movie Director, 6217
Rock Cliff Drive, Hollywood, on June 9, 1945, it being pointed out by
Manuel Seff, a confidential informant of the Los Angeles Office, that the
meeting was by invitation only; that over $3,000 was raised at the meeting
-and that John Howard Lawson was ore of those he recognized in attendance.

In August, 1945, a highly. reliable confidential source* reported
that Lawson has been working on a book of American history for the past
couple of years. The source stated that the book was in its final stages
and had been typed. into script and had been criticized by various people
including leaders of the Communist Political Association in Los Angeles,
among them, Carl Winter, head.of the’ Los Angeles CPA. The source also
said that inquiries concerning it had also been made by Alex Trachtenberg,
former National Educational Director of the Commnist Party, and currently
a member of the National Committee of the Commnist Party. The source in-.
dicated that since the change in the CP Line as a result of the Duclos
article, Lawson has indicated that he was going to take six months off
from his studio to revise the book, He also told the informant that the
change in the Commnist Party Line necessitated practically a complete
revision of the book's viewpoint. M0) i

7 7 Subsequently, a highly confidential source (technical surveillance. < :
‘ on residence of Bruce fanton) advised that Minton was very. bitter against
Lawson and had made it Imown that he was "out -to get Lawson''. This source
indicated that Minton was of the opinion’ that the CPA in Hollywood was a
closed corporation and that he had referred to Lawson as the.'trabbill of
this group who ran it as a "tin god and in a dictatorial fashion". Similar.
repercussions regarding Lawson were reported by Harvey Gilbert Wolf, a
confidential informant of the Los Angéles Office. Wolf advised that. on
August 1, 1945, he had occasion to talk with afriend who was a member of
one of the ealtural groups over which Lawson presided. He said.that this
person stated that the rank and file of the cultural groups were not
satisfied with the revisionistic policies which Lawson and Elizabeth Glenn
had followed during the previous year under the CPA set-up, and were
desirous of getting rid of Lawson and Glenn as leaders.. Wolf further
revealed that his informant definitely stated that Lawson was the leader 7
of the Communists in the cultural field and that he obtained the impression Ta
that HLizabeth Glenn was Lawson's underling in an organizational capacity.
Wolf, a former member of the CPA, stated his informant was very bitter
-against Lawson and Glenn, not from a personal standpoint but from a Marxist
standpoint inasmuch as Wolf's informant thought that Lawson and Glenn had
misled the rank and file CPA members by their leadership and adherence to
: the theory of- revisionism. [A practical example of what might have indicated
a tendency toward change of Commnist leadership in the motion picture industry
was reported by a highly confidential source who reported on July 19, 1945,
that Lawson had just returned from San Francisco and aditittedly had not been
included in ay inter-Party~ discussions of. the motion picture strike, it
being noted that the Communists, prior to the strike, had adhered to a
position of not aiding the strike and had urged its workers to keep the no-
strike policy of their unions. It is to be observed that in 1946.Richard ( Fin)

Bransten and his wife, Ruth McKenny, were expelled from the Commnist Party.J

: INDEPENDENT? CITIZENS COMMITTEE OF THE ARTS, SCTENCES AND
PROFESSIONS (HICCASP); succeeded by the PROGRESSIVE CITIZENS.

OF AMERICA AANA AER ERSTE SU SUEUR ESERESSE PSUS TAL AUT ERENT

Harvey Gilbert Wolf, a confidential informant of the los Angeles
Office, advised that the Hollywood Democratic Committee was launcked-in 7
January, 1943, by persons engaged in the motion picture industry, to obtain
national, state and local legislation essential to victory; to clarify -
political issues and support candidates best fitted to serve the nation in
wartime and to cooperate with other organizations "whose aims are similar
to our own"; housing for. defense’ workers, protection of labor's ‘rights,
child care, humane treatment of juvenile delinquents and the end of negro
discrimination. The same source stated on February 15, 1944, that the aims
and purposes and program of the Hollywood Democratic Committee had changed
very materially. He indicated that its purposes had formerly been exclusively
political, but that now through speeches, public advertisements and shan
Americanism, it was attempting to enlist the support of non-suspecting
citizens, under the guidance of the Committee, to exploit names of important
individuals in the furtherance of the Commnist Party line. This informant

not only parallel with that of the Communist Party Line but that the organ-
ization was dominated and inspired by persons of a Commnist character.

It is observed that in June, 1945, the Hollywood Democratic '
Committee became a section of the Independent: Citizens Committee of the
Arts, Sciences and Professions and that in 1946, it became known as the
Progressive Citizens of America. It should also be noted that this organ~
ization was not connected with the Democratic Party.

The following information with respect to the activities of
John Howard Lawson relative to the Hollywood Democratic Committee is set
forth to illustrate the direction and control exerted over this organiza—
tion by Lawson. The most pertinent information in this regard was re-
ported to the Bureau by a highly confidenti§] and reliable source, ae
On March 4, 1943, it was ascertained ty a confidential informant
of the Los Angeles Office, Harvey Gilbert Wolf, that the Hollywood Democratic

Committee was in its formative stages and a meeting of the group was scheduled
‘at the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel for that evening. This informant attended

the meeting and a written report. stated "before the. meeting began, the

_ following known Communists circulated among those preserit. They were
acknowledged by the audience generally which. for the most part, gathered
around them, chatted and passed remarks which would indicate that they

were well-lknow and ‘in a sense looked up to."- Among those named by the
informant as being in this category were: John Howard Lawson and Herbert
Biberman, together with other Hollywood Communists. The purpose of the ©
meeting reportedly was to elect officers for the ensuing year and to adopt

a constitution. According to the source, the Hollywood Democratic Com-
mittee "will undoubtedly develop into a powerful Communist Party pressure
group in the near future. Using the war effort and the influence of power—
ful figures in the motion picture industry, this organization will have a.
tremendous influence in putting over the Communi st: Party Line in California."
Further, the.source continued; the Hollywood Democratic Committee is definitely
a Communist "front" organization, and he asserted that John Howard Lawson
was among those proposed at this meeting to be considered for the Executive
Board. . Lawson, according to the: source, also was one of. the eight persons
who donated #25 at tne collection.during the evening (yy

: . On February 10, 1944, the same sourcé was present at a conference’.
between John Howard Lawson and Revels Cayton, Negro Vice President of the
California State CIO. According to the source, Cayton wanted Lawson to
get Walter Wanger, Motion Picture Producer, .to approach Helen Gahagan, wife
of Melvyn Douglas, screen actor, to run for Congress in the 15th Cc. D.

Lawson said he could not approach Wanger on it but that. George Pepper,
through the Hollywood Democratic Committee, could make the contact. This

was only one of many conferences held concerning possible Congressional and
State Legislature candidates, and on numerous: occasions Lawson's direction
and advice was sought by Hollywood Communists relative to possible candidates.

-In 1944, Harvey Gilbert Wolf, a confidential informant of the
Los Angeles Office, advised.that the entire organizational strength of the
Communist Party was being throwm into the local and national election cam-
paigns and that the Hollywood Communists, Party line followers and sympathizers |
were engaged in this type of activity.: He submitted the following report
with respect to the Hollywood Democratic Committee:

"The Hollywood Democratic Committee, which has no official con-
nection with the Democratic Party, but is the Communist front
organization which attempts to speak for the industry politically
and also for the Hollywood section generally, is raising the sum

that John Howard Lawson was named as a member of the counet «NIA

In August, 1945, a highly reliable informant* advised that
' Lawson was.continuing his leadership in the Hollywood Independent Citizens
Committee of the Arts, Sciences, and Professions. It was stated that

George Pepper, Executive Seoretary-of the organization, continually obtained
direction and, counsel from Lawson concerning the strategy and policy of the oe
group. . The source further remarked that Lawson had been very. active at this

: On August 11, 1945, the same reliable source advised that there
was some interest in having a State-wide meeting to amounce Carlson's

_ candidacy or at least to discuss it with the Democratic politicians from
‘all ovér California. However, Lawson, according to the source, said that
Philip Connelly, former President of the California State Industrial Union

Council, CIO, and a known Communi st Jaccording to Elsie Monjar, a confidential
informant of the Los Angeles Offic) was of the opinion that it was not time 7

yet as Ed Pauley, National Treasur@r of the Democratic Party and other

forces would try to maneuver to get control of this meeting. On August 11,

1945, the same highly reliable source advised that Lawson was to handle a
reception for Carlson to’ be given by Edward G. Robinson. It was-indicated
that the Warner Brothers, Motion Picture magnets and other "big wigs" were

to be in attendance at this reception. It was also indicated by this source ’
at the time that Orson Welles discussed with Lawson the chances of Carlson's

winning the election. It was sid that Welles promised Lawson all he could

to assist Carlson's candidacy, although of the personal opinion that Carlson

would be defeated.

aan On August 8, 1945, the highly reliable source* reported that the

. New York City organization of the Independent Citizens Committee of the Arts,

Seienc es and Professions had continually sought a closer Init organization
throughout the United States with a constitution, by-laws, in addition to~
representatives from various cities where branches were located. Lawson,

according to the source, subtly fought a close knit organization and desired

instead only the use of. the Independent Citizens Committee's name, being
of the opinion that the Hollywood Independent Citizens Committee should
otherwise remain autonomous. In a conference with Pete Iyons, an. employee

of the Independent Citizens Committee of the Arts, Sciences and close unit QC

of New York City, according to the source, Lawson stated that a close knit

organization was premature and could not be done without discussion which
discussion should be held at some time after the war. Lyon said the New
York Office needed more money and Lawson reiterated the Hollywood Committee
was very poor and did not desire to make any further comnittments at the
time. - Lyon was anxious that the HICCASP send someone to Washington or New
York to give Congressional leaders some tangible evidence of union between
the National organization and the Hollywood Committee, The source indicated
that Lawson agreed that this might be a good ney :

: On December 4, 1945, according to a highly reliable source*¥
the HICCASP held a rally, the theme of which was "Atomic Power and Foreign
Policy". The official announcements described this affair as an attempt to ~
make a realistic approach to the tremendous potentialities of atomic weapons
and atomic energy. This rally called for international use and inter-
national control of atomic energy, and in this connection, the reliable
informant pointed out that Lawson, through George Pepper, Executive Secretary -
of the HICCASP, carefully guided the program. It is interesting to dserve
that Ned Sparks, President of the Los Angeles County Commmist Party', accord-
ing to the informant, contacted Lawson regarding this program and stated.
that he felt more emphasis should be put upon American intervention in Chine
inasmich as that was the main part of the Communist line. Lawson reportedly
agreed to this and stated that he would contact George Pepper to see that :
American intervention in China was given appropriate attention at.this rally. (@%

A highly confidential source reported in September, 1946, that Lawson
continued to be active in the affairs of the HICCASP and according to this
‘source, he frequently conferred with its Executive Secretary, Alice Hunter;
in fact, this source stated that on July 31, 1946, Hunter contacted Lawson
and asked him if it was all right if the HICCASP issued a statement that they
were not under the influence of the Commnist Party. According to the .
informant, Lawson stated it would be all right if it were done "carefully
ny and correctly". This informant further indicated Lawson attends most of
the meetings of the Executive Council of the HICCASP and through close
liaison with Hunter, continued to exert an influential rule in the policy
of this organization. It ig noted that shortly thereafter the HICCASP merged :
with the Progressive Citizens of America, described as a Cowminist-dominated q
group by Harvey G. Wolf, a confidential informant of the Los Angeles Office. Y

According to articles pearing in Los Angeles newspapers the Holly-
wood Arts, Sciences and Professions Council of the Progressive Citizens of

B. HOLLYWOOD WRITERS MOBILIZATION

The Hollywood Writers Mobilization, according to Harvey Gilbert

Wolf, a confidential informant of the los Angeles Office, was formed very
soon after the attack on Pearl Harbor, December 7, 1941, and was established
by persons who were most active in the League of American Writers. Accord

. ing to information contained in reports of the Joint Fact-Finding Committee,
California Legislature, based on information developed in connection with
interviews conducted of Hollywood writers in October, 1944, the Hollywood
Writers Mobilization was under the control of the Commnists and had numerous
contacts to supply the pictures which are being released in the liberated
countries.

Confidential Informant Wolf advised that there-was a close connec-
tion existing between the League of American Writers and the Hollywood ~
Writers Mobilization.

The following data with respect to Lawson's connections with the |
Hollywood Writers Mobilization is set forth to illustrate the direction: and
control exerted over this organization by Lawson. [Most pertinent informa-
tion developed relative to Lawson's contr. f this group was obtainéd by a
highly reliable and confidential source Bul : 7 > .

In Warch, 1945, a highly confidential source* -advised:that there

recently had been a strong difference of opinion between Robert Riskin,
head of the Overseas Film Bureau; Office of War Information, New York, and
Philip Yunné, head of the Los Angeles OWI Film Bureau, and this difference
of. opinion was concerned with scripts which had been submitted by. the 7
Hollywood Writers Mobilization.’ This source indicated that Sidney Buchman,
Chairman of the Hollywood Writers Mobilization Editorial Board, discussed
this matter with John Howard Lawson. Buchman advised that he had conferred
with Riskin who informed him that Philip Dunne had gone overboard on the so~
called "contrived" films (films based on fiction or so-called dramatic in-
cidents). Dunne had apparently instructed the Hollywood Writers Mobilization
group that this was the type of film OWI desired to produce. Following
Dunne's instructions, according to the source, the Hollywood Writers Mobiliza- °°
.tion had gone ahead and done scripts of this type and as a result menyof the
scripts had been under fire by the New York Office of the OWL, where Riskin
was in charge. It was further pointed out that Riskin was strong for
documentary films since he felt a responsibility to the State Department,
and further that misrepresentations were bound to arise out of dramatic
incidents in the "contrived" films tms making them more "vulnerable. The
source stated that both Lawson and Buchman agreed that this controversy

between Dunne and Riskin would effect the Hollywood Writers Mobilization,

: which they control, since most of the scripts already completed would have

u to be redone. (a /
