II. EVIDENCE OF ,LAWSON'S COMUNIST PARTY MEMBERSHIP

SECREF

A: Direct Evidence of Membership

Testifying before the Joint Fact-Finding Comnittee, California

• Legislature, in the fall of 1944, Lawson, under oath, denied that he was

a member of the Communist Party.

However, a highly reliable and delicate

confidential source, whose reliability has been well established, but

whose admissibility in Court may be somewhat doubtful, has definitely

identified Lawson as a member of the Communist Party for the last twelve

years. According:to

this source, Lawson was first a member of Branch K

of the North West Section of the los Angeles County Communist Party until

that branch was reorganized in June, 1943, at which time he was transferred

to Branch A-3 (writers' branch) of the North West Section and held 1943

Communist Party Book #30198.

This very reliable source also stated that Lawson enrolled in

the Communist Political Association and was assigned 1944 CPA Card 41850,

and on December 10, 1944, according to the source, was again registered

for the CPA and vas issued 1945 CPA Card 47275. In the Communist Political

Association, Lawson reportedly was assigned to the special group which

was also known as Group #9 and was a member of the commission which was

the governing body of the Communist movement in the motion picture industry.

which replaced the North West Section's Executive Committee. Lawson,

according to the source, served on the commission for three years.

It was further stated by this source that when the Communist

Party, USA, was reorganized to replace the Communist. Political Association,,

Lawson was assigned to the Davis Club and was issued 1946 Communist Party

Book #35392.

• This source made available Lawson's 1946 registration card

which reflects that he was 50 years of age, a writer in the motion picture

industry, of American-Jewish descent, and that he had been in the Communist

Party for twelve years.

This source has also identified lawson's wife,

Sue lawson, as a member of the Communist Party and is in a position to

document the branches to which she has belonged.

William Hynes (IA-3), a discontinued paid confidential informant

of the Los Angeles Office, has identified Lawson as a member of the Communist.

Party in 1941 and has stated that Lawson is a "CP member, a playwright, and

the leader of the CP fraction among the artists of all varieties in Holly-

wood".

In a sworn statement which Rena Vale gave to the Joint Fact-

Finding Committee, California Legislature, more commonly known as the. Tenney

Committee, she identified John Howard Lawson as a member of the Communist

Party:

She stated that he was active in Communist circles in Hollywood

when she was in the Communist Party and that in fommunist meetings, Lawson

had stated that Communist propaganda must be integrated into. all screen.

plays.

On August 3, 1944, Walter Wanger, a Movie. Producer, stated that

he definitely knew that John Howard Lawson was a Communist. This source

stated that a few days before he had contacted Lawson to see if he was

available to write a screen play to which Lawson replied he was hesitant

to work for Wanger for fear it might cast some reflectión on him.

source quoted Lawson as stating, "I am a Communist".

Joseph Nathaniel Earl, Confidential Informant of the Los Angeles

office, advised that he talked to John Howard Lawson on July 25, 1945, at

which time Lawson stated that if he were called as a witness before the

State Un-American Activities Committee, he believed he would admito them

that he was a member of the communist Political Association. (C

On March 1, 1947, Ben Kadish, a confidential source

of the Los

• Angeles Office, and a former member of the Communist Party, advised that

he recalled John Howard Lawson's attending Communist meetings. This

source was in the Communist Party from September, 1943, through December,

1945, and for a time was in Branch A-3, which was the same branch to

which Lawson belonged.

B.

Attendance at Communist Party Meetings

During the time that Lawson has been in Los Angeles, he has been

identifiéd as having attended numerous meetings at which all of those

identified as being present were known Communists, according to a highly

reliable and delicate confidential source. In those cases where the highly

reliable and delicate confidential source was not, in a position to iden-

tify the particular person as a Communist, the source that can so identify

the person is mentioned.

There are set forth hereinafter several examples

of this character of meetings which Lawson attended.

On February 7, 1943, Agents of the Bureau observed Alexander

Trachtenberg, head of International Publishers and a member of the National

Committee, Conmunist Party, USA, net with John Howard Lawson, Albert Maltz

III. OTHER EVIDENCE OF LAWSON'S COMMUNIST AFFILIATION

In July, 1941, a memorandum was furnished to the Chicago Field.

Office by Colonel Walter L. Furbershaw, a representative of the Carnegie

Illinois Steel Company, which cited meetings of the National Committee

Plenary Sessions öf the Communist Party on June 28 and 29, 1941, in New

York City.. It was stated in the memorandum that those definitely known to

have been present were William Z. Foster; James W. Ford; Alexander Bittel-

man and numerous other high ranking Communist leaders.

The memo further

related that John Howard Lawson attended these national meetings as a dele-

gate from California and there is a notation to the effect that Lawson had

been in New York for the previous few months in connection with theater work.

• In October, 1941, Howard Emmett Rogers, c/o Metro Goldwyn Mayer.

Studios, Culver City, California, a temporary confidential national defense

informant of the Los Angeles Office, advised that John Howard Lawson

of the leading Communists in the United States. He stated that on an occasion•

approximately four years previous, when he was

at the Clover, Club in Holly-

wood, he met Lawson and drank with him during the evening.

He said on this

occasion Lawson talked of the purge that took place in Russia and the mass

slaughter of the Kulacks.

The source advised that Lawson stated to him that

he hoped the revolution would come here without bloodshed, but that it would

come "even with bloodshed if necessary". The same source stated that two

years following this

incident, he attended a debate at the Roosevelt Hotel

in Hollywood where Lawson stated publicly that everything should be done to

avoid bloodshed and that under no circumstances should this country get into

Rogers related that he got on his feet at this meeting and recalled

to Lawson his conversation concerning the, revolution referred to heretofor

and asked Lawson how he could justify such an inconsistercy. Lawson, accord-

ing to the informant, turned to the audience and stated that this was a

typical example of Hollywood red-baiting and refused to answer the question

put to him.

On November 15, 1941, former confidential informant Harry J.

Pfalsgraff of the Chicago Office, advised the Communist Party was in the

process of realigning its Districts throughout the country as well as

reorganizing its structúral set-up. He said that District #13 was to

include all of the States of California and of Nevada.

According to the

source it was to have centralized offices at 121 Haight Street, San Francisco,

and another at Los Angeles.

The San Francisco Office was to be headed by

Steve Nelson. Further, Betty Gannett is the Organizational Secretary of

District #13 and John Howard Lawson and Herbert Biberman will control the

organizational work in the Hollywood Area, according to the informant.

In December, 1941, Mr. Verne Tompkins, 71 Eggert Avenue, Metuchen,

New versey, publisher

of the Daily farmers' Ligest, stated that Kathryn Burke,

Shier Director of Courier operations, was the contact for the communist

Party in Mexico City and that she reported directly to Gale Sondergaard,

IV. GENERAL COMMUNIST ACTIVITIES

Hugo Speier, a confidential informant of the Denver Field Office,

advised that John Howard Lawson in 1941 was appointed co-leader with Herbert'

Biberman of the Communists in the intellectual.

and motion picture industry:

in the Hollywood area.

The November 9, 1943, issue of "New Masses" contained a full page

article announcing that John Howard Lawson had been made a member, of the

Board of Contributing Editors of New Masses.

This article quotes lawson

as saying the following with regard to this publication:

"I, read New Masses for two reasons:

first,

because it is a

valuable source of information; second, because it is equally

valuable for its editorial comment and

analysis.

Almost every

issue offers vital factual material which cannot be found, else-

where.

loday, as never before,

the American people want facts--

because they realize that the knowledge of facts is indispens-

able for winning

the war.

They are heartily sick of the corrup-

tion and distortion in much of the commercial press., New Masses

gives us facts, and it interprets facts in terms of a consistent

philosophy of democratic action and purpose.

I hope the magazine

can reach a much wider circle of readers because I am convinced

that a bigger circulation for this periodical will help us win

the war."

On January 13, 1944, an article appeared in the "Daily Worker" beneath

the photograph of John Howard Lawson in which he is quoted as stating:

"Greetings to the Daily Worker on your 20th Anniversary. As

I look back over the years,' it seems to me that the Daily

Worker has been consistently invalute as a source There rate

news and a journal of progressive informed opinion.

no other American newspaper which has done such a fine job in

effective news coverage and editorial service to the American

people and

the American nation.

"I hope the Daily Worker's circulation and influence will in-

crease tremendously. If it increases in proportion to its merit,

it will reach millions of people"

A highly confidential source (technical surveillance. or Carl

Winter, Executive Secretary of the Communist Political Association, Los

Angeles County) advised that on July 22, 1944, Robert W. Kenny, former

Attorney General. of the State of California and then Chairman of the Cal-:

ifornia delegation to the National Democratic Convention in Chicago,.com-

municated with Ellenore Abowitz, Assistant State Cio Legislative Director

and a known Communist Party member in the los Anseles área, Kenny, who (@) U)

was in Chicago at this time, advised Abowitz that he would arrive in

Los Angeles by plane the following day and requested that she arrange

a conference for him with about five of the "right people". Abowitz,

according to the source, inmediately conferred with Carl Winter,

Executive Secretary of the Communist Political Association of Los Angeles

County, concerning this matter.

Subsequently a surveillance by Agents

Los Angeles Office reflected that this meeting was actually held

on sunday, July 23, 1944, at the home of Ellenore Abowitz with six

people in

attendance.

These persons included, in addition to R. W. Kenny,

carl Winter, previously identifled; Paul cline, ex-secretary of the

Communist Party in Los Angeles County; Joseph Aidlin, member of the

State Central Cornittee of the Democratic Party in Los Angeles, and

John Howard Lawson. (4)(U)

It was also reported.by this highly reliable sourced that in

June, 1945, Doretta Tarnon, field representative of the New Masses, known

Communist publication, and Joe Foster, film critic for the New Masses, came

to Los Angeles from New York City to organize New Masses Benefit Rallies.

It was stated that both of these individuals held conferences with John

Howard Lawson. According to the source, an invitational benefit for the

New Masses was held at the home of Frank luttle, Movie Director, 6217

Rock Cliff Drive, Hollywood, on June 9, 1945, it being pointed out by

Manuel Seff, a confidential informant of the Los Angeles Office, that the

meeting was by invitation only; that over $3,000 was raised at the meeting

and that John Howard Lawson was one of those he recognized in attendance.

In August, 1945, a highly reliable confidential sourcer reported

that Lawson has been working on a book of American history for the past

couple of years.

The source stated that the book was in its final stages

and had been typed. into script and had been criticized by various people

including leaders of the Communist Political Association in Los Angeles,

among them, Carl Winter, head. of the Los Angeles OPA. The source also

said that inquiries concerning it had also been made by Alex Trachtenberg,

former National Educational Director of the Communist Party, and currently

a member of the National Committee of the Communist Party.

The source in-,

dicated that since the change in the CP Line as a result of the Duclos

article, Lawson has indicated that he was going to take six months off

from his studio to revise the book. He also told the informant that the

evaion of the books serpent Clu)

change in the Communist Party Line necessitated practically a complete

if cmical Surveillance on the residence of John Hoard Kanson. I (Ul

future expulsion at this time on controversial issues; this is

factional, rather than my response to published and broadcast

material. However I am also convinced that this was merely a

loose way of talking to impress me with your seriousness, of

which I was already impressed.

"Adding my personal regards, and the hope that not long from

now we shall all be members of a functioning, militant, Marxist-

Leninist vanguard party devoted to the interests of our nation,

the peace of the world, and the liberation of mankind.

"Yours sincerely."

Subsequently, a highly confidential source (technical surveillance.

on residence of Bruce Minton) advised that Minton was very. bitter against

Lawson and had made it known that he was "out to get Lawson". This source

indicated that Minton was of the opinion that the CPA in Hollywood was a

closed corporation and that he had referred to Lawson as the "rabbi" of

this group who ran it as a "tin god and in a dictatorial fashion". Similar

repercussions regarding Lawson were reported by Harvey Gilbert Wolf, a

confidential informant of the Los Angeles Office.

Wolf advised that on

August 1, 1945

he had occasion to talk with a friend who was a member of

one of the cultural groups over which Lawson presided.

He said that this

person stated that the rank and file of the cultural groups were not

satisfied with the revisionistic policies which Lawson and Elizabeth Glenn

had followed during the previous year under the CPA set-up, and were

desi rous of getting rid of Lawson and Glenn as leaders. Wolf further

revéaled that his informant definitely stated that Lawson was the leader

of the Communists in the cultural field and that he obtained the impression

that Elizabeth Glenn was Lawson's underling in an organizational capacity.

Wolf, a former member of the CPA, stated his informant was very bitter

against Lawson and Glenn, not from a personal standpoint but from a Marxist

standpoint inasmuch as Wolf's informant thought that Lawson and Glenn had

misled the rank and file CPA members by their leadership and adherence to

the theory of revisionism. A practical example of what might have indicated

a tendency toward change of Communist leadership in the motion picture industry

was reported by a highly confidential source* who reported on July 19, 1945,

that Lawson had just returned from San Francisco and admittedly had not been

included in ary inter-Party discussions of the motion picture strike, it

being noted that the Communists, prior to the strike, had adhered to a

position of not aiding the strike and had urged its workers to keep the no-

strike policy of their unions.

ORGANTZATIONAL ACTIVITIES

Ao

HOLLYWOOD DEVOCRATIC COMMITTEE, later known as the HOLLYWOOD

INDEPENDENT CITIZENS COMMITTEE OF THE ARTS, SCIENCES AND

PROFESSIONS (HICCASP), succeeded by the PROGRESSIVE CITIZENS

OF AMERICA

Harvey Gilbert Wolf, a confidential informant of the los Angeles

office, advised that the Hollywood Democratic Committee was launched in

January, 1943, by persons engagea in the motion picture industry, to obtain

national, state and local legislation essential to victory; to clarily

political issues and support candidates best fitted to serve the nation in

wartime and to cooperate with other organizations "whose aims are similar

to our own"; housing for defense workers, protection of labor's rights,

child care, humane treatment of juvenile delinquents and the end of negro

discrimination.

The same source stated on February 15, 1944, that the aims

and purposes and program of the Hollywood Democratic.Committee had changed

very materially. He indicated that its purposes had formerly been exclusively

political, but that now through speeches, public advertisements and sham

Americanism, it was attempting to enlist the support of non-suspecting

citizens, under the guidance of the Committee, to exploit names of important

individuals in the furtherance of the Commnist Party line.

This informant

further stated that the program of the Hollywood Democratic Committee was

not only parallel with that of the Communist Party Line but that the organ-

ization was dominated and inspired by persons of a Communist character.

It is observed that in June, 1945, the Hollywood Democratic

Committee became a section of the Independent Citizens Committee of the

Arts, Sciences and Professions and that in 1946, it became known as the

Progressive Citizens of America. It should also be noted that this organ-

ization was not connected with the Democratic Party.

The following information with respect to the activities of

John Howard Lawson relative to the Hollywood Democratic Committee is set

forth to illustrate the direction and control exerted over this organiza-

tion by Lawson. The most pertinent information in this regard was re-

ported to the Bureau by a highly confidentiäl and reliable sources.

On March 4, 1943, it was ascertained by a confidential informant

of the Los Angeles Office,

Harvey Gilbert Wolf, that the Hollywood Democratic

Cormittee was in its formative stages and a meeting of the group was scheduled

at the Hollymood Roosevelt Hotel for that evening. This informant attended (AUl

the meeting and a written report stated "before the meeting began; the

following known Communists circulated among those present.

They were

acknowledged by the audience generally which for the most part,

gathered

around them, chatted and passed remarks which would indicate that they

were well-known and

in a sense looked up to." - Among those named by the

informant as being in this category were: John Howard Lawson and Herbert

Biberman, together with other Hollywood Communists. The purpose of the

meeting reportedly was to elect officers for the ensuing year and to adopt

• a constitution.

According to the source, the Hollywood Democratic Com-

mittee "will undoubtedly develop into a powerful Communist Party pressure

group in the near future. Using the war effort and he influence of power-

ful figures in the motion picture industry, this organization will have a

tremendous influence in putting over the Cormunist Party Line in California."

Further,

the source continued; the Hollywood Democratic Committee is definitely

a Communist "front" organization, and he asserted that John Howard Lawson

was among those proposed at this meeting to be considered for the Executive

Board:

Lawson, according to the source, also was one of the eight persons

who donated $25 at the collection auring

the evening

1(U)

On February 10, 1944, the same sourcé was present at a conference

between John Howard Lawson and

Revels Cayton, Negro Vice President of the

California State CIO.

According to the source, Cayton wanted Lawson to

In 1944, Harvey Gilbert Wolf, a contidential informant of the

Communist Party was being thrown into the local and national election cam-

paigns and that the Hollywood Communists, Party line followers and sympathizers

were engaged in this type of activity. He submitted the following report

with

In August, 1945, a highly reliable informants advised that

Lawson was continuing his leadership in the Hollywood Independent Citizens

Committee of the Arts, Sciences, and Professions.

It was stated that

George Pepper, Executive Secretary of the organization, continually obtained

direction and, counsel from Lawson concerning the strategy and policy of the

group.. The source further remarked that Lawson had been very active at this

time in building up the late General Evans F. Carlson, USMC, as a possible

candidate for U.S. Senator on the Democratic Ticket to fill the seat vacated.

by the late Senator Hiram Johnson.

On August 11, 1945, the same reliable source advised that there

was some interest in having a State-wide meeting to announce Carlson's

candidacy or at least to discuss it with the Democratic politicians from

all over California. However, Lawson, according to the source, said that

1945, the same highly reliable source advised that Lawson was to handle a

reception for Carlson to be given by Edward G. Robinson. It was indicated

that the Warner Brothers, Motion Picture magnets and other "big wigs" were

to be in attendance at this reception. It was also indicated by this source

representatives from various cities where branches were located. Lawson,

according to the source, subtly fought a close knit organization and desired

instead only the use of. the Independent Citizens Comnittee's name, being

of the opinion that the Hollywood Independent Citizens Committee should

otherwise remain autonomous. In a conference with Pete Lyons, an employee

of the Independent Citizens Committee of the Arts, Sciences and Professions

of New York City, according to the source, Lawson stated that a close knit

organization was premature and could not be done without discussion which

discussion should be held at some time after the war. Lyon said the New

Jork Office needed more money and Lawson reiterated the Hollywood Committee

was very poor and did not desire to make any further comnittments at the

time. Lyon was anxious that the HICCASP send someone to Washington or New

York to give Congressional leaders some tangible evidence of union between

the National organization and the Hollywood Committee

The source indicated

that Lawson agreed that this might be a good thing.

On December 4, 1945, according to a highly reliable source*

the HICCASP held a rally, the theme of which was "Atomic Power and Foreign

Policy". The official announcements described this affair as an attempt to

make a realistic approach to the tremendous potentialities of atomic weapons

and atomic energy.

This rally called for international use and inter-

national control of atomic energy, and in this connection, the reliable

intormant pointed out that Lawson, through leorge fepper, Executive Secretary -

of the HICCASP, carefully guided the program.

It is interesting to doserve

that Ned Sparks, President of the Los Angeles County Communist Party, accord-

ing to the informant, contacted Lawson regarding this program and stated

that he felt more emphasis should be put upon American intervention in China

inasmich as that was the main part of the Communist line.. Lawson reportedly

agreed to this and stated that he would contact George Pepper to see that

American intervention in China was given appropriate attention at this rally.

A highly confidential sources reported in September, 1946, that Lawson

continued to be active in the affairs of the HICCASP and according to this

source, he frequently conferred with its Executive Secretary, Alice Hunter;

In fact, this source stated that on July 31, 1946, Hunter contacted Lawson

and asked him if it was all right if the HICCASP issued a statement that they

were not under the influence of the Communist Party.

According to the

informant, Lawson stated it would be all right if it were done "carefully

and correctly.

This informant further indicated Lawson attends most of

the meetings of the Executive Council of the HICCASP and through close

liaison with Hunter, continued to exert an influential mle in the policy

of this organization.

It is noted that shortly thereafter the HICCASP merged

with the Progressive Citizens of America, described as a Comminist-dominated

group by Harvey G. Wolf, a confidential informant of the Los Angeles Office.

According to articlesapearing in Los Angeles newspapers the Holly-

HOLLYWOOD WRITERS NOBILIZATION

The Hollywood Writers Mobilization, according to Harvey Gilbert

Wolf, a confidential informant of the los Angeles Office, was formed very

soon after the attack on Pearl Harbor, December 7, 1941, and was established

by persons who were most active in the League of American Writers. Accord-

ing to information contained in reports of the joint Fact-Finding Committee,

Calitornia Legislature, based on information developed in connection with

interviews conducted of Hollywood writers in October, 194k, the Hollywood

Writers Mobilization was under the control of the Communists and had numerous

contacts to supply the pictures which are being released in the liberated

countries.

Confidential Informant Wolf advised that there was a close connec-

tion existing between the League of American Writers and the Hollywood

Writers Mobilization.

The following data with respect to Lawson's connections with the

ollywood writers Mobilization is set forth to illustrate the direction an

control exerted over this organization by Lawson. Most pertinent informa-

tion developed relative to Lawson's control

In March, 1945, a highly confidential sources advised that there

recently had been a strong difference of opinion between Robert Riskin,

head of the Overseas Film Bureau; Office of War Information, New York, and

Philip Dunné, head of the Los Angeles OWI Film Bureau, and this difference

of opinion was concerned with scripts which had been submitted by the

Hollywood Writers Mobilization.

This source indicated that Sidney Buchman,

Chairman of the Hollywood Writers Mobilization Editorial Board, discussed

Buchman advised that he had conferrec

with Riskin who informed him that Philip Dunne had gone overboard on the so-

called "contrived" films (films based on fiction or so-called dramatic in-

cidents). Dunne had apparently instructed the Hollywood Writers Mobilization

group that this was the type of film OWI desired to produce.

Following

Dunne's instructions, according to the source, the Hollywood Writers Mobiliza-

tion had gone ahead and done scripts of this type and as a result manyof the

scripts had been under fire by the New York Office of the OWI, where Riskin

was in charge.

It was further pointed out that Riskin was strong for

documentary films since he felt a responsibility to the State Department,

and further that misrepresentations were bound to arise out of dramatic

incidents in the "contrived" films thus making them more "vulnerable".

The

source stated that both Lawson and Buchman agreed that this controversy

between Dunne and Riskin would effect the Hollywood Writers Mobilization,

which they control, since most of the scripts already completed would have

to be redone.

to repay this money to him.

During the same period, the same source was

present when Lawson conferred with Waldo Salt, Communist screen writer,

regarding ways and means of raising $5,000 for the benefit of the People's

Educational Center.

Lawson also advised this informant that he was planning

to take a hand in the reorganization of the staff of the People's Educa-

tional Center, commenting that he did

not think that the personnel was

organized in the most effective way.

According to a pamphlet issued by the Ios Angeles Workers School,

John Howard Lawson, together with Albert Waltz and other invited lecturers,

were to be the instructors at the course entitled "The American Democratic

Tradition", an eight week course, tuition $3.

The course was to be given

at the Unitarian Church, 2936 West 8th Street, Los Angeles.

Of all the

courses taught at the Workers School, according to this pamphlet, this was

the only one not being taught at the

Workers School proper, located at 212

West 3rd Street, Los Angeles.

This course, according to the booklet, "will

be a lecture course dealing with decisive periods in the history of our

nation; the democratic conditions throughout the development of our people.

Beginning with the colonial period, the course will trace the growth, problems

and developments of the American tradition during the period of the Civil War

and reconstruction; it will deal also with the agrarian populist movement,

the First World War and the present war for national survival". It is to be

noted that this is not the same course that was given by Lawson at the school

for the League of American Writers entitled "Our Democratic Heritage". The Los

Angeles Workers School, founded in 1939, according to the pamphlet, bases its

studies on the various

teachings "in social science.. Marxism... the theory anc

practice of the working class and the people's movement throughout history".

The entire Board of Directors of the Workers School are Communists, according

to a confidential informant, Harvey Gilbert Wolf, who also indicated that .

In Boston for picketing the State Capitol.

With regard to this self-admitted

arrest of Lawson, the informant stated that lawson became a labor agitator

criminal libel growing out of an article which was written by Lawson in the

"Daily Worker", New York City Conmunist newspaper, defending a Communist

organizer, Harold Rolston.

It is observed that Lawson's FBI number is

3021790 and that his record in this regard reflects that he was arrested in

Birmingham on May 17, 1934, by the Birmingham Police Department on the charge

of being a Communist. He was released on the same day.

Officer Harless of the Birmingham Police Department related the

following information with regard to the arrest of Lawson in Birmingham,

Alabama, May 17, 1934. Harless said that he recalled that the police broke

up a Communist meeting at which Lawson was present and that Lawson was then

turned over to Officer J. I. Moser and Officer P. C. Cole who were handling

Communist matters at the time for the Birmingham Police Departnent. In

this connection Captain C. I. Mullens of the Birmingham Police Department

stated that Lawson was defended by a lawyer named Harold Ralston from New York.

He also recalled that a woman named Jane Speed, a well-known Communist

organizer, was also present at the meeting at which Lawson was arrested. The

records of the Birmingham Police Department further revealed the following

information regarding Alexander E. Rascolin, reportedly also arrested with

Lawson:

"This man is an International Labor Defense Attorney from New York

City. He was very active in 1934 and 1935 in Birmingham and was arrested by

the Birmingham Police on May 17, 1934. While in Birmingham, he contacted

several lawyers in an effort to

secure their services in reading parts of

the International Labor Defense.

This man is very high in the Communist Party.

His Birmingham police number is WM-26589".

The New York Times morgue contained two articles regarding the

arrest of Lawson at Birmingham, Alabama.

The first article dated July 6,

1934, reflected that Lawson was arrested on that date and released under bond

of $300 to appear in Recorder's Court the following day. The arrest followed

II. EVIDENCE OF LAWSONS COMMUNIST PARTY HXMBERSHIP

d. Direct Bridence of Membership

Pestifying before the Joint Fact-Finding Committee, California

Legislature, in the fall of 194, Larson, under oath, denied that he was

a member of the Commnist Party. However, a highly reliable and delicate.

confidential source, whose reliability has been well established,

but

whose adnissibility in Court may be sonewhat doubtful, has definitely

identified Larson as a member of the Communist Party for the last tuelve

years.

according to this source, Lawson was first a member, of' Branch K

of the North West Section of the Los Angeles County Comunist Party until

that branch was reorganized in June, 1943, at which time he was transferred

to Branch A-3 (writers branch) of the North West. Section and' held 1943

Commnist Party Book 430198.

This very reliable source also stated that Lawson enrolled in

the Corminist Political Association and was assigned 1944 GPA Card 41850,

and on December 10, 1944, according to the source, was pgain registered

for the CPA and was issued 1945 CPA Card 47275. In the Cornist Political

Association, Lawson reportedly was assigned to the special group which

Harvey Cilbert Wolf, a confidential informant of the los Angeles

Office, advised that the Hollywood Decratic Committee was launched in

January, 1943, by persons engaged in the motion picture industry, to obtain

national, state and local legislation essential to victorys to clarily

• political issues and support candidates best fitted to serve the nation in

wartime and to cooperate with other organizations "whose aims are similar

to our on"; housing for defense workers, protection of labor's rights;

child care, humane treatment of juvenile delinquents and the end of negro

discrimination.

The same source stated on February 15, 19W, that the eins

and purposes and program of the Hollywood Democratic Committee had changed

very materially. He indicated that its purposes had formerly been exclusively

but that now through speeches, public advervisements and shau

individuals in the furtherance of the Communist Party line.

This informant

further stated that the program of the Hollywood Denocratic Committee was

not only parallel with that of the Communist Party Line but that the organ-

Ization was dominated and inspired by persons of a Communist character

It is observed that in June, 1945,

the Hollywood Democratic

Committee became a section of the Independent Citisens Committee of the

Arts, Sciences and Professions and that in 1946, it became known as the

Progressive Citizens of America, It should also be noted that this organ-

ization was not connected with the Democratic Party. (100-197270-2)

the meeting and a written report stated "before the meeting began, the

following known Communists circulated among those present.. They were

acknowledged by the audience generally which for the most part, gathered

around them, chatted and passed remarks which would indicate that they

were well-known and in a sense looked up to."

Among those naned by the

informant as being in this category were:

John Howard Lawson and Herbert

Biberan, together with other Hollywood Conmunists. The purpose of the

neeting reportedly was to elect officers for the ensuing year and to adopt

a constitution. According to the source, the Hollywood Democratic Cón-

mittee "will undoubtedly develop into a powerful Connunist Party pressure

group in the near future. Using the var effort and the influence of power

ful figures in the motion picture industry, this organization will have a

tremendous influence in putting over the Comunist Party Line in Califomia."

Further, the source continued, the Hollywood Democratic Committee is definitely

a Communist "front" organization, and he asserted that John Howard Lawson

was among those proposed at this meeting to be considered for the Executive

Board. Lawson, according to the source, also was one of the eight persons

who donated $25 at the collection during the evening.

On August Il, 1945, the same reliable source advised that there

was some interest in having a State-ride meeting to amounce Carlson's

candidacy or at least to discuss it with the Democratie politicians from

all over California. However, Lawson, according to the source, said that

Philip Connelly, former President Of the California State Industrial Union

council, Gil, and a mown vommunist according to Elsie Monjar, a confidentia

intornant of the los angeles Office,]was of the opinion that it was not time

The Hollywood Writers Mobilization, according to Harvey Gilbert

Wolf, a confidential informant of the los Angeles Office, was formed very

soon after the attack on Pearl Harbor,

Dacember 7, 1942, and was established

by persons sho were most active in the League of American Writers.

Accorde

ing to information contained in reports of the Joint Fact-Finding Committee,

Califomia Legislature, based on information developed in connection tith

interviews conducted of Hollywood writers in October, I94l, the Hollywood

Writers Mobilization was under the control of the Commnists and had numerous

contacts to supply the pictures which are baing released in the liberated

countries.

(100-102216 14)

Confidential Informant Wolf advised that there was a close connec

tion existing between the league of American Writers and the Hollywood

Writers Mobilization.

The following data with respect to Lawson's connections with the

Hollywood friters Mobilization is set forth to illystrate the direction ano

control exerted over this organization by Lawson. Lost pertinent informa-

tion developed relative to Lawson's contrel of this group was obtained by a

highly reliable and confidential sources.

recently had been a strong difference of opinion between Robert Riskin,

head of the Overseas Film Buresu, Office of War Information,

New Tork, and

Philip Punne, head of the Los Angeles OwI fi Im Bureau, and this difference

of opinion was concerned with scripts which had been submitted by the

Hollywood Writers Mobilization.

This source indicated that Sidney Buchman,

Chairnan: Of the Hollywood Writers Mobilization Editorial Board, discussed

this matter with John Howard Lawson. Buchnan advised that he had conferred

with Riskin who informed him that Philip Dunne had gone overboard on the so-

called "contrived" films (films based on fiction or so-called dramatic in-

cidents).. Dunse had apparently instructed the Hollywood Writers Mobilization

group that this was the type of film owl desired to produce. Following

Dunne's instructions, according to the source,

the Hollywood Writers Mobiliza-

tion had gone ahead and done scripts of this type and as a result my of the

scripts had been under fire by the New Tork Office of the OVI, There Riskin

was in charge.

It was further pointed out that Riskin was strong for

docusentary films since he felt a responsibility to the State Department,

and further that nisrepresentations vere bound to arise out of dramatic

incidents in the "contrived" films thus making them more "vulnerable".

the

source stated that. both Lawson and Buchman agreed that this controversy

batween Dunne and Riskin would effect the Bollywood Writers Mobilization,

which they control, since most of the scripts already completed would have
