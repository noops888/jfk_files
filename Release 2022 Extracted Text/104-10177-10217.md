Branch pulls down their dinner trays and apreads out
a pile of notes and news clippings. Then he pulls out a
potice mug shot. “Meet Orlundo Bosch,” he says.
Rothchild stares incredulously at a porcine Cuban
aan with a thin moustache and thick lips “He looks
like the headmaster of a military school.” :
_"T know,” Branch says, "but he's a hitter. He's'also

"ing where to begin. “It would tate all night to go -
through what I've heard about Boseb, so I'l get you. *
ug to Letelier’as quick ‘as I can ‘for néw. The’ back-
* ground is simple: Bosch has been a political terrorist—
++ «that they call an action inan—ever since the late For-
‘ ties in Cuba, He worked for Castro, then for the G.LA.,
and then he denounced thé C.I.A. He has been an anti-
astro outlaw since the mid-Sixties, always telling the
Miamt Cubais not to trust the CLA. ia theif war
against Castro, Now most of the hard-line Cubans bé-
lieve him, Bosch ia the patriarch of Cuban terroriam.”
Branch patises, then ‘flips briskly through the clip-
pings. “Bosch got arrested and indicted pretty regular-
Jy all through the Sixties. He usually got o%. The wit-
nesses against him tended to sweat a Jot and forget
things on the stand, if they even showed up. In gen-
eral, Bosch had a threefold operation: first, political
terror against Castro sympathizers; second, ordinary
erimies like extortion from rich people and companies
to finance the political terror; and third, atl kinds of
‘wars and feuds with his terrorist rivals. Firstly, Bosch

a lot of trouble to seal us off from

that he would do it just deeause we
