His general business reputation is good but it appears
that his business is not very sound. His business was
incorporated on 21 January 1958, He is President and
70 shares of stock and his wife is Vice-President,
owning 10 shares, The Secretary-Treasurer at the time
of incorporation was Joseph A. OSTER who owns 20 shares.
A Dun and Bradstreet report reflected that Guy B---=
hired one investigator, Vernon GERDES, and the company
was not a financial success.’ A lien has been placed.
on the ‘company and NSF (not. sufficient funds) checks
have been returned. Four confidential informants were
interviewed. They advised Guy B---~ was suspended from
his position as Assistant Superintendent of the New Or~
leans Police Department because he was involved in a
downtown bar incident, He was accused of being drunk
and of pulling a gun in public, There were many con-
flicting stories and favorable and derogatory newspaper
articles pertaining to the incident. Guy B-~-----'s

DAYRIES,.. Superintendent
‘the purpose of clean-

od reputation as an
‘department until*he got himself in
asin March.1957. /At that time he
starting ‘a fight in.e New Or-

incident which received a great deal pf publicity in the news-
papers. Many conflicting stories were circulated about this

incident. One was that the Police Department had framed, or

railroaded, the SUBJECT in order to get rid of him because he
was getting too close to the top men who were responsible for
the fraft and corruption in the New Orleans Police Department.
The New Orleans Crime Commission defended the SUBJECT as did
many other prominent groups in the area, Newspaper articles
relating to the incident carried many’ conflicting stories of —~
witnesses. One story was that the SUBJECT had been drinking
and had at least. been indiscreet in handling the incident
which arose, ‘Since the SUBJECT was a prominent police official
with a job requiring a great deal of tact and discretion, it
was hard to believe that’ a person in his position, if he had
been sober, would have caused the adverse publicity which he
received. Z

II-17 stated that after SUBJECT was suspended from the

Police Department he purchased a newspaper, the Herald, a weekly
paper published in Gretna, Louisiana, which he ran for over a”
year. When he was its owner the newspaper and the SUBJECT were

principal stockholders, Lewis J. ROUSSEL. This alleged
famation agkinst—the-SUBJECE .received.a great deal of
notoriety’ “in’the local newspapers. (See attached Exhibit Cel,
‘PF a ‘newspaper article from fhe Times-Picayune,. New Or-

Tort siana, which reports the acquittal, of SUBJECT

_ for over a year it was

” believed SUBJECT had to sell it because of financial .

_ LET ulties. After selling the’ paper he started his”
stiigative agency which bore his name, ‘and at the
pres , time it is believed he is operating this agency, |
From newspaper articles LI-17 had the impression that this
business, run by SUBJECT, might not be completely succedful.

: tecent years SUBJECT has associated hingele” th.
Kent COURTNEY, editot of the Independent American, ‘a

national publication which represents States Rights and
which is extremely right wing.in policy and appears to be
dedicated to the proposition of preserving white supremacy .
In the course of its prommlgation of extreme views it has
used many unethical means, II~}? stated that the people
who have been connected with this Independent American

have criticised the Supreme Court to the point of demanding H
that all of the Justices resign because they were unethical, i
II-17 advised that this organization, known as the Independent ‘

American Citizens' Council, is militantly against desegragation,

I-17 stated he did not know in what capacity SUBJECT was connected

with this organization. LI-17 had seen the SUBJECT at many of

their meetings and for all he knew SUBJECT might have been hired .
by them to conduct investigations for them, if baa

I-17 stated ever since SUBJECT has had some connection
with this extremely right-wing radical group people have be~
come concerned about whether,or not he would use information,
gained when he was with the Na Orleans Police Department, to
further the cause of this right-wing element.

Another person SUBJECT has associated himself with is
Leander PEREZ, District Attorney for the Plaquemine Parish.
This individual is extremely right wing in his. political
thinking and has sufficient power that he can dictate whether
or not a person can vote. It is a known fact that he has
denied the negroes in his parish the right to vote.

“over twenty years, and.
oy male it easy for one to.

When first took over his duties at the Police {
Department he’ ‘proved. to be a capable administrator and he i
instituted many procédures which were beneficial to the i
Department. After SUBJECT had been in the Police Depart~
ment about a yéar he apparently began to believe some of
the favorable newspaper publicity which he received and
it was common knowledge that on many occasions he failed
to follow the orders from his superior, Provosty DAYRIES.
SUBJECT ‘began to question, or take opposite sides on -
policies set up by his superior, and to differ with the
views of Mayor MORRISON. -. :

On many occasions SUBJECT was invited to be a guest
speaker at various organizations, such as Young Business~
mens' Group and the American Legion. Somg of his speeches
made before these groups were critical of the city admin-
istration and the Police Department. These criticisms did
not help the SUBJECT and alienated many of his former friends.

Re stated when SUBJECT had the difficulty at the
Absinthe House Bar in March 1957 a complete investigation
was conducted, and statements were taken of over 50 wit-

nesses present at the bar at the time of the incident

% :



14-0009g

The majority of these witnesses stated SUBJECT had been
drinking and he appeared to be intoxicated. Testimony
also revealed SUBJECT grabbed the bartender by the jacket
and pushed him hard enough to. cause two buttons on the
jacket to break loose. Some witnesses stated SUBJECT
pulled out his gun and some denied it. There was also
sufficient testimony that SUBJECT had engaged in un-
necessary altercations at the bar, ‘Any one of these
allegations would be sufficient grounds for suspension
from the Police Department.

On 4 March ‘1957 Superintendent of Police DAYRIES
suspended the SUBJECT, but on 1 June 1957 SUBJECT was
re-instated in the Police Department. His administrative
powers were deleted and he. was-given-the -job -of-Planning.
Officer and the duties of investigating Communistic act-
ivities in the New Orleans area, SUBJECT kept this job
for about two days and was then discharged on the grounds
of insubordination, It appears that the SUBJECT had
failed to take orders from his superior, Superintendent
DAYRIES.

Reo stated that he personally had a great deal of
respect for the BUJBECT but he felt the SUBJECT had be-
come egotistical and domineering, and wanted the top
position in the New Orleans Folice Department and was not
interested in keeping the #2 job.

ney stated that since leaving the Police Department
SUBJECT had purchased and operated a newspaper in Gretna
but had been forced to sell it because of financial
difficulties. SUBJECT then started his own investigating
agency which he operates at the present time. When he
started this agency he hired Joseph OSTER, Jr, a former
New Orleans Folice Officer.

On 12 September 1960 Confidential Informant R-¥, in
charge of. an investigative agency, was interviewed.

is
R-Y stated he has known of the SUBJECT about five
years. When SUBJECT was Assistant Superintendent of
Police he had done a very commendable job, Apparently
SUBJECT was an honest person who did everything in his
power to clean up the graft and corruption in the New
Orleans Police Department. When his investigation came

Police Department were checked in the name of SUBJECT with

negative results.:’"The records were also negative in the names

At New Orleans, Iovisiena:
On 9 September 1960 Mr. Ray TAYLOR, an employee at
Dun and Bradstreet, 142 Canal Street, made available a
report, dated 5 February 1960, which contained the follow-
ing information about the SUBJECT: ‘

Guy B----- Associates, Inc., Room 34 Balter Building,’
404 St, Charles, New Orleans, is a Louisiana corporation
chartered 21 January 1958. Authorized capital is 500 shares
with no par value stock. & ‘,



private detective "a;
on.a fee basis. Operatic > conducted from quarters
in a large brick office building, located: in ‘the down-
town’ commercial area. Recent attempts to contact the
officers of the Corporation have been unsuccessful,

This Corporation has been in operation since January
1958 but in the opinion of authorities consulted, opera~
tions, especially in recent months, have not been con-
ducted along successful lines. Altho detailed operating
figures have not been available in outside quarters, the
opinion .of authorities consulted is that the volume et
present is limited and the two officers. who reportedly
own all of the outstanding stock are credited with earning
a small living, at best, from the business. The Corpora-
tion has a few huridred dollars in fixtures and equipment.
Cash, if any, is limited and outside investigation reveals
that during recent months some NSF (not sufficient funds)
checks have been issued.

A check of Orleans Parish Court reveals that in 6
November 1959 the State of Louisiana filed a tax lien
against Guy B---- Associates, Inc. in the amount of $393.
The lien is still outstanding. The Corporation has a

paying record. - .
