i do Cured Stret about a turn to othe

a four-story bullding, located in a connercial section

of the city and across the street from the Masonic l'emple

which now houses many Ünited States Government offices.

His general business reputation is good but it appears

that his business is not very sound.

His business was

Incorporated on 21 January 1958. He is President and

owns 470 shares of stock and his wife is Vice-President,

owning 10 shares.

The Secretary-Treasurer at the time

of incorporation was Joseph A. OSTER who owns 20 shares.

A Dun and Bradstreet report reflected that Guy B--

hired one investigator, Vernon GERDES, and the company

was not a financial success. A lien has been placed.

on the company and NSF (not sufficient funds) checke

have been returned. Four confidential informants were

interviewed. They advised Guy B--- was suspended from

his position as Assistant Superintendent of the New Or-

leans Police Department because he was involved in a

downtown bar incident. He was accused of being drunk

and of pulling a gun in public. There were many con-

flicting stories and favorable and derogatory newspaper

articles pertaining to the incident. Guy B----

HENCE

At New Ordeantry Lout stanay.

On 13 Peptember 1960 Confidential Informant II-17 was 1n-

when SUbLuebecame

en Stee can a tant Superintendent of the mate i 1%55

Orleans Police Department.

Prior to this appointment SUBJECT

had been an FBI igent and had retired after 20 years! service.

SUBJECT had been hired by Provosty A. DAYRIES, Superintendent

of the New Orleans Police Department, for the purpose of clean-

ing up

oh, teaminges the departinent mt 1 he got himes in

trouble during the Hardi Cras in March 1957. At that time he

was accused of being drunk and starting a fight in a New Or

leans bar in the French Quarter.

The Police Department conducted an investigation of this

incident which received a great deal of publicity in the news-

papers.

Many conflicting stories were circulated about this

incident. One was that the Police Department had framed, of

railroaded, the SUBJECT in order to get rid of him because he

was getting too close to the top men who were responsible for

the graft and corruption in the New Orleans Police Department.

The New Orleans Crime Commission defended the SUBJECT as did

many other prominent groups in the area. Newspaper articles

relating to the incident carried many conflicting stories of

witnesses.

One story was that the SUBJECT had been drinking

and had at least been indiscreet in handling the incident

which arose. Since the SUBJECT was a prominent police official

with a job requiring a great deal of tact and discretion, it

was hard to believe that a person in his position, if he had

been sober, would have caused the adverse publicity which he

received.

II-17 stated that after SUBJECT was suspended from the

Police Department he purchased a newspaper, the Herald, a weekly

paper published in Gretna, Louisiana, which he ran for over a

principal stockholders, Lews J. ROUSSEL. This alleged

defamation agdinst the SuBulur received & great deal of

notorety in the local newspapers.

(See attached Exhibit

#1, an

newspaper article from the Times-Picayune, New Or-

Jeans, Low sand, which reports the acquittal of SUBJDCT

on this charge)

After running the newspaper for over a year it was

believed SUBJECT had to sell it because of financial

diffIculties. After selling the paper he started his

own investigation agency which bore his name, and at the

present time it is believed he is operating this agency.

From newspaper articles II-l7 had the impression that this

business, run by SuBJECT, night not be completely succesful.

In recent years SUBJECI has associated himself with

Kent COURINEY, editot of the Independent American,

national publication which represents States Rights and

which 1s extremely right wing.in policy and appears to be

dedicated to the proposition of preserving white supremacy.

In the course of its promulgation of extreme views it has

used many unethical means.

Il-t? stated that the people

who have been connected with this Independent American

have criticised the Supreme Court to the point of demanding

that all of the Justices resiga because they were unethical.

II-IT advised that this organization, known as the Independent

American Citizens' Council, is militantly against desegragation.

II-17 stated he did not know in what capacity SUBJECT was connected

with this organization. II-l? had seen the SUBJECT at many of

their meetings and for all he knew SUBJECT might have been hired

by them to conduct investigations for them.

IJ-17 stated ever since SUBJECT has had some connection

with this extremely right-wing radical group people have be-

come concerned about whether or not he would use information,

gained when he was with the New Orleans Police Department, to

further the cause

of this right-wing element.

Another person SUEJECT has associated himself with is

Leander PEREZ, District Attorney for the Plaquemine Parish.

This individual is extremely right wing in his political

thinking and has sufficient power that he can dictate whether

or not a person can vote. It is a known fact that he has

denied the negroes in his parish the right to vote.

Orleans. Rat stated that he had a great deal of respect

and a

admiration for the SUBJECT when he first assumed his

duties with the Police Department.

The fact that the sub-

JECT had been a

Corner Fit men for over twenty years, and

had been Special Agent In Chicago, made it easy for one to

respect him.

When SUBJECT first took over his duties at the Police

Department he proved to be a capable administrator and he

instituted many procedures which were beneficial to the

Department. After SUBJECT had been in the Police Depart

ment about a year he apparently began to believe some of

the favorable newspaper publicity which he received and

It was common knowledge that on many occasions he failed

to follow the orders from his superior, Provosty DAIRIES.

SUBJECT began to question, or take opposite sides on

policies set up by his superior, and to differ with the

views of Mayor MORRISON.

On many occasions SUBJECT was invited to be a guest

speaker at various organizations, sich as Young Business-

mens' Group and the American Legion. Song of his speeches

made before these groups were critical of the city admin-

istration and the Police Department.

These criticisms did

not help the SUBJECT and alienated many of his former friends.

Ris stated when SUBJECT had the difficulty at the

Absinthe House Bar in March 1957 a complete investigation

was conducted, and statements were taken of over 50 wit-

nesses present at the bar at the time of the incident.

The majority of these witnesses stated SUBJECT had been

drinking and he appeared to be intoxicated. Testimony

also revealed SUBJECT grabbed the bartender by the jacket

and pushed him hard enough to cause two buttons on the

jacket to break loose. Some witnesses stated SUBJECT

pulled out his gun and some denied it. There was also

sufficient testimony that SUBJECT had engaged in un-

allegations would be sufficient grounds for suspension

from the Police Department.

On 4 March 1957 Superintendent of Police DAYRIES

suspended the SUBJECT, but on 1 June 1957 SUBJECT was

re-instated in the Police Department.

His administrative

powers were deleted and he was given the job of Planning

ivities in the New Orleans area.

for about two days and was then

discharged on the grounds

of insubordination. It appears that the SUBJECT had

failed to take orders from his superior, Superintendent

DAYRIES.

R-a stated that he personally had a great deal of

respect for the SUJBECT but he felt the SUBJECT had be-

come egotistical and domineering, and wanted the top

interested in keeping the #2 job.

R-& stated that since leaving the Police Department

SUbUrCI had purchased and operated a newspaper in Gretna

but had been forced to sell it because of financial

difficulties.

SUBJECT then started his own investigating

agency which he operates at the present time. When he

started this agency he hired Joseph OSTER, Jr, a former

New Orleans Folice Officer.

On 12 September 1960 Confidential Informant R-&, in

charge of an investigative agency, was interviewed.

R-& stated he has known of the SUBJECT about five

years. When SUBJECT was Assistant Superintendent of

Police he had done a very commendable job. Apparently

SUBJECT was an honest person who did everything in his

power to clean up the graft and corription in the New

Orleans Police Department. When his investigation came

The Corporation operates a private detective agency

fee basis. Operations are conducted fron quarters

in a large brick office building, located in the down-

town conmercial area. Recent attempts to contact the

officers of the Corporation have been unsuccessful.

This Corporation has been in operation since January

1958 but in the opinion of authorities consulted, opera-

tions, especially in recent months, have not been con-

ducted along successful lines. Altho detailed operating

figures have not been available in outside quarters, the

opinion of authorities consulted 1s that the volume at

present is limited and the two officers who reportedly

own all of the outstanding stock are credited with earning

a small living, at best, from the business. The Corpora-

tion has a few huddred dollars in fixtures and equipment.

Cash, if any, is limited and outside investigation reveals

that during recent months some NSF (not sufficient funds)

checks have been issued.

A check of Orleans Parish Court reveals that in 6

November 1959 the State of Louisiana filed a tax lien

against Guy B---- Associates, Inc, in the anount of $393.

The lien is still outstanding. The Corporation has a

slow paying record.
