REFERENCES

2. Businessmen in Honduras have reported that the economic and political
situation in the country, currently inasad state of affairs, is bound
te become worse as a result of the indifference Seing exhibited by t
President Oswaldo Lopez Arellano. On the economic side, the private i
business sector is quite concemed about an experzed government. move ‘
to nationalize. the fishing industry. . Some foreiza. firms already are acti
pulling out of the country and moving to nearby countries like
Sizaragua and El Salvador. Oa the political side, President Lopez
has failed to name a permanent foreign minister since November 1974,
when Cesar Battes occupied that post. Ricardo A. Pineda is performing
those duties:on interim basis... The President also has undermined «
Honduran youth by giving in to the demands of the leftist-controlled
labor unions. He gives businessmen the impressioa that he does not :
know guch about government; consequently, the sitcation in the country i
has become very unstable.

2.  Appezently, the regime in Honduras wants to emulate the current
Peruvian Government in failing to even consider elections at all.
In fact, the government, which is controlled by tae military, has
three pro-left ministers in the cabinet. They are Manuel Acosta
Bonilla, Secretary of State for Finance; Guatama Fonseca Zuniga,
Secretary of State for Labor and Social Security, and Manlio Martinez
Cantor, Executive Secretary, Planning Board. At cae time, Acosta was
the private secretary of the Mexican leftist leader Vicente Lombardo
Toledano, so he has been thoroughly indoctrinated along Marxist lines,

1. |Presideat Oswaldo Lovez Arellano is interested in a secead term. This opin-
ion is based on a growing consensus azcng Congressmen, Eoncuren business
leaders and the cilitary that Lozez desires to renain i= office for another
term. The thinking in these Nonduran circles is that the lack of disclaizers
by Lopez is, in itself, a strong indication of his "conzizuisno” plans. Ap-
proxizately tea é2ys ago Herman Fescua, =asazer of the Setional Railroad,
headquartered in San Pedro Suia, fad a'¢isccssion with z:2 President during
which Pascua passed the rezarx that he would lixe to recain with the railroad
as long as Lezez rezained in office. Lozez maée no speciZic rejoinder to
this but Pascua left the President's office with the Ciscinct ingression that
Lopez would run for reelection.

2. Lopez would probably be reelected with relative ease. ‘Tse opposition Liberal
Party is divided internally and lacks bora an effective cz Jidate and the
capital necessary to offer a serious challerge. :

.3. The power and influence of Ricardo Zuniga has declined érastically in recent

: sonths. This is not due to azy s;:cific act but more to a growing realization |
by Presicent Lopez of Zuniga's cishonesty, axbition for sever and his in-
ability to get along with soze covernnent ofvicials and 3rominent military
officers. President Lopez was particularty ciszayed at Zcaiga's handling of
Honduran propaganda curing the recent HondaranjEl Salvaésran border war.
Lopez allegedly felt that the invective against El Salvezor often mirrored
the type used by Cuban Cocauniss.

4. Miguel Andoaie Fernandez, a self-appointed presidential candidate, is aa
honest, sincere and well respected can, There is a suaii group of roughly
ten Arab and. Jewish businesszea in San Pedro. Sula knom as the "econonic
safia" because they control so cuch of Honduran business’ activity. Tis
group has taken note of the candidacy of Fernanez and has been izpressed j

‘1. For over five years I have been in close contact with Hondurans of

different backgrounds and social position. Never before have i seen the
‘anti-American sentiment which is sweeping Honduras at the present time.
‘The feeling is not only evident among student and labor organizations,
but among sectors of what is considered to be the best informed and
educatéd individuals in the country. Most of them are convinced

that the US has. the influence to exert diplomatic pre:sures on El Sel-
vedor in order to settle the pending border dispute, but has failed

to do so. They see the US Government as favoring El Salvador.

conversations with several government officials they emphatically
stated thet Honduras was not going to open the Pan American Highway to
Selvadoran traffic. This is the attitude of almost everybody that T
talked vith. This single issue has served to unite the country like
never before. There is a new feeling of patriotiem which was lacking
before the conflict with El Salvador.

3. ‘The campaign against Salvadoran products bas resulted in an incentive
for Honduran fovestors. I have had several inquiries from Honduran
businessmen who are interested in establishing production facilities for
consumer articles which were normally imported from El Salvador.

‘These individuals are eager to invest and establish factories in order
to £411 the deomad for products which were imported from El Salvador.

‘4. Honduras hes been purchasing arms and smmunition from Portuguese and
Belgisn sources. Sone of this armament bas arrived in the country.
According to e military informant wost of the armament has not been
delivered, but is expected in the country before the end of the yeer.

“[Thie report was developed by an Arcy representative assigned to the office of -
‘pPreparation.} e .

“During early August-1969 a close business associate met with Colonel (fnu) :
oreccoili (phonetic) and members of the Honduran Ary General Staff. Colonel
Coreccolli and members of the S*aff were alarmed by the continuing reports of
arms and ammunition stockpiling by El Salvador, These individuals were of the
opinion that the armament of the Honduran Armed Forcea was inferior to that of

‘El Salvador. tBsee

“During the meeting Colonel Coreccolli inquired about the possibility of a legal
“or illegal purchase of approxisately 2500 M-1 rifles and an undetermined amount .
of .30 caliber ammunition from US sources. He. explained that the weapons were

needed to arm personnel with prior military service in case of a renewal of
hostilities with El Salvador. These individuals were considered to be 2 re-
serve for the Honduran Armed Forces. o

Yy associate explained to Colonel Coreccolli that under the circumstances the

US Government would not issue an export permit for the armaments. As for il-
egal sources my associate disclaimed knowledge of any. He also considered

the transportation problem. Colonel Coreccolli stated that if acquired the -
weapons could be smuggled aboard a Honduran refrigeration ship which was an- |
chored in the Miami River at that time. Following this Colonel Coreccolli

Closed the meeting indicating that he was going to explore other possibilities. |

Following the meeting my associate had a conversation with Rigoberto Sandoval, ‘
a menbex of the Planification Board. Upon being informed of the meeting, Sandoval
‘warned wy associate to be careful in any dealings with Colonel Coreccolli, since
he was known as a corrupt government official, a "thief". Sandoval stated that;
thie was the opinion of President Oswaldo Lopez Arellano who distrusted Corec~
colli. A few days later my associate learned that Ricardo Zunica, Minister of {
-the Presidency, has been given the task of purchasing arns and ammunition for -;
Honduras. \: .

during the firet. part of August 1969, He told me. that he was going to purchas
‘wo “cobs aircraft" for the Honduran Government. He did-not epecify the type
nor the source of the aircraft. About & week later I had 8 telephone conver-
sation with Hernandez, during which he told me that he had been "successtul” ii
“his purchasing mission, He did rot give any detaile. ~ end

ce President Ramon Ernesto Cruz, and have offered to help him. Early
“in October 1972 a government ofiicial and several young arzy officers 3
‘stated in a private cvaversation that Lopez Arellano did not believe it
‘advisable for'him to lead a coup c'etat until gost of the following
events took place:

A rally in the general economy of the country. ees

During the same private conversation, Gonoral Oswaldo Lopez Arellano was
quoted as having stated that it wa:ld be futile for him to lead a coup
Wetat unless there was hope of isproving the woifare of the sasses and

the general economy of the country as wells he firnly believes it would

be impossible to accomplish that goal until a change in must of the above
conditions were met prior td”any coup d'etat in which he would be interested,

Selected Honduran army officers have attended special courses at 90 arny
facility in Peru since approximately 1967. According to an’army officer
the muper of candidates sent sizce early 1972 has not only, been’ increased
fhe Buse each has been ordered to specialize in any one cf ‘the br. ches of
their choice. They previously attended ‘the various courses given at that *

facility.

qhe aruy gives an outward appearasce of being in sympathy, with the present
regine, bat in reality not all the menbers sympathize with President Cruz.
In'private conversations sone speak of him in a derogatory sanners espe

dally yoong officers.

A man who continnes to wield a arcat deal of power in Wonduras is Ricordo
Juniga Augustinus, Minister of Government and Justices also leader of the
Nationalist Party. wniga's ability to continue wielding power is due to
bis being a very clever, astute, wealthy man. He always knows exactly
that he wants, and does not hesitate to utilize his personal charactex-
istics and his wealth in obtaining his objectives.

uniga"s present ambition for continued poser has forced him to feign
being a fira constitutionalist. That iss he is claiming loud and clear
that conmitments made between the government and political parties must
not only be respected but must ‘also be adhered to. Zuniga does not clain
this because he really believes this to be a oral obligation, or because
he is a fervent democrats The fusdamental reason ig that he knows he is
the recognized leader of the Nationalist Party, 06 well as having becone
influential in the Liberal Party. He believes ‘these parties are the ones
sustaining the present regime of President Roron Ernesto Cruz in power.
Therefore, he calculates that through these ‘vo parties he can protract
the power he has today.

Today relations betvien General Oswaldo Lopez Arellano and Zuniga are not
ae cordial as they were previously. However, one must not be led to be-
Sdeve that this situation is unrepairable because if Zuniga needed Lopez
hrellano's help, or vice versa, the former pleasant ¥ “ationship would

be hastily nursed back to life. It is just possible tat if a coup d'etat
Jed. by General Oswaldo Lopez Arellano should take place, and be successful,
Zuniga vou!

then This might not please some of the arny of ficexs who dislike Zaniga
due to his character and the procedures used by him to obtain power.

~~ -My_vork. takes_me to the rural, 3 in Honduras where I have oppsktontty
xo talk with the peasants. It is my considered opinion, based on yer-
onal observations, that the peasants in the rural areas are bitter ond
disgusted vith their lot. They have little or no faith left in anyone.
Eeononically, their condition is second only to Haiti, in conparicon vith
he countries in the Caribbean. The prices of staples compare with
prices! in the US, but Bond: ges Bre far below US wages. Unemploy-
