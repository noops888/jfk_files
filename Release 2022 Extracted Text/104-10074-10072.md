with John Daniel Williamson, Carrollton, Georgia

1. On 7 January 1975 Albert $. Coleman of tha Washington Field
Orfice called us to pass on information that he had just been given by
{Dale Zeisex\, DCD z eadquartera » Fegerding a call received by the Agency
duty officer on New Year's Eva from one John Daniel Williamson of
Carrollton, Georgia. Williamson identified himself as a Methodist
minister and gave his address as Route #2, Rox 3645, Carroliton,
Georgia, Phone: (404) 854-8443,

2. In his call to Agency Headquarters, Williamson said that he had a
friend who had inforsatton on the impending overthrow of a foreign govern-
ment. The information regarded illegal shipment of arms from the US to
the foreign country, Williamson said that bis friend had wanted to try te
sell tha information to the foreign country concerned but that when the
friand told Williamsen about it Williamson prevailed on him to let hin
(Williamson) bring it to the attention of the proper government agency,
resulting in his call to our headquarters on New Year's Eve. Williamson
asked that 2omeone from the Agency be put in contact with him.

3, On the afternoon of 7 January 1975, sfter verifying through the
phone operator thar Williemaon was listed in the Carreliton area (he
tually lives at Roopville, Georgia, on Tyus Road, but tha Reepville
psones are handled under the Carrollton exchange}, we called his number.
We were informed by a young male voice, apparently his son, that Williamson
was indeed a Mathedist minister, but that he taught school every day during
the week in the high sehool at Tranklin, Georgia, except on Saturdays when |
he worked all day at a hardware store at Rockmart, Georgla. We were told
that he praached on Sunday mornings. We were not told what he does on
Sueday afternaous. Since he was not to be et home util after 5 ee
called him from our own home that some evening.

identified ourselves during the eariler call. He gave us essentially
sama information furnishad during his lew Year's Eve call. Hea said that
the friend about whom ha called is a “former parishioner and lives in tha
Carroliton area.” Use preferred not te previde us with the friend's vane
and address. The informacion, however—-that which we ware abla to

5. Wa did learn that the friend whom Williamson deseribed ao a
business consultant. ‘a kind of a high-finance nan involved in
setting up corporations,’ who often travels abroad, kad been approached
by someone “locally,’ i.e., in the Carrolltoa-West Atlanta area
(Carrollton 1s about 40 miles west of Atlanta). The friend was said to
be “a good friend. a reliabde man, a college graduate, an established
man in the coummity.” According to Williamson, the friend was
approached because of the nature of his work te perform some sort. of ©
task for the group, and he “knew that somathing was wrong.’ The friend
then learned all bs could about the planned operation and eventually
talked with Williamson about it. The friend told Williamson that the
gun-running operation had been going on for about a yaar.

6. At one point Williamson said that hia friend told him that
“the people involved in this thing won't hesitate to kill him (the
friend) and he knows that he's going to have to leave thia part of the
couatry when it comes to light.'’ Williamson told ua: “I feel like L'va
got this nan’s life in my hands and I don't wart to do anything to
jeopardize his life, because I know him and hia family and all.” :
Wilitamson suggested that we meat his friend at tha Cape and Sword Motel
restaurant on I-20, near Six Flags Over Georgia, west of Atlanta, and
he said that tha two of then had already talked of this as a good
meeting place. We told Wiliiamson that we vould be glad to acet with
his friend but first we would like for his friend to give ue a call se
that we nay talk with him. We gave our office phone mmber to
Williamson. Ag of the writing of this memorandum, we have hed no cali.

7. From the information that Williamson provided, e.g., location
vf peopla involved, an attempt to meet with an Agency representative
{to possibly get us involved merely by association), we believe that much
of the substance of the matter could be the same as that which vas
reported from this office to OSS as related by Stephen Van Cleave
regarding Miteh Werbell, at al. (Sea ATL-39-74, 28 February 1974,
Resume of Contacts with Stephen Van Cleave; ATL-53-74, 9 April 1974,
Stephea Van Cleave.) Miteh Warbell's operation, which hag been :
degeribed locally as a “machine-gun factory,” is locatad at Powder Springs,
Georgia, about ten miles north of the I-20 Capa and Sword Motel. At say _
rata, 4r. Willtanson's friend has been given the opportunity te conteer us—
and we are awaiting his call. :
