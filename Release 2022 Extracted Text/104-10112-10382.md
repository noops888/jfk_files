MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: CONEIN, Lucien Emile - 75025

1. Jack Murray, the Security Officer for IO Division of DDP,
called me to state that Sybject's first wife, Monique Veber, is a
mistress to someone that IO Division has an interest in. rt appears
that(a staff agent belonging to 10)is going to pass some money to
this individua?4whose mistress is Monique Veber, and that rumor in
IO has it that Monique Veber's family might be involved in some kind
of Commie-type activities.

2. Jack Murray asked me if we had any information on Monique
and our file shows that there is no derogatory information on Monique
Veber. I, in turn, checked with the Deputy Chief/PSD and I will
notify Jack Murray that we have no derogatory information concerning
Monique Veber.
