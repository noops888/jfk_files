of the ruling class. LaChapelle stated that SUBJECT's defection was the truest
decision HE could make tyus making the only solution HIS conscience dictated.

maybe the world around HIM. LaChapelle stated that only three people other than
himself who were in any way friendly were Chaplain Camp, presently in Germany,

Hal Nelson, and John Klink, ‘hey would not encourage a defection. SUBJECT wuld
not let HIMSELF be influenced by others, LaChapelle went on saying that SUBJECT's
defection was motivated by HIS resentment of HIS treatment by other personnel,
indicating that HE had been beaten and reovired stitches in HIS head on one
occasion and that HE was considered different by HIS section leaders. SUBJECT
had mentioned defection to LaChapelle, but LaChapelle had talked HIM out of

it. At that point in their relationship, the friendship between LaChapelle and
SUBJECT seemed to decline, LaChapelle blames the Army and society for forcing
