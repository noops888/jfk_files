Frenk Gheridan {aterviewod the committee for AREC at the hashingtan
Field Office. sa 24 March 1961. ‘hey consisted of Abel Mestre. Victor
Pedreso, Silvio Eamabria, teslie Pastin, Carlos Garcie del Tron, and
Paul Heilman. Hestre stated thst the organization veo founded about
hme 1960 in Heat es o clandestine spolitical group with the objective
to ovurtarow Cestro, to unite the various Cuien exile quis snd to
creme lews fur the effective reconstruction of Cua. Hembership 13
Sorpriced of. individual businesses rather than representatives of
Laxge orgendzet ions.

2. The coumittee hed been meeting with various Uuited States
officials in Veskington, D. C., to express ite views, Ite mnbers
are worried. over Cestro propaganda, which, although wtrue, has becn
accepted as fact, 1.e., twenty thousend killings by Betista and the
clein thet Castro's vas a social revolution rather then a politicol
ong. ‘they polsted out that the Cuban econory woo foreerly prospering
with en enlerging middle class, se thet the term social revolition
hee bota used oy Castro primarily to prose iniict sessurus. in
aldition, lator legielation vas in effect which actually pot auployers
et a disadventage vith employees, compared to ths other countries of
Letin America. ‘he problem facing Cudan Labor ves prinarily the
senponal one crop economy. ‘ow the pecule Lave less pay, less
commodities available, no claims against enyone end merely vork for
a Castro-Coszanist goverment. The farmer bea not been helped by
egrarien reforms, bit hes been obliged to enter cooperatives or to
bell his crags et controlled prices, which are pald whea an how
the goverment pleascs. This io merely an imitation of what Castro
Promised.

3. ‘The cormttes. fecla thet mprorters of tho revolution actually

1940 constitution. In thio regard, the orabars feel that the Comamists
nay try for e eecond rod in any sovernment replecing Castro. Such
an interin regioe must develop careful scasures to promote true
democratic elections. This govurrmest nay include covert Comamists

by the United States before their retuni to Ciba.
