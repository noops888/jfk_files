for many years. He said subject has not been seen by him
nor has any of his associates: been seen by him at the airport
er using National facilities. He said he is personally
acquainted with JOHN DEMMI and JIMMY LONGO. He noted while
at the Tampa Dog Track on the night of December 23, 1961,
some unknown source had remarked that SANTO was home for
Christmas, but that no further information was obtained.

He said that if subject were flying in or out of Miami,
perhaps his father, JOE CICCARELLO, employed on the day
shift for many years with Pan American Airways, Miami
International Airport, may be of some assistance inasmuch
as his father is well acquainted with the subject. He
noted his father sees all persons coming and going on
South American or foreign country flights and may have
seen and talked with subject.

A spot surveillance of subject's residence,
2505 Bristol Ave.,; was conducted on December 26, 1961,
by SA's. FRANCIS X. O'BRIEN and STEPHEN J. LABADIE and subject
was-not observed.

person he’ was talking to said subject was not staying in
any particular one place in Miami. Source said he did not
know subject's method of travel. from Miami to Tampa and 7
subject’s plans for the New Year was not determined, but
discreet inquiry may still be possible. Source pointed
out thatthe must be very careful that no.one obtains the
idea that‘he is overly interested in TRAFFICANTE's
activities or he would be in serious trouble.

while in Tampa, stating subject would very seldom get out
but stay in his home and those that wanted to see him
would go to his home. Source did not know subject's personal
physician, stating subject is always in good health, but

that a Dr. SCOLARO, 21st St., and E Broadway, Tampa, may
have treated the subject in the past. Source said that

he agreed subject may have insurance on his contact lenses,
if he still used them, but was of the opinion that SANTO
didn't use them any more.

This same source advised he was of the opinion
that subject travelled by air when coming to Tampa stating
he knew for sure that subject had come into the St.
Petersburg, Fla., airport several times ‘in the past years
and that he normally came and went at night. Source said
he knew no one close to:“the subject who would furnisa
information on his travels stating his closest associates
were JAMES C. LONGO and. FRANK DIECIDUE, neither’ of whom
