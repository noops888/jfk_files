Msg Nr:

Pursuant to my preceding telegram( (A)).

The President's death was given official notice only by the

lowering of a black flag to half-staff at the government head-

quarters and by the visit of a deputy minister of Foreign Affairs

and an assistant deputy trade minister to my American colleague.

hours seems to have died. "The press, on the other hand, did

not deviate from its harsh custom of anti-American manifestation

and sought, with a touch of irritability, to reject any

suggestion of Comminist implication; in the attempt.

((A)) Not available.
