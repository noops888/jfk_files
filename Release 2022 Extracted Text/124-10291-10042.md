REPRESENTATIVE OF-THE PRESIDENTIAL OFFICE. THE DECISION TO
_ PERSONALLY ATTEND THE FUNERAL HAS BEEN USED BY CHILE'S ENEMIES
TO EMBARRASS THE CHILEAN GOVERNMENT.
4, WHEN QUERIED ABOUT THE VENEZUELAN INVESTIGATION INTO
THE LETELIER ASSASSINATION, RIVAS SAID THAT VENEZUELAN AUTHORITIES
[AD GONE ABOUT AS FAR AS THEY WANTED TO GO IN QUESTIONING ORLANDO
BOS CH, CUBAN EXILE’ LEADER, REGARDING HIS POSSIBLE INVOLVEMENT.
RIVAS POINTED OUT THAT BOSCH HAD POWERFUL FRIENDS CLOSE TO THE
VENEZUELAN GOVERNMENT AND THAT PRESSURE WAS BEING “APPLIED ON
BOSCH'S BEHALF. HE EXPRESSED DOUBT THAT ANY MORE INFORMATION WOULD.
BE REVEALED BECAUSE, OF THE VENEZUELAN GOVERNMENT'S RELUCTANCE TO
PRESS THE MATTER TOO FAR.

PEREZ TO HOLD A MEETING OF PRESIDENTS OF THE ANDEAN PACT COUNTRIES

THAT HIS-PRESENCE IN .CHILE NOT BE MADE A MATTER OF. PUBLIC

KNOWLEDGE. FOR THIS REASON, THE MEETING WAS ARRANGED TO TAKE
PLACE IN THE MINISTRY OF DEFENSE RATHER THAN AT DIEGO PORTALES
GOVERNMENT HOUSE, WHERE THERE IS A GREATER RISK OF DISCOVERY BY
REPORTERS.

ee CARACAS | COMMENTED THAT ALTHOUGH RIVAS HAS, ON OCCASION, HANDLED”
SPECIAL ASSIGNMENTS FOR THE PEREZ ADMINISTRATION, SUCH AN

ASSIGNMENT AS DESCRIBED. IN THIS REPORT IS. UNUSUAL.” IT IS OUT OF

CHARACTER FOR PEREZ TO EXPLAIN OR APOLOGIZE FOR HIS ACTIONS AND

IT APPEARS STRANGE THAT A PEREZ REPRESENTATIVE WOULD ADMIT THAT

BOSCH HAS POWERFUL FRIENDS IN THE VENEZUELAN GOVERNMENT WHEN. THE

GOVERNMENT HAS GONE TO GREAT LENGTHS TO ATTEMPT TO HIDE THIS FACT.)
