FORGED," SAID A DEPI, OF MOTOR VEHICLES SPOKESMAN. "IT WAS NEVER

ISSUED BY OUR AGENCY.": HE DENIED ANY DEPARTMEHT COOPERATION WITH

A SPOKESMAN FOR AITOPNEY GENERAL LEFXOWITZ SAID

HIS OFFICE HAD NO JURISDICTIÓN IN FORGERY CASES:

7. WALLACH'S WAS APPARENILY EDWARD JOSEPH: WARREN'S

INCLUDING FIRST RATIONAL CITY BANK, NEWYORK LIFE INSURANCE CO.,

CONTINENTAL INSURANCE AND RCA, EXPRESSED VARIED FEELINGS OF

SURPRISE, INDIGNATION AND HELPLESSNESS WHEN INFORMED OF THE

FRAUDS.

18. A NEW YORX LIFE OFFICIAL COULD REMEMBER NO SIMILAR

INCIDENT IN THE INSURANCE COMPANY'S HISTORY. "BUT WHAT CAN

YOU DO, ME ASKED, "TAKE THE CIA INTO COURT?"

•WOULDN®I COOPERATE'

11° WHILE SAYING THAT "NO LEGAL ACTION SAS ANTICIPATED,"

A HIGH CITISANK OFFICIAL---WHO ASXED THAT MIS NAME NOT BS USED

EMPHASILEO THAT "WE DID NOI AND WOULD NOT COOPERAIS WITH THE CIA."

SOUNDING ANNOYED, THE OFFICIAL ADDEDS NOBOY LIKES TO GET MIXED

UP. Ild ALTIMING LIKE THIS."

I2. THE QUALITY OF THE CIA FORGERIES IS READILY APPARENT

TO EXPERIS. THE CODE NUMBER ON THE DRIVER'S LICENSE, DERIVED

FROM A

SECRET FORMULA INVÖLVING THE REGISTRANT•S BIRTH DATE AND

NAME, SO CLOSELY RESEMBLED THE AUTHENTIC VERSION THAT STATE MOTOR

VEHICLE DEPT. AUTHORITIES ORIGINALLY THOUGHT THE LICENSE WAS.

TRE CURRECT COMBINATION OF NUMBERS AND LETTERS WAS

MeTICULOUSLY FAXED.

14. THE PHONY CONTINENIAL POLICY CARD WAS NUMBERED

INCONSISTENCY, HOWEVER, NOTING THAT AF REFERS TO AN AUTO POLICY,

WHICH SOULD HAVE SEVEN FINAL DIGITS, NOT SIX AS ON THE HUNT

VERSION.

::15. A SPOKESMAN FOR IME CIA DECLINED TO COMMENT WHEN

ASKED IF THE STATE AND PRIVATE FIRMS HAD COOPERATED IN PREPARING THE

FALSIFIED DOCUMENTS. HE ALSO REFUSED TO DISCLOSE THE NAME OF THE

CIA SECTION WHICH PREPARES FORGERISS OF THIS NATURE. EVERYTHING
