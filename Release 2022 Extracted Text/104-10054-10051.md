1. (BACKGROUND.

‘The LIEMPTY Project is designed to collect operational information on the i
LIMERICK instailation end personnel, as well as targets of opportunity, through |
stationary and uobile photographic coverage. In addition, the project provides
the means for investigating leads from the above noted covereges as well as other

* Station sources. LIEMPTY supports other Station operations through the renting of
“safehouses, providing and servicing post office vox letter drops, conducting counter
surveillances end investigations and performing related tasks. -

2. OPERATIONS - REVIEW.

The Station feels that 1t would be helpful to summarize at this time informatio!
previously reported to Headquarters (see paragraph 3, reference B) concerning the
photo basehouses under this project end thereby give Headquarters en updated frame
of reference in which to view the roles of the various basehouses,

‘The LIMITED end LILYRIC basehouses provide coverage of front of the LIMERICK
installation. . Although on the surface it may eppear that these two baschouses
provide duplicate teke, this is not the case. It has been the Station's experience
in running the unilateral LIEMPTY operation that ea 0900 to evening workday, which
would be required of a single basehouse in order to cover the LIMERICK target
effectively, is just too long for any pair of agents to remain effective. This is
especially true wnen it is considered thet these basehouse operators are essentially
unsuvervised during their workday. It would also be impossible for a single base~
r to provide the kind of coverage the Stetion needs on the target instellation,
peak hours of activity, namely late morning end carly afternooh.

CONTINUATION OF
DISPATCH SECRET HMMA-23343,

For these reasons, the LILYRIC basehouse generally operates from 0900 to 1400 or 1500
weekdays. LIMITED operates fro 1200 to 1800 or dark (as the daily situation
dictates) on weekdays, and 0900 to 1400 on Saturdays. (These hours are subject to
change to fit Station needs.) Special coverage for Sunday is arranged on a need
pasis; however, past experience has shown regular coverage of Saturday afternoons
and Sundays is not rewarding. This schedule provides for both baschouses to be in
action during the peak activity hours of the LIMERICK target. Although even this
arrangement is not completely airtight, anything less than this vould present unaccept-|
able gaps in the coverage. It must also be considered that without two basehouses cov
ing the front of the target installation, any illness, personal problem or vacation fo:
operators of one baschouse would terminate Station coverage.

Also worth mention at this point is the radio "dispatching" of the LIEMBRACE
team by the LIMITED base. Due to the tight protective security measures instituted by
the locel police in the area of the LIMERICK installation it is impossible for a
unilateral surveillance team to stekeout the LIMERICK installation when assigned to
coverage of menbers of the LIMERICK staff. LIMITED operator radio dispatches the *
team onto target personnel giving direction, means of travel and description of dress
of these targets. This permits the team to commence its surveillance a number of .
locks from the LIMERICK installation end beyond the protective ring of the local

ice, This radio dispatching makes possible the surveillance of LIMERICK st:

which would otherwise be impossible or extremely risky. a ape ee Ave

The third besehouse, LICALLA, provides coverage of the back of the LIMERICK.
installation and the garden area. This coverage is the real "window" the Station has
into the LIMERICK target and provides a large part of the information on which
Station bases its identifications of LIMERICK steffers and its estimates of staffing,
personnel positions and intelligence connections of the LIMERICK personnel, Due to
its position, LICALLA is also able to provide information on the LIMERICK installation
which is of LAURICLE interest.

It is the Station's opinion that as long as the LIMERICK instellation is a prime
target of the Station, it will be necessary to maintain the present three basehouses.
To eliminate any one of the three would create a gap in the Station's coverage that
would not be compatible with the emphasis placed on this target by the letegy RAD and
the Station's responsibilities under this RMD. ene

3. QPERATIONS - OU

In the past it has been stated that the LIEMPTY operation provides the majority
of photographs used by the Station in its CE operations against the LIMERICK target.
This is still true and will remain so for the foreseeable future, The Station, and
particularly that section concerned with the LIMERICK terget, has always considered
the LIEMPTY photo take an essential tool in following the deily activities of the
personnel of the target installation and visitors to that installation. Obviously
the most interesting individuels in both these categories are those of intelligence
concern, Among these have been a number of PBPRIME citizens. For those interested
in statistics, LIPTY take for the reporting period included approximately 235 rolls
of operational 8, 205 of which were directly concerned vith the LIMERICK target.
In addition, the daily logs kept by the basehouses on the comings end goings of the
LIMERICK ‘staff moubérs and visitors nave greatly aided the Scations CE efforts,
especially in crisis times such as-the CPFLOOR affeir.

officers in these cases. The project assets have also been alerted to
provide inmediate reporting on a special case involving a PBPRIME citizen
Which is of interest to ODENVY and KUBARK. During the recent visit to
Mexico of an individual of ODTBEX interest, the project assets were alerted
and supplied special weekend coverage of the LIMERICK staffer who was known
to have contacted the individual of interest to ODIBEX.

e. During the reporting period the operational use of LIENTRAP continued to
increase. This use has been primarily in the coverage of PCM and exile
Commnists residing in Mexico.

3. SBCURTTY.
C LIENIRAP was involved in an accident on 2h February 1964 while returning from
an operational assignment. LIENTRAP was struck on the right side by e taxi which
head run a red light causing LIENTRAP to turn over on its left side. Since the
operational equipnent is not permanently mounted in LIENTRAP, and is carried in a
small case while moving from assignment to assignment, all equipment was readily
evacuated by LIEMPTY-10 while the driver, LIEMPTY-11, ana bystanders righted
LIENIRAP, The taxi fled the scene and LIENTRAP was able to move off under its

own power, Damage to the right side and broken windshield resulted from the accident.
No security problems resulted and LIENTRAP was back in operation in a week.

A survey was conducted emong the agents under this project to determine if they
renembered their recontact instructions and verbal recognition signals. It was
learned that most had forgotten at least part of the plan, New contact plans are
being formated snd current pictures of all agents have been obtained to facilitate
recontact. It is planned to review the recontact instructions with the ‘agents
periodically once the new plan is worked out.

No major equipment problems other than the LIENTRAP accident noted under
URITY" above were experienced during this period. ‘in February the LIMITED camera
required adjustment of the shutter end trip spring.

- 5. PERSONNEL,

The Station nas been making a review of its personnel needs wider this
project in order to determine where economies could be instituted without causing
gaps in operational coverage or decrease in security and efficiency. It has been
determined that LIGMPTY-12 can be terminated under the above coniitions and probabl
LIEMPTY-6 as well, It is planned effect these terminations as of 1 July 1964. It
also has been determined that as of 1 July LIEMPTY-19 will be placed on an hourly
rate for work performed for the Station.

6, TRADING,

No training other than regular revicw of tradecraft principles (to include
recontact instructions) are planned. Photographic product is reviewed daily as a
stendard procedure, and action agents are instructed as necessary to improve or
correct their tecknique in both taking and processing the product.

REVIEW OF PROJECT LIEMPTY
(Por the Purpose of Project Renewal)

CURRENT OBJECTIVES AND PRODUCTION

Qliver G, SCANTLING Segment (discussed in relation
to project objectives):

1. "fo collect operational information per-
taining to LIMERICK personnel and physical
facilities." SCANTLING has continued (See the
last Project Review forwarded as an attachment
to HMMA~14093, 13 November.1959) to provide
worthwhile and significant information per—
taining to the above objective. There follow
a few examples of SCANTLING's production:

@ A detailed casing of the LIMERICK
electrical power supply was forwarded
to Headquarters as an attachment to
HMMA-14496, 12 February 1960. The pro-
auction of this type of operational
information, which takes several weeks
to compile accurately, illustrates the
unusual talents possessed by SCANTLING
together with his valuable contributions
to the Station's operational information
collection effort.

bd. SCANTLING has been used frequently
to follow up leads produced by LIFEAT/
LIMERICK (now produced by LIENVOY). For
example, in May 1960, LIFEAT indicated
that the LIMERICK target was having con—
siderable contact with an AGENCIA ROBLES
concerning the handling of incoming and
outgoing shipments. By discreet investi~
gation, SCANTLING was able to provide the
tation with additional pertinent information
about the address, owner and type of business
engaged in by the firm, Such information’
then becomes readily available for exploitation |

interest come to the attention of the Station,

a. In March 1960 SCANTLING was instrumental
in locating property adjacent to the LITABBY
installation which the Stetion has since
rented in anticipation of initiating photo—
graphic and technical operations. SCANTLING
wag able to accomplish this assignment only
after a thorough casing and pretext investi—
gations of the several pieces of property
appropriate for such operations.

be SCANTLING is also used to follow up
sensitive leads in connection with LIFEAT
and LIENVOY production from LITABBY and
sister targets (See exemple as to type
under I,A,1, b and c above).

for further details on this case.

be ‘The preliminary investigative work on a
KUSODA case of priority interest was conducted
by SCANTLING. During this investigation it

was necessary for SCANTLING to travel to
Aguascalientes, Guanajuato md Minatitlan to
obtain the information required by Headquarters.
See the attachments to HMMT-1416, 20 May 1960,
for the results of the investigation.

4- In addition to his contributions to the above objec
tives, SCANTLING is used for miscellaneous support
requirements of the Station. For example, SCANTLING
handled several of Raymond H, GERENDE's (ps) operations
while the latter was away from Mexico City during August
and September 1960, Also, SCANTLING has been managing
the LIJERSEY surveillance team since the departure of
Simon D, CLACKET? in August 1960. It is hoped that
SCANTLING can be relieved of this assignment as soon

as the LITEMPO project is approved. SCANTLING has also
been used to spot and rent safe houses for various
Station operations, a valuable operational support
services

5. As stated in the preceeding Request for Project
Renewal, a though SCANTLING's LIEMPTY Project objectives
cen never be completely fulfilled, it is the Station's
opinion that SCANTLING has made important and valuable
contributions to LIEMPTY Project objectives specifically
and to other Station activities in generd . SCANTLING's
production, measured against monetary expenditures,

case officer time and other intangible factors, unques—
tionably justifies his continuation es a integral part
of Project LIEMPTY.

Raymond H. GERENDE Segment (discuasea@ in relation to project

objectives):

le "To collect operational
LIMERICK gersomnel and phys
of photographic base houses.” Together vith their
extensive photographic coverage of the LIMERICK target,
the photographic bases also contribute other types of
operational information:

‘This information is particularly useful in keeping track of
LIMERICK personnel and assisting with the identification of
visitors to the installation, Also, LIMITED maintains a
summary attendance list of LIMERICK employees on a daily
basis; this enables the Station quickly to ascertain the
presence or absence of an employee on any given day,
Finally, one other significant service is performed by this
base, the radio dispatching of the LIEMBRACE surveillance
team on LIMERICK personnel and targets of opportunity.
LIMITED's photographic coverage is still concentrated on
visitors, as opposed to employees, to the LIMERICK
installation, A recent example of the base's contributions to
Station efforts is the case of Joseph Ralph MAURI. In this
case, a LIENVOY lead indicated that an American might visit
the LIMERICK target on a certain day, The base was alerted
to dispatch the radio-controlled surveillance team on any
person appearing to be an American, The results of this
assignment were indicated in MEXI-6392 and several other
cables, LIMITED was also able to provide photographs,
which when compared with photographs provided by Head-
quarters, left no question as to MAURI's identity.

b, LILYRIC - This base's output of high-quality clandestine
photographs has been in about the same quantity as last year,
In addition, the base operator, LIEMPTY-14, prepares weekly
reports on LIMERICK employees and their wives. LILYRIC
also performs the assignment of noting and reporting the
license plate numbers of all cars bringing visitors to the’
LIMERICK installation, LILYRIC photographs also are con-
centrated on visitors to the target, as opposed to employees,
it should be noted that LILYRIC operates for photographic
coverage during the hours from daylight to,1400 hours. each
day of the week except Sunday. The LIMITED base maintains
photographic coverage from 1400 hours co darkness each day.
except Sunday,

c. LICALLA - As ceported in previous correspondence, ' the
LICALLA base contributes to the collection of operational
information through photographic coverage of LIMERICK
employees and their families, Also, the base operator,

SECRET (eer

LIEMPTY-9, supplies extremely worthwhile information
pertaining to the apparent positions and jobs of the target
employees, He accomplishes this objective by careful
observation and analysis. LICALLA also maintains a daily
attendance roster of all LIMERICK employees. LICALLA
coverage of the target, both photographic and physical
observations, enables the Station to keep abrest of LIMERICK
personnel changes, a vital contribution to the Station's counter-
espionage effort,

2, "To collect operational information and identify operational leads
pertaining to Station targets of opportunity," The LIENTRAP operation,
handled by GERENDE, is the major contributor to this objective. It
has been possible for LIENTRAP to take photographs and to perform
pretext investigations in support of numerous Station activities. The
cases listed below are cited as examples:

a, In the case of Cesar GONZALEZ Sanchez (see I, A, 3,a, above)
LIENTRAP was able to procure photographs of GONZALEZ at his
Mexico City residence which, when compared to Headquarters
provided photographs, left no doubt that GONZALEZ was the
subject of interest to Headquarters,

b, LIENTRAP confirmed the identity of Olga CASTILLO de Ledon,
a frequent visitor to the LIMERICK installation and an ardent
supporter of the present Cuban regime, through a pretext
investigation of the residents of an apart ment building where
CASTILLO was believed to live. Later, LIENTRAP supported the
results of the investigation with excellent photographs of the
subject,

3, “To provide operational support to Station operations, i,e., rent
hotel rooms and apartments, and conduct counter-surveillances, “

. GERENDE is used frequently to rent hotel rooms and apartments for

other Station operations and activities: GERENDE’s comprehensive
area knowledge and personal operational capabilities combine to’ make
him an extremely valuable Station asset for such support activities,
GERENDE also procures post otfice vox letter drops for the many
Station operations requiring them,

4, It is the Station's conclusion that the money and case officer time
expended on this segment of the LIEMPTY project is worthwhile and
should be continued in view of the quality and quantity of operational

information produced,

Simon D, CLACKETT Segment (discussed in relation to project
objectives) =

1, "To collect operational information and to identify operational leads.
pertaining to the LIMERICK target and Station targets of opportunity,”

During this project year the LIJERSEY surveillance team under the
direction of CLACKETT began contributing to the Station's support

efforts through pretext investigations and physical surveillances, Some

examples of the team's work are listed below:

a, Rafael TISCHLER Guzman (201-64372) is a Guatemalan
Communist which the team had under surveillance from
November 1959 to April 1960. ‘The surveillance, together

with information acquired from other sources, eventually
resulted in an unsuccessful recruitment attempt on TISCHLER,

b. Pericles FRANCO Oxnes (201-64546) - FRANCO is a
Dominican of interest to the Station, The LIJIERSEY team
devoted portions of five months, January to May 1960, collecting
information on subject through physical surveillance.

c, Jose Maria "Chema" LOPEZ Valdizon (201- ) was the
subject of a physical surveillance during May and June 1960.
LOPEZ was later deported from Mexico through the efforts
of LiTEMPO~2.

da, CLACKETT and the LYERSEY team performed numerous
‘etext investigations on Station targets of opportunity and-on.
ree separate occasions during the project year served as

a counter-surveillance escort for Station officers in other
operations, 7

2. CLACKETT, just prior to his resignation in August 1960, spent
about tive weeks giving tradecraft and operational skills training to

LITEA-1, Although not specifically covered by the project objectives,

this ability on CLACKETT's part is considered a significant con-
tribution to the Station's support efforts,

3. In view of CLACKETT's resignation, which was effective 31
August 1960, and the proposed transfer of the LIJERSEY team to

the LITEMPO project, this segment of the LIEMPTY project wibl

not be renewed, However, for the record, it is considered that ’
the CLACKETT segment of LIEMPTY was worthwhile and the
expenditure of Station assets in connection with LYERSEY operations
were justified,

D. Relationship to Related Mission Directive Objectives:

It can readily be noted that Project LIEMPTY has provided support to
many Starion operations and in. this manner has been a contributing factor
to the furtherance of the Related Mission Directive, The project has not
produced any positive intelligence nor has it been intended that it should
do so, The project's sole purpose is to provide a mechanism for the
development of operational information in support of other Station
operations,

CHANGES
A, Simon D, CLACKETT

The unexpected resignation of CLACKETT in August 1960 has
necessitated the decision as how best to utilize the LIIERSEY surveillance
team and still benefit from the training and experience gained by the team
during the past year. As explained in the LITEMPO project outline, it was
decided that the LITEMPO Staff Agent would have the time, the need and the
requirements to handle and manage the LIJERSEY team on a regular basis;
consequently, the Station believed that such a solution to this problem would
permit the Station to continue to profit from CLACKETT's past efforts.

B. Oliver G, SCANTLING

Since CLACKETT's departure, SCANTLING has been‘handling the:
LIJERSEY team as an interim measure pending Headquarters approval of
the LITEMPO project.” SCANTLING has been exposed io, and likewise
knows, only one of the team members, LIEMPTY-20, SCANTLING is
known to L-20 only by an alias.

5. There have been no other personnel changes within the LIEMPTY

project, excepting the resignations of Simon D, CLACKETT and
Wilma J, FIORDALISL,

EFFECTIVENESS

A. General comments pertaining to the value of the project efforts to the
Station's needs - The Station is of the opinion that its operations are only
as good as the support mechanisms backstopping and contributing to them,

ni support agents and organizations, such as
the LIEMPTY Project, to investigate leads and to collect.operational
information is an indispensable ingredient to the Station's espionage and
counterespionage objéctives, The Station woud be seriously handicapped
in its operational activities should the support services of such agents as
GERENDE, SCANTLING aad the agents under their control be suddenly
made unavailable,

B, LIMERICK Target - The basis for most. of the-Station's counter-
espionage activities directed against the LIMERICK target require detailed.
knowledge of the identity, activities and fellow associates of LIMERICK
personnel, The LIEMPTY photographic basehouses undoubtedly provide
more of this type information than any other Station operation, The
production from LIEMPTY photographic bases and from the LIENVOY
project provide the Station with the large majority of LIMERICK leads,

C. Targets of Opportunity - The immediate availability of independent
assets to perform investigations, photographic assignments and other
essential types of support services in connection with Station targets of
opportunity represent an operational advantage which this Station considers
highly significant, It is due to such LIEMPTY assets that an agent can be
sent to distant areas in Mexico to do investigations, that photographs can
be made of individuals and places which are of operational interest and
apartments and hotel rooms can be acquired in fictitious names in

support of sensitive operations and activities.

D, Although the progress and success of any support project depends
upon requirements from other Station operations, it must be concluded
that Project LIEMPTY has indeed been effective during the past project
year,

PROBLEMS

A, Security - The activities of the LICALLA base were suspended in
September 1960 as a direct result of the arrest of three KURIOT
technicians by the Cuban Government, One of the technicians was known
to have knowledge of the four LIMUST units (LICALLA: is located in one
of these unirs) and the Station considered it appropriate to suspend photo-
graphic operations pending resolution of the situation, At this time,
there is no indication when LICALLA operations will be resumed, The
LICALLA base operator has reported that there have been no unusual
inquiries or other suspicious actions which might indicate that LICALLA
has been compromised to LIMERICK persomel; however, such.a
possibility will exist until the release of the three technicians. No
other security problems have occurred during the past year.

PLANS

A. Processing of Photographs - During the past year considerable
progress has been made in the Station's handling, i,¢., sorting, indexing,
identifying leads and filing, of photographs produced hy the several bases,

B, Photographic Techniques - The previous LIEMPTY Project Renewal
Request indicared that the Station planned to try new techniques using
HY-PAN film in night photography, HY-PAN film was used on a trial
basis during daylight hours with poor results, Almost invariably, prints

SECRET /OG

\



14-00000

SECRET/#r

-10-

from HY-PAN negatives were too grainy and, consequently, were of
little use in producing good identified shots of individuals, In view
of these experiments, night photography has not yet been attempted, |
It should be noted that Eastman Kodak's new TRI-X PAN film, which

all bases and LIENTRAP now use, is superior to any film previously

used by the Station for clandestine photography. The quality of all

base photographs have been increased considerably as.a direct result

of this new film. 7

C. General Comments - The Station believes that the GERENDE i
segment is now operating under optimum organizational arrangments H
and there are no plans for expansion contemplated at this time. It is
expected that SCANTLING will soon be relieved of his. interim
responsibility for the LIJERSEY team and can concentrate more on his
investigative and casing activities. The transfer of the LITERSEY team

a0 to Project LITEMPO reduced Project LIEMPTY activities by an
appreciable amount, It is not planned, during the coming year, to
expand present LIEMPTY activities,

Vi COSTS

A. Past Project Year - Station finance records indicate that Project
LIEMPTY expended $19, 120,91 during Fiscal Year 1960 (1 December
1959 - 30 June 1960) and has thus far during Fiscal Year 1961 (through
31 October 1960) expended $16, 734.69. Contract Agents salaries and
allowances paid by Headquarters bring the total expenditures for 11
months of the project year to approximately $50,000.00. An additional
$4, 000, 00 will be obligated during the 12th month of the project year,
‘This will bring total project expenditures to about $54, 000.00 for the
entire project year,

B._ Ensuing Period ~- Of the total $53,000.00 budget, itemized below, ®
$31, 900, 00 should be expended during the remainder of Fiscal Year '
1961 and the balance, $2l, 100,00, should be expended during Fiscal /
Year 1962, Normal accounting procedures will be.used for all :
expenditures, ;

Vil. EMERGENCY CONDITIONS

As regards the requirement listed in CSI-F No, 230-60, Annex A, for
communications arrangments in the event of "Emergency Conditions."

he Station coes not anticipate that this project would or could continue
to function under its present objectives, However, both ¢ cipal
agents, SCANTLING and GERENDE, would very possibly be worthwhile
sources of information to maintain contact with under any adverse
conditions, Both of these agents identify themselfs, iw terms of
ideology, motivation and perspective, more as Americans than as
Mexican nationals (which they are), it is reasonable to assume, there-
fore, that SCANTLING and GERENDE would become valuable contacts
in any emergency situation.
