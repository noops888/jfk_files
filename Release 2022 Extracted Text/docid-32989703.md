The Subject spoke on the topic "The Red University". He

defined the Red University as a term used by the

European left in attempting to analyze and give form to

what should take place on the various bourgeoise campuses

in Europe. According to the source, one of the points

brought up was the theory of instant revolution, that'is,

that revolution in the U.S. is imminent and that everyone

should arm themselves immediately and begin planning

to

take over the government. CAMEJO characterized this as

nonsense, since he felt that the overwhelming power in the

country is presently in the hands of the ruling class. He

stated that the ruling class numbered about 28,000, who

dictate and manipulate the lives of the remaining 200

million people in the country.

CAMEJO stated the the theory

that revolution could take place in the next few days was

completely absurd. According to the source, the crux of

his presentation was that the manner in which society will

be changed from capitalism to socialism will be feasible

only when the masses of people are indoctrinated and

educated into changing their minds about the present system,

and that this would take a long period of time.

worked for poor wages for so long and productivity was taken

out of their sweat and that they

were thus justified in

(Mount Clipping in Spoco Balow)

BERKELEY, Calif. -Peter Camejo, a

spokesman for the Socialist Workers Party

who just returned from a three-month visit

to Cuba, addressed an overflow meeting of

250 at Dwinelle Hall at the University of

California here April 4.

The discussion at the meeting centered in

large part on the SWP's disagreement with

the Cuban leadership on the invasion of

Czechoslovakia (which the Cubans criti-

cally endorsed and the SWP opposed) and

on the SWP view on the need for the de-

velopment of structured workers' demo-

cracy in Cuba. From the lengthy discus-

sion, it was apparent that the great major-

Ity favored the SWP position of supporting

the Cuban revolutionary government while

presenting its own independent and, in some

cases differing, views on various issues.

The previous day, Camejo spoke on the

achlevements of the Cuban Revolution to

a rally of 500 students in the Sproul Steps

free-speech area. Every Bay Area TV sta-

tion and several radio stations covered this

meeting.

On the initiative of the Young Socialist

Alliance, the Berkeley Independent Socialist

Club, which holds that the Castro regime

is reactionary, has agreed to an open de-

bate of the Cuban question. The debate will

se held on May 9 at the University

of

California. .

"Conspiracy"

trial pushed

in Berkeley

BERKELEY, April 12 - The March 27

acquittal of the Oakland 7 on felony charges

of "conspiring to commit a misdemeanor"

was an important victory for the antiwar

movement. What was involved was the de-

feat of a-law deviously contrived to stifle

the rights of free speech, belief and assem-

bly.

In spite of this favorable ruling, the Ala-

meda County District Attorney, J. Frank

oakley, is now preparing to use the same!

law against the Berkely Three— PaulGlus-.

man, Peter Camejo and Jack Bloom. Onl

May 26, the three, who are representatives !

of the Students for a Democratic Society,

the Young Socialist Alliance, and the In-

/ dependent Socialist Club respectively, come

to trial under charges arising from the

October 1968 Moses Hall sit-in at the Uni-

versity of California. The sit-in was aimed

at the board of regents' refusal to grant

credit for a faculty-approved course in

which Eldridge Cleaver was to be the main

lecturer.

During the three days of protest, 198

• people were arrested, 76 for the occupation

of Moses Hall. The Berkeley Three were

singled out and charged with "conspiracy

to commit a misdemeanor," which is a

felony with a penalty of three years in jail

and a $5,000 fine. The other 195 were

found guilty of trespass with a maximum

penalty of 10 days and a $300 fine. The

actual acts cited against the three defen-

dants are speeches at a mass public rally,

and the chairing of an open meeting.

According to the conspiracy law, if a

misdemeanor is committed during a dem-

Constration, the leaders of that demonstra-

tion can be indicted on a felony charge-

" conspiracy to commit the misdemeanor."

The "conspirators" do not have to havead-

vocated committing the misdemeanor, nor

do they have to be present or commit it

themselves. All that is necessary is thatthey

organize or help organize the demonstra-

tion.

The Kerkeles Three Defense Committee

has been formed to raise funds and solicit

support for the Berkeley Three. The Com-

mittee, headed by Professqr Franz Schur-

mann, chairman, and Professor Troy Dus-

ter, treasurer, has already enlisted a large

number of sponsors in support of the dea

Kense.

eley Defense Committee, 2158 Emerson St.,,

"*I believe the whole intellectual community will

join in this way of expressing hostility to the

war,' he said.

"Student committees will be set up on every major

university campus to conduct the strike and their

operations will be coordinated by the Student

The April 15, 1968 issue of "The Militant" contained

an article reporting a gun battle between members of the

Black Panther Party (BPP) and the Oakland, California Police

Department in April, 1968.

The article reponted that BOBBY

JAlES HUTTON, a BPP member, was killed in the gunfight.

The article quoted PETER CANEJO as saying, "It is very clear

that BOBBY JAMES HUTTON was assassinated by the Oakland cops.

This is a case of vut-and-out murder, just like Dr. KING's

murder in Memphis, only in this case

it was done by the cops.

HUTTON's murder clearly demonstrates the immediate need to

remove all cops from the ghettos

and to replace them with

democratically controlled, deputized ghetto residents, who

would protect instead of brutalize Afro-Americans."

The "Guide to Subversive Organizations and Publications,"

revised and published as of December 1, 1961, prepared and

released by the Committee on Un-American Activities, United

States House of Representatives, Washington, D. C.,

contains

the following concerning the "National Guardian":

"1.

... 'established by the American Labor Party in

1947 as a

"progressive" weekly...it has manifested itself from

the beginning as a virtual official propaganda arm of Soviet

Russia."

The February 3,

•1968, issue of the "National Guardian"

announced that as of the

issue

of February 10, 1968, the "National

Guardian"

would henceforth be known as the "Guardian."

The February 10, 1968, issue of the "Guardian" is

self-described as an

"independent radical newsweekly" and is

published by weekly Guardian Associates, Incorporated.

The

'Guardian" lists its address as 197 East Fourth Street, New

York City, New York.

The February 12, 1968, issue of the "New York Times"

carried an article entitled "Radical Editors Say Their Job Is

In 'Movement'

• 11

This article stated that the first issue of the

"Guardian" was dedicated by the paper's staff "To those heroic

Liberation fighters who last week began a major offensive

against

American Imperialism

in South Vietnam."

This article quoted one of the editors as saying that

"Our job is to build a radical movement.

To quote the Cuban

revolutionaries, we are not only to write about it, but also

to move along with it--we are movement people acting as

journalists.

"The 'Guardian' takes a strong left position, but it

is not identified with

any organized group because it believes

that an American left ideology is still in the making. One of

its purposes is to break away from the cliches of the left

ideology of the past."

This article concluded by stating that the "Guardian"

is considered the largest radical weekly in America.
