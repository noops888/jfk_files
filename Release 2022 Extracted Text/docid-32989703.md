«Basically, there are two wrongattitudes|
taken toward militant black organizations-
like the Panthers,"’ Camejo said,

“It’s wrong to oppose them, and it's wrong,
to think that the role of revolutionary
whites {s only to support black groups

Berkeley radicals ‘'patronize"’ the Black

“Our attitude," he said, ‘is that we'd

create confusion over power fights.

"We see a gradual process of dialog

the situation at the University of California Campus in Berkeley.
He stated he expected to be suspended as a student for his
activities on the campus and that he expected that if this
happened, the students would begin a strike or perhaps take
even more militant action. In this regard, he stated that
no Young Socialist Alliance members would be permitted to
be arrested if at all possible and that if anyone was to be
arrested or suspended that he would be the one since he is already
about to be suspended and therefore has nothing else to lose.

The Subject spoke on the topic "The Red University". He
defined the Red University as a term used by the

European left in attempting to analyze and give form to
what should take place on the various bourgeoise campuses
in Europe. According to the source, one of the points
brought up was the theory of instant revolution, that‘is,
that revolution in the U.S. is imminent and that everyone
should arm themselves immediately and begin planning to
take over the government. CAMEJO characterized this as
nonsense, since he felt that the overwhelming power in the
country is presently in the hands of the ruling class. He
stated that the ruling class numbered about 28,000, who
dictate and manipulate the lives of the remaining 200
million people in the country. CAMEJO stated the the theory
that revolution could take place in the next few days was
completely absurd. According to the source, the crux of
his presentation was that the manner in which society will
be changed from capitalism to socialism will be feasible
only when the masses of people are indoctrinated and
educated into changing their minds about the present system,
and that this would take a long period of time.

A characterization of the "Militant"

"PETER CAMEJO, running for mayor on the
Socialist Workers Party ticket, sees Berkeley's
problems in a state and national context ‘|
in keeping with his desire to see the entire “4
economy change to socialism. {

"CAMEJO said Berkeley's problems are
"housing, discrimination, and unemployment like
all American cities,' and ‘cannot be solved within
eity limits alone.' :

"The University of California student said
his party is running 'an educational campaign,'
to raise the idea of ‘independent political action
by working people who are not now represented by
the Democratic or Republican parties'.

"He acknowledged the SWP is part of the
worldwide Communist movement and is ‘sympathetic!
to Communist groups in other countries.

"'We are Communists in that we favor a comnunal
society' CAMEJO said, a society he said, where
there would be ‘political and economic equality.'

"'We are also running as socialists to break
down the stifling atmosphere in which socialist
ideas are taboo and because we want to discuss
the whole economic system,' CAMEJO continued.

"He said the SWP call themselves ‘socialist!
and not 'Communists' because 'there is so much

confusion about the worg Communists.' eroney

"If elected, CAMEJO would institute
preferential hiring for Negroes ‘to make up for
preferential treatment of whites,’ would 'protect
everyone's civil liberties;' and would hold a
referendum on the Vietnam war, which the SWP
opposes. 7 ‘

‘Human Rights First!

"'Generally, we would use whatever means
are available at the city level to aid those
who are worse off -- in other worlds, we would
put human rights over property rights,' CAMEJO
said.

"CAMEJO, 27, said he joined the SWP when he
was 19. 'I've always been interested in science,
and I believe society should be organized in
a selentific way,' he said. 7

"CAMEJO studied at Massachusetts Institute
of Technology before coming to UC where ha is
majoring in history. He is married and resides
at 2418 1/2 Roosevelt Ave."

A verified statement of the Subject relating to
his campaign as a candidate for Mayor of Berkeley in the
General Municipal Election held on April 4, 1967, was.
subscribed and sworn to on February 7, 1967 before EDYTHE
CAMPBELL, City Clerk of Bekreley. This statement reads
as follows:

"I, PETER CAMEJO, hereby declare that I am a candidate

for an elective office in the City of Berkeley, and make the
following statements, to-wit:

1. That my name is PETER CAMEJO. i
2. The office for which I am a candidate is Mayor.
3. That my residence is 2418 1/2 Roosevelt.

5. My present occupation is Student.
6. I have held the following public offices: None.
.7. I ama taxpayer in the City of Berkeley.

8. How ean city problems be solved if the wealth
of the nation is being siphoned off for the Vietnam war?

“While the rich make new millions in war contracts
6,000 people in Berkeley live below the poverty line. Working
people are threatened with a national 'war tax' and college
students are faced with tuition fees making it harder for
working people togt an education. Education and an end
to poverty must come before the profits of the rich. To
solve financial crises let Sacramento and Washington place a :
100% tax on war profits. :

"The present Mayor and City Council have gone on
record in support of the brutal, racist war in Vietnam. They
refused my request and the request of others to allow Berkeley
voters to state their opinion on the Vietnam war at the City
election. We should get out of Vietnam.

"A wealthy few profit from war, racism and
exploitation. They control the Democratic and Republican
parties. Their politicians should be replaced by a government
representing workers, Negroes and other minorities. For that
reason I favor the formation of a labor party and independent
Negro political action.

"Vote for a democratic, socialist America."

7 The April 6, 1967 issue of the "Berkeley Daily

PETER CAMEJO was the main speaker at a "special

Detroit, Michigan, on August 3, 1968. CAMEJO spoke reparding
the Berkeley disturbances and used charts detailing the
situation of the Berkeley disturbances and indicating the
tactics used by the police. He indicated that the Berkeley
Police attacked citizens who were nerely standing by observing.
He stated that the entire series of provocations to the
violence which occurred was organized, planned, and started
by the police themselves. CAMEJO listed a set of ideas which
were important when considering such revolutionary activities
as support for the French riots and demonstrations in general.
The first important step is to know when to stop. He stated
that you stop and give the police the right to make fools
of themselves. He stated that you should be concise in
everything you say and do and never back down. He stated
that demonstrators should always expect the police to use
red-baiting tactics against you. CAMEJO explained the meaning
of Red Flags as carried in Berkeley, some of which were dis-
played around the room. He stated that the Red Flag is not

to the protesting student movements and protestors throughout
the world. It is a symbol of the rebellion of the oppressed
people and should become a symbol for the struggle for free-
dom. He stated, "once the police shoot, you can do little.

Do your thing against the police and revolutionize now. You
will stand with millions of others world-wide, ready, willing,
and able to overthrow oppressors."

Berkeley strategy and tactics used during recent Berkeley
demonstrations. He stated that in advance, demonstrators
should obtain all possible permits. He stated that the
demands must be clear. He stated that great stress must be
placed on the word “convince” with some special meaning

the City Council is to have banks’ and large businesses find
their windows broken. Then they go to the Chamber of Commerce
who in turn convinces the Mayor who convinces the Council.

the violence but they should point out that there was. no

August 8, 1968 at the Illini Union, University of Illinois,
on the *Battle of Berkeley." He stated that persistence
and willingness to fight during the stydent-police confront-
ations. at Berkeley forced a change of public opinion toward
the students'. cause and capitulation by the Berkeley City
Council on the legality of student demonstrations. He
stated that there are two types of people in this country,

:, those who run the country and those who think they run the
country. He stated that the ruling class, which is interested
only in profit and personal property can continue to rule
only as leng as the others believe the country is run by
the people. CAMEJO stated that the ruling class must be
taught by a mass movement for reform. Although not yet
socialistic, he said that student movements across the
country and throughout the verld are pragmatic, empirical
and increasing the people's understanding of their society.

In the recent street battles in Berkeley,
two different ‘approaches developed
among the demonstrators, eventually

One view was commonly associated

: ‘The YSA position emphasizes making the

The opposing view expressed the
desire’ to fight through small guerrilla
groups. They tended to object to mass
meetings and refused to abide by their
decisions. They eventually walked out of

“We held five mass decision-making’ -

council reverses its vote. ‘Thus the meet
ing was only to work out final plans for
July 4 and also a general discussion was
held. Ultra-ieftists held a meeting outside
‘with 50 people attending.

| What emazes me is the Guardien's
‘sympathy for the views of the ultra-
jeftists and the distortions of fact and

omissions which giye the impression the’
ultraleftists were a majority.

For instance, Randy Furst, a Guardian
staff correspondent, writing in the July
13 issue, refers to the “100 dissidents
(who) walked out” but fails to mention
how many (2,000) remained behind.
Referring to those remaining, Furst
states, ‘‘The iiberals had won.” Liberals
calling for a s confrontation with, ie
police? Some tiberals!

iThe Guardian implies that my presen-
tavion to the city council was unpopular
among the radicals. According to Randy
Furst, “Radicals chided SWP leader Peter
Camejo for negotiating with the city
council...” Anyone present at the city

council meeting will recall the standing |
-ovation I received from the 1,000 or so

activists present when I finished my
presentation. To my knowledge no “radi-
cal” except the Guardian writer ever
“chided” me for that presentation. But
even worse, the Guardian attacks the rank
and file Young Socialists who throughout
faithfully carried out the decisions of the

mass meetings. “Political a began”

someone else,

Cuba has gone far towardcreat=

can use,” Pete found, The mfni-

and next year rent will be free
also.

Quotas allow people to get en~
ough clothing and food, which are
priced very cheaply. All workers
get a month’s vacation, during
which most go to resorts which
Pete described as both beautiful
and cheap.

So Pete found Cuba to be a
society in which no worker is
short for bread, This makes for a
few changes. ‘Riding busses, you
don’t have to put in the nickal,
nobody cares, Nobody robs--whkat
are you going to rob for?’*

‘The concepts guiding the furth

BERKELEY, Calif.—Peter Camejo, a
spokesman for the Socialist Workers Party
who just returned from a three-month visit
to Cuba, addressed an overflow meeting of
260 at Dwinelle Hall at the University of babies

., California here April 4.

* ‘The discussion at the meeting centered in
large part on the SWP's disagreement with
the Cuban leadership on the invasion of
Czechoslovakia (which the Cubans criti-

. cally endorsed and the SWP opposed) and
7 on the SWP view on the need for the de-
7 velopment of structured workers’ demo-
cracy in Cuba. From the lengthy discus-
sion, it was apparent that the great major-
ity favored the SWP position of supporting
the Cuban revolutionary government while
presenting its own independent and, insome
cases differing, views on various Issues.

» . The previous day, Camejo spoke on the
achievements of the Cuban Revolution to
a rally of 500 students in the Sproul Steps
free-speech area. Every Bay Area TV sta-
tion and several radio stations covered this
meeting.

On the initiative of the Young Socialist
Alliance, the Berkeley Independent Socialist
A Club, which holds that the Castro regime
is reactionary, has agreed to an open de-
bate of the Cuban question. The debate will
held on May 9 at the University

speaker likened the persecution

coiicerning the recommended sus-
pensions of eleven cited students,
but in reality about the larger is-
sue of political freedom on col-

resulted not from the violation of
campus rules concerning the use

: PETER CAMEJO, stating that he represented a

Califcrnia City Council on June 25, 1968 to state that a
rally to protest "opposition against our movement in France"
would be held on June 28, 1968 on Telegraph Avenue, Berkeley.
CAMEJG stated that interference by police would inevitably ~
result in a riot. Refusal of the Berkeley City Council

to condone the demonstrations resulted in three evenings

of rioting on June 28, 28, and 30, 1968. Throughout the*
unrest, CAMEJO acted as one of the college spokesmen for

the demonstrators and although not a member of YSA, repre-
sented himself as a spokesman for the YSA.

Berkeley City Manager, WILLIAM HANLEY, declared
the city of Berkeley a civil disaster area on September 2,
1968 after several disturbances erupted into violence over
the weekend of August 36-September 1, 1968. The proclamation
issued by the City Manager banned public assemblies and
loitering on the streds of Berkeley. _ Persons violation this
ban were subject to arrest. PETER CAMEJO was one of the
leaders of a group of approximately 150 people who formed
a ‘picket line in front of the, Berkeley City Hall on Sept-
ember 6, 1968. CAMEJO addressed the crowd and spoke in
opposition to the curfew imposed by the city of Berkeley.

ONE OF the panelists, the
Rev. Raymond Jennings. of First
Baptist Church and a director

Hanley why Camejo had not
been arrested for
assembly if the reason police
moved against persons con-
ducting the June 23 rally was
because of violation of unlawful
assembly ordinances.

“There was no action by Mr.
Camejo himself that contained
the elements of unlawful
jassembly,” Hanley said.
[sCamejo carefully extracted
ljaimself from an illegal position.

‘the situation “Mr, Camejo was

“Conspiracy”

—__— trial pushed
in Berkeley

BERKELEY, April 12—The March 27 ima
acquittal of the Oakland 7 on felony charges
of “conspiring to commit a misdemeanor”
was an important victory for the antiwar
movement. What was involved was the de-
feat of a-law deviously contrived to stifle a
bea rights of free speech, belief and assem- 7

ly.

In spite of this favorable ruling, the Ala- A
meda County District Attorney, J. Frank i
Coakley, is now preparing to use the same :
law against the Berkely Three— Paul Glus-| tf
man, Peter Camejo and Jack Bloom. On! :
May 26, the three, who are representatives
of the Students for a Democratic Society,
the Young Socialist Alliance, and the In-
dependent Socialist Club respectively, come .
to trial under charges arising from the
October 1968 Moses Hall sit-in at the Uni-
versity of California. The sit-in was aimed
at the board of regents’ refusal to grant
credit for a faculty-approved course in a .
which Eldridge Cleaver was to be themain . _
lecturer. ts i

During the three days of protest, 198

+ people were arrested, 76 for the occupation
of Moses Hall. The Berkeley Three were
singled out and charged with "conspiracy
to commit a misdemeanor," which is a
felony with a penalty of three years in jail is
and a $5,000 fine. The other 195 were .
found guilty of trespass with a maximum : Z
penalty of 10 days and a $300 fine. The o 4
actual acts cited against the three defen-
dants are speeches at a mass public rally, °
fand the chairing of an open meeting. i

According to the conspiracy law, if a H
misdemeanor is committed during a dem- A

nstration, the leaders of that demonstra- i
tion can be indicted on a felony charge— i
conspiracy to commit the misdemeanor.”

‘The "conspirators" do not have to have ad- i

| vocated committing the misdemeanor, nor 4
do they have to be present or commit it | !

The February 13, 1968 issue of the "Daily Califor-
nian" contained an article indicating that PETER CAMEJO
was suspended from the University of California for three
quarters for his actions in the October, 1967 "Stop the.
Draft Week" activiti

Ss.

The February 24, 1968 issue of the "Seattle Times",
a newspaper published in Seattle, Washington, contained an
article captioned, "Public Invited to Viet Nam Teach-In."
The article announced a teach-in at the University of Wash-
ington, Seattle, on March 1, 1968, and listed PETER CAMEJO
as one of the speakers.

PETER CAMEJO was one of the main speakers ata rally
held at Pauley Ballroom, Student Union Building, University
of California, Berkeley, on April 1, 1968, in support of
the National Liberation Front of South Viet Nam. CAMEJO stated
that there was a conspiracy in Washington, D.C. who called for
those present to stand on their feet against the capitalist
ruling class.

‘The April 15, 1968 issue’ of "The Militant" contained
an article reporting a gun battle between members of the
Black Panther Party (BPP) and the Oakland, California Police
Department in April, 1968. The article reported that BOBBY '
JAMES HUTTON, a BPP member, was killed in the gunfight.

The article quoted PETER CAMEJO as saying, "It is very clear
that BOBBY JAMES HUTTON was aseassinated by the Oakland cops.
This is a case of out-and-out murder, just like Dr. KING's
murder in Memphis, only in this case it was done by the cops.
HUITON's murder clearly demonstrates the immediate need to
remove all cops from the ghettos and to replace them with
democratically controlled, deputized ghetto residents, who
would protect instead of brutalize Afro-Americans."

“GUARDIAN ," FORMERLY KNOWN AS "NATIONAL GUARDIAN";
WEEKLY GUARDIAN ASSOCIATES, INCORPQRATED

The "Guide to Subversive Organizations and Publications,"
vevised and published as of December 1, 1961, prepared and
released by the Committee on Un-. American Activities, United
States House of Representatives, Washington, D. C., contains
the following concerning the "National Guardian": i

"1. ...'established by the American Labor Party in
1847 as a "progressive" weekly...it has manifested itself from
the beginning as a virtual official propaganda arm of Soviet
Russia."

The February 3, 1968, issue of the "National Guardian"
announced that as of the issue of February 10, 1968, the “National
Guardian" would henceforth be known as the "Guardian."

The February 10, 1968, issue of the "Guardian" is
self-described as an "independent radical newsweekly” and is
published by Weekly Guardian Associates, Incorporated. The
"Guardian" lists its address as 197 East Fourth Street, New
York City, New York.

The February 12, 1968, issue of the "New York Times"
earried an article entitled "Radical Editors Say Their Job Is
In 'Movement!." This article stated that the first issue of the
"Guardian" was dedicated by the paper's staff "To those heroic
Liberation fighters who last week began a major offensive against
American Imperialism in South Vietnam."

This article quoted one of the editors as saying that
“Our job is to build a radical movement. To quote the Cuban
revolutionaries, we are not only to write about it, but also
to move along with it--we are movement people acting as
journalists.

"The 'Guardian' takes a strong left position, but it
is not identified with any organized group because it believes
that an American left ideology is still in the making. One of
its purposes is to break away from the cliches of the left
ideology of the past."

This article concluded by stating that the "Guardian"
is considered the largest radical weekly in America.

Socialist Workers Party speakers.

This same source, on September 29, 1959, stated that
JIM CHRISTIANSON, in September, 1959, stated that the members

"PETER CAMEJO, running fcr mayor on the
Socialist Workers Party ticket, sees Berkeley's
problems in a state and national context !
in keeping with his desire to see the entire
economy change to socialism. ~

“CAMEJO said Berkeley's problems are
"housing, discrimination, end unemployment like
all American cities,' and 'cannot be solved within
city limits alone.'

v
"The University of California student said.
his party is running 'an educational campaign,'
to raise the idea of ‘independent political action
by working people who are not now represented by
the Democratic or Republican parties'. Uy

i “He acknowledged the SWP is part of the
7 worldwide Communist movement and is ‘sympathetic!
to Communist groups in other countries.

"'We are Communists in that we favor a communal
society' CAMEJO said, a society he said, where
there would be ‘political and economic equality.!

"We are also running as socialists to break
down the stifling atmosphere in which socialist
ideas are taboo and because we want to discuss
the whole economic system,' CAMEJO continued.

"He said the SWP call themselves ‘socialist!

and not 'Communists' because 'there is so much \
confusion about the mesiad Communists.'

opposes.

‘Human Rights First!

"'Generally, we would use whatever means
are available at the city’level to aid those
who are worse off -- in other worlds, we would
put human rights over property rights,' CAMEJO
said.

"“CAMEJO, 27, said he joined the SWP when he
was 19. ‘I've always been interested in science,
and I believe society should be organized in

-a scientific way,' he said.

"CAMEJO studied at Massachusetts Institute
of Technology before coming to UC where he is
majoring in history. He is married and resides ‘j
at 2418 1/2 Roosevelt Ave." oy
