things that has impressed me most during my nine months as Chief of the Counter-

Government comparable to it. With the current intensification of interest in
Counterintelligence, it affords the tency a means of speaking to a wide audience

Im addition to his research abilities, Subject is a highly effective -

In the past six months the compartmonted nature of Mr. Wigren's work

such he'répresents a considerable capital investment by the Agency in that kind

f expertise. He can write and he can speak with unugual fluency on his specialty

work is directed, as

A key responsibility in R&A is lo serve/the Stafl'y repository and memory

this abundance of material effectively, has ensured its retrievability, and con-

tinues to update it,

Mr, Wigren consistently shows sound and dispassionate judgment, He does
not jump to conclusions but digs out the pertinent facts and brings them into
Proper focus, He is skeptical without being negative, He accepts tasks and
responsibilities without quibbling, and he carries out these assignments suc-
cessfully without needing further consultation or guidance,

He’ is a quict person who keeps a low profile; but whén a significant issue

Mr. Wigren is a solid methodical rescarcher and analyst.
He possess developed skills in presentation both in writing
and from the platform. -He works quietly and effectively
with a minimum of supervision required once the job has becn
blocked out. He is a most dependable and consistently productive,

He is overly modest in personal demeanor and tends to

prefer to concentrate his efforts on singhe tasks rather than to handle
@ range of simultancous undertakings.

sn

Mr. Wigren is a conscientious and capable research officer
with a good grasp of his ‘material ‘and is able "éllpiugwent it
effectively to audiences of widely varicd sophistication. Since
his last report, \the basic orientation of SR/CI has changed, and 4s
now directed almost wholly to the creation and cxploitation of opera-
tions. Thé organization thus needs more urgently than ever the
digested operational experience which it is Nr. Wigren's job to
produce. This has made it.tiecessary. to apply strict priorities

. based: on operational need and relevancy, which has been difficult
for My. Wigren, who has no direct operational experience. He
has not been able to get the most out of his people, nor give them
the sort of close .and consistent guidance which some of them require
in the face of changing or sudden requirements. le has a tendency
to be over-concerned with’ organizational and bureaucratic exercise
to the expense of substantive production. Nonetheless, his reat
qualities came to the fore recently when he produced well and used
his staff effectively on an important and complicated project
He is a distinct asset in his responsible and demanding job.

Mr. Ulgren 16 extremely proficient in handling fis section from both the”
personnel and managerial standpoints. In addition, he. {s an cxpert on Soviet
Tntellivence in his own right and lectures on the tezic to officials of this
and other governments. He 1s particularly capatle at training new rescarchers.

In reviewing his file today, I note that the Reviewing Official for his
fitness report of a ycar ago noted his opinion that my ratings of Mr. Wigren at
that time were too high. That opinion was not discuzzed with me or with
Mr. Wigreri. Perhaps the ratings were indeed too high, wut I must say that
considering the Fitness Report form and criteria in use at that time and nis
verformance tn relation to that of other officers in this branch ani outside it,
I would give him the sam ratings teday tor that period.

The ratings in this current report vill apyear lightly lower than thoze 3
of the last report. This is not entirely due to tre different report form.
Mr. Wigren's problems increased in both intensity ard complexity during this
period, and I dd,‘not feel that he met the increas: wurden with as much of an

increase in performance as vas necessary. This should not at all det from

ection». i

Mr. Wigren has excellent substantive b: ground on the Soviet Unior
except for a two year period on'a WE operations desk, has devoted his entire
9 yea in the Agency to research on Soviet Intelligence in one way or another,
His performance for the past year ina job formerly held by GS-14's and 15's
can only be described'as superior.. He has not only assumed responsibilities
greater than those of the previous incumbents; he his carried these out with

a minimum of support and ina calm, mature manner which has earned
respect on all sides. Although his analysts have often been relatively
inexperienced, he has geared their assignments to their capabilities and
subjects designed to increase their competence. His most important contri-
bution during this period has been in the formation of an organized plan of
research in response to Agency and external requirements, and the establish-
ment of improved records and procedures to carry out ‘this program,

Although Mr. Wigren would Prefer eventual assignment to the field as an

Ihave discussed this report, aad hte general situation, in considerable detail with |

officers (I had two officera work together lao that capatity), but felt—that a rating
f 3 under specific duty Mo.2 did not do him. justice. I think hetfight on this score
jand would reise that rating to a 4. I would say thore haa been an improvemmnt in Mr.

2. For the Reviewing Official (continued).

Mr. Wigren has also asked that it bo made a matter of record that, for
a period of three months in. 1956, ho wao acting chief of the
and handled these recponaibilities effectively. I havo agreed to cite tho
extent of his responsibilitins. Cortainly the, routiao business of the
desk was kept moving. during this period. I have pointod out with respect
to the maaier-of hie performance of hig duties that his fitness report Lo not
an unfavorable ono. The factore which have turned thie annual fitneso
roport into a porsonal crisie for him-are tho eimultancous deferment of

“his hopsd-for promotion, and the deferment of an ovorseas assignmont for

him -+ both.of which actions naturally reflect on his past performances
T have pointed out that we have to requiro aprruciably bettor than
average performancen from officers we send oversoas, that I bolieve wo
have in the Branch at leest one bettor qualifiod candidate for tho
overseas ascignmont in question, and that I am obliged to give the
aosignuont to the porson-I fool 19 boot qualified.

Porhapa understandably, Kr. Wigren continues to bolieve that this
report 1a not a fair reflection of his performance, I have told him
that Ican go no further in attompting to oxplain my judgement and have
asked that he disouss hie situation with the Deputy Diviaion Chief
and/or the Division Chief. He agreed to do ao.
