MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD ns

SUBJECT: Relations with Aianolo RAY and the MRP

1, “For background see my memorandum of ld May 1961, feporting on
my long session with Manolo RAY, Rogelio CISNEROS (Eugenio) and Ernesto
BETANCOURT. Ae will be noted in that memorandum, Manolo promised to
come up vith a prospectus within approaimately ten days" time, after con- ei a
sulting with bie leaders in Cuba. :

On} June 1961 Mr, Barnes called me to say that Mr. Goodwin had
been visited by Mr. Ernesto BETANCOURT who asked for Immediate financial
support for certain activities of the MRP which would run around $16, COG

asked moto contact BETANCOURT for the purpose of
aneeded, ete,

dollars. Mr. Barns

ancertaining what the funde were to be used for, exactly how miu

I called BETANCOURT and he told me that | should get these ‘details from
CISNEROS (Eugenio), who was staying at room 549 at tha Washington Hotel.

Icailed Eugenio end made a date for me and Ray DuBola (Ray Adams is the

naine he-uses with Ray and Claneroe) to call upon him, We called on CISNEROS

at approximately 14+5 hours | June, and he informed ua that he had urgent

need for pesoa for use in support of his eadotage end underground ecvivities

in Cuba, Ha said his peopte were absolutely without funds, needed money for

living expenses, transportation purchase of sabotage equipment, atc fares for

couriers, and for aesisting people to yet out of prison, He said that it was

now possible for people to buy thelr way out of prisoa by bribing one of the

many “coinmunist’ lawyers and ‘judges. He thought that iv, 000 or Su, Ue

would meet immediate needs and that some sort of arrangement should be mada

to receive funda - 3, CO monthly or thereabouts - on a ilacd and permanent H

basis.

3. We mada no commitment to Eugenio other than to say that we would
pasa hia plea along tc the interested veopie. I reniinded him that we had asked
him and. sanolto to prepare a plan for consideration and that we were still
waiting for that plan. I said J personally doubted that anything could be done
unill the plan was received from RAY. He said Manolo was planning to come to
Washington on the afternoon of j June with the plan, but that he himself vas
having to return to Miami immediately and it was vital he be abla to take the
money with bins arrange in stiand fur purchase of the poses (at rato of 4 V1 -

money already in Cuba - dollars would be delivered to ownere of the pesos who
are in t4tomi). Ttold’hins ft would call hin in the morning to ter hint coon how

things- stood.

3. 1 diacusoed our meeting with CISNEROS with Tracy Barnes on the
moralag of < June. It was Tracy's opinion, in which I heartily concur, that
we ehould put out-no money whatsoever until we have hada chance to examine
lan.and to study juet what repercussions or ramifications there
er escnn Policy -wiee and otherwise, 10 a decision fo avelat the MRP
unilaterally; that outside the Counci? snd presumably without MIRO's
Knowledge or consent. ‘Since RAY has withdrawn his group from the Council
with a great deal of fanfare, tt 1a most unltkely that MIAO woata look kindly
‘Of aay aeolstance to RAY, eepecially since he foals he hae a rather firm
Promise from the President to deal only through vIRO.

5. RAY, upon arrival in Waskington, will Preoumably take his plan (along
with BETANCOUR) directly te Mr. Goodwin and I would also presume that
Goodwin will pase tt down to Tracy and Tracy tous, Ray DuBoia, who has
deen Manolo's cane officer, {s standing by in the event he should: be aeeded.

-_&  Upersonally feal very atrongly that we should do nothing to support the
plan, whatever it io, ‘until we have received from the White House and the
Department clear-cut, unequivocal policy guidance on the overall plan, I also
fzel that now Is the Ume, if we are go ing to support the MIU? unilaterally,. to
insert a ron-official cut out into tho operation. I wauld recommend that con-
sideration be given to using Mr. Harry Pieper (a WAVE contract: employee)
on this job, Harry ia tempermentally suited, bas a good buginesa head, ta
fluent in Spanish (lived £8 years in Cuba), is cleared. follows directions,
completely honest and tremendously conscientious. It would be harder to

tind a better person. .

7. Also, 1 would Ike to point out the security riske Inherent in any arrange
mento with the RAY-BETANCOURT-CISNEROS trie. These fellows have had
white House and to the Department, ‘sre notorious for thelr
11 probably preaume all the Department officials they deat
with are privy to the arrangement, and before we know it the whol
sommiunity will be well aware that we are Providing financial and material
Support to the RAY group. I am not arguing against providing such support,
but am merely pointing out the real potential for ainbarrassment to uo if ihe
matter Lo not handled with the greatest of precautions, I feel they have becorne
too closely, identified with U, 5, -officialdom,. includinz imyaelf, and thee the
Piaueible denial aspects, to date at-least, are almout non-existent.
