MISCELLANEOUS - INFORMATION CONCERNING

(ACCOUNTING AND FRAUD SECTION)

Re Bureau airtel to Los Angeles 9/15/61, concerning

Information furnished by Casel

LARE TE

Informant was specifically asked

whether or not he

knew where MATUlA obtained the "bundle," and the informant

replied that he has absolutely no information as to how, when

or where MATULA obtained the

"bundle."

The informant did not relate the circumstances surround-

ing his having carried a half a million dollars in his pocket

nor was he asked to as it was deemed inappropriate at this time

to ask him about this point.

To date the informant has

furnished no information that would personally involve the

informant.

Informant was recontacted on 9/19/61, at which time the

figure of one million dollars was again discussed with informan,

It was pointed out to informant that if MATULA was carrying a

bundle of $100. bills which totaled one million dollars, MATULA

would have had

a stack of approximately 48 inches. Informant

replied by saying that MATULA did not have a stack that large

but was carrying a "bundle" larger than he has ever personally

seen before.

Informant said he was actually shocked by the

size of the

"bundle," and as a result is probably over-estimat-

ing the amount of money being carried.

He noted

MATULA iS

usually a very neat dresser and that the "bundle" was

so large

it actually made MATULA

"orggnant."
