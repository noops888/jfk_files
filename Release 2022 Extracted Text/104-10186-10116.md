a. Imnediate. In accordance with the elements with which the agent
is currently concerned. Explain the work he is to accomplish
and the concrete tasks, if he has been charged with immediate
objectives, Detail in addition all the facts which we can
compile on the connections the agent knows abroad. Classify
them as:

1) Persons with access to information and with whom he will
start his penetration work, (Penetration plans.)

2) Candidates to be recruited by the agent.
3) Family memebers.
4) Relatives without immediate interest.

To obtain these data we must fundamentally make use of the x
agent, and they will be obtained in the course of his
training. We must also use our owa means. This point has
great importance, since these will be the persons of whom they
will take advantage in obtaining iuformation, moving up,

and placing themselves in the desired position. Moreover,

in case any information is acquired about them, if it only
gives us a reference to the person's name, we will know who

is meant, and thus we can avoid a great deal of work for our
comrades abroad, since they will not have to send us these
data and can restrict themselves to current information

about the persons.
