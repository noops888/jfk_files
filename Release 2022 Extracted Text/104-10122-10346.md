on President Sukarno's weakness for women, espacially Caucasian.
Becauss of our inability to get controlled asset close to him to deters
mine his thinking and plans, and the recent. apparent success of
Soviets use of a woman, believed he may let down guard and become
expansive in discussion of plans with a female and accept advice
that ha would not ordinarily accept from a man.

2. Object - Locate inteRigent, attractive, smotionally stable,
and trustworthy female who would accept ussizament which would
involve eventual intimate relationship with Sukarno.

3. January 1958 - Gave Robert Maheu assignment to locate
candidate. He advised that a prominent : attorney and
‘man about town, " we, could come up with a qualified
woman. Maheu told S3gmiiiige be had a "client" whose business vas
not prospsring in an unidentified country. Felt could improve situa-
tion If an attractive and intelligent female could get to him: ane,
through feminine charm, persuade his thinking in 1 more favorable
dizection,

7. August 27 - Joseph Smith, FE Division, introduced to
Maheu as Joseph Sims.

8. Smith emphasized need for a solid cover story and buck-
stopping. Maheu suggests, in view of Samim close rélationship
with movie colony, may induce @jeggaiéa who represents several
™ovie interests, to set up an arrangement that would also include
necessary funding mechanisms. :

9. September 23 - Maheu and O'Connell, Security, met with
CEE in New York City (Hampshire Houses). Agreed, if he co-
operative, would briaf him re Agency interest and objective of
Project to get maximem effort from him. He responded enthu~
siastically and offered his completa Service and facilities te sat up
a Secure cover mechanism. He suggasted that 438 be told of
general Government interest (mot CIA) at the outaet due to her sharp
percyptiveness which may cause her to speculate at a later date,

10. Cover Story - 4g would commissicn her to perform
an "on location survey" in certain FE areas for the proposed filming
of "Journey to the Center of the th." This could be done very
naturally because S w has the
ralghts to the film and is contemplating shooting it in near futere,

11. September 23 - @iiiearrived New York City (St. Regia),
Mahbeu met her alone for firat time and told her of Government inter-
est. She seemed to ba relieved about certain misgivings she had of
assignment. (She knew true identity of Maheu, having been introduced
to him socially by QB. She also knew that he had a personal
relations organization. }

12. September 23 {afternoon) - Mahav introtuced "Sims" to
i. Wes given a gradual briefing on assignment, 4:

aTmiiniwgy at
Fious points whether she was still interosted, She indicated she
untorstood exactly what was expected of her ond coul! leave cogntry
in $3 2sys. =

!3. September 21 - "Sims" again met with @@yat which time
she w2s3 told she would ba accompanied by a femala traveling com-
anion, é (wappesetasnaeases: GS-12). Would osten-
sibly be h-r secretary, but would be, in fact, the v:rson sh» would

16, Records of this Office do not reflect any of the activities

of Si during the courae of har mission, It is believed she left

for Indonesia sometime in Janmary 1959. It is known that she did

meet Sukarno, but dua to unfortunate timing that had him leaving

his country on official business, she had little time to cultivate him;
consequently, the purpose of the mission was not fulfilled. It shonld

be noted that Sukarno took sufficient notice of her that during an ua- -
official visit to the United States in June 1959, he expressed a strong

desire to see her and did. - : |

17. The last known contact 3@Mihad with the agency was in
the form of a telephone call on 12 April 1961 when she called on the
sterile line and talked to Hugh Tovar, who she mew as George Henry.
She advised that 2M@bumaGetae asked her to give a party for Presi-
dent Sukarno who would be in Los Angeles on 21 April 1961. She
wanted to know whether Henry's people were interested in sponsor-
ing this party. A negative response was given.

18, It is not known where she is or what her activities are at
the prosent time, but presumably she is still in the Los tngalss
area.
