The following. summary and analysis is not intended to be
all inclusive, that is to contain a specific comment on all organi-

zational, operational, personality and case type information furnished

“by Yuriy Ivanovich NOSENKO; To attempt to do so would be repetitious

and confusing to the reader and would not be of material benefit in the
formation of logical conclusions concerning the rather limited areas of

primary concern.

Thie summary will not contain a detailed psychological
assessment of NOSENKO nor will it contain’a ¥ecitation of the nurherous
theories which have been-promulgated in the past concerning varying
aspects of the NOSENKO case, This summary will ve primarily
directed toward the question of whether NOSENKO was or was not
dispatched by the KGB, whether his claimed KGB career io relatively
plausible and whether he has since late October 1967 been coopérative in
a-Feassessment of the entire case for or against NOSENKO. NOSENKO
has-admitted certain lies and exaggerations in the past but claims that ©

these were of a personal nature, intended to enhance his own importance

ee ie

oa



a

but not to mislead this Agency in any material matters of an operational
or policy nature, i

In order to avoid any misunderstanding of the phrase "bona
fides" as considered in this summary, NOSENKO will de judged primarily
on whether he voluntarily defected to this Agency without KGB knowledge,
and whetaer his 1962 and early 1964 contacts with eepeeteneeres of this
Agency were known to the KGB. Motivation and certain other pertinent
aspects will be considered, but his admitted previous errors, lies and
exaggerations will not per se warrant a conclusion that NOSENKO is nota
“uona fide" defector.

There is not an accurate standard or scale of measurement
against which information concerning NOSENKO can be balanced or
correlated to determine if he is or is not a dispatched KGB officer. For
purposes of this analysis and summary, an arbitrary list of areas
considered pertinent has been compiled. Readers may differ in regard to
whether this arbitrary standard is a completely accurate standard, but it
is felt that the information from NOSENKO and information from other
sources derived through, independent investigation will permit the reader
to assess the information in toto against any standard he considers
appropriate.

The previous summary on NOSENKO entitled, "The. Exami-
nation of the Bona Fides of a SE CRET “has been considered in

unsupported conclusions in ike previous summary in regard to specific

cases or cub-areas will be included in this summary. However, this

SUMMARY OF DEVELOPMENTS IN NOSENKO CASE

SINCE 30 OCTOBER 1967

Since 30 October 1967, interviews with Yuriy Ivanovich NOSENKO
have been conducted by one individual not previously known personally to
NOSENKO but who has been aware of the NOSENKO case since June 1962.

Interviews have been detailed and very extensive in scope, have
been recorded and transcribed, and have covered the entire life and careez
of NOSENKO without regard to whether a particular aspect had been.
covered during previous interview or interviews,

NOSENKO, although naturally apprehensive during the firet few
interviews, has been cooperative, has developed a relaxed attitude, and
the interviewer has noted no significant reluctance to discuss any aspect
of his life, career, or activities. On occasion NOSENKO has indicated a
reluctance to maxe positive statements in certain areas previously

considered at a minimum extremely controversial. This reluctance

was understandable and when it became apparent to NOSENKO that the

G00L011



Sebrict

interviewer would not dispute or disparage his statements without adequate
reason, this reluctance on the part of NOSENKO, in the opinion of the
interviewer, totaiiy disappeared.

During the interviewing period, particularly in the first 6ix months,
NOSENKO materially assisted the interviewer by preparing approximately
sixty memoranda on such diverse subjects as his life, motivation for de-
fection, individual cases, notes which he furnished to CIA in 1964, KGB
organization, and KGB officer and agent personalities. As an example
of the scope of this work by NOSENKO, four of the memoranda included

ob.
remarke concerning approximately [875|KGB officers, [IOO}KGB agents,
9 45 :GRU officers, and[i00lother Soviet nationals. These liste were alpha-
beticaliy arranged and the above indicated cooperation of NOSENKO has
materially assisted in the organization and evaluation of information
furnished by him during current interviews.
Copies of transcripts of interviews with NOSENKO and related
memoranda have been disseminated to the FBI and the Ci Staff, Special

Agent Elbert Turner and Special Agent James Wooten of the Washington

Field Office/FBI in particular have given great assistance in research

and compilation of new or additional information and the FBI has inter-

viewed or reinterviewed a number of United States citizens concerning

whom NOSENKO has furnished pertinent information,

aaa : In addition, throa professionals from the $B Division have

reviewed tha current information and aselated in the retrieval of

” previous information from NOSENKO and collation of current

information with previous informath-a. The latter {s a tremendous H i u
task because of the volume of material; the number of individual i
cases involved; and the extensive information in regard to KGB :

perscnsiities, procedures, organizational structure and activities.

The BB Diviston elso provided the services of an expert
translator to translate the tapes of the 1965 interrogation of NOSENKD H
by Petr DERYABIN and one of the previctisly mentioned three pro- :
fevotonala completed a new translation of the 1962 interviews with ;

NOSENKO. In addition, transcriptions | of —— other a

pertinent previous interviews of NOSENKO have been completed by I
tho Office of Security. i

Approximately 7000 pages of tranecripts and related material
have been compiled and disseminated since late October 1967. Com-
iments concerning the value of the information contained in the above

material are contained in another section of this cummary. Ao of the

~ . present thne, o complete analysis is not possible since a considerable
i portion of the material has not been fully procesced. In tha preparation |

. of this summary all areas of major significance have been examined.

ANALYTICAL COM:

OF YURI IV



LYTICAL COMMENTS C

YURIY IVANOVICH NOSENKO

As indicated in the introduction to thie summary, information in
‘regard to Yuriy ivanovich NOSENKO will be considered against an arbi-
trary but realistic list of areas considered pertinent to the question of
whether NOSENKO voluntarily defected to this Agency without KGB

knowledge, and whether his. 1962 and early 1964 contacts with represent-

" atives of this Agency were known to the KGB.

It was noted that motivation and certain other pertinent aspects
would:dlso be ‘eonsidezed bur’ that his admitted previous lies and exag-
gerations would not per se warrant a Conclusion that NOSENKO is not a
"bona. fide defector."

The following is a list of the areas considered pertinent and which
are being given specific consideration, Attached is a separate section
containing remarks in regard to the designated areas of A - H.

A. Is NOSENKO identical to the person whom he claims
ete ; to be? :

B. . Is the claimed KGB career of NOSENKO plausible?

’

Has NOSENKO given an acceptable expianation of
his motivation in contacting CIA in 1962 and for his

defection in 1964?

. Is the information furnished by NOSENKO to CIA

concerning KGB operations, personalities, and organi-
zation reasonably commensurate with his claimed KGB
career?

Can the information furnished by NOSENKO be con-
sidered in toto as having resulted in material damage

to the KGB and/or has the information furnished by
NOSENKO been of significant benefit to Western Intelli-
gence? ‘ “

Is there evidence of KGB deception or "give away" in
information furnished by. NOSENKO which would warrant
a conclusion that NOSENKO was dispatched by the KGB?
Is there evidence of a political or any other type objective
which could justify a dispatch of NOSENKO by the KGB
with permission to speak freely to CIA concerning his
knowledge of the KGB and without NOSENKO being given”

a specific mission or missions?

H. Is there any evidence that the contacts of NOSENKO

A. _Is NOSENKO identical to the person whom he claims to be?

During interviews NOSENKO has furnished detailed information in regard
to his family, his activities as a youth, the schools he attended, assoc-
jates of his father and rhother, and his own associates. The period
under consideration in this section is the period preceding his. entry
into the First Department, Second Chief Directorate, MVD, “in mid-
March 1953,

Information furnished by NOSENKO concerning his father and

mother and his early. life, together with other information such as a

_comparison of photographs of NOSENKO and a photograph of his father

and confirmed travel of his mother to Western Europe in 1956 with

_ Madame KOSYGINA, conclusively establish that he is Yuriy Ivanovich

NOSENKO, the son of Ivan Isidorovich NOSENKO, the Minister of Ship-
building in the USSR prior to hig death in 1956. This is also satisiactorily .
supported by personal-type information furnished by NOSENKO concern-~
ing other associates of his father and mother.

Since, as indicated above, there is considered to be no doubt

that Yuriy Ivanovich NOSENKO is the son of the former Minister of

Shipbuilding, a detailed study of his life prior to 1945 {age 18) is of.

. G0UL026



oe

or no value in assessing tie bona fides or non-bona fides of i

NOSENKO. An expose of his youthiul indiscretions, of which he nas

|
admitted a number, is of no import in a discussion of whether NOSENKO |
|

|

was or was not dispatched by the KGB, Obtaining any coilaterai first- |
|

hand information in regard to NOSENKO before 1945 would be of

negligible value, but there actually is supporting i

mation from
Nikolay ARTAMONOV, a defector from the Soviet Navy, concerning

the claimed attendance by NOSENXO at a military-naval preparatory

schoo] in Leningrad,
NOSENKO, during current interviews, has stated that he grad-
ry uated from the Institute of International Relations in 1950 and had

attended the Institute ‘since 1945. He has explained that he should have

graduated in 1949’since it was a four-year course, but failed the iinal |
examination in Marxiem and therefore was required to attend the Institute
for a longer period of time and again take his final examinations. |
Based on information furnished by NOSENKO concerning co-
students and the Institute, there is no reason to doubt that he actually H
attended and graduated from the Institute of International Relations in
1950. The previous controversy in this matter was complicated by

NOSENKO who, in 1964 after his defection, stated in a biography that

- he had graduated from the Institute in 1949, Actually this statement

. 0001027



by NOSENKO in 1964 resulted in conflicting information since NOSENKO
on 9 June 1962 during his first contact with CIA had stated that he : H
“completed the Institute of International Relations in 1950." NOSENKO ott
has given the explanation that he changed the date of hie graduation to : ‘
; 1949 because he did not wish to admit that he had failed to graduate in
1949. NOSENKO explained that this change in his date of graduation
caused him to pre-date his actual entry into Navy Intelligence to 1950
instead of 1951 and his actual entry into the KGB from 1953 to 1952. : a
The above action by NOSENKO is included in what NOSENKO has
characterized as his "stupid blunders," The latter is a rather apt’

©) characterization of his now admitted lies and exaggerations but is not | :

evidence of

” evidence’ that NOSENKO was dispatched by the KGB. It'is
a certain personality trait of NOSENKO'who has in the past by his own
admission tended to enhance his importance and astuteness by graphically
portraying his personal participation in KGB activities concerning which

he had knowledge but did not personally participate. .

The claimed service of NOSENKO in Navy Intelligence during
March 1951 to early 1953 in the Far East and the Baltic areas has been |

| time are contained in a separate section of this summary, but it is

considered that the recent interviews of NOSENKO satisfactorily sub-
stantiate his claimed service in Navy Intelligence during March 1951
to early 1953.

Attached is a typed copy of a handwritten memorandum completed
by NOSENKO on 31 October 1967. This is a biographical statement con-
cerning his life and KGB career. No effort has been made to correct
grammatical errors or spelling since to do so would be in conflict with
the manner in which current interviews were conducted; namely, to give
NOSENKO an opportunity to recdunt his life.and activities to permit a re-
examination of the entire case. The comprehension and fluency of
NOSENKO in the English language was adequate for interview purposes
in October 1967 and both have materially improved since that time.

Intéryiews of and memoranda prepared by, NOSENKO since

* 31 October 1967 have not indicated any material discrepancies with the

statements of bei in the attached memorandum, One change that
has-been miade by NOSENKO is that he now dates his transfer from the
‘First Department, Second Chief Directorate (SCD), KGB, to the Seventh
Department, SCD, as occurring in the latter part of May 1955 rather
than June - July 1955 as indicated in the attached statement. NOSENKO

also now dates the period in which an unsatisfactory "characterization"

0004029



sermons 8

(personnel evaluation) was prepared on NOSENKO in March - April

1955 rather than May - June 1955, Since the unsatisfactory personnel
report was directly related to his transfer to the Seventh Department,
neither of the above changes are considered to be of a significant nature,
An effort has been made during current interviews to differentiate between
errors due to faulty memory and discrepancies indicative of deception by

NOSENKO.

B._ is the claimed KGB career of NOSENKO plausible? In the

past the theory has been advanced that NOSENKO was never an officer

It is considered that NOSENKO was a KGB officer in the claimed.

original contact in June 1962 (with the exception of his change to 1952 a8
date of his entry into the KGB and then later reverting to the date given:

as indicated elsewhere in this summary, but these are of month or day’

information in regard to rank and medals, but his basic story concerning

his KGB career today is not significantly different from the fragmentary!
version he gave in June 1962. cit

in Soviet organizations and more spécificaily in the KGB. As an example,

During current interviews and in prepared memoranda, .NOSENKO

_jhas furnished detailed information which it is considered substantiates

his. claimed positions in the KGB. . Detailed remarks on these topics are
contained in separate sections of this summary.

It is realized that GOLITSYN, although confirming that NOSENKO
was a KGB officer in both the First Department and Seventh Department,
SCD, has stated that NOSENKO remained in the First Department until
circa 1958 and that NOSENKO was not Deputy Chief of the First Section,
First Department, in 1960, It is impossible to correlate this information

with the above indicated opinion that NOSENKO left the First Department

“in late May 1955 and was Deputy Chief of the First Section, First Depart-

ment, in 1960, nox is an adequate explanation of these variances available

at this time. On the other hand, it is not reasonable that NOSENKO ia
would lay claim to the title of Deputy Chief of the First Section, First
Department, if this were not true when he clearly knew of the visits of
GOLITSYN to the First Section in 1960 - 1961 and of his conferences
with officers closely associated with NOSENKO at that time. ;
NOSENKO has also mentioned a number of officers of the SCD
or former officers of the SCD who transferred to the FCD with whom
he wae personally acquainted and who were also known to GOLITSYN. |
A number of these officers were officers from whom GOLITSYN has_
stated he obtained certain information or through whom he became peer

GRYAZNOV, Viadimir Ivanovich PETROV, Yuriy 1. GUX, Vladimir
A. CHURANOV, Yevgeniy GROMAKOVSKIY and Vadim V, KOSOLAPOV,
The statement cf NOSENKO that although he had heard of
GOLITSYN he had never personally met GOLITSYN, stands in conflict :
with the statements of GOLITSYN that he, GOLITSYN, had met and
talked with NOSENKO in the SCD in the late 1950's. Tne description
of GOLITSYN of tnis meeting is that of a casual encounter in the halis
rather than a specific office visit, In light of this, the absence of any
xeason why NOSENKO from his point of view should remember such

an encounter and the absence of any reason for NOSENKO to lie on this ©

issue, it is eminently reasonable to conclude that the encounter took
place but that NOSENKO simply has no recollection of it, There is
no reason to attach sign:.icance to this lapse of memory.

The previous opinion that NOSENKO did not hoid the claimed
position of Deputy Chief, First Section, First Department, during 1960 «, .
1961 has had the most merit in the controversy over his statements __
relative tohis KGB career, This particular aspect will be covered in.
detail in another section, but of note at this time is the controversy
over what duties the position of Deputy Chief of Section in the SCD, KGB,
entails or does not entail, It ie a fruitless exercise to attempt to judge ,
whether NOSENKO was Deputy Chief of the First Section in 1960 - 1961 ‘
on the basis of whether his knowledge of the total activities of the First
Section was commensurate with the knowledge of a Deputy Branch Chief
in GIA in regard to the activities of the entire Branch.

Whether NOSENKO was a Deputy Chief of Section in the SCD,

KGB, must be judged on the basis of what were the duties of a Deputy
Chief of Section in the SCD and in particular what were his duties in
the particular assignment. The organizational structure of the KGB

may or may not have some similarities to the organizational structure

of CIA, but any similarities are surely not such as to permit a judgment



J

as to whether NOSENKO held a certain claimed position on the basis

of a comparison of his activi

-8 and responsibilities with that inherent ; '
in a. somewhat similar position in CIA.

One of the most important differences between United States
agencies or organizations, inciuding CIA, and’the bureaucratic structure
of,agencies or organizations in the USSR, including the KGB, isthe |

“salary structure. Pay of a KGB officer is based on military rank and

on actual position held with an additional percentage increase for longevity

and language qualification, Actual position held is important from a
monetary: viewpoint in addition to the prestige, As an example, the
“difference in montaly salary between a captain and a major is twenty
rubles and the difference in salary between a Senior Case Officer and
a Deputy Chief of Section is also twenty rubles. An increase in military
rank alone has limited pay advantages, as for example a Lieutenant

’
Colonel who is only a Senior Case Officer receives le:

pay than a major
who holds the position of Chief of Section,
During current interviews, an effort hae been made to obtain
from NOSENKO statements concerning his responsibilities in the various
_ claimed positions, The judgment on whether he held or did not hold

the various claimed Positions, in view of the absence of any factual

supporting or refuting information, has necessarily been based to a
considerabie degree on the logic of the statements made by NOSENKO,

C,_Has NOSEXNKO given an acceptable explanation of his
motivation in. contacting CLA in 1962 and for his defection in 1964? Of

the eight listed categories which are being given specific consideration

in the matter of the bona fides of NOSENKO, this category is probably
the most difficult in which to present a logical position with factual
ie There are too many intangible aspects involved and although
motivation is an important factor, full resolution of the motivation
problem is not a paramount factor in deciding whether NOSENKO is or

is not a‘dispatched agent. NOSENKO could have contacted thie Agency in’

“1962 and-defected in 1964 without KGB knowledge and yet even at this late

date have failed to disclose some important events of a personal nature

which actually were important ingredients in his ultimate decision.

Defectcrs are humans and have at least the normal reluctance to admit
?

unfavorable information which.they consider of a personal nature.

:' On 31 October 1967 NOSENKO, following.a request, furnished a

handwritten memorandum on the topic of his motivation, a typed copy of

which is attached. The memorandum, although not grammatically correct,

‘Jip quite understandable and is worthy of review. The tenor of the memo-

-Fandum is'‘one of increasing disillusionment with the Soviet regime.

Stu:

NOSENKO and others of his generation have lived in a Soviet society
throughout their entire lives, The environment is an important factor

of influence in the life of an individual and true disillusionment is at

best usually a gradual process in which maay factors, some recognized
and some not recognized by the individual, have played a role in varying :

degrees.

NOSENKO, until 1955 and possibiy antil ‘the death of his father

“fri August 1956, could be compared to the-profligate son of wealthy

parents in the United States who finally graduates from college and obtains

employment.perhaps in the firm of his father without actually earning any of

_ the; luxuries he has enjoyed. “The father of NOSENKO was not only wealthy

by Soviet standards but also held a high government position. The
influence of his father and the name. of ais father undoubtedly was an
important if not the mest-important factor in NOSENKO éven being
permitted to enter the Naval RU and the KGB even though NOSENXO is
particularly reluctant to admit, perhaps even to himself,. that this was
the primary reason. ;

The above should not be construed as any reflection on the

“gebual intelligence of NOSENKO, but rather as an explanation of how

: NOSENKO could have even entered the Naval RU and KGB. His

pesformance in both prior to 1936 by his own admission was such that
be probably would have been summarily terminated if he had not been
the son of the capable, respected Minister of Shipbuilding.
i By certain amount of speculation is permitted, the
disillusionment of NOSENKO, who lost.many personal advantages

following the death of his father including a personal automobile, may

have actually started soon after the death of his father, Tnat NOSENKO
is undisciplined is supported by his admissions relative to his life in
: ‘the USSR and his behavior both in 1962 in Geneva and for a period of time
after his defection in 1964. _NOSENKO was addicted:te women, liquor, and
. «the material-things which can be purchased with money or obtained through
~influence.

A question has been previously raised regarding his motivation
in contacting CIA in 1962, particularly his statement that he needed money
and would sell "two Pieces of information, " NOSENKO has stated that he
wanted to make a contact with the Americans, that’he was not emotionally '
ready to defect, but that he subconsciously believed that if he made a

contact he would be making an ultimate commitment from which he could

: ':no.longer retreat,



sy

NOSENKO has stated that he gave considerabie thought to the
best way to contact the Americans so that he would be believed and not
rejected and came to the conclusion that he would offer to sell some
information, NOSENKO stated that he thought if he approached the
Americaine stating ne was a "KGB counter intelligence officer who wanted _
to give information," he would not have been believed and would have
been peremptorily rejected. NOSENKO stated he had difficulty deciding
how much money to ask for and how to make the approach, but finally
decided ‘to do it through (By NMA igjwhom the KGB considered was with .

NOSENKO hao vtated that the night before ble departure from :
Geneva to the USSR he gave serious thought to defection but was not

Operational Memo # N-4

SUBJECT: NOSENKO, Yuri Ivanovich , .

The following is a typed copy of a nandwritten memorandum

" furnished by Subject on 1 November 1967, following a request on

31 October 1967:

What were the motif and the reasons which have led me to
the decision to breake with the Soviet Russia? The only definite is an
understanding of the situation in the Soviet Russia, the mowledge of
the methods of the communist regime, the knowledge of the real foreign
and interior policies of the Soviet government and the faith in the right- ‘
nese of the {ree world,

It wae not a decision which wae accepted or could be accepted .
in a month or a year. Thie decision was slowly growing inme, I |
think that the beginning was in the studentship,

Living with my parents. and being in the circles of the parent's
and my acquaintances I knew more then there was written in newspapers
and periodice and that was propagandized by radio and TV, Working in
the Far East and later being in trips in different regione and cities of

Russia I found out much better the life and conditions of the life of the

~ people of the Soviet Russia.

D,' OIS THE INFORMATION =

CONCERNING KGB OPERATIONS,

AND ORGANIZATION REASONABLY COMMENSURATE

1 WITH HIS CLAIMED KGB CAREER?



D,__Is the information furnished by NOSENXO to CIA concerning

KGB operations, personalities, and organization reasonably commen-
surate with-his claimed KGB career? The conclusion is that the infor
mation furnished by NOSENKO concerning KGB operations, personalities,
and organization is more than reasonably commensurate with his claimed
career in the KGB from mid-March ‘1953 to his defection in early February
1964, i: :
Sl: reaching the above conclusion, ‘consideration has been given
to his-cidimed. departmental assignments and claimed positions in each
department, Certain allowance has been made ‘for faulty memory with
consideration being given to whether there is any indication of deception
or whether the failure to recall a particular item of interest can logically
?
be attributed to the vagaries of the human mind, There is, of course, no
accurate stindard of measurement which would permit a positive deter-
mination as to whether inability to recall certain details or events is
actually due to the fact that the human mind cannot recall all past events

" or could be attributed to willful deception,

gou1CE0

An effort has been made to determine if there are any particular
patterns or areas where NOSENKO has indicated he did not recali
specific matters or certain details, and no pattern or specific areas
have been noted. NOSENKO, in fact, has an unusually good memory
ae: evidenced by the extensive information iurnished by NOSENKO purely
from recollection, In addition, there has been no material reluctance
on the part of NOSENKO to discuss his entire life, KGB officere he has
known, KGB organization and procedures, or other topice of interest.

NOSENKO has furnished considerable detail concerning KGB
officers whom he has known at various periods in his entire KGB career.
He has been very consistent in information furnished and has frequently
added certain details which he recalled at-a later date,

Certain remarks will be made in another section in regard to
the volume and scope of information furnished by NOSENKO. This in-
formation is not selective, but is‘an excellent indicator that NOSENKO
was assigned to the First Department and Seventh Department, SCD,
during the claimed periods of time and held the claimed positions Con-
sideration has been given to his various claimed KGB assignments in
evaluating the information furnished in an effort to assess whether ‘his

indicated lnowledge was commensurate with his claimed position during

oouicet



a particular period of time or suggested the possibility that he did not
occupy che position which he claimed to have held.

It is considered that information furnished by NOSENKO supports
his claimed positions in the SCD. it nas not been possible to substantially

confirm through collateral sources that NOSENKO served in his claimed

' positions. Neither has it been possible to obtain from other sources an

applicable description of the duties or responsibilities of an individual

holding any of the positions NOSENKO claimed to have held after 1958. It

is felt thefo can be no question that NOSENKO served in the capacities of

junior caée officer, case officer, and.senior caaé officer during 1953 - 1957.

As regards the duties and responsibilities of a Deputy Chief of Section,

Chieé of! ‘Section, and Deputy Chief of Department, and whether NOSENKO
held these various claimed positions, a considerable amount of personal
judgment has been necessary. This personal judgment has been made in

as judicial a manner as possible, with full knowledge that any opinion in

~ regard to:the above is largely dependent upon information from NOSENKO.

+ NOSENKO has compiled detailed diagrams of the actual offices
he claims to have occupied and surrounding offices during the four pri-

mary periods of time: 1953 - 1955, 1955 - 1959, 1960 - 1961, and 1962 -

He 1963, “He has prepared specific memoranda concerning his co-officers

0001062



and other personnel, an@ changes of personnel, as well as diagrame
of the offices of the Chief and Deputy Chiefs of the SCD during’1956 -
1964, ‘This material ie internally consistent. Furthermore NOSENKO
could not possibly have known that this detailed information could not
immediately be checked for accitracy, at least in part, with a source
or another officer who has defected since mid-1964, If thes diagrams
arid memoranda were not relatively correct, NOSENKO, who is quite
astute in matters of counterintelligence, would hardly have voluntarily

prepared the material in such detail. This type of information is

peculiarly adaptable for analysis by a knowledgeable source or by another

. : . ve : ways
defector ‘and could, if not relatively correct, permit a rather positive con-

clusion that NOSENKO was lying or fabricating information.

NOSENKO has furnished quite specific information on KGB
operations during the 1953 - 1955, 1955 - 1959, 1960 - 1961, and 1962 -
1963 periods of time. As might be expected, his specific knowledge is
Jess gor the 1953 - 1955 period; but his own personal situation and attitude
until 1955 - 1956, which are mentioned elsewhere, should be given
consideration. In any event, he has furnished adequate information so
that his claimed assignment during 1953 - 1955 is considered sufficiently
substantiated even though his actual job performance. undoubtedly

deserved a low rating.

- 9004063



The knowledge of NOSENKO-concerning cases, KGB operations,

and other officers can consistently be related to his claimed department ue

and position assignment during the 1953 to January 1964 period. The
scope of his knowledge of his own department when considered in toto
is broader after 1957 than before, which is compatible with his claim of

4ncreased responsibilities. His knowledge of thé work of other departments

of the SCD from the late 1950's on is also more-extensive, which is also a.
further indication that NOSENKO actually held the claimed positions

during this pericd of time.

Soviets, it became apparent that SMITH, rather than HAMILTON, was
tdentical to "ZHARI," Investigation disclosed that no definite informa-
ten could be established fn regard to the actual whereabouts of SMITH
after circa mid-1960. It cannot be positively stated that appropriate
favestigetion in 1964 of the "ZHARI" lead would have led to the identi-
fication of Joha Discos SMITH as "ZHARI," However, such (dontifi-
cation would have been of considerabie interest to tho Department of

would have at least lessened the propaganda effect.of the surprise

Services had compiled a list of twenty suspects, including VASSALL.
Even though it may be presumed that investigation of the twenty suspects
would ultimately bave resulted in a determination that VASSALL wag
the agent on whom GOLITSYN had furnished certain Information, the
information from NOSCNKO tn June 1962 resulted in the earlier termi-
nation by the British Services of a still valuable productive KGB agent.

Although not the case of a KGB agent, the matter of the micro-
phones in the United States Embavey should also be mentioned.
GOLITSYN, following his defection in Decernber 196], furnished
certain information in regard to microphones in the United States
Embassy (Chancery). Since in fact the microphones we.s connected
to coatral cables, location of one microphone would logically hove led
to the exposure of the entire set of inicrophones. However, sppro~
priate action was not taxen on thie information and the KGB would have
beon aware thet no action wee taken prior to June 1962 when NCSENKD

If NOSENKO te @ dispatched KGB agent, It {s rot clear why the
KGB would attract opscific attention toa eystem of microphones which
must have otill had some value ae of June 1962. A presumption may
be made that if NOSENKO was a dispatched agent, the KGB had, as of
1962, an advanced system of monitoring devices which rendered the
above microphone system obsolete, However, no concrete evidence
of such an advanced system is available and it should be noted that it

that NOSENKO was dispatched by the KCB? The conclusion in this

summary ‘is that NOSENKO was not dispatched by the KGE. in
reaching this conclusion, a full examination of the above ¢.-« :ion has
been both a necessary and integral part. iste

It ie inherent that the volume of information furnished by
NOSENKO is only one of the factors which should be given consideration
in arriving at a conclusion that NOSENKO was or was not dispatched by
the KGB. If NOSENKO was dispatched by the KGB, the KGB would have
surely been willing to sacrifice certain information of value to the KGB
in order to support the bona fides of NOSENKO. However, if NOSENKO
was dispatched, it must have been to accomplish or further a KGB
purpose or mission, the nature of which has been and continues to be
unknown,

An examination of the circumstances under which NOSENKC first
contacted CIA in Geneva in 1962 and his behavior during thése contacts is
particularly pertinent since during this period of time NOSENKO would
have surely been under direct KGB control if there are any implications

of KGB dispatch in the NOSENKO case.

SECRET



NOSENXKO has stated that his original approach to "sell two

pieces of information" was his own idea as to what was most likely to

“be successful, NOSENKO has stated that he wanted to make a contact

with the Americans, was not psychologically adapted to defect at the
time, and felt that if he merely stated that he was a "KGB counter-
intelligence officer who wanted to give information," he very possibly
would be rejected, It should be noted that NOSENKO even during his
first contact did not limit his remarks to the "two pieces of information"
and began to talk quite freely on other matters.

If NOSENKO was dispatched, it is felt that he, during his 1962
contacts, would have been very carefully briefed and that his remarks
or statements would have not been of a nature which could fe any
suspicion in regard to the bona fides of NOSENKO, Instead, - current
review of his statements and remarks during his five contacts in 1962
indicate that his many errors, exaggerations, and actual lies were quite*
likely typical of a braggadocio element in the personality of NOSENKO
and may also have been evidence supporting the statement by NOSENKO
that he usually had a few drinks of liquor before each contact in

Geneva,

NOSENKO, during his five contacts in Geneva, made many
statements which in retrospect were impossivie, and the investigation
of which could only have raised certain questions con erning NOSENKO.
‘The following is a list of the more obvious areas in which NOSENKO
made gross exaggerations or made incorrect or impossible statements.

{a) NOSENKO claimed he personally was with

recruitment pitch to[James Ase (This was

(4) NOSENKO claimed personal contact wit

by the KGB. (NOS=.

KO actually had never personaiiy met
(STEVENS, and only had seen[STEV. Slonce at a distance.)

(e) NOSENKO dated the recruitment of "ANDREY"
in Moscow as 1949-1950. At the samo time he furnished
information that "ANDREY" (who is considered identical to
Dayle Wallis SMITH) oe in Moscow during a part of the time
that Roy RHODES, also a recruited agent, was assigned to
Moscow, 1951-1953. “ANDREY" (SMITH) was actually in
Moscow 1952-1954,

(2) NOSENXO said he, GRIBANOV, and another officer
met Edward Ellis SMITH. (NOSENKO has since stated he did
not meet SMITH aad that his only role was obtaining a foreign
typewriter and paper for a KGB agent involved in the SMITH
operation. }

(g) NOSENKO in a number of instances spoke in the
first person, caying "We did this, " or "We did that," in

xeference to a particular KGB activity in which he now admits

: G064082

SIR


he was not involved but had some knowledge. (If

NOSENKO was under KGB control in 1962, both he

and the AGB should bave known that these indicated

exaggerations would eventually lead to a question

concerning the bona fides of NOSENKO. )

In 1562-1963 a number of similarities were noted between
information furnished by NOSENKO and information which had been
furnished by GOLITSYN prior to June 1962. These similarities were
quite striking and gave riseto certain suspicions of NOSENKO because
he provided information which the KGB would presumably have considered
already compromised as a result of the defection of GOLITSYN. Certain
of the similarities at the time could only be explained in terms of
NOSENKO being a dispatched agent. The following are some examples of
the similarities noted.

(a) Both furnished information in regard to
[Bohan PREISFREUND} 06

(>) Both furnished information in regard to a
[Filitary code clerk case (James STORSBERCHL OB 06

(c) Both furnished information in regard to a

(a) Both furnisaed information in regard to
microphones in the United States Embassy in Moscow.
(e) Both furnished information in regard to

The above list is not complete nor does it indicate the actual
differences in the amount of information furnished on any particalar
topic by GOLITSYN and NOSENKO. To cite the above in detail in tie
summary is believed unnecessary since the only point of real interest
is whether the fact that NOSENKO was aware of certain events, cases,
or situations of which GOLITSYN was also aware raises a legitimate
question concerniig the bona fides of NOSENKO.

The above area of concern has been thoroughly examined and
it is considered that the fact that NOSENKO iurnished some information
on certain cases or situations previously mentioned in lesser or

greater detail by GOLITSYN cannot logically be construed as evidence

that NOSENKO wae dispatched by the KGB. NOSENKO has during

current interviews satisfactorily sourced his information in alm: st
every instance. Ina few instances he has said he did not recali
how he learned of a particular piece of information but these
apparent lapses of memory were not large in number and are
considered to be in no way suspicious. !

The general area in which there was a similarity between
information furnished by GOLITSYN in late 1961 - early.1962 and
information furnished by NOSENKO in June 1962 and which would have
been the most significant insofar as the security of the United States
Government was or is concerned related to certain activities centering
around or in the First Department, SCD.

It is the conclusion of this summary that NOSENKO was an
officer of the First Section, First Department, SCD, during 1953-1955
and was Deputy Chief of the same section in 1960 - 1961, Therefore,
the fact that NOSENKO furnished information concerning certain cases
or situations in the First Department and the fact that GOLITSYN
farnished information concerning the same case or situation is not

unusual or necessarily suspicious. NOSENKO has stated that GOLITSYN

that NOSENKO was not Deputy Chief of the First Section in 1960 has
been noted and commented on in another section of this summary.

GOLITSY N hae furnished certain information which he re-
ceived from officers of the First Section, First Department, SCD, '
In each instance where this information, which was fragmentary, could
not be immediately correlated with information from NOSENKO, it was
previously considered to be evidential of deception or lying on the part
of NOSENKO, This position, however, failed to allow for the possibility
that the discrepancies between the two sources were, at least in certain
instances, more apparent than real,

In certain instances it has now been possible to correlate irag-
mentary information from GOLITSYN with information from NOSENKO,
making it evident that in these instances the differences could not be
construed as in any way refjecting against NOSENKO. The four examples
cited below represent two probable correlations, (a) and (b); one possible
correlation, (c); and one instance where,no correlation is possible at this

time, (4):

(a) GOLITSYN furnished information which he
received in April-May 1960 from Gennadiy GRYAZNOV
that an attempt had been made by the KGB to recruit an

efiect her recruitment. He did not recall the name of the

the spring of 1960 that GRYAZNLV had developed an operation

rather than during the spring of 1960 when GOLITSYN was
preparing for his assignment to Helsinki, Finland, This
theory is supported by informatior: on page 163 of the previous
summary that GOLITSYN has stated he learned in January
1961 from Vladisiav M. KOVSHUK (Chief of the First Section)
that[Johan pabisrazund|iad recently been used in the

from GRYAZNOV that GRYAZNOV had as an agent an Embassy

GRYAZNOV indicated to GOLITSYN that the code clerk had

also mentioned in another section pertaining to the 1960-1961 career
of NOSENKO. GOLITSYN stated that KOSOLAPOV came to Helsinki
to accompany an American Embassy code clerk on the train to
Moscow and that KOSOLAPOV planned to strike up an acquaintance
With the code clerk which could be continued in Moscow.

‘The American Embassy code clerk referred to above was

and Viktor KOLOSOV (Vadim V. KOSOLAPOV) as passengers on the
same train from Heisinki to Moscow. NOSENKO is aware of the
‘dentity offFobn cdeanidjout claimé no knowledge of the above trip
of KOSOLAPOV to Helsinki, although being well aware of a previous trip.

NOSENKO, as Deputy Chief of the First Section. specifically
charged with work against code clerks, should have been aware of the
November 1960 trip of KOSOLAPO¥ to and from Helsinki. His lack of

*ynowledge may or may not be explainable in terme of his other activities

such as his trip to Cuba in November~December 1960 but it cannot be

interpreted as evidence NOSENKO was dispatched by the KGB since, if

“he had been, the KGB should have briefed NOSENKO on the trip of
(OSOLAPOV to Helsinki in November 1960, as this was an event the

A theory which has previously been given consideration and
warranted full consideration was that if NOSENKO was dispatched,

his mission was to confuse leads furnished to American intelligence
and/or to denigrate the. value of information furnished by GOLITSYN.

In connection with this theory, it should be noted that NOSENKO during
current interviews has not made any remarks which could in any way
be construed as derogatory to GOLITSYN. In addition, NOSENKO does
not claim to Have any detailed knowledge of the FCD and frequently,
when some topic peculiar to the FCD bas been broached with NOSENKO,

his immediate reply has been to the effect that "I didn't work in the aed a

or "You ‘should ask ‘GOL TSYN about that."

In-connection with any consideration of whether the contact of
NOSENKO with CIA in Geneva in June 1962 could have been initiated by
the KGB as a result of the defection of GOLITSYN,’ the timing of certain
events should be noted.. GOLITSYN defected ons December 1961.
NOSENKO departed from Moscow in March 1962 for Geneva, Switzerland,
where he remained until 15 June 1962. ;

It is felt that it would have been practically impossible if not
imposéible for KGB officials to complete an assesement of the actual or

potential damage which could result from the defection of GOLITSYN,

SEE eS



ARISEN

SEC

select NOSENKO as the individual who would be dispatched to counter-
act the possible damage, and appropriately brief NOSENKO prior to
his departure for Geneva in March 1962. Therefore, if NOSENKO
was dispatched by the KG3, it would appear that pians for this would
have predated the defection of GOLITSYN and that any GOLITSYN
aspect could only be a related aspect and not the basis for the original
plan to dispatch NOSENKO, In addition, if NOSENKO was dispatched,
it would hardly seem necessary for the KGB to send NOSENXO to
Geneva two and one-half months before hie first contact with CIA,

The theory has also been considered that NOSENKO could have
been dispatched to confuse and divert American intelligence and thus
to protect an important KGB penetration or penetrations of the United
States Government, particularly CIA. This is a theory which should

and has been given full consideration, out it is not possible to factually

substantiate or reful theory in the absence of specific information
that high-level KGB penetrations do or do not exist.
Actually, as regards NOSENKO, the primary area which should

be given consideration in the above matter is if all the information from

NOSENKO is accepted, what effect would or could it have on the efforts _

of American counter-intesjigence té determine the identity of and
take appropriate action against KGB-penetrations of the United
States Government. The only answer to this question seems to be : ”
that there would be little consolation or assurance to American intelli-
gence even if every statement by NOSENKO was accepted at face value,

The only specific area in which NOSENKO could be even con-
sidered to claim full knowledge is the United States Embassy in Moscow. ; i
In thie area lite statements could be construed as assurance that there
were no recruitments of American personnel in the United States Embassy

_.(Dayle Wallis SMITH) and Herbert HOWARD} The basis for this

expressed. opinion of NOSENiO is considered elsewhere in this summary
and analysts may differ as to whether a recruitment could have occurred
of which NOSENKO did not have knowledge, assuming that hie statements

are made in good faith, It should be noted, however, that at this time

there is no specific information which is in direct conflict with the

expressed opinion of NOSENKO, : '

NOSENKO, as previously mentioned, has never claimed any

particular knowledge of FCD activities, In addition, he does not claim

to be aware of all recruitments of Americans by theSCD. Asan .



example, -he has made it clear that his knowledge of SCD activities
against members of delegations, foreign businessmen, foreign students,
and individuals in the USSR on the invitation of a Soviet organization or
a component of the Soviet Government is extremely limized and at best
mainly of a collateral nature.

NOSENKO does not even claim any detailed knowledge of

activities of the Second Section (Active Line) of the First Department, SCD,

nor does he claim to know all of the cases of which the Chief of the Seventh
Department was aware. The latter is specifically supported by certain
notes brought out by NOSENKO which are short references to a number

of Seventh Department cases which are identified only by the KGB code
name. These notes, according to NOSENKO, were made when he had an
opportunity to review a notebook held by the Chief of the Seventa Department

and constitute the only knowledge NOSENKO had of these particular cases.

S

H._Is there any evidence that the contacts of NOSENKO in 1962

or in 1964 with CIA were known to the XGB prior to his defection or

that NOSENKO was ever briefed by the KGB relative to his behavior

or KGB objectives during these contacts or aiter his defection? The

conclusion is that there is no evidence that the contacts of NOSENKO
in 1962 or in 1964 with CIA were known to the KGB prior to his
defection and that NOSENKO was never briefed in any manner by the KGB.
The basis for the above conclusion is substantially contained in
previous sections, It is being. treated here as a separate area of interest
since it is a sufficiently important area as to warrant individual consideration,
It is recognized that since positive factual confirmation such as
the KGB file on NOSENKO is not available, any conclusion concerning
whether NOSENKO was or was not dispatched by the KGB can only be
based on the full review of available information from NOSENKO,
collateral sources, independent investigation and the opinion of the
individual analyst concerning the significance or non-significance of

each item of available information.

The conclusion that the contacts of NOSENKO with CIA in 1962

n0ii0?



necessarily based in part on a judgment as to whether any of his
activities or information logically warrant a substantial suspicion
that they were or could be in any part the result of KGB direction

or control, One of the particular areas considered wae hie apparent
behavior during his contacts with CIA in June 1962 and the conclusion
wae that it waa incomprehensible that he could have been under KGB
control at that time.

Consideration has been given to the possibility that his 1962

. contacts with CLA were not known to the KGB," but became known to

the KGB. later and NOSENKO was doubled by the KGB. It was con-
cluded that there was no basis for or information which would warrant
serious: consideration of the above possibility aside from the separate
conclusion that the KGB would be very unlikely to reward a traitor in
KGB eyes by sending him again to Geneva where he would be quite free

to defect,

Worthy of comment in this section is the fact that NOSENKO,

‘during hie 1962 contacts, expressed considerable concern over his
personal security, requesting that knowledge concezning his identity be

AS CONTAINED ON PAGES 357 - 360 OF

“THE EXAMINATION OF THE BONA FIDES OF A KGB DEFECTOR"

The following is a uote of the previous conclusions in the case of Yuriy
Ivanovich NOSENKO. (The specific conclusions have been given the designation
of A - G for purposes of easier correlation with other sections of this summary.)

UMMARY OF CONCLUSIONS

CONCERNING NOSENKO'S BONA FIDES"

“NOSENKO claims that he served for a decade in the KGB in
successively: senior positions of auhority from which he derived
extensive knowledge of the scope, character, and results of KGB
operations against Americans in the Soviet Union in the period
1953-1963. To substantiate his claim, he provides an impressive.
array of information about KGB personnel, organization and opera-
tions which, to the extent that it has been confizmed, is presumptive
evidence of his bona fides. Various Soviet officials, including
intelligence ofiicers, have generally corroborated NOSENKO's

claims. According to some of these sources, NOSENKO was a

senior KGB officer who occupied a series of sensifive. positions, who

enjoyed considerable autuoriiy and trust despite personal short- 5
comings, and whose defection, 'the greatest loss ever suffered
by Soviet Intelligence’,. paralyzed the work of am KGB GEE ; ; :

- Légal Residency, and justified the formulation of plans to assas-
sinate him,"

"The examination has compared each element of NOSENKO's
biography relevant to his claimed KGB service with known
facts and reasonable surmise. The examination reflects the _ 7
test to which his accounts were put: whether his accounts are
- internally coherent and consistent with known fact, and whether

. he actually gained the information ne has from occupying the

KGB.positions-he claims to have.held. In éhort, is he what he
says he is, according.to nis own-accounts?"'
“This examination had led to the following findings, arrived
at independently:
A. NOSENKO cié not serve in the Naval RU
in any of the capacities or at the places and times he

claimed,

. B. NOSENKO did not enter the KGB in the : .

manner or at the time he. claimed.

D. During the period 1955-1960, he was neither

E, ‘NOSEXKO was neither Deputy Chief of the
American Embassy Section nor a senior oificer or
". supervisor in the Section during the period 1961-1962. (sic)
F, NOSENKO's claims, that in 1962-ne was Chief
of the American-British Commonwealth Section and wae *
thereafter a Deputy Chief of the Seventh Department, are Ot : :

not-credible,

*.” G.“NOSENKO has no valid claim to certainty’ +
that the KGB recruited no American Embassy personnel
between 1953 and iis defection in 1964. i a

These findings differ somewhat with respect to degree of probability

or certitude, but they reflect the preponderance of avai
in each instancé.""

“The above judgments, if correct, rebut presumptive evidence
of NOSENKO's bona fides. The contradictions in NOSENKO's accounts
of his. life and KGB service are so extensive as to make his claima_

asa whole unacceptabie. While truth and fact.in this case frequently : as

SWGDOHALB: eb - a

“SECRET

win tine ante Se sin sem impnen tn hg an eee ents hams



greatly exaggerated his actual rank, status and access in the KGB, for

Uevetae

cannot be established with certainty, it is evident that truth and
fact are not what NOSENKO relates. By almosi any test, virtually
any of NOSENKO's above claims are impugned by iact or probability,

or contradicted or retracted in his own statements. NCSENKO is

not what he claims to be, and thus he is not a bona fide defector."

"Given the conclusion that NOSENKO is not a bona fide
defector, it is necessary to attempt to determine his true motives :
for contacting American Intelligence and for providing the information

he has given. Here, it must be recognized that the evidence, largely

consisting of NOSENKO's own assertions, does not permit unequivocal

conclusions. Neverteiess, the question cannot be ignored. The
character of the information NOSENKO has conveyed, the fact that

some of his false claims have been corroborated by Soviet officials,

and the necessity to make decisions about NOSENKO's future all
require that at least a provisional judgment be made. "*

"Of the reasonable explanations advanced fo¥ NOSENKO's
misrepresentations, the chief ones are that he is a swindler posing
as a former KGB officer for reasons of personal advantage; that he

suffers from a deranged personality or unbalanced mind; that he has

1
imply personal ; or,. finally, that he is a dispatched KGB HE
simply, personal reasons; or, Y 6 a dispatel 094447 : :

“The first two possibilities are easily dismissed. That

. NOSENKO is not siinply a swindler who falsely claims for personal

advantage to have been a KGS officer is evident, we believe, from
the confirmed details of KGB organization, Ser oaeal and operations
which he has provided and which could only derive from within the
KGB itself,"

“Second, as noted in the ext, extensive psychiatric and

psychological examination by qualified specialists rule out the’

possibility that NOSENKO's actions and testimony are the product
of a deranged personality or unbalanced mind."

"mt ig somewhat more plausible that NOSENKO is a KGB
officer who served in at ieast some of the components for some

or all of the time periods that he claims, but who greatly exag-

~ gerated his positions, rank and access to intormation, and

invented some matters outright, to achicve greater status with
American Intelligence. This explanation, however, fails to
accommodate the fact that several KGB officers have asserted

that: NOSENKO did in fact nold senior positions in the KGB. Also,

omméntby.other.sources." Sa adamantane

cee
. NOSENKO's assertions with respect to his rank, GRIBANOV's

onage,. the recall telegram, and the like, cannot be just a
” product-of hie own invention, since these were the subject of

6001118



"Because none of the above explanations is consistent with
the data developed in interrogations and investigations, we are
left with the hypothesis that NOSENKO was dispatched by the
KGB. While this explanation does not reconcile all the anomalies,
none of them renders it untenadle. "

MIn the absence of further revelations by NOSENKO, oF
other persuasive evidence to the contrary, cA finds that the
evidence establishes a presumption that NOSENKO was dispatched
by the KGB, and believes that prudence requires that he be
regarded as still Beupousite to KGB control, and that his infor-

mation should be assessed accordingly."

The interrogations of NOSENKO prior to 1967 were complicated

by. NOSENKO changing the date of his graduation irom the Institute of

" International Relations from 1950 to 1949. because he did not wish to
admit that he had failed to graduate in 1949 with the majority of hie clasa.
However, ‘previous e‘forts of NOSENKO to revert to his original 1962
statement that he graduated in 1950 were not accepted and an unwarranted
significance was given to the 1949 - early 1953 period of time.

It is considered that NOSENXO has adequately explained his

“etupid blunders" as they relate to the above and to certain other personal _

matters and that his claimed service in Navy Intelligence from March

1951 to early 1953 both in the Far East and the Baltic area is fully
acceptabie, It is not considered necessary to comment concerning all
of the ‘remarks in the previous summary regarding the claimed Naval
RU s€ivice of NOSENKO as reflected on pages 49-59 and remarks will,
for purposes of brevity, be limited in scope.

The statement is made in the previous summary that "The sole
Headquarters RU officer NOSENKO identified was the Personnel Chief,
Colonel KALOSHIN, He identified no ranking officers in either the Baltic
or Far East Intelligence Staffs. Some 30 GRU officers he did identify,
by his own admission, NOSENKO knew not {rom his Naval RU service,
but through social acquaintance, later, in Moscow, or through hio visits
to.Geneva,"

Attached is a copy of a handwritten memorandum voluntarily

+ prepared by NOSENKO in late i967 containing the names of a number

of GRU personnel of whom ke had some knowledge. The attached was
not prepared as the result of any inquiry concerning his claimed Naval
RU service, but was only a small part of the material prepared by
NOSENKO at this time, ‘The entire material included remarks by

NOSENKO regarding ap; roximately]875 GB oificers,(100 KGB agents,

" 35 GRU officers and|400 other Soviet nationale,

It is interesting to note that the attached list contains the names

of approximately 20 GRU officers whom NOSENKO relates to the early
1950's period. In addition, NOSENKO has, during current interviews
and in other memoranéa, furnished the names of additional Navy Intelli-
gence, personnel whom he knew in the 1951 - early 1953 period,

Page 52 of the above summary and other related pages question
whether NOSENKO ever served in the Baltic area with Naval Intelligence
and even question his geographical knowledge of the area, Attached is a
copy of a handwritten memorandum with certain diagrams prepared by
NOSENKO on 21 February.1968 concerning his assignment with Navy

. Intelligence in the Far East and the Baltic area. The memorandum was
. completed by. NOSENKO without any reference material and a review of
his diagrams indicates they are quite accurate.

NOSENKO had previously stated that his service in the Baltic
area was at Sovetsk Primorskiy and during current interviews recalled
that the former name of the place, an almost deserted fisnermen's
village, was Fishausen, The previous designation given by NOSENKO
for this place as having the mail address of Sovetsk Primorskiy had
caused the conclusion that his alleged place of assignment was non-
existent, A further check:in the-matter would have disclosed that the
- place was-not nonexistent, that it is currently known as Primorsk and

that the former German name of the fishing village was Fischhausen,

UoUece

The previous summary aiso stated that despite hie claimed
active coramissioned service in the Navy, NOSENiO knew nothing of
Soviet Navy tradition, doctrines, or organization of procedures, It
should be noted that there is a considerable difference between being
a member of the Naval RU and being.an actual member of the Soviet
Navy. The situation could be compared to a career civilian employee

of the Office of Naval Intelligence and a line officer in the United States

Navy.

B. NOSENKO dic not enter the KGB in the manner or at the time

claimed. (Previous conclusion)

The above is conclusion "B" in thé previous summary in regard _
ty NOSENKO. The conclusion in thie summary is that NOSENKO entered
the then Second Chief Directorate, MVD, in mid-March 1953 and that his
entry was not only facilitated by but due to the influence of General
Bogdan Zakharovich KC3ULOV.

Previous statements by NOSENKO and changes relative to date of
entry into the KGB have been mentioned in another section of the summary
and will not be repeated here. His statements during current interviews
that he entered on duty in mid-March 1953 as a case officer in the First
Section, First Department, Second Chief Directorate, MVD, are con=
sidered adequately substantiated and should be accepted,

‘The conclusion of the previous summary (pages 61-74) that

NOSENKO did not enter the KGB in the manner or at the time claimed

“was primarily based on conflicting statements by NOSENKO as to when

he entered the KGB (MVD). In 1962 NOSENKO said March 1953 and in -

1965 NOSENKO again said March 1953, soon after the death of STALIN.

001132

Sauls

in 1964, NOSENKO had given two dates in 1952 as his time of entry into
the XGB in an effort not to admit that he had failed to graduate from the
Institute of International Relations in 1949.

‘The previous summary gave considerable weight to the statements
of NOSENKO indicating that he. did not enter the KGB (MVD) under what
are considered normal KGB procedures. Proper allowances were not
given for position of the father of NOSENKO, the Minister of Shipbuilding,

and the influence of General KOBULOV: An analyst can either.accept or

eject the statement of NOSENKO that he entered the KGB (MVD) through

the influence of.General XOBULOV;.but,. if the statement is accepted, then

The previous summary raises several points concerning the
eligibility of NOSENKO for the KGB (MvD)." It points out on page 67
‘that other than his undistinguished period of service with the Naval RU,

‘he ‘was no more eligible for a KGB.appointment in 1953 than he was at

the time’ of his previous rejection in 1950, This statement is not contro-

was not sponsored by any person of influence as was tae case in 1953

with General KOBULOV who in mid-March 1953 was the First Deputy

to BERIYA. i :
The previous summary also states that according to KGB

defectors farniliar with the standards in force at the time, no candidate

was accepted who had ever had tuberculosis, This is a flat statement

Which it io doubtful any defector or series of defectors could fully

substantiate; namely, that it neve? happened. Until and unless it is

medically proven that NOSENKO did not have tuberculosis, it is accepted

that he did have tuberculosis in 1952 and was at a sanitarium --. rest-

ace in Kubinka. It is also accepted that he was an officer in the. KGB.

after mid-March 1953. The influence of KOBULOV could undoubtedly

have permitted NOSENKO to enter the KGB even though he previously

had tuberculosis, but the flat statement that no candidate was accepted who
had ever had tuberculosis is not and cannot be sufficiently substantiated.

The previous summary contained a number of additional remarks

and conclusions intended to show that NOSENKO was not eligible for and

therefore could not have entered the KGB (MVD). Comments concerning
these-will be brief since there is considered to be no adequate basis at
this ‘time on which to contend that NOSENKO did not enter the KGB

(MVD) as an officer in. mid-March 1953. .A comment was made that

.. The previgus summary also failed to note that the MVD would

NOSENKO has claimed that the designation of his Directorate at the . A

time he entered the KGB (MVD) in mid-March 1953 was the Second

Chief Directorate and that it subsequently was redesignated the

First Chief Directorate, DERYABIN as stated this reversal of
designations occurred in March 1953.

STALIN died in early March 1953 and that same month the 5
MVD and the MGB were merged under the name MVD with BERIYA
as Minister. BERIYA held this position until his arrest in early June noe . . i

1953. BERIYA was succeeded by KRUGLOV, who held office for less

date of the reversal of the.designation of the FCD,and SCD and places

it as the end of April or early May 1953. GOLITSYN has indicated that
the change occurred "soon aftex the advent of BERIYA as head of the
MVD in April 1953." In the light of our inability to fix the eifective date

of the reversal of the designations of the SCD and the FCD, it is as .

unreasonable to impugn NOSENKO on his statement as to the designation

of his Directorate at the time of his entry into the KGB (MVD).

There is a disagreement between NOSENKO and others as to who

was responsible for the reversal of designations of the FCD and the. scp.

in conflict with the staterncnis of DERYABIN, RASTVOROV and cen

GOLITSYN, all of whom maintain that BERIYA was responsidle for
the changes. As for the issue of who was responsibie ior the reversal
of designations, it would appear that NOSENKO is in error. However,

the fact that he was a new junior officer and that this was a period of

upheaval in the KGB (MVD) effectively eliminates any significance in

this issue. :

NOSENKO is criticized in the previous summary for not knowing
the location of the Chief Directorate of the Militia or the history of the
KI (Committee of Information). NOSENKO has stated that he had no
contacts with either office during 1953-1955 and there is no adequate reason
to disbelieve this.statement. He is not aware of when the XI ceased to
exist (1951 given in the summary, but other information indicates the KI
continued to exist in a nominal capacity until the mid-1950's), but care
should be used in stating what NOSENKO should know if he held a certain
position, Readers of this summary may wish to reflect on their own
memory concerning the location and their knowledge of Agency facilities at
any given period of time or when Agency components or related organizations

were organized or ceased to exist.

The point has also been made that any career of NOSENKO

in the KGB sinould have ended or he should have at least encountered
difficulty when his benefactor General KOBULOV, together with the
brother of General KOBULOV, was arrested with the BERIYA group in
early June 1953, NOSZNKO has during current interviews stated that he
encountered no difficuities but is aware that the KOBULOV connection
was discussed.by an officer from the Personnel Directory with an
official of the First Department. Under other circumstances NOSENKO
would very possibly have encountered difficulty; but, it should be noted
that the father of NOSENKO retained his position, that. NOSENKO only
met General KOBULOV through his father, and that NOSENKO has stated
that although his father knew General KOBULOV, his father could in no

way be considered a member of the BERIYA group.

C. NOSENKO did not serve in the American Embassy Section

throughout the 1953 - 1955 period as he claimed, (Previous conclusion)

_ The aoe is conclusion "C" in the previous summary. The
conclusion in this summary is that NOSENKO was an officer of the First
Section (American Embassy Section), First Department, from mid-March
1953 to late May 1955 when he was transferred to the Seventh Department,
scD.

This period of time has been covered in detail with NOSENKO
faucing cuctent interviews, The conclusion is that NOSENiKO was an
officer in the First Section but was not a very effective officer and that
both his work and behavior were decidedly influenced by the fact that he
was the son of the Minister of Shipbuilding. NOSENKXO is reluctant to
admit that he was other than slightly lackadaisical in his work during
this period of time, but is not hesitant to admit that his personal be-
havior was such as to cause him to be removed as Secretary to the

Komsomol] unit in 1954 and to cause an unsatisfactory "characterization"

to be prepared in early 1955 which necessitated a decision as to whether
he would be fired from the KGB or transierred to some other component.

The influence of his family is quite apparent in the above since

his father was advised of his difficulties. in 1954 by an official of the
KGB and his mother interceded on his behalf in 1955 with the Caief of
SCD. The result in 1955 was that NOSENKXO was transferred to the

Seventh Department and not fired from tne KGB.

The question has been raised as to how NOSENKO could remain

in the KGB when after 1954 he was not a member of the Komsomol and

| was not eligivle to become a candidate for the Communist Party. This i
is.a valid question but a plausible explanation is again the fact that he was
the con of the then Minister of Shipbuilding.

NOSENKO has stated curing previous and current interviews that

following his entry into the KGB and until circa mid-1954 he was respon-

sible for work against American correspondents in Moscow. He has not
claimed that he had any successes and has stated that the work te news-
paper correspondents already recruited was being handled by other officers.
NOSENKO has explained that during this time he was a "new officer, "
indicating he could hardly have been expected to act as an experienced

officer. His knowledge of correspondents in Moscow during this period

: information concerning his own agents is delieved of sufficient weight

; to accept the statement of NOSENKO that work against American cor-

respondents was his assignment from mid-March 1953 to mid-1954.

From circa mid-195¢ until his transfer to the Seventh Depart-
ment in late May 1955, NOSENKO ciaims and has claimed he was an
officer of the First Section with the responsibility of work against the
Military‘Attaches (Army) at the United States Embassy in Moscow. It
is considered, based on his knowledge of the various Military Attache
personnel and other collateral information furnished by NOSENKO, that
NOSENKO was an officer.of the First Section during the mid-1954 - late
May 1955. period of time, that his primary work was against members
of the Office of the Military Attache, but that the quality of his work
undoubtedly left much to be desired.

In circa mid-1954, NOSENKO was removed as Secretary of the
Komsomol unit and by early 1955 bis performance was such that at least
certain officials in the First Department desired his removal from the

*
First Department, if not the KGB. Under these circumstances,

NOSENKO could be criticized as having been a very poor if net

NOSENKO has stated that the work against the Military ‘

Attaches was not primarily directed toward development oi recruitment
possibilities, but was directed toward control of the Military Attaches
on trips in order to prevent observation of sensitive areas, sensitive
sites or sensitive activities in the USSR. This attitude by the KGB

NOSENKO has furnished information on the travel of certain
United States Government oificiais, including Congressional represent-
~ 1956; and the trip of Supreme Court Justice

» when consi.ered with the previously

atives to the USSR in 195:

William O, DOUGLAS in 1955 wi

mentioned specifics, adequately substantiate his \..imed service in the
Seventh Department and work against American-B ritish Commonwealth
tourists during the late May 1955 - December 1959 period,

NOSENKO has stressed that when he transferred to the Seventh
Department, the Tourist Section had just been established and an agent
network was not .vailaole for operations against American and British
tourists, This seems quite logical since the infiux of tourists into the
USSR was jwt in,a iormative stage.

NOSENKO has spoken in detail about an agent network he de-
veloped after 1955 which primarily consisted of Intourist personnel
and two homosexual agents, "SHMELEV" and "GRIGORIY" (KGB code
names), whose extensive use in KGB operations has been confirmed by
interviews with individuals who were the subject of homosexual com-
promise operations.

The previous summary contained remarks on pages 101 - 150

during the period of late May 1955 - December 1959. Nor is it con-
ceded that, if all the sub-conclusions and the interpretations of various
areas of information were accepied without quaiification, there is any
evidence that NOSENKO was dispatched by the KGB. However, there
are certain assumptions and interpretations which appeared in the

previous summary which are particularly worthy of comment and which

are considered erroneous or require additional clarification.

On page 145 it is stated that the evidence suggests that NOSENKO

was an English-speaking specialist in sexual entrapment, not a counter-

intelligence officer responsible for the identification of foreign agents

ation

among tourists or for the development, recruitment, and expl
of agents for the KGB. The Second Chief Directorate, KGB, and the
MVD have used homosexual and heterosexual compromise in numerous
known (and'presumably unknown) successful recruitments and recruit-
ment attempts. This activity has not been limited to the Seventh Depart-

ment, SCD; and the innuendo that NOSENKO was "

in the notes furnished to CIA in 1964 by NOSENKO. The named operations

than to say that he had recorded the name of the target and such details

as he could acquire when he reviewed. the activities of the Seventh Depart-
ment in 1962 following his return from the First Department.

The notes brought out by NOSENO are considered in another

section of this summary, but it should be noted here that a full review
of all of the notes of NOSENKO currently available indicates that his
statements as to how and why he obtained the information in the notes
are completely plausible. A detailed explanation of the notes furnished

to visit relatives in the USS“, the case automaticaily was assigned toa
group of officers in the Section who reported directiy to the Chief of
Section and were, not under the supervision of NOSENKO,

NOSENKO has stated that he noted the names of three of the
individuals when retiring the files of "GRIGORIY" and "SHMELEV,"
two homosexual agents of NOSENKO previously mentioned. NOSENKO
has explained that "SHMELEV" and "GRIGORIY" had the assignment of
identifying American travelers with homosexual tendencies, that they
had contact with numerous Americans, and that they-had homosexual
activity with individuals on whom they reported but on whom no overt

action was taken by the Seventh Department, In some cases the individual

the notes which NOSENKO brought out in 1964 have been discussed in
detail with NOSENKO, He has given a detailed explanation of the material
which he brought out and his explanation of all aspects is very convincing.

The previous summary (page 144) suggested that the involvement
of NOSENKO in certain cases being handled by other Sections in the
Seventh Department or by the KGB Directorate of Moscow was unusual,
An examination of the cited cases does not indicate that his participation
was unusual, but rather that his explanation of why he was involved is
logical and normal, No consideration was previously given to the English
language capability of NOSENKO or the fact that his own homosexual agents
were used in two of the four cited cases,

This question seems quite superf:

us since aA: 1} # in the USSR

tourists are the respo

on a tourist visa and "real"

woility of the Seventa
Department. Departmental responsibility within the SCD for an indi-
vicual traveling in tie USSR is decided on the basis of how the individual
is traveling; i,e., whether on a tourist visa, as a rember of a delegation, *
as the invitee of an organization in the USSR, asa former diplomat
stationed in Moscow, as a diplomat not previously stationed in Moscow,

as a member of the Cultural Exchange program, as a student attending

a university in the USSR, etc. There are also various other factors

which affect the determination of which Department or organizational
component of the SCD has the responsibility for a tourist case, These

factors include whether the individual is already suspected of foreign

intelligence connections and whether the i

vidual is a businessman,

In ad on, certain actual tourists in the USSR may never become the
responsibility oi the SCD if the individual is of specific interest to the
FCD.
.
On pages 148 - 149, NOSENKO is criticized for not knowing at
least some of the substance of the information furnished by George
BLAKE in regard to the CIA-MI-6 program of utilizing tourist agents

inthe USSR. This criticism completely ignored the fact that NOSENKO

made severai references in 1962 to the KGB having such information

although he did then and still suspects that William VASSALL was the

mation were not developed in 1962 or later interrogations, and it was

erviews ihat it was esiabiisned that NOSE?

not until current in O had

actually seen excerpts of information passe by George BLAKE.

According to NOSENKXO, the information which was obviously only

partial was furnished to the FCD by the SCD and could only have come

from an agent, !
The previous summary (page 149) also notes that in 1961 CIA
acquired a lengthy Top Secret study on the subject of the use of tourists

by American Intelligence for espionage and operational support in the

Soviet Union (document was iurnished by GOLITSYN following nis de-
fection in December 1961). it was noted that the summary contained
references to certain 1958 - 1959 tourists whom the KGB counter-
intelligence identified as Amcrican agents and noted that NOSENKO
claimed he was Deputy Chief oi the American-British Commonwealth
Section in this period of time and that he claimed the KGB identified

no American Intelligence agents curing this period of time. What later
is described as a claim by NOSENKO is neither an accurate reflection
of what NOSENKO said prior to 1967 or has said since 1967.

NOSENKO as never claimed to kiow ali activities against

American traveiers in the Soviet Union curing 1958 -.1959. Many
of these travelers would have been the reaponsibility of a section in

the Seventh Depart:nent, other than the American-Britisa Commen-

we:

th Section, or another Department in the SCD. NOSENKO was
quite aware that certain of the American touriste in 1958 - 1959 were
acting suspiciously from a KGB point of view.

NOSENKO has stated he was aware that a document which the
Seventh Department had prepared and furnished to the FCD in an effort
to obtain further assistance from the FCD in the work against tourists
had been compromised by GOLITSYN. NOSENKO stated he was not in
the Seventh Department when the document was prepared and did not
review the document until after tne defection of GOLITSYN and foliow-
ing advice from the FCD to the Seventh Department, SCD, that the
document had been compromised. The document furnished by GOLITSYN
has never béen reviewed with NOSENKO to determine if it contained
additional information not in the document which he was aware had :
been prepared by the Seventh Department ior the FCD.

NOSENKO has been impugned on his apparent unfamiliarity with
a number of cases cited as examples in the document furnished by

that the KGB had rescons to coneider the activitles of

It ip not balleved that the lated failures of NOSENKO to identify
CIA officers ave of particular significance tn establiching that he was
ov wag not Deputy Chief of the First Section. There are too many an-
Known factors wich would need to be considered. Despite our ascump-
tions as to what the KGB knows, it is possible that (0) the KGB did not
know of the CIA affiliation of these people, (b) the information known
to the KGS was not available at the First Section, First Department,
level, or (c) information available to the Chief of the Firat Section or
to a specific cass officer waa of no official concern to NOSENKO and
was not made svailable to him. The last of these possibilities ts
suggested in spite of claims by NOSENKO that be had to have known
whatever was known in the Section regarding CIA identifications; a
propensity on the part of NOSENKO to exeggerate the area of his own
knowledgeability hse been ceen cleowhere in this cage.

Pages 252 - 258 of the previous summary contala a report of
the 1960 trip of NOSENKO to Cuba and bis 1961 trip to Bulgaria. With
regard to the Cuba trip, there is collateral evidence of his travel as
described by NOSENKO, and there is no substantive reason to doubt

his account of his activities on this trip. The statement was made in

F, NOSENKO's claims, that in 1962 he was Chief of the
American-British Commonwealth Section and was thereafter a

Deputy Chief of the Seventh Department, are not credible. (Previous

conclusion)

The conclusion of this pleuRinle is that NOSENKO was Chief
of the American-British Commonwealth Section (First Section) from
January 1962 to July 1962 and that he was.a Deputy Chief of the Seventh
- Department thereafter. _

NOSENKO has. stated that, although he was offered the position
of a Deputy Chief of the First Department, SCD, by Oleg M. CRIBANOV,
Chief, SCD, and although an order had been prepared and was in the
Personnel Directorate, he declined the proffered position.

According to NOSENKO, he knew that Sergey Mikhaylovich
FEDOSEYEV, the Chief of the First Department, did not want NOSENKO
as a Deputy Chief, but instead wanted to promote Vladislav KOVSHUK,

then Chief of the First Section, to the position. FEDOSEYEV was

CoOL2ia

1
p



willing to promote NOSENKO to the position of Chief, First Section.
However, GRIBANOV cid not wish to promote KOVSHUK and NOSENKO
considered that under the circumstances it would be better for him to
return to the Seventh Department rather than to become a Deputy to
FEDOSEYEV who wanted KOVSHUKas a Deputy,

Vladimir Dmitriyevich CHELNOKOV had offered NOSENKO the
position of Chief-of the First Section, Seventh Department, pending the
reassignment of BALDIN to Germany at which time NOSENKO would
become a Deputy Chief, Seventh Department, replacing BALDIN. The
above explanation of NOSENKO. seems plausible and credible and indi-
cates that GRIBANOV, the Chief of the SCD, for reasons best known to
GRIBANOV, was assisting NOSENKO in his career in the KGB.

This section actually covers two periods in the claimed career
of NOSENKO; namely, January - July 1962 as Chief of the First Section,
and July 1962 - January 1964 as a Deputy Chief of the Seventh Depart-
ment, Since NOSENKO oe in Geneva, Switzerland, from March to
June 1962, he actually cannot be seriously faulted for not having de-
tailed knowledge of the activities of the First Section during January -
July 1962, The previous summary (pages 268 - 291) contains remarks

in regard to the January - July 1962 period, including the period of

g his statement of purpose

Pages 282 - 286 of the previous summary revicws remarks by
NOSENKO on the Boris BELITSKIY case and cetates that his claimed role

in the case was not plausible. There are several s}ccific points made in

the summary which imply that NOSENKO was lying about his knowledge of
the case, Taere is adequate reason to believe that NOSENKO exaggerated
his own 1962 role in that NOSENKO now states he was to give assistance

to Vladimir Lvovich ARTEMOV in the handling of BELITSKIY in Geneva

in 1962 and rot to supervise ARTEMOV.

The more important aspect and the primary one is the difference in
what NOSENKO specifically reported about the BELITSKIY case and infor~
mation from the actual CIA record of the case, There are major difier-
ences and without going into all the details of the case which is very involved,
‘an effort has been made toward determining whether these apparent differ-
ences necessarily indicate that NOSENKO was or is lying or whether there
is a possibility he is relating the actual KGB version of the case.

NOSENKO has stated that BELITSKIY was a KGB agent whom

American Intelligence recruited in London in 1960 or 1961 and that the

; 0001223 .
6 i
SECRET

\AR



KGB purpose in running the operation was to-lure American Intelligence
into meeting BELITSKIY inside the USSR. The previous summary stated
that NOSENKO did not know when the BELITSKI~ operation started :
(Brussels, Belgium, 1958}, did not know the nature of the British
involvement, did n:t know the operational details and contact arrange=
ments BELITSKIY had with CIA, and did not know BELITSKIY's pattern
of activity in Moscow or Geneva.

NOSENKO during current interviews has indicated an awareness
that the KGB (Second Section, First Department) had been trying to use
BELITSKIY against the British. However, he still has dated the recruit-
ment of BELITSKIY as 1960-1961 in London and still states that the
primary purpose of the KGB was to involve American Intelligence in
contacts with BELITSKIY within the USSR, The latter was considered
completely inconsistent with the fact that BELITSKIY was recruited in
Brussels, Belgium, in 1958; that three letters had been mailed to
BELITSKIY in the USSR in 1959 and early 1960; and that BELITSKIY
had an accommodation address for contact outside the USSR.

: There are at this time sufficient unresolved questions in the
BELITSKIY case to preclude any conclusion that the apparent dis-
exepancies between the statements by NOSENKO on the BELITSKIY

case and the actual record are a reflection against NOSENKO,

the other hand, there is some reason to believe NOSENKO has
furnished the actual KGB version of the BELITSKIY case and that the

KGB, at least as of 1962,

id not Know the true story of the relation-
ship of BELITSKIY with CIA, There is a distinct possibility the
KGB believed the BELITSXIY recruitment occurred in 1961 in London
and BELITSKIY did not then nor has he since admitted to the KGB
uis association with CIA actually started in 1958 in Brussels, Belgium. |
As a possible reason why BELITSKIY would have told the KGB in
1961 a partial story of his contact with American Intelligence, some:
at present unknown event may have occurred in 1961 which caused
BELITSKIY to believe his security was endangered and as a result ;
he told the KGB of certain events in London in 1961, relating these
events as being the original approach to BELITSKIY by GIA.

"the following are certain of the points which suggest the KGB
actually considered that BELITSKIY was recruited by CIA in London

’ :

in 196] and that BELITSKIY may have never told the KGB of the
developments in his case prioz to 196];

(a) BELITSKIY was in London in April 1960 at which
time he was in contact with a British citizen who was also ~ Cottee

received from BELITSKIY which may have been a lead to

George BLAKE, (It seems highly uniixely the KGB would

ever have directed BELITSKIY to furnish information which

may have been a lead to George BLAKE, or at least could

have caused the employees of the unit in which BLAKE was

employed from June 1959 to August 1960 to come under

suspicion as having passed information to Soviet Intelligence. }
(b) NOSENKO has stated that BELITSKIY, after he went

to Geneva in 1962, managed to reinitiate contact with CIA

rather quickly because he met a girl he had previously known

whom he was sure was an American Intelligence agent and

that she must have reported his presence in Geneva to American

Intelligence. (If the BELITSKIY case had been controlled by the

KGB from its inception in 1958, the KGB would have known of

the internal mailings to BELITSKIY and the fact that BELITSKIY |

had a cover address outside the Soviet Union through which to,

initiate contact, However, if BELITSKIY did not tell the KGB

anything about his contacts with CIA prior to 1961 and-then

gave only a partial story of what happened in London in 1961,

BELITSKIY would not have told the KGB of the internal mail-
ings to BELITSKIY in the USSR or the fact that he long had

..that CIA had warned BELITSKIY against SHULGINA." The previous

whi previously in Paris, France.

E

As previously indicated, the conclusion is there are a sufficient
number of unresolved questions in the BELITSKIY case 60 that discrep-
ancies between information {:om NOSENKO and the actual record in the
BELITSKIY case cannot at present be considéred as a reflection against
NOSENKO, and there is a distinct possibility the KGB actually did not
know the true facts of the BELITSKIY case.

The previous summary noted on page 106 that Nataliya SHULGINA
was an Intourist interpreter recruited by NOSENKO in 1955, It also

noted that NOSENKO had stated Boris BELITSKIY “reported to the KGB

summary stated BELITSKIY reported to CIA that SHULGINA was a KGB
agent and "CIA did not warn BELITSKIY,"

There appears to be no doubt at this time that the statement by
NOSENKO that BELITSKIY reported the "CIA had warned BELITSKIY
against SHULGINA," is a reasonably accurate description of what actualy
happened in May 1962 during Agency contacts with BELITSKIY in Geneva,
The record reflects that BELITSKIY stated SHULGINA had confidentially
told him of her status as a KGB agent, stating she had been doubled by

the KGB after having been forcibly recruited by American Intelligence

6001228
n

SECRET



Ue

It was determined there was no collateral information which

would i

dicate that the statement by SHIULGINA had any factual basis

and BELITSKIY was warned SHULGINA may have been acting on behaif

of the KGB in stating to BELITSKIY she had been "Jorcibly recruited by
American Intelligence" at a previous date. It was also suggested to
BELITSKIY that he should go to the KGB as a loyal Soviet citizen and
report the apparent indiscretion of SHULGL“A,

Pages 282 ~ 286 of the previous summary, in connection with

the BELITSKIY case, made reference to Vladimir Lvovich ARTEMOV.

It was stated that ARTEMOV had been involved with a series of America:;
tourist agents in the Sovict Union and although NOSENKO was allegedly
familiar with ARTEMOV, he was unaware of the involvement of ARTEMOV
with American tourist agents in 1958 - 1959, The summary noted this
was during a period when NOSENKO claimed to have been Deputy Chief

of the American-British Commonwealth Section of the Seventh Depart-
ment, Although not specifically stated, the above suggested ARTEMOV,
‘was actually in the Seventh Department in 1958 - 1959 and that NOSENKO
was not even aware ARTEMOV was in the Seventh Department. NOSENKO
has consistently stated that ARTEMOV was assigned to the First Section,

First Department, from the time he entered into the KGB in approxi-

mately 1957.

12 00014229

SECRET



A closer examination of the cases described in the previous
summary as "CIA American tourist agents," reveals there is no con-
flict in the involvement of ARTEMOV in these cases and the statement
by NOSENKO that ARTEMOV was with the First Section, First Depart-
ment, Asan example, one of the cases is the case of| Edward MeGOWAN} Ob
NOSENKO has furnished information concerning thie case, stating it was
originally a Seventh Department case and that after the mailing of a letter :
by the individual in Minsk, the case was immediately taken over by the
Firet Department, There is adequate reason to believe ARTEMOV only
became involved after the case was transferred to the First Department,

Another of the cases involved the contact of ARTEMOV with]a CIA

and visited the USSR ona tourist visa. Such an individuai would under

no circumstances be considered a true tourist or the responsibility of

the Seventh Department, particularly since apparently the individual was _
even traveling under a diplomatic passport. it is, assume the individual
was of interest to the First Chief Directorate and if the Fi1st Chief
Directorate required or desired support from the SCD, it would normally
request the First Department for such assistance and it is extremely un-

likely that the FCD would request the Seventh Department jor assistance

ina case involving an American diplomat,

Pages 332 - 333 of the previous summary contain the basis

for the previous conclusion that the claim of NOSENKO that he was a
Deputy Chief of the Seventa Department from July 1962 to January

1963 was not credible. It is considered that a detailed rebuttal is

not fiecessary since this conclusion was apparently based on inadequate
information, During current interviews, NOSENKO has furnished
details concerning his duties and other aspects of his claimed position
which substantiate his claim to kaving been a Deputy Chief of the
Seventh Department from July 1962 to January 1964.

‘An example in support of the statement that the previous conclu-
sion was based on inadequate information is the matter of the written
notes which NOSENKO brought out and furnished to CIA in early 1964.-
The description of these notes on page 319 of the previous summary is
inadequate, inaccurate, and misleading. Prior to current interviews,
an effort had not been made to obtain from NOSENKO a detailed expian=
ation of his notes or of how he obtained the information in the notes.

During current interviews, NOSENKO has given detailed informa-
tion concerning ail aspects of bis notes. This information supports his
claimed position of Deputy Chief of the Seventh Department and includes
collateral support to his claim of being Deputy Chief of the First Section,

First Department, in 1960 - 1961. i 6001231

ererererers

Primarily the OSENKO can be categorized as
follows:
- (a) Snort case summaries by the Chiefs of the
First Section, Second Section and Sixth Section, Seventh 7

Hf Department, NOSENKO has stated that he was in 1962 -

1963 responsibie for supervision over these Sections and

that Filip Denisovich BOBKOV,. Deputy Chief, SCD, who
supervised the Seventh Department, requested a list of all
recruited agents of the Seventh Department, According to
NOSENKO, the order irom BOBKOV was to only retain the
files (cases) of agents in tourist firms and that the files of
other recruited agents should be sent to the FCD or Archives.
NOSENKO has stated that ne in turn levied on the Chiefs of
the tnree Sections the requirement of BOBKOV, but also ex-

panded the request to include ail 1960 - 1962 cases, not

excluding previous cases or cases which had already been
given to the FCD, The notes of NOSENKO included hand-
written reports from the Chief or Acting Chief of each Section
on recruited agents, with information varying from agent to
agent and even including some human errors.

Many of the above cases had previously been trans-

ferred to the FCD, but the remarks of NOSENKO about thei (4232

inclusion support his statement that he had expanded
the original request irom BOBKOV so that he would have’;
some "pieces of information to give CIA.""

{b) Notes by NOSENKO on other cases which he learned
of during the 1962 ~ 1963 period. Certain of the notes were
made from a review of a notebook kept by the Chief, Seventh
Department, to which NOSENKO had access on at least two
occasions. Most of his notes were not detailed but were
sufficient to refresh the memory of NOSENKO at a later
date and yet were somewhat innocuous to maintain before
his defection,

(c) Notes for lectures to officers of the Seventh Directorate
prepared while with the First Department, 1960'- 1961, and

The view has been set forth th
carrying written notes with him out of the Soviet Union, An examination
of this material suggests that NOSENKO was using extreme care in
collecting material and was not attempting to obtain décuments, the
possession of which might be incriminating or which if he had brought
out would have been immediately missed. Instead, he collected a con-
siderable amount of valuable information which he could bring out with
little or no fear that a search of his effects in the KGB after his depart-
ure for Geneva would disclose that certain material was missing. None
of the material was registered and all could have previously been des-
troyed by NOSENKO,

The previous summary stated that NOSENKO brought three KGB
documents to Geneva. These were typed papers but none was registered
or actually accountable. The reference to three documents was to:

(a) The drait report for the briefing of the Collegium
which has been mentioned previously.
(b) A.typed two-page report on several cases, Actually

a Chief of Section had typed his notes on cases instead of

submitting in handwriting as the others did,

$ no valid claim to certainty that the KGB

recruited no American Embassy personnel between 1953 and his

defection in 1964, (Previous conclusion)

The conclhision in this summary is that NOSENKO is of the

opinion that there were no KGB recruitments of United States Embassy
personnel in Moscow between 1953 and December 1963 with the exception
of "ANDREY" (Dayle Wailis SMITH) and joxbort HOWARD) who actually

was alUSIA| employee but did work part of the time in the Embassy.

The question here is whether or not the expressed opinion of
NOSENKO is suificiently based on actual knowledge so that this opinion
can be accepted as absolute evidence that there were no other KGB

recruitments of Embassy personnel during this period of time. -The

only logieal conclusion is that the opinion of NOSENKO cannot be
accepted as absolute fact and, therefore, ‘there is a possibility that

@ recruitment could have occurred and NOSENKO not be aware in any
way of the Deel This should in no way be interpreted as a
suggestion that NOSENKO could be lying, but rather that an unbiased
observer without personal knowledge could and should be hesitant to
accept the expressed opinion of NOSENKO in this particular area.

“The actual basis for the stated opinion of NOSENKO. #1 be
Noeemgou Lede

examined and can be cited as follows.



Pe eee syrEn ener eee

C.

(a) During Marca 1953-late May 1955 NOSENKO
was a case officer in the First Section, First Department,
SCD, .NOSENKO does not claim that he would kave known
the detaiis concerning any recruitments (other than
"ANDREY") in this period, dut states if there had been
ke would have heard "something."

(o) During late May 1955 to December 1959 NOSENKO
was in the Seventh Department, not the First Department,
but continued to have contact with certain officers in the
First Section, First Department, NOSENKO is of the
opinion that if there had been a recruitment in the United
States Embassy during this period he would have heard
"something" even though he would probably have learned
few details,

(c) During the January 1960-December 1961 period
NOSENKO was Deputy Chief of the First Section, First
Department, and he has made the categorical statement
that there were no recruitments by the KGB of United
States Embassy personnel during this period of time.

He has also stated that if there had been any recruitments
during the 1953-1959 period he is sure he would, during
1960-1961, have heard or learned some details of tag)(){ 238

case or cases. There is merit to this contention by



NOSENKO since the Chief of Section was Vladislav
KOVSHUK who had been an officer of the First Depart-
ment since 1953, actually working in the First Section
except for the periods of time that he was in the United
States to reactivate "ANDREY" in 1957-1958 and a
period of time that he was Deputy Chief of the First
Department. i :

(a) During 1962-1983 NOSENKO was again in the
Seventh Department. However, he continued to maintain
contact with certain officers of the First Section, First
Department: in particular, Gennadiy I. GRYAZNOV,
who succeeded NOSENKO as Deputy Chief of the First
Section, then became Chief of Section, and in the latter
part of 1963 became a Deputy Chief oi the First Department.

According to NOSENKO his relationship with
GRYAZNOV was sufficiently close during 1962-1963 that
he is sure GRYAZNOV would have furnished NOSENKO
some information in regard to any successful recruitments
of United States Embassy personnel, NOSENKO pointed
out that ke learned of the existence of the [Herbert B8wans|
case from GRYAZNOV in 1962, although it was not until

1963 that NOSENKO heard the name. NOSENKO actually

0001239

s SECRET

learned of the namo when the First Section, First
Department, needed the services of the Seventh
Department (Third Section) in obtaining a room in a

06
certain hotel for the Soviet girl friend offowann}

In gonaral the above constitutes the basis for the stated opinion
of NOSENKO that "ANDREY" and|Herbert Aes the only
successful KGB recruitments during 1953 - December 1963. It should
be noted that there are no other identified KGB recruitments during
this period of time which would specifically refute the opinion of
NOSENKO. However, in view of the cited actual basis for the opinion
of NOSENKO, acceptance of the opinion of NOSENKO as being an
honest opinion should not be converted into 2 statement that it is
absolute proof that another recruitment could not have occurred,
NOSENKO may be completely correct in his opinion, but since
NOSENKO was only in the First Department 1953 - 1955 and 1960 - 1961
hiz opinion that he wovld have heard “something” about a recruitment

in 1955 - 1959 or 1962 - 1963 annot be accepted as infallible.
