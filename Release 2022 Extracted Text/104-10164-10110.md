Mr. CHARLES for inclusion in the Biographic Intelligence

This suenary

1s nade up of information obtainod fron several different

Bources.

One source classifies CHARLES as & slippery

character who is active on the Haltian scene jand refers to

Dim as &

"promoter"",

rather than a jusinessman, who endeavers

to attract:United States "venture" capttal for various

¡astian projects and then becomes a partner by virtue of

the promotion.

Biographics Register has & very high opinion

of this Source, who

1s the Stute Department's Haiti Desk

During a debriefing, on CHARLES, In' February 1983,

this same source stated thai CHARLES 18 & confidant of

President Divaller and that he has emerged sa an setive

businessman by virtue of his priviledged position mith the

President.

2.

Another source of inforustion regarding CHARLES'

business Interests, 1s the President of the National Bank of

PERSONS VYING FOR POVER AFTER THE FALL OF PRESIDENT DUVALIER.

THEY ARE JOSETH CLEMARD CHARLES, PRESIDENT OF THE HAITIAN

BANK OF COMMERCE, CLOVIS DESINOR, MINISTER OF FINANCE, AND

LUCKNER CAMBRONNE, MINISTER OF PUBLIC WORKS: EACH OF THEM

HAVE THE IR SUPPORTERS WITHIN THE GOK OR DUVALIER POWER

STRUCTURES AND SOME HAVE SUPPORT FROM SOME OPPOSITIONISTS.

ALL INSEE REMAIN OUTWARDLY PRO-DUVALIERIST AND THERE ARE

NO SIGNS THAT THEY INTEND TO TRY TO OVERTHROW DUVALIER

THEMSELVES. THEY ARE PRESENTLY JOCKEYING. FOR SUPPORT FOR

THE IR BID FOR POVER WHEN DUVALIER LEAVES THE PRESIDENCY.

2. CLOVIS DESINOR IS CONSIDERED TO BE THE MOST

POWERFUL. HE HAS THE SUPPORI OF COLONEL JACQUES LAROCHE,

ASSISTANT CHIEF OF STAFF, AND IS WIDELY CONSIDERED TO BE

A RUTHLESS AND UNSCRUPULOUS SEEKER OF POWER: (SOURCE

WAS DISMISSED FROM THE ARMY AND TOOK ASYLUM IN THE BRAZILIAN

EMBASSY. THE HOUSE OF CAMBRONNE'S MISTRESS, NEE LAFOREST,

WHO IS THE SISTER OF MRS BEAUVOIR, WAS PILLAGED BY THE

MILITIA. ALONG WITH.THE HOUSE OF BEAUVOIR, AND THIS IS.

INTERPRETED BY MANY OBSERVERS AS AN INDICATION OF CAMBRONNE'S

LACK OF INFLUENCE WITHIN THE GOH HIERARCHY. WITHIN THE PALACE

IT IS RUMORED THAT CAMBRUNNE WILL NOT

BE ALLOWED TO KEEP HIS DEPUTY'S

SEAT FROM ARCAHAIE IN THE JANUARY ELECTION AND THAT HE WILL

BE REPLACED BY DABELMAR MENTOR. (FIELD COMMENT!

IN 1961, DABELMAR MENTOR WAS SECRETARY GENERAL OF
