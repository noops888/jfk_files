sources. One source classifies CHARLES as aislippery
eharacter who is active on the Haitian scene/and refers to
him as a "promoter" rather than Uusinessman, who endeavers
to attract United States "venture" ‘capital for various
Haitian projects and then becomes a partner by virtue of

the promotion. Biographics Registe! ‘haa a very high opinion
of this Source, who is the State Department's Haiti Desk
Office: During a debriefing on CHARLES, in) February 1963,
this same source stated that CHARLES is a confidant of
President Duvaiier, and that he hi emerged a8 an active
businessman by virtue of his priviledged position with the
President. . rot ils }

@, Another source of information regarding CHARLES'
business interests, is the President .9f the National Bank of

peasant origin. It was in thie town that he received bia primary and seoundary educa

. 20 was alee in thin Artibenite that he began’ the struggle for life, first as a raral

Ceacher. His father's death in 1939 marked a stare in bio life. He had to take over

. the heavy responsibikity of meeting his family needs. Charles then proved to bea

@isciplined man and became successively craftenan, plantation superviscr, without
GAving up intellectual etudies; he ventured in journalics as an amateur, Ae a progreo=

with the Goneral “leotrio of Coventry for the improvement and extoneion of our tele=

POO! FOR TEE RECORD

cms caren ofFOR RELEASE,

1. On & April 1963 Dorothe Metlack, Domestic Exploitation
Section, ACSI, telephonel tu the effect that a banner named Clemrd
Joseph Charles had left Haiti six days earlier and hed Just arrived
in tiew York. A friend of Charles, namei Joseph Dryer, 10) Lakewood
Avenue, West Palm Beach, lorida, had written to General Delmar,
former CG Antilles Command, recommending Charles as a mn of crent
interest to the US covernment in view of the events in Haiti. Charles
sas described as President of the Banc Commercicle, fort au Prince,
Haiti, who is in President Duvalier's favor. Mra, Matlack mentioned
that she had alerted Col. Sam Kail in Ninml to contact Dryer in
order to obtain more backgroun inYormtion und an acsescment on
Charles. . 7

2. On 1 May 63 Mrs, Mntlack adviced that Charles was staying at
the Pork Sheraton Wotel, New York, ahd thnt he had telephoned her
since her nane had becn cupplied to him by Dryer. Charles considered
her to be his point of contact in Washington. According to Hrs. Natlack,
Charles had appointments to see Vico President Johnson, Senator Keating,
ana Congressman Rogers (Florida). Mowever, Charles was willing to talk
to representatives of Mrs. Hatlack's office. Mrs. Matlack stated that
the Idtinn Desk man in ACSI vas ready to go to New York to talk to
Charles and invited CIA to accompany him. Charles speake very little
Englich and a fluency in French was therefore required for the inter=
view. Mrs. Matlack stated that she might be able to obtain a French
Lingulot from Firct Amy, Governor's Island, but he would not be an
intelligence officer. It was decided’ thnt James Balog, New York
Office, who hac a Anowledge of the French language would accompany
the ACSI representative! It wuc aloo arranged that
Balog would meet the A sentative (Captain Rogers) at the Park
Sheraton Hotel where Charles was staying.

3+ On 2 May 63 Mra. Matiack reported that Col. Kail had interviewed
Mr, Dryer in West Talm Beach. Dryer had appointed Charles as Director
of his bank in Haiti. Charles, according to Dryer, formerly had no
political ambitions but in view of the current political situation in
Faiti, Charles now thinks that he may some day bs precident.- Dryer
deceribed Charles as well-connected, politically and finnncially, on
both aides of the fence in Haiti. He 1s aloo a good friend of President
Duvalier. Dryer had given Charles letters of introduction to Senator
Keating ondto other officials in Washington. Charles wanted to see
President Kennedy and indeed had gone to tle White louse to arrange
for on appointment. Mo wun well received by the President's appoint-
Ment secretary and invited to dinner that evening with the appointment

seereuicy, Throwh a misunderitim ling, however, Charles did not’
attend the dinner but went to New Yori insteal.

&, Charles is travellin:, according to Urrer, with a Texan
geologist naned de Nohrenschilit. dé Mohrensshilét is associnted
with Charles in a business venture in Haiti and is trying to arrange

a meeting for Charles vith Vice Sresident Johnson.

5. On 3 May 63 Jim Balog telephoned to advise that he had had a
five-hour session the previous day with Charles and that he had
obtaine] both personality data and views by Charles on what the
United States should do in the current dattian situation. Balog
advised that he vas transmitting the information to Washington.

m arrival, copies of the teletynes were tronsmitted to ACSI
(ire, Matlack), YH Division, and the Latin America Branch.

6. On 6 May 63 Mayo Stuntz, Support Branch, advised that WH
Division wished to speak to Charles and Balog wos esked to arrange
an appointment. Mrs. Matinck telephoned at approximately 1715 to
advise that she had juct reeeivel a telephcne call from Mrs. de
Mohrenschildt asiing assistance in obtaining hotel reservations in
Washinston. Upon being told that ve had no szecisl means of obtain-
ing reservations, Mrs. Matlack stated thst she would check with the
State Department Protocol Office to determine which hotels vould
admit negro guests. Mrs. Nntinck finally made recervations at the
Alban Sowers. A check with Jim Balog revealed that he had arranged
for Charles to meet the Wil representative in the lotby of the Willard
Hotel, Washington, D. C., at 19:00 noon on 7 tny. Attempts to reach
Mrs. Matlact that afternoon were unsuccensful, At 0830, 7 May, a
call was made to Mrs, Matlack te confirm that Charles would be in
Washington on that day ond that arrangements had been made for a
meeting with an Agency renrenentative for 12:00 neon. Mrs. Matlack
retorted that both Mro. de Mohrenschildt and Charles had calied her
that previous evening to confirm a 12:00 luncheon appointment with
her. Mrs. Matlack vac concerned that CIA and Army should not be
working at cross purposes. ‘he had received anthorization from
ACSI to meet Charles nt lunch and felt that it would not be politic
for her to withdrn fram her appointment since Aray considered her

: the point of coatace with Charles, Mayo Stunt: informed Wi Division

of the conflict and passed on the ougrestion that the WH Division
reprecentative might meet Charlen on’ Mra, Nat‘ack at noon and that
Mrs. Matlack offered to vithdrew chortly thereafter, The ¥H repre-
sentative declinvd the offer and requested that o mecting later in

flieting instructions, she had been placed in the middle in the
situation from which che could not graciously withdraw ond requested
