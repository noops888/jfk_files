SUAISCT? Cecresioat Reseue Cosmittec or formerly ‘International
» 4 Rescue aml Reltef Comittee {TRIC).

1. Reference {s made to the request of Mr. Abajian on 15 Decender 1954
for information concerning the above naned organization ani individuals asov-

" elated vith the orgeniration.

2, Dr. Bela GAMTAY, a former major in the Royal Hungarian Police, sub-
sittod a document to the Departzext of State charging the "RC and various
renbers of the orgentzation vith futher tig; the interesta of Cocmuniss unier
tha guise of an anti-Communist relic? crgmmication, The files of ‘his office
contaia no deregtary information en Bcla CAMTAY, Hio true name is appar-
ently De. Adnibert GANTAY, born 20 arch 1910 in Budapest, ikmgary. A res
port of £2 Hovesber 1949 indicated that Subject hod proviously been active.
for a Weatern Intelligente group in activities directed against the Soviet

Union.

3. Ascording to a report of 30 March 1953, the International Rescue

and Relief Comittee (IRC) with offices at 103 Park Avenue, New York City

~ apd 35 Boulevard deo Cagecines, Paris, is an cutgrovth of the former Inter-
national Helief Cuaittes and the Hoergency Relief Comittee. It was formed
originally to assiet refugees from Mari Germany, Since 1955 it hee functioned
oa an anti-Faseist arganization assisting refugces without regard to nation
ality. It was otated in the report that the INC, though’ not ostensibly a
Comamist organization, hed several Camsmnists affiliated with it.

&. A relisble sourve reported on 15 March 1950 that one-third of the
budget of the International Rescue Comittee for 1943 ami 1949 was expended
in France in connscuion vith Spaniards in exile, vho were considerably

_ penetrated by Comamist influence. David MARTIN, described by Source as the
principal force witaing the IRC, vas referred to as an ex-Trotskyite of con-

sidsrable ability and encryy,

5S. It vas stated in a report dated 20 March 1959 from a reliable source
that <ioce vorid War Ti, the IRC hea come under suspicion as a possible

: Is

oy
Mt



espa 37!

Cosmmist organization or clever front organization used by Camamists for
intelligence purjcses. It vas noted that in the United States ami Buroye
the IRC maintained cloce contact with anti-Govict enigre groups.

6. ip summary, various allegations have been made against mubers of :
the IRC to the effect that they are Marxists, Counmists or at leest Soolale :
feta. Hona of these proffered opinions can be cubstantiated; yet, it 16
Plnuible that the organisation kas been penetrated by Camamist agents, The i
Gegree of control, if any, exercised by then cannot be determined from a ree
view of the available material, nor can it be deteruined with certainty who i
in the organization are ectunlly Commists. Attached hereto 1 available
inferastion concerning the following {mlividuals motioned in GARTAY's report) _

‘specirme— Report on Satellite nationals in the North German Area.

1. In.1945 the total nucber of refugees in West Gernany amounted
to 10 millions of people. By 1953 this nuzber had been reduced to
approximately 240,000, where 4t has remained relatively static ever
since. Of this latter number, approximately 12,373 (or ca. 5 % of
the total) were located in the Hamburg area. As a group, they are
youthful and prolific. Approximately 12% are social cas.c, 50% are
active and employable adults, 8% are e=zloyed by the occupation
authorities and over 25% are unemploy

2. The overall percentage of non-German refugees anong the native
population is .46%. In Hamburg this fisure ie .73% waile Schloswig-
» Holstein with the greatest concentration in Germany has a total number
of refugees inoluding German amounting to over 30% of the entire population.

3. The national refugee groups in Hamburg as of 1 January 1953
were as follows:

Bulgarians w 2 4997 Poles (including Ukrainian) 3952
Cacchs(4 So Caaks? 3215 Rouzainans 470
Eothonians 182 Russians 442
Hungoriane 954 Yugoslava 1020
Latvians 97 Stateless 1.2829.
Lithuanian 241 TOTAL 12373

Of this totel of 12373 approziaately 7000 may be considered ‘active and |
employable and 5400 as non-active and unemployable. Of the 7000, 5000
are ezployed and 2000 unemployed. On this date they were located as

follors in Hamburgt

It is interesting to compare the figure 2204 with the totel for Hamburg
refugee camps in Table A, 2189, and also with the figure in Table B,
2018 (17 February 1955) to show how statio these figures are. (Table As
June 1952). Also of interest is tae fact that the ratio of these in
oamps to those outside is generally 513 (Table A), while Sor Hanburg,
the ratio is closer to 1/5. Of greatest interest to us of course are

6. fable C for Niedersachsen is included to shor that the statiatics
for 1952 given in Table A still apply. ‘The total in 1952 of non-Serman
refugees in Land Niedersachsen was 11,746. The figure on 1 January 1955

was 11,650, three years later.

7. Tochow why the German authorities tend to psy less attention

to the non-German refugees, the figures for Geraan refugees for Land
1953 are included in Table D. (See also

Niedersachsen as of 1 Au,

figures in 5 above.) If one includes those Geraans receiving aid

for losses resulting from the war, then the fisure is 162,186 in 1623 camps

as opposed to 11,746 in 28 camps for the Non-Gernans.

@. Thus aeé¢efforts should properly be directed at those agencie

primarily concerned with tae Kon-Cerzan refugees, Taese are listed in

10. Very generaliy, we can say that cur refugee in this area is
a youthful Pole who arrived in Gernazy ca. 1945. He is unemployed or
has a low-peying job, aid io living on the economy with little or no
chance of bettering his position here in Cornany. 3e probably has
family responsibilities.- ihe authorities do not pay auch attention
to hin, owing to the cegiitude of the increasing deraan refugee probles.
Navertheless he is in contact with representatives tither or both of tha
power blocs in Europe, each of which is attenpting to win his support.
He is not smited for espionage save in very low-level operations. On
the-other-hand, he most likely would enter such work only if promised
long tera solutions to his present problems,
