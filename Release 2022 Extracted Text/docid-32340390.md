A letter outlining the program was
forwarded New York by RAUL ANDRE by a trusted ud
cou ner. Gis letter was eventually made available C
to the Cuban Mission of the UN (CMUN, In the
communication forwarded to New York, ANDRE pointed
out that he and "PAQYUITO" decided to tell no one
about their plans. (af

The fact that ANDRE indicated that knowledge
of their plans should be limited to himself and the
subject and in addition that he preferred to
transmit the communication by a trusted courier rather
than use the United States mail service indicates the
safeguards utilized by ANDR id the subject to
protect their activities. 28 )(na\

certain individuals were listeg as targets, among ay,

BECHEL

The Miami Office is attempting to locate
LUIS POSADA, VARELO CASTRO, EVILIO ALPIZAR,
and MARIO ANTONIA GARCIA and question them concerning the
activities of the subject.

MM 105-8988

MM 1078-S is personally acquainted with
RAUL ANDRE. He has been instructed to intensify
his contacts with ANDRE and thereby become
acquainted with the subject. The problem in this
regard, however, is a conflict in working hours.
Both ANDRE and the subject work a day shift
whereas MM 1078-S works a swing shift. P(r)

Upon his return to the Miami area MM 1070-S*
will again be encouraged to continue,his association
with RAUL ANDRE and the subject. GE (QIU

In this regard on 1/22/67, MM 1070-S*
advised that he had a long conversation with ANDRE
and the latter advised that his group had been
inactive recently, mainly, because the entire local Cuban
section has quieted down considerably, #)H ) [WI

In addition vo i 3070-S%j and MM 1078-S,
other sources in the Cubah field have been alerted
concerning the subject. )

The Miami Office is contemplating complimenting
informant coverage with physical surveillances. The
investigation to date, however, indicates that the
subject operates within a small and close-knit group.

In such a situation, informants and physical surveillances
may not be sufficient to detect the activities of the :
subject.

In view of the above the Miami Office is
requesting Bureau authorization to contact the

Southern Bell Telephone and Telegraph Company to
obtain long-distance charges to his telephone.
