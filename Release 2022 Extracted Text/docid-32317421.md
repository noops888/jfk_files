‘The Las Vegas Office advised on 11/5/63 that at
approximately 9:30 p.m. on 11/2/63 Special Agents of that office
observed ROSELLE in the lounge of the Desert Inn Hotel sitting
at a table with MORRIS KLEINMAN and NICHOLAS DANALFO, aka "PEANUTS,"

ARNOLD HOFFMAN, PCI, advised that the records of the
Cogan-Rety Travel Bureau, Beverly Hills, California, reflect that
on 7/18/63 FRANK SINATRA arranged for transportation for about
25 persons via WAL from Los Angeles to Reno; that later SINATRA
transported 10 of these persons to Cal-Neva Lodge at Lake Tahoe
via his personally-owned plane and the remaining number traveled
via WAL. HOFFMAN had no record of the names of these persons.

It 18 recalled that ROSELLI and MAURICE H. FRIEDMAN
departed Los Angeles on the morning of 7/18/63 and allegedly
went to Cal-Neva Lodge at Lake Tahoe; however, the means of travel
has not been known.

The records of WAL reflect that 23 persons, identified
as "members of SINATRA party" were scheduled to travel from
Los Angéles to Reno on WAL Flight 408 which left Los Angeles at
9:00 a.m. Ten of these persons were shown as "no shows." Among
the remaining 13 were J. ROSELLI and an M. FRIEDMAN.

JACK WALTERS, PCI, advised on 11/7/63 that MAURICE H.
FRIEDMAN returned to the Beverly Crest Hotel from Las Vegas over
the past weekend. B. FRANK WILLIAMS, a part owner of the Hotel
Last Frontier.Corporation, also returned to the hotel. WALTERS
said that the current negotiations in which FRIEDMAN and WILLIAMS
are involved concerns the Holidays Inns who have their main
office in Memphis, Tennessée, and that FRIEDMAN and WILLIAMS
recently made a trip to Memphis . This transaction no doubt
pertains to previously mentioned plans of the Holiday Inns
to build a hotel or motel adjacent to the New Frontier Hotel in
Las Vegas.

On 11/8/63 the Los Angeles Police Department advised on
that date they conducted a surveillance of ROSELLI and he visited
the building of his accountant on West Third Street and then went
to the building where JAMES P, CANTILLON, an attorney, who has
been utilized by ROSELLI, has an office and then proceeded to the
Hillcrest Country Club. ‘The Los Angeles Police Department advised
during the day on an occasion when ROSELLI was away from his car,
the officers were "going through" ROSELLI's car and he caught them
at it and became very angry.
