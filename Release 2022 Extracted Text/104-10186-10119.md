indoctrination school). Source described PITA as havang been born
about 1941 in Cuba, being about ‘five feet eight inches tall, 130
pounds, having light eyes, medium-dark hair, a slim build, and white.
Source did not know his Communist Party status.

A fairly reliable source, from a report dated 16 February 1963,
stated that Felix PITA is the son of Felix PITA Rodriguez, author,
newspaperman, and possibly a, Communist. PITA was born about 1941.
‘PITA passed through Xexico City enroute to Latin America as a
Cultural Attache about April or May 1962. Source also stated that
PITA was rather cowardly’ and timid, that. he was afraid to leave the
embassy premises and would not go out on the streets alone. PITA
appeared to be an opportunist rather than a Communist or pro-Castro
and possibly obtained his job through his father's influence.

In a report dated 12 March 1963, Felix PITA was identified as a

Cuban intelligence officer under cover as the Cultural Attache in
the Cuban Embassy in Rio‘de Janeiro.
