wooden bunks, and sentry stations connected by telephone to the
Commandant’s car. These small new details are alarming, for they

indicate @ special kind of calculation, necessary only in the case

of permanent institutions.

The camps make the police an imposing social power within the
State, well defended master of monpower. Their central adminis-

pation, the Gulag, is one of the largest economic trusts of the

Contracts are prepored on the basis of the prevailing
wage retes, but since deportee lobor costs far less, the difference
is absorbed by the police “corporation.” Here again the inmate
of the concentration comp supports his guardian. The Nazi SS
reached this state only at the very last stages of its existence. -In

this sense the world of the concentration comp develops like a .

cancer within society, corupting the executioner along with the

victim.

ACALL TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE
We are'laced with an ifternational crime and we must

say 30 05 clearly as po: ble. Our allies in the struggle for f
freedom ‘are being sy:tematically exterminated. It is our

Out of the cacophony of the thousands of documented reports,
- the-“concentration camp man” emerges. He is nightmarishly
typical. He is hungry, sick and afraid. He lives in wooden bar.
tacks, or under a tent, or in earth caves. His fate is locked be.
tween barbed wire ‘barricades, beneath observation towers, Unde:
constant threat of dogs and rifles, he works far beyond’ the power
of his muscles. Given. neither the means nor time to wath, he wears
foulrags. He is awakened before dawn; at night, having returned
exhausted from work, he stands in an interminable line, near a hos.
pital lacking medicaments. ‘In the middle of the night, in every
kind of weather, he is aroused. by blows to unload freight cars. This
is a faithful condensation-of hundreds of reports—and thousands
-of such reperts exist,

The world of the concentration comp keeps growing. Yester
day the Soviet Union had only political. detention camps. The
crvel civil wer of the collectivization period started her on this en
terprise of forced labor. which plays its part in every economic see
tor, including scientific research. “The present network of camp:
spreads across Siberia to the White Sea and the Baltic, from th
very outskirts of Leningrad and Moscow to Baku.

During nearly their entire existence, the Nazi camps were bu
one apocalyptic aspect of @ general pathological pattern. Onl
during the last years did they become an integral part of a siciet
founded ona new type of human exploitation. In Russia this devel

is not threatened with extinction. It is in possession of all powe

THESE ARE THE FACTS;

Within the Soviet sphere, a system of concentration
camps exists, rivaling in extent and horror these of axl
Gurmany. President Truman has stated, on the

best au-

thority available te him, thot the Russians hold 16 million *:

hopeless human beings in these camps.

On the basis of thousands of documented reports from
erzapees from behind the Iron Curtain, the distinguished
French writer, David Rousset, 1 issued his ap; to human-
ity, reprinted in abridged form above, for. anvinvestigation:
into the Soviet concentration camp system, ue

Mr. Roustet's demand deserves the fullest atiention
of the American people. We of the fron C in Refugee
Campaign have therefore undertakén to make these facts
ckaown as a public service. We will not keep silent before
this monstrous international | crime, now driving thousands
of human beings, destitute, through the Iron Curtain. Nor

REFUGEE LEADERS PLEA

We, the undersigned representatives of the European peoples subjt
gated by Communist tyranny, urgently appecl-for support for the lror.
Curtain Refugoo Campaign of the International Rescue Committee in
its prosent emergency. wl .

The nature of the escapee's first contact with the Western world is
of the greatest importance. Ordinarily he reaches the free sida of the
Iron Curtain complotely with yt means and emotionally and physi-
cally exhausted from his harrowing ordoal. Although ho may bo kont
clive in over-crowded camps, all too frequently ho exporiencas avi
almost total personal indifférence that embitters even tha strongest
soul. Lo . are

It is hardly ‘possible to exaggerate the value of tho service which
the International Reseyo Committos has randored to those who have
succoodod in escaping from behind the Iron Curtain and to those who
havo sufferad und continue to suffer in the fight for froadom and
democracy. tae :

Tho promptnoss with which the International Roscue Committee
has coma to the assistance of those who have escaped, and the
warmth and understanding displayed by its representatives have
been a source of great spiritual encouragamont for tho: refugees in
Europe. It has demonstrated to them that on their way to freedom they
have not been abandoned to their fate. It has confirmed their faith in
democracy to the point where subsequent hardships could not destroy
it, It has proved to the world that-the tight of asylum is not a mere
formality devoid of human.content. It has helped to keop clive hopo
for tomorrow in the breasts of all peoples who aro today enslaved
by Communist tyranny,

It would be a catastrophe of tho first order if this vital work were to
come to an end for.lack of funds. The hardships of tho refugeas would”
be increased many fold: énd the Communist propagandists would
gloat over the fact in many editorials and radio broadcasts,

PROBABLY SECRET

The US| Governnont's interest in. tho regrettable situation in Iran
apooars to to about 99% Iumanitarian and only 2% intelligence.

: Since tho problem is primnrily Imanitarian, it would seom to fall
under a now State Dept unit which got USM.3 million of Hutusl Security

funds to bo spent in wolfare activities among refugees.
’ :

Although State is the agoncy af primary interest, I don't think we
need pass ‘this to State tecauso this is an official United Nettons matter,
and prosumably State alrendy has accogs to thie sart of thing through the US
delogation to the UN and through liaison with the ON Secretariat. I assune
that the new refugee unit in State will survey the plight of reSugees on the
Soviet perimeter, and in the course of this survey will obtain this info.
Anyray, 1t is not our Job to collect fron the UN and deliver to State.

I would suggest that thoso papers bo given by memo to 0S0, which

might not otlerwise cot them.

Also, you might ask 0SO to call to the attention of the Chief,
Defector Coordination Branch, EE Division (tiat's Gale W. Allen) tho paragraph
narked with a paperclip which suya tht Iran may Inve handod back to the USSR
35 Soviet aviators during 1951. If 35 Soviot fliers did shor up in Iran last
year, they were prine intelligence targets ani Gale ought to fini out why
they were turned brek when the US would hnve taken then off Iran's banda.
Gale nay be in this afternoon, oni I'12 tell hia you bnve this report.

MEMO)
on. the
Anti-Comunist Work of David Martin, snd the
International Rescue Committee \

ry
Christosher Exuet
Member of the Board of the IsR.C.

Two years ugo the International Rescue Comaittee started its

¢ maunder Adiircl Byrd, which has con-

tinued under the Chairminship of General Spaatz. This yecr, in

response to an increasing reed, the Committee launched an extended
program to raisé funds to set up reception centers for refugees along

the Iron Curtzin, to be knowh as Frontier Freedom Stations.. Thirty- !
two Governors are among the sponsors of this progzsm. C. D. Jackson

head of the Free Euroze Comittee, has hailed this project es a most
vitel end neglected phase of the fight against Comnmist aggression.

Mr. Jackson pointed out that one of the most successful subjects of
Soviet propaganda was the neglect of the anti-Communist refugees in i
the West, a neglect which makes a mockery of our professed sympathy 1

for the enslaved peoples. :

The Iron Curtain Campsiga is not only necessary to encourage and
make. the best use of the anti-Communist refugees, it is ulso the most
dransatic and persuasive kind of anti-Communist prop nda in Anerica
and throughout the Westera world by publicizing the personal stories
of those who risked thelr lives to choose freedom. Its work 1s hunani-
tarian and only indirectly political, out the political ¢ffect is all
the greater for that reason. i

Elinor Lipper, whose book "Eleven Years in Soviet Prison Camps"
is the most authentic document on Soviet slave labor, hes come to this
country to help raise funds for these Frontier Stations. However, be~
fore her arrival, evidence of a whispering campaign against the Inter-
national Rescue Committee became clearly apparent. Before the dinner
for Miss Lipper on October 3lst, which was addressed by General wede-
meyer, Governor John Lodge of Connecticut and Mrs. Hiram Cole Houghton,
Presideat of tne General Federation of Women's Clubs, all the speakers
were confidentially approached in efforts to dissuade them from co-
operating with the Comittee.

Most of the rumors and criticisms were based on the alleged nar-
row Socialist nature of the IAC policy and personnel. It was said
thet the Frontier Stetions would only help "Socialist" refugees. It
was even intivated by some who regard Communists and Socialists as
equally dangerous that the IRC wes or might. be a disguised Commmist
front.

It was also alleged thet David Martin, Executive Director of the
IRC, had once deen an active member of the American Communist Party
under the name of David Levine, and that he had sseretly changed his
name to Martin in order to cover his Communist past.

The facts are that David Martin, who was born end educated in
Canada, never had any connection with either the Canadian or the Amer-
ican Communist parties. He was a Socialist and active in the
Canadian labor movement in his youth, but he wes never a Communist
and he is a Socialist no longer.

* The origin of the attacks on Nirtin and the IRC have been traced
‘to Czarist white Russian sources, vith an Pini paner background, ‘who.
aFe affiliated with like minded grours in America. Most.of the at-
ticks have deen by word of mouth. The only Gocuaent ce have discovered
ig an anenynoils ettcck on the IRC which purports to be written by a
British Intelligence Officer. This attacks Eugene Lyons, head of the
Committee for the Liberation-of: the Peoples of Russia, end charges that
Lyons, Martin: and the’State Department are all-engaged in ‘a plot to
back Russian Sockalists to the e. on of all other enti-Communist °
refugees. The aosurdity of the ‘gS becomes apparent from the fact” +
that Eugene Lyons himself shares Mr. Hoover's economi¢. views and works
for the READER'S DIGEST. Willian Zenry Chemberlin,.a member of the
-Lyons coimittee, is a columnist for the WALL STREET JOURNAL and an
editer of the conservative nows letter, HUMAN EVENTS, ‘and. Iscac Don
Levine, a leading’ representative oF the Lyons committee .in Europe,
holds similar conservative economic views, as reflected in the edi-
torial policy of PLAIN TALK magesine of which he was founder and cditor.

‘ Nevertheless, absurd as the charges are, they have been highly
effective, decuuse they have been circulated by some people with im-
portant social and business connections amoung business men who know
nothing of the confused Russian refugee picture. When so many demands
are mide for funds in connection with anti-Comaunist and humanitarian
causes the mere element of doubt is surficient to prevent donztions,
and most people haventt the time or interest to make a detailed in-

vestigation.

Mr, Vadim Makaroff, a Russian Czarist refugee who is married to a
rich Americsn woman who is socially well connected» has been the most
pit he cost the Iron

Curtain Campsign $200,0; fforts with one group of fifty

after hearing Miss Lipper et = meeting of the Brook Club. Mr. Maka-
roffts political views and backgroy a can be judged by the fect that
he is a Director of Merwin K. Hart's organization.
The attscks have been very skillfully timed because General Spaatz

had reluctantly agreed to becone Chairmen (since he hates pudlic speak-
ing, etc.) 2 oniy consented to serve for one year'‘because of the ex-

Another reeson why the attack is damaging 1s that the Frontier

and the bitter disputes between Americs: sx
tion of so-called "McCarthyism", it is get Conser-
vatives -lixe Herbert Hoover to join Left-singers like Philip Murray in
any cause. Where the orgsnizution is even under suspicion of favoring
the Liberal side, it is‘sll the. harder to keep the necessary proper

proportion of Conservative sponsors. °

. fWo of the Conservative sponsors of the International Rescue Com=
ttee, former. President Hoover and Generil Wedemeyer, have been the
ovjects of speciul attention from those “iin this smear campaigns
Both of them résigned merely on the busis oF doubts because. their con=
fidence wes shaken, Both aré being urges ty Close friends to recon=
sider, and much .will depend on their sectsion,

If they do resign other Conservatives ¥ill probably go with then,
and it would mean thet it Ls now virtucliy inpossible to maintain
ualty in the anti-Communist ranks even for so urgent a cause. So if
this attack is successful in wrecking the Canpaign for the Frontier
Freedom Stations, it will prove to be one of the most tragic mistakes
among the many lost opportunities in the ficht sgainst Communism. Here
are the facts to meet it, fscts which-cen ensily.be verlfied and which

do not depend on my own memory alone.

I was the treasurer. Mr. Martin worked it for zbout seventeen hours
a dey for over three months. George Creek was chairman of the Commit-
tee. Bishop Manning, General.Donovan, Derdthy Thompson, Father Gannon,
then President of Fordham, and many other conservative as well as lib-
eral American leaders were active members of it.

they are still far from adequate. : .

Immediately after the close of the work of tiie Mihatlovich Commit-
tee, David Martin went to Englund, Germany and Itcly to investigate the
plight of the Yugoslav refugees from Tito, and of other anti-Communist
refugees. On his return he organised with me the Refugees’ Defense Com-
mittee, which fought. the battle of the anti-Corimunist refugees from be-
hind the Iron Curtain, dncluding the Russians who were being repatriated
ta°Russia under the Yelte Agreement. against their will, and who were
diserisinated against by UNRRA. Mr. Martin was the Secretary of the
American Committee and did practically all the work. We collaborated
closely with’the British Refugee Defense Committee, headed by Lord Halifax.

As the attached clippings show, our Committee eccomplished almost
the only really effcetive und widely publicized work in exposing the
Communist infiltretion and loitation of UNRRA in some countries.
Martin actually succeeded in reversing some of UNRRA's policies in re-
gard. to the repatriation of unti-Communist refugees behind the Iron
Curtain. To do this effectively required immense work, research and
documentatkon for which Duvid Martin was almost wholly responsible.

Mr. Martin also worked with the leaders of tne International
Peasént Union and helped to draft and publicize their appeal to the
UN to investigate Soviet persecution in their countries (in the Balkans
and Central Europe) on September 29, 1947. This appeal was carried on
the front pages of the New York newspapers and was widely reported
throughout the world. It set a precedent for other similar eppeals.

Martin also organized a Committee to ald the Baltic University-
in-Exile in Western Germany. This University wes then the sole agency
to preserve the culture of those small countries which were the victims

of Soviet aggression and. Genocide.

Record of the Internutionsl Rescue Comalttee

In 1948 David Mertin hegan to work professionally for the. Inter-
national Rescue Committee, waile continuing his volunteer work for the
Refugees! Defense Comaittee, He worked at first as Assistaat Director
of. the IRC under Shebe Strunsky, niece of the late Simon Strunsky, whose
witty and conservative column "Topics of the Times" appeared on the ed-
itorial pase of The New York Times. Later Martin becume its. Executive
Director efter Miss Strunsky accompanied ner husband to Europe. Martin
had used sll the proceeds from nis book and articles in his work for

the Refugees’: Defense Committee.

Although the. International Rescue Comnittee is < straight relief
and resettlement organization, not a political comaittee, it has been
almost the only Americen group to sid and resettle anti-Communist as
well as anti-Fescist refugees, regardless of religion or nationality.
As such, its work has not only rendered a great humanitarian service,
but, indirectly, it nas also rendered a great nolitical educztional ser-
vice to the anti-Communist cause, by publicizing the sufferings of the
victins of Soviet persecution and explzining why they sought to escape,
or refuses to return. Other great relief organizations, such as the
National Catholic Ker Relief Services, have reniered 2 Similar service,
but naturally neve largely concentrated on their own co-religiomists.

In 1946 the mitative of the international Rescue Con-
ittee, Francis Hcnson, was the first te expose the Communist fnflltra-
on in Unitaricn Service Comsittee in Europe under Noel Field, who
later became famous through the Hiss trial snd who disappearéd behind
the’Iron Curtain. Beéause of this anti-Communist work the IRC was wide-

Originally the International Rescue Comittee, which was founded

of the refugees from Hitler fell into this category. It was never a

days. One of tne men it rescued from Hitler was Franz Werfel, wnose
-book "The Song of Bernadette" was the direct result of his escape
through France. The Comalttee helped refugees from Frunce‘also, but
unlike most of the Spanish Refugee orgenisctions, it wou not run by or

David Martin hus worked. closely with iea of the Catholic Church

in all his work for anti-Comaunist refurees s. the War, particularly
with the editors of AMZKLCA, the Nationsl Jesuit weeily. AMERICA has
puodlished articies of his. He took part in the protest a-
gainst the trials of Archbishop Stepinse snd Cardinal Mindszenty. Al-
though his -book on Mihailovich und Tito was written from the pro-Serbian
point of view, he showed his fuirness by his reference to Archbishop
Stepinac, who was unfairly atteeked by many of the followers of General
Mihailovich because of the feud between the Serbs and the Croats.

To sum up ~ the facts about Martin are that he was never 9 Com-
munist, although he was 2 militant Socislist in his youthful college
days. He has deen an active anti-Commmist since 1939, when he was
twenty-five years old, do has done u é@ and pioneering enti-Comunist
work at a time when it wis highly unpopular to do so, both In the case
of Mihailovich and in the case of his controversies with UNRRA and with
the British Government, over the repatriation of. anti-Communist refu-
gees, Ho has veen one or the most creative, courzgeous and tireless
workers in the fight for freedom against Communist tyranny.

The Iron Curtain Refugee Campaign and the Frontier Freedom Stations
project’ were Martin's ideas. He is one of the very few men with ex-
perience in large s e relief work with a wide political beckground
in the jungle of difrerent parties end countrics of Exstern Europe. In
his present ctosition he would be virtually irrepliceabl If-it is pos-
sible to destroy a man end an organization with such a record of anti-
Communist service s ly because at time he was a democratic So-
eclalist, then nobody's reputetion would be safe and no united anti-Con-
munist action would be possible. Yet it is essential that one over-all

There are four things which vould eure the present crisis:

(1)° A decision by Mr. Hoover to remain on the Committee and to
give a letter stressing {ts importance, which could be used in anew

(2) ‘An agreement by Generel Spaatz-to remain temporarily as

gave to the Committee for a Free curope. Some direct Government funds

Liki - Fests

Tish to acknowledge your litter of 21 Auguet 1952, in which you
set forth the interest of the Harvard Univercity Library in ceeuring cer-
tain docusexts or microfiins thereof of inéividual displaced persons or
refigees.vho have been of concern to the Interrstional Refugee Orgoniza-
tion. I usderstand fully your interest in recuring theee documents, and
vhile I vould 1ik> to comply vith your request I do not think it will be
possible to do so for rearous which I will cet farth telow.

Bie fhe quection of decumentatioa of individval refugees end of ac~
cess to suck documents has *een a natter of conzideradle controversy ever
since 1985, first in UNRRA and later in the IRO. As & result of baric dif-
ferences in political views concerning the handling of displaced persons
and refugees it has been necessary to safeguard ali individual dossiers
with the greatest of cere. These dossiers contain not only facts about the
Aindividus! refugee and hie immediate family, out also about nis relatives,
many of vhon are not displaced persons and ere ctill in their countries of
origin, As a matter of fect, the Organization ted a great deal of diffi-
culty {2 securing the cooperation of individual ¢!rplaced persons in coa-
pleting ou: Registration Forns, because of the fear that there refugees hed
that such data aight fall into the hands of individuals, institutions or
goverments which might take jusitive action ageicet relatives of displaced
persozs. refusing to return to their country of origin.’ The TRO assured ell
ispleced persons that their personal records axi documents would be safe-
guarded to as crest an extent as poseible and vould be made available to
governments only for the purpose of directly assieting in securing the re-
settlement acroad of the i:dividual concerned. We nave attempted in every
way to follow this policy consistently.

As ve approach the end of IRO operations, ve ere making plaze for
the disposal of the individual case records either by giving then to govern=
wents {n the countries of reception, or ~y dectrzction of the recoris. or
vhere the refugees are still in Germany or Austria, by turcing the docusents
over to the United Rations iiich Commissioner for Refugees. I regret there-
fore thet iu view of the security factors involved, it will not be possible
to asree to your proposal that certain oy these individual records te mode
availa>le to you for purpores of nistorical research.

I wigitedd, if you vill permit an expression of opision on the

Through the Curtain

Despite the apparent -Impenetra-
bility of the fron curtain between
East and West, refugees from Red
tyranny continue to make their way
into {ree territory ata rate of 500
to 1500 a week.

They bring with them not only
vital intelligence of what goes on in
the Red-dominated sectors.of Europe,
but in many cases real talents and
abilities which can be used to help our.
cause. They also bring hope. They
are Hving reminders that ordinary,
decent people .are not easily sold on
the fraud of Marxism, Russian-style,
and that democracy still attracts free
minded men if they have any kind of
a choice.

Unfortunately, these Iron curtain
refugees are not getting a very warm
reception on our side now: They land
with a horde of other displaced per-
sons, but they are not technically qua-
lified to tecelve D.P. aid. Neither is
the International: Refugee Organiza:
tion equipped to handle their prob!ems,
And unless some-.answer to their

EDITORIAL

needs is found s6on, they will be com-
pelled to believe Russian propaganda,
that western freedom Is “{reedom to
starve.”

It Is to be hoped that some official
program will eventually be evolved to
ald them In finding @ permanent new
place, Their talents, like those of the
other D.P.'s, can certainly be used in
the mobilization period ahead,

ding such arrangements, howe

Vever, It is vital that their minimum re.

quitements be met through private
charity. General Carl Spantz has just

that, with the screening given by the govera-

Hence we bave here a campaign which ought

OME American intelligence officers
are said to have reported recently
that large numbers of Russion natural
scientists, technicians and intellectuals
would quit the Soviet countries und
come to live in the democracies if they
could be certain’of remunerative em-
ployment,

‘These peoples, with their knowledge
and special skills, have.a high poten-
Gal value. which the nations of the
‘West could exploit to advantage. Some
of these persons who want.to get out
ct Russia, for example, are said to
Include a noted Russian nuclear physi-
cist, a prominent oil geologist und
engineers, scholars, economists. But
these pecple do not know whether,
being destitute, they could find the
means of survival. And Communist

“propaganda frightens them" by its in-
surtence that political freedom in the
‘United States and other Western coun-

tries means “freedom to starve.*

But there is an. organization which
is doing something about this, It is the
Iron Curtain Refugee Campaign of the
FRetatat Messe Cometic Ines
of New York. This voluntary aget
headed by General Carl Spaatz, fore
met Chief of Staff of the United States
Air Force. It is supported by voluntary
contributions, and is helping retlable
tefugees froin Iron Curtain lands to
become established in free countries
where they inay support themselves
and in the meantime contribute to the
defense of the free world against the

‘encouragement, Its effective function~
ing, in addition to ite other values,
serves as effective counterpropaganda
against the Communist charge that
Western freedom is merely the “free
dom to starve.”

Tus is 0 report to'the American people, IJt.is olsy a call to every

means by which we can give #id tothousands of arving victime of Soviet

BERLIN (Western Sector):

In response to the Communist threat to take over Berlin
by means of a Soviet Whitsuntide youth invasion last May, the
Iron Curtain Refuges Campaign launched “Project Berlin.”
Replying to a spacial sppeal, individual Ameri ind Amarican
business enterprises contributed enough to pe the shipment
of almost 4,090;000 Ibs. of butter, cheese, milk and egg powder,
children's canned food, and:<lothing. This aid and the continuing
sarvicas of all kinds are administered by our Berlin office in the
clesest cooperation with Gencral Maxwell Taytor, U. S$. Com.
mander in Berlin, and Ernst Reuter, Mayor of Western Berlin.

Since there are no camps of any kind inthe Paris area, the 60,000
refugees there ara among the moat de: te in Europe, Hun-
dreds of these escapees come to the IRC’s Iron Curtain Refugee
Campaign office every reception morning to ask for food parcels
or clothing or advice. On the busiest morning this year, 500 food
parcels were givan out. Very frequently oseapees are aided in
eotablishing themselves in smell businesses or in their own pro-
fossion in France, of In, arranging for their migration to other
countries where they can make ao fresh start in- life.

To assist in the work of tha Paris office, o Committee of
American ladies has been set up under the patronage of Mrs,
David Bruce, wife of the American Ambassador to France.
The Committee is at present endeavoring to estal a hostel

that will provide emergency shelter for new escapees arriving in
the Paris area,

The International Rescue Committec alto maintains offices
in STOCKHOLM, BRUSSELS, ROME AND LONDON, where the
sama humanitarian services are made available te Iron Curtain
refugees.

THIS VITAL WORK OF AID MUST GO ON. So long as Soviet
Aerror enstinues, thousands will eontinue to risk all in their dee
perate flight to freedom. Millions are being expended by the U. S.
Government and individual Americans to counteract the big Ne of
Soviet propaganda with the. trvth of freedom, But truth is more
than words, Undernourishment, tack of decent clothing and shelter,
the lack of concrete evidence of Western support and approval,
could make these human beings vulnerable to the continuous
stream of Soviet propaganda that political freedom in the West
means “freedom to starve." Prattlings about freedom mean little

May, and an additional five thousand individual food packages
weighing 75,000 Ibs, were given-out.

For the majority of these human beings thé help received

But heyond this, our help to these men and women throu
the Iron Curtain Refuge Campaign is more than simple hums

of the Tashkent area of the USSR, now reported to be the provi
ground for Soviet atomic experimenta;‘an Arctle oll geologiat w
has surveyed areas now believed to be the sites of seeret Sovict

with us in the defense of freedom.
