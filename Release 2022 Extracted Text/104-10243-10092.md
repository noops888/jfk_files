MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD Mi Fa

SUBJECT: Relations with Manolo RAY and the LiRP

1, For hackground see my memorandum of ld May !961, reporting on
my long session with Manolo RAY, Rogelio CISNEROS (Eugenio) and Ernesto
BETANCOURT. As will be noted in that memorandum, ‘ano! promised to
come up wits a prospectus within approximately ten days! time, alter-con- |
sulting with hie leaders in Cuba.

2. On} Jone 1961 Mr. Barnes called me to say that Sr. Goodwin had
been visited by Mr. Ernesto BETANCOURT who asked for immediate iinanclal - *
support for certain activities of the MAP which would run arounc Sti. Ld
dollars. sir. Barnes asked me to contact BETANCOURT for the pur; ose of
ascertaining what the {unde were to be used for, exactly how much needed, ete.
I called BETANCOURI and he wld me that I should get these details from
CISNEROS (Eugenio), who was staying at room 549 at the washington Hotel. wy
Icailed Eugenio and niade & daia for ais and Ray Dubois (Ray Adams is the
meme he uses with Rey and Cisneros) to call upon him. ‘Ve called on CISNEROS
at approximately 1835 boure I Juno, and be informed: us that he had urgent
meod for pesos for use in support of his saboisge and underground activities :
fin Cuba. He said his people were absoluicly without funds, needed money for ©
living expenses, transportation, parchare of sa!

couriers, and for assisting peogle co get out of srisoa, He said that it was 5 i
Rew possible for people to buy their way out of prison by bribing ane ofthe -

3. We made no commitment to Fugento other than to eay that we would i t
pase his plea along to the interested people, 1 reminded him that we had aeked | i
him and Manolo to pregare a plan for consideration and that we were still

waiting for that plan, 1 said I personally doubted that anything could be dene |
wntil the plan was received from RAY. He-said Manolo was planning to. come to:
Washington on the afternoon of 2 June with the plan, but chat he himself was
having to retura to Miami immediately and it was vital he be able totakethe
money with him, arrange in Aifami for purchase of the pesos (at rate of tale {

money slready in Cuba - dollars would be delivered to owners of the pesos who :
ere in Miami). I told him I would call him in the morning to let him know how

things stood.

4. Idiecusced our meeting with CISNEROS with Tracy Barnes on the
morning of 2 June. It was Tracy's opinion, in which I heartily concur, that
we should put ‘out no money whatsoever until ze have had a: chance to examine
Manolo's plan and to study just what resercussions or ran:ifications there
would be, policy-wise and otherwise, toa decision to assist the MRP
enilaterally; that is, owside the Council and presumably without MIRO's F
knowledge or consent. Since RAY has withdrawn his grous from the Council i
with a grea: deal of fanfare, it is most unlikely that MIRO would look xindly cates
: On any assistence to RAY, especially since he fecls be has a rather firm :
promise from the President to deal only through MIRO. 7

5. RAY, upon arrivel in Washington, will presumably take his plan (along
with BETANCOURT) directly to sir, Goodwin and I would also preeume that
Goodwin will pase It down to Tracy and Tvacy tous. Ray DuBoie, wio hae
been Manolo's case officer, is standing by in the event he should be needed.

6. personally feel very strongly thet we should do ndthing to euszort the ~~

plan, whatever it is, until we have received from the White House and the
Departmeat clear-cut, unequivocal policy guidance on the overall plan. [also : |
feel that now is the time, if'we are going to eupport the MRP unilaterally, to :
insert a non-official cut out into the operation. I would recommend that con-
H olderation Le given to using Mr. harry Pieper. (a #AVE contract employee) i
fie oa ihis job, Harzy is ismpermeaiaiiy oviied, has a good business head, is ’
: fluent In Spanioh (lived ¢8 years in Cuba), is cleared, follows directions, H
completely bonest and tremendously conscientious.. It would be harder to
{ find a better person.

7. Also, 1 would like to point out the security riske inherent in any arrange-

mente with the RAY-BETANCOURT-CISNEROS trio. These fellows have had

ezsy access to the White House and to the Departcent, are notorious for their | t
: “planned leaks”, will probably presume all the Department officials they deal :
with are privy to the arrangement, and before we know it the whole exile i
community will be well aware that we are providing financial and material :
Support to the RAY group. [am not arguing against providing such support,
‘but am merely pointing out the real potential for embarrassment to us if the
matter is not handled with the greatest of precautions. 1 feel they have become © i
too closely identified with U, S, -officiaidom, Including tuyself, and that the Hy i
Plausible denial aspects, to dase at ieast, are almost non-ealetent, . i f
