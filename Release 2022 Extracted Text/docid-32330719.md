KEN FLANERY

who reportedly "set up" the recent

attempted

hijacking of the Canadian Country

Club is a close

friend of Informant.

Informant has heard similar rumors about

FLANERY and although he considers him capable of such an

act, he does not believe FLANERY would become involved in any

hijacking inasmuch as FLANERY has "too much to lose" in

connection with the building and construction business.

Informant recalled that FLANERY's name had also been mentioned

in connection with the hijacking of the Pennsylvania Club in

• 1963

when it was being operated by GEORGE BARNeS.

Informant said

BARNES had talked to FLANERY at that time and had elimirated

him as a suspect.

Informant stated he too has been accused of having

a part in the attempted hijacking of the Canadian Country Club,

possibly because he is a former employee and is presently

"somewhat at odds" with FLETCHER HANDLEY

owner of the Canadian

Country Club.

Informant talked to GEORGE BARNES and JUNK

JOHNSTON the

previous week and is certain he convinced them

that he had no part in the attempted hijacking.

(BARNES and

JOHNSTON operate the gambling room at the Canadian Country

Club.)

Informant said that BARNES uses R. D. MATHEWS, a

Dallas, Texas, hoodlum, as a

strong-arm man, but that to

Informant's knowledge, MATHEWS has not been in Oklahoma City

recently.

FUSSELL DOUGLASXMATTHEWS

On 1/26 and

28/ 65,

PCT PATRICK HENRY EARLEY advised

SA GEORGE B. STEWART that R. D.XMATTHEWS, a gambling house

considered as a hired gun and collector of gambling debts but

he does not know the specific reason for BARNES bringing

MATTHEWS to Oklahoma City.

The informant described MATTHEWS

as a hoodlum who is very dangerous.

He described MATTHEWS

as approximately 50, sandy hair, medium build, 5'10"

85 pounds, with only one eye.

The informant

did not have

any description of the car in possession ofMATTHEWS.

The informant stated that BILL RAWLS (former Agent)

Is a close associate of GEORGE BARNES and possibly does

private investigative work for him.

He said RAWLS also

associates closely with ROBERT EDWARD JOHNSON who is a pimp

and a "stup" man. The informant explained that JOHNSON

hangs out in the

Central Club pool hall in Oklahoma City and

is a professional gambler. He said that in addition JOHNSON
