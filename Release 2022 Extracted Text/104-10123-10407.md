From early December 1965 through May 1966, Messrs. James W. McCord,
Jr., Alan F. Petit, and William HM. Marcy, of the Technical Division,
Office of Security, spent many off-duty hours in experimentation with
various items of equipment in an effort to improve and strengthen the .
Agency's Audio-C “termeasures Program.z'They conceived and developed ~
a unique techr’, in( which is considered to be
a major breakthruugh @ detection of clandestine microphones and
other devices targeted against the Agency. It gives the Agency for 24

st time the capability to,

a capability for which thé’ intelligence community has expended
largé’ sums of money to develop in a variety of approaches. This tech-
nique will not only benefit the security of ell Agency installations
at home and abroad, but will be of utmost benefit to other agencies
in the community. This technique was met with wide acclaim by the
intelligence community and the Technical Security Countermeasures
Committee. 2y

In experimenting with thell
Focus these men showed this combination had distinct advantages in
terms time and effort over the considerably more expensive 2y

In further refinement of this technique, they
designed an innovation in the forn ora \which has

the distinct advantage of flexibility ovér ie j24
currently available on the commercial market. ~

fo further enhance the use of this equipment, these

cloped an inconspicuous, easily transportable package,

ing of two attache cases which hold thi y
jeauipment, wall racks, and motor units. Ss makes

poss e for an audio-countermeasures team to enter offices,

residences, and safehouses without undue attention.

fs

These men have shown great ingenuity and resourcefulness
in the application and development of this audio-countermeasure
technique. Through their further efforts in package design they
contributed significantly to the future clandestine use of this
technigque-on a world-wide basis. This technique provides the
Agency for the first time a procedure through which large in-
terior wall surfaces, room furnishings, and objects can be
idly scanned in "real time" in the search for hostile tech-
nical penetrations. This capability will significantly enhance
the security of all Agency installations.
