ORGANIZED GANGS

The Mannerino Gang, which 1s made up

GABRIEL MANNARINO, WILLIE SAMS, JO-Ve

ANNARTNO, ROMANIAS,

is, without a

doubt,

the most powerful organ-

Ized gang in Western Pennsylvania and West Virginia. Since

the submission of the last report, the activitles of this

gang have been curtailed considerably in Western Pennsylvania

because of the Speelal Pennsylvania Grand Jury in Pittsburgh

and because of the pressure exerted on it by "Operation

Crusade," a crusade being sponsored by the ministers of

Westmoreland and Fayette Counties. As mentioned in the

ast report, the gang's front man,

CHARLES F. "Chuck"

EMER, was attempting to purchase a small island off the

coast of Florida, near Fort Plerce, which, according to

Intormants and sources of information here, was to be usea

as a spot for a gambling casino.

PHLI

ETRULLI, operator of the City Radio Service in

Mokeesport, Pa., and a potential criminal informant of this.

office, has advised that MANNARINO actually purchased this

island off the coast of Florida; however, that because of

pressure caused by the presence

of the Kefauver Committee

in tampa, Florida, Florida politicians would not permit the

opening of a gambling casino on the island.

When the MANNARINOS

determined that they could not open, they allegedly sold the

island to the United States Government at a price far in

excess of that which they originally pald.

It should be

noted that the infornation furnished by PETRULLI has not been

corcoborated by any other source; however, it 1s definitely

known that CHUCK TEEMER was in Fort Pierce attempting to

line up the purchase of the island for a company known as the.

company may have had

some connection with hoodlums in New

York and Chicago, one of which was at one time a member of

Murder, Incorporated.

PETRULLL, who 1s a numbers baron in Mokeesport, stated in

March, 1951, that the MANNARINOS had recently opened a

gambling casino in Havana, Cuba; that CHUCK TEEVER was to

be the front man for this casino; and that several "syndicate

boys" from Chicago were also Involved, It was subsequently

AS1O GONZALEZ, reported to be a close Erlend of ANTONIC

RIO;

brother of Cuban President CARLOSYBRIe, and EUPEMIC

PERNADEZ, who was at one time Chief of the Cuban Secret

Pollee and a very close friend of President PRIO.

In view of the information developed in Havana to the effect

that both BUFONE and

TEEMER were actually working In the

casino, It's apparent that the information furnished by

Fulnult. was correct.

It should be noted that NORMA O'BRIEN and JAMES GARROW,

Informants of this office, have also furnished informati n

concerning this gambling establishment in Havana.

Recently, Information has come to the attention of his

office from GARROW and PETRULLI to the effect that CHUCK

TEEMER has been squeezed out of the operation in Havana,

He

has allegedly been taken by the MANNARINOS for approximately

$160,000 and also has been threatened by them to say nothing

about its operation.

GARROW has advised that he understands

money has also been invested in the casino by one LEO MOCERI,

who is the subject of Bureau File 25-140592 and who is
