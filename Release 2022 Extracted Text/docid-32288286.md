SUBJECT: GUS~ALEX, aka ak
AR iS

Re Bureau airtel 2/1/61 instructing that the Chicago
Office immediately institute a review of information in
Chicago files pertaining to ALEX to determine whether there
is any possibility of a prosecution in the immediate future.

(1) ALEX is not presently the subject of a sub-
stantive case. No local, state or federal process is currently
outstanding against him.

(2). A review of all information available to this
office has established only one possibility wherein ALEX
may be vulnerable to w @ prosecution within the investi-
gative jurisdiction of the Bureau. In this regard it is
believed that considerable investigation is necessary to
develop this possibility but that if this information can eg

obtained, A ay be successfully prosecuted. It is noted.
that PCI BE IBELING has advised that ALEX is an owner of 42”
the Nationa. aintenancé Corporation in Chicago. PCI stated
that ALEX es not appear as an owner on any of the records
of the company and that one BEN STEIN is used by ALEX as a
front in the operation of this company. PCI stated that this +
company furnishes maintenance help to several large accounts | f
in Chicago such as the Merchandise Mart and McCormick Place, ‘/ /

Chicago's large exposition hall. PCI stated that this company
recruits its help among the derelicts on Skid Row in Chicago
and that although it receives $17 or $18 per day for each
employee, only $6.50 is given to the employee. PCI advised
that the company has an arrangement with TOM BURKE, an official
of the Janitors Union in Chicago, whereby BURKE receives
$2,000 per month from the company in return for assistance

in keeping the. employees of the company ununionized and in
obtaining business accounts for the company. This gives the
company the obvious advantage of not having to pay union wages
or funds into the union welfare fund for each employee, It

is expected that additional investigation regarding this
situation is necessary in order to establish some connection
with interstate commerce and to develop information concerning
the hidden ownership of ALEX in this company, but it is believed
that it is a situation which merits further investigation in
line with the objectives set out in refe d Bureau airtel.

information that ALEX is the owner of the S. D. Kaplan Garage
Corporation at 60 East Randolph, using KAPLAN as a front in
this operation and that ALEX also is a owner of two large BFK Law 11(2)
Chicago hotels, the Eastgate and the St. Clair, although his

name does not appear on records of these hotels. It is

believed that if this information can be proved, that ALEX is
susceptible to prosecution for an evasion of income taxes.
