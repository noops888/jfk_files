FOR AMBASSADOR FROM KOMER

Mrs. Kennedy had ortginally expected to put out news quiatly
hero that ehe had politely declined King's offer of house in Marrakech.

While still anxious that thie be put on public record, she now
prefers that it be done from Morocesn end. So hope you can suggest
it come from Moroccans themselves. If this ean't be arranged, we'd
appreciate it if you could background peousl in low key yourself.
Mrs, Kennedy asks that we exprees her apologies about putting you te
all this bother.

Theme of any release might be simply that Mro. Keanedy most

grateful for King's gift. She has written King personally expressing this

but regretfully declining for personal reasons, particularly that educating
and raising her children in US will leave her all too littie time make

proper use of such a house in Marrakech.
