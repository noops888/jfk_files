Attention: Mr. Robert L. Keuch

Deputy Assistant Attorney General

Criminal Division, Room 2113

Dear Mr. Attorney General:

4331435

• By a letter dated April 12, 1978, the Committee requested

that staff be provided access to the "informant files of all

informants within the Invaders during 1968 ...".

It is now requested that the Memphis Field Office files

for these same informants be prepared for access by the staff.

While the committee feels that the procedure by which f

li !

was permitted access to the first set of files was unacceptable'/

and contrary to the Memorandum of Understanding, pending future

discussions to arrange to broaden access, this procedure may

again be utilized.

It is my understanding that these files will be sanitized

only to the

extent necessary to protect the identity of the

informants.

Again, the Committee resetvlitthe right to request the

production of the identity of the informants involved if such

Is deemed necessary to complete our.

As time is extremely cruc PFf Investigation.

62-117240768

I in this matter, your prompt

attention in seeing that these files are prepared

on a priority

basis

is greatly appreciated.

The aforementioned letters were writted on half sheets of

Mr. KLINGEMAN advised that to the best of his

recollection at this time, the last check, Number 5357, was

mailed to RAys brother, name unrecalled, in Northbrook,

Illinois, at RAY's request since he left his employment

prior to receipt of the check, stating that he was going to

work on boats with his brother. As Mr. KLINGEMAN secalls,

he received a letter from RAY requesting that the pay due be

sent to his brother.

NW 68262 Docld:32989732 Page 54

## Page 55

CG 44-1114

Both of the KLINGEMANs characterized JAMES EARL

RaY as an excelient employee, quiet, attentive, prompt,

polite, a very good worker, but to their knowledge,

had no Iriends or visitors

during the time of his

employment.

They did recall that during the subject's

Last week of employment, he received three of four phone

calls from a male individual who sted that he was RAY's brother.

They could not recall the individual's name, nor did they

believe that they would recognize this person's voice if they

heard it again.

In conversation with Mr. HUIE, the KLINGEMANS

received the following information on a

confidential basis and

advised that they were rather reluctant to divulge it,

but felt that it was their duty as citizens.

They requested

that this information bemintained on a confidential basis within

the FBI. They advised that they contacted Chief DERNING

because of his reputation and are now following his advice in

furnishing this information to the FBI:

Mx. HUIE sowed the KLINGEMANs letters from RAY in

which RAY listed

employment at the Indian Trail Restaurant.

CIt should be noted that this restaurant is an old, large,

upper class restaurant, of excellent reputation.

Chief

DERNING advised that the KLINGEMANs themselves have an

excellent reputation within the community and that he holds

them in very high regard).

HUIE told them that RAY had

served seven years of a twenty-year sentence at Jefferson,

Missouri, prison, during which time he had eight visitors,

one of whom was his brother, however, HUIE did not identify

which one. Prior to his escape, RAY had stashed away

a razor, green prison trousers which had been dyed black, and

iy a back, and

Iz hersey bars in anticipation that he would have to go

without food for some time.

also had $300 in his shoe.

he escaped in aced truck and walked to Chicago, Illinois,

crom Jelterson City, Missouri, which took him about eight

days.

The KLINGEMANs do recall that when the subject first

appered at the restaurant, his feet were swollen and that

their sister-in-law gave hin two Ace bandages to use which he

returned three or tour days later. This supposedly was

mentioned in the letter in HUIl's possession.

Thereafter, RAY read the advertisement in the

Tribune wherein the KLINGEMANs had advertised for help in the

restaurant.

HUlE said that the subject in the letter

NW 68262 Docld:32989732 Page 55

---

## Page 56

. C6 44-1114

mentioned that the employment at the Indian Trail Restaurant

was the "high point of his life"

HUIE mentioned that RAY had had only three jobs

in his life, one of which was in a shoe factory outside of

East St. Louis, Illincis, which is prior to his going to

prison the last time.

He also said that during the time RAY

was employed at the restaurant, he was "tapped on the shoulder''

by an individual who recognized him and who threatened to

reveal his identity to the police and cause RAY's return to

Prison if he, RAY, did not work for this person.

HUIE said

that RAY was given $1,200 during the initial contacts, by the

alieged conspirators, and was ultimately paid $15,000, but

was due to receive more.

Again, according to HUIE, RAY was told to go to

Canada to investigate the difficulty of crossing the border.

Supposedly RAY made two trips through the Detroit Tunnel into

Canada. He also made a

sequence not given, and "was instructed' to obtain a 40-year-

old newspaper, get

the names of the males born that de,

and search the current phone directory for similar names.

He was then to surveil the individuals with similar names to

determine whether or not his physical description was

similar to theirs.

Thereafter, he telephoned persons of his

like description,

utilizing a pretext, and thereby found a manr

who had never applied for a passport. RAY then applied for a

passport in this name.

The KLINGEMANs advised that they were not sure that

they were turnishing this intormation in its proper

sequence, but that to the best of their recollection, the

intormation preceding and following was given to them in this

order by HUII.

thereaiter, rat was given more money to

purchase a Mustang which was to be driven to Acapue o, Mexico,

for the pirpose of obtaining

a tourist sticker.

drove through Mexico to the West Coast and hid out there to

receive further instructions from the other individuals in

the alleged conspiracy.

HUlE stated that RAY was flown to

Atlanta from the West Coast, but the time was not right, there

was no action andhe was sent back to California.

He was also

told to be in Mississippi at a certain time and place.

Supposedly Reverend MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR. was at a- Holiday

Inn Motel in Atlanta, Georgia, when RAY was flown there.

NW 68262 Doeld:32989732 Page 56

## Page 57

CG 44-1114

Subsequently, RAY was given money to obtain binoculars

and a shotgun and was to go to Memphis to be somewhere at

Bo0 32 05 23 tphi his 90o and here othere

Negro male who purportedly called KING out to the balcony.

According to HUIE, the actual murderer of KING was not RAY,

although RAY was present and at a later time (probably the trial)

RaY will identify the murderer. RAY did pick up the rifle, ran

to his car, and sped to a rendezvous in Atlanta, Georgia.

He was supposed to pick up a "bundle of money"

conspirators did not appear. RAY allegedly spent several days

or hours at this apartment in Atlanta, Georgia, awaiting the

arrival of his "fellow conspirators".

According to HUIE, the plan was for RAY to go to

Mexico, but immediately fly north to throw off pursuit and

to steer all investigation to Mexico. However,

the conspirators did not appear in Atlanta, RAY fled to Carda

thereafter utilizing his knowledge to obtain a passport and

fled to England.

The KLINGEMANs advised that the rest of HUIE's story

substantially follows the newspaper accounts which appeared

after subject RAY's arrest in England. They did note that

HulE stated that RAY did rob a bank in London because he

"got real low on money".

Hulk at no time identified the

alleged fellow conspirators of RAY. He did swear the KLINGEMANS

to secrecy and told then that he would mail the "Look"

te interviewing Agents for review.

The KLINGEMANs advised that RAY began working for

them as a dishwasher and because of his excellent attitude

was advanced to cook's helper. During the time he was in

their employ, they did not observe him in a car, nor did they

know him to own an automobile. He had no visitors, he did

mobiles we

not wear glasses, he had no women friends, nor did he make

restaurang and they noted that his hair was

"less bushy" during

photographs.

They are not sure how he came to work from his

apartment, but believe hemight have been met at the Eden's

Expressway by WILLIE PERRY and FRED BURNS, who were also

employees at the restaurant.

when RAY received the phone calls during his last week of

employment he seened to be disturbed

and that his

concentration on his work was not as good as it usually was..

They then recalled that according to HUIE, that when

JAMES HARL RAY leit England, he was going to Lisbon to get to

They again stated that the information furnished to them by

HUTE came from letters which RAY had written to his attorney, who

in turn turned them over to the author. Also Mr. KLINGEMAN

stated that in one of the letters which he believed was to

the attorney from RAY, while he was in London, England, there

was a drawing identifying a location which appeared to be

Diversey Street and Sheffield Avenue in Chicago, Illinois.

At the conclusion of the interview, the Klingemans

again requested that this information be maintained in
