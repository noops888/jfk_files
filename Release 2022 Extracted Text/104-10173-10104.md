1, met Nick at hig @artnont from 2050 to 2200 in

order to debrief him on the fishing weekend of 3-5 June.

“oO NAek reported that when he and his Mexican friend |

‘arrived at Pucuato at 1845 on- Friday, 3 June, YATSKOV and .-

two other Soviots were already there fishing in front of the
cabins, They had come in ISAYEV's VW. Shortly thereafter
the Soviets came to the cabins and Nick greoted YATSKOV and

introduced his Mexican friend to him. YATSKOV did not introduce ~

the other two. Soviets by name but they all did shake hands,
Nick invited them all into his room but only YATSKOV came;

He accepted a drink snd. left with it, Later outside Nick
asked: one of. tho: new Soviots ‘his name ‘and. got the answor, Ef

+ .“Wasilio,”” The-othér one ‘then used an English. word and Nick.
‘-asked. if ‘he spoke English. This. Soviet said his namo was

Viktor and that he spoké a. little English. Nick then asked
YATSKOV which of tho other. two was the newly arrived Soviet.
YATSKOV'said that it was Viktor, Nick then’ lent them his
extra lentern and that ended things for the night.

3. The next ‘day both: groups . fished. Separately at.
‘Sabanita. About noon: YATSKOV came by and- noticed that ‘Nick

4. Although all the Soviets were ploasant and-correct
there was absolutely no socializing or extended conversation.
They did not accept Nick's invitations to come. in for a
drink, except for the above noted occasions when they accepted
° a drink and left taking it with them, .

5S. "VaKtor:". Nick described hia. as. an older man, 36

‘to 42, medium height, 82-85 hilos, heavy but net fat build,

- roundish, boyish face, looked like. an American in general -
appearance. - Does not speak ‘Spanish, Said he spoke a little
English.. However, their conversation was so limited that Nick
_couldn't determine his fluency. He obviously understood
everything that Nick said but his answers’ and comments were

' short and simple. As noted’ above, YATSKOV said that he is
‘the newly arrived Soviet. He did not do any fishing himself
but simply watctied- YATSKOV and the othor Sovict.-

6, I showed Nick a.picture of BOYAROV, .Nick couldn't
positively identify it. .Our picture has sunglasses, During
‘day Viktor had on a white towel protecting his“neck and

2. Subject started things out by saying that (Locr%o

Subject told him he had found a house on Juanacatlan,
LOGINCV said that he's looking for onc on the Chapultapec Park
and’ for, Subject to keep looking, Then
¥.daid that he vould like to rent an apartment at P oA,

know these apartments well, Subject
that he did and began ‘to sketch them byJLOGINOV
didn't seem to be interésted in his efforts. '-LOGINOV then, asked:
how many apartments’ thi were in the building. Subjéct answered,
16, LOGINOV then Said that. since Subject knows the apartments

ted

*'so. well he must also know the people who live there, Subject

‘LOGI:

admitted ‘that he did, At this point ‘some other Soviets came in ;
aid the conversation was terminated, On 6 November LOGINOV
dropped ‘by for “sole small ‘talk'and left sovie Soviet ‘chocolate *

(whi.

NOV came 1h at. 1230 and“asked Subject to go to a restaurant:

‘and hé had po one..to leave. the store with. Subject . then. invited.
“LOGINOV t6-his' house but LOGINOV insistéd on.a restaurant.
Subject ‘agrééd to go on 12 or 13 November.

“Frolt the ‘above Subject concludes ‘that LOGINOV-wants, to.”

r ita ‘to. report. EMPTY-6 (who lives’in P.A, de los.
‘santos 104). LOGINOV-would bé interested in LIESPTY-6
(there is nothing about nim in the notds). Subject answered

that he finds LIEMPTY-6 very suspicious: because in the 5 years |
that he hag known him, Subject doesn't know what he.does for a
living. ."He thinks he writes novels. In any case he is ‘home

all day-long. In addition he lies. Example: ‘He told Subject
that -he owns the new (LILYRIC) building. He is also eccentric.
Besides his windows face on the Enbassy, LIEMPTY-G has apartnent
17, The apartment directly below his, number 13, (probably old
LILYRIC) is empty, Subject went to see the owner having LOGINOV
in mind, The owner said that the apartment had been rented by
LIE MPTY-6 which Subject also: finds surprising. The whole theme
was that-he is suspicious of LIEMPTY-6 and that-LOGINOV wants

to recruit him to report on him, All of the above on LIENPTY-6

and his apartment was verbal. There was not a word about him

in his notes. : : :

3. I told Subject that if LOGINOV tries to recruit him for’
any purpose, he is to cut him short and to indignantly refuse.
He is,also to tell LOGINOV that SILNIKOV had tried ‘the same thing

clearly could not get any farther with Subject on a
personal level with Lautz present, I brought the meeting
to an end witha request to see Subject again after he
had received the Intourist letter, obtained the names of
those of his colleagues who were going, and decided
definitely whether or not he was going to go, Subject
said he would be hanpy to talk with me again, get the



information I wanted, and, " if I liked,"” "be briefed”

on the trip, It was-agreed he would call Lautz to set

up the necting. _(Tav- eituation was such that I do not
