AGENCY FILE NUMBER

Released under the John F.

Kennedy assassination

Records Collection Act of

1992 (44 USC 2107 Note].

Case#:Nw 66261 Date:

09-01-2022

December 8, 1995

Status of Document:

Postponed in Part

Number of releases of previously postponed information: 12

Reason for Board Action: The Review Board's decision was premised on several factors

including: (a) the significant historical interest in the document in question; (b) the

absence of evidence that the release of the information would cause harm to the United

States or to any individual.

Number of Postponements: 5

Postponements: All the postponements in this document represent Social Security numbers.

Reason for Board Action: The text is redacted because the public disclosure of the redaction could

reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, and that invasion of

privacy would be so substantial that it outweighs the public interest.

3369 HOUSE OFFICE BUILDING, ANNEX 2

WASHINGTON, D.C. 20515.

October 13, 1978

Dear L.J.:

As you know, the Committee is winding down and the

decision has been made to terminate your services as of Oct-

tober 31, 1978.

You have been off the Committee payroll since March 1,

1978 due to duplication of salary payments from the New Orleans

Police Department.

The following is how I have calculated the Committee's

salary settlement with you:

You were hired July 5, 1977 at a salary of $24,000 and

taken off the payroll February 28, 1978. Your W-2 statement for

1977 gave a salary of $11,815.27. from the New Orleans Police

Department.

The monthly amount would be $984.61 ($11,815.27 ÷ 12).

Prorating this amount would give $7,745.60 while on the payroll

of the Committee.

($984.61 per month for the period July 5, 1977

to February 28, 1978).

You have been due $1,015.39 per month from the Committee

since March 1, 1978. (The difference between your Committee

salary of $2,000.00 per month and $984.61). Dividing $1,015.39

into $7,745.60 (the overpayment referred to above) would carry

you seven months and nineteen days or through September 19, 1978.

Accordingly, you would be due a gross salary of $1,387.70

for the period September 20-October 31, 1978 (at $1,015.39)•

However, because you completed a year of service on

August 1,

you were entitled to a 7% salary increase or $1,700.00 annually.

This would provide an additional amount of $425.00 for the period

August 1 - October 31 so the total amount due you would be

$1,812.70.

Further, recognizing the difference between your monthly

the Committee settlement be in the gross amount of $3,000.00.

Docld:32243299 Page 6

page 2

This will be accomplished by restoring you to

the payroll for the period October 16 to November 30 at a

gross monthly salary of $2,000.00 ($24,000.00 annually).

Please complete the enclosed payroll forms. If you

have any questions, give me a call.

Sincerely,

Re: Termination of Lawrence J. Delsa

We have reached the time when action must be taken to term-

inate the services of Delsa or restore him to the payroll.

Delsa was hired July 5, 1977 at a salary of $24,000.00 and

taken off the payroll February 28, 1978. His W-2 statement for 1977

gave a salary of $11,815.27 from the New Orleans Police Department.

Prorating this amount would give $7,745.60 while on the payroll of

the Committee. The monthly amount would be $984.61.

He has been due $1,015.39 per month from the Committee since

March 1, 1978. (The difference between his Committee salary of $2,000

and $984.61.) Dividing $1,015.39 into his 1977 overpayment of $7,745.60

would carry him for seven months and nineteen days or until September

19, 1978.

In the case of Robert Buras, his salary was greater from the

New Orleans Police Department, thus is overpayment from the Committee

his larger and the differential due him since March 1, 1978 is smaller.

Applying the same calculations to him as was done for Delsa would

carry him for fourteen months or until April 30, 1979.

Returning to Delsa's case, if the decision is made to terminate

him, some salary adjustment should be made as we have gone by the date

(September 19, 1978) when he should have been terminated.

ience important to the purposes of our investigation.

sion, shows a clear understanding of the nature of the

work to be performed.. He appears to be a reliable,

stable, intelligent person who is interested in becoming
