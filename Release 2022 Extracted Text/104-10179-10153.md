A.

Loss of Cache - AMBANQ/1 voluntarily raised

the subjoct of the loss of the cache of material on the

Island of Caja de los Muertos.

The loss arose from a

failure

to cache these materials on an island south of

Cuba in

the area of Camaguey Province. The JURE

controlled ship,

the #/V VENUS, sailed Iron Puerto Limon

during the month

of Janurry with the intent of caching

these

materials,

Including some 200 lbs. of the C-4

which had been made available to A/l.

On resching the

cache area the ship

was survellled by a small, commercial-

type aircraft,

resulting in a decision on the part of

the VENUS Captain to proceed to Puerto Rico rather than

risk the Joss of the

matorials to the Cubans. A/l

stated that he interviewed each member of the crew

separately and each told essentially the same story.

Upon arriving in the area of Ponco, Puerto Rico, a cache

was made on the Island previously mentioned with the

Intent of retrieving the materials in about thrco days

done.

JURE Purchase of One Ton of Pentolite - A/1

Informed me that the JuRE had purchased a ton of Pentolito,

a high explosive, which is not as desirable for use as

C-3 Or C-4; but

nevertheless, & good material for them.

My first reaction was to ask where A/l had this material.

I reconsidered this request, stating that I hoped it was

well hiddon.

All assured me that it was. I gathered

from my conversation with All that this material was

not in place in Costa Rica.

In view of WAVE's report via AMTAUP/2, speclfically

1n WAVE 1463 (IN 11718), Para. 1,

"Alants said large

sun money has been spent in purchase nodern C-3

explosives and some C-4 which was in CISNEROS' home

there subsequent from Costa Rica," I discussed this

matter of explosives with cos, wavE.

This discussion

was predicated actually on my

telephonic discussions

on this same subject with C/SAS.

On the basis of

this background,

on 5 February 1964, I called A/1 in

san Juan, Puerto Rico.

Based on a carefully prepared

Iine which Shackley and I had agreed on, I told A/1

that he had better move all such material immediately

Including Puerto Rico.

sponking of Puerto

out of the United States', advised A/1 that despito:.

RIco,

his influentlal friends, he was bound to get into

trouble 11 he did not get out of that area and move

his operations to Costa Rica without further delay.

I also warned All that the setting up of communications,

that 15, a radio station in Kland,

would almost.

certainly got him into trouble with United States

authorities and result in the confiscation of his

equipment.

A/1 was obviously unsettlod by my

statements and asked me if I could not intervene

with appropriate authoritles for time to move the

materials.

I told him that I could not so intervene

as each arn of the Government had its role to play

and its duties to ful11ll

and these could not. be

Influenced. All stated that ho would nove an fast

as humanly possible to take the materials out.

JURE PlanA. - According to AMBANG/1, ho plaar

the infiltration of two teams into Cuba within the nex

six weeks.

The f1rst team, of from two to four individuals,.

connunication facilities to be used betseen Latin America,

Puorto Rico, and the U.s.A.

This chart also included

the development and preparation of all the electrical

gear to be

infiltrated into Cuba.

The chart was an

orderly presentation of the

to be done, the time

•In which to do it, the cost involved, the equipment

needed, and man hours roquired to

time.

The time

span of the chart covered Doccmber 1963

through Harch 1964, causing me to bellove that, 11 1t

were achered to, the JURE should be in reasonably good

shape so far as its electrical explosive plans in general

are concerned.

• • H. AKBANG/1's Considering Aerial Re-Supply - A/1

had many questions at this lime regarding the

Teasibility

of eventually using an aircraft to re-supply his efforts

He wondered about radar offects and potential

on low Ilying aircraft.

I mentioned to his that there

were varlous fino commercial type aircraft which had

unusual potential for clandestine operatiors,

I knew of none

that had the capacity for a round-trip

fron points as far away as Puorto Rica and Venezuela

All arvised me that he had the pilots necessary.

to engage in such missions and that he was nost interested

In considering this capability; not only because of the

purpose it could serve in re-supply, but also in the

psychological effect that such opcrational independence

would givo their movemont.

A/1 Asks for Whatever Guidance 15 Possiblo on

Cuban Radar Capability - A/I indicated a great intorest

In receiving any information we can make available

regarding radar capability along the Cuban coasts. I

All has an obviously good grasp of radio

devices, and of the chararteristics of explosives: but

same timo it da obvious that he depends upon more

technically compotent porsonnel for working with these

materials.

statoo that he has engineers in the jure

who hare a famillurity with radio and explosive materjals.

All's Continued Nerotiation with the Second

- At stated that while he renain:

yet reached the point in his negotiations which will

bring that group into the Jure.

All Indicated his

opinion that within approximatoly six wets be sill have

worked out a progran porhaps bringing this groups into

the JURE.

2. Comments - Insofar as the activities of the JURE

in U.S. territory

are concernod, l belleve it is important

to point out certain facts.

A.

Whereng various AMTAUP/2 reports have indicated

varlous activitios and statements on the part of the JURe

representative in Miami, Rogello CISNIROS, against this

Agency, there hag not bon any overt proof of these

activities. Nor has thero been ans overt proof of a

propaganda

drivo, black lotters of any sort, adverse

radio propaganda,

or evon a progran based on a person-

to-person

basis.

No should take note of the fact that

CISNEROS's talking has boen restricted to his orn little

coterio of clandestino cronies.

I discussed the matter

of ANTAUP/2's reporting it great length

with Tony Sforza

and Harren Frank.

1 indicated an interest in proof

that CISNEROS 1g'

behind a donigration progran against tho

Agency tolling them that we would not tolerate such a

progran, II In

inct, wo could prove its existence.

specifically pointed out tho caso recently reported of

the choice of ono DiOniNto SUAREZ Esquirel, who reportedly

has beon chosen to do to Latin America and carry out a

program of denigration of the Agency in universitles, as

& case which no could and should follon in order to

satisfy oursolvos that the JURE 1s working against us.

B.

The AXOTS and tho JURE - 1 satisfled aysell in

talking to Tony Sforza that the AHOTS in general are

politically opponod to the JURE and that the reporting

•I this group, to which ANTAUp/z belongs, must be

considered in

Isght of lla projudices and lack oi

objectivity insofar no tho JUrE is concerned.

C. The Position

of Royclio CISNIKOS - Despite

what may be the naturo or AUTAlPi2's reporting, and ve

must sumit that he appears to report pretty nuch what

he hoars, the activities of Rogello CISNEROS 1n Miami w11l

sooner of later, unless ay varning to AlBANG/l has some

effect, Involvo

the JURE with U.S. authorities. This

development is somethink that me should expect and the

time may be hero when it becomes necessary to tell

AMBANG/1 that CISNEROS had bettor leave the U.S.A.

Financial Matters - AMBANG/l received a total of

35 thousand dollars.

Ten thousand of this sun is understood

to be for the assistance of those elements not aligned with
