5.

Rime ZMITROOK DO SHIRAKOVA was born on 1ß January

1934 in Moscow. Her husband, Valeri

29 October 1937. They were married in 1963 and their daughter

USSP

Alegsandra, (Sasha) was born on 22 October 1963.

At the time that

tho british brothers knew the ZMITROOks, he (Valerty) was an o(u)

engineering student.

At that time the LMITROOKe reolded at

8 Vladimirakaya,

artment 31, House 23, Moscow E = 123.

The name ZMITROQI is reported above as transmitted to

ua by the Britich. We belteve, however, that the ending syltable does (S)

not represent a correct troncliteration and may be an attempt to

record the name as given to the Brittah phonetically.

We believe the S)

proper traneliteration would be ZMITRUK. Please note that the

(S) [British have also polled the name as SMITROOK.

7.

Going on the assumption that a destitute American would

turn to the Embassy for assistance, we would approciate your checking

with the Embasey in Moscow, whether they could possibly ilontily

the American who san short of fundo and borrowed money from fira

clilaook. Based on the information supplied by the Brislah, we S

would presume that the American borrowed the money from her sore-

tine before che left Intouriot in 1963.

We would aloo appreciate your

acking the Embassy if they have any other information on the ZMITROOKs.
