MEMORANDUM FOR: - Deputy Director for Plans

‘THROUGH : Assistant Deputy Director for Plans

SUBJECT: Indications of the Scope and Possible
Damage of New Allegations by Ramparts —
Hagazing -

1. This memorandum is Zurnished for information only.

2. arly in April 1968 the Cffice of the General Coun-
Sel made available to Central Cover Staff (CCS) a copy of a
letter and an attached list of organizations sent to the
internal Revenue Service (IRS) by Hr. Jon Frappier of Ram-
parts Hagazine. The letter, dated 5 April 1958, had been
Yurnisbed CGC through INS linison channels. The letter appended
a list of 145 tax-exempt organizations and indicated that all
were suspected of having been funded by or having cooperated
with CIA.

3. The letter indicated that the listed organizations
ze only a part of the organizations being scrutiaized by

Ramparts and that other available sources of information on

these and other suspect organizations had already been examined.
The other sources of information were stated as including the
Literature of the organizations and interviews with their staff
members; records available in the Attorney General's offices

dn Illinois, Massachusetts, and New York; data available at

the National Infornation Bureau in New York, Group Research,
Inc., in Washington, D,C., and the Foundation Library Centers
in New York and Washington; and tke 990-A returns available at
the district offices of the IRS. The letter requested 990-A

returas for specified years and in most cases the Form 1023
Application for Tax Exempt Status. Ramparts asked the IRS
to make these materials available for inspection at a mutu-
ally convenient tine. * 7

4. A veview of available CIA data on the listed organi-
zations has shown that 89 of them were at one time or another
Somehow associated with CIA. Only two of these:

are of current operational interest. These two activities
aad 45 organizations formerly of interest to CIA were men-
tioned in the American press during MUDOWZT.01 Forty-two
other listed organizations which weré in fact associated

/ with CIA were not exposed curing(HHDOVEL.O| We have found no
evidence that 55 organizations onthe list were ever directly
or indirectly associated with CIA, (Because two of the names
on the list are successive names for the same organization,
the actual total number of organizations listed is 144 rather
than 145.) Three additional project organizations, not
included in the Ramparts list, may be vulnerable because
they were covertly runded by hitherto unexposed foundation
funding instruments included in the list. Only one of these,

is of cur-

rent operational interest.

5. The CA Staff was furnished 2 copy of the Ranparts
letter and List and has checked out the organizations of
possible previous CA Staff interest. All organizations not
veadily identiZiable with known project organizations or as
cCS funding instrumenta have been traced with RID, with CS
frea divisions that might logically have had an interest in
them and against CCS Registry files. Through arrangenents
with the IRS, representatives of CCS and CGC also examined
available IRS data (999~-A's and Forms 1023) on the listed
organizations. This was done before the IRS documents were
made available to Ramparts, in order to be sure that restricte
$90-A, Part I. data would not be furnished to Ramparts and to
try to establish the reasons for. Ramparts’ interest in the
organizations. Cur current findings are the resuits of these
various file reviews. z

6. Attached hereto are annexes listing and discussing
the several categories of organizations on the Ramparts list.
Annex A ceals with the two organizations on the List which
are still of active operational interest. Both received

under several sub-categories the 42 organizations with which
the Agency has had some direct or indirect operational ties

DOWEL. Annex C lists the 45 organizations included in the
April. 1968 list which had former Agency operational ties
which were subject to press allegations during MADOWSI]. O/ Annex
D lists and briefly discusses the 55 organizations included
in the Ramparts list that had no known operational connection
with CYA. Annex E lists and discusses three hitherto uvex-
posed operational activities that are not included in the
April 1963 Ramparts list but. which are vulnerable because
they were covertly funded by hitherto unexposed funding instru-
ments included in the Ramparts list.. Annex F shows'a copy of
the Zull April 1968 Ramparts list.

7. ‘The 42 former project organizations listed and des-
cribed at Annex B which have not previously been charged vith
CIA association in American press comment fall into five
general categories;

a. Foundations and other organizations used as
witting funding conduits for covert subsidies to pro-
jeet organizations and other operational activities.
Sixteen organizations fall into this category. Eleven
of them are multipurpose legitimate foundations. which
were recuited by CCS. Four were created or recruited
for exclusive use in funding one project each and one
was used for a one-time. travel grant.

b.. Witting legitimate foundations and on
tions used exclusively to provide funding and status
cover for singleton agents. Six organizations were
used in thig way and provided cover fox seven agents
in various parts of the world... Some of these organi-
zations also provided one~time support for unwitting -

: individuals of operational interest.

ce. Proprietary or supsidy project organizations. vl
here ara six of these: Projects (CAMANTI HUSTLER,
FOCLPROOH, (EnUsABLy, Sopanrisif, and [ARSTRIRE cen

dad. Three organizations with which there were
witting operational contacts to obtain information
and leads but which were not actively invelved opera-—
tionally.

@. Eleven unwitting organizations which received
grants from project organizations for operational or
cover reasons or which cooperated with project organi-
zations.

8. We cannot say with complete assurance that all 55
of the apparently innocent organizations on the Ramparts
list in fact never had any Agency ties. Our researches have
shown that RID indices are often incomplete. We have found
operational use data in CCS files on organizations with no
record in RID. The same is true in other cases where infor-
mation was available in CA Staff or area division files on
organizations which drew a blank in RID. . It seems likely,
however, that any undetected operational interest in the
organizations was in the period of the early 1950's and of a
marginal nature.

9. In reviewing available information on the listed
organizations we attempted to determine whether there was a
logical external basis for Ramparts’ interest in the organi-
zations or whether some form of internal Agency leak might
be involved. Our reviews and analysis show fairly conelu-
sively that Ramparts bas been proceeding on the basis of
overtly. available information, supplemented by interviews
with project personnel:

a. All but three of the 42 terminated but hither
to wnexposed project organizations and 24 of the 55 or-
ganizations which actually had no Agency tics are some-
how related to project organizations or funding instru-
ments previously exposed. Some of the organizations
made legitimate or covert grants to previously exposed
organizations, others received covert or legitimate
grants from previossly exposed funding instruments or
from innoceat foundations that had made legitimate
grants to exposed organizations, and still others had
officers who were associated with exposed CIA organi~
zations.

b. Thirty-one innocent organizations on the
Ramparts list and three of the hitherto unexposed
organizations of former interest to the Agency have -
no such known ties to exposed Agency organizations.
In most of these cases, however, the names of the
organizations are similar to those of exposed organ-
izationa or are of a nature that makes them suspect.

19. It seems Likely that Ramparts" interest in a num
ber of the 42 unexposed project organizations is based on
factors unrelated to the actual CIA dealings with them.

11. The Headquarters elements that are or were responsi-
ble for the projects and activities that could be implicated
by new Ramparts allegations have been notified of the fore~
going findings No further action is required at this time.

Three Organizations with Which There Have Eeen Some
Mitting Contacts .

30. International Rescue Comuittee, Inc. (IRC) - Manhattan,
New York (93)

Under Project QKGAUNT, $2,500 was furnished INC in
1950 - 1951 to obtain biographic data on defectors. In
Deceuber 1962, IRC Chairman Leo Cherne offered cover and
FI ese of IRC to Eumons Brown, DC/CA. C/EE declined
the offer, indicating there already were useful contacts.

IRC received legitimate grants from J. Frederick Brown
Foundation (34) and 3. MN. Kaplan Fund (101).
