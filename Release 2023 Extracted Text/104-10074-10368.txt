RE: Hermann Derek BRYAN
A reliable source reported that Derek BRYAN
visited PU, Chao Min and LO, Yi Ching, New China News Agency
(NCNA) officials in Ottawa, Canada, on 13 MAY 71. Source
advised that BRYAN indicated he left Regina, Saskachewan for
the U.S.A. on 20 APR 71, and returned to Canada recently. He
did not state where in the U.S.. he had been. BRYAN also
mentioned he had been to the U.S.A. for 16 days, six weeks
previously, where he visited friends and attended a conference.
Again, he did not indicate where in the U.S.A. he had been.
BRYAN stated the highlight of the conference was the showing
of two movies, one of which concerned Laos, now being shown in
New York and Toronto.
2.
BRYAN further stated that the U.S. China
Friendship Association in San Francisco should be established
by June. According to BRYAN, the idea of establishing U.S.-
China Friendship Associations is well supported by Overseas
Chinese and students and even by the "Revolutionary Union".
3.
On the topic of the Revolutionary Union, BRYAN
stated that the Union is not limited to the Bay Area (San
Francisco). Regarding the organizers of the Union, he revealed
LABEW is presently residing in New York and Susan WARREN is
also in the Union; however, he refused to disclose the name of
another residing in San Francisco. BRYAN praised the publications
of the Union and commented they have a high ideal.
4.
Source also stated that during the conversation
BRYAN indicated he met with PHIP while in Seattle. It seems
PHIP is of the opinion that the Association should not be located
in the West, but rather it should be established in the East,
the center of U.S. activities; however, as the U.S. is so big
and as the West had earlier contact with China, BRYAN does not
think it is disadvantageous to have the Association located in
the West.
5.
Source was unable to further identify LABEW or
PHIP. PHIP may be identical to Rita PHIPPS or Ron PHIPPS of
Seattle, Washington, U.S.A.
6.
Susan WARREN is possibly identical to Susan
Heiligman FRANK of New York.
7.
)
Derek BRYAN was appointed a visiting Associate
Professor of Political Science at the University of Saskatchewan,.
Regina Campus, Regina, Saskatchewan, Canada, from 1 JAN 71 to
30 JUN 71. A reliable source reported that BRYAN was to return
to England on 14 MAY 71.
