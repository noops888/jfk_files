Thave had to put off my departure for one weck as a result

of this as it was important to keep my fingers on the pulse at

this moment.. have a meeting with the partners tomorrow when

"hope to get things moving and a firm proposal sent to bankers.

I mentioned to the partners thai you had some novel ideas

¿o solve the delivery problem and in vien of the possible extra

cost, they have asked me to get an outline from you as to what

your ideas are, both fron the point of view of additional expense

which, if adopied, would need to be inclaried in the budget and also

to give some added encouragement sine this particular problem

comes up again and again and su far l have refused to be drawn

on the subject thuugh you know my first ideas. think a letter

to the Club Nantico will reach me safely though it would obriously

be inadvisable to mention the Spice Isiands.

I hear there is much afoot in your part of the world ind both

SECT

Handititing Assessment Report

Alastair Wicks AF

The writer seems to be a very clever individual of a high

intellectual level who handles his affairs in a independent

manner

Endowed with a good intelligence, he is well educated

and cultured. He has not only absorbed but, also, assimilated

the material he has read and studied and utilizes it in a pur-

poseful fashion. His thinking is cleat, logical and versatile.

His incellectual facultles are well trained and differentiated,

and, to a large extent, they support his practical calents and

Interests constructively. He discards superfluous matters, and,

proble pos beatene pish only the visa rental agitty

with well developed analyzing and synthesizing faculties,

Is quite intuitive and senses instinctively the implications of

happenings around him.

He is

an alert and astute observer of smäll details chich

he relates correctly to their larger aspects.

Being quite re-

sourceful, he combines imagination with

sober matter-of-factness.

He follows prescribed rules and regulations when absolutely

necessary ard, whenever possible, exercises his mental indepen-

dence.

He forms his own opinion and judgment and keeps his ow

counsel in making decisions.

He may accept somebody else's

suggestions that he considers suitable for his purposes but he

is not actually influenced by others.

At times, he may deliber-

ately make somebody feel as if he is seeking his advice and

following it, but, in reality, he does what he considers best.

He is very critical and evaluates by high standaids.

He can be

very outspoken in his criticism or he can cautiously withhold it

depending on his appraisal of the circumstances.

His interests

cover small items of information to large size projects and

operations.

While he notices everything that is going on, he

can concentrate on his work.

When required, he can

switch quickly

from one task. to another.

His memory functions well and he can

reproduce facts easily.

## Page 28

SEC

The writer has administrative ability on a supervisory level:

Within a military secup, he could take orders as well as issue

them, although he prefers the latter.. He can be systematic and

methodical in his approach.: He can work out a blueprint.of

intricate undertaking and supervise its proper execution. He will

quickly and easily adapt to fluctuations in a situation and change

his tactics accordingly.

He is skillful in manipulating numbers, and he can think in

large

terms and transactions. Apparently, he is quite interested

in money. and he

seems to know how to get the best possible

advancage out of a financial transaction.

he possesses great tacility in expressing himself orally and

In writing. He can make his points palatable and can be quite

convincing in his arguments.

Also, he can formulate his ideas

and purposes in different ways, depending on with whom he is

dealing.

He should have

talett for learing foreign languages.

He is a gifted person who will exploit his talents in line with

the demands that are put before him. He also seems to have

physical training and skills.

He has a natural feeling for

form, sound and color.

He probably has developed artistic

appreciation and may have an artistic hobby, possibly music.

Emotionally, the writer is complex but fairly well balanced.

Innately impressionable and sensitive, he has hardened himself

in the course of his life in order to be less vulnerable.

He

has his feelings and impulses under fairly good control and avoids

being carried away by them.

In his private life, though, he may

tend to be somewhat excitable and irritable. He is self-centered

and most interested in his personal advantage.

This is a trait

that he tries to cover up by being smooth and

pleasing in his

dealings with people. He possesses natural psyshological under-

standing and can be very diplomatic.

He manages to appear out-

going and social while basically he

is quite reserved and detached.

He seems

to avoid emotional involvements in order to preserve his

objectivi.y.

---

## Page 29

= 3=

His appearance is poised and sophisticated, and he knows

how to handle himself under different conditions.

Being an

independent and sophisticated individual, he has developed his

own philosophy and code of

ethics by which he lives. He does

cot seem to have any quains about doing things that would not

be conventionally acceptable. He is very broad minded about

himself and others, and he

detests pettyness, even

in wrong-

doing:

The purpose justifies the means for him as long as the

transaction

takes place on a large scale.

He is most skillful

in practicing various types of deception and he is quite adroit

In manipulating people and situations. He is very active and

could have "his fingers in a number of ples." He is emotionally

somewhat strained,

but he has sifficlent stamina to support his

general functioning.

The writer is apparently an unusually talented person who

could function in different types of positions. He could be

military officer, a business executive, a politician, an intelli-

gence agent or he could be a diplomat. He would not be suitable

for any kind of routine work; but he is well qualified for

mentally challenging assignents--the more challenging the better.

He is a diligent worker

who is somewhat vain in showing off his

competence.

He likes to demonstrate how successfully he can

carry out a complicated and delicate job.

Then he is willing

to acceft an assignment, one can expect a high quality of work

performance, but anybody who would expect loyalty from him would

probably be disappointed.
