TEXT:
QUESTIONS
1. ACTION REQUIRED: NONE, FYI ONLY.
2. ON 6 MAY 1998, IHSOMBRERO PROVIDED STATION WITH A WRITTEN
RESPONSE TO THE 10 QUESTIONS POSED BY THE JFK ASSASSINATION REVIEW
*BOARD (ARRB) REGARDING TELTAP TRANSCRIPTS OF CALLS MADE BY<LEE HARVEY>
*<OSWALD>TO THE SOVIET EMBASSY IN MEXICO CITY. THIS REQUIREMENT WAS
TRANSMITTED TO STATION VIA E-MAIL CORRESPONDENCE FROM LA/SA.
!
3. AS THE FOLLOWING RESPONSES FROM IHSOMBRERO ARE INCOMPLETE, WE
ASKED THEM FOR REPSONSES TO THOSE QUESTIONS THEY DID NOT FULLY
ANSWER. WE ARE NOT CONFIDENT THAT WE WILL GET ANY FULLER RESPONSES
SOON, OR AT ALL. FYI, WE MADE NUMEROUS REQUESTS OVER THE PERIOD OF
SEVERAL WEEKS FOR THIS INFORMATION. THE COS REQUESTED THE INFO
DIRECTLY FROM IHSOMBRERO/6310 WHO THEN PASSED THE REQUIREMENT TO
IHSOMBRERO/7154. C/EXT GEORGE R. CRIALEX THEN REMINDED S/7154
REPEATEDLY OF OUR INTEREST IN THE RESPONSES TO THESE QUESTIONS.
WE
DO NOT THINK THAT IHSOMBRERO DELIBERATELY STONEWALLED US ON THIS.
MORE LIKELY WE BELIEVE THAT THEY CONSIDER THIS MATTER TO BE A LOW
PRIORITY FOR THEIR SERVICE.
A. CAN WE HAVE THE ORIGINAL DOCUMENTS? ACCORDING TO
IHSOMBRERO, THERE ARE DOCUMENTS AND TWO INFORMATION CARDS CONCERNING
THE DEBRIEFING OF MEXICAN NATIONAL SILVIA ((DURAN)). ONE OF THE
DOCUMENTS CONCERNS AN AMERICAN BY THE NAME OF VINCENT THEODORE
((LEE)), AND THE OTHER ONE CONCERNS NICARAGUAN CITIZEN GILBERTO
((ALVARO)) UGARTE ALSO KNOWN AS ALBERTO ((SANCHEZ)) WHO SUPPOSEDLY
*MET WITH<LEE HARVEY OSWALD.> AT THE SAME TIME THERE WAS A NOTE ON THE
VISIT OF OSWALD TO MEXICO CITY.
