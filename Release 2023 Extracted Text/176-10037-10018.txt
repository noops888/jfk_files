MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRESIDENT
Subject:
Congo
Developments since my report to the President on
October 22, 1962.
1. Both Adoula and Tshombe have indicated willing-
ness to ignore the question of the Standstill Agreement
and proceed to the creation of Tripartite Observation
teams. This has, however, not yet been done. Gardiner
is proceeding to Elisabethville to expedite.
2. No progress has been made in Commissions on the
vital questions of integration of forces, oath taking,
amnesty, constitution, or division of foreign exchange
and revenues.
3. The IMF team to work out integration of cur-
rencies leaves to morrow for the Congo.
4. We are announcing a $25 million contribution
towards the UN Import Program over the next six months.
The UK, Belgium, Italy, Germany and Japan are being pressed
to contribute a matching amount. So far only the UK has
given any favorable indication.
5. We have revealed the Greene Plan for training the
ANC and we are engaged in talks calculated to bring about.
its general acceptance. Efforts are underway to firm up
US role and equipment US can furnish.

6. Senator Dodd has written a letter to Tshombe:
urging him to carry out the Plan. He will, tomorrow,
ask Mr. Struelens to discontinue his activities here,
following which he will by letter urge Tshombe along
similar lines.
:
7. Mobil Oil will refuse to pay Katangese taxes
even at the expense of having to close down their
operations and is encouraging other companies to do
the same. Belgium has promised support with Belgian
companies involved.
:
8. We are seeking funds from MAP to finance a con-
tract with Air Panama to provide air transportation to
the Congolese Army. A Presidential waiver will probably
be required. CIA has agreed to administer the program.
9. We hope to sign today an agreement with the GOC
to expand the PL 480 Program by sum of $2,500,000.
:
10. Arrangements have been made to reinforce UNOC:
with 1800 Indonesian troops. Efforts are being made for
replacement of Ethiopian F-86's which have been withdrawn.
