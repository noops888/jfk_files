The undersigned on 12 September 1968 went to

New York to effect a termination settlement with Edward G.

There were

two principal aspects to the settlement:

secure TICHBORN's acceptance of an amend-

ment to his contract providing for a one-time: Lump

sum taxable payment of $3311.00 and releasing the:

• Government from any further claim and

insure that TICHBORN had, as. of 31 August 1968

administratively severed his relationship with WUSALINE,

particularly that his

accountings for expenses in-

curred in 1968 were

submitted,

recorded by WUSALINE,

and certified correct and proper by both TICHBORN

and WUBRINY/l1.

2:.

The first pant of the settlement went smoothly.

TICHBORN on 12 September 1968 readily accepted the amend-

ment to his.

basic contract:

He brought along for the Covert

tax Unit a

Copy of his 1966 income tax return which the

prietary company (WUTACTIC) which will issue TICHBORN

a Form 1099 for income tax filing.

He readily endorsed

and save to the undersigned the check for $477.38 la

settlenent of the amount he owed wi Division from nis

List of expenses for 1968.

TICHBORN was asked to record

the purpose of each expense.

The undersigned emphasized

In WUBRIVY/ll's presence that TICHBORN should ensure

that

no experses chargeable to wiskint/l's private firm were

charged

to WUSALINE.

Both TICHBORN and WUBRINY/ll were

reminded that all expenses on the Venezuela project were

chargeable to WUBRINY/l's private firm as well as one-half

of the expenses on the Mexican Border project: TICHBORN

said that he would get all of the accountings fron WUBRINY/11's

TICHBORN

atso said that a few of the charges on the partial list

of expenses which the undersigned had given him to review

The undersigned secured

agreement from TICHBORN and WUBRINY/ll that TICHBORN'S

services on WUBRINY/l's Venezuela projeci were as great

as any other officer who worked on it and that, therefore,

WUSALINE. should

receive for TICHBORN's services on als

The undersigned

obtained fion TICHBORN the two credit cards American

talned a movie producer who visited him as an outgrowth:

of his trip to California to develop a movie adjunctato

There is a possibility that WH Division may.

It differs from the original in that

the journalistle feature is dropped in favor of strictly

Added is the possibility of develop.

TICHBORN nad two meetings with QUSALI/1, both of

which went well from the cover point of view.

meeting involved TICHBORN and QUSALT/l, while TICHBORN

brought his wife for the second in which QUSALT/l was

wined and dined.

TICHBORN said that QUSALT/l is all

in favor of TICHBORN's proposed assignment. However,

in view of past WUSALINE/ Iberia inactivity, QUSALT/1

has añ attitude of "I will believe it when I see it."

QUSALT/1 was particularly intrigued with the possibility

of a movie deal and sald that Spain is by fär the cheapest

place to make movies.

BEE

the one disguieting feature of the meetings with

QUSALT/1 concerned TICHBORN's wife.

She took the occasion

to query QUSALT/l on all aspects of living in Spain.

This comment shook

TICHBORN's wife whose best friend in Mexico caught hepatitis

and whose children subsequently got it.

The undersigned specifically asked TICHBORN LE

his wife's concern with hepatitis posed the possibility

of a refusal to accompany him.
