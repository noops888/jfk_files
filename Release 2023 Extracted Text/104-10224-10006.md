ME'ORANDM FOR: HT: JAMeS V. ACCOrd, 55.

THROUGH

Head of 88 Career Service

SUBJECT

Notification of Non-eligibility for Designation as a

Participant

in the CIA Retirement and Disability System

1.

As you may know, we are in the process of reviewing the esployment

history and current career field

of all employees in the Agency to idantify

those who are eligible for designation as a participant in the new ClA.

Retirement and Disability Syster.

In this process, the initial review of

each case

is made by the individual's Career Service. If the Head os his

Career Service nominates rim for participation in the system, this aomina-.

tion is reviewed by the CIA Retirement Board which recommends final action

to me.

However, if the Head. of the Carcer Service auvises that che employee

does not mect the basic requirements of MR 20-50 for participation, ! have

accepted

this finding

without further review by the CIA Retiresent. Board.

This practice has been adopted in the interest of expediting this screening

process so that those employees who are eligible to participate in the sys-

ten may be designated participants as soon as possible.

2..

In your case, the Head

of your Career Service has advised no that

yuu do not meet the requirements of HR 20-50 for designation

as

a partici-

pant and I have accordingly made the formal determination required by the

regulation that you are not eligible for designation.

From. a review of your

record it appears that the decision of your Career Service was based upon

the fact that you do not have sufficient time prior to completing 15 years

of service with the Agency in which you could complete a minimum of 60 months

of qualifying service as required by regulation.

My determination that you

are not eligible at this time for designation in no way affects your current.

status under the Civil Service Retirement System, nor does it preclude recon-

sideration of your eligibility to participate in the CIA System if you should

meet the requirements for designation in the future.

Should you desire further information concerning the requirements

for designation as a participant in the CIA Retirement System, I suggest that

read paragraphe of

HR 20-50 and paragraph 5 of the Employee Bulletin

¿ated. 30 July 1965, entitled "Public Law 88-643, The Central Intelligence

Azency Retirement Act of 1964 for Certain Employees."

4. It is always possible that the records upon which the determination.

wade_ in your case may have-been incomplete

"or inaccurate regarding

your actual

employment history

with the Agency. If, after studying the materials cited

above, you have

questions regarding the determination that you are-not eligi-

ble to participate in the CIA Retirement System, please feel free to contact

officiais

of your Career Service..

They are familiar with the details of your

case and will gladly discuss them with you.

In addition, you may wish to dis-

cuss your case with the CIA Retirement Staff located in Room 6E-1319 Head-

Quarters (extension 6001). If such discussions do not resolve any questions

you have regarding your eligibility, you may request that your case be formally

considered by the Board..

However, this request must be made

within 30 days of

the date of this memorandum.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Dirrator of Security

SUBJECT

: NiCORD, James W., Jr. Emp. Ser. No. 58124

Fitnega Report

This is an annual fitness report covering the period

1 April 1969 through 31 March 1970.

Mr. McCord completed

his first full year as Chier. Physical Scurity Division.

During

1969 the Division underwent many changes, a direct regult of the

personal efforte of this empluyer. He has shown the initiative

to sock out new ways and means to harden the security of our

domestic and overscas facilities by lapping all possible tech-

nological sources buth in and out of Government. His efforts

have produced tangible results and in my judgment, our posture

in the physienl security field is far superior to any of our con-

teniporaries.

2.

With the

spiraling costs of manpower, Mr. McCord

has concentrated on the porential for use of technical devices lo

replace the human asse:.

He has made roniarkable inroads into

this field by way of imagination, ingenuity and drive.

3.

Mr. McCord has the quality to inapire his subordinates.

He is demanding, but understanding. On more than one occasior.

he was asked to take under his wing employeen who were labeled

"problems." Through personal intercat and effort, he has salvaged

the majority of these individuals to a point where they are performing

in a highly satisfactory manner.

+. In the previous fitness report, I alluded to the fact that

employee has a tendency to find it difficult to see another person's

point of vicu.. This, licel, is attributable to an innate stubbornness

which obviously is difficult to overcome. Mr. McCord is a very

---

## Page 94

principled individual who once convinced he has hit upon the proper

course of action will usually vield only by direction. We're discussed

thia, and l've noted a determined effere on his part to broaden his

tolerance for other opinions.

5. Overall, the employer has made a substantial contribution

to the Office of Security by his dedication to hio job, his tenacious

attitude toward upgrading our physical security standards. a curious

and inventive mind ever searching dos better waye lo solve a problem

in hid area of responsibility, and e cost conaciousness in the admini-

stration of his division. I rate hiri an everall "Strong."

SUBJECT

McCORD, James W., Jr., Emp. Ser. No. 058124

Fitness Report

1. This in an annual fitnces report covering the period

1 April 1968 through 31 March 1069. During the firet period of

this report, Mr. McCord surved as the Chief, Technical Division/

PTOS and continued to display a very high degree of professionaliam

in administering the Agency's world-wide Audin Countermeasures

(ACM) program. Under his guidance, several new devices and

techniques were developed which have helped the Agency.and the

Intelligence community to maintain pace with the sophisticated

advances by the opposition in the field of positive audio.

2. Mr. McCord initiated the necessary planning for the

activation of the Interagency Training Center (ITC) which provides

ACM instruction to all members of the community in the latest of

equipment and techniques.

3. On 14 October 1968, he was reassigned to the position

of Chief, Physical Sccurity Division.

Although he had relatively

little experience in this particular field, he has quickly assimilated

the necessary details to manage this Agency effort. He has taken

•steps toward the development. and use of the most advanced physical

security equipment and techniques to protect the Agency. Under.

the supervision of Mr. McCord, the Agency Srcurity Command

Conter operations have been expanded and improved. He has been

assigned the rexponsibility to organize and direct the Security efforts

relating to the protection of Agency assets in time of demonstrations.

riots, and other civil disturbances.

He coordinated the Agency

Security effort with the U. S. Secret Service in protection of the.

4. Mr. MiCord is considered to be economical in his use

of equipment, manpower and funds.

5. Perhapa one of the stronger attributes this employee

poggcases is his ability lo urganize. In a relatively shurt time.

he has deliberated the Physical Security Division's mission and

already taken stepo to restructure it within existing manpower

limitatione to more ellectively react to its responsibilities.

6. He inspires his subordinates and has the respect of him

superiors. There have been instances, however, when Mr. Milord

has exhibited a certain intolerance with individual who do rot agree

with his point of view, resulting in some friction in their working

relationg.

There has been much improvement in this regard, ard

I do not feel it will present any problem in the future.

7: I anticipate this employee will continue to absorb kary-

ledge and experience in the physical security field at the rapid rate

he has during his short tenure and am confident his efforts will

result in a major contribution to the Office and Agency, I rate

Mr. McCord a high "Strong. "

Mr. McCord s

supervises a technical operation with considerable skill.

Although not an engineer by training, he has breached the difficult cap of communi-

Cation between the administrative and technical aspects oi his Division. He has

maintained a high esprit de corps under difficult conditions which insolve the

necessity of his personnel to travel extensively throughout the work. Although

such duty carries with it numerous family problems, Mr. McCord is able to

marage the Division in süch a manner as to maintain a high state oi morale.

Perhaps the most outstanding accomplishments which I attribute to lit. McCord's

fine management of his Division lies in the field of developing useful and esoteric

equipment in the counteraudio field. I have a distinct impression tat he and his

Division are considerably ahead of other Government départments in this area of

activity.

This fact alone is a high tribule to his management skill. Because of the

success in this field, I consider him to be economical in the use o! Fanpower and

funds.

During this rating period, the Technical Division has had operational

success in the overseas area.

I attribute this success to the careial planning and

training which the incumbent has accomplished and directed. Furtrer, he has

already shown a high degree of skill in planning for a neu activity o: considcrable

CERTIFICATION AND COMMENTS

3. Corrents of Revicwing Official

I concur thoroughly with Mr. Winters' evaluation of Mr. McCord's

vigos and enthusiasm, skill

and judgment. I would and to this that he

has demonstrated extraordinary ingeatity and leadership in supervising

ine desciopment of several new and valuable techniques in the counter-

measuses field. However, I would rate him only "Proficient" in

Specilic Duty Number 6, for I beliere that he has not been as effective

as he night be in liaison and coordination with other components of

the Irtelligence Community represented on the Technical Committee.

This is unfortunate, for it detracts from his outstanding performance

in all other elements of his assigned responsibilities.

He must work

on irriproving these

rclationships and he has been counseled to this

effect by his current supervisor.

American C-118 Aircraft Doured in Soviet

Azertaijan 27 June 1958 by Sorlet MIO-17's

On 27 Jus- 1758, a C-118 cargo plane, assigned to the U. 8, 115

Force in Wiesbaden, was fired on and forced down near denilarkh, Sovlot

Azerbaijan.

The plane was carrying nine U. S. airmen, three of whom

are assigned to this agarwy. They are Colonel Dale D. Brannons, Major

Robert E. Crans and Major Bennie. A. Shupe.

The other six men vero

regular Air Force renders assigned to Wieabaden, Germany. The nine mon

were en route from Wiesbaden to Teheran and Paldstan on a flight carry-

Ing cargo for CIA. Col. Brannon and Hajor Crans were plannarg to got off.

the plane in Teheran had the plane renained on course.

The plane, while en route to Teheran from Nicosia and as a result

of bad weather

and nailgation error, went off its plotted course and

crossed into Soviet Armenia.

There it was intercepted and fired on by

three MID-17'g and caught fire in the left wing.

Five of the cres bailed

out and the other four rode the aircraft down to a safe landing on a

small airstrip at Gendscith in Soviet Azerbaijan.

The crew menivers who

had renained on tre plane to 1t3 landry got out safely and the plane

was burning fiercely when tho crew last saw it.

The part of the cre

that parachuted was surrounded by Soviet peasants, some of whon beat and

struck at the crew menbers. One of the ren, Major Bennie Shupe, CIA

orployee, vas taken by the mob to a telephone pole and narruly escaped

hanging

before being rescued by the Soviet nilitary.

Major Shupe and the remainder of the crew were turned over to the

Soviet military, and after an orericht stay in a Soviol nilitary

garrison near Stepanalert were taken to a city bolloved to be Jerlakh,.:

and then Mown to Baku,

The substance of the questioning, treatment and techniqueo al

Interrogation has been eshmatively

in the courso of the debriofinze.

In summation, the interrogationa

of the crew members were superficial and do not appear to havo been

backod up by close coordination and cormunication with Moscow for

intelligence research purposes.

It 13 possible that tha quick ac-

knowledgment by the Soviet Foreizn Offico of the landing of the C-118

in Soviet torritory precluded the YID from fully exploiting the crow

members. Colonel Brannon and Captain Kano wore separated from the

group and glven preferred treatment, apparently with the intention of

developing them for inforration purposes.

Wo are conviriced that both

men handled themselves extremely sell ard did not disclose any intor-

nation concoming the Agency or 1ts activities.

To date we have no indication that the Sovlets know at tha timo

questioned him about the 7170th Support Group and the 7405th Support

CONCLUSIONS:

A. It 1s our opiulon that the possiblo compromises artaine out of

this Incident are relativoly minor in nature and that no major

compromises occurred.

Bo That the Suvlets "nosed" on the true naturo of the flipht and

personnel of the C-218.

That the reasons the cron mombers wore given an early release

were as followar

1. Primarily, the Soviet Interrogators falled to use all

of the leads at their command, particularly Brannon'e

addross book, and failed to break the cremen through.

interrogation.

2.

The crew did not inadvertently disclose through in-

terrogations, the purpose of their flight, 1ts rolation

to the Agency and that of three of its crew to Cla..

3. The Sovlots apparently failed to chuck out the namos

other data in Brannon's address book through their

sules prior to rolease of the crow.

¿ No ineriminating Information or material was Immediatoly

recovered from the burned aircraft.

5. Several of the crew dostroyed incriminating buildine

passes and notations in leir wallots while on their

way down in their parachutes, or Inmodiately aftor

landing in thelr chutes.

6. There were either no leaks or insufficient loalos of

unriminating information through any room conversa-

tions at baku among the crew, which may have been moni-

corod by the soviets, or such convorsations as there

nay have bean vere not properly interproted, or Intor-

preted soon enough to tip the Soviets that there was
