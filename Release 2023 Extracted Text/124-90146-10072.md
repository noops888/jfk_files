According to the sourco, a pro-Palestinian organization

National

Palestine Committee by Aron Raindorf, & Belgian citizen

born on December 22, 1919, at St. Gilles.

Following a period during which the two groups

resulted in a new

group being formed by Dupire and

Yvonne Sterck

which was called The Responsible Group for the National

Palestinian Committee and the Palestinian Committee-Brussels

without other members of either group being consulted.

Raindorf,

according to the source, is currently attempting to regaia

The "New York Times" on 3/24/61, in an article entitled

"US Asks Court Bar Questions On Castro Foes in Miami Area", by Peter

Kihss, reported that an unidentified US agency had intervened in a

CIA. Richard Gibson, acting national secretary of the FPCC, said he

based his call on an announcement of a "Revolutionary Council" set up

by the two major anti-Castro groups in Miami. Gibson said there had

been reports of CIA support of an anti-Castro enterprise and that forces

had been using Florida as a training and staging point for attacks

against Cuba.

He said that reckless.CIA action could lead the country

to the formation of "Revolutionary Africa (RA)"

, a magazine which was

an organ of the Politbureau in Algeria. The editor of the English

language section was to be Richara Gibson.

Schleifer had worked with

Gibson in the FPCC movement but had lost some of his confidence in

Gibson as a true revolutionary after the latter "jumped" at a bureaucratic

position with the Politbureau. Schleifer had lived with Gibson in

Algiers and regarded him as the same type of man that Djilas (not

further identified had denounced in

"The New Class" (not further

identilled).

Gibson's position with the Maspero (not further identified)

roup, and thus the FLN (not further identified), predated his

involvement in Cuban affairs.

Schleifer pointed

out that long before

the cuban revolution, Gibson had been working in France with the French'

"neo-Marxist" left.

He had

considerable editorial ability and should

have been an asset to "RA"

reports covering contacts of Sugar during his visit to the

United States, September 24, 1970, to October 11, 1970.

In accordance with your request, the following

comments on and evaluations relating to the validity and

usefulness of the information in the reports are set forth:

1.

Sugar's recent presence in the United States

was reported by two sources of this Bureau.

These sources

expressed no suspicions relating to his activity or cover.

2.

Based upon preliminary review, the information

provided by Sugar appears accurate and generally conforms

to

information independently reported

by our sources.

slight

distortions noted were in accord with existing rumor or "talk""

within domestic movement circles.

3.

The information provided by Sugar is considered

U

good intelligence value,

but not in itself of high or

exceptional value.

It confirms and supports information

developed by Bureau sources and in several instances provides

current assessments and useful investigative leads.

Sugar's obvious close association with Richard

Ward (indicated

in reports S-52 and S-56)

would appear to offer

him an opportunity to establish a stringer relationship with

the weekly New

York City left-oriented "Guardian," in the

event this is in accord with the projection of his

cover.

Ward, in spite of criticism of the "Guardian," continues to

be included

as a staff member in the publication's masthead

and his articles continue to be published.

Although the

"Guardian" has a United Kingdon address (13 Hood Ride, Orp*Both

Kent), no London correspondent is listed in

its masthead.

Republic of North Vietnam representation in Paris and would

appear to be in a position to provide an entree for Sugar

to the North Vietnamese.

: (U):

5.:

The detailed information furnished by Sugar

relating to Ward (report S-56) suggests Ward as a likely

candidate for approach.

Our files indicate Sugar has been

acquainted with Ward since 1967. We would very much appreciate

receiving a current personality assessment of Ward by Sugar.

Your interest in referring the reports of Sugar to

this Bureau is appreciated.

NOTE:

Sugar is CIA cryptonym for Richard Gibson who operates

in behalf of CIA from London, furnishing coverage of European

and Third

World New Left and

black extremists.

The 29 reports

furnished by the Agency on 10/29/70 covering Sugar's contacts

while in the U.S. from 9/24-10/11/70 have been disseminated to*-

appropriate field offices and Bureau files by Bulet 11/9/70,

captioned "Richard Thomas Gibson, Information Concerning,"

Bufile 105-93072.

Richard Ward is included on the Security Index of

the New York Office and he is a current staff member of the

"Guardian!'

He was in contact with the North Vietnamese

Diplomatic Mission in Paris in 5/70 and traveled thereafter

to Hanoi and Laos for a five-week visit.

According to the

• information made available by Sugar, Ward is critical of the

"Guardian," the Soviets, and members of the New Left in this

country.

He is currently doing research on a book about

American-Vietnamese relations and he claims this book will be

scholarly, other than a propaganda piece. Based upon a current

assessment of Ward by the Agency, we will consider interviewing

him, looking towards his development as an informant.

Classified "Secret" because incoming so classified,

and because it relates to sensitive CIA source compromise of

whom could cause serious damage

to defense interests.

Dear Herb and Comrades,

just a hasty note to let you know that René and

Gilbert have recently returned from Amman wich news

about the desperately critical

situation chere. Never-

theless, we beiieve the sicuation is excellent for the

revolutionary forces, despite the seemingly crushing

weight of the reactionary, imperialist forces.

Throughout Europe, initiatives are being made

by comrades, especially

in regard to Arab embassies,

needling them or coaxing them to show solidarity with

the Palestinians or demonstrating againsi the most

reactionary (e.8. the Jordan Embassy here was occupied

by students yesterday) Cables, letters and personal

calls are being made to Arab governments and their

diplomats throughout Europe, and the Iragi and Syrians

shamed for their inactivity, despite all their pasc

verbal support of

the Palestinian Revolution.

It would

be especially useful loï you comrades in the States to

inform René and me of any activity that you are engaged

in on Palestine and please send us for republication

texts of any statements, cables, etc.

Manu and Diane send you fraternal greetings.

They

are now married, by the way, ana

await reinforcement in

the revolutionary ranks in pecember.

There is a possibility I might make it to the States

sometime this fall. If so, I will try to come to Chicago

to give you a first-hand report on the sicuation in these

parts, as well as the Middie East.

This Bureau desires to be advised of all pertinent contacts

of possible investigative or intelligence interest to this Bureau that

are made by Sugar during his travel in the United States.

For ready reference purposes and for possible assistance

in the direction of Sugar in this country and abroad, there is enclosed

a list of individuals associated with the Weatherman faction of the

Students for a Democratic Society who are presently in a fugitive status,

and a list of black extremist fugitives. Any information Sugar may

in both Europe and the U.S. By separate communication we are alerting

appropriate field offices to the expected presence of Gibson within their

5/10775 PEm

Captioned individual, a Negro male, who was formerly active

in the U.S, as a leader of the Fair Play for Cuba Committee, currently

serves as a CIA informant based in England. He operates under the cover

of "overseas representative and correspondent" for "Negro Press

International," which is allegedly a Chicago-based firm. From his

residence in London, Gibson furnishes coverage of European and Third

World New Leftists and black nationalists.

(V)

CIA has advised Gibson will be in the U.S. for consultations

with the Agency, during the period 9/20-10/18/70. During this period it

is anticipated Gibson will visit New York City, Chicago, Detroit, Atlanta,

Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Philadelphia to visit old contacts and

to "become reacquainted with the scene in the United States. "

REC-32

105- 930

1174

From past emperience, Gibson may be expected ta endeavor

to contact Negro militant activists in all the above cities, and specifically

he will probably be in contact with the pro-Chicom Revolutionary Union in

San Francisco and Leibel Bergman and Davida Fineman who are asso-'

ciated with this organization.

He very likely will endeavor to contact the

Ad Hoc Committee for a Marxist-Leninist Party, USA, in Chicago and

members of the Republic of New Africa in Detroit and Philadelphia.

He

has been closely associated with Robert Franklin Williams in the past and

may be expected to endeavor to contact him in Detroit,

Reierence is made to your memorandun dated April au,

1970, your reference I-216, requesting the source of an article:

from the February, 1970, edition of the London publication,

"Synic," relating

to subject, which was forwarded to you by

routing slip dated April 4, 1970 2) U

releas

This article was obtained by our Legal Attache,

London, presumably from a review of the public press.

It is noted in December, 1969, Leibel Bergman, the

theoretical leader of the militant Maoist San Francisco-based

Kate for

Blaine

3/20/18 concessing oki

Revolutionary Union, according to a source who has furnished

reliable information

in the past, indicated shortly after

meeting Gibson he distrusted him because of Gibson's reputed

affiliation with the Central Intelligence Agency.

At- this

documen

time, Davida Fineman, also a member of the Revolutionary Union

the former paramour of Gibson), defended Gibson, repeatedly

stating the charges against him were unfounded and the

old stuff."

Nevertheless, Bergman at the time persisted in

his suspicion of Gibson.

7(0)

As a matter of additional interest,

in February,

1970, Bergman commented that during his travel the previous

month abroad, he had met with Gibson in London and stayed

overnight at the Gibson residence.

At this time, Bergman

stated he found Gibson to be charming, likable, sophisticated,

intelligent, but hung-up on a feeling of self-importance.

Bergman described Gibson as doing "good works," but stated

Gibson is not as important as he belleves fs)(u)

From the above it would appear Bergnan, who may be

described as an astute tactical Marxist-Leninist, now accepts

Richard Gibson.

Any additional pertinent information believed

to be of interest to you regarding the activities of Richard

gabson will be promptig made avariabled

Switzerland. However, since his whereabouts were unknown,

notification of same could not be sent to the subject.

The FFP officer stated that if the subject had applied

for entry into Switzerland during the week instead of the

weekend, he might have been authorized limited entry.

According to this officer, the subject should write to the

Bundesanwaltschaft in Bern concerning

the incident at Brig

and request that he be furnished a reason for it. He would

then receive a copy of their order and wor

SECRETI

In view of this latest development, it is most strongly

urged that the bureau, through liaison, have CIA interview "SUGAR"

specifically concerning the following points:

(1) Any and all knowledge "SUGAR" has

concerning activities and contacts of

HOWARD BRUCE FRANKLIN while the latter

was in France:

(2) Any and all knowledge of DAVIDA

FINEMAN.: In this connection, it is

suggested that CIA be requested to

encourage correspondence between "SUGAR"

and FINEMAN.

(3)

"SUGAR" furnish CIA with all corre-

spondence to and from the RU and that

"SUGAR" be directed in a logical way to

encourage such correspondence with the Ru.

In view of LEIBEL BERGMAN's admitted difficulties over

communications with Red China and lack of knowledge of current

events in that country, it is believed that if "SUGAR" can

favorably establish himself with the RU as a contact in Europe

he will be able to furnish valuable information on any other

contacts the RU may attempt to establish on the Continent and

might even be utilized as a cutout by BERGMAN for the RU.

In view of the delicate nature of the information

contained in the LHM, the Bureau may wish to restrict dissemi-

nation to CIA only.

In referring the above requests to CIA, the Bureau

should insure the bona fides of "SUGAR"

as a CIA operative and

his reliability lest SF 3169-S be compromised.

San Francisco will continue to follow this matter

with SF 3169-S.

RICHARD GIBSON

INFORMATION CONCERNING

In June, 1969, a confidential source, who has furnished

reliable information in the past, advised that at an Executive

Committee meeting of the Revolutionary Union (RU) held on June 8,

1969, DAVIDA FINEMAN read a letter which she had received from

RICHARD GIBSON, whom she described as a Negro who resides in

Europe and whom she knew while she was in France.

This letter

was a run down on the Marxist-Leninist-Mao groups in various

countries in Europe and described some of these groups as

technicians

U

which would include various members of the bourgeoise.

According

to this source, BRUCE FRANKLIN in no uncertain

terms described GIBSON as a CIA agent who was exposed as such

and had to flee France lest he be killed. FRANKLIN stated that

he had proof of GIBSON's affiliation with CIA. LEIBEL BERGMAN,

on the other hand, stated in no uncertain terms that BRUCE

FRANKLIN's allegation was completely untrue and that GIBSON

had been thoroughly checked out when BERGMAN, himself, was in

Red. China and had been found to be all right.

BRUCE FRANKLIN

continued the argument by stating that he could prove

GIBSON was

a CIA agent because some friends of his in France

had been exposed and arrested shortly after their introduction

to GIBSON.

(U

At the Executive Committee meeting, it was decided

that LEIBEL BERGMAN and the FRANKLINs were to iron out their

differences about GIBSON

amongst themselves and it was

further decided that the RU may be in contact with GIBSON.

REVOLUTIONARY UNION

In September, 1968, a source advised that the

Revolutionary Union, commonly known to its membership as

the Red Union (RU), was formed in early 1968 as a covert

revolutionary, Marxist- Leninist organization ideologically

oriented toward Communist China, which at views as the

model of the correct revolutionary Marxist-Leninist line

developed through MAO Tse-tungo The PU advocates the necessity

of violent revolution and open guerrilla warfare to overthrow

the existing political system in the United States, and effect

radical changes in this nation, and some members are collecting

firearms, explosives, and other weapons and have engaged insi

guerrilla warfare and firearms training.

#In the San Francisco

Bay Area, the RU consists of three locals, one each in San-

Francisco, the East Bay, and the Peninsula,

In April, 1969, a second source advised that the RU

partially surfaced during that month through advertisements in:

select "New Left" periodicals, identifying three members of the

Executive Committee as public spokesmen and offering for sale

select writings of the RU, including aStatement of Principles,

in the form of "The Red Papers,

with the exception of the three

publicly identified spokesmen, the general membership of the RU

will remain covert however, individual members are free to reveal

their RU membership to close political associates as the necessities

of political effectiveness dictate.

The RU's published "Statement of Principles' calls for

the smashing of the existing state apparatus by the United States

working class and the establishment of communism and the dictatorship

of the proletariat; recognizes the necessity of violent revolution

and organized armed struggle to achieve those ends and calls for

the creation of a revolutionary party based upon Marxism-Leninism

as developed through MAO Tse-tung:

was a CIA agent.

In connection with their suspicions, the

Italians requested the informant to check on one DAVIDA FINEMAN,

who was ostensibly traveling with GIBSON as a translator.

was subsequently learned that FINEMAN was residing in

Paris

at that time but had been a resident of New York City.

Referenced communications from New York and Los Angeles

concerning FINEMAN identify her background.

Chicago has no

additional information concerning this person and does not,

in fact; have sufficient knowleage to determine whether the

person traveling with GIBSON in Europe in 1966 is identical with

the DAVIDA FINEMAN who has emerged as part of the Revolutionary

Union.

The Bureau and Los Angeles

are requested to furnish

to San Francisco any information which would assist in effecting

an identification of this person, it being believed by Chicago

that the definite possibility exists that the person traveling

with GIBSON is in fact identical with the current member of the

Revolutionary Union.

Chicago would desire to know when FINEMAN returned

to the United States and if she has any recorded activities

within left wing movements since returning. It would seem

that her emergence in the Revolutionary Union is highly

suspect in view of the probability of her former association

with GIBSON. As GIBSON's identify is known to the Bureau and

the interested office, it would seem that the implications

of a CIA operation are clearly apparent.

In this connection, san

Francisco letter of 10/30/63

reflects that HODEE EDWARDS has apparently returned to the United

States from England and San Francisco is presently attempting

to verify her residence.

In connection with EDWARDS, it will

be recalled that she had

written to the Ad Hoc Committee while

a house guest of RICHARD. GIBSON in London concerning some

theoretical aspects of pro-Chinese ideology and that GIBSON,

while in contact with CG 6547-S in Chicago, had furnished the

name Of PAUL RICHARDS, SOn Of EDWARDS, as a good person who

had been active in the communist movement on the west coast.

RICHARDS recently wrote to the Ad Hoc Committee expressing

his favorable attitude toward the ideology as expressed by

the Committee and the possibility exists,

therefore, that

he was prompted to do so on advice from his mother,

HODEE

EDWARDS.

The totality of these events suggest that CIA has

effected operations in this country with the possible intent

of attempting to arrange for travel to China, and Chicago

strongly suspects not only FINEMAN but EDWARDS and RICHARDS

as being part of these operations.

Chicago respectfully requests any information the

Bureau may have in this matter.

the AHC. • This letter was furnished to SA ROBERT R. GLENDON

by CG 6547-S on 5/8/68.

For information Milwaukee, GIBSON is referring to

PAUL RICHARDS in the third

paragraph of this letter.

Milwaukee may desire to utilize this information in report

form such must be paraphrased and the source to identify the

characterization as RICHARDS is CG 6547-S who met with GIBSON

last year in Chicago.

Milwaukee is requested to review Bulet

dated 10/20/67 for instructions regarding the AHCo

Chicago

would also suggest that GIBSON's name not be used

in any

report.

The Bureau's attention is invited to the comment in

paragraph two regarding M.I. LASKI and in particular that

which notes that LASKI alligned himself with MIKE BAKER in

London who now professes an anti-MAo. line. It would appear

Dear Harb,

plaase gasive my alamed th answering your letter

of February 12.

Nuch has been happening here, not all of

for the best, as

far as I can

see, but I still believe

that the sharpening racial and class contradictions in

Britain -- and elsewhere in

Europe - in recent weeks will

provide an excellent situation in which Marxist-Loninists

can work more vigorously than in the pass here. But there

still remain many other internal contradictions,

personality

conifices, aistorted reflections of the Cultural Revolution,

etc.

that

must be-resolved. I wish I could write in greater

detail, but I am certain you understand, with your experience,

far more than I do.

Concerning "comrade" Laski, nothing further has been

heard of nim since he left nere

for Paris.

His great com-.

rade here, Mike Baker, who published a huge interview with

Laski in his publication, Red Front, also took to attacking

what he now calls

"Mao's ultra-Lert clique."

Whether Laski

approves o? Baker's new anti-Mao line, I cannot, say, but

biras oi a feather do flock together...

The person living with me that you mentioned in your

letter is

a lady, mother of the young student at the University

of Wisconsin that you met at my hotel in Chicago when I was

althoush deeply disturbed by its general reformist, not to

say capitulationist line, yet still greatly swayed by some

wish you comrades might help him to understand the correct

line and find a way forward.

(U)

Give my regards to your wife,..

who I trust has now completely

recovered from her bout of poor health.

Fraternally yours,

Richang Gibson

SUGAR

(U)

SUGAR is a cryptonym

Ior richard thomas

a U.

Negro who has been utilized by the Central Intelligence e

Agency

(CIA) as an informant in foreign countries.

He has been

a source of information relating to the New Left and Black

Power activities:

His background is well known to the Bureau,

and we have always had some question concerning his reliability.

Recently, CIA reported that SUGAR had encountered

some difficulty in Sweden as a result of his efforts to

establish contact with American deserters in that country

On April 17, 1968, Richard Ober confidentially

advised that the Dutch internal security service had con-

tacted CIA and was making an inquiry concerning SUGAR.

this point, CIA does not know why the Dutch are making the

check, but the Agency is speculating that SUGAR's activities

in Europe have come to the attention of the Dutch

It is

Ober's opinion that CIA at some point will contact a top

official in the Dutch internal security service concerning

the Agency's interest in SUGAR.

In SuAl security service concern c

winches

Ober stated that in the event the Bureau receives

any inquiry from the Dutch concerning SUGAR, the Agency would

like to be contacted before we respond/to the Dutch. In this

connection, he pointed out that

internal security service is scheduled' to visit the U. S. in

the very near future and will be in contact with the Bureau.

CIA is speculating concerning the possibility of

requesting information concerning SUGAR.

that we check with
