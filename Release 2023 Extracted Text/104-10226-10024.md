1.

Ploate pouch additional information about the

proposed dovelopment of "the new AMFRAME orrunization" in

ordor to onable Hoadquarters to determine if there is any

conflict with the intent of the LNLOFT action approving

the termination of AuSCROLL.

2.

As you may rocill, it was originally thought that

distribution of economic data might be handled by AkHIM,

after termination of ANSCROLL, possibly by croation of an

AMHIN econonic desic staffed by former AMSCROLL employees.

In any event, noither Headquarters nor LNLOFT anticipated

that the tormination of one orgunization would be followod

by development of another conducting the samo operational

activities.

On the contrary, our presentation to LNLOFT

emphasized furthor reductlons of organizational support.

3. In addition to a detailed description of the

proposod organization and related

administrativo and operational

cost estimates, ploase forward more information abost plang

for distribution of the new series.

A. OPERATIONAL IIGILIGITS

During the quartor under review AMSCROLL continued with

its program to discredit the Cuban regime's cconomic management

(os mismanagement) and to seck to discourage Frec World trado

with Cuba.

To this end AMSCROLL continued publishing its serous

cconomic studies and comnont of the Cuban oconomic arca.

material is mado availablo to sclected flims engayed in intor-

in the sugar trado.

which is beamed to the Cuban nudience and which is incroasingly at-

tempting to provide sorious comment upon economic devolopmonts in

Cuba or those aroas of cconomic activity outside of Cuba which would

have an interost among the Cuban listeners.

ANSCROLL receivod 15 lotters from Cuba which compares with 18 re-

coived during the provious quarter.

The monthly count was: April-

6, May - 5, June - 4.

2. On 30 April AMSCROLL ccased broadcasting over AMTHIGH.

Effective I May the program was presented over JMilOPE.

This change

in station (and a consequent change in timo) has perhaps effected

the listenership in Cuba; however,

we expect that any unfavorable

developments will be ovorcome and

that this program will at least

re-gain its previous levol of listoners.

Typical themes included

discussions of Cuba's housing problem, its actual sugar production

measured against Castro's earlier claims of what the production

breakdowns and stoppages at the Cuban refineries, activ

would with the Soviet Union and the world sugar market, reporting

the progress of the Venczuelan dock workers boycott of

those nations that also trade with Cuba

the fight against buroau-

cracy, and cconomic aspects of the Middle East crisis.

A main AMSCROLL effort continued to be an analysis of the

current sugar crop.

as 13 February ANSCROLL predicted a

6,101,000 tons.

This estimate was

tons in a release dated 16 dune.

These studies received newspaper

attention and AMSCROLI, has received favorable comment from sugar

brokers and other technicians engaged in this business.

B. ADMINISTRATION

The amount budgetod for the quarter under reviow was

signifieant do-

by the cancciiation of tho AMTHIGHl radio program and by continuod

attention to economies of operation within ANSChOLL Itself.

C. PROBLEMS

The Station is not aware of any specific problems having

to do with the AMSCROLL organization.

Mention might be mado in

passing of the over presont morale probiom (which is by no moans

limited to AMSCROLL) engondored by increasing economies and ro-

strictions in operations.

For years, the fuestune supplied the arsenal the Arabs were bulluing up to wago

holy war sasinst the tiny Jewish enclave, furthermore, they reiterated their un

conditional eupport to the Arabs. But when the 'hour of truth" camo, the lerael-

1s made plecereal of the Arabs and their sorder Military hardware. The Rusolans

failed to care to the uasiatance of their silles, and both wore ridiouled to the

rullest extent. This should be a losson for Fldel Castro, who relies on the

soviets' military junk de much as on their support as "allios".

2) CASTRO HIM ZIE PROPITIATES "BURFAUCHATIS"», after a brief recess caused by the

mobilization 1n the cane Plolds, the lar of bureaucratlem' was renewed with full

visor by the razana riyams. To Ministers were fired, whole Ministrios wore "ra-

Elonalizod", and payrollo were trimed to the core. Homevor, the same rógime

that volced threats of prison torms agalnet those that failed

to comply with

antl-hureaucratle Inetructions, creates nes sources of bureaucratiam, such as,

for example, the Book Institute and the Na"lonal Institute for Forestry Develop

from tides in southern Pinar del Ro, and sie desalingzation of sea water. But,

on top of their intrinsically fantastie character, these projects are paralyzed

due to the lack of rechnicians and of tecterleal handbooks. What great men Marx,

all woll born Cubans. Yot, thoro's a lot of truth in what the Russian said.

Indood, minor daughtors depond on their parents, get ovorything they nood from them,

and are subject to their supreme authority. If the daughter worls, sho must also turn

a good part of tha frults of her toil over to her paronts.

This 1s what happons with Cuba and the USSR. The Sovlots and their satollites sell

Cuba 78,6% of hor imports, dictato the policy of the Havana rógino, and take 80% of

her exports.

In view of this depondonco, who can dony that the rolation betweon Cuba and Russda 18

The russian only Lod whon ho spoke of "pampering". Cuba 1s not pampored by Mother

UNIDAD MONTHLY, ISSUE, NO. 37, May, 1967

This Issue has been almost entiroly devoted to a reprint of I. Andrés Collazo's sta

tement concerning his experience as a CUFLEI representative in Icodos. We have ra

printed most of the contents of the statenent in the form of a signed article suti

tlod "INSIDE CUFLET".

As 1s known, Collazo tells of the "dog fights" that have risen betsoen the prirateers

(such as FRANGISTAS) and CUFLEI oVer Violations of contracts, bad condition of the

ships, ote.

Ho also discusses the decline in frea world shipping to Cuba and 11s causes, as vaill

as the nature and background of the shippers that participate in the Cuban trado.

Bosddes the above, the following 1s Inciuded In this Issue:

PAGE 18.

EDITORIAL: "A CAMUNIST TRUTH": Volsky, the Chiel of the Soviet observing dolezation

to the CIPAL meeting in Caracas, said that "Cuba is the ninor daughter of the ISSR,

and ninos daughters are pampered". The Russian's insolence has roused the anger of

all well-born Cubans. Yet, thore's a lot of truth in shat the fussian said.

Indeed, ulnor daughters depend on ther paronts, get everything they need fros thes,

and are subject to their supreme authority. If the daughter works, she sust also turn

a gocd part of the frults of her toil uver to her parents.

This is what happens with Cuba and the USSR. The Soriets and their satellites sell

Cuba 73.6, of her imports, dictate the policy of the Havana régina, and take 80% of

her experts.

In view of this dependence, who can deny that the relation between Cuba and Bassia 1s

that of a ndoor daughter with respoct to her parents!

Tho fussian oniy lied when he spoke of "pampering". Cuba 1s not paupefed by kother

Russia: she 1s oppressed, exploited and corrupted by her.

radio program but that never should any mention of the

contents be mentioned as this could

reveal his identity to

the DSE.

Pancrasio stated his help would not be much but

that his letters might contain information which could be

of value.

He wrote that he could not go into detail as

he was unable to spend much time at the typewriter..

Pancrasio concluded by saying the photos of Antonio and

Reynaldo were in the hands of a security agent who had

orders to find them.

They had both been fugitives for a

long time.

The other photo (in triplicate)

was of a

Canadian

citizen whose passport was

was a note saying

this was lotter number for fren percurain and requesting

Guillermo ALFONSO to forward the papers to the same postal

address which he had previously utilized.

Copies of the

The one paper, dated 27 September 1961, appears to be a

list of Costa

The second paper appears to be a list of Brazilians

who visited Cuba, probably in mid 1960 when Janio QUADROS made

a visit to (uba as part of his presidential campaign in

Brazil.

On 2 May 1967, a JMWAVE Officer visited Guillermo

ALFONSO in an effort to identify Pancrasio and develop

sufficient information to evaluate his information and

deterrine the extent of his

access.

ALFONSO claimed he

had no idea as to the identity'of Pancrasio and was unable

to suggest possible candidates from his relatives in Cuba,

former work associates, classmates or neighbors.

ALFONSO

had retained the envelop from Cuba which contained Pancrasio's

second message and a short message to ALFONSO.

The note to

ALFONSO stated that Pancradio had received ALFONSO's name

and address from some unidentified individual and that it was

requested

that ALFONSO forward the contents of the letter to

the

ANSCROLL address which was enclosed.

ALFONSO was

cautioned not to mention anything concerning the matter to

anyone, especially to relatives in Cuba.

Pancrasio stated

this was his second letter (not fourth as indicated on the

material which was forwarded on by ALFONSO) and that the

.. first had been sent direct to the AMSCROLL address.

It was

stated this was the first letter by which ALFONSO would

serve as intermediary and that other letters would come

at infrequent intervals.

Pancrasio had decided to use an

intermediary address as

the AMSCROLL address was too well

known.

Pancrasio concluded his note by saying that he

preferred to remain anonymous and that he would be remaining

in Cuba for two

more years.

In addition to the above cited

message, the letter to ALFONSO contained a calling card with

the name Dr LuC B. INNOCENT, President of the Haitian

Revolutionary Movement.

On the back of the card was typed in

Spanish "without comment",

5.

JMWAVE traces on FERNENDEZ, IRSULA and ALFONSO are

negative.

INNOCENT,

according to HZPA-12507, dated 2 August

1962, is a Haitian terrorist,

Fidelista, who was planning

to enter Panama from Columbia.

ALFONSO was instructed to forward any mail received

from Pancrasio in an expeditious manner and JMWAVE will

follow any leads obtained which might help to identify

Pancrasio in order to develop him into a more productive

source of information.

"INIDAD" NO:THLY, ISSUE NO. 36, APRIL, 1967.-

(1) ANOTHER REGIME OFTICIAL [ELECTS IN GREAT BRITARI: A brief story on the Colla-

zo defection, followed by excerpts from his original statement. Excerpts Include:

reasons why Irce-world sea trade with Cuba 16 declining (U.S. Black Llet, Letin

workers' boycott, eti.); Cube-trading chipouners take aivantage of Castro and over

charge him for charters; the personnel problen in "'ambisas"; the planned deception

for Expo 67 (exhibiting console record players made up of foreign components and

wood as Cubar-nade); general corclusion: régise officials don't know where they are

headed for.

(2) EDITORIAL: HATED BY FRIMID AND FOES The Russians hate Castro because he has

two-timed them In the Sino sovict rift; the Chisese loathe him because they regard

him as a mercenary who has sold out to the Soviets. Latin American Rods hate him

as well, because, as they, say, he has promoted fractionalism in their ranks. Anti-

Conmunists throughout the Asericas hate him too, as there is not a country in the

hemisphere where mothers and wives are not mourning the loss of a dear one to Cas-

troite terrorists.

and anti-red Cubans would not touch Castro with a ten-foot pole.

Hated by friend and foe alike, how could anyone think that Castro may eventually

survive a chronic eo none crisis that his own ineptitutle has wrought on the nation?

PAGE TWO:

(1). MOROCCO BREAKS DEPENDENCE QI CUBAY SUGAR: Fron the EIR we take the story on the

Moroccen plan to develop their. own sugar industry at the expense of purchases from

•Cuba. This plan, we stress, is receiving jolish financial and technical ald, which.

shows to what extent Castro's Red cotrades art concerned with his sugar interests..

(2) DO THE SOVIETS SEND "REJECTS PAPPS TO CUBA?: Also fron the Elf, this 1s the.

story on the "coincidence" that poor-quality or defactive parts began to arrive in

Cuba, under Soviet-Guban barter agreesents, right after the price of sugar droppedo

1. JAVE forwards herewith a study entitled Economic

Relations Between Cuba and the Soviet Union:

How Much lepen-

dency? Both santiago and Headquarters are being providca with

an original and one copy of the study in English and an original

..and one copy in Spanish.

1wo sots of the one table and the six

charts that support the study are also being forwarded each

addressee.

This is an AlSCROlL prepared study; the author is

ArRanEl in collaboration with AlSinE-1. It

was prepared in

response to references A and B.

We have limited this study to an attempt to provo

statistically the very rapid rise of Cuban economic dependency

upon the Soviet Union.

We have intentionally avoided editorial

Izing as the facts speak for

themselves; thus we have drawn no

political conclusions, nor have we attempted to establish that

this econome dependency carries with it an implicit policy

control on the part of the Soviets (partly because policy control

does not necessarily follow and, in any event, the reader is free

to draw his own conclusions).

3.

we suggest that ANSCROLL - a JINAVE asset that studies

comments upon the Cuban economic scene-reproduce this study

under its name for private distribution to its list of sugar bro-

kers, trading firns, and international organizations that deal

ECONCHIC RELATIONS BETSEEN

CUBA AND THE SOVIST UNION:

HOW MUCH DEPENDENCY?

•..:

Cuba's dependency on

the Soviet Union is known. The auestion is: how much de-

pendency? In order to arrive

at some conclusion we have chosen Cuba's foreign trade

statistics for the 1959-1966 period.

We will work under the following economic assumption: Econonic dependency of one

country on the other can be indicated to a considerable extent by their trade as this

• Indicates the need one country has of the other as a market for its exports and as

a supplier for its imports.

What we will do 1s to analyze the Cuban Trade Balance for the 1959-1966 period. «

1) According to the assumption we established regarding trade dependency, we can

say that during 1959 Cuba

was dependent upon the Free World for its markets as total

" trade value for that year amounted to $ 1, 305,700, 000 and trade value with the Free

World represented $ 1,289,000,000 (os 98.8% of the total trade).

Broken down into exports and imports we see that in 1959 Cubani exports totaled

$ 637,700,000 while total imports were $ 688,000,000. Thus, the trade balance showed

a $ 26,500,000 deficit, which was a reflection of the trend started in 1958 due to

* Every figure in this paper will be given in U.S. dollars unless otherwise

indicated. The sources for the figures used throughout the analysis, the

•table, and charts were, "The Economist", "The New York Times", UN's Econo

mic Reports on Latin America, "Cuba Comercio Exterior" magazine, "Visión"

magazine, "IS News & World Report", and The Economist Intelligence Unit's

"Quarterly Economic Review".

It should be remembered that the figures refer only to the Cuban Trade Ba

.."lance, loe., imports and exports, and not to the Cuban Balance of Payments

which would reflect loans and financial arrangements, plus the Soviet mili-

tary and techical assistance, figures which do not appear in the balance of

trade and which are not available to us with sufficient authenticity to war

rant their use.

the unstable political situation under the Batista regine and the ecunomic insecurity

of the new Castro regire.

Of the above mentioned exports, 97.8% were to Free World countries and only 2.2%

to Cormunist countries, 'Impost-wise, 99.96, were wade from Free Morld countries, while

0.1% mere made from Communist countries.

Thes, re can conclude that Cuba was attti very much dependent upon the Free Morld

as rade wling rautina 1959, Further, at least S 623, 800,000 (97.8% of total exports)

was collected in hard currency.

2) In 1960, Anastas Mikoyan visited Cuba and the Cuban-Soviet trade agreement mas

signed. The effect of this agreement is immediately apparent when viewed through Cu-

ba's forelgn trade figures.

deceased

Total trade value decreased in 1960 to S 1,168, 000,000 from $ 1, 305,700,000. Free

World participation decreased more than proportionately, do the value of Cuban trade

with the Free World was $ 897,000,000, while trade with Communist countries increased

in 2:2 7 272000,000

for 23.3% of total trade) versus $ 1, 269,900, 000 and $ 15,800,000

respectively in 1959.

The trade balance was in favor of Cuba in the amount of $ 68,000,000 as control

of imports, especially from the Free World, established in 1959 was having its effect.

3) In 1961 the whole foreign trade picture was transformed. It was almost the

reverse of 1960. Total trade amounted to $ 1,253,600,000, of which Free World parti-

cipation represented $ 348,600,000 (or 27.8%) and Communist trade $ 905,000, 000 (05

72.276).

We can look 'at this another way. In 1960, Cuban exports earned $ 467,000,000 in

hard currency. In 1961, the hard currency earnings amourted to $ 166,800,000 since the

$ 458,100,000 value of Cuban exports to the Communist, countrtes represented "agreement

value" or "nomihal hard currency value" as the trade was conducted under barter agree-

ments, with the Soviet Union providing about 10% to 20% ofthe total Cuban export value

in convertible currency.

Cuba was now dependent, economically, upon the Communist Horld, especially the

Soviet Union. The fact that little hard currency was obtained from its new trade part

ners further commijed Cuba"s sconomy to the Communist Bloc.)

4) In 1962, the trend continued, Total trade was $ 1, 257, 000,000, of which

$ 1,031,000,000 (82.1%) was with the Communist Bloc and only $ 226,000,000 (17.9%)

with Free World countries.

Another phenomenon appeared during 1962. The Soviets, who had been carefui

not

to press Cuba during 1960 with regards to their trade balance (which was favorable to

Cuba by $ 31,000, 000), were shrewd enough to close the gap during 1961. The balance

was favorable to Cuba by $ 11, 200,000. 3

Clearly, the Soviet pressure was on. In 1962, Cuba faced a $ 227,000,000 deficit

with the Cormunist countries. Comoounding this is the fact that by 1962 Cuba had spent

30.6% of its hard currency reserves in Free World markets.

Dependency upon the Soviet Union arrived to stay as trade with the Communist World

represented 82.1% of total trade and imports from the Comnunist area had, for the first

time, surp as sed Cuban exports to the Bloc.

5) Two interesting developments occured in 1963. First of all, total trade with

the Communist countries maintained the 1962 level ($ 1,031,000,000 in 1962 and

$ 1,054, 900,000 in 1963). But, the Soviet Union tightened the grip by increasing its

exports :to Cuba to $ 689, 900,000 (in 1962 they represented $ 629,000, 000), while Cuban

exports to

the Communist Bloc decreased to $ 366, 000, 000 (in 1962 they represented

$ 402,000,000) Thus, the imbalance for Cuba increased to $ 322, 900,000 (in 1962 1t

was $ 227,000,000)

i recoup in

At the same time, Cuba attempted an approach to the Free World markets by taking

advantage of an increase in the price of sugar in the world market (sugar averaged

8.48 cts: per pound during this period). Cuba's total trade with the Free World in -

creased to $ 354,300,000 (in 1962 it had been $ 226,000,000).

Cuban

Nevertheless, the 1963,trade balance worsened for Cuba as it showed a $ 323,200,000

deficit. -The Free-Horto ccuntries were able to turn the tables on Cuba (as in 1962

defect eith the Free would,

6) For 1964, a favorahle world sugar market (average price of 5.86 cts. per pound)

encouraged

•Cuba to continue its flirtation with the Free Vorld. The Cuban treasury

was able to handle some hard currency for the first time in the Castro era and Cuban

cormercial missions were sent to Europe and Japan to purchase items no longer available

in Cuba.

Total trade increased to $ 1,722, 000,000 and the Free Morld participation Increased

fom $ 354,300,000 (25.28) 1n 1963 to $ 612,000,000 (35.6%). The Free Morld spending

spree took Its toll as the trade balance with the Free World showed a s 30,000,000 de-

ficit for Cuba. And here, we are speaking of a hard currency loss.

Not even in the midst of Cuba's affair with the Free World did the Soviet Union

Lose

toose control of the situation. On January 20, 1964, Cuba was signing a trade agree-

ment with the Soviet Union by which it was commiting about half of its planned future

_ sugar production to the Soviet Union for the next six years. The amounts Cuba agreed

to deliver to the Soviet Union were: 2,100,000 metric tons in 1965, 3,000,000 in 1866;

4, 000,000 1л 19678 4,000,000 in 1968, 5,000,000 in 19698 and 5,000,000 in 1970. The

Soviet Union did agree to fix the price of Cuba's sugar at 6 cts. per pound, which

perhaps seems generous in 1967, but hardly a good offer on January 20, 1964, as the

price of sugar on January 19, 1964 was 9.50 cts. per pound. Adding insult to injury

the Soviet Union did not include in the 1964 trade agreement its previous conritment

to provide Cuba with 10% of 20% of the payments in hard currency as it had done in the

1960 agreement.

had less.

Total trade amounted to $ 1,551,000,000 (compared to § 1,410,200,000 in

1963), but trade with Communist countries reached $ 1,195,000,000 (compared to

$ 1,054,900,000 1n 1963). Trade with the Free Yorld remained at the same level

= $ 354,300,000 in 1963 and $ 356,000,100 in 1915, but sith a difference - the Cur

ban deficit in its trade balance with the Free World rose from $ 300,000 in 1963 to

$ 60,000,000 1n 1965.

So, the Soviets continued in control as trade riith the Communist countries re-

presented more than three quarters of Cuba's total trade for that year. The sugar

production had already been mortgaged, the sugar market was depressed, and Cuba was

more and more dependent upon the Soviet Union.

8) Then came 1966. Sugas prices decreased to an average of 1.86 cts. per poundo

Total trade decreased to $ 1,465,000, 100 as compared with $ 1,551,000,000 in 1965.

so i Trade with Communist countries also decreased (from $ 1,195,000,000 in 1965 to

$ 1,160,000,000 in 1966) and the Sovietswere able to rush a little further and in -

creased Cuba's deficit in the trade balance from $ 119,000,000 in 1965 to $ 200,000,000

In 1966.

Free Morid countries also gained. Total Free Vorld trade decreased to $ 305,000, 000

(from $ 356,000,000 in 1965), but the Cuban deficit increased from $ 60,000,000 in

1965 to $ 65,000,000 in 1966.

Our conclusions follow:

FIRST: Cuba is economically dependent upon the Soviet Union.

SECCD : This dependency is increasing. It has risen from 1.2% in 1959 to 79.2%

by 1966.

To buttress this conclusion de voint out that:

• A) Cuba has mortgaged 'Its sugar production to the Soviet Union.

B) Cuba has exhausted its hard currency reserves.. While an exact fid

is

not available we estimated it to be about $ 20,000, 000, in December 1964.

C) Cuba does not receive hard currency from its trade with the Conmunist

countries under the present barter agreements.

D) Cuba has a $ 1,132, 000,000 trade deficit with the Communist countries

for the 1963 - 1966 period. Nor does this figure include Communist technical assis-

tance, military eguladent, scholarships, and the like.

THIRD: Cuba has lost its position at a meaningful trader in the Free World, which

in turn has increased Its dependency upon the Soviet, Union.

Progress In

obtalning the necessary U.8. Coast Guard certification 18 8109

and of the four that applied for this during the previous quarter

only two had received the certificationb the end of the current

The Station concurred with AMASE-l that he accapt. for

(1) The Aukior position is uot permanent, (2)

(3) this position should solve AlASt-l's personal financial prob-

JOES, and (4) AMASK-l has agreed to remain as chairman of AMKNOT

AMPOLISH-1 is presently employed by a local autonobile

this activity for the quarter was

$825.00.

The allotment for

$3, 000.00.

C. PROBLEMS

6.

The chief probles of the period was caused by the antics

of Raul QUINTANA Ruiz who jumped ship in New Orleans after a run-

In with the ship's captain and after difficulties with the Immi-

gration and Naturalization Service over the lack of proper documen-

tation to re-enter the country.

QUINTANA has been resettled in

Callfornia, though we may not have heard the last from him; AMASk-1

recently received a letter from QUINTANA which said that CUINTANA

was about to sue the sipping line that had employed him for back

salary and loss of personal effects that QUINTANA claims the captain

had locked up.

AHASK-1 was advised to ignore the letter in view

of the difficulties already caused and in vier of his potential for

further trouble (see paragraphs 2 and 3 of JMWAVE-3890).

B. ADMINISTRATIVE

During the soconi quarter of FY 67 the AMLIRA organizatlon

expended $17,300 and had income of some $600 from news stand sales

and advertising.

Both these figures are approximate projections

because the final December figures are not recorded at this

writing.

The net figure for expenditures during the quarter (some

$18,700) exceeds the budgeted amount by approzimately $400.

However,

th1s overage will be absorbed in further budgetary cutbacks during

tha noxt reporting period.

6. Tho AMLIRA activity expenditures also exceeded the budget

allowance during the luat quarter.

To renedy this situation the

f01l081ng specific economy measures vill go into effect beginning

during the second quarter of liool there were expendi

tures of approximately $19,000 by the AuSTrut-? activity.

This

figure includes an estimate for the month of December because

budgeted anount for AUSTRUI-? for the quarter 18

the 11n; furer he not be a recalved at this 54, 00d and tere

18 an excess of budget authorization over expenditures of approxi-

mately $5000.

This figure, however, gives an unreel budgetary

picture of the AuSTRUT-& activity.

This $5000 w111 remain as a

pert of the budget allotnent and may well be expended ln a fluiry

01 AHSTRUT-2 travel, publication activity andor promotion during

• tha next quarter.

In other wordo the excess does not repregent

budget. "fat" since the bulk of toe AHSTRUT-2 expenses are not

figured an month to month constants but obligatod au the operational

situatlen demands.

6. During December AHSTRUT-2 moved into a smaller house eith

• lover rent which viii mean a saving of $100 per month.

addition, it 18 anticipated that a further saving sill be realiged

1n nintenance and upkeep costs.

C. PROBLENS

7.

The basic agent-handling problem presented by AMSTRUT-?'s

excessive generosity and understandable

nercurial disponition' the role which must be played before the pui-

enotional approach to

11c st11l exists.

However, It seems to have lessened somewhat as

AHSTRUT-2 gRing confidence

in the language and in dealings sith the

public.

There 1s little question that a contributing factor to the

lesgening of this problem is the reliance placed by AMSTRUT-2 on

AMLYRIC-] Who serves an business aduisor, buffer and hand-holder.

B.

The problen of projecting the image of the AMSTRUT-2 Pounda-

tIon as an independent charitable organization remains.

The appli-

cation for tax exempt status to the state of registry ig in the worke

and when this application 18 approved 1t 1a 1lkely

that there will be

an Increase of private donations which, because of the new status, will

be tax deductible.

The problem iles in the dilatory bebarior of the

stato authorities.

D.

AHSTRUT-2 continues to be attractive to certain extremiat

polfticsi groups whose patriotic claims of objectives rould often

appear to parallel those of AMSTRUT-? and the Cuban exile community

aB a whole.

AKSTRUT-2 has not always been able to sort out the "good

and the problem lies in fending off these

extremiat groups and preventing then fron exploiting AMSTRUT-2 for

partisan political elás.

D. PLANS POR NEXT QUARTER

10. AMLYRIC-1 has been in negotiation with a group of

organizations at Harvard Univeraity which wish to sponsor an

AMSTRUT-2 appearance there.

The tentative plan at this uriting

1S fOr AMSTRUT-? to appear during the first part of calendar

1867.

The ghost-written Alstrule? book on antilor, should be

ready for tirat reading at least sometime during the next quarter.

18. It 1a planned to have AuSTRUT-¿ prepare a rebuttal

(probably, to be ghoat-written by ANLYRIC-1) to the interview with

Fidel CASTRO which appeared in the January jesue of Playboy maga-

z10€.

13. Further speaking engagements and tours by AlSTRUT-2 are

beine planned for the next reporting period.

It 18 also planned

it is well known that all countries that import of produce sugar are makin

critical situation in the world market of over-supply and low price.

Castro's stand to that respect has

been to boycott and undermine such efforte.

This has been clearly reflected 1n Castro's refusal to participate in the

various

work groups that have been created for that purpose under the aponsor

ship of the Secretary General of UNCTAD, Dr. Raúl Prebish.

Castro belleves that by not participeting in efforts to reach a

producer countries in order to bring econonic hardship to those countries 1n Ia-

tin America to which sugar exporte are important.

The régime has beez committed by Castro to produce 10,000,000 tons of sugar

which figure sugar economists in and out of lube agree is nost unlikely.

However, the attempt to reich this goal is resulting in activities that amount

to econonde suicido.

Cuba is buying generators in England costing more than uno

dillon dollars which will be used to provide power for the "Centros de Acoplo"

(reception centers).

The concept of these centers was tried many years ago in

Cuba and discarded as both inefficient and uneconomical. There is no reason to

believe that anything has happened that will change this. So, what to do with

the generators?

The INni polley. of vory low prices paid and lack

of incentives given to the most efficient producers has forced the producers to

diver't their lands to less rigky and more profitable crops.

This is particular-

: 1. A result of QUSPOT-2's recent holiday in the JMWAVE area has

beon

to establish a correspondence betwèen him and AUFRAME-1, the

signor of the Suplemento Especial of the AUSCROLL Economic Bureau, a

copy of which is forwarded by separate cover.

QUSPOT-2 has indicated:

that ho could use AMSCROLL economic studies

and that he could arrange

for publication of at least some

of these in

Identity A.

He suggested

that the original of such publications be sent to Identity B with a

copy to him.

This was done in the case oì a

recent economic report

which was

shortly thereafter published in Identity A.

QUSPOT-2 air-

malled this story to AMFRAME-l which arrived at about the

same time

as the copy the Madrid Station airmailed to the JutAŸr overt address.

We wish that the article being formarded by separate cover

be surfaced in Identity A.

The original has been airmailed

Idontity B with a copy to QUSPOT-2 per QUSPOT-2's suzgestion.

JMWAVE

fools that this is a useful mechanism and unless advised to the

contrary we propose to forward additional AUSCROLL studies to Identity. B

for publication in Identity A.

Should Madrid prefer se,

of course, can

in the tuture forward such articles directir to the Station lor

placoment instead of airmailing them to Identity B.

Studies similar to the one being

forwarded are regularly

prepared in English on a number of economic subjects.

They are

distributed to shipping firms, certain banks engaged

in international

commerce, international trade

organizations, international commodity

houses,

They are translated into Spanish solely for use in

Identity A; thus, in this sense, these reports are an "exclusive"..

ECONOMICAS DE UNIDAD REVOLUCIONARIA.-

LA CALIDAD ACTUAL DEL AZUCAR CUBANO

Por el Ingeniero Raúl Esparza Tabares

ex-Director de Investigaciones Tecno-

16gicas del Ministerio del Azúcar (MINAZ) de Cuba Comunista

Este breve análisis de la calidad actual del azúcar cubano va dirigido tanto al

perito en azúcares (como paso inicial de lo que podría convertirse en un estudio mas

técnico y exhaustivo) cono al lectos ordinario, toda vez que, en Cuba, el azúcar

• casi sinónimo

de rrosperidad económica, y así, la calidad del azúcar desempeña un pa

pel de gran importancia

en la situación econónica global del país (1).

Sin mas comentarlos o notas de introducción, ofrecemos à continuación el análio

sis de la calidad actual del azúcar cubanos

1.- Materias. Extrañass

a) Azúcar crudor la Industria azucarera cubana

se caracterizaba por recibir pa-

ra su procesamiento, la mejor calidad de caña de azúcar en cuanto a su contenido de-

materlas extrañas (menos del 3%): Actualmente y por causa de los trabajadores "vo-

luntarlos" por un lado y por otro a la mecanización de la cosecha de la caña, las ma.

terias extrañas que acompañan a la caña al llegar al Central para su procesamiento

ha aumentado al 8% en el caso de los voluntarios y al 19% en el caso de las máquinas

de cortar caña soviéticas. Es: de. señalarse que dentro de la composición de estas ma

terias extrañas está incuida la tierra, y como quiera que las tierras de Cuba tienen

en su comnosición un alto contenido de arcillas, estas son muy difíciles de eliminar

en el procesó tecnológico de purificación y afectan grandemente la calidad del azú -

car crudo.

b) Azúcar Refinor Las materias extrañas, principalmente arcillas de las tierras

llegan hasta el azúcar refino dándole color al mismo y dejando residuos insolubles

al ser disueltas esta azúcar. 'Esto disminuye la calidad del azúcar refino no sola -

mente para el consumo humano direçto;

siro que ocasiona graves perjuicios en las in-

dustrias de alimentos que utilizan el azúcai refino. Lo mismo sucede con las indus-

trias de refrescos.

(1) No es necesario ensalzar la calidad del azúcar cubano que producía antes de

castro, ya que su prestigio en el mercado mundial es un hecho de sobra cong

cido.

Lo mismo puede decfrse de los técnicos cubanos en azúcar, con quie -

nes los expertos intenacionales han tenido amplia oportunidad de discutir

los actino ano artico e intercamb Coles y sugerencias Ibremonto. Esta

situación ya no existe.

2.- Polarización,

a) Azúcar crudo, En éroças anteriores al ségimen comunista, Cuba no producía azú-

cares crudos con polarizaciones menores de 97.0 a 97:5%, y para muchos mercados

tranjeros se enlucían azúcares crudos con polarizaciones superlores a 98.0%.

En 1a

actualidad un perelento significativo de la producción no alcanza esos valores, dán:

dose cásos de azúcaros crudos con polarizaciones de 96.0 y 95.0 Do

en los mercados internac lonales principalmento por su grado de polarización, la

deberá ser como mínimo 99.9%. Los azúcares refinos en la actualidad bajo el régimep-

comunista no alcanzan esa cifra, manteniéndose entro 99.70 y 99.80 %.

b) Azúcar Refino, La deficiente tecnología y el mal estado de los equipos apropla

b) Azúcar Refing, El uso de azúcares crudos de baja calidad, la deficiente calidad

viados por los paisas comunistas, han tenido como consecuencla un aumento del porcenta

6.- Problemas Específicos del Azúcar Crudgs

a) Filtrabilidad, El Indico de filtrabilidad que mide las propledados precisamento

de refinación del azúcar crudo, ha bajado en un 250% en los años recientes, afectando

serlamente los costos de producción de las refinerías que emplean este azúcas erudo es

mo materia prima.

b) Unsformidad dol erano de Azúcar,. Como consecuencia de la total ausencia de o -

quinos automíticos para contrôlar la cristalización del azúcar, ya que la gran mayosía

ha aldo destruido y no reparado, la uniformidad de los cristales o granos del azúcar -

crudo ha disminuido a líderes inverosímiles.

Es casi imposible observar azúcares cru-

como las calidades de las aguas que se emplean para el lava-

do de los azúcares en las centrífugas, al poco culdado y esmero con que son tratadas-

en los almacenes, han producido un descenso en cuanto al aspecto sanitario de los azú

cares acusándose un aumento considerable en el contenido de hongos, bacterias, y lova

duras.

Todos estos elementos extraños afectan la calidad y producen fermentaciones

secundarias en el azúcar destruyéndose parte de la sacarosa de las mismas, lo cual,r9

duce los rendimientos en las refinerías de azúcar y aumenta considerablemento el cos-

to de producción.

d) Envaseas Los envases que viene utilizando el régimen comunista en los azúca -

ses crudós, son en parte elaborados en la Unión Soviética.

Estos envases de yute son

de Infima calidad y además como no tleren las medidas standards, el azúcar se compac-

ta dentro de los sacos, producléndose muchas roturas de los mismos.

e) Azúcar Endurecida, Como consecuercia de la deficiencia en la tecnología de --

producción,

las materias extrañas, y las malas condiciones de los almacenes, el indlo

ce de azúcares endurecidos en almacenamiento ha aumentado casi un 200%.

como consecuencia grandes dificultades en las refinerías al disolver al azúcar y sa -

carla de los sacos, Además. al aumentar el costo de manipulación, se aumenta el cos-

•¿ to de producción.

7. - Problemas Específicos del Azúcar Refinge

a) Azúcares Iovertidos1 Debido a la deficiencia tecnológica y a la baja calidad -

de los azúcares crudos utilizados, el contenido de azúcares Invertidos ha aumentado

un 150% en los últimos años con el resultado de la baja de calidad de esta tipo de azy

caro

b) Cenizas, Como consecuencia de la gran cantidad de materias extrañas y la baja -

calidad de los azúcares crudos, así como la deficiente calidad de los Carbones Activa-

dos empleados en las refinerías, el contenido de cenizas ha'aumentado en los últimos -

años en un 50%, afectando la calidad de estos azúcares.

e) Contenido de Plomo, La presencla de Plomo en los azúcares refinados debe sor •

slanificativo, nto en los últimos años el empleo de Tlerras de Infusorios y Acido Fos

mento, ha roducido un aumento del contenido de plomo en los azúcares sofinos de un

J0% sobre los valores normales.

sin embargo al usarse los, productos contaminados y de baja calidad suministrao

'nen partes de Cóbre, han dado como resultado un aumento en el contenido de Cobre 118=

gándose a obtener valores de 2 a 3% de Cobre en al azúcar rofino.

CONCLISIONES 1

1.-.Bajo el presente régimen, la calidad del azúcar cubano ha sufrido un tremana,

do deterioro.

2.- La Industrla azucarerá cubana no ha sido una éxcepción al principio de que

"el Comunismo es sinónimo de baja calidad".

3.- Los goblernos, los pueblos y las firmas de 108 países queaún adquieron azú

car de Cuba deben tomar nota do osto breve análisis.

My name 1s Raul de la Rús Castro, and I was the Chief Engineer atoard the Cuban MV

Working conditions in

the Cuban Merchant: Fleet also influenced my decision.

stand the intensified espionage on board by menkers of the G-2.

It is

worth mentioning that the plan to indoctrinate Cuban nerchant crews was a complete

regine has abardoned the project altogether,

and is now trying to

place loyal Communists as officers and crownembers, even if they are not qualified

for their Jobs..

As a matter of fact, the lack of qualified personnel is an increasing problem, and

another source of trouble aboard Cuban vesséls.

During, the last months a total of

twenty nine officials,

officers and crewmembers of the Cuban Merchant Marino have

defected (data of up-to-date merchant marine score). After I quit the SIERRA MAES

for instance, there

was not a single certified enginesr on board, although

there woro several young feiiows getting on the job training.

This is a fact that

should be taken into consideration by the Insurance firus that underwrito Cuban

Most of the vessels are faced with all sorts of mechanical sifficulties, due to

lack of spare parts and a very faulty sintainanco, situation tkat gets worse when

consider the scarcity of qualified personnel just mentioned.

happy to have joined those of my fellow Cuban officers who preceded me

in this decision.

I wish to thank the "free Cuban Merchant Farine Committes" for

all the attentions accorded me, and I hope to rejoin our merchant fleet soon, when

our vessels again sail inder the flag of a free country.

cargo do Director de Investigaciones Tecnológicas Arucareras del MINAZ y formaba

parte de la "Comisión de Estudlos del Plan Perspectivo Azucarero".

A mí lado se encuentra ni señora Josafa Reus y nuestros hijos Roberto, de 21

años y Raúl, de 22 años, arbos estudiantes do ingeniería de la Universidad de La

Hahang.

Antes de hacer un brevo relato de la odisea de ni familia para abandonar el

país, deseo agradecer a los compañeros de UNIDAD REVOLUCIONARIA las atenciones

que han tenido para con nosotros y al mismo tlempo por darme esta oportunidad de

hacer estos doclaraciones a los periodistas del mundo libre.

Dosdo hace dos años todos nos encontrabamos tratando de abandonas el país po-

so nos había sido imposible, a mi no se se permitía salir debido al cargo que ocy

cetr

paba y ni siquiera se le dabs esta oportunidad al resto de mi familia, Cuando lo

de Camarloca nos fué a recoger un barco y las autoridades cubanas ni nos avisaron

de que dicha embarcación se encontraha allí. La unica salida era abandonar el país

en bote nor la vía clandestina, La oportunidad se presentó durante mi estancia en

Londreso Yo había salido de Cuba el 23 de febrero de 1946 dejando atrás a mi seño

ra y a mis dos hijos, uno de los cualos, Raúl, se encontrata enfermo de hepatitio.

en La Habana.

MS señora tuvo que torar la decisión sin encontrarme yo a su lado, pero había

que aprovechar la oportunidad que se presentaba y salir por la vía clandestina del

naís. De la odisea puoden dar detalles ellos mucho mejor oro yo y posiblemento los

miembros de la prensa desearán hacerles algunas preguntas al final de mis palabras.

Muy brevemente los diré que ellos se sometleron al mismo proceso que tantos -

otros cubanos se han sometido, es decir, lanzarse en bote a sruzar el "corredor de

la muerte" con la

conflanza que Dios los ayudaría a arribar a tierras de libertado

Dos intentos fallaron pero por fin, el tercer intento fué un éxito y al menos el

grupo completo, unas veinte personas, se montaron en el bote y pusieron proa a los

Estados Unidos, el motor se rompló y la travesía fué la mayos parte del tlempo a

prés en solia Patallrecoiolio coure di luyas. y rarcaba el sitio faro facilitarle

-la tarea-a una de sus unidados navales que ya se encontraba en camino. -

La llegada del buque del Servicio de Cunscarostas Norteamericano fué real -

rente prividencial, pues mi familia y los otros tripulantes. del bote observaban

aterrorizados como por la nopa de acercaba velozmente una lancha patrullera cuba-

na, que al ver el buque norteamericano viró en redondo y regresó a Cuba.

Yo mo encontraba en el hotel en Londres y una llamada de larga distancia me

puso al corriente de la situación. Ellos so encontraban a salvo y ahora me toca-

Da el turno a mí.

Lallamada Informándome del arribo de mi familla: a 109 EE. IN. llegó procisa-

mente cuando me encontraba rounido con el resto de los miembros de la Delegación.

Estos me observaban atentamento, como querlerso adivinar lo que se no decía des-

de el otro lado de

la línea. Por tanto, tuve que desplegar mis escasas dotes

de

actor teatral y simular que la llamada era oficial. desde cubo.

Anto esta situación, optó por informas, falsamente, a los rostantes deiega-

dos que el gobierno cubano me había encargado el cuidado de otros asuntos, por

lo que tendría que demorarme algunos días mas de los previstos en Madrid.

Los dije también que me reservaran pasaja a bordo del vuelo de la semana si

quiento y les entregué una carta para mi familia, Llegué a Madrid el a de Mar-

20. Las autoridades españolas me brindaron toda clase de facilidades, incluso

posteriormente la de ofrecerme hasta protección personal, puesto que cuando en el.

MINAZ se conoció mil desaparición, el gobierno notificó a las embajadas cubanas en

Londres y Madrid que me encontraran y que ne llevaran de regreso para La Habana

aunque tuviera que ser a bordo de un buque cubano y por supuesto, en contra de mi

voluntado

- No deseo tomar mas tiempo para anécdotas personales y si lo he hecho ha s1-

do porque estimo que ayudan a comprender la verdadera situación que se vivo en

Cuba, La situación de los funcionarios que como en mi caso, desean la libertad

de nuestra Patria, y que nos encontramos sujetos a vigilancia, a represión, mis

hijos expulsados de la Universidad y sujetos a las mismas privaciones que el res

to de nuestro Pueblo.

Pasemos ahora al tena principal de esta conferencia, que es a la vez la es

pina dorsal de la economía cubana y por tanto el fastor determinante de la es -

En relación con el estado de la industria azucarera en la actualidad es no-

cesarlo comenzar por esbozar la situación en la dia se induit-su isa luirlos.

-Debido-a-la-escasez-deniezas.derepuestc._la.falta de materiales.y la baja call

dad del trabajo, los ingentos confrontan una situación que es necesario callfi ..

car de "caótica". La falta de personal técnico capacitado y de obreros especia-

lizados hacen que la operación de producción de los ingenlos sea altamente deflo

clente. Por otra parte, la falta de abastecimiento de caña no permite que los in

génios funcionen a su capacidad normal, trayendo como consecuencia poca eficien-

cia en el trabajo y un alto consumo de combustible adicional, que ocasiona un ay

mento considerable en los costos de producción del azúcar. En relación con los

medios de transporte, incipalmente los ferrocarriles azucareros, deseamos acla

ras que se encuentran también en pésimas condiciones, a pesar de la adquisición

de locomotoras souléticas, inglesas y francesas, pues las vías férreas no permi-

ten el aprovechamiento de este material rodante. Por ejemplo, durante 1965 se

debían de haber cambiado seis millones de travlesas en las vías férreas, mas sin

embargo sólo había diponiblos ochenta mil. El resultado es el Incremento de 108

descarrilamientos que durante la zafra de 1965 alcanzaron un promedio de tres des

carrilamientos diarios, produciéndose diez accidentes mortales.

Muchos me preguntan cual será la producción final de la zafra de 1966 y so -

bre este punto debo haces los comentarlos siguientes, Fidel Castro anuncló que

la meta azucarera de este año serían 6.5 millones de toneladas y ese anuncio no

sólo fue hecho durante su discurso del Iro, de mayo de 1965, sino que lo repitió

durante su discurso del 7 de Junio del mismo año. Sin embargo, se admite que di

cha meta no será alcanzada. Ahora bien el estimado actual no excede de 5.1 mi-

1lones de toneladas.

¿Por qué?

Primeramente se debe mencionas la falta de abono. Este año la aplicación

.do abono fue insignificante, pues el gobierno no tenía las divisas necasarias pa-.

sa adquirirlo, principalmente en Italia. El año pasado, sin embargo, se aplica-

son aproximadamente 150,000 toneladas.

En segundo lugar, resulta necesarlo hacer referencla à las sombras de caña.

Las nuevas areas sembradas de caña lo han sido de forma deficiente y además se han

utilizado areas destinadas con anterioridad a la siembra de otras cosechas para.

sembrar caña, como lo constituye, Dor sólo citar un ojemplo, el caso de la zona

situada en los alrededores de Manzanillo y Bayamo, las cuales eran zonas arroco •

ras y ahora han intentado convertirlas en zonas cañoras, resultando todo esto en

un fracaso pues la caña es de baja calidad al no ser adecuado el suelo.. Otro fas

tor menos importante pero digno de darse a conocer es la falta de cuidado en las

tareas de cultivo y atención de los cañaverales debido a la escasez de mano de 9

bra.

Con estos antecedentes es que hay que analizar el monto de la presente zafra.

Durante 1965 el día 7 de abril se alcanzó el cuarto millón, pero este año el ter-.

cer millón se alcanzó el día 3 de abril lo cual ya significa un atraso de cerca

de 900,000 toneladas. Creo que hay caña para llegar a 5.1 millones de toneladas

ahora bien, lo que hay que preguntarse es si dicha mota, que ya está bastanto por

dabajo de los 6.5 millones anunciados por Fidel Castro será alcanzada o no. El

Partido está realizando una movilización masiva record hacia los cañaverales con

el propósito de intentar cortar toda. la caña pero eso hay que ver si en defini-

tiva lo bgran hacer.

Cabe hacer referencia en este momento a lo que se conoce en Cuba por el nom

bre de "'pian Perspectivo Azucarero", que es el único plan económico que tiene en

estos momentos el gobierno de Cuba..

¿Qué es el "Plan Perspectivo Azucarero"? comprendo tres puntos básicos que

son los siguientes, primero, la "rehabilitación" de la capacidad industrial a ni

veles pre-Castros segundo, la "ampliación" de la capacidad industrial, y tercero,

la "concentración" de la industria azucarera en 70 modernos centrales.

Vamos a revisar brevemente los tres puntos a la luz de la presente situación.

En relación con el primero, o sea, la "rehabilitación" de la capacidad Industrial.

Instalada, es necesario destacar que en 1952 la capacidad de producción de la in

dustria azucarera era de siete millones de toneladas, pero debido a la escasez

de piezas de repuesto, falta de materiales para las reparaciones, baja calidad de

las reparaciones y la eliminación de seis ingenios - que fueron precisamente des

mantelados para utilizar las plezas como repuestos lo cual se ha comprobado ha si

do un error más - la capacidad industrial se ha reducido a sólo seis millones de

toneladas, es decir, que la actual política ha resultado en la prosente merma de

la producción ¡qué progreso! Fidel Castro no ha podido ni alcanzar la capaci -

dal de reducción azucarera nue Cuta tenía hace ruince años.

El segundo punto, que en cierto sentido debe atennerarse al primero, es am--

pilar la capacidad industrial instalada y además construir un nuevo ingenio. Esto

significaría, o sea, dara alcanzar esto sería necesario la importación de un núme

maro considerable de enuipos-para los incentos, cosa totalmente impositte de tle-

varse a cabo debido a la escasez de divisas -de por sí escasas para la adquisición

de olezas de repuesto- y la falta de técnicos para hacerse cargo de surervisar y

ejecutar dicha ampliación - tanbién se dete decis que tampoco son suficientes los

técnicos para realizar de por sí las labores ordinarias de la zafra con la actual

capacidad. Este parte del plan supone una coordinación entre el INRA - que stei.

bra la caña - y el-MiNAZ, pero lo oue sucede en la realidad es que no están;en

coordinación ambos organismos y por consiguiente el INRA manda a sembrar caña en

donde no existe canacidad industrial y por su parte el MINAZ está "rehabilitando"

ingenios en donde a lo mejor ya no hay suficiente caña. Esto es sólo una muestra

de la desorganización reinante, desorganización que unida a los factores. menciona

dos imposibilitan el éxito del 'Plan Perspectivo". Esto es una prueba más de la

Incapacidad de la planificación econónica de las altas esferas en dicho gobierno.

(Por cierto que la construcción del nuevo ingenio es vital para el éxito del

"Plan" y hasta fil momento presente sílo una firma francesa ha hecho ofertas para

dicha construcción, dicha firma es nada menos que la FIVES-LILLE, bien conocida

en los círculos azucareros).

La. tercera fase del "plan", es decir, la "concentradón" de la capacidad in--

dustrial azucarera en setenta ingenios después de 1970 es sólo un sueño en la ven

te de los planificadores. La regresión constante de la

industria azucarera no

puede permitis, económicamente hablando, el modernizar y automatizar plantas y •

equipos, lasta que los problemas económicos básicos de la producción no estén re-

Bueltos.

Los equipos soviéticos no son aptos para realizar estas tareas agrícolas én -

Cuba y su diseño y diffcil operación impiden que cumplan su cometido. Adenás es-

tas "cortadoras" introducen un 19% de materias extrañas en el ingenio, lo cual --

ocasiona gran desgasto a las máquinas y equipos del ingenio. Y es precisarento -

con estos equipos soviéticos con los cuales se contaba para cosechar 83 millones

de toneladas de caña que serían necesarias para producir los 10 millones de tone-

ladas de azúcar anunciados por Fidel Castro como los "10 megatones de azúcar" con

los que iba a derrotar al "imperialismo" en 1970.

Las metas de producción del "Plan" son las siguientes, Para 1965: 6 millones

de toneladase para 1966, E.5 millones! para 1967: 7.5 millones- para 1968: 8 01--

Ilones: para 1969, 9 millones: y finalmente, para 1970: 10 millones de toneladas

"de azúcar." Estimo que el único en Cuba que aún creo en el "Plan" y en sus metas

es Fidel Castro.

Ne gustaría hacer una breve referencia en relación con otro problema básico

- la baja calidad del azúcar eubano, tanto crudo como refino, actualmente en proce

so de empeorarse. Esto no ha sucedido de casualidad sino como consecuencia de la

• falta y mala calidad de las piezas de repuesto, la ineficiencia en la operación de

los ingenios, la falta de eficiencia de los trabajadores, y la baja calidad de los

productos químicos auxiliares procedentes de países socialistas. Estos problemas

están resultando en una decreciente polarización del azúcar, el envase deficiento

del azúcar de exportación, el aumento de Impurezas en el azúcar embarcada a granel,

y las dificultades en cumplir los compromisos de entregas de azucares.

Otro tema de interés lo constituye la presencia de los "técnicos azucareros"

soviéticos en Cuba. El régimen cuenta en la actualidad con unos 300 técnicos azu-

careros soviéticos quienes se supone que sean los sustitutos de los técnicos cuba-

nos que han abandonado el. país. Los técnicos soviéticos tienen muy poca experien-

cla en azúcar de caña y la forma en que dicha industrla opera en Cuba. Además muy

pocos hablan español

y esto les hace aún más difícil su labor. Por lo tanto ni los

técnicos soviéticos ni los equipos soviéticos constituyen una solución para el que

bradero de cabeza azucarero de Fidel Castro.

Con esto deseo das por terminada estas declaraciones. Dejo ahora la palabra a

los miembros de la prensa para contestarles cualquier pregunta en relación, no so-

10 a mis palabras, sino a la situad ón política Interna que es un interesante fenó

meno de desintegración, la odisea de

má familia, el problema de la Universidad en

donde desempeñaba una cátedra, así como cualquier otro tema que resulte

de interés.

Huchas gracias.

Dear Frof. Gardlunds

I am pleased to enclose tha information that you requested

in your kind lottor of 5/5/66, which I hopo will be userul to you in your studies

of prico and cost trends in the enno sugar industry.

As you probably know, the curan surar industry ranked first

placo as a producor of eone sugar, not only with rogards to largo production vol-

unes, but also as concerns high technical officioney and low production costs.

Bofora 1959, the maximun production cost was of 3.5 cents a

pound, excopting, of course,

the smallor and moro inofficiont susar mills that

had not dovolopod any tochnologienl advanços sinco world war 11.

Howöver, in

1965 the cost of production was as high as 5.25 conts a pound, even though, of

course, this lattor figuro 18 carefully concealod by tho Communist régine that

rulos my country.

I would like to acquaint you with the Econonic Resoarch Bu

reau of the UNIDAD ReVOLUCIONARIA Moromont.

This organiantion is mado up of true

cuban oconomiato in exilo. I am suro that

you will find this a very valuablo

source of information concerning Cuba's economy.

I thank you very much for the kind and humane phrsses that

you havo had for my family and for myself.

Thank hoaven, aftor throa long years

va vore able to escapo, oven if at the risk of our own lives, from the Communist

holl. We have como to

this froe land in the hope that we can start our lives all

ovor again under the kind hospitality of this groat Nation, the free and denocrat

1c Untted Statos of America.

Ploase by assured, my dear Professor,, that I an pleasad to

place myself at your servico.

Should you desire any information concerning the

Cuban sugar industry, I will be nore than glad to furnish it to you.

I also

hope that, very soon, a rógimo of lihorty, justica and democratio econonio do

valopment will prevall in my suffering Fatherland.

The Station 1s nttempting

to improve both the punch and the

quality of these programs.

for example,

emphasis should be pinced upon bellov failures and uran the noodless

Furthor, we are trying to refine the

"Irritability"

factoi so far

as Castro and the regime are concerned due to the

sensitivity of Castro to

this type of attack.

Calling Castro (on

19

January) the "Soviets' barking hound dog" is a sally in this

direction.

As usual

with programs of this nature the size and reaction of

the audience

is most difficult to ascertain.

It is some comfort to be

able to record that during

"HABLA... VIIDAD FEVELICIONARIA" (i.P.U. Lo)

November Le 1965: "Thoro will bo no changer in thie Hlockndo of Rod Culin".- A comment

on tho runore that les. polley on Cubin will "softon". It is indicatud that Waching

ton, for humanitarian rensone, accopted Cretro's parle: to ovacuate the spiritually

wounded. We aleo comment on the etatement of a Washington official who caid that

"the foar that the U.i, may alter its rolntions with Cuba le unfoundod (and) there

1o no prospect for a chango in our relations".. We arrive at the conclunion that U.s.

policy on the subjoct will no vary: Cac'ro will ho oconomically atranclod and there

1s no future for Communiam 1n thie Continont.

"What About l'olitienl Priconcru?".- Fidol Gretro has trkon a norton of steps that

• limit, by sovernl morns, the offer ho mado to allow dissatisfied Cubrno to leave

the Island. Evon though no public statomonte have boen male shout the political

priconors, It may bo expocted that this matter has boon considorod in the nogotia-

tlone, and that Fidol Castro must be forcod to play fairly in ordor that he may not

trado with the ngony and the hope of 70,C00 political prisonors and with the hope

and the anguich of their relatives.

Novomber 3e 1965: "Burencrncy and Rod Tapo ern bo done away with".- A comment on

the 20-year torm Riven tho "Reeponcable" of "Colectivo" 17, of Regional 2-33 of the

Cuban Concolidated Enterprice of Grocery Storos, one Roborto Montes de Oca Ramos,

November 3, 1965: "How Abluct Can Castro Higl".- In his recent sintement to three

Amerioan and ono Spanish journaliste, Crotro appears arrorant and acte as though he

didn't care for an "agglornamonto' with the U.!. Howover, from the contest of hie

strtomonto it 1s quite obvious that he would liko nothing botter than boing re admit

"Roticense That Reynal Inaincuritye Caution and Fear",- At last, the Old Guard has

spoken out through Carlos Rafael Rodriguez, following the dovastatine "purge" that 1t

underwent in the hands of Fidel Castro. But foar of a second, bloody phaeo, of the

purge has kopt Carlos Rafaol Rodriguez from oponly attacking Fidol Cretro.. Instead,

he has taken resource to veiled reticence and references to Fidel Castro's "potty.

"clasries" of Marxien-Leninian still distruot Fidel. If their differences with the

"now wave" are really a thing of the past, why does Old-Guard man Carlos Rafpel now

bring up the fact that fidel was not one of them at the heginning, and that he was

not a true Marxist-Leninist?.

Novelaber 4u 1965: "The Renction to Camarlock: Chetro'e Resentment and Bitterners". -

Castro's vow to let disestisfied Cubane out was his own error of appreciation. Pres-

ident Johnson took the challenge and then Castro tried to sound out the U.f. for ca

axistentialist overtures.

Hence his rejection of the Red Cross to mediate in the

matter. His bitter reaction forbidding the departure from Camarioca chows

* November 9, 1965: "hat Goes Fron One Her. Ith to the Other". - We recall that on

Nov. 7, last jear, Castro was interviewed by a corres. ondent for the New York Tines.

At the same time, he said that he would down whatever American U-2 planes he could

military alliance with the U.....R.. Now, a year later; his heart hleeding over his

parting with Red China, an un'er brutal sovlct pressuri, Castro's Nov. 7 speech

inaugurating a hospital counts like that of a "conatructive" ruler whose concern 1s

for the wolfnre of the people, and who asks that elme people nto march up the (socia-

11st) path".

He is no longer arromnt. He belatedly begs for the people's support.

Wht About Latin American Corrunist Parties?".- Castro dismissed the fact that

Chin did not greet the roorminization and chango of the Cuhan Comunist iarty, but

spite and concern were obvious in the tone of his voice. Cas'ro knows that re has

botrayed Chinn. On the other hand, the Conmunist Parties of Latin America have not

addrorned Castro any conpratul-tory mesanges either, which indiestes that they are

beginning

to turn their backs on him on account of his "purging" of the old guard.

Under such conditions, Castro's subservience to Moscow is grenter every day. Castro

has entored the most unsurnountable phase of his crisis.

x November 10, 1905: "The Resson god Nature of the Economic Rlockede". - From Castro's

Nov. 7th speech it may be deductod that the U.s...R. has only been able to supply him

with weapone, bullets and cannons. We stato the reasons why the U.s...R. will not be

ablo to invest more in Cuba, and that, at the same time, the nations of this Hemisp-

here will continue their economic boycott of Castro's Cuha. There can he no economic

coexistence between Red Cubs and the rest of the Continent.

"Continental Resistance to Argression". - Even though the Llma meting of military

chiefe from 17 American countries did not trke up the question of the Inter-American

Army, the resembled chiefs unquestionably took a step towards its establishment, which

will be ultimately decided on by the 1.1.5. Aggression to the Dominican Re ublic,

and persistence in Cuba-drafted subversive plans against the rest of the Hemisphere,

urgently demand that adequate continental security plans he adopted in order to face

up to the threat and put an end to aggression.

November 11, 1965: "Coexletence Dreams Cone Tumbling, Down". - Therla: There can be no

coexistence botween Castro and the U.i. After Castro roturned from Moscow in 1963, and

under pressure from Krruchchoy, he bepan his first conciliatory overtures with the United

itates. Nikita had pleaded geographical and economic imposelbility to maintain his con

mitments with the Castro tyranny. Result: The Soviet Union cannot continually support

Castro and the V.í., on their part, rejectstastro-Communism. In face of this situation,

the men in the Cuban armed forces and in the government have only one dignified course

of action: to remove the despot. from power in order that. Cubs may emergo from chaos and

tragody.

"The O.A.S. Should Not Portpone Its Meeting", - The same Chetrolte agrression that.

cle breaks Cuban

deadly silence concerning Indonesian

events, and sulle

marizes and, comments such

events, emphasizing that the people and the

armed forces have performed the miracle of recovering democracy for Indo-

nesia. HISTORIC DETERMINISM turns against Communism, first in the Domin-

ican Republic, next in Algeria, now in Indonesia, and tchorrow in Cuba.

"Why Doesn't Fidel Talk of the Farty's Reorganization?". - Right after the

news on the reorganization of the Party were confirmed, Castro offered to

let all dissatisfied Cubans out of the country, Among other things, this

offer served as a smoke screen to cover the purge which he had carried

out. Then, complete silence on the subject, so that no one would realize

that the Party has been placed under his absolute personal control. He

fears the reaction of the purged old Commies.

October 20: "Latin America Against Communism". - The lenezuelan Dock-

workers' Convention in Caracas, which had an internatioral character, put

out Resolutions in which the workers of the Americas confirm their deter-

mination to fight communism.

"The Arrival of the Pro-Consul".- Gromyko's trip to Cuba is more than just l

a visit by the Sovlet Foreign Minister: It is an unanrounced inspection

tour by the Fro-Consul to his Carlbben colony. Of course, tills trip can

bring nothing good for Fidel.

October 21: "Why 1s Gromyko in Havana?". - Gromyko, breaking all rules of

denocracy, showed up in Havana. What for? Among the other problems faced

by Cuba, he showed up to solve the crisis undergone by the Cuban Comunist:

"The Fussled Cheat", - Castro's "oper-door" offer, which was just a bluff

which he hoped would not be accepted, has caught Fidel in a series of

traps nhich he has laid himself. He has had to take resource to a thousand

gimmicks and buts in order to keep Cuba from losing 1ts

entire population,

but he his been unable to keep Camarioca from becoming a plebiscate of

hostility agrinst his regime.

October 22: "Fidel Castro's Despair". - After he was abandoned by the of-

ficers and soldiers of the kebel Army, by the militia and by the people

of Cuba in general, Castro tries to seek refuge in the support of the

youth, which he flatters constantly to that and. If 1t 1s true that

Cuba!s joung people support Castro, ve challenge him to allow draft-ago

youths to leave the country if they wish.

"Che's Letter in Cuban Schools".- Castro has ordered that Che's letter

be read and re-read in Cuban schools. The letter, which seems to have

been dictated by Fidel while his victim stood with a foot in the grave,

is a carbon copy of Stalin's procedures. Stalin also demanded that the

"purged" leave letters which he himself dictated, in order to. instill the

cult to his personality in the minds of children and form the myth of his

own genius. Castro forgets that such Stalinist methods are still too re-

cent and much discredited.

October 22: "Gromyko and Castro's Woes".- This article emphasises

Castro's deef concern over Gromyko's sudden appearance in Cuba, which

indicates that the Soviet Pro-Consul dropped in to tighten Castro-Con-

munist screws economically as well as politically.

position to Castro's brand of Communism among the old-line Parties in

this Continent. While Castro has invested millions in subversion, Corva-

lan has patiently walted to cafflalize on such investments and on Fidel's

own activities. Today more than ever, the old-line Communist Partlos

throughout the Americas are in a hurry to displace Castro completely, and

surge a counter-coup right in Cuba, where Fidel has made a devastating

purge of the Old Guard.

October 25: "Castro's Memo to the Soviet Union". - A comment on the memo

presented by Custro to Gromyko concerning Cuba's needs with respect to

economy, oil, currancy, sugar, transportation eguipment, industrial units,

etce, in order that cuba's econchy may get rolling again. Gromykors crisp,

cold reply was that he would forward the demands to the soviet government..

"Mikoy»n-Gromyko".- Soon it'1l be three yoars sinco Mikoyan, in his

capacity as the Kremlin's Pro-Consul, travelled to Cuba to Impose Soviet

decisions on the notorious "missile crisis". Three years later, another

Pro-Consul, Gromyko, shows up in Havana, also to Impose Soviet decisions

on the puppet. The Kremlin is making it plain for Fidel to understand

that he can't last a week longer unless he fully abides by Moscow's orders.

October 25: "Not Even the Soviet Union Can Save Castro" - This article

comments the internal situ tion of Cuba and Castro-Communism at the cime

of Gromyko's departure from the Island. Mention is made of growing dis-

content, of restlessness and dissatisfaction among Cubans, plus the

destruction of Cuba's light industry and agriculture. Other woes of the

Castroites are elaborated on, and, in the end, we call on those who form

part of the Castro government, but who nevertheless love Cuba, to help

put an end to the Red monster and to the anguish of the people.

could denounce Cuban maneuvers to help the Viot Cong.

bao that ho and his shipmatios had refused torn tho rinko of transporting war mato

tation was wrong.

Cobas added that all Cuban veicola have been ordered to tako mil

Itary cupplies to North Viet Nan from other Asian Communict ports, and that the Cu

Roforring to his former ship, Capt. Cobas explained that the Embarsy had ordered --

tho "Aracello Iglosias" to sali to a lorth Koroan port and to awalt further Instrug

tions there.

The Cuban diplomats withheld the ship's itinerary and declared that -

the "Aracello" would return to the Japanese port of. Yahata before proceeding to —

North Vict Nam. By protending that the ship would come back to Japan, they hoped -

to decoive the crew and reasure tho Japaneso as to tho cargo and the use to which -

the ship was being put.

The truth was, however, that, while in Horth Korea, the

"Aracollo" was to receive orders to load a cargo of war supplies and sail directly

from thore to lorth Viet: Nam.

According to Cobas, this could not be done in the and bocause the Tokyo Embassy was

warned at the last moment that the North Korean port of Chinnampo was blocked by -

1c0.

The "Aracelio" was now ordered to pick up another military shipment at Shan

ghas and take it to North Viet Ham. It was then that Cobas and his shipmates dec-

Ided to walk out.

Cobas went on to explain that logistical support to the North Vietnameso was one of

Un capitán cubano que abandonó su nave en japón el 26 do diciembro confirmó hoy

on Miani que el apoyo logístico de Castro a los rojos de Viet Nam había sido el prin

ipal motivo de su deserción. En una conferencia de prensa colobrada en un céntrico

hotol de osta ciudad, Francisco Cobas, capitán del carguero cubano "Aracello Iglesias"

axplicó a los periodistas por qué él y sus corpañeros do oficialidad decidieron so11.

denunodar las maniobras de Cuba Roja en favor de los rojos viotnamitas.

Duranto la conferencia, se encontraban Junto a Cobas los otros tres oficiales as1-

Lados, nombrados Antonio Ruiz Arias (Primer Oficial), Mario Julio Pérez Girón (Jolo

de liáquinas), y Humberto R: Fornández (Sobrecargo).

El capitán Cobas fue presentado

de guerra a Viot Nen del Morto desde otros puertos comunistas del Asia, y que la Emba

jada cubara en Tokyo fungo como coordinadora de tales embarques.

Refiriéndose el "Aracello Igloslas", que capitaneaba, Cobas reveló que la Erbaja

da cubana en Japón había dispuesto que el '"Aracelio" zarpara rumbo a un puerto norca-

reano y aguardara allí nuevas órdenes. Los diplomáticos castristas rotuvieron el 1t1

nerario del buque y declararon que el mismo volvería al puerto japonés de lahata an -

tos de seguir rumbo a Viet Nam dol Norto.

Al hacer ver que ol buque regresaria al J:

on, los comunistes se proponían enganar a la tripulación y tranquilizar a las autori

dados japonesas respecto del cargamento del buque y del uso que se iba a dar al mismo.

La realidad, empero, era que, durante la estancia del "Aracelio" en Corea del forto,

Segun Cobas, esto no pudo hncorso dobido a que, a ultima hora, la Embajada poc

1ó el aviso do qua ul puorto norcoreano de Chinnanpo estaba bloqueado por ol hielo

n vista de ollo, so ordonó al "Aracelio" lovar anclas rumbo a shanghai para poco -

or allí otro cargamento do matorial de guerra y conducirlo al Viot Nar. Fue ento

cos que Cobas y sus compañeros docidieron abandonar al buque.

A continunción, Cobas pasó a explicar que el apoyo logístico a los Viot Cong -

constituye una de las tareas encomendadas al nuevo embajador cubano en Tolyo, un co

munista fanático nombrado

Manuol Jorge Cuervo M'onóndoz quo tuvo a su cargo la adral-

nistración de varios campos do concentración on Isla de Pinos.

Refirléndoso a los malos tratos que recibon los marinos cubanos, Cobas moncionó

a las consideraciones

con ch dua que no din o tratan o o age

otros paisos comunistas y a la ridícula cantidad ($5 semanalos) en monoda local que

30 da a dos marinos cubanos para sus gastos en puertos extranjeros.

Dotallando la

cuestión de la vigilancia, rovoló el capitín Cobas que on la nayoría de los buques

cubanos al G-2 do ‹ bordo suelo ser al radiotelegrafista.

Como capitán del "Araca

Lio Iglesias", el propio Cobas so vio obligado a entregarlo a otro agente policíaco

dostacado a bordo

toda la corrospondencia de ciertos tripulantes supuestamente des

Tambión dijo Cobas. a los portodistas que los principalos problenas que confronta

Como ejemplo de esto

Cobes que la agencia oficial de compras del rógimen cubano casi nunca

comunica a la coordinadora do flotos (CUFLET) la fecha en que deborá cargarse alguna

Como consecuancia de esto, al -

cho que muchas flinas extranjeras bien se abstengan de comerciar con la tiranía roja

•y chiranter and I have requestod political asylum fron the lilted States

because we aro convinced that Culan support of tre Communist var in Vietnam 18

wrong and we r-fuor is run tne ricks of transpo:.ing war natertal to North Viet

Nam.

All Cuban ships have orders to carry cargo to North Vietnam to help tho

North Vlotnamese war effort, The Cuban Embassy in Japan 1s asting as the coor-

dinator for all shipments of war satorial to North Vlotnam via Cuban ships from

Communist porto in Asia, The Cutan Embasay in Tokyo had secretly arranged for

tho tracollo Iglosias to take a shipmont of war seterials from Horth Korea to

North Vlotnam. In order to hide their intentions, the Embassy arranged that the

Iracello itinorary be kept up in the air until the last possible moments then to

fool the arow and the Japaneso they gavo the story the ship would raturn to Japan

to load tin cargo at Yahata and then procood

on route to North Vietnan. In real-

ity, wo woro to roceive instructions on itinerary while in North Korea telling

us to procoed directly to North Vietnan aftor loading tho war supplies.

It the last moment, however, tha Embasay was informed that the port of

Chinnampo was blocked by Ice. The Cuban Embassy then hastily arranged for us to

pick up a shipment of arms in Shangal previously scheduled for another Cuban

boat about the ond of January.

Logistical support to tho North Vlotnamese is one of the two tasks assigned

to No. ranuol Jorge Cuerto,: the now Cuban Ambassador to Japan. His other func

tion is to erase the bad effects on Japanese-Cuban trade caused by the defection

of the former trade Counselor to Jayan, Gilberto Merany, Tho Cuban government

1s very concerned about the prospect of declining trade sinco already some comp-

andes that formerly tradod with cuba, will no longer do so openly.

In general, I may say that nenbers of the Cuban merchant marine live under

unbearable conditions. The treatment we roceive is so bad that no one foala

like cooperating with the marine purposes of the regime, even in the few cases

where there

might be no ireological incorpatihility involved.

As examples of this treatment I say mention the constant spying on board

by nombers of the "G-2". For some reason, the "G-2" ran on board is usually the

radio and telegraph operator. In tho "Aracelio" we had one by the nare of Eduar

do Sánchez who was a notorious

spy. Abaird we had another man called Yanuel Rúa

Rodrigues who was imposed as the Fourth Ingineer, even though he had no training

or ability to perform such duties.

among other thingo, that I surrerder an his tho inconing and outgoing rall of

ports, all we got in local currency le the aquivalent of 15 per wook which, of

course, aro deducted from our basic salaries. In applying this restriction, no

distinction is made botween the cresten or the varlous officer ranko. It 1a 15

for everyone.

Because of all this, and because of the terrible conditions under which

Communiam kepo our homeland, most Cuten sailora and officers aro ataunch anti-

Conmunlats. The Government knows thie, but nevertheless they must employ what

they call "the reactionarion" because of the scarcity of other trained personnel

to man Cuban boats. Their only choice 1s to apy on us constantly, as I have

just explained.

No to the operating conditione of the Cuhan merchant fleet, it 10 worth

nentioning that. Pollah ships, which race so a sizable proportion of Cuban ship

ping, are supplied with soviot made squiprent which the Russlans have long dis-

carded as obsolete. Again, my own ship le an examplo. The "Aracelio" vas cor-

pleted as recontly as 1963 in a Pollah shipyard. Yet, 1ta radar equiprent 1s so

obsolete that it 1s simply not used, sirce ve could never find the parts to re-

pair 1t whon 1t broke. 1 German tectrician told my Chief kate here that it must

have been a World-War II unit.

Excessive bureaucratie red tape ass disorganization is another serious

problem confronted by Cuban shipring arc which often results in considerable

damage to those firms that trade uith de Castro tyranny. I will illustrato

this. The Cuban government agency responsible for arranging maritime transpor-

tation for nerchardise bought abroad l8 the "Empresa Cubana de Fletes" (CUPLET).

attempts to establish this aro to no ava11. Then one day the buying agency

serves last-minute notice thut the merchandice will be roady for loading.

CUFLET takes pains to find a versel in time but, more ofton than not, 1ts hasty

offorts aro in vain. In the moantimo, tho seller abroad grows impatient, as ho

This happens all the time, to the extent that many foreign firma refuso to

deal with such an undependable cuntonor as the Cuban government, or, foroseeing

the damages they may come to them hocause of such inefficiency they impose the

harshest solling terms.

The unrest and chaos that I havo described is not peculiar to the merchant

fleet. I do not know many details nbout this because I have been out at sea most

of the timo since I first heard of 1t, but I understand that the Cuban Havy was

also in such turnoll that practically all its officors were discharged early ihis

nerchant carine, and my wen and I know a fow instances. It is even true that

• Army officers with no naval experienco are being appointed to high naval posi

tions. However, it is most likely that many of the purged officers will have

been shot or imprisoned. Such 18. the Cuba of today.

Lastly, we wish to emphasize that our decision to scek asylum in the United

States, has boon made of our own freo will. l'o have been pressured Into this decl

For aMscrolL use, primarily its radio, the point of which

was that GOMEZ had become eligible for the

on 21 October that Camarioca was a

plebiscite and his statement on 22 October, no doubt as a

result of a prod from his Communist superiors that "I think

I made

excessive concessions

1.- Cuba continues desperate attempts sell sugar.- The Cuban sugar monopoly, CUBA-

ZUCAR, on September 6 concluded a sale of 5,000 tons of ram sugar for October 1965

delivery to the Irandan sugar organisation.

The origin of this sugar was hidden in

that it nas declared to have originated in the Caribbcan, including Peru, excluding

larket reports were-correct in stating that the country of origin was in

The price agreed to as 18 pounds sterling per ton (C and F) less 5 -..

shillings per ton to cover the axpensos of the tender.

This doal was engineered by

Restzucker of Dortmund, an organisation also solling Cuban sugar to Jordan and which

wishes to keep its name out of thase sales.

Another interesting development in Cuba's sugar selling activities during the month

of September was quoting sugar for futuro delivery at or under the London spot

price on the day the offer was made. In other words, Cuba is offering sugar under

the world market value.

It is difficult to explain this curious behavior in terms other than Cuba's desper

ate need for foreign exchanga.

These sales at these prices can only result in a

net loss to Cuba due to Cuta's inefficient sugar production.

during the past month of August.

ACTIOS REQUIRED: FYI

REFERSCE: UFGA 19181, dated 21 December 1964

A. OPERATIONAL

1.

During December there was considerable pressure on AMSCROLL

to join political

groupings being formed by ex-Presidents Urrutia

•and PIlo

Fortunately,

AMSCROLL was able to stay out of both without

Incurring the wrath of either.

B. PRODECTION

Although a number of new propaganda ideas were submitted by

AMSCROLL for approval,

the only new item for Cuban consumption

actually printed during the month was the pony bulletin.

This and

other items already on hand, including 5,000 Christmas cards, totalled

17,000 pieces which were sent in 20,000 covers to Cuba. Another

10,000 Items were distributed to Latin America and Spain, and 13,700

to addressees in the U. s.

Most of the two latter categorios were

based or requests from religious, social, and civic organizationg.

Samples of the items and a breakdown of

the actual numbers of each

distributed are in the attached AMSCROLL Propaganda Section report.

3. AMSCROLL broadcasts continued as scheduled.

Chief among the

themes, which also pervaded the two issues of the AMSCROLL, house organ

published during the month and the above-mentioned pony bulletin for

Cuba, were as follows:

The Congo in lurid detail with outrage at the Comminist

and behind the atrocities, and with scorn for the so-called neutralist:

for their attitude for the rescue mission.

ANSCROLL editoralized tha

except. or the canibalism, Congo tactics including ravage and wanton

murder are what brought Stalin, Tito, Mao, and Fidel to power.
