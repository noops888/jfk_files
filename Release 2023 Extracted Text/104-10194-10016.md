EVALUATION AND BACAGRUUTO DATA (Include education and sort experienco)

Mt88 Tarasoff is the wife of Boris Tarasoff, FDUl employee. She first made application

shortly after her husband's EOD while she and the children were

still in California.

Attempts to have her te: ted

and Interviewed on the liest Coast were unsuccessful.

The farily is all now gattered in D.C.j the children are in school; arrangements

have be:a made for the care of

the

children auring the lage between the end of

the schoold day and the end of the parents wort: day.

Test results are very interestin'.. It would appear tiat Mrs. Tarasoff shoudd bo

able to do a most adequate job in a clerical jou of the most, deadly routine nature.

I'm quite sure such positions are avallable in the Agency.

Mra. Tarasoff apparently has a reasonably good command of Russian, both spaken and

written; I gathered that some of the houseliold conversation is carried or in that

langiage.

HCNEVER, I gave her absolutely no assurance that we would be ablo to

utilize this skill.

She is interested in employment as soon as possible and I discussed an Indices

Cleararce with her.

Tre Pool, the teaporary Incofinato appointient, et al, were

• described in lurid detail. She is wiiling and interestedo

Personally, I found Mrs. Taragoff to be a very pleasant little wonan. She is slight

and slender with reddish hair; sniles easily and appears as easy to work with,

GS-L Clerk agreeable and recommended.

CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY

WASHINGTON 25, D. C.

Applicant Information

Sheet No. 1

To all persuns applying for employment

with the Ceatral Intelligence Agency:

This paper is the first step in applying for employment or consultant

status with the Central Intelligence Agency.

No application may proceed

beyond this first step if the applicant is not in agreement with the

conditions stated below:

General Considerations:

1. The National Security Act of 26 July 1947 (Public Law 253, 80th

Congress) which created the Central Intelligence Agency places upon the

Agency the responsibility:

a, "to advise the National Security Council in matters concerning

such intelligence activities of the Government departments and agencies

as relate to the national security:

b. "to make recommendations to the National Security Council

for the coordination of such intelligence activities of the depart-

ments and igencies" of the Government as relate to the national

security;

c.. "to correlate and evaluate intelligence relating to the

national security,

and provide for the appropriate dissemination

of such intelligence within the Governmens. ..:

d. "4o perform, for the benefit of the existing intelligence

agencies, such additional services of common concern as the National

Security Courcil determines can be more efficiently accomplished

centrally:

e. "80 perform such other functions and duties related to

intelligence affecting the national security as the National Security

Council may irom time to time direct."

---

## Page 7

14-00000

The special charncier of this national responsibility requires the Agency

to maintain correspondingly

special employment criteria which may be

different from the routine or normal employment standards of other Govern-

ment departments and agencies which do not have the highly sensitive res-

ponsibility borne by the Central Intolligence Agency, It follows that the

investigation of applicants prerequisite to their acceptance is a time-

consuming process which, in iddition to loyalty and security checks,

includes evaluation of competence, physical and emotional fitness, und

availability of a suitable position at such time as employment may be offered.

This is called "clearance" of an applicant.

2. Investigation of an applicant may reveal something which prevents

his clearance - perhaps something of which the applicint is genuinely unaware,

perhaps something which only the special employment criteria of the Agency

make unacceptable. In any event, adverse findings by the Agency ire con-

clusive and final so far as the Agency is concerned, and no stilement of

specific reasons is made to the applicant.

3. Employment by the Central Intelligence Agency is not a right upon

which an applicant can insist. Offer of employment which is subject to full

clearance does not constitute a commitment on the Agency's part giving in

unsuccessful applicant grounds for any claim against the Agency. Acceptance

of employment upon the condition of clearance is at the applicant's risk,

taken with the knowledge that a very substantial percentage of applicants

are not cleared.

Statement of Understanding

and Agreement

I have read, understand, and agree to the foregoing General Consid

erations. If not accepted for employment by the Central Intelligence

Agency, I will make no claim or demund in conflict with those consid-

erations.

I have also seen and read Applicant Information Sheet No. 2.

Although this employee's wort is productive, her rate of production generally remains

at a fixed lovel, vith no substantial increase of deorease.

This 18 probably due to

the fact that there are no other girld with whoa she can compete because of other

duties being assigned to then, or this employee may be of a non-competitivo typo.

This employee, although she does not meet the Agency qualifications in typing, has

taken the Agency's Reffesher Course in Typing,

However, this course was too

advanced for her and she vill probably require additional training and noro practico

bofore she can become a qualified typist.

It is belloved that this employee has first line supervisory potential insofar as

her ability to get along with people and her unwavering interest in her work are

concerned.

However, she will require the necessary training along this line before

she would be capable of undertaking such supervisory duties.
