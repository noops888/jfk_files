"Oswald" Letter to US Embassy, Stockholm.

i garding the language in the subject lettar, which isn't standard english, 1t

1s úlificult to say that 1t reflocts any particular foreign (non-inglish) backzround.

"Outsinug;led: 1s Garmande;- and "Sowlat" say be Garmanic. or Slavic,

and both may

tend to be suggestive. However, a Chinese who has studied several European

lanzuayas may easily mix the 1dioms or spollings of any of then in an effort

at English composition.

"ayo" 1s not

"R" 19 9000

1n the now Chirose Camunist national systom, but never in combination with

"Ryo" is a Japanese spelling.

In the nasa given it is not known whether the Chinese or western presentation

Is used, or, in other words, whether "Ryo" or "YUan" is meani to be the surnase.

Among Chinese syllables which could be represented by the Japaneso "Ryo" aro

Ilao, Llang and Lung.

Of these Lung (IC: 7893) and Llang (IC: 2733) are used

as surpanes. In either caso, "Ryo" 18 hardly a name by which a real trineso

would identliy hinsell.

The unit which keeps record of Chinese Carmnist diplomatic and official

personnel abroad will very probanly in able to determina nether thera 18

an actual person in the Chinese Communist Embassy In Stockhole with whos the

nate given in the letter can be concacted. The US Embassy, will have Leans

of leamlig whather that person was In Stocicholm at the tize of the letter

writing, and wethar he has subsequently been removed.

THIS IS VEY INPOBRANI AND MUS A 342 JERE!

=25/11-03.

The Fresident

0f the United jutas in America, John a Hunnedy vas

assassinaied by let H Oswald by direct order of the government oi

the Peoples Republic of China. Lea H Oswald executed the act alore

but there nas helpers and rescry. "How ill is over" wus password

to his custoners. Oswald was a fully convinced Comunist but be

mist assassinate Kemedy. Ve etablised contact with Oswald already

when he nas in soniet but then to try to get him as a spy for China.

Ister he vas spy for

us. Ther. lad E Osrald had returced to USA ve

cuntacted nim quer dod iresuened up mis mind you have been a suy

for us" and told his what could happen to him if FBI got inforued.

How we had him. He got his last intormation in iexico. /It was not

gocd to assassinate Zennedy in dexico/ "Fair Play for cuba" was

staried only to conjuse and throw the blame on Castro zor the ag-

ssassinatus. Our government thought that USA should attack Cuba

when Kennedy was murded as the orginaztion mus behind the assassin-

ation. Then Cuba was attacied by US. Soniet must help Castro defend

himself. I: that was so it would burden Sowiet that Oswald had visi-

ted. We should be alliated with Soviet then me would ass them for i-

bombs and they should not be able to refuse us. "e and Soviet should

win this. was and whole the world should be Communistic. Then re should

assassinate Trustjer and other sowiet leadors and we would be leader

of the NeW 202. When this letter wiil reach you they have

malied

away with hi and all that knowes the plancs. This letter is outsuugöled

from oux Embassy in Stockholm where the imbassy is aighinese spy-sacol.

wy name is ?yo Liang Tüan. Officer in the departuent lor State-secret.

If you do not belive this letter explein our hate to USi.
