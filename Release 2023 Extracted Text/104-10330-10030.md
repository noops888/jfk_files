An overall digraph is used to designate an overall cryptonym for general subjects, programs,

or activities for which responsibility is shared with other components.

Ц

An extract is used when an individual/company in a document has a 201/301 file, but the

length of the document may be too long to 'B' code (B code: to cross-file an entire copy of a

document into a 201/301).

- ZR is used to indicate that the pertinent information indicated by the analyst is to be

extracted for headquarters only.

- FR is used to indicate that the pertinent information indicated by the analyst is to be

extracted for headquarters and the field.

When an extract is performed, a machine printout is generated and is sent to the location of

the 201/301 file. The printout will indicate:

- that it is an extract

- what document it is from

- the date of the document

- where the Record Copy is filed

- the information extracted by the analyst.

For example, say there is a 60 page document on the Communist Party of Mexico. The only

time in the whole document the following info is mentioned is: "Juan Jose Gonzalez Jimenez

resigned as Mexico City Chairman on 17 Jan 96." He has 201-0000001. The DMB analyst pulls

this info using 'ZR' or 'FR', and instead of having a 60 page document in his 201, he has a one

page extract.

Hope this helps. Any questions/problems, pls let me know.
