2. It became clear, during the perlod between 3 May 63 and 16 May 68

that Charles would not be able to raise the ranson sun of US$605

thousand. His release frOm prison, which took place on 25 Apr 68,

vas apparently contingent on his ability to produce that sun.

Investors in subscribing to a fund of Us$oos thousand.

that the present political and particular

reported willingness to pledge as collateral blo extensive hold-

Ings In East1 (essential olls and varous other business enter-

prises, Land, bulldogs and Baltian goverment bondo) failed to

change the negative opinions of those approached an possible

investors.

Charles holde a receipt fron the Benque Matiouale de la Repub-

1966, and claima from the INKI another personal credit of

US$100 thousand, dated 1965, Ile does not, however, bold & copy

of any receipt for the latter sun. Charles apparently cannot

utilize these sums, or his crealt for them, to pay off the

Us$605 thousand ranson.

Imprisoned in 1967, the feltsan authoritles (n0 additional data

avallablo) compelled him to sign a muber at blant checko of

these two bania.

the authorities then cashed a check for

Us,10 thousand, which the bank honored.

When the Haltian

authorities next presented Illled-in checks, sovever, the bank

refused payment, because 1t knew of bis arrest and refused to

belleve that he had signed s check after his artest.

The

Baltian authorities then abandoned their attempta to lay their

hands on the rest of the money.
