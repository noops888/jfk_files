Waller said this was yet another example of what he believes are leaks from

the Assassinations Committee members or staff and he predicted more.

noted that he was expressing his "gut feeling" and that it was difficult to

determine where Anderson got his information because there is FOIN, Warren

Commission, and other material in the public domain.

White said Anderson's

column takes pieces and weaves them into a

"non-story." White reported that

during Lyle Miller's meeting with Representative Preyer, who will be concen-

trating on the Kennedy assassination, they discussed leaks.

Preyer expressed

concern that more exposures might affect the Committee's future, and it would

appear that we should get back to him citing the Anderson column.

connection with their investigation.

A lengthy discussion followed on the

merits of establishing a special review mechanism. The Director noted that

an option would be for him and Chairman Stokes to review any issues that might

grow out of the Committee's random samples.

The Director asked Lapham and

Miller to come up with the best option, although in his judgment a DCI/Chair-

Morning Meeting of 8 December 1977

The Director was

out of the city; Mr. Blake chaired the mecting.

Wells advised that Station Mexico continues to have severe liaison

problems with the COM which has little faith in our ability to keep secrets

in light of FOIA releases.

In response to Lapham's inquiry, Wells noted

that release of information acquired by a COM tap of Soviet lines in the

Oswald case is one point in question.

Lapham added that he was meeting with

Justice today on the further declassification of documents requested in the

ITT case and possible additional Agency witnesses. Justice is asking us

to lurther sanitize material already provided, some of which would impact

on data obtained by Station Mexico.

He explained that the 150 documents now

in the hands of Justice could be subpoenaed and we would have difficulty

defending our position unless we go to the Attorncy General and perhaps the

President. He will review and advise.
