o! this during the course of har mission. It is believed she left

for Indonesia somatime in Jaguary 1959.

It is known that she did

meet Sukarso, but due to unfortuzate timing that had.him leaving

his country on official businesa, she bad little time to cultivate bim;

consequently, the purpose of the mission was not fulfilled. I should

be noted that Sukarno took sufficient notice of her that during 23 22-

official visit to the United States in June 1959, he expressed a stronz

desiro to seo her and did.

17. The last known contact slatihad with the Agency was in

the forma of a telaphone call on 12 April 1961 whan she called on tbe

sterile line and talked to Hugh Tovar, who she knew as George Fienry.

She advised that folks asked her to give a party for Presi-

dent Sukarzo who would be in Los Angeles on 21 April 1961. Ske

wanted to know whether Heary's people were interested in spon30r-

ing this farty. A negative response was given.

18. It is not known where she is or what her activities ara at

the prosent time, but presumably she is still in the Los Angal's
