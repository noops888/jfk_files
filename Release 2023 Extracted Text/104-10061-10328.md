2023 RELEASE UNDER THE PRESIDENT JOHN F. KENNEDY ASSASSINATION RECORDS ACT OF 1992

SEGRET

27 June 1978

MEMO FOR : SE/SAG/OP

from

: SE/OP/s - carol karpose

SUBJECT

: Sergey Aleksandrovich UZLOV (201-948382)

1. Returning your 201 herewith. As you will recall I borrowed 201 since UZLOV

had reported on an acquaintance who reportedly knew OSWALD. This information

and Source's identity was passed to CI/Staff to be given to HSCA in view of the

latter's interest in OSWALD et al.

2. Thanks again to you and Victor who phoned UZLOV to alert him to potential

query from HSCA. To date, I personally have no details as to whether HSCA

pursued lead!
