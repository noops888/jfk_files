SUBJECT:

Department of Justice Request to Release Information on

Antulio RAMIREZ Ortiz to House Select Committee on

Assassinations

REF:

FBI Report of Theodore N. Goble, 28 July 1961 (DBF-84088)

The information contained in the last paragraph on page one and

the first paragraph on page two of reference may not be released

the committee because it

apparently was obtained through liaison.

The information is repeated from CSC1-3/765,713 which in turn was

based on a report from Santiago de Cuba (HKSA-171,

The information in HKSA-171 was passed to the Department of State

at some time because the last two paragraphs on page two and the

paragraph on page three of reference, information on Ramirez from

the Department of State repeates the information quoted from HKSA-171

and should not be released either.
