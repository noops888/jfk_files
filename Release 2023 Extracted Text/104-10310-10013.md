2023 RELEASE UNDER THE PRESIDENT JOHN F. KENNEDY ASSASSINATION RECORDS ACT OF 1992

SECRET

12 September 1975

SUBJECT Responses to SSC Request for Additional Information on

Project ZRRIFLE

William G. Miller Letter to Mr. Walt Elder, 3 September 1975

REFERENCE:

Responsé:

1. a. The cryptonym EUTUBE is apparently a garble and FUTURE

is probably meant instead. This is a cryptonym belonging to LA

Division assigned to a U.S. citizen formerly of operational interest

to us. His true name cannot be divulged because, according to our

records, he still resides abroad in the country against which he

was targeted as a reporting source. Revelation of his identity and

of his past association with us would be«dangerous to his security.

b. The cryptonym KUTUBE referred to FI Staff, now known

as the Operations Staff.

The cryptonym DNIVID was assigned to a Yugoslav Major,

06

Djuroje Djurovig

2. a. LAVRICLE was an action indicator for FI/D.

b. Monroe B. ROZENEY, Ed JOUVENOY, Wanda CRICKARD and James

N. RABNEY are all pseudonyms. They were assigned respectively to:

3. Mr. Harvey was issued the pseudonym Daniel M. PRESLAND in

1956 and he used this pseudonym until he retired in 1967. This is the

only pseudonym he used in connection with the ZRRIFLE Project and Cuban

operations. Mr. Harvey was issued the alias William WALKER in May

1962 and he continued to use it while he was Chief of the Cuban

operations until he was reassigned in June 1963. There is no indication

in the file that Mr. Harvey used this alias in connection with the

ZRRIFLE Project. There is no record that Mr. Harvey was ever issued

or used a cryptonym.
