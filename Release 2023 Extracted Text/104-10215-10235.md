interrogated him with regard to Cubela and Juan Pedro Carbo Servia,

in connection

with the slaying of Lt. Col. Antonio Blanco Rico of

Cubela was his intimate friend. Source: Ours, fron Cuban govern-

1959: "Raul CASTRO Ruz is a known homosexual, and in 1959 in Raul's

home in the Camp Columbia Aqs, Raul and Cubela were surprieed while

making obvious homosexual advances toward one another. Cubela later

fell into disgrace with the regime. It 1s not kuown whether this was

due to his unsatisfactory performance as a student leader or whether

he had had a "Lover's Quarrel" with Raul. Source: Latin American

revolutionary who lived in Cuba until August 1962 and personally met

high Cuban officials. (Ed Note: Perhaps his performance as one-half

of the homosexual teaa was unsatisfactory!!?)

homosexual relations with Cubela during an interrogation by Sly after

the killing of Lt. Col. Antonio BLANCO Rico. However, there is no

doubt that Cardenas still considered hinself a friend to Cubela and

hardly be true 1f Cubela had been blackmailing him for jears. There
