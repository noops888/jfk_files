The

I chocked further en this point with A/l at our

pilfering the till, the problem if ary vas simply honest mismarafament.

We should remanber that N1 has been paid a salary, with Has surrement

ande 1t a point to deposit the check in A/l'8 personal account every

A/1 told

= this incident because he was anazed to find. when 1/2 left for Spain

and turned the records of the account trer tol/1, he found that he had

4 or 5 thousand dollars in the bank, the nost he had aver owned in hiä

11f0. In addition to this salary, it should be remembered that A/1

in a co-author of the "Bay of Pigs" bood, which was worth several

thousand dollars to each of the l co-authors.

Notes This line of raparting has been going on for at least the past 2 years in

the sase of A/1 and is typical uf the incessant gossip and character

assassination within the luban exile community in Miami that has been

going un for the last 5 years, ihile certainly no paragon of virtuo or

of efficiency, it will take more than this to convince mo 1/l 19 a

before he could make the call another message had come in

Iron Col. Barrientos of dollvia asking it ho could visit

and bring him to la Paz.

I asked 1f he were acquainted

He had no idas of the reason for the invitation,

but wanted to check with us and find out if we had any

roquirements for him in case we wanted him to nake the visit.

I told him I would check with Chief, Wi next morning and

call him back.

On the morning of 5 June I called Artine.

He said

Professor lodge had called him at 0700 that morning and told

him he was interested in getting together with him.

• Lodge

ga1d he mould be in Panama on 14 June, and Artime said he

planned to be travalling in that area at that time and could

easily meet him there.

Artine told Lodge he was willing to

nake a trig to lison

to see him earlier and that after such

a preliminary meritis,

the next meeting in Panama would probably

"be more useful.

SUggested he send a sessago to Barrientos saying he could

(Artine has

aldes had been to Mashington or New York and in passing

through Miani enroute home heard & MRR radio broadcast

about

countering subversion, civic action, etc. that

attracted his attention.

There vag also a brief analysis

of the situation in Bolivia which appealed to him as the

best-balanced hehad heard.

He thereupon started asking

questions about the MRR and Artine and was

referred to one

Artine's people who turned over

some copies of "Tridente"

(magazine of the MRR).

The alde renarked that he was going

report to Barrientos of his discovery of a Cuban exile

froup that seemed knowledgeable of Castro and Communist

subversion operations and had some useful ideas of how to

counter them.

Two days later Artime received the invitation

fron Barrientos.

InfOrustiOn WaS AMWORLD-2:

AMKORLD-2 left for New York with his fantly on 15

May 1965,

this being his first step towards disconnecting

binself from AMWORLD.

Before he left,

he handed over to

AMBIDDY-1 the AMWORLD money which he had in the bank.

ANWORLD-2 said that AMBIDDY-1 was devoting all his

attention to obtaining money by the sale of militiry equipment

which he had at the camps.

AMBIDDY -1 had already realized

U.8. $30,000 in this manner and hoped to raise still another

$80,000.

AMBIDDY-1 currently had all the AMWORLD noney under

his absolute control and said he intended to act aa treasurer

of the organization.

C. ABIDDY-I gave the impression of not being involved

wIth any political plan.

Occasionally he talked to friends

about Interviews with his "contacts" and about & budget for

propaganda.

Other times he gave consideration to propositions

of friends, such as the Spaniard who acts as his chauffeur

and secretary, concerning various business deals.

He also talka

of Laying a farm 11 Nicaragua to cultivate rico, etc.

MEetINgS WITh ANJAVA-A In MAShingtON, 27-28 June 1965

Subjeet: Proposed Agency PrOGIANE

1. Folloning the denise of ANORLD, ANJAVAA has become

fanillar vith three other Agency prograas, or proposed programs.

and he asked if he could have sone clarification as to just

what ve vanted from hin and his people.

I explained that there vere

three different functions which needed to be done and that the

Agancy vas trying to develop prograns to meet each need.

тао.

three functions concerning Cube are:

(a) to maintain the MRR as a respected resistanco.

organization vith a political posture which is acceptable to nost

Cubans and not ininical to U.S. interests.

We are asking approval of

a sinlaus budget for subsidy of the ARR which will pay for its

pubiished and radio publicity matter, subsistence to survivors of

MRR killed, disabled,

or captured, and travel expenses for. AMBIDDY-!

s the leader of the movement outside Cuba.

We are trying to

quide A- Into a program of Community Development/ Civic Action

projects in Latin America as a means of projecting an inago of

the

MRR and of A-l as constructive, forwerd-looking people instead of

Bimply exile counterrevolutionarles.

We would hope that such

rotivities would keep the movement together, give the mendera

practical experience which would eventually be useful in Cube, and

In the moantine, would render useful results in countering

problers of insurgency in Latin America.

'(D) to prepare a managerial and executive team of

specially selected Cuban exiles who would be ready to move into Cuba

should relations be resuned with the Unitad States in order to

furnish effective direction of necessary governmental functions and

assist the. United States in denying the island to Communist

control.

Selected candidates would, hopefully, be fairly young

as well as intelligent and capable of profiting from extensive

training programs which would be designed for tach to prepare him

to perform a specific function in a future Cuban regine. : The

progran would be apolitical, each person being considered as an

ndividual and not as representative of any

Th1s

¿ the progran for which Ad is being considere

for training, in

would also, of course, be available for emerseney opera satay

conmitment to Cuba if required.

(It vas explained that tils vas

the program handled by Mr.

the progra handle da detai Told Ands,or SoD, uho was prosest and.

A-4 understood that the prograns outlined above nure

only parts of an overall concept concering Cuba, that the 44rst vas

designed to meet long-ters political considerations, the scond

o noet long-term strategic requirements, and the third ta meet

current operational needs.

he understood and completely afreed

with each program, and agreed to cooperate in executing darh of

then, to the maxinus of his ability.

He will be happy ta spot and

recruit for us in each program, and will try to influence AMBIDDY-1

ajong the lines we want him to follow.

A-4 appreciatod.oum

explanations and stated that he could be much more helpful tiò us

now that ho understoud what we were trying to accouplish.

¿EMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT:

Meeting with George Lodge, Harvard School

of Business

1.

on 15 July 1965, with Mr.

Andy Croce of CA Stuff,

I net Mr. Lodge at the Key Bridge Marriott Hotel to discuss.

what he knew about thi relations among AMBIDDY-1, Bishop

IcGrath of Panama, and a rural development program they are.

all working on in Panana.

Mr. Lodge described Bishop McGrath

as a real ball of fire, about 39 or 40 years old, born of

U. 8, parents in the Canal. Zone but he has taken Panama

eltzenship.

He graduated from Notre Dame University, did

graduate work in Rome and has taught in soreral European:

and. Latin American untversities,

such as in Chile.

He is

one of the three top Catholic prelates in Latin America

and has extremely close ties with the Vatican; 9. B., he 1s

on the Ecumenical Council and on the birth control group.

has an official operating budget of $2,000 per year which he

augments to every conced able source, particularly fron the

Gorman bishops.

He is politically and operationally minded,

an anorican completely in his attitude and behavior, a

typical Ixish politician, Mr. Lodge submitted somewhat

wryly.

His parents are retired and live in Mlant where he

visits often.

• He recently: met AMBIDDY-1 thora on two occasions.

On this sano visit he also net the Papal Nuncio from Santo

Domingo the appears to receive most of the hot potato type

assignments in his part of the world).

Veraguas Province of Panana 18 a selected testing

ground for community development programa in rurai areas.

It 18 tha joorest and most hopeless province of Panama,. a

mall arned uprising took place there in 1958 and was put

dors.

The Communists have their best organization in Panama

He 1s a dynamic

young man who has. lead the villagers to robuild their village

and church to develop their land and organize a cooperative

and shall credit lacilities.

The village is only 1,200

people but they raised by themselves $1,000 to buy materials

and then built a training center capable of housing, feeding

and training 60 men at a time in rural cooperatives and rural

development.

One

of their ideas is to select bright looking

leaders and potential leaders from rural

areas, first in

Panana and later, hopefully, from other nearby countries

for visits of a few days in which they hope to brain-wash

then of Communist type propaganda they may have heard and

show them what can actually be done so they can take the

good ward with them to their own communities.

This is in

addition to the regular formal course. of 4 nonths for

selected young potential leaders fron rural communities in

Panasa and all over Latin America.

3.

Another leading light in the progran is Father

Steele who was thrown out of Dominica by Trujillo for

organizing cooperatives and is a recognized authority on

the subject.

Father Steele uses

Veraguas as a home base

but travels

to Chile, Colombia and other countries conducting

short training courses on the ground.

There are some Dutch

priests ou the staff whom Bishop McGrath personally recruited.

Father Vasquez Pinto has sent about 10 to 15 local boys to

the Antigonish School in Nova Scotia and they are back for

auty.

Mr. Lodge describes the group as a highly motivated

and energatic group and Father Vasquez, Pinto as a young and

affective Panamanian priest who 1s a good operator.: Mr. Lodge

has two men from Harvard University there to study the

progran and assist in any way they can.

The Peace Corps has

SA poople in the Central Provinces of Panama, about 30 of

then in Veraguas Province.

They cooperate with the center,

In fact the two Harvard men are interviewing each of the.

Peace Corps volunteers about their work.: Mr. Lodge said they

aro coming up with some good information and ideas which other

wise would be lost as there 1s a gooä deal of experiance

among the Peace Corps kids but they don't know to recognize

this one.

They hope to be able to spot and develop leaders

in renuta arcas for tuture operations in those areas.

Incidental to these major objectives, they are also helping

to develop the econosy of Veraguas, to develop production,

transport to narkets, credit facilitles, and in general to

help alleviate grlevances which the Connunists have exploited

In the past.

S.

Bishop

IcGrath has arranged with AlKIDDY-1 for about

SIX OLAMBIDDY-l's people to attend the January 1966 training

course, with 3 or 1 to remain on the stail.

Hopefully, one

of them will develop into the executive director of the

center.

It was agreed that the first rin will not be too

closely associated in the public oye wita AlHIDDY-1 In order

to try to forestall initial bad pubilcity frey opposition

elements.

AMBIDDY-1 and Bishop McGrath agreed, therefore,

that Nestor IZQUIERDO (who is well known as a long-time

adherent of AHBIDDY-1 'Irom 1958-59 Comandos Rurales days

in Orlante) would not be assigned to the Panama center at

this time. AMBIDDY-1 told Bishop leGrath that he would try

to obtain sufficient funds to support the men assigned to the

center.

He has not yet brought up this matter with his case

officer, and as the amounts will be very small; he may try to

squeeze

It out of his newly authorized budget.

However, he

may ask the Agency for additional holp to sponsor these men

while they are working their way into the program.

It 18

Intended that the Cubans would continue to cooperation in the

program; eventually working them ints the field wherever they

are needed and acceptable.

Mr. Lodge will meet Bishop McGrath next in Panama

20 or 30

July.

•As. a. colncidence AMBIDDY-1 will probably

bo 1n or near Panama around the sane time, as he left 14 July

for Nicaragua, Costa Rica and Panama for meetings with their

presidents and several days vialt in each country.

In latr July 1965 members of the AMLILAC GrOup re-

ported the following information as a result of their contacts

with various members of AMYUM located in the JuNAVE area...

AMBIDDY-I has a warehouse in the WAVE area in

which he is storing equipment brought back from his Central

Anurican base.

The equipuent includes UDT gear, boat motors,

rafts, uniforms, and bulldozers. There are no weapons. In the

bullding.

AMBIDDY-1 is planning to put the BABUN PC into

proper condition for use as a Mother Vessel.

The vessel is

now In Tampa.. AMBIDDY-I spent over $10, 000. on this ship

last year.

that A-8 was the caretaker at one of the Bages in Central

Anarica along with? other men.

He stated that they had all

the weapons from the last effort and were preparing the camp

for re-activation.. AMBIDDY-1 told A-8 that $500,000. was

avallable for the reactivation.

The penchant of PBRUMEN exties for exaggeration,

SOMOZA, President SCHICK and other Nicaraguan

Officials, 21 Ju1-20 Aug 1965.

1. All first sot with General SOMOZA 27/28 July.

Tho following points were nade in these discussions:

General SOMOZA sald the Stato Department is

making an Investigation of how much money he is using to control

the government and win the next presidential elections.

SOMOZA

told All that he intended to run and fully expected to win the

election,

but would not necd to buy any votes.

He asked All to

please tell

"Washington" that State is very clumsy and if they

really want to know anything they should call on the Agensaid

the FBI, either of which is much more effective.

everybody in Managua knows about State's efforts to block his

candidacy and are laughing at them.

SOMOZA suld he was meeting Daniel @DUBER of

Costa Rica at the border shortly, and they rould make a "non-

REgression pact" agreeing that neither will nake trouble for

the other's canpaign for election to Presidency.

ODUBER had

asked for the interview..

SOMOZA told All that he thought

ODUBEs had made a

"live and let live" agreement with the Com-

munists, and that at their meeting,

he would demand from ODUBER

a public denunciation of the Communiats to be followed by

eff-ctive control

measuren.agalngt them.

The MRR will be allowed to build and operate

mall boatjard for construction, mintenance and repair of

shrimp boats at Blueflelds without SOlOzA or the Nicaraguan

d. Goneral SOMOZA, at A/l's strong recommendation,

agreed to start pushing Civic Action prograns through the National

Guard in an effort to enhasce his persoual inage preparatory to

the next Presidential campaign. SOMOZA asked All to assist and

advise

in this effort.

2.

next meeting with General SOMOZA by A/I was

on & August, with following points:

SOMOZA said that the latest program of Fidel

CASTRO 18 targetted against Nicaragua, Costa Rica and Panama.

Par; of the plan includes assassination of the presidents of

the three countries as part of a terror campaign to soften

them up.

He said that in Panama, particularly, President

Marcos ROBLES is a prime target but the Communists are exploiting

& recent turn against him by the. National Guard because he has

cut down on their costs, pensions, and other privileges:

If

NOBLES 1g eliminated from power, the Communists feel the chief

of tha National Guard will take over and they thinky they:

can handle him more easily than they can ROBLEs.

Source for above, according to SOMOZA, was a

Close associate of Marcial AGUILUZ, whom he described as the

top

Communist in Costa Rica and one who had recruited (fnu) FONSECA,

• Nicaraguan now living in Mexico.

FONSECA is a bastard son of

one of SOHOZA's foremen,,

a Communist, ari an agent working.

alrectly under order of

Fidel CASTRO.

A/1 and SOMOZA talked again about a Civic

Action program in Nicaragua and SOMOZA said again that he would

support 1t.

He will assign Father LUGO, & Cuben priest who

served with

the Bay of Pigs' forces, to a position similar to a

chaplain in the National Guard in order to assist in the program.

SOMOZA will support MRR community development prograns with

shataver authorizations are required and with whatever officlal

or personal prestige he may offer.

9. M/1 next returned to lianagua on IT August and met

11th Major PEREZ of the Nicaraguan Customs Service, a pergonal alde

to the teners!.

Piss Bald SOMOLA waS vEry angry (not at All or

his paralo)

and difficult to see:

He said 3 Colonels were. under

arrest for 3 daya each for disobeying orders.

PEREZ was afraid

to Bee SOMOZA for fear he might be arrested

4130.

However, A/1

sallod soworn by phone and was invitod to viait him next day

at tipitapa.

All met him the next day (18 Aug) and had lunch

with SOMOZA and (Inu) BENITEZ, a Puerto Rican, former politician

there who

it now in business but remaing in contact with and

working for the l. S. Coverancat. Alter lunch, BENITEz left

and All went with SOMOZA in his car. Thile they vere ridini,

SOMOZA tOld All uhy he cas 5o angry.

d.

A nessage had recently cone to General

SOlOZA from the

Nicaraguan Ambassador in Panans saying that he

had it fros authoritative sources thal. the ü.S. not only

would not support his candidacy for the Presidency, but would

strongly oppose it.

In addition, SOMOZA had word that Sydney

ROSS,

Director of El Tiempo (Spanish language newspaper in

New York), after a recent interview with Asst. Secretary Jack

Vaughn of

the State Department, had an off-the-record talk

wIth VAUGHN after the

intervier.

VAUGHN had sald that, so far

as he was concerned, SOLOZA was no different from the other

Latin American dictators such as TRUJILLO, PERON, DUVALIER.

STROESSNER, Col. LOPEZ, or GeD. CASTELL Branco, and that he

could certainly

not support installing another

In Nicaragua.

The two reports were confirmatory in SOMOZA's

nind and nade him feel extremely bad as he said he has always

talked favorably about the U.S. and tried to cooperate with them

at every chance.

і ск до!!

military dictator

SOMOZA checked with the U.S. Ambassador in

Hicaragus (whether in person or by

sending Pres. SCHICK was

not made clear) about the matter, and received a typical State

Department reply that the U.S. was neutral in Nicaraguan internal

affairs and would take no action about the elections.. The

Ambassador said he could not belleve. VAUGHN could have nade

nuch statenents because of the U.S, position of neutrality in

Nicaraguan affoirs.

SOMOZA also said he had sent a message to

Washington suggesting that if some of the other countries heard

about thenselves being lumped with TRUJILLO, PERON, etc.

they

might well call back their troops from Santo Domingo and tell

¡ Washington to go to hell.

He said he was going aheld with his plans

regardless of what the U.S, does about it and reminded All of

HT. J. C. KING's talk with him (SOMOZA) at the airport in

Washingion to jet hit know after tha mistin sttack on the

SIERRA ARANZAZU that Washington would undergiand If SOMOZA

docided to kick A'l and his camps out of Nicaragua.

He usad

this as an example of an attempt from Mashington to dictase

to him which he

had ignored,

telling All that he was a friend,

would continue. to he, and would continue to make his own

deoisions regardless

of whet Washington might want from han.

All nade another strong suggoation that SOMOZA take off his.

undform and start making publio his civia action ideas.

In

addition, he again advised him to go peracially to Washington

to tal& directly with VAUGHN and other U. S. officials to get

the picture cleared up. All said,

"Let's try to get along

with the Norteamericans, it's better to have then with

us

than againet us."

SOMOZA agreed, but said he had sent his

brother, Luls SOMOZA, ahead.

h.

me following day, 19 Aug, General SOMOZA:

called A/l and said Luis had called him, reporting he had

talked to Vaughn in Miaml. Said Vaughn had denled talking to

Bydney ROSS or of passing such information to the Ambassador

In Panana. Luis said he dropped the subject at that point and

talked

about other things.

(A/1 belleves juis could be

Iabricating as usual or could have botched up the interview 1f

1t did take place.

A/l again strongly recommended that General

SOMOZA make his own visit to washington and talk to Vaughn and

others in

person.

On 19 Aligust, A/1 Interviewed President SCHICK

for: the Tridente

(MRR news magazine).

He had previously

Interviewed General SOMOZA.. The interview reports will be

rolatively innocuous coverage of some of the major events of

the day.

The agenda of points for each interview is attached.

All intends to dedicate an issue of Tridente to each country

which has helped the MRR, e.&. Nicaragua,

Costa Rica, Panana,

ment In Costa Rica.

In early July, subject told Col. RuIz H.

Foreign Minister ODUBER and other Costa Rican

officials, late July to uid-August 1965.

1.

In late July, A/l went to Costa Rica and net with

President ORLICH, telling him the MIRR was out of business so far

as operations directly against Cuba are concerned, and no longer

i needs bases, money,

or other support for such paramilitary

-activitles.

A/l described the

latest MRR program to. combat

CASIRO/Connunist efforts in Latin America by engaging in

community development and counter-insurgency activities.

. He

asked only for help in projecting a progressive and constructive

Image and some basic prestige for the MRR and for himself.

TO

that end, he reminded President ORLICH that both of then knew

Iull vell that in the whiskey smuggling scandals and coup

attempts for which A/l had taisen the rap, not only was he not

guilty, but had been,

in fact, the first

one to give the warning

in both cases.

In return for

those past favors, he now wants.

PreS. ORLICH to put him together with Daniel ODUBER (the PLN

candidate for president who will almost certainly be elected)

in order to counteract the bad-mouth put on a/l to ODUBER byy...

"Yo-yo" QUIROZ..

no con a Te, are let him make up his

proposed to meet ODUBER personally,

own mind. Pres. ORLICH called ODUBER's office,

but he was off

politicking on the coast.

ORLICH then sent A/l with Colonel

LIPPA (& good friend of A/1) to talk with ODUBER's secretary,

who algo is a good friend of Col. LIPPA.

The secretary (actually

a male assistant) said everybody talks about A/1 but nobody really

knows him or very much about him. Some good liberal revolutiona-

rles say he is a good man, otheis say he 1a a s. O. B.

A/1

replied that was the reason he had taken the trouble

to come to

that he would make his position clear himself and

wairo to biad to confront any eccusers li CHUBER so desired.

The secretary said they were concerned about the campaign

because

On 8 and 9 August, All was again in Costa Rica

and net with ODUBER, this meeting was arranged by ¿oberto

MADRIZ.

ODUBER admitted that he knew the Cubans were not

guilty of the smuggling charges that had been levied against

then.

He also appreciated A/l's previous refusals to assist

coup plotters and his help in squelching thei? efforts. All

Bald he told ODUBER,

"I Inow you have been told I an a s. o. B.

and I want you to see for yourself what I am and tidie up your

mind.

I know the people who have so described me and would

Ilke to meet you together with them so you can make your own

judgement."

All said these opening remarks brought on

ODUBER's replies about the smuggling and coup reports.

All sald he gave ODUBER a quick history of the

IRR, what 1t has done,

and what it stands for.

All told him that the MiR people had heard

of & Communist plot tc rap ODUBER by walting to the strategic

moment and making & wiaely publicised declaraiion that they

are supporting him completely.

This would split the PLN and might

lose the elcotion for onuser, thus putting in a weak or reactio-

•ary group whom the Communists could
