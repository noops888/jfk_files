always amazed to find the equipment in use and functloning sub-

stantially as il was on the day il wis installed. " The reviewing

official for the same fitness report commented that-.."The

Station necds him, cannel do without him and cannot find any

fault in his performance. "

ollowing summary re MrSFuck's performance of duties

upport of his recommendation for an avard for Mr. Flick)

Fucky performance has been consistently evaluated at

strong to outstanding level. Is many ratin officers over the

years have each reached the conclusion that it would be all but

impossible lo find a replacement that would be able to deal with

all aspecte of his joh as well a@lick some concluded that Fllck '3

was Irreplaccable. 3(uck)has successfully maintained a high-

cvel rapport and an excellent working relationship with the COM ≥ 4

officials concerned with the intercept center's opcration for

24 Chirteen)years - a unique achicement in itself = despite

cIrcumstances that would not have been tolerated by others of

lesser ability and dedication.

Through personal initiative and

perseverance Click has enanted the Agency lo accrue substantial

savtigs of funde by maintaining obsolete equipment in excellent

operaling condition, Because of flick's exceptional capabilities

ind efforts, the center achievedan oulstanding record of on-line

time and production despite the age and condition of the equipment

and facilities available. By consistem application of diligent

and unselfish professional efforts, Flick turned a relatively

routine technical assignment into a highly productve joint 2 4

operation of sustained operational and intelligence production

value to the Station and to the Agency. "

In summary, Mr. (her)has performed his duties at the

telephone intercept center in Mexico City for (he(past thirtcen) 24

years in a truly dedicated, professional, and outstanding manner.

This outstanding performance of duty. over such an extended

period of time is a credit to Mr. flick and certainly worthy of

the award recommended herein as he retires from the Agency.
