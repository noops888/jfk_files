attention to previous traffic relating to Lee Harvey OSWALD and

able photographs in the Station which might be of the assassin. The

- 1] October who could (might] by identical with OSWALD.

that OSWALD of the Fair Play for Cuba Committee had participated in

a debate in August 1963 on the New Orleans radio station, WDSU.

OSWALD was a former Marine who had gone to Moscow in 1959 where he

renounced his American citizenship. [WAVE-8049 (IN 66782)]

-c. On 23 November, the Chief, SR/CI forwarded a memorandum

to the Assistant Deputy Director, Plans, in which the latter's atten

tion was drawn to the fact that OSWALD had been in contact on_ 28

September 1963 with Soviet Consul Valeriy Vladimirovich KOSTIKOV.

According to current information available to SR/CI, KOSTIKOV was a

known KGB officer and considred to be a member of the KGB's Thir-

(sabotage and assassination)

teenth Départment/of the First, Chief Directorate. According to the

FBI liaisón officer, the FBI had reason to believe that OSWALD's

visit was to get Soviet support for a United States passport or visa

matter. Chief, SR/CI closed by saying that he had reported OSWALD's

connections with a known member of the Thirteenth Department to the

FBI liaison officer at 1030 hours on 23 November 1963.

(Memorandum for ADDP, 23 November 1963 (file nO. SX-25550)}

d. Qn,23 November, the Mexico City Station forwarded to Head-

quarters the names of three persons who had flown from Mexico, to the

United States, during the first twelve days of November, who might

have been identical with Lee Harvey OSWALD. [MEXI-7020 (IN 66891)]

e. On 24 November, the Mexico City Station reported to Head-

quarters that the United States Consulate in Nuevo Laredo had infor-

mation that OSWALD had entered Mexico at Nuevo Laredo on 26 Septem-

ber traveling on Mexican Tourist Card no. 24085 and had left Mexico

by auto [sic] on 3 October 1963 at Nuevo Laredo. [MEXI-7040 (IN

-67261)]

f. On 24 November, the Chief, SR/CI, forwarded a memorandum

to the Assistant Depauty Director, Plans, in which he quoted a cable

sent by Chief, sR Division, who was, at that time, In Frankfurt.

The latter asked the question if OSWALD was not unwittingly of

wittingly a part of a plot to murder the president in Dallas as, an-

attempt to exacerbate further sectional strife and render the United

States Government less capable of dealing with soviet initiatives

over the next year. The Chief of SR continued-by suggesting that

if AELADLE's. (Anatoliy Mikhaylovich GOLITSYN) views on (Harold)

WILSON and the information noted in paragraph Ic below have any

substance (and they cannot be ignored), this suggests that we can

expect major Soviet pressures over the next several months, for :

which the Soviets have made careful, lon-range preparations.

Paragraph 1a:

"Within minutes of the first news, Moscow radio

statements as heard in London attributed the assassina-

tion to 'right-wing elements'. Only as the true iden-

tity of the believed assassin became known did Moscow

begin to complain that United States reactionaries

were using OSWALD; as a pawn."

Paragraph lb:

"Should not the assignment of 13th Department officers

to the KGB Residency in the United Nations in New York

bo considered in a new light?"

Paragraph lci

06, 29

-"I discovered from Arthur MARTIN MI- 5J during our

long and exceptionally valuable discussions, that

one of Harold WILSON's principal scientific advisers

is Captain Ian MAXWELL, who has a long Soviet intelli-

gence background.

This may shed new light on AELADLE'S

report, i.e., that Harold WILSON may be a Soviet agent."

Chief, SR/CI, pointed out that the SR Chief's comments come

without benefit of traces passed earlier to the ADDP sowing that

OSWALD had contact with a 13th Department representative in Mexico-

City. Chief, SR/CI, ended by indicating that another recently ar-

rived cable suggests that OSWALD's business with the Soviet Consul

was connected with his own visa to the USSR and Cuba and may,

therefore, have been innocent. (Memorandum for ADDP,

21 November 1963 (file 70, SX-25598)}

§: On 24 November, the Agency's Station-in Miami reported

information received from the local FBI representative.

The latter

had received a request from his Headquarters to ascertain the vera-

city, including sources, of a statement made by DRE leader, Jose

LLANUSA Gobel, to the effect that Fidel CASTRO had threatened lives

of United States leaders in the event of United States aggression

against Cuba. LLANUSA attributed the above threats to Fidel CASTRO

who made these remarks during a reception in early September 1963

at the Brazilian Embassy in Havana. [WAVE-8133 (IN 67394)]

h. On 25 November 1963, the Mexico City Station also called

Headquarters' attention to an AP story datelined Havana, 7 September

1963. At a reception held at the Brazilian Embassy, CASTRO is :

quoted as haveing said: "We are prepared to fight them and answer

in kind. United States leaders shouldthink Isic - consider ?] that

if they are aiding terrorist: plans to eleminate the Cuban leaders,

they themselves will not be safe." IMEXI-7055. IN 67620)]
