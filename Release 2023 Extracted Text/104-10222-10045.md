At first glance I find

the ratings in Section B high and wonder

how he would compare with other

technicians doing the same work even

though he is performing in a very professional manner.

technical standpoint he has kept the operation alive through

perseverance, hard work and a high degree of technical proficiency.

His ability to got alcng with his Mexican contacts and the degree of

respect they have for him is very commendable.

Not having the

opportunity to compare him with other technicians, doing the same job

under identical circumstances, it is difficult to find a fair rating.
