He said

the only evidence

against ORLANDO BOSCH AVILA during

his trial for extortion

was that the threatening notes had

been typed on a type-

writer to which BOSCH had access.

For this reason, when

Cuban lover had something to write, they rented a type-

writer at the cost of $30.00 for the purpose.

GONZALEZ

said that different persons rented typewriters from

different places in order

to elude the investigative

efforts of the FBI (S8)W4)

GONZALEZ said that Cuban Pover was preparing news

releases which would be sent to the local news media that

night (February Y). According to GONZALEZ, the MIRR and

ORLANDO BOSCH AVILA were preparing an important work

about Cuba" which would reaffirm the position of the MIRR

so that there would be no connection between the MIRR and

Cuban Power.

GONZALEZ said this action would allay the
