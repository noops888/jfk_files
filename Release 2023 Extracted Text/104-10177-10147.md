In Raid and Ambush Exercises).

FILIPE - Filipe has had no previous demolition training but indicated he

had worked with explosives against Government units. His practical

work was a little sloppy, not from lack of care but because he was

not able to work too well with his hands. The practical work did

not show any progress from commencement to completion of the

course but his placements were well made and effective. He seemed

to understand all subject matter covered and always answered test

type questions correctly.

Whenever crimping detonators, 'his hands

were very shaky but he did not seem to be nervous at any other time

during the course.

Close supervision was required when he was

crimping detonators. He was a cooperative, interested student

who reacted well to correction. He seemed to enjoy the training

and offered several new methods of attack based on personal experience.

Filipe was rated overall as proficient.
