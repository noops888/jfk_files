INDEX

1. Authorization is hereby requested for the project described

below, whica ke plan to initiste on 1 June 1949.

In view cf

the comment contained in parsgrach 2 of refereuced communi-

cation,

assuning that cemencement of this project ce

a simple exploratory basis has already been approred by head-

"o further coumitrents, other than those descriced

below, will be made.

ho Objectives

(1) Cutout services, as suggested by headquarters,

an effort to

test Subject's abilities.

(2) As a basic and continuing assignent to permit

and enccurage developent of subject's best

local contacts as weil as in the hope of filling

a long-felt need in cur operational petiern, he

will be assigned to the general topic of labor;

specifically,

communist penetrstion of local

no-communist labor groups and theoretical

developments which are of interest regardless

of eroup designation.

(3)

Subject appears to be genuinely interested and

to possess an usual appreciation for coerational

ways and meang, which is seldem encountered.

For this reason, none of his assignments will

ba exclusive, and he will be encouraged to follow

up such leads end opportunities as arise in the

course of his daily occupations regardless of

any objective and target assignments.

LAMENZED

B. Targets

(1)

Subject will comence by serving as cutout for

who has always held out great promise but

never been properly developed or airected.

(2)

In the labor field, the principal and only target

at the moment is the only labor federation, the

Rorun Kovaruw.

(3)

Subject will

represent our only contact among the

student groups and certain allied "intellectual"

societies.

Any activity in this category showing

promise may subsequently becone an assigned target.

C. Cryptonym and Essential Data on Personnel

The designation "Hydropathic", heretofore applied to

subject individual, is hsreby discarded.

heresfter be designated by San Jose Station Symbol

For essential data on personnel, see TZP-A-365,

Pare I and II.

D. Control and Contact

Judging by Subject's background data and his already

denonstrated cooperative attituds, we do not feel that

control and direction of his activities will be any

problem. Contact, owine to the nature of this project,

frequent and carried out in any convenient

manner, generally in one of the other of our rescective

I. Cover

Subjact had planned to and has established himself in

Costa Rica for entirely personal reasons, prior to any

contact with this office.

He has a Costa Rican wife,

attends the university, and lives a perfectly normal

11fe which any assignents from us will not disrupt.

Our only anticipated problem is that of moutine contacts

between Subject and the Chief of Station.

will be handled with care and discretion.

Meet matter

F. Cost

Subject has agreed to serve for a

salary equivalent

Varont 28

$50.00 per month, to be paid in colones. Io offset

this expensa ne plan to dispense with the servicos of

Hucklebone who 1s presently receiving $400.00 per tonth.

G. Timing and other Factors

Our preliminary Interviews with Subject lead us to

believe that he will be the interested and relis ble

American cutout

for which this station has long felt

a need.

His greatest virtue in this respect appears

to be an understanding of operational nethods and an

appreciation of relative valus with respect to infor-

cation.

It is hoped to make this a permanent project,

but our plans and our arrangemens with Subject are

considered to be probationary, dependent entirely

upon his development and future usefulness.

On qualifications - there just

I got the degree (5 years). However

not cover? specialized in Econonie

Theory, wrich when considered that I studied in three batin

American Universities (Costa Rica

Guatemala and Cuba) does

give me some qualification as a. "Latin American Consultant".

The classification as "Research Analyst" is cover except

for that part of which the "Latin American" background could

be utilized.

Although I have had no business experience in an admiristrative

utilizing my Spa ish language ability.

As you can see by the above, unfortunately there is no

com ercial "counterpart" for the

type of work I have been doing

for 15 years or more. My feeling is that we should consult the

"local outplacement"

nan first, on the possibility that there is

a local opportunity, but the oportunities in the vatin American

field whill be greater.

(In acdition to the above, I might add that I have performed

best in

"operations" work"- which involves planning, direction.and

coordination.)

1. The Station would appreciate any information which Headquarters can

provide concerning an ETD for Harold R. NOEMAYR and his family and an

ETA for NOEMAYR's replacement. NOENAYR's tentative ETD of I January

1960 is only slightly more than one month away and he has visas to obtain in

addition to other departure preparations.

2. NOEMAYR was instructed by the Station to proceed with the necessary

correspondence with Mexican, Costa Rican, Cuban, and Panamanian authorities

for the required police certificates for his wife since she is not a citizen of

PBF RIME and is applying for an Immigrant Visa. He has already received the

necessary documents from Costa Rica and Cuba and expects to obtain the

Mexican certificate within the next two days. No reply from Panama has been

received as yet although it should arrive shortly. As soon as the Panamanian

clearance and that from Mexico is obtained, NOEMAYR will submit all papers

to the local ODACID installation and request the necessary documentation for

the travel of himself and his family. As Headquarters is aware, the Immigrant

Visa for NOEMAYR's wife will be valid only so long as she travels within four

months of the date issued.

3. An early reply to this dispatch would be appreciated.

I SPECInC®- Arthur G, VAIVADA

DATE

17 January 1957

Reference: HAVA 755

1. Discussions of the whole problem of VAIVADA's early TDY to Headquarters.

were held between the agent, the fleld case officer,

and the Chief of Station on

13 and lu January, as a reault of which it becane clear that, unless Headquerters

has a compelling reason to the contrary, it would be aduisable that the conten-

plated TDY be postponed until about the end of VAIVADA's current contract year,

1.e., the perlod of July-August 1957.

2. A number of Important personal problems dispose VIAVADA to accept the

delay In acquiring staff status that would accrue from such a postponement.

wife 1s sufficiently 11l at this tine from a form of nervous colltis as to recou-

mend that she not travel now. His children would have to lose a semester of

their schooling since the current semester began on 7 January. Moreover as he

and fandly have resided in tropical areas for a number of years, VAIVADA would

have to make a rather large financial outlay to purchase needed vinter clothing

for himself and his fantly which does not seem justified for a period as short

as tho months.

Owing to several routine but time-consuming Inquiries being made

by the local ODACID in connection with his wife's visa asplication, there is no

guarantee that VAIVADA would be able to depart Cuba before February 1957.

3. On the operational side, in softe of the original Station request that

VAIVADA's trevel be expedited,

advantages now of delaylog his TDY outweigh the

disadvantages, fron the Station's point of view. Most important of these is that

two prozising sources currently under development by the Station, namely AMPRODARCH-

6 and AIYHODARCH-10, were originally contacted by VAIVADA and he has since been

the person working most closely with them.

To substitute hia with a relatively

untrained cut-out at this point in their development 1s not desirable. On the

basis of the original proposed timing of bis trip the Station has however proceeded.

with Mrm plans. to transfer handling of two other sources, AMPHODASCH-1 and AMBI-

VALENT-5, to a rellable PBPRIME cut-out. This plan can be initiated whether

VAIVADA departs now or later, and provides the ideal opportunity to take two low-
