Keenan v. U.S.DoJ & CIA

Barry,

1. Request that your office conduct a search to determine whether it has any records containing the name of Laurence P.

KEENAN (d.o.b. 23 Nov 1924; p.o.b. Dover, NH; SSN 002-16-7106). Since this request is pursuant to a lawsuit under FOlA and the

Privacy Act, all that is required is a search reasonably calculated to locate the responsive records. An index search-should be sufficient

no hand search is necessary.

2. KEENAN was an FBI agent who claims to have been involved with investigating Lee Harvey OSWALD's purported contact

with Cuban and Soviet agents in Mexico City. The CIA's IP&CRD office responded to Keenan that no records indexed by his name were

located, but I am unsure whether your office was tasked with the initial request.

3. Please do not hesitate to contact me via Lotus Notes or on x76135 if I may be of further assistance. Thanks.

Michael
