MEMORANDUM FOR:

Mr. John M. Reeves

Chief, External Affairs Branch

Office of Security

FROM

:

Richard S. Sampson

Chief, Latin America Division

SUBJECT

: Mr. David Phillips' Manuscript

1. Following are comments on chapters 2, 5 and 11 of

this manuscript which have been reviewed in LA Division:

2. Chapter M

a.

The portion

on the terrorist kidnapping in the

Dominican Republic in 1974 (pages

38-41) should be

deleted for the following reasons:

(1) This incident is still fresh in the minds

of most Dominicans, and it is unrealistic to assume

that it will not be picked up and published in the

local press.

SarDaTa HUtChISOn, USIA, one of the

people kidnapped, is still in the Dominican Republic,

and according to

two fairly recent reports, is again

being considered as a target for kidnapping.

The

potential for terrorist acts against US citizens

continues, three top leaders of terrorist-oriented

groups are currently in prison, and publication of

this item could propel the terrorists into action.

(2) The close link between the Ambassador and

the CIA which the author portrays could be prejudicial

to his public image and might even provoke the

terrorists to target against him.

# 24

The Station has renewed

a liaison relationship

that was suspended after a local

change in command

and much effort is being directed toward developing

a relationship of mutual confidence. The revelation

of this information on an obvious joint operation

by the then Chief, LA, might lead our (increasingly24

friendly liaison) contacts to wonder whether we

might be able to maintain confidence on future

operations, and possibly jeopardize this relation-

ship.

(4) Although the bugging of the thermos was

discovered and appeared in the press, the use of

the Coca Cola case did not receive such exposure

and therefore continues to be an option for the

such exposure

->future, at least as far as the (Dominican Republic) Wi

Perhaps

the author should be reminded

of a cable that was written during his tenure as

operation:

BE CAUTIONED TO HOLD EXISTENCE THIS OP TIGHTLY AS

POSSIBLE TO LEAVE OPEN CHANCE USE THIS PLOY IN FUTURE

CASES AS WELL AS PREVENT ADVERSE ACTION BY PRESENT

KIDNAPPERS."

Reference the author's footnote (page 39)

that "Philip Agee long ago revealed...

•" this technique,

Agee's revelation is certainly no criteria for further

disclosure.

b.

The passage regarding CIA's role in countering

terrorist activity abroad

should be deleted.

The author

singles out the Agency as "Only CIA, of American agencies

abroad, is uniquely charged with countering these activi-

ties".

charged viyn

This could only increase the targetting of our

personnel by terrorists, and possibly lead

to another

Welsh-type incident.

The author's confirmation of Agee's identification

of CIA personnel should be deleted as well as the author's

information on the disruption of Agency operations which

resulted from Agee's exposes

Undoubtedly

Agee and his ilk would be delighted with this gratis exposure

and derive satisfaction in having it made known to the

public, by one with first-hand knowledge, what impact

exposes have on CIA operations, morale, etc.

Y and leaves the reader pretty well convinced that there

was involvement in the latter (pages 5, 16, 30).

e. The following passages should be cleared with

the appropriate Agency components:

(1) SE Division: The operation against the

KGB (page 36). This operation took place in Mexico,

(2) NE Division: The Arab terrorist activity

in "Costa Brava" - which is Venezuela - and follow-up

information involving the Middle East, and apparently

a telephone-tap operation (pages 36-38).

f. The author notes (page 4) that more is being

written on Chile operations.

It is requested that this

item'be submitted for review by this Division prior to

publication.

3. Chapter 54

a.

There are no passages which we can require be

deleted.

b. The following passages should be cleared with

the appropriate Agency components:

(1) Reference to the Gulf

Steamship Company

being used as a cover for

the broadcast aspects of

the Bay of Pigs operation (pages 12 and 22). When

checking this passage with Mr. Gordon Wohl,

asked that a copy of the manuscript be sent to hike

component for review.

ident i ed by

. Use of a New York public relations firm (not

identified by name) which was "responsive to CIA

control" (page 32).

Other books and publications have

identified the Lem Jones Associates as having handled

the public relations aspects, but nowhere have we

found it alleged to have been CIA-controlled.

Some

articles indicate that there is actually a Mr. Lem

Jones, who was president of the firm.

Perhaps the

author's allegation that it was CIA-controlled should

be deleted.

Again, no passages were found for which there is
