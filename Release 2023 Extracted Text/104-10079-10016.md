This request

was made orally to you on th Tuesday, August 30, and Mr. Holmes

Mr. HALL on Thursday, September 1.

3. BLAKEY Letter; 28 Sept 77 re discrepancy on what Holmes provided

ref: Blakey letter of October 3, 1977 asking to be informed as to ni

whether any relationship existed between Mr. Loran HALL and the CIA.

A diligent search of our files fails to disclose any record of any

relationship whatsoever between the CIA and Mr. Hall either as an

employee or an independent contractor.

...fails to disclose any record of any secrecy agreement....so

far as this Agency is concerned we see no reason at this time

Mr. Hall sbould not feel free to fully respond to any inquiry from
