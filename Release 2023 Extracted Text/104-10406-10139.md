ANNEX B

THE 201 SYSTEM

Rescission: Anner B of Chapter III, CSHB 70-1-I, 27 October 1966

1. INTRODUCTION

The 201 system provides a method for identifying a person of specific in-

terest to the Operations Directorate and for controlling and filing all pertinent

information about that person. The system also provides a means for identifying

subjects of 201 files from various categories of information about them and for

producing lisits of 201 personalities according to those categories. Only a rela-.

tively small number of personalities indexed are of sufficient interest to justify

opening a 201 dossier. These are normally subjects of extensive reporting and

CI investigation, prospective agents and sources, members of groups and organi-

zations of continuing target interest, or subjects on whom a volune of corre-

spondence has accumulated.

2. THE 201 SYSTEM

The principal features of the 201 system are:

a. The 201 Number: a unique number, i.e., 201-1234567, assigned to each

individual in the system to serve as identifying file number for reporting on that

individual.

b. The 201 Dossier: the official file containing the 201 opening form (Form

S31) and all biographic reporting on and references to the individual, i.e., per-

sonal history, current status, and prospects.

c. The Master 201 Record: a machine record generated by the opening of

a 201 file. This record produces the master 201 reference for the Main Inder and

stores the pertinent information which may later be retrieved' for special listings.

d. Main Inder Muster 201 Reference: this reference, printed in reply to an

Inder Search Request, is printed as illustrated below.

When data are absent

within the record, succeeding data items or lines will be inoved up and the ref-

erence consolidated.

e. Ol Code: a two letter symbol used in conjunction with the 201 per-

sonality records in the 201 system to record the association of an individual

with organizations or activities of operational interest. Ol codes cover intelli-

gence and security service affiliation, whether staff or agent, or known or

suspect, as well as activities of DDO interest There are tio categories of OI

codes for use by components:

(1) general Ol codes (Attachment 4)

(2) Oi codes assigned to a specific component for intelligence services

or other specific organizations.

A, 201 personality may be assigned to O1 codes. An OI code may be assigned

when the 201 Personality, File Action Request (Form 831) is initiated (see

paragraph 3b below) by filling in Box 13 or a code may be assigned or added

ait a later date by a Form 831 amendment.

The 201 system has the capability of producing machine listings of 201'

personalities by OI codes. For example, if an Ol code has been opened for the

security service of a certain country a listing may be compiled of all members

f. 201 Machine Lists: produced from the mechanized 201 Index, based on

names or other identifying information of personalities on whom 201 dossiers

exist.

3. OPENING A 201 DOSSIER

a. General

The opening of a 201 dossier is the prerogative of an operational.com-

porient, in coordination with the Information Services Group. An opening creates

a master 201 record. Changes to the master record and the occasional closing

of a 201 dossier are controlled jointly by the desks and ISG. 201 dossiers may be

opened on persons who meet the carding criteria described in Chapter II of this

handbook, when there is a reasonable expectation that auditional information

will be acquired and filed in such a dossier. Generally dossiers are opened on

persons about whom counterintelligence information is being reported, and ser

sors of operational interest to the Operations Direciorate, specifically those

persons for whom provisional operational approvals and operational approvals

are requested (see exception below). 201 files are not to be opened on siait

emplojaes, staif agents and most categories of contract employees. Files on

persons who are only of local interest to a field station or Headquarters desk

and on whom no DDO records correspondence exists are not a part of the DDO!

records systém and are to be maintained by that unit. Some desks levy require-

ments on ISG for automatic 201 openings on certain categories of persons whose

names appear in incoming dispatches. These are listed in Attachment 2 201.

dossiers should be opened in the following categories:

(1) Subjects of provisional operational approval and operational ap-

proval requests. However, a file need not be opened when a POA is requested

for persons being trained for a foreign liaison service and who are of opera-

tional interest for training purposes only.

(2) Persons for swhom the field requests a 201 opening:

(3) MHFIXTURE personalities:

bonafide diplomats of other than

denied area countries, in close association with staff personnel.

(4) Subjects of a Personal Record Questionnaire Part I.

(5) Persons on whom a Main Inder search reveals information in five

or more documents (see DOI 70-20).

(6) Subjects of Interagency Source Register memoranda from LSN/

ISR (opened only by IP/RVS).

b. Requesting a 201 File Opening

Headquarters desks may open a 201 file by filling out and submitting

a 201 Personality File Action Request (Form 831) to the Records Main-

tenance Section (IP/RVS). Form 831 is also used to create or amend the

master 201 record and 201 machine listings and to register the assign-

ment of a cryptonym to a 201 personality. Attachment 3 consists of sample

201 Personality File Action Requests for opening and amending 20l's. A field

station may request the opening of a 201 file by writing 201- in the Head-

quarters file or cross-reference box on the dispaich form and/or after the

subject's name in the body of the dispatch. A telepouch request for a 201 opening

is made by indicating 201- in the file number line. A cable request is made by

placing 201- after the term. "File" on the last line of the transmission. IP/AV

will open 201 files as requested by dispatch or telaporch but it is the responsi-

bility of the des! to respond to cable requests. Field stations are notified of

201 openings through receipt of the field master 201 record

CHAPTER III, ANNEX B

15 November 1974

All standard. listings are cumulative; previous editions must be destroyed

upon receipt of current editions. These listings are by their very nature extremely

sensitive compilations of information and must be given every possible safeguard.

b. Non-Standard Listings

Based on one or more of the following selection criteria:

(1) Country of location

(2) OI codes (organization and/or intelligence affiliation)

(3) Citizenship

(4). Year of birth (plus or minus a given number of years)..

(5) Occupation

These selection criteria may be used singly or in combinations. For example,

a user could obtain a list of all 201 personalities who have been assigned the

OI code of XX or codes of XX, XY, or XZ. A 201 personality list could also be

produced of all persons who were born in Germany between the years 1915

and. 1920, with the occupation computer specialist; who are now citizens of the

United States, located in Mexico, and who had been assigned the OI code AA.

Note however that the listing would contain only those personalities with an

OI code AA. Those personalities with an OI code other. than AA and those

with no Ol code would be excluded. The requester could however ask that

persons who have not been assigned an OI code also be included. Note also

that when retrieving lists based on occupation, the listing will be only as specific

as the occupation code (Attachment 1). The occupation code for a courier

covers only a documented courier. Some occupation codes cover more than one

occupation. For example, the occupation code CRAF covers those who practice

some trade or manual occupation, i.e., carpenters; bricklayers, painters, mechanics

and electricians. If a list is requested for electricians, all others in this category.

will be included in the printout. These non-standard listings may be sorted

(arranged) according to any, but not more than three, of the following keywords:

(a) Surname

(b) Given name

(c) Date of birth

(d) Country of birth

(e) Citizenship

(f) OI code

ANNEX B

PERSONALITIES - 201 AND IDN NUMBERS

1. A relatively small proportion of the total number of personall-

ties indexed by the CS are of active operational interest at any given

point in time. These are normally subjects of extensive reporting and

CI investigation, prospective agents and sources, and members of

groups and organizations of contruing target interest. Each of these

personalities is assigned either a 201 number or an IN number.

2. The 201 number serves a dual purpose. It brings the files on

these personalities into the CS records system. A single number,

e.g., 201-123456, is assigned to each person, and a dossier controlled

by this number is established which contains, or has cross referenced

to it, all of the reporting on the individual's personal history, current

status and prospects. Once the 201 number is assigned, it is used in

future reporting on the individual both as a file number and in, place of

other identifying data. Up-to-date machine listings are published

periodically to help field stations and headquarters desks keep book

on those 201 personalities falling in their particular geographic or

- functional area of interest.

3. It has become apparent that the 201 machine listings shouid in-

clude the identities of persons of operational interest because of their

connection with a target group or organization even bough there may

not be sufficient information or specific interest to warrant opening

eth the arries cuban sidea wee of station are consened

factions and objectives can be assisted by furnishing ail participating

stations up-to-rate listings containing information under the control.

of the Cuban desk on the dramatis personae. In addition to 201 per -

sonalities, such lists should contain the names and identiiying cat:

of persons who should be kept track of, although they may only be of

tangential interest or on whom there may be little or no data other

than that given in the listing itself-

4. To accommodate this type of requirement in the 201 system,

identifiable personalities concerning whom enough information is not

yet available to require the opening of & file may be assigned numbers

of the following type but in the same series:

IDN-123457•

These are relabeled "201" if a file is opened. IDN numbers are car-

ried with 201 numbers in appropriate general or special listings,

where they are identified by the letter "I" in the "Type of Name" col-

uman. IDN numbers are not CS file numbers.

5. All 201 code numbers are assigned by RID at headquarters, :

either upon receipt of form 831, or of a field dispatch. li a dispatch

is written about a personality not yet in the system, a 201 number for

it may be requested simply by writing under headquarters file number

in the dispatch form as follows:

Dispatch Symbol and No.

XYZA-12345

Headquarters File No.

201 -

8. IN numbers are assigned by RID at headquarters upon the

request of stations or desks which are developing special identification

programs within the 201 system. The field receives current notifica-

tion of new 201 openings and IDN numbers through the Field Index Card

Sarvice..

7. Stations or branches often are concerned with personalities

not of general CS concern. Files on these may be kept in any desired

order. Should such personalities become of general CS interest,

they must be brought into the 201 system.
