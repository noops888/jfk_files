1.

A CIA translator confirmed that the attachment,

dated 1 December 1963, is a translation of the full-page

attachment in Dutch and Spanish dated 1 December 1963.

The translator reported that the translation reads a little

awkwardly, but the original, a telegram, was also rather

awkward.

He further stated that the Dutch text on the same

page was also a translation of the Spanish text above it.

The following is a translation for attachment

AC-56, dated 2 December 1963:

SUBJECT:

Statements by SANTOS MESA

It has been heard that during a USSR reception on

7 November of this year,

the third secretary of the Cuban

Embassy in the Hague, Richardo SANTOS MESA, was asked about

CASTRO's reaction to attacks on Cuba by Cuban exiles.

He

replied "Just wait, and you will see what we can do; it will

happen soon." (quoted response given in English in the

original)

SANTOS declined to elaborate.

It has also been heard that SANTOS has a brother who lives

in the United States as an "exile."

Although this brother is pro-Castro, he is said to have

left Cuba at

• the urging of his conservative wife.

SANTOS is said to exchange correspondence with this

brother.
