AntURvY-l could furnish, sALAbARRIA ofiered to carry out minor

sabotage actions for AMTURVY-l'8 American "contacts". A few

monthg later in October 1963, when we were sntisfied with

SALABARRIA's bonafides, ve managed to get a few pistols,

revolvers and some sabotage materials into SALABARRIA's

hands

through AMTURVY-1. SALABARRIA responded with a plea for more,

but denied that he could retrieve an arms cache from a site

On

the north coast. AMTURVY-1 became cynienl about SALABARRIA'S

plans and then

in response to our instructions he abanconed

direct contact with SALABARRIA early in 1964. SALABARRIA,

however, continued to see AMTURVY-A who kept in touch with both

AMTUrVY-1 and QUANTUM-51.)01

Meanwhile, SALABARRIA's accomplice, Dr. Bernardo MILANES

Lopez,

prominent Havana doctor who was the personal pbysician of

CASTRO's mother for 15 years until her death in July 1963, was

recruited in November-December 1903 while on a vialt to Madrid.

During the course of his recrutiment, MULANES stated that he

was active in a group of conspirators who were plotting to kill

CASTRO,

He alluded to disgruntled Rebel Arny officers and nedical

collergues, but he did not name SALABARRIA among those few he

1dentified

as persons of trust. He did, however, spell out the

groups needs for weapons, money and vehicles in order to carry

out their assassination mission. And, he finally agreed to

serve as a colloction agent in return

for linited financial

compensation and in the apparent hope that ve rould in time

furnish hin with sufficient funds for the needed vehicles.

Following his return to Havana in January 1964, MILANES proved

to be a fairly regular S/" correspondent, a source of soue Order

of Battle.

While he repeatedly urged us

to help him obtrin the

vehicles for his group, he never disclosed to us how deeply

involved he, hinself, was in the plot to kill CASTRO. We

subsequently learned that he had informed SALABARRIA of his

recrultment by cla in maorid and that he mad tried to persuade

SALABARRIA to work directly with him rather than with ANTURVY-4.

1. MILANES vas arrested in the company of his chauffeur

and nephew, both fully witting of his clandestine activities

for

the Agency

and presumably equally involved in the conspirary

to kill CASTRO. From the limited evidence rogutred to date,

It appears that MILANES' arrest may have been prompted by the

blackmarketeoring of hig nephew, censorship of his mall or

physical surveillance.

In any case, it is known that he had
