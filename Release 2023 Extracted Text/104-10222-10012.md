the Freedom of Information and Privacy Acts. The experience

epitonizing the

issues in transition from'a totally classified past to a new

intelligence environment

yet to be defined.

The

tension in

law between protoction of sources and methods and more open

government was apparent, daily, to those involved; good case

law was made as we sought to adhere to both principles and

to regain, through this process, some credibility for the

Agency.

I've tried in the past to convey my appreciation

truly magnificent support 1 got from what is now

the Privacy and Informution Action Group, through recommenda-

tions for the Unit Citation subsequently

awarded by

the DCI,

through Q5I's. and promotions, and

through personal comment.

THROUGH:

SUBJECT:

Promotion Recommendation - Frederick C. Randall to GS-15

1.

This memorandum constitutes a formal recommendation that Fred

Randall, GS-14/8, now Chief of the DDO Privacy Information (DDO/PIC)

unit in Services Staff, be promoted to CS-15. The position calls for

that grade.

Mr. Randall is 49 years of age; entered on duty in CIA in

September 1951 as a GS-7. assigned to OSO/FDZ..

He is married; 'has four

children, served briefly in the Air Force (1945-46); has. an AB in

Government, an AM in Forcign Affairs, and was a PhD candidate in

Interational Relations.

His Agency service was in FE fron. 1953 to

1965, including overseas tours in Djakarta and Tokyo; in DOD/FRD

from 1965 to March 1975, including 2 years

in the DC field office;

his current assignment dates from 16 March

75. His date of grade is

June 1967.

3.

The specifics of ir. Randall's current assignment and all the

superlatives about it I have just recounted in a fitness report which

I prepared today, as well as in a QSI recommendation (approved) of

October 1975 and an out-of-cycle promotion recommendation dated

8 August 1975:

I rate his performance Outstanding and refer the

reader(s) to the reports cited for details.

•I would note here that

Mr. Rindall changed his home base and functional category in Yovember

of 1975 and was rated number 1 of 4 Category C nominees fron this Staff

by all four memhers of the SS Panel, • I would note further that when

I submitted my August 75 out,-of-cycle promotion recommendation, Mr.

Randall's career designation was B/OG; given his personal circunstances

the DDO suggested that Randall change his career designation to become

more conpetitive "and have an excellent chance on the next go round."

The (Sl suggestion then resulted.

As the individual responsible for releasing or denying

thousands of DDO documents in response to FOIA requests, and subsequently

answering for DDO decisions in affidavits and court depositions, I know

nol nell fred does his work and how richly lie deserves this promotion to

SUBJECT: One-Time Reclama - Requested Randall Promotion

• As you know, OB is not reticent about expressing hig views, and in the incorma

career development world, Fred had had it in FRD.

I've known OB fairly well and re-

spect his candor and professionalism; we just worked very well together on the a-

16/17 Panel, with an interestingly identical philosophy.

Fred's performance did not

satisty OB, and his Fitness Reports reflect that fact.

It does not surprise me, since

Fred had been in FR from 1970-1975, that his Fitness Reports for the past years would

put him in a neutral middle, or even low middle, ranking among B/0 officers.

that's yesterday.

Today, as I tried to say strongly in my 8 August memo, my view of his work is

that it is

Outstanding--and I don't so rate many officers.. I would hope his present

work.could stand on its own merit, and project forward, expecting FOIA to be a way of

lite in the Do with ill the management challenge,

and headache, that poses.

present and future peer competition-should be with the A/C crowd, not the B/06 group-.

if that hurdle is determining.

At the risk of being irritating, I feel bound to state his case in what I con-

sider the appropriate competitive environment, to avoid an out-of-cyclo suggestion

doing mischief to the system. Any hope?

MENDRAVDM FOR: Deputy Director for Operations

SUBJECT:

Out-of-Sequence Promotion Recormendation:

Fred Randall

We've spoken of the need to look further at both Agency

and DDO implications of the Freedom of Information Act and, now,

the Privacy Act, including the increased number of appeals and

litigation cases, and of the logic of collecting a coterie of

deponents or affiants to take some of the load off of both you

and me.

The grade level of the appeals officers and the deponents

must include 14's and 15's, to incorporate the necessary clout

with the divisions and judgment vis-a-vis release of information

to the outside world.

2.

Fred is a GS-14/7.

ie had just come to me at the time of

the last GS-15 panel exercise and had not been recommended for

promotion by FRD.

I consider his performance over the past 6 months

to have been Outstanding.

He is head and shoulders above the other

directorates' FlOs; I have considerable laudatory testimony from

OGG, OLC, O/DDA and within the DDO as to his professionalism, tact,

persuasiveness, analytic skills and realistic, while tough-minded,

protection of DDO sources and methods.

This includes occasional

arm-wrestling with DDO branch/division/staff chiefs, OCC and OLC

lawyers, FBI contacts and others above his current grade level.

3. I have discussed this proposed out-of-cycle promotion

recommendation to GS-15 with Ev, who, in turn, has mentioned it'

to Gordon. The return signals I got sounded positive.

4. I do, therefore, recommend that you, approve fired's pronation

to GS-15, effective as soon as the action can he cut.

Subject's file indicates that he has been rocom-

mended for promotion five times:

four times by his

superiors in FE Division when he served in Japan, and

once by the US Station in February 1966.

While realizing

that the 13 to 14 jump is traditionally difficult we feel

that Subject's performance over the past year, when coupled.

with a consistently high calibre of work in previous years;

deserves nuch-belated recognition in the form of a promotion.

He continues to be responsible for the US Station's efforts

to exploit the Far Fastern target, and his. years of over-.

seas experience against. this target have been reflected

in a realistic and imaginative approach to operations in

the United States.

His operational activity lias required

the handling of persons of valied nationality and stature,

close contact with

outstanding.

The workload is larger and more complicated than anything

remains only to be noted that Mr. Ramall is the perfect man for the job, combining

a remarkable match of leadership, operational sawly, legal and policy awareness and,

perhaps most important, negotiating ability with both the Agency lanyers and legisla-

He is articulate and effective in presenting

the least active of the four group chiefs in this area,

although he

has the inquisitiveness. und intellect to contribute

importantly in cross-discipline problems.

I find no weakness

but Mr. Randall's contributions here do not measure up

comparatively to his exceptional performance in all other arcas.

In these other arcas, covering duties 3 and 4, Mr.

Randall and his group stimulated,

staffed out and justified

successful policy changes:

a Presidential

statement that sources and methods information need not be

classified to be protected; a DCI policy that DO records ipso

facto are not relèasable (despite an OGC opinion to the

contrary), and a policy allowing employces access to

files without going through the FOlA or Privacy Act folderol.

Ahile not individual accompllshments by Mr. Randall,

bespeak exem the leadership and

guidance he gave,

typical of the kind of case officer professionalism he has and

ie have needed to help protect agents, operations and officers

from exposure.

do think it is sad to have

to divert good

in talent to disclosure law problems; but if ne must, then

Mr. Randall's experience and abilities have counted

a OSI at this time.

I consider Mr. Randall's performince as DDO/FIO (now DDO/PIC, for

Privacy. Act and FOlA Coordinator) to be Outstanding.

elsewhere, he is, in my vicw, the most impressive of all the Agency FIO's.

combining DO professionalism, tact, persmasiveness, analytic skills and

an informed, tough-minded approach toward sources and methods protection.

received considerable laudatory comment about his work from OCC,

OLC, O/DeA and within the DO.

3.

From a one-man operation with secretary, the FOlA activity expanded

in four months to an approved 1/0 of 7, with a pending request for 5 more,

and the possibllity of further increases depending on public reaction to the

Privacy Act and the amount of litigation that develops.

Fred has done an

excellent job of selecting his staff for what is an often frantic, frustrating

and long-houred environment; he also manages them well, with humar and

compassion and with high analysis and output standards.

He is conscious of

cost, particularly in human effort, in this exercise and of the need for

the application of secrecy criteria in today's environment.

am, obviously, impressed and pleased with his assistance, and feel

mfortably supported by his group's efforts in avoiding or proparing 1or

tigation actions in FOlA and Privacy Act case:

(Memorandum in Lieu of Fitners Report - Frederick C. Randall)

during the rating period, Whercas I had indicated in his last fitness

roport a need for him to be more demanding in challenging faulty pro-

posals or resolving problems which come to him at his Branch Chief

level, he now exerts a good degron of initiative in independent action

and offers good compleled stall work to the Division Chiel lovel lor

(Atlanta, Boston, Los Angoles and San Francisco), He keeps effectively

abreast of the operational developmenta coming out of each Base and

represents this Divialun vory persuasively in obtaining good guidance

messages going back out to the Bases. He has also kept himself well

informed on the Management by Objoctives tärgets assigned to each of

his Bases where a total of about forty (10) personnel are assigned, and

has been strong in supporting hle Basos' efforta to achieve these.

Mr.

Randall has matured nicely as a manager these past months

and is on top of the many administrative, personnel and operational

support problems which are of a frequently recurring nature in our type

operational activity. lle la alao a good team player, has the best

interests of this Division at heart, and given thoroughly of himself in his

job. He has worked hard in bringing himself up to his preent level of

performance which I appraiae as au unqualified "Strong".

REVIEWING OFFICIALS COMMENTS (Frederick C. Randall)

I concur generally with the comments of the rating officer.

I belleve Mr. Randall has shown improvement in his handling of his

Branch Chief responsibilities. I agree that he has shown greater

Initiative in this reporting period than in the previous ones, however,

I would still like to soe a somewhat greater and quickor recognition

on Mr. Randall's part of operational problem areas. Granted that this

Is a talent that is frequently hard to develop, it la nonetholess, essential

for all Branch' Chiefs in this Division to achieve a high dogree of

operational perspicacity. Mr. Randall has the ability and needs only

additional experience to improve his focus on the operational targeting

efforts of his respective Bases. He is a thoughtful and considerate

supervisor, respected by hia subordinates and he representa the Division

very well indeed.

Mr. Randall's career would be onhanced were he in

a position to accept a field assignment which would got him into direct

operational contact, i.e., recruiting and handling agonte. Unfortunately,

for family medical reasons he will apparently be contined to the

Headquarters area for an indefinite period. On balance, I consider him

to be a good Branch Chief who willingly worke long hours and does hia

job well.

3. Reviewing Official'a Comments:

concur generally with the above rating. I also observed in the

early days of Mr. Randall's assignment as Branch Chief, that his per-

formance could certainly have been stronger. It took him somewhat

longer than i had anticipated to really take charge of his Branch. However,

I feel that as he has continued in this assigninent he has made very definite

progress. He is now generally well informed on the operational activities

taking place in his area and has begun to exercise a greater degree of

initiative and aggressiveness in handling the operational matters that cross

his dosk. Had i been the rating officer I probably would have given Mr.

Randall a somewhat lower, more qualified "Strong" rating. If he continues

to improve in the months ahead as he has in the past several, I believe he

can earn an unqualified "Strong"

rating for this performance.

Mr. Randall, his overall performange has continued strong. He has effectively

continued to provide the day-to-day operational support for the FR Basos in Los

Angoles and San Francisco and the two

singlcton officers in

the Northwest, Colorado

The level and complexity of the operational

support and guidance which he has provided with skill, sensitivity and humanness

has continued uniformly high.

Mr. Randall has again effectively trained a new Intelligence Analyst with no

loss of efficiency or responsiveness to the ever-increasing field requirements.

Mr. Randall has been under my supervision for 28 months as the San Francisco!

Los Angeles Desk officer and has continued successfully to meet the challenges

of incréased responsibility, It is now planned to appoirt him as Branch Chief to

be responsible for the Bases in Boston and Atlanta as well as Los Angeles and

San Francisco. The increase in complevity of this new assignment for him will.

be heightened by the assignment of additional operational personnel in three of his

four Bases, which will materially add to the demanding workload of his Branch.

We are confident he will be able to meet the challenge of these added rosponsibilities

Mr. Randall continues to exercise the responsibility of providing the day-to-

The

comments that were mado in the previous fitness report bear repetition.

In any

other Division the backstopping of two Bases, which are Stations in all but name,

would involve at least an entire branch and all the supervidory responsibility that

such support entails rather than a single officer with an Intelligence Analyst.

Mr.

Randall does all of this and has continued to do it well. During the year both Bases

havo increased substantially in size and in dogree and complexity of the oporational

activities there. He has supported both Bases excoptionally well.

• In addition to carrying on the full-time responsibility for both Bases he has

continued to demonstrate a willingness and a senoitivity to increase the offectivo-

noss of his Intelligence Analyst, who has now gono on to a sensitive SB position

with adcitional rosponsibility, by. careful tutorial training and guidanco. He has

then been called upon to train a second Intelligence Analyst quickly and did so

while maintaining a high dogree of responsiveloss to the continued demande of

the two Bases.

Whon Mr. Mandall was firet assigned to our Division Headquarters component,

it was my distinct impression that he sas very definitely lacking in enorry.

as tiine has progressed and he has become more experienced in our mode

of overa-

commendable energy and vigor.

Mr. Randall has the responsibility of providing the day to day operational

support lo FR Basos in Los Angeles and San Francisco. Both bases have in-

creaded substantially in size during the past year to where there are presently

six senior caso officers and an intelligenco assistant in Lon Angeles and ten

senior case officors and an intelligence analyst in San Francisco all generating

significant oporational activity requiring substantivo guidance, management and

organizational Initiative of the highest order. In any other Division tha back:

stopping of an clement of this size and complexity would involve an entiro branch

and all the suporvlsory responsibility that goes with it rather than a single officer

and an intelligonco analyst. In the FR Division the decision was made to keep the

Headquarters complement small and to do a job with carefully solected exporionced

and skilled senior operations officers who, based on their own field and porsonal

exporience, are able to press the right buttons to ovoke appropriate responses

from the various area divisions and staffs and to provido practical guidance on

In exercising this function, Mr.. Randall has continued to demonstrate thoso

critical qualities of energy, loyalty and dedication.

MI. Randall continues to riew his responsibilitles with enthuslaam and serlous con-

•cerne

Given the complexities of dealing with every area division and stall within

DDP

•- I would

characterize his overall performance as evincing exceptional proficlency, This was

accomplished in a perlod which saw both Bases increase their striking power numert-

cally rather significantly. In the ultimate, the real test of performanco la in re-

cruitment of foreign nationals. While recruitment is not part of Me. Randall's duties

there in no doubt that his support of the two Bases contributed to the highest record

of recrultment that these Bases had as compared to any other year. At the same time,

he consciously maintained an excellent balance in the outgo of funds for operational

purposes. He is held in

high regard by both Base Chiefs.

Since much of the routine

desk work is done by his Intal Assistant, it is a tribute to his supervisory capability

that this service maintains a high rate of efficiency despite the significant increase in

work, and the fact that during this perod there were three different intel assistants.

Since the supervisor began phasing out of bla. job for several montha prior to 31 March,

a rather conscious decision was made to have Mi. Randall in fact assume some of

the responsibility of the Branch Chief. Not only has he taken these added taske

willingly and with the confidence of DO's management, but he has performed

superbly.

would

feul hia overall performance falls somewhero on the bozder of a 'low

H1g

work on the highly involved and sensitive WUWORTHY case is cited

in this regard.

Although he continues to feel a bit unsure of

himself in operational areas other than FE (to a degree not warranted

by his performance, ag the WUWORTHY case shows) he is improving in

this regard and is

on his way to bringing his operational activity

In other areas up to the level of his performance

He performs his supervisory functions well.

Ho is very cost

accurate.

This officor has brought to bear on lils current assignment his varled organi-

zation. experiences in a nanner which brings credit to hinsclf as vell as to the

organization.

His unstintine elving of binself la an outständing attribute. The

triala und trIbulatIons of PERAPARI 1n an area traditionälly hostile to the whole

concept have made his asslement particularly challengine, alsuys difficult, and

Intrequently satisfying; but ho sticks to lt with firm determination. His super

ulsory role of our Central Registry frequently catches him in the cross currents of

opposing interests and priorities but he successfully calms such troubled waters.

While a part of his PIRAVPANT activitles this officor's supervision of the COFJ, an

Intelligence community pooled activity for agent checks, has been excellent. Finally,

his task under SD 4 1s largsly a hundholding onè but one which reguires large

amounts

of tact, patience, and goodulll. There 1s no other Station officer performing

comparable duties with woor tils officer can be compared.

MEMORANIUN FOR: Director of Personnel

THROUGH

SUBJECT

: Chairman, DDO QSI and Honor and Merit Awards Panel

Request for a Quality Step Increase for Nt. Frederick

C. Randall, GS-14

1. On the basis of the information presented below, it is

reconmended that a Quality Step Increase be approved for Mr. Frederick

C. Randall.

Mr. Randall has been employed by the Agency since September 1951.

He has spent his Agency carcer in the Operations Directorate serving with

East Asia and Foreign Resources Divisions.

He has had field

assignments

in Jakarta and Tokyo and spent four years at FR Base, Nashington.

In early 1975, Mr. Randall was assigned to the Services Staff

to serve as the Freedom of Information Officer for the DDO.

In spite

of

the ambiguity of evolving guidelines, constant pressure of short deadlines,

a very laige volune of work and the cultural trauma the Act and its

malementation sonerated, Mr. Randall's performance has been outstanding

le is noted for his professionalism, tact, persuasiveness, analytic skills

and realistic, while tough-minded, protection of DIO sources and methods.

In addition to his FOI responsibilities, 'ir. Randall was just designated

the Privacy Act Coordinator for the DDO.

It is still too carly to predict

the actual work requirements as a result of this Act, but it is anticipated

that si. Randall will mect these added responsibilities in the same

exceptional manner as he has fulfilled his FOI duties.

tonsideration has been given to the granting of an honor anc

Nerit Award.

Horever, it is felt that a Quality Step Increase wil

provide more appropriate recognition of Mr.

Randall's outstanding

the past seven months in a very challenging and

demanding assigment.
