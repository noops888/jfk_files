SUBJECT:

Clandestine Survice Senior Seminar

1. I have been some time getting around to expressing my

appreciation to you and through you to the other officery who

participated in the Senior Seminar. Maybe it is just as well

occause, as you probably are aware, a number of the findings

of the Senior Seminar have been, in one form or another, acted

upon. In some of the cages, action that was already underway

was accelerated. In othere, the Seminar produced useful insights

on the basis of which action was taken.

2. I know that it was a considerable labor for you but I

would like you to be aware of the fact that I and the other officers

in the Clandestine Service involved in the matters dealt with by the

Seminar have been helped greatly by its several findings.

3. It la probable that we will want to do another running of

tre Seminar later this year.

If so, I know that we will benefit from

ine excellent pilot run which you conducted.

SUBJECT:

Recommendation for Promotion -

Newton Scott MILER

1. This is a recommendation for promotion for Mr. Miler

from Grade GS-15 to CS-16.

2.

The careero this officer has been notably marked through-

out with relatively important responsibilities for his age. His youth,

intense drive, initiative, self-assurance, capacity for work, natural

talent for determining the objectives, recognizing the problem,

organization of the work to be done, administering and supervising

the effort, have long been evident to those for and with whom he has

Worked. Years of service during which he has steadily matured has

resulted in a recognition, by supervisors and subordinate fellow-

workers alike of his unusually wide experience, proven soundness of

judgement, organizational administrative and executive talent coupled

with powers of expression both oral and written and demongtrated

capacity for work.. He is unquestionably a very outstanding officer.

3. Having entered on duty as a Code Clerk (GS-05) in October

1946 following an A. B. degree ir. Economics from Dartmouth College

in a Savy V-12 Program, he was soon assigned to Shanghai where he

remained a short period before a TDY assignment to

Seoul, Korea.., He was assigned to Mukden and

Manchuria from April 1947

Where despite being

barely 21 years of age and an official designation as Code Clerk as

Grades GS-5/7. he conducted Agent operations into Korea, USSR and

China.

cases with X-2 officers. His talents were recognized and after TDY

training at Headquarters, he was assigned to Shanghai as an Intelligence

Officer. There he performed as a Case Officer and engaged in stay

bejond planning, supervision of other junior Case Officers, and assisted

in the evacation of other ClA officers.

Before he was 25 years of age,

he established the station and served as Chief of

for

some 20 months (1919-51).

4. He has successfully engaged in all types of operationg -

Fl CI, CA including PM and PW, but his principal talents have been

in the Counter Intelligence, particularly Counter-Espionage field.

His experience includes service as Chiefs of Station,

Senior-Case

Officer, Senior Staff Oificer, and since September 196%, Deputy

Chief of the Special Investigationa Group of the Cl Staft where he

has had a major responsibility in the supervision of senior grade

Counter Intolligence Officery as well ag being personally and directly

active in matters of agreat complexity and highest security consid-

crations. In his service in that capacity he has demonstrated his

outstanding abilities as a Counter Intelligence officer. He has

carried a substantial portion of the work load of his office including

supervision of both clorical and officer personnel, liaison with all

elements of the Agency and other intolligence and security services

of the government as appropriate. It is strongly recommended that he

be promoted to Grade GS-16.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, Africa Division

SUBJECT:

Reconmendation for Prosotion - Newton Scott Miler

It is reconmended that Nowto. Seott Miler be promoted

from his present grade of GS-14 to GS-15.

Miler was assigned

to tho Africa Division on 9 July 1961 and assumed his present

position of Chief of Station,

Addis Ababa, in September 1961.

le has been in grade since 24 March 1957.

In accepting his

present assignment Miler assumed responsibility for a vory com-

plicated operntional program requiring considerable reorientation

and modification.

In a short time he has been able to give

purpose and direction to operations which previously had been

the subject of considerable controversy within DD/P.

It 13

worthy of note that Miler has accomplished this with an almost

entirely new

team,

few of whom had any previous experience 11

African operations.

2.

Under normal circumstances,

the Supervisor would be

inclined to delay a promotion recommendation pending further

opportunity to observe first hand the performance of the

Individual.

It is felt that Miler is a justifiable exception

to this rule.

Prior to his assignment to the Africa Division,

Miler had been recommended for promotion by his former Supervisor

who is

presently Deputy Chiof,

CI-CF Staff.

This man had

apparently felt so strously about Miler's performance that he

had suggested that Miler be the one man on the CI-CE staff who

should be given a jump promotion to superarado.

If necessary a

memorandum supporting the remarks made can be obtained.

In addition to the above,

the Supervisor has been

ussociated with Miler in a protessional relationship sinee 194bt

The only kap in continuity was from the perlod 1956 to 1959.

1s folt,

therefore, that the Supervisor's evaluation of Miler's

knowledge, ability, experience, and potential bears weight.

1. During the current rating period Mr. MILER was transferred

from his previous position as Deputy Chier of the Special Intelligence

Group of the Counter Intelligence Staff to ine position of Chief of the

Opcrations Group of the same Staff. This was a new position and as such

required unusual skills and vigor to give dimension to the job to be done.

Mr. MILER approached hig task with imagination and energy. He inherited

an incohesive group of capable officers and immediately began the task of

trying to define common denominators for their operational activitieg, to

weed out duplicatory and marginal tasks, to establish clearly delineated

guidelines and to provide a sense of discipline, all aimed toward giving

better counterintelligence guidance and support to the operations of the

arca divisions and the operational components of the CA Staff.

2.. At the same time Mr. MILER has continued to handle, under

the direct guidance of the Chief, Counter Intelligence Staff, a number of

extremely sensitive cases to which he has contributed analytically and

developmentally.

The cares required not only keen operational sense in

their handling, but a strong feeling for liaison as many of the cases involved

frequent high-level discussion and negotiation with other components uf

CIA as well as with outside agencies and departments. In fulfilling these:

responsibilities, Mr. MILER has worked without regard to hours or to his

personal convenience.. He has assiduously tried to reflect the thinking of

the Chief of the CI Staff and to relate it to the operational problems he is.

Mr. MILER has maintained contact with a number of key

foreign intelligence officials with whom he has worked overscas. His

home has been available to them during their visits to the United States.

5. While being able to adjust his own thinking vlen and as

required by a given situation, Mr. MILER has strong personal con-

victions on operational matterg and does not hesitate to advance his

opinions or to push for his recommended solutions.

6. Mr. MILER is currently directing an office which includes

in its complement one GS-16 and Els GS-15s. He is also responsible

for the carcer development of at more junior case officers. The

above is in addition to the normal supervision of the remaining group

staff. In performing these functions, he is cost-conscious and econo-

mizes in the expenditure of government funds and the valuable time of

senior officers.

7. Mr. MILER would be the first to admit that many problems

remain for him in his current assignment.

He would also readily ack-

nowledge that he has not yet been able to clearly define each of these

problems or to provide the perfect solution for every one which has

been isolated. Progress, however, is being made every day and Mr.

MILER clearly demonstrates that his promotion to GS:16 in 1969 was

deserved and that it will not be the last which he will merit. This is

an officer of high professional integrity and dedication. He is a self-

starter, he works and thinks realistically.

He speaks his mind when

he has something to say - including critical things, yet rtains a good

sense for the craftsman's side of the Cl job. He is not adept just at

identifying problems, he finds the solution.
