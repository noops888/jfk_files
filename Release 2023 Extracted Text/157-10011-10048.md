am not too far off in what I am about to tell you. The contract

was structured in such, a way that as the bottoms of other

companies became obsolete, they could only be replaced with

Onassis' tankers.

Even ARANCO had to, by attrition, within a

period of four-and-a-half to five-and-a-half years, would have,

if their tankers became obsolete, they could only be replaced

by Onassis tankers.

Our statistics, after having studied the contract and

making what we considered to be proper projections, indicated

that at the completion of approximately five-and-a-half years,

Mr. Onassis would control more dead weight tonnage than the

United States controlled in its entirety, that he would control

on the high seas annually more oil by tens of thousands of

gallons more than were used by all of the Allied nations during

the most severe year of the Korean War, that in the first year

his profit would be approximately $17 million dollars, that

after five-and-a-half years his annual profit would be in the

area of $200 million.

While this analysis is going on, we also found that a

million dollar pay-off had been made to one of the top ministers

in Saudi Arabia and we had the evidence

Mr. Maheu.

-- of the Uhited States, and within a matter,

I believe, of forty-eight hours, our State Department

denounced the agreement. It was the first time that anyone

had actually seen what this meant, and frankly, there was an

innate fear that with the initial $17 million, them there would

be no way of stopping, I mean, he might go to Venezuela and

do the same thing, and there were also other inputs about the

background of Mr. Onassis that I would just as soon not make

a matter of record, but they were not too favorable, that we

presented to the National Security Council verbally but not

in writing.

Mr. Madigan. Who made the presentation?

Senator Schweiker. What subsequently happened then with

the Security Council denunciation, et cetera?

Mr. Madigan. The State Department denounced the agreement

and that same evening we were told that two lof

the top-crA

officials were on their way to Saudi Arabia.

Then I proceeded to dig up the gentleman by the name of

Carl Twitchell by virtue of reading about the country, because

I'm not about ready to go there and not know about the customs

and the formation of the country. I dug up a man by the name

of Carl Iwitchell who was living in Connecticut who turned out

to be the first American who had ever raally been accepted by

old King Saud. Me twitchell had spent time in the country

as a mining engineer to help them in the exploitation of

mines. It was in fact to carl witchell that the old king gave

the power of attorney to come to the United States government

or come back to the United States and try to form a consortium

for the exploitation of oil from which emanated ARAMCo.

was the type of

man who was only reimbursed for his

expenses. I think his total expenses were slightly in excess

of $8,000. He didn't even keep the banking and percentage

for himself, or a piece of the action, so to speak, and he was

highly, highly loved by the Saudis and although the old king

was then gone and king Saud, the son. was in power, Mrz

Twitchell had the same respect and reverence from the present

leaders as he did from the father and I convinced Mr.

wiwitchell

that - he already had a clearance, a satisfactory clearance,

and I convinced him to precede me to Saudi Arabia to try to

lay the groundwork.

Senator Schweiker.

What year was this, roughly?

Mr. Maheu. This, I believe, was in '54 or '55, yes.

Anyway, I finally ended up going to Saudi Arabia, having

a meeting with the King's confidential assistant, presenting all

of this evidence, frankly at the time not knowing if the king

himself had a piece of the action --

Senator Huddleston. Had some of this evidence come from

the wiretap?

Mr. Maheu. That tap

was entirely unproductive, entirely

unproductive.

Senator Schweiker. What happened then at your meeting?

Mr. Maheu. Well, it's very interesting, if we could take

a little time, I mean, I was scheduled to have the meeting

"with the king," but he doesn't show, he stays somewhere else

and the confidential assistant shows up and one trusted

minister that he had with cast witcher present.

And my meeting was scheduled for 8:00 p.m. one night, and

this happaned to be the last day that the King was supposed to

be in Jidda, he was then leaving for the capital further

inland, Jidda being the only major port in Saudi where he

spends his summers, and they were having a big parade for him,

and from the balcony of the hotel, I'm watching the parade go

by, and finally the King's car comes and he is arm and arm with

ther nan on whom I'm going to give the evidence that night, and

I frankly was not too comfortable, particularly in view of the

fact that in those days -- and I don't know whether it has

changed, but in Saudi, the same document did not give you

permission to enter and leave; you had to make application for

an exit visa after you arrived, and I was in constant contact

with the then-United States Ambassador. He made it very clear

that the government approved of everything I was doing, but if

something went wrong they could not come to my rescue, I would

have to be the fall guy, and I was prepared to do it. That was

Saudi Arabian government would have its flag flying the high

seas, and at the time that all of this is going on they are

building what then, upon completion of production, had been

the biggest tanker in the world at that time, a ship named

after the old King, a tanker which was scheduled to go and take

a maiden flight and take off, and it turned out the biggest

problem that we had was to find a save-face gimmick. But

finally the whole thing was accomplished, and it took two and

a half years to do it.

Senator Schweiker. I didn't mean to get you off the

track.

Mr. Maheu. Well, I'm sorry I am so verbose.

Senator Huddleston. You said you bought a paper in

Athens? You mean by that you actually bought the paper or just

paid them to run the story?

Mr. Maheu. We bought a newspaper.

You'll have to understand, Senator, that in Rome, in those

days, there were fifty newspapers. I mean, the big circulation

in those days, big circulation in Rome was 20,000. It's hard

for us to visualize that.

Senator Huddleston.

Mr. Maheu. Yes.

Can we go off the record?

Senator Schweiker. Yes:

Mr. Liebengood. Was this listening post that you referred

to, was that a project, that was related to work for the Central

Intelligence Agency?

Mr. Maheu. I don't believe it was.

Mr. Madigan. Did you have any New York assignments other

than Onassis that you gave to Frank?

Mr. Maheu. I don't remember any.

Mr. Madigan. How about

I may have asked

you that yesterday. Do you recall

whether he had any relation-

ship with your company during the 1950's?

Mr. Maheu. I don't remember a Thomas Evans

Thomas:

Evans?

Mr. Madigan. A CIA employee.

Mr. Maheu. I don't recall his name.

Mr. Madigan. I got sidetracked off of my question of

whether you recall a prosecution or an investigation of the

Onassis wiretap. You may have already have answered that.

Mr. Maheu. I think I did, yes.

Mr. Madigan. What did you say?

MI. Maheu. My recollection is that I appeared before a

Grand Jury that was investigating Mr. Frank on another

matter.

Mr. Madigan. On another matter, but you had no recollection

of any investigation of that particular tap? .…..

Mr. Maheu. No, I don't.

Mr. Maheu. Mr. Scott McCloud, who was then Director of

Mr. Madigan. Was it coordinated with the CIA, or was this

strictly between yourself and the State Department?

Mr. Maheu. My recollection is that the CIA was kept

apprised, however that the coordination was with the State

Department, in connection with the security that was being

provided for this leader during his visit to the United States.

Mr. Madigan. Did you meet with the State Department or

CIA people or both in New York City when the leader arrived

there?

Mr. Maheu. My racollection is that my role was limited

simply to fund their income. In other words, they would be on

reimbursed the exact amount of their pavroll.

payroll, and for the second time I was turned down by Mr.

Hughes. I believe it was in September of 1969 that I finally

called Mr. Meier in and requested his resignation and then

I informed Mr. Hughes that he had resigned.

After the departure of Mr. Meier, while going through his

files, Mr. Ellson ran into some documents that indicated some

very serious double escrows on mining properties and we

recommended to Mr. Hughes that all the information be made

available to the authorities and let the chips fall where they

may.

Mr. Liebengood. Do you know why Mr. Hughes was not inclined

to follow your recommendations with regards to Meier's termina-

tion at earlier dates?

Mr. Maheu. He was afraid that Meier would embarrass him.

At least, that is what he told me.

Mr. Liebengood. You are aware of no CIA interest in

Meier?

Mr. Maheu. The only thing I know is that Meier was cut

in on the cover

of Milke Mibrage in Covador and was aware of

that operation.

Mr. Liebengood. How did that come about? How was he

cut in on that?

Mr. Maheu. Because it was he who initially had worked on

a deal for a venture in Mexico on the part of Hughes Aircraft

for cable television and subsequent to - well, when that

collapsed, the person who was to be the partner of Hughes

Aircraft in that particular venture threatened to sue Howard

Hughes and all of the Hughes interest for non-fulfillment of

contract, and I made a recommendation to that person whose

name slips my mind, but I believe his last name was Jamie,

J-a-m-i-e or something like that, I don't recall. But to try

to discourage him from filing such a lawsuit I suggested that

he and I put up $10,000 in Equador and check into the

possibility of developing business there.

I put up my ten, he never put his up, and Meiar was the

one who was involved. But when the Agency needed a cover for

an assignment in Ecuados Meier was made privy of this by the

Agency.

Mr. Liebengood. Just to be certain I understand, this

was because of Meier's role in reestablishing the operation

in Fevador??

Is that correct?

Mr. Maheu.

Well, of trying to save the lawsuit, yes.

That's right.

Mr. Liebengood. And you think the name of this would-be

partner was Jamie?

Mr. Maheu. I don't ramember whether that was the first

name or last name.

MI. Liebengood.

How aid fires whatever way do you

spell his last name, do you recall?

Mr. Maheu. I don't recall.

do with any Agency interest in that?

Mr. Maheu. No, sir, not as far as I know.

As a matter of fact, it's my recollection I found out

about this afterwards.

Mr. Liebengood. Who else was witting of the cover

arrangements that you had with the Agency through Robert A.

Maheu Associates? You mentioned Meier and this particular

one. Did you have other amployees who were witting of the

cover?
