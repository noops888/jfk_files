for FOlA Review on

SEP 1976

IP. V/3.:

1. I discussed this informally with Mr. Arthur Booley, CI Staff,

who is knowledgeable on the OSWALD Case.

graphological assessment had not been cone to his knowledge to detemmine

if personality restructuring had been attempted on OSWAlD in the USSR.

Mr. Dooley questioned whether such an assessment would really make a

worthwhile or reliable contribution to the issue of OSWALD's notivation,

and warrant the time and expense involved; that if such in assessment

was atterpted in any fomal sort of fashion, the "official" results

may only add confusion to the motivation issue, since such results

would not have truly scientific validity. lle noted that the samples,

to his recollection, represented various environmental conditions ranging

from nonal passport applications, to condensed diary notations and notes;

that a child's handwriting changes from grade school to college as the

speed of nototaking increases and the pressure mounts. In this case you

are dealing with a disturbed mentality as well.

Based on his familarity with the case Mr. Tooley feels that

OSWALD's motivation is largely explained in terns of his reurotic background

his failure to achieve status, and his very deep resentment to all authority

After his stay in the Soviet Union, OSWALD's writings indicate that ho felt

neithor society had mich to offer; and in effect, he rejected both.

3. Mr. Dooley noted that undoubtedly other factors came into play to

formulate OSWALD's idea to assassinate the President.

For example, OSWALD

saw a movie on TV about an attempted presidential assassination with a rifl.

shortly before his deed, which could have sparked him into action.

Warren Cormission has indicated, the real motive may never be known.

4. Mr. Dooley said that the files are available for inspection by ani

St officer at any time to look for handrriting samples or any other purpose,

intact, view of the above,

he did not feel that anything could be proved for

catain and therefore questioned the merit of the sugrestion at this time.
