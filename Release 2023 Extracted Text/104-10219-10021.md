Indreating the Mlamt fleld office had been in contact with one

Joseph R. MEROLA.

MEROLA had just returned from a business

Erip to El Salvador; and he reported

that a friend of his had

identified a Mr. Gremillion In the Poltical Section of the

American Embassy In San Salvador as a suspect CIA representative.

Headquartars traces on Joseph R. MEROLA indicated that on several

occasions in the past MEROLA had claimed that he was a ClA

agent. The Chief of Station, the Hr. Greatlllon referred to

above, was recantly questioned regarding any Embassy contact

with MEROLA unile the

latter was in San Salvador.

The COS

funeRtons MEROLA had frequently referred to his contact with

che cano past and present.

He also volunteered this infor-

nation to @ torner Statron COntACt

In light of the above, It would appear that MEROLA

had taken

advantage of his agency contacts in an Inappropriato

manner to the potential embarrassment of the San Salvador

Station.

We would, accordingly, appreciate that this be given

dua consideration in your assessment of the advantage of your

continued contact with his.
