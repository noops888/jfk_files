It will be

noted that this memorandum bears the statement "THIS INFORMATION

IS FROM A CONFIDENTIAL SOURCE. IT MUST NOT BE DISSEMINATED IN

WHOLE OR IN PART OUTSIDE YOUR OFFICE WITHOUT PRIOR APPROVAL FROM

THE ORIGINATING OFFICE IN MEXICO CITY." It is also noted that

the original of the memorandum was sent on a circulating basis

to the Ambassador, the Minister, the Counselor for Political

Alfairs, and the Regional Security Officer and was to be

returned to the (Oth Floork CIA) and that carbon copies for

retention were designated for the Legal Attache, the Naval

Attache, and IaNS.

ReBucab #22 and mycab #525, both dated 4/3/64. In

accordance with the instructions contained in reBucab, the,

following is subnitted:

It is noted that the enclosed CIA memorandum mentions

contact on the part of LEE OSWALD only with the Soviet Embassy

and no mention was made of the Cuban Embassy. Although the CIA

memorandum was dated 10/16/63, the blockstamp of this office

indicates it was actually received here on 10/18/63.

On the

same date our cable #109 captioned "LEE OSWALD, IS - R," was

sent to the Bureau. This cable furnished a summary of the

information contained in the Cla memorandum and requested the

Bureau to furnish background data to this office.

Bureau cable

furnished such

background and advised that additional background was being

furnished by mail.

This additional background information was

received at the Mexico City Office on 10/28/63.

Assassination of President Kennedy-Reported

Anonymous Telephone Message

(S)

1. The following (cable from the CIA Station in London vas reported

orally to Mr. Sanel Papich at 0930 on 23 November:

The British Security Service (MI-5) has reported that at

1805 GMT on 22 November an anonynous telephone call was made in

Cambridge, Ingland, to the sentor reporter of the Cambriäge Neve.

The

caller said only that the Cambridge News reporter should call the

American Embassy in London for sone big news and then hung up.

After the word of the President's death was received the re-

porter informed the Cambridge police of the anonymous call and the

police informed MI-5. The important point is that the call was made,

according to Mies calculations, about 25 minutes before the President

was shot. The Cambridge reporter had never received a call of this

kind before and MI-5 state that he is known to them as a sound and loyal

person with no security record.

4. MI-5 noted that similar anonymous phone calls of a strangely

coincidental nature have been received by persons in the U. K. over the

past year, particularly in connection with the case of Dr. Ward.

5. The British Seeurity Service stated its desire to assist in

every possible way on any follow-up Investigations required within

the United Kingdon®
