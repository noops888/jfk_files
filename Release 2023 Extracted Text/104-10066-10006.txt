OPERATIVE IN JAPAN IN THE '50'S
BY NICHOLAS M. HORROCK
SPECIAL TO THE NEW YORK TIMES
WASHINGTON, MARCH 26--A FORMER FINANCE OFFICER FOR THE
CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY HAS TESTIFIED BEFORE THE HOUSE SELECT
COMMITTEE ON ASSASSINATIONS THAT HIS COLLEAGUES HAD TOLD HIM THAT
LEE HARVEY OSWALD WAS A SECRET OPERATIVE FOR THE AGENCY IN JAPAN
IN THE LATE 1950'S.
THE WITNESS, JAMES B. WILCOTT, WHO SAID THAT HE HAD SERVED
IN LOW-LEVEL JOBS WITH THE C.I.A. FROM 1957 THROUGH APRIL 1966,
CONTENDED IN AN INTERVIEW THAT CONVERSATIONS WITH COLLEAGUES IN
THE AGENCY'S TOKYO STATION AFTER PRESIDENT KENNEDY'S ASSASSINATION
ON NOV. 22, 1963 CONVINCED HIM THAT OSWALD, WHO HAD BEEN RECRUITED
BY THE AGENCY TO INFILTRATE THE SOVIET UNION AND SERVED AS A MARINE
IN THE FAR EAST.
MR. WILCOTT, WHO ACKNOWLEDGED THAT HIS MEMORY OF EVENTS 15

YEARS AGO WAS OFTEN SKETCHY, SAID THAT HE TESTIFIED UNDER OATH
AT A CLOSED SESSION OF THE HOUSE COMMITTEE ON WEDNESDAY, SUPPLYING
THE NAMES OF SEVERAL OFFICIALS OF THE C.I.A. WHO MIGHT BE ABLE
TO GIVE FURTHER DETAILS ON THE MATTER.
ROBERT BLAKEY, THE CHIEF COUNSEL AND STAFF DIRECTOR OF THE
COMMITTEE, DECLINED TO COMMENT ON THE TESTIMONY. HOWEVER, AN
INTERIM REPORT ISSUED BY THE COMMITTEE INDICATED THAT, ALTHOUGH
THE STAFF HAD CONDUCTED SOME 1,400 FIELD INTERVIEWS, THE
COMMITTEE CHOSE TO FLY RELATIVELY FORMAL, SWORN TESTIMONY LIKE THAT
SUPPLIED BY MR. WILCOTT.
PROJECTS CALLED "CRYPTOS"
ACCORDING TO SEVERAL SOURCES, THE COMMITTEE WAS INVESTIGATING
MR. WILCOTT'S TESTIMONY,
MR. WILCOTT SAID THAT HE JOINED THE C.I.A. AS A LOW-RANKING
FINANCE OFFICER IN 1957 AND WAS SENT TO TOKYO IN 1960. AT THE
TOKYO STATION, WHICH WAS IN A BUILDING THAT OSTENSIBLY HOUSED
UNITED STATES AIR FORCE PERSONNEL, MR. WILCOTT SAID, HIS
RESPONSIBILITIES INCLUDED MAKING CASH DISBURSEMENTS FOR PROJECTS
IDENTIFIED ONLY BY CODE NAMES CALLED "CRYPTOS."
HE SAID THAT HIS WIFE WAS A CLERICAL EMPLOYEE OF THE AGENCY
AT THAT TIME AND THAT HE STOOD "WATCH SHIFTS" TO EARN EXTRA MONEY.
MR. WILCOTT SAID THAT ALTHOUGH THE TRADITIONS AND THE
REGULATIONS OF THE AGENCY SEPARATED MEMBERS OF THE SUPPORT STAFF
SUCH AS HIMSELF FROM INTELLIGENCE OFFICERS AND OTHER OFFICIALS,
HE FRATERNIZED WITH OPERATIONAL PERSONNEL WHILE HE WAS ON NIGHT-
WATCH DUTY, IN OCCASIONAL OFF-DUTY CONVERSATIONS AND AT THE
TELLER'S CAGE WHERE HE MADE HIS DISBURSEMENTS.
HE SAID THAT IN THE MONTHS AFTER KENNEDY'S DEATH HE HAD
SEVERAL CONVERSATIONS WITH PERSONNEL INVOLVED IN COVERT OPERATIONS.
THOSE TALKS, HE SAID, CONVINCED HIM THAT OSWALD, WHO HAD BEEN
STATIONED AT ATSUGI AIR BASE, JAPAN, HAD BEEN RECRUITED TO INFILTRATE
THE SOVIET UNION AS A SPY.
ONLY ONE CONVERSATION
MR. WILCOTT SAID THAT HE COULD RECALL ONLY ONE SPECIFIC
CONVERSATION, WHICH OCCURRED SHORTLY AFTER JACK RUBY SHOT OSWALD
IN DALLAS. IN AN ACCOUNT OF THE CONVERSATION THAT HE PREPARED FOR
PUBLICATION, MR. WILCOTT NOTED, 'I WAS TALKING WITH SOMEONE, I
CAN'T RECALL WHO FOR SURE, AND I EXPRESSED DISBELIEF ABOUT OSWALD
EVEN BEING A C.I.A. PROJECT. I WAS TOLD SOMETHING LIKE, "WELL,

JIM, SO AND SO DREW AN ADVANCE SOMETIME IN THE PAST FROM YOU FOR
OSWALD! OR FOR THAT PROJECT UNDER SUCH AND SUCH A CRYPTO,"
"IT WAS A FAMILIAR CRYPTONYM TO ME AT THE TIME, WHICH I
HAVE SINCE FORGOTTEN, AS WELL AS THE TIME THAT THE ADVANCE OF
FUNDS WAS DRAWN," HE WROTE..
THERE APPEAR TO BE SEVERAL DISCREPANCIES IN THE RECOLLECTIONS
OF MR. WILCOTT, A GRAY-HAIRED MAN OF MEDIUM HEIGHT. FOR INSTANCE
HE REMEMBERED HAVING LEARNED OF THE KENNEDY ASSASSINATION ON AN
AFTERNOON FLIGHT OF A PRIVATE PLANE. HOWEVER, KENNEDY WAS SHOT
AT MIDDAY IN DALLAS, WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN EARLY THE NEXT MORNING
IN JAPAN.
OSWALD SERVED IN THE FAR EAST FROM 1957 UNTIL NOVEMBER 1958
AND WAS DISCHARGED FROM THE MARINE CORPS BEFORE MR. WILCOTT WAS
SENT TO TOKYO. MR. WILCOTT SAID THAT HE HAD BEEN TOLD THAT OSWALD
HAD BEEN TAKEN TO JAPAN FOR QUESTIONING AFTER RETURNING FROM THE
SOVIET UNION IN 1962.
INTEREST IN RUSSIAN
THERE HAS BEEN SPECULATION ABOUT WHETHER OSWALD CAME UNDER
THE CONTROL OF THE INTELLIGENCE AGENCY IN JAPAN. IN A RECENT BOOK,
"LEGEND, THE SECRET WORLD OF LEE HARVEY OSWALD," EDWARD JAY EPSTEIN
DESCRIBES OSWALD'S INTEREST IN THE RUSSIAN LANGUAGE AND HIS
STRANGE CONTACTS WITH JAPANESE CIVILIANS.
BUT OFFICIALS OF THE AGENCY HAVE DENIED UNDER OATH HAVING
EVER RECRUITED, TRAINED OR MANIPULATED OSWALD, AND FORMER SENIOR
OFFICIALS OF THE AGENCY HAVE ANGRILY DENOUNCED AS IRRESPONSIBLE
ATTEMPTS TO CONNECT THE AGENCY TO THE ASSASSINATION..
THE AGENCY WILL NOT SAY WHETHER IT HAS EMPLOYED INDIVIDUALS,
MR. WILCOTT SAID THAT AFTER LEAVING TOKYO IN JUNE 1964 HE SERVED
AT THE AGENCY'S OFFICES IN ROSSLYN, VA; AT THE MAIN HEADQUARTERS
IN MCLEAN, VA., AND AT THE STATION IN MIAMI. HE SAID THAT HE
RESIGNED IN APRIL 1966.
MR. WILCOTT SAID THAT AFTER LEAVING THE AGENCY HE BECAME
ACTIVE IN THE MOVEMENT AGAINST THE VIETNAM WAR AND DEVELOPED AN
INTEREST IN LEFT-WING POLITICAL CAUSES. HE SAID THAT HE BEGAN
CIRCULATING HIS ACCOUNT OF THE CONVERSATIONS CONCERNING. OSWALD
SEVERAL YEARS AGO BUT THAT THEY WERE NEVER PUBLISHED.
