1974,

however, our contact within Gobernacion told (CU)

GIANCANA from the

country, to the United States,

within 24 hours

"In meetings held with our contact on 23 August,

28 September, and I October 1974, we brought up the

subject of GIANCANA.,

The contract said that the

local immigration authorities had been seeking

GIANCANA because he was in the country illegally.

They finally located him in July,

arrested him on

the spot, and deported him the following day.

The

expulsion was not carried out on the basis of any

specific information supplied by the US Embassy,

were there any indications that he was engaged in

any criminal activity here.

Rather it was an

internal GOM decision to expel an unwanted
