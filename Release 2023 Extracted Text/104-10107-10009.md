D.C. and she would have the Drug Enforcement Administration

Miami Regional Office inform me if and when the trial was

rescheduled.

SE Division

to Headquarters on 11 January 1977. I

also forwarded Reference

and the Office of General Counsel, Mr. Edmund Cohen.

On 28 February 1977 I was contacted by SA Robert

Fredericks of the DEA Miani Regional Office and informed that

the Hemming trial was scheduled to begin 2 March 1977.

Fredericks asked

me to be on standby to travel to Miami to
