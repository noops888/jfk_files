dnasmuch as this una a losing proposition for him financlally.

After a brief discussion, it was agreed that the contract

could be amended to cover a period of thirteen months under

which he otall malotaine the come benefito which were set

forth in the original agreement. He chen voiced objectiona to

the use of his nosigned pocudonym and gove the general impros-

sion or relunetance to become associated under any terms of

agreement.

2. He advised that he had been invited to Florida in

August and had a resulting medieal problem consisting of

fungus which developed on this trlD.

He stated that at noon

on 9 october, he was to receive the resulte of tests run by

two independent doctore when he had conaulted and therefore

was in no position to morally commit binsell to this contract

under any terms.

fortunately Povell and I were introduced in

altas and at this point we departed from the meeting.

3. We later learned that the subject had been given the

true name of the All proprietary during the above-mentioned

visit in Florida. AMulD

18 October 1868

MENORANDUM FOR THE RECORID

SUBJECT: Meeting with John Thomas Duncan: Project AMWIDE Candidate

(1145 - 1515 hours, & October 1969; Rosshya, Virginig)

63

1. Donald Wintere and I met briefly with "Tom" Duncan in the lobby

of the Holiday Inn, Rosslyn, Virginia, after which Duncan and I had lunch

at the Orleans House. The purpose of the meeting was to dacuss any prob-

lem arcas or questions which Dancan may have had incident to his coming

"on board." Further, I was to remain with Duncan unill such time as he would

be introduced to John Martin that afternoon. (NOTE: The latter cession was

arranged for the purpose of having Duncan aign the contract which had been

prepared for kim, and to emplain his cover arrangement and other pertirent

administrative details.)

2. During the earlier discusaton, Wintere, Duncan and I chatted for

nearly thirty minutes; though Duncan mentloned (1) the akin fungus which ho

had contracted during an earlor viait to Florida; and (2) lia desire to conter

by telephone with his doctore concerning the reculto of recent slan teats,

Duncan did not give any indication that he intended to refuse the posizon for

which he had been solected. Having still anothas appaintmenty Wintcra)es.

cused himaell at about 1230 hours and told Duncan that he hoped they might

have an opportunity to got togethor prior to Duncan's departure.

3. Subsequently, Duncan and I lunched together, during which time the

conversation turned to Duncan'e recent travels and his several visite to univer

aity campuses while enroute to Washington. He mentioned that he had found

the doctoral program at the University of Minnesota particularly attracts.

He did not say that he intended to enroll at that institution, but he several times

alluded to "picking up the doctorate" at some future date.

With reference to

the aforementioned AMWIDE position, Duncan stated that he could not do kay.

thing-- (while in the Agency's employ) which might run counter to his

"principles"or set of values. I assured him that it was extremely unlikely

that he would experience any difficulty in that regard, and I recalled at that

time how casual he seemed throughout our brief discussion of his forthcoming

affillation with the Agency. In retrospect, it seems quite clear that Duncan

was not really interested in being reassured; his decision to reluce the Agency's

offer of employment had likely been scached days before.

03

4. During the course of the afternoon mecting with Martin, and later

with George Powell and Richard Elladeau, it was my impression that neither

the torms of the contract nor the asciument of a pseudonym was of para-

mount concern. Rather, Duncan'e expressed misgivinge were only superficial

excuses for backing out of a relationship which he had come to lew as untenable.

Doubtless,

his skin condition was a factor, however, had Duncan been suiciently

enthusiastic about joining the AMWIDE project, it is my feeling that he would

have done so deapite his malady. (NOTE: The doctors reportedly told Duncan

that many people living in Floatda lad the same problem, and that Duncan "could

live with it. ")

5. In sum, it is my opinion that Duncan was unwilling to accept the job

regardless of the terms which he might be able to exact, e. go, thirtcon monche

as opposea to two ycars, etc. it is conceivable that had it not beca for Duncan's

desire to vicit relatives in the washington, D. Co, area, he may nos have pres

sented himself at all. Why Duncan agrced to meet with Marting Dorel and

Biladeru remains something of a mystery to me. He may have felt come obligation

to WinterBag for whem he erpressed ligh regard, or ha may have done to simply

out of curlosity.

6. Security Implicationa: Known to Duncan are the true name and adercas

Of AMWIDE's production facility, and the true name of Cedric D. BARTLUCCI.

Though it is not believed that Duncan will cause this information to become

known, Station JMCOBRA has been alerted to the possibility.

Andrew J. Percival, •Tr.

SUBJECT

DUNCAN, Jchn Thomas

#517 682

1.

Reference is made to your request dated 24 June 1968 for a

Provisional Covert Security Approval to permit contact and assessment

of subject for use as

a reporter/announcer for the AMVIDE Production

Facility.

In accordance with the provisions set forth in Clandestine

Services Instruction No. 10-5 and Clandestine Services Instruction

Field No. 10-5, a Provisional Covert Security Approval 1s granted

for the use of the Subject as described in your request as set forth

in paragraph 1, above.

Subjects of Provisional Covert Security Approvals are not

to represent themselves as, nor are they to be represented as, employees

of CIA.

Your attention is called to the fact that a Provisional Covert

Security Approval does not constitute complete compliance with the

provisions of CIA Regulation 10-3. Therefore, if you should desire at

a later date to change the status or use of this individual, a request

for approval to cover any proposed change should be submitted to this

5. This approval becomes invalid in the event action is not

taken within 90 days of the date of this memorandum.

OPERATIONS CONTACT REPORT

SUBJECT: Mecting with IDEN and Wile

DATE AND PLACE: 23 July 1868, 1000 - 2000 HourG, Albiguerque,

New Mexico

1. Clyde B. MEGENNITY first met IDEN alone during the morning

of 23 July; the meeting was held in MEGENNITY'& lotel room. MEGENNITY

Introduced timeol! as a representntive a LNHARP, Indicating to IDEN that

he was involved in work of a confidential nature for LNHARP. IDEN tas

then given the broed outline of the AMWIDE Job. This Included location in

the JACORRA area, work as a producer/corint uriter, posalble travel

throughout the Caribbean, and a general calary bracket around $10, 000.

IDEN waS aloO told that INHARP would pay his tranportation and moving

coste to the JMCOBRA area.

2. IDEN ctated that ho had elready intended to submit (on 1 August)

a thisty day socionation notice from his current fob as the Univereity oi

New Merico's TV Studio. He indicated that ha and lie wife pianned to go

Switzerland, le initcatca come regret ovor the possibility ci having to

that the AMWIDE cfer would afford him.

3. In answering additional questions about the job itself, IDEN was

toid that he would be working ostensibly for a comniercial company en-

gaged in the preparation of program materials for the Latin American

audience. IDEN was advised that these programs weuld be of sociall

economic nature, designed to he progressive and reformist in tone.

IDEN seemed most interested in the concept and, according to Beveral

remarks he made throughout the day, the nature of the broadcasts tate

in quite well with his own political thinking concerning the Latin America

area.

At soon time MEGENNITY wet IDEN's wife. She le an intelu-

gent and vivacious person who obvlously would be very much interested

in, and involved in, anything her husband would be doing. She was given

more or less the same cover run down concerning the AMWIDE Job.

She

expressed great interest and asked if there wes any role she could do in

this venture.

5. During the afternoon IDEN and his wife drove MEGENNITY

throughout the Albuguerque and Santa Fe area showing him several sights,

but also discuseing the overall job considerations and ramifications.

6. IDEN indieated to MEGENNITY that his Spanish was adequate for

handling virtually all situations.

He feels completely at ease verbally

with the language and indicated he could conduct Spanish interviews and

ersonal reporting Jobs for AMWIDE. It did not seem appropriate to test

hio Spanish cagability. tus wife has little or no spanish. Nelther IDEN

nor bla wile has travelled or lived in the eastern United States. The loca

cí gaing to the JMCOBRA area obvioualy is new to them and they approach-

ed it with come rosarvations. MEGINNITY indicated that 18 a chort visit

to the SMICOBRA area might catfely their curtocity, and asiat them in

making a decition concerting the acceptance of the AMWIDE job, that

such a vialt could probably be arranged.

7. It 18 MEGENNITY's opinion that both these indieiduals are

highly suited for the AMIDE job. They are curious intellectually, have

a very pregmatic cutlook on political matters, are most enthuciastic

about tlinga which interest them, and seem like a fine team asset to have

at the AMiIDE Facility. MEGENNITY fcels, wherever posaible, we

should make inducements to insure that IDEN and his vile decice lavorably

in acceptance of the ANWIDE job. MEGENNITY unged them to call him at

any time they had questions and coulderations and, above all, not to male

any final decision (particularly ne ative) vithout discussing it vith MEGE-

NNITY (what NECENNITY had in nind here, was the flambility to sussest

that thay might go to Europe for is long ae three mouths and then return

to start at the AMWIDE job aroind 1 December).

8. The expertence in vaiting the IDENS, both of whom are young,

without roots - either family or professionally and who are already

giving up their current jobs, indicates that the problem of recruiting

persoanel for AMWIDE is indeed going to be a difficult one. It is MEGE-

NNITY's opinion thai from all the other candidates we will hardly find
