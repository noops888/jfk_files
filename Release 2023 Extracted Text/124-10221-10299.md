the information concerning this individual is common now-eage CubA

in certain circles. A second individual, ORIANDO GARCIA VASQUEZ

was described as a Cuban National in charge

security of the President of Venezuela and also a CIA source,

and apparently in charge of security for high levels of

Venezuelan Government in general.

tape was completed to the satisfaction of his Cuban

Intelligence corroboraters and he described the finished product

as a "bombshell". The tape was then submitted to FIDEL CASTRO

for review and approval:

CASTRO reviewed the film prior to its

submission to the Political Bureau and after CASTRO's review it

was sent back to their group for revision.

A number of cuts

were made in the video tape which is apparent when viewed in

that the tape in part lacks continuity.

Reference to BRASTOS FERNANDEZ and ORLAND GARCIA

VASQUEZ was deleted from the video tape.

Cut that

AL)

DE ARMAS recalled, that again on his own, he made a

statement at the beginning of the press conference in which he

remarked that the statements he was making were voluntary. His

interview with CASTRO lasted for approximately twenty minutes and

he expressed a completely willing and positive attitude to CASTRO

in the release of the press conference.

He did not object in any

way to the revisions which CASTRO had found necessary.

DE ARMAS'

impression from his interview with CASTRO was that CASTRO attempted

to convey the impression to him that he or the Cuban Government were

doing DE ARMAS a favor in permitting him to make the press release.

At this point in the interview, DE ARMAS explained

that he did not feel that the information that he furnished in

the press release was of any great damage to the United States

Government in that it contained many obvious untruths ang

misinformation. As an example, he purposely identified Mr.

an employee of the CIA when he is actually

an employee of DEA.

He reiterated that his motivation throughout

all of this activity was to ingratiate himself with the Cuban

Government in order to place himself in a position whereby

he could be of assistance to the United States Government.

DE ARMAS

accepted full responsibility for all

his actions as .

noted throughout this entire affair.

FARMAS noted that he had made some comments concerning.

one FELIX MARTINEZ whom he identified as a Cuban exile who left

sometime during the revolution and is connected with the

Anti-CASTRO news media.

DE ARMAS did not know MARTINEZ 'and

was simply briefed on his activities by Cuban Intelligence, which

information was reflected in his news release.

He also referred

In regards to the ROLANDO MASFERRER murder, DE ARMAS claimed

that Abdala considered MASFERRE? as an obstacle to Its efforts and

had formulated plans for his assassination.

The possibility of

planting C-4 plastic explosive in his automobile was explored.

After a number of discussions, of which DE ARMAS was privy,

someone in Abdala made the statement to forget about the

plans to kill MASFERRER. DE ARMAS stated that shortly thereafter

MASFERRER was killed when his automobile was bombed.

After the

bombing,

Mr. ROBERT MILLS of the FBI Miami, approached DE ARMAS and

inquired as to any information he may have

as to the bombing and whether

he was personally involved in it.

DE ARMAS advised MILLS of the discussions

denied any direct knowledge 'of MASFERRER's murder.

Cuban Intelligence were aware that DE ARMAS was affiliated

with Abdala and they also believed that he had direct knowledge of

the MASFERRER killing. As a result, during his debriefings, DE ARMAS

attributed the receipt of plastic explosiye C-4 from BOB MILLS whom

he purposely identified/asja CIA Officer.

Then he claimed that he gave u

the explosives to Abdala with the implication that Abdala

responsible for MASFERRER's murder.

WiSA

DE ARMAS claimed that an individual named MA

LESIN

although claiming to be an anti-Castro Cuban in the Miami

ETorida

area, is a close personal friend of CASTRO and RAUL CASTRO.

He is

the director of an anti-Castro magazi

yet the feeling in

Havana is

that he may be working for CASTRO.

MOULION took the position

publicly that the full story concerning DE ARMAS had not come to

light and thereafter statements concerning his treason were unfounded

at the time.

About 3 days after his defense of DE ARMAS,

his automobile was bombed with the result that MOULION

lost both his legs. DE ARMAS had no knowledge of the bombing
