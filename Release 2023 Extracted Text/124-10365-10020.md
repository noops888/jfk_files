I. PREFACE

A. Purpose of Paper

This paper has been prepared to compare the results

of the 1967-68 interrogations of YURI NOSENKO with a CIA

paper dated February, 1968, entitled "The Examination of

the Bona Fides of a KGB Defector." This CIA paper was based

on previous interrogations of NOSENKO and concluded that

NOSENKO is not a bona fide defector

According to the paper, in arriving at this

conclusion the lengthy interrogations of NOCENKO, analysis

of KGB operations

which he related and comparison of his

assertions with collateral information from, ther sources

were considered.

B. Background

For convenience in assessing these papers, the

following chronology of events is set forth: lU)

NOSENKO first made contact with CIA in Geneva in

June, 1962. After several meetings he returned to Russia

and was not again in contact with CIA until his return to

Geneva in January, 1964.. On his return to Geneva he indicated

SECRET

Significant inaccuracies were detected in the CIA

paper regarding the KEYZERS, MORONE and ABIDIAN cases.

Contrary to statements in the paper, (KEYZERS was not inter-

viewed about homosexual activities before he left Moscow;

MORONEj did have contact with a girl at American House posing

as a West German Journalist; the Soviet maid TATYANA FEDOROVICH

did have access to ABIDIAN's living quarters within six months

after his arrival in Moscow.

COMMENT :

A number of previous CIA conclusions

regarding this period were based on deficient

interrogations of NOSENKO and inadequate

collateral inquiries. These conclusions have

been invalidated by current interrogation and

collateral Inquiries and there is no substan-

tial basis for doubting NOSENKO's basic claims

(V)

regarding this period.

1962-64 Period

It is concluded in the CIA paper that NOSENKO's

claims of being Chief of the American-British Commonwealth/f(4)

12

SECRET

NH 50953 DocId: 32318825 Page 10

SECRET

is alleged that NOSENKO did not indicate the sources from

which he obtained the information regarding the cases.

4)

During current interrogation NOSENKO provided

sources

or logical explanation for his knowledge in sixteen of the

nineteen cases referred to above. He also provided adequate

clarification regarding three of the other five cases which

were subjects of CIA criticism. In addition a current review

of his notes by NOSENKO provided the translation "ECTOR",

Instead of "ACTOR"' or [PROCTOR"| prevously obtalned, as the

name of an agent. Collateral investigation has developed

a logical suspect by this name. (Logical suspects named

5 (0).

"ACTOR"' or "PROCTOR

were not previously identifled.)

COMMENT:

Previous interrogations of NOSENKO in

which information was not obtained regarding

the sources for these cases were obviously

Inadequate. Current interrogations have

provided significant clarifying information. 3(U)

SESHET

I. New Cases and New Information

The current interrogations of NOSENKO have developed

six new cases involving nine people which were previously not

uncovered during his interrogations. Collateral investigation

has identified six of these persons and one (DOMENICO CANALA) U

has been interviewed and admitted the allegations. This case

1s considered significant corroboration of NOSENKO. JO

Additional significant data was developed on three

cases previously mentioned by NOSENKO. Data in one case (the

Brussels case) may assist in the identification of a KGB agent

Who supplied NATO codes. * (U)

Considerable interesting, new and confirmatory data

was obtained during the current interrogations. Twelve examples

are cited

COMMENT:

The new cases, new information and

confirmatory data obtained in the current inter-

rogations and collateral inquiries also clearly

establish that the previous interrogations were

deficient and collateral inquiries inadequate.

Failure to acknowledge significance of NOSENKO'S

personnel identifications and organizational data

denotés lack of objectivity in ClA paper.

KARLAMOVA and the other was his arrest in

1954 when he used a KGB cover document to

obtain treatment for venereal disease. As

a result he was removed as Komsomol Secretary.

In addition the "Characteristic" which was prepared

on him In early 1955 was critical of him and his

mother had

interceded with FETR FEDOTOV, Chief

of SCD, who transferred NOSENKO to the 7th

Department. This intercession possibly prevented

tages 76-90 relate to NOSENKO's assignment to

operations against American correspondents. It was stated

that although NOSENKO could give a breakdown of the network

type of

agents, he had foreotten their true names and could

not provide personality information on any of them

which he turned over to PHILLIP VASIIYEVICH KISLITSYN

He

had no opportunity to use "'RAKETA" in 1953.

"RAKETA" was an agent for some officer of Section II,

it Is stated that (Colonel EARl I.

On pages 89 and 90 the paper indicates that NOSENKO

correctly identified TRA B. RICHARDS

on him. It was stated, however, that NOSENKO referred to

COMMENT :

On December 11, 1967, (N-64), NOSENKO, in

response to a request, furnished a handwritten list

of his agents.. For the period 1953-54 he listed as

an agent a teacher of the Russian language who was

giving lessons to correspondent CLARK. He also listed

The CIA paper also relates that the KGB agent GEORGE

BLAKE furnished to KGB in 1959 a 19 page document covering a

conference held in London between British and CIA representatives

outlining British and American use of tourists for intelligence

purposes. The KGB was therefore fully aware of the use of

tourists and it was stated that the substance of this informa-

tion, if not the document itself, would have been brought to:

the attention of the Deputy Chief of the American-British

tourists for intelligence. The lst Department

of SCD wrote the final report about overall

American Intelligence operations against the USSR,

but NOSENKO's portion regarding use of tourists was

considered good and was accepted as written

(4)

NOSENKO stated that there was an analysis each

year regarding use of tourists for intelligence and

even in 1955 there were some indications of tourist

use by Americans including "little facts'' - how the

tourists acted, trying to get military information,

trying to find drops, studying candidates for

recruitment, etc. Each year they had good examples

for the analysis including the use of other

nationalities by the Americans. NOSENKO, however,

could not remember any of the specific examples

used in the analysis.

who was mentioned as mailing a letter, NOSENKO stated

that this case, at the beginning, was

task for the

7th Department. ("MC GUIRE"

was an

"aspirant"' (student)

"and he arrived in Russia having several tours and

had about 30 or 40 days." He was young and alone

and although there was no information on him in the

Archives he was suspected because of his "legend"

(stated reason for coming to the USSR): He, therefore

was the subject of coverage which detected his mailing

of a letter in Minsk. This was reported to Moscow by,

KGB in Minsk, apparently directed to GRIBANOV, who

turned the case over to the First (American) Department

which thereafter handled the investigation.: This

happened in the late 1950's but NOSFNKO could not

recall the year. NOSENKO stated that the letter

matled by this IMC COHAN - MC CUIRE:]

was going to

Russian. (The transfer of this case from the 7th to

the Ist Department suggests that the Russian to whom

the letter was mailed. was being used in an operational

game by the 2nd Section of the lst Department.)

It should be noted that the MC GOWAN

is mentioned in the KGR document acquired by CIA

in 1961 which, as noted below, NOSENKO reviewed

knowledge of this case obviously could have been

acquired at that time, although it might well have

been acquired when KGB, Minsk, was coverine him

question, NOSENKO said he saw very little information"-

which emanated from the FCD regarding American use

of tourists for intelligence; however, he had seen

passages. from a document which was in possession

of SCD and which related to discussions in London

the content of the document after GOLITZYN's defection

and some cases mentioned therein were considered

compromised and "i'd out." He did not believe the

document contained the names of any persons who had

been recruited but mostly related to suspects.

He

volunteered the name BARTHELEMY as the only name thaf

On August 1, 1968, (N-213), NOSENKO stated

ARTEMEV was selected as Security Officer. for the

delegation because he knew English and French. The

2nd Section did not have anyone with language

capabilities. This may explain why an officer of

the ist Section, would have been given the task of

directing BELITSKIY in Geneva rather than an officer

of the 2nd Section which handled the case. It is also

noted that BELITSKIY was the subject of investigation.

However, NOSENKO in the current interviews does not

claim that ARTEMEV was inexperienced or that he

(NOSENKO) exercised any supervisory functions of

He said this was probably known to KRUPNOV, his

NOSENKO's limited participation in the case, his lack

of knowledge of the girl friend does not seem unusual.

10. PAVEL FEDOROVICH SHAKHOVY

On page 291 it is concluded that NOSENKO did not

direct the investigation of PAVEL FEDOROVICH SHAKHOV in Geneva

in 1962. The SHAKHOV case is discussed on pages 276-278 and

it is noted therein that NOSENKO claimed SHAKHOV was not and

never had been a KGB officer. It was

stated that RASTVOROV had

identified him as a KGB officer, PETROV and DERYABIN reported

that his photograph was familiar, BOURBON identified him as an

"employee"

of KGB, an FBI source said he was a pure diplomat

(n)

COMMENT:

NOSENKO was interviewed concerning SHAKHOV on

February 24, 1968, (N-108), and related that he was a

diplomat in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs from the

1930's and before that had worked for the Young

Communist League in leningrad. In the 1940's he

had worked for the Soviet "Embassy" in the USA and

was an FCD agent with the code name "RiCHARD". In the

1950's KGB stopped work with him as an agent and put his

file in the archives. He participated in many meetings

and conferences relating to disarmament. In the late

1950's KGB started a "checking file" on him because

he was suspected of connections with American

Intelligence and there was a "signal" indicating

a connection with the American dipiomat MARK. (S) (U)

Because of these suspicions, in 1962 a plan was prepared

to check him and NOSENKO was sent to Geneva as security

been initiated before 1962, possibly 1960 or 1961.

After NOSENKO's 1962 report regarding coverage in

Geneva, PETR IVANOVICH MASSYA was later sent to

Geneva with a delegation and also checked SHAKHOV

negatively.

NOSENKO commented that, although the file was

With regard to the identification of SHAKHOV

If NOSENKO was mistaken and

COMMENT:

This case has not been clarified but no

ulterior motive is seen in NOSENKO's insistence

that the first incident occurred in 1958-59, if it

were not true. His insistence can only raise

questions concerning the accuracy of his

recollections.

On page 309 it is stated that NOSENKO's apparent

ignorance of LEE HARVEY OSWALD's communications with the Soviet

Embassy in Washington (in efforts to return to the USSR in 1963)

discredits his claim to complete knowledge of all aspects of che

KGB relationship with OSWALD.

it is noted that NOSENKO alleged that a telegram had been

received by the KGB Residency in Geneva on February 4, 1964,

ordering NOSENKO to return to Moscow. Eventually NOSENKO

retracted this assertion and stated that there was no recall

telegram; that he invented the telegram to hasten his defection.

It is stated that [special intelligence does

not confirm the

existence of the recall telegram but. Scolch reported on

of the FCD had complained to the 7th Department,

SCD, that this name had been included in a

communication sent by Intourist through the

IV. NEW CASES AND NEW OR CONFIRMATORY INFORMATION

Information set forth above regarding the cases

discussed in the CiA paper has clearly indicated that the

current series of interrogations of NOSENKO in 1967 and

1968 have been much more thorough and have produced

voluminous information clarifying data obtained fron him

in previous interviers. Of particular significance,

however, in addition to that set forth above is information

obtained during the current series of interviews which is

completely new. Some of the information relates to new cases

and some of it is new information on cases mentioned previously.*

Set forth below is a summary of the most significant data

in these categories and additional new and confirmatory data

obtained during the current interrogation. This material not

only suggests that the previous interviews were inadequate

It was noted that she reported this recruitment approach

in January, 1959, and later furnished details of chis attempt

to a State Department security officer.

This case is undoubtedly identical with a case

previously reported by ANATOLIY GOLITZYN concerning an American

secretary who rebuffed a recruitment attempt. The two cases

had not been tied together prior to the current series of

interviews of NOSENKO

On November 18, 1967, (N-31), NOSENKO stated that

although REINER

I'd have considered CHELNOKOV to be an

Intourist official, NOSENKO believed REINER W

was very

sly, "suspected"' CHELNOKOV and used him to settle questions

which could not be settled through Intourist. He did not

believe that RETNER

Na know CHELNOROV's full name and

said that CHELNOKOV had a "city number." NOSENKO had previously

explained that KGB officers frequently gave their contacts a

"city telephone number"' rather than the telephone number of

their KGB office although the telephone would be physically

located in the office of the KGB officer

On July 3,

1968, (N-207), NOSENKO stated he did not

know whether REINER

Knew CHELNOKOV under his true name. On

knew

two Soviets named CHELNOKOV; one worked in the section of

Intourist that handled Intourist guides and appeared to hold

the position of supervisor. The other was introduced to him

in 1958 by an Intourist official SERGI M. GUSROV, as "an

important friend", who could help REINEr

that YURIY BELIKOV served as interpreter for DUBAS during the

first interview (1957 or 1958), but DURAS was probably accompanied

by somebody from the 6th Department in the 1962 or 1963 interview
