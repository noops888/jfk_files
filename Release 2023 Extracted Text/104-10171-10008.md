• the hands of JMWAVE through two distinct channels.

prior to 7 July 1962 AlCOG-2 through a cut-out had delivered

to AMBLEAK-2 some material. AUCOG-2 does not know ANBLEAK-?.

AMBLEAK-2 brought it out to AMBLEAK-1 who on ? July 1962

turned the "pouch" over to HAWLOTT, AMBLEAK-1'S C/O.

intercepted this "pouch" and xeroxed the covor pages of the

reports which were sonerated by ALIMPEX; the material was

and sent on its waj.

and they in turn delivered the matertal to NOAHIR(P)

the AUSPELL C/O, on or about 19 July.

This is the background to a story which now gains new

Importance.

The information which was copted by HAWLOTT 1g

organization,

therefore Headquarters. will have to be satisfied

with copies of the original documents for some of the import/
