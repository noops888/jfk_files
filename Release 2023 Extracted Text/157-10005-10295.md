actions? This paper is one of a scries that will attempt to

answer. the question. It will first examine the predecessor

agencies to the ClA in order that the establishment of the

CIA may be placed in historical perspective. Next, it will

set out the legislative history of the National Security Act

of 1947, the basic charter of the CIA, and the National

Security Council directives which instructed the CIA to con-

duct varzous forms of covert action. Finally, it will present

i legal analysis of the 1947 Act. Other papers in the series

will examine the impact on the CiA's authority to conduct

covert action of Congressional provision of funds of the CIA,
