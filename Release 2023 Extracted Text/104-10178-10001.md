From à negative point of view, WiNUGGET coverage of the

home phone of WKSCARLET-3 was useful in that it did not reveal

any indications that he was. involved

in narcotics trafficking.

Since he also successfully passed his SGSWIRL, and satisfied

the Station in a debricfing that he was not trafficking in

narcotics, the

WKNUGGET coverage of WISCARLET-3 was discontinuea.
