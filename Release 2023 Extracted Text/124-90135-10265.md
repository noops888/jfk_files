Portuguese service,/Subject had contacted one Lindsey Ling, aka: Ling

in Santa Maria, the Azores.

Ling currently resides in Madrid where he

arrested there in December 1958 on suspicion of espionage,.

of September 1960, reportedly in Bermuda, where Ling was planning to go

to determine the feasibility of establishing another restaurant.

Jft 3.: It is requested that Subject be questioned concerning the nature and

extent of his association with Ling and other Chinese, and that this

office be advised of any information which may reflect espionage or

other illegal activities affecting USAF interests.

ation with Wiener also should be explored.
