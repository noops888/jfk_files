AMTURVY OPERATION

HIH: 19-6-88

Felt it -184,5

67-5/7

1. The AMTURVY Operation was designed for the

purpose of conducting sabotage operations.

against Cuba.

It consisted of a net of 13 AMTURVY assets whose primary

function, apart from sabotage, was the preparation of

target studies and analysis of sabotage operations. The

files contain only one reference to assassination, that

in 1963 and the continuation of the same plan through to

1965.

Based on a review of the files, it is apparent

that the following assassination plan could have been known

to

the Cubans, including the overall purpose of the AMWURVY

Operation.

2. ASSASSINATION PLAN - AMTURVY -13•

AMTURVY-13 (Mario SALABARRIA) was closely

acquainted with Fidel Castro as far back

as 1947 and there is son

some indication that they both may have

been involved in

the

1947 plan to topple the Trujillo Government in the Deminican

Republic. However, in 1948, SALABARRIA waS

responsible for

the arrest of Fidel Castro, this due to the latters agitation

on behaif of one Emilio TRO. Salabarria was later sentenced

to 30 years in prison for having murdered TRO/. He remained

in prison until 1961 when he appealed for parole to one

Lionel SOTO Prieto (201-055332). As Salabarria had once

saved Soto's life, the latter appealed the case to Raul

Castro. Salabarria was subsequently released from prison

in Februazy,

1961. The terms of his release from jail

are unknown.

3. By the summer of 1963 Salabarria was

seeking

- weapons and funds for a proposed. assassination attempt against

Fidel Castro.

Through his confidant, AMTURVY-4p Salabarria.

C'ALTURO MINA JESE VERONA (2s.85i)

sought contact with ANTURVY-y Salabarria had known AMTURVY-1's *

brother, AMCONCERT-1 for twenty years and

assumed that AMTURVY-1

was in touch with the AGENCY (how Ad assumed this is unknown).

At his first meeting with AMTURVY-1, in the summer of 1963,

Salabarria said he was a member of a group plotting Castro's

death, and needed money and weapons in order to carry out

the plan (AMCROAK-i was also a member of this group). In

return for this assistance, Salabarria offered to carry out

miñor sabotage operations for AMTURVY-l's. "American contacts"

Chow he knew of these "contacts" is unknown, unless AMTURVY-1

told him):

4. In October 1963; when the Agency was satisfied

with Salabarria's bona fides "we" (the Agency ) managed to

get a few pistols, revolvers, and sahotage materials

into

Salabarria's hands, through AMTURVY-4. At this time AMTURVY-4

was receiving materials from the Agency through the pouch of

the (Spanish) Embassy in Havana. AMTURVY-4 was

being

assisted

in this matter by QUANTUM-S1). whether or not the materials

for Salabarrias assassination plan came through the

(Spanish)

pouch is unknown.

The following is an excerpt from UFGA 19214,

of 28 December 1964, the debriefing of AMTURVY-1 who was

successfully exfiltrated from Cuba in October 1964: (se 464 8214),

6.

By early 1904, however, the Agency had hecome

dissatisfied with Salabarria and his proposed assassination

plan, and had notified the AMTURVY net (in particular

ANTURVY -1, ANTURVY-4, and AMCROAK-1) to cease working on

the assassination idea. Salabarria's later attempt to

assass inate Fidel Castro was not approved by the Agency,

and he was in fact informed of the Agency's opposition of

to his plan.

7. COMMENTS

If as the file shows, the Agency approved

of Salabarria's plan to assassinate Fidel Castro and provided

Salabarria with the weapons (this in Octoher of 1963), Castro

could have been aware of the plan, especially as Salabarria's

case presents certain CI considerations. Salabarria had been

released from jail following a personal apeal through Raul

Castro; and this when Fidel Castro was well aware of the

fact that Salabarria was responsible for the death of a

close friend; Emilio TRO; not to mention the fact that

Salabarria was responsible for Castro's arrest in 1948.

What deal, if any, was made with Salabarria in return for

his release from jail is unknown. Nonetheless, Kas Fidel

Castro has a recorded history of not being one to forgive,

especially when he has been affected

personally as was the

case with Mario Salabarria.
