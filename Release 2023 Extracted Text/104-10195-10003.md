As -far is meeting the

payroil deadlines Subject was proficient ti this duty; but ho

norally required considerable amount of overtime work to meet

these deadlines.

He had many ideas which he presented to Chief,

Finance Branch for butterment of the payiolling system, but un-

fortunately after due consideration the majority os these ideas

nere found to be impractical and/or in violation of either good

accepted commercial practice or agency regulations. Suggestions

made to hin were outwardly accepted but upon follow-up it nas

determined that he had failed to implement these suggestions.

Overall it is the rater's opinion that the Subject was barely

the period Subject was in charge of the Payroll Section

at INWAVE his performance was, in the rater's sainion, not nore

than adequate:

He apparently was of the opinion

charge of a section relieved him of the onerous tasks of filing

and other related duties of like nature.

As far as neeting the

payroll deadlines Subject was proficient in this duty, but he

normally required considerable amount of overtime sork to meet

these deadlines.

He had many ideas which he presented to Chief,

Finance Branch for bettermen't of the payrolling system, but un-

fortunately after due consideration the majority of these ideas

were found to be impractical and/or in violation of either good

accepted commercial practice or Agency regulations.

Suggestions

made to him were outwardly accepted but upon follow-up it was

determined that he had failed to implement these suggestions.

Overall it is the rater's opinion that the Subject mas barely

adequate. in performing his assigned tasks.
