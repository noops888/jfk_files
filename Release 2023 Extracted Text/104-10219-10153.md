However, approximately tirce months after the transfer of the

been retustied to ala by the basecoisckeeper.

Only when the close suin of the ilair!/

LILYRIC barchouse sould be effected would the Statlon exyuct tu haie the rental deposis

returned. Until such tige the deposit would remain crarged to GiraDE.

The only liais

to cospletely safeguard arainst this type of action vould be for tre case officer to

acet directly with the basenouse keepers, thereby ellarating GaRade fron the operction

and causing unacceptable security risks.

It 1s believed that periodic LCFLUTTER O!

GERINDE 18 the best insuranco against a slailar occurence in the juture.

As to GERADE's regular operational revalving fund, Irregularit'es have never

been discovered in his handling of these funds. Cash counts are conlucted b: the

case officer to control the wispent portion of tho revoliino lund ty comparison viti

accountings (receipts) GaunD: -axes every two weeks.

GiLNDE's revolving fund 15

kept at the minimus asount consistant with efficient conduct of the operation for vhich

GERANDE 18 responsible.

The "other false claims" GERANDE admitted making Involved occasional use of his

Up vehicle for personal drivino unile entering all recelpts for sas en his KUBARK

accountings. Station does not consider this a najor proulem. I: GaNDE used his i

car for only operational employuent any hostile surveillance of hia sould be rolatively

easy (1.0., surveilling only when he 18 using his 2P vehicle) and it is belleved that

latitude must be alloved in this arca for indigenous ajents.

In the area of ORElDE's morale and his statement that he "1s not being

utilized to his full potential" the Station 1s as fully concerned as Readquarters. It

should be noted however, that GRINDE has never written the report setting lorth biat

he thinks he can do and when praided on this has stated that he had been thincins about

what additional work he could assume and that ha "just does not know". The reason ha

gives 18 he does not know what alce is being done in the operations aren other than thrt

to wnich ho ls already exposed. Alditional operational vork 1s assigned to GiRiNnE

when this can be done securely and taking into account compartmentation of operations.

An example of this vas his introduction to the AMROD operation. Station 1a reluctani

to expose O-H-IDE to additional operatiors only for the purpose of laproving bis somle"

sinco he alraady has considerable knowledge of many Station past and going operations.

The Station appreciates Hcadgunriers coments on the results of agRaNdE'a Lorlumar

and will make every effort to determine the best possible utilization of GoRaldE in

the suture.

The referenced dispatch forwarded the most recent contract

amendment raising GERENDE's salary to $4, 560. 00 per year.

2. In the Staton's opinion, GERENDE's continued Superlor per-

formance of his LIEMPTY Principal Agent duties justifles another salary

Increase. Headquarters attention is invited to the recent Request for Renewal

of Project LIEMPTY wherein GERENDE's duties were specified.

3. It is requested that Headquarters initiate an appropriate amend-

ment so GERENDE's contract increasing his yearly compensation to

$5,040.00. This amendment should be effective 1 January 1961.

1.

In compliance with the KUBARK regulation, CSI-F No. 230-60,

Annex A, concerning contact arrangments under emergency conditions, the

following information, including recognition signals and bona fides, Is

forwarded for Headquarters records. Due to the sensitivity of the information,

it was believed more appropriate to forvard it separately rather than to

include ir with reference (Request for Renewal of Project LIEMPTY).

2. Insoíar as can be determined at the present time, GERENDE could

probably be contacted at one of the following places:

a. Present Residence: IDENTITY A

b. Mother's Residence: IDENTITY B

c. Cover Employment Address: IDENTITY C

3. The following oral recognition signals, using the English language,

are to be used as indicated:

CONTACT: "he wie sente to the most

and Uncle."

GERENDE: "Then you are referring to the IDENTITY D."

CONTACT: "No, I am referring to your other relatives in

South Carolina, the IDENTITY E

GERENDE: "Yes, Auntie Is my Mother's sister. "

4. For use as physical bona fides, the Station is forwarding a one peso

note with the serial number T348510 for Headquarters files. GERENDE has

been given a one peso note with the next higher serial number, T348511, to

keep in a safe place pending his having to show it to some future KUBARK contact.

It has been explained to GERENDE that he is to show his half of the physical

bona fides only after the recognition signals have been completely and

accurately recited and his new contact has requested to see his physical bona

fides. GERENDE has also been instructed to assure himself of his contact's

bona fides by asking to see the contact's one peso note (T348510).

5. Assuming that adequate time will be available at the beginning of an

emergency condition, it may well be possible to instruct GERENDE in Secret

Writing so that correspondence could be conducted using IDENTITY D or E

addresses.-

MR LIEMPTY / Contract Amendment for Raymend H.

GERENDE (ps)

None, for Headquarters information only.

A.

HMMA - 13063, 5 June 1959.

HMMW-7959, i2 August 1959.

1. Forwarded herewith as Attachment No. One is GERINDE's signed

contract amendment. GERENDE is most appreciative for the ralise in salary

and is delighted with the new Terminal Payment claus?.

2. The Station interprets the Terminal Payment clause to mean any

termination by the Government or acceptance of GERENDE's rebination in

the "beat interests of the Government.

Examples in connection with the "best

interests of the Government" interpretation would involve GERENDE's resignation

for health reasons or other logical personal reasons such as a change of residence

to some geographical ared where hig services could noi be utilizid by KUBARK.

Assuming thai no security problems are involved in making such i payment, the

Station also interprets the clause to be applicable for payment to CERENDE's estate

in the event of his death while in the cinploy uf KUBARK.

3. The Station understands clearly why the clause was not written as

originally requested and concurs in Heauquarters reasoning. Certainly, the Station

would not want to give GERENDE a terminal payment, and he has been so informed,

i he elecis to resign just to reccive some extra money or to pursue some other

carcer. The Siation hastens to add, however, that to the best of ith knowledge,

GERENDE has no intention of resigning from his present KUBARK Job.

4. As requested in Reference B, enclosed as Attachment No. Two are the

original and one copy of the contract amendment dated 1 September 1957. Head-

quarters wili note that the amendment was accepted by GERENDE and approved by

the Chief of Siation, but was not formally witnessed. li is suggested that Matthew

S. DINGLEY (ps), who is presently in Headquarters, be requested to witness the

document. DINGLEY was the Case Officer handling GERENDE at the time this

amendment became effective.

BY QUALIFIED HQ. DELA CHEY

REFETENCEISI

HMMW-5626, 3 December 1957

Raymond H. GERENDE was initially employed by the Station on 18 March

1955 under provisions of an oral agreement. Effective 1 October 1955 GERENDE

salary of $3, 600.00. On 1 September 1957 his contract was amended to increase

his salary to $*, 080. 00 per annun:, which is the salary he is presently receiving.

It Is requested that a new iwo year contract be propared, to be effective 1 July 1959,

providing an increase in salary to $4, 500. 00 per annum and including a termination

clause which will give GERENDE a termination payment of one monih's salary,

calculated at the prevailing rate of compensation at the time of termination, for

each full ycar of his KUBARK employment. All other provisions of GERENDE'S

Inittal contraci should remain in force. (The increase in salary to $4, 500.09

per annuin is already covered by the LIEMPTY Project.)

2. As pointed out in the attachment to HMMA -11368, 22 Ocruber 1958,

paragraph three of MEXI-2336, 25 November 1958, and in the LIEMPTY Pield

Project Outline, GERENDE is a highly valued full-time Station asset who carries

a significant work load and who has a great deal of responsibility. He is the

LIEMPTY Principal Agent who handles the LIMITED, LILYRIC and LICALLA hase

houses, the LIENTRAP operation, the outside photographic processing and trans-

lation service and all the agents participating in these activities. He periorme

his duties in a conscientious and professional manner and his already excellent

abilities are showing continued improvement.

3. Paragraph eight of HMMA - 12095, 4 February 1959, indicated that the

Station was considering aniending GERENDE's contract to provide for some type

of retirement benefits.

Although it is recognized that indigenous agents are not

usually granted such contract provisions, the Station believes that GERENDE should

have monetary incentive, in addition to his idealogy, to make a long career with

KUBARK. Accordingly, the Station recommends that GERENDE's new contract

provide for a termination settlement of one month's salary for each full year that

lee has worked for KUBARK.

In other words, should GERENDE's career with

KUBARK last for 24 years and his yearly salary at the end of this pariod is $8,000.0o..

then he, or his heirs, would receive a lump sum payment of $16, 000.00. After

considering different types of insurance plans, an escrow account and several

other ideas, the Station considers the above proposal to come closest to meeting

the criteria of control, production incentive and creation of the desire to make

KUBARK a carcer. The date, 18 March 1955, should be used as the beginning date

for the computation of GERENDE's termination benefits.

OPERATIONAL SECURITY REVIEW OF

KAYMOND R. GERENDE'S

OPERATIONS AND ACTIVITES

SITUATION

As a result of the June 1958 LIPSTICK lap, it was decided by the Chlel

of Station on 30 June 1958 that Quinton N. OUSLER would assume direct contac

GERENDE.

DUSLER assumed contac responsolltries with GERENDE on 2 July 1958. Or

18 July 1958, the Chief of Statton decided that OUSER should be againer

permanent reaponsibiltry for the management and handling of GEREND and

GEKENDE a operartoas.

PURPOSE :

The purpose of this operattonal security revlew is threefold:

To identtly possible security prosiems and conditions;

D.

T'c establish a framework for recommendations which will

result in the Station's submission of a num support project

(LIEMPTY) with Raymond H. GERENDE as a principel agent; and

To acquatni the new case officer with the operational problema

and agent personnel with which be should have a comprehenstre

knowledge ail deralled understanding.

3.

PRINCIPAL AGENT - Raymond H. GERENDE

Background • GERENDE has been employed by KUBARK since

18 March 1955, which was fust prior to his graduatton from the Mexico

City College. He is now only 24 years of age, but in the Statton's opinion,

is a mature, experienced and dedicated KUBARK contract agent. During

the three and one-half years that he has been working for the Mexico

Ciry Station, GERENDE has participated in a varled assortment ni support

and intelligence operations. Inirially, he was tratned and used by Matthew

S. DINGLEY as & member of the LIPSTICK survetilance team, In addition,

to surveillance work, he was used as an investigator to collect operational

data on persons and organizations of Interest to the Starlon, He quickly

demonstrated & capecity for leadership and at one time was the leader of

the LIPSTICK team. He has been used as & LIFEAT Base House operator

SECRET

## Page 96

SECRET

and processor of tapes; he has excelled in this type mi work because ol

his bi-lingual Spantsh/ English factly and, more Importantly, due to

his diversified experience in clundestine operaitons which permits him

to spot operational leads much more really than the average LIPEAT

Duties - GERENDE Ls currently serving as the principal agent

in charge of LIMITED, LICALIA, LIPSTICK Photo Truck, LIJERSEY

Surveillance Team and LILYRIC.

In addition, he monitors and processes

the GMORNING and Cuban Extes LIFEAT taps. He also supervises

the photographic processing of LIPSTICK-38 (hts brother-In-law) and the

translation work of LIPSTICK-40 (his stater). lie maintans contact, with

and provides auministrative support to LIMITATIONs and o, L1O00L-

Base operators. Quite obvloualy GERENDE'& many durtes overlap the

bounds of several Station operarions, namely LIPSTICK, LUERSEY,

LIFEAT, LICOOL and several activiites which are not llsted under

wiper: formal projects such as BGMORNING, It is recognized by the Station

that it is not advisable to have one principal agent connected with ag

many operarlons as is GERENDE. However, the present scarcity of

both staff and contract agents of the principal agent type necesstiase

such efficiency measures. Every effort is belag made to compartment

the varlous segments of GERENDE's operations and to decrease, and

to eliminate where postble, all lateral communications between

agents.

security iroblems - The most serious security situarto

surronding CERENDE and his many activittes is the fact thai

LIPSTICKS 12 and 30 (two of the LIPSTICK Team memberg arrested

in the June 1958Пар) know GERENDE by true name, and knew that he

also worked lur KUBARK: in iact, LIPSTICK-30 is a close personal

trend of GERENDE's and was originally recommended for KUBARK

employment by GERENDE. The operaronal security hypothesis that

can be constructed from these existing acquaintances are too numerous

to list in this brief review, suffice to say that should GERENDE be

arrested by one of the local police ageticles, most of the rematning

support asaeta would be destroyed of so seriously compromised thar

the Starton would indeed be foolish to continue using them. It is

appropriate to state here, however, that netther GERENDE nor the

Station belleves that GERENDE has yet been named or otherwise

identified as a result of the LIPSTICK flap. It ls granted though that

any future questions by one of the local police agencies to the compro

mised LIPSTICKERS represents a continuing type of danger for GERENDE.

Based on the durtes which GERENDE Is currently performing, the readers

of this review can well imagine what the consequences to several operatons

SECRET

135 trid,

## Page 97

4.

SECRET

would be ll GERENDE were arrested by one of the local police agencies

and Inierrogated in detall. Also, the Stailon must forever be aware virt

the Incal police agericles are certally capable, for only a lem dollars, ol

selling information concerning KUBARK to the Soviets and/or Saselllies.

Recommendatlons - li would be unwise to consider terminating

GERENDE &Ince he la a highly comperent agent and since hla termination

would not elimtnate the fact that he knows a great deal aboui the Starton's

support opcrations. He has been reminded several times, and the Case

Officer wul conttnue to remind him, that his tradecran projessionalism

must Improve and stay ahead of the Ircreasing sophistication of the local

police agencies and oppostiion services operaring in Mexloo.

*** It ls the opinion of the Starlon that GERENDE should continue

to be used in about the same manner that he ls predently betng used, it

would be advisable, however, to acparate him from the two Lifessor

tmittons he-la currently handling, BGMORNING and the Oüban Extle

taps. This is suggealed nor only because of the possible future seciruly

ramificitions, but also because GERENDE does not have time to run

properly bis support mechantem and to monitor laps seven days a week.

To provide for a situation whereby one of the local pollca

agencles becomes aware of GERENDE'& Wegal activities and assuming

that elther GERENDE or the Station learns of thia before the local police

agency can take positive action, i is imperative that a warning system

of communications be established to facilitate GERENDE's removal

from Muxico. Arrangements such as those used for Hufred O. CLOWER .

could be set up or local arrangements could be made with ODUNIT or

ODOATH for a more expedirious exit from Mexico. The Case Officer

will develop this plan in detall.

OPERATIONS

Limied

(1) Target - Stattonary photographic survelllance of persons

entering and learing the LIMERICK installation.

(2) Personnel - LIPSTICK-14 is the agent in charge of the

LIMITED Base. According to GERENDE, LIPSTICK-14 18

consclentious, securly minded, speaks no English, and on

occasion is a bit over confident. He performs his operational

duttes competently and with discretion.

In addition to his

photographic durles, he is also used ocrasionally as a one-man

(MN) and fret rent and urtlitles at the LIVITED Base. His wife

(LIPSTICK-27) and son (LIPSTICK-28) live wich him at the LIMITED

Base.

LIPSTICK-28 un!Il 15 July 1958 assisted his father with photo-

graphic work at the LiVillED Base. However, on the above

date he decided to resign from his LINITED Job and, strange

8 li may seem, to devore full time to worting on a chicke

arm. LIPSTICK-28 made this decision on his own and agains

the wishes of his father. He will continue to live at the

LIMITED Buse and li la believed that no security problems will

Communications • At the present time GERENDE meete

with LIFSTICK-14 three times a week at contact pointa away from

the Base. They have seven separate contact potnts which are

used for their meerings. Usually the place of contact la pre-

arranged si the prevlous meeting, however, a rapld means of

communicatton exters whereby GERENDE

telephones LIPSTICK-14

and through a pre-arranged open code,

numbers, sets the time and place of contact. LIPSTICK-14's

consequenti;, there is a cover basis for tuch a telephonio

conversation.

A reserve system of communication with LIPSTICK-14

has not yet been arranged, GERENDE has been Instructed so do

this as soon as possible, thereby glving the Starion a means to

contact LIPSTICK-14 directly should the need ever ariss.

(1) Securry - Excluding KUBARK staff personnel, the LIMITED

Bage Is known to LIPSTICK.S-2: 14, 27 and 28 and to Oliver

G. SCANTLING and Raymond H. GERENDE and possibly to

LIPSTICK-12 (GERENDE's opinion). Stace LIPSTICK-14 ha8

DOWn LIMEWATER (LIFEAT Project) lor many years and since

LIMEWATER is LIPSTICK-2's brother, ll is important to recognize

that the destrable degree of compartmentatton between LIPSTICK/

LIMITED and LIFEAT probably does nor cxist. Altholigh LIMEWATER

must be aware of LIPSTICK-14's and 2'6 PEPRIME employment,

li has not been possible to ascertain the extent of LIMEWATER'

knowledge about their specific acrittes, and vice versa. LIPSTICK-14

Neither GERENDE nor LIPSTICK-14 are aware that KUBARK

his exteting communications arrangements with LIPSTICK-14 to

Include a new regular gystem, a rapld son-scheduled system and

a reserve system. Also, GERENDE la to revlew with LIPSTICK-14

their cover reasons for mecting and knowing each other and to be

prepared to use this cover slory should they ever be apprehended

together.

LIPSTICK- 14 was instructed on 8 August 1958 to cease all

social and bustness contact with LIPSTICK-2. Oliver G.

SCANTLING, who has previously handled LIPSTICK-14 and sees

him occasionally even now, has been directed to cease all

contact with the LIMITED Base and LIPSTICK-14 except when

approved by the Case Officer, (NOTE: I is necessary at times

for SCANTLING to debrief LIPSTICK-14 for LIMESA lesds).

a monthly salary of $1, 000,00 (MN) and he and his wife live rem

LIERSEY -12 1s the wife of LIJERSEY-2. She does most of the

Motographic and reporting work at the LILYRIC Base and hai

roven herself to be a capable and worthwhile asset. It ha

been necessary for her to become proficient in the LILYRIC work

since her husband works at his regular job during the day. She

recelves a monthly salary of $800,00 (MN).

Coit:munications - GERENDE conuicts LIEPSEY-5 twice

weekly at prearranged contact points during the late afteroon

hours, *LIJERSEY-S contacte LIJERSEY-2 iwo to three times

weekly at prearranged car contact points and receives the "take"

Ls out of lon or otherwise not avallable, GERENDE does not

know LUERSEY -12 or vice versa. No reserve syRtem of com-

muntcallons exists whereby a Station officer could contact

LUERSEY-2 directly should the need arise; however, GERENDE hEB

been instructed to set up slich a system of communications. The

In contacting hin directly.

LICALLA Bages, Insofar as the Case Officer has been able

to determine, the only indigenous agents aware of the LILYRIC

Base are GERENDE, LIJERSEYS 2, S and 12, and LIPSTICKS

38 and 40, and all of these individuals have a close connection

with the operation of the Base. The only Me-in the LILYRIC Base

the two bases.

LICALLA

(1)

live at Die LICALLA Bage. He Le an

and worke at his cover fob in the evenings. LIPSTICK-39

does an excullent and consclentlous job of photographie coverage

at the LICALLA Base, In addition to lie photos he takes, he

writes a narrative description of the events which take place

In the target's garden arca. He receives a monthly salary of

$2,000.00 (MN) and fred rent ai the LICALiA Base.

(3) Communications - GERENDE mects LIPSTICK-39 twice

weekly, usually on Tuesdays and Thuradays. They have lour

contact points, one of whitch la selected at each meeting for

use for the next meeting. In the erent that contact is noe

established, GERENDE has the initlaiive in contacing LIPSTICK-39

by phoning him at the bus line office during the evenings. Then, by

prearranged open code, a meeting stie and time are agreed on.

Since Ullver G. SCANTLING is also acquatnied with LIPST7CK-39,

it would be possible to contact him through SCANTLING should

something happen to GERENDE. However, to lachlitate proper

and secure communications procedures, GERENDE has been

directed to establish a reserve sysiem of communications with

Lipstick-39, using the customary oral and physical bonarices.

Security- The most serious security problem concerning

LICALLA Is the fact that LIPSTICK-39 1s the brother of

LIPSTICK-47

Although it is generally

believed by Station officers that LIPSTICK-39's name was not

menttoned by LIPSTICK-47 nor that any Indication was given

conceming LIPSTICK-39's Job, It must be understood that

should the local police agency decide later to interrogate

LIPSTICK-47, the prokabllity exists of compromising LIPSTICK-39

and LICALLA. The Station sees no way to overcome this

possibllity.

SECRET

It is Inportant to note here that LICALLA aCCuplEs one ol the LOUI

LIMUST properties.

While it 1s belleved that LIPJTICK-39 does

or know that KUBARK owns the Base of has anything to do wid

the other three houses, it is entrely concelvable thâi should one

of the local police agencies or the LEMLAICK personnel become

aware of LICALLA actlvities, they could very easlly arrive al

some logical conclusions about all of the LIMUST property. This

would be detrimental, lí no: fatal, to our alms. However,

another Starlon viewpoint on this same problem is that ll compromisca,

LICALLA would divert suspicion from, rather than 10, LINUST.

Should one of the local police agencies begin an Investigatton which

might tavolve LIMUST and LICALLA, then LICALLA could be

sacrificed to protect the LIMUST Base.

These possibllities

become somewhar theoretical and perhaps impractical due

to the lack of predicitbllity.of the local pollceagencles, but neverthe.

less must be welghed one against the ocher.

In view of the apparent importance of the LIMESA/LIMUST

operation a lot of thought and discuasion have transpirer ar the

Station aboui coitnutng the LICALLA uperation in uls present

locatton or suspending it fur the immediate future and attempting

to find another suitable locerion away from the LINUST property.

A sound argument can be made for termiating the base since such

an abernative might have the effect of limtring any knowledge

LIPSTICK-39 may have about the LIMESA/LIMUST Installation.

However, the reminarion of a productive base such as LICALLA

would require an explanation to LIPSTICK-39 which could nos help bur

leave him a bit suspicious, For Headquarers Information, the

local rental laws are such thas LIPSTICK-39 would not be able to

comprehend why we did not insist on him matntatning "squatters

righis" (as stated previously, LIPSTICK-39 apparently does not

know that we own LICALLA or even have an interest in any of the

other LIMUST properttes) which can eastly be done in Mexico.

Therefore, any attempt to terminate LICALLA might cause more

of a security problem with LIPSTICK-39 than permitting

LICALLA to operate as it is now. Another possibultry would be

terminating LIPSTICK-39 and putting another agert in the present

LICALLA Base. Il this measure were followed, it trould not

elimtnate the tact that LIPSTICK-39, even if termtared, would

still know of the existence of the present LICALLA Base. Still

another possibility would be to terminate LIPSTICK-39 and the

LICALLA Base; however, since LICALLA and the other LIMUST

properties are ostensbly owned by one man, LIMOUSINE, Elspictes

and investigations could still lead to LIMUST.

PHOTO TRUCK

(1)

Target - Investigarive abdet used for taking currept lilous

phoograpas of persona, places and things that are from Mme to st.

Eline of laterest to the Starlon and Headquarters.

(2)

Personnel - LIPSTICK-2, as indicated by the low numerloal

dea gnation of his cryptonym, has been employed by KUBARK lor

seycral years. At the present time LIPSTICK-2 la responstale

lor the dayto day operation of the phorogriphie survetllunce

truck. He la also used occasionally to spoi and rent operetlanal

apartmens.

In the past, LIPSTICK-2 has served as team leader

of a low level survelllance team (which was compromlsed and

subsequently disbandod), as a LIFEAT line Inspector (when he

was not bisy with the photo truck), and as a start survelllance

man (Le., used as an outside sentry during the March 1958

entry of the LIMUST Base by KUTUBE/D, KURIOT and KUCLUB

techniclans, (NOTE: LIPSTICK-2 was assigned the sask o

Survetllance team member) Is LIPSTICK-2's wife's nephew.

LIPSTICK-2's cover is buying and selling cars; however, about

the only bustness he has in this connection is when he buys and

LIPSTICK-2 also knows GERLINDE's true name, where he lives, and

his phone number. In the past he has had occaston lo telepbone

CERENDE at the latter'à home.

LIPSTICK-2 Knows DINGLEY, and

could, In an emergency siuation, contact DINGLEY, However,

GERENDE has beun Inatructed to arrange a coirpiere communica-

ttons plan with LIPSTICK-2, Including a reserve means of contact.

For security reasons, GERENDE hes been lutructed to inform

LIPSTICK-2 that his only contact is with CERENDE and that in

the future he is not to contact anyone else In the organization

without GEKENDE's permission, Also, that should contact with

GERENDE be disrupted, he la to await for the higher echelon to

establiah contact with him (all agents under GERENDE are being

go Instructed). This is particularly Imporiant in the case of

Ipsiick-2, since he has by-passed GERENDE in two or three

Instances in the past.

Security - Probably the most serlous security situation

Involving the photo truck, LIPSTICK-2 and Lipstick-24 is the

basic knowledge of the LIPSTICK survelllance team that such an

asset exists, even to the polni that one of the team members

(LIPSTICK-34) is the listed oiner of the photo truck. The personal

knowledge of LIPSTICK-2 about the LIFEAT operalon aiso represente

a security hazard of the first class. For example, ll LIPSTICK-2

were compromised and arrested as a result of hls acttvitles,

there is a possibility that he could compromise his brother,

LIMEWATER, the LIMITED Base and LIPSTICK-14, GERENDE

and our interest in the highly sensitive LIMESA/LIMUST operation.

(NOTE: According to the LIFEAT Case Officer and the former

LIPSTICK Case Officer, both LIMEWATER and LIPSTICK-2 have

been reminded on several occasions during the past few years

that they were not to diacuss any aspect of their operattons with

each ocher. Also, LIPSTICK-2, to the best of the Starlon's

Personnel • LIERSEY-4 lu of a low social class and

lives with his mother in a slum area of Merico Clty. He la

the sole support for his mother and several younger brothers

and sisters. He ls described by GERENDE as having a lot of

ambition and a strong desire to improve his standard of living

and position in llfe. The Station has found him to be a good

observer and, consequently, adequate for static survelllance

work.

Although he now has his drivers license, he is not a

capable driver and probably will never develop into one.

GERENDE has been encouraging LIJERSEY-4 to obtain employment

BB a Baleaman to supplement his KUBARK Income of $1, 000.00

(MIN) and to establish himself in a cover job. However, LIERSEY-4

has not yet obtained such employment. It la the Starion' 8

opinion that LIJERSEY-4 la definitely an asset of limited value

which the Station really needs.

is at best an asset of only limited value. LIERSEY-8 also

receives a salary of $1, 000.00 (MS) per ronch.

LIJERSEY-13 does not know LIJERSEYS-4 and 8 and Vice versa.

LAERSEY-13 le better dressed than the osher two team members

and can pass as a better educated and more socially flexible

indtvidual. He speaks fairly good English." He performs pretext

tovestigation assignments with facully and imagination and is

adept at making up cover stortes. In brief, he makes a good

Impression on the people he intervlews. He la nor a good

dilver and is too nervous to develop into one. His salary la

$1, 000.00 (NIN) por month.

(3) Communications - GERENDE has dally contact arrange

are used on designated days of each week ard the LIJERSEYS are

instructed to go to each meeting. They have standing Instructions

to continue gotne to thetr meeting sites

with the three Ll ERSEYS.

(4) Security - Insofar as knowledge of other operations,

personnel and assets is concerned, the LIJERSEYS appear to have

the best security of any of the operations handled by GERENDE.

New communicarlons plans with the LUERSEYS w ill do much

coward increasing security and ability to meet contingencles.

GERENDE will be Instructed to give refresher training to all

three LIJERSEYS in operational security, cover and communications.

The major danger existing with the LN ERSEY team, and with any

survelance ream, is the possibuty of compromise and arrest

by ore of the local pallce agencies. Should this happen, GERENDE

1. This dispatch represents the type of operational reporting

WOLDEREDE 18 VOrY exposed, and should be taken off sons of blondes enfatti,

jobo at once, Specifically, sy ideas are as follows:

3. Ra para. 3a, agent 19 very capable and should be rotained

18 socure means can be found. Getting rid of his tould not solvo the

probles.

As lone as ho 13 11 Mexico he 1s vulnerablo, Some thought

Bhould to given

to hot he would be supported in the event of arrest.

Persorally, I bellere the Station would do better to sacrifica a caso

0ff1cor than perait thinga to drag on to the point where GERADE night

roll all to tho polico.

Recommendations:

airclus be briared so as to be ever reado with an inzacuora

story to toll the polico in the event of arrest.

bo

GERBADE be told to contact one of already blown Station

officors like HAZLETT in the event of arrest and that the Station

officer ba ready to appear personally at polios station to froo

GRAENDE.

If the case officer named for this city and Garla

both know the inrocuous comer story, there shoald be little probles.

I have done it nyself. A good cover story is "looking for draft

dodgera" or sone such tale nich does not have laplications of

varking against Mexican citizeng.

'' That a second blown case officer's asse be given as an

alternato for HAZLETI, uho 1s often out of tova and unarailablo.

(not fired and hence a possible threat).

5. Ro para. 4 be This 1s tho sane situation as LITSD but not

80 likely blown to tha Sovieto. There is Do reason why GEFENDE should

6. Re para. Le, LICAlLA 18 a very special probles and should

be taken up at once with Headquarters elements working on LIES"/LIMUST.

I thought LICAlLA had been cancelled out when LIesa began to shape up.

I consider it a danger to LIMESA.

Has LIGAIlA produced anything of

value? I think we could vacate this in such a lay that the agents in

alcalia would nave no cause to ba suspicious.

(Put an obtious tail on

the agent, scare him off, ate. This would throw off the Mexican police,

too, in the event

are alresdy Wise to LICALLA through LIPSTICK 47.

He could pretend to believe the Soviets ran the tail and the gane le up.)

Racosmendation: Get rid of LICALIA unless ToTy productive, Better

do this before the remodeling bagins.

Ro para L d, photo truck, LIPSTICK-2 does know of the locations

of some of the basehouses on LIFEAT since he was a Line inspector.

Recosmendations:

8o New compartaented truck should be set up. Don't use false

names and addresses. It could result in great bari.

bo LIPSTICK-2 be sent off to soue snall tons as "resident

agent" for general nork and to get hin out of the arsa.
