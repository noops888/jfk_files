SUBJECT: Howard Hunt Examination

Attached is an index to the subjects covered in the

examination of Howard Hunt that Howard Liebengood and I con-

ducted last weekend.

On the basis of this examination, it appeared to both

Howard and me that there was no need to bring Hunt to Washington

for any further questioning.

Please let me have any thoughts

you may have on another examination of Hunt.

The present plan

is simply to arrange for him to swear to the transcript in

affidavit form.
