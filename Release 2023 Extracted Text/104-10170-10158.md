MEMORANDUM

SUBJECT

: Garrison Investigation of

Kennedy Assassination:

Donald P. (or T.) NORTON

1. On 6 August 1967 we were informed that the Vancouver

(Canada) Sun was running of soon would run an interview with one

Donald P. (or T.) NORTON, 35 years old, who had nade the

following claims.

a.

That he was a CLA man and that in 1958 he

delivered $150,000 to David FERRIE for transfer

to Cliba. (Comment: David W. FERUE, now dead,

was a pilot living in New Orleans. District Attorney

James C. Garrison has claimed that FERRIE was

one of a small group of conspirators who master-

minded the assassination of President Kennedy.

Allegations that CIA employed FERRIE have appeared

in print.

Thorough checks have shown that there

was no association between FERRIE and this Agency.)

b. That in 1962 Clay SHAW gave NORTON an

siltache case containing $50, 000 which NORTON de-

livered to one Harvey Lee in Monterrey, Mexico.

(Comment: There is no evidence that Lee Harvey

Oswald was in Mesco in 1962. There is no evidence,

except the unsupported word of a criminal and drug

addict, that Clay SHAW knew Oswald. SHAW is the

orily person indicted by Garrison to date on the charge

of conspiring to kill President Kennedy.)

SECRET

That NORTON received $500 a month pay

from CLA and that he also received bonuses of $5, 000

for the action described in sub-paragraph a, above, and

$2, 500 for that described in sub-paragraph b.

d.

That NORTON reported to an unidentified oil

company official in Calgary, Alberta, Canada.

That NORTON lost hia CLA job in November

1966 and was advised to settle down in Calgary.

2. Efforte are under way to obtain a copy of the edition of the

• Vancouver Sun containing the article herein described. However,

C/E/BC/C is also requested to ask the Ottawa Station to try to get a

copy for us, either independently or through liaison. 1o-k

3. All pertinent Agency recerds have been checked.

There Ig

no record of a Donald P. NORTON or Donald T. NORTON.

There is

also no record of a Donald NORTON who matches any of the foregoing

information.

1. The C/E/BC/C is also requested to obtain available informa-

tion from liaison regarding NORTON's general character and reputation

for veracity.

Because Diatrict Attorney Garrison has made unfounded

charges that CIA and the FBI are interfering in his Investigation in New

Orleans, Inquirtes to liaison should be low-key. It is requested that no

reference be made to Garrison or his investigation. It is suggested that

the only reason given for our interest be that NORTON has made false

allegations that CIA employed him.

5. It is requested that a check be run in the files of WH/COG to

see whether Subject appears therein.
