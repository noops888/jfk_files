1. INTRODUCTION

The 201 system provides a method for identifying a person of specific in-

terest to the Operations Directorate and for controlling and filing all pertinent

information about that person. The system also provides a means for identifying

subjects of 201 files from various categories of information about them and for

producing lisits of 201 personalities according to those categories. Only a rela-

tively small number of personalities indexed are of sufficient interest to justify

opening a 201 dossier. These are normally subjects of extensive reporting and

CI investigation, prospective agents and sources, members of groups and organi-

zations of continuing target interest, or subjects on whom a volume of corre-

spondence has accumulated.

2. THE 201 SYSTEM

The principal features of the 201 system are:

a. The 201 Number: a unique number, i.e., 201-1234567, assigned to each

individual in the system to serve as identifying file humber for reporting on that

individual.

b. The 201 Dossier: the official file containing the 201 opening forn (Form

831) and all biographic reporting on and references to the individual, i.e, per-

sonal history, current status, and prospects.

c. The Master 201 Record; a machine record generated by the opening of

a 201 file. This record produces the master 201 reference for the Main Index and

stores the pertinent information which may later be retrieved' for special listings

d. Main Index Master 201 Reference: this reference, printed in reply to an

Index Search Request, is printed as illustrated below. When data are absent

within the record, succeeding data items or lines will be moved up and the ref.

erence consolidated.

3. OPENING A 201 DOSSIER

a. General

• The opening of a 201. dossier is the prerogative of an operational com-

ponent, in coordination with the Information Services Group. An opening creates

a master 201 record. Changes to the master record and the occasional closing.

of a 201 dossier are controlled jointly by the desks and ISG. 201 dossiers may be ;.:

opened on persons who meet the carding criteria described in Chapter Il of this

handbook, when there is a reasonable expectation that additional information

will be acquired and filed in such a dossier. Generally dossiers are opened on

persons about whom counterintelligence information is being reported, and per-

sons of operational interest to the Operations Directorate, specifically those!

persons for whom provisional operational approvals and operational approvals

are requested (see exception belos). 201 files are not to be opened on staff!

employees, staff agents and most categories of contract employees: Files on!

persons who are only of local interest to a field station or Headguarters desk

and on whom no DDO records correspondence exists are not a part of the DDO

records systém and are to be maintained by that unit. Some desks levy require.

ments.on ISG for automatic 201 openings on certain categories of persons whose :

names appear in incoming dispatches. These are listed in Attachment 2. 201

dossiers should be opened in the following categories:

(1) Subjects of provisional operational approval and operational ap-

proval requests. However, a file need not be opened when a POA is requested

for persons being trained for a foreign liaison service and who are of opera-

tional interest for training purposes only.

(2) Persons for whom the field requests a 201 opening.

(3) MHFIXTURE personalities: bonafide diplomats of other than

denied area countries, in close association with staff personnel.

(4) Subjects of a Personal Record Questionnaire Part I.

(5) Persons on whom a Main Index search reveals information in five

or more documents (see DOI 70-20).

(6) Subjects of Interagency Source Register memoranda from LSN/

ISR (opened only by IP/RMS).

b. Requesting a 201 File Opening

Headquarters desks may open a 201 file by filling out and submitting

a 201 Personality File Action Request (Form 831) to the Records Main-

tenance Section (IP/RMS). Form 831 is also used to create or amend the

master

201 record and 201 machine listings and to register the assign-

ment of a cryptonym to a 201 personality, Attachment 3 consists of sample

201 Personality File Action Requests for opening and amending 201's. A field

station may request the opening of a 201 file by writing 201. in the Head

quarters file or cross-reference box on the dispatch form and/or after' the

subject's name in the body of the dispatch. A telepouch request for a 201 opening

is made by indicating 201- in the file number line. A cable request is made by

placing 201- after the term "File" on the last line of the transmission. -IP/AN

will open 201 files as requested by dispatch or telepouch but it is the responsi-

bility of the desk to respond to cable reguests. Field stations are nötified of

201 openings through receipt of the field master 201 record.

CHAPTER IT, ANNEX B

15 November 1974

All' standard listiags are cumulative; previous editions must be destroyed

upon receipt of current editions. These listings are by their very nature extremely

sensitive compilations of information and must be given every possible safeguard.

b. Non-Standard Listings

Based on one or more of the following selection criteria:

• л.

(1) Country of location

:.

(2) 01 codes (organization and/or intelligence affiliation)

(3) Citizenship

(4). Year of birth (plus or minus a given number of years).....

(5) Occupation.

These selection criteria may be used singly or in combinations. For example,

a user could obtain a list of all 201 personalities who have been assigned the

Ol code of XX or codes of XX, XY, or XZ. A 201 personality list could also be

produced of all persons who were born in Germany between the years 1915

and. 1920, with the occupation computer specialist, who are now citizens of the

United States, located in Mexico, and who had been assigned the OI code AA.

Note however that the listing would contain only those personalities with an

Ol code AA. Those personalities with an OI code other. than AA and those

with no Ol code would be excluded. The requester could however ask that

persons who have not been assigned an OI code also be included. Note also

that when retrieving lists based on occupation, the listing will be only as specific

as the occupation code (Attachment 1). The occupation code for a courier

covers only a documented courier. Some occupation codes cover more than one

occupation. For example, the occupation code CRAF covers those who practice

some trade or manual occupation, i.e., carpenters; bricklayers, painters, mechanics

and electricians. If a list is requested for electricians, all others in this category

will be included in the printout. These non-standard listings may be sorted.

(arranged) according to any, but not more than three, of the following keywords:

PERSONALITIES - 201 AND IDN NUMBERS

A relatively small proportion of the total number of

ties indexed by the cs are ot active operational interesy at any given

point in time. These are normally, subjects of extensive reporting and

Cl investigation, prospective agents and sources, and members of

groups and organizations of continuing target interest. Each of these

personalities is assigned either a 201 number or an IDN number.

2. The 201 number serves a dual purpose. It brings the files on

these personalities into the CS records system. A single number,

e•go, 201-123456, is assigned to each person, and a dossier controlled

by this number is established which contains, or has cross referenced

to it, all of the reporting on the individual's personal history, current

status.and prospects. Once the 201 number is assigned, it is used in

future reporting on the individual both as a file number and in, place of

other Identifying data. Up-to-date machine listings are published

periodically to help field stations and headquarters desks keep book

on those 201 personalities falling in their particular geographic or

• functional area of interest.
