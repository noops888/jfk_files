CIA JFK Collections

1) Oswald 201 file: 17 boxes (Aug 93/Jan 94 Release)

1) JER hard copy, 63 boxes (Aug 93/Feb 94 Release)

2) JFK microfilm, 72 reels (currently under review)

The Microfilm Reels contain the files that the HSCA staff

either requested or had access to.

A great deal of the

material is duplicative

of that found in the 63 hard copy

boxes including the complete Oswald 201 file. There are

also files not related to the assassination story and files

not reviewed by the HSCA.

HGR has reviewed all the microfilm material (page by page)

with the exception of the Oswald 201 file.

The Microfilm

collection has been divided into

to two parts:

1)

documents reviewed for release and being prepare

For NARA (records related to the assassination, the

investigations, or the various conspiracy theories),

documents reviewed but being held pending

discussion with the board (see attachment).

## Page 5

Microfilm Material Not Processed for Release (Pending

Discussion with the Board) :.

Oswald 201 File - this appears to be a duplicate of the hard

copy 201 file reviewed in 1993. 12+ Reels/approximately

30,600 pages

CIA Staff Employees' Personnel Files - Approximately 10,800

pages located on 7 different reels.

Request that these

not be considered part of the JFK collection as a matter of

privacy.

Only a small portions of these files have any

relevance to the JFK investigations and we believe that the

documents related to their roles in the JEK story were

released in the JEK hard copy collection.

We have reviewed

each of the OP files and prepared a classified summary for

the Board.

Non-Related Material - Most of these documents fall into

three major categories:

Individual 201 files : These files cover the entire

period of agency interest or contact with a person.

For

individuals who are not "key figures" in the JFK story,

those sections of the file that are outside relevant time

don not be the d

frames or can not be linked to Oswald, the assassination,

the various investigations, or any of the conspiracy

theories have been treated

as non-related.

Project/Operational Files: Many of these cover the

complete life of a project.

Sections of these file deals

with operations which have no connection with the

assassination or fall in only part of a relevant time frame.

For example there are

over 3000 pages on the Mexico City

Photo operation covering the 1960's and 1970's.

The only

related material is that falling in the time frame of

Oswald's visit to Mexico City and the investigation

following the assassination.

Cuban Exile Groups/Operations: The anti-Castro

activities of the Cuban exiles in the US during 1960 - 1963

are considered relevant to the assassination.

However, some

of the organizations

and individuals members continued to

run operations against Castro into the 1970's.

The exile

activities after the assassination are generally not

considered related unless they involve plots to assassinate

Castro, the continuation of pre-assassination projects or

the Garrison Investigation.

Notes:

I did not address the financial records of the CRC that we

are replacing with a summary (need to review again); we will

probably have to wait until we meet with the full board to

There are other categories/types of documents that are non-

related but do not fit in the above categories.

example, the HSCA reguested files on 29 on defectors; they

chose only 11 for their defector sample to be compared with

oswald.

We treated the 11 as related and the rest as non-

related.

However, the number of pages involved is small

compared to the above three categories.

Room 105, NARA

Official Attendees: Members of the Board, Steve Tilly, NARA.

Public:

25/30 in attendance including four from FBI (Terry

& Grant), Lesar, and Newman.

Also one network

(АВС?) кер.

Purpose:

Transact official business, briefing form Tilly on

recent releases; discuss future board activities

Selected items of HRG Interest:

I spoke with Jack after the meeting. Ex. Director MARWELL

will be on board & Augusts; they expect to be in new offices

by 15 August and have a core start in september.

Jack said

(after meeting) he would like to meet us last part of

August/early September.

Tilly said that the CIA would be releaseing 70,000 pages

20,000 pages of HSCA material in our files that we would be

reviewing this summer.

FBI received praise from the board; not much discussion of

DOD agencies are now the "bad boys". Hall ask several

pointed questions about the "small" DOD releases then Newman

blasted NSA and DIA during the question period.

Items/Issues addressed by the Board during the meeting:

Announced appointment of Executive Director David G. MARWELL

(see bio sheet). Will be on board & August.

Passed

resolution extending the Board to October 1995

MOA signed with the White House - funds through Sept. 1994

Discussed status of items before Congress (extending the

Board to October 1996 and funding).

Funds included in House

version of appropriation bill/deleted from Senate.

They

assume that the -funds will be restored in Conference;

nowever, could be reduced which would impact on number of

public meeting to held outside of Washington.

Expects to move into new office space by mid-August and have

a core staff in place in September. The bulk of the staff

would come on board in October.

Plans to begin public hearing on defining an assassination

record in Sept.

Anna Nelson commented on the importance of

identifying what is a record before beginning to address

specific issues/documents.

William Joyce reported that he had sent letters to 55

agencies asking about the quaintly of records still held by

the agency and had received 20 responses several which had

identified additional sources for documents (no specifics)

Steve Tilley gave a briefing on status of releases.

Releases since last meeting include tapes of telephone calls

trom the Johnson Library, the FBI files, Church Committee (7

boxes), and DOJ's FOIA litigation files. This month an

additional 10 boxes of Church Committee and some Pike

Committee Files

(only a small part deals with JFK).

Expects

a release from the CIA of approximately 70,000 pages later

this summer (mentioned the 73 Reels).

Tilley also described the 20,000 pages of HSCA material in

CIA files and that NARA would be acting as House agent on

these record.

Questions (to Tilly) by the Board:

Size of the NARA collection? - 1200 Cubic Feet

(2500 pages

per foot)

(Jack) what was the number of documents with redactions? --

Steve said he could not give a figure, would guess less than

50%

(Graff) any problems with agencies' willingness to release

documents -- None, considers the work be the various

agencies as a remarkable effort to turn over records.

The

problem was the volume of material and the time it takes to

review.

A question about Senate and House Committee reviews

procedures led to a discussion where it was clear that

neither the Board nor Tilly had a good fix on that part of

the review. The point was made that CIA information in

those documents (and in our HSCA material) would be reviewed

by CIA reviewers; the originator of the information was the

key reviewer).

(Jack) how were the agencies doing in defining

"assassination records? -- Tilly described some of his

discussions about assassination records within NARA and with

other agencies.

He mentioned that the "major agencies" had

records that they felt fell outside the scope which they

planned to discuss with the board.

---

## Page 13

4-00000

(Hall) how was the cooperation of the DOD intelligence

agencies including NSA / how much had they withheld ? --

Tilly said he found them cooperative but that the release

was small.

Did not know off hand how much was withheld.

Hall considered

so few record as "suspect" and ask if NARA

had followed up.

Tilly said no.

NARA did not have the

authority to question the agencies about their searches. He

indicated that the Army among others had not responded to

NARA's initial request.

(During the public comments part of

the meeting Newman and Lesar returned to the question of DOD

compliance.)

Several members of the Board had questions about the

Presidential Libraries; Tilly described his role and the

process.

When Jack open the meeting for public comments, Newman

returned to the question about DOD releases.

He clamied

that NSA had release only one true document and that most of

the DIA files was administrative or news clipping. He said

he had seen at least 30 DOD documents in CIA and FBI files

that did not appear in the DIA release.

Newman then ask if the agencies could withhold documents

from the Board; Jack responded that under the law thar only

Board had the power to withold a document.

Lesar ask if the Board had given consideration to. his letter

concerning the definition of an assassination record. Jack

thanked him for the letters but the Board would not be able

to address the issues Lesar raised until they had a staff to

do the research.

A third "expert" named Mark Zaid ask a question about Post

Office files that had been released before and how they

compared with recent Post Office files found by NARA. Anna

responded that such questions require a staff.

Subject to the list of

identities that will not be deleted, ClA will appropriately sanitize, including

excising il necessary, information to assure protection of information

identifying sensitive sources and methods.

When an excision is made,

CIA will indicate the nature of the source

or method excised, including the

functional intelligence discipline which was the source of the intelligence.

C. The Chief Counsel of the Select Committee on Assassinations

and a designated representative of the DCI shall meet monthly to discuss

The 63 boxes contain copies of material collected or

prepared in response to over a thousand individual requests

from HSCA. Boxes are grouped by responsible component. With

the exception of the security files, there is no general

subject grouping or order to the boxes. Individual boxes

usually contain a mix of topics and types of documents, and

there is much duplication through out the collection.

CIA, third agency (primarily FBI) and Warren Commission

documents plus a significant amount of HSCA originated

material*.

These records cover a wide range of topics

but focus on anti-Cuba/Castro activities and Oswald

in USSR, Mexico City and New Orleans. Also included are

responses to the large number of names traces

requested by the HSCA staff, numerous copies of

documents from the Oswald 201, the 1967 IG report,

testimony of Richard Helms before HSCA, Nosenko

material, CIA cable traffic.

Boxes 35-36 (Inspector General): HSCA reports, Senate

Select Committee reports, reports on Cuban

operations, Book V of Church Committee final report.

Release this fall of many records related to Cuba

I am pleased to say - and I offer this as my personal opinion -- that I have

seen no example where the Board has postponed any information that

bears directly on the assassination. I believe that the story is coming out

with the records that are being released.

Issue immediately before us is the ClA's sequestered collection.

Mr. Pereira has described it from the perspective of the agency.

The Review Board staff has been reviewing the record and has given the

Board its own assessment of the status of the records.

There are a great number of records in the sequestered collection that are highly

relevant:

Lee Harvey Oswald

Georges de Mohrenschildt

These types of records need to be reviewed on the same word-to-word basis as

the board has reviewed records thus far.

But we have a new problem: how should the Board review records from the

sequestered collections where the relevance to the assassination is not clear.

Examples where the staff has difficulty finding a nexus to the

assassination in certain records.

I will offer a few examples to provide you with a flavor of some of the issues we

are confronting. The examples below are hypothetical and are loosely based

upon our review of the files in order to illustrate the issues.

A. The "false hit" category

The HSCA requested files from ClA on a great number of persons. In many

instances the agency did not know why the files were requested, and accordingly

it made available files that it had on the name that had been requested.

Because names are not always unique, the agency sometimes made available

files on individuals who were of no interest to the HSCA and who had no

identifiable relation to the assassination.

1.

A very common name - I will use as an example the name Robert Smith.

The HSCA requested Robert Smith files because of an alleged

connection between a "Robert Smith" and Lee Harvey Oswald in 1963.

The Smith whose file was made available, however, was a CIA officer who

died in 1956. The ARRB staff has reviewed the file and has discovered

no relevance to the assassination.

B. CIA operational files or 201 files.

3.

Cuban now living in the Unitet States. CIA unsuccessfully attempted to

recruit her to collect information on Cuba through her family and friends,

but ultimately abandoned the effort. Neither she nor any of her hoped for

contacts had any identifiable connection to the Oswald story or to the JFK

assassination.

Cuban cultivated for operational work against Castro in whom CIA lost

- interest when he was not able to meet operation standards.

4. • Soviet official at the Mexico City embassy during Oswald's visit, although

he never had any personal contact with him. The Mexico City portion of

his file ha been reviewed and released in part to NARA. The remainder of

---

## Page 39

14-00000

- 3 -

his file covers his subsequent career in a European country, where CIA

monitored him closely. This portion of his career - by far the largest part

of his file - has no bearing on Oswald or the JFK assassination.

C. CIA officials

There are many personnel files of CIA officers. The files often contain medical

records evaluations, recommendations, and postings. They generally do not

contain any operational details.

5.

CIA employee who was a Headquarters secretary for a major figure in the

case. Her file consists of personnel records, medical records, and a

polygraph, none of which has any identifiable bearing on the Oswald story

of the JFK assassination.

As anyone knowledgeable about the Kennedy assassination can testify, there is

a bewildering number of allegations regarding CIA officials who have alleged

connections to the assassination. The HSCA investigated some of these leads.

Not all leads are successful.

6.

A CIA officer was allegedly in Dallas on November 22. An examination of

the file suggests that the individual was not in Dallas, but was in Vietnam.

There is nothing in the file that contains any apparent connection to the

assassination.

7.

CIA official in Mexico City who was directly involved in matters related to

Oswald's visit. Prior to and subsequent to the Mexico City tour, the officer

was stationed at headquarters and at other locations in the world. With

the exception of the portion related to Mexico City, the staff can identify no

other documents that illuminate the assassination.

D. Summary of problems

First, establishing criteria for relevance

Second, handling different types of records

ex. 1: entire file has no identifiable relevance

ex. 2: some documents in a file have relevance, but others do not

ex. 3: portion of a document has identifiable relevance, but others do not

Selected Statutory Provisions in The President John F. Kennedy

Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992, 44 U.S.C. § 2107 (Supp. V

1994)

Definition of Assassination Record

''Assassination record' means a record that is related to the assassination

of President John F. Kennedy, that was created or made available for use

by, obtained by, or otherwise came into the possession of [the HSCA]."

Sect. 3(2).

Interpretation 1: All records in segregated collection are assassination records.

Argument: the segregated collection are "assassination records" because

a goverment agency examined them in the course of their investigation

of the assassination.

Interpretation 2: Only segregated collection records that actually relate to the

assassination of President Kennedy come within the scope of the JFK Act.

Argument: In order for a record to be an "assassination record" it must:

(a) relate to the assassination of President Kennedy, and (b) have been

used by, obtained by, or otherwise came into the possession of a

government agency.

Selected CFR Provisions:

"All records collected by or segregated by all Federal, state, and local

govemment agencies in conjunction with any investigation or analysis of

or inquiry into the assassination of President Kennedy...." 36 CFR

1400.1(b)(2)

"An assassination record shall be released in its entirety except for

portions specifically postponed pursuant to the grounds for postponement

of public disclosure of records established in ... the JFK Act, and no

portion of any assassination record shall be withheld from public

disclosure solely on grounds of non-relevance unless, in the Review

Board's sole discretion, release of part of a record is sufficient to comply

with the intent and purposes of the JFK Act." 36 CFR 1400.5. -

Staff Preliminary Suggestions to Board

A. Factors suggesting possible relevance to assassination:

Unfortunately, there is no simple, clear, obvious method for determining

relevance. Accordingly, rule of thumb guidelines need to be followed.

The obvious rules of thumb to assist staff in identifying relevant

documents would include:

- documents that obviously are related to assassination

CIA internal investigations

Oswald records

Garrison investigation

Castro assassination attempts

- documents falling within certain dates (relevance of dates depends on

issue under consideration

dates associated with Oswald

dates immediately around assassination

dates of Warren Commission

dates of Church Committee, HSCA investigations

- individuals of importance

CIA officials in Mexico City

David Atlee Phillips

Win Scott

CIA officials in HQ involved in investigation

John Scelso

JJ Angleton

- geographical relevance (USSR; Cuba; Mexico)

B. Handling of records in sequestered collection

First, ARRB staff reviews all records and files in sequestered collection.

Second, all documents that are found to be relevant will be subjected to

word by word review of postponements by the Board. The staff will, over

time, work with the Board to establish guiding criteria for identifying

relevance. The focus will be on individuals and groups that have been

identified as playing a role in the larger story of the assassination.

Examples of individuals who have been identified as being a part of the

greater story surrounding the assassination include David Atlee Phillips,

Win Scott, James Angleton, etc. Groups include Cuban exile groups

.--

## Page 42

14-00000

- 6 -

(DRE, Alpha 66, etc.), Minutemen, etc.

Third, for a file where no relevance can be found, the staff will write a

memorandum identitying the file, describing the review process, and

explaining the basis of finding no relevance. The staff memorandum will

then be sent to the JFK Collection and be made fully available to the

public.

Fourth, for a file containing some relevant records, the relevant records

will be subjected to the word by word review. Records for which the staff

has been able to identify no relevance, a memorandum will be written to

describe generally the type of records and explain the basis for finding no

relevance.

Fifth, with regard to the microfilm copy of the Oswald 201 file, the staff will

review the entire file in order to determine whether there are any records

in the file that are not included in the released version of the 201 file. If

such records are identified, they will be subjected to the same word by

word review as other records -- but the remainder of the 201 file will not

be reviewed again.

Sixth, in rare cases, portions of a document that genuinely have no

identifiable relevance to the assassination, may be redacted consistent

with the 1400.5.

I recommend that the Board, in the near future, deliberate on the guidance that it

wishes to give to the staff regarding these matters.

TESTIMONY BEFORE JEK BOARD, 6 AUGUST 1996 ~

INTRODUCTION

Introduce CIA participants

We are pleased to provide information to the Assassination

Records Review Board that might assist the Board in fulfilling

its responsibilities under the President John F. Kennedy

Assassination Records Collection Act. CIA is committed to full

Before addressing the subject of the sequestered collection

directly, I would like to provide some background to help put

the sequestered collection into some sort of context.

In the spring of 1992, prior to the enactment of the JFK

Assassination Records Act,

then Director of Central

Intelligence,

Bob Gates issued instructions to begin reviewing

for declassification all records related to the assassination.

Bob cakes records

The CIA History Staff was charged with identifying the

relevant records.

Once this was done, the Historical Review

Group took custody of these records and immediately began

reviewing them for declassification for release to the National

Archives.

Once the Kennedy Assassination Records Act was passed, our

goal became to release as many of the records as possible by the

22 August 1993 deadline established by the Act. Approximately

125,000 pages were transferred to the National

date.

discussion with the Review Board.

THE ASSASSINATION RECORDS

In identifying relevant records, we have followed the

definitions in the 1992 Act and the related rules which were

published in the Federal Register.

The Kennedy assassination records in CIA consist of two

major groups of files.

One group consists of the documents in

the Lee Harvey Oswald file--sometimes referred to as the

• "Oswald

201 file". These consist mainly of documents collected after the

assassination and during the Warren Commission investigation.

There are about 26,000 pages of material in the Oswald

file.

All but a handful have been declassified and sent to the

National Archives.

The second group is comprised of the "sequestered

collection".

These are the records that were made available to

the House Select Committee on Assassinations, and which the

Committee asked CIA to hold in safekeeping upon the completion

of the Committee's investigation.

Certain additional records, including 400 excerpts fron

minutes of the Director's morning meetings, and some working

files, have been added to the overall collection since 1992.

## Page 45

14-00000

SEQUESTERED COLLECTION

First of all, every document in the sequestered

collection is available to the Board for review.

The

documents are available in full, without redactions.

The record shows that the sequestered collection

consists

of documents compiled in connection with the

investigation of the House Select Committee on

Assassinations (HSCA) •

A portion of the documents were created specifically in

response to requests from the HSCA. Other records were

already in existence prior to the creation of the Committee.

Still other documents were created by the Committee itself.

For example, notes of interviews conducted by the

Committee's

staff.

Within the sequestered collection there are two major

categories of records. One category consists of

approximately 129,000

pages of hard copy.

The second

category consists

of 72 reels of microfilm, or the

equivalent of 163,000 pages of hard copy.

The reason

why the documents were sequestered is

explained in a Memorandum of Understanding signed by the

Chairman Louis

Stokes of the HSCA and DCI Stansfield Turner

in August 1977. The Memorandum provides as follows:

"Upon termination of the Committee, all materials

provided by CIA

and examined by the Committee will be kept

and preserved within a segregated and secure area within CIA

for at least 30 years unless the DCI and the House of

Répresentatives agree to a shorter period of time."

In April 1979, Robert Blakey, Chief Counsel and Staff

Director of the HSCA visited CIA Headquarters to complete

the process of designating what materials were to be

sequestered.

All the documents made available to the

Committee were included in the sequestered collection.

REVIEW AND DECLASSIFICATION OF THE SEQUESTERED FILES

In 1992, CIA wrote to Speaker of the House Thomas Foley

ridiuesting approval to begin declassifying and releasing the

records.

_In October of that year, Mr. Foley wrote a letter

to the DCI granting CIA the authority to do so. The

Speaker's decision was made in anticipation of passage of

the Assassination Records Collection Act.

THE HARDCOPY MATERIAL

The hardcopy part of the sequestered collection

includes

• copies of most of the CIA documents in the Oswald

201 file.

Also included are 201 files, personnel files, and

security

files on persons who are mentioned in documents

relevant to the assassination, or who figure in one of the

conspiracy theories.

The collection also includes about 30,000 pages of

documents, memos, and notes (many handwritten) that were

created by the Committee staff during their investigation.

THE MICROFILM PORTION OF THE SEQUESTERED COLLECTION

As I noted earlier, there are approximately 72 reels of

microfilm in the sequestered collection.

have arranged to have all of the microfilm records printed

in hard copy.)

The decision to microfilm a portion of the sequestered

collection was apparently based on two major considerations:

First, the integrity of the sequestered records

had to be maintained.

HSCA

Second, a number of the files requested by the

were active

and had to be available to allow people to

continue conducting their normal activities.

The solution was to replace certain records with

microfilm versions.

These records were microfilmed during

1979-80 with the approval of the Assassinations Committee.

THE CONTENT OF THE MICROFILM

A sizeable portion of the microfilm--approximately 50

percent--duplicates the hard copy files. For example,- there

are 12 reels of material from the Oswald 201 file.

The bulk of the reels consists of files on

individuals and organizations, including personnel files of

CIA employees.

There are also a number of files on anti-

Castro organizations.

All but a small percentage of the

materials are CIA-originated cables, dispatches, memoranda,

reports, and correspondence.

There are questions of privacy that we believe the

Board

may want to consider in determining what information

is to

be released to the public. Some of the records

contain, for example, medical information on an individual.

There are also questions of relevancy that we suggest

the Board consider.

For example, many of the documents

cover sensitive activities that go far beyond the timeframe

of the

assassination or investigations into the

assassination.

MEMORANDUM FOR:

(Teresa Wilcox @ DST

Kathryn Dyer

FROM:

SUBJECT:

REFERENCE:

J. Barry Harrelson

CSI/HRG, JFK Project Officer

Records Briefing for ARRB Staff

ARRB letter to DCI, did. 27 November, 1997, RE CIA Compliance

with the JFK Assassination Records Collection Act.

1. The JFK Board (ARRB) staff has requested briefings by records "specialists" on the

Agency's records systems as part of the compliance with the JFK Act process (see reference). The

first DO briefing took place on 12 February. The DA briefing and a follow-up DO briefing is planned for

early March. I would like to set up the remaining briefings as soon as possible.

2. The ARRB staffers are very familiar with agency documents and have had several general

briefings on Agency records; one member of the staff is a former Agency employee (CTC). These

"compliance" briefings should focus on what files would have existed in the 1958-63 time period and

how we search, or account for, those records today. The ARRB requests you have been working on

give you some sense of the type of information they are interested in. In addition I am faxing a copy of

the "talking points" prepared for the DO briefing. I have also ask Jeremy Gunn, ARRB General Counsel,

to provide a list of directorate specific topics.

'3. The briefing can take place at HQ or at IP. The ARRB attendees will include Mr. Gunn and 4

or 5 members of the Board's CIA team; all are fully cleared (SCI). I have asked Mr. Gunn to provide a

list of dates when he and his staff would be available,* I will forward the list to you as soon as I receive

it. Thank you for your assistance in setting up these briefings. If you have any questions, please give

me a call on extension 31825.

a Process

• Directorate Search & Review Is Cumbersome

• Coordination Is Resource Intensive & Inefficient

• IRO Task Not Perceived As Important

• --Limits Experience & Sophistication We Can

Bring to the Task

• The IRO Has Little Clout or Resources

@ Policies

• Saying "No" Is Easier Than Justifying Damage

• Past Practices Are Not Examined Until Forced

s/addais/ed/brieing/982Gina8.ppt

Process: First, process - the components own the information and the IRO is the gate-

keeper who controls what will be done, what will be searched, and what will be released.

This makes coordination complex, but the larger issue is that the IRO usually does not

have either the clout or the resources to do the job and we find cases bottle-necked.

Policies: What also makes coordination difficult, is an institutional bias to withhold

until forced to release. Thus, we adopt silly positions. When pressed, we often concede

in the end, but we lose credibility in the process.

There is no stomach, and perhaps no time to:

# Question the questionable,

# Revalidate the counter intuitive,

• or even overturn the nonsensical.

Sixth, Capture of Previously Released Information: We are trying to complete the job of

populating a data base of previously declassified and released information.

It is not acceptable that those outside the Agency know better than we do, what we have released.

Our MORI database, once fully populated will allow us to:

Satisfy many requesters from information we already have declassified.

Speed up our declassification by knowing what decisions have already been made.

Increase the consistency of our decisions.

And most importantly, avoid wasting resources and embarrassing ourselves fighting to protect •

what already has been released.

And seventh, Classification Policy: The world is changing.

The overall budget figure was never released, but now it is.

It was forbidden to mention the existence of the NRO; that has changed.

All NRO contractors were under cover; now a two page listing of those contractors has been

published in the media.

We tightly protected all overhead imagery program, but we now are declassifying product

from early systems.

On the other hand, we still have policies that are outdated and may no longer make sense - [Farm, -

A small effort can inject fresh thinking, and can staff issues for periodic and systematic validation by

senior management.

This can pay dividends by keeping us from wasting time and resources protecting and defending what

senior managers believe can and should be released.

The re-review is virtually complete-- the remaining material

(approximate two boxes) is mostly security files)

[Note: In the review controversial, complicated or Denied

in Full documents were white-banded

for later processing; I

currently have a team of 3 reviewers going through the

collection handling these problem documents. A number of

these could lead to potential appeal issues.

It will take

2-3 weeks to complete the white band review.]

Notes from Briefing of ARRB Staff on Stations?

(11 October 1995

- ARRB conf. room)

CIA Attendees: Bill Me E

John Goins /

Chuck Briggs

Hal Bean

Barry Harrelson

Bill re Stations:

No problem with release of CAS (Controlled American Source),

fact we have overseas

locations, CIA representatives in

specific countries -- the problem comes with officially

acknowledging the stations thereby putting the host

government and service in a position of explaining why it is

allowing a foreign espionage unit to operate in the country.

This may become a serious political issue for the

government, especially in countries where the government

does not acknowledge its own

service. Also can be perceived

as

"rubbing their nose in it" and can affect the trust

between the Agency and the host service (violated agreement

of confidentially).

Marwell pointed out that this information was 30 years old

and asked what was the impact of acknowledging a station

presence in 1963 on current operations or relations.

Bill responded "opened up old sores" and cited

and the

sensitivity to our involvement in past election. Mentioned

the reaction to the announcement on covert actions by DCI.

Gunn asked if stations = liaison relationship; Bill said the

other service can not say it did not know the CIA was

operating in its own country -- would look incompetent.

Mary asked about changes in government; Bill responded that

intell types tend to stay own or its revolving door where

the group that leaves when a neww government comes into

power will be back in power at some point.

Bill comments on specific stations

If important to the story such as Mexico City and the

surrounding stations which were involved in the cable

exchanges re Oswald, then will release.

"Don't take it away from us for little of no gain to the

story"

', I. e. if not critical to the story let us protect.

He indicated he could live with opening the stations for

short windows if important to story, but also said it

created a problem about protecting other activities in that

window

Moscow - opened for Oswald windows

- No, past elections issue and current narcotics

projects

- No, counter narcotics projects

- Liaison relationships have been up and down; (PNGed

five officers) can't afford any more flaps

- long time relationship w/ head of state; could give

anti-government labor unions an issue (however, would

not "fall on my sword" for this one

Northern Europe -- Bill responded with Western Europe/ saic

southern Europe

"ok"

London: do not want to acknowledge but could live with

Australia - very sensitive

Berlin - is open in 1955; 1963 (?) Bill may have been having

second thoughts about previous

think it still stands -- there

was

a discussion of why

Berlin important to story.

Mary asked about other European stations,

and some

South American stations

Bill did not have specific on other stations but made a

couple of comments

Bonn and Hague - no problem

Brussels - very sensitive to any mention of intelligence

service presence

Would get back to them on other stations

Other issues discussed

Crypts other than LIs and AMs - there was a discussion re

deleting digraph and letting rest of crypt; everyone seemed

receptive, but no decision.

Bill mentioned Iranian takeover as good example of damage

caused by release of documents with crypts, file #s, etc.

Gunn ask if there was an internal "damage"

study prepared.

Bill said he would check.

Marwell rejected the approach of the Agency having the

opportunity to discuss Board actions before official

notification.

If we have evidence, need to present upfront.

not come back with additional evidence after the decision.

The balancing of public interest vs Agency needs came up

several times; Marwell commented that even if a document or

item is not important to the Oswald story, the Agency must

still defend.

Bill stated several timed during the meeting "If important

to the story, we can live with release".
