World Reaction to Change of US

Administration

World reaction to the as-

sassination of President Ken-

nedy and its aftermath is in-

creasingly preoccupied with

speculation over the possible

effects on US foreign and do-

mestic policies.

Oswald's Communist back-

ground, however, and his dra-

matic murder while in police

custody are being exploited for

almost every conceivable propa-

ganda line.

The USSR continues

to reflect

sensitivity over Os-

wald's political motivations;

Khrushchev, talking with Am-

bassador Kohler on 23 November,

recalled that Lenin had con-

demned "nihilist" activities

and asserted the Soviet Communist

Party is

traditionally opposed

to terrorism.

Pravda, citing a denial by

the

US Communist Party that Os-

wald had ever been a member,

suggested he was linked to

"American Trotskyites," but con-

cluded that the Kennedy assas-

sination was the work of "fasc-

ist forces" trying to destroy

the

detente atmosphere.

Papers in West Germany,

Belgium, and Lebanon, among

others,

theorize Oswald was

killed

him.

by associates to silence

A Cairo newspaper calls

killer "one Jack Rubenstein,

a Jew of course." The US Em-

bassy in Beirut has received

many telegrams speculating that

Oswald's killing is evidence of

a Communist plot against the US.

The embassy notes with dismay

the probable foreign impact of

dramatic news photos showing the

escorting officer apparently

looking away while Oswald is

shot.

An Afrikaans paper in

Johannesburg editorialized that

while Us racial difficulties

might not be "directly concerned

with the assassination," they

had become a vehicle for the

undermining of the state by the

Communists and Afro-Asians.

A Cairo editorial expresses

concern that President Johnson,

while committed to the policies

of his predecessor, may have to

compromise and postpone decisions

in order to avoid antagonisms

as the US enters an election

year. Syrian Vice President

Bitar commented to Ambassador

Knight on 25 November that the

Arab cause might suffer from

the loss of President Kennedy,

"who had shown signs of increas-

ingly better understanding of

the Arabs and their problems."

West German and French

press commentaries range from

expectations of initial uncer-

tainty or temporizing in US for-

eign policy to the gloomy

view

of Der Spiegel that it is "doomed

to immobility" for the next

year.

Some segments of the

British press had suggested

SECRET

that an opportunity existed for

development of a strong British

leadership in the Western alli-

ance, but London officials,

noting

that the UK also faces

1964 elections, are not in-

clined to expect any radical

departures.

Genevieve Tabouis, writ-

ing in Paris Jour, expects no

major decisions from the pres-

ent meeting between President

Johnson and General de Gaulle,

but notes that De Gaulle will

probably urge that France-Ameri-

can problems be settled in the

course of 1964, while Johnson

will urge

a "Western summit con-

ference."

The Peruvian Chamber of

Deputies on 24 November unani-

mously adopted a motion urging

the award of the Nobel Peace

Prize to President Kennedy.

Hanoi Apparently Renewing Cam-

paign for "Neutralization" of

South Vietnam

Hanoi appears to be re-

newing its campaign to generate

international support for the

"neutralization" of South Viet-

nam.

NBR

In pressing its neutraliza-

tion proposal, lanoi probably

hopes to take advantage of Cam-

bodian Premier Sihanouk's re-

cent reiteration of his scheme

for an international guarantee

of neutrality for Cambodia,

Laos, and South Vietnam.

The

North Vietnamese reportedly

have urged Premier Souvanna

Phouma of laos to press for

adoption of their neutrality

proposition.

For the first time in nearly

a year, moreover, the Hanoi-con-

don: Cat Pairs 2506, 22 NantS (Rist)

trolled National Front for the

Liberation of South Vietnam has

publicly restated its support

of the three-country neutrality

plan. North Vietnam is also

drawing support from Moscow and

Peiping, whose propaganda has

recently become less reticent

on the subject of South Viet-

namese neutrality.

North Vietnam's premier re-

portedly told a French official

recently that his country sees

indications of growing weariness

and dissatisfaction in the US

with the war in South Vietnam.

He implied that Hanoi intended

to keep up military and political

pressure in the South in order

to help Induce American with-

drawal. (SECRET NO FOREIGN DIS-

French Aid to Cambodia

NBR

France is considering ex-

tending additional economic and

military aid to Cambodia.

Despite the general irri-

tation in French Government

circles over Sihanouk's recent

actions, the prince's

direct

appeal for French aid

has posed

a dilemma for Paris.

A flat

rejection could adversely affect

France's position in Africa and

the Middle East, as well as in

Southeast Asia.. On the other

hand, Paris is probably reluc-

tant

to take over the recently

canceled US financial commitments

in Cambodia.

reviewing what seems to be a

renewal of a long-standing

Cambodian request for more mili-

They are also thinking

of offering Phnom Penh $5 million

plus either larger loans or

greater export credits.

Perhaps related to their

plans to assist Cambodia is the

strong possibility that French

Defense Minister Messmer will

be sent to Cambodia in January.

Since 1956, French grant

aid has amounted to $15 million.

Negotiations for an additional

$2 million have been deadlocked

for the past 18 months by dis-

EASTERN EUROPE

Rumania's Industrial Development

Rumanian party first secre-

tary Gheorghiu-Dej has just com-

pleted another tour of industrial

construction sites throughout

Rumania--his sixth such trip in

the last two months. The exten-

sive Rumanian press coverage of

the trip is designed to show

both Rumania's rapid economic

growth and its broadening trade

contacts with the West.

The Rumanian public has

been officially informed för

the first time of the extent

of West European participation

in the construction of indus-

trial installations in Rumania.

It is also the first time that

detailed information has been

given to the public regarding

industrial installations.

Press

coverage divulges statistics on

production capacities. of the

various installations as well

as on the items they produce.

Information on the planning

and construction of the facto.-.

ries also is unusually detailed.

On 13 November the party

visited slatina, the site of

an aluminum plant whose con-

struction is just beginning.

According to the Rumanian press,

the plant ultimately will have

an annual production capacity

of 50,000 tons of aluminum and

alloys and will be completed in

the next 18 months with help of

a French firm. Other sources

NBR

indicate, however, that the

French firm is assisting in con-

struction of the first stage of

the plant, which will have a

30,000-ton capacity. ' Equipment

is being provided by several

West European countries, the

press reported.

The Craiova chemical com-

bine will include 14 factories

having a capacity of about 300,-

000 tons of ammonium nitrate

fertilizer and 100,000 tons of

urea, according to

the press

which also reported that the

ammonia, nitric acid, and ammo-

nium nitrate factories--planned

and equipped by the USsh-- are

over two thirds completed.

Belgium, Holland, and West

Ger-

many are supplying equipment

for portions of the combine.

From various sources it is

known that during 1960-61 West-

ern firms added several catalytic

refining installations to the

Brazi oil refinery, built in

1934. The Rumanian press now

reports that the rumanians re-

cently completed construction

of a crude: 011 distillation

unit with a three-million-ton

capacity.

This unit will

boost

the plant's capacity from 1.5

million tons to 4.5 million tons

per year.

Brazi is one of the

three major refineries in which

Rumania plans to concentrate

its refining capacity.

The press

also indicated that additional

facilities to be built at Brazi

will include a number of petro-

chemical installations:

ethylene-propylene plant prob-

ably purchased from Italy, a

polyethylene plastics plant from

the UK, and, an ethylene oxide

and ethylene glycol unit from

Italy.

Brazi, along with another

combine at Borzesti, will be the

main centers for chemical pro-

duction based on petroleum.

Dej also visited numerous

other industrial installations

which have received both Western

stal cataces 77-591

and Soviet equipment and assist-

ance.

In reporting the progress

of construction at these plants,

however, the Rumanians gave more

attention to the Western assist-

ance than to the Soviet contribu-

tions.

The belated open recognition

of

the Western role in Rumania's eco-

nomic development undoubtedly re-

flects Rumania's desire to expand

further its trade ties with the

West.

Rumanian officials have con-

stantly reiterated Bucharest's

interest in purchasing modern tech-

nical machinery and equipment. (SE-

Communist China - Australia:

Communist China has contracted

for 1.1 million tons of grain

from Australia worth about $66

million--China's first major

grain purchase for 1964 delivery

The Australian announcement

stated that terms of the sale

were similar to previous Sino-

Australian grain deals.

China's

1963 grain crop will at

most be

no better than last year's medi-

ocre crop and thus China would

have to import more than the

bought last year from the West,
