ADMINISTRATIVE

One copy of this j report is designated for Phila-

delphia for information inasmuch as there are outstanding

leads in this division.

During interview of Mr. KEITH WADE, subject ap-

peared and said he understood the FBI was investigating him:

He voluntarily furnished information set forth in instant

report.

Subject advised that KATHLEEN ANN BERNS was

the

victim of a vicious rape attack on August 25, 1961, at

which time she was taken to a hospital, is in poor physical

condition, and is extremely nervous from this experience/

and the following police interrogation.

In view of her physical condition, and the fact

that she is living with the subject, she was not interviewed.

The interview of subject on July 24, 1961, was

handled under the caption "GEORGE DAMAN, IMPERSONATION"

which was subsequently closed administratively. At that time

a search of the indices failed to reveal the existence of

the Neutrality Matter, Impersonation case under his correct

name•
