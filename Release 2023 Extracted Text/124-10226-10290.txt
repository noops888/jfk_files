On 6/19/59, MM 635-S advised that he and Douglas Leftbright
(ph), a Canadian serving in the Cuban Air Force, had been sent to Miami
several days previously by the Cuban Air Force to Sabotage a P-51

they had spent a lot of money but accomplished nothing; and that they
probably would attempt to take credit for the deal which had been
executed by Leftbright and his companion.

Alexander I. Rorke, Jr., 51 Chambers Street, NYC, who had
been associated with various anti-Fidel Castro activities, on 4/21/62
advised that he had learned from Frank Fiorini that on either 4/17/62
or 4/18/62, he and Pedro Luis Diaz Lanz and others associated with
Diaz were stopped about 40 miles southeast of Miami, Florida and turned
back to Miami by the US Coast Guard. According to Fiorini, the Coast
Guard action in stopping two of the boats belonging to Diaz was prompted
by orders from Washington, DC. Rorke advised on 4/25/62 that he again
spoke with Fiorini who was very much disgusted because they had been
stopped by the Coast Guard and said he believed Diaz set up this
activity in order to discontinue all activity against the present
Cuban Government. Fiorini said there were both men and plenty of weapons
aboard the boats but that the men were not detained nor were the
boats or weapons confiscated by the US Government.
This reference identified Diaz Lanz as former head of the
Cuban Revolutionary Air Force.

the "Violyn III" included Zacarias Costa Garcia, head of a group called

Army; Jerry Buchanan, an American adventurer; and Jose Maria Gonzalez
Hernandez, a Cuban radio operator. Fiorini allegedly maintained

of its whereabouts. On 3/29-31/63, Fiorini, Johnson and Gonzalez
reportedly traveled to Nassau and Norman Key, Bahamas, in connection
with a plan of Evelio Duque to take radio equipment into Cuba; however,
they were intercepted by British authorities and returned to Miami
before the plan materialized. As of 4/13/63, Hernandez reportedly
claimed he was working with Sturgis and Johnson. It had been reported
also, that Fiorini admitted having a clandestine radio station in
operation, however, he did not disclose further details concerning it.

raid indicated that Rorke was closely associated with Frank Fiorini
and had distributed a leaflet which referred to participation in
expeditions against Castro in the Spring of 1961 which were commanded
by Fiorini, the Commanding Officer and organizer of the Anti-Communist
International Brigade. It was reported that during April, 1963 Fiorini
had claimed that plans were in progress for a new 'strike"; also,
that Fiorini had been in contact with Edgardo Sopo Barreto of the MRR
who, on 5/1/63, alleged that Fiorini made frequent visits to Manuel
Artime Buesa's organization* where he made irresponsible claims that
were not true. During an interview in Miami on 4/27/63, Fiorini
advised that he first met Rorke in 1960 in Miami, at the home of a
leading anti-Castro Cuban, Pedro Diaz Lanz. He stated that about one
month previously in Miami, he met with Rorke, Hansruedi Tanner and
Geoffrey Sullivan who wanted Fiorini's help in proposed aerial action
over Cuba; however, Fiorini declined to assist them. He denied
knowledge of the 4/25/63 mission beforehand and expressed doubt that
it actually took place:

With reference to foregoing, Frank Anthony Sturgis, better

interviewed on 4/24/63. He denied any connection with Alpha 66, even
though in the past he had admitted cooperation with Cuban anti-Castro
groups. Fiorini said that several weeks previously, date unknown,
a Mr. William DePugh in Missouri called him and inquired about Jerry
Brooks (100-434935). Fiorini called an address where Brooks supposedly
resided but obtained no information. He notified DePugh of that fact
and had heard nothing since then. He was unable to furnish information
concerning anyone else on foregoing list.
Fiorini, who had always expressed cooperation with the FBI
in Miami in the past, again contacted DePugh in Missouri by phone on

on Brooks obtained from DePugh at that time. It was Fiorini's observa-
tion that DePugh would not cooperate with the Bureau in view of his
connections in the "Minutemen". Fiorini also pointed out that Brooks
supposedly was in Miami for two or three days (date not given), reason
unknown to Fiorini.

time photographs were taken of various air strips in the Bahama Islands

Miami teletype dated 12/24/64, captioned "Alleged Plan By
Cuban Exile Organization REAL to Blow Up British Ship at Nassau,
Bahamas Between Christmas and New Year's Day, 1965" (105-137014)
indicated that attempts by Miami to verify this allegation had met with
negative results. Relative to information from Secret Service, Austin,
Texas, that Lynn Pelham, "Life Magazine" photographer, had been visited
by one "Frank" who said he was from Miami, Florida, and who made.
captioned allegation, Miami considered the possibility that "Frank"
might be identical to Frank Fiorini, aka Frank Sturgis, an American
adventurer who had been involved in Cuban revolutionary activities for
about six years and who had the reputation among several local federal
agencies of peddling information which frequently was found to be
unfounded and untrue.
A telephone call placed to Fiorini's house (no address given)
on the night of 12/24/64, produced no answer. No further attempts to
contact him would be made, pending results of interview of Pelham.

matters discussed by anti-Castro exiles.
