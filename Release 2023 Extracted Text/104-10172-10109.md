SUBJECT: GENERA - Operations

SPEcIe- Maurice lyman Halperin

15 Decerber 1957

1. since the last week in August 1957 this station has been tryini to Induce

• the Mexican Government to deport subject (an imerican Communist sino, for a time afte

his departure had power of attorney for Alirod K. Stern) Iron l'exico. Mis effort

has been mounted through LIKIYAK-2.

2:

In mid Septenber LIKAYAK-2 reported that he had succeeded in getting this

matter to the attention of the "resident of Mexico through one or the

personal advisors named Jose Lorenzo CussIu.

Through this channel the Preslöent

Stern.

In the three months following these developments, repeated requests for

news on the matter were made to LIkirik-?, who stüted each

tine that he had done all

he could when he brought the matter to the fresident's attention and that he could

not force the point further.

He dia, however,

mention it fran tire to tire to octh.

Fernando ReMiN Lugo, Undersecretary of Interior, and to COSSIO.

La Although LIKiXAK-2 was not able to report any concrete developrents in the

three montks period, LIFTiT coverage on Falgerin and LCMAY.O.L target's residence

shoved that this staticn's nessage had gotten consideration fron nighly placed

persons in the Mexican Government.

a. At the end of lu ust and beginning of September, Halzerin was

freely expressing confiience that his Mexican Immigrant papers would be

processed through in quick time and he anticirated no trouble because of

his association witr. Stern.

Towaris the end of Septemoer, lowever, and

thereafter, Halgerin's contiuence declined as his papers were continually

held uc.

person haring excellent

contacts in the Government, seemed unable to conclude the case.

On.23 September Ruth WIsdiFTs and Ralph Seott, employees of

Stern, on the LastreL coverage stated that Halperin was worried to

death about bis situation in Mexico because he hail learned the President

was "after" him.

LaPOrl coverage also reflected, towards the end of Sectaber.

On 2 Decerber 1957 LIKiTiF-a passed to the case officers list o? ten or so

nases of Américans ¿- lerico, with tie request that. the station swish information

as to whether they bure cormunists. it that time the case officer cold iIXAYAX-2

that since the lalgerin matter had hung fire for so long he thought is rossible

tie ü. S. Government sould prefer not to pass on suct information.

IKAinK-2 seemed

quite confident trat Falperin would de oventually deported but stated he would

sgain look into the raiter.

6. On 13 Decezter WIKIYAK-2 repitad that ralperin would be "iavited" to leave

the country.

He stilei se had heart this from Jose I. SANTILlAli, Director of

Inspections at the Immigration section of the Ministry of Interior.

He then gave

the following explarstion for the delais so far encountered in the case:

8.

So lar as the Mexican Gevernment mors, HALPERIN has not, while

in Nexico, done anything harmful to Mexico.

It is, thereiore, alnost

impossible to açoly Article 35 as the Constitution against hir. Article

33, which gives the President poses to depori any undesirable foreigner,

Is, in effect, applied very innuently.

the

Ohe of the reasors is that

case must be very clear that tio foreigner has operates against

l'exican interests. Another is tiat the case must be very strona since

the intended victin ray appeal lo the counts.

A third reason, particularly

applicable in tris case, is that to Government does not bisi: to take

strong action in, this case, wiich it regaras as political ratier than

criminal.

The averament is respectinà the Mexican princiole of granting

political asylur, ani at the sare time does not wish to sut hirself into

a position whers it can becone the target of attacks fron'lereist elements in

the country.

Te government is further in a bad position in tais case

because Halperis sorked ior a covertment department (Naciral Financicra)

and the Government of various intivijuals in it do not wist. to be placed in the

position of having in admit ther tale a bad selection.

b. Underlinine the.

cited two (2) exampies iran personal knowleiges

dirriculties of apolving Article 33, W9KILiK-2

An inerican sadist is still in Hexico, in jail, thrugh .

he is wanted dy the l'. S. and Mexico strorgly desires to depert

He is enjojiny a court in unction against deportatios and

has been for about four mantis.

In the case of francesca Scalia, jewel swindler and

immoral character, the Mexican Government tried to deport her

for may nonths but was successful only aftor soveral injunctions

c.

On the other hand, LINYAK-? states that the Government has a

recöurse which is not as blunt as Article 33 but is usually sufficient to

result in a person's leaving Mexáco. This consists of communicating to

the subject the Mexican Government's dissatisfactinn with having him in

the country and inviting lim to leave 1t In a certain period.

The period

can vary from a couple of weeks to several months.

This, Incidentally,

was the means used to öbtain the departure of the Nicaraguan Communist

Mario SOst Navarro early in 1957, in a test operation mounted by the

station through LIXAYNK=2.

LIKAYK-2 states he is thoroughly convinced that his Government

intends to "invite" Haiperin to leave the country.

ne points out;

however, that malperin could probably get one or more injunctions

against

this measure:

?. LIKAYAK-? appeared to take the matter very personally but pointed out that

in Mexico tie legal forms

are observed and the the US. Government, which also

in scrupulous in its observance of such forms, should be able to understand tbe

situation.
