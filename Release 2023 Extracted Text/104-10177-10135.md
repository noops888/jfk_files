Contract agent, Paul D. IAhGaVIli, 1s the sole oner and editor

of the English-lanquage paper, South PcifIc Mall, which Is

published weekly in Santiago, Chile. The printing of this

publication vas formerly done by an outsido firm. Desiring to

hardle both his own printing recuircents and to engege in job

printing, LANGEVli: obtainca cquiment from an individual who

expected to he componsated through a partnership in the busi-

ness. However, scrious illness has prevented the rrospective

parter from entering the business, and hos forced IN!GEVIl! to

nect the financial obligation alone.

The ropayment of this

obligation will roguire LANGUVIl cither (1) to accept a Chilean

pertrer in his business, or (2) to obtain a loan.
