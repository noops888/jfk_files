HEXORANDUM

SUBJECT: Bahanas/United States Black Power Ties

I. The nonthly report on the Bahamas for October 1968

Iron an official British service contains several references

to ties beiween Black Power groups in the Bahamas and the

united States, which are provided, in full, below.

A summary

of the report, omitting portions concerning the United States

or United States citizens, is being disseminated (see attached

report).

2.

The items of possible interest, onitted from the

dissemination, are noted below:

A. On 29 October 1968 Dr. Alfred D. K1ng,

brother of the late Dr. Martin Luther King,

delivered a highly inflammatory address of a

racialist character at a public meeting in Nassau

He severely attacked disparities in the Bahamas

between white and colored members of the popula-

tion:

The disparities were highly exaggerated by

King who said that, while there was political

freedom in the Bahamas, black Bahamians

did not

have economic freedom.

B. It is apparent that King came to the

: Bahamas on the invitation of Dudley Williams,

President ot the Bahamas Engineering Fuel and

Allied Workers Union, and Reverend R.E. Cooper,

a Baptist Minister.

As King's visit was his first

and was for so short a time, it is evident that

he spoke from a prepared

brief.

Another visiting

speaker, Ersaine Hepburn, a Bahamian-born U.S.

naturalized citizen, President of Branch No.

339

of the ATL/CIO in Jacksonville, Florida, delivered

an address on sinilar lines as did Williams.

Both indicated

that King might be invited to return

to the Bahanas.

c.

The impression gained is that Willians is

identifying the leaders of the Bahamas Federation

of Trade Unions with the Government and is

endeav

oxing to extend the struggle within the union

novement into the political field.

To do this he

is prepared to exploit militant racialism
