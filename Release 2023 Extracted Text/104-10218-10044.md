SUBJECT

Renewal of Project LIHUFF

1.

Renewal of Project LIHUFF in the amount of

$4,000 is requested for the period I July 1969 through

30 June 1970.

The Project was budgeted for $4,000 for

FY 1970 and funds are available within WH Division.

LIHUFF represents Mexico City Station's access

into right wing political elements and organizations in

Nexico,

and provides contact with the large and influ-

American business community there.

In addition,

his access to Dun and Bradstreet reports has also been ..

useful in carrying out checks on WOLADY citizens of

operational intcrest to the Station. During the project

year three field information reports were credited to

the Project, one of which was disseminated by Head-

quarters,

and some thirty-five background investigations

and file

traces were conducted by

the agent.

3.

In paragraph D "Effectiveness" of the attached:

renewal request it was noted,

"He (LIHUFF-1) also organ-

ized at the request of COS (who, in turn,

had been

requested by Headquarters) a public demonstration in

front of the Soviet Embassy in protest against the in-

vasion of Czechoslovakia."

A review

of the LITEMPO

Project reveals that LITEMPQ4 was paid $4,000.00 by the

Station to organize and rally as many students as possibie

in addition to the JURO planned demonstration in tront of

the Soviet Embassy, and to Headquarter's knowledge LIHUFF-

did not organize the student demonstration on behalf of th

4. The Desk feels that this Project should be reviewed

during the upcoming project year to determine whether it

should be continued.

MEMORANDUM POR: DC/WH

SUBJECT

Renewal of Project LIHUFF

1. Project LIHUFE covers a singleton agent (a U.s.

citizen) who has been managed directly by the COS, Mexico

City, and who has worked for WHID for nore than twenty years,

beginning in Panama and continuing in Mexico. LIHUFF-1 pro

vides the Station access to right-wing political elements and

contact with the American business community in Mexico City

(he is executive director of the American businessman's

association).

2. The project provided three disseminations in Fiscal

Year 1969, and it is deened unlikely that it will ever be a

source of effective and meaningful intelligence.

3. WH/FI suggests that LIHUFF-1 be considered for one or

several specific support tasks, which represent a continuing

burden for Station lexico City, and that he no longer be con-

sidered as a source of intelligence.

no

4. If lt is ascertained that he can perform/support

task(s), we advise that the project be terminated. In the

meantine, we recommend approval in the amount of $4,000 for

Fiscal Year 1970.

This agent is used as a source for background, opera-

tional and investigative data. For that reason

it does not

produce a sufficient amount of positive intelligence to justify

its existence for that purpose. Its real value is the

availability of this agent and

his contacts to the Chief of

station, Mexico, for a

current reading on right-wing political

activities and personalities.

He is also a primary investiga-

tive source for information on WOLADY citizens of operational

interest to the Station.

produced by Dunn & Bradstreet in Mexico and can have investiga-

tions conducted by them.

MENORANDUM FOR: Chief, Western Hemisphere Division

SUBJECT:

Renewal of Project LIHUFF

Renewal of Project LIHUFF in the amount of $4,000

is requested for the period l July 1968 through 30 June

The project was

budgeted for $4,200 for FY 1969 and

funds are available within WH Division.

2. During the past year,

one progress report was

received,

in June 1968,

recapitulating the activities

reported

in the attached renewal request.

Although the

Station has made use of LIHUFF's relations with the right

wing student organization,

Evgeniy YEVTUSHENKO's visit to

MURO lexico this

in connection with

spring, the

use of MURO is being de-emphasized.

The main value of

LIHUFF/1, a long time collaborator

previously serving in

Panama and beginning in OSS days, is his availability to

service various requests which the COS may make of him

and to provide insight into the activities of the extreme

right wing of Mexican politics.

His access to Dun and

Bradstreet reports has also been useful.

REQUEST FOR RENEWAL

PROJECT LIHUFF

A.

CURRENT OBJECTIVES

The objective of this project is to provide support for a singleton

contract agent, LIHUFF-1,

who is the Executive Director of the most;

important organization of WOLADY businessmen in Mexico. He also

continues to have access to right-wing political elements and

organizations in dexico, one of which is a right-wing student

group

(principally at the Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico -

UNARI) •

• B. CHANGES

1) Operational Mechanism

There have been no changes

in this respect since the previous

project renewal. was submitted.

2) Agents

The only agent to be supported by this project for the coming

year is LiHUFF-1.

C. INTELLIGENCE PRODUCTION

This agent is used as a source for background, operational and

Investigative data.

For that reason it does rot produce a suffi-

cient amount of positive intelligence to justify its existence

for that purpose.

It's real value is the availability of this

!

agent and his contacts to the Chief of Station, Mexico, for a

current reading on right-wing political activities and

He is also

personalities.

a primary investigative source for information on WOLADY

citizens of operational interest to the Station.

This agent has

access

all reports produced by Dunn & Bradstreet in Mexico and

can have investigations conducted by them.

For example, some forty

Dunn & Bradstreet reports have been obtained (via LIHUFF/1) on

persons and/or organizations of interest.

D.

EFFECTIVENESS

During the project year, the agent provided the Station with

SECRET/KAPOK

- 2 -

This agent kept the Chief of Station, Mexico, advised of right-

ving political activities and student participation in anti•

LNHARP demonstrations which occurred at least once each month

LIHUFF-1 conducted some twenty background investigations and file

traces for the Station, in addition to those cited in C above.

In March LINLUCK prevailed upon a Mexican book publisher to print

copies

of the LINLUCK open letter to Yevtushenko as well as

the

text of the telegram by Soviet intellectuals to the Consultative

anita

Conference of Communist Parties in Budapest asking for an end to

Soviet persecution of intellectuals.

The latter handbill was

illustrated with LINWCK pen and ink drawings of Sinyavsky and

Daniel behind barbed wire.

At the same time the Station produced

several thousand cartoon and text handbills of a beatnik Yevtu-

shenko dancing

into Mexico tossing flowers.

Turning a fold of the

handbill revealed a Russian officer striking off the nib of a

Soviet writer's pen

with his sword.

In a wet run in January LITEAR-

1 dirocted four

snall boys in the distribution of the cartoon hand-y

bill in the artists' district of Mexico where Station monitors

watched students and artists read and pocket the cartoon handbill.

The cartoon handbill was again distributed in the artists' district'

on the day of Yevtushenko's arrival.

The following day, when

Yevtushenko held his first recital at Mexico City's Chapultepec

agreer

Park, one of the handbills was distributed by LICOAX students;

while members of the "MURO" rightist student organization under

direction of LIHUFF quietly distributed the other two handbills.

Station officers verified that everyone in the audience held copies

This project has presented the Station with no problems of security

MEMORANDUM TO: Chief, Western Hemisphere Division

SUBJECT

: Request for Renewal of Project LI HUFF

It is requested that Project LIHUFF be renewed

in the amount of $4,200.Ou for the period 1 July 1967

through 30 June 1968.

Funds are available in WH Division.

Project costs are estimated to be the same as last year.

2.

LIHUFF represents Mexico City Station's access

into right wing circles, and also provides contact and

rapport with the large and influential American business

community there. It will be observed from the attached

renewal request

that a considerable portion of the

project's accomplishment was along political action

Lines,

but it has nevertheless been decided to maintain

as an FI activity, Since the addition of the

investigative function to LIHUFF-l's mission balances

the project more heavily on the FI side.

There has been

no progress reporting since 16 November 1966, at which

time the station recounted the harrassing of

a Czech

official, the Soviet Embassy and the Chinese art exhibit.

infrequent reporting is explainable.

REUEST FOR REMENAL

PROJECT LINUE?

CURRET OBJECTIVES

• The oujective o. his projece is to provide support for a singleton

contract agent, LInurF-1 who is the Executive Director of tie nost

Inportant organization of Inerican businessmen in kexico. Fe also

continues to have access to right-wing volitical elecents erà organi-

zations in Mexico: and through these contacts, has access to ? right-

wing student grous (prineipally at the Universidad lacional firtonoma

de Mexico - UNA!).

3. CHANGES

1) Operational Wechanisa

The LIUFP Project was approses 18 June I966 for the period 1 July

1966 through 30 June 1907. LLiUEr-1, the contract azent Involvel,

has been a contact of the Mexico Station since 1950.

sefore that tige

he vas a contrect agent for station Parnme wher. he was in busiress in

that arca.

In lorenöer 1902 tre relationshi, vas fomalized into

contract status wits LIHUrF-l acting as a funding channel to 27 anti-

Comrunist rescarch group and richtist student group -eaded bj

LIHUF1-2, as well as handlira LICHAN-l and reporting on richt-wing

activities from other conservative ousiness sources. Subsidles to

action groups were discontinued via LIhUFF-l during 1965.

1966 LIHUFF-1 has been used as a support asset doing credit and other

type investigations with his overt position as cover.

Bradstreet listings and investigations are examples of the kind of

checks LINUFF-1 provides.

2) Agents

The only agent to be supported by this project for the coming year is

LIHUFF-1.

C. INTELLIGENCE PRODUCEION

the Mexico Statior makes no effor

to justify this project on the basis of positive intelligence dis-

seminations or the maber of dispatches or cables produced by it.

LIHUFF-1 meets regularly with ard is handled directly by Willar

c. CURTIS, Chief of station, Mexico. The agent is used to obtain

Information on activities of right-wing political groups in l'exico.

Much of this is marginal in comparison with activities of other

-2.

political groups, nevertheless, the Ambassador dedends upon Station

Mexico for infornation on all political groups.

MTHUPF-1 1s the only

Station asset who circulates freely in these circles.

During the

past year, LIHUFF-l has conducted through his organization, investigations

and checks on firms and individuals connected with them. This type of

operational data is not availabie fron any other sources. LIHUFF-1 has

access to all reports produced by Durf & Bradstreet in Mexico; and can

have investigations initiated by then and others.

D. EXFECTTVENESS

Sore examples of the effectiveness of this project are:

1) During the past year, LIHUFP-1 provided guidance to a right-wing

action group which launched a press attack against the Commercial

officer of the Czech Boassy (Subject of 201-204656) which resulted

in his PCS transfer fron Mexico.

2) In late Augusi 1966 LIIIUFF-1 arranged for a right-wing action

group to conduct a harrassment of a Chinese Comunist Art Exhibit at

the UNAM wnich resulted in the closinz of the exhibit. This action

was taken as a result of a personal request of the Chief LINPURE.

3) In October 1966 LIHUFF-1 arranged for a student action group to

conduct a denonstration in front of the Soviet imbassy on the loth

anniversary of the crushing of the hungarian rebellion. This resulted

in considerable press comment against the Soviets with plotographic

coverage of a casket and anti-soviet banners on the sidewall in front

of the Soviet Embassy.

4) Some investigations conducted by LIHUFP-1 through his firm were:

REQUEST FOR RENERAL

PROJECT LIHUFF

A. CURRENT OBJECTIVES

me objective of this project 1s to provide for the operationa.

and administrative support for a high-level contrect ezent, LIHUFF-l

who has access and is a participant in the right-wing political

elements and organizations in Mexico; and through one of these con-

tacts, has access to a right-wing student group (principally at the

Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico - UNAM).

B. CHANGIDS

1) Operational Mechanism

The LIHUFF Project was approved in September 1965 for the period

1 July 1965 through 30 June 1966.

LIhuFr/1, the singleton agent

Involvea, has been & contact of the Mexico station since 1950.

Before that time he was a contract agent for Station Panama when he

was in business in that area. In November 1962 the relationship las

formalized into contract status with LIHUPP/1 acting es a funding

channel to an anti-Couuunist research group and rightest student group

headed by LIHUFF/2, as well as handling LICHANT/1 and reporting on

right-wing activities from other conservative business sources.

activity tas

This

funded from Station OOA until 1 July 1965.

The LIlUFF

Project provided only for salary and operational expenses for LIUFP/1.

2) Agents

The only agent to be supported by this project for the coming year

1s LIHUFF/1.

No further subsidies are planned to LIfUfE/2.

LICHANI/1

was relieved of his position in the Ministry of Education and 1s not

included as a part of the LIHUFF Project.

However, LIHUFF/1 continues

in his private business capacity to solicit funds for the LIHUFF/2 group

and will continue to use them as sources for Inforation on right-wing

political activities.

C. INTELLIGENCE PRODUCTION

The Mexico Station makes no effort to justify this project on the basi

of positive intelligence disseminations. The information is primaril

for background.

It is often too sketchy for formal dissenination and is

frequently overtaken by public events before a dissemination c:n be

made.

LIHUFT/1 meets regularly with and is handled directly by

111lard C. Curtis, Chief of Station Mexico.

The agent is used to

btain information in response to Priority A.3. of the most recen

Related Mission Directive (HMI-4218, 27 July 1966). In addition tr

the RMD, Chief PESHDIG depends upon Station lexico for informatior

on all political groups.

LIHUFF/1 represents the only high-level

source trained and available who can circulate freely in Mexicar

concervative political circles and provide the Mexico Station with

information on their activities.

During the past project year

LINUFF/1 has provided the Station with the following general

categories of Information:

1)

Menoranda on leftists or Coumunist affiliation of members of

the Mexican intellectual and official community.

This is

2)

Information on Catholic Church activities In Mexico, Incluling

press clippings and periodic reports on the rightest student

action group, Movimiento Universitario Renovadora Orientacion

(MURO) active at the Universidad Necional Autonoma de Mexico

(UNAM), the Universities of Puebla, Guadajalara and Michoacan.

In 10,325, the only positive intelligence dissemination receive

from LIHUFF during the past project year was obtained frow th

MURO group at UNAM. In August 1965, Chief, PBSWING assed for

a complete report on "Los Tecos", a right-wing Catholic secret

society of which MURO is a student arm.

required by Chief, PEStNiS, to make a decision on the application

of the Universidad Autonoma de Guadalajera (U.A.G.) for certain

U.S. Goverrment-sponsored monetary grants of several hundred

thousand dollers to be used for development of this anti-

Cosmunist University which is competitive with the Communist

doninated University of Cuzcalajara.

From background data

previously supplied by LInuEr and otber sources, a detailed

report was made available to Chief, PBSWING.

3) Anti-Comunist publications from LIUFF/2's right-wing

research center and MURO student publications, all of which

are available to Headquarters and are of interest to the Station

for background.

political activities. Also, as previously reported to Headquarters,

the groups influenced by LIUFF, i represent a potential for counter

balancing for leftist and Communist pressure groups.

One example

of this can be cited in action taken by student MURO leaders in August

1965. The Cuban Ambassador to Mexico, Joaquin PERILANDEZ Armas, set

about making speeches at Mexican (leftist) Universities*of-Tabasco,

Michoacan and Cuadalajara proposing Maxican-Cuban student exchanges.

MURO members Immediately set up a storm of public protest, deranding

that HEFNANDEZ Armas be declared persona non-grata for spreading

subversive propaganda and agitating on university campuses. This

caused FERNANDEZ, Armas to be a target for considerable unpleasant

press publicity.

Through LIHUFF/1, the Station Mexico can exploit

such incidents when it 16 to KUBARK's advantage to do so.

E. PROBTEMS

There have been no significant security, cover or control problem

with IIUFP/1 during the project yeer.

P. LIAISON

This project involves no liaison relationship.

G. INTER-AGENCY COORDINATION

This project imolves no Inter-agency coordination.

H. PLANS

Renewal of Project LIHUFF

...

1.

Renewal is requested of the LIHUFF Project for the

period 1 July 1965 through 30 June 1966 for a total of

$9,000.

The LIHUFF Project was originally approved on 20

April 1965 for $7,500 for the period 1 January 1965 to

30 June 1965 as a CA Project.

It has been decided that

project objectives in general will be changed from CA to

as an FI Project.

Division.

2.

The Project objectives under CA were to support

and sustain MURO,

a national right-wing student movement,

through a long-established anti-communist front organiza-

tion in Mexico,

the Instituto de Investigaciones Sociales

• Economicas

(IISE) •

This support was terminated effective

30 June 1965 as it became apparent that the list was

financially capable of providing this support on its own

and MURO became more and more controversial and extrenely

militant on the far right.

Under the new project sub-

mitted by the Station, support will be provided to a U.s.

contract agent who has access to a wide variety of right-

wing political elements and organizations in Mexico.

The

project is responsive to Priority A3d and f of the RND.

WH/1 recommends approval of the new LIHUFF Project

as it is set forth in the attached Station renewal request.

The delay in submission of the renewal request is that it

was just decided to change this Project to FI and cancel

1.

Project LIHUTY has been acttve as a CA project for

a number of years.

Its purpose and objective in to support a

singleton U.B, contract agent (LIAUTT-1) who has access to a

wide vartoty of right wing political elements and organias-

tions in Mexico in order to develop Inforation on this

political and social sector.

This effort 18 in consonance

with priority ald and 1 of the RiD and is the only one which

covers rightiat political activity lu lexico.

Since LIHUFP vas previously & CA project, there 15,

therefore, no data on which to judge past intelligence product

although three reports resulted in the past year.

Desk and the station are taking steps to prepare sultable

requirenents in leeping with LIHUll-l's access and the objoctives

The reportiny received Iron the Station with regard te

the operational status

effective 1 July 1965.

Of this amount $5,400 1s narked for

The Organization and its Director have:

8. Furnished the Mexico City Station with index cards and

active student organization in the nation's universities. It is called

PUNO (Fist), a fighting anti-Cummunist student paper and has organized

shock brigades ready and willing to take offenvive (street fighting)

action. MURO has bean very active in the National University of

Mexico (UNAM); the University of Puebla and the University of

Michpacan. In the last two MURO can claim a large degree of the credit

for ousting Communlas rectore al these universities. (

c. Kept its publication, ESPEJO, actively attempting to counter

overwhelming odds and advantages held bypro-Marxist econcmiste and

their teachinga in Mexico, Chiel-ONACH believes the Director and the

organization are most useful in this regard.

d. Taught groups of students pro-capitaliat, pro-free enterprise

Communists have taken over the field of economica in higher education.

e. Continuoualy published pro-*BPRIME, pro-íree enterprise

1. At the time the LIHUFF activity 1s approved as a formal project,

it is the present intention to turn over the operation to either

Oliver N. PRIMACK or Stewart R. PATAKER as the case officer. However,

for obvious reasons, it is not desired to make the introduction of one of

these individuals to LIHUFF/1 until such time as an assurance of continuity

with Headquarters' approval of the activity as a formal project has been

received.

2. In view of the time which has elasped since the exchanges

in referenced dispatches have taken place, the Station would appreciate an

indication from Headquarters whether or not LIHUFF is being processed as a

project. If it is not or approval has been denied for one icason

another, the Station would

also appreciate knowing this so whatever action

has to be undertaken can be initiated.

With the discontinuance of the subsidy for the publication

of the LIHurT magazipe as reported in Paragraph 3 of Reference B.

Headquarter's majorlobjection to this project has been satisfied.

compelled to point out to the Station that despite

disapproval of this subsidy in Reference A,

the Station

continued payment of it for an additional five months.

In the absence

of any interim reporting or other attempt to justify this continued

expenditure, the Station Chief exceeded his fiscal authority.

Although Headquarters is prepared to make a concession to the station

with regard to other aspects of the project as stated later in this

we must advise you that the prolongation of the LIHUFF-1-

magazide subsidy for five months is viewed here with great serfousness

requested that lillard C. Curtis prepare a dispatch explaining

With regard to other facets of the project, we are willing

to continue for a time even though we are not fully

convinced that

the level of LIHUFF-l's compensation or the student activities

supported

are justifiable.

To avoid an arbitrary termination of the

entire operation at this time, you are authorized to proceed for

Year 1964 on the following basis:

A. To continue LIHUFF-'s compensation at $500 per month.

support selected student activities through the

LIHUFF complex at a rate not to exceed $500 a month.

DISPATCH BYMBOL AND NUMBER

HOW 12311

Should you wish to support other specific projects through LIHUFF

such as

the publication of the book, these will be considered by

Headquarters on a case to case basis.

3.

The above authorized expenditures are to be charged to

D&TO and under no circunstances are they to exceed the amounts

specified.

In this connection, you are advised that Headquarters has

allocated an adúitional $30,000 to the Station's D&TO funds for the

fiscal year 1964 bringing the total for FY64 to $82,500. It 15 not

likely that any further increase can be obtained.

The Station is also requested to submit to Headquarters,

not later than I June 1964, an up-dated assessment of the LIHUFF

operation.

If at that time the Station wishes to present a revised

project for fiscal year 1965, your recommendations should be fully

submitted in the reassessnent.

If your recommendations are accepted,

chen Headquarters will undertake to rewrite the project outline

Porarded with HMMA 20931 and submit the project for approval.
