Previous information has indicated that the

captioned anti-Castro orgenization is planning to carty out

a bombing raid over Cuba from Bimini in the Bahama Islands.

The airplane scheduled to be used in the raid reportedly is

located at the Broward International Airport, Fort Lauderdale,

Florida.

On December 14, 1963, our source in this matter who has

furnished reliable information in the past advised that

William Johnson, a United States citizen, pilot and businessman

who has previously been involved in anti-Castro activities,

received $450 from the treasurer of the captioned organization

for obtaining the airplane to be used in this operation.

On December 16, 1963, our source advised that the

airplane to be used on the bombing raid is an Aero Commender,

number N2624B, which is located at Broward International Airport

and which is the property of Charles Bush who operates an

aviation compony at the airport. Bush is scheduled to fly the

airplane from Fort Lauderdale to Bimini. Practice flights were

scheduled to be made on December 16 and 17, 1963, and

consideration was being given to having the airplane fly over

Bimini during the December 17, 1963, flight.

Our source further advised that the captioned

organization intends to utilize two boats in this operation.

denolition bombs which will have departed from the Homestead,

Florida, area.

The bombs will be loaded on the bigger boat

which will then proceed to the airport at Bimini. Our source

believes that a small farm owned by Laredo Rodriguez, treasurer

of the captioned organization, located in the area of Honestead

Bay Front Park, on or near a canal, will be utilized in the plans

for the departure of the small boat.

According to information obtained by our source, the

bombing expert who will participate in this operation is one

Orlando Ramirez. Avallable information indicates that thés

individual is possibly identical with Deniel Orlando Reminez Denis

who has served as a bombing expert on one or more raids previously

conducted by the captioned organization.

Orlando Bosch Avila, head of the captioned organization,

has indicated he desires that this operation take place during

the current week.

British authorities were advised of the above

Nofe mation.
