-JUL 1519/1

MICROFILMEO

During JKLANCE's most recent attempt to contact

AMETROPIA-1 via AlBIUG-1, it became readily apparent that

the cover story AMNUG-1

utilized with his immediate

superior was unsatisfactory from two points:

First, 1t

did not permit us the operational flexibility so necessary

in an approach of this sort and secondly, if AMMUG-1 had

not returned when he did, his job security would have been

jeopardized.

2. To correct the above deficiency, WH/Miami has

arranged

the following with the Miami Field Office (MO):

In the luture,

if we again utilize AMMUG-1 to approach a

PBRUMEN official,

we will ask that the MFO arrange to have

one of their representatives from their leadquarters

component contact the appropriate senior official of

ANMUG-l's company.

This

senior official will in turn

nötify AMMUG-l's immediate superior that AlMUG-l is to be

permitted to travel

on matters of importance to the

Department of Defense.

Transmitted under separate cover is a copy of

a memorandum we received from the MFO concerning the above

arrangements.

ACTION REQUINTO . REFERIMCES

MICROFILM

ACTION REQUIRED: None, FYI only

1.

During the 'undersigned's most recent meeting with

AMMUG-1,

the agent stated that a Mr. Rex M.

investigator

an

of

the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service

•(INS) had visited him on 13 April 1971.

According to AMMUG-1,

the purpose of Griffin's visit

was to inquire into AMMUG-1's

present welfare and to determine his relationship to

Rodino.

(COMMENT:

Mr. Rodino is the sponsor of

HI.R. #2076 which

will expedite AMMUG-1's application for U.S.

citizenship by

waiving the standard waiting period.)

When asked

about his relationship with Mr.

kodino, AbMuG-l simply explained

that Mr. Rodino was a friend of his from Washington.

Griffin explained that the reason that he wanted to

talk to AMMUG-1 personally,

was the fact that nearly all of

information surrounding AMMUG-1 was hold in INS$ office in

Washington.

He added that the information that was held by the

Miami office was closely held and access to the files was

severely restricted.

During his visit, Griffin asked AMMUG-1 11

he noticed any unusual interest in his comings and goings, to

which AMMUG-1 replied negatively.

3.

In view of above, believe it reasonable to assume that

Griffin suspects that JKLANCE is somehow involved with AMMUG-1.

This position is concurred in by Station Officer who maintains

11aison with the Miami office of the INS.

Mr. Griffin's visit as being

that he was

"muy anable".

In sum,

there does not appear io be any need for intervention on

or on that of the Station.

If the need does

arise, we will promptly. Inform Headquarters.

According

to AMMUG-1, FRANCO 15 G-2

is one of the individuals he

approached (at our behest) during

the Pan American games

which were held in Puerto Rico in 1966.

FRANCO dismissed AMMUG-l's initial approach out of hand

stating that he was a Marxist-Leninist.

According to AIMUG-1,

while a follow up was supposed to be made in caguas,

• Rico, the staff officer who was accompanying AMUG-I decided

against it.

jorge E.'

FGARCIA-BANGO Dirube (201-736192)

AMMUG- 1

commented that GARCIA-BANGO was the other individual that

he tried to approach during the Pan American games. Like

while a follow up was planned for Caguas,

Puerto Rico, the staff officer accompanying AMWUG-1 decided

LOBAINA Lobalria.

AMMUG-1 commented that he

did not know LOBAINA very well.

He added that he used to

be AMMUG-l's instructor in firearms at the Police Academy.
