assanitized

he was employed by the FBI and recd salary of U.S.

$700 month

and was en route to colombia on drug

case at that tine.

MORALES is not listed in the

IIX ISR source registry and I do not know what if

any current association he has with FBI.

On 2 Oct 72 BNDD Mini registered MORALES in the

narcotics rejistry as its larormaat..

LiDD HeS

aware at that time that MORALES was of interest

to the rol and stated. that SoD did not intend

to conter with or negotiate with pRIOr how MORALE:

was to be used

In 72 MOPALES claimed to Caracas asset that he was

in touch with CTi but we unable to substartlate claim

so apparently it untrue.
