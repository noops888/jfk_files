Below (USCHIVENESS):

operational - As noted in the previous Request for Project Ronewel,

tie fortor LINITED property was sold to uncushs, who as per forcel auree-

went with the Station, denolished the oid structure and constructed a now

edifice.

Undle It was initially conte-plated to pleco the LETIlD

moullicationg

An Increase in the hours of both the plotographic ad physical survelliance

coverage provide pros the new baco by the LILYAIC oporators (0600-1600

hourg) during the lecidaya and to have the LEITED base provide

photographic aid piusical curveillance coverase fror 1600-1930 hours

on weekdays and fun e900-1300 hours on weokends. These changes were

dictated by the followini considerations:

1.

The now LINUSIE bullding offers a nuch better vantage point

for both photographle aid physical curveillanco than does the

present complex which houses the LILTIC tha LIND hases.

Therofore, the Station ielt that the persomel occupying this

new baco should be those possessing the higheat techrical skilla

and also those able to provide tho cost thorough and completo

covorase. Since the LItted base now hes auly one trained

operator while te LILYRIC bacchouse has threo, the LIlyiuC group

and a revision of horkina hours was indicates.

2. Jecause it was apparent that the coverajo of the LImuCK

is station

Installation would do a long-rance and continuing requiresent,

tho Station desired to stafi the new base with personnel of long

ranse potential. LIMPTY-S, nor alrost do jears old, does not

possess this potential; however, the LILYRIC agent complex

happily combines experienced personiel vith youthful ajents.

vas a front apartment available which vas Ideally suited for our purposes.

LINCHPIN contactod the owner who stitod that the apartmont was not for rent sinco

his douchtor vas goin; to novo Into. 1t. The oner did offer LINCHPIN his

daughter's old gartmont which was in the back of the building.

LINCHPIN

contacted the daughter and found that hor apartrent une not suitod for our

and santioned to hor casually that should she not taka the front

apartment, he would be interested.

She told LINCHPIN that she didn't really

series os moves would not cover the trail of the furniture to an experienced

Investigator, 1t vill prevent questions by neighbors who seo the furniture boing

noved just one-hali block and alao prevent carents fron the noving men thes

who would save the furniture thie ano half blook.

Since

the RAPPER baso consisted of one bedroos and the LILYRIC base contains

three.

bedrooms, and is generally largor In all ruspocts, it will be nacessary to

purchase additional furniture to nake LINCHPI!'s occupancy normal in all

appearances. It is estinatod that the requistte asount of furniture nooded for

into purpose will not accregato in excess as 5500 US.

Further,
