AMCHALYAS WAS ABLE TO STOP HIM HALF A BLOCK FROM HIS

AND CARRIED ON A SIX MINUTE CONVERSATION. INITIALLY AMWOLF/I

WAS COLD, VISUALLY UPSET BUT LATER BECAME JOVIAL. AT FIRST

INSISTED THAT AMCHALK/S COME TO THE CONSULATE OR CALL HIM TO

SET UP MEETING. HOWEVER, ANCHALK/S INSISTED THEY TALX THEN

AND AMWOLF/I AGREED. AFTER AMCHALKAS MADE THE PIICH, AMWOLF/I

REACTED BY SAYING "THESE 'JOHNIES' HAVE EVERYTHING AND NOW THEY

REALLY STEPPED ON ME". AMWOLF/I ENDED THE CONVERSATION BY

AGAIN AKSING AMCHALKIS TO COME TO CONSULATE OR CALL HIM SO THEY

COULD HAVE ANOTHER TALK. AMWOLF/I RETURNED TO THE CAR WHERE HIS

AMWOLF/I WOULD CHANGE HIS POSITION NOW. AMCHALK/S BELIEVES WE SHOULD

WAIT A FEW DAYS BEFORE ATTEMPTING ANOTHER CONTACT EITHER BY ANOTHER

MEETING OR TELEPHONE CALLO STATION AGREES WE SHOULD WAIT A FEW.

DAYS: BUT THAT A TELEPHONE CALL SHOULD PRECEDE ANY MEETING. IF THE

TELEPHONE CALL PRODUCES A CONTINUED NEGATIVE REACTION, WOULD NOT PROCEED

WITH SECOND MEETING UNLESS HQS DESIRES CONTRARY. BELIEVE WE

WILL GET SOME REACTION FROM GUTINID IN THE NEXI SEVERAL DAYS.

ANOTHER FACTOR IS THAT AFTER THE ENCOUNTER, AMWOLF/I WENT TO THE

Greetings,

L.

I belicve that our chances for

success in this

(a) A'CHAlK-s is sufficiently courageous to mect A!HOLF-1

in the Cuban Anbassador's office in Madrid, if necessary;

(0) A kOlF-l is a trusted colleague and follower of

AMCHOST-1.

For this reason and in the belief that A'GHOST-I

he would find a way to deliver the

Subsoquent to the completion of the Attachment (SPR

on Subject),

we learned from AMSTALK that SHPILEY, in a recent transaction with a

local service contact, was observed to add fifteen

thousand pesos to

The contact receipted for the total amount, and SiMILEY then

returned five of tho extra fifteen thousand pesos to him. This type

of activity on SIPILEV's part appears to open up interesting oporationa

possibilities.

We plan to watch the situation carofully and will

advise you.
