Search request for

Lawrence P. Keenan

OGC-95-50350, dtd 10 Feb 95

1.

We have searched the JFK index and have found no

entry under the name "Lawrence P. Keenan" or any variation

of the name. The only Keenan in the index is Thomas, an

Agency staffer whose file was requested by HSCA.

Generally

names within a document are not indexed unless the

individual is the originator of the document, is the subject

of a file or is a key figure in the JFK story.

Three of the documents provided by Mr. Lesar were

found in the CIA JFK collection; none mention Mr. Keenan's

name.

The remaining three documents are not cIA documents,

and the copies provided by Mr. Lesar are not from the

The two FBI documents that mention

his name do not carry the release stamps used by HRG for

documents subject to the JFK. Act. They appear to be from an

earlier FBI release.

There may be other documents in the JFK collection

that mention an "FBI officer being sent to Mexico City",

however,

they are not retrievable via the index or a

reasonable search of the records.

Keenan v. U.S.DoJ & CIA

Barry,

1. Request that your office conduct a search to determine whether it has any records containing the name of Laurence P.

KEENAN (d.o.b. 23 Nov 1924; p.o.b. Dover, NH; SSN 002-16-7106). Since this request is pursuant to a lawsuit under FOIA and the

Privacy Act, all that is required is a search reasonably calculated to locate the responsive records. An index search should be sufficient;

no hand search is necessary.

2. KEENAN was an FBI agent who claims to have been involved with investigating Lee Harvey OSWALD's purported contact

with Cuban and Soviet agents in Mexico City. The ClA's IP&CRD office responded to Keenan that no records indexed by his name were

located, but I am unsure whether your office was tasked with the initial request.

3. Please do not hesitate to contact me via Lotus Notes or on x76135 if I may be of further assistance. Thanks.

Michael
