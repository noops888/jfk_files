During the period under review; Subject managed to gain full-time

employment as a

senior executive of an IBSPRITE governnent subsidized

scientific publication at a time of cconomic slowdow. when jobs were

not easy to get.. He did this without help from Headquarters or the

Station:

Such an achievement. is a tribute to subject's fluency in

French, his ability to write, his general sciontific know-now and his

good buisness sense. Over half of his salary therefore is now paid

by this company.

In converting to full-time enoloyment, a major ad-

justment, Subject's contribution to the Station operations in the

MARS! and IPPAST fiolds against which he is targetted temporarily

decreased somewhat.

Subject continued, however, to naintain contact

with three local MinRSil officials and initiated contact wich three

others.

He also continued to seaich for new leads to personalities in

the priority areas assigned to him.

Subject has the capability to call

on local scientists or technicians of just about any nationality with

the possible exception of TPFAST citizens.. Ho has used this near-

unique potential well.

sunject has had occasional difficulty switching from "professional"

or intellectual subjects' in his development of NAMRS! personalities

Section C (continued)

to the development of human relations. His forte is therefore

more in the field of spotting and making operational contacts

than in that of more than

_s.iort-range operational developnent.

Subject's operational situation makes it impossible for him to

attempt recruitments.

Thus, his very real achievements are not

by essence of the spectacular variety.

Subject's reporting has been satisfactory and continue to

be copious.

He could, however, further improve the selectivity

of the

leads provided the Station and make more of an effort to

"digest" the information contained in his reports.

Although Subject has, at present, no supervisory function.

he häs repeatedly requested such a responsibility.

He is careful

with operational expanses and has exercised good security.

During the period under

review; additional efforts have been

made to make full use of Subject's potential and integrate him

further in the work of the station component with which he works.

He is a particularly valuable asset for the Station programs

directed against the local MHHARSH and TPFAST targets.

Section D (continued)

substantial.

In a word, is it worth it? We do not yet know,

although our initial impressions are favorable.

On the fitness report itself, this rater would have preferred

an "s" rating for specific duty number one; Subject may ultimately

deserve an

"O", but it does not seem warranted at the present time.

Moreover, I believe the overall rating would more properly have

been ir the higher range of the "p" category, rather than

"S",

but it is of course a subjective judgnent of the rating officer.

who is more intimately and directly involved with Subject on a

frequent basis.

In sum, the cover is superb, and'only time will reveal to

what extent the cover

requirements permit a full measure on be-

nalf of the Organization.

We are following this aspect closely

and will be conmenting upon it subsequently, as we gain experience

and knowledge.

COMMENYS OF HEVIEVING OFFICIAL

As previous Station correspondence and fitness reports will reflect, this

officer has been the subject of varying evaluations and projections in recent years.

In fairness to him, however, i, is equally true that an officer under non-oificial

cover reflects, in the level and quality of his performance, the amount and type

of guidance, direction and push he receives from the responsible inside case

Making allowances for these variables, this officer's past record has not

been impressive; however, it is also correct to note that he has improved sub-

stantially during the latter part of the period under review, and that is the Station

can work out some fiscal arrangement which will reduce the heavy financial input

Section D3 continued

from the Organization, his continued presence at this Station definitely

appears to be warranted for a sufficient period to reach more definite

conclusions concerning the level of sustained performance over a somewhat

longer period than that reflected by this report.

On balance, we are pleased that this officer has responded so well to

greater case officer direction and that he has undertaken somewhat more

aggressive. efforts to expand his range of contacts in immediate proximity

to the primary Station targets. This officer does bring many talents to bear

on his operational activity: he has absolutely fluent French, a solid and

exploitable cover, and a vast range of contacts in the local community.

Nonetheless, it will require additional time to explore these contacts in

depth, select those which appear to be operationally viable, and pursue

lein actively either to the point of recruitment by another officer or elimina-

tion from further development, for whatever reason.

In sum,

in spite of the recognized ind commendable improvement in this

officer's performance during the period under review, the reviewer submits

that the letter grade for specific duties 2 and 4 would morc properly have

been a "P", and that the ovcrall rating, at this point, would more accurately

be set at a level between "p" and "S", probably closer to the former than

the latter.

Thie reviewing comment has been read by the officers who prepared

the Fitness Report.

(b) are not necessarily visible to those "on the inside."

In the case of (a) facilitles it offers.

I must engage in a constant orchestration of

After all, the cover position is to them a legitimate, normal,

workaddy post in their fir.

What work

is done at their bidding,

..it follows, must be accomplished according to the high standarda

of thoroughness and accuracy which they have set.

In the case of (b) -- which derives from (a) -- and

can prove to

be so demanding that the

needs of the CS could no longer be served,

the incumbent is required to manage a span of hunan contacts at

several. levels in order to preserve his cover position and enhance

its value to the CS.

This means

planning, directing and

managing the work of multinational, multicultural teams of

technical correspondents,

as well as meetings and negotiations to

country authoritles he appears to be completely legltimate. From the more important

point of view of his targets, he also apparently has been accepted, and not through a

lack of opportunity for scrutiny, for what he claims to be. He thus represents for

KUBARK an asset who has not only solld status and access cover, but also the demonstrate:

capability for exploitiris his cover for speciflo and ageressive operational undertakings.

As has been stated in past fitness reports; his present capability directly and openly

to approach operational targets through the vehicle of his cover is the result of his ora

offorts, in which he has devoted a tremendous amount of work not only to establish and

enhance the foundations of the cover, which requires a considerable amount of work for

the cover company, but to devise and exploit ways and means by which the cover activity

may be applied directly to operational tasks and programs. In addition to operational

activity in his country of assignment, he has also been used in Hqs-directed actlvity in

other countries, usually involving direct contact with target individuals, and in addi-

Ition lie has

contributed greatly to the acquisition of operational Information for the

use of Hqs components in their overall approach to Soviet solentific and technioal tar-

gets.

It would be difficult to fault this employee with respect to energy, professional

skills, and mental capacity. He 18 a keen

student of his operational environment and

very skillful in analyzing

objectives. He shows considerable resourcefullness in devising logical and credible

SECTION C continued

approaches

to operational problems and personalities, and expends considerable

effort in maintaining a level of speclalized knowledge suffiolent to backstop his

cover and to ensure the maximum exploitation of his contacts with target organi-

zations and individuals.

His comrand of spoken, written, and technical French 1s

excellent.

From the point of view of supervision, this employee in his present position re-

quires guidance only Insofar as to identify specifie targets and for him to protect

nimself in situations vhere he does not have, by virtue of his not having access to

offloial files, specialized information. Otherwise, he requires no supervision

ottier-than the periodic provision of policy and operational directives.

This employee has always been conscious and punctillious in his preparation of

operational and administrative reports, Including financial accountings, and his

reporting in goneral, despite the burdens imposed by the necessity for minimizing

the risks inherent in the lack of access to classified storage, leaves nothing to

be desired.

Other than the funds for operstional activities, this employee currently has no

responsibility. for the programming and use of personnel, space, equipment, and

funds.

With respect to dedication to his Job, this employee has practically speaking

single-handedly built his present cover/operational position despite a number of

nogative factors inherent to his situation such as relative isolation, meager oppor

tunity for contact with his professtonal group; and expensive area of assignment,

and an exposed cover situation where the necessity for living cover 18 compounded

by the necessity of avoiding mistakoa wilch might Jeopardize cover. His dedication

to and enthusiasm for accepting the challenge ofthis assignment, and his willingness

to continue on in 1t, deserve particular mention, particularly since he hould per-

haps Justiflably feel that his present assignment may leave him outside the main-

stream of competitive organization progression.

This employee's health and family situations leave nothing to be desired, as his

proven mobility in the execution of operational assignments

attosts.

It should further be noted that with respect to the problom endemic to deep-cover

assignments of allocation of time between cover work and

operstional activity, this

employee comes very close in the happy norm of making cover work complement opera-

tional work, and making operational work contribute where possible to the enhance-

ment of cover.

While this employee's assignment to date has essentially been a one-man show, 1t

1s recommended that serious

consideration be given to expanding the operational com-

plex which he has created ir order to capitalize on his experience, the work he has

put in to date, and his own management capabilitles.

NAHRATIVE COMMENTS

The assignment of this employee to the fleld under non-official cover

was designed to compensate for the loss of an employee in an official covor

slot which vas cut from the Station's ODACID allotment of personnel positione.

During the reporting period this employee has accomplished with success

the convincing establishment of his cover in a complex milleu, and has been

aocepted as legitimate by his professional colleagues, the persons whom he

meets under cover, and the French authorities. It should be noted that his

abillty to assume his cover has been largely the result of his own effortg

solentifio field.

During the reporting period he has devoloped a wide circle of contacts

In the sclentific and journallstic fields and applies a lons, background in

a variety of assignments in KUDOVE to the determination and asgessment of

operational potential among these contacts. At the same time his cover

organization; 1n which only lour persong are witting of his actual status,

has shown itself to be more than satisfled with his performance of his cover

dutfos...

Inis empiogeo requires a minime of detailed operational supervision;

It 1s necessary 1n

specifio cases only to indicate the operational or infor-

mational objectives.

From the point of view of administrative support, his attention

detall and meticulousness reduce the problems of his support by the Station

to a minimum.

This employee uses the French language continuously, and his facility

1s such as to permit him to handle himself excellently. In a broad range of

complex tochnical subjects. He hay in addition undertaken specialized French

language training, to develop this capability further.

His. operational re-

porting 1s excellent both with regard to clarity and pertinence.

In the immediate future he will be assigned case work, for the most

part in fields were it will complement, and be complemented by, his in-

dependent operational

activitles and cover work.

DIKECTIONS:

Streas strengths and wonknesses, particularly those which affect development on present job.

Subject has excellent natural equipment for employment in this organization in

terms of his intelligence and natural apptitudes.

Additionally, he brings a

great deal of area knowledge and language ability to his present assigment.

turing the perlod covered by this report he has displayed great industry and

devotion to duty in a varlety of circumstances and achieved notable results

in production and in the creation of both short and long-term assets for his

unit. On the debit side I would say that he is sonewhat too businesslike in

many personal situations to the point of being almost humourless.

This, however,

is a quality which he does not permit to intrude upon the nocessities of his

operational work although it often shows in office relationships.

The slot

and Job which he now occuples, Chief, Soviet branch, 18, of course, adequate:

te accommodate such a promotion.

Richardson's operational performance has been outstanding and

sotably rergatile during this period.

He has engaged. primarily 1n 11a13on

and has been personally affective In terns of results achloved almost dally,.

In terns of reporto, operational data, and Jolot enterprises while, overall,'

he has established endurine professional relationships fron which the

organisation as a whole should benefit for sona time to come.

In addition,

owing in large part to unique personal talents, linguistic an otherwise,

Richardson has handed a muber of unilateral cases most elfoctivaly.

the offico, too, as woll as in face-to-laco operational situations,

Richardson

has been cutstanding. He has a flair for and a facility with the written word

a8 evidencad by tha amount of general and particular correspondence which he

has initlated, and he knows the organizational "dr1ll" Intinately and fran way

Thus, I feal that he 1s quallfied for she raconmended promotion by

ability and experience in both the internel and extemal aspects of the

protession.

Relative to the nore personal characteristics Imolved in the term

managerial ability, judgments are recessarily nore subjective but here, too,

I consider Richardoon to be qualified in naturity, 1n judgrent, and in

He would most certainly be a supervisor who could

perforn all

In actual fact, he has had considerable experience in this

is a rural In extend of personal rentson chandon a rot rethout

times and mantfestly impattent in cartain human situations where a shrue of:

the shoulders would be the best reply. These characteristica do not always

make for the best personal relationships but are frequently obviated by

intellect and above all are correctable and are being corrected.
