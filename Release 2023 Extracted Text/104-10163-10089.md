Cuban national, a medical doctor, uho resides in axile in the us.

-Since

1962, he has been associated with active anti-coc organizationa in the

Us and chroughout Latin America.

:

(This report was developed by an Army representative assigned to the office

of preparation.)

1. Late In 1963, General Andotecto Somoza, Director, National Guard of Nicarague,

vas a patient in Baltimore's John Hopkins Hospital for approximarely one

onth. I vialted the General at the hospital In two occasions and wai

appalled at

la appearance: he was a very sick man. He was sufferin

from hepatitia and had had a nervous breakdorm.

do part of the treatment,

he vas placed on a very strict diet, and adviaed to stop drinking.

Preseatly,

Sonora la following the diet raligiously; he cakes a sugar subatitute

vich his coffoa; and has draatically curtalled his drinking. Apparencly

the diet has been successful, for Somoza has lost much weight.

20

In February 1966, I Vialted Nicaragus and called on General Somoza on a

business matter.

He appeared healty, strong and was in jovial spiritu.

Ho discussed polition; and his presidential candidacy for next years elica

ELons. He la confident about che outcome of the electiona; there is no

doisbt In his mind that he will bs the next President of Nicaragua.

3. In my opinion, behind the confidence and optimism in the nagging fact

that the somoza nama 10 autcantically. Identified vith dictatorshipa. He

would like to change the lmage the Somoza name has creates. throughout

LATIN AMALICE.

This to his real motivation in seeking the presidency, and

abardoning the dircetorehip us the National Guerd. He refoices in the

fact that President Shick, a duly elected pitaldent, kill serge his Eul:

cerm and will be succeeded by another elected president.

Somoza has all

Istentiona of atapping anide at the end of his term in favor if the then

elected president.

He desires the somoza name 'to ba dynorgis of prosparity,

stability and denocracy in Nicarague.
