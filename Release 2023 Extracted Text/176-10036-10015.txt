5. AT PRESENT THERE ARE 135 FULL TIME PROFESSIONAL MERCENARIES
OF WHICH THE FRENCH CONTINGENT INCLUDING FORMER OAS TERRORISTS:
FROM ALGERIA IS NUMERICALLY THE LARGEST FOLLOWED BY SOUTH AFRICANS
AND BELGIANS.
IN ADDITION THERE ARE MANY BELGIAN COLONS AND..
BUSINESSMEN WHO SERVE ON A PART TIME BASIS WITH BONAFIDE MERCENARIES
(FIELD COMMENT: ACE 673 REPORTED A MAXIMUM OF 350 MERCENARIES.
A EUROPEAN BUSINESSMAN (B) ON 31 JULY QUOTED A SENIOR BELGIAN
INTELLIGENCE OFFICER IN ELISABETHVILLE WHO HAS EXTENSIVE CONTACTS

ACTUAL OR OSTENSIBLE CIVILIAN OCCUPATIONS BUT SERVE PART TIME OR

MISSIONS" (FIELD COMMENT: ACE 673 REPORTED THEIR REGULAR MONTHLY
SALARIES TO BE 50.000 ΤΟ 100.000 FRANCS PAID BOTH IN LOCAL AND
FOREIGN CURRENCY). POINTS OF MAJOR MERCENARY CONCENTRATIONS ARE
THE KIPUSHI. ELISABETHVILLE, KAMBOVE, KOLWEZI, KABONGO AND KONGOLO
-AREAS. SEVERAL ARE ALSO HIDDEN IN THE BUSH AROUND THE UN-HELD
TOWN OF NYUNZU IN NORTH KATANGA (FIELD COMMENT: APPR. 6). THIS
DISTRIBUTION IS GENERAL AS THEY ARE CONSTANTLY MOVING ABOUT IN
SMALL MOBILE UNITS AND SHIFTING THEIR BASE LOCATIONS. A FRENCH
OFFICER, FNU BARON, WHO FORMERLY SERVED IN INDOCHINA BUT NEVER
IN ALGERIA, HAS BEEN GIVEN OVERALL COMMAND OF MERCENARIES.
:
ALTHOUGH
HIS HEADQUARTERS IS IN KIPUSHI, HE IS NOW SPENDING MOST OF HIS TIME
TRAVELLING ABOUT KATANGA INSPECTING HIS COLLEAGUES AND TRYING TO
CONSOLIDATE HIS COMMAND STATUS (FIELD COMMENT: ACE 673 REPORTED
A FRENCH COLONEL GARDY, WHO MAY ACTUALLY BE THE SAME MAN AS
"BARON", HAD BEEN PROPOSED FOR THIS FUNCTION. DUE TO THE BITTER
JEALOUSIES BETWEEN THE VARIOUS NATIONAL GROUPS, IT IS NOT SURPRISING
THAT THE "COMMANDER" MUST GIVE HIS ATTENTION TO PERSUADING HIS
COLLEAGUES TO ACCEPT HIM AS THEIR LEADER). JOSEPH SMAL, BELGIAN
PROPRIETOR OF THE "BONNE AUBERGE" IN KOLWEZI USES HIS HOTEL AS A
COORDINATION CENTER FOR MERCENARIES. HE STORES A LARGE QUANTITY
OF ARMS THERE FOR THEIR USE. FOR RECOGNITION PURPOSES WHEN
GREETING MERCENARIES SENT TO CONTACT HIM, HE KEEPS IN A CLOSED

FRAME INSIDE THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE HOTEL BAR A PICTURE OF HIMSELF
DRESSED IN MERCENARY UNIFORM HOLDING A BOMB NEXT TO A KATANGA
MILITARY AIRCRAFT. ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE BAR HE KEEPS A PICTURE
OF BARON. MORALE AMONG TRUE MERCENARIES AND EUROPEAN VOLUNTEERS IS
CURRENTLY HIGH: THEY SUPPORT TSHOMBE WITH NO RESERVATIONS AND ARE
CONFIDENT THEY CAN SUCCESSFULLY DEFEND KATANGA AGAINST UN OR CNA
ATTACK.
:
6. THE PRESENT ACCENT WITHIN THE KATANGA AIR FORCE (KAF) IS ON
TACTICAL USE OF PREDOMINANTLY SMALL AIRCRAFT. KAF STRATEGISTS
...
:
VIEW JET AIRCRAFT AS TOO FAST FOR A SMALL COUNTRY LIKE KATANGA;
ALSO KATANGA CAN NEVER HOPE TO MATCH JETS AVAILABLE TO THE UN WHICH
CAN APPEAL TO THE WHOLE WORLD FOR REINFORCEMENTS IN EVENT ITS
SUPERIORITY IN NUMBERS WAS CHALLENGED. THE KAF VIEWS ITS EXPERIENCE
WITH SMALL AIRCRAFT DURING THE DECEMBER FIGHTING AS USEFUL; IT
WAS ABLE TO DROP SMALL BOMBS EFFECTIVELY FROM LOW ALTITUDES AND
OUTMANEUVER UN JETS. THE KAF PRESENTLY HAS THREE DOVES AND IS
TRYING TO GET MORE (FIELD COMMENT: ACE 673 ALSO REPORTED TWO OR
MORE DE HAVILLAND DOVE TWIN-ENGINE UTILITY TRANSPORTS AVAILABLE TO
:
:
THE KAF). IT IS ALSO TRYING TO ACQUIRE MORE SMALL PLANES. PAUL
GIRON, AN EX-BELGIAN AIR FORCE OFFICER AGED 55 AND MARRIED TO A
BRITISHER, IS NOW IN KOLWEZI AND PLANS TO REMAIN THERE UNTIL
OCTOBER ACTING AS AGENT/EXPEDITOR FOR AIRCRAFT PURCHASES AND

DELIVERIES. AIRCRAFT ARE STAGED AND OPERATED FROM THE KIPUSHI AND
KOLWEZI AIRPORTS; THE KAF ALSO DEPENDS HEAVILY ON USE OF NUMEROUS
SMALL GRAVEL AND SAND-SURFACED AIRSTRIPS LOCATED IN THE BUSH
THROUGHOUT KATANGA. IT DEPENDS PRIMARILY ON THE UNION MINTERE DU
HAUT KATANGA (UMHK) WORKSHOPS AT JADOTVILLE TO FABRICATE, REPAIR
OR INSTALL AIRCRAFT SPARE PARTS. THE KAF NOW EMPLOYS 11 MERCENARIES
AS PILOT PERSONNEL. MOST ARE BRITISH OR SOUTH AFRICANS.PLUS.
TWO CANADIANS AND ARE BASED AT KOLWEZI. MOST PREVIOUSLY SERVED WITH
THE RAF MANY IN SUDAN, UGANDA OR KENYA. TWO SUCH ARE JAMES W..
HEDGES, A BRITISHER NOWIN KOLWEZI. AND PETER WICKSTEED, BORN IN
BRITAIN OF SOUTH AFRICAN PARENTS, WHO GIVES HIS ADDRESSES AS B. P. O.,
KOLWEZI AND POSTE RESTANTE (GENERAL DELIVERY), KIPUSHI.
ON OR ABOUT 10 JULY ALL MERCENARY PILOTS NOTIFIED THE GOK OF THEIR
REFUSAL TO RECOGNIZE BARON AS THEIR COMMANDER OR OBEY HIS ORDERS.
THEY EXPLAINED ENGLISHMEN CANNOT WORK UNDER FRENCH COMMAND. THE
KAF HAS ALLOWED THEM TO FORM THEIR OWN COMMAND OUTSIDE BARON'S
JURISDICTION.
7. PRACTICAL OPERATION OF ARMY TACTICAL SIGNALS FACILITIES
IS UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF MERCENARIES ALTHOUGH SENIOR AFRICAN
OFFICERS ARE NOMINALLY IN COMMAND... ALL ARMY UNITS ARE EQUIPPED
WITH "SAYT" WIRELESS RADIOS (FIELD COMMENT: APPR. 6 ). ONE SAYT
INSTALLATION WAS OBSERVED IN THE ARMY TRAINING CAMP NEAR KOLWEZI;

ANOTHER IS INSTALLED IN AN AMBULANCE EQUIPPED WITH A LARGE AERIAL
JUST OUTSIDE KIPUSHI. AFRICAN SOLDIERS WERE OPERATING BOTH. THE
DEFENSE MINISTRY HOPES TO BE ABLE IN CASE OF HOSTILITIES TO MAKE
USE OF KATANGA CIVIL AND UMHK TELECOMMUNICATIONS FACILITIES BUT
EXPECTS THE UN WILL IMMEDIATELY CAPTURE OR RENDER THESE USELESS AS
A PRIME MILITARY OBJECTIVE. THE MINISTRY HOWEVER IS COUNTING
HEAVILY ON UMHK WIRELESS AND SIGNALS COOPERATION OUTSIDE ELISABETH-
VILLE IN AREAS NOT CONTROLLED BY THE UN. A STRONG INTERNATIONAL
WIRELESS FACILITY HAS BEEN INSTALLED IN KOLWEZI: IT IS IN DIRECT
STRONG CONTACT WITH KATANGA REPRESENTATIVES IN BRAZZAVILLE AND WILL
BE USED AS THE GOK'S MAIN POINT. OF CONTACT WITH THE OUTSIDE WORLD.
8. ARMY STRATEGISTS BELIEVE THE RHODESIAN AND SOUTH AFRICAN
GOVERNMENTS WISH TO HELP KATANGA MILITARILY BUT ARE UNABLE TO DO
SO OPENLY AND DIRECTLY. THEREFORE THE ARMY, WITH GOK COOPERATION.
IS SEEKING BUSINESSMEN FROM THOSE COUNTRIES WHO CAN SETTLE
TEMPORARILY IN KATANGA AND ACT AS INTERMEDIARIES IN BUYING AND
SELLING MILITARY ITEMS AS THEIR OWN PROPERTY. GIRON IS THIS TYPE
OF AGENT. THE ARMY HOPES TO OBTAIN ARMS, AMMUNITION AND AIRCRAFT
FROM RHODESIA AND SOUTH AFRICA THROUGH THESE BUSINESS REPRESENTATIVES.
9. THE UMHK PROGRAM FOR PROTECTING THE PHYSICAL SECURITY OF
ITS INSTALLATIONS HAS OVERT AND COVERT ASPECTS. UNIFORMED AFRICAN
SECURITY GUARDS EMPLOYED BY THE COMPANY AND SUPERVISED BY EUROPEAN
EMPLOYEES PROVIDE DAY TO DAY PROTECTION UNDER "PEACE TIME" CIRCUM-

UMHK ALSO HAS A SECRET STOCK OF LIGHT POWERFUL DEFENSIVE
ARMS WITH AMMUNITION WHICH IT PLANS TO DISTRIBUTE TO ALL EUROPEAN
AND SELECTED AFRICAN EMPLOYEES WHO ARE WILLING TO FIGHT TO DEFEND
: COMPANY MINES AND PLANTS IN CASE GENERAL HOSTILITIES ARE RENEWED.

UMHK HAS NO PLANS FOR SABOTAGING ITS OWN PROPERTY. ON THE CONTRARY

EXPAND EXPLOITATION OF MINES AND PROCESSING FACILITIES: THE

COMPANY. HOPES TO INSTALL A NEW COPPER REFINERY IN KOLWEZI. UMHK
HAS ITS OWN PRIVATE VOICE, RADIO IN JADOTVILLE WHICH HAS STRONG

10. ON THE OTHER HAND ACCORDING TO MERCENARY SOURCES, THE
GOK PLANS TO DESTROY ELECTRICITY-PRODUCING DAMS INCLUDING DELCOMMUNE
AND LE MARINEL NORTH OF KOLWEZI IN CASE OF UN ATTACK OUTSIDE
ELISABETHVILLE. PREPARATIONS HAVE BEEN COMPLETED TO BLOW UP BOTH
IN CASE OF THIS CONTINGENCY. MERCENARIES, INDIVIDUALLY SELECTED
BY INTERIOR MINISTER GODEFROID MUNONGO, ARE PREPARED AT HIS
PERSONAL ORDER ONLY TO IMMEDIATELY FIRST BLOW UP. THE UPPER DAM
WHICH WILL RELEASE A FLOOD OF WATER STRONG ENOUGH TO ALSO DESTROY
THE OTHER DAM IN CASE IT IS NOT ALSO BLOWN. THE GOK REASONS. THAT
DAMS WILL BE REBUILT FAR FASTER (WITHIN AN ESTIMATED 4 YEARS) THAN
CAN UMHK MINES AND PLANTS: IF LATTER WERE SABOTAGED IT WOULD TAKE
MANY MORE YEARS TO REBUILD KATANGA'S ECONOMY. BECAUSE IT SERIOUSLY

INTENDS TO IMPLEMENT THIS PLAN IF IT FEELS FORCED TO DO SO, THE GOK
SEES NO NEED AND SO HAS NOT PLACED GUARDS ON THE DAMS. MERCENARIES
PRIVATELY ASSERT THEY COULD ALSO EASILY DESTROY ALL UMHK MINES
DESPITE UMHK OBJECTIONS. HOWEVER THEY AGREE WITH THE WISDOM OF THE
GOK PLAN BECAUSE THEY HOPE TO EVENTUALLY BE ABLE TO NEGOTIATE A PEACE
SETTLEMENT WITH THE UN AND REALIZE THAT THEY WOULD HAVE LITTLE
WITH WHICH TO BARGAIN WERE UMHK ASSETS GONE.
11. ACCORDING TO A DEFENSE MINISTRY OFFICIAL, ARMY TACTICS
IN TIME OF HOT WAR WITH THE UN WILL BE TO FORGET ABOUT ELISABETH-
VILLE WHICH IT DOES NOT WISH DESTROYED AND WHICH IS DIFFICULT TO
DEFEND. INSTEAD ALL ROADS AND BRIDGES OUTSIDE THE CAPITAL WILL BE
DESTROYED. THEY HAVE ALREADY BEEN MINED AND CAN BE QUICKLY BLOWN
UP. THE ACCENT IN ALL ARMY TRAINING SCHOOLS IS ON MAQUIS WARFARE
AND GUERRILLA TACTICS. ARMY LEADERS ARE CONFIDENT THEIR TROOPS
FIGHTING FROM THE BUSH, FROM AMBUSHES AND FROM EVERY TREE TOP, CAN
ACTUALLY DESTROY UN FORCES WITHIN A SHORT TIME SHOULD LATTER COME
OUTSIDE OF ELISABETHVILLE. THE ARMY IS ALSO PREPARING ITSELF FOR
A LONG WAR IN CASE THE UN CHOOSES TO REMAIN IN STRENGTH INSIDE
ELISABETHVILLE. KATANGA TROOPS HAVE BEEN DEPLOYED SO AS TO
COMPLETELY SURROUND THE UN CITY DEFENSE PERIMETER. THE ARMY ALSO
CONSIDERS LUENA AN. IMPORTANT STRATEGIC POINT FROM WHICH TO LAUNCH
