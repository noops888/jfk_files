Objections to Mr. David Phillips' Manuscript

1. The general tenor of the manuscript leaves much to be desired

from both an operational and security viewpoint. The author in numer-

reviewed portions of the manuscript pertinent to their areas have

conmented negatively on the revelations of tradecraft and identifica-

tion of numerous overseas Stations and operations.

2. Other objectionable items in the manuscript concern the con-

firmation of Agee's effectiveness in neutralizing Agency efforts abroad

by publishing lists of CIA personnel in specifif Stations; revelation

)personnel in

the

Agency role in countering terrorism, narcotics trafficking and training

provided other services to counteract these activities; and, the

specific identity of liaison relationships, particularly, the Israeli 24

service.)

3. The overall concensus of this Division is that publication of

this manuscript in its present form would be detrimental to the Agency

and this Division in

particular.
