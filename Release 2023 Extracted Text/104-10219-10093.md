Subject wis never irvolved in any dissideri activities in the

Soviet Union.

Sie had no interest in unerground literature (samiedat)

und nover rezd ar, nor dia che cler read dussian lanquage cocks

It is unlikely Subject would have read such raterial

or participated in dissident activities even had she had the charce to do

so, as Subject and her husbard disdained the efforts of the Soviet

dissidents as foolish and pointless.

Subject herself has only a secondan

aiucation and limited mentality. She is not interested in ideological

It is highly doubtful Subject

read much of anything, forbidden or otherwise.

various ninority rationalities of the Soviet Union and tends to lump

certain of then together under convenient generic terms, such as

"Siriytsy'' (Syriars) for Soviets of Turkic or other loslen nationality

Subject has no interest in the plight of cirority rationalities

in the LeSSR.

She recognized it was her Jewish ancestry which ralped

her to migrate legally from the USSR, but that is as far as it went.
