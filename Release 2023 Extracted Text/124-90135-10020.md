1.

This Agency is recently in receipt of information on

Subject and on Cuban activities in the United States which

might be of interest to the Bureau.

It is as follows:

"There are m√∂re Fidelistas here than in Cuba.

There are a great number of individuals infiltrated

into the counter-revolutionary circles. They are col-

lecting money to send to the Cuban Government. I

understand that they are very active in all fields.

"Menoyo's men are undesirable. GUTIERREZ. Menoyo

came to New York (no date given), apparently on the

express orders of Fidel. Almost all of them were G-2

agents, which they were in Cuba; and it is known that

Menoyo has had a series of meetings with Spanish

republican elements to see how he can get his hand

in Spain. Almost all of these republicans are Communists.

"In Miami, there are also many people working on

behalf of the Communists, above all' the women.

The material above was sourced by a Spanish service. 5)
