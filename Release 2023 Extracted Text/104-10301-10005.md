ORGANIZATION OF THE OFFICE OF THE DIRECTOR

Introduction

1. This Notice outlines the organization and functioning of the

Office of the Director, the responsibilities of its personnel, and the

handling of communications in and with that Office. The term Office of

the Director includes the immediate offices of the DCI, the DDCI, the

Executive Director, and all Assistants to the Director. The Office of

the Director will be able to provide prompt policy guidance, assistance

and responses to the needs of the operating components of the Agency if

procedures detailed in this Notice are followed.

-

Individual Responsibilities

2. The responsibilities of the DCI and the DDCI were set forth by

the President in a letter to the Director, dated 16 January 1962, which

is quoted in part as follows:

"... it is my wish that you serve as the Government's principal

foreign intelligence officer, and as such that you undertake, as an

integral part of your responsibility, the coordination and effective

guidance of the total United States foreign intelligence effort. As the

Government's principal intelligence officer, you will assure the

proper coordination, correlation, and evaluation of intelligence from

all sources and its prompt dissemination to me and to other recipients

as appropriate. In fulfillment of these tasks I shall expect you to

work closely with the heads of all departments and agencies having

responsibilities in the foreign intelligence field.

"In coordinating and guiding the total intelligence effort, you will

serve as Chairman of the United States Intelligence Board, with a

view to assuring the efficient and effective operation of the Board and

its associated bodies. In this connection I note with approval that you

have designated your deputy to serve as a member of the Board,

thereby bringing to the Board's deliberations the relevant facts and

judgments of the Central Intelligence Agency.

"As directed by the President and the National Security

Council, you will establish with the advice and assistance of the

United States Intelligence Board the necessary policies and pro-

cedures to assure adequate coordination of foreign intelligence

activities at all levels.

"With the heads of the Departments and Agencies concerned

you will maintain a continuing review oi the programs and activities

of all U.S. agencies engaged in foreign intelligence activities with a

view to assuring efficiency and effectiveness and to avoiding

undesirable duplication.

"As head of the Central Intelligence Agency, while you will

continue to have over-all responsibility for the Agency, I shall

expect you to delegate to your principal deputy, as you may deem

necessary, so much of the direction of the detailed operation of the

Agency as may be required to permit you to carry out your primary

task as Director of Central Intelligence. "

3. The Deputy Director of Central Intelligence directs the detailed

operations of the Central Intelligence Agency, as well as being the CLA

member of the USIB as indicated above. Statutory authorities of the

Director have been delegated by him to the Deputy Director. In the DCI's

absence, the DDCI is Acting Director of Central Intelligence and Acting

Chairman of the USIB, and represents the DCI on all of the inter-agency

boards and groups on which the Director sits.

4. The Executive Director is responsible for over-all management of

the Agency and of the Office of the Director. He is charged with ensuring

necessary action by the proper component on decisions of the DCI and

DDCI, with responsibility for overseeing internal management, and for

ensuring coordination of component activities. It is the Executive Director's

responsibility to ensure that Agency components are kept advised of all

policy decisions or intra-governmental actions affecting them. All papers

reguiring action on the part of either the Director or Deputy Director will

be routed through the Executive Director. The Executive Director, as the

"Chief of Staff" of the Agency, acts for or in the absence of the DCI and

DDCI in exercising his directive and approval authority.

5. The Executive Assistant to the Director is responsible for prepar-

ing briefing papers and books for meetings attended by the DCI such as

the Special Group, the National Security Council, Committee of Principals

and the NSC Standing Group, and for advising the Executive Director of

the need for action, as may be required by deliberations of these or other

groups. He is responsible for keeping the Director and the DDCI advised

on a 24-hour basis of all informational and intelligence developments.

6. The Assistant to the Director (Historical Staff) is responsible

for review and coordination of Agency relations with the press and other

public media, and of matters which might involve the public disclosure

or acknowledgment of any ClA activity, employee or publication. His

responsibility applies particularly to all contacts with members of the

press, and to requests by Agency personnel to engage in writing for

external publication or to give talks outside the Agency.

7. The Assistant for Coordination provides advice and assistance

concerning the coordination of foreign intelligence activities within the

intelligence community, and Agency relationships with other intelligence

agencies. Papers dealing with such matters will be routed by the

Executive Registry to the Office of the Assistant for Coordination prior to

action by the DCI or DDCI.

8. The Executive Secretary, United States Intelligence Board, is

responsible for direction of the USIB Secretariat and for assisting the DCI

in his capacity as Chairman of USIB. All matters for USIB action will be

routed by the Executive Registry to the USIB Executive Secretary.

9. The Cable Secretary is responsible on an Agency-wide basis for

the release and distribution of cables.

10. The Executive Registry is the central document file for the Office

of the Director and its Chief is responsible for the control and location

of all papers throughout the Office. The Registry is compartmented for

reasons of security to ensure proper handling of papers of all classifica-

tions and degrees of sensitivity. Any question concerning the clearances

of personnel to handle special classifications should be taken up with the

Chief of the Registry. All papers moving into and out of the Office of the

Director, whatever their classification, will be sent initially to the

Executive Registry for appropriate logging and so that control can be

exercised over their location.

Consequently, papers should not be hand-

carried to any individual in the Director's Office but should be taken

directly to the Executive Registry. The Registry will ensure expeditious

handling with the precedence desired. The point is emphasized that

papers which are not processed in this manner may possibly be lost, or

create security problems.

11. The Administrative Officer is responsible for administrative

matters affecting the immediate Office of the Director. These include,

but are not limited to, such items as personnel actions, fiscal and budget

matters, travel, logistical support, space arrangements, etc. All

matters of such a nature will be coordinated through the office of the

Administrative Officer.
