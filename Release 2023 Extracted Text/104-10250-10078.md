MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT

: Herman

Kimsey

1. On 23 July, Mrs. (Thea

Hall) advised the following

regarding her call from Mr. Kimsey. Mr. Kimsey did not direct-

ly question her on activities of individuals within the

Questioned Documents Section of TSD. She, however, had as

Strong impression that he was well informed on what was

going on

on a rather current basis. He appeared to be'aware

that Mrs. (Hall had changed her location of employment.

As he

has done in the past, he indicated that he knew that Lon Thomas

was not working hard and for all intents and purposes was not

doing his job. He indicated that Jan Beck was overworked

because he had to carry most of the load in QDS and that

he might be considering getting another job. Kimsey appeared

to be concerned regarding this, as he had predicted it in the

past, and he felt that if this happened, the QDS capability

would be lost to TSD and the Agency

Kimsey considers him-

self responsible for all the good work involved in the estab-

lishment of the QDS capability in TSD. Kimsey further reitera-

ted that desk officers within TSD had advised him that there

is no respect for QDS in TSD, that work they sent to QDS to be

done usually was not done in time, thus in decision making they

In addition, Kimsey stated that he had talked to people return-

ing

from Okinawa who said that at the time of Lon Thomas's

TDY to Okie about a year ago, Thomas didn't do any work and

would not handle their problems.

2. Kimsey talked at length about his work, reiterating

that he was in charge of security for Goldwater's eampaign

during his campaign. He claimed that he has recently been

asked to handle security requirements for Martin Luther King's

forthcoming trip to Washington, and that when the job was

offered

he was advised that four additional people would be required,

and that he would be paid $10 a hour for his services. He

indicated that he declined this job offer because he felt that

some people around. Dr. King were interested in other causes.

Kimsey advised that he was currently involved in selling

electronic alarm systems, that they have a contract to install

such a system in the new

Kuwait Embassy on Connecticut Avenue.

Mrs. (Hall indicated that he was not doing this on his own,

but had a friend whom into in with him. Kimsey inferred

that he also had a prospect for a similar job with the Belgian.

Embassy. Kimsey went on to say that he has close contacts with

ador

the UAR Embasst in Washington. He described the

Embassador as

being a journalist by profession and that both he and his wife

were born in Palistine. Kimsey apparently discussed the

dichotomy of this but inferred that it was pretty common knowledge

and the subject of some joking around town.

3. Kimsey continues to be deeply involved in the

Goleniewski case which was publicised in the Washington Daily

anuary

News on 19 June 1965. He still thinks that this man is the

son of Czar Nicholas II, and that none of this family died

in the Bolshevik massacre as reported at the time. At this

point, he indicated that he continues to work closely with the

security people at Langley seeing them every few days on

this matter. In addition, he stated that he had close liaison

with the FBI. Kimsey said that a translation of some papers

connected with the Anastasia case will soon be published in

California, and that these papers make no reference to the

fact that

members of his family were killed in 1918. Eugenia

Smith, who claims to be Anastasia, a woman now in her middle

60's, was said to be suing Speller & Co. over publishing of

the Anastasia book. Kimsey inferred that Eugenia Smith is a

nymphomaniac, has a daughter and

a granddaughter who are living

behind the Iron Curtain, and who are blackmailing her not to

accept the identity of Anastasia. He further inferred that

she has travelled quite a number of times to Europe and that

recently she has had difficulty with the immigration authorities

who might deport her. Her trial is due to come up in October. i

4. A questioning of Mrs. (Hall) regarding her assessment

of the personal characteristics and stability of Kimsey reflects

the following. Mrs. (Hall said that Kimsey, while an Agency

employee, had psychiatric problems

and at one time had been

seeing a psychiatrist.

She does not know further details

regarding this. When he left the Agency (701), he was

visibly shaken and upset, however, his basic pride and

personality prevented him from showing outward agony

by

the decision. He instead covered up/his many references

to the many other jobs that he had been offered to him in

the Agency or made references to the fact that he was not

leaving at all, but would be working as a consultant on

some of the more important Agency problems. Mrs.

(Ha11) indi-

cates that she considers him to be a paranoiac. He however

alleges that he has strong loyalties to the Agency and tries

to always continue the facade that he is current on matters

relating to the Agency and is importantly involved in Agency

activities. He continues to live at

vAN Hotel in Washington,

basically a very lonely person.
