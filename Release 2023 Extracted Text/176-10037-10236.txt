IL-28s in Cuba
Fuselage crates for nine
IL-28 (Beagle) jet bombers were
identified on 4 November at
Holguin airfield in Oriente
Province.
These are almost certainly
the IL-28 crates observed on the
Soviet vessel Leninsky Komsomol
before it docked at a Cuban port
near Holguin on 20 October. To-
gether with IL-28s previously
seen at San Julian, they raise
to 42 the number of IL-28s and
IL-28 fuselage crates observed
in Cuba.
There is no evidence that
preparations are under way to
withdraw the IL-28s despite
Khrushchev's statement to
President Kennedy on 28 October
that the USSR will send back
to the Soviet Union "those
weapons you call offensive."
Early this year work was
begun on lengthening the run-
ways at Holguin airfield and
building covered aircraft re-
vetments there. Work was ap-
parently completed in July, but
the airfield had been used very
little if at all untiltnow. The
16 covered revetments at Holguin
airfield are apparently similar
to those used by MIG fighters
at three other Cuban military
airfields.
Recent photography in-
dicates that more than 100 Soviet
helicopters have been shipped to
Cuba so far. About 75 percent:
of these have arrived since the
start of the intensive military
build-up last July. Many of
them are still in crates at an
assembly area located at Playa
Baracoa airfield west of Ha-
vana. They will enhance con-
siderably Castro's capabilities
to cope with antigovernment in-
surgents. (SECRET NO FOREIGN
