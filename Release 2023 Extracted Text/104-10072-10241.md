* Carios Antonio Caryasco, the National Director for

Education Planning, (visited WUSLAB/1/ on 9/April 1970.

Carrasco

claimed that the Bolivian government is in a period of stalemate.

There is progress being made in only two fields. One of these

is planning and the other is education. The Minister of Education

Mariano Baptista has more power than

some of the other ministers.

The education budget has been increased, and he has some say

in the selection of the Ministry of Education's personnel.

Even

though the military blocked appointments for Maria Elba Gutierrez

and Professor Chavez they are still in the ministry; Chavez in

the

"Instituto Normal" and Maria Elba

as Secretary General of

the Ministry (the third ranking post in the ministry.) Baptista

has good relations with the United States which is helping the

education program.

The cabinet seems

to be rather stable at

the moment, although there continues to be pressure to remove

Rolon Anaya and Marcelo Quiroga.

The latter is a candidate to

replace Juan Lechin Oquendo as the secretary general of the

union organization.

The strongest military man in the govern-

ment from the standpoint of firmness is Edmundo Valencia, the

Minister of National Economy.

5.

The civilian cabinet members believe that the United

States is happy with them.

They think that the military are

incapable of running the government. There has been no in-

dication of a Sendle among the cabinet members. There is also

a freeze on Bolivian-US relations. The military continues to

be worried because there is not a political party behind the

government.

Some of the civilians wanted to gain the

support

of the MN, but the military did not want to do that.

6.

Carrasco gave one example of the military-civilian

interplay:

The Minister of Education Baptista wanted the education

bill signed on 9 April 1970 which is the anniversary of the 1952

revolution.

Valencia opposed it because it was the anniversary.

Colonel Juan Ayoroa continues to be opposed to the return of MNR

people to the government.

7. Hernan Siles when he was in Bolivia saw Losada, Baptista,

and twice saw Ovando. The reason for his removal from the

country is as follows: Arellano denounced Siles to General

Torres and gave him some written material on a plot. Torres

then announced that there was a plot set for 9 April. Colonel

Ayora called Siles.

in and said that he had to leave Bolivia

within four days.

The government wanted him out of the country

on 9 April. Ayoroa told Siles that he could return to Bolivia

on 10 April.

Carrasco received the above story from Siles to

whom he talked many times..

Ovando believes that Siles is no

longer interested in governmental power.

He is interested in

the MR, and he does want to destroy the political power of

While in Bolivia Siles aflienated Serate-

Reich, Arellano, etc.

Victor Paz Estenssoro ciles attributes to Arellano his betrayal

to the government.

8. Nothing has happened on Paz's negotiations with the

government.

9. The arrival of the Soviet Ambassador has produced good

consequences

according

• to Carrasco. Relations are smoother

with the American ambassador. The Bolivians feel freer to be

more friendly knowing there is someone else to turn to. The

Soviet presence is a sop to placate the left in Bolivia. It

serves as a substitute for the lack of leftist participation

in the government.

Ovando may use the Soviets as the need

arises, just as be will try and use the Americans.

10. Ovando and Torres wanted to expelf a Colonel Limay

who is a very right-wing government employee.

The military

opposed it and he is still in his job.

Ovando has been thinking

of a constituent assembly as a device to legalize his government.

He very much wants a legal presidency.

11. Plans: (WUSLAB/1 will be returning to limited office

work the week of l13 April

I promised to call him during the

week. (A cable was sent on the Viera information on 10 April.)
