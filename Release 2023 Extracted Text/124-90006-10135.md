investigations, advised that a former employee of a

Cuban Ministry, who is now in the United States, and

who is described by MM T-1 as reliable, furnished in-

formation which originated with [rOMAS CABANAS BATISTA JES

a Cuban exile. (55)X)

The information concerned activities

about a group which was represented by PAULINO A. SIERRA.

SIERRA was a Cuban exile opposed to the present government-

of FIDEL CASTRO RUZ, Cuban Premier. According to the

source, the SIERRA group was gathering forces for opera-

tions against FIDEL CASTRO. SIERRA, in a meeting in

Coral Gables, Florida, in September, 1963, said that

American businessmen had offered money to help defray

expenses of the group, but that no operations would be

conducted from American 8011(54)CA(4)

Among those at the meeting and associated

with the group, was FELIPE RIVERO, who had been connected

with the attempted invasion of Cuba in April, 1961, which

operation was known as the "Bay of Pigs Invasion."

At the

meeting, CABANAS reportedly stated that SIERRA had named

GILBERTO RODRIGUEZ, Also known as Captain LEON, to be the

commander of the military forces of the SIERRA-associated

group. RODRIGUEZ was described as a naturalized U. S.

citizen, and as having been arrested by the CASIRO govern-

ment and sentenced to a long term. He was freed in 1963

through the intervention of American lawyer JAMES B. DONOVAN

On October 31, 1963, GILBERTO RODRIGUEZ

FERNANDEZ, 620 N. W. 69th Stseet, Miami, Florida, furnished

the following information to SA ROBERT JAMES DWYER:
