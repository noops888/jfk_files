(Unclassified - MDC) LIAISON Went to the House Select

Committee on Assassinations to review security procedures with Office of

Security representatives (ary Steelejand Bob Hayes as well as House

Select Committee on Assassinations staffers. Procedures were reviewed

and confirmed and the Committee was provided with the documents which

they had requested, the same being stored in the manner prescribed by

Rodger Gabrielson. After review of the material, it was discovered

that some of the materials requested by the Committee were missing.

I returned to Headquarters, picked up the new materials and delivered

them to the Committee that night. They were grateful.

8. (Unclassified - RLB) LEGISLATION Spoke with the following

persons regarding financial disclosure legislation: Ms. Sarah Luna and

Mr. William Bergen, Legislative Assistants to Representative Romano

Mazzoli (D., Ky.), and Mr. Gary Fay, Legislative Assistant to

Representative Don Edwards (D., Calif.). (See Memorandum for the

Record.)

9. (Unclassified - RLB) LEGISLATION Spoke with Susan Geiger,

OMB, regarding the financial disclosure legislation. Ms. Geiger said

that Mr. Cy. Lazarus, who was heading the White House "team" on the

legislation, would be talking with the Speaker of the House shortly. I

told Ms. Geiger we had nothing new and were awaiting word from

Representative Romano Mazzoli (D., Md.) as to whether he would be

able to support compromise language which we had provided his staff

several days ago. She suggested we check with Representative Don Edwards

(D., Calif. ) to see if he would propose our language as a compromise in

response to the objections Congressman Mazzoli had already raised

regarding the legislation. I told Ms. Geiger that Representative Edwards'

Legislative Assistant, Mr. Gary Fay, had been present at the recent

meeting we had with Representative Mazzoli's staff and that we certainly

would consider her suggestion. Later in the day, Ms. Geiger called to

inform us that the financial disclosure legislation had been pulled off the

calendar because of controversy over the proposed amendment that would

strike the existing limitation on outside income for Representatives.
