MEMORANDUM FOR: Chairman, Clandestine Services Career

Service Board (Panel A)

SUBJECT

: Joseph B. Smith - Recommendation for

Promotion from GS-14 to GS-15

1. Mr. Smith joined the Headquarters Training Branch of the

OTR Operations School in October 1966 speciacally to assume respon-

sibility for Covert Action training.

He speni the first few months in

a thorough study and review of all CA courses previously given in OTR.

This was a long and complicated job, compourded in part by the public

compromise of a wide range of Agency CA activities. In closest coordi:

nation with the CA Staff, Mr. Smith devised a cotally new and different

CA curriculum, consisting of twu short seminars for middle and senior

grade officers -- one called a Corert Aclien Querations Seminar and

one a Politica Workshop. These seminars, emphasizing the integrated

nature of GS operations, have evoked a very positive response, cou-

firming the soundness of Mir. Smith's creatire efforts in revamping

CA training in this fashion.

2.

As a corollary to the main duties citad abore, Mr. Smith has

aiso successfully run, in conjunction with FE Division, a Psychological

Warfare Operations Course for military officers being assigned to

MACV/SOG in Saigon, Finally, in the CA dela, Air. Sinith has pro-

vided tutorials, as requested by various ares Divisions, to a number

of Stall and Contract Arents and to forcio liaison repricentatiers in

such fieldo as

organisations,

and mothods of countering Communist propaganda.

3. In February 1965 Mr. Smith was astru do asgune respon-

sibility as Tradecrait Advisor and Coordinator lor the Operationa

Support Courae, a critical block of instruction fur (primarily joung

and inexperienced) CS clericals headed for overseas assignments

where they may be called upon to assiat case officers in operational.

support tasks. Although; strictly speaking, this teaching and coordi-.

nation task wäs outside Mr. Snith's normal purview and main area

of expertise, he accepted this additional responsisility with exemplary

willingness, and then proceeded to discharge it smoothly, energetically,

and effectively. • In addition to managing an extensive live problem, the

Tradecraft Advisor must ensure that presentations by a number of

instructors result in a balanced and coherent coverage of all operational

subjects in the course. This entails the coordination of cíforts of

several senior and experienced instructors, all under the nominal aegis

of the course's Chief Instructor, and, thus, demands a great deal of

finesse and tact. Mr. Smith has not only fulfilled this difficult role in

a highly efficient manner but has alac drawn on his own long field

experience for pertinent and meaningful contributions to the course..

40

During Mr. Smith's tour with OTR, he was requested to

participate as a member of a Survey Team in a review of the effective-

ness of the Propaganda Group of the CA Staff. In a 30 June 1967

memorandum of appreciation to the Director of Training, Chief, CA

Staff commented as follows on Mr. Smith's work:

"Throughout Mr. Smith participated in a most

effective professional manner bringing to bear

his extensive background in the Ciandestine

Services.

Mis direct and objective approach

to the problems congidered in the course of

the survey made his contribution to the over-

all Team effort invaluable. The Team report,

which I am still in the process of discussing

within the Staff, will be of considerable value

not only to this Staff in our future planning but

also, I feel, to the future posture of the covert

propaganda mission of the Clandestine Services;

thus, I heartily commend Mr. Smith for hia

effective participation witti the Survey Team

in this effort. "

5.. In his last two fitness reporto Mr. Smith has received a

"Strong" rating and the Chief of the Operations School as reviewing

official has added his opinion that Mr. Smith has done his job with

distinction and with credit to himself and his career service, citing

the assignment to OTR-as a first-rate example of quality in rotational

tours. While Mr. Smith passed on his expertise through the training

proceas, he also enhanced his own versatility through involvement

in the various training activities cited abovo.

6. In récognition of the foregoing, it is felt that Mr. Smith

is qualified to carry out the duties of the GS-15 grade for which he

is recommended. Mi. Smich has been in grade 5 1/2 years.

Smith has worked under my nupervision on two occasions,

once in the Philippines and most recently in the Office of Training.

Both jubs were in the CA field where Smit is, I believe, one öf the

Agency's most experienced officers. My own view is that Smith

made an outstanding contriburion to Agency training, particularly

in CA, during his recent lour with OTR.

in design and content the new courses reflect thoughtfulnes?,

encountered.

As a corollary to the main duties cited above, Mr. Smith has also

successfully run; in conjunction with FE Division, a Psychological Warfare

Operations Course for military officers being assigned to MACV/SOG in

Saigon. Finally, in the CA field, Mr. Smith has provided tutorials, ag

In February 1968 Mr. Smith was asked to assume responsibility as

Tradecraft Advisor and Coordinator for the Operations Support Courso, a

critical block of instruction

Although, strictly

speaking, this teaching and coordination task was outside Mr. Smith's

normal. purview and main area of expertise, he accepted this additional

responsibility with exemplary willingness, and then proceeded to discharge

it smoothly, chergetically, and effectively. In addition to managing an

extensive live problem, the Tradecralt Advisor must ensure that prosen-

rations by a number of instructors

resull in a balanced and coherent coverage

uf all'operational subjects in the courge.

This entails the coordination of

cfíorts of several senior and experienced instructors, ill under tie nominal

aegis of the course's Chief Instructor, and, thue, demands a great deal of

finesse and tack. Mr. Smith has not only fulfilled this difficult role in a

highly efficient manner but has also drawn on his own long Field experience.

for pertinent and meaningiul contributions to the course.

Mi. Smith occasionally handles Branch-wide administrative tasks

and in my absence functions as Acting Chief, Headquarters Truining

and complicated job, the difficulty of which has been compounded by the necessity,

at least in part through public evento, lo plan and project i total revision of

instruction in the CA field. As a result, Mr. Smith has not yet had the opportunity

to teach.

This will come shortly, however, when a now course begins on 8 May.

The "Strong" rating given him here is based on the excellent work and thoroughly

professional approach he has taken in all of the preparatory work he has under-

raken. He has been eminently successful in establishing useful new relationships

and in maintaining his old contacts in the Clandestine Services for the purpose of

laying a solid groundwork for high quality training. In addition to his responsi-

bilitiea in OTR he has been regularly consulted by the CA Staff in a survey of

one of ils activities. This ta fine testimony for the regard in which he is hold-

outside the confines of his preacht job. The prognosis for a very effective

performance in all of his teaching asdignments is excellent. He has no supor-

visory responsibilities and is average in cost consciousness.

Mr. Smith has demonstrated both competence ond versaliasiace hlo

assignment to CA/PROP. With no prior experience in the area, he was assigned

lo WH affairs and has quickly developed both a surprioing knowledge of the problema

of that volatile group of countries and an oxcellent rapport with members of the

Divlaion (which, on several occastona has indicated a strong interest in securing lia

services when his release from the stall can be arranged). Assignments are com-

pleted with dispatch and in good order..

The rating of 3 with regard to the proposed campaign on Neutralism:

Nationaliam reflects only that we have not yet got underway in this aumittedly

difficule and controversial fleld. The sum of regearch which Mr. Sinith has done

in thia field leads him to the present conclusion (In which undersigned concuro) that

unlike most of our other campaigna thia will have to be conducted an a selected

country bagis and differently tallored for each.

During the absence of the rating official Mr. Smith has acted as Branch Chief.

vocabulary of Marxiom; psychintry and CPi; proparanda analyai8; content:

• analyals; pross techniques of the Chinese Communists; covert economic

warfare and CPW; personality problems in covert operatione; banic

doctrino on pagaive resistance; and a roview mooting.

In difficulty and in soriousness of approach, this series of

conforences correspunded to an

advanced pruduate course in an American

university. It wãs a mixturo of the seminar and lecture techniques.

I. Mr. Jogeph Smith Immediately made himself one of the outstanding

participants

of the group.

Ho brought, the capacity of a reflective

uld richly educated

mind to this new field and demonstrated a real

talont iur sooiny the opportunitles presented by novel and unconventional

PERSONNEL QUALIFICATION QUE AS IKE

1. The Agency is currently revising the system for machine coding

employee qualifications, thereby permitting more complete and accurate

data on all personnel. The new system will aid in implementing Agency

policies on promotion from within by facilitating the selection of personnel

with desired education and experience for vaçancies which may occur. It

is also expected that the new system will provide readily accessible statistics

for planning and management purposes.

2. The attached questionnaire is designed to cover adequately those

factors in which the Agency is intercsted.

Although the information is, in

a large measure, already redlected in previous forms submitted by you, it
