Mr. Geren pointed out, as an example of Diem's impact on the

negotiations, the fact that an initial one billion piaster estimate by the

Vietnamese had been reduced to 750 million after a talk between Diem and

the head of the GVN delegation. Mr. Geren belleved that the lengthy die-

cussione with the Vietnamese on thie subject helped to convince them that.

Diem is convinced that exchange reform in Laos was responsible

for its downfall. He argues that establishment of a unitary rate eliminated

the possibility of export to Thailand of goods supplied under the aid program

for Laos. This in turn made it impossible for the Lao Government to pay

its soldiers, which in turn led to the Kong Le revolt. (This io a most curioue

argument and aleo a most curioue une of U.S, aid supplies in Laos Ap you

may have noted from incoming telegrame, some effort. in being made to den

velop the counter argument.)

The Vietnamese have temporarily embargoed the export of fice on

the grounds that they don't want a speculative movement in rice prices which

might result from the capability of the Viet Cong to reduce rice supplies to

Meeting on Thursday, July 13.

In the intelligence briefing additional information was given on the

recent three-service military sweep in the south, It involved 4, 000 men on

the Vietnamese side and resulted in 20 Viet Cong killed, 7 wounded, and 37

captured.

This does not seem a very large result for such a military opera-

tion. Over-all (CVN-supplied) casualty figures for May and June were as
