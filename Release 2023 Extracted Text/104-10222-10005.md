Applicant Information

Sheet No,

To all persons applying for employment

with the Central Intelligence Agency

Thie paper lo the firet atep in applying for employment or consultant

statue with the Central Intelligence Agency. No application may proceed

beyond this first step if the applicant to not in agreement with the

conditions stated below;

General Considerations:

1. The Nutlonal Security Act of 26 July 1947 (Public Law 253, 80th

Congress) which ofcated the Central Intelligence Agency places upon the

Agency the responsibility:

"to advise the National Security Council In matters concerning

such intelligence activities of the Government departments and agencies

as relate to the national security;

b. "to make recommendations to the National Security Council

for the coordination of such intelligence activities of the depart-

ments and agencies of the Government as relate to the national

security:

c.

"to correlate and evaluate intelligence relating to then.

national security, and provide for the appropriate dissemination

of such intelligence within the Government

leo perform, for the benefit of the exisuing intelligence

agencies,

such additional service of common concern ad the National

Security Council determines can be more efliciently accomplished

centrally: Ac

so perform such other functions and duties related ro

intelligence affecung the national sectrity as the National Security

Council may from time to time direce."

---

## Page 80

The special charicter of this national responsibility requires the Agency

dierent to the pondine y potil employment rani who may covera-

ment departments and agencies which do not have the highly sensitive rest

ponsibility borne by the Central Intelligence Agency. It follows that the

investigation

stopplicanto prerequisite to thei acceptance dee time:

consumins process whichy in addition to loyalty and security checks,

includes

evaluation of competence. Physical and emotional fitness sand

availability

Of a suitable position at such time as employment may be

offered.

This is called clearance" of an applicant.

2.

estigation of an applicant may reveal something which prevents

his clearanc

pethaps something of which the applicant is genuinely unaware

perhaps comethins which only the special employment criterin of the Agency

make unacceptable. in any event. adverse findings by the Agency are con-

clusive and final so far as the Agency is concerned, and no statement of

specific reasons is made to the applicant.

3. Employment by the Central Intelligence Agency iS not a fight upon

which an applicant can insist. Offer of employment whichhis subject to fail

clearance does not constitute a commitment on the Agency's part giving an

unsuccessful applicant grounds for any claim against the Agency Acceptance

of employment upon the condition of clearance is at the applicant's risk.

taken with the knowledge that a very substantial percentage of applicants

are hot cleared.

Statement of Understanding

and Agrecmenti

I have read, understand, and agree to the foregoing General Conside

erations. If not accepted for employment by the Central Intelligence

Agency. I will make no claim or demand in conflict with those consid-

erations.

MEMORANDUM IN LIEU OF FITNESS REPORT

SUBJECT: Thomas J. Keenan

During the first six wecks of the revicwing period,

Keenan continued as Chief of the Mexico and Central

America Branch,

the Division's most demanding geographic

unit.. His performance during this period continued

same Strong level detailed in the last Fitness Report.

to

strengthen the Division's Opcrations, Staff. Mrockecnan

was moved up to fill one of the two Deputy Chief slots in

that unit.

sot July, ho was the sole Deputy of the

Staff. As set up ineLatin America Division, the Operations

Staff had both staff and line functions. It had broad

coordinating responsibilities with all elements outside

the Division, served as the focal point for all scnior

staff requests for studies and reports, stimulated and

coordinated Division operational activities and reviewed

the effectiveness of Division programs:

briefer.

His presentations are balanced and detailed,

often spiced with his engaging humor.

Keenan's tenure with the Ops Staff was a very

intensive period.

He normally worked

an eleven-hour day

and Saturdays as well. I take some pride in the fact that

there never developed an antagonist relationship between

the operating branches and the Ops Staff.

Nr. Keenan

deserves much of the credit for this. While often taking

issue with branch positions and written work, he was

unfailingly courtcous, good humored, and helpful. His

counsel

was often sought on difficult problems.

note, however.

that Mr. Keenan served under me when I was Chief of Station, Bogota

As a person, Mr Keenan is a mature, dedicated officer with a pleasing

personality. He gets along well with his peers and subordinates and is

respected by then. have selected him to be Chief of the mexican and

central. American Branch which is one indicator of the confidence l have

Inahts ability. This will be an excellent test of Ma:

Evaluatton of the Subloctta TrainIng

Keenan's evaluations in formal training have been

uniformly commencator.

The ITC Instructory found that

"although he was a bit slow in adjusting to tho rogutronents

of the course, during the last two vooka he chowed definite

progress...his Mnal briefing was oxcellent.. pleasant young

man, interested and cooperativo. Bives proudoo of being a

bound Intolligence officer. In the OC his work was good -

performance as highly astlofactorccoln faco-to-face

pracwica, oxercloes he was erfoot yo..acquired a highly satlo-

factory understanding of the vartous kinds of Agency operations,

revealing a perticularly thorough knowledge of CI concepte and

methods".

On the desk he proved to be intolllent, alert, con-

sciontious,..onthustastio and Inuginatio, gots on voil vith

his co-workers and takes a healthy point of view toward his

eastgarents,

His notivation is highto

6. JOTP Opinion of the sublect.

Keenan has always mado a good Impression.

He bas

workod diligently, has made for the snooth oporation of the

Progran, and has recelved commendation fron his supervisor

Dear Mr. Bush's

1 an pleased co repore that Me Keenan, Central Intellißence Asency

civillan; was among those who successfully completed he'

course:of

Inetruction at the US Army War College during Academte Year 1976 and

was avarded a diplone.

This report 1a wy evaluation of Mr. Thomas J. Keenan during his attend.

ance at the US Army War Collega from & August 1975 to 7 June 1976

Attendance at the US Army War College Le based on a highly setective

process, and only a very small percentage of all those eligible 1s chosen

The evaluations herein are. mada in relation to thie outstanding group. of

individuale.

No attempt la made to dietingulah between graduates on a

rank order basis.

Mr:

Keenan

was one of eight civiliens (three from the foreign affairs

community) in a class of 227. Thie total Ineludes 187 Army, 16 Alr

Force, ten Navy, and six Marine officers of colönel or leutenant colonel

or equivalent Navy rank.

In a class structure such as that outlined above, the task of the civilian

student at the USAWC 1e an especlally challenging one.

Working in an

area outside his normal milieu, hto was a dual responalbility:

On the one

hand; he had to acquaint hanelf in considerable detall with the military

aspects of national security with which, in mont lostances, he has hade

relatively little. if any prevtous expertence. To sccomplish this require-

ment; he did extensive background research In the areas of military polley,

military atrategy, and defense minngement to keep abreast of his profes-

slanal

military colleagues. On the other hand, his foreign polley expertise

wAS

In heavy demand by hle military colleagues. In consequence, his

contribution to varlous international relaciong aspects of seminar group

efforts tended to be deproporcionately large, Morcover, as the gole

civilian volce in a seminar

group

of fourteen hishly experlenced

military officers, he also ensured that adequate welght was alven.

mong the objectives of the curriculum 18 enhancing the competence of

selected officers to assume command and leadership responsibilities and

to function in key staff, asoignmente in major Army, Joint, and combined

headquarcers and in planning and policymaking positions at the seat of

government:

To achlove the and related objectives, the curriculum con-

stets. of chroe major, segmental The Common Overview, the Electives Phase,

and the Military Studtes Program. The Common Overview segment inclüdes

four courses:

The United States and the horld Environment, Command and

Management.

tetpation in the Milttary Studies Program 1a optional and can

be substituted for one or more electives, dependins on the scope of the

research subject selected. In addition, the ten-nonth currtculum Includes

voluntary programs and field tripe.

Mr. Xeenan acted as. asslatant sentnat group chairman in the core curriculum

course entitled,

"The Unfted States and the World Environment." He and

one other student edited the final seminar report, and he wrote that part

of the report dealing with US policies in the Western Hemisphere, including

an excellent Sreatment of the Panama Canal nesotiations: Mr. Keenan van

also assistant seminar group chairman during the "Scrategic Miltary:

Studtes" courso, and again hts facile pen vas put to good use on the

editortal subsroup

His calm, steadying approach to issues won the respect

of his milicary colleagues, and his extenäive knowledge of Lattn America

was particularly valuable to the group'a dellberations.

In the "Military

Strategy Sealnar," Mr.

Keenon proved himself an excellent student of

atratesy and an articulate, vell-prepared debater in the seminar discuestone.

In the eleccives phase Mr.

Keenan took four courses (the required number)::

"The Power Pocentlal of Developing Nattons,"

"Contemporary Issues in US

Foreign Poltey,"

"Stratesic Issues of World War it," and "Third World:

Dynamics of Social Change"; he nudited "Latio Merica:

Pover Structures

Current Scene."

Mr. Keenan prepared carefully for his electlve

courses and contributed his viewe in a concise, orderly manner.

Since the vast n

majority of the Army War College student body live together

on the post,

very important part uf the overall War Collese experience

is the social and extracurricular internation which takes place outalde
