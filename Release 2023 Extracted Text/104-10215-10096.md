to Headquarters for a tour of duty.

After having lived and worked for so long under deap cover

without boing able to mingle freely with Americas he needs to ratur

to the United Statos for mental and physical readjustnants for himself

NORMAYR•

Th1s, combinad with the atress of his double lifo requirad

by his deas cover position und his non-assoclation with anyone except

his Case Officer with whon he can discuss his work and problong. has

been nalding him increasingly more tense during the last year or tho.

HOENAIR 18 in extranaly capable Oparations Officer and kill Division

carnestly balieves that it is RUBAK's responsibillty to bring this

ation in this effort 1s being sought.

NOBHAIR, even though he has received Headquarters covert

training, still noads to be closely associated ulth Headquarters for

a tour to acquira additional background on operational techniques and

approaches and to be exposed to Headquarters' activity and thinking.

This axperienco 1a roquialta to making a vell-rounded Intelligence
