CIA, CARACAS,

CANNOT STATE DEFINITELY THAT THE SHOT WAS FIRED

BY MORALES OR SOMEONE ACTING FOR HIM, BUT THIS IS NOT BEYOND THE

REALM OF POSSIBILITY.

CIA, CARACAS,

SEL IEVES THAT THE ONLY PURPOSE THE ASSASSINATION

OF TH ERIALLI

WOULD HAVE SERVED WOULD HAVE BEEN TO STRAIN PELATIONS

BETWEEN VENEZUELA AND THE UNITED STATES, AND MOST CERTAINLY WOULD

NOT HAVE AIDED THE ORLANDO BOSCH AVILA CAUSE IN ANY WAY.

A [CIA SOURCE HAS ADVISED THAI AT A RECENT PARTY AI THE

RESIDENCE OF ORLANDO GARCIA, MORALES, WHILE QUITE INTOXICATED

LIVE WITH BRESHNEV," REFERRING TO THE SOVIET PREMIER. MORALES IS

NOT RPT NOT CURRENTLY ON THE ROLLS OF OFFICIAL DISIP EMPLOYEES,

HAS VACATED HIS APARIMENT AT THE ANAUCO HILTON, LEAVING

AN UNPAID

TAKEN UP RESIDENCE IN AN APARIMENT, THE COST OF WHICH IS PROHIBITIVE

THE POSSIBILITY CERTAINLY EXISTS THAT HE IS MENTALLY UNSTABLE,

HE DOES NOT STOP DRINKING IT WILL KILL HIM IN SHORT ORDER. DU)

GARCIA IS MORALES' PROTECIOR IN DISIP, AND SHOULD HE EXPIRE
