Did he hand the pills to you?

Mr.

Mr. Schwarz. Did he know what the pills were for?

Mr. O'Connell.

I don't think so.

Mr. Schwarz. But he knew they were illegal?

Mr. O'Connell. He knew they were illegal.

Mr. Schwarz. And were the pills not tried out on some

experimental subjects in the u.s.?

Mr. O'Connell. Yes.

Mr. Schwarz. And proven to be lethal?

Mr. O'Connell. Well, to the extent -- I will tell you

that, we used them on hamsters.

Mr. Schwarz. And. also monkeys?

Mr. O'Connell. No, as far as I know, just the hamsters.

Mr. Schwarz. But anyway, you knew they were lethal.

Mr. O'Connell.

Yes.

Mr. Schwarz. And you handed them over to Rosselli?

Mr. O'Connell. Yes.

/ Mr. Schwarz. And had the Technical Services made poison

pills before as far as you know?

Mr. O'Connell. As far as I know. I have no idea.

This was my first experience with that sort of thing.

I am giving to you now.

Mr. Madigan.

We don't have it presently.

Mr. O'Connell. I am sure it is over there.

Mr. Wides. With regard to the discussion of

authorization,

would it have been following on Mr. Madigan's point, that this

was a fairly serious

and unusual operation that you were given,

and that you would have asked, is this authorized? Or how dia

the question of MI. Dulles authorizing it come up, as best you

recall?

Mr. O'Conhell. I told you, I knew that Mr. Dulles -- I was

told that Mr. Dulles had authorized it, I can't say quite when

it happened, but I know I was told.

MI. Wides. You testified this morning -- I don't want

to put words in your mouth -- I thought you testified that you

were sure that Mr. Edwards told you at this meeting when he first

gave you the assignment that you were not sure that Mr. Bissell's

also mentioned that when you later met in your office.

Mr. O'Connell. I would stick with that, yes. I think it

probably was when I -- when Colonel Edwards called me he

said, this probably has the blessing of the DCI. '

Mr. Wides. Do you know if br. V. SiRoosevelts who

was head of the Technical Services Division at the 'time, was

witnessing about this?

Mr. O'Connell. I wouldn't want to bet my life that he

and

Ri came over to Colonel Edwards'office.

Mr. Wides.

But you don't recall whether you ever knew

that

dosevelt knew what it was in connection with as distinct

from merely knowing it was a lethal pill, is that right?

Mr. O'Connell. I can't say -- to my personal knowledge,

the discussion never came up when I was there.

I don't think

he is a dummy, and I don't think pretchles is any dummy, and

I think they had a general idea.

But as far as I know they were never officially told.

Mr. Wides. To your knowledge, before you went overseas

no one else in the office of Security, Mr. Bannerman, Mr.

White or Mr. Hall, none of those men of anyone else knew about

the project, only yourself and Mr. Edwards?

Mr. O'Connell. Well, I would say this, to my knowledge

they were never briefed. However, I think I brought up an

incident this morning where Colonel Edwards was on leave and

Colonel King called Mr. Bannerman, who was his

deputy, and assumed that Bannerman knew all about it and started

talking about it, what are we going to do about

this - I don't know what the conversation was about.

And

Bannerman called in and said, what was this all about?

Mr. Wides.

This was in 1962 before you left?

Mr. O'Connell. Yes. It was while I was up in the office.

And I said, I don't have the authority to brief you on it.

Mr. Wides.

Were you ever aware, whether you were formally

notified of just got a rumble or heard through the grapevine,

that the CIA was getting some information about these threats,

or some information about groups who might pose a threat in the

Washington area, not

from Bureau sources or military sources,

but from CIA sources, did you ever hear any rumble of that kind?

MI. O'Connell.

Yes.

Mr. Wides. What did you hear?

Mr. O'Connell. The only way I got involved in it was that!

Howard Osborn would have a nine o'clock meeting every

morning with his deputies.

And they had a proprietary organization in the Office of

Security which I think had informants.

Now, I don't know their identities, but it would come out

in the meeting, and they would have some names for them.

I

couldn't tell you what they were.

Mr. Madigan. What was the proprietary called?

MI. O'Connell. The name that strikes me -- and I

know part of it, but I couldn't tell you exactly -- I think it

was

Anderson --

Mr. Madigan.

Anderson Stuart?

Mr. O'Connell. Anderson Stuast, something like that.

Mr. Wides. You say you think they had informants?

Mr. O'Connell. They obviously did, I guess, because the

way this would come out, so-and-so advised at a meeting last

If you associate that with andersoned

How would it be discussed at the meeting, through this

MI. O'Connell. Victor White.

Mr. Wides. And what would he say about how Anderson!

fitted into the picture?

Mr. O'Connell. That never came up. I just drew that

conclusion, that they had potential.

MI. Wides. Why would you assume that they used a proprie-

tary as opposed to just having some agents penetrate a group?

Why would you think in terms of their using the Andorion

Mr. O'Connell. I can tell you what I think.

First of all, I wouldn't want to use government employees.

That is in fact what they were doing.

Did you have any knowledge during the 1970-1971 time frame

of any effort outside of Florida with regard to Cubans to fire

on the Keys or on the Florida area there with a boat that

would be disguised as a Russian boat, which was really a

group of people, some of whom were assets of the Agency?

MI. O'Connell. No.

Mr. Madigan. You

never heard of anything like that?

Mr. O'Connell. Nothing of that, no.

Mr. Madigan. Did you ever run across a fellow by

the name of Jerry Henning in your dealing with Roselli

and Maheu?

Mr. O'Connell. No.

Mr. Madigan. You never heard of the name?

Mr. O'Connell. I never heard of the name.

Yes.

right about 1959?

occasions.

he was involved in the operations field?

Mr. O'Connelll. Oh, no. He did a lot of other things.

Mr. Madigan. Let me ask you this question.

When Maheu was having his problems with the authorities,

was there any reference back to his involvement in those kind of

activities, or was the only discussion about his role in

the so-called assassination plot?

Mr. O'Connell. Well, I am not even so sure that they got

into that aspect of it. It was just that he was involved

to the extent that he had set up the operation against Rowan,

or he was the one that got in touch with Dubois to do it.

Mr. Wides. When did you come back from overseas?

Mr. O'Connell. July of 1965.

Mr. Wides. After you came back did you learn of a time,

either after you came back of very shortly before you came

Mr. Wides. Or surreptitious entry?

MI. O'Connell. He did one surreptitious entry for us once.

Mr. O'Connell.

There were a group of

And they were staying

in a rooming house up there right outside of Georgetown some-

here. And one of the students

Hand

said that one of the group

was acting very suspiciously,

taking a lot of notes where they were not supposed to be taking!

notes, or certainly after operational briefings, and he would go

back to his room and he would write voluminous notes. And

he thought that was very strange that this guy was not acting

as he should.

And that aroused the suspicion

And they wanted to know whether we would get in and photo-

graph what he was writing to see whether he was really

violating his agreement.

So I called Maheu and he went up to the rooming house, and

he went to the people who owned the house and asked if they

had a room to rent and she had one. And he did know where the

students were staying. And she showed him one room. And

have it, she had the adjacent room.

So he brought what would appear to be a suitcase up there,

which was his photographic equipment. And we knew the students

were in school, and

was going to alert us if

they came back, so he wouldn't get caught in the act.

And he went in, it was a very simple matter. It was

a tin box that he could open with a paper clip and he took it out

and photographed it, and put the case back in the drawer and

locked up and left.

looking at one part of the school over there. And this guy

stairs the students were coming up, with amatter of maybe

a split second timing.

about?

Mr. O'Connell. This would have been about 1955.

Mr. Wides. And other than that, and the two incidents

involving female companioship, what other kinds of sensitive

things would he undertake?

Was that in the period that you

were paying him 500 a month?

Mr. Madigan.

And that was accomplished as far as you know?

Mr. O'Connell. The film was made, but they never did

release it, because things started to get better with the

leader, and they felt that they wouldn't use it.

Mr. O'Connell. No. I hired a small independent studio in

Los Angeles.

Mr. Madigan. And did Agency officials fly out there,

the ones that knew about the backdrop and all that? How was

that done??

Mr. O'Connell. It seems to me that they were just --

at this point I am not too sure whether they superimposed it,

I guess is the word, with that background. I am not so

sure at this point, it has been so long ago. That was away in

the mid-fifties.

Mr. Wides. Could we get back to the question that we had

started on, which was the files and where they would exist?

You said that the operational files from all of your dealing

with him would be in the Family Jewels, because they were

Mr. O'Connell. Yes.

While you were down there - and this

may overlap the question that. Mr. Madigan asked before, but

I think it is a little more -- did you have any awareness of

any other efforts apart from Mr. Verona by Cubans in connec-

tion with the Agency to try and assassinate Castro?

Mr. O'Connell. No, none whatsoever.

MI. Wides. I don't have any other questions.

Mr. Madigan. In your operational activities with Mr.

Maheu, particularly in the New York area, did you ever have con-

tact with a private investigator by the name of A. J.

Woolston-Smith?

Mr. O'Connell. No, I never heard of him.

Mr. Wides. Do you know why there were two field

offices in New York, two iffices in Manhatten?

What was the difference?

Mr. O'Connell. The cover.

Mr. Wides. Were there two offices?

MI. O'Connell. Why, they had them, it just grew like

Topsy. They had two offices in Washington, and they had two

offices in New York. And really the basis -- it was that that

was the way they started, they figured they needed two

doing.

Mr. Wides. What would the New York offices do as dis

tinct from the Manhattan offices, or vice versa?

Mr. O'Connell. Nothing. They were basically investigative

offices.

Mr. Wides. They just happened to have two?

Mr. O'Connell.

They had two.

Now they are over on,

Mr. Wides. Thank you very much. That concludes the session.

And we appreciate your staying so long.
