Review Staff 75/1696
1. Per referent request, we have conducted a review of our
files on incidents and individuals mentioned in the report given
by Fidel Castro to Senator McGovern. This memorandum contains
the results of our traces on the the alleged assassination plots and
the Cuban individuals mentioned in the report. It must be borne
in mind that our files are keyed primarily to names of individuals
and not by incidents or plots, thereby thereby making the retrieval process
difficult. No project file bearing specifically on the subject of
assassination has located Nonetheless, what follows is keyed
to the chronological order of the plots as described in Castro's
report.

CUBRIA was a long-time sabotage expert and member of Castro's 26th
of July Movement until 1960, when he apparently turned on Castro.
He was arrested in 1960 for organizing underground activity
against the Castro regime and was sentenced to 30 years. imprison-
ment for conspiracy. There is no record of CIA contact with CUBRIA.

B. March 1961. A number of the Cubans mentioned in
the incident were indeed employed by this Agency in the fields
of intelligence collection and paramilitary activities against
Cuba. There is nothing in the files reviewed to substantiate
that their mission was to assassinate Castro. Some of those
mentioned were in fact involved in clandestine infiltration
into Cuba for the purposes of gathering intelligence and
carrying out paramilitary activities in a March 1961 mission.
(1) Humberto SORI Marin. There is a 201 file
on the individual. In November 1960 SORI, a disaffected Cuban
government employee, contacted a Cuban working on our behalf
and advised him of his desire to work against the Castro
government. On 1 December 1960 SORI was placed under house
arrest by the Cuban Government but escaped with the assistance
of unidentified friends on 21 December 1960. He was exfiltrated
to the Miami area, without CIA involvement, on 19 February 1961.
He was met by a CIA case officer on 2 March 1961 and debriefed
on his activities in Cuba. A Provisional Operational Approval
(POA) was requested for his use as an intelligence source and
subsequently granted in March 1961. He was met again by a
CIA case officer on 5 March 1961. He returned to Cuba
clandestinely on or about 11 March 1961 without CIA assistance.
Shortly after his return to Cuba he was arrested and taken to

CIA assistance for the attempt. CIA immediately informed him
that the USG did not condone such attempts and no commitments
were made to assist him.
N. Mid 1964. Some of those mentioned in the report

brother's net on 17 March 1961. However she was terminated
on 18 November 1963 due to insufficient intelligence production
and lack of operational security.040n or about 7 September 1964
it was reported that Leopoldina GRAU Alsina was under suspicion
in connection with an aborted assassination attempt on Castro.
However Leopoldina GRAU Alsina was not arrested until 21 January
1965 along with her brother. At that time she was accused of
counterrevolutionary activities and attempted assassination
of Castro. A separate report indicates that the Cuban internal
security organs had allegedly found poisonous substances in
her residence. of There is nothing in the files reviewed to
indicate that (Leopoldina was directed by CIA to assassinate
Castro or any record to indicate that the poisons were provided
by CIA.
(4) Alberto GRAU Sierra. He is a distant cousin
of Leopoldina GRAU Alsina. He was arrested on 7 September 1964
for an aborted assassination attempt against Castro. We can
find no record of any operational interest in him by CIA.

S. Mid 1965 and May 1966. While some of the
individuals were considered for use by this and other USG
agencies, they were not últimately employed by CIA and
available records indicate we were not connected with them
at the time the incidents occurred.
(1) Antonio CUESTA del Valle. There is a 201
file on the individual. He was considered for use by CIA
in early 1961 as a crewman for a CIA vessel involved in
maritime operations. The file does not reveal whether he
was actually used but all interest in him was terminated in
mid 1961. He was subsequently reported to be a leader of
"Comandos L", a Miami-based anti-Castro exile organization.
He was captured in May 1966 after being wounded when his..
group attempted to land a team of infiltrators near Havana.
CIA had no connection with the operation and the file does
not confirm that he was involved in an assassination attempt
against Castro.
(2) Eugenio Enrique ZALDIVAR Cadenas. There is
a 201 file on the individual, indicating an interest in him
in April 1966 by another USG agency. His file was closed on
7 June 1966. He is identified as a member of "Comandos L".
No further information is available.
(3) Sandelio Herminio DIAZ Garcia.
There is
a 201 file on the individual. The file was opened in
September 1957 because of his involvement with Honduran and
Costa Rican revolutionary activities. He was debriefed by
a CIA case officer in September 1963 as a Cuban refugee.
At that time he claimed to be in contact with anti-Castro
groups in Cuba and stated that he wanted to assassinate
Castro. He indicated his intention to return to Cuba immediately.
We dropped contact with him at that time and never did have an
operational relationship with him. In January 1966 he was
reported to be involved in a plan by a Cuban emigre group to
infiltrate Cuba for the purpose of assassinating Castro. On
30 May 1966 he was identified by Radio Havana as a member of
a commando group killed while trying to land on the island.
However, in August 1973 an individual ndividual with the same name and
year of birth was reportedly involved in narcotics trafficking
in Costa Rica. A Cuban exile source stated that he believed:
subject to be identical with the nercotics trafficker in
Costa Rica. There is no further information to substantiate
this.
12
SECCET
(4) Armando ROMERO Martinez. There is a 201
file on the individual. llis file was opened on 4 December
1963 in response to an indication of interest in him by
another USG agency. The relationship with him was termin-.
ated following his arrest in Miami in January 1964 for illegal
use of narcotics and possession of explosives and automatic
weapons.
T. 17 March 1967. A review of files does not
confirm that CIA was involved in this incident.
(1) Felix ASENCIO Trejo. There is a 201 file
on the individual which indicates that a POA was granted
on 4 March 1964 since subject was of interest to us as a
possible candidate for paramilitary operations against Cuba.
The POA was cancelled on 20 August 1964 with no indication
that subject was ever actually used operationally.
:
(2) Wilfredo MARTINEZ Diaz. We have no positively
identifiable information on this individual.
(3) Lazaro Gustavo ARECES Alvarez. There is a
201 file on the individual which indicates that a POA was
granted 7 July 1964 for intended use as a seaman aboard a
CIA vessel involved in maritime operations. The POA was
cancelled 8 September 1964 with the indication that the
subject was not hired.
U. 1971. There is nothing in files reviewed to
indicate that we had any contact with the subject mentioned
in the report or were involved in the alleged incident.
(1) Jesus DOMINGUEZ Benitez. No CIA traces on
subject were found.
2. It is noted that the above totals twenty-one separate
analytical sections whereas there are actually twenty-four
alleged assassination attempts. This is due to the fact that
the analyses of the two incidents of 26 July 1961 have been
combined since they both occurred on the same day and were
allegedly executed by the same group. The treatment of the
alleged June 1965 poisoning attempt is part of the analysis
of the mid 1964 incident because the alleged pepetrator is
related to the group described therein. The incident described
in Castro's report as mid 1965 has been combined with the
analysis of the 1966 incident since both were allegedly carried
out by the same group.
13
SECTET
3. In summary, of the twenty-four incidents described
in Castro's report, the files reviewed indicate that CIA
had no involvement in fifteen of the cases; i.e., never had
any contact with the individuals mentioned or was not in
contact with them at the time of the alleged incidents. In
the remaining nine cases, CIA had operational relationships
with some of the individuals mentioned but not for the purpose
of assassination. It is noted that one case is currently
being reviewed by a SSC staff member for selection of documents
to be sanitized. This case (Rolando CUBELA Secades) was not
reviewed in connection with this memorandum. Of the twenty-
three cases reviewed, nothing has been found to substantiate
the charges that CIA directed its agents to assassinate Castro.
