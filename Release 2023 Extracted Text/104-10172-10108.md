FROM

SUBJECT : Deportatios of Maurice Halporio

1. Attached da a copy of MEXI 186 In which the station asked

1os guldanco on their effort to deport Halperin. We dleçuraod this

on the morning of 12 September. During the afternoon of 12 Septem-

ber I received HMM-A -7904 which outlinea the stations' elforta lo

bring about Halperin's deportation.

You will note from (para 2 of HMM-A-7904) that the station

bogan its effort on 21 August when LIKAYAK-2 was asked by a Medcan

went forward in an attempt to have Halperin deported without advising

Hoadquartera or the Legal Attache.

Thus, when it appeared from LIME W'O statemento (680

MEXI 186) that ODENVY. dld not.want American Communista doported,

too otation realised that it was working at crous purposes with the

Bureau sinco the atation's efforta had been in progress for almose :

three weats.

That the Medcan government Is probably confused as this

moment la indicated by the fact that Juatavo Dyas Ordas (s0e para 8

of dispatch) who la in touch with Santillan, probably knows that

Santian de receiving information from LUKAYAK-2, who la known

to be in touch with the Amertcans..

1..

All of references were PYBAT/LCVAYFO.L.

2. As stated in Reference a. telephonic coverage was instituted on the

residence of Maurice Hymen HAL'EPIl (and Editia HALibRIN) On 3 June 195%.

3. As of 17 June 1957 this coverce was discontinued because repairmen

of the telephone compony were in the neighborhood cleaning up old linso;

and

the two (2) extra lines into our basenouse had to be cut for security roasons.

It 1s not known when this cuerage can be re-instituted; thie depends

upon the departure from the erea of the telephone repairmas.

Wattached are coptes of the transcripts

obtained during the

(8)

fourteen (14) daye of coverage:

As will be noted this line 16 not

as productive as

ome here. One:

of the reasons for this 1s the absence of both laurice and Edith HALTERIl (he

at his "businesses", she teaching) alsost every day.

7. A copy of these transcrlots 1s being kept by the Station.
