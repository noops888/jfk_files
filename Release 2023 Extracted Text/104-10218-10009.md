The undersigned on 23 Mey 1907 reviered in VH Division

Tichborn's 201 file (4 folders) and related operational flies.

Particular attention was given in this review to lichsora's

security.

2o The files reflect that lichborn is very security

There is no evidence that Iichborn was erer sus-

pected of being a lOFACT operative.

aimed at left-ving Intellectuals.

The CI/DA stair revien in

1955 stated that richborn's cover story was completely accepted

by his frierds and associates.

The SOS.lIRL Of Tichcora in 1555

revealed that he bai informed only his wire of his association

wita WOFACT.

4.

The files reflect that Tichborn is very sensitive

about security.

He balked at working with a WORiCT officer

in Mexico City, beause a friend told Fichborn that the WOFACT

officer not only was WOFACT but had openly admitted it to the

friend.

A proposed trio to Solivia was aborted beczuse lichborn

felt there was no suitable cover.

5.

Tichborn has traveled extensively in Latin Anerica

on training and elestion assigments.

Three countries in which

he vorsed are Chile, Dominican Republic ard Puarto Rico. On

these assigments Tichborn used his legal, publishing, ard

rovie cover.

It is understood that be also used alieses and

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Contact Report, 8 May 1967

PARTICIPANTS: Edward G. TICHBORN, Stephen Chaconas, and Lee E. Patton

PLACE

•: Shoreham Hotel, 1230-1500 Hours

1. Preliminary meeting was in the hotel room but the bulk of the dis-

cussion took place during lunch and afterwards. The gist of the discussion

with TICHBORN was as follows:

a. TICHBORN explained how he had been surprised at the sudden

loss of interest by Antonio Menendez in the project and particularly in

introducing TICHBORN to other contacts. TICHBORN says that the

reason for this is Menendez' sudden recognition of the danger to his

political future in even indirectly being connected with what could become

a controversial book.

TICHBORN attempted to develop various hypotheses

for the revelation of this fear at this time rather than earlier in the

negotiations.

There was, however, no really clear explanation of why

Menendez had so suddenly drawn into his shell.

b. TICHBORN was asked whether he felt that in some ways we

were not "taken" by Menendez. He responded with considerable heat by

saying that it was a calculated gamble that "just didn't pay off".

became very defensive when the discussion turned to the original evaluation

of Antonio Menendez.

He says that he is convinced that Menendez has

the information as well as the cortacts and in short was the right man but :

one who turned out to be unwilling to run the risks involved for the "small

amount of money" he would be paid. TICHBORN attempted to make a

strong case for his belief that Menendez was the right man and emphasized

(somewhat apart from the point) that some day he will have an important"

post in a future PRI government.

TICHBORN says the whole problem

was discussed with Stan Watson who agreed that the project could not be

## Page 30

-2-

productive now due to the sudden reluctance of Antonio Menendez and

Jose Luis Siqueiros to introduce TICHBORN to their contacts.

Stan

Watson also felt, according to TICHBORN, that it would be risky for

TICHBORN to contact Gonzalez Casanova, Cholula and Urquidi. While

details of the discussions between Watson and TICHBORN were not'

given, it seems that the decision not to proceed was reached without any

major hassle between TICHBORN and Stan Watson. (Comment: TICHBORN

appears to be not at all unhappy about terminating what could have i!

become a long and unproductive research effort built on a shaky story

of TICHBORN writing a book on the PRI. )

C.

Antonio Menendez wrote up in English some of his comments.

based on his approach to the research problem. This 13 page double

spaced report is attached.

Chaconas asked TICHBORN how well he knew Carlos Fuentes

(for possible BGBERET targeting). TICHBORN replied that he knew

him very well and that he felt he could approach him directly if he had a

reason for being in Paris (vacation, for example) or wherever Fuentes

is now living.

TICHBORN said that he believed Fuentes would accept an

assignment to write articles on North Vietnam based on a future visit

to that area but he also indicated that he believed we could not control

the tone of the articles which would be likely to be pro-North Vietnam.

2. TICHBORN was asked by LEP to review the list of trips TICHBORN

had made outside the country and to confirm the dates and advances involved.

LEP asked TICHBORN to get a list from his cover company of his domestic

trips so that when the cover company submits a claim, WH will have a record

of what trips were authorized for operational purposes involving TICHBORN.

TICHBORN, on the same subject, said that he feels as does his cover company

boss that some other arrangement should be made for some of his travel for

WH. TICHBORN says he feels that the amount of travel he is involved in may

appear unusual to the cover company accountant. LEP agreed that this was

not a good situation over the long run and that he would talk to Gail Allen :

about making different arrangements for the future.

TICHBORN was requested to rebate the $171. 18 owed from the advance

given him in Mexico for his trip there on 17 March.

He offered to write out

a check but LEP suggested that he send the check throughthe proper channels

to the post office box number given him. He also promised to send the

accounting for the latest trip to Mexico City in as soon as possible. TICHBORN

was reminded of the need to send in his April and May loan payments which he

agreed to do right away.

1. The following administrative details were discussed with

TICHBORN:

a. The change in insurance premiums was explained. He is

to pay $26.88 for his next premium and in the future will pay

$25. 89.

b.

His income tax problems were discussed, and he feels the

matter has now been arranged satisfactorily as a result of his trip

to Washington to talk to WH/B&F officers.

c. In regard to Spain--he was told that the situation still has not

been settled but that a decision is expected around the end of April.

c. LEP requested a statement from TICHBORN with regard to

his authorization to have a six month moratorium on his $125 a

month loan payments.

TICHBORN wrote out a statement per B&F's

request. He also signed a certification for his recent trip to Mexico.

LEP requested TICHBORN to give him a check for the rebate for

his 17 March trip to Mexico of $171. 18. In response to a question

as to how much he had paid Menendez, he said he had given him $500!

2. In a discussion on the objectives and plans for his 25 April trip

to Mexico City, TICHBORN said he intended to contact the following:

Menendez, Siqieros, Cholula, Casanova Gonzalez.

He said he had called

and confirmed specific meeting dates with Menendez and Sigieros.

TICHBORN said he could not call Cholula and Casanova because such a

long distance call would seem unusual to these acquaintances. TICHBORN

Copy of letter from Edward G. TICHBORN

"On or about September 10, 1966 I had a meeting with three or

four gentlemen in Washington (as I recall, they were Jerry Droller,

Jack Kaufman, Paull Kittredge and someone else) and I informed

these gentlemen that my moving expenses had been considerably

more than I had estimated. However, I told these gentlemen that

rather than ask for an additional amount, I wished to serve a

moratorium of loan payments for six montlis. One of these

men (with a nod from other) said "okay--don't worry about it--

just don't ask for an additional allotment. We'll take care of it."

"At this point we moved on to another topic, and I assumed I would

be allowed to skip payments for six (6) months.

SUBJECT

Request for Services of Edward G. TICHBORN (P)

Pursuant to exploratory discussions participated in by

Mr. Allen of DO,

Of EUR, and MI. Patton of WH, your

approval 15 requested to assign contrect azent Edward G. TICHBORN (P)

to Madrid for approximately taree weeks TDY.

Do would, of course,...

defray the expenses of Tichborn's trip.

2.

As you know, Tichborn is provided cover in New Yorks by

DO's proprietary WUSALINE under Project WUBRITY. WUSALIE has

an affiliate in Madrid. The operational potential of WUSALINE's

Spanish affiliate and that of its local directors has not been

fully determined.

DO, BUR and COS, Hadrid, are interested in

determining the access of the local directors to intelligence

targets and in assessing the affiliate as a cover vehicle.

As

WUSALINE's officer concerned with Latin Averica, Tichborn 15

considered a logical choice. fron the cover viewpoint for this

assigment.

He

also has considerable WoFACT experience, beets

people easily, is fluent in Spanish, and is a graduate of the

Harvard Law School.

The latter fact is important,

considering

the legal background of the affiliate's local directors.

If you approve, it is envisaged that the operation will

be closely coordinated by DO, EUR, and WE. "COS, Madrid has

concurred in a TDY by Tichborn and can provide on-the-spot

guidance.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT

.: Contact Report, 8 December 1205-1600 hours

PARTICIPANTS: Edward G TICHBORN and Lee E. Patton

PLACE

: Hotel Hoosevelt and Charley Brown's Pub

; 1:

1. TICHBORN arrived at the meeting site in the lobby five minutes

We went up to the hotel room where the following business items

were discussed.

a. He was told of his overpay of $872. 37 which he said he would

return at once by check to Manuel P. Goodtxo, mailed to Mr. William

S. Rodgers,

b. TICHBORN was reminded of the requirement that he pay his

premiums of 93. 63 for his health insurance. He was told he owed,

for the period of October through January, and it was suggested that

he pay by check directly to the above box.

He was told that there' was

no expiration notice sent out on the premiums being due; hence, it was

up to him to keep the matter current.

He was told that Finance was interested in obtaining his

monthly payments of $125 in repayment of his loan of $3, 000.

Apparently he had last paid in July.

He requested an extention or'""

moratorium through January 1967 due to his heavy expenses involved

in moving.

d. TICHBORN was shown copies of the "White" FBIS publication.

After he has looked at these, he will notify LEP as to whether he

wants copies in the future mailed to the post office box which he has

now obtained.

TICHBORN was told that the $575 which he had lost on a

TDY trip about a year and a half ago has now been officially written off.

1. TICHBORN was told NOT to use his pseudo, TICHBORN, on

mail (LEP had received an envelope from TICHBORN which carried

his pseudo on the outside as sender but had a phony address).

2. TICHBORN submitted his proposal on the PRI study which he

estimated would cost $3, 800. Since it did not have a research plan or

outline, LEP requested him to send one as soon as possible.

TICHBORN

believes Menendez is indispensable and that his services are worth i-l!

the $2, 000 he has projected. TICHBORN feels that his plan is not as'"!

complete as it might be but would be of a very useful size and scope

and could be completed in six months. LEP briefed TICHBORN on

the peculiarities of our operational interest in research as contrasted to.

the traditional academic approach. TICHBORN seemed to understand.

these distinctions very clearly.

3. TICHBORN had a preliminary report entitled 'Press Reaction to

Balaguer". He said that last week he had finally found a newstand on

146th-Street where he could buy daily issues (only about a day late) of !!

El Caribe, Listan Diario and Ahora.

4. LEP briefed TICHBORN on our (WH), reluctance to send him on

missions to other areas.

He indicated that he had not heard of the

Spanish tripfrom

He quickly said that he thought such a trip wa's

justifiable from the standpoint of Spanish relations with Latin America,

etc. etc.

5. He agreed that he would be of very limited use for

in other

areas and said that he had so informed

when such travel had been

proposed earlier.

IN RE:

Protected trip through Latin America

Bearing in mind that our: executive committee

sobe future but presently undetermined date) destre Lopez

to undertake in-depth surveys of econoble conditions in

certain Latin American countries, we consider it highly de-

sirable to establish prior contacts witn the banking and

business communities of several selected areas which are

most likely to offer

sound Investment opportunities:

Our past experience indicates that it 1s much easier to

assess spontaneous financlal ventures if one 1s already

acquainted with the business ambiance of a particularicountry.

Thus, having previously touched base with local bankers and

industrialists, Lopez would have the advantage of thier.

personal advice in matters relating to any specific sub-.

sequent projects.

The countries that would seem to offer the most prou-

1sing opportunities for

are PERU, CHILE, ARGENTINA.

URUGUAY, BRAZIL and VENEZUELA. Fortunately, we have already

established certain minimal tles: with most of these countries.

but it would be best for Lopez himself to become personally

acquainted with our contacts therein.

in order to save time and money, 1t would se advisable

to visit all these countries in a single round-the-nemisphere

In addition to any use involving special trips to Latin America.

He

subjects were discussed:

we went to dinner where the following

a. LEP pointed out clearly that he was "the boss" and responsible

for TICHBORN's operational utilization. TICHBORN was told that

Gaut is responsible for the

commercläl setup. There appeared to

be no doubt in his mind as to who calls the shots.

b. TICHBORN was told of our need for an experienced Latin

However, he was apparently very much interested in the

He will check into the availability of the Dominican Republic papers

following lines: Analyze the Bosch anti-government statements for

indications of whom he is trying to reach, how, and for what reason

(since june 15). Similarly analyze the Balaguer statements and determine:

1) Influences the news media is having on his public image.

2) Where and how could he strengthen this image.

3) What issues should be raised or surpressed.

It was suggested that the try to get issues of El Caribe and Listin Diario!

3. LEP's initial impressions of TICHBORN were as follows: He is very

intelgent and in addition is "sharp". He has a professionally smooth and

friendly manner.

Re is a natural politican. He is an "operator"' and will

collaborate very closely and enthusiastically so long as there is real benefit

in it for him.

He is probably sensitive to his Mexicai-American ancestory as

indicated by his obvious annoyances (albeit presented jokingly) at the fact that

in the six weeks he has worked there.

He is probably not a detalise man

and is impressed by social position and wealth and consequently likes to

function on a high level. Although there is no real reason to belleve that

TICHBORN may see another career ahead, LEP feels there is a possibility

that

will try to hire him for his company or he may make contacts:

in New York City which could lead to his getting a non-ClA job.

DOC. MICH=. SER.

Edward G. TICHBORN spent June 1 and 2 in the Headquarters area and

departed the noring of 3 June for an overnight stop in Dallas before his

return for toxico City.

Prior to his departure, TICHBORN was advanced $100

which u1ll be Tad to the Station for final accounting.

2. Daring, his stopover here, he met with representatives of the

Dondnican Republic Desk as well as DYWUR Staff and Mexico Branch personnel,

In these debriefinzo ne touched specifically on hia activities in connection

#ith the Dominican Republic election, his estimate of the outcome of this

olections his plans for the future, particularly hia departure from Mexico;

the termination of LIPEAM; and his proposal for the contimation of his

relationship with KUBARK.

- B. Dorindean Republic Flection:

Although MICHBORN painted a rather bleak picture of the possible

results of the elcction,

his comments concerning the situation

pertaining at the time of his departure from the island contributed

to Readquarters understanding of developments in the daya immodiately

preceding the election and on the election day. The DYVOUR Stall

representative and the Dominican Hepublic Branch representatives

specifically commended MICRORN for the excellent work he had done

during his temporary assignment to the Dominican Republic in connection

hd th

this election operation.

D. ITCHBORN Futures

We discussed TICHBOPNia personal situation and desires for the

future at some length. Although not being able to offer specific

prondses of long-term employment on his terms at thia time, we adviaed

him that the Agency would probably havo recurring requirements, albedt relatitels

infrequent, for a man with his talents and experience.

However, the

limited roquirement for such specialized activity in the DYVOUR

area

1.

Project LICOLIC has been renewed for Fiscal Year 1966 1n

the amount

of

$19,000 as requested.

This approval was effective

2 March 1966.

2.

As you are aware there has been a good deal of discussion

here concerning

TICHSORN's operational activities and how he might

best contribute to the overall objectives of the Station.

It was

agreed during EDGEBROOK's visit here (See Ref B) that TICHBORN

would be considered henceforth as a full time Station asset and

attention would be given to gaining maxinun value from his continued

Within this context, however, it should also

be noted that this

presence in MexiCO project was reneved for Fiscal Year 1966 with

the condition that ".., prior to the end of the current fiscal

year (1966), adequate cover is found to afford TICHBORN not only

the needed mobility and safeguards for his work in behalf of the

Mexico Station, but also for his possible third country political

action assignments.

".

In addition, the following recommendation

was made in the event Project LIREd should not be renewed & which

should not really be considered at present since agreement was

If this turns out

to be the case we would reconnend that TICHBORN be reassigned to

another area (suggest ZIETAL) under the typé of cover (e.g.

JATUBA)

which would offer hin the needed mobility and protection for area-

Needlesa to say, although

the latter point sould bo kept in

the Branch believes that the LIREAN publication has in

proved and has a good chance to gain acceptance and expand its

Influence throughout the hemisphere.

and

This being the casê Mexico

as Station plang for expanding TICHBORN'g activity within

take form, we hope his contribution to KUBARK objectives in Mexico

and thoughout Latin America will becone more substantial and

recognized.

3.

Ag a matter of infornation, Headquarters would appreciate

TICHBORN preparing

a sunnary of his present cover situation, par-

ticularly his

appreciation of his present residence and work

status

in Mexico, aud his estimate of what the future holds for

him 1n

this regard. Further, we would appreciate any indication

the Station may have concerning TICHBORN's personal plans in regard

to bis continued residence in Mexico and his future relitionship
