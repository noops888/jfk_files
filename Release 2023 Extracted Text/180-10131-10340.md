FACTUAL BACKGROUND.

The Tarasoffs do not remember identifying the voices

of any of the

people with whom Oswald spoke prior to the assassination. They do not

remember ever being asked to do so after the assassination. They do

not remember ever being questioned

before being contacted by HSCA

investigators.

## Page 6

FACTUAL BACKGROUND

The Tarasoffs claim to remember translating and transcribing at least 2

conversations involving Oswald. They remember that the first one was fairly

short and routine. Oswald did not identify himself in this first conver

sation. The second one was much longer and Oswald did identify himself

in this conversation. The Tarasoffs remember Oswald discussing his finan-

cial situation in this call. They deny making any editorial or marginal

comments in the transcription of this call.

The Tarasoffs remember nothing unusual about the first call or the

circumstances around its delivery or transcription. The second call was

delivered to them and they were asked to transcribe the Oswald call as

quickly as possible. Their contact expressed a strong interest in the

identity of the caller and the substance of the call. The Tarasoffs

translated and transcribed the call and returned the transcript on the

same day, using an emergency contact as opposed to waiting until the next

morning and using their standard contact.

It is not clear whether or not the Tarasoffs have any independent

memory of any other calls involving Oswald.

Exhibits are classified and will be added at a later date. Questions

based on these exhibits will be asked.

BIOGRAPHY

BORIS DIMITRY TARASOFF

Boris Dimitry Tarasoff was born on 2 November 1908 in Yekaterinoslaw,.

Russia. He emigrated to the United States. He worked for the Central

Intelligence Agency from circa 1955 to October 1970. He was stationed

in Mexico City from June 1963 to October 1970. Mr. Tarasoff's main task

during this period was translation/transcription of Russian language

tapes. He is currently retired and living at the Rancho Contento,

Guadalajara, Mexico.

ANNA TARASOFF

Anna Tarasoff was born on 5 May 1923.

She is the wife of Boris

Dimitry Tarasoff. She worked as a part time CIA contract officer. She

assisted her husband in the translation/transcription of the Russian

language tapes.

FACTUAL BACKGROUND.

Boris and Anna Tarasoff were stationed in Mexico City in 1963.

They were the Russian translators used to translate and transcribe the

Russian language portions of surveillance tapes. Hence, they have actual

knowledge of a portion of that operation.

In an interview with members of this staff the Tarasoffs said that

the tapes and Spanish language transcripts would be delivered to them on

the morning of one day by a person who worked on this operation. The next

day the Tarasoffs would return the tape, Spanish transcript and the completed

translation/transcript of the Russian language portions. The Tarasoffs

said that they made an original copy and two carbons of every transcription.

The original and one copy was retained by the Tarasoffs. One carbon was

turned over to their contact.

Mr. Tarasoff also said that he was responsible for trying to identify,

by their voices, the Soviet Embassy personnel involved in conversations

which he transcribed.

The Tarasoffs, by the nature of their involvement in the operation, should

have some knowledge of some of the other individuals involved in this oper-

ation.

The Tarasoffs said that the transcripts they prepared were literal

transcriptions as opposed to summaries. They said that they made no marginal

comments on the body of the transcripts.

Mr. Tarasoff was assisted in translating and transcribing the tapes by

his wife, Anna Tarasoff.

Richard A. Sprague

FROM: Kenneth E. Brooten, Jr.

IN RE:

Contacts with Ambassador John Joseph Jova, U. S. Embassy Mexico

City and Thomas Polgar, CIA Station Chief, Mexico City.

1.

I Initially met with William Calderhead, Deputy Chief of Mission

U. S.

Embassy, Mexico City and advised him of the following:

a)

I had received information from the Committee Staff indicating

that someone had contacted them advising that the Cuban Embassy

personnel in Mexico City would be willing to meet with us and

provide us with the information which they had on Lee harvey

Oswald.

b)

I had not been advised of the source of the information by

the Committee Staff and I did not know the reliability of

the source.

2.

c)

I had discussed the matter with you for "instructions" and

had been advised by you that I should take the matter up with

the Ambassador.

Mr. Calderhead suggested that we make a formal contact through the

Department of State and have them go through the Swiss, since the

Swiss represent the interest of the U. S. Government in Havana.

I met with Ambassador Jova at his residence on December 2, 1976, and

advised him of the foregoing. I also advised that while the Committee

would be most interested in obtaining any information we could from

were very much aware of the complications which could

arise should the information prove to be erroneous.

I further advised the Ambassador that we did not want to do anything

which could cause embarrassment to the U. S. Government or the

Congress and that we wanted to proceed with his consent and advice.

The Ambassador advised:

a)

The official U. S. position is that there are to be no official

contacts with the Government of Cuba.

b)

He knows the Ambassador from Cuba on a social basis and could

make a discrete approach and inquiry.

c .

He would have to get "instructions" from Washington to make an

approach and inquiry from the cuban Ambassador.

d)

He very much appreciated our consulting with him since it was a

very delicate matter.

I suggested that possibly the C.I.A. could have some source either

direct or indirect which could verify whether or not the Cubans wanted

He stated that he had not discussed our visit with the C.I.A. Station

Chief but with my consent would do so. He offered to have the Station

Chief come to his residence or have us meet him at his residence.

I met with Thomas Polgar the C.I.A. Station Chief and advised him

of the situation and requested

his assistance and judgement.

He

advised:

a)

That some of his people had informal contacts with the Cubans

and could make an inquiry to see if a"responsible official"

of the Cuban Embassy would meet with us. To do so he would

have to get "instructions" from C.I.A. Headquarters - but at

my request he would proceed to do so.

b)

c)

He said that the Cubans would probably have to go to Havana

for "instructions" before they would reply. He further stated

that most of the information would probably be in Havana.

I asked if he had any other method of determining the validity

of the information and he said that he was not prepared to

confirm whether there were wiretaps at this time. Later in

the conversation he said as a result of the story - a copy of

which is attached that the Cubans had been saying less on the

phone.

d)

We agreed to meet with the Ambassador the next day to discuss

how to proceed.

On Friday, December 3, 1976, I again met with the Ambassador and Mr.

Polgar.

Mr. Polgar had not yet received a reply to his request for

"instructions," from C.I.A. Headquarters and again advised that the

Cubans would most likely go to Havana for "instructions" before

• replying.

Ambassador Jova said he would seek instructions from State on making

an informal social contact with the Cuban Ambassador but suggested

that that would take time.

He said the most proper method would be

to go through the Swiss and State here in Washington.

I advised that while we certainly wanted to obtain the information

that we wanted to use the most conservative approach so as not to

create an incident. The Ambassador again expressed his appreciation

• for our sensitivity to a "delicate situation.

ACTION TO BE TAKEN:

Contact C.I.A. Headquarters to follow up on Polgar's request

for "instructions."

b)

Contact the Department of State and request that they go through

the Swiss with a formal contact to the Cubans in Havana and follow

up on Ambassador Jova's request for instructions.

c)

Both of these follow up actions should, in my judgement,

be initiated immediately.

If we can confirm the contact with the Cubans it will be

necessary for me to return to Mexico City, and I would

purpose to do so as soon as we receive a confirmation.

Jonothan Blackmer accompanied me to each of the meetings....u

Specific Inquiry into the Identity of the Person

with whome Oswald spoke in the Two Phone Calls

Intercepted by the CIA in

Transcribed by Mr. and Mrs. Tarasoff.

On November 30, in Guadalajara, Mexico, Ken thought

it best that I ask some specific questions of the

Tarasoff's as to the identify of the person or persons

Oswald may have spoken with during the two telephone

conversations that were intercepted by the CIA and trans-

cribed by the Tarasoffs. I thought I should inquire of

the Tarasoffs about their knowledge of the voices of

the various employees of the Soviet Embassy in Mexico

City and the identity of the various KGB men, including

the dispute over the "Kostin" identify appearing in the

letter Oswald wrote to the Soviet Embassy in Washington

on November 8, 1963. The

following is a brief report

on the substance of that interrogation.

After three sessions with the Tarasoffs prior to

the taping of the session for transcription, we learned

that Mr. Tarasoff had been assigned to the Mexico City

NW 64937 Docld:32277225 Page 18

---

## Page 19

-2-

desk for the express purpose of translating and transcribing

conversations in the Russian language going into and out

of the Soviet Embassy by telephone. In the course of

their employment, the Tarasoffs became familiar with

the voices of the Russians and could instantly identify

the names of many of the Russians within the embassy

when their voices were heard. Mr. Tarasoff even went

so far as to put together his own scrapbook with pictures

and newspaper clippings of his "Russians" so that he

could become as familiar as possible with their identity

and background, deemed essential by Mr. Tarasoff to under-

stand the content of the conversation by the voice

inflection. That is to say, knowledge of the region

these various Russians came from would aid greatly in

identifying the context of the conversations when various

idioms and colloquialisms were used. In short, Mr. and

Mrs. Tarasoff did their jobs well and in many cases were

innovators — always toward the goal of proficiency.

Mr. Tarasoff came up with the idea of voice sample

tapes to be indexed by identity for use whenever the need

might arise to compare voices or a dispute as to identity

of voices. But all voices whether identified or not were

indexed. Mr. Tarasoff brought this up with Herb Mannell

and was given permission to make these identity tapes.

NW 64937 Docld:32277225 Page 19

## Page 20

= 3=

Mr

Tarasoff knew the voices of Yatskov, Kostikov,

Kanstantinov among others. He did not, however, know

of any of these men!s proficiency in English, but felt

that only Kostikov and Kanstantinov could handle English

well enough to speak it in a cursory fashion.

Based on

this they formed the opinion that Kanstantinov was more

than likely the person to which Oswald spoke, unless

there was another individual not known to the Tarasoffs,

with whom Oswald may

have spoken. It is of interest to

note that while the Russians almost exclusively spoke

Russian with each other and many Embassy employees spoke

Spanish, very few, Boris believes probably only Kostikov

and Kanstantinov spoke English well enough to get by.

Additionally, because of this fact, Boris was not as:

proficient at identifying his Russians when they spoke

English since the voice sounds entirely different, almost

mechanical when the Russians were speaking English.: They

do not believe Oswald spoke with Yatskov or Kostikov on

the occasion of the two telephone calls transcribed by

the Tarasoffs.

One thing is certain, Mr. Tarasoff was the expert

on the station in Mexico City when Oswald called the Soviet

Embassy from the Cuban Embassy.

Mr. Tarasoff succeeded

George Misko who was in Mexico City in the same function as

Mr. Tarasoff. Mr. Tarasoff was never asked who Oswald

NW 64937 Docld:32277225 Page 20

---

## Page 21

- 4-

spoke with, never identified the person with whom Oswald

spoke, nor ever was asked anything about the incident.

Mr. Tarasoff had on other occasions been asked to identify

voices, and has had tapes returned to him on other occasions

for that purpose. Both the Tarasoffs feel the information

contained in the October 16, 1963 memo was

not the complete

and relevant as to the substance of the telephone conversations.

that the Tarasoff's transcribed.

Thus we are faced with the issue of why when Boris

was the expert, heard the tape pursuant to his function,

was the best person qualified to identify the Russians

by their voices, why was he never consulted by anyone before

or after the assassination as to the substance of the phone

calls and the person with whom Oswald spoke. Yet the

Warren Commission Report states that Oswald contacted

Kostikov or Yatskov and based on this other information

(presumably from Duran) and in answer to the questions posed

by Oswald's letter to the Soviet Embassy in Washington in

which Oswald mentions having contacted Kostin. The

Tarasoffs do not feel Kostin is the short form of Kanstantinov

or Kostikov. nor do they know a Kostin. Boris knew

Kostikov and Kanstantinov and Yatskov were KGB and knew the

voices of Yatscov and Kostikov and Kanstantinov. When the

NW 64937 Docld:32277225 Page 21

## Page 22

first call came in Boris was notified that the station

was extremely interested in the identity of the caller.

That when the second call came, the tape was rushed to

Boris and when Oswald was identified the contact

(probably Bright) seemed extremely interested and excited.

Tarasoff typed transcripts

verbatim, since at one point,

unlike Misko, his predecessor, Tarasoff made a summary of

a meaningless conversation and made his own comments to that

effect, and was jumbed on by Bill Bright for so doing.

Tarasoff did not make comments on transcripts except for

using M.I. for man inside and M.O. for man outside when

they were readily identifiable. Boris feels that if at

the time had he been

asked about the Oswald calls, he would

have been able to supply much more information, but 14 years

has dimmed his memory and no one, not even Bright, his

contact, discussed the subject with him.

In a separate interview with Mr. Tarasoff on November

30, 1976, I learned that the photographic expert on station

in Mexico City in 1963 September to November was Bob

Zambernardi. Zambernardi's office telephone in Mexico City

is possibly 24-28-85 and his home number in Mexico City

is possibly 20-36-15. Zambernardi is married to the daughter

of one Mrs. Minor who lives at Coyocan # 10 - in Colonia del

Vajae, which is a suburb of Mexico City. The phone number

is possibly 23-00-78. Zambernardi was probably the man in

charge of photographing the activities of both the Cuban

and Soviet embassies in

1963.

Having a copy of Coup d'etat in America with me.

I thought I would ask the Tarasoffs if they could identify

any of the photographs in the book. Specifically,

photographs

of the bums arrested in Dallas on the day

of the assassination. Three photographs of Howard Hunt,

two photographs of Frank Sturgis. I asked whether the

Tarasoffs knew any of these men either professionally

or socially. The Tarasoffs were unable to identify any

of the photographs, nor could they recall seeing any of

the individuals in Mexico City or anywhere else. However,

I got the feeling that Boris indicated a faint glimmer

of recognition when I showed him the picture of Eugene

Edgar Bradley which appears: on page 222 of the text. I

don't know whether Boris knew this man and as he stated

he did not and as his credibility, in my opinion, is very

high, I think the man probably resembles someone Boris might

have known. They could not recall having known Howard Hunt

in Mexico City nor having seen him. These photographs

came from pages 208 through 223 of the above book.

We also went over photographs of the mysterious man

leaving the Soviet Embassy. The Tarasoffs had their own

copies of these photos supplied by Ron Kessler. While

the Tarassofs thought they were all of the same man on

NW 64937 Docld:32277225 Page 23

two different occasions, they could not positively identify.

them.

Mr Tarasoff felt the man was Russian, and that

he was wearing clothing one would wear on a fishing trip.

Mr. Tarasoff noted the Russians were crazy about fishing.

He felt the first photograph was blocked in such

a way

as to make the man appear much heavier than he really

was, but in comparing all the photographs with his

personal file of photos and newspaper clips, he could

not match them. The first photograph we were referring

to is the one that just shows the head and shoulders of

a man in a dark sweater. He did however feel that

one photo looked a lot like Alfredeyev, Soviet KGB, but felt

the mystery man was much heavier. I have no photo of

Alfredeyev, but he looks a little like the french film

star Yves Montand.

I would recommend following this lead by first

interviewing Charles Flick, then George Misko, then

Bill Bright, then Robert Zambernardi, then Clark Anderson,

then Herb Mannell, and then possibly, Sylvia Duran to

pick up the thread.

1.

We initially had reservations to depart on an American Airlines

Flight at 7:15 a.m. on Sunday, November 28, 1976. Jonathan had

called American to confirm the fact that we only had to show our

official passports to get a tourist visa for Mexico.

We arrived

at the airport at 6:30 a.m. and were advised that they could not

issue Mexican Tourist Cards on Official Passports. I called the

operations desk at the Department of State who said the Official

Passport was proof of American Citizenship and that should be

sufficient.

American Airlines employees would not accept that

so rather

than create a confrontation as to who we were we took

a later flight and traveled on our personal passports.

Upon our arrival in Mexico City we. were met by William J. Roche,

the Chief of Security for the Embassy. The Embassy had reserved

rooms for us.

On Monday, November 29, 1976, Mr. Roche made airline reservations

for us to Guadaialara - it is a l hour flight and approximately

hotel and offered us the use of his personal vehicle.

4.

We made initial contact with Boris Tarasoff at approximately 3:30 p.m.

His wife was not at home and had been in Guadajalara for 5 or 6 days

at their daughters taking care of her sick children. Our interview

with Mr. Tarasoff lasted until approximately 9:00 p.m. when we went

to Guadajalara to meet with his wife. We interviewed her until

approximately 11:00 p.m.

Mr .

Tarasoff: The fifth of June, 1963.

Mr. Brooten: All right, sir. And, were you on temporary

assignment then or what?

Mr. Tarasoff: No, that was to be my permanent assignment.

By permanent, I mean that you put in two years. And if you

are not satisfactory, they ship you back.

Mr. Brooten: All right.

Mr. Tarasoff:

But I managed to survive for about eight

years in the same capacity.

Who did you relieve in

Mr. Tarasoff: George Miscow was my predecessor.

Mr. Brooten: And where did you work specifically when

Mr. Tarasoff: I don't know which department.

Mr. Brooten:

Was it with, were you a translator sir?

Mr. Tarasoff: I was translator and transcriber

at the

same time.

There is a difference, sometimes they use two

people for those two jobs.

Mr. Brooten: All right. And your duties when you came

down in June of 1963 then were as transcriber and translater.

Mr. Tarasoff: Right.

Mr. Brooten: At the station in Mexico City?

Mr. Tarasoff: Right.

Mr. Brooten: All right sir. Now following, how long

did you work inside the station in Mexico Station?

Mr. Tarasoff:

Oh, that was on TDY in 1960.

Mr. Brooten: All right, in 1960 you worked in the station.

In June of 1963, where did you work?

Mr. Tarasoff: Well, in the house that was rented.

Mr.

And, was that in Mexico

Mr.

That was in Mexico City.

Mr. Brooten: All right sir. Do you recall the address

of that house.

Mr. Tarasoff: That was 312, I think.

Wasn't it? San

Mr. Brooten: All right sir. Did any officials at the

American Embassy have that address to know, to contact you?

Mr. Tarasoff: They certainly did have it because they

were delivering stuff to me?

Mr. Brooten: All right sir. Now, did you work at that

address with anyone else in the translation and the transcribing

of things that we'll

get into and identify a little bit later

on. Did anyone else work with you directly.

Mr. Tarasoff: Directly, just my wife was helping me

out until she was put on official status.

Yes sir.

Well, I want to know what you

Mr. Tarasoff: First, I received a mountain of tapes

left over from the previous

transcriber.

Mr.

Brooten: All right.

Mr.

Tarasoff: And I think they were delivered by

Bob (Zumbanardi spelling?)

Mrs. Tarasoff: Yes, he was the first one.

Mr. Brooten: All right.

MI •

Tarasoff: The first one, but since he had other

duties, I suppose they took the Rudy character.

Mr. Brooten: All right, and you don't know Rudy's

last name?

Mr.

Tarasoff: No.

That's what I say.

There is some

association in my mind with the name of Bruno.

Mr. Brooten: Bruno? Would you describe, as best you

can, the physical characteristics of?

Mr. Tarasoff:

Well, he was rather tall.

Mr. Brooten:

All right sir.

Mr. Tarasoff: Slim and probably stooped a little bit,

with sandy hair.

Mrs. Tarasoff:

receding a little bit.

Mr.

Tarasoff:

No particular distinguishing features.

Mr. Brooten: All right. Did he. How old a man was he

about at that time.

Mr. Tarasoff: About 45 I'd say.

Mr. Brooten:

Did he have any children.

Mr. Tarasoff:

He had two.

Two boys.

MI.

Brooten:

And, was, he was married?

Mr. Tarasoff: He

was married to a French woman who

abandoned him or divorced him or just run away from him.

Because he wasn't supportable in private life.

Mr. Brooten: Now, did you receive tapes from anyone

else, other than Mr. Flick or this rudy or the individual

that you named previously that delivered a bunch of them

to you.

Did you receive tapes from anyone else?

Mr. Tarasoff:

Well, not at the same time. But after.

Mr. Brooten: All right.

Mr. Tarasoff:

Oh, what's his name.

Mr. Brooten: Mr. Bright.

Mr. Tarasoff:

Yes, Bill Bright

Mr. Brooten:

small ones.

Mrs. Tarasoff:

The two girls.

Well, I think they had two youngsters.

Mr. Tarasoff: Typical Anglo-Saxon type.

MrS.

Tarasoff: Blondish hair, sandy hair.

Mr.

Tarasoff: I told him. He was driving in a Volkeswagen.

We have pictures of him.

Mr. Brooten:

Now, would you tell me how Mr. Bright

would deliver the tapes. Do you know where the tapes came

from.

Mr. Tarasoff:

Well, at first, no. I didn't know.

MT :

Brooten:

tapes came from?

Did you ever subsequently learn where the

Mr. Tarasoff:

Subsequently, yes. During my last two years

or three years.

I don't recollect exactly when.

Mr. Brooten: All right. But can you now state where

those tapes came from?

Mr. Tarasoff: Now I can, I have a very good idea where

NW 64937 Docld:32277225 Page 35

## Page 36

-11-

Mr. Tarasoff: they came from.

MX .

Brooten:

All right sir, where did they come from?

• Mr. Tarasoff: It was a house that had several recording

machines

set up.

The address I don't know.

Mr. Brooten:

All right, but they were tapes of telephone

taps were they?

Mr. Tarasoff: Yes.

Mr. Brooten: All right. And you did the specific ones

to and from the Soviet Embassy.

Mr. Tarasoff: Right.

Mr. Brooten: Now, would you describe for me the procedure

to the best of your recollection, whereby the tapes were

taken from the house where they were initially recorded, and

how they got to you? What was the chain of.

Mr. Tarasoff: I know one thing that, for instance let's

say that Bill Bright, he would pick them up. I don't know

whether he would pick them up from Charlie.

NW 64937 Docld:32277225 Page 36

## Page 37

-12-

Mr. Brooten:

Now Charlie is?

MI .

Tarasoff: Charlie Flick

Mr. Brooten: And Charles Flick was, what was his job?

Mr. Tarasoff: He was actually, supervising the workings

of this tape record listen. If anything went wrong, he was

the fellow who would fix it. If he couldn't, then he would

send them back probably to Washington to be fixed. Gotten

new ones.. How many times I argued with him, and I said,

my gosh, give me a better machine because it's breaking down.

He says, well, we don't have any more. But eventually, I would

get something decent out of him.

Mr .

Brooten: Do you know whether or not Mr. Flick

monitored both the Cuban and the Soviet wiretaps from this

one safe house that you've described?

Mr. Tarasoff: Well, I would say that he was monitoring

them because his Spanish wasn't too hot.

Mr. Brooten: I guess, were the tape recordings made

from

of the conversations / the Cuban Embassy at this same place?

Mr. Tarasoff: I imagine so.

NW 64937 Docld:32277225 Page 37

Mr.

Brooten:

All right sir.

Mr. Tarasoff:

Because there were quite a number of

people working there.

Mr. Brooten: All

right sir. And, were there people

working there all employees, were they Americans or were

they Mexican nationals or?

Mr.

Tarasoff: I think they were mostly Mexican

nationals.

Mr. Brooten: All right. But they worked for the CIA

in the interception of these communications?

Mr. Tarasoff: I imagine so,

of course.

Mr. Brooten: All right.

Did you ever personally go

to the safe house?

Mr. Tarasoff: I did

Mr. Brooten: And how often did you go there?

Mr. Tarasoff: Not less than once, maybe twice.

Mr. Brooten: All right sir

Mr. Tarasoff: As I recollect, but that was in connection

with the defection of (Russian - name on tape but unable

to identify)

Mr. Brooten: I see.

of President Kennedy?

Was that after the assassination

Mr. Tarasoff: Oh yes.

Mr. Brooten: Now, with respect to, I call your attention

to September of 1963, some thirteen years ago, you were

going to describe for me or I had asked you then I interrupted

myself, the procedure whereby Mr. Bright brought you the

tapes from the safe house.

Would he call you on the phone?

Mr. Tarasoff: Let's put it that way.

I am not sure

that Bill was there at that time.

Mr. Brooten: All right.

Mr. Tarasoff: It could have been either Bob, which I

doubt, most likely it was Rudy.

Mr. Brooten: All right. And Rudy, you don't remember

his last name but you've described him for me.

NW 64937 Docld:32277225 Page 39

Mr. Tarasoff: The only name that I could faintly tie

in with him would be Bruno, but I'm not sure it's his name.

Mr. Brooten: All right sir, now how would you go about

getting, how would be these tapes be brought to you, or would

you pick them up?

Mr. Tarasoff: No. We woüld make a certain, how would

you say, a chain of posts where we would meet.

Mr. Brooten: All right.

Mr. Tarasoff: Let's. say, today we would meet at this,

we tried to break it up because if you come to one place

everyday at the same time (mumbling) that would bungle your

hands, it looks suspicious, doesn't it?

Mr. Brooten: All right. Now Mr. Tarasoff, do you, were

these tapes brought to you in briefcases or?

Mr. Tatasoff: At first they were brought in briefcases.

I told them, my gosh, you could be robbed, it happened once

someplace I heard about. So I said, let's make it as incon-

spicuous

as we possibly can. So I started putting them in

the brown shopping bag.

Mr. Brooten:

And you would meet either Rudy or Bill

Mr. Tarasoff: At the appointed place of (mumble)

Mr. Brooten:

pick up the tapes.

At the appointed place, and you would

Mr. Tarasoff: Many a time this, I had it out with Bill

because I'm standing waiting, waiting and nobody shows up. Of

course I can't wait too long. 15 minutes I said, 15 minutes

that's all you get. So I'll go back to the house and then

in about 5 minutes he barges in and says, where the hell were

you, I was looking all over for you. I said, I was standing

there waiting for you. So.

Mr. Brooten: All right, now sir, do you recall receiving

tapes in September of 1963 of any intercepts of telephone

communications with the Soviet Embassy?

Mr.

Tarasoff: Yes, I do.

Mr. Brooten: All right, and did you ever receive one

in which an individual called

the Soviet Embassy, and said he

wanted. to talk

to him and you later had another telephone

intercept on the same individual?

NW 64937 Docld:32277225 Page 41

## Page 42

-17-

Mr.

Tarasoff: Yes, we had that.

Mr. Brooten: All right, now when you received the tapes,

would you describe for me to the best of your recollection,

how you went about transcribing and translating them, would

you listen with ear phones and type, or what?

Mr. Tarasoff:

Well, we were furnished with earphones

because if you turned it up at full blast, the neighbors

will wonder what the heck is going on.

Mr. Brooten: All right.

Mr. Tarasoff:

So, we had the earphones, and then what

would do is first, with the tapes would come the Spanish

transcripts.

Mr. Brooten: All right, now would you describe what it

looked like, how many copies of it and so on?

Mr. Tarasoff: Well, we had the one copy of it, right?

Just the yellow sheets, one copy, say for instance, Spanish

starts at number 3, that means you would run the tape for

three feet and Spanish starts, which didn't interest us

because it had already been transcribed.

Mr. Brooten:

Okay.

NW 64937 Docld:32277225 Page 42

---

## Page 43

-18-

Mr. Tarasoff: So, but then as you go along, it says

there, Russo.

One of the spanish transcribers would put down

Russian and I would watch out for the number in front of it.

If it says 137 I would let machine run until it hits 137 on

the counter.

Mrs. Tarasoff: Give or take a few minutes.

Mr. Tarasoff: I would start the machine and start

listening to the conversation in Russian and then while I'm

listening I'm transcribing at the same time.

Mr. Brooten: All right, so you were translating and

then

transcribing at the same time.

Mr. Tarasoff: That's right, at the same time.

Mr. Brooten: And how did your wife assist you in this?

Mr. Tarasoff:

Well, she assisted me mostly whenever

the conversation came in English, and sometimes I wouldn't

catch the proper inflection or else. Well she knows

English better than I do, let's put it that way.

Mrs. Tarasoff: Then too, if there was anybody that had

a slight southern accent, there slight difference of speech

was pretty hard for him to pick up what they were saying.

NW 64937 Docld:32277225 Page 43

## Page 44

-19-

Mr.

Brooten: All right. Did you type things in rough

and then your wife retyped them on any occasion?

Mr. Tarasoff: Oh no, that would be a double job

absolutely unnecessary.

Mr. Brooten: So you just sat down and listened to

the tape and typed it.

Mr. Tarasoff: That's right. If it ran away I would

stop it and typed what I heard and then start it up again and

proceed.

• Mr. Brooten:

All right, like a transcriptionist would

listening to a dictaphone tape?

Mr. Tarasoff:

yes.

Mr. Brooten: All right. Now, do you recall, specifically,

having received a tape, getting back to my question that I

interrupted myself for, in which a person who you subsequently

learned was Lee Harvy Oswald, called the Soviet Embassy. Do

you recall transcribing that tape?

Mr. Tarasoff: Yes, more or less.

NW 64937 Docld:32277225 Page 44

## Page 45

- 20-

Mr. Brooten: Do you, to the best of your recollection,

remember whether or not that conversation between the person

who subsequently identified himself as Lee Harvy Oswald to

the Soviet Embassy, was the conversation in Russian or was

it a conversation in English?

Mr. Tarasoff: In English, that's why I put her on.

Mr. Brooten: Now, do you recall the essence of that

conversation, was there anything unusual about that conver-

sation that provoked any type of further action or further

interest on the part of anyone in the Embassy?

Mr .

Tarasoff: Do you refer to the previous conversation?

Mr. Brooten: To the first conversation.

Mr. Tarasoff: Previous one, I don't think there was

anything to be

gained from it. I think it was rather short

and he was asking, do you remember?

Mrs. Tarasoff: As I recall, trying to rely on memory

for that many years, his first conversation, he was just

trying to make contacts to see if he could get into the

Russian Embassy.

NW 64937 Docld:32277225 Page 45

## Page 46

• -21-

Mr. Brooten: All right, do you recall the tone of

his voice or how, do you have an impression from listening

to that tape about?

Mrs. Tarasoff: Well I would say at the first one that

came out, it was taken as just an ordinary conversation

that he wanted most others, is there anyone who speaks

English, and they'd say just a minute and they'a try to get

a hold of someone, in the meantime you're waiting, and they'd

say well at the time there is no one here that could speak

English, call back later. Well then, I don't know whether

he finally hung up or if he did get to talk to somebody at

that time or not, but the final, the other conversation that

came throught, the long one.

Mr. Brooten: But, with respect to the first one now,

is it your recollection, or to the best of your knowleage,

did he identify himself in the first conversation as being

Lee Oswald or being Lee Harvey Oswald, did he identify himself

in any way? In the first conversation.

Mrs. Tarasoff:

No. I think in the first conversation

he was just trying to see if he could speak to someone at the

Embassy•

Mr. Brooten: All right. And now you both stated that

NW 64937 Docld:32277225 Page 46

---

## Page 47

-22-

Mr. Brooten:

there was a second long conversation

between the first conversation and the second conversation,

were you

asked to attempt to determine the identity of this

person?

Mr. Tarasoff: Oh yes.

Mr. Brooten: All right, would you describe that.

Mr. Tarasoff: Well, to the best knowledge, we either

got the note or was it passed it verbally, I think we got

a note, no?

Mrs. Tarasoff: Well, if I'm not mistaken, the party

that brought the reels, there was a notation made to listen.

to number so-and-so on tape so-and-so dated. whatever date it

was, because each reel had a date and a number and according

to the numbers then there were, the transcripts of each

conversation within that had a number, so you ran the .

tape until you came to a certain number and then you listened.

Mr. Brooten: Now, did they want you to or did they give

you any instructions about attempting to determine who the

caller was in that case?

Mr. Tarasoff: Yes, they certainly did. They wanted to

know the name of the person. Then if we. learned the name

NW 64937 Docld:32277225 Page 47

## Page 48

-23-

Mr. Tarasoff: to get in touch with them immediately •

and turn in the transcript, to make a transcript, turn it in

forget about Spanish, Russian or whatever it was on the reel-

Mrs. Tarasoff: In other words, this was top priority

if we got the name, to work on it.

Mr. Tarasoff: It was very important to them.

Mr. Brooten: All right sir. Now did you receive

a second tape with this same individual speaking to anyone

at the Soviet Embassy?

Mr. Tarasoff:

Well that's, you mean the third conver-

sation?

Mr. Brooten: All right, no but there was a second

one.

Mr. Tarasoff: the long one, yes.

Mr. Brooten: The long one. Now, would you describe,

I realize we do not have a copy of the transcript of that,

but would you describe, to the best of your recollection, how

you received that particular transcript, when you received it,

was it in the morning, the tape.

NW 64937 Docld:32277225 Page 48

## Page 49

Mr .

Tarasoff: In the morning, with the usual batch

of tapes that were delivered to me.

Mr. Brooten: All right.

Mr .

Tarasoff: This one particular was singled out

as a very important one and they wanted to have the transcript

as soon as possible.

Mr. Brooten: All right. And did you start to listen,

would you describe specifically with respect to that tape

what you remember.'

Mr. Tarasoff: Well, as far as I know, I think my

wife remembers more than I do.

Mr. Brooten: All right.

Mr. Tarasoff: Because I think she is mistaken slightly

about my doing the transcript. I might have jotted down

several things in pencil but.

Mr. Brooten: All right, were the, was that tape also

in English.

Mr. Tarasoff: Well, that's it.

NW 64937 Docld:32277225 Page 49

Mr.

Brooten:

The tape was in English?

Mr. Tarasoff:

You mean with this particular tape?

Mr. Brooten:

The particular section of the tape of

a conversation between Lee Harvey Oswald and someone at the

Soviet Embassy was in English?

Mr. Tarasoff: Yes, that's why she was doing it.

Mr. Brooten: All right, now Mrs. Tarasoff, do you

recall that particular tape, the second long tape on Lee

Harvey Oswald in which he identified himself?

Mrs. Tarasoff: Yes I do. Because my husband asked me

if I would confirm what he had typed or transcribed I should

say, from the tape, which I did, I listened, and we both

got the same feeling that this was something that should be

turned in immediately, and if I'm not mistaken to rely on

my memory, that he also had given his name, who the party

was -

Mr. Tarasoff: They wanted the name, definitely.

Mrs. Tarasoff: They asked, they usually ask who's calling,

and he identified himself. And in this way we felt that

it was really top priority-to be notified to our contact, and

NW 64937 Docld:32277225 Page 50

## Page 51

-26-

Mrs. Tarasoff: they in turn came by and picked it

up and once it left our hands, why from there on we don't

know what happened.

Mr. Brooten: All right, but now I want to go back

and ask you some

specific questions relating to that tape.

Do you recall who, which one of you would have put that

tape on the reel? Put that reel on the recording machine?

Mr. Tarasoff: I usually do.

Mr. Brooten: All right.

Mrs.

Tarasoff: That's his work.

Mr. Brooten: All right. And then you listened to it

and you typed?

Mr. Tarasoff: No, I asked her to sit down to listen

to it and to type it out.

Mr. Brooten: And do you recall, Mrs. Tarasoff, which

typewriter you would have used in typing it out?

Mrs. Tarasoff: Well, now wait a minute.

If Boris was

transcribing it and it was English, he would probably have

NW 64937 Docld:32277225 Page 51

## Page 52

-27-

Mrs. Tarasoff: transcribed it and typed it.

But then

listening to it again, there may have been some corrections

or certain, as I said, sometimes.

Mr.

Tarasoff: No you typed it out.

Mrs. Tarasoff: I typed it.

Well, all right if I

typed it out then I typed it out on the typewriter that

you always used.

Mr. Tarasoff: Which one, the standard one or the.

Mrs. Tarasoff: The one which was issued to you.

Mr. Tarasoff: Yes, are you sure it wasn't our portable?

Mrs. Tarasoff: Or it could have been the portable

because, you know, sometimes if the typewriter went you used

the portable. Cause we had quite a few breakdowns with

the equipment that we had to work with.. It was a little

sort of.

MI. Brooten: Okay, but do you recall typing

that.

Mrs. Tarasoff: Well it would be me, I would say it

would be me because Boris would have difficulty picking up

Mrs. Tarasoff: anybody that had a slight,

as I said,

accent, or muffled voice.

Mr. Brooten:

Do you recall the conversation Mrs.

Tarasoff, I don't want to be repetive but I want to make

it clear, do you recall that the

conversation was in English?

Mr. Tarasoff: Oh definitely.

Mr. Brooten: All right, and do you recall ever putting

anything in the transcript, any editorial comments about

Oswald's Russian being poor?

Mrs. Tarasoff: No way.

There were no comments made.

What was typed was what was being said by this individual.

Mr. Tarasoff: They want...•

Mrs. Tarasoff: Well, everything was typed, there was

nothing that was put in that would be our opinion or our

version of the conversion.

Mr. Brooten: Do you recall from listening to this

conversation

substance of the conversation whether you had any impresssion

about what type of person was making this call, was this

a nut or how would you describe the person making the call

Mr. Brooten: that identified himself as being

Lee

Harvey Oswald?

Mrs. Tarasoff: Well, I would describe him as just

being a person they wanted to get out of the country. I

mean he did not want to

stay in Mexico, that was certain.

He wanted to leave the country and he had no desire, he

did state that he did not want to return to the U.S. That

much I remember. So he was contacting one or two embassies

trying to get financial aid in order to Mexico City where

he was at the time. And where his final destination was

at that time, I don't know, because we never did get any

further information as to whether was given any financial

of any kind

aid/from either the Russians or the Cubans, I understand

he went to both.

Mr. Brooten: Do you recall whether or not he said

anything about he got to Mexico City or what his financial

status was of anything, I know I'm asking you to search your

memory, but do you recall anything about that?

Mrs.

Tarasoff: His financial status, at the time, if

I remember was, he did say he was broke.

Mr.

Brooten:

All right.

Mrs. Tarasoff: And he had very little money left.

and he was seeking financial aid to be transported to some

foreign country. And, the thing is I believe either if he

said it or we had read it in the paper then when it all came

out, cause the article did appear in a paper there, like

this news, that he did come down by bus. Now whether it

was mentioned in the transcript or whether I had read it in

the paper. So I won't commit myself that it was on the

transcript, but it was that I had...

Mr. Brooten: But to the best of your recollection,

is it fair to say that he wanted financial assistance.

Mrs. Tarasoff: Yes definitely.

Mr. Brooten;

That he told them that he didn't have

any money.

Mrs. Tarasoff: True. *

Mr. Brooten: All right. Do you remember, now I realize

again that we don't have the transcript before us and I'm

asking you to recall from your memory, but do you recall

his saying anything about giving them information in exchange.

for being transported out of Mexico?

Mrs. Tarasoff:

No. As far as

I can recollect there

was nothing said about any information, and beside, as far

as

I can recall he was without work.

Mr .

Brooten: All right.

Mr. Tarasoff: It's usually the nutty types that

always asks. Oh, can we get some more money for our

information, we can sell or stuff like this but I don't

think...

Mr.. Brooten: Would you describe Oswald from hearing

I assume a number of conversations over a number of years,

how would you characterize Oswald.

Mr. Tarasoff: I would say, judging from the tone

of his. voice I thought he was a very cool individual, he

was determined, he, how would you describe it, the picture

that I had of Oswald was like a coiled snake ready to strike.

That's what I really remember from the conversation.

He

sounded like he was quite angry about something. But, at

the same time he kept cool, but you could detect a note of

anger in his voice about something, whether he wasn't being

given a fair treatment by the people he was

talking to or

why, I couldn't say.

Mr. Brooten:

Do you recall whether he told the

Soviets that they really ought to him or anything to that

effect?

Mr. Tarasoff: No.

Mr. Brooten: You don't remember

Mrs.

Tarasoff: I wouldn't say that he

., he was

Mr. Brooten: Do you recall anything his asking about

what news about his visa or anything like that? Do you

recall any of that type of conversation?

Mr.

Tarasoff: No.

Mr. Brooten:

Ok.

NOW,

would you tell me - would you

describe for me the type of paper that this was typed on?

Mr. Tarasoff:

You mean...

MI. Brooten:

The transcript, was it plain white paper

or ...

Mr. Tarasoff: The top sheet would be just plain white

paper.

Mrs. Tarasoff:

Excuse me, the top sheet was U.s.

Mr. Tarasoff:

Oh, they didn't want us to use that.

Mr.

Brooten:

Yes, (laughter)

Mrs. Tarasoff: Nine times out of ten that's what

we wound up with. Until we had to go out and buy it on our

own.

Mr. Tarasoff: I was lugging a whole bunch of this

paper.

Mrs. Tarasoff: But, from the beginning, for a long

period of time, that's what you had to use so we went

out and started buying it on our own.

Mr. Tarasoff: Then two copies of ....

Mrs. Tarasoff: Carbon copies.

Mr. Brooten:

Two carbon copies, all right,

Mr. Tarasoff: Do you want to see it?

Mr •

Brooten:

Yes

Mr. Tarasoff:

Oh. I'll show you the type of paper

they used.

Mr. Brooten: Oh. all right, if we could have that.

Now, at any time in this conversation, did Lee Harvey Oswald,

were you able to identify to whom Oswald was speaking?

Mrs. Tarasoff: I, myself wouldn't because I had very

little contact with the transcribing of the reels. That would

actually be my husband's duties to recognize the voices.

Mr.. Brooten: Now if your husband recognized the voice-of

the person, the person inside, would he on the transcript

then identify that person.

Mrs. Tarasoff: Definitely, it would also be on the

transcript - so-and-so spoke to so-and

SO.

Mr. Brooten: That was a normal procedure then.

Is. Tarasoff: Yes, if you could identify the two

parties that were speaking to each other, then you were

also - you would also transcribe the names, include the

names in the transcript.

NW 64937 Docld:32277225 Page 59

## Page 60

Mr. Brooten: Now, if, in this case, do you recall

whether or not the person to whom Lee. Harvey Oswald was

speaking was identified.

Mrs. Tarasoff: I don't really know.

Mr. Brooten: All right.

Mrs. Tarasoff: Because If I was doing the typing of it

and if I came to it I would automatically re-run the reel

in order for Boris to listen to the - if he could recognize

who he was speaking to. I don't recall whether he did

recognize who he was speaking to or not. But there was

alike

also a close resemblance to several voices that sounded/in

the Embassy amongst the people who were speaking, so some-

times it was very hard to identify the people, I think

there was three that almost had the same tone of voice and

speaking habits.

Mr. Brooten:

Would it have been the normal procedure?

Mrs. Tarasoff: Well, it would sort. of be very easy to

let's say, weed out who the English speaking people were

because there were very few that spoke English, so ...

Mr. Brooten: But on this particular tape, do either

Mr.

Brooten:

of you remember being able to identify

the person to whom Lee Harvey Oswald was speaking.

Mr. Tarasoff: Unfortunately not.

Mr.

Brooten: All right sir. And you did not I take

it then, if you could not identify the person, that you would

not have put any name on the transcript of someone that he

had been speaking to?

Mr. Tarasoff: Do you remember putting any names on it?

Mrs. Tarasoff: Well, if you were not certain, you

would put the name and you would put it in parens and what

did we have a question mark?

Mr. Tarasoff: A question mark, I think

Mr. Brooten: Now if you couldn't identify the person,

what

would you put, what would you use, initials or...

Mr. Tarasoff: No. We just put down the men outside

or if the call comes in that's it the men outside. If

somebody calls from the Embassy and we don't know his name

we can't identify him or recognize his voice then we put

down MI or men inside.

Mr. Brooten: All right. Do you recall in this case

or if - strike that. We're going to have to change

tapes

here so let's go off the record and shut the tape

recorders off before they run down to the last. Ok we're

back on the record now after a break for lunch.

Mr. Brooten: Were either of you ever asked at any

time for your opinion as to the identity of the individual

to whom. Lee Harvey Oswald was speaking on that second tape?

Mr.

Tarasoff: I don't think anybody asked us that.

Mrs. Tarasoff: Well, if they asked me, I wouldn't know

because to begin with I never worked on the tapes constantly

to have any sufficient amount of time to recognize voices -

that would be Boris's, my husband's part, he would be the

one who would be able to identify whoever was speaking, if

it was possible to identify them.

Mr.

Brooten: Now, sir. You have shown some Huron

copysette papers, which is a carbon set, and you stated that

you made an original and 2 copies of all of your transcripts

that you had translated and transcribed. With respect to

the Oswald tape, did you do the same thing with that tape?

that is make

an original and 2 copies.

NW 64937 Docld:32277225 Page 62

Mr. Tarasoff: That's a rule.. We always did that.

Before it used to be three copies but then they saw

that

there was no need to make so many, so they came

• down to

the original and two copies.

Mr. Brooten: NOW

sir, do you recall what happened

to, do either of you recall what happened once you had

the second Oswald tape transcribed? What happened then

did you make a call to someone or what?

Mrs. Tarasoff: Well, after transcribing and typing

it up, and the name was mentioned and as we said previously,

there was some indication from the, on the reel, that this

could be of interest of very pertinent, so we had contacted

our contact that we had for any emergency of this type.

Mr. Brooten: Do you recall who that was?

Mrs. Tarasoff: Well, I wouldn't want to mention the

name, if you don't mind. It was just a phone number and

on

sometimes

it would be just passing/the message in case the

party was not there.

Mr. Brooten: All right, let me without trying to pry

further, is that person still, is that person an employee

of the CIA?

MrS.

Tarasoff:

Oh yes.

Mr. Brooten:

Is that person still employed by the CIA?

Mrs. Tarasoff: That I wouldn't know.

That much I wouldn't

know.

Mr. Brooten: But you called this unidentified person?

Mrs. Tarasoff: Yes.

Mr. Brooten:

And what transpired then.

Mrs. Tarasoff: Well, they in turn would pass by the

house and pick it up and take it to the Embassy.

Mr. Tarasoff: No I took the reel and transcription

to a corner, I remember that.

Mrs. Tarasoff: Oh, you took it personally? I thought

they came by and picked up.

Cause as a rule they would

come by and pick it up.

Mr. Tarasoff: Probably it must have been the other

one.

Mr. Brooten: Now, do you recall that on the same

day that you got that tape, that you transcribed that tape

and it was delivered to someone that day?

Mrs. Tarasoff: The same day.

Mr. Tarasoff: The same day, very shortly after its

been finished.

Mr. Brooten: All right sir. Now, that

was an

original and two copies. Would either of you be able to

identify the original transcript if you saw it.

Mrs .

Tarasoff: Yes, because there was a certain

procedure in how you type it up.

Mr. Brooten: All right. Would you be able to

determine at this point in time, 13 years later, if you

saw the original, whether or not it had been altered in

any way from what you recall typing it?

Mrs. Tarasoff: That

would be hard to determine because

actually, the transcript was made verbatim. Whatever one

party said, that was typed, whatever the other party said,

also was typed. There wasn't anything put in other than

what was both people talking to.

Mrs. Tarasoff: No. There was nothing omitted and nothing

added.

Mr. Tarasoff: They asked for verbatim, you've got

to put everything in it.

Mrs. Tarasoff: Whether they said. oh, ah or everything.

Mr. Brooten: Now, you delivered that, did you ever

use any in the transcription of those tapes, did you ever

use any code words or any phrases of anything like that that

you would add to it?

Mrs. Tarasoff: No.

MI. Brooten: You would use just your MI for man inside

and MO for man outside.

Mrs. Tarasoff: Those were the only two.

here, did that,

I would put down Yat.

Mrs.

Tarasoff: An abbreviation.

Mr. Tarasoff: Yes, saves time and work and what not.

Mr. Brooten:

Now, you personally handed the tape

contact.

No, none whatsoever.

Mr. Brooten: On cases of that nature, which were

sensitive, like the Oswald case, was it a normal procedure

to save certain tapes?

don't think that we ever saved any tapes.

whatever left our hands and went into the hands of the

other party, we never knew what happened, whether they

kept it, erased it, burned it or destroyed the whole works,

this we never knew.

system, how they file these transcripts. Did either one

of you ever have anything to do with that.

No. Now wait, I was, no, this was my,

Mr. Brooten: With respect to the typing of this, would

case.

was issued by the

it was a standard, then it would be on that. But many

a time we would have breakage of tape recorder, typewriter,

so we'd have to improvise every now and then.

Now, did you get, I know you don't

want to reveal the one name, but did you, was the person

who picked up the Oswald tape the same person that you

received the tape from?

Mrs. Tarasoff: Nine times out of ten yes.

Mr. Tarasoff: Yes, most likely.

Mr. Brooten;. All right. With respect to CIA

personnel, within the embassy, I'm talking about subsequent

to the assassination of President Kennedy, did any person

from the CIA ever contact either of you about that particular

tape or your transcription of the Oswald tape at any time?

idea that we shouldn't be socializing with the inside people

of cover or anything, how, what did it appear to your

friends and associates

Mrs. Tarasoff:

When I first came to Mexico, the

first few months, I was told I could help Boris because

there was such a backlog of

work that was left on his

shoulders when his predecessor left. And so, since I

was employed by CIA there was no reason for them not to

say yes because they didn't have to worry about a clearance.

So I was helping him out with the filing and more or less

putting it into category, in order.

MI. Tarasoff: It is very important the part that

she played in it.

Mrs.

Tarasoff: Because I filed according to the

date of the reel and the reel itself had a number and

then following that each conversation had a number and

I that would be the original copy that I would file as

it is in whole. Then the carbon copy would be also kept

in its original state and the second one I would sort

of scan it over and just delete what was not pertinent

like it was

a conversation with somebody saying, well,

tomorrow I'm going downtown, do you want to go with me?

I'11 pick you up at such-and-such a time. Or I'm having

lunch at, of its a phone call and

they said no one is

here. and

hangs up. But if it had anything to deal with

two people and especially if there names were mentioned,

this was cut out and it was pasted on a piece of paper.

NW 64937 Docld:32277225 Page 79

Mrs. Tarasoff: and it was turned in to our contact.

In the morning it was handed to the same person that delivered

and it was delivered then to the people at the Embassy and

from there I guess they filed

it according to their

own system. At first, they wanted everything, and then they

found out why a million times somebody's dialing for the

time, somebody's calling to see if their husband's come in,

and so they said that this was just a waste of time to try

to file all of this, what we're looking for is people that

are carrying conversations with each other, and especially

if they're identifying each other.

Mr. Tarasoff: Actually, if was left to your discretion.

Mrs. Tarasoff:

Yes

Mr. Tarasoff:

To throw all the unnecessary...

Mrs. Tarasoff: all the rubbish. Because they were

trying to do this at the Embassy and they found out that

it was taking up too much of their time for work that is

more pertinent than just sitting and just cutting little

pieces of paper, so they decided that it would be up to me

to use my common sense to see what was pertinent and was not

NO.

Mrs.

Tarasoff: There was no comments made on my part.

Mr. Brooten: Well, I believe that that is all the

questions that I have for right now. My colleague has pre-

pare some questions relating to some areas that I haven't

covered, and so I'm

I going to shut the tapes off and we'll

let him come around to this side of the table.

Mr. Blackmer: Mr. Tarasoff, I'm going to ask you a

few questions concerning specifics of your function in

Mexico City in 1963 between the periods of September and

November. I understand from your answers to Mr. Brooten's

questions that your responsibility was to translate and

transcribe intercepts of telephone conversations coming

into the Soviet Embassy in Mexico City.

Mr. Tarasoff: And going out of the Soviet Embassy.

Mr. Blackmer: Coming in and going out of the

Soviet Embassy.

During the course of your employment, did

you become familiar with many of the voices of the people

at the Embassy:

MI. Parasoft: On yes, /gradually begin to realize

who they are, the way they talk and you

associate yourself

very closely with them after a while, but it takes time.

Unfortunately.

Mr.

Blackmer:

• Is it not a fact that these Russians

were cautious when they spoke on the telephone?

Mr.

Tarasoff: Oh yes, very definitely.

Mr. Blackmer: Did they, they didn't usually

identify themselves by name?

Mr. Tarasoff:

NO.

Mr. Blackmer: So therefore, it was really necessary

for you to become familiar so you

could place them.

Mr. Tarasoff: Unless, of course, a certain person

asked whoever answered the telephone for another soviet

individual, whoever he might be.

Mr. Blackmer: And then the name would come up and

you'd be able to

identify. them?

Mr.

Tarasoff:

Yes, I don't think it happened very

often.

Mr. Blackmer: All right sir.

Can I ask you a few

if there were any particular individuals that you could

instantly recognize, their voices?

Mr. Tarasoff: Well, Yakinov was one of them.

Mr. Blackmer: Yakinov.

Mr. Tarasoff: Then they had Eukenrikov.

Oh, it's a

Mr. Blackmer:

So you recognized instantly certain

voices of individuals and I see that you have a scrap book

in front of us and in that it's got, it seems to be

photographs of people in the Soviet Delegation here in

Mexico City. Is that

MI. Tarasoff: Soviet Delegation?

Mr. Blackmer:

Mr. Blackmer: various names in there in different

sections.

So you state on top

• who these people :? : were

and where they were in the Embassy.

Mr. Tarasoff: What I could scrounge out, because

I asked for the photographs. I said how am going to tell

who's who if I don't see what the heck he looks like. And

Herb told me, he said try and work without pictures, and

give me a report on them, what you think of each of them.

And the first one apparently was so successful that he

was jumping with joy.. I described, I kind of cheated

a little bit. I saw the picture of the person I was

describing.

Mr. Blackmer: All right sir, so they kept you in

the dark, and you made clippings from newspapers, and

you got various photographs.

Mr. Tarasoff: Later they relented and let me

see

the pictures.

Mr. Blackmer: All right, let me move into one

specific area. Are you familiar with one Pavel Antonovich

• Yatskov?

Mr. Tarasoff: Yatskov.

MI.

Blackmer: Do you know this individual?

Mr.

Tarasoff:

Well, yes and we have his pictures.

Mr.

Blackmer: You have his picture, and do you recall

having transcribed telephone conversations in which Mr.

Yatskov was one of the people on the telephone, so you would

recognize his voice?

Mr. Tarasoff: I imagine I would, but as I said before,

I'm not sure about anything right now.

Mr. Blackmer: Well, back then constantly doing these

transcripts you..

Mr. Tarasoff: Oh yes, then you pick it up, to know

exactly who it is.

Mr. Blackmer:

So this man is not unfamiliar to you?

Yatskov.

Mr. Tarasoff: No.

Mr. Blackmer: He made many phone calls.

Mr. Tarasoff: Yes.

NW 64937 Docld:32277225 Page 85

Mr. Blackmer: Now, you explained to me that, let me

ask you if this is correct,

someone's speaking Russian

the voice sounds in a certain way, and the same person

speaking English might not sound the same, is that correct?

Mr. Tarasoff: That's correct because the person who

speaks the English uses very stilted languages and long

pauses between words and so forth, so it sounds mechanical

to me.

Mr. Blackmer: This is a Russian speaking English?

Mr. Tarasoff: Yes, a Russian speaking English.

Mr. Blackmer: All right, and you, I understand from

reviewing the Oswald tape when you were transcribing the

two telephone conversations, do you have an opinion right

now as to whether Yatskov was one of the, was the party

that Mr. Oswald was speaking to on those two occasions?

Mr. Tarasoff: I doubt it very much. Because by

comparing the pictures I would say that it's not the same

person.

But, had you ever heard ratskov

Tarasoft:

That I cannot answer.

Mr. Blackmer:

Were you aware that he could speak

English?

Mr. Tarasoff: That I don't know.

Mr. Blackmer: You don't know. But you did recall

many conversations from Yatskov in Russian.

Mr.

Tarasoff: Oh yes, yes.

Mr. Blackmer: All right. Do you believe, you stated

that you doubt very seriously if Yatskov was one of the

parties speaking. Now I ask you if you are familiar with

a Kostikov? Valeriy Vladimirovich Kostikov.

Mr. Tarasoff: Valeriy Vladimirovich Köstikov.

Mr. Blackmer:

Do you know Mr. Kostikov?

Mr. Tarasoff: I had transcribed some of his calls.

Mr. Blackmer:

Before the Oswald calls?

Mr. Tarasoff: Most likely.

NW 64937 Docld:32277225 Page 87

Mr. Blackmer:

So you are familiar with Mr. Kostikov's

voice speaking Russian. Is that true?

MI •

Tarasoff:

well, that is

if I remember it correctly.

Mr.

Blackmer:

Can you tell me whether or not you

had ever recall Mr. Kostikov's speaking in English?

Mr. Tarasoff: No. If a person was speaking in English

I doubt if I would know him.

Mr. Blackmer:

Can you recall any conversation in

which these high ranking Russians, you did know their

function, did you know they were secret police? Yatskov

and Kostikov?

Mr. Tarasoff: Well, eventually I got to know them,

who's who, I think I have that list of them. (turning

to his wife he asks) Do you remember.

Mrs. Tarasoff: You were given a list of all of the

Soviet Embassy employees and their status as to whether.

they were a Secretary Treasurer, or the one at the gate

answering the phone, and they also issued certain information

if they were able to prove it.

Mr. Tarasoff:

Suspected KGB.

Mrs. Tarasoff:

Suspected KGB and suspected operator

that they had.

So this list was furnished.

Mr.

Blackmer:

Could you tell me if you had this list

before the Oswald conversation?

Mrs.

Tarasoff:

Well this list was furnished practically

every time they had a changeover of personnel.

Mr. Blackmer: Did you know at the time of the

Oswald

conversation that Kostikov was a member of the KGB?

MY .

Tarasoff: But I can't swear to that.

Mr. Blackmer:

But was this also indicated on this

list that you got, whether they were KGB or not?

Mrs. Tarasoff: If they suspected and they had

proof, they would put in question mark.

Mr. Blackmer: Do you recall this man Kostikov

having been one?

Mrs. Tarasoff: No, that I wouldn't know.

Mr •

Blackmer: All right.

Mr -

Tarasoff: You have to realize one thing. There

were fifteen employees plus their wives who chatted on

the phone.

So actually, there were quite a number of people

to take care of.

It was almost impossible to realize

who's who and unless you get to know their voices perfectly.

Mr. Blackmer: All right, Can I ask you if you're

familiar with Antonovich Kanstantinov?

Mr. Tarasoff: Kanstantinov.

Mr. Blackmer: Do you know.a Kanstantinov?

Mr. Tarasoff:

Well, I heard them on the tape.

Mr. Blackmer: Do you know what position he had in

the Embassy?

Mr. Tarasoff: Absolutely no.

Mr. Blackmer: Do you recall whether he was suspected

of being a KGB official?

Mr. Tarasoff: Yes, I was told that he was.

found this out?

Mr. Tarasoff: NO.

Mr. Blackmer: You don't know whether it was before

or after the Oswald phone call?

Mr. Tarasoff: No.

Do you recall the name Kostin?

I doubt it.

Would someone familiar with the language of Russian use

that as an abbreviation of any of those names?

It

Mr. Blackmer: It sounds Russian. But you didn't

know the individual?

Mr. Tarasoff: No, I don't recollect frankly.

Mr. Blackmer: Do you know of any of the high-ranking

officials in the Soviet Embassy, whether they spoke English

on the telephone conversations or did they speak Russian

mostly?

Mr. Tarasoff: Oh, they spoke Russian... Very seldom

NW 64937 Docld:32277225 Page 92

## Page 93

-68-

Mr.

Tarasoff:

did you have English. Very seldom

and then usually: I called upon her (Mrs. Tarasoff) to verify

my idea, whatever they were talking about. Sometimes

their English was so bad that it was impossible to make

heads or tails out of it.

Mr. Blackmer: I would like to ask you if you can

state an opinion as to whether or not you think the

party talking to Mr. Oswald, on the two conversations that

you intercepted, were any of the individuals we just discussed.

Yatskov, Kostikov, Konstantinov or Kostin. Do you know for

a fact whether Mr. Oswald spoke with any of these individuals?

Mr. Tarasoff: Well my unconfirmed guess would be

that it must have been either Kostikov, or Konstantinov.

Mrs. Tarasoff: Well that's for the simple reason,

out of the whole group that was at the Embassy there were

only about two that really spoke English well. enough, where

they could carry on a conversation.

Mr. Blackmer: And those two are?

Mr. Tarasoff: Would be these two people/

Mr. Blackmer: Kostikov. and Konstantinov.

NW 64937 Docld:32277225 Page 93

## Page 94

-69-

Mr. Tarasoff: Because the others were sort of a

beginner, a word here of there, but they couldn't carry

on a conversation, in fact if a phone call was made and

an American was calling trying to

get some information, well

even the party at the gate that would be there, or at the

switchboard. They would hardly understand what they were

trying to say. They would try to tell them in Spanish that

they don't understand them. Or telling them in Russian

or in Spanish and they would finally hang up because even

the party at the switchboard very seldom knew English.

So you could boil it down to how many there were that really

spoke English well enough where they could carry on a

conversation.

Mr. Blackmer: All right, I understand that you have

made voice tapes.

Could describe to me what you did and

why that was done?

•x=4...

Mr. Tarasoff: Well, first of all I wanted to familiarize

myself with the way each member of the Embassy was talking.

Secondly, if I had somebody doing my work for me after I

was transferred or for any other reason, that they would

embassy

listen to the voices of the Soviet/employees and figure out

who was talking. And in order to build up a library, let's

say, of the voice prints;

so consequently assishad quite a

Mr. Tarasoff: number of these spools, empty spools

from eight millimeter movies, I used those for cutting off

a section of the tape and then winding it on the spool and

then my wife would mark it and put a piece of paper identifying

each voice when it was spoken and so forth. After a while

we would run out of it because there were so many different

voices.

So we had to

go to Kodak store and we bought a whole

mess of these empty reels.

Mr. Blackmer: Did you deal with anybody in the Embassy

on this voice taping?

Mr. Tarasoff: No. I sent them notice to that effect

toüthe embassy. I said that it would be a good idea.

They

didn't think so at first, but then, remember, I think it was

Herb that said actually,

Mr. Blackmer:

so you definitely communciated this

Mr. Tarasoff: I think so.

That's who it was.

Mr. Blackmer: Can you tell me a little more about

employment, did you turn them over to anyone in the Embassy?

still in existence?

Mrs. Tarasoff: That, I have no idea.

Mr. Blackmer: I'd like to show a memorandum sir,

it's dated the 16th of October, 1963. It is

a teletype

message to the Ambassador concerning Lee Harvey Oswald's

contact with the Soviet

Union. I'd like to read for you

this paragraph and I want to ask you if you think it's a

fair representation of the information that you transmitted

to CIA headquarters during the time you transcribed the

Oswald tape. If we can,.we have a minor delay, if we can

cut off just for a moment. and we can return. Mrs. Tarasoff,

Mr. Tarasoff, I was going to ask you, give you the infor-

mation that's contained in October 16, 1973 CIA memo to

the Ambassador. It also has carbon copies to Immigration

and Naturalization, Navy, Legal Attache, Regional Security

Officers, Counselor for Political Affairs and the Ministry.

This is information that was sent to these different

agencies concerning Mr. Oswald's appearance in Mexico City.

in the period September-October, 1965 (sic) (means 1963)

and I'll just read it and I'll just try to emphasize the

part that when discussing Mr. Oswald. This memo starts:

the following information was received, and of course the

source is blanked out, on October 1, 1963, now I want to

read this following information and tell me if you think

there is anything more in the transcripts than what's

contained in this message. An American male contacted

the Soviet Embassy and identified himself as Lee Oswald.

Is that correct so far? Is that basically what you had

in the transcript?

Mrs. Tarasoff: Yes.

Mr. Blackmer:

This officer determined that Oswald

had been at the Soviet Embassy on 26 or 28: (unclear):.

September, 1963 and had talked with Kostikov, a member of

the Counselor section. Now do you know for a fact whether

he was at the Soviet

• Embassy?

MI •

Tarasoff:

We

could never know that.

Mrs.

Tarasoff:.

NO.

Mr. Blackmer: You never knew that. And do you know

for a fact whether or not he talked to Kostikov on the

telephone?

Mr. Tarasoff:

Well, as I said before, it's a very

doubtful proposition and we coüld jump at conclusions all

weekend.

Mr. Blackmer: But, you don't know for a fact that

he did?

NW 64937 Docld:32277225 Page 98

## Page 99

-74-

Mr. Tarasoff: Not as a fact.

Mr. Blackmer: Mr. Oswald's contact was done in order

to learn if the Soviet Embassy had received a reply from

Washington concerning his. (Oswald's) request. Now, do you

know, if in the conversation intercept, whether he was

requesting something?

Mrs. Tarasoff: If I can remember, I think he was

requesting financial help to go back to either go to

Cuba or to go to Russia.

Mr. Blackmer: You don't recall whether or not being...

(interrupted) •

Mrs. Tarasoff: But he needed financial assistance

because he didn't have much money.

Mr. Blackmer: Do you recall whether he asked the

Soviet Embassy people if they had received replies from

some previous requests he'd made?

Mrs. Tarasoff: No.

• Mr. Blackmer: That is the information.

So is there

any more information that you know from the transcripts

NW 64937 Docld:32277225 Page 99

## Page 100

-75-

Mr. Blackmer:

about Mr. Oswald's telephone conversations,

is there more than is mentioned in the paragraph I just

read you? And, if so, what else did you know?

Mrs. Tarasoff:

Well, I couldn't really rely on my

memory, but I know the conversation was quite lengthy,

in fact, the transcript must have been at least a couple of

pages or two and a half pages, because it has to be done

verbatim, word for word, it wasn't just listening to it and

then you making a summary.. It was a verbatim transcript

made of both parties speaking to each other.

Mr. Blackmer: Well, was there any more in the context

of what went on in that conversation other than the fact

that he just wanted to know if he'd gotten: a request. (sic)

back from the Soviets. Did he ask for anything? Do you

recall that he asked for anything? Did he ask for a visa?

Mrs. Tarasoff: That I wouldn't swear to. But I know

he was requesting financial help because he said he was

just out of money.

Mr. Blackmer: So that much is very clear.

remember he at least asked for financial help.

You do

Mrs. Tarasoff: And he wanted to speak to someone

Mrs. Tarasoff:

in the Embassy who would be able to

finance, I guess give him the money.

Mr. Blackmer:

Did he indicate that he wanted to

leave Mexico?

Mrs. Tarasoff:

Oh, definitely, he didn't want to stay,

well I know that he didn't want to stay in Mexico because

he was going to leave, if he couldn't get results from one

of the embassies, the Cuban or the Soviet embassy, he wasn't

about to stay in Mexico.

Mr. Blackmer: Did you know this from the transcript

or is this from some öther knowledge that you gained since

then?

Mrs. Tarasoff: I don't know whether that was in the

transcript or whether it was something that came throught

another source.

Mr. Blackmer: Can I ask you if you can recall:from

the transcript, either one of you, whether or not he said

he wanted to

go to Cuba or to Russia? You said he wanted

to get out of Mexico, did the transcript, can you recall

from the transcript, did he indicate where he wanted. to

He wanted to leave Mexico, where did he want to

Mrs. Tarasoff: If any place, he would go back to

of

Russia.

Because

his wife is/Russian extraction. And this

is the one reason it puzzled both Boris and I that although

he married a Russian, why was she given permission to leave

the country when it is so difficult for others to leave?

So there must be

some sort, there must have been sort of

an angle there.

While he married a Russian girl, and he

lived there, I believe it was three or four years.

Mr. Blackmer: While we're on this record, let's not

get into opinions, I want to get anything that you can

recall having seen on that transcript that indicated where

he wanted to go.

You say he wanted financial aid, that

he was broke. Did it indicate where he wanted to go?

Mrs. Tarasoff: He really didn't care. He wanted to

go to either Cuba or to Russia.

Mr. Blackmer: Do you know that from the transcript?

Mrs. Tarasoff: I would say that's exactly what he wanted,

if I can rely on my memory.

Mr. Blackmer: And your memory of what was in the

transcript, that he wanted to go to Cuba or to Russia.

• Mrs. Tarasoff: He didn't want to stay in Mexico.

That was

for sure. His purpose in coming to Mexico

was

to contact either one of the embassies because he couldntt

get

any results in Washington, from the embassies.

Mr. Blackmer:

We want to stay only with the knowledge

that you have based on what you transcribed. And you think

that you transcribed something that indicated that he wanted

to leave Mexico City and travel to Cuba or Russia?

Mrs. Tarasoff: That's right.

Mr. Blackmer: And is that anywhere contained in

this 16 October 1963 memo?

Mrs. Tarasoff: Well, as far as dates are concerned.

Mr. Blackmer: You see the memo before you. Do you

see anything in there that indicates that he said that

he wanted to travel to Russia?

someone was attempting to burglarize their Embassy?

Mr. Tarasoff: I cannot answer that positively because

I don!t remember.

Mr. Blackmer: Very good. That concludes my questioning.

Mr. Brooten: Mr. and Mrs. Tarasoff, I thank you very

much for taking the time that you have to discuss this both

last night and tonight with us. I would request.

on behalf of Richard Sprague, Chief Counsel of the Committee,

that you not discuss this. I can only make that as a request.

If anyone should contact I would like to certainly know

about it.. Other than someone officially from our Committee.

And this concludes these interviews.

Blackmer:

We are

going back on the record for

a brief question.

I understand that yousucceeded George

Misko, who was

familiar with the voices of the Russians in

the Russian Embassy, because he did the translating of the

tapes: Is:that-correct?

Mr. Tarassof:

That is correct.

Mr. Blackmer: I would also like to ask you if you

know if there was anybody else, other than George Misko,

who was in the American Embassy, in September and October 1963

that was as familiar with the voices of the Russians in

the Russian Embassy than yourself. As familiar as you

were.

Mr. Tarassof: I doubt it. For the simple reason

that I had to deal with them day in and day out, and the.

people at the Embassy would probably get a crack at them

once in a while, which wouldn't give them sufficient basis

to know the people, to identify them.

Mr. Blackmer: To identify the voices to put them

with the people.

Mr. Tarasoff: To identify the voices to put them

with the people.

Mr. Blackmer: Then I would like to ask you if

anyone checked with you to verify whether or not you:

had an opinion as to who the voice was on the other end

of the call with Oswald, on both conversations?

Mr. Tarasoff: No, not that I know of.

Mr. Blackmer:

Mrs. Tarassof, do you know of anybody

in the American Embassy during that time that was as

familiar with the Russian voices as your husband?

Mrs. Tarasoff: No, I don't think there was really.

Because actually the reason why they had him come down,

was that needed somebody that was proficient. There were

some people that had a slight knowledge of Russian, but

as far as being proficient, no.

Mr. Blackmer: Can I ask you when you were talking

about voice identity tapes that you made putting the tape:

with the name, were those identity tapes made before or

after the Oswald call?

Mrs. Tarasoff: These

tapes were made regularly.

Mr. Blackmer: Do you recall having made them when

you first came on or was it sometime after?

Mrs.

Tarasoff:

No this was sometime after.

Mr. Blackmer:

Was it sometime after the assassination?

Mrs. Tarasoff: Yes, definitely.

Mr. Tarasoff: Yes, definitely.

Mr. Blackmer: So there were no voice identity

tapes

that they could match voices with during the time of these

calls?

Mr. Tarasoff: Unless that particular tape was kept

for some reason.

Mr. Blackmer: Later on. But at the time the tape

was transcribed, there was no identity tape and no one

as proficient in Russian and knowing the voices than yourself?

Mr.

Tarasoff:

No. I don't think so.

Mr. Blackmer: Very good.

can conclude the interview

now .

Thank you very much, we.
