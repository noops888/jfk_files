MEMORANDUM FOR: Director of Security

SUBJECT

: Herbert Itkin/Mario Brod

1. Pursuant to your instructions, I had NY FO interview

Mr. Philip HORION, to ascertain whether or not he might be the

Philip HARBIN, who was allegedly ITKIN's contact with the Agency

during 1954. Reference is made to the attached report of interview

of Mr. HORTON wherein he comments that he does not know ITKIN;

did not recruit him; and never acted as a "cut-out" or handler for

Mr. ITKIN. HORTON states further that since leaving OSS, he has

had no contact with the CIA. (This is not strictly true, since he

did write a letter to Mr. Helms not too long ago.)

2. I will ask the Office of Finance to attempt a trace of the

receipt for $5, 000. 00 that ITKIN claims he gave HARBIN in

approximately 1957. However, I am inclined to believe that this

recruitment is a figment of ITKIN's imagination.
