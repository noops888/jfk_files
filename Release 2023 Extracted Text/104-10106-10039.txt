MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT: Manuel Artime
1. Artime was an INRA official in the Castro regime
on 1959 but broke with it in late 1959 or early 1960 over
a communist issue and was exfiltrated by CIA. He was the
political representative for Brigade 2506 and was captured
during the Bay of Pigs. He was sentenced to be executed
but this was later commuted by Castro to life imprisonment.
In 1962 Artime was released to the U.S. asspart of a
prisoner exchange..
2. From June 1963 through April 1965 Artime conducted
paramilitary operations (Project AMWORLD) against Cuba
under the political banner of his exiled group, Movimiento
de Recuperacion Revolucionaria (MRR). The Project expenses
during this period were approximately $7 million. The
support was terminated effective 1 May 1965 but support for
political operations was restored in June 1965 at the rate
of $15,000 per month. This was scaled down to $5,000 a
month in September 1965, to $3,000 a month in June 1966, and
terminated on 31 December 1966. Artime accepted this
termination gracefully in a meeting on 13 January 1967.
