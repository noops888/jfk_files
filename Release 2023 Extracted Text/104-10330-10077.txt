Dear David:
This is to acknowledge your letter of 3 January 1997 to the
Director of Central Intelligence concerning the Assassination
Records Review Board's recent formal determinations with respect
to CIA Records.
The appropriate Agency components have again reviewed the
documents that the Board has decided to release either totally or
with some information postponed. While the Agency does not plan
to appeal to the President for additional postponements at this
time, we ask that the Board reconsider its decisions with respect
to six documents. These documents contain information relating to
foreign government provided data, foreign liaison relationships,
and intelligence sources--information that we believe merits
protection under current standards set by the Board.
these six documents, together with Agency comments concerning
them, is enclosed.
A list of
We plan no further action on these documents pending
discussion with your staff and review by the Board.

(We request that this enclosure be returned to CIA once the
Review Board has completed its deliberations on the issues
discussed below.)
(U) The Central Intelligence Agency requests that the
Assassination Records Review Board reconsider its determination
on the six documents listed below:
(U) 1.
104-10012-10080 and 104-10009-10224
(substitute--language for a foreign country document).
(S) The foreign government in question has expressed
strong concern about USG and CIA's inability to keep secrets,
and current relationships are very tense. If we are required to
release the date and/or narrow the geographic choices too
closely, the foreign government will be able to identify the
document as theirs. Because this document is scheduled for
another review in July 1997, we request that the ARRB reconsider
the inclusion of the date of the document and designation of the
country of origin as "Pacific Rim Country", and accept ours-f
originally submitted wording.
(U) 2. 104-10051-10106 (release of location)
(S) We request reconsideration of the release of the
location identified in the last three words in the eleventh line,
paragraph eight. This CIA base currently is undeclared to the
host government.
(U) 3. 104-10055-10072 and 104-10054-10007 (foreign
government activity/liaison).
(S) Regarding the release of the reference to the passport)
camera on page 3, it is not the USG's position to confirm that a
foreign government undertakes such activity. In addition this is
an on-going operation. Further, releasing the words in question
would establish a strong inference that the two Agency officers
(were permitted by foreign officials to inspect the camera, thus

tending to confirm the liaison relationship. We request that the
last seven words of line four, paragraph "h", be replaced with
substitute wording such as "the public security facilities".

"agent" in this context (page 32); suggested substitute,
"contact." Nielson was not a paid agent of the REDSKIN project

either to him or his family, especially if they are still in
Russia.
