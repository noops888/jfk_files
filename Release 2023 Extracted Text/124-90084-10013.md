Chile, while he was there in Febuary, 1966. He said that

allegation in this matter from CIA to the effect that VICTOR

DELGADO,

Communist. Youth Congress in santiago, Chile, was probably

obtained from the Chilean Customs Records-or from the Chilean

Immigration Records Jinasmuch as this

to enter Chile: which was. probably the..case of:
