2. ACCORDING TO AN OFFICIAL COSTA RICAN SERVICE, EULALIO
FRANCISCO (FRANK) CASTRO PAZ, WHO WAS IN COSTA RICA FROM
13 TO 18 DECEMBER 1976, SAID HE IS THE CHIEF OF OPERATIONS OF THE
COORDINATION OF UNITED REVOLUTIONARY ORGANIZATIONS (CORU) BUT DENIED
THAT HE WAS IN COSTA RICA TO UNDERTAKE TERRORIST ACTS. CASTRO SAID
CORU HAD MADE A PACT WITH PRESIDENT CARLOS ANDRES PEREZ OF
VENEZUELA NOT TO UNDERTAKE TERRORIST ACTS IN COSTA RICA, NICARAGUA,
GUATEMALA, OR VENEZUELA IN RETURN FOR THOSE COUNTRIES ALLOWING
ORLANDO BOSCH KAVILA, HEAD OF THE CORU, TO PASS SAFELY THROUGH
THEIR TERRITORIES IN MARCH 1976.
3. AN OFFICER OF THE COSTA RICAN SERVICE ASKED CASTRO ABOUT
TWO BOMBS THAT WERE SET OFF IN SAN JOSE, COSTA RICA, ON 24 AUGUST
1976. CASTRO ADMITTED THE BOMBS WERE PLACED BY A CORU COMMANDO
UNIT DISPATCHED FROM PUERTO RICO, ADDING THAT CORU ACTIONS WERE NOT
WELL COORDINATED AT THAT EARLY DATE AND THIS LACK OF COORDINATION
CAUSED AN ERROR TO BE MADE. CASTRO SAID THIS WILL NOT HAPPEN AGAIN.
4. ON BEING ASKED IF PANAMA WAS INCLUDED IN THE AGREEMENT
