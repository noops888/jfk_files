VI. Production

A Pesitive intelligence Ipformation

NOSENKO'S positive litelligence production.

has been

meager,

and nothing he reported acrited disseminition as an

intelligence report.

According to his blography, NOSENKO's

entire adult life until defecting had been spent

either as

& student or as an intelligence officer,

and in explanatios

of bis lack of positive intelligence infornation, he has

stressed that since the early 195D's he had few

outside

interests and "no real cuntacts" outside the lGE itself.*

NOSENKO's assignments to the Soviet delegations to the

Disarmament Conference in 1962 and 1954

were, he has said,

for cover purposes only, and he neither had

any connections

with officials or organizations

in

the USSR concerned eith

arns control or disarmament policies nor did he take any

part in the substantive work of the delegations.

During the period 18 to 23 Februaiy 1964, & wide range

of questions covering various aspects of nuclear

weapons,

missiles, electronics, communications, unconventional wea-

pons, military industry, military untts and equipment, and

rebearch and development were put to MOSENKO in order to

evaluate his knowledgeability.

He had no direct knowledge

of any of these topics,

although he was able to identify in

general a few

of the KGB orkanizations which protect sensi

tive instollations such as suclear weapons production and

storage sites.

NOSENKO was given a set of requirements

fron the Defense Intelligence Agency on 24 February 1964.

These questions were premised on his two TDY tours to the

Disarnament Conferences in Geneva; thuy dealt with such

matters as Soviet underground testing, Soviet efforts and

progress in the fields of chemical and biological warfare,

Soviet aims and purposes at the disarmament talks, and

Soviet views of the corresponding attitudes and intentions

of the United States.

NOSENKO stated he had us information

on any of these questions but expressed his personal opinion

on a few of them,

in general terms.

NOSENKO's answers to

other questions

of a positive intelligence nature--those

concerning the viability of the current Soviet leadership.

plans for a new Soviet constitution, anti-Semitisu as

governmental policy, personality data on Soviet lcaders,

and other political

and social matters--were couched in vague

and general terms and were not based on concrete knowledge.

*At the start of his first meeting with CIA on g June 1962,

however, when explaining how he knew of the real state of

affairs

inside the USSR

(as opposed to that presented by

Soviet propaganda), NOSENKO

"I circulate among

ministers, with the friends of my father, and I hear

what they say."

B. . Soviet Intelligence Personalities

As indicated in the accompanying tabulation, NOSENRO

has provided information on a total of approximately 1,000

Soviet citizens

tho are staff employees of, or have other-

wise been affiliated with; Soviet intelligence and security

organizations.

At the time NOSENKO defected, 64 of these--

51 officers and 13 agents or contacts--were abroad. Of the

51 oificers then abroad, 41 were already known or

suspected

of being Soviet intelligence officers.

Another 140 were identified by NOSENKO only by

last name, and he could provide no additional infornation

which might identify them further; most of these names were

of persons engaged in strictly internal economic, industrial

and political security activities.

Of the remaining 248,

NOSENKO's information on the majority of them is inadequate

for identifloation parposes if they should travel abroad.

C. KGB Headguarters

1. Structure and Functions

Prior to NOSENKO's contact with CIA in June 1962, tho

nost recent information on KGB structure and functions had

been provided by GOLITSYN, whose information was current as

of December 1961 when he

defected.

GOLITSYN's data and that

from the Polish defector GOLENIENSKI wero the first detailed

new information on this subject available to the U.S. intel-

ligence community since 1954, when DERYABIN, RASTVOROV,

PETROV, and KHOKHLOV defected, just prior to the change-over

fron the Ministry of Internal

Affairs

(tVD) to the Committee

for State Security

(KGB).

GOLENIEWSKI and GOLITSIN had re-

ported on the 1959 reorganization of the KGB, the first major

realignment of the KGB's functions since the

abolition of

the Committee

for Infornation in 1951.

It encompassed

the

absorption into the Second Chief Directorate of the duties of

the

former

Fourth, Fifth

and Sixth Directorates. which had

been responsible for political, econonic-industrial, and

transportation security, respectively.

It also included the

upgrading of the Illegals Department to the status of a

Special Directorate within the First Chief Directorate, the

consolidation

of counterintelligence operations abroid into

one new department, the

Fourteenth, and creation of a new

department--Department "D" (Disinformation)--to .coordinate

and intensify the KGB's activities in the area of deception

and misinformation.

although placed in the First

Chief Dircetorate, was established to serve the needs of the

entire KGB.

NOSENKO's 1964 information on the organization and fune-

tions of the KGB indicated refinements of responsibilities

in the Second Chief Directorate in accordance with the 1959

absorption of the Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth Directorates.

The formation of the so-called

"Service" (Sluzhbal as a

component of tle Second Chief Directorate centraTized those

political security functions (formerly handled by the Fourth

Directorate) which were unrelated to

foreigners in the USSR;

the creation of an element entitled "the Directorate" (Uprev-

accumplished the

same thing

for industrial-dconomic

functions formerly managed by the Fifth and Sixth Directorates.

As for the first Chief Directorate, NOSENKO reported the up-

grading of the Scientific and Technical Department to direc-

torate status, and the expansion of the Information and

Counterintelligence Departments to UService: Number:l" and "Ser-

vice Number 2,"

respectively; according to NOSENKO, the

latter organizational designation permits an increase in

personnel without a corresponding rise in the bureaucratic

level of the component.

The accompanying charts offer a comparison of the or-

ganization of the KGB in 1961,

as known from GOLITSYN (and

supported by GOLENIEWSKI),

and in 1964, as given by NOSENKO.

Comments on particular weaknesses in NOSENKO's information

on the KGB organization since its formation in 1954 will be

found in Part VII. B.l., Statements of DERYABIN.

2. Modus Operandi

Less measurable or precise in comparison with kob

structure and functions are the operational methods and

Headquarters proceduros of the KGS.

JOSENKO himself has not

been

as productive in revaling Tourist Departurnt rethods

as

was the document which he provided on this subject in

1964â¢

He has not been

able to pro:ide a systonatir, detailed,

or documented review of the methods of the other second Chiet

Directorale compenunt to

which h. was assigned,

the u.s.

Enbassy Sectior, not of the nothods of the Surycillance

Directorate with wiich he worked closely.

JOSESKO neverthe-

less has

furnister insignts into the U.S. Enbassy Section

and Surveillance Dirictorate methods in the course of dis-

cussing specific operators.

VOSENKO brought to Ini: Gunera muerings

in 1964 a draft

of a report to the Colligium of the KGB dated March 1963 on

the work of the lourist Department of ibe Second Chief Direc-

torate.

Ile claimed to nave

written st hinself, and it bore

corrections

in his handwritirg.

This draft descrihed KGB

investigations of

and operations against lestern tourists

suspected of being agints of forcign intelligence services,

primarily in the periud oi 1961-1922.

functiors of rach

conpon.nt of the Tourist lepartment and

the number ard qualifications of the operational staff,

giving figures on length of service, educational background,

foreign travel and languages, and training.

It

wrnt on to

cite

statistics on the

number of foreign tourists visiting

the l'SS?,

and

the number of foreign agent susprets uncovered

among them through the

work of the KCB.

A wido variety of

techniques used by the Tourist Departrent were mentioned,

with examples of certain successes

interspersed in the

discussion.

On cho hasis of the detail on

techniques and

modus operandi set torch in this report, ClA prepared the

study entitled 'KGB work Against foreign Tourists" which was

diss+minated to the U.S. intellignce community in June 1964.

Aside from the case examples

which were added as illustrative

materiai, derived from

the many reports

from

Americans who

wern targets of such klib operational artivity, this study

drew alnost exciusivoly on the material discussed in the

NOSESKO document.

The study received high evaluations from

all

recipients.

NOSENKO has

made numerous references to the techniques

described in this report,

as discussed in the many

cases

reviewed in detail in tne foregoing treatment of his KGB

career.

then interviewed for further information on the

statistics which appear throughout the 1963 draft, however,

NOSESKO was unable to identify the oporations leferred to in

the numerical citations, nor those included as illustrative

examples of operational techniques, with one exception.

exception

was the example of the use of the concealed trans-

mitter "N-EkSIRA" in

the Restaurant Praga to monitor an

attempt by an American

intelligence officer to recruit a dip-

lomat of one of the neutral countries; this

was identified

by NOSENKO as the incident involving

the Indonesian

attacke ONGO, discussed in detail in Part VI.I.7.b.*

#IT VOSENRO is correct in identifying this as the ONGKO case,

the reference is to a recruitment effort on

the part of an

American Embassy officer, not a tourist operation.

other eccaniong, when thie deport moe me arella de lee Hila

NOSE:KO could not provide as much detall un second Chief

Directorate operational techniques and methods as is con-

tained in the written report.

The document refers also to the role of the leadership

of the Tourist Department in briefing other organs of the

KGB on work against foreign tourists.

NOSENKO was questioned

on this activity but ould

any infornation contained

in such lectures or discussions.

Although the document also

emphasized the daily need for coordination of the Tourist

Departnent activities with numerous other components of KGB

Headquarters and with local organs of the KGB throughout the

Soviet Union,

NOSENKO was unable to explain how such coordina-

tion was effected in practice, nor could he describe require-

ments for the preparation and

approval of correspondence

pertaining to such coordination; in many instances he asserted

that telepnone calls sufficed, but he said he could not indi

cate who was authorized

to coordinate informally in this way.

Apart from this information on Tourist Department modus

operandi, NOSENKO has described the operational methods or

the V.S. Envassy Section of the Anerican Department and of

the Surveillance Directorate in connection with their coordinated

activities against Embassy targets.

Uf particular note is

Part V.F.3.c., in discussions of operations against Embassy

code clerks.

3.

Staff Procedures

In recounting various operations

in which he participated

or which ne supervised, NOSENKO described operations and

events which encompassed various KGB procedures.

these were:

authorization for recruitment; file checks;

correspondence and coordination with other KGB departments,

directorates, or regional units; technical support of opera-

tions; adainistration of safe houses; KGB files

and travel authorizations and accountings.

to time asked to describe such procedures systematically and

in detail.

From such questioning it was not possible to

derive any detailed picture of current KGB procedures.

little NOSFNKO was able to provide did not differ from infor-

mation dated 1954, and was only a small fraction of the lutor-

mation available from earlier sources.

He had no information

on changes or developments in the interim.

Examples of the

level of NOSENKO's knowledge of certain procedures may

found 1n Part VII.B.1, DERYALIN'S Conments, as may instances

of inaccurate reporting of procedures.

D. KGB Activities

1. Operations Against Americans

In the context of iGA recruitment operations and investigations,

NOSENXO has mentioned 111 Americans:

Forty-nine

of them were said

to have been recruitedith the kGB; investigations

33 were under development, and

seven rei

fused to collatorate

remaining 22 erisans were reportedly predicated on KGB sus-:

picion or knobledge of inelr afillation with U,S. Intelligence.

Of the 49 Americans

edge of nine of them

to

recruited, noSENKO attributed his knowl-

his

owr direct, personal irvolvement in

the approaches, usually

as recruiting officer;

these cases are

discussed at greater

length in connection with SOCaNKO's KGB

career (Part.:;.

His knowledge of 11 other recruitments

was said

to have derived irom

either indirect involvement or contact with

the targets of these operations; NOSENKO indicated that he be-

came aware of these il persons

through his duties at various times

in the America: and

Tourist Departnents of the KGB Second Chief

Directorate.

(recause of interest in Americar correspondents

during 1954

and 1955 while in the American Department, for exam-

ple,

he was able to report that five of then were XGB

agents, al-

though he had taken

no part in their

recruitments, which had

been

achieved earlier; likewise,

he learned

of two recruitments when

an ATerican Department officer twice visited the Tourist Depart-

ment with a request for operational assistance during 1962 and

1963, when NOSENKO was a Deputy Chief of this departnent.) In

four

cases--Ã¤ll First Chiel Directorate operations--NOSENKO said

he lcarned

the recruitments unofficially

from discussions with

friends and fron remaris by other case officers which he over-

heard.

Two of these

four cases were considered by NOSENKO to be

among his most significant information,

the penetration of the

Orly Courier Transfer Station by U.S. Army Sgt. Robert Lee JCHN-

SON and the recrÃ¼itment in Moscow and later handling of code-

machine mechanic Dayle W. SMITH; detailed information on the

JOHNSON

and

SWITH

cases is

presented after the tabulation (below)

of NOSENKO'S Anerican leads.

NOSENKO has provided no sources for his information on 25

of the 49 successful jGB recruitment operations against Aneri-

cans, although he has sonetimes identified the case officers in-

volved in them; most of this information was contained

in handwritten

notes, which

NOSENKO carried

to Geneva

in 1964.

According to NOSENKO,

â¢ he learned of these cases casually while Deputy Chief of the Tour-

ist Department during 1962 and 1963; many of the recruitnents were

said to have been accomplished in 1960 and 1961 at a time when

NOSENKO was serving in the American Department.

He has explained

these notes as follows:

"If I did not participate in a case. I

don't know much about it.

Please understand me.

Since 1962

Additionally, a female KGB

The

plan was to continue these relationships

in Moscow.

Because JENNER refused to

the operation was put aside.

NOSENKO:

I tell you I was not working on this case. He was

Question:

When did he leave Moscow?

NOSENKO:

He left in 1950. It seems so, yes. He said that he

would not work in the USA.

NOSENKO went on to say that 'ANDREY" was the cryptonym

assigned to the agent by the Second Chief Directorate at the time

of his recruitment.

Although NOSENKO was not sure of the dates,

he was certain that this man, a U.S. Army Sergeart, had been

for the KGB by Roy RHODES, whose KGB cryptonym was

"QUEBEC".

RHODES was still In Moscow when "ANDREY" was -e-

cruited; he had told the KGB

about many other U.S. Embassy

employees, including military personnel, and the name

"ANDREY"

would mean nothing to RHODES because he

did not know that the

KGB had recruited this man.*

The mechÃ¤nic worked

satisfactorily in Moscow for the KGB,

providing materials and information on ciphers.

"ANDREY" pro-

mised he would cooperate with the Suviets in future assignments

abroad, but would not work with then in the United States as he

did not want to "sit in the electric chair."

he was paid well

for his cooperation in Moscow,

and the Soviets wanted to pay

him more but he refused to accept it because he said he couid

not plausibly explain the possession of too much money.

gems for later sale, he

to reappear in some other country, but he did not.

case, records were checked for the dates of RHODES' assign-

ing to RHODES,

the date of his own recruitment by the KGB

was January 1952.

When these dates were cited to NOSENKO

on two separate occasions during the 1962 meetings he

changed the original date for the recruitment from 1949

or 1950 to 1952 or 1953.

In 1962, as well as in 1964,

he said he was certain that the recruitment had already

that he explained to the KGB how the code machines in the u.s,

'ANDREY" may have given the KGB parts of code machines such

"discs" (sic, meaning rotors).

In this connection, NOSENKO

recalled that one Aleksand SELEZNE, a deputy department chief

in the Communications Directorate of

the KGB, had seen involved

tional meetings.

The reason for SELENEV's presence was that

the case officers were not technical

and SELEZNEV

supply them with the questions to be asked of "INDREy."

Since SELEZNEV came to these meetings in civilian clothes,

whereas NOSENKO normally saw him in

the First Department in 1960 and 1951, NOSENKO speculated that

SELEZEY may have gone in person to some of the mectings with

officers working with

"ANDREY" to ask him for discs from inside

NOSENKO was asked if "ANDREY" had brought military code material

operation of code machines and what daily or other periodic

settings were made...

was able to furnish good material,

not only orally but also in

the form of documents, papers, and written material.

This was

true for the period KOVSHUK was handling him

and also for the

BAGRICHEV phase of the operation.

NOSENKO was queried as to

whether during the period between June 1962 ard January 1964 he

had heard

about "ANDREY" continuing to

supply good information.

"No, something is going wrong there with this

The KGS Agent in Paris (Sat. Rober: Lee JOINiSON)

(i) Introduction

The lead to the penetration of a sensitive l.f. military

installation in the Paris area during 1962 and 1903 was the first

plece of irformation NOSENKO gave ClA after reestablishing con-

tact in Geneva in January 1964.

NOSENKO Characterized this lead

then and later as the most important single counterintelligence

iten that he had acquired during the year and a hale he had been

a CIA collaborator at KSB Headquarters in Noscow; the subject of

the liad had provided the KGB with significant documents, some

of which has teen

shown to Premier KHRÃSHCHEY persoraily.

acrive at the time NOSENKO left Moscow jor Gereva,

the agent

nevertheless had lost access to the sensitive information some

morichs carlier.

NOSENKO explainec that the agent was

when he would be rotated to the United States.

interim: one of the Second Chiet Directorate's spesial techni-

clans: an expert at opening and resealing envelopes, had been

assigned on extended TDY to the KGS Legal Residency

in Paris

against the possibility that access would be regained before

this transfer.

NOSENKO was unaware of any other services this

agent may have earlier performed for the KGS and estimated that

he had been recruited in 1962.

NOSENKO 's lead eventually led to the identification of

Tig. Krmy sergeant Robert Lee JOHNSON, JOHNSON's wife Hedwig,

ard James Allen MINTKENBAUGH, a friend, as KGS agents.

three had been recruited In Berlin Ir. 1953 and had worked

closely together since. Although Mis. JOHNSON's direct par-

ticipation (she served

as a courier)

transfer from Berln in 1954 and despite KGB efforts to com-

partment the activities of JOHNSON

after 1959,

aware of the others' clandestine work.

NOSENKO 'S

lead to JOHNSUN therefore compromised the other two.

While investigations of the NOSENKO lead were proceeding

in the early autumn of 1964, JOiSON deserted his duty assign-

ment at the washington Area Courier Station in the Pentagon

and disappeared until the end of November, wher he voiuntarily

turned himself in to Air Force Police officials in Las Vegas.

Nevada. JCHNSON had arrived at his Pentagon assignment in May

1964: for the previous nine months he had been

cormissioned officer in charge of the classified

section of the Seine Area Command Headquarters in

ust 1963, he had been assigned to the U.S. Armed Forces cour-

In confessing to American authorities in January 1965,.

JOHNSON admitted having penetrated the Orly vault for the

Soviets about seven times during December 1962 and the first

five months of 1963.

Although there were certain differences

in timing and detail, JOHNSON's confession closely matched

the complete description of this operation earlier given by

NOSENKO.

casual corversations with one us more Second Chief Directorate

about the case.

NOSENKC had most recently discussed the case with the ToY "flaps

NOSENKO explained that, although as

a Second Chief Direstorate

officer re had no rightiul access to

information on this operation, he had worked wach the special

techricians in operations egainst tourists and ocher foreigners

in loscow and was on good terms with them.

Its such circunstences,

NOSENKO

said.

it frequently happens that KGB officers kill tell

other KGB officers "some details of operations or which they are

working."

The following discussion of the derails of the operation

commences wish a revier of NOSENKO's statemerts on the case end

the way in which he learned about it.

The remairder of the dis-

â¢cussion covers events leading up n

confessions by the

JOHNSON couple and MINTKENBAUGH; the suostarice of treir admis-

sions, incising the security problems posed by Mrs. JOHNSON'S

mental condition and the Soviet concern

for her allress; and

the assessment of the damage to U.S. Irteresis caused by the

activities of JiHNSON.

lii! The Lead from NOSENKO

The agent was described by NOSENKO as being a U.S. ril1-

tary man, probably not an

officer, who served rightime guard

duty with others at

an American military instaliatior. in

France where an airfield vas

ard where top secret

documents were held in a vault which he had helped the KGB

to penetrate.

He was scheduled to leave France in May 1964.

Through him the KGÃ¶ acquired documents on U.S.

strategic bomb-

ing targets in the USSR and France;

"almost all" of these

materials were of interest to the Soviet Ministry of Defense,

NOSENKO said.

From early 1962 until the agent was promoted,

the KGB Legal Residency in Paris effected six ertries into

the room with the assistance of technicians from the Special

Section, KGB Second Chief Directorate?

Special Section,

titious entries into Western embassies in Moscow.

to the soviet Embassy in Paris as an employee, and he 18

believed to have replaced a suspect KGB offiser in this

overt position; he abruptly left Paris immediately after

NOSENKO's defectIon. NOSENKO indicated that FOFANOV was one

of several technicians transferred from the KGB Operational-

Technical Directorate to form

the Special Group of the KeB

Second Chief Directorate.

Paris "in case he will get access aÃ§air some time, even just a

quick possibility."

NOSENKO's statements concerning this lead

are given in cironological order below.

NOSE::KO said at the 23 January 1964 meeting* thit: he first

learned of the successful agert penetration of tre classified

documerts rault at an

"importart American military organization"

in the Paris area shortly after returning fron Geneva in June

NOSENKO did not know the designation or preciso nature of

the instaliation involved

In this operation, but because the

documents ircluded information on strategic targets in

France 88.

well as in the Soviet Union, he assumed that it was a "strategie

planning irstallation."

He also knew that the installation had

its our airfieid

that there were

"procedures for bringing top

secret documen's in and for taking them out."

There had been six successful entries of the vault, four

in 1962 and two in 1963.

On each occasion Special Section tech-

nicans had travelled TDY to Faris under courier cover to assist

the local KGB case

officer in the technical details of the opera-

Their function was to advise the case officer. concerning

the entry and later to process the documents.

The case officer,

on this basis, mould give appropriate instructions to his agent.

and it seemed probable to Nostriko that the technicians had never

met the American.

Entry into the vault area was first achieved after the

agent had used some radioactive substance to determine the com-

biration.

(NOSENKO thought that the agent had also photographed

the lock for KGB study.)

Subsecuent entries were always made

berntin two and five o'clock in the morning.

The agent removed

documerts fiom the vault and delivered them

to his case officer,

who in turn passed them to the Special Section techricians.

ervelopes were then opened, photographs were made, the documents

were repackaged, and the envelopes were given back to the agent

by the case officer for returr to che vault.

Thereafter,

Paris Legal Residency pouched the films to Moscow, and the

technicians themselves left Paris until the next opportunity

for entry.

his promotion, had obtained an extension until May 1964.)

though the agent was still active in January 1954 and was still

assigned to his military post, he therefore had lost access to

the documentary information.

NOSENKO characterized this

formation as highly sensitive and valuable to the KGB,

that the Chief of the Paris Legal Residency as well as several

case officers there had been rewarded for their part in the

operation.

Because of technical difficulties in recording the first

part of this meeting with NOSenKO.

cial technicians on 12 June 1962:

"The Chief of the Special

In speaking of IONOV's assignment

of KGB "flaps and seals" specialists

to France, NOSENKO apparently was not referring to the JOHN-

SON case; NOSENKO said he first heard about the case after

returning from Geneva in 1962, and JOHNSON stated firmly that

NOSENKO said on 6 ipril 1964 that before leaving Moscow.

Legal Residency agent had lost his access and that POFANOV was

sent to Paris in the nupe that the agent would again be able

to get into the vaul. refore his transfer to the United

States.+

When NOSTIO arrived at the Soviet Embassy in Paris or. 19 Janu-

Paris to instruit the Legal Residency case officer on the technical

aspects of the eniry but also was involved in photographing the

NOSEiKO tOld CIA on 28 January 1954 that he had learned

of this operation, shortly after returning to loscon from Geneva

in 1962.. from a friend in the KGS,

one of several technicians who

participared in the operation.

NOSENkO thought the source of this

information was either LEEEDEV OF FOFANOV.

During intensive debriefing on 6 April 1964 NOSENKO stated:

"I first reard about this from KARSTHIK)V." After describing the

functions of the Special Section in Moscow, he went on to say that

KARETNIKO! came frequently to the Tourist

Department to see him.

The reason for their association was thÃ¤t NOSEIKO then supervised

work with the hoscow hotels designated for use by foreign tourists,

Special Section set up equipment in various roums of

these hoteis.

The debriefing continued:

NOSENKO :

Why do they come to see me?. First of all, they krow

me quite well ard, secondly, simply because I super-

KARENIKOV told

me about this, in Paris.

Question:

What did KARETNIKOV say when you first heard about

this?

NOSENKO:

That they had carried out operations several times in

Paris, that two had already been there for this pur-

pose, that they went there as diplomatic couriers to

Paris...

(NOSENKO at this point repeated KARETNIKOV' g

description of the role of the Special section tech-

nicians in advising the Paris-based KGB case officer

and the methods which were used to gain initial access

to the vault.)

NOSENKO:

KARETNIKOV was the first and then LEBEDEV. LEBEDEV

was later.

he had already heard from LEBEDEV that the agent had

lost his access and that FOFANOV had been assigned

to Paris against the possibility that ne would re-

gain it.)

According to NOSENKO on 29 July 1964, he "first heard about.

'I haven't seen you in a long time, what have you boen doing?'

And he would say: 'Oh, I have just

been to Paris on a trip.' Or

mayba I asked KARENIKOV where LEHEDEV was because I hadn't seen

him in a long time, and he told me that LIEDEY was away on a

trip."

When asked on 29 July 1964 which officers had ever rentioned

this case to him, in any way at any tine, NOSeNKo replied "KARET-

NIKOV, LEBEDEV, and IONOV in Moscow and FOFAVOV in Paris in Janu-

ary 1964."

He affirmed that he had never discused the case wish,

or mentioned 1t to, anyone else.

"Yes," he continued, "I think

LEBEDEV was the first one to speak to me about this cese, oscause

1n 1962 I was Deputy Chief of the Seventh Department and was super-

vising the work of the Third Section

on hotels and restaurants.

LEBEDEV was a member of a commission which had been get up in the

KGB to plan for the operational exploitation of new hotels which

were being built or planned.

He was coming to see me about these

matters.

So while I might hear just a little bit about this from

IONOV, I would hear more

froM LEBEDEV, because he was a good friend

and was coming to my office on business."

The following is from the protocol which NOSENko aigneu on

18 February 1965:

"I first learned of the penetration of an American

installation in Paris after my return to Moscow in June 1962

and at & time that I was a conscious and willing coliaborator

of the CIA

and was attempting to gather information of inter-

est to Americar Intelligence.

I inmediately recogrized the

importance

of this information to American Intelligence when

I first heard it.

"I learned of this case in small pieces,

in several

conversations (some in my KGB office and possibly others

elsewhere) with several different officers of the KGB over

a period of several months.

These officers were KARETNIKOV,

IONOV, and LEBEDEV, all members of the Special Technical

Section of the Second Chief Directorate.

"I do not remember from which of these three officers

I first heard of the case, which of these officers told me

What portions of the story, or when I learned the irdivia-

ual details of this case which I have reported to CIA, oI

the season of the year in which I learned them.

"I do not know why these officers told me of the

Paris case,

except that we were in good relations:

such circumstances it frequentiy happens that KGB officers

will tell other KGB officers some details of operations on

which they are working. **

I don't know whether they told

other KGB officers this information.

As my relationg were

equally good with

each of those three officers, any of

This would place NOSENKO's earliest knowledge of the case some-

time after July 1962, when he said he became Deputy Chief of

the Tourist Department.

**This sentence was added at NOSENKO's request prior to signing

the protocol.

In 1952, JOHNSON was stationed in West Berlin were he wis

the acting first sergeant of a Transportation Corps company.

Despondent because he was passed over for promotion and not

the first sergeant position, and believing that his application

to marry would le disapproved, JoinisoN decided to defect to the

SOVIETS.

His first attempt to defect was aborted in February

1952 when HeÃ¤rig admitted to JOHNSON at the last minute that she

had lied to him when she had informed him earlier that she had

contasted the Soviet autorities in East Beriin and arranged for

their defection as he had requested.

he would be oi more use to the

Soviets if he were to remain in

at the same time to

JOHNSON to believe that the Soviets already had the document.

sometimes written reports to the soviets on their general contents.

JOHNSON believed

these discussions came up in connection with possible use of the

information involved was not worth the risk of his exposure.*

JOHNSON was asked on 18 February 1965 whether it would have

been possible for him to take original documents or copies

of them to his Soviet handlers.

He replied that he could

have forged receipts and taken a document fron the Center

Mental Condition of lecuik JOHNSOY

STE. JOHNSON's mental instability

first ranifested itself

in serious form in late 1960,

while sO iSON

was assigned to the

ordinance

agency of the Orleans Area Command in France.

At that time, Jollisor said she persisted in claiming trat

she was boing

followed by a black sedar, that there was a

nicrophone in the refrigerator, that she had been acquainted

with the recent American defectors dartin and Mitchell,

and that JOHNSON was having an affair-with a local French-

girl who stajed with their children.*

As a result, Mi's. JOHNSON was admitted to the Army

Hospital at La Chapelle,

France, in November 1960 and was

Jater noved to another hospital at Landstunl, Germany.

was under professional observation for about a month on this

occasion and returned home shortly before Christnas 1960.

Following her release from the hospital, Mrs. JOHNSON was

unable to sleep,

and as the local doctor would not prescribe

more than two sleeping pills a werk, JoHNSoN took her to

Vienna in January 1961.

After she had been

exanined, Joth-

SoN was told that she would have to remain in a private hospi-

tal there for an indefinite period of tine for medication.

When JOHSON later returned to vienna,

the hospital doctors

advised him to have vis.

JOHNSON live

for several years in

Vienna with her fanily or, as

an alternative,

in some other

large city with a German-speaking population

in order to

provide an environment to which she nad been accustomed.

She returned twice to Vienna for shock treatment and

examinations while JOHNSON remained in France.

When JOHN-

SON travelled to Vienna to get Mrs. JOHNSON after the second

of these visits in the fall of 1962, her doctor told him that

she had referred to him (JOINSON) as a "Russian general"

and had accused one of the nurses of bring a Soviet spy.

(Earlier, in the presence of neighbors, JOHNSON was accused

by his wife of being a spy.)

JOHNSON learned from his

father-in-law that Mes. JOMNSON had also told him that JOHN.

SON was a Russian general.

Eventually Mrs. JOHNSON was

persuaded to connit herself to a U.S. Army hospital, and at

the end of April 1964 she was evacuated from France

to Walter

Reed Hospital in Washington.

(JOHNSON and his children

returned to the United States several days later.) She was

released shortly afterward, but her erratic behavior, JOHN-

SON said, prompted his disappearance in October 196%.

The FBI report of this debriefing of JOHNSON states

â¢ that "as an overall analysis of his wife, he described her

Nevertheless, JOHNSON

on his own initiative did tell the French girl that he was a

Soviet spy, and he

sounded her out concerning her williagness

to work for the Soviets.

(e) Soviet Concern About Birs. JOHNSON's Illness

When it became apparent that his wife's treatment in

Vienna had been unsuccessful and that. he would have to

leave Orleans to find a more suitable environment for her,

JOHNSON discussed the

matter. in detail with his KGB case

officer.

In the fall of 1962, after he made photograpas

of the vault dour for URÂ¿HUMOY, "the Minox camera was re-

turned to the kussians.

This [according to JOHNSON!

was done

because of Soviet concern over Hedy's mental condition.

JOHNSON

was instructed to retain no incrininating naterials

in his possession."

After URZHUNOV learned of Mrs. JOHNSON'S

confinement in a U.S. military hospital, JOHNSON said he

became

"all shook up" about the possibility that she might

talk.

URZHUMOV told JOHNSON to inform his

wife that he was

no longer working for the Soviets, and JOiSON must never

again

bring her to an operational meeting.

URZHUNOV also

advisrd JOHNSON to cease all intelligence activity for a

while, and all espionage paraphernalia

was to be returned to

the Soviets.* Reviseu and more elaborate emergency contact

arrangenents, providing for contact in Vienna and

Washington

as well as Paris, were agreed upor to replace earlier, un-

successful procedures,

and preparations were made for JOhN-

SON's recape should he be compronised.

He said on 6 Janu-

ary 1965 that there was no particular pressure concerning

the emergency contact. and escape arrangements

there was always the question and concern that his wife

might talk."

Soviet fear that Urs. JOHNSON might talk also was re-

flected in the handling of WINTKENBAUGH in washington.

KENBAUGH explained to the FBI that "during the period

Hedy was confined to an Army hospital in Europe (November

and December 1960l his KCB case ofticer arranged with him

to effect an

'eye-to-eye' meeting-at-Brentano's Bookstore

visit the bookstore three times a woek for a three-week

The Soviet Indicated that this procedure was to be

adopted in order that it would be assured that Hedy had said

during her hospital confinement which would expose

the operation.

MINTKENBAUGH

said that he presumed that the

Soviets had efferted arrangements in Europe to become aware

in the event lody would reveal any facts concerning her know-

ledge of Soviet Intelligence.

In the event Hedy did talk

and a dangerous situation resulted, the Soviets were to ad-

vise MINTKENBAUCH through a drop or by a meeting."

has also said that the esplonage

*Compilation of the final damage assessment has been compli-

cated by three factors. One was the difficulty involved in

determining what specific documents may have passed through

the Orly Courier Transfer Station during his assignment there.

Second, since all documents remained

wrapped while at the

station,

JOHNSON himself has been of little assistance in

Identifying them, although he has said that he concentrated:

his selection on documents addressed to particular commands.

Firally, Armed Forces courier service records for this period

have been destroyed.

4. Unsuccessful Approaches to t.S. Citizens*

a. The HAPHSIONE Case

{1) Introduction

after providing the two promised leads** at his first

meeting with CIA on 9 June 1962, NOSENKO then volunteered

that the KGB-in 1958 or-1959 had made an unsuccessful. re=

cruitment approach to Richard C. HARMSTONE,

Secretary

at the U.s.

Enbassy in "loscow.

Inttially NOSENKO said that

the KGB had photographs of HARUSTONE in homosexual as well

as heterosexual

acts; but in 1964 he stated that although

the KGB knew MARYSTONE tO

be a honosexual, it had no photo-

graphs of hin in such activities.

The KGB,

thanks to micro-

phones in the limbassy, learned that HARUSTONE did sot tell

authorities the full story of the approach, omitting

ine approach was based partly on his homo-

sexuality.

HAFNSTONE'S report of the approach was

made in the imbassy.

When HARMSTONE was reassigned

from Moscow, a sunmary of his KGB file was turned over

the KGB First Chief Direciorate, and NOSENKO indicated

he was unawaro of

any developments in the case thereaiter.

Since the approsch

made prior to his transfer to the

U.S. Embassy Sectior of

Department in January

1960, NOSENKO said he did not personally participate in the

operation but was informed of it by V.M. KOVSHUK, Chief of

the Section.

HARUSTONE, a bachelor, was posted to Moscow in Octo-

ber 1957.

He went to the

security office in the Embassy

23 May 1959 to report a series of events which tad culminated

the day before in his having been approached for recruitment

by a self-admitted KCB officer (then known to HARNSTONE only

as "Sergey" but later identified as KOVSHUD)..

The approach

was based, with accompanying photugraphs,

on his alleged

homosexualits, ar ailegation

which HARMSTONE denied in his

Intervier by the Embassy

Security Officer.

He refused

collaborate, HARNSTONE said,

but he had agreed to meet. "Sergey"

on 23 May.

In keeping with

instructions from

U.s. authori-

ties, HARISTONE lunched with

"Sergey" that afterroon and

thereafter avoided holding meetings with him.

After his

reassignnent from Moscow in October 1959, HARKSTONE admitted

tá» the Department of State Security Office that he had a

homosexual background and the photographs shown to him by

KOVSHUK had been genuine, but he again claimed to have rejected

the recruitment attempt.

HARUSTONE subsequently resigned from

the Departnent.

Among the CHEREPANOV papers passed to the Moscow Embassy

in November 1963*** was a document dated August 1958 on the

KGB plans for operational activity against HARMSTONE.

Details on the HARUSTONE case fron NOSENKO and other

sources are presented below.

(11) Information from NOSENKO

On 9 June 1962, at his first meeting with CIA in Goneva,

NOSENKO said at the outset that he would sell two itons

information in return for the money he needed, and that he

would tell CIA no more. After he had-finished describing

the "ANDREY" case, however, he rolunteered a story about

HAR#STONE, a Second or Third Secretary at the American

bassy in loscow.

The KGB tried to recruit him,

but he re-

fused the approach.

Previously the KGB tad used both female

and male agerts against him, and the KCB had photographs of

the homosexual side

well as his activitles with girls.

NOSENKO believed that HAHNSTONE did not tell the whole story

to the U.S. officials, reporting only that there nad been

an approach to him based on compromise with

(NOSENKO did not say where he reported it, however.)

this meeting, having calied the BE, ITSKIY case the first

characterized the HARISTONE case thus: "HAFNSTONE.

This is alleady the third item. Be patient. That's

enough for today. (LÃ¤ughing.)"

In February 1964 at CIA Icquest, JOSENKO reviewed the

CHERERANOV documents,

one of which concerned a KGB plan for

operations against Richard HARMSTONE.

Part of the plan,

according to the document, eas to got HARiSTONE drunk and

photograph hin in intimate relations with a Soviet girl.

NOSENKO said this was in fact the way the KG3 did get the

material on which it based the later approach to him: "They

got him drunk.

At the

same time they had him photographed.

And after that they talked with

gence. ""

NOSENKO waS asked how thr KGB knew HARVSTONE had

not reported the approach.

He replied:

"He was monitored,

and we would have heard if anything about this matter was

reported.... Undoubtedly if he reported it, something would

Asked who tried to recruit HARYSTONE, he said, "I do

in the year 1958 or 1959.

I don't know who was the

case officer who spoke to HARNSTOVE."

Asked if this officer

was still in the American Department, he replied:

NOSENKO repeated his assertion

that he could not identify

addirg that he had learned of the case from KOVSHUK.

also repeated his statements that the KGB knew HARNSTONE

HARUSTONE had left the Soviet Union rot long after the ap-

proach was made, toward the end of lis tour,

The KCB also knew HARMSTOE to be a

homosexual,

but did not nave ans pictures of him in this kind

of activity; the KGB did have, however, a serles of nude

pictures of

After HARUSTONE left

Mosco:, NOSENKO added, a summary of his file was given

the First Chiet Directorate, but he rever heard whether they

had made an attempt to contact hir thereafter.

(111) Information from Other Sources

HARKSTONE, ore of the econoric attaches at the Embassy,

shared an office with William TURPIS, also an econonic

attache, until TURPIN was replaced in August 1958 by George

WINTERS

and HARSSIUNE worked together until MAry-

STONE firished his tour in October 1959.

The KCB plans for operational activity against HARISTONE

outlined in the CHEREPANOV document dated

closely with information reported in Foreign S-rvice dis-

patches by TURPIN, HARMSTONE,

and janes RAISEY, and sub-

sequently confirmed by HAPKSTONE in interviews conducted by

no further details on the case.

(11) Information from BINDER

Mester Sergeant Peter BINDER arrived in Hoscow, where

he was assigned as manager of America House, on 16 March 1961.*

He was approached by the KGB on 15 January 1963 ard reported

the AGS citempt to l'.S. Embassy officials the same day.

22 January 1963 BINDER

was withdrawn from Moscow before the

completion of his tour.

At the airport as he was leaving,

the Soviets attempted to prevert his departure by saying

that he had rever beer properly accredited to the USSR.

The plane was delajed for about 15 minutes while a heated

exchange took place between Soviet officials and the American

officers accompanying BINDER.

He then was allowed to leave.

The letter contained numerous allegations

against BINDER,

which the interrogator proceeded to list.

After asking whether BINDER was acqualatod with

Mr. LOHRER of the west Cerman isbassy, the interrogator

asked if BINDER had given LOHSR goods to sell on the

Soriet market.

-In April 1962, BINDER told MORELLI that Hugh

NTGOMERY had arrived at the U.S. Embassy as Security

Officer, that HONTCOWZRY was & good friend of bin, and

that be had told BOSIONERY about his affair with

SORELitI but HONTCONERY had told him not to worry about

-BINDER told MORELLI and Sietlana IVArOVA that

trained spy" and thai MORELLI and IVAJOVA should there-

fore be carsful of hia.

In describing his conversation at the Militia station,

BINDER said

5. Operations Involving Other westerners

a. Tabulation

(1) Introduction

NOSENKO has provided identifying information on 90 YGB agents,

probable agents, and operational contacts of western (but non-

American) citizenship and he has described an additional 12 de-

velopment and investigation operations against

such third-country

nationals.

the folloring tabulation, 55 of

NOSENKO's recruitment leads and five of

the 12 anvestigative

and developmenta! leads were contained in the notes which he

brought to the meetirgs with CIA in Gereva in 1964 and

which

en-

abled him to provide

specific information on these individuals,

for exampie, their dates of birth and precise dates of recruit-

ment.

At the same time,

however; NOSENKO generally furrished

comparatively fever details concerning the KGB

operations against

other Westerners than he did in his leads to American cases;

often his information did not exceed that written in the notes.

He has disclaimed personal participation in all bu: icur of his

recruitment leads

and two of his investigation/developrent cases.

For the most part HOSENKO's foreign leads are based upon informa-

tion which he said he learred casually and noted for passage to

CIA during the time he was Deputy Chief of the Tourist

Depart-

ment in 1962 and 1963.

(With certain exceptions,

NOSEYXO nas

been questioned less

about his other lestern leads than about his

American cases, particularly with regara to

sourcing.

Most of

NOSENKO's non-American leads were passed by CIA in 1964

to the

appropriate foreign security services, and as yet the results of

many of

their investigations are incomplete.

In a few cases, in

vestigations were conducted abroad by CIA representatives with

the results as shown in the tabulation below.

inder this tabu-

lation,

the leads are presented in alphabetical order of their

country of rationality.

In cases where NOSENKO has provided no

specific source for his irformation but has indicated that the

Tourist Department was involved at a

time he has said he was

assigned there, note of this is made in the

"sourcing" column.

The VASSALL Case

Information from NOSEiKO

At the 11 June 1962 meeting with CIA, NOSENKO first mention-

ed the lead which was later equated with William J.C. VASSALL, the

KGB agent in the British Admiralty.

Neither then nor later in

1962 did NOSENKO identify this agent by name.

NOSENKO was asked on 11 June 1962 whether he had ever heard

af the KGS agent George BLAKE, "the

man who compromised the fanois

cunnel operation in Berlin."*

NOSENKO replied:

"Yes, I did.

I'll tell you this, that there was a far more important Englishmi

cho was our agent than BLiKE.** He is a very big man,

and from him

ve get all kinds of materials.

We get all the details about NATO.

He is our number one agent, the best of all intelligence informa-

tion. He had reen in Moscow, and

we recruited hin there.

him on a homosexiality charge, a very extreme one involving multi-

ple persons.

The case officers who recruited him received the

Order of Lenin...

He is not an intelligence man.

He is a high-

ranking mar.

He is working on all kinds of NiTO matters and is

delivering mos: valuable information...

He was in Moscow some

time ago.

My friend and three others in the KGB section running

him received the Order of Lenin.

That is a very high distinction

for the KGB...

I do not know the man's name, cut I do know when

he was in Moscow, and I know that he has a very high position.

He is in London now." NOSENKO was reluctant to go into further

details at this, his second meeting with CIA, but he added:

tell you all about him tomorrow, my brothers.

I will tell you

many things tomorrow, and the day after...

This is our number

one operation. There is no sun of money we would not be willing

to pay him."

The next day NOSENKO was asked for additional information

about the

"high level British agent,"

and he told his case offi-

"I don't know the exact content of the material (he was

giving) except that they were very valuable military documents,

and I know that he even brought in draft copies when he was here

in Moscow.

He went to Londor,

ard I believe he works in a Minis-

I think it is in the office of the First lord of the Admir-

alty. He still meets with our case officer even now.

He brings

them extremely valuable material.

He is either a deputy or a

First Secretary, or a member of

the secretariat; the most im-

portant thing being that all material of the greatest signifi-

cant value passes through his hands.

He was recruited in 1956

I don't know when he returned to Lordon, but he was

working with the (KGB Legal) Pesident there, who was at that

time a man whose name is Major General (N.B.) RODIN.***

BLAKE, a British MI-6 officer, has admitted that he informed

the KGB of the Berlin tunnel operation (which involved the

intercept of Soviet and East. German telephone conversations

orior to the time the operation became

active in May 1955; it was terminated in April 1956.

** In September 1964 CIA sought more details from NOSENKO about

He responded:

NOSENKO said:

"BLAKE? Who is BLAKE?" when reminded,

don't know what kind of information he

what kind or

gave now much.

I think he gave information,

but: I don't know

This is a mistake on what I supposedly

said before." For a further discussion of BLAKE, See Part

He returned about a year ago from Copenhagen.

He

was there as the (KGB Legal)

Resident, under the cover of First

Secretary.

Prior to that he was the Chief of a section in the

English Department of the Second Chief Directorate.

That was

about three years ago, ard at that time he personally recruited

the Englishman."

NOSENKO told .:CIA on 13 June 1962 that the "high-level

British agent" had on one occasion provided a report on an Anglo-

American conference in Loncon, which contained referenÃ§es to

American and British Intelligence operations.*

meeting in 1962, a day later, NOSENKO again stated that RODIN

had received the Order of Lenin for his part in the operation.

When asked whether the name KOROVIN meant anything to him in

connection with operations against the British, he replied: "I

have

heard that nine.

Possibly he is the man in London now. "**

After recontacting CIA in 1964, NOSENKO reported that he

had alreary provided almost all he knew about VASSALL, who had

been arrested in 1962.

VASSALL, NOSENKO summarized, was re-

cruited in Moscow and turned over copies of official Embassy

documents while there. After he returned to England and while

he was working in the Admiralty, he was considered to be the

KGB's best agent.

His value, NOSENKO said, was indicated by

the fact that CHURANOV had received a KGB award for his role

in the recruitment and then later, when VASSALL was producing

in England, the Order of Lenin along with RODIN, the handling

officer in London.***

NOSENKO on 1 February 1964 said: "In general it was known

from some source important information was coming in from

the British, specifically, information about NATO.

as the NATO Intelligence Services would hold a meeting in

London, we had the information as to what was discussed.

When the American, Canadian, and British groups met in

London. The material came in from that VASSALL,

someone else--I don't know." On 8 September 1964 NOSENKO

commented further that in 1960 or 1961,. about the same time

he heard about these materials, he also learned that the

KGB First Chief Directorate had a good source: in British

counterintelligence.

NOSENKO said that he did not know

Whether VASSALL had access to this type of information or

whether this indicated another source.

** NOSENKO was asked on 29 January 1964 whether RODIN, VASSALL'S

handler

in London, was also known as KOROVIN. He replied he

thought so.

***Questioned on CHURAVOV's reaction to VAsso'd sast: moell,

This is the end of my career and I'll never go

abroad again."

Shortly afterwards,

CHURANOV went to GRIBANOV

to ask to be returned to the Second Chief Directorate for this

reason.

NOSENKO added a few details concerning the compromise of

The KGB, he said, had

evidence uf honosexual acts

between VASSALL and one homosexual, but then the KGB managed to

acquire photographs of him

involved with three homosexuals at the

sare time. NOSaKO has unable to

recall the nines of two of them,

whose KGB cryptonyns were

CHURANOV told NOS-

ENKO that VASSALL was 'really shocked" and became sick when he

worried in 1963 when it was reported

in an article ky Joseph

"I remember," NOSENKO said,

levei place, inose name was VASSALL.*

When they asked me now I knew, I said we have

records here that he was given VASSALL's inaterial to read in

correction with his own work."

NOSENKO said on & September 1954 that his fears that tre

articles in the western press might eventually bring him under

suspicion were allayed wren he learned from CHURMOV sone time

later that the First Chief Directorate had reluctantly decided

that GOLITSYN must have been the

the VAssalL lead. The

leaders of the First Giief Directorate did not want to believe

at first that SOLITSYN was the source of the lead, but it was

known that although GOLITSYN did not know VASSALl's rame, he had

on one or two occasions translated materials received from

(11) Information from GOLITSYN

On 26 March 1962 GOLITSIN

was being interviewed by British

authorities and provided information leading to the identifica-

tion of VASSALL as a KGB agent.

GOLITSY: said that he worked

in the International Treaty

Organizations Section of the Infor-

mation (Reports) Department "of the KGB First Chief Directorate,

from September 1959 until May 1960.

During this period he re-

ceived documents from the British Admiralty which were copies

of papers from top Admiralty officials concerning the construc-

tion and financial expenditures relating to a naval base at

Clyde, dated July 1959.

On the basis of many of these docu-

GOLITSIN had to prepare a report for the Soviet Minister

of Defense.

He said that he was told that the British Depart-

ment of the First Chief Directorate had also disseminated such

information, ard

after contacting the Pritish Department he was

a large file of copies of original documents from British

Admiralty, including documents of the First and Second Lords of

the Admiralty.

(The documents he read were Russian translations

of copies of original British docunents.)

There were other

documerts covering all Admiralty activity mercioning navy bases,

fleet commands in the Mediterranean,

Aden and other cities in

the Mediterranean area.

There were also docurents dealing with

bases in England ard concerning important questions and deci-

sions in the hamiralty:

According to GOLITSYN, these documents were received from

an agent source ir. London, covered the period 1958-53,.

usually received at two-month intervals.

He related that he had

talked in 1955 to a KGB officer friend, Ye. G. KASKCiEYEV, * who

was recalled to the USSR in 1954 from London.

KASHCHEYEV told

GOLITSYN that at that period KGB had two other important agents,

one of whom was BLAKE.

The other important source was working

in naval intelligerce in 1954, but GUI.IISYN sald he did not know

the identity of the KGB officer handling the ramiralty agent

He suggested, however, it could have seen A.V. BARANCV

because that officer received the Order of Lenin for. his work in

England at about that time.

During a 5 April 1961 interview GOLITSYi was shown a selec-

tion of documerits concerning the British Naval Command Organiza-

tion in the Mediterranean.

He selected two cocuments he thougnt

although he

said he was not sure,

These

documents were: (a) Internal Admiralty Memorandim,

Subject:

"Commard in the Mediterranean," dated 2 July 1959; and (b) inter-

nal Admiralty documents,

Subject: "Unified Headquarters for the

Middle East," dateÃ¤ 22 January 1960.

When GOLITSYN was shown additional British documents on

7 April 1962, he recalled he had seen documerts

concerning "the

whole infrastructure program, the whole of NATO." as well as

documerts concerning rotes of meetings held in the Admiralty.

GOLITSYN said on 25 May 1962 that the photographic repro-

ductions of the documents were of medium or better quality, in-

dicating they had been reproduced by a process better than

hand-

held Minox camera production.

On 11 June 1962, British officials

passed to CIA a list

of 20 candidates,

including VASSALL, resulting

from their inves-

tigation of the GOLITSYN lead.

(The investigation was not being

pursued along the lines of the KASHCHEYEV lead mentioned above,

concerning a source in naval intelligence in Lordon in 1954 who

have been recruited in Moscow.)

CIA provided the British

â¢ on 17 June 1962 with preliminary details

on what NOSENKO had

reported about the KGB source in the British Admiralty.: On

18 June 1962 the British indicated to CIA that the list of 20

candidates had been narrowed to two individuals, one of whom

WaS VASSALL.

Full details of NOSENKO's information on this

case were passed by CIA to the British on 20 August 1952.

By 12 September 1962 British authorities had focused

sufficiently on VASSALL to arrest him. VASSALL immediately

confessed.

(iii) Information from VASSALL

On the day of his arrest, 12 September 1962, VASSHuL con-

'fessed thai he had

spied for the soviets almost continuously since

the spring of 1955."

lA search of his quarters immediately after.

his arrest resulted in the discovery of 15 rolls of exposed film

which, wher. developed, revealed 140 pho-ographs of pages from 17

official hamiralty documents dated betweer. 24 July and 3 September

1962; all were reported to be secret documents,

"the exposure of

which would gravely damage the security of the state.")

In his

confession,

VASSALL described his recruitment by CHURANOV and

another man, know. only as "Sikolay" ir March 1955 or. the basis

of compromising photographs taken during the course of a "homo-

sexual orgy" involving himself and a runker of Soviets. at the

Berlin Hotel in Moscow at the end of October

1954.

From about

September 1955 on until he returned-to England, VASSALL bought

KOS silence by bringing CHURAVOV and "Nikolay" documents from

the British Embassy.

In May 1956, in anticipation of his depar-

ture for home, vasSAlL. was introduced to a third Soviet, subse-

quently identified as RODIN/KOROVIN, who was to become his con-

tact in Lordon.

Their first meeting in England took place about

the end of August 1956.

VASSALL continued to meet RODIN once

every three weeks until the arrest of Soviet Illegal Gordon LONS-

DALE in January 1961, which resu'ed in a four morth moratorium

on personal meetings.

To these meetings VAsSAlL would bring docu-

ments that he obtained from his office

in the Naval Intelligence

Division of the Admiralty; the ducuments would be photographed

and returred to VASSALL durirg the sane meeting.

Several months after RODIN had

troken off contact as are-

sult of the LONSDALI: arrest, VASSAlL was contacted by N.P. KAR-

PEKOV**and there were

infrequent meetings from then

until May

1962.

It was not until May 1962, however, that VASSALL was told

to resume his espionage collection; he nas trained to operate an

Exakta camera and used it thereafter until his arrest.

The last

two meetings with KARPEKOV took place on 13 arid 17 August 1962.

At the meeting on 13 August, KARPEKOV tola VASSALL that he was

going away on holiday and the further meeting four days later

was arranged so that VASSALL could hand over anything he had

obtained before KARFEKOV left. At their final meeting, KARPEKOV

arranged for their next meeting to take place on 30 October 1962.

(KARPEKOV left London for the Soviet Union on 6 September 1962.)

By VASSALL's account, the first time he received any money

from the Soviets was just before Christmas 1955, when he was

VASSALL served in Moscow as clerk in the office of the British

Naval Attache from 3 March 1954 until 2 June 1955, when he

** KARPEKOV was identified to British authorities as a KGB offi-

cer by

KGB double agent Boris BELITSKIY (see Part VI.D.6.) in

April 1960, before KARPEKOV was handling VASSALL. RODIN was

reassigned from London in April 1961. BELITSKIY gave CIA the

on his returr. to England, RODIN and later KARPEKOV paid

him sums varying from 50 to 200 pounds.. According to vASSALL.

the annual totals of these amounts varied between

500 and 700

pounds, an estimate which the British consider

"modest, to say

the least" judging from VASSALL's luxurious way of life.

6. The BELITSKIY Operation

a.. Introduction

When NOSENKO first contacted CIA in June 1952, one of the

two. pieces of information which he said he was willirg to sell

was

the fact that the CIA

agent BELIISKIY was under KCB control.

(B. Ye. BELITSKIY, a Radio Moscow broadcaster and Soviet Govern-

ment interpreter.

had been a CIA agent in place since his recruit-

ment

at the Brussels Exposition in Septenber 1953.)

At the time

NOSENKO made his irformation known, BELITSKIY had met CIA repre-

sentatives in the West

in debriefing sessions on three separate

occasions.

The last occurres in Gereva in May 1962 while BELIT-

1 SKIY was serving as an interpreter for a mio Conferense.

time NOSENKO was also in Gereva, participating in the Disarmament

ConfeIENCE.

b. Information from NOSENKO

(i) Statements in 1962

In the discussions with CIA officers on 9 and 11 June 1962.

NOSENKO revealed considerable information on BELITSKIY.

He also

described his own connection with the case and offered his opinion

on how CIA should proceed in the light of his revelations.

He

claimed that he had first heara of the RELITSKIY case, by its

code name "BELKIN," when he was working in the U.S. Embassy Section.

American Department, KGB Second Chief Directorate.

Not directly

involved with the agent, he lcarted of the case through his friend-

ship with the chief of the section (name not given) which was then

runnirg him.*

"So I already knew there was this 'BELKIN, '" saia

NOSENKO.

He did rot acÃ¼ively participate in the case, however,

until the spring

of 1962.

During his tour with the Disarmament

Confererce, NOSENKO said, he received a cabie fron Moscow direct-

ing him to give advice to the "young" and "inexperienced" case

officer, V.L. ARTEMYEV in thÃ© event that American Intelligence

should contact BELITSKIY in Geneva.

Actually, NOSENKO continued,

the Second Chief Directorate had

"inserted" BELITSKIY into the

WHO delegation in the hope that CIA would "find him."

There was

such a contact, NOSENKO said, and therefore he knew about the

handling of the case insofar

as the Geneva meetings were con-

cerned, although he had not been personally involved in it be-

fore.

NOSENKO described BELITSKIY as a KGB agent whom the Americans

had recruitea in London and never met inside the soviet Union.

NOSENKO stressed both of these points a numoer of times:

knew that in due course he was recruited in London...'

There was:

never any contact with him inside."

NOSENKO stated that BELIT-

SKIY was an agent of the American Department in 1962, although

he had once worked for the Second (British) Department. He

NOSENKO said that at that time he himself was Deputy Chief of

the U.S. Embassy Section. It follows from this that he would

have become aware of the BELITSKIY case between January 1960

and January 1962,

In 1964 NOSENKO identified the friend who

had told him about BELITSKIY as V.I. PETROV, Chief of the

Second Section, American Department, responsible for pene-

trating American Intelligence operations, mainly those in

the UssR.

claimed not to know the date of recruitment but said that he

knew that the case was already in progress during his second

assignment with the U.S. Embassy Section lanuary 1969-Janusry

1962), and "The first time he went abroad he was already our

agert. He had been our agent for a long,

long time...

NOSENKO indicated that the KGB's purpose in rurning the

BELITSKIY operation was to lure American Intelligence into meet-

ing with the agent inside the Soviet Union.

In this way, the

â¢KGs hoped to learn the channels and means through which Aterican

Intelliger.ce cormunicated with agents inside the

Soviet Union:

said NOSEiKO, was the "most

important task" of

Chief Directorate.

Although BELITSKIY, ir meeting with his Am-

erican case officers, contirually pleaded fear of contacting or

being cuntacted by mesican Intelligence in Moscow, NOSENKO

claimed that this was a ruse and that the real KGB intent was to

use BELITSKIY "to Â¿rad you to us - to the Soviet Union - so that

you would wors with him ro: abroad."

He said that after BELIT-

SKIY was recruitad ir. Lenson, CIA

"did not go on with him...

didn t hold 'any nectargs with him."

Nevertheless, he said; the

KGB "cherished the hope....o lead him in somewhat deeper...well,

now they have."

NOSENKO commented that the KGB First Chief Directorate,

with its own responsibilities ard objectives, was unaware of the

purpose of the Second Chief Directorate in the BELITSKIY case.

The First Chief Directorate,

through Department D.

provided

dezinformatsiya (disinformation, referred to by NOSENKO as

"deza")

Second Chief Directorate's request, but in this

case, as in other

"games," it did not know for what ultinate

purpose the "Â¿eza" would be used.

NOSENKO indicated that in

such cases I.I.

Â¿GAYANTS, Chief of Department D, did not even

in what country the disinformation was to be used, let alone

the identity of the agent.

The Second Chief Directorate, more-

was at liberty to add or discard items from the "deza" pro-

vided by Department D.*

NOSENKO stated that after the directive from Moscow arrived.

he participated in the direction of BELITSKIY's meetings with

the American case officers,

advising ARTEMYEV on specific steps

to be taken.=

example.

NOSENKO said, when the American case

officers asked

EELITSKIY whether he could establish contact

with sone Soviet on the Disarmament Delegation, NOSENKO advised

ARTEMYEV not to use anyone from the Soviet Ministry of Foreign

Affairs. Rather, he told ARTEMYEV that BELITSKIY should pretend

* While on this general subject, NOSENKO commented that the

Second Chief Directorate was looking to the day when its: offi-

in the field would not have to be subordinate to the KGB

Legal Resident in a given country, always a member of the

First Chief Directorate.

In Geneva, NOSENKO said, the local

Legal Resident was "weak" and "over-cautious."

According to

NOSENKO, this man had been ordered by Moscow to help in the

BELITSKIY case "if anything is reeded" but tried to interfere

with the actual running of the case.

At that point, NOSENKO

told him: "We don't need your help. We shall run it our-

Concerning

the individuals involved in this case, NOSENKO

related that BELITSKIY had been met

ican case officer "Pob" and later also by "Henry'" who was "calied

From the KGB standpoint, while BELTSKIY

NOSENKO strongly and repeatedly advised CIA to "continue the

game" but under no circumstances to meet the agent inside the

Soviet nion.

ests" to continue to play SELITSKIY, and he remarked that the

terminated - he and ARTEMYEV were the only officers abroad who

knew about the operation.

(ht that very moment, he said, the :

KGB was walting for someone to arriva in Moscow and contact the

agant.):

.: NOSENKO proposed a plan through which Cl: could cause

the KGB, to send BELITSKIY abroad again, and two days later he

again urged that this plan be adopted: CIA should choose an

elderly couple who were travelling to the USSR and give them

letter to mail to BELITSKIY immediately on their arrival, in the

letter there should be a hint through which BELITSKIY land tha

BELITSKIY abroad again in order to continue the "game.".

reaction would be in line with the mission of the Second Chief

Directorate "to recruit the foreigrers...

and then pass them on

to you for your recruitment.

That is our mission - give our own

Russians to you for recruitment and recruit foreigners." NOSENKO

also continued:

"Don't trust him for a second but.... give the

impression that you believe him." He stressed that the travellers

chosen for this task be "elderly," that they not be connected with

CIA in any way, end, most important, that they mail the letter

immediately on their arrival.

NOSINKO also advised CIA to do

something acout the safe apartment in which "Bob" and "Henry"

had met BELITSKIY.

He complained that BELITSKIY had noted that

the name on the door was not that of the American Counsellor

whose apartment it was

supposed to be, and he said that BELITSKIY

had also reported that he felt it had an "un-lived in" look.

(11) Statements 1B 1964

When he came to the West again in 1964, NOSENKO again dis-

cussed the BELITSKIY case.*

In January 1964, he was asked his

advice about CIA's handling BELITSKIY.

Again he suggested that

CIA

"continue the plan" in order to determine

"what actions they

will undertake when they will see that you do not plan to hava

Moscow contacts. "

He commented:

"You have a realistic basta

for not doing this in view

of the PENKOVSKIY case,

again he expressed the opinion that "what they are trying to Ã o

in this case

is to pull for a Moscow contact...

that you would go out to meetings with him in Moscou."

Second Chief Directorate did not consider the BELITSKIY case a

big operation: "it was only a small success from our viewpoint."

NOSENKO ciained, as he had in 1962,

to have been personally

involved in directing the meetings BELITSKIY had had with the

Americans in Geneva.

NOSENKO said he did not knon who recruited BELIT-

SKIY for the KGB, but it was not PETRov..

This operation, like

all "games" of the Second Section, was supervised by M.G. MATVEYEV,

Deputy Chief of the American Department..

On 2 February 1954, when the CIA case

officer suggested that perhaps RELIISKIY might not have reported

everything to the KG3, especially the anourt of money he had

been given by CIA, NOSENKO agreed that perhaps this was so "be-

c. Information from Other Sources

BELITSKI'S was a chemist by training and a translator and

radio commertator by profession.

At the time of his recruit-

ment, and throughout his relationship with CIA, he was employed

by Radio Moscod.

Fluent in English, he was used primarily as

a scientific commentator on programs beamed to the British Isles.

In addition to his radio work, BELITSKIY frequently served as an

interpreter for the Soviet Government, both at home and abroad.

and achieved considerable recognition

in this capacity during

such widely publicized events as the POWERS trial

and GAGARIN'S

visit to England.

Ostensibly he was fully trusted by the Soviet

authorities ard was allowed

an unusual degree of freedom in his

association with foreigers.

HELITSKIY was recruited by CIA in Brussels in September

1958 while he was serving as an interpreter

at

the Soviet Pavil-

Â¡on of the world's Fair.

During the period in which he was beirg

assessed as a potential

agent,

BELITSHIY created the impressions

that:

first.

he was not in full agreement with the current sov-

iet

regime and probably even harbored some grudge against

trie

soviet system because nis father hÃ¤d been purged under STALIN:

second, he was not averse to considering defection at some future

date, provided he could do so with his wife; and third, he was

eager to pick up extra money, in return for which he was willing

to provide information acquired in the course of his duties.

Leads to BELITSKIY had come to CIA from three separate

All of these sources had, however, been introduced to

BELITSKIY through Aline MOSBY, a free-lance journalist whon BE-

LITSKIY had known in Brussels.

(BELITSKIY later admitted that

he had had an affair with MOSBY.) CIA's initial contact was

made through the services of Karl KOG!, a former CIC employee,

then working for Radio Free Europe (REE), who had befriended

BELITSKIY.*

KOCH was used only to make the introduction to a

CIA case officer; he was not told the nature of CIA's interest

KOCH furnished several reports on BELITSKIY to his security

officer in RFE.

It seemed obvious from KOCH's reports that BE-

LITSKIY did not manage his financial affairs well.

according to KOCH, developed a foolproof system for beating

the roulette wheel and had once asked KOCH to take him to a

certain place where he could try out his system.

KOCH, BELITSKIY on this occasion won about $320 but,

ing to leave a winner," he threw the money back on the table.

Subsequently he lost everything at the same game, and as he was

to leave for home shortly, was very anxious to get some money

with which to buy some presents.

* KOCH had been dismissed from CIC, charged with misconduct in

the performance of his duty.

He was accused of violating

direct orders and involving CIC in a possibly erbarrassing

incident, plus trying to coerce another CIC employee to make

a favorable report on an individual aliegedly formerly connect-

ed with a Soviet or Hungarian Intelligence sÃ©rvice.

KOCH further reported that BELITSKIY had "opened up to him

during their automobile trip to the gambling house and had dis-

cussed a wide range of persoral subjects, including his child-

hood, his work,

and his life in the Soviet Union.*

He allegedly

told KoCH that he was somewhat unhapp! because he was prevented.

on account of his jewish origin,

from advancing as far as he

thought his abilittes merited.

KOCH also reported that BELITSKIY

told him that his wife had visited the Brussels Fair as a tourist:

KOCH said that BELITSKIY obviously had "moments of great doubt"

about the wisdom of speaking freely to him leven naively asking

nim if he were

"D").

but that he, KOCh, felt that BELITSKIY did

so because he needed someone to talk to and he felt he could trust

KOCH to be discret.

KOCH stated that BELITSKIY had "protested

he would never defect," but that Kodi felt that he would "jump

if he saw a way oit."

KOCH was cooperative on learning that CIA

wished to be introduced to BELITSKIY.

He lent his apartment for

the initial contact and remaired out of earshot for some 45 min-

utes, while the irterview was taking place.

KOCH told BELITSKIY

that te

"suspected" that the "frierd" to whoin he was going to

introduce hin was an American Intelligence officer.

At the ini-

tial cortact (time was snort) BELITSKIY was offered the opportu-

nity to work in place

in return for a guarantee of future finan-

cial

in resettling in the dest, plus wratever small

current reimbursement he could satisfactorilv cover.

BELITSKIY

appeared surprised, but rather pleased.

He was willing to oper-

ate as CIA suggested for the time neing.

Financial arrangements

were made, and BELITSKIY was briefed on

fairly gereral, but high

priority, positive intelligence requirements.

He was given a

secret writing communication system and agreed, according to

the terms of his contract, to communicate with

Cia by means of

this system within four months of the date of his return to the

USSR.

In the two years prior to his recruitment, BELIISKIY had

on several occasions been rather outspoken during conversations

with certain Nesterners with whom he had come in cortact.

frankness concerning his disaffection with certain aspects of

Soviet life as they affected his career as weil

on several occasions (including an episode in which he tried to

borrow money from a member of the British Embassy in Paris sev-

eral years earlier), had convinced the British intelligence Ser-

vice (MI-Ã³) that he was a provocation agent.

In talking with

the CiA case officer who questioned him about this frankness,

BELITSKIY stated that he had been trying to make contact with

either British or American Intelligence

"for the past three

years", but that he had "rot been able to do so securely."

added that he felt he had been "very careful" to whor he had

spoken frankly. He said that he had "trusted" KOch and had

felt that KOCH could "put him in touch with the proper persons."

The possibility of BELITSKIY's being a Soviet provocation

was thoroughly and frequently considered, both initially and

as the case progressed.

In view of available evidence, com-

bined with the personal impressions of the CIA case officer who

In August MI-6 gave CIA its view:

BELITSKIY had come to London with a Soviet intelligence brief:

his attempts to contact Nesterners were so blatant that the KGB

must have known about them; but it was possible that not all of

the agent's activities were necessarily controlled by the KGB.

In September 1960 CiA advised MI-6 of its agreement that BELIT-

"urdoubtedly had an RIS mission when he came to the uk

earlier this year," adding the opinion that he probably had

been used in the past by the KGB; also, that the only way to

resolve the unexplained points, CIA stated, was to engage in a

secure interrogation which would include a polygraph examina-

As of October 1960 the CIA position on the case was

stated as follows:

"As matters now stand we have our doubts

as to the bona fides of BELITSKIX, but are not convinced that

all his actions have been controlled by the RIS.

We consider

him too valuable a potential source to drop without exploring

all possible avenues of investigation.

relationship with the Kob.

ts explained that he was frequertly

in contact with persors whom he suspected to be kob, both

in

his work at Radio Moscow and particularly in correction with his

but that his only official briefing by the KSB

was in connection with the Poilas trial.

On another oscasion,

he said, he was told how to handle himself if the wrong" ques-

tions were asked

at the MARTIN/MITCHaLL press conference in

MoscoW,

but this

was not openly a kGB briefing.

BELITSKIY also

indicated that all travellers leaving the USSR were routinel!

interviewed and briefed, and were told to "sort of keep their

eves open" to locate potential targets of information.

He said

he felt

that "whatever he had been

able to do along this line"

had resulted in his being given Â¿cy's abroad and having relative

freedom of movement:

At the end of the london debriefings it was concluded by

MI-6 and CIA that BELITSKIY "did not appear to be practicing

deception or to be

controlled by the RIS."

Both did agree, how-

even the tease here me ord heel that time was

The majority view at that time was

that the agent's prime motivation was a financial one, coupled

with an assurance of CIA assistance upon his defection.

It was

also believed that BELITSKIY had by then become so deeply in-

volved with CIA that it would be very difficult for him to break

of 1962.

The CIA case

for a

total of approximately 12 hours.

At this series of debriefings

a second American case officer was irtroduced.

In his report on

the contact

the original case officer stated that he felt

"stronger than ever that

Subject's potential as an agent is

unlimited."

He stated that his original views on SELITSKIY'S

bona fides had not changed and that he felt the latter realized

that he had passed the point when he could afford to report his

collaboration with CIA to the KGB.

The second case officer

reported that the reservations which he had had about the agent's

bone fides before the meetings with him had been dispelled by

the latter's manner.

He also reported, however, that on two

occasions during the meetings he had had a "sinking feeling"

that "the relationship was not kosher."

He said that during

the discussion of the two factions which BELITSKIY claimed

were then vying with each other in the Soviet Union (the

"moderates"

vs. the "hard-liners"), he had the feeling "that

the tale was concocted and maybe the agent was trying to convey

Throughout the course of this operation various individuals

participating in it expressed doubts about BELITSKIY's boRa

fides.

Whatever doubts may have existed, however, they did

not affect the conduct of the case:. the general consensus was

that the agent was not controlled

by the KGB, and the case

continued to be run as if he were

not.

Moreover, the poly-

graph examiner reported that BELITSKIY had been

"substan-

tially truthful in his answers to the questions asked," al-

though he did recommend that the agent be re-examined under

controlled conditions.

to U.S. authorities sotething

that someone war.ted to have convey-

ed and could rot have done through normal charrels."

The second

case officer was also struck by a change which he perceived in

BELITSKIY's manrer when they were discussing the matter of con-

tact inside the Soviet Union: At first,

BELITSKIY was very con-

cerned, but toward the end of the meeting he seemed to abandon

all caution ard to be quite happy about it, even suggesting that

a CIA courier could perhaps bring him some scarce goods.

Throughout: the relationship, however, BELITSKIY exhibited

great concern for his personal safety.

open letters containing secret writing.

He felt that under such circumstances he would

stand

a better chance of refuting any accusations.

since there

would be no evidence that he had responded to the overtures of

American Intelligence.

BELITSKIY also expressed concern on sev-

eral occasions for the case officers' welfare as it related to

his own, cautioning them, for instance, never to go to Berlin

or to Moscow.

BELITSKIY was deemed from the first to have

In addition,

it was hoped that through

friends, or acquaintances. he would be able

to provide some

high-priority re-

During each of the series of debriefings he was

able to furnish some general information on Soviet political

factions and currents, on many sciertific and governmental

personalities, and on

missile and space-related events.

information was in general, however, either not of great value,

already known, or impossible to evaluate or corroborate. Never-

theless, the

case officer felt that the agent had "no way of

measuring the usefulness of any particular piece of informa-

tion" and that he was "going out of his way to provide us with

everything he thought might be of possible use."

BELITSKIY was not able to answer specific requirements

in the highest priority fields of missiles and atomic energy.

However, as he himself stressed, he did not have direct access

to classified documents,

and CIA had not expected that he

would be successful in

these areas.

On the other hand, he

did appear to have access to some military information of a

the KGB, neither the results of the polygraph examination, the

The conference occurred during the Cuban crisis, 21 to

During this

extremely critical period in Soviet-American

relations, BELITSKIY comnunicated the following points to his

CIA case officers:

- The members of the delegation had been briefed in

Moscow by the First Deputy Foreign Minister to be concilia-

tory, even to the degree of pointing out that the Soviet

Union disagrees with China on the distribution of nuclear

weapons to other powers, and to avoid any position which

could be regarded as offensive to the American partici-

pants.

- BELITSKIY "personally" regarded President KENNEDY's

announcement of a

"blockade" of Cuba as appalling.

stated that he was convinced that Cuba could have been

weaned from the Soviet Union by very careful handling

without alienating opinion in other countries, and that

the President's action tended to strengthen the position

of the "hard line.

Government.

Immediately following the President's an-

nourcement, the delegation was instructed to make the

Soviet position plain, but to do so in a moderate tone.

- The leader of the Soviet delegation had partici-

pated in a discussion with Norman COUSINS, of The

Saturday Review, who explained to him the reasons for

stationed in Vienna where he was working on

targets; this officer was aware of POPOV's association

with

the Austria, woman (see above), suspected POPCV,

and although re reported his suspicions,

nothing was done

about them.

All of this occurred while POPOV was

serving

in Austria (until September 1355).

Some time in 1957 or

1958, GOLITSY! continued, the KGs was told by a source that

POrOV was an agent.

The KGB then assigned this KGB officer

to Germany because

he. krew POPOV and was familiar with

the background.""

- General I.A, SEROV was Chairman of tie KGB when

the first information about POPOV's agent status was

received.

In summary, what GOLITSIll has said about the compromise indicates

that a KGB agert piovided the lead to PUPOV and thai this lead

was received in 1957 or 1958.

As stated above, POPOV's message of 18 September 1959 said

he had been arrested in the previous February: if this

portion of the message is correct, the orientation there-

fore irdicates that the KGB observed the first LAVGELLE-

POPOV brush contact, on 4 January 1959, and POPOV was

arrested some time after the second brush contact; on

21 January 1959.

** Although COLITSYN gave this officer's name as KOTOV,

GOLITSY"'s other facts about him make it clear that he

was referring to KGB Colonel M.V. ZHUKOV.

against Yugoslav targets, ZHUKOV was personally known to

Do you remember ZHUKOV of the KGB?... He may be assigned

here or (may be/ on IDY, but he has just come recently."

(A year later POPOV reported that ZHUKOV was still in

Berlin/Karlghorst working, he believed, in Anglo-American

operations.)

It would thus appear that the KGB sent

ZHUKOV to Berlin not long before 23 November 1957 and in

connection with the investigation of POPOV.

***SEROV was KGB Chairman until the latter part of 1958.

In January 1964 NOSENKO gave a detailed account of the compro-

miSe of GRU Colonel O.V. PENKOVSKI%, the CIÃ and British Inteili-

gence (MI-6) penetration agent whose arrest by the kos was

announced

2 lovember 1962.

In i subsequent debriefings and in-

terrogations NOSE::KO has offered

further information on certain

aspects of the PENKOVSKlY compromise, continuing

to maintain that

it was brought about by KGB surveillance in Moscow during 19627

Also according to NOSENKO, it was not until the latter stages of

the operation that the XGB realized American Intelligerce was

involved with MI-6 in this operation.

The reports by NOSENKO and other sources on the PENKCUSKIY

corpromise are presented below, but to place them in context,

they are preceeded by a brief summary of the PENKOVSKIY operation

from

the CIA and MI-6 standpoint.

(ii) Resume of the PENKOVSKIY Operation

In August 1960 PFNKOVSKIY gave two American tourists

a pack-

age of materials to deliver to the U.S. Embassy in Moscow.

These

materials included a description of a proposed dead drop site at

Number 2 Pushkin Street, which PENKOVSKJY had selected for a pos-

sible communication channel; in the letter PENKOVSKIY enclosed in

the package, he also gave his home teicphone number and instructions

for a call to be placed to him at Ã  certain time to indicate that

the package had been received and that the Americans were interested

in further contact with him. Efforts to maxe this teiephone con-

tact with PENKOVSKIY failed, as did several additional efforts on

Street address was checked from the outside on two occasions there-

after by Eugene MAHONEY, CIA officer at the Embassy in Moscow,

who walked past the building on 12 November and 4 December 1950.

On 21 January 19E1 MAHONEY went inside the building and checked

location of the dead drop site, behind the radiator

ABIDIAN, U.S. Embassy Security Officer and coopted CIA

also went inside the building to check for possible loading of the

dead drop by PENKOVSKIY.) In April 1961, PENKOVSKIY succeeded in

making contact in Moscow with the British businessaan, Greville

WYNNE, with whom he was already acquainted from previous trips to

Moscow by WYNNE. Through wYNNE, PENKOYSKIY passed to MI-6 docu-

ments and notice of his forthcoming trip to London in April.

promptly notified CIA, and the two services jointly conducted the

operation until it was terminated by the KGB on 2 November 1962.

Throughout this period PENKOVSKIY served in a GRU element

under cover of the State Committee for Science anÃ¢ Technology

(GKKNR) in Moscow, and it was under GKKNR cover that PENKOVSKIY.

travelled abroad three times, to England in April-May and July-

August 1961 and to France in September-October 1961. In addition.

to PENKOVSKIY's personal meetings with American and British case:

officers while on these IDY's, there were 27 exchanges of

materials in Moscow.

The CiA and MI-6 intermediaries used for

these exchanges were WYNNE, on his business trips to the USSR; Mrs.

Arne CHISHOLM, wife of an MI-6 officer stationed at the British

Embassy;* and Rodney CARISON Of CIA.

* The KGB penetration agent in MI-6, George BLAKE, had iden-

tified CHISHOLM as a fellow officer prior to the time this

couple was posted to Moscow.

He had also identified MAHONEY

to the KGB as Ã  CIA officer prior to MAHONEY's arrival in

MOSCOW.

(b) Reports on the Compromise

when asked in January lud whether he knew how PENKO!SKIY

was

and

compromised, NOSENKO answered

that he had "all the details"

then gave the following acco.nt:

Ever since the POPOV case

surveillance of personnel from

British Imbassies in Moscow.

As a result of this sur-

veillance, Mrs. CHISHUL! was seen ducking into an alcove.

evidentiy

following a Soviet citizen whom the surveillance

team was unable

to identify.

Surveillance coverage of

Mrs. CHISHOL' - and, indeed, on all British Embassy per-

sonnel - was immediately increased, and she was soon

observed following the same Soviet citizen on the street

in a clandestine manner.

The Soviet citizen was identi-

fled as PENKOVSKIY.

The KGB innediately launched a full investigation

of PENKOVSKIY, including a complete check of his back-

ground.

To avoid alerting him, knowledge of the investi-

gation was kept to a minimum, and surveillance of him was

restricted to stationary points in the neighborhood of

his residence and office.

As one part of the investiga-

tion, a man who closely resembled PENKOVSKIY and dressed

like him was made to walk in front of Mrs. CHISHOLM when

she was on a Moscow street; when she began to follow

this man, the KGB thus obtaired confirmation of its

identification of PENKOVSKIY.

Another part of the in-

vestigation entailed a search of the PENKOVSKIY apartment;

to Â¿ccomplish this, he was given a drug which made him

50 ill

that hospitalization was necessary, and Mrs.

PENKOVSKIY was lured from the apartment on a ruse; nothing

was fourd during this search,

The KGB next aimed a power-

ful telescope at the window in PENKOVSKIY's apartment and

obtained an apartment directly above his; from the over-

hanging balcony of the apartment occupied by the KGB some

flower pots were suspended, one of them able to take

pictures through the window of the apartment below; ir.

this manner the KuB photographed PENKOVSKIY removing

"suspicious materials" from the back part of his desk:

in the search of the apartment which followed, these

materials were found in the desk, but the KGB left them

there.

By the time WMillE visited Moscow ir. July 1962, both

he and PENKOVSKIY were under surveillarce, and their sus-

picious behavior in front of the feking Restaurant on

5 July gave the KGB another conclusive indicator of PENKOV-

activities.

Also, the KGB was able to monitor

conversations between PENKOVSKIY and NYANE in the latter's

hotel room, despite

the fact that PEKOVSKIY turned on

water faucets while they were talking.

PENKOVSKIY was arrested only when the KGB knew that

WYNNE was scheduled to go to a Satellite country.

SKIY gave a complete confession, and it was only at this

point that the KGE realized Americar. Intelligence was in-

volved in the operation.

After PENKOVSKIY revealed details

about the Pushkin

information with that contained ir

The KGB felt that it had obtained all pertinent in-

formation from PRiKOVSKIY and that he was "beyond redemp-

tion."

PENKOVSKIY was

executed.

In subsequent questioning soon after his defection, NOSENKO

repeatedly claimed that the KGB had no prior knowledge of erican

Intelligence participation in the PENKOVSKIY operation until

JACOB's arrest on 2 Novemoer 1962 at the Pustkin Street dead drop,

NOSENKO was asked in July 1964 for details on the KGB

official report (obzor) about the PENKOVSKIY case.

He said that

he had rever read the report because, although printed, it had

not been circulated as of the time of his departure for Geneva

in January 1964.

By O.M. GRIBANOV (Chief of

the KGB Second Chief

Directorate) and "various other case officers," however, NOSENKO

was told of certain of the items which would appear in the KGB

official report and most of which he had already reported.

fact that the KGB surveillance

tean had failed to identify

PENKOVSKIY at his first observed meeting with Mrs, CHISHOLM,

NOSENKO added at this time, would not be included in the report,

According to GRIBANOV, whereas the report would state the KGB

knew PENKOVSKIY was working for both the British and American

services, in reality the KGB did 'not know of the Americans'

involvement until PENKOVSKIY was arrested.

with regard to this

latter point, NOSENKO said that the KGB investigation of PENKOV-

SKIY was handled by officers from the British Department: rather

than the American Department of the XGB Second Chief Directorate,

except for V.M. KOVSHUK of the latter department, Furthermore,

NOSENIKO Stated,

the KGb interrogutors attempted to force Â¿ACOB

to admit he was a British citizen.*

In February 1965 NOSENKO provided his most complete account

of the PENKOVSKlY compromise and the KGS investigation which

ensued:

â¢The first that PE:XOVSKIY appeared in life of the

KGB was during ore of Myle's visits to moscow.

knew of PaNKOVSKIy's acquaintance with NYNiE and that he

was even visiting him in the hotel where WiNNE was staying.

The KGS checked with the GRU,

GRU answered that

PENKOVSKIY was working on WYNNE as a target,

was working in the GiziR as a cover, and MYNNE was one of

his acquaintances.

Later, there was massive surveillance

of the employees of the British Embassy - I don't know

exactly with whom - but PEKOVSKIY was noticed being in

contact with someone from the British Embassy. but sur-

veillance lost him...

Later he was nosiced with the wife

of British Embassy officer CHISHOLM.

At this point, the

KGB didn't tell the GRU anything, because the GRU had no

right to have any contact with any loreign embassy people

without telling the KCB - except at official receptions

and functions.

and even here they have to tell the KGB

so that surveillance will know.

And when surveillance

noticed PENKOVSKIY with Mrs. CHISHOLM, they immediately

recognized him as the guy they had lost.

"This was the beginning of the very active work on

put him under regular surveillance because he would

immediately find out - he was a capable officer - but

they put surveillance on him from time to time. However,

they set up a closed (fixed surveillance) post in a

building opposite his apartment, about 200 meters

They got a flat there, set up a post, and watched his

window with a telescope.

They also used the flat directly

above PENKOVSKIY's flat. Here they even put microphones

to hear his corversations with his wife and tapped the

telephone of course.

Then they noticed that he was hiding

something in his desk, taking the drawer out and putting

something behind,

And when he was taking off his shirt

he was putting notes

(inside).

They noticed him taking

pictures.

Above his flat there was a balcony with

flower boxes.

They put a camera in the flowers somehow

which could be lowered so that it could take pictures

through PENKOVSKIY's window by command (remote control)

from the closed post.

This was to get evidence, to

see the documents he was working with.

"There was another meeting with wYnnE.

But the KGB manaÃ§ed to intercept

the conversation - not everything,

but several words indi-

cating there was something incriminating.

called WYNNE

and they agreed to meet

at the Peking Restau

did not go with WhiNE into the restaurant as they had

agreed, but walked about the city with him.

tried to monitor their co-versation from a

distance of 200

meters with a special microphore like a long pipe. one meter

long, or maybe a little less.

"They decided to enter PENKOVSKIY's apartment and see

what was hidden in his desk.

In the GRU they controiled

what documents PENKOVSKIY was taring...

"They used a drug to put him in the tospital, a pre-

They took pictures of

everything.

They found many things, code pads ard so on,

which

showed that he was really working. Ater that they

decided to arrarge his arrest.

"PENKOVSKIY was supposed to go abroad, and the KGB

did everything to prevent it, but in such a ray that he

wouldn't understand.

They even cancelled a whole delega-

tion.*

This was while they were still trying to get proof.

"Then WYNNE came to lungary.

They arrested PENKOVSKIY

and I think one or two days later they took wynNe.

"The manner of arresting PENKOVSKIY was such that

even GRU wouldn't know about it, (D. M.) GVISHIANI (head

of the GKKNR) took part.

He told PENKOVSKIY to come with

him to the Central Cormittee, and when they were down in

his car he said: "Nait here a minute while I ger a docu-

ment I forgot."

There was an entrance on Gorky

Street,

but the car was in the courtyard behind.

The KGB was

waiting here.

PENKOVSKIY got in the car, and that was

it - he couldn't call out, no one saw it.

"Two days later I know that (General S.G,) BANNIKOV

(Deputy Chief of the KGB Second Chief Directorate)

to Hungary and took WYNNE.

I don't know the details of

HYNNE's arrest, but I know that BANNIKOV returned with

The Third Secretary went to RAYMOND's office, where he met

the unnamed individual in the presence of RAYMOND's Yugoslav

secretary. RAYMOND explained that

to him from his home village, but RAYMOND had not Icplied

until recently when he told the man to stop at his office,

as he had just done that day.

RAYMOND added that the person

suspicion.

On several occasions the UDB had jelt it had

almost enough evidence

to enable the Yugosla: Government to

expel CHERFPANOV, but the evidence was never completely

satisfactoss.

Thus in 1954 GREGOVIC was assigned the task.of com

promising CHEREPANOV's wife, Irene.

Approximately three

months after he met her, CREGOVIC

persorally.succeeded in

compromising Irene.

He continued to handle her as an in-

formant over a period of about a year and a half, during

which time he also maintained their personal relatlorship

on a spasnodir basis.

Irene's information enabled the UDB

to discover that CHEREPINOV had established a network of

and its vicirity.

Subsequent information established

fact that he was also in cluse contact with tride union

leaders and particularly with river

port workers,

of whom were subsequently found to be

anti-Yugoslav and pro-

soviet in their outlook.

Another Soviet,

intelligence

officer who had been recruited by the UDE, contired

to

GREGOVIC that CHEREPANOV was a nember of Soviet Irtelligence.

The Soviet said also that CHEREPANOV had been an intelligence

officer during the war and had at ont stage been parachuted

behind the German lines on a special services operation

which resulted in the kidrapping of a German general.

GREGOVIC described CHEREPANOV as "always smiling but

In fact an extremely cold and cruel individual."

Although

he did not appear to be enotionally attsched to his wife,

he was extrenely jealous and watchful of her.

He frequently

urged his wife to use her exceptional beauty and seductive

charn in cultivating Yugoslav officials in order to obtain

information.

GRECOTIC also said that CHEREPANOY LaS VEry

A special plane was immediately sent to Baku, carrying

S.M: FEDOSEYEV and several other American Department officers.

They picked hin up and beaded immediately back to Muscow,

interrogating CHEREPANOV on the plane.

He innediately con-

fessed to havirg given the documerts to the Americans.

When asked why,

he said he was "angry at the KCB, very

angry, "

and besides, he thought he might ask the Americans

for

some noney. In return for

the documents.

â¢ He confessed

that on 4 Novenber he had passed the documents to an Ameri-

can tourist wio was a librarian Irterested in Russian books.

He said he had given the documents to this American in the

entrance hallway in the building of the Ministry of Foreign

Affairs, the building in which the sinistry of Foreigo

Trade was also housed.

Because of the fact that CHEREPANOV had eluded the KGB

between the two fixed

surveillance posts which had been

established, the Second Chief Directorate suffered

consider-

able criticisn for not putting CHEREPANOV under full, round-

the-clock surveillance.

CHERFPANOV himself, however, told

the KGB that had he detected surveillance on himself

he

would have written to the government and nerspapers a letter

of protest against "such an indignity, such persecution,"

and then would have committed suicide, leaving the KGB

without proof.

CHEREPANOY was in prison when NOSENKO left the USSR

(on 18 January 1964) and would be shot, but the affair would

not be publicized.

In addition to his wife, CHEREPAYOV

would leave a daughter as a survivor.

*One paragraph

of the docunent refers to American surveil-

lance of Soviets in New York City, and the next paragraph

begins:

"The intensity

of surveiliance was unever.

From

November. 1957 to April 1958 a decrease was noticed in the num-

ber of surveillance teams assigned to work directly against

Soviet employces.

This did not mean, however, trat the Ameri

can surveillance

service reduced its surveillance of Soviet

employees as a whole."

The dates cited here approximate the

period,. from

late November 1957 to mid-larch 1958,

when the

FBI was conducting surveillance of two Illegals in New York

City as an outgrowth of an operational lead from CIA source

POPOV (see Part VI.D.7.a.).

Information from JOSEYKO rela-

ting to FBI surveillance is discussed in Part VI.F.

**FEKLISOV is the true name of the former KGB Legal Resident

who served in Washington, D.C., under the alias

"FOSIN."

***NOSENKO identifled V.A. KUSKOV as an officer ia the Second

Section,

American

Department, KCB Second Chief Directorate,

and

said that CHEREPANOV worked in the same root with KlSkov.

HiS

meetings with POPOY in Moscow are set out accurately,

with dates.

WISTERS' mailing of a letter to pOPOr is

mentioned,

but in contrast to exact dates used throigh-

out the

MINTEDa, PAper for other events cited, the date of

mailing is given only as "January 1959."

There is a handwritten document comprised of sanes

and addresses

of soviet citizens, headed

with a state-

ment that

these are auttors of letters addressed to the

U.S. Embassy

in Moscow,

but intercepted by the KEB.

Where dates of the letters are given, they are for Octo

ber 1960.

In a few cases the contents of the letters

are characterized (e.5.,

"request for finarcial aid--

5,000 rubles," "complaints about inability to live os

persion").

Under two of the names a note appears,

which looks as though it had been added at a different

time or with & different pen, but in identical hand-

writing;

the note says

"letter enclosed."

Thase tro

letters

were unclosed in the package of docurerts.

The two documents described above--the LANCEILE

"Conclusions' and the list of Soviets who wore to the

U.S. Embassy--appear to have been writen by

the saue

persis.

Although the sample on the docurort described

nexi is only a signature, it may well be the same hand.

The name is CHEREPANOV's.

This docurent, the only docu

ment naving for its subject a Sovict citizir, 1s a type-

written summary of derogatory inforration on a Soviet

youth who began to lead ? dissolute life in 1957,

beconing a black market speculator and a homosexual.

As a consequence he was expelled

from the Komsondl and

from the Institute at which he had been studyi=g.

He

nonetheless continued his criminal activities,

iscludirg

contacts with

foreigners for purposes of fleeirg the

USSR, despite warnings by the militia and the kil, and

he had two long meetings with Attache Richard SNYDER,

"Consul of the American Embassy," to discuss his wish

to

go to America.

The document, dated February 1960,

is

signed by Lt. Col. A. CHEREPANOV, "Senior Case Ofricar

[no section

indicatedl, First Department," of the Second

Chief Directorate.

(Presumably the document is relevant

to the American Department because of the costact with

an American diplomat.)

*On 24 May 1958 LANGELLE visited the area of the dead drop

site referred to herein with his wife to case and photograph

the site arca.

The site had been described to him as

erase to ta de orach

certain section of a wooden staircase in the park area.

When his report was received at CIA Headquarters it was

obvious that because of inadequate information, he had

cased the wrong staircase, so he was told to go back as

soon as possible and repcat the casing for the other stair-

case.

He did this on 28 May 1958,

bringing his children

for

cover.

He did not put a drop down at this of any other

time.

legal travel agent actually put the drop down on

7 June

1958.

This drop

was

not intended for the agent re-

ferred to in the CHEREPANOY document, REPNIKOY, wro in fact

was not even a recruited agent at the time, although efforts

were being made--unsuccessfully-during this time to recruit

him.

At no time was any dead drop put down for REPNIKOY,

nor were any ever planned for him.

are handarittes draits of

reports portainine to various of the incricans named

above,

some incomplete, and extensive rough notes which

apprar to be extracts from surveillance reports, nost

of them on WINTErS.

All these notes are i: the same

NOSENKO'S Comments on the CHEREPANOV Papers

On 3 February 1964 NOSENKO was

shown all the CHEREPAYOV

papers with the excepiion of the FEKLISOV ropcit on opera-

tional conditions in

the United States.

Just b-fore they

were

given to him to read,

shown

NOSENKO was asked if he had been

the pepers before he left doscow; he replied that be

had not.

He said he knew that the documents pertained to

BOWDEN, RASSEY, HARUSTONE, WISTERS, aNd LANCEL.E,

but he

had not read thrm.

MSKEd

who in thin Second Chir: Directorate

kner exactly which docunents were involvid, NOSENKO named

S.M. FEDOSEYEV, Chief of the

Ameriran Dopart-eat it the tine;

GRIBANOY,

Chief of

the second Chief Directorats; and G.I.

GRYAZNOV,

Chief 'of

the U.S. Embass! Section.

These three

officers,

he said,

had

possession of the docunrits after

they were returned by diD to the kCB.

NOSENKO then proceeded to examine and read aloud the

contents of the documents, making ccasional rxpiaratory

comments as he went alung.

lie identified the randwriting

of CHEREPANOV himself, as well as that of KISKO;, KOVSHLK, and

BELOGLAZOV.

Concerning the

substance of the documents, YO-

SENKO made

very

few comments.

in discussing tre opcrational

plan for work against WINTERS, NOSENKO noted that this docu-

eat,

which was a hardwritten draft, had been sigied by

KOVSHIK, Chief of the U.S. Embassy

Sectior; NOSENKO then said:

"He should not have signed this.

I do not know why he signed

it.

He should not have signed it." Asked why not, he said:

"Because it is

a drait.

He should have sigrd the typed

copy.

Ard why he signed the rough draft I do not krou..."

As he studied the agent report which KO Sulk reesired

from source "IILIANA," concerning WINTERS, JOSENKO cormented

on KOVSHUK's failure to fill in the line

which is intended

to identify the safe apartnent or operational apartment

there the report was irceived.

"It is obligatory

to india

cate the place, in the second line," he added.

"It is

obligatory to write in the number of the persoral iile (this

did appear in the document) and where the cortact took place."

Reading aloud the agent plan for BoWDEN, described

therein as the FBl man in the Embassy, NOSENKO came to the

section which states:

"Ironically one day as though by

chance he (BOWDEN! blurted out to our agent SIdELOVA'

'ARTUR'S* affiliation with American Intelligence." He wes

interrupted to be asked who "SHEDOVA" was; NOSESTO said:

"Cleaning woman undoubtedly. An affiliation of 'ARTUR' with

American Intelligence.

He was then asked:

"What connec-

tion did 'ARTUR' have with American Intelligence?"

To this

*"ARTUR" was the KGB cryptonym for NOSENKO's agent Arsene

FRIPPEL; see Part V.D. 5.

NOSENIO replied:

"That I cannot say." The CIA case officer

renarked:

"Ahy, you

should know, sou're his case of!icer..."

NOSENKO ignored this comment and continued to read the docu-

ment aloud.

A little further on in the document reference

is made to use of future agents to report on BOADEN; again

"ARTIH" is montoned, and NOSENKO identified nim this time

as FRIPPEL.

Then he

said:

"I asked FRIPPEL, and he said

'But I know nothirg."

'How is it you do not, when he is

the counterintelligence nan

In your Embassy?

He interrogates

you!"

And he answered:

'But no, he is a good man.""

In reading a draft report which appears to nave been

an attompt to summarize the KGB information

on WINTERS, NO-

SENKO read out the sentence:

"During his

stay in the USSR,

WINTERS sent eight espionage letters,* and loaded a drop

In connection with & gane the KGB played with American Intel-

l1gence."

He was asked if he knew about those eight letters,

but he said he did not.

The CIA case ofiicers made some remarks

critical of WINTERS' skill as an intelligence officer, 1n

vier of the fact that the KGB picked up these eight letters.

"But at that time I would not have run him

He did not know that he had letka on him.**

the jear 1902 did you know about Hrtke?

No, I don't believe

you did."

he was asked:

you mean those eight

letters were detected from Metka? NOSENKO said:

"Of course."

The case officer asked:

"Not Tron surveillance?" NOSESKO

Beyond the fact that he could be

seen mailing

then, the rest Metka gives....Well, that letter which was

mailed by WINTERS tO FOPOV was without Metka.

for POPUV definitely was without botke. But the other

letters, that was not so.

I would not blame him.

How would

He put them in his pocket--that's all." NOSENKO

added that the letter which was sent to POPOV was one of the

eigat letters to which the document refers.

NOSENKO then reviewed the document concerning Richard

He repeated his earlier statement that KAR!-

STONE had been compromised and had been approached by the KGB,

that be turned down the recruitment offer, but that he did

not report the approach to the u.s. embassy.

how the KGB knew that he had not reported the approsch, to

which NOSENKO replied:

"He was monitored and we would have

if anything about this matter had been re-

ported.:. Undoubtedly if he reported it

something would have

been heard fron the Minister Counsellor's materials as to

what this might be.

Ard they would dictate a message about

this. "**** Later NOSENKO was asked who tried to recruit HAR!STONE.

*According to CIA records, in addition to the one letter to

POPOV referred to here, WINTERS mailed only six other S/W

letters to agents in the USSR.

**The first source of information on KGB use of Metka, the

KGB code rame for thief powder or detecting powder,

was

NOSENKO, in June 1962.

***See Section VI.D.3.e. for a discussion of the HARISTONE case.

****HARMSTONE did report the KGB approach, and the Minister

Counsellor's office was the site of a discussion of the case.

He answered:

"I do not know; thai was prior to my coming

Into the departuent.. This was in the year 1953 or 1959.

I don't know who was the case officer who spoke to Raid-

STONE. "

POSENKO waS

asked:

"Is he still in the Lepartment?"

He replied:

"I don't think he is. I don't think he is

concerred with it any more."*

NOSENKO read the document which set forth highlights

Of LANGELLE's operational activities

in Moscow, chiefly

devoted to the POPOV. case, but also including information

(inaccurate in

detail) concerning a dead drop site in Lenin

Hills.**

As be read this section he commented:

"Incidentally,

they |the KGBi found the dead drop and contents by accident.

Little children, children."

Asked if he krew arything about

this incidont of lenin Hills, he arswered,

"Kids.

Russian

childion found it uy accidert.

For after LANGELLE had left

the arra, surveillance checked over the area, but they found

nothing....

Reading further he come to the statement that

it was later establisied that the dead drop was interded

for the person already arrested by the KGB,

REPYJKOV.

TO

this he added that REPNIKOV was known as Stanisia: "Slava"

REPNIKOV, who had been recruited by some tourist; these de-

tails were

not included in the CHERZPANOV documert.

He was

asked if REPNIKOV had been arrested and was chereafter

working under KGB control, but he said this was not the case.

He explained that he had been arrested, and thr YÃB there-

after

"roughed him up once in a while"

because he was of the

category of Soviets who were known to associate with foreigners.

He did not know what American tourist had recruited REPNIKOV,

but he was aware of the fact that REPNIKOY had not beer

arrested until after the tourist had left the l'SSR.***

When he was reviewing the sumar; of information on

LITTEL, who had left the USSR before the sunmary was pre-

pared, NOSENKO was asked if he knew anything about one of

the soviets naned as a one-time contact of LItrEl's, B.P.

VORONTSOl. The document, a rough draft with corrections,

contained a statement that a mocting between Llf'EL and

*KOVSHUK was identified by HARUSTONE as the KGB officer who

made the approach.

**See the foregoing section on the contents of the CHERE-

PANOV package for details on the inaccuracies included in

this document.

***REPNIKOV had been reported as a dissident Soviet youth

as early as 1955,

and in 1957 he told one of his Anerican

contacts that he

had once been arrested and seived time in

a Soviet prison at some time for one of his attempts to

escape illegally

from the USSk.

He was arrested sgain there-

after for a second plan for escape, and he was given psycho-

logical treatment as a result.

REDNIKOV waS

in contact with

a number of Americans

and other Western travellers again in

1958

and 1959.

In September 1959 another Soviet, a friend

of his,

told

an American tourist that REPNIKOY had been

arrested

after receiving a letter from an American which

thanked hin for his interest in being an agent and gave him

directions for future contacts.

In the sumer of 1960 there..

was a long article in Komsomolskaya Pravda

about the arrest

of REPNIKOV and a friend of his on charges of being agents of

Cla. Neither was.

VORONTSOY took place on the strect, and they went to a

restaurant together.

It further said that VORONTSOV was

continuously in contact with foreign tourists.

These two

lines are

crossed out in the draft, and in

their place 18

written:

"The Second [Counterintelligence and Security!

Department of the UkGB for the city of loscow is fully

oriented concerning him." NOSENKO HaS told that YORONTSOV

nost recently worked for Inturist at the lotel Hetropol in

Moscow, and that he had had a number of meetings with

American students and with tourists.

NOSENKO commeated:

"This is

agent work.

He is an agent." He was asked, "But

to you nothing is known?"

NOSENKO sald, "Absolutely nothing."*

NOSENKO went over the rest of

the CHEREPAYOV documentg

rapidly, for the nost part simply reading them aloud, with

side remarks on topics unrelated to the dooomenis or the

Americans discussed therein.

*In the sunner of 1963,

VORONTSOV had contacted two different

groups of joung Americans

and told

them

of his

plans for es-

cape fron

the

Soviet Union.

He also told then

he had inforna-

tion about KGB agents through his Inturist employsest, and

that the American authorities should be told of hin and his

plans; he passed on an elaborate code system which was to be

used to get in touch with him to assist hin in his

escape

plans. He was so open in his contacts, unrealistic in his

plans, and insecure in his conversations with the young Aneri-

cans (none of whom had any intelligence connections) that

when they reported to American embassies in the fest, VORONT-.

SOV was immediately assumed by U.S. authorities to be either

a clumsy provocateur or a

fanciful; immature youth.: Nothing

further was heard from VORONTSOV.

There had been no previous

record of him in CIA files; the CHEREPANOV document was the

only confirmation of his other contacts with foreigners.

Section] never saw these documents."

NOSENKO has not changed his

original statement that the KGB has never been able to break

the miiitary codes.

NOSENKO has stressed that he has no aptitude for technical

matters and had no interest in or access to information on

spe-

cific techniques used by KGB cryptologists to break the imerican

codes.

He suggested in general terms, however,

that KGB suc-

cesses in this field were made possible in part by information

obtained from American cryptographic personnel who defected and

were recruited

in the late 1940's and the 1950's, in part by

information from the microphone installations in

the

two mili-

tary code rooms

and certain U.S. Embassy offices.

NOSENKO has

not specified how this information was used or which of these two

cÃ¢tegories of sources was of

greater value,

although he did re-

port that the loss

of KGB ability to read the State Departuent

codes coincided with and was largely a result of the installation

of an acoustically secure enclosure for cryptographic operations.

(The date was late 1961 or early 1962, according to NOSENKO, but

actually late 1962, according to U.S.

authorities.) At the

same time, NOSENKO

indicated, the microphone in the military code

rOOm

(which was probably effective until late 1960, according

to NSA) was of little use.

There is a degree of correlation between NOSENKO's informa-

tion on KGB cryptologic successes and that earlier, reported by

that the hoB Lignth Directorate had broken

elements

there.

At the end of is61 or the beginning of 1962,

however, the

in 1964.

le nas furnished

some details on

the types of Embassy

enciphered traffic veing read in clear text and on the way in

which the clear text ras treated within the KGB Second Chief

Directorate; in addition, NOSENKO has indicated that the KGB used

microphones

in the Enbassy and exploited humail sources to further

its cryptologic word.

These points are reviewed separately below.

(i)

Breaking U.S. Ciphars

The first reference by NOSENKO to KGB cryptologic successes

against U.S. Government enciphered traffic vas

made

ond

at his sec-

meeting with ClA en

11 June 1962.

At that tine he raised the

subject in connection with his personal security new that he was

in contact with CIA. He said:

"If possible, hanule things in

cables which went from the Embassy. We had them all, down to

the last one. I saw them every day..."

During the third mecting, on 12 June 1962, NOSEYXO revised

his statements sade the day before.

He now said that only cer-

tain of the state Department codes had been broken, and that he

had only rarely seen the clear text of deciphered cables. NOSENKO

repeated that nilitary cipher systems had not been

broken.

His

statements were as follow's:

"Ile are reading) not

All things which are sent in

the military

shas ut are not able. reat we can read some of what your diplo-

mats send.

Not we (the KGB Second Chief Directoratel but the

[KGB] Eighth Directorate.

They are reading some things."

Asked whether the KGB was reading all the State Department's

enciphered traffic or only a small part of it, NOSENKO replied:

"Not all.

We are not reading all the State Department (traffic)."

He also said, contrary to his statement of 11 July 1902 that he

saw the deciphered traffic "every day," these documents reached

"very seidon"--at the nost "ten or twelve times" during 1900

and 196i.

Following

his defection,

NOSENKO reported that he had learned

in discussiors

end of 1961 or the beginning of

(Earlier,

on 24 January

1964, NOSENXO said that he knew "definitely" that

the KGB Eighth

â¢ Directorate was then having no success in breaking enciphered

traffic of the U.S. Embassy in Moscow.) At about the same time

that State Department traffic could no longer be read, NOSENKO

reported, various U.S. Embassy officers were less often heard

ment from the U.S. Embassy Section, American Department, about

in their offices.

This ders topment had led CRYAZOV and S.H.

FEDOSEYEV (Chief of the American Departent) to conclude that a

"roon-within-a-room" had been installed in thie tabassy and that

other security reasures, had been instituted there..

After his

transfer from the American Departuent in carly 1962, NOSENKO con-

tinued, he also had occasion to discuss the KGB ioss of code-

breaking capability with GRIbANON, Chief of the Second Chief Direc-

from him NOSENKO learned

that the Contral Committee of the

Communist Party was

exerting considerable pressure on the Chairman

of the KGB for cortinuation of the material formerly obtained

in

this manner; consequently, the KCB Chairman as demanding maximum

effort fron all officers

in the recruitment of code clerks.

In the second series of hostile siterrogations. on 20 February

1965,

NOSLiKO made the following statcuent concerning KoB crypto

logic success during 1960-1961:

"Occasionally the Eigoth Directo-

rate would break messages, but very, vory seldon. aid we never saw

the documerts."

(11) Handling of Deciphered Cablis

In mid- 1964 NOSESKO was debricied

the American Departmeal, during nis reportrd tonuli there in 1960-

1961, in handling ine clar isxt of

decipheard cavies of the U.S.

Embassy.

The report of SOSENSO's siaterents on this subject is as

follons:

"The Russian text of those Siate lapartment coded mes-

sages which had been broken was sent to StulcHASINty, the Chairman

of the KGB, alio sometimes forwarded it to Oirg Mikhaylovich GRI-

BANOV, Chief of the second Chiel Directorate.

ChIBANOV at times

forwarded some of the materiai

to vladinar Alekseyevich KLYPIN,

Chief of the American Department, or KiYPIN's successor, S.u.

NOSENKO saw such material on the desk of KLYPIN and

later on FEDOSEYEV's desk, bur was never permitied lo read it.

NOSENKO knew, however, that the reader liad to sign for those

articles that he read.

would open

the book to certain pages which had red paper and

permit KLYPIN OF FEDOSEYEV tO SEE the material.

This was Eighth

Directorate notcrial, but NOSEiKO did not know where or how

LEMSKOV got it...

At times portions of this material were read

aloud to NOSENKO by KLiPly, but they concerned the position of

the American

Ambassador or

the C.S. Covernment on political ques..

tions and

were of no significarce to nim.

I-frequently there was

mention of the expected arrival of Americans who were not per-

manently assigned to the Embassy, and NOSENKO renembered that

one such iten concerned the arrival of one or two men, a 'commis-

sion,! to check the work of the Political Section.

Ine attitude

of the Secretary of State or the American Ambassador was some-

times expressed on certain unremembered topics, but NOSENKO took

no interest in the information as it did not relate to agents or

NOSENKO noteÃ¹, however, that the material con-

cerned messages from the American Ambassador,

Moscow,

to the

Secretary of

State and from the Secretary of

State to the Ancri-

can Ambassador, Moscon.

All of this material was highly sensitive,

and few people

were permitted to see it or ever. to know of its

existence.

NOSENKO stazed that it was treaced aore carefully

certain Embassy officials (notably Ministers Counsellor FREERS

When the texts were picked up

on the KGB micropnones,* the

Directorate compared hom against enciphered traffic

by other means.

The two other

intercepted

methods indicated, analysis

equipment sounds and exploitation of human sources, are dis-

in greater detail belon.

NOSENKO has twice referred to the Eighth Directorate's

interest in equipment sounds and snatches of technical conversa-

tions picked up by the microphones

in the State Department and

military code rooms.

He said on 21 January 1964:

"Now, we also

listened to the code room and the teletype office, but we could

never get anything out of the teletype office because of inter-

ference (equipnent noises which drowned out conversationsl..e

then he would men-

This was, of course,

all recorded and

we turned it over di chie io the Fighth Dircctorate, dealing

with coding ind decoding.

Of course, all other intercepts were

turned

over to them also." NOSENKO reported on 14 May 1964:

"In 1960 and 1961

from

the State Department code room (we heard)

always the sounds of machines only.

.

* See Part V.E.3.g. concerning the KGB microphones in the U.S.

Embassy.

Until December 1962 when an acoustical room was installed

within the State Department to enclose cryptographic equip-

ment, teletype and code machines were vulnerable to the one

microphone

later discovered in this area.

Since that time

presumably

only the teletype equipment

could be heard.

NOSENKO is speaking of the earlier period.

On 20 February.

1965 he said,

however:

"The microphone is not in the State

Department code room,

but next door where the teletype

nachines were located."

This information was true only after

the secure room was installed.

tary communications, repaired cryptographic equipment, per-

formed stand-by cryptographic duties when STORSBERG was un-

available,

NOSENKO Has more specific with regard to another source of

analytic infornation.

Questioned on 24 January 1964 concerning

recruitment and use of code clerks by the American Departent,

NOSENKO enumerated the recruitments known

to him and then said:

"As I recall, way back in 1948 or 1949,

who defected.

He stayed behind.

I believe his name was MeMILLAN.*

The debriefing continued:

Question: But did not 'ANDREY' bring out military code material?

NOSENKO:

No, I believe it was only State Department material.

What he mainly did was to describe the operation of

code machines and what daily or other periodic settings

were made.***

NOSENKO's statements about the KGB microphones in the Aneri-

(li) USIB Security Committee Report

"The security practices and procedures. lat the American

Embassy appear

io have followed a pattern

from

April 1953 to

May 1960, at which time the first plastic (acoustical, room

was installed.

A change occurred in the work habits lin May

1960) in that the more

senior State Department officers utilized

the plastic room for sensitive discussions and dictation.

The

room could acconmodate only a limited portion of the Embassy

classified discussions and,

accordingly, a

number of classified

discussions were held outside of this secure

arca.

In the April

1953-May 1960 period it was an accepted practice

of the Ambassa-

dor and the Deputy Chief of Mission

to discuss openly in their

offices routine classified operations of the Embassy and to dic-

tate classified documents and telegrams.

Extrenely sensitive

matters such as high-level political decisions, matters perti-

tent to the most sensitive U.S. -Soviet relationships

intelligence operations were not dictated and it discussefositive

were mentioned in a cryptic manner...

"In the External Political Section during the 1953-1960

period there were daily staff meetings...

Work assignments

were given at these meetings to individual officers who, in turn,

prepared classified dispatches or telegrams to the (Statel De-

partment.. It was reported that the officers of the External

Political Section frequently dictated classified material, includ-

ing telegrans,

within their offices.

Officers of the Internal

Political

Section generated few classified telegrams..â¢

were, however, typed in the offices.

From May 1960 to date (1964)

the Ambassador-DCM operation conducted their most sensitive clas-

sified discussions and actions in the acoustic room; however

routine classified day-to-day operations were discussed and dic-

tated in the offices.

Ambassador KOHLER reported that since

August 1962 he and members of his staff working on substantive

or sensitive matters utilized the secure room and that all ma-

terial to be encrypted was drafted in long-hand or dictated in

the acoustic room.

"The pattern for the External Political Section and the

Internal Political Section remained basically the

same during

the period of May I960 to the present time; however, the most

sensitive matters were discussed or dictated in the

room. or drafted in longhand...

In September 1962 the second

acoustic room was erected

the typing section for the handl-

ing of sensitive classified material.

From December 1963 to

date it was indicated that no classified telegrams have been

dictated outside of the acoustic rooms. It was

stated, however,

that the day-to-day operations including analysis of develop-

ments within the Soviet Union were openly discussed in various

offices and the conclusions reached later became the basis of

classified documents or telegrams...

"The military attaches reported that most cables were

in longhand or typed by the originator and then turned

over to the code clerks for transmission.

In certain instances

cables were dictated in the offices..."

Introduction

NOSENKO, as previously indicated, came to Geneva with the

Soviet Delegation to the Disarmament

Conference in mid-March

1962 and established contact with CIA in June of that year.

His arrival in: Geneva and his first meeting with CIA thus

occurred three. months and six months, respectively,

Anatoliy Mikhailovich GOLITSYN defected to CIA from the KGB

Legal Residency in lielsinki, on 15 December 1961,*

and was ex-

filtrated to the United States.

A discussion of what GOLITSYN said about NOSENKO appears in

Part V.I.7.

Presented below are, first, a summary on GOLITSYN,

then

survey comparing GOLITSYN's and NOSENKO's leads, and finally,

a protocol on GOLITSYN which NOSENKC signed.

2.

Background Information on GOLITSYN

GOLITSYN, a KGB counterintelligence. officer, was assigned

the Soviet

Embassy in Helsinki in Julw 1960 under the alias

of Anatoliy KLIMOV.

In defecting to CIa, he provided nore than

20 documents taken from the lielsinki KGB Legal Residency files

as well as extensive information about KCB officers

tions acquired during his 16-year carear in the KGB.

GOLITSYN had had a variety of job and training assignments

in the First Chief Directorate in Moscow and training assignments

in the Second Chief Directorate.+*

The bulk of his career was

spent in work against the American target for the First Chief

Directorate; this vas his responsibility in llelsinki and had

also been his principal area of responsibility during his pre-

vious tour abroad, in Vienna from 1953 to 1955.

(In the lat-

ter assignment he had been known to Petr DERYABIN, who defected

to CIA in 1954, and this was

the reason for GOLITSYN being

assigned to Helsinki under alias.)

Among the GOLITSYN documents was a study of American In-

telligence operations exploiting tourists visiting the USSR,

the so-called "legal travel program.****

This study, which

rung to sixteen pages in translation, was prepared in KGB

Headguarters and was

sent to the Helsinki

Legal Residency under

a cover letter, dated 7 April 1961, which suggested a number

:of steps to be

taken in order to counter such operations.

The study was based on two principal sources:

* According to NOSENKO, GOLIISYN defected on or about 15 Janu- i.

ary 1962, after NOSENKO had been reassigned to the Tourist

Department.

** As a result of this service, GOLITSYN was the original

source of numerous leads to

identifiable penetrations

of hestern Governments, including agents with access

to classified information such as William VASSALL (see

Part VI.D.5.b.) and the French officer in NATO, George

PACQUES.

a.: Microphones in the U.S. Enbassy

In his visits to the Americar. Departmert GOLITSYN learned

by accident of KGB technical operations against the U.S. Embassy

* NOSENKO denied that GOLITSYN visited the American Department

at any time in 1960.

**Although knowing that GOLITSYN went to the American Depart-

ment in 1961, NOSENKO said that the month was not January

out July, for it was in July that he 'NOSENKO) was on leave:

SOLITSYN's passport, however, verifies he was in the Soviet

Union in January 1961 and shows no entries for July of that

When

asked in april 196? about the product frÃ²n such

operations, GOLIISIN said he had heard about

results raay tires,

but the only concrete example he was in a position to giva was

the following:

During one of his visits to the Amarican Depart-

ment in 1960* he heard and

saw that a report or reports of the

results of audiosurveillance in the U.S. anbassy lad been lost.

lihile he was present, the Department Chief ordered all the per-

sonnel to search once more for these papers, and as GOLITSyN

stood there they went through ail their files.

GOLITSYN said

he could see that there were many

such reports, each having a red

line on it, which signified that these reyorts were the property

of that department of the KGB Operational Technical Directorate

(OTU)

which was Icsponsible for making

the installations.

He

the American Department had to re-

turr. the reports to that directorate, and this was the reason for

being made.

The only cffice

in the U.S. Enbassy which

was specifically menticned in connection with this search was

that of the Minister Counselor.**

ment in December 1960 (his passport and CIA travel records

show this was

have been referring to this inter visit.

in the offices of the Minister Counsellor at the U.S. Emb-

assy, and he said at that time that he had seen intercept

reports of conversations or dictations by successive mini-

In 1965 NOSENKO volunteered a story about

the loss of one of the intercept repcrts which the imerican

Department had received in 1950 or 1961; he identified it

as one which recorded the Minister Counsello: giving dicta-

tion.

According to NOSENKO, the Anerican Department was

turned upside down for a month, December, in the search

for the missing report.

Although the document was never

found, neither the Chief of the American Department nor

O.M. GRIBANOV, Chief of the Second Chief Directorate, was

subjected to any punishment because the draft fron which

the missing report had been typed was found to be in the

possession of the Second Department of OTU.

From this the

investigators concluded that the document itself had pro-

bably been returned to the OTU and burned,

and that in-

advertently no paper had been executed to record its des-

truction.

Leads to Oferations Against U.S. Embassy Not Covered by

ROSEMKO

GOLITSYN Iported on six operations against personnel of

the v.s. Embassy

in Moscow which have

not appeared in the re-

porting by NOSENKO.**

These operations are summarized below.

GOLITSYN heard in about 1957 of the recruitment of a fenale

employee--"like a secretary"--of the U.S. Embassy.

American girl, she had travelled to Georgia in 1957. There the

KGB placed in her path a KGB agent, a Georgian male.

They be-

gan living together, and this relationship continued ir. Moscow

where she was recruited.

GOLITSYN's lead to the American recruited with PREISPREUND's

help is eguated to STORSBERG on the basis of NOSE: KO's and

PREISFREUND's statements that FREISFREUND participated in no

other operation.

GOLITSYN reported that the target of this

operation was Iccruited: NOSENKO reported that STORSBERG. Ie-

jected the KGB approach.

** By virtue of his position as Deputy Chief of the t.s. Emb-

assy Section in 1960

and 1961, NOSENKU said, he was directly

responsible for knowing of all KGB operations agains: person-

nel at the Embassy ir. that period and definitely would have

known of any successes since his earlier tour;

he knew that

"ANDREY" was the last successiul one (1953-54).

This subject came up in a discussion of GOLITSYN's forth-

coming assigment to Helsinki, and SOLITSYN was told that if the

agent was transferred to Helsinki, GRYAZNOV might let GOLITSYN

have him as his agent.

GRYAZ::OV gave GOLITSYN r.0 details about

the operation other than the fact that the agent had provided the

KGB with some information and the KGB considered him "a real agent."

Also in the spring of 1960, GOLITSYN learned from GRYAZIOU

that he, GRYAZNOV, had developed an operation against a military

code clerk at the

U.S. Embassy to the point that the KGB was "99

per cent sure" that the target would be recruited.

and STORSBERG, this does not appear to

NOSENKO has mentioned no other operation against a military

code clerk.

I.Y. KURILENKO told GOLITSYN that while serving in the u.s.

Embassy Section he had followed an American diplomat returning

to

the United States in 1959, and there he had completed the recruit-

ment which had begun while the diplomat was assigned to the u.s.

Embassy in MosCOW.*

According to KURILENKO, he had travelled to

the United States under cover of the Soviet Exhibit Committee.

ments at this time; SHILEPIN said that this method of approach was

"too dirty" and the KGB should find another way.

not exclude the future use of the photographs, which the KGB would

hold in reserve.

Arother case mentioned

by GRYAZNOV to GOLITSYN was that of

the attempted recruitment of an American female secretary on the

basis of her relationship with a KGB agent, either a lover or a

close friend.

The agent, with the help of a KGB officer, tried

to influence her, but failed.

She left the USSR prior to July

1960, but the KGB pianned to work on her again, as she was to

return to Moscon.

On a TDY trip to Helsinki in November 1960, V.V. KOSOLAPOV

of the U.S. Embassy Section told GOLITSYN that he had come there

in order to ride basi. to Moscow on the train with a U.S. Embassy

code clerk with whom he planned to strike up an acguaintance to

be continued in Moscow.**

In about September 1961 a friend of ':

KOSOLAPOV's came to Helsinki on TDY, and GOLITSYN tried to get

his to talk about KOSOLAPOV's train operation, but he would not

From this GOLITSYN was certain that the re-

cruitment had been successful.

GOLITSYN learned from V.M. KOVSHUK, apparently in January 1961,

that the Finnish agent. Johan PREISFREUND had recently been used in

the successful recruitment of an American at the U.S. Embassy.

NOSENKO has described no

successful operations in which PREISFREUND

took part (see preceding section) .

NOSENKO said that there was no operational reason for KURILENKO's

travel to the United States at the

time of the Soviet Exhibition

in New York City, and that KURILENKO's duties related only to

security; the KGB Resident in New York City, NOSENKO added, could

have given KURILENKO some special task if he wished.

Surveillance of Soviets in the United States

Information from NOSENKO

At the second meeting with CIA in Geneva in 1962, NOSENKO

related that V.A. KOZLOV,

Chief of the American Department

of the KGB seventh (Surveillance) Directorate, had gone to

the United States the year before to investigate the suspected

cessation of survelllance of Soviets stationed in New York City

The KGB Legal Resident in New York City,

B.S. IVANOV; had reported the situation. to the KGB First Chief

in turn,' had scught the Second Chief Direc-

torate's opinion as to thy no surveillance has being noted.

Unable to suggest a reason, the Second, Chief Directorate asked

whether the surveillance of Soviets could have been called off

The First Chief Directorate doubted that this

could be the case but dia state that radio traffic normally

used in U.S. surveillance "was not on the air."

sequently was sent to the United States to assess the situ-

and in the course of a month, NOSENKO said, he visited

both New York City and Washington.

KOZLOV discovered not only

that there was no surveillarce of

Soviets but also that "they

dropped our democracies

â¢ Bulgaria, Rumania, Hungary. They

temporarily took them (surveillance) off."

Also at this meeting NOSENKO conmented that:

- "If your surveillance comes up on the radio, they

(KGB monitors) pick them up everywhere."

The practice of KGB case officers has not to

proceed directly

from a Soviet installation to a neeting

with an agent,

but rather to use other Soviets as decoys

"so that you will think we are working on somebody, where-

as in fact we are not working on then.
