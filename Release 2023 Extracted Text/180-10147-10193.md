TOP SEGRET

When President John F. Kennedy was assassinated

on November 22, 1963,, the United States investigative

agencies--FBI, CIA, Secret Service, etc.--were asked to

investigate the assassination. When the Central Intelli-

gence Agency's Mexico City Station remembered that Lee

Harvey Oswald had visited Mexico City during late Septem-

ber and early October, it reviewed the electronic surveil-

lance files and found evidence of phone calls to the so-

viet Embassy made September 27th, September 28th, and

October Ist, that could have

been made by Oswald. 685/

Review of the electroic surveillance files also produced

telephone calls on September 27, 1963 between the Russian

Consul and Silvia Duran, a secretary at the cuban Consu-

late, where Oswald was discussed. 686/ In addition,

the Mexico City Station found a September 28, 1963 phone

call from Silvia Duran to the Soviet Consulate where Silvia

Duran stated that there was an American citizen at the

•Cuban Consulate who had previously visited the Soviet Con-

sulate. 687/ A final phone call was made on October 1, 1963

where the "alleged" Oswald identified himself was also

found. 688/

mined that it would request the Mexican government--

with whom it had a good relationship--to arrest Silvia

Duran

(as Silvia

Duran was a Mexican citizen, she did not

have diplomatic immunity) because she might shed some light

on the circumstances surrounding the assassination. 688a/

The Mexico City Station sent a note to the Gober-

nacion head, Luis Echevarria, with Silvia Duran's address,

her mother's address, her brother's address, her license

plate number, her home phone number, her place of work and

a request that she be arrested immediately. 689/ The Mexi-

co City Station also suggested that Duran he held incommuni-

cado until she could be questioned on the matter. 690/

The Mexico City Station did not receive prior au-

thorization from CIA Headquarters to request the arrest of

Silvia Duran by Mexican authorities. 691/ Headquarters

feared that a request to arrest Ms. Duran would jeopardize

the clandestine relationship between certain Mexican govern-

ment officials and the CIA if it were disclosed that Americans

were behind Duran's arrest. 672/ John Scelso, Chief of Western

Hemisphere/3, stationed at Langley Headquarters, telephoned

Winston Scott, the

Mexico City Chief of Station, and requested

that Silvia Duran not be arrested. 693/ Scott told Scelso that

he could not rescind the request, and that Headquarters should

already have Classificationle stating that Silvia Duran had

been arrested. 694/ After Winston Scott's conversation

with John Scelso, Scott called Luis Echevarria and stated

that the Mexico City Station desired that all information

received from Duran be forwarded immediately to the Mexico

City Station, and that her arrest and statements not be

communicated to any leftist groups. 695/

On November 27, 1963, the Mexican government for-

warded to the Mexico City Station a copy of Silvia Duran's

ten-page signed statement. 696/ It said,

"Upon learning about the assassination

she and

her husband speculated that presi-

dent Kennedy might have been assassinated

for racial

reasons. When she became aware

that the assassin

was Lee Harvey Oswald, she

ascertained that it was the same man who

ap-

proximately two months prior had

been

to the

Cuban Consulate to solicit an intransit visa

to Russia.

Having

taken his name from the

special documentation he presented she knew

that he was married to a Russian woman and

belonged

to the

"Fair Play for Cuba Committee."

She checked the data in the Consulate archives

and became certain that it was the same indi-

vidual who was blonde, short, dressed unelegant-

ly and whose face

turned red when angry.

The

Consul had

denied

the visa because to obtain

an intransit visa from the Cuban government,

it was imperative that he previously obtain

visa from the Soviet Consulate.

Since obtain-

ing a visa from the soviets took four months

and Oswald's Mexican visa expired soon Oswald

was

advised: that he see the Soviet Consul, and

calling

the person in charge of that office.

The soviet official told her that they would

have to consult Moscow which would take four

months.

That afternoon, Oswald returned to the

General bure

Cuban Consulate and Silvia Duran confirmed

that he could get a Cuban visa only after he

received a Russian visa.

She gave Oswald her name

and business phone number but never gave him her..,

address

because she had no reason to give it to

him.

The only aid she could give Oswald was advising

that he see the soviet Consul and calling the person

in charge of that office.

She knew that phoning the

Soviet Consulate was not

one of her duties and that

if she did so she did it only to help Oswald. She

gave Oswald her business phone number only because he

would have to call subsequently to check whether he

had obtained a visa.

He never called back."

Silvia Duran, released on November 24, 1963, was rearrestedl

November 27, 1963, when the Mexican government alleged that she

was attempting to leave Mexico for travel to Havana. 698/

According to the Mexican officials who detained Duran a second

time, there was no addition to her story. 699/

The Mexico City Station forwarded Duran's ten-page signed

statement to Headquarters on November 27, 1963. 700/ The

following day, Headquarters sent a clarification cable to the

Mexico City Station

seeking to insure that neither Silvia

Duran nor the cubans would have any basis for believing that

the Americans were behind her rearrest. The cable stated,

"We want the Mexican authorities to take the responsibility

for the whole affair." 701/

the

Central Intelligence Agency began to work

with the Warren Commission, Headquarters cabled the Mexico

that its plan in passing information to the

Warren

Commission was to eliminate mention of telephone

taps in order to protect their continuing operations. 702/

Headquarters cabled that it would rely on Silvia Duran's

statements and on the Consular files which the Soviets

gave the State Department. 703/ Headquarters stressed

that exact, detailed information from LITAMIL-7 and

LITAMIL-9--penetration agents in the Cuban Embassy--on

what Silvia Duran and other officials had said about 0s-

wald's visit and his dealings would be valuable and usable

corroborative evidence. 704/

When the Central Intelligence Agency forwarded to

the Warren Commission a copy of Duran's signed statement.

It read

as follows:

...she remembered.. (that Lee Harvey Oswald)

was the name of an American who had come to

the Cuban Consulate to obtain a visa to travel

to cuba in transit to Russia, the latter part

of september or the early part of October of

this year, and in support of his application

had shown

his passport, in which it was noted

that he had lived in

that country for a

period

of three years; his labor card

from the same

country written in the Russian language; and

letters in that same

language.

He had presented

evidence that he was

married to a Russian woman,

and also

that he was apparently the leader of

claim-

ing that he should be accepted as a "friend" of

the Cuban Revolution.

Accordingly, the declarant,

complying with her duties, took down all of the

information and completed the

application

appropriate

form; and the declarant,

ad-

mittedly exceeding her responsibilities,

informally telephoned the Russian Consulate,

with the intention of doing what she could

to facilitate issuance of

the Russian visa

to Lee Harvey Oswald.

However, they told

her that there would be a delay of about

four months in processing the case, which

annoyed the applicant since, according

to

his statement, he was in a great hurry to

obtain visas that would enable him to travel

to Russia, insisting on his right to do so

in view of his background and his loyalty

and his activities in behalf of the Cuban

movement.

The declarant was unable to re-

call accurately whether or.not the applicant

told her he was a member of the Communist

Party, but he did say that his wife***was

then in New York City, and would follow

him,*** (Senora Duran stated) that when Os-

wald understood that it was not possible to

give him a Cuban visa

without his first hav-

ing obtained the Russian

visa, *** he became

very excited or angry, and accordingly, the

affiant called Consul Ascue (sic),*** (who)

came out and began a heated disucssion in En-

telling him that

of his type was harming the Cuban Revolution

rather than helping it," it being understood

about the Russian Socialist Revolution.and

not the Cuban.

Oswald

maintained that he had

two reasons

for requesting that his visa be

issued promptly, and they were: one, that his

tourist

permit in Mexico was about to expire;

and the other, that he had to get to Russia

as quickly as

possible.

Depsite her annoyance,

the decalarant gave Oswald a paper*** in which

she put down her name,

"Silvia Duran,"

and

the number of the telephone at the Consulate,

which is "11-28-47" and the visa application

was processed anyway.

It was sent

to the

Ministry of (Foreign) Relations of

Cuba; from

which a routine reply was received

some fifteen

to thirty days later, approving the visa, but on

the condition that the Russian visa be obtained

first, although she does not recall whether or

not Oswald later telephoned her at the Consulate

number that she gave him. 705/

The Central Intelligence Agency had relied on Duran's

statements but had deleted Duran's description of Oswald as

blonde and

short. 706/ It had also excised Duran's statement--

"The only aid she could give Oswald was advising that he see

the soviet Consul, and calling the person in charge of that

office" which alluded to Oswald asking for some type of aid at

the Cuban Consulate. 707/ In addition, Ms. Duran's strong state-

ment "He never called her back" 707a/ was changed to "she does

not recall whether or not Oswald later telephoned her at the

Consulate number that she have him. 707b/ Had the statements

been

included, the Warren Commission's conclusions would not have

seemed as strong.

The Warren Commission staff was not completely satis-

fied with Ms. Duran's ten page signed statement obtained by

the Mexican authorities. W. David Slawson wrote:

We then discussed... the problem of (inter-

viewing) Silvia Duran.

We pointed out that

our only interest in witnesses

(in Mexico)

other than Duran was

to get their formal testi-

mony for authentication purposes...This was

not true of Duran, however, because she had

been interviewed

only by the Mexican police

and we considered that interview inadequate.

(I should point out that we do not consider

it totally inadequate, however.

It is only

on details such as Oswald's physical

appearance, side comments

or remarks he

may have made, etc., that we would like to

interrogate Mrs. Duran further.

On the

essential point of whether or not his con-

tacts with the Embassy consisted of anything

other than an attempt to travel to Cuba,

Silvia Duran's knowledge has probably been

exhausted.) 708/

The Warren Commission staff's attempts to inter-

view Ms. Duran never succeeded. 709/ Ms. Duran was not

interviewed by Americans until 1976, when two reporters

from the Washington Post

interviewed her. 710/ On

June 6, 1978, representatives of the House Select Committee

Assassinations interviewed Ms. Duran in Mexico City.

government complied on 6/6/78. Ms. Tirado told the House

Select Committee on Assassinations the following:

Lee Harvey Oswald visited the Cuban Consulate three

times on September 27, 1963, not twice as the Warren Com-

mission previously reported. 712/ Oswald first visited

the Cuban Consulate at approximately 11:00 a.m., requesting

an intransit visa

to Cuba with Russia as the final destina-

tion. 713/ He showed her some documents, then

left to

obtain photographs needed for his application. 714/

Oswald returned at approximately 1:00 p.m. with

four photographs. 715/ Ms. Tirado typed the application

in duplicate, stapled a picture on top of each and had Os-

wald sign each in her presence. 116/ As identification,

Oswald showed her documents he had brought: his Russian

labor card, marriage certificate with the name of his

Russian wife, his American Communist Party membership card

and his "Fair Play for Cuba" membership card. 717/

Ms. Tirado found Lee Harvey Oswald's behavior suspi-

cious because normally a Communist traveled only with his

passport as belonging to the Communist Party was illegal

in Mexico in 1963. 718/

There was a procedure whereby the American Communist

Party would arrange visa matters for their members with the

Cuban Communist Party. 719/ The American would then

come to Mexico, visit the Cuban Consulate, and receive

his visa immediately. 710/ When Tirado asked Oswald why

he did not have the American Communist Party arrange his

trip

to Cuba, he stated that he had not had the time. 121/

After explaining to Oswald that he had to acquire

a Russian visa before he could

receive a Cuban visa, Tirado

jotted her name and business phone number on a piece of

paper and gave it to Oswald who then left to get his Rus-

sian visa. 722/

Oswald returned to the Cuban Consulate between

5:00 p.m. and 6:00 p.m., which was after normal working

hours, 10:00 to 2:00 p.m. 723/ The guard called Tirado,

stating that someone who did not speak Spanish was at the

gate inquiring about a visa. 724/ As routine procedure,

she asked the guard to escort the individual to her office. 725/

Oswald told her that he had acquired a Russian visa. 726/

Since he did not produce it when asked, she called the

Russian Consulate. 721/ The Consul told Duran that Oswald

had been to the Consulate requesting a visa and had been

told that the reply would take approximately four months. 128/

When she relayed the message to Oswald, he got very excited,

insisting that as a person who had been in jail because

of the cuban Revolution he should receive a visa. 129/

Oswald stated that he could not wait that long because

his

Mexican visa expired in three days. 730/ At this

point, Ms. Tirado informed Consul Eusebio Azcue of the

situation. 731/ Azcue had been in his private office

which he shared with his upcoming replacement, Alfredo

Mirabal. 732/ Azcue politely explained the requisites

for an intransit visa to Oswald. 733/ When he noticed

that Oswald was a stubborn man he told Oswald that he

was obviously not a friend of the Cuban revolution be-

cause he would otherwise understand that Cuba had to be

extremely careful with the people it allowed in the coun

try. 134/ Azcue and Oswald yelled at each other. 735/

Then Azcue went to the door, opened it and asked Oswald

to leave. 736/ Oswald did not revisit or telephone the

Consulate. 737/ Ms. Tirado described Lee Harvey Oswald

as approximately five feet six, with sparse blonde hair,

weighing about 125 Is pounds. 738/

of the Central Intelligene Agency's Mexico City Station. 139/

The source, LIRING/3, stated that he had recently re-

ceived a call from Silvia Duran. 140/ A telephone tap

on LIRING/3's telephone confirmed that Silvia Duran had

called LIRING. 741/ LIRING/3 reported that he had visited

Silvia to renew acquaintancees. 142/ During the visit,

Duran told LIRING/3 that she had met Lee Harvey Oswald

at the Cuban Consulate when

he applied for a visa and

had dated him on

several occasions. 143/ Duran admitted

that she had had intimate relations with Oswald, but in-

sisted that she had no idea of his plans. 744/ In addi-

tion, Duran told LIRING/3 that when the news of the as-

sassination became public knowledge, the Mexican govern-

ment arrested her and during the interrogation beat her

until she admitted that she had had an affair with Lee

Harvey Oswald. 745/ Rowton 746/ counseled LIRING/ 3

against any further contact with Duran because the Cubans

or the Mexican

police might become suspicious of him. 747/

There is no indication in Rowton's report as to why con-

tact with Silvia would make the cubans suspicious.

The CIA Mexico City Station reported this informa-

tion to Headquarters:

First, that Silvia Duran had sexual intercourse

with Lee Harvey Oswald on several occasions

when

the latter was in Mexico is probably

new, but adds little to the Oswald case.

Second, the Mexican police did not report

the extent of the Duran-Oswald relationship

to this Station. 749/

In the chronology of the Mexico City investigation

of Oswald

1, Raymond Rocca

notes: "Why didn't Mexico

police give us all info?" 750/ This was not the first

report of such a relationship between Oswald and Duran.

Elena Garro had reported the same information to Charles

Thomas in 1965. 751/

That the Mexican

government did not disclose all

the information in

its possession to American authorities

raises one of three possibilities:

1) the Mexican government did not want to disclose

that one of its citizens had had intimate rela-

tions with the assassin of John Kennedy; or

2) Silvia Duran was a Mexican penetration agent

in the Cuban Consulate and the Mexican govern-

ment was protecting its informant by minimizing

her relationship with Oswald; or

3) they forgot, i.e., a pure and simple mistake.

b. The possibility that Silvia Duran was an

agent for either American, Mexican or Cuban

Intelligence

since the publication of the Warren Commission

Report in

September 1964, critics have written about the

possibility that Silvia Duran was an intelligence agent

for either the Americans, Mexicans or Cubans.

1) Was Silvia Duran an agent, asset or source

for Mexican or American intelligence?

In an effort to resolve this question, the House

Select Committee on Assassinations reviewed the United

States investigative agencies' files on Silvia Duran. 752/

The Committee found no evidence in this file review that

Silvia Duran was either an American or Mexican intelli-

gence agent.

In addition, the Committee has interviewed most

of the Mexico City Station employees about the possibility.

Only David Phillips, Chief of Covert Action and the Cuban

Section in the Mexico City Station in 1963, a position

which made him very knowledgeable, considered that Duran

was possibly an agent or source. Mr. Phillips stated that

"at one time the agency pitched 753/ almost everyone

at the Cuban Embassy." 754/ Mr. Phillips stated that

he had first heard Duran's name from the telephone

intercept transcripts. 755/ But Mr. Phillips asserted

that the CIA had no interest in Ms. Duran because "she

wasn't friendly with anyone." 756/ Mr. Phillips had

previously mentioned the CIA Mexico City Station's in-

terest in recruiting a former Cuban Ambassador to Mexico

named Lechuga. 757/ Mr. Phillips was shown a memorandum

written by W. David Slawson of the Warren Commission staff

regarding a trip to Mexico by Warren Commission staff

members which said:

Mr. Scott's (Chief of the CIA Station in Mexi-

CO

City) narrative disclosed that the CIA's

action immediately after the assassination con-

sisted basically

of alerting all its confiden-

tial sources of information

throughout Mexico

to immediately channel all information into

their headquarters, and of compiling as com-

plete dossiers as possible on Oswald and every-

one else throughout Mexico who at that time

the CIA knew had had some contact with Oswald...

This meant especially Silvia Duran, who because

she had previously been having an affair with

Lechuga, the former Cuban Ambassador to Mexico

and presently the Cuban representative at the

United Nations, had previously been of substan-

tial interest to the CIA... 758/

Mr. Phillips was surprised by this and stated

that "No one let me in on this operation." 759/ But.

Mr. Phillips added that he doubted that Duran would

have been pitched because the Station could not identify

any of her weaknesses. The Committee staff members then

told Mr. Phillips about the reporting on file concerning

Ms. Duran from one of the Station's penetration agents,

LITAMIL/9, at the Cuban Embassy. At one point LITAMIL/9

had reported to his case officer that all that would

have to be done to recruit Ms. Duran was to get a blonde,

blue-eyed American

in bed with her. 761/ With this, Mr.

Phillips said that it did indeed sound as if the station

had targeted Ms. Duran for recruitment, that the Station's

interest had been substantial, and that the weaknesses

and

means had been

identified. 762/ Mr. Phillips

pointed out, however, that because Duran had been targeted

did not necessarily mean that she had been pitched. 163/

In addition, he stated that he had never heard that Duran

had been pitched. 764/

Mr. Phillips did state that he would expect that

Ms. Duran's file at the CIA would be "very thick" because

of all the telephone intercepts that concerned her and

the substantial interest that the Station had in her. 765/

He stated that much of the material in her file should

predate the assassination. 766/ Mr. Phillips stated that

he would be very surprised if Ms. Duran's 201 file was

small and contained only a few pre-assassination docu-

ments. 767/ This is in fact the case of the Headquarters

201 file. 768/ This Committee has asked the CIA to make

Ms. Duran's Mexican "p" 769/ (personality) file available

for review. The CIA informed the Committee that there

was no "p" file available on Ms. Duran. 770/

Another CIA employee, Dan Neiscuir, who worked on

an "Oswald Task Force" in late September or early October

of 1975 dealing with Freedom of Information Act law suits

brought against the Agency concerning the files on Lee

Harvey Oswald, stated that he believed that Ms. Duran may

have been a source of information for either the CIA or

the Mexicans. 771/ Mr. Neiscuir could not recall why he

specifically had this recollection, but thought that it

was due to something he had seen in Oswald's file. 772/

He said that it may have been the Agency's attempts to

protect Ms. Duran after the assassination and the heavy

cable traffic that those attempts generated that led him

to his inference that she was a source of information

for either the Agency or the Mexicans. 173/

not to recontact Ms. Duran, Mr.

Mr. Neiscuir's hazy recollections, the Committee cannot

definitely resolve whether Silvia Duran was a Mexican or

American intelligence agent or source.

(2) was Silvia Duran a Cuban intelligence agent?

In an effort to resolve this question, the ASCA

reviewed the United States investigative agencies' files

on Silvia Duran. 774/ The Committee found no evidence in

the files that would indicate that Ms. Duran was associated

with Cuban intelligence.

In addition, the HSCA interviewed most of the Mexi-

co City station employees about the possibility that Duran

worked for Cuban intelligence. Only Barney Hidalgo, a

CIA officer who travelled to Mexico City in 1963, considered

the possibility to be likely. 775/ Mr. Hidalgo, professing

not to remember all the details, stated that he thought

that Duran was a Cuban intelligence agent. 176/ Hidalgo

said:

At the time when this contact told me,of

Silvia

Duran I tied

the two together,

yes,

sir. I don't know, how at that time it

was obvious to me as an intelligence agent

that there was some connection there but

it was of no interest whatsoever to me,

contact of mine I mentioned the fact to

wanted to. 777/

Mr. Hidalgo further stated that he never resolved

the issue. 178/

With no corroborating evidence for Mr. Hidalgo's

memory, the Committee must conclude that Silvia Duran

was probably never employed by Cuban Intelligence.

B. The Cubans

1. Eusebio Azcue Lopez

When Lee Harvey Oswald allegedly visited the Cuban

Consulate, Eusebio Azcue Lopez, a Cuban citizen, was the

Cuban Consul. 179/ Because he had diplomatic immunity,

the Cuban government had never been asked to make him

available for questioning. 780/ The Committee, in an ef-

fort to investigate Oswald's contact with representatives

of the Cuban government, asked the Cuban government to

make Eusebio Azcue available for Committee and staff inter-

views. 781/ The Cuban government complied with the commit-

tee's request on April 1, 1978. 7821

During that interview, Mr. Azcue alleged that the

man Jack Ruby shot in the Dallas Police Station was not

the same individual who had visited the Cuban Consulate

in 1963.

Mirabal, who in September 1963, had recently arrived

from Cuba to assume the consul's duties, had also been

present during Oswald's visit. 784/ During a second

trip to Cuba, the Committee interviewed Alfredo Mirabal. 785/

Subsequent to this second trip to Havana, the Committee

asked the cuban government to make Eusebio Azcue and

Alfredo Mirabal available for the public hearings on Sep-

tember 18, 1978. 786/ The Cuban government complied with

the Committee's request.

Eusebio Azcue Lopez told the House Select Committee

on Assassinations

at a public hearing on 9/18/78 the

following:

An individual who gave the name Lee Harvey Oswald

visited the Cuban Consulate on three occasions in late

September 787/ and early October 1963. 788/ The indivi-

dual first visited the Cuban Consulate during working

hours, requesting an intransit visa to Cuba with Russia

as the final destination. 789/ The man showed the secre-

tary, Silvia Duran, some documents 789a/ which he believed

would be sufficient to obtain a visa. 789b/ When the

secretary would not grant him a visa, the man asked Azcue

to see whether upon examination of the documents he could

grant him a visa. 789c/ Azcue answered negatively:

789 d/

The individual then left to obtain photographs needed

for his application. 189e/

The man probably returned on September 27, 1963

789 f/

with the photographs and completed the applications

in Ms. Duran's presence. 789g/

As the amount of time re-

quired to process this document could have taken as long

as twenty days or the response could have been negative,

Azcue told the man that he could grant him an intransit

visa to cuba, without consulting his government, if he

had a Russian visa. 789h/ The individual then left to

attempt to obtain his Russian visa. 7891/

After the man left the Cuban Consulate, Azcue re-

ceived a telephone call 789j/ from the Soviet Consulte. 790/

The Soviet Consul explained that the man's documents

were legitimate, but that the Soviet Consulate could not

issue a visa until it received authorization from Moscow. 791/

Emphasizing that the Cuban Consulate never re-

ceived visitors after working hours 792/ Mr. Azcue opined

that the individual probably returned to the Consulate

on September 28, 1963. 793/ When Azcue explained to

Oswald that he could not grant him a visa, the man made

statements directed against Cuba and called Cuba a

bureaucracy. 194/ At that point, Azcue became upset and

asked the individual to leave the Consulate. 795/ Oswald

did not revisit the Consulate. 796/

Mr. Azcue described the man who visited the consu-

late as follows: a white male, between 5'6" and 5'7",

over 30 years of age, very thin long face, with straight

eyebrows and a cold look in his eyes. 797/ Azcue alleged

that he would never have identified Lee Harvey Oswald as

the man who visited the Cuban Consulate in 1963.

2. Alfredo Mirabal Diaz

Alfredo Mirabal Diaz told the House Select Committee

on Assassinations, at a public hearing on 9/18/78, 797A/

the!following:

Lee Harvey Oswald, seeking a visa, visited the

Cuban Consulate twice 798/ in September 1963. 799/ Since

Mirabal could not speak English though he was the new con-

sul, ex-Consul Azcue handled the matter. 800/ On both

occasions there were such loud arguments between Oswald

and Azcue that Mirabal thought that the man's visit to

the Consulate was a case of provocation. 801/

Though

Mirabal caught only glimpses of the man

he opined that the person whose picture appears on Lee

Harvey Oswald's visa application was the same Lee Harvey

Oswald who visited the Consulate. 802/ Mirabel was about

4 meters away from Oswald each time he caught glimpses of

him. 802a/ Oswald was at the Consulate between 15 and 20

minutes on each visit. 802b/

C. Elena Garro de Paz

On October 5, 1964, eleven days after the publication

of the Warren Commission Report, Elena Garro de Paz' story

alleging Lee Harvey Oswald's presence at a party in Mexico

City attended by Cuban government personnel came to the attention

of the Central Intelligence Agency. 803/

1. Elena's

story as reported October 5, 1964

Elena Garro de Paz 804/ and Deba Garro de Guerrero

Galvan, first cousins of Horatio, Ruben and Lydia Duran,

were invited to a twist party at the home of Ruben Duran

in the middle of the week in the fall of 1963. 805/ Lee

Harvey Oswald was alleged to have been at this party in

the company of "two other beatnik-looking boys." 806/

The Americans

remained together the entire evening and

did not dance. 807/ When Elena tried to speak with the

Americans, she was "shifted" to another room by one of

her cousins. 808/ The memo does not state whether Elena

had mentioned classification:

to the Americans. One of Elena's cousins told her at

the time that (he or she did not know who the Americans

were except that silvia Duran (an employee of the Cuban

Embassy and the wife of Horatio Duran), had brought

them to the party. 809/

The day after the party, Elena and Deba saw the

three Americans on the Insurgentes, a main avenue in

Mexico City. 810/ The Garros claimed that they had recog-

nized Oswald's photograph when it was published after

the

assassination. 811/ Silvia Duran's arrest "under-

lined the Garros' certainty" that the man had been Lee

Harvey Oswald. 812/

The source of the memo was a witting 813/ Central

Intelligence Agency asset known by the cryptonym LICOOKIE/1

whom the Committee identified as June Cobb Sharp while

reviewing the LICOOKIE file. According to Elena, Ms.

Cobb was sent to her house shortly after the assassination

for a few days, by a mutual friend, a Costa Rican writer

named Eunice Odio. 814/ Ms. Garro asserted that while

at her house, Ms. Cobb expressed interest in the Kennedy

assassination. 815/ One night, Elena's sister Deba, who

200032-1

was visiting, got drunk and told the whole story. 816/

claiming to

be a CIA agent, Cobb suggested that Elena and

Deba go to Texas to tell their story. 817/ Elena stated

that when Cobb's suggestion was rejected, Cobb stated

that she would arrange a meeting with the CIA Station

Chief. 818/ The meeting did not occur because Ms. Cobb

was asked to leave the Garro house evidently because

she kicked Elena's cat. 819/ A notation on the memo says

that LICOOKIE/l never regained contact with Elena Garro

de Paz. 820/

The LICOOKIE memo was not inserted in either the

Elena Garro or Lee Harvey Oswald "p" 821/ (personality)

file but in a local leftist and Cuban project file. The

Committee learned about the memo from Wx-7241, a chrono-

logical history of the Oswald case prepared by Raymond

Rocca for the CIA in 1967. The memo was found in Decem-

ber, 1965 by Stanley Watson. A marginal notation on

Wx7241 says, "Why was this not sent to Headquarters?" 823/

The Committee has been able to determine that the memo

was forwarded to Headquarters shortly thereafter.

2. October 12, 1964 CIA Memo for the Record

On October 12, 1964 the CIA Mexico City Station's

Chief of Covert Action, Jim Flannery, wrote a memo for

the record reporting that Elena Garro de Paz had told

her story to Eunice Odio. 824/

The Committee has not been able to determine if

Elena Garro told Ms. Odio the story personally or if

Ms. Cobb related the story to Ms. Odio who relayed it to

"Tichborn." 825/

The story is not as detailed as the 10/5/64 ver-

sion. There is no mention of Deba Garro Guerrero Galvan.

The story, perhaps because it is third hand, differs

from the previous story in two areas: It states that

the party was at the Cuban Embassy, as opposed to Ruben

Duran's; and that Elena talked to a Cuban Embassy offi-

cial instead of her cousins about the three Americans.

Attached to the memo was a note from Flannery to

the Chief of Station, Winston Scott, which read, "Do you

want me to send the gist of this to Headquarters?" Scott

then noted that the memo should be filed. 826/ The file

indications show that the memo went into the Oswald "p"

file

and the Elena Garro "p" file. 827/

3. November 24, 1964 CIA Informant Report

In

addition, the informant claimed that

Elena had also told her story to an American official

at the Embassy, who claimed to represent the Warren Com-

mission. 832/ The Chief of Station noted that he had

asked LICHANT/l to pursue the story 833/ but there is

no indication that the Chief of Station followed through

with the request. 834/

4. November 24, 1964 Elena Garro meeting with

Mexico City Legal Attache officers

Elena and her daughter reported their story to the

Mexico City Legal Attache on November 24, 1964. 835/

(The Legal. Attache in 1964 was Clark Anderson.) They

recounted the same story previously given to June Cobb

Sharp in

October 1964. 836/ Elena gave the date of the

party as September 30, October 1 or October 2, 1963. 8371

The agent who wrote the report 838/ noted that Lee Harvey

Oswald could not have been identical with the American 839/

allegedly observed by Mrs. Paz at the party if this party

were

held on the evening of October 1 or October 2, 1963.

other persons attending the party at the Ruben Duran home

who might have been in a position to observe the three

Americans. 841/

Elena stated that in the course of

the party her daughter met a young man named "Alejandro"

at the party and danced with him. 842/ He was apparently

quite

smitten with the daughter and tried to call her

on several occasions after the party. 843/ The daughter

did not take the calls and as a result "Alejandro" wrote

several letters to the daughter. 844/. Ms. Garro exhibited

two of the letters, as well as a business card which

identified the young man as Ario Alejandro Lavagnini

Stenius. 845/

The letter which Ms. Garro said was the first

written by the young man to her daughter bore the date

September 1, 1963 and the Mexico City Post Office post-

mark dated September 2, 1963. 846/ When this was pointed

out to Ms. Garro she commented that the communists pro-

bably had facilities for falsifying postmarks. 847/

To investigate Ms. Garro's

story further, repre-

sentatives from. the Legal Attache's office interviewed

Ario Alejandro Lavagnini Stenius on November 27, 1964. 848/

Lavagnini recalled that there were approximately thirty

people at Ruben Duran's party, few of whom he knew. 849/

He recalled having met a Mexican girl who had recently

returned from living in France. 850/ He was unable to

fix the date of the party but felt it was probably early

in September because of a heavy rain which occurred as they

were leaving the party about 2:00 a.m. 851/

Lavagnini said that no Americans were present at

this party. 852/ He was familiar with the physical de-

scription of Lee Harvey Oswald because of publicity fol-

lowing the assassination of President Kennedy, but other-

wise had no knowledge of him and had never seen

him except

for news photographs following the assassination. 853/

Lavagnini

was the only person interviewed by

the Legal Attache representatives who attended parties at

the Duran house in the September-October time frame.

There is no indication in the FBI document that

this information was given to the Central Intelligence

Agency's Mexico City Station. 854/

On 12/10/65, Charles Thomas, a political officer

tioned knowing Oswald. 857/ Thomas noted that she was

reluctant to talk but did. 858/

Elena's story reported here is the same as that

given in the LICOOKIE memo dated 10/5/64, but with more

details. She said that General Jose Jesus Clark Flores

(a friend of Ruben Duran's), Silvia Duran, Eusebio Azcue,

Emilio Carballido la pro-Communist writer-friend of the

Durans), and a Latin American Negro man with red hair

(unidentified) were at the party. 859/ A marginal com-

ment by this entry in Wx-7241 says, "How did Elena know

about a red-haired Negro?" 860/ Elena also told Thomas

that she had later learned that "Silvia Duran had been

Oswald's mistress while he was there." 861/ A note by

this entry in Wx-7241 says, "How did Elena Garro know

about Silvia being the mistress of Oswald? This is 1965."

862/ The Mexico City Station did not hear about the

Oswald-Duran "affair" until July 1967 when a CIA asset,

LIRING/3, reported

it. 863/

Elena told Thomas that she and her daughter had

gone to the Cuban Embassy on November 23, 1963 and shouted

"Assassins"

and other insults at the Embassy employees. 864/

Gobernacion, took her and her daughter to a small hotel

in the center of Mexico City. 865/ Calvillo kept Elena

Garro and her daughter there for eight days under the pre-

text that they were in danger of being harmed physically

by Communists. 866/ Elena claimed she told Calvillo

her story and that she wanted to tell it to the American

authorities at the U.S. Embassy 867/ but that Calvillo

dissuaded her by telling her that the American Embassy

was full of Communist spies. 868/ Elena said that some

of the other people who had been at the party were taken

to Veracruz where they were "protected" by Governor

Lopez Arias. 869/ She said that Ruben Duran, reportedly

"protected" by General Clark Flores, was very prosperous

and was driving a big car. 870/ Elena also claimed

that Ruben Duran told her months after the assassination

that he was not really a Communist and that killing Ken-

nedy had been a mistake. 871/ Ruben Duran claimed he

had no reason

to tell Elena that killing Kennedy had been

a mistake since he had no involvement. 872/

Station to aid them in their investigation of the John

The Mexico City Station cabled the information in

Thomas' 12/10/65 memorandum of conversation to CIA Head-

from the Cuban surveillance operation "and other

6. Charles Thomas' Meeting with Elena Garro on

December 25, 1965

Thomas met with Elena again on December 25, 1965.

On that date, he wrote a memorandum of conversation which

provided a much more detailed restatement of Ms. Garro's

alleged encounter with Lee Harvey Oswald. 885/

Elena admitted that she had spoken to two men at

the Embassy, "presumably from the Legal Attache's Of-

fice." 886/ Elena said that she did not tell them

the complete story because "the Embassy officers did not

give much credence to anything she and Elenita said." 887/

She stated that the party had been at Ruben Duran's

home. 888/ She was unclear about the date of the

party, 889/ She thought it had been a few days before

the Soviet Astronaut, Gagarin, Visited Mexico; she thought

that this would put the party around September 2 or 3,

1963. 890/ She believed that the party was on a Monday

or Tuesday because it was an odd night for a party. 891/

Elena could not check her calendar to refresh her memory

at the time of this interview because the calendar was

in a desk that had been

stored away. 892/

During the conversation, Elena described Oswald

and his companions. 893/ The man who she thought was Os-

wald wore a black sweater. 894/ She said he was quiet

"and

stared a lot at the floor." 895/ One of his com-

panions "was very tall and slender and had long blond

hair and a rather long protruding chin." 896/ The other

companion was also tall, with short, light brown hair

and no distinguishing characteristics. 897/ The three

Americans did not dance or mix with the other guests. 898/

Elena saw

the same three men on the street the next

day. 899/

Elena was certain that Eusebio Azcue, Horacio

Duran, Silvia Duran, Lydia Duran, Deba Guerrero, General

Clark Flores and his mistress, a doctor from Dalinde Hos-

pital, a young American couple who were honeymooning in

Mexico, and several other people were at the party. 900/

She said that Ricardo Guerra, whom she claimed converted

Horatio Duran

to Communism, and his wife, Rosario Castel-

lanos, were supposed to be at the party but did not at-

tend. 901/

Elena alleged that the red-haired man and Emilio

Carballido were not at the party that Oswald attended

but at another party where Carballido and Azcue got into

a heated argument about President Kennedy. 902/ "They

came to the conclusion that the only solution was to

kill him.

" 904/ Elena was not clear on whether this party

was before or after the party where she met Oswald. 905/

Eusebio Azcue stated that this conversation never

occurred. 906/

Elena

reitereated that the incident at the Cuban

Embassy, where she and her daughter shouted "assassins,"

etc., at the Embassy employees, occurred on November 23

at or about 3:00 p.m. 907/ Elena and Elenita were driven

to the Cuban Embassy by Elena's brother who was embar-

rassed by their behavior. 908/ This occurred before

they had seen photographs of Oswald. 909/

Ms. Garro claimed that later in the day she and

Elenita were visited by Manuel Calvillo who told them

that they were in serious danger from the Communists and

that he would take them to a small hotel, where they

would be safe for a few days. 910/ Elena said she

trusted and believed Calvillo because he was a known

undercover agent for the Mexico Government. 911/ He

was also a friend of Noe Palomares 912/and of President

Gustavo Diaz Ordaz. 913/ Calvillo also told Elena

and

her daughter that Silvia Duran had been arrested. 914/

Duran's arrest was not public information at that time. 915/

Elena could not remember the name of the hotel

so that same day (12/25/65) she took Thomas to the sec-

tion of Mexico City where she thought it was. 916/ They

found the hotel, the Hotel Vermont. 917/ Elena said

that she assumed that Calvillo had registered them as rela-

tives or friends from San Luis Potosi. 918/ They stayed

at the hotel until the following Friday, November 30, 1963,

hardly leaving their rooms. 919/

Elena claimed that while she and Elenita were at

the hotel they saw the photos of Oswald and realized

that he had been the man at Ruben Duran's party. 920/

When Calvillo visited them at the hotel, Elena told him

that she wanted to report her story, which she related

at Ruben Duran's party. 923/ Deba was "terrified" be-

Elena stated that it was "common knowledge" that

Silvia had been Oswald's mistress. 926/ When asked who

the Mexico City Station with an attached note asking

the Section to check whether Elena was "seen creating

such a disturbance as they claimed in front of the Cuban

prior to September 26, 1963 and that no information had

developed that would show that he had not been in New

of this memo to the Central Intelligence Agency's Mexico

City Station. 957/ A marginal comment made by Raymond

Rocca next to this entry in Wx-7241 says, "How can it

10. Legal Attache Memo to Winston Scott re Elena's

Allegation that She Had Stayed at the Hotel

Vermont from the Day After the Assassination

Until November 30, 1963

On 10/13/66, the Legal Attache wrote a memo to

Win Scott reporting that a reliable confidential infor-

mant had

reported that the records of the Hotel Vermont

disclosed that one "Elena Paz, housewife from San Luis

Potosi," had registered at the Hotel Vermont on November

23, 1963. 959/ She left on November 30, 1963. 960/

The memo said, "The above individual may or may not be

identical with Elena Garro de Paz." 961/ The House Se-

lect Committee on Assassinations has been unable to deter-

mine why the Central Intelligence Agency and the Federal

Bureau of Investigations waited until 1966 to investigate

this aspect of Elena's story.

her daughter did not personally register at the hotel.

She thinks Calvillo registered them as relatives or

friends of his from

San Luis Potosi, " corroborates

11. Charles Thomas' September 30, 1969 Letter to

State Department and Legal Attache's Response

No further report on Elena's story was generated

until 1969 when Charles Thomas was "selected out" of the

United States Foreign Service. 964/ At that time, he

wrote a memorandum to the Secretary off State which in-

cluded a cover letter stating, "Since I was the Embassy

Officer in Mexico who acquired this intelligence informa-

tion, I feel a responsibility for seeing it through to

its final evaluation." 965/

Charles Thomas' memorandum stated that "he got

no reaction from Nathan Ferris and Winston Scott" regard-

ing his memorandum of December 25, 1965. 966/ In addi-

tion, Thomas wrote that the only person to speak to him

about the December 25, 1965 memorandum, Clarence Boon-

stra 967/ told him that Oswald had not been in Mexico

on the date given for the party. 968/ Thomas noted that

story but rather that she had now given a more detailed

account, Boonstra stated that the date was wrong and dis-

missed the entire affair.

969/

One of the Mexico City Legat Officers, Nathan

Ferris, in reply to Thomas' letter and memorandum, asserted

that Thomas' office had been advised by memoranda dated

December 21, 1965 and February 23, 1966 that since Elena

Garro's allegations had previously been investigated

without substantiation, no further action was being taken

concerning

her recent repetition of those allegations. 970/

In its report, the Legat's Office concluded that either

the Counselor for Political Affairs did not route the

memoranda to Charles Thomas or that Thomas did not re-

call receiving them. 971/

Thomas wrote that when he went to Nathan Ferris'

office to inform him that Elena had found her calendar 972a/

and had reconstructed the date of the party as late

September,

Ferris replied that Elena had given the late

September date when she had originally reported her story

at the American Embassy. 972/ Thomas noted that Ferris

explained that someone who had been at the party had

stated that there had not been any Americans in attendance. 973/

Thomas wrote that he had assumed that Elena could have

some Americans. 974/ Thomas wrote that Ferris had sug-

gested that it was not necessary for Thomas to pursue

the matter since he considered the Oswald case closed

and had heard all the rumors before. 975/

The Legal Attache's reply to Thomas' memo stated

that Mr. Ferris had not told Thomas that someone who was

at the party had stated that there had not been any Ameri-

cans present. 976/ The Legal Attache's memo asserted

that Thomas had been told that it would not be necessary

for him to pursue the matter any further since Elena's

story had been investigated previously without being

substantiated. 971/ In addition, the memo stated that

Thomas had been told that Elena's story was considered

a closed issue, not that the Oswald case was closed. 978/

on Elena Garro de Paz, Elenita Garro de Paz, Manuel Calvillo,

Noe W. Palomares, June Cobb Sharp, Victor Rico Galan,

Eunice Odio, Sylvia Duran, Lydia Duran, Ruben Duran, Betty

Serratos, Horatio Duran, Eusebio Azcue, and Emilio Car-

ballido. Only the Elena Garro de Paz file contained in-

formation on her allegations. Though all the names listed

above played a role in Elena Garro de Paz' story, not one

of their files included a reference to Elena Garro de Paz.

Furthermore, the House Select Committee on Assassina-

tions requested and

reviewed the Central Intelligence

Agency's LICOOKIE/1, LICHANT/1, LIRING/3, and TICHBORN

files. Once again, not one of the files included a men-

tion of Elena Garro's allegations. The House Select Com-

mittee on Assassinations learned that LICOOKIE/1, who first

reported to the CIA Elena's allegation, was June Cobb

sharp. 979/

LICHANT/1 was

Manuel Calvillo who had hidden Elena Garro and her daughter

in a hotel the day following the assassination. 980/

He also told Elena that Silvia Duran had been

arrested

before this fact had become public knowledge. 981/

Since a file review

was inconclusive, the Committee

Emilio Carbillido and Betty Serratos. 982/ The Mexican

Government informed the House Select Committee on Assassina-

tions that Elena and Elenita Garro disappeared in 1968

during the student uprisings and have never returned to

Mexico. 983/ The officials stated that Elena and her

daughter might be in Spain. 984/ The Mexican government

reported that Emilio Carballido could not be found. 985/

The others were interviewed between June l and June 6,

1978. 986/

Betty Serratos, Lydia Duran, Ruben Duran and

Horatio Duran all stated that Elena was not the dancing

type and therefore did not attend any of the twist parties

at the Duran

homes. 987/ When Silvia Duran was asked if

Elena or Elenita Garro ever attended twist parties at the

Duran homes, she recalled Elena attending one twist party

at Ruben's home in 1963 after the Garros returned to Mexico

from France. 988/ All the Durans denied that Lee Harvey

Oswald had attended any party at one of their homes. 989/

The Committee next asked the Central Intelligence

Agency to arrange interviews with LICHANT/l (Manuel Calvillo),

LICOOKIE/1 (June Cobb), who may have had information related

to Lee Harvey Oswald's trip to Mexico City. 990/ The

Central Intelligence Agency declined to aid the Committee

in this aspect of the investigation. 99l/

The Committee returned to Mexico City on August 7,

1978 and attempted to locate June Cobb Sharp and Manuel

Calvillo on its own. 992/

The Mexican government told the Committee that

June Cobb Sharp received a tourist permit, number 72781,

on June 27, 1947 when she entered Mexico through Nuevo

Lardeo. She

asked, but was denied, permission to repre-

sent the magazine, Modern Mexico. On June 21, 1948, she

received a coutesy permiet, number 25556. Furthermore,

the Mexican government explained that she disappeared in

1954 and never returned to Mexico. 993/

The Committee believes that this information is

incorrect.

According to Ms. Cobb's CIA file, she worked

for the agency as an asset in Mexico from 1961 through

1966. 994/ Elena also stated that Ms. Cobb resided at

her home in 1964. 995/

The Mexican government told the Committee that

Manuel Calvillo did not live at Cuohtemoc 877-5 as the

Committee had informed it. The Mexican Government's

Manuel Calvillo had ever resided there. When Committee

staffers gave the Mexican government Calvillo's pen

name, the Mexicans gave the same answers. 996/

The committee believes that there is a possibility

that Mr. Calvillo lived at this address since it acquired

the address from a recent CIA document. 997/

The committee believes that there is a possibility

that a U.S. Government agency requested the Mexican govern-

ment to refrain from aiding the Committee with this aspect

of its work. 998/ (See Procedural Write-up Trip 2 Mexico

City and Section VII, C, below.)

The Committee made every attempt possible to locate

Elena.

On July 7, 1978 the Committee telephoned her pub-

lisher, Mortiz, in Mexico City and inquired about Elena's

whereabouts. 999/ The publisher stated that Ms. Garro

was living in the Hotel S.A.C.E. in Madrid, Spain. 1000/

The Committee telephoned the Hotel S.A.C.E. in Spain and

The Committee called the Mexican Embassy in

visited the Embassy a couple of weeks before to pick up

a check she seemed financially destitute. 1004/ He

stated that when he asked Elena her new address she

declined to give one, stating that she would return every

few weeks to pick up checks and mail. 1005/ The Commit-

Navarro, the brother-in-law of Silvia Duran. In

D. Oscar Contreras Lartigue

On March 16, 1967, B. J. Ruyle, the American Consul

in Tampico, reported to the American Embassy that he had

spoken to a reporter who allegedly had met Lee Harvey Oswald

at the National Autonomous University of Mexico City 1018/

in 1963. 1019/ The reporter, stressing that he had only

a fleeting contact with Oswald, had claimed to have known

only about Lee Harvey Oswald's desire to travel to Cuba

and the Embassy's unwillingness to grant him a visa. 1020/

When B. J. Ruyle asked the reporter for permission to

cable the story to the American Embassy, the reporter

declined, stating that he feared losing his job. 1021/

to the assassination, the reporter had told

his editor about his contact with Lee Harvey Oswald, who

granted B. J. Ruyle permission to cable the story to

the American Embassy when Ruyle promised that it would

be handled with the strictest confidence. 1023/ Ruyle

wrote that he thought the reporter was genuinely con-

cerned about his job. 1024/

A letter from B. J. Ruyle to the State Department

dated May 11, 1967 provided additional details of the

reporter's story. 1025/ The reporter alleged that he

and some fellow students had met Lee Harvey Oswald as

they exited the Cineclub at the Escuela de Filosofia

(School of Philosophy) at the National Autonomous Univer-

sity of Mexico. 1026/ Oswald told the group that he had

gone to the National Autonomous University of Mexico

looking for pro-Castro students who might help him per-

suade the Cuban Embassy to grant him a visa. 1027/

Oswald claimed that he was from California and was a mem-

ber of a pro-Castro group in New Orleans. 1028/ Oswald

remained with the students the rest of that day and even-

ing, as well as the following day. 1029/ The reporter

described Oswald as a strange and introverted individual

who spoke very little Spanish. 1030/

The State Department forwarded a copy of Ruyle's

letter to the Central Intelligence Agency. 1031/ On

June 14, 1967, CIA Headquarters sent the Mexico City Sta-

tion a copy of Ruyle's letter to Bowles. 1032/ CIA

Headquarters considered Ruyle's report "the first piece

of substantive info about Oswald's sojourn in Mexico"

since the assassination. 1033/ Consequently, Headquarters

cabled that though it understood the source's reluctance

to become involved "the fact remains that this info

cannot continue to be withheld or concealed. " 1034/

Headquarters instructed the Mexico City Station to eli-

cit the identity of the source from Ruyle. 1035/ In

addition, Headquarters asked the Mexico City Station to

bear in mind, while interviewing Ruyle's source, that

Lee Harvey Oswald was a homosexual. 1036/ The final

sentence of the dispatch, "It is our hope that the facts

obtained through these interviews will help to confirm

that several of Garrison's allegations about involvement

of anti-Castro

Cubans, the CIA, etc. are false," 1037/

explained the Central Intelligence Agency's motives for

pursuing the

story.

an Oscar Contreras as a signer of a protest for

following day, June 11, 1969. 1056/

The Committee has

determined that the Central In-

telligence Agency's main interest in Oscar Contreras

was "to confirm that several of Garrison's allegations

about involvement of anti-Castro Cubans, the CIA, etc.

are false." 1057/ After the CIA Mexico City Station

official's interview with Contreras 1058/ revealed

nothing that could be useful to the agency, it decided

VII. Analysis of Lee Harvey Oswald's Activities in

Mexico City

A. Introduction

After the Warren Commission published its report

two very important allegations related to Lee Harvey Os-

wald's activities in Mexico City came to the attention of

the United States investigative agencies. In 1964, Elena

Garro de Paz reported that she had seen Lee Harvey Oswald,

accompanied by two other men, at a party at the home of

Ruben Duran Navarre, the brother-in-law of Silvia Duran. 1060/

In 1967, Oscar Contreras Lartigue reported that

he met

Lee Harvey Oswald on the campus of the National Autono-

mous University of Mexico. 1061/

In addition, the testimony of the Warren Commission's

primary witness related to Mexico City, Silvia Tirado

Duran, has been called into question by the critics

throughout the years. 1062/ Some of the information

that is inconsistent with Ms. Duran's original story--

that Oswald visited the Consulate on two occasions which

were the only times she saw

him--was available at the

time of the warren Commission's inquiry although it was

ignored. 1063/ Some of the information has developed

after the publication of the Warren Report. 1064/

The Garro and Contreras allegations, in conjunction

with the inconsistencies of Ms. Duran's story raise three ma-

jor questions: (1) did Lee Harvey Oswald or an imposter

visit the Cuban Consulate in Mexico City?; (2) other

than his visits to the Cuban Consulate, what were Lee Har-

vey Oswald's activities in Mexico City?; and, (3) was

Lee Harvey Oswald travelling alone in Mexico? These

three questions overlap somewhat in detail; e.g., if Os-

wald was not traveling alone, did one of his companions

impersonate him at the Cuban Consulate? Nonetheless,

each of the three questions will be dealt with in separate

sections below.

In an attempt to answer these questions the House

Select Committee on Assassinations has: 1) interviewed

Mexican 1065/ and Cuban citizens 1066/ who could have

knowledge of Oswald's visits to the Cuban Consulate;

2) interviewed Mexican citizens 1067/ who could have know-

ledge of Oswald's activities and associations in Mexico

City; 3) conducted

an extensive review of the files of

the Central Intelligence Agency and the Federal Bureau

of Investigation that pertain to Oswald's sojourn in

Mexico City. 1068/

B. Did Lee Harvey Oswald or an Imposter Contact

the Cuban and Soviet Consulates in Mexico City?

Lee Harvey Oswald himself probably visited the Cuban

Consulate at least once since his application for a Cuban

instransit visa bears his signature. 1069/ Though the

Cuban Consulate allowed visa applicants

applications out

of the consulate to be returned when

completed, 1070/ Silvia Duran stated she was certain that

Oswald signed the application in her presence. 1071/ Os-

wald's signature on the Cuban visa application, however,

does not by itself rule out the possibility that someone

impersonated Oswald in contacts with the Cuban and Soviet

Embassies.

An analysis of the telephone conversations which

the CIA's Mexico City Station intercepted by tapping the

Soviet Consulate and the Soviet Military Attache's tele-

phone reveals that someone, later identified by the CIA as Oswald,

visited the Cuban Consulate at least two times and the

Soviet Consulate at least three times. 1072/ On Septem-

ber 27, 1963, at 4:05 p.m. Silvia Duran called the Soviet

Consulate. In this conversation she referred to an Ameri-

can seeking an intransit visa to Cuba. 1073/ The substan-

tive information given indicates that she was discussing

Oswald. 1074/ At this time the individual using Oswald's

name already had been at the Soviet Embassy at least once,

since Silvia requested the name of the Soviet Embassy offi-

cial who dealt with the American. 1075/ Silvia also

stated that the American was, at that time, in the Cuban

Consulate. 1076/ At 4:26 p.m. a Soviet Consular official

ted

specifically that Oswald had visited the soviet Con-

sulate. 1078/

On September 28, 1963, at 11:51 a.m. Silvia Duran

called the Soviet Consulate. 1079/ She put the American,

later identified

as Oswald, on the telephone. 1080/ The

American, who was at the Cuban Consulate at the time,

said that he had just been at the Soviet Consulate. 1081/

The conversation ended with the American stating that he

was returning to the Soviet Consulate. 1082/

Analysis of Silvia Duran's and Eusebio Azcue's

testimony would tend to indicate that Oswald, or someone

impersonating him, visited the Cuban Consulate at least

one and possibly two additional times on September 27,

1963. Silvia Duran says that Oswald first visited the

Cuban Consulate at approximately 11:00 a.m. requesting

an intransit visa to Cuba with Russia as the final de-

stination. 1083/

Ms. Duran sent Oswald to obtain photo-

graphs that he needed for the visa application. 1084/

Eusebio Azcue recalls that this visit probably occurred

on the date on the visa application, 9/27/63. 1085/

Ms. Duran also stated that Oswald returned at ap-

proximately 1:00 p.m. with four photographs. 1086/ Eusebio

Azcue also stated that the individual later identified

as Oswald returned to the Cuban Consulate about 1:00 p.m.

with the photographs probably on "the date that appears

on the application, that is to say on the 27th." 1087/

The committee believes that there is a possibility that

the argument between Azcue and the individual occurred

during this visit. 1088/

Ms. Duran stated that Oswald's third and last

visit occurred

in the late afternoon after working hours

on the 27th. 1089/ This visit is confirmed by the ClA's

tap on the Soviet Consulate. 1090/

In addition to the alleged Oswald visits to the

consulates, there were other telephonic contacts that may

have been between Oswald, or an imposter, and the consu-

lates. 1091/

Several details about Oswald's visits to

the Cuban Consulate, and telephonic contacts with both

consulates suggest that the individual involved may not

have been Oswald..

Silvia

Duran's description of Oswald did not re-

semble Oswald's true physical appearance. 1092/ This

description, which appeared early in the reporting of in-

formation obtained from Ms. Duran was deleted from subse-

quent reports and was not at all mentioned in the Warren

Report. 1093/ (See Section V, C, for details.) Eusebio

Azcue's description of Oswald was similar. to silvia

Duran's, but more detailed. 1094/ Perhaps the most re-

markable thing about these descriptions is their simi-

larity to Elena Garra de Paz' description of one of Os-

wald's alleged companions. 1095/

Another possible indication that an imposter may

also have visited the Consulate is the 9/28/63 intercepted

conversation. 1096/ Silvia Duran adamantly denies that Oswald

or any other American visited the Cuban Consulate on Saturday,

September 28, 1963. 1097/ In light of the CIA intercept

of that date, Ms. Duran has either lied to the Committee

or the individual who visited the Consulate on September

28 was not Oswald. 1098/ Ms. Duran, in light of the in-

consistencies detailed in Sections V, C and VI, A above,

may not be the most credible witness, but there are indi-

cations that she was truthful when she stated that Oswald

did not visit the Consulate on September 28. The Septem-

ber 28, 1963 conversation was linked to Oswald because

of the marginal notations made by the CIA translator on

the transcript. 1099/ The translator noted on the trans-

cript that the caller spoke "terrible, hardly recognizable

Russian. " 1100/ On October 1, 1963, a man called the

Soviet Consulate and identified himself as "Lee Os-

wald." 1101/ This man also stated that he had been at

the Consulate on Saturday, the 28th. 1102/ The transla-

tor noted that this was the same man who had called the

Consulate "a day or so ago" and had spoken in broken

Russian. 1103/ From this information, and possibly a

voice comparison 1104/, the 9/28 caller was identified

as Oswald. 1105/ The problem with assuming that the

caller on 9/28 and 10/1 was Oswald is that Oswald spoke

fluent Russian. 1106/ Granted, Ms. Duran's denial of

the Saturday visit and the proficiency of the caller's

Russian is not sufficient evidence to conclude that the

person

who

visited the Cuban Consulate on Saturday and

who called the Soviet Consulate on Saturday and on Octo-

ber Ist was an imposter. Yet the information is suffi-

cient to question the assumption that it was Oswald,

especially in light of Azcue's and Duran's descriptions

and Elena Garro de Paz' allegation.

The Committee notes the possibility, but does not

conclude, that the missing production from the pulse

camera

and the LILYRIC base has something to do with the

possibility that someone impersonated Oswald in Mexico.

Three calls that also occurred early on September

27, 1963 may have been by an imposter. At approximately

10:30 a.m. a man called the Soviet Military Attache

looking for a visa to Odessa and was referred to the So-

viet Consulate. 1108/ At 10:37 a.m. a man called the

Soviet Consulate and asked for a visa to Odessa. 1109/

He was told to call back at 11:00. 1110/ At 1:25 p.m.

a man called the Soviet Embassy and was told the Consul

would return between 4:00 p.m. and 5:00 p.m. that day.

While only the callers' requests for a visa to

Russia 1112/ (Odessa) connect these calls to Oswald,

the HSCA believes that they do fit logically into a time

sequence created by what is known from testimony and the

electronic intercepts about his actions on that day.

For example, the following is a reasonable possible

chronology of Oswald's actions on 9/27/63 based on analy-

sis of the available evidence. Oswald probably arrived

in Mexico around 10:00 a.m. on September 27. 1113/ By

10:30 Oswald had time to

arrive at the Hotel del Comercio

and to place a call to the Soviet Military Attache who

referred him to the Consul. 1114/ The military attache

also gave the caller directions to the Consulate. 1115/

During the 10:37 a.m. call to the Consulate, the caller

learned that he could contact the Soviet Consul at 11:00

a.m. 1116/ This done, Oswald then visited the Cuban

Consulate where he arrived around 11:00 a.m., on his way

to the Soviet Consulate. This meeting lasted only approxi-

mately fifteen

minutes. 1118/ Oswald was then sent to

obtain photographs and to the Russian Embassy to get the

necessary Russian

visa. 1119/ Oswald returned to the

Cuban Consulate around 1:00 p.m. 1120/ At this point he

had his encounter with Azcue and completed his application.

Oswald realized at this point that he would have problems

Consulate, which lasted approximately fifteen minutes 1123/

Oswald tried to contact the Soviet Consul whom Oswald

claimed had assured him that he would have no problems

obtaining a visa. 1124/ Hence, the 1:25 call. 1125/

During this conversation Oswald learned that the Consul

would be in that evening between 4:00 p.m. and 5:00 p.m. 1126/

Oswald returned to the Cuban Consulate at 4:00 and Silvia

Duran called the Soviet Consul on his behalf. 1127/

Hence, the 4:05 and 4:26 p.m. calls involving Duran. 1128/

tions are all in Spanish.

With the exception of the

1129/

testimony of Delgado, the evidence indicates that Os-

1130/

wald did not speak Spanish. Hence, either the above

detailed calls were not made by Oswald or Oswald could

speak Spanish.

There is not enough evidence firmly to conclude

that some one did impersonate Oswald in Mexico. On the

other händ, the evidence is of such a nature that the

possibility cannot be dismissed.

C. What were Lee Harvey Oswald's Activities in

Mexico City?

When the Warren Commission wrote about Lee Harvey

Oswald's activities in Mexico City, it concluded:

The Commission undertook an intensive investi-

gation to

determine Oswald's purpose and acti-

vities on this journey, with specific reference

to reports that Oswald was an agent of the Cuban

or soviet Governments.

As a result of its investi-

gation, the commission believes that it has

been

able to

reconstruct and explain most of Oswald's

actions during this time.

By Saturday, September 28, 1963, Lee Harvey

Oswald had

failed to obtain

visas at both

the Cuban and Soviet Embassies. From Sunday,

September 29, through Wednesday morning, Octo-

ber 2, when he left Mexico City on a bus bound

for the United States, Oswald spent considerable

time making his travel arrangements, sightseeing

and

checking again with the Soviet Embassy to

learn whether anything had happened on his

visa application. 1131/

subsequent to the Warren Commission's Report,

the allegations of Elena Garro 1132/ and Oscar Contreras

Lartigue 1133/ came to the attention of the United

States investigative agencies. The main allegation of

both these people, that they met lee Harvey Oswald

in Mexico City, remains to this day without direct corro-

boration. Yet the committee feels that it cannot dis-

miss these allegations without giving them any considera-

tion.

The testimony of Silvia Duran and the Cuban Consu-

late Officials Azcue and Mirabal place Oswald's last

contact with the Cuban Embassy on Friday evening, Septem-

ber 27, 1963. 1134/ The transcripts from the CIA's wire-

taps on the Soviet Consulate place Oswald's last visits

to the Soviet and Cuban Consulates on Saturday morning,

September 28, 1963. 1135/ Oswald's last telephonic

contact with the Soviet Consulate came on Tuesday, Octo-

ber 1, 1963. 1136/ Oswald's activities on the days be-

tween September 28 and October 1 are not clearly recorded.

The Warren Commission speculated that he spent most

of this time sightseeing and making travel arrangements. 1137/

It is entirely possible that Oswald did spend some of

his time during this weekend

sightseeing and making

his travel

arrangements. It is also entirely possible

that, after his failure to obtain his visas on Saturday,

September 28, that Oswald did not give up completely

and did attend a party where he would have come into

contact with the Cuban Consular officials and, later,

sought help from pro-Castro students.

It is entirely possible that Ruben Duran had a

"twist party" on September 30, or October 1 1138/ as

Elena Garro has claimed. Ruben, Horacio, Lydia and Silvia

Duran all admitted that they frequently had twist par-

ties in 1963. 1139/ Only Silvia Duran recalled Elena

Garro attending any of the "twist parties" at the Durans'

home. 1140/ She recalled Elena and Elena's daughter,

• Elènita, attending one twist party at Ruben's home in

1963. 1141/ The other Durans adamantly denied that Lee

Harvey Oswald had attended a twist party at one of their

homes. 1142/

Many of the details of Elena Garro's allegations

have not been, or cannot be, corroborated. For example,.

Elena's allegation that some of the people who had been

Duran denied that he had ever discussed the assassination

with Elena Garro. 1144/ Eusebio Azcue denied that he

had discussed President Kennedy with Emilio Carballido

at a party at the durans' home as alleged by Elena

Garro. 1145/ The Committee has not been able to verify

whether or not guards were

posted outside of Elena's

home in 1963 as she claims.

But other details of Elena's story are very credi-

ble. Perhaps the most striking is the suggestion that

Oswald's relationship with Silvia Duran was more exten-

sive than just the business contacts in the Cuban consu-

late. 1146/ Another detail is the manner in which Elena's

allegations were handled, and the manner in which this

Committee's attempts to investigate those allegations

have been frustatred. 1147/

In 1965 Elena Garro reported that Silvia Duran

had been Oswald's mistress while he was in Mexico City. 1148/

In 1967 this report was confirmed by a CIA agent who

talked to Silvia Duran. 1149/ The CIA Station did not.

tion is accurate,

then that Silvia invited Oswald to

a party would not have been surprising. Silvia Duran

admitted that the Mexican police had questioned her on

this point but denied that she had had an affair with

Oswald. 1151/ Ms.

Duran denied having any extra-marital

affairs while she was married to Horacio Duran. 1152/

This denial is not consistent with evidence of her reputa-

tion at the Cuban Consulate. A CIA penetration agent

there reported to his case officer that all that would

have to be done to recruit Silvia Duran, whom he referred

to by using the spanish word for whore, would be to get

a blond blue-eyed American into bed with her. 1153/

There is also CIA information that indicates that Silvia

Duran had an affair with a Cuban Ambassador to Mexico

in the early 1960's. 11544

The HSCA attempted to interview the CIA penetra-

tion agent about Ms. Duran. 1155/ An interview with the

agent was also desired so as to attempt to verify whether

Elena Garro had created a disturbance at the Cuban Embassy.

October 13, 1966. 1158/ Ms. Garro claimed that she had

been held there by Manuel Calvillo whom she believed

worked for the Mexican Ministry of Government. 1159/

In 1963, Mr. Calvillo was an unwitting asset of the Central

Intelligence Agency. 1160/ Ms. Garro claimed that she

told Mr. Calvillo her story on November 23, 1963. 1161/

Yet

the CIA Mexico City Station did not receive a report

from Calvillo on this matter until November 24, 1964, the

same day that Elena first told her story to American of-

ficials. 1162/ For these reasons it was felt that

Manuel Calvillo could well be a key to determining the

veracity of Ms. Garro's story. The Committee's attempt

to interview Mr. Calvillo were also frustrated.

There is also circumstantial corroboration of Ms.

Garro's allegations regarding June Cobb Sharp. For exam-

ple, Ms. Cobb was indeed a CIA agent and she did file

the first report of Ms. Garro's story. 1164/ It should

be noted that this first report was accurate in its detail

in that Ms. Garro's story remained essentially the same

in subsequent repetitions. Ms. Garro claimed that she

kicked Ms. Cobb out of her house. 1165/ There is a nota-

access to Ms. Garro. 1166/ The Committee attempted to

obtain an interview with Ms. Cobb, but was once again

frustated. 1167/

Reviewing the manner in which the CIA Mexico City

Station and the Legal Attache's office in Mexico City

handled Ms. Garro's allegations reveals that, at best,

her allegations were handled in an irresponsible manner

because they were dismissed after a superficial investi-

gation. The first report that came to the ClA was mis-

filed and forgotten. 1168/ The Legat, after talking to

Elena, dismissed her story after interviewing one person

whom she said may have been at the party. 1169/ The

manner in which the official American community handled

Charles Thomas' reporting is detailed in Section VI, C,

11, above.

Mr. Thomas speculated in 1969 about why Ms.

Garro's story had been largely ignored by the American

officials

in Mexico:

It would appear that whereas the FBI has

discounted the Elena

Garro allegations.

the CIA is still considerable disturbec

by them.

The CIA may not have pressed for

further investigation, however, for a num-

ber of reasons: 1) considering

the sensi-

tive overlap and subtle competition between

two intelligence collecting

agencies, it

had to yield to the FBI's clear jurisdic-

some of the people appearing in

Under the circumstances it

is unlikely that any further investiga-

The Committee attempted to locate Elena Garro.

Although the Committee established telephonic contact

with Ms. Garro, the Committee was totally frustrated

in this aspect of its investigation, but yet believes

that there is a possibility that Lee Harvey Oswald did

attend a twist party at the home of Ruben Duran.

The Committee also considers it possible that

Lee Harvey Oswald contacted pro-Castro students at the

National Autonomous University of Mexico (Universidad

Nacional Autonoma de Mexico, hereinafter UNAM) as claimed

by Oscar Contreras Lartigue. 1172/ Silvia Duran admitted

that she had told Oswald of two ways in which he could

get a Cuban visa: 1) he could get an intransit visa by

first obtaining a visa to another Communist country such

as Russia; 2) he could obtain a regular Cuban visa by

knowing someone in Cuba who would vouch for him. 1173/

is a possibility that Ernesto Leffeld Miller,

Gary Cornwell, Dan Hardway, Edwin Lopez and Harold Leap

arrived at the

Mexico City airport at 8:30 p.m., May

30, 1978. (All times are Mexico City times, unless

otherwise specified.) They were met and escorted through

Customs by David Patton, an employee of the United

The following morning, May. 31, 1978 the HSCA

representatives met with U.S. Embassy Political Officer

Richard Howard concerning procedure. Mr. Howard sche-

Station in Mexico City. This meeting was preliminary

in nature and concerned procedures regarding arrangement

of the interviews of ex-CIA employees in Mexico.

At 12:00 noon, the HSCA representatives and Richard

Howard met representatives of the Government of Mexico.

The Mexican representatives were: 1) Dr. Jesus Yanes,

Advisor to the Attorney General's Executive Officer;

2) Fernando Baeza, Chief Administrative Officer for the

cussed at this meeting.

The Mexican government decided that the initial

interview

would be an informal contact with the witnesses

in which the Committee's objectives would be described.

The witnesses' statements would be formalized at a later,

taped interview. The Mexican officials informed the

HSCA staff members that they had been unable to locate

Oscar Contreras, 1193/ Elena Garro de Paz, and Elenita

Garro de Paz. 1194/ The Mexican Government had not had

contact with the Garros since 1968. The Mexicans said

that they were trying to locate the Garros through

the Foreign Ministry since Elena's ex-husband, Octavio

Paz, had once been

an important person in that ministry.

The Mexicans asked that we determine the name of the

were conducted by Gary Cornwell. HSCA staff members

Dan Hardway, Edwin Lopez and Harold Leap were present

during Cornwell's questioning. The Mexican Government

was represented by Dr. Jesus Yañes, Commandante Floren-

and Jesus Meixueiro Kanty, second in com-

viewed at 2:30 p.m. Ruben Duran was

Silvia Duran was interviewed at 6:15 p.m.

At 9:30 a.m. on June l, 1978, the HSCA staff re-

The Mexican representatives informed the HSCA

staff that Victor Rico Galan had, at one time, been

arrested on political charges but that he was subse-

quently pardoned by either Diaz Ordaz or Luis Eche-

varria. 1199/ The Mexicans said that they were search-

ing for all files and newspaper articles requested

• by the HSCA.

The Mexican officials also offered their obser-

vations orally on the preliminary interviews conducted

the previous day. They pointed out that they found it

strange that Silvia had told Oswald he could not travel

while in Cuba. They wondered what Duran was trying to

tell Oswald and whether she thought that Oswald had

some objective in going to Cuba other than that ascribed

by the popular version. They also considered the manner

in which Silvia obtained employment at the Cuban Consu-

late unusual. Generally they noted that Silvia and

her brothers seemed to have almost programmed responses

and a defensive demeanor. They pointed out, however,

that all the Durans had been very interested in talking

to us. In their opinion, Ruben Duran was the most

credible of those interviewed by the HSCA the previous

day.

At this point, a Mexican official who had been

checking the computer records informed us that Victor

Rico Galan had died.

HSCA staff members provided the Mexican authori-

the names of the Mexican officials who had

been involved in the investigation in 1963.

HSCA staff members met again with the Mexican po-

this time, the Mexican police provided the copies of the newspaper

clippings on the assassination of John F. Kennedy from the

Excelsior. HSCA staff members asked if the Mexicans

could persuade the newspapers to reveal the sources : :

of their stories about Oswald and Silvia Duran. The

Mexican officials' responsewas negative. The Mexican

officials informed

the HSCA staff members that most of

the data we wanted from the files was in their security

the HSCA explained that they were the Mexican equivalent

of the FBI and that the Security Service was the Mexican.

that Deba Garro could not be located; and that there

was no record of anyone named Eunice Odio. HSCA repre-

sentatives told the Mexican officials that odio, who

was either Costa Rican or Guatemalan, had been the

mistress of Emilio Carballido. The assassination

and the reaction of the Mexican people to it was

discussed.

At 1:00 p.m., HSCA staff members conducted an

interview at the United States Embassy in connection

with the CIA aspects of the Mexico City investigation.

At 2:30, Gary Cornwell discussed problems with

the Chief of the Mexico City CIA Station. He requested

that the COS cable Headquarters regarding restrictions

placed on the HSCA staff in Mexico.

At 6:00 p.m., the HSCA staff members, accompanied

by Jesus Meixuerio Kanty and his assistant, Honorio

Escondon, met with the assistant chief of the Mexican

Security

Service Nazar.

Mr. Nazar gave an oral resume

of the interviews which Mexican officials conducted in

1963 of Silvia, Horatio and Ruben Duran and Betty Serratos.

Mr. Nazar said that the files had to be formally re-

quested before he could consider releasing them. He

Mr. Nazar suggested that our best investi-

gatory avenue would be to concentrate on Oswald's inter-

rogation after his arrest on November 22nd. Mr. Nazar

had a very low opinion of Elena Garro de Paz' credibil-

ity. He felt that she confused fact and fiction.

June 3 and 4, 1978, were spent on CIA-related

aspects of the Mexico City investigation. Two inter-

views were conducted. All interviews, with the excep-

later transcribed.

Appendix 5: Biography: Elena Garro De Paz

Elena Garro de Paz was born of Spanish parents in

Puebla, Mexico on December 11, 1917. (All information in

this section

culled from Biography Data form prepared by

Charles Thomas.) Ms. Garro attended the National Autonomous

University of Mexico and later did graduate work at Berkley

in California

and at the University of Paris. In 1963,

Elena had long been married to Octavio Paz, a career

diplomat who is also one of Mexico's finest poets and leading

intellectuals. When Octavio was named Mexican Ambassador

to India, the couple separated by mutual consent. Elena's

daughter, also named Elena, has always resided with her

mother.

Since Elena spent seventeen years of her early life

in Europe she had a rather un-Mexican objectivity about her

native land and had a reputation for being one of its more

articulate detractors. At the same time, Elena was considered

emotionally committed to many aspects of Mexican life and

made an

important contribution to its artistic development

In the 1960's Elena became a significant writer.

Hogar Solido, El Rey Mago, La Senora en su Balcon, Ventura

Allende, Andaise por las, Ramas, Parada Empresa, and El Viaje

are plays that have had appreciative audiences in Europe,

where they were translated into German, as well as in Mexico.

Ms. Garro's short stories are collected in a volume called

La Semana de Colores. The Literacy Supplement of the London

Times has called her novel, Los Recuerdos de Porenir, "a

splendid success. " Critics have said of her: "For Elena

Garro, there is no frontier between

reality and fantasy;

in any case, the latter is a second reality--perhaps more

intense--to which one may penetrate without passport or

forewarning, thanks to the effectiveness of a literature

fired with passion, flavor and life." Many people who

knew Elena have asserted that the frontier between reality

and fantasy is also difficult for her to distinguish in

real

life. (Biography Data Form on Elena Garra de Paza

prepared by Charles Thomas.)

Ms. Garro, for many years, was an active worker in

arm of the Partido Reformista (PRI). Because Ms. Garro

was

a tireless propagandist and agitator on behalf of

the poorer Mexican peasants, she was on close personal

terms with and enjoyed the respect of peasant leaders

from all over the country. (Ibid.)

Elena was considered a witty, urbane and opinionated

woman with an unflagging sense of humor. Her forthright

opinions and

sharp wit tended on occasion to ruffle feathers

in Mexico, but her important social, literacy, and political

connections

rendered her fairly immune from serious cunter-

attack until 1968. Then, Ms. Garro was forced to flee the

country with

her daughter, Elenita and her sister, Deba

Guerrero de Galvan, in the midst of the student strikes.

The House Select Committee on Assassinations has been unable

to determine the exact reason Ms. Garro had for fleeing

Mexico.

Before her disappearance from Mexico, Elena was well

disposed toward the United States and had been friendly

with Embassy officers. Her broad range of significant
