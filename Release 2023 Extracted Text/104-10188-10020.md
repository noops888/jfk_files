De appreciate the detailed progreas report on KDAFGHAN

gubaitted by reference.

The complote description of KDAFGILN

personnel,

working routine, facilitles and equipuent was very

belpful in understanding how this project functions.

Regarding your request for WACRE advice and guidance

on hot-alking the lines running into the gatehouse and consulate,

we have discussed this possible operation with FOACRE bere who

First, to accouplish a hot-mike

installation, you must be able to get accegs to the telephone

If you can gain access to the phone lines, It would be

possible to hot-aike the telephone without getting to the instru-

ment Itself. ' However, a non-access system like this will not

work if the target line goes through a switchboard or it there

are multiple telephone lines going into the same instrument.

description of the embassy teleptone systen,

Babed appent to rule out a hot-sike operation unless you can tand

and gain access to a single line that does not so through a switch-

Any such operation, it one is proposed,

unilateral because the non-access system i8 not for exposure to

It 1a possible that your interests in this operation

could be served equally well by an audio penetration of the

gatehouse.

Such & penetration could be nade by a carry-in

"quick plant" type

Perhaps one of your agents who

regularly vis1to

or you could exploit KDTUCK-4's close friendship with

KDACCUSTIC-11 to get a transmitter into the target.

Operatloual Activities:

This Project continued as belore

for the major

portion of this period with KDAFGHAN providing photo

coverage for cight how's per day, five days per wook, of the AMFINK

installation.

In April the principal agent, KDAFGHAt-l, was plovided

photographic equipment to improve the quality of the take.

Tuls later proved unuseable

as sunlight playing on the mirror of

the lens was plainly

visible from the target arca in the afternoons.

The Aront returned to the use of his old equipment. It being the

current Case Officer's practice to hold nearly all noctings with

this Agent in the. Case Officer's auto about once every two weeks we

decided to terminate the KDAFGHAN safehouse as unnecessary.

KDAFGHAN-1 was notified of this in carly June and nearly collapsed.

The salchouse had been his refuge from the Op and his mother, .

KDAFGHAN-2. We intonded to put him on vacation when it was decided

(References B and C) to torminate him and his Project.

portion of this poriod was then spent in closing down the operation,

s'emoving equipment fion the op, restoring the OP to its original

condition and then assisting the Agents in their preparations for

resettling to Madrid.

All of this was tinally accomplished by

31 July and the Agents were formally teiminated on 1 August.

came as a severe shock to both; they were not prepared for it.

They have adapted fairly well and now are looking forward to

their new lifo in Spain. They intend to depart Mexico for Madrid

on 1 September.

Costs exceeded the programmed

• amount becauso of the large sevcrance pay paid both agents who had

over ten ycars scivice

each.

KDAFGHAN-1 was paid U.S. $8,170.00

and KDAFGHAN-2 was paid U.S. $2,228.48.

6.

Plans: We have no plans to replace KDAFGHAN with another

strictly photo-surveillance projcct.

The production does not

Justify the cost.

However, we do have plans to obtain a multi-

purpose baschouse in the arca that can serve as a site for taking

photos when necessat's,

The PBRUMEN section has. already started the

The acquisttion of the lalter will be the most difficult as

Onc. item that becomos evident when reviering KDAFGHAN

files is his repeated failure (with some few

exceptions) to get photographs of suspects or agents

that the Station knows visited ANFINK while he was

purportedly. on watch.

Given the above the Station decided to mount an operation

designed to determine once and for all if the KDAFGHANS were

either under control by AMSTAFF or if their activities were bein

monitored by audio coverage of the Safchouse or OP site.

DCOS designed

a sophisticated sconario to be played out by the

Case Officer which would; onc by

the above possibilities.

Other Operational Developments: Other than the above,

the opcration continued

The Case Officer had another

dawn to midnight stay with the Agent to observe AMFINK and its

activities and to wörk with the Agent on Improving his production.

Quality of the photographs has improved and identification of the

KDAFGIAN-1 and 2 are so set in the

This is being overcome.

event of the period was our obtaining a photo of SYCEMENI-G's

and the positive offorts being taken to improve its' security.

while the positive rosults of DaFGuu-l's soswIRl (per Reference

AYSTAFF against BNTRUST, his PBRUMEN oxile status, the long period

of time he has been operating his OP site in close proximity to

the PBRUMEN Embassy and the potential (perhaps immediato) danger

presented by his and NDAFGILAN-2'S PBRUMEN relatives, make it cloar

that this tear must eventually be phased out, whether or not

the Station's attempts to prevent KDAFGIlAN-1 and 2 from reaching

the conclusion that they are no longer trusted by uKTRUST.

Station has indicated, an overlap between the new and old OP

is highly desirable.

Fresumably, the Station will continue its

efforts to determine whether or not KDAFGHAN-1 has been "doubied"

While reviewing this activity, we vere struct by

the thöught which has occurred to others in the rast

to why khArchas-1, an educated and reportedly intelligent

individual, has been villing to devote the last ten years

to this dull and very routine effort.

It is intricult to

draw a completely satistying answer

to this question from

the files.

The security aspects aside, the Station is

probably doing NDAFGiuld-l a favor.

health, by forcing him to look outside his small and

insular world and

seek a new form of employnent.

frequent references to KUAFGILAN-l's pent up nervousness

contained in the Station's reporting indicates that...

KUAFGILAN-1's obsession with his work may finally be catch-

ing up with him.

3:

While we are more than a little ambivalent concern-

ing

the ovor-all value of this activity as presently consti

tutou, given tho priority need for coverage of the ANSTAFF

personnel stationed at the PBRUMEN Embassy and the relative

dearth of PBRUMEN target access agcuts, we believe that this

activity should be continued.

He share the Station's concorn

abour our inability to identify the photographs of non;

PBRUMEN personnel who visit the Embassy or Consulate, but

appreciate the difficult technical problems involved.

more positive note, the recent group of photographs of

PBRUMEN Embassy staffers forwarded to Headquarters for review

by AMBEDEW-1 and AMWIiEN=1 (the latter has

not yet been

completed)

were of high quality.

As a result of the high

quality of these photographs, ANBEDEN-1 was able to identity

Ne assume

from

the contents of Reference C that when and if a new OP

site toam has been recruited and a new site chaines,

eiroris will be made by the Station to increase the identifi-

cation of visitors to the PBRUNEN installation concerned.

Meanwhile, the high rate of identification of PBRUVEN visitors

to the Embassy

currently being achieved by the Station

testifies

to your determined efforts to obtain the maxinum "tale" from

this operation.

In conclusion, we concur with the Station's plans

to continue this operation and to improve the identification

that he is

coming by at a cortain time - or he will be called and told to

with the plotographs he takes he could make many identifications

which,

in turn, could be exploited by other station assets,

KDGLACIER, OF LNERGO,

Even of more assistance would be the "hot

miking"

of these lines. That way we could not only identify any

caller

to the Consulate or satchouse, but also who the gatekeeper

calls inside to announce the visitor.

In addition, we would also

cxpect to pick up quite a bit of conversation of interest, for the

gatchouse seems

to be a favorite hangout in the Embassy for DGI

personnel: KDAFGHANS 1 and 2, being experienced LP operators,

could casily handle the. take. KDAFGHAw-l, being fluent in English,

could also handle the English language portions of any take -

which in view of the number of English-speaking visitor's would

probably be considerable.

Therefore, we request that we he advised what lechnical

necessary foy WOACRE to determine the feasibility

of a hot mike installation into the gatehouse and Consulate

(assuming no access to the instruments) scrviced by an LP located

in the current "KDAFGHAN' OP.

the possibility of tapping one of the gatehouse telephones

currently monitored by KDBADGER and running it into the KAFGHAN

Op where it will not only be transcribed but live monitored.

KUAFGHAN provided an average of 600 contact prints and

To improve security,

Use of the safehouse is now held

to a minimum and wherever possible meetings are by car pickup.

EXPANDED COVERAGE

1.

During Ostober, the C/TECH at the Station entered the

KDAFGHAN Baschouse,

and

installed a Ti-monitor and Robot camoir.

Essentially tho new

set-up was to expand KDAFGHAN-l's coverage

to include the Consulate.

in addition to the Embayyy front gate.

The equipment was so placed that while watching the 'front gato,

KDAFGHAY-1 could look

through a monitor at tho front gate of tho

Consulate and if he saw. someone of

possible interest he pushed

a button and a picture was snapped:

At the same time, he

monitored the

tont gate and

took pictures and kept his log.

This double coverage

was retained only for one month.

The

Station found that the take was marginal becauso there was no

accompanying log, and no way of identirying any of the persons

pictures vero being taken.

The current arrangement is

that if the Station has an operational need for checking whether

a particular poison visits the Consulale, we notify KDAFGHAN-1

in advance, providing him a photograph andor physical description

and then at the designated time he personally monitors the

Consulate gate, whitle KDAFGHAN-2 handles the camera on the main

gate and 105.

This rarely occurs.

We expect even moro traffic

through the Consulate now that within the past two weeks the

Cultural Attacho's office has

again been moved to the socond

f100%' of the Corsulate:

Everyone soliciting propaganda,

and other types of information on PBRUNES will be entering

through the Consulate. There has been no further notion taken

with regard to tying audio coverage at the front satc into the

KDAFGHAY Baschouse so that KDAFGIAN-1 might be in a better

position to identify the persons going in and out of the Enbassy.

This is still a primary objective aimed ar improvingthe

KDAFGHAN end product.

PRODUCTION

5. The KDAFGHAN production has remained virtually constant.

The main value of the production has been to

establish a pattern

of vartous employees, identify their autosoviles,

photographs.

Photographs of vistting PBRUNEY officials have

also been

of value occasionally when Headquarters is trying to

make a positive identification.

IMPNOTING COVERAGE

3.

The lull potential of the LIONIOY-1 operation is

hampered by the lack of an audio installation at the LIRING

fatehouse covered by the LiOtIONed and 2 observation post.

An audio installation would serve,

in most cases,

to identtfy

the individuals who are photographed by LIONION-1 since the;

normally

identify. themselves

•to

the gatchouse attendant.

Tho

Station is.constahtly. examining the possibility of an audio

installation

at this point.

There aic a number of Station assets

who have occasional

access to the gatehouse,

and it is conceivable

that one of them

could place a quick plant

device, provided

security

conditions are favorable:

The Station assets who visit

the LIRING complex

approximately once a weck

ale:

LIRELIC-1;

LITAINT-2; LIHACK-4 and to a lesser

extent LIBANGLE-1.

of this

gOUP, LITAINT-2 appears to have gained the confidence among

LIRING personnel, for

whom he has provided services

and purchased

with-Station assistance, clothing and other items outside Mexiço.

prior. to making any

installatiou, Station will submit an opera-

tional plan for Headquarters approval.

Station is also installing

a TV camera monitor in the LIONION basehouse to cover the LIRiNG

consulate.

• The installation will be coordinated with a robot!

photo camera so that photos can be taken of persons whom LIONION-1

determines to be of Station interest.

PRODUCTION

The LIONION production has remained virtually constant

since the primary objectives

of the installation seldom change.

Except for specific individuals,

as in the case of AVDIME-1,

the general production material

is similar

to the contents

of

paragraph

4 of Reference.

In view of this it would be redundant

to repeat the entire paragraph.

COVER AND SECURITY

5. There were

no seculity

problems in the LIONION operation

the period of this report.

The Case Officer visited thei

basehouse once during the hours

of darkness.

As reported pre-

viously: meetings with LIONION-l are held in his safehouse,

which is in another section of Mexico City.

The question

ANCHAMPAGNE-l's debriefing and the "vieja"

the LIRING personnel

ANCHAMPAGNE-1 about is being covered in separate dispatch

IMMA 39604.

FINAYCES

There were no changes in the projected LIONION expendi-

tures reported in the paragraphs, under FINANCES, in Reference

dispatch.

PLANS

The objectives outlined in paragraph 8,

Refelence,

continue in effect.

Station is going ahead in the installation

of the TY monitoring system

After a trial period of about

one: month, the results of this new coverage will be analyzed

ordor to determine the value of the information already collected,

and whether this additional coveraje is worth the effort and the

PRODUCTION

4. The LIONION Prodiction for the reporting period, 1

February through 31 May 1970,

consisted almost entirely of photo-

graphic coverage of visitors

to the LIKING main entrance and logs

of movement

of LIRING personnel and visitors.

This proved very

useful in identifying new LIRING PCS employees in Mexico, obtaining

photographs of them, and taking up-to-date photos of other

employees.

This nonitoring also revealed which cars the various

employees usually drive, and the license plates of each.

Based

On LIOSION'S log some information was obtained on the pattern of

these employees. This latter information is limited since the

employces often arrive and depart at different hours and often

switch cars.

When this happens at dusk or evenings, it is impos-

sible to identify the driver or passenyer.

LIONION-1 also took pictures of that appeal to be American

The Station utilized LIONION-1 photographic coverage and his

log to check on the reports of Station assets who claim to visit

In the case of some assets LIUSIOY-l was given a photo-

graph of the agent and told to be particularly alert at certain

times of certain days to confirm the agent's entry, exit, etc.

This proved particularly useful in checking AVDIME-l's story of

contact with LIRING

and confirmed LIRaLIC-l's visits to LIRING

at an early stage in our recontact with LIRELIC-l:

As reported in the last Progress Report (HNMA-3SASS), the

Station paid LIONIOY-1 $250.00 USD in January 1970 to cover the

unexpected medical expenses of LIOSION-?.

This sum had originally

been intended as the second of two installrents to compensate

L109101-1 for cutting 'his long overdue vacation trip to europe

from one month to two wecks in

early summer of 1969.

Reinstate-

mint of this. payment in the Fl-7l budget is requested (and is

actually in lieu of a salary increase).

PLAYS

8.

As discussed above,

the Station plans to continue using

the LIONIO! Base as a collection point for background information

on LIRING and its employees, to assist the Section in talget

analysis work.

The Station is trying to collect Information on

six major target personnel (i.e. LIRING officers), and in order

to properly assess the personnel selected, and try to recruit and

run access agents against them, additional information is needed

on their pattein of activity,

friends, contacts, work habits, etc.

It 18 hoped that LIONION-1 will be able to make

& worthwhile con-

tribution to this effort.

At the same

time, he will be asked to

remain alert for any visitors of possible

interest (Americans,

students, etc.).. The next step in the Station's over-all plan

be to assess LIONION-l's ability to observe and draw appropriate

conclusions from his observations, and write these up for the

Station.

The Station will also try to find some fornula for per-

mitting

LIOVION-1 and 2 to continue photographic coverage, but

perhaps

on a nore limited basis than in the past, and at the same

time continue their target analysis work.

Although

not planned for the immediate future and dependent

_on the need foi Consulate coverage,

the Station still may wish

install a TV monitoring system

on the Consulate as well as

live,

manual camera coverage of the main entrance.

This feature

was discussed in the previous LIONION operational report.

LIoNtox-1 would live-mondtor this line and use ll to aid in

identllying LikiNG risitors.

Based on prior experience with

the LISAMPAN/DOG: It Is known that LIRING vialtors are frequently

announced by telephone lo LiRio officers Inside.

For security

reasons, we do not wish to tip the line from the street box and

run it directly to de blorio% LP, but ve are presently deter-

mining the leastbility of tapping the line from

the contral

runningit from there to the Lp.

The risk in this

case is considerably. reduced since there is no direct connection

between LIRING and LIONION-1, and LIFENT experience has deter-

mined that any phonc company employce who discovers the well

disguised tap

will. think It was done by

the Mexican Government,

and will not report it to anyone.

Further Information on this

matter will be forwarded upon completion of the casing by

LIFEUD-2.

Routine telephone company repairs in the area of the

LP have delayed the castig of the area, but this will be done

once repairs aro completed.

PRODUCTION

As reported abovo, the Station was serlously hindered

in Identifying LIRING visitors during the roporting period due

to the absence of audio as a complement to the LIUNiON photogra

phic product.

Thus there was little development of information

regarding new visitors to LiRIsG. Utilization of the LIONION

product during the reporting period was primarily confined to

confirming whether or not LIRIG officials were at LIRING when

their presence wis reported olse here. LIONION-1 verified that

LITAINT-2 did visit LIRING at the time when he reported having

a conversation with LIRING-2 and LIOVIO-l verified that they

loft LIRING at the hour stated by LITAINT-2.

LIMACK-8 waS

subsequently able to verily their arrival at LIRING-2's residenco.

LiONIOr-I was querled regarding the presence or

absence of LIRING-25 In response to certain reports

liad returned to Noxico City.

LIONION-1 reported that he hid

not seen LIRING-25 for about si% weeks.

LIONION product

was further hindered by the absence.of any full-

time Intelligence Assistant for the Station PBRUMEN Section

during most of the reporting.period.

There was,

thus, no one

to analyze the weekly product, or resolve possible leads to the

identity of LIRING visitors.

Paragraphs 8 and 9 below discuss

current efforts to make better use of this product.

SECURITY

6.

There were no developments affecting the security of

the LIONION operation during the reporting period.

FINANCES

During the reporting period, routine LIONION expendi-

tures

amounted to $1, 711.85 USD.

No additional expenditures

were made.

PLANS

In addition to the audio coverage discussed in para-

graph 4 above, the Station is also considering the installation

of closed circuit television coverage of the LIRING Consulate,

previously covered by the pulse camera..

LIOVION-2. remained at the Listening Post during the entire

period in order not to leave the basehouse equipment unguarded.

Ercept for the

lack of coverage during these two weeks, ithere

w'ele

no significant changes in the photographic coverage of

LIRING during the reporting period.

4.

AUdiO - LISANPAN/ DOG.

As reported in paragraph D2

of reference, LiOVION-1 live-monitored the LISANPAN/DOG

traffic from 0800 to: 1730 lour's daily.

When he left for

Europe on A day 1969.

the carrier current transmission of this

traffic from LISAMPAY/LISASH to the LIONIO!-1. basehouse was

discontinied.

It was decided to let LISAMP-l record various

portions of this

traffic during the two-week absence of

LIONION-1 foi

evaluation by Richard C. HABOUSH.

The purpose

was -to determine

whether continued recording by either

LISANPAN-1 or LIONION-1 would be merited by the Information

obtained.

As previously reported (MEXICO CITY-0191 and

HMA-37166), LISAMPAN DOG WaS loSt on either 6 or 7 May 1969. 7

4s a result, LIONIOr-T has received no audio since his return

from Europe

on 25 May 1969.

After the loss of LISANPAN/DOG,

the Station considered running a straight tap to the LIONION-1

baschouse,

but decided that the security risk

was

too great,

particularly in view of the fact that the target LIRING line

is already monitored by LIENVOY.

Miscellaneous.

During the Station's casing of the

residence of Chiet, LIRING in May and June 1969 to determine

tlie feasibility of mounting an audio operation against that

target, LIOVION-1 extended his coverage of the LIRING target

beyond his usual closing hour of 1730 until 0130.

The purpose

of this extended

to monitor the activities of

certain LIRING personnel and establish their routine pattern

of activity in preparation for a possible entry into Chier,

LIRING's residence.

This casing was discontinued

on 4 Juné

when it was determined that the residence was under apparent

sulveillance.

The duration

of the extended coverage

by LIOYION-1 was not long enough to

establish the regular

the targed LIRING staiters.

PRODUCTION

6. Photographic.

In lino with the station's desire to stress

quiiiy over quantity, the statistical breakdown

Hot the LONION photographic production has been

discontinued.

Production during May dropped notice-

ably due to LIONIOS-l's Auropean vacation.

graphic production is usually gicatost on the days

ol flights arriving from PBRUNEN.

b...

The Station Is unaware of the use made by

Headquarters of the film from the pulse camera which

Is' regularly forwarded by the Station.

While the

cost of this operation is minimal, and it requires

onlyn limited expenditure of time on the part of:

LIONION-1 and Station personnel, the presence of the

pulso camera itself is a problem...As Headquarters.

is aware,

it is largo and difficult to disassemble.

Subsequent to the loss of LISAMPAN audio operations,

the Siation removed all audio equipment and associated |

WOACRE material from the LIONION-1 busehouse,

leaving

him only with commercial photographic equipment.

The one exception to

this is the pulse camera.

The

Station would appreciate Headquarters' comments on'

the use and value of the take from the pulse camera.

SECURITY

7.

The only incident during the recording period

which

had a bearing on the security of the LIONION operation.

was

the loss of LISAMPAN/ DOG.

As far as the Station can determine,

the carrier current transmitter was not in operation at lthe

time the countermeasure sweeps were being conducted in the

vicinity of DOG.

Since this was the only connection between

LIONION and LISAMPAN,

the Station does not feel that LIONION

could have been compromised.'The entire question of the damage

resulting from the loss of the LISAMPAN operations is under

study and will shortly be the subject of a separate dispatch.

FINANCES

8.

During the reporting period, routine LIONION expend-

itures

amounted to $22,701.00 AN (US$1, 816.08).

In addition,

LIONION-1 was given a gift of US$250.00 prior

to his departure

for Europe on 4 May.

Since LIONION-l's l'equest for five

weeks leave.could not be approved for operational reasons,

he was given the gift to help finance the air fare for a

second trip to Europe in a year ci so if he wants to complete

his original plans.

PLANS

The Station does not anticipate any significant

changes in LIONION operations

for the next quarter.

BACKGROUND

LIONION provides WOFIRM with a fixed photographic survoillance

capability of LIRING, a base for the radio dispatch of the LIEMBRACE

Survoillance Team, and a Listening Post (LP) for LISAMPAN/DOG and

BAKER.

The baschouse is manned by LIONION-1 and LIONION-2, both

1ully qualified to handle all of the equipment ingtalled in the site.

The

bility to identily visitors to LIRING (through live monitoring) and

thus affix names

to photographs he takes.

Previously, the identifi-

cation of visitors to LIRING required considerable time and effort

but in the short period of LIONION's audio capability this effort

has decreased

measurably.

HMMA-32502, 12 July 1967

1. PROJECT BACKGROUND AND REPORTING

Project LIONION Is a long-term operational support project designed

to provide fixed photographic,

technical,

and physical survcillance of

Lie PBRUMEN Embassy and Consulate in Mexico City.

objective is to provide for a mechanism which

can fulfill various

miscellaneous PBRUMEN support type requirements.

The LIONION base-

house; which scives as the photographic base, an L/P and provides n

radio-dispatching base for the LLEMBRACE surveillance team, continues

to be manned by LIONION-1 and LIONION-2.

The last regularly scheduled

LIONION progress ieport, covering the perlod 1 Aprii through 30 June

1967, was forwarded in reference.

2. AGENT CONTACT AND PERFORMINCE

During the period under review,

LIONION-] was seen 18 times and

LIONION-2

on four occasions in regular operational meetings.

Meetings

were hold in the LIOVION safehouse,

in the Casc Officer's home after

dark, in restaurants or in moving vehicles after street-corner pick-

ups.

Other than the intentional rotation of

meeting sites and times;

no changes were made in the LIONION conmunications systens.

As noted in reference, LIOYION-1 was hospitalized for emergency

sulgery to treat a perforated ulcer

on 27 Juns.

LIONION-l did not

renover sufficiently to provide fulltime coverage until mid-July, a

fact, given his conscientious nature, lowered his morale slightly.

Horever, after returning to fulltime work and receiving assurances

from the Case Officer,

LIONION-1 perked-up considerably.

Since that

time, LIONION-1 has pericimed in the exemplary manner which the sta-

tion has come to expect of him.

Other than cited above,

there have

been no agent handling, control, or morale problems daring the report-

ing period.

3. AGENT PERFORMANCE: AND MORALE

Not withstanding the boring and difficuit nature of rais

operational assignment, LIONIOi-l continues to purform in in

Sinjec' lò indrei i jigniy mutivaled ageat

as indicated by his willingness to perforn this rather menial

task day after day, when, with bis educational backeround be

undoutedly could obtain more interesting and more lucratire

employment:

"" order to alleriate the morale problems cited in

paragraph 7.of reference,

the Station agsisted LIONION-1 in the

purchase of a new ongine for his vehiclo.

This unexpected gesture

was greatly appreciated by LIONION-1 and an immediate change for

the better in Subject's frame of mind was noted.

4.

ACCOMPLISHMENTS

(a)

Throughout the period under review, ProJect LIONIay

continued to provide the Station with the invaluable photographic

coverage of the targets.

In addition, LIONION-l continued to

provide interesting observations on the personalities and activ-

ites of the persunnel working in the target.

After years of

observation, LIONION-l can virtually tell the framo of mind and

disposition of the regular inhabitants.

LIONION-l's obserrationg

on the Subject of reference (B)

were most valuable to the Station

in the planning of the recruitment of this individual.

In

addition, LIONION-1 provided radio dispatching support during

this recruitment operation; without which, the attempt would

have been virtually

impossible.

(b)

Statistically, LIONION-1 provided approximately 1600

individual photographs

of persons entering and leaving tec

target limbassy (which he printed and developed himself) and

approximately 2100 feet of film coverage of the Consulate.

(c) There wore no intelligence disseminations fron this

operation during the

reporting period, since as previously

described Project LIONION

primarily a support type operation..

(d) Details have previously been submitted to Headquarters

concerning LIONION-l's support in the AMBRATLE operation.

5. PLANS

As noted in paragraph 14 of reference (A), Station plans to

utilize LIONION-1 and LIONION-2 as L/P operators in support of

the LISANPAN operation. Other than this, there are no significant

operational or administrative changus planned for the ensuring

To date 1-3 has paid the

= 1.

During tlie second quarter.of 1965 (the perlod covered by this

report) che LIONION operation experienced some technical difficulties which

have not been solved to date.

Normal coverage of the target was obtained

throughout the month of April with the expogure of some 600 feet of film by

the pulse camera and 28 rollo of 36-expoaure Ir1-X by the Pentax/Balecope

inscallation.

Normal coverage contlnued until 27 tay at wilch tlne the pulse

camera becano Inoperative owing. to a burned-out delve motor.

Tha camera was

removed and forwarded. to Headquarters for necessary repalre and a Pentox with

a 180 mm telephoco lens was rigaed as a temporary aubstitute for coverage of

the Consulate entrance.

On 16 June a reconditioned pulsa camera was recelved

and Immedlately placed in service. Unfortunately, this undt failed on 27 June

and was renoved. A faulty shutter motor was to blame. Thie camera was aldo

forwarded to Headquarters for repair and the Pentax/180 mm rig was again set

up. This r18 l8 being operated by LIONION-?.

Morale of boch agenta continues high, expeclally in view of the

excellerit service Headquartern performed in "Isaulng" new PBRUMEN passporta

for these agents.

Both were antounded to see their own signatures expertly

forged in the new documents.
