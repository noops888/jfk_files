COUNTERINTELLIGENCE OPERATIONS

Talk to be given at an OSI Intelligence Collection Seminar 8o

be heldion 22 and:23 February 1971.

Yesterday and today you have held discussions on the intélligence

collection process, targetting, and exploitation. Ta this hour long diss

cugelon of counterintelligence, I am going to continue shas process. I

am going to tall about intelligence collection, the process of targetting.

and the procees of exploitation. However, in contrast to the other

speakers in the seminar, I am going. to discuss you as a target.

for most of us serving in the Directorate of Science and Tech-

nology or the Directorate of Intelligence, security on a daily basis

consists of showing your badge to the man at the door and making sure.

that your safe is closed at night. During the day we associate with our

colleagues who wear badges to testily to the fact they have been cleared.

Outsiders who come into view also wear badges indicating that they too

have been cleared. Thus wrapped in this cloak provided us by security,

few of us give much thought to the fact that a major power " ith endless

funde considers the United States and in particular the Central Intelli-

gence Agency to be the "main enemy, the primary adversary, the

prime target. " There le documentary proof of this. I can jo on to

say that in this age of sechnology where, in my view, the United States

has no equal, the Directorate of Science and Technology and lls offices

such a's the Office of Scientific Intelligence rate pretty high on the

priority list of targeto. It has to -- look al the publicity -- and look

at: thé fact that as ao many of you know, the Soviet technological gap

is something the Soviete are trying to close fast. Interestingly

enougb, the KGB S&T elfort has expanded in roughly the same time

frame as DDS&T. Before 1956, there were small S&T sections which

were part of geographic area divisions. Aböut 1956/57, these Isolated

sclentific units were consolidated into an S&T department and in 1963,

the department was upgraded into a full fledged directorate. Ad far

as overseas representation is concerned, the USSR has 41 slots. in

IAEA. Iwenty percent of these are occupied by KGB S&T case officero.

O.K., so you never heard of any Russians snooping around OSI

Don't you believe it. Let us for a

moment pretend that we are KGB or GRU operations officers and that

we wish to penetrate OSI. How do we go about it? Do we send one of

our nice Soviet lads to call? Do we use a case officer from one of the

Eastern European satellites? Just for an idea of the magnitude of

the known resources available lo us as KGS dificers, consider that

in 1969 there were more than 21, 000 Soviet citizeng resident in some

77 non-Communist countries. Of lese almost air thousard were

official Soviets and sixty percent or 3,560 of these official Sorlets

were intelligence officers. Putting this in local terms, there are 100

Soviets officially listed as diplomats al the Embagsy kère in Hashing-

ton. It would be möre than prudent to assume that at least 60 of these

people are Soviet intelligence officers. In addition to this formidable

array to which I have Just ailuded, the seven Eastern European Commus

' Diet countries have among them nineteen different intelligence services.

Adding to the Washlngton contingeat from these services brings our

number tip to about 100. Bloc intelligence officers. Ah, but you day

the FBl watches them. Do they? Consider the atatiaties. Assuming

a 3 man aurveillance team, which is far too few for a good surveillance

operation, 24 hour per day coverage of thesé people would on the basia

of 3. eight hour shifts require 900 people in the street seven days per

week. With these figures, you are talking about some 20% of the

entire FbI stall of agents just to handle thia small piece of lbe pro-.

blem. Nevertheless, If all we had to worry about were these 100 Bloc

agents in Washington, we could rest easy. At the moment for example.

Let's adourne that we have been auccessful in keeping any hol

agent off the payrull. Vibad do they do next? Who else comes into the

ClA Headquartern building?

•I found out socently, lo my great surprise,

¡bat there are 100, 000 visitore to thia building in a year's time. But

let's get specllic, let's talk about.0s1..

Between Mugust 1970 and carly this month, OSI had 793 visitors..

Of this number, the bulk, or 454, were from other Government agencieo,

138 were contractore cleared by CIA, while the remülning 201 were

private inuividuals who either hold no clearances at all or hold some

kind of clearance from another Government agency:

Unfortunately, GIA is rather unique in spending the sloto, money

and manhours in clearing people. As you know, we have our own clear-

ance system and do not, rely on the checko of othere for our employees or

our constractors..

With other agencies, and particularly with the Departo

ment of Defense, with employees and coutractora in the millions the kind

of investigative checko we perform la ClA would run to the thousands of

people and the billions of dollars, and in all likelihood the whole defense

effort would grind to a screeching halt if they did.

Too often then an individual with a top secret clearance from

another agency le simply an Individual whose name, when checked

can tell you off the record that there are a number of individuals who

worked abroad on classifled projects for foreign governments for several

years who then returned to this country and promptly were granted top

secret clearances by U.S. agencies without a word asked.

With this the case it followó that some of these people may well

be working for someone besides Uncle Sam.

Along that line, I can also

say off the record that there were among those 793 OSI visitors In the

last six months people who were in fact working for someone besides

Uncle Sam.

Again, the foregoing is not calculated to make you into a suspi-

cious security officer type at all. Hopefully it will get you away from

the state

of mind where this sort of thing never occura to you. In

conclusion I have some specific suggestions to make which are not big

deal but which, ií implemented, can be of help to us all.

I you are dealing with people outside the Agency, or inside for

that matter, there is no need to tell them everything you know about

everything just because they are cleared. If they come to tali about

apples, stick to apples. Don't give them i gratis tour of the orchard.
