1. Arturs BROMBERGS was born on 31 August 1913 at Kandeva,
Latvia. BROMBERGS was once an officer in the Riga, Latvia Police
and during the German occupation in the early 1940's, he was mobilized
into the German controlled Latvian Legion. He fought against the Soviets
at Ostrov, deserted, and joined the Latvian resistance movement against
the Soviets in 1943. In 1945, he fled Latvia to Sweden and subsequently came
to the attention of this Agency in January 1951. He came, or was brought
to West Germany in early 1951, leaving his wife and daughter in Sweden,
and shortly thereafter was contracted by the Combined Soviet Operations 15-31
Base (CSOB) at Kaufbeuren for usage as a spotter and recruiter for Agency
directed operations to train and dispatch agents into the Soviet Union.
BROMBERGS' case officer in Munich, as of September 1951, was Edward
W. KNOWLES and during the same month, he was given a polygraph
examination by Donald D. TEDDING. Shortly thereafter, BROMBERGS
became involved in Agency opérations emanating from (KAUFBEUREN) 15-31
directed at agent penetration of the Soviet Union, and subsequently, as
will be detailed later, engaged in similar operations originating in the
Washington, D. C. area from the Domestic Operations Base of SR
Division. On 6 May 1954, BROMBERGS was himself dispatched into
the Soviet Union as an agent, and as of at least July 1957, was under KGB
control in the Soviet Union. Instant memorandum will not attempt to
examine the BROMBERGS case in any detail. The purpose of this memo-
randum is to identify certain Agency personnel, both Staff and Contract,

who did, or probably, had contact with BROMBERGS from January
1951 to May 1954. Inasmuch as BROMBERGS was apprehended and
sentenced to twenty-five years in prison by the Soviets, it is pre-
sumed that he was interrogated in detail by KGB officials concerning
his knowledge of Agency personalities, properties, and operations.
