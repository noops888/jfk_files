1.

He thought the attached roports vould be of interest to Incoln

Stall tron a soviet roalities standpoint. We also felt that they should

be brought to the attention of Ditialon mongement because the M.O. out -

lined therein 1s boconing & usjor factor 1n doallag with sourcos who have

contact vith sorblos nationals. It has been our experience that the type

of activity outlined has been on a miked Increase, particularly since

the establlahment of the KOB 10th Directorate. Although such activity

by sor logals 1s taking place throughout the continental U.3., undoubtedly

Its greatest impact la being selt in the lier lork and Hashingtos, D.C.

arcan because of the larga sortot doverment establisherute ln both of

these cittes. Por this sranon It rould seen imperative that both HAFO

and NYFO be extremely vigalant for such activity 1n compantes and 1nst1-

tutions with vaich thoy are doaling 1n ardor that it may be rocognized

11 1t8 carliest stages and appropriato CI/CE countermeasures Instituted.

In order to assist otbor offices in this respect, vo plan to volto in the

noar future an articlo for the DiTIBIOn Newsletter, outllning some of our

axpatiences along these lines.

2. No vere somerbat aisappointed in CI Start's reaction to our

rocont request for asBistance in defensive brleting of the subject of

one of the attached reporte. It seems to be quite clear now that ou

artednel assumption conceraing hia being R.I.S. targeted vas quite cortect

and that there l0 a strong likelleood that hle current trip behind th

Ictual recrultment attempt. He vonder in future cases of this nature

3. Judging by the attached material, It would appear that, despite

astabliahed Ball policy (dee our 16 May memorandum re Case 39,790), tbe

opposition:bas seen fit to deflover at least tro of Bell's scientifle

Migli. He pariously yonder at this point just son many other jel

poople uight. be in the sane boat. Perhaps, as a result of all this,

nome representation by Bell managanent to the KAB will be forthcoming,

spelling out to that organization, as vas spelled out to our on, estabi

linked company palley pertaining to such untters. In any evelit,

it would

appear that at least one or two Boll sclentists, and there are probably

nore, have been gluing the R.I. 8, more cooperation and reporting than the

Igoncy. Let's bope that 1n tiso dear future Bell managesent takes som
