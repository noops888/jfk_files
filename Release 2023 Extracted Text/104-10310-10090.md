1. Re question number 1 of reference: Attachment "A" contains

the names of Agency personnel who were in Mexico City, Mexico, during

the period 1 September 1963 through 31 December 1963 and who are still

on duty.

pe 1963 d

Attachment "B" contains the names of Agency personnel who

were in Mexico City during this same period but are now retired or no

longer on duty.

It is understood that these attachments will be

retained in the Headquarters building for use by the Committee Staff.

2. Re question number 3(a) of reference: For your background,

the Directorio Revolucionario Estudiantil (DRE) was a Cuban student

exile entity founded in September 1960 as an anti-Communist revolutionary

organization dedicated to the overthrow of the Castro regime.

The parent

organization of the DRE was the Directorio Revolucionario (DR), a revolu-

tionary organization of Cuban students opposed to the Batista regine

which actively joined the Castro forces by organizing a guerrilla move-

ment which contributed greatly to the collapse of the Batista regine.

The Castro government, themselves of student origin, recognized the DR

greas y es

power and by-passed them politically by forming the new regine without

directed. While the Agency had no role in the founding, the DRE was an

Pa the Agenco

The original DR becaue Communist controlled and

entity used by the CIA as a unilateral assèt in pursuing U.s. policy

objectives. CIA support to the DRE ceased on 30 September 1966 and formally

terminated on 1 January 1967. At that time DRE files were reviewed and

material dealing with CIA support and operations were either destroyed

or turned over the JMWAVE Station. The DRE was expected to continue as

an organizational entity and continue its activities independent of CIA.

3. The DRE files of both Station JWAVE and Headquarters that are

available have been reviewed and Lee Harvey Oswald's name does not appear

in these files. WAVE cable 8049 (in 66782) of 22 November 1963, states

in the third sentence, "according ASPELL files, Oswald", undoubtedly

refers to the DRE files maintained in the DRE office in Miami, Florida.

These entity files were independent of the JMWAVE Station files.

Station JIVAVE referred to its files in WAVE 8049 the cable would have

been worded, "according AMSPELL Station files." The file of A HINT-53,

a former executive of the DRE, has also been reviewed and no reference

to Oswald was found.

The file number which appears on WAVE 8049 is no

into Oswald's and other 201 files by the CI Staff.

Staff.

4. Re question number 3(b) of reference: We-have been unable-to-

determine 1f Station JWAVE was instructed to review its files for

information on Oswald. For many years the CI Staff has been the focal

point for the collation of any and all information concerning Oswald

and if the JWAVE files on any Cuban groups contained information on

Oswald such information

should be reflected in Oswald 201 file.
