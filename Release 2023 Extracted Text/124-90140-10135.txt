a. In January 1962 the Royal Canadian Mounted
Police reported that one Bernard Seymour MERGLER,
a self-employed Canadian lawyer, had come to their
attention because of his various activities in
connection with the Cuban government. He was
active in money raising efforts for the purpose
of purchasing medical supplies for hospitals in
Cuba; he was reported to be employed by the Cuban
government as one of its legal advisors; and he
had acted as counselor for a Cuban trade mission
visiting Canada. Subject was born on 13 May
1915 in Montreal, Quebec, and his home address
was reported as 4867 Cumberland Avenue, Montreal.
It was believed that Subject had traveled to
Cuba on or about 24 October 1961 for an undeter-
mined period.
b. On 20 February 1962 the same source
reported that Subject's above mentioned trip to
Cuba was to gather background information on a
case turned over to him by the Cuban government;
it involved difficulties encountered in the sale
of ships to Cuba by a Canadian firm. He
returned to Montreal from Cuba on 9 November
1961. Subject was further described as a general
consultant for the Cuban government in Canada.
