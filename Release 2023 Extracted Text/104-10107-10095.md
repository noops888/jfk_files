Background Use Only

Do Not Reproduce

1. At our meeting on 30 January 1909, certain additional questions were

raised relative to the relationship between (Roberts and Itkin.

2 First, when did CiPHLOBE become aware that Itkin and the

Canestoga Group)had approached Roberts with a proposal to represent

them in Africa?lo We were advised in 1966 through case officer

meetings with Roberts, that he had been developing some potential

cover company business with interests

rom the United States anc

England.

We were given the name of the (Conestoga Group)no late:

than 27 October 1966. We cannot say that we then knew the

individual names of those involved. It was not uncommon for

03 Roberts) to have discussions with a number of potential clients;

when it became apparent' that no real business was forthcoming

from this group, our interest ceased.

At the 30.

January meeting, we were also asked certair

questions about (Roberts financial involvement with the law firn

he and Itkin has been with prior to Robert's association with

the Agency.

03

2. We can add nothing to Roberts) account of January 1968 reflecting

that he entered into an agreement with the firm on 31 May 1961 wherein he was

authorized leave of absence from 1 June 1961 to 31 May 1963 drawing $100.00

per week for that period.
