MICROFILM

1. After considering several alternatives and given ORPHONE/1'5

lack of financial forward planning, ICPIPIT believes that it would

be beneficial and advantageous for WOFIRM to offer to subsidize a

portion of an overt life insurance program designed to give him both

life insurance and a cash value toward retirement.

We have dis-

cussed this with QRPHONE/1 and he has agreed to the desirability of

such a program. He is willing to participate in such an arrangement

and has undertaken to explore the possibilities available to him.

We are forwarding under separate cover a copy of several proposals

which he has received from the local representative of a reputable

WOLADY insurance fimm.

2. -MCPIPIT requests authority to subsidize up to 1/2 of the

cost of a life insurance program for QRPEONE/1. (This WOFIRM portion

not to exceed $50 per month.) Prom an administration standpoint

this would merely take the form of an increased monthly paywent and

we would take the necessary steps to verify that the funds were

indeed being devoted to their designated purpose.

1. On the basis of the documentatier sabmitted under reference dispatch, the

Medical Staff feels that QRPHONE/l mads a nurprisingly fast recovery and seems

woll on the way to complete health. However, the hospital report (a quick transla-

(lon of which lato English is attached for your ready reference), dated as it is, still

reflects some inconclusive levels in the resalts of the various chemical tests shows.

Undoubtedly these have by now been lowered to completely safe levels, since

ORPHONE /1 apparently felt well enough to travel to France, but the Medical Staff

bolieves it would be advisable for CRPHONE/l to undergo another series of liver

funetion tests, to include the following:

a. SGOT

b. SGPT

c. Bllirubin

(1) Direct

(2) Indirect

(3) Total

d. B.S.P. (Bromsulfophthaleia)

e. Serum Proteina

Albumin

Globalin

Total

We assume ORPHONE /1 has consulted his own physician on his return to the Uk.

but the Medical Staff has pointed out that clinical examination alone is not always

ratficient to determine complete recovery from hepatitis.

2. In terme of our operational atllization of ORPHONE/l at this time.

while they reserve finite comment until all the returns (per above) are in, the

Medieal Staff did stress the paramount importance proper rest and of not over-

taxing the strength of the agent, coupled with his strict adherence to regular.

warm, balanced meals in accordance with the dietary restrictions usually imposed,

and complete absence of alcohol, in order to prevent a relapso. So long as these

caveats are adhered to, however, there is no reason why he could not make some

more short trips during the next few months, if necessary. However, since he

also has an office to set up and we would like him to concentrate on the Kambona

offer, perhaps it would be a good idea to keep those trips to a minimum for the

time being.

The Medical Staff will be glad to review any further chemical tests per

para. I above suggestions, or any others which his doctor may have already run.

REVISED MEMORANDUM OF ORAL COMMITMENT

1. QRPHONE/1 collaborates with WOFIRM as a Field Agent who

provides certain services of a confidential nature. He has

received 3 Provizional Operational Ayprovai, datea do lany 66.

Financial aspects of his activity are charged to approved Project

ORPHONE.

2. ORPHONE/1's employment by WOFIRM, which began 1 June 1965.

was originally formalized by a letter of Agreement for a period

of three months, replaced by a Memorandum of Oral Cormitment dated

Under this NOC, which remains in effect (as

amended) since that date. ORPHONE/l's employment continues on a

month-to-month basis. It can be terminated by either party on a

3. ORPHONE/ receives the following financial entitlements:

a. Compensation so computed as to give QRPHONE/1 a

"tax-free" income of $800 per month (this figure

effective 1 July 1967).

NOTE: The actual breakdown of QRPHONE/1's finances

as carried on #OFIRM's books is $800 monthly salary

and $70 per month tax supplement withheld at Head-

quarters to discharge ORPHONE/1'S WOLADY tax

obligation. These taxes are remitted through

the

Covert Tax Committee.

This procedure was devised

to honor the original "tax free" commitment made

at the time of his recruitment and at the same

time to fulfill the requirement that all WOLADY

citizens pay taxes on funds received from LNFORT.

b.

Reimbursement for operational expenses and travel

unless these are paid by other sources in which

case WOFIRM will offset such outside reimbursement

against WOFIRM financial obligations to QRPHONE/1..

Since security considerations preclude processing

of detailed accountings for miscellaneous opera-

tional expenses, and as an added inducement to

ORPHONE/1 in connection with his obtaining certain

confidential information of interest to WOFIRM, a

small operational payment, as authorized by Chief,

ICPIPIT will be made to QRPHONE/l for each day

during which he is required to be absent from his

home on confidential business.

NOTE:

Write-off of the funds passed to QRPHONE/1

is to be effected on the basis of the procedure

approved by Chief, ICPIPIT and COS/London, a copy

of which is attached.

This procedure is authorized

in view of the security considerations applicable

to QRPHONE/1 and the need to limit the knowledge

of this operation within WOllACE.

ORPHONE/1 is authorized to receive a non-accountable

office allowance of $100 per month.

NOTE:

This provision was included

in ORpHONe/l's criginal borter of Agreement and was retained in

this MOC since it may be operationally desirable for @RP HONE/1

to accept employment with a target organization based elsewhere.

WOFIRM has arranged for a portion of QRPHONE/l's finan-

cial entitlements to be funded to him by QRPURE, which has also

agreed to repatriate QRPHONE/1 to WOLADY. This has been done

for operational reasons to enable ORPHONE/l to qualify for

reimburse QRPURE for any costs incurred.

6. ICPIPIT is authorized to approve purchase by @RPHONE/1

of certain items of operational equipment which are to be non-

accountable and which shall be charged against the operational

expense category of approved Project ORPHONE.

7. QRPHONE/l signed a separate Secrecy Agreement (in true.

name) at the time of his original recruitment. He is aware that

its provisions are still in effect.

8. QRPHONE/l is aware that he may be required, from time

to time, to undertake an SGSWIRL.

9. QRPHONE/l is aware of all provisions of the Memorandum

of Oral Conmitment with the exceptions of paragraph 6, which

describes an internal WOFIRM procedure; certain aspects of para-

graph 3a--specifically that WOFIRM is paying INFORT taxes in

his behalf; and certain aspects of paragraph 3b-specifically

the procedure for write-off of funds since this is an internal

WOFIRM procedure.

1. ICPIPIT is revising the QREBONY Project files--which

have been rather haphazardly naintained over the past year or

so (much of this time the project was without a case officer).

In our attempts to locate basic project documents we have been

unable to find any copy of the provisions of the Operational

Approval applicable to QREBONX/1. We do have a copy of the • •

Provisional Approval granted 23 May 1966 forwarded with OFLW -

1591, 7 July 1966. Possibly the relevant document was destroyed

during the reduction of files attendant upon the ICPIPIT move,

or possibly it was inadvertantly not forwarded to ICPIPIT.

any rate we will appreciate being sent a copy.

2. We would also like to have a sterile version of the

Project Renewal as well as all other basic documents

ought to be available to ICPIPIT.

We are forwarding USC a copy of a letter sent QREBONY/1

by Jacques Verges' lawyer in which he makes a settlement offer

on behalf of his client. CREBON'/1 will probably accept this,

after a suitable waiting period, as it offers very telling and

effective annunition for use in his continuing battle to counter

Verges' allegation that he was a WOPACT agent. It is our reading

at this point that QREBONY/1 has been quite successful in this

effort and that this settlement fron Verges will be the final

triumph in his campaign.

Cher Yonsieur,

Mon confrère adverse, Conseil de la Société Nouvelle

des Editions Internationales, et de Monsieur VERGES, me fait

savoir qu'il a eu une conversation avec sie VirGis qui lui a

indiqué qu'il vit actucilement en Algérie et serait disposé

à rechercher un règlement amiable des difficultés qui vous

opposent.

Il n'a fait part qu'actuellement sa situation

lui permet pas de payer en

une autre monnaie que la monnaie

algérienne; savoir le dinar.

Il y a là une question de principe. Pourriez-vous,

je vous prie, ne faire savoir si vous pourriez invisazer une

ransaction aux terres de laquelle vous seriez regle

on dinits.

j'ignore d'ailleurs dans quelles conditions l'exportation ces

capitaux d'alsáre est encore possible à ce jour.

Uuos qu'il en soit, peut-être seriez-vous intéressé

par cette proposition.

Je n'ai pas encore discuté de chiffres avec mon

confrère

adverse puisqu'il s'agit là d'une question préjudi-

cielle à

toute discussion sur le fond de la somme due.

J'attends done votre prochaine réponse et vous prie

de croire, cher Monsieur, à l'exprossion

de mes sentiments.

1.

The following is the text of a JAGUAR report on STEBONY/1

and Harc SCHLRIFER. JAGUAR states that the information was

received from a

"STEBONY/1 was in contact with Marc SCHLBIFER while the

latter was staying in London with his family, en route for

algeria.

SCHLEIFER had planned to leave London for Algiers

via Paris on the 2nd June,

but he deferred his departure in

order to meet STEBONY/1.

It seems that SCHLEIFER wanted, 1f

possible, to visit Tanzania also.

STEBONY/l apparently was

prepared

to help SCHLEIFER and his family to find accomnodation

while they were in London because they had little money.

He is

also reported to have said that there was a possibility of his

co-operating with SCHLBIFER in Africa.

SCHLEIFER,

& job in Dar-es-Salaam which might be taken by either SCHLEIFER

or STEBONY/1."

2.

Ref A contains previous JAGUAR comments about STEBONY/l and

sChuslfir, of about the same period.

While TIFFANY was in London

(which puts it at the right tine) STEBONY/l was in touch with

SCHLEIFER, and TIFFANY

should be-able to compare JAGUAR's comments

with what STEBONY/1 said at the time.

Ref B reflects a different

contact between the two, from a different sourge.

URBONY/1 feels that if not done right this could cause trouble,

because of usual organizational rivalries. Bo is thinking of

beginning by writing and circulating a statelent in support of

the statement on "Afro-American Liberation" which arpeared in

the E Decanber ld loc Bulletin (Harxist-Leninist) in Chicago.

He would use a pseudonym to sign his statement, but rould let

all his friends know that the pseudonyu vas really hinself, and

he sight use blanchanda's address. ferhas Grippa vould agree to

circulate or print it. If this staterent goes over, OREBOMY/1

could escalate into a suall organization. He will show RODIGAST

a craft of his statement, but also will discuse it with Manchanda

for "ideological purity".

ACTION PIQUIRID. RIJURENOIS

At the time of his recrultment in June 1965, QREBOKY/1 was told that his

$600 monthly tax-free salary would be raised to $800 once he got a job in a target

organization, uhich of course vas the soal of hla planned sunner activity in

Alglers.

2. Through no fault of his own, the Alglers assignsent (and otber possibil-

1t1e8.

) evaporated shortly thereafter.

Meanwhile, WOFACT changed

1t8 signals and eventually decided to base QREBONY/l in turope targeted againat

Ind1u1duala and groups in varlous countries.

3.

Fron the begiming, QREWDiY/l has proved more than satisfactory as an

lie has carrled out assignsents given to his wich knowledge and tact and

the proper spirit, has used his own Initiative as much as our guidance, aud has:

not violated our instructions.

ão one uill argue that no hasn't proved to be

better than ve collectively thought he would be, and in teras of k1s oun

abllities-apart frow targets which nay or uay not be accesaible to bin- he lo

getting better all the tize.

to Last year, about a year later than (REBOKY/1 night have expected his

salary to go up from $600 to $800, ve raised 10 to $700. He was pleased, and he

has not cosplained as much as he used to about a shortage of funds. (Presumably

QREBONY/l is responsive to the generally good treatsent he has had, to the

respect for bie do an ludividual and tie appreciation of hie services; probably

he la carried along as such by bis own personal satisfaction in knowing he is

meeting requirements and continually breaking neu ground.

So fevertheless, LCPIPIT belleves the tine bao cose to raise OREBORY/l's

to the prouised level.

We can all agree that ve are still getting his

q. At a meeting held on August 14, 1966, STANFORD mentioned that

Robert Williams allegedly has $1, 000, 000 available for the use of RAM.

NY T-10 advised on September 26, 1966, that STANFORD prior to moving

to Philadelphia on September 18, 1966, discussed RAM and ROBERT F. WILLIAMS

with him. According to the source, STANFORD has alleged WILLIAMS has money

avallable for RAM.

During the course of the conversation, STANFORD stated that the contact man

between RAM in the US and R. Williams' is one Richard GIBSON in Paris, France.

STANFORD stated that GIBSON passes on messages from WILLIAMS and will be the

man contacted by whoever is designated as a courier to go to China to get the money.

Source also stated that he was told Richard GIBSON was living in the Obs

Crystal, Hotel (phonetéc), Paris, France, and was working out of the La Royale Cafe

(phonetic), Paris, France.

Attention: Deputy Director, Plans

Subject: RICHARD GIBSON

INFORMATION CONCERHING

A source of this Bureau who has furnished reliable

Information in the past recently advised that during the

Fall of 1966, & member of an Italian pro-Chinese Marxist-

Leninist organization stated that one Richard Gibson was

suspected of being a spy for the Central Intelligence Agency.

According to this individual, Gibson recently had been in

In the company of a female secretary fron Paris,

whose home is in New Rochelle, New York. At that time

Gibson renarked his travel and activities were possible

because he had married a wealthy English woman.

Other

things

were said which aroused the suspicions of the Italian.

According to our source, the Italian pro-Chinese

Marxist-Leninist subsequently relayed his suspicions concerning

Gibson to Rene Raindorf, a senner of the Central Comnittee

of the Communist Party

of Belgium (Marxist-Leninist).

Raindorf reportedly thereafter net in Brussels, Belgius, with

Gibson although be had indicated the Belgian pro-Chinese

communists would look into the charges of the Italian Marxist-

Leninist.

A number of lengthly and fruitful discussions have

been held with JIGUR officers regarding our continued

running of CRIEONY in the U.k.

Their comments on the

quality of CRONY's reporting hate been reported from time

to time.

similarly, ve will not duell here on the nechanical

arrangements we have evolved (with SIOTH's agreement) to

expedite the passage of infornation to JAGuAR, on the one

hand, and avoid duplicate reporting (prinicpally by passing

the

same materials as CS dissens to SWOTH) on the other

hand.

Suffice it here to say that achleving both of these

goals,

without conpronising CRRECHY as a source throughout

both

JAGUAR and S!OTH (due largely to the wide range of

areas he reports on, is a comples problem.

le think we

have reached a

mutually satisfactory arrangement for

achieving both ains.

A. QRBONY/ (Q) gives the convincing impression that he is at home

in his new work. He responds sell to su; estions and instructions, adds

suggastions of his own ior i-proving the =lan-- an indication that he

wishes to please. in the begiring he storea a tenuency to raise minor

objections involving personal zaterial problems (e.:, Inconvenience to

family life oi a long tdy) but less of this was renarked as he cane to

realize that requirements were to be reasonable and he was to te treated

as a haman being with his on problems.

He has stated that he sould not continue his present involvement

with target personalities and institutions if it were not that re wish

him to, l.e., his oin inclination would te to withdraw irom the political

fringe. Podigast feels that this is consistent hith his background,

which has not a party career; in his youth he was willfully apolitical

and hostile to the "rovement"; later he ves involved in opposing party

people in his lew York work; in Faris he didn't get along wit.. his party

friends (the affair oi the forged letter) and oi course broke with the

magazire crond there.

He seems to be genuinely comnitted to working against erenies

of CDYuke, ready to accept eve- deeper comitient; he has expressed

no reservations as to what he vill do. He doesn't object to reporting

on old friends, fello: BRIEs,

PLUTTEd, or using s/w techniques (which he took with him on a trip to what

was then a very hostile area, ihere he has known enenies, and where

there has a recent history oi sealing roughly with outsiders). shen

orders contlict tith personal desires (for example, when he planed to

spend a weekend in a city he enjoys but ras told he should proceed

Imediately to his next stopping place), he obys without hesitation.

the foregoing is a collection of discellaneous facts, cut taken

together they paint the portrait of a promising agent, both in terns

oi motivations and abilities.

АТТОБРВСТІ

B. Rodigast's knorl:de of @'s a-vitude in the months prior to.

recruitrent (June 1905) is limited. Rodigest has the impression & had

simply reached the end of his rose-- he had nowhere to go, he had

earlier decided that he would iike to work for or at least cooperate with

ODYOKs (although earlier attespis to maxe contact met with no success) .

The humane treatment received at the hands oi his recruiter, the

subsequent sympathetic handlin; by his case oilicer, undoubtedly

convinced hir that he had not nade a mistake.

The material factor is

not to be underestinated.

The dezoralizing position

oi lirinz on his wire

and worse, on her fanily,

must have lowered his resistance to any possible alternative. Rodigast

simply doesn't know hor @ might have responded to a reasonable offer

from enesies of ODYCK: at that point. The prospect of immediate engagement

at a decent wage may have been cecisive.

Since that time, Rodigast feels @'s motivation has been reinforced

and perbass considerably altere: he has been asked to do obviously

necessary tasks, and so he can feel he is reeded by someone; he has been

given reasonable instructions on how to acc.nplish them; he sees that

resolved before being taken up with f, and thus he has a sonewhat rosy

vl:w of the operation. The satisfaction oi accos?Lishment (i.e., bein?,

able to produce userul answers to our questions) is surely a jactor

in his present attitude.

Though Light-skinned, with a voice and accent which would be

considered acceptable in any raPilil, society, & is extremely sensitive

to the fact that he is a liegro. He has not said or suggested any such

thing to rodigast, but this is so obvious a lactor in his correspondence

(even discounting the extent to which the correspondence is part of

his conscious cover) that it seems to Rodigas: that it must be a factor

in his life. On the other hand, lodigast has knor another liegro who

was a close iriend of & (and now one of his major enenies,

as a resuit

of the Paris jorged letter incident and contributing events) who was

so sensitive about race that he makes & in retrospect seem like an

Uncle Tom.

who is not genuinely a "niger lover", i.e., who could not convey

a convincing image oi a person for whom a color difference vas not a

barrier (Q would surely detect the false "pal"). & has mentioned anti-

Negro prejudice as a reason for his refusal to cooperate nith ODeNY

oificers who talked to him while he was in New York. In fect, & deais,

with his present case o:ficer as a possible i: not a true iriend;

they share an inter-st and involvement in writiug, English literature,

Living happily abroad, etc.; Rodigast has tried to read Dants in the

original and l has done so; Rodigast would like to write a novel and

Q has published one; lodigast doesn't know much about the post-logical

positivists who interest & but probably gives a convincing impression

that he would like to know about them, and just night be capable of

understandin: them. "hat all the foregoin" means is that in l we have

an accomplished person, and it is a useful tactic to treat him if

not as a superior than at the very least as an equal.

primary: A joined the orgenization a-u stayed with us because he could

not do as well in any other job, could in iact get no job (because of;

his background, his alien status abroad, etc). Fodigast does not exclude

this, although he feels that whatever the originai motivation, it has

been

strengthened and perhaps converted into sosething more worthy.

But even if his prinary zotivation renains material,

project over its lirst nine months suggest it is a viable one.

C. & has lived in the underground for so nany years without

breaking that it is likely he will be able to continue to do so. He thinks

fast, handles himseli well in matters presenting security problems.

He is not fully trained for clandestine activity. Fodigast's long

mestings with him alriays include advice on one or zore specilic aspects

of clandestine work, wrich then added yp may be taken to repr-sent a

short, course, but that is all. The lacs of training has led @ to do or

say things which hoalgast would not have wished hin to do or say, and

whenever possible t.is has been brought to Q's atiention, and he seems

responsive to such instruction.

Rodigast would not recommend that l be given a training course,

but this would not preclude more lornal sessions with Rodigast during

which Rodigast could give nore complete instruction on various phases

of clandestine work.

It is to ce hoped that the present situation regarding his wife

orientation, but there is no evidence that it is an orthodor larst

one (or that it ever was).

He seens to like Rodigast; in any event they work well together.

He has made no effort to develop a warm relationship with Rodigast,

recent evidence to contradict his statement that he considers himseli

to be a loyal PBP:!:R; it may just be true. If it isn't, this won't

make any difference to the project as it is understood by Rodigast.

E. Rodigast does not believe @ i3 at present vorking for another

it is possible that he would.

He has not written as many iree-iance articles as codigast iould have

liked him to, because each requires thinking out a subject, gathering

naterial, selecting a point oi view and thinking o: the public to which

it would be addressed- a lot of york lor articles neant to sem: nainly

as cover, for publication in obscure organs, or perhaus merely to be

used to convince editors that he as active. Or the other hand, he produced

the 1irst issue o. the nenslotter in record time. folloing instructions

to the letter (indeed, accesting what must at tines seem like petty

editorial changes nade by Rodigast). Ferha-s he produced the latter

so efficiently because he say in it added prestige, an opportunity to

get his name back beiore the public in a respectable context.

Idealogical totivation would not seem to be a level oi control

in his case, "hat is nost important is his contentuent with being (he

hopes) a persanent part o: a large organization, with a steady salary

(he has never said this, oi course); the poier of CDI Ke is less

important than its knonn reputation ¿or keeping its promise to pay,

something one doesn't fird anong the osposition groups known to a,

and he finds new exa-ples of this daily.

Doubtless, his tendency to bear a grudge is a factor here- o

Rodigast feels that considerate dealing with l, letting

him knor where he is going, what he can expect, not changing the rules

In the course of tine, the ideological factor, rhich is perhaos marginal

aiter the event are thorough and apparently accuraie.

Fe read A Spy and His laster by Christopher Pellt., and has

mentioned it a couple oi times when a renark by railgast reminds him

of sorething saii in the book.

Roilgast doesn't think that even aiter training l rould ba very

of fact to be sly, and perhars slightly lazy about what sight be

gratuitous shavior (e.f, changing subway trains or taxis just on the

is not to depend on y ior such things, but to atteat to plan nesting

on Q's skill in such areas. After patient briefing & does understand

the need for tradecrait eificiency, and as already noted be follows

the advice.

It was the complex of a poor boy who never had anyone he could turn to
