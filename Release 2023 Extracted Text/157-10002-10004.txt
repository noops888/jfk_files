CARD 2 of 2
J. D. (JAKE) ESTERLINE, who was head of the Cuba Task Force
in pre-BAY OF PIGS days, was regarded by the IG Report as
probably the most reliable witness on general timing of
these schemes because "he seems at least to have known of
all of them." (9).
The IG Report was: "unable to establish even a tentative
sequence among the schemes; they may, in fact, have been
under consideration simultaneously." (9)

CARD 1 of 2.
DR. EDWARD GUNN, Chief, Operations Division, Office of
Medical Services, has a notation that on 16 August 1960,
he received a box of Cuban cigars to be treated with a
lethal material. (21). He understood them to be CASTRO'S
favorite brand. (21). GUNN's notes show that within the
next month he contacted Rey Fraichter, of TSD, (Sept. 6,
1960) and gave him the box of cigars (21). Treichler
recalls "that he did contaminate a full box of 50 cigars
with Botulinum Toxin, a virulent poison," (21) which would
kill the intended victim upon merely merely putting it in the
mouth. Grcic 19's notes showed delivery of the box on

JACK STEWART an officer assigned to the Mexico City station, met in
Mexico City with a high officer in the Cuban armed forces who was subsequently
to become a CIA asset known as A.M. LASH-1.* STRAR met with A.M. LASH to
sound out his views on the Cuban situation. A.M. LASH was in Mexico City to
attend a "leftist-sponsored" conference. (78).
The March 1961 meeting was inconclusive, but it led to other meetings out
of which Project A.M.LASH was created. A.M. LASH-1 "repeatedly insisted that
the essential first step in overthrowing the regime was the elimination of
CASTRO himself, which /A.M. LASH-17 claimed he was prepared to accomplish. He
repeatedly requested that we /CIA furnish him the special equipment or material
needed to do the job." (79).

Gold suggested that they not resort to firearms, but that if he could be furnished with "
some type of potent pill that could be placed in Castro's food or drink. Sam indicated
that he had a prospective nominee in the person of Juan Orta, a Cuban official, who had
been receiving back payments from the gambling interests who still had access to Castro,
and was in a financial bind. Cornelius Roosevelt, Chief, TSD was consulted and assigned
Dr. Raymond Treichler to develop a pill that had the elements of rapid solubility, high
lethal content, and little or no traceability. Six of these items were produced and
after being checked out for their effectiveness by Dr. Edward M. Gunn, Three pills were
ultimately turned over to Sam for the mission. Neither TSD nor Dr. Gunn was briefed on
