1. ACTION REQUIRED:
PLEASE INCORPORATE THE FOLLOWING INTO THE
*TALKING POINTS TO BE USED IN THE PRESENTATION TO THE<JFK>
*<ASSASSINATION>RECORDS REVIEW BOARD.
2. AMBASSADOR MONDALE, THE EMBASSY
STRONGLY
OPPOSE RELEASE TO THE PUBLIC OF ANY REFERENCE TO THE EXISTENCE OF A
SUCH ACTION COULD HAVE ADVERSE CONSEQUENCES
FOR
RELATIONS AT A TIME WHEN A NUMBER OF DIFFICULT SECURITY
AND ECONOMIC ISSUES REMAIN UNRESOLVED. IT ALSO WOULD RISK REIGNITING
EARLIER CONTROVERSIES
DISRUPT COOPERATION
PUBLIC CONFIRMATION WOULD, WITHOUT A DOUBT,
ON IMPORTANT
COUNTERTERRORIST AND COUNTERINTELLIGENCE CASES. BY MAKING THE
OBJECT OF GREATER PUBLIC AND POSSIBLY OFFICIAL SCRUTINY,
IT WOULD LOWER THE CONFIDENCE
ABILITY TO PROTECT THEIR IDENTITY AND SECURITY.
3. IMPACT
THE
IN OUR
GOVERNMENT DOES
NOT PUBLICLY ADMIT THAT IT COLLECTS INTELLIGENCE, AND AS A COROLLARY,
DOES NOT ADMIT TO HAVING LIAISON RELATIONSHIPS WITH US INTELLIGENCE
AGENCIES.
AVOIDS PUBLIC ACKNOWLEDGEMENT BECAUSE IT KNOWS THAT
IS ANATHEMA TO THE LEFT WING OF THE
POLITICAL SPECTRUM, AND ANY ADMISSION WOULD GIVE THE LEFT NEW
OPPORTUNITIES TO ATTACK
RULING PARTY
WHICH WAS THE
AND IS TODAY THE PARTY OF THE PRIME
MINISTER AND THE LEADING PARTY WITHIN THE RULING COALITION. ANY
OFFICIAL CONFIRMATION THAT CONTRADICTED EARLIER

WOULD BE USED AS A CLUB BY THE LEFT
TO ATTACK
FOR THE US-JAPAN MUTUAL SECURITY TREATY AND THE
PRESENCE OF US FORCES IN JAPAN. WITH A STATE VISIT BY THE US
PRESIDENT FAST APPROACHING AND DELICATE NEGOTIATIONS OVER US BASES IN
OKINAWA LIKELY TO CONTINUE INTO 1997, THIS WOULD BE A PARTICULARLY
BAD TIME TO OPEN THE DOOR TO ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS ABOUT US ACTIVITIES
AND INTENTIONS
ACKNOWLEDGEMENT
WOULD ALSO REVIVE OLD
4.
CONTROVERSIES THAT HAVE LARGELY RECEDED FROM THE HEADLINES. IN 1995,
THE PRESS MADE A MAJOR ISSUE
IN ITS
FORMATIVE YEARS. ANYTHING THAT LENT CREDIBILITY TO THE STORY WOULD
BE A SERIOUS POLITICAL LIABILITY
THEN FOREIGN MINISTER
PERSONALLY ASKED AMBASSADOR MONDALE THAT
THE US GOVERNMENT NOT RELEASE DOCUMENTS ON THIS SUBJECT.
EXPLAINED TO AMBASSADOR MONDALE
CAN DEAL WITH RUMORS AND
EVEN UNCONFIRMED LEAKS, BUT OFFICIAL CONFIRMATION
WOULD BE AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT AFFAIR, THREATENING TO DAMAGE
BOTH THE CONSERVATIVE POLITICAL LEADERSHIP AS WELL AS THE
RELATIONSHIP.
EXPLICITLY IMPRESSED ON THE AMBASSADOR
THE NEED FOR THE US GOVERNMENT TO HOLD THE LINE AGAINST DISCLOSURE.
5. IN THE FALL OF 1995, A NEW YORK TIMES ARTICLE ALLEGED THAT
HAS SINCE BECOME PRIME
IN RESPONSE TO THE ENSUING PRESS QUERIES, JAPANESE
OFFICIALS OF THE CONCERNED MINISTRY DISMISSED THE STORY AS
IMPLAUSIBLE. IF THE US GOVERNMENT DECLASSIFIES A DOCUMENT THAT
CONFIRMS
PRESS NEW
OPPORTUNITIES TO REOPEN THE ISSUE OF ALLEGED ECONOMIC ESPIONAGE AND
ATTACK THE UNITED STATES AND ITS FRIENDS WITHIN THE
IT WOULD HAND THE
GOVERNMENT.
6. DISRUPTION OF LIAISON RELATIONSHIPS:
GO TO GREAT LENGTHS TO KEEP THEIR RELATIONSHIPS WITH US INTELLIGENCE
AGENCIES SECRET. IN THE CASE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT OF THOSE
RELATIONSHIPS, ALL CONTACT COULD BE SEVERED IN THE EVENT OF
DISCLOSURE AND EMBARRASSMENT. SUCH A RUPTURE IN THE RELATIONSHIP
DEFIES EASY REPAIR. THE SOUTH KOREAN AGENCY FOR NATIONAL SECURITY
PLANNING, WHICH SERIOUSLY EMBARRASSED JAPANESE LIAISON WHEN IT
KIDNAPPED OPPOSITION POLITICIAN KIM DAE JUNG FROM TOKYO OVER TWO
DECADES AGO, IS STILL TREATED AS A PARIAH TODAY.
7.
IMPACT ON CONTINUING OPERATIONS: OUR ONGOING COOPERATION
IN PURSUIT OF A MAJOR INTERNATIONAL
TERRORIST GROUP COULD BE TOTALLY DISRUPTED BY DISCLOSURE. EXTREMELY
IMPORTANT US LAW ENFORCEMENT AND INTELLIGENCE EQUITIES ARE AT STAKE
IN THIS COOPERATIVE ENDEAVOR. THE TERRORIST GROUP IS PROBABLY NOT
AWARE OF THE EXTENT OF US INVOLVEMENT IN THEIR PURSUIT. DISCLOSURE
THAT REMINDED THEM OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
AGAINST THEM COULD BE DETRIMENTAL TO OUR ABILITY TO COLLECT
INTELLIGENCE ON THE GROUP.
COOPERATION
8. IMPACT ON SOURCES:
STATION'S RELATIONSHIP WITH AT LEAST ONE
PREDATES THE<JFK ASSASSINATION.> PUBLICITY ABOUT CIA PRESENCE
AND ACTIVITY, EVEN IN THE PAST, OFTEN CAUSES
