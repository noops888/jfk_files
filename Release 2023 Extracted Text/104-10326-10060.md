GROUP, AND THE FORMER HUSBAND OF A GROUP MEMBER, OF BEING CUBAN

SECURITY SOURCES OR PENETRATIONS.

THE LEADERS OF THE DISSIDENT

GROUP DID NOT HAVE ANY SPECIFIC EVIDENCE THAT THE INDIVIDUALS WERE

CONNECTED TO CUBAN SECURITY, BUT INCIDENTS IN WHICH EACH OF THESE

INDIVIDUALS WERE INVOLVED LED THE LEADERSHIP TO BECOME SUSPICIOUS

OF THEM.

TEXT:

1. AS OF MID AUGUST 1995, THE LEADERSHIP OF THE CUBAN

DISSIDENT GROUP, CUBAN CIVIC CURRENT (CORRIENTE CIVICA CUBANA -

CCC), WAS CERTAIN THAT THE CUBAN HUMAN RIGHTS AND DISSIDENT

MOVEMENTS HAD ATTRACTED THE ATTENTION OF CUBAN SECURITY, PRIMARILY

THE MINISTRY OF INTERIOR (MININT), AND THEY BELIEVED THAT MININT

WAS TRYING TO PENETRATE DISSIDENT ORGANIZATIONS.

CCC MEMBERS

CONCERNED OVER THE GROUP'S SECURITY TAGGED FOUR INDIVIDUALS WHO

XHIBITED BEHAVIOR OR ACTIVITIES IN THE HUMAN RIGHTS OR DISSIDENT

RGANIZATIONS THAT SUGGESTED THAT THEY WERE ASSOCIATED WITI

MININT.

THE INDIVIDUALS WERE JORGE ( (GONZALES) ), VLADIMIRO

( (ROCA)) ATUNEZ, GUILLERMO ( (FERNANDEZ)) DONATES, AND RAFAEL

2. THE CCC LEADERSHIP WAS VIRTUALLY CERTAIN THAT JORGE

GONZALEZ, OF THE CHRISTIAN LIBERATION MOVEMENT (MOVIMIENTO

CRISTIANO LIBERACION), HEADED BY OSVALDO ( (PAYA)) SARDINAS, WAS A

CUBAN SECURITY PENETRATION.

DIRECTORS OF THE CCC NOTED THAT HIS

QUESTIONS WERE USUALLY SO PENETRATING AS TO SUGGEST INSIDE

A TRUSTED MEMBER OF THE CCC WAS DIRECTED AGAINST

GONZALEZ,

PROVIDING HIM WITH MOSTLY BOGUS INFORMATION KNOWN ONLY

TO THE CCC MEMBER AND THE CCC LEADERSHIP.

RECORDS OF THE DATE THE

INFORMATION WAS PASSED WERE KEPT BY THE CCC.

THE INFORMATION

LATER SURFACED THROUGH MININT DURING THE COURSE OF MININT

INTERVIEWS OF DETAINED CCC LEADERS.

THE CCC LEADERSHIP BELIEVED

THAT GONZALEZ MIGHT HAVE BEEN IN VENEZUELA AS OF MID AUGUST 1995.

VLADIMIRO ROCA OF THE CUBAN DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST

CURRENT (CORRIENTE SOCIALISTA DEMOCRATICA CUBANA) , WHO IS ONE OF

THE CLOSEST ASSOCIATES OF ELIZARDO ( (SANCHEZ)) SANTACRUZ OF THE

CUBAN COMMISSION FOR HUMAN RIGHTS AND NATIONAL RECONCILIATION

(COMISION CUBANA DE DERECHOS HUMANOS Y RECONCILIACION NACIONAL) ,

CAME UNDER CCC SUSPICION AFTER AN INCIDENT IN 1992.

IN THAT YEAR,

SHORTLY AFTER THE LETTER BY CUBAN PROFESSIONALS TO THE IBERIAN

AMERICAN SUMMIT WAS PRESENTED, CCC CHIEF ASSISTANT DIRECTOR

VLADIMIR ( (MARTINEZ-AMORES) ) ALVAREZ WAS VISITED AT HIS HOME BY

TWO MININT OFFICERS. THE TWO OFFICERS WERE NAMED "MARCIAL" AND

"DANIEL."

THE SENIOR OF THE TWO, DANIEL, REMARKED THAT ELIZARDO

SANCHEZ WAS A U.S. INTELLIGENCE

IN DUE COURSE THIS

INFORMATION WAS PASSED BY MARTINEZ-AMORES TO SANCHEZ IN THE

PRESENCE OF VLADIMIRO ROCA.

AROUND DECEMBER 1992, DURING AN

"INTERVIEW" BY MININT OF A CCC MEMBER, MARCIAL MADE A STATEMENT

THAT INDICATED THAT HE KNEW THAT HIS INITIAL REMARKS TO

MARTINEZ-AMORES ABOUT SANCHEZ HAD BEEN PASSED TO SANCHEZ. WHEN IT

WAS REPORTED TO SANCHEZ THAT MININT HAD MADE THIS STATEMENT, HE

ATTRIBUTED IT TO TECHNICAL COVERAGE IN HIS HOME ASSOCIATED WITH AN

LP OPPOSITE HIS HOME.

THE CCC WAS NOT CONVINCED BY THIS

EXPLANATION AND THEREAFTER KEPT ROCA AT A DISTANCE, AS THEY

ASSUMED THAT IT WAS ROCA WHO HAD PASSED THE INFORMATION TO THE

SECRET

(SOURCE COMMENT:

ONLY ROCA, SANCHEZ AND MARTINEZ-AMORES

KNEW THAT SANCHEZ HAD BEEN TOLD, AND BOTH SANCHEZ AND

MARTINEZ-AMORES WERE TRUSTED MEMBERS OF THE CCC.)

4.

CCC'S SUSPICIONS CONCERNING ROCA HAVE GROWN STRONGER IN

LIGHT OF THE FOLLOWING INCIDENTS:

A.

CCC MEMBER FELIX ((DIAZ)) WAS DENIED A REQUEST FOR

A VISA TO THE U.S. BY THE U.S. INTERESTS SECTION.

THE REPORTED

GROUNDS FOR DENIAL WERE THAT DIAZ HAD NOT SUBMITTED SUFFICIENT

EVIDENCE TO JUSTIFY THE VISA.

ROCA WAS HEARD TO TELL DIAZ THAT

HIS REQUEST HAD BEEN UNDERMINED BY FELIX ( (BONNE) ) CARCASSES, THE

CCC LEADER.

BONNE DENIED THIS ACTION,

SAYING THAT HE WOULD HAVE

HAD NO INTEREST IN UNDERMINING DIAZ.

IN EARLY 1993, JORGE GONZALEZ, A CLOSE FRIEND OF

ROCA, INFORMED THE CCC LEADERSHIP THAT AN AUTHORESS, IDENTIFIED AS

MARIANA ( (BADELL)) (PHONETIC), WAS PREPARING A BIOGRAPHY OF CUBAN

PRESIDENT FIDEL ( (CASTRO)) AND WANTED

THE REASON

OR SUCH A MEETING IN CONNECTION WITH A BIOGRAPHY OF CASTRO WAS

NOT CLEAR, BUT THE MEETING TOOK PLACE IN GONZALEZ' HOME, AND

INCLUDED BADELL, BONNE, AND MARTINEZ-AMORES.

THE CCC LEADERS

NOTED THAT BADELL APPEARED TO BE UNCOMFORTABLE DURING THE COURSE

SHE STATED THAT SHE HAD HAD LUNCH WITH AN

OFFICIAL OF THE SPANISH EMBASSY IN HAVANA, WHO WAS ASSISTING HER

WITH THE BIOGRAPHY OF CASTRO BY PUTTING HER IN TOUCH WITH ONE

CARLOS ALBERTO ( (MONTANER)) IN MADRID, WHO WOULD EDIT THE BOOK.

SHE DECLINED TO IDENTIFY THE SPANISH OFFICAL, BUT DESCRIBED HIM IN

SUCH DETAIL THAT BOTH BONNE AND MARTINEZ-AMORES RECOGNIZED HIM AS

JORGE ( (DE ORUETA)), A LONG-TIME CONTACT OF THE CCC.

WHEN THE

CONVERSATION WAS RELAYED TO DE ORUETA BY THE CCC, HE RECALLED

BADELL HAD BEEN INTRODUCED TO HIM BY VLADIMIRO ROCA'S WIFE.

FURTHER RECALLED THE LUNCH AND MENTION OF THE BOOK, BUT DECLARED

THE MONTANER INFORMATION TO BE SPURIOUS. THIS SEQUENCE OF EVENTS

SUGGESTED TO CCC SECURITY PERSONNEL THAT THERE WAS COORDINATION

AMONG INDIVIDUALS SUSPECTED OF BEING DIRECTED BY CUBAN SECURITY.

C. IN 1993 A GROUP OF DISSIDENTS, INCLUDING BONNE, WAS

SECRETARY AT THE CIRCE EMBASSY, TO ATTEND A VISIT FROM THE CZECH

SECRETARY AT THE CZECH EMBASSY,

VICE CHANCELLOR. (SOURCE COMMENT: THIS KIND OF CONTACT WAS

ANATHEMA TO THE CUBAN GOVERNMENT.) THE CZECH INVITATION TO BONNE

WAS SENT THREE DAYS IN ADVANCE BY WORD OF MOUTH VIA ROCA.

COINCIDENCE, ANOTHER CCC REPRESENTATIVE VISITING MIKISKA WITHIN A

DAY OR TWO OF WHEN THE INVITATION WAS RELAYED TO ROCA WAS ASKED

ABOUT THE INVITATION TO BONNE, AS BONNE HAD NOT RESPONDED TO THE

CZECH EMBASSY.

THE CCC REPRESENTATIVE INCLUDED THE QUERY

REGARDING THE INVITATION IN HIS REPORT OF THE MEETING TO THE CCC,

GIVING BONNE HIS FIRST NOTIFICATION THAT THERE HAD EVEN BEEN AN

INVITATION. ROCA FINALLY PASSED THE MESSAGE TO THE HOME OF

GEORGINA DE LAS MERCEDES ( (GONZALEZ) ) CORBO,

ONE OF BONNE'S CHIEF

ASSISTANTS, TWO HOURS PRIOR TO THE BEGINNING OF THE FUNCTION.

D.

IN MID 1995, REINALDO ( (ROQUE) ) MALHERBE OF CCC

REPORTED THAT VLADIMIRO ROCA'S WIFE WAS UNDERMINING ELIZARDO

SANCHEZ BY PASSING AROUND STORIES THAT HE HAD BEEN WITHHOLDING

ORGANIZATIONAL FUNDS, INTENDED FOR THE SOCIALIST CURRENT, FOR HIS

PERSONAL USE. (SOURCE COMMENT:

THIS RUMOR CAMPAIGN MAY HAVE

*CONTRIBUTED TO SANCHEZ' REPORTED RESIGNATION FROM THE< EXECUTIVE>

COMMITTEE OF THE SOCIALIST CURRENT.)

REPORTING ON RADIO MARTI FROM MIAMI AROUND MID 1995

ALLEGEDLY REFERRED TO VLADIMIRO ROCA AS AN AGENT OF CUBAN STATE

SECURITY. ROCA HIMSELF WAS REPORTED IN CUBAN DISSIDENT CIRCLES TO

HAVE STATED THAT HE WAS A LONG-TIME FRIEND OF MAJOR GENERAL FABIAN

((ESCALANTE)) FONT, WHO WAS REPORTEDLY THE CHIEF OF THE MININT

DIRECTORATE OF COUNTERINTELLIGENCE (DCI). (HEADQUARTERS COMMENT:

ESCALANTE FONT NOW HEADS THE MINISTRY'S HISTORY COMMISSION AND IS

*KNOWN FOR HIS INQUIRIES INTO THE PRESIDENT<JOHN>F. <KENNEDY>

ASSASSINATION, THE BAY OF PIGS INVASION, AND THE CUBAN MISSILE

5. GUILLERMO FERNANDEZ DONATES IS A CIVIL ENGINEER WHO WAS

CLOSE TO GUSTAVO ( (ARCOS) ) BERGNES OF THE CUBAN COMMITTEE FOR

HUMAN RIGHTS (COMITE CUBANO PRO DERECHOS HUMANOS) . HE WAS

SUSPECTED OF BEING A MININT SOURCE AND A PROVOCATEUR BY THE CCC

HE JOINED THE CCC ON THE RECOMMENDATION OF ARCOS

BECAUSE FERNANDEZ WAS A MEMBER OF THE PROFESSIONAL CLASS.

COMMENT: MANY MEMBERS OF THE CCC ARE PROFESSIONALS.) THE CCC

INITIALLY BECAME SUSPICIOUS OF FERNANDEZ BECAUSE HE HAD A HISTORY

OF ARRESTS IN WHICH HE WOULD BE PLACED WITH VARIOUS GROUPS OF

POLITICAL PRISONERS.

IN PRISON HE WOULD EVENTUALLY HAVE A FIGHT

WITH A GUARD OR COMMIT AN INFRACTION OF REGULATIONS AND BE REMOVED

BY THE AUTHORITIES FOR DISCIPLINARY ACTION.

EACH TIME HE EMERGED

FROM PRISON HE SEEMED TO BE IN EXCELLENT HEALTH AND WELL FED.

6.

ADDITIONALLY,

SEVERAL OTHER ANOMALIES HAVE CAUSED THE

CCC LEADERSHIP TO BE SUSPICIOUS OF FERNANDEZ:

ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS, FERNANDEZ HAS BEEN ASKED BY

THE CCC TO COMMUNICATE ITEMS OF MUTUAL INTEREST TO ARCOS.

WAS OFTEN GROSSLY INACCURATE.

WHEN APPRISED OF THIS SITUATION,

ARCOS DISMISSED CCC COMMENTS AS BEING SIMPLE MISUNDERSTANDINGS.

IT HAS BEEN NOTED BY THE CCC LEADERSHIP THAT

FERNANDEZ WAS FRIENDLY WITH JORGE GONZALEZ AND WITH VLADIMIRO

FERNANDEZ WAS PRIVY TO THE ACTIVITIES PLANNED BY SOCIALIST

THE GROUP TO WHICH ROCA BELONGED, BY HIS ASSOCIATION WITH

REINALDO ROQUE, A MEMBER OF THE CCC, WHO WORKED WITH

SOCIALIST CURRENT, NOTED THAT WHEN THE GROUP WAS SCHEDULED TO

MEET, IT WAS CHALLENGED BY CUBAN AUTHORITIES SO OFTEN THAT THE

AUTHORITIES MUST HAVE BEEN APPRISED OF ITS SCHEDULE.

FERNANDEZ OR ROCA (OR BOTH) COULD HAVE BEEN PASSING SUCH

INFORMATION TO THE AUTHORITIES.

C. ON ONE OCCASION, TO THE SURPRISE OF THE CCC,

FERNANDEZ, A KARATE PRACTITIONER, INVITED THE ENTIRE CCC

MEMBERSHIP TO GO TO THE CIUDAD DEPORTIVA (SPORIS CITY) TO AN

EXERCISE FIELD TO WORK OUT.

CCC SECURITY PERSONNEL NOTED THAT

THIS WOULD HAVE ASSEMBLED ALL OR MOST OF THE CCC MEMBERSHIP IN

HAVANA IN AN OPEN AREA WHERE IT COULD BE OBSERVED AND

PHOTOGRAPHED.

THE INVITATION, COMING AS IT DID AS A ONE-TIME

OPPORTUNITY WITH NO PRECEDENT, FUELED SUSPICIONS WITHIN THE CCC

AND THE INVITATION WAS DECLINED.

7. A SERIES OF EVENTS INVOLVING RAFAEL ALCIDES, A NOTED

CUBAN POET AND FIRST HUSBAND OF TERESA ( (FERNANDEZ)) MARDONES (A

MEMBER OF THE CCC), WAS SIGNIFICANT TO THE CCC BECAUSE IT CALLED

INTO QUESTION WHERE ALCIDES' LOYALTIES LAY. ALCIDES AND FERNANDEZ

HAD ONE CHILD, A SON, TOGETHER BEFORE THEY WERE DIVORCED AROUND

FERNANDEZ HAD REMARRIED AND WAS LIVING WITH RONALDO

LAROQUE (COUSIN OF REINALDO ROQUE), AND ALCIDES WAS SPENDING

CONSIDERABLE TIME AT THE ROQUE RESIDENCE, PRESUMABLY TO BE WITH

THE CCC BECAME CONCERNED WITH THE SECURITY OF THE

SITUATION AS FERNANDEZ WAS PRIVY TO CCC INFORMATION AND WAS

ASSESSED AS BEING EMOTIONAL AND TENDING TO CONFIDE TOO MUCH.

MARTINEZ-AMORES WAS DISPATCHED BY THE CCC TO FEEL OUT ALCIDES, AND

REPORTED THAT HE SPOKE COHERENTLY AND LOGICALLY AGAINST THE

CURRENT REGIME.

MARTINEZ-AMORES APPEARED TO BE REASSURED.

SUBSEQUENTLY HOWEVER, IN CONVERSATION WITH ALCIDES, REINALDO ROQUE

LEARNED THAT ALCIDES

WAS PART OF A DELEGATION OF THE CUBAN

NATIONAL UNION OF WRITERS AND ARTISTS (UNION NACIONAL DE

ESCRITORES Y ARTISTAS DE CUBA - UNEAC) THAT VISITED MADRID

SOMETIME AROUND 1994 â€¢

WHILE THERE, ALCIDES SAID THAT HE WAS

INVITED WITH A NUMBER OF OTHER UNEAC DELEGATES TO LUNCH WITH

CARLOS ALBERTO MONTANER. (SOURCE COMMENT: THE LUNCHEON WITH

MONTANER MUST CERTAINLY HAVE RECEIVED CUBAN GOVERNMENT APPROVAL,

AND THE GROUP MUST HAVE INCLUDED CUBAN SECURITY PERSONNEL.)

ALCIDES TOLD ROQUE THAT ON HIS RETURN TO CUBA, HE ATTENDED THE

FUNERAL FOR A SISTER (NFI) OF FIDEL CASTRO AND DELIVERED THE

FUNERAL ORATION.

FOLLOWING THE FUNERAL, HE WAS OBSERVED TO BE

EMBRACED BY MINISTER OF THE REVOLUTIONARY ARMED FORCES GENERAL

RAUL ( (CASTRO) ) RUZ.
