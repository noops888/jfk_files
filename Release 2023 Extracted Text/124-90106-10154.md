Dear Sir:

ver. SErver 112?

For several years Tuya Cuban Expres was favored with your air shipments

to Cuba.

In 1960, due to the communist lake-over, and the imprisonment of

my fat her and me, our ope rations were discontinued, Hoday, we are engaged

in the struggle against communism through "Comandos: I", and I come to ask

for your sup port.

Comando's "I"' wa's created in 1962 by a group of freedom-loving Cubans, most

of them businessmen and professionals, with no personal or political ambi-

tions other than the liberation of Cuba: Their efforts and accomplishments

were clearly di sclosed by LIFE magazine of April 12th, 1963, whose front

cover displayed a nemorable drawing of the attack on the Russian Ship Baku.

Lam convinced that victory over communism can be achieved if we recognize

that the international communist conspiracy is waging totai war against us,

and

1 that the re-establishment of democracy in Cuba is the greatest contribu;

tion we can make now to the sacred cause of world peace, a cause "for which

many, memberk ot Comand os "I" have given their lives

Stand with Comandos "I". Give us your spiritual support and your financial

Your contribution will help provide the solid fin ancial backing neede

war against communism, today firmly entrenched only 90 miles

from your shores.
