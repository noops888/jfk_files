Re: Status of CIA Responses to Assassination Records Review Board's Requests for
Additional Information and Records
Dear John:
I am writing to follow-up on our telephone call earlier today and to convey my serious
concern about the status of CIA's responses to the Review Board's requests for
additional information and records. Although CIA has completed its responses to
several requests, and many others have been answered in part, a significant number of
requests have not been answered - including some that were made more than two
years ago. On many occasions we have been assured that responses would be
forthcoming, only to have promised dates come and go without answers. It is now
extremely important that these requests be answered promptly so that we may conduct
a proper follow-up if necessary. The issues that we can now identify as being of the
highest priority are identified in the text below by double asterisks (**)¹ and we request
that they be answered within the next month. We request that the remaining requests
be answered by April 1, 1998.
The remainder of this letter is divided into two parts: first, a listing of the formal
requests for information and records, and second, a listing of the informal requests for
information and records. Please let me know if your understanding of any of the
following points differs from ours so that we can resolve any potential discrepancies.
'As identified more fully below, the issues are: CIA-1 Organizational Material,
CIA-6 Cables and Dispatches, CIA-13 Backchannel Communications, CIA-IR-03
HTLINGUAL Documents, CIA-IR-04 Disposition of Angleton Files, CIA-IR-07 Claude
Barnes Capehart, CIA-IR-15 Electronic "take" from Mexico City, CIA-IR-21 DRE

Informal Requests
Each of the following informal requests was previously made to CIA. For future
reference, they will be referred to by the "Informal Request" (IR) number provided
below.
CIA-IR-01 Personnel Assigned to Post from 1959-64 (see RIF 104-10065-10199).
This request is complete.
CIA-IR-02 Location of Cable Identified in JFK 1993.07.20.10.18:29:650630.
This request is complete.
**CIA-IR-03 Full Computer Search for List of Documents in HTLINGUAL File.
CIA agreed to undertake a computer run for all HTLINGUAL documents in
April 1997. To date, no response has been received by ARRB. All computer
searches for these documents should be documented in a formal letter for the
record.
**CIA-IR-04 Disposition of Angleton's Files.
The Review Board seeks to ensure that it has taken all reasonable steps to
account for any files that James Jesus Angleton possessed or controlled that
related to the assassination and to Lee Harvey Oswald. Because of the perceived
controversy surrounding the disposition of Angleton's files, the Review Board
believes it prudent to obtain a clear understanding of the types of files that he
maintained and their ultimate disposition. (The Review Board does not seek to
explore any subjects in Angleton's files beyond those that may have pertained to
the assassination.) To date, CIA has made available certain documents provided
by the CIC and the case files for Mangold v. CIA. The Review Board requests any
additional information in the possession of CIA that would explain the
disposition of Angleton's files.
In addition, the ARRB staff's review of the Mangold v. CIA files designated
additional documents from those files as assassination records. These documents
are: Tab D, documents Nos. 95, 109-116, 120, and 121; and from the Denied

(C) First, as an outcome of the Pike and Church Committees, all
HTLINGUAL files were destroyed. Copies that may have been made and put
into individual's files surface as the files are reviewed. The DO ran a
search on the term "HTLINGUAL." Some records were identified as
destroyed. Some were not so marked but are not locatable under the job
number identified; however, given that there is no requirement to record
destroyed records under the federal statutes for disposition programs
and given limited resources for noting files destroyed, this is not
uncommon. The HTLINGUAL search further identified files because of
Freedom of Information Act queries; however, these were not HTLINGUAL
files per se, but files which contained the FOIA requester queries for
HTLINGUAL information.
