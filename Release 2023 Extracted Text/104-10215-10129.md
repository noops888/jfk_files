CI Staff notes that training for VAIVADA 18 scheduled to commenco on

the same date in the same city as the training scheduled for Colonel

PEREZ, and It. CASTANO of the Cuban. BRAC.

This situation seems inherently

dangerous and unwarranted by the circumstances as known to CI Staff.

Pending further Justification CI Staff cannot concur in the training as

requested, but would of course concur in the training for VAlVADA 18 the

locale vers shifted to another city sach as New York.

(This 18 basically an operational

or an operational security matter.

CI/R&A/TRB therefore urges that CI/O*S/WH and CI/OA discuss the problem

with the desk, and resolve it if possible. CI/R&A/TRB will of course

defer to CI/OPS AND CI/OA in this natter.)

Inds aprears extremely rerote as the desk advised there is no indication

that the EliC officers know VAlVidi either is name or sight.

2..

shile VIVADA is being trained, his wife will be attendirz citizen

• ship classes in D.C. preparing for her citizenship examination before

returning to Cuba.

Consequently, It would be a financial drain for TAlViDA

to stay in New York City and his wife in D.û.

In addition, certain per diem

costs would be incurred by the Case. Officer traveling to lew fork City to..

3. The desk will instruct OIR of this joint training aspect and as
