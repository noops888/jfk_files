DUFFY had in his possession a very poor quality

Xerox-type copy of what he claims to be a Government document

request from some Government agency. DUFFY claims he does

not know from what Government agency this document originated.

This copy was furnished to him by the "National Enquirer" to

check out in an effort. to determine the background on SOUETRE,

aka and why such a dangerous man was in Dallas, Texas, on

11/22/63. DUFFY is pursuing the possibility that SOUETRE

was

an assassin in Dallas, Texas, on 11/22/63, and might have

been responsible for the assassination of President KENNEDY.

The copy of the one page document that DUFFY had
