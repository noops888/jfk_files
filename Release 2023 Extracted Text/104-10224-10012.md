MEMORARDOM FOR:

SUB.JECT

: Head of lo Career service

Notification of lion eligibility for Designation as a

Participant In the clo Retiremne and Disability System

As you may know, we are in the process of reviewing the employment

History and current

carder fleld of all employees in

the Axency lo identify

those who are cligible for destonation as a partie pant in the new ClA

Retirement and Disability System.

In this process, the Initial revlow of

each case la made by the individual's career service. If the lead of his

Career Servlee nominates him

for participation lu the System, this nomina-

ton is revlowed by the clA Rottrement Board which recommends final action

to me. lovever, lf the lead of the career Service advises that the employee

does not meet the basle requirements of uR 20-50 for partlespation, I have

this finding without furcher review by the did Retirement Board.

This practice has been

adopted. in the interest of expediting this screening

process eo that those employces who are eligible do particlpate in the Sys-

tein may be designated

participants as soon as posalble.

2.

In your case, the lead of your Career Service las

advised me

you do not meet the requirements

DE HR 20-50 for destgnation

ni i particl

pant and l have accordingly made the formal decerminelon required by the

regulation that you are not aligible for designation.

from a review of your

record li appears that the decision of your Career Service was based upon

the fact that you have 15 yoars or more of Agency service, but have not as

yet performed 60 months of quallying service as required by regulation. My

determination that you are not ellaible it this time for designation in no

way affects your current status under the Clvil Service Retirement System,

nor does it preclude reconsideration of your eligibillty to participate in

the CiA Syatom lf you should meet the requirements for dostgnation in the

future.

Should you desire further information concerning

the roguirements

for designation as a participant in the ClA Retirement system, I suggest that

you read parngraph e of uk 20-50 and paragraph 5 of the limployee Bulletin

dated 30 July 1965, enoltled "Publle Law 88-643, The Contral Intelligence

Agency Retirement Act of 1964 for Cortaln Employees."

I't 1s always possible chat the records upon which the determination

made In your case may have been incomplete or innecurate regarding your nctual

employment history with the Agency.

If, after studying

above, you have

questions regarding the determination that you are not clagi-

ble to partfcipate in the ClA Retirement. System, Please

feel free to contact

officials of your Career Service.

They are familiar with the details of your

case and will gladly discuss them with you.

addition, you may wish to dis-

your case with the CIA Ketirement Staff located in Koom 205, Magazine

Building (extension 2847). If such discussions do not resolve any questions

you have regarding your ellsibility, you may request that your case he fornally

considered by the CIA Retirement Board. However, this request must be made with-

In 30 days of the date of this memorandum.

yaare

1n BR to suporviso i froup of ovar twelvo pooplo performing

a varioty of rosearch functions, ranging fron najor studios to

oporational ilds, on tho RIS; hia approciation of the countor

intolligenco role of tho ngoncy and his furtheranco of our

mission In that respoct by the high standards of excellonce of

hia production; and his vigor 1n anguning and carrying out the

dutlos of a job cornetly hold by a G3-16:

3.

Hr. Migren has beon in grade

for alrost four years.

Ho has

had responalbilitios and porformed dutios far nbove his

grade levol for three of thoso years while donling with practically

all of the DD/P, other agoncies

Intellizonce and socurity sorvicoa.

Ho is an acknowloriged oxport

actorintica possible, doing a job

on a uniquely difficult subjoct,

while using and training parsounol who all too ofton have had

littlo or no background for thoir positions.

3.

In sy opinion, Mr. Wigren is the most quallfied GS-13 In

I endorse the rating officer's contents on Mr. wigren's performance.

One of the

things that ha:

impressed me most during my nine months as Cief of the Counter-

intelligence Staff has been the imprit of

the publications program on the intel-

ligence community at large.

In the Cl field, there is nothing in the U.S.

Government comparable to it.

with the current intensification of interest in

counterintelligence, it affords the fency a means of speaking to a wide audience

on issues and problems of abiding contem.

Mr. Wigren has done excellent work in

drawing upon the resources of the Staft to-collect and then to present counterintel-

ligence materials in a way-calculated to serve their purpose admirably. I have

also drawn-heavily on Mr. Wigren to prevare special briefing materialontifund own

He made solid

progress in

the carly part of the reporting period in miking the trinsition from

sphere he occupied in the provious staft organization to the mich more varied and

challenging duties of the Extemal Branch.

By the time he leit that position he

had mastered its peculiar problems and proven his capability to mmage its unusual

He has rotained responsibility for exploita-

tion of the most usoful asset in that branch and recently conducted the asset on a

scries of linison visits which has resulted in a significant admnce of our Cl reli-

tions with the services concerned.

He has moved vigorously into the function of l'ublications Officer, which is one

of the most important activities in the Stuff.

He was selecter for this assignnent

because of his deep Cl experience, writing ability, and his mature judgment in

selecting ind preparing Cl infonation appropriate to various audiences.

influences which he faces by participation in local government are also

applicd in his Agency work. He deals confidently with senior officers of the staff

forming it.

long experience in Cl matters and his knowledge of past activities and events in the

He is one of very few officers of the former Staff who have, been selected to par-

effort.

He has shown

by his performance and attitude a quite acceptable capability to adjust to the

present Staff requirements in terms of metodology and intellectual approach. He is

conscientious and enthustastic, and is still feeling his way to some extent

in his chosen

In the future Subject will profit from seeking out

opportunities for further activity rather than, as at present, waiting

Subject is a highly effective

wary dependable and resourceful individual. in undertaking the extensive research

cannitments that the staff has undertaken in meeting very heavy obligations of

Mr. Higren is above all a gentle-

In the past sis months the compartmonted nature of Nr. Wigren's work

has brought him more directly into the DC/CIOPS cognizance rather than the

Chief of the R&A component as has previoualy been the case..

I think Mr. Wigren's strengths and weaknesses have bean winnowed

thoroughly in previous reporting. He is a rocognized expert in his tople and as

such he represents a considerable capital investment by the Agency in that kind

"of expertise. He can irite and he can speak with unusual fluency on his specialty

and in consequenco is a key man in the ongoing rosearch and study of sensitive

Soviet intelligence and security organizationi and operations, particularly pone-

Mr. Wigren has organized

this abundance of material effectively, has choured its retrievability, and con-

Mr. Wigren consistently shows sound and dispaysionate judgment. He does

not jump to conclusions but digs out the pertinent ficts and brings them into

proper focus. He is skeptical without being negative. He accupta taske ind

responsibilities without quibbling, and he carries out these absignments suc-

cessfully without needing further consultation or guidance.

He is a quiet person who keeps a low profile; but when a aignificant issue

Amplity or oxploin, il appropriate, ratings given in SECTIONS B, C, and D lo provido the best busis for derermininy

Mr. Wigren has excellent substantive background on the Soviet Union and,

except for a two year period on a WE operations desk, has devoted his entire

9 years in the Agency to research on Soviet Intelligence in one way or another.

His performance for the past year in a job formerly held by GS-14's and 15's

can only be described as superior.

He has not only assumed responsibilities

greater than those of the previous incumbents; he has carried these out with

a minimum of support and in a calm, mature manner which has earned

respect on all sides.. Although his analysts have often been relatively

inexperienced, he has geared their assignments to their capabilities and

subjects designed to increase their competence. His most important contri-

bution during this period has been in the formation of an organized plan of

research in response to Agency and external requirements, and the establish-

ment of improved records and procedures to carry out this program.

Although Mr. Wigren would prefer eventual assignment to the field as an

operational officer, it seems to me his greatest potential lies in the kind of

research and support of operations he is presently performing. I would therefore

recommend that future training be oriented along these lines rather than strictly

operational lines, and that planning for his eventual field assignment should

emphasize his knowledge of Soviet Intelligence and his ability to deal with

other specialists in a "liaison" relation.
