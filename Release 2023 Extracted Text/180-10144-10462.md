Dear Mr. Carpentier:

In connection with its investigation into the

circumstances surrounding the death of President John F.

Kennedy, the Select Committee on Assassinations requests

access to the personnel files of present and former CIA

employees who were recently interviewed by Staff Investi-

gator Harold D. Leap to determine the exact period of

time the individuals were stationed in Japan between 1959

and 1964.

The list of names will be submitted at a later

date under separate cover.

The information requested is important to sub-

stantiate or discredit certain allegations that are of

concern to this Committee.

Sincerely,

12. Dobet Blaby

G. Robert Blakey

Chief Counsel and Director
