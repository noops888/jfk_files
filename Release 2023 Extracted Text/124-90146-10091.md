More recently

ANDERSSON came to special notice for his close contacts with

the CHICOM embassy in Switzerland, particularly with IAO Hain,

In April 1963 it was learned that ANDERSSON

The FPCC has been supported by the Socialist Workers Party (SWP)

and Gibson has busied himself as well with other front groups in the

United States supported by the SWP. (The Socialist Workers Party has

been designated by the Attorney General of the United States pursuant

to Executive Order 10450.)

b. Gibson apparently began to lose interest in the FPCC, partly

because of inadequate pay and operating funds, by the spring of

1962 when he stated that he intended to leave the organization in

the fall. Gibson left Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, in September 1962

for Algeria where he planned to work as a journalist for several

South American and European newspapers (none identified) and to

travel to Morocco, Ghana, Guinea and Mali before returning to the

United States.

Eventually, both Gibson and his wife were given
