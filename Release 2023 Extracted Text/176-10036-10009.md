did not understand guarantees that had been given.

At this point Adoula stated if Tshombe returns to Leopoldville,

he will give him every guarantee of security, but Tshombe and

delegation must be confined to Royal building and only allowed

leave it to go to meeting. Also no one would be permitted

visit Ishombe. With reference Ishombe's doctor, Adoula noted

latter is still under expulsion order dating from pre-independ-

ence time and questioned that Tshombe really sick. Kasavubu

reiterated importance of excluding foreign influences in talks

and. added action should be taken to implement SC resolutions

on ousting of mercenaries and prevention of arms shipments into

Katanga. Gardiner noted physical impossibility for UN with

present forces to fully control lengthy Katangan border despite

best efforts.

Kasabubu voiced growing anxiety over Belgians who he thought

were a real danger to Congo and should not be trusted until

certain problems between Congo and Belgium settled. He requested

UN not employ any Belgians in Congo and stated categgrically his

government would cease all collaboration with UN if a Belgian

were employed by the UN in a responsible capacity. Adoula

interjected that it most important to liquidate the past so far

as Belgium concerned and to devise forms of cooperation with

Belgium and other countries. He stated Congo wants to prove

to Belgium that "we can live very well without them"
