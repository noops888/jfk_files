20 December 1973

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: E. Howard Hunt

- 1. I phoned Paul Burns, Special Assistant to the DDO, and

said that we had some leads that could be followed by whoever has

the action in the DDO in tracking down Hunt's activities during the

fall of 1964, when he was alleged to have been engaged in surveillance

activities of Barry Goldwater.

2. I said that our files showed Hunt was in DO Division (Burns

was not familiar with that title,

but recognized it as the predecessor

of FR Division) and in August 1964 was assigned to the Washington

field office.

I suggested that Stan Gaines, who was Deputy Division

Chief of DO Division and now DCOS Bonn, might be in a position to

give a few groups on what Hunt was supposed to be doing then. I

suggested that he be queried by cable.

Burns said Gaines is staying

on under contract for a while, so would continue to be available.

3. I said that Fig Coleman was on the Iberian desk when the

Hunt assignment to Madrid was brought up in 1964 and when Hunt

went: to the field in 1965.. He could give the background on the assign-

ment, which seems to have been through Karamessines at Helms'

direction. His recollection would give leads. I told him that Coleman

became COS Madrid later, after Hunt left Spain, and could provide

information on what Hunt did not do for the Agency during that period.

I suggested that both Helms and Karamessines

should be queried.

I gave as a possible press treatment that Hunt was engaged in

domestic operations (something Senator Baker is pursuing) and that

his assignment to Spain after the clection could be presented as giving

him time to cool off. I thought we had to pursue tbe matter to be

sure we know the facts.

I asked Burns to be sure that we are on information distribution

of cables to the field on this, given our assigned responsibility for

keeping files on Watergate.

He said we are on the PLMHPLANK for

messages to Helms.. He would advise the action officer. I said we are

available, for any help we can give.

SUBJECT

: Watergate File Research - Final Report

The files of the immediate office of the Chief. OPS/OSG

have been checked for material relevant to the subject of this

memorandum.

The check included chronological files. of communi-

cations of which I was the author while assigned to Madrid, Spain

in the period July 1970 to. July 1973: Nothing pertinent was found.

I have attempted to recollect any other details which

conceivably could be pertinent and which relate to the period

of my assignment to Madrid.

The only points which I recall but

on. which. I have no documentation are these:

There were occasional joshing Inquiries made of me

by American residents of Madrid about the reported presence

in Spain of E. Howärd Hunt in 1972. My standard reply was

that I knew only what I had heard rumored.

at no time did Hunt contact me, and I have never known of his

having tried to contact any Station personnel in Spain during

the period 1970-73.

whether or not Hunt was in Spain, and I had no effort made by.

any Station member.

b:

A Station officer, possibly Richard Ouderkirk, now

assignéd to Guatemala, was given some

information by an

informant in 1972 concerning reported activities in spain

by Robert Vesco.

I suggested that the information be given

informally to the Embassy's Economic Section chief, John

Oliver.

That officer was charged with keeping abreäst of

developments related to Vesco.

The Station did not pursue

that subject, as frecall, because it was not a topic of

reportable interest, according to requirements of the period.

At the recent request of the Deputy Director for

Management and Services, the Office of Finance has searched

its records to determine if we could find any payment to

Mr. Hunt in an amount of approximately $30,000 that required

no accounting.

2. We have searched the following records:

a. The expense runs for the period July 1964 to

the immediate Office of the dCI,

the immediate Office of the DD/P, FI Staff

We have checked various items that were re-

determined that $33,500 was advanced to him

for travel

and transportation of household

goods

to and from Madrid with one trip to

Paris for he and. his family to renew their

Spanish visas.

All of this advance was fully

accounted for. However, in his accounting,

one item appeared unusual.

It was an

expenditure of $1,600 for a sensitive

operation which was approved for write-off by Mr.

Desmond Fitzgerald on 1 June 1966 without

further

accounting.

Also, we confirmed that no other Agency advance accounts

were

established for Mr. Hunt during this period.

4.

At the beginning of his non-official cover tou ine

it

was necessary to establish a bank account in his name.

Chase, Manhattan Bank in Mr.

Hunt's name to receive all non-

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: E. Howard Hunt

1 9141 6.79.0

1. I spoke with. Fig Coleman about Hunt's

assignment to Spain.

I had spoken with him back in August when we were inquiring into

reported activities involving Mrs. Hunt....

2. Coleman said that he got out of the War College in May 1964

(by which he fixed the time), and took over the Iberian desk. Bill

Ryạn was C/EUR (of was it WE Division at the time). In early autumn

Ryan said that he had just been informed by the DDP (Karamessines)

that Hunt was to be assigned to Madrid as DCOS, as a directed assign-

-ment by Heims. A memo was prepared and sent to the COS, Jim Noel

(now retired). There was nothing further for about a month when Ryan

called Coleman in and showed him & RYBAT letter from Noel stating

that Ambassador Stanley J. Woodward would not have Hunt in the

Embassy.

3.

Woodward had been the Ambassador to Uruguay when Hurt

was COS Montevideo. He had a low opinion of Hunt and was counting

the days until Hunt left. The President of Uruguay visited President

Eisenhower in the States, at which time le requested a personal favor

that Hunt be reassigned to Montevideo. - So Hunt took another tour.

Woodward was outraged, and had his revenge in 196% when Hunt was

to be sent.as DCOS to Madrid.

After a couple of months--carly 1965--Ryan called Coleman

in and, observing that there was more than one way to skin a cạt,

told him that Hunt was going to Spain under nonofficial cover. This

didn't require anything special, Ryan saying that he didn't know

much about it. It came to him from Karamessines on Helms' order.

Hunt was to have the telephone number of the COS, but he would do

nothing for the station. Hunt was to submit administrative vouchers

for reimbursement of his expenses and they were to be paid. Coleman

said he never saw Hunt before he went out. He knows that there was

no operational reporting, to indicate that Hunt was doing anything:

---

## Page 9

14-00000

CONRESENTAL

The vouchers were not large, although the documentation was poor.

Coleman ralsed the question with Ryan about his signing off, and

Ryan said he could talk to Karamessines it ho wished.

Because

Coleman had a close personal association with karamessines he:

did just that. He was told by Karamessines that he didn't know much

"about it eithor--"Helms said send him out." He was instrucied to go

ahcad..

sri

In carly July 1966 (4 July) Coleman went to Madrid, He

had a ten day turnover with Jim Noel. Hunt had already gone and

he did not see him. Noel said he didn't know what Hunt did, but

that Coloman need not worry because he was gone.

6.

Several months ago Noel was at a seminar at which

Ambassador Woodward was also present.

At the time he asked

about Hunt.

Woodward said it might still be dragged into the press.

Tad Szulc had been after Woodward about the Hunt assignment to

Spain. Coleman observed that Szule did have a long article on Hunt

in the New York Times, and the Spain assignment ivas mentioned,...

but without any conclusions as to its significance.

7. Coleman said the RYBAT file of C/EUR may have something on

the event, but not much. A letter out and the reply, but not much more.

for this effort within the Western European Division

were totally unaware of it.

Nr. Pyan stated that nost of his knowledye of

Hunt's activity and the nature of his assiunnent

SUBJECT: Conversation with Sam Halpern

1.: 1 met with Sam Halpern for about 20 minutes this morning

in GG10, where he is cleaning up some details before he goos to

his new aggignment as DC/DCD. I told him generally about our

attempt to reconstruct Howard Hunt's assignments and financial

transactions, and asked him particularly for recollections he may

have öl Hunt's assignment in Spain in mid-1965 to the fall of 1966.

Halpern said that he tas no recollection about such an

assignment.

In June 1965 he moved from WH Division with Des

FitzGeräld when he became the DD/P. At about that time

Halpern's father died and he las in New York for the funeral

and ten days of religious observations following thai." He was back

in mid-June. and in and out from then on as he got ready to attend

the National War College which began in August. He did not roturn

to that office until the end of June 1966.

Halpern observed that during this period Karamessines

was ADDP with Helms moving up to ba DDCI. He thought it entirely

possible that Helms and Karamessines could have handled this

on their own.

4.

Halpern said that Evan Parker had come inio the office

of the DD/P shortly before Helms became DDCI, and had returned

from Honolulu for that purpose. He stajed on for fit Gerald until

Halpern returned from the National War College.

He suggested

someone might talk to Evan Parker who may have known something

abnut il (although ha may not). He also suggested talking to Georgia.

In response to a question

as to whether or not executive level: interest was still

with dr.

Hunt while at the Millen Coupany

on a continuing

basis, because Me. O'Balley as interested in dir. Hunt

for possible refcrial of utier dyency retirees.

Mr.

nercial Siaff interest in the Mullen Conpany, and that

Mr. Hunt became

instrumental in discussing screral aspects

of the cover operations in his capacity as an officer of

the conpany.

Mr. O'Malley recalled referring various

Agency officers to Mr. Hunt for guidance when these indi-

viduals expressed an interest in

entering the puolic

relations field.

Mr. O'Malley did recall disappointent

in feeling Mr. Hunt had generaily been less helpful on

these occasions.

Mir: Hunt contacted Mr. O'Malley on several occasions

requesting referral of retiring Agency employees with

specific qualifications.

These instances occurred apparent-

1y after Mr. Hunt had assumed his responsibilities with

the White House.

ferral of a

recently retired Agency secretary.

previous memoranda and discussions, Mr. O'Malley was unable

to recall the name of this individual..

He did, however,

state that he is quite certain Mr. Hunt turned down the

individual whom he referred.

As a point of clarification,

Pit. O'Malley said that this individual had not previously

been known to Mr. Hunt, nor had she previously worked

for him in

Nr. O'Malley also recalled a

request from Mr. liunt for an individual having skilis in

area of locks and surreptitious entry.

A resume of

Mr. Thomas C. Amato was provided to Mr. Hunt at that time.

ro. O'Malley

Nir. O'Malloy

then suggested the use ot anderson Socurity Consultants,

Incorporated, a commercial cover entity of the Office of

Securit).

Nr. O'Malley stated that insofar as this

organization was advertised in the yeilor pages

and that

Mr. Hunt could be assured of the reliability of the ser-

vices, he felt this to be a reasonable suggestion.

O'Malle) stated that during a subsequent phone call when

Mir. O'Malley asked how his suggestion had worled out,

dr. Hurt responded,

"Yes, they had done a fine job."

At this point Mr. O'Malley was asked whether or not from

his associations with Mr. Hunt he felt. Nr. Hunt was in

the habit of naking glib connents which were not neces-

sarily accurate

in order to pass over a subject. Mr.

O'Malley stated that this was categorically so. He said

he was sure that Nr. Hunt had lied to him on a number of

occasions and that, therefors, he was in no position to

• be sure that Mr. funt had

actually, in fact, used the

services of Anderson Security Consultants.

Mr. O'Malley

volunteered the opinion that he suspected the clectronic

countermeasures

"sweep"' was to be carried out in the offices

of the Committée

to Re-elect the President.

7.

In response to a quastion as to whether he had

ever

referred anyone

to NcCord Associates,

Me. O'Malley

replied that he remembered having referred walter Brayden.

Air:

Brayden for a time acted as bodyguard to Mrs. Martha

snitchell.

As an aside Mr. O'Malley mentioned that Mr.

Brayden had refused to carry a firearn in spite of the

fact that Mr. McCord told hin he could do so on the author-

ity of the Attorney General.

Asked specifically if he had

ever referred either Willian Sliea or Teresa Shea to Mr.

ReCord, Mr. O'Nalley stated that he did not recall specif-

ically icterring Teresa Shea and that he was sure that he

had not' roferred Willian Shea to hin.

So; contrary to

previous statements, it is now Mr. O'Malley's belief that

in all probability Mrs. Shea

was not refcred by this

agency to Mr. McCord.

During this interview MT. Rocca was specifically

askad whether or not he had knonledge of the existence of

any form of official sponsorship or encouragement to Mr.

E. Honard Hunt to writo novels to inprove the imags of

this Agency.

Additionally, Mr. Rocca was asked whether

ox not any

that staff had ever had any relationship

with Mr. Hunt whatsoover.

Mr.

Rocca stated that the particular section which he had been

of "setting the rocord straighi."

in this senso,

the "image"

nission of the offica was to countor nisinfornation: cur-

rently in tha media or othervise believed to be part of an

effort tó discredit the Agency.

dr. Rocca fauls that any

assumption that Mr. Hunt was engaged in aay form of Agency

sponsored inags activity would have probably load to the

conclusion that it was done under the Counter Intolligence

Operations.

Howover, Mr. Rocca enphatically stated that

this was not the caso.

Mr. Rocca was thoroughly candid and cooporativo

do was unable to

exist.

Mr. Rocca

did venture the opinion

that he folt

that in all probability an official acquiescence on tho

part of sonior officials might have been involved rathor

than an official sponsorship.

It was agrood by all lo

MEMORANDUMI FOR: MI. Kuhn

SUBJECT: General Gaynor's Recollections

This data, at your instruction, I called Gen. Paul F. Gaynor

to seek his recollections regarding his knowledge of the writings of

Mr. 'Hunt and any official who might be aware of the circumstances

of any Agency involvement in that effort.

2. Gen. Gaynor advised that his memory is not altogether clear

on the matter, and that he was "reaching," but stated that has he

reconstructs the matter:

a. He became aware that Hunt, while in WII, was accomplishing

a steady flow of spy books, and that security approval was not being re-

quested on the manuscripts before submission to publishers. Me stated

that this acticity continued later,

as he recalls it, in CI Staff, and

• agreed with idca that the volume of writings was sufficient to indicate

that a great of time was involved in Hunt's writing.) Gen. Gaynor advised

that he raised the issue "up front" on several occasions. The reaction

he recieved to his raising the issue was that "Keop your stinking nose out

of this business." He stated that he was lead to balieve that Mi. Helms

desired to improve the image of the intelligence profession and the Agency

and that Hunt's books were a part of the program to do so. He stated that

he was never told outright that this was the case, but the responses he

recieved lead him to belicve this was the case.

b.

He suggested that tivo people might be able to assist in clearing

the issue, Ray Rocca and Walter Piorzheimer, both of whom were involved

in the "image" materials. He stated that Piorzheimer secmed to be aware

of all the details - on an up to date basis - of tuat's departure from the:

Agency to join the public relations firm, to the degree that Gon. Gaynor

gained the belie! that Hunt was merely moving his dosk outside the building,

but being paid by the same source as before.

He also advised that he kept

Miss Ethel Mendoza fairly current on what he was learning about Hunt's

activities because she followed the case for him, and suggested that her

recall aboat what he had learned and when and what resulted, might be:

better than his ai this date.

(He also mentioned an incident in which dorse

allen while on a TDY was told by a COS to ask Headquarters to remora Hunt

from the Aren because of his direct liaison with the presilunt of the country.

aid other activities which were confounding station operations. Later, the CUS

SUBJECT:

Terence S. CRABANAC - Retention of

Royalties by a Contract Employee

1. You have requested the opinion of this Office in regard to

the reiention of future royalties which might be carned by Terence S.

CRABANAC as a Icsult of his literary efforts. We believe that he is

entitled to retain such royalties withou an offset against his Agency

salary.

We have been advised by Mr. Gene Stevens, WE/Support, that

CRABANAC's cover does not include the role of a writer; CRABANAG'S

cover for status will only be a light ons of a retired Foreign Service

Therefore, paragraph 7 of his contraci dated 4 Jily 1965 may

remain as written. Royalties from the fictional works that he writes as

a profitable hobby will not ba emoluments received from or through his

'"cover activities."
