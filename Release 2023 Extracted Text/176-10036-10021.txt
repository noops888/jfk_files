LIMIT DISTRIBUTION S/S
In discussion with UK Consul Dodson and myself last night,
local UN representative Mathu bitterly criticized local In-
dian UN commander who he claimed "wanted start fighting so they
could kill blacks and go back home with decorations". Dwelt
particularly on September 12 patrol incident and October 8
Post Office patrol affair (CONTEL 569). Said he considered
substance UN communiques both these occasions (which he signed)
untruthful. I told Mathu that information on which Noronha
acted night of October 8 was from Consulate sources FYI CAS
END FYI and that did not consider, given character of infor-
mation, that we had any real choice but to pass it on rapidly
as possibly correct or Noronha any choice but to act on it
same basis. Said did not believe slightest intention Noronha's
part provoke incident.
:
Mathu said he glad learn these supplementary facts which In-
dians had not given him. However, he then resumed criticism
of Indians, claiming they told him nothing and harbored secret
designs.
It obvious Mathu smarting under criticism from Gardiner during
recent visit on failure maintain upper hand over UN military
here and similar criticism from Bunche, who apparently sent
Gardiner telegram after Post Office affair asking whether
Mathu boss in Elisabethville or Indians. As Consulate report-
ing as indicated, charge that Mathu has not firmly established

control over UN military, especially Indians, and that this
is evidenced in their repeated failure to inform him promptly
and fully, is well based. Believe Gardiner-Bunche approach at
this point will help stiffen Mathu and tone down Indians.
However, aside from overly professional military posture on
which we have commented, have seen no evidence here during
past two months to justify charge of separate aggressive In-
dian policy on part local Indian officers. As frequently,
outbreak of dispute over civilian control of military reflects
differing capacities of individuals involved. In addition,
as previously noted, Mathu lacks organizational back-up to
cope with tight, professional Indian staff.
Further, believe as stated Noronha patrol action October 8
justified by circumstances and in no sense evidence of aggres-
sive intent. Should note that attempt was made pass same
information Mathu but no answer (Mathu says previously unable
hear phone from library at night, had phone installed bedroom
two days ago) and that though Indian patrol stationary rather
than mobile, men did not descent from trucks, take up positions,
or otherwise act in menacing way. Noronha may have had obli-
gation make further effort reach Mathu before ordering patrol
but was late at night and operational requirement was immed-
iate. He made typical error, however, of not fully informing
Mathu of patrol until 1700 next day.
Above for background only; as far as local situation concerned,
do not believe Mathu will at this time take action aggravating
personal relations now that has blown off steam. Possible
Embassy Leopoldville and USUN may wish consider giving Gardiner
and Bunche further details background October 8 patrol if they
believe this would reduce unnecessary friction among UN com-
ponents.
