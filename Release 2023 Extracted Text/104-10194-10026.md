Mi. David A. Phillips

8224 Stone Trail Drive

Bethesda, Maryland 20031

Dear Dave:

The ordinary retirement letter is in no way

appropriato

for you.

In the first place, your

retirement is no stepping out of the active world

into a world of pleasure.

Instead, you are launch-

ing off on even a tougher challenge because of your

sense of dedication.

Your retirement also will not

be the termination of your interest

in intelligence

and in

this Agency.

Instead, you are going to be

doing what you can

to help it survivo the current

set of attacks upon It.

But most of all, your

rotirement is the departure of one of our most

exceptional officers,

to whom I had the great

pleasure to give the Distinguished Intelligence Medal

and whose work I have admired these many years.

The

only thing ordinary about your Ictirement is the

and special personal and official good wishes

we in the Agency send to you and your family for

success and satisfaction in the years ahead. This

wa send to all our retirees, and we send it to you

special spirit.

Sincerely,

silico

Dear Dave:

I thought you would be pleased about a reference to you which

came up in the course of i longish conversation last night with

about the turbulent events

In his country three years ago.

"Youknow," ho said, "looking back over those months when

things seemed pretty bleak, two names come immediately to mind

as able and effoctive representatives of the United States. They

are Ellsworth Bunker and David Phillips. "

'I thought such a pleasant echo of a rough period would help

heal your ulcers.

MEMORANDUM FOR:

THROUGH

SUBJECT

REFERENCE

: Notification of Designation as a Participant in the Organization

Retirement and Disability System

: Book DIspatch 5098 dated 12 August 1965

•1. You have been found to be qualified as a participant in the Organization Retirement

and Disability System and have been so designated effective 23 October 1966.

2. Although such designation under present statutes is viewed favorably by most persons,

the regulation governing this retirement system gives the individual the right to appeal such

& determination if he deems the designation adverse to his best interests. In order that this

technical requircment may be satisfied, you are herby notified of your right to appeal.

An

appeal with

reasons therefore must be. reccived in Headquarters within 60 days of the date of

this memorandum or acceptance of designation will be assumed.

Any questions that you may

have in connection with your designation that cannot be answered by reterring to referenced

Book Dispatch should be forwarded to Headquarters.

3. We believe that the benefts of the Organization Retirement System are superior to the

benefts of the Civil Service Retirement System. However, there are a few situations in which

an employee.at the lime of retirement may have so many years of service (almost 37) that he

would receive a higher annuity under the Civil Service System. Because of this, the polley

decision has been made that a particlpant in the Organization System who would recclve a

higher annulty under the Civil Service System may, not later than one year prior to his retire-

ment, apply to be removed from our system and transferred to the Civil Service Systemn.

Thus,

you should not anticipate this contingency as a factor in deciding whether you regard your

designation as a participant adverse to your best interests.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, WH Division

THROUGH

SUBJECT

: Deputy Director for Plans

: Commendation

1. • The Dominican Republic Station has distinguished itself by

especially meritorious service during the past year and has made

• a major contribution toward the advancement of the objectives of

the United States Government in a critical situation. One year ago

the people of the Dominican Republic were facing a dismal future.

Today, while the future remains uncertain, the prospects for even-

tual stability have been immeasurably increased. Several Depart-

ments and Agencies of the United States Government engaged in an

effort to bring this about. I believe that the role of the CIA in the

Dominican Republic during the past year was a crucial one.

The

highly effective performance of the Santo Domingo Station and the

Base at Santiago was the result of the combined efforts of each offi-

cer and employee stationed there.

These men and women gave un-

sparingly of their time, energy and brain power. Their efforts

were sustained

over a long period under stressful circumstances.

Now, while our long-term mission continues, a significant mile-

• stone has been reached and it is most appropriate at this time to

grant this special recognition for a job well done to all membere

of the CIA team in the Dominican Republic during the year ending

June 30, 1966.

2. I should like to commend each member of the Station who

contributed to this noteworthy performance and request that a copy

of this commendation be placed in individual personnel files as ap-

propriate.

: Darid A. Phillips

SUBJECT: TDY in the Dominican Republic

Most of you who went down to the Domirican Republic

departed

with so much speed and so little ceremony that

there was no time to explain the importance and urgency

•of your assignments.

Non that you have served there

during the crisis,

the inportance of the task needs no

embellishment from us, but you should knew that the con-

tribution of the augmented Station was decisive in shaping

the policies

and actions of the government and in avoiding

several majoi mistakes." For weeks after the April revolu-

tion,

our Station reporting was literally the only source

of information

that the l'nited States had on the role of

Communism

among the rebel forces and on conditions outside

•the capital.

Many fine things were done in the Station and in the

hinterland by all of you.

lanning the check-points under

fire, flying to remote and hostile villages, moving tons

of supplies through the gauntlet of the communications

line, tolling over midnight reports, and keeping open our

country's only commo link -- all these things were common.

place.

The dedication, discipline, and routine of our

personnel placed them in a class apart.

already feel,

of the DDP and of the Agency.

SECTION D

• NARRATIVE COMMENTS

In the period covered by this report Mr. Phillips was the Chief of

Station Brazilia during the time frame February to August 1,972. After that

Mr. Phillips became the Chief of Station, Caracas and served in Venezuela

during the period August 1972 to April 1973. At both of these posts Mr.

Phillips was responsible for managing an average of Agency employees.

Additionally, Mr. Phillips supervised in this period an average FY budget of

which was spent on FI, CA, Cl, anti-narcotics and protected

economic intelligence operations. American policy interests in Brazil and

Venezuela are high in terms of the United States scale of values for Latin

America. This means that Mr. Phillips was assigned to two prestige posts

during a fifteen month time span.

As a manager Mr. Phillipe is operations oriented. In view of this he

placee his time, attention and command emphasis on programs that are de-

signed to acquire intelligence and agents. This approach has consistently

produced results in terms of El and CA operations which are targcted against

the host. country.

3. Mr. Phillips was also active at both posts as an operations nanager

-who focused Station resources on the Soviet target, protected economic in-

telligence and the anti-narcotics effort.

Unfortunately, as these programs

moved into gear Mr. Phillips was also in motion between Stations, or had

just been in place at his second Station for less than a year. As a result one

can only say that Mr. Phillips made all the right moves in his managerial

duties against these priorily targets.

The brevity of his program imple-

mentation at each of the two posts did not provide a solid basis, however, for

measuring tangible succesa. In short Mr. Phillips deserves high marks for

initiative, drive and imagination on programs that were roceiving increased

attention at Headquarters.

4. Thr rnyriad problems that are faced when a Station moves its location.

from one city to another were still challenging Mr. Phillips when he left

Brasilia. In overview terms, however, the move from Rio de Janerio to

Brasilia was well done. This does not mean that Mr. Phillips' successor at

Brasilia did not have some gaps to fill or adjustments to make in the admini-

strative field. The scope of these actions, however, was in the realm of the

reasonable and attests to the fact that while his basic interests are in

SECRET

- 2-

operations, administration per se is not a totally alien field to Mr. Phillips.

5. Ir representational termis Mr. Phillips did a sound job in winning

and maintaining the respect of the American Arbassadors in Brazil and

Venezuela.

This is due in large measure to Mr. Phillips' native charm,

area knowledge, and language skills in Spanish and Portuguese. In addition,

Mr. Phillips is people oriented, and this makes it possible for him to sell

himself and CIA to senior American officials at the Ambassador level.

6. In personal terms Mi. Phillips is a hard-wolking, dedicated officer

who is a good team player. This officer has the intent, capability and desire

to fulfill the needs of the Organization. He is particularly well versed in CA

skills and is politically oriented. As a result he likes the challenge of election

operations and is well qualified in this area.

7. Mr. Phillips' total performance during the period covered by this

report merits an evaluation of Strong.

8. In terms of future assignments Mr. Phillips is likely to be at his pro-

¿essional best in field activities.

This officer is highly specialized in Latin

American affairs, but he is perfectly capable of being a Station Chief at most

Agency posts in Europe or Asia.

9. Mr. Phillips' activities come to the attention of the Rating Officer

on a daily basis.

SUBJECT:

David A. Phillips

1 July - 31 December 1971

This memorandum is in lieu of a fitness report to

cover Mr. Phillips' performance during the period 1 July

to 31. December 1971. This rating is being prepared in

view of the rater's imminent departure from the Division.

Last month Mr. Phillips was promoted from GS-16

to GS-17. There is no better evidence uf the high esteem

in which he is held by his superiors in the Agency.

During this rating period Mr. Phillips transferred

the station irom Rio de Jáneiro to Brasilia. This move,

however, divorces the Chief of Station from the main area

of operations, Rio de Janeiro. In spite of this Mr. Phillips,

through much extra effort and time on his part, has been

able to maintain a high operational tempo in the station.

MEMORANDUM IN LIEU OF FITNESS REPORT

SUBJECT: Mr. David A. Phillips

1 April 1970 - 30 June 1971

This memorandum is in licu of the fitness report on Mr.

Phillips as Chief of Station; Rio de Janeiro, during the period

1 April 1970 to 30 June 1971.

=:.

Mr. Phillips is a highly capable, versatile and imaginative

Opcrations Officer and manager who makes a substantial contri-

bution to the Clandestine Service.

The above statement is borne out by the fact that faced with

a highly difficult, sensitive operational problem of the utmost

priority in the fall of 1970, the Rater immediately thought of

Mr. Phillips as the man to head the Task Force and received

immediate and enthusiastic endorsement from the Deputy Director

for Plans and the Director for Mr. Phillips' assignment. He

was recalled from Brazil, took over the Task Force, and handled

it in an outstanding manner.

My first statement is further borne out by the fact that

Ambassador Rountree, on a recent visit to Washingtor, made

a special effort to express to the Rater his appreciation for

Mr. Phillips' support to him and the Embassy and to express

further his appreciation to the Agency for furnishing him a man

of Mr. Phillips' caliber.

MEMORANDUM IN LIEU OF FITNESS KEPORT

SURJECT:

Mr. David A. Phillips

1 April 1969 - 31 March 1970

This memorandum is in lieu of the fitness report un

Mr. David A. Phillips as Chief of Station, Rio de Janciro,

during the period 1 April 1969 to.31 March 1970.

During this period Mr. Phillips took over command of

the Rio Station. It is typical of Mr. Phillips that he made

excellent preparation for this assigament, including a full-

time course in the Portuguese language.

Mr. Phillips has brought to his new position the opera-

tional zeal and enthusiasm that has characterized all of his

previous positions. Brazil, by the very nature of its size but,

more importantly, the type of "strait jackel' government in

poser, is à difficult place to operate on a hroad plain. Mr.

Phillips has the station moving and real effort and progress is

seen on the more difficult targets, such as the Soviets.

He has excellent relations within the embassy and is

recognized for his contribution to the Country Team. He, of

course, handles his haison contacts with mature style and is

very actively developing a number of contacts in the local

community.

Mr. Phillips is a good supervisor of men and the

MEMORANDUM IN LIEU OF FITNESS REPORT

SUBJECT:

Mr. David A. Phillips

1 April 1968 to 31 March 1969

Mr. Phillips continues to head the Division's program

against the high-priority Cuban target, although he has also been

selected to fill an unusually responsible job overseas in the

coming year, both of which jobs testify to the high regard in which

he is held by his superiors in the Agency. Mr. Phillips has had

the difficult task of presiding over a show which is being cut back,

in terms of money and people, and in which task he has played a

major role. At the same time as doing a pruning job, he has had

to try to maintain a vigoroue program and to keep up enthusiasm.

His own qualities of personal leadership and of magnetism have

done a great deal to keep up enthusiasm among his people. He has

a positive attitude toward operations and is determined; his day-

to-day concern is for developing new operations, and he has put

all of his own notable vigor and drive into operational directions.

Mr. Phillips knows his target and knows Latin America

well and he brings a good feel and insight into his work, which is

never pedestrian or unimaginative. He speaks well and convinc-

ingly and makes a very good impression both within the Agency and

outside, where he serves the Agency well in his relations with

other government elements. He als writes notably well.

His task this year has not been easy for he has had to deal

with an experimental situation, to a considerable extent, with the

new Miami station which he is responsible for supporting and

guiding. He has had to exercise a good deal of tact and diplomacy

in the doing of it and he has done a good job of reconciling often

conflicting views. He has shown a good head for costs in all of

this.

---

## Page 156

14.00000

= 2 -

Mr. Phillips is a notably good supervisor, especially

with younger officers, for whom he is an object of admiration

and emulation.

Mr. Phillips is a fast-moving, energetic person

and he has some of the laults that often go with this virtue; he is

impatient with details and "paper" with the consequence that if

someone else does not do it for him, his work is sometimes

marred by inaccuracies and imprecisions.

Without going into it, it should be noted that Mr. Phillips

has had a very trying year personally and it is a proos of his

trength of character that he has not only come through it but ha:

ardly broken his stride in carrying out a demanding job, or being

any less than his usual cheerful and charming self.

His performance has been very Strong.

Mr. Phillips is an able officer and a highly cooperative member

of the Country Team. I have been impressed and pleased with the

degree of cooperation which exists between him and other members of

the Embassy staff.

He has, to the extent that is possible considering

the nature of his work, cooperated in our efforts to bring about

maximum coordination of reporting.

With rare exceptions he has, I

belleve, kept me appropriately advised on all matters relating to his

functions, and the material which he provides on a regular basis has

been extremely useful in the discharge of my mission.

Mr. Phillips' performance during the four months covered by this

evaluation has been highly satisfactory. For some years previous to

my arrival here, in June 1970, I had been acquainted with him, and

from this I already had a favorable impression of his qualities. This

impression has continued and has improved further.

He has worked

His interest in his work, and his dedication to the job,

Phillips has been here too short a time and there has been too little

opportunity for us to work together for me to be able to discuss his

performance in detail. I am able to say, however, that he has

'impressed me and other Embassy officers with whom he works, Including

Ambassador Elbrick, very favorably, indeed. He 1s a cool-headed,

straightforward, intelligent man who seems professionally vers

He has a clear understanding of the appropriate role for

hinself and his organization within the Embassy and is working to

achieve a genuinely low profile.

He has already demonstrated his

interest in the best possible relations with the rest of the U.s.

covernment organization and he knows how to act in order to achieve

such a relationship. He has come to me a number of times to volunteer

detailed information which he did not feel important enough to bother

the Ambassador about, but he has kept the Ambassador fully informed

about all those subjects which were of sufficient interest to him.

I see every reason to assume that he will be a positive, constructive

and very dependable and reliable factor in the Embassy.

Mrs. Phillips is an attractive and personable young lady who has

particularly impressed wy wife and me with her attitude and intellect.

I have been associated with the CAS Station Chief since my arrival

• at this post on January 11, 1966, Inasmuch as I have kept in very close

daily touch with him, I believe that I am in position to evaluate his

performance.

Let me say at the outset that the Rated Officer has had to work

• under the most varied and difficult circumstances.

His service at

this post began, for example, in a revolutionary situation marked by

great and continuing violerce.

The attention of a good part of the

world was focused upon this situation, ane some of the highest national

interests of the United States were involved. The presence of the

Inter-American Peace Force, of its major U.S. component, and of

Ambassador Ellsworth Bunker in his unusual and unprecedented role

added greatly. to the dimensions of the work done by the Rated Officer.

in the aftermath of revolution, he had unusual, delicate and complicated

tasks to perform in connection with the establishment and maintenance

in power of a most fragile Provisional Government.

As the latter

carried the nation toward the all-important election scheduled for

June 1, 1966, the CAS Station Chief faced a changing and constantly

Finally, his tour of duty at this

post has encompassed the transition from the Provisional Government

• to a constitutional government emerging from those elections and the

gradual firming up of the position and institutions of the present

To this intricate complex of circumstances, the CAS Station Chief

has brought a background knowledge of the Latin

American area and its

to deal readily and effectively with a heterogeneous range of

cortacts.

His performance: can only be described as outstanding. He

has provided a completely professional response to a post diffi

provided a mechanism fully up to the tasks. confronting it and

the high-level requirements levied upon it.

With the advantages

evidenced the highest degree of cooperation

with representatives of State, DOD, Legal Attaché, AID (in the

sector) and all other members öf the Country Team.

His quiet and protessional approach inspires their confidence,

and on innunerable occasions he has proven that he is an excellent

team player who genuinely wants to be of assistance to all members

of the official community. The harmonious, close relations anong

all the intelligence components of the Country Team are due in

great part to the tactful, skillful and thoughtful leadership of

the Station Chief.

probably little need for me to comment uoon the

Rated Officer's technical achievements at this post.

Under his

guidance, specialized security agencies of the Dominican

Government have been brought to a state of high readiness.

Penetration of subversive groups has reached impressive propor-

Subversive docunent seizures have been abundant. Counter-

espionage work has been impressively successful.

The CAS Station Chief is in/sense a narrow technician or

specialist. He keeps his eye on the broad picture, understands

what he secs there and intelligently relates it to his own work.

He is imaginative in his approach and does not hesitate to

suggest innovations of various kinds.

To mention only one of

these, it was as a result of his initiative that "electoral

police" appeared upon the scene during the Presidential ejection

campaign in mid-1966 with a salutary calning effect upon the

potential for political violence at the noment.

The Rating Officer's last fitness

Alb800pn Mr. Philips dealt

with his terminating an outstandingly successful and very complicated

assignment as Chief of Station, Dominican Republic:

This report deals

with a completaly different situation, i.e. coming into Headquarters as

Chief, Cuban Operations Group at the time that drastic reduction had

just become the order of the day. The same energy, imagination and

zeal which has characterized Mr. Phillips over the years has

characterized his performance in this difficult task since his

assumption of the new responsibility. He has been a prime mover in

reducing the Headquarters WH/COG component to realistic and

managable proportions. By the same token he has been a prime mover,

guider, cajoler and sometimes "patron saint" to JAIWAVE rnanagement

in its massive job of bringing JMWAVE down from its ponderous

proportions to a viable Clandestine Services "instrument" compatible

and consistent with the present day needs of Cuban operations.

This is a very fine officer with one of the best potentials in WH Division. I

believe the rater is somewhat carried away in his views.

Mr. Phillips'

career advancement has been closely observed in this Division and I do not

believe he is falling behind in the promotion timetable. It is definitely

expected he will be recommended next year (which is within the proper time

frame, ) if his current excellent performance continues.

SECTION C (Continued)

Most important however, and this is one of Mi. Phillips

unique qualities, he has been able so bring about this drastic

reduction and at the same time instill enthusiasm in his stati for

new approaches to the ever more difficult Cuban target. His own

infectious enthusiasm and his fine manner with co-workers and

subordinates has made this possible.

In short the Rating Officer

believes he is the right man at the right time for the job he is in.

Mr. Phillips' relations with the Department of State and

other agencies where it really counts are outstandingly good. He

has in his short time back re-established his fine relationship with

• the manager of the Voice of America. This relationship will

undoubtedly be or inestimable value in getting W' Division's new

radio effort through the 303 Committee and into operation.

It is probably obvious to one reading this fitness report that

the Rating Officur is well disposed towards Mr. Phillips. This is

quite true. It in no way, however, affects the Rating Oiticer's

opinion thas Mr. Pisillips is a man d considerable talent who dor

one reason of another has fallen a least one grade behird in the

promotion timetable.

The Rating Officer, therefore, trusts that

this will be corrected in the near iuture. Mr. Phillips is i gentleman

of breadth, drive, imagination and dedication. The Rating Officer

considers dir. Phillips to be one of the very best of the many fine

officers he has known in his career in the Clandestine Services. In

some way's he is unique in that he know's the business iron the ground

up, having starred in unofticial cover (several assignments) and now

having moved into the managerial area late he can speak with

authority based on valid experience.

His task has been made more

reporting which remains very high.. His critical analysis and in-depth

interpretation of the rapidly changing political scene have been timely

Mr. Phillips brings to this assignment (his first as Chief of Station)

a wealth of CA experience gained through many years of operating in the

Western Hemisphere and other areas. As a propagandist and general CA •

operator he must rank high among all Agency personne.

Consequently,

it was indeed fortunate that his assignment to the Dominican Repüblic came

at a time when a persun of his talent was badly needed.

Arriving shortly

after the American intervention he has had the difficult task of ferreting

out information in great detail about an entirely new government,

diplomatically handling the delicate coordinations with other U.S.

Government agencies in a crisis and highly emotional situation, while

administering a rapidly expanding station composed in large degree of

young men long on initiative and intelligence but somewhat lacking in depth

of experience.

At present he is engaged in a fairly large and vastly

important election operation which is of concern to the highest authorities

of our government.

Fitness Report - David A. Phillips

SECTION C - Continued:

Perhaps the outstanding quality which Mr. Phillips has demon-

'strated is his'ability to "fire up" his people to produce at their

maximum capacity. Another outstanding characteristic is his diplo-

matic manner of deali..g with other officials. Of particular note is

the fact that Subject',, relationship with Ambassador Bunker of the OAS

(who, in effect, has been the President's principal representative, in

the Dominican Republic) are closer and more fruitful than the relation-

ship of the Embassy with Ainbassador Bunker. This has in no way

damaged the close relationship Subject has with the Embassy and other

government officials.

Subject had little nanagerial experience of the scope required

by his present position prior to his arrival in the. DR, nor had he had

much experience in FI natters. He has adapted readily however, and

he continued to broaden in these respects with the passage of time.

Cost consciousness is, of course, a relative thing. Mr. Phillips

as a CA operator "thinks big." However, it is clear that he weighs

heavily costs against anticipated results and expects lo get a dollar

return for each one spent. Overall Subject can be described as a very

able person. His ability to maintain Station morale at a high level while

producing at a very gruelling pace under difficult conditions is in itself

an outstandin accomplishment. Mr. Phillips has been recommended

for an Agency Award.

SUBJECT: Letter of Appreciation

THRU:

The Honorable W. Tapley Bennett

American Ambassador

Sanio Domingo, Dominican Republic

TO:

DAVID PHILLINS

American Embassy

Santo Domingo, Dominican Republie

1. I wish to express my sincere appreciation for the outstanding contributions

you and your staff have made in the accomplishment of USFORDOMREP Intelligence

missions from 1 May 1965 Lhrough 17 January 1966. The first intelligence contact

spon our arrival il San Isidro Air Base on 1 May was a representative from your

office. From that das on a mutual respect, cordial relationship and a unity of

effort prevailed throughout the many trying days in the Dominican Republic crisis.

Without your assistance we would have realized a serious gap in the intelligence

picture, a gap which would have made intelligence evaluations and the development

of tactical estimates most difficult

2. My J'2 has frequently mentioned the close association and coordination ho

has had with you and the members of your organization and repeatilly expressed

the high esteem and respect he has for the professionalism and competence

displayed by you and your subordinates.

3. The intelligence unity of effort in the Dominican Republic has been exemplary

and a prototype for future operations.

This cohesive atmosphere is directly

attributable to your efferts.

SACKGROUND

ON REQUEST FOR CREDITABLE SERVICE: August 1950 Unt1l 3 March

A basic document in consideration of this request is HCSA-825,

dated 4 February. 1954.

I was running an English-language newspaper in Santiago, Chile

Pay ah north.

when asked to work with our Station

first pay was $50.00 per

During this period I recall a number of activities undertaken

for the Station, and l' travelled to New York for clandestine training.

The file indicates "He was originally approved operationally in handle

the complex Soviet espionage case o: FULMINATEP-2.

His conduct of this

case was considered excellent....

"It will be recalled that

leadquarters was very pleased with the printing job...which he had done."

The latter was indicative of a number of such chores, when I stayed be-

hind in my plant after the employees had left for the night, printing

leaflets..booklets, etc.

I also handled agents and did a number of

and-assessing jobs for the Station.

4. I signed a new contract on 25 January 1952 for $500.00 per month

which ran until the termination date of 31 August 1953.

(Actually this

was in the form of a loan which was paid off at the rate of $500.00.

advance was used to purchase printing equipment which allowed me to do

certain work for the Station, but which I retained.)"

After termination of the contract on 31 August I remained in Chile

until 4 March 1954. Ourtirg this period I recruited a CP agent who still

works for the Station--and was a cabinet member under Allende. On 3 Febru-

ary 1954 Headquarters asked that I be made available for another assigment.

The Station pointed out tit I was working on the recruitment, and that !

and my family were planning on a European vacation. Headquarters again

requested my assigment. Thus I departed for the Guatemala project in

early March, abandoning my free family trip to Europe (tickets paid for

sy advertising in my paper, and leaving my family behind to pack up.

accepted this assigment without knowing where it was, or for how long it

would last. Indeed I did not even have a contract.

I worked for the Agency in Santiago, then, between I August

1950 until departure for PBSUCCESS on 4 March 1954.

I was always avail-

able and when I finally did leave it was for Agency business rather than

my own.:

Thus I request that all or part of this time be approved as

creditable toward retirement."

of this dispatch is to request a review of exactly what CHOIDEN's

status has been ovor the ycars, what must be done to repay letire

ment funds for any periods of creditable service not now covered,

and to study the possibility that

some periods of tonure might be

converted from uncreditable to creditable status.

CHOADEN served in the Air Force from February

1943

through October 1945, with total service of twò years, eight

months and 19 days...

3. The dates of CHOADEN's first RVROCK service in Santingo,

Chile, are very hazy to CHOADEN.

He does recall that he uns first

recruited by the COs, but cannot recall if this

was on a

formal,

salaried basis.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Mr. Kermit Roosevelt

ATTENTION

SUBJECT

: Mr. 'John Baker

: Mr. Paul D: Langevin; Employment as ClA

Staff Officer

1.

To those of us at Headquarters who have followed closely the

work of Mr. Langevin in connection with PBSUCCESS, it is completely

evident that he made one of the major and most outstanding contributions

to this Operation and that he has demonstrated himself to be exceptionally

qualified in the feld of political and psychological operations (covert).

I have just been informed by Messrs. Barnes and Langevin that the latter

who has heretofore been employed in the capacity of a Contract Agent,

desires to become more closely associated with the Agency and would

like to be employed as a regular stall officer. I am very much in favor of

following up on this opportunity, and I have good reason to believe that

the Director likewise is specifically interested.

2. There are certain aspects of this case which appear to require

special handling and tailoring -- none of which presents any difficulties as

I see it -- but, on the contrary, would tie in very neatly with both the

near term and longer range aspects of the employment of Mr. Langevin.

These aspects are as follows:

(a) Mr. Langevin desires to begin his term of empluyment by

the Agency with a period of service at Headquarters. (He has spent

many years in Latin America, principally in Chile where he has

owned and still owns a newspaper, and, in my judgment, it would be mutually

advantageous to the Agency and to Mr. Langevin for him to spend

not legs than a year as a member of the Headquarters organization. )

(b) Mr. Langevin has for some years in the past been giving an annual

series of lectures in various Latin Amcrican capitals.

These lectures

have been arranged by an agent of his in New York and his audiences

have consisted of business and professional groups and women'a organ-

izations. The general subject matter of his lectures has included talks

on the threat of international Communism to Latin America. Mr. Langerin

would desire, if it can be worked out, to be permitted to continue lo

deliver lectures of this kind in the future and is at the present time

SECRET

## Page 349

14-00000

confomplating.a series.of lectures où Latin America lo be given in various

cilleg-withän the United States.

(c) Mr. Lingerin would be ready and able so accept a field assignment

in Soüth America following the conclusion of the period of Headquarters'

duty referred to:

.3. As already indicated, it séems to me that there are no sérious

problems involved in any of the foregoing and shar the material can be

roadily cut to fit the pattern. It is the recommerdation of Mr. Barnes in

which I concur, that Mr. Langerin be assigned to the PP Staff during his

cour of duty here.

He could in this capacity work very closely with WH

¡Diviaion, but it seems to Iracy and myself that he can contribute importantly

to the work of the PP Staff and in the process broaden himsell. As regards

the matter of the lectures, I would recommend that arrangements be made

lo permit and even encourage him to continue these since it seems to me

that they would fil in very well with his general PP assignment -- assuming, of

course, that his Headquarters, and field cover are properly designed and main-

rained. The Headquarters cover problem is not a substantial one and as far

an the field in concerned if Mr. Langevin were to go under nor-official cover

of the right kind this also should present no problen. There is a ready-

made cover in the field and in'a critically important country by virtue of

his ownership -- for some six years -- of a newspaper in Santiago. Il

would not be incompatible with his resumption of his position as owner and

editor of the Santiago newspapaer to work in an annual series of lectures

either in Latin America or in the United States. There is only one further

point involved in connection witi the lectures: Because of Mr. Langevins

intimate association ivith many of the details of PBSUCCESS and also in

light of the standing rules of the Agency, it would be desirable for him to

submit at laast in general outlines, and preferably textually to the extent

feasible, the substance of his proposed lectures. He is anxious to do this

in connection with the forthcoming lectures -- ¿or his own piece of mind

since he would like to be double-checked on the things which he should say.
