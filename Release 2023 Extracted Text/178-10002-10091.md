Cuban operations, economic warfare.

And how long were you on that detail?

to Cuba did you have occasion to become familiar with the

operations of the Miami base?

A

Yes.

And the situation in the Cuban community in Miami?

Yes, sir.

During the nine years you were with DDO's. Cuban

operations, who was - who were the chiefs of the Miami

Station?

A

I think in 1963 Ted Shackley was the Chief and he

was followed by -- I can't think of his name. I should know

it. Well, I will come back to that.

Then, the next Chief of Station was Paul Henze.

What years was he Chief?

I think paul was there about a year and a half.

He

left in 1968 when we reduced the size of the Station. Let's

say Henze was there from 1966 to 1968. And then Jake Esterline.

He was Chief of Station from 1968 to 1973.

Now, what was the formal title of the group to which

I Now, was this a special group within the DDO of was

it attached to one of the area divisions?

NO.

Following the Bay of Pigs, they created a thing

called Task Force # which was headed by Bill Harvey. And

that - when Harvey left, he went to Chief of Station, Rome,

and Fitzgerald took over, it became Special Activities Staff

It wasn't attached to anything except -- it reported to the

Deputy Director, Plans.

Q

And that was

Mr. Karamessines?

Yes.

well, it was Relms at that time back when it

was first created. Helms was DDP at that time.

And Task Force W was created immediately after the

Bay of Pigs?•

Well, not immediately. I think sometime around

in the Bay of Pigs was

in April. I think this was created in

September, something like that, 1961.

And that subsequently became the Special Activities

Staff?

A

Special Activities Staff and consequently became the

Cuban Operations Group. As the Cuban Operations Group it went

back into the Western Hemisphere Division.

And what was

the date of that reorganization?

Well, after the Bay of Pigs when Task Force W was

established, did it have sole responsibility for Cuban

operations?

•yes.

Or was that shared with the Miami base, Miami

Station?

A

No. The Miami Station was under Task Force W.

All right.

Would that also be true of the Special

Activities Staff, the

• Cuban Operations Grous?

A

Right, except that at the present time the Station

has no Cuban operations.

Q

I understand that. When were Cuban operations termi-

nated?

A

At the Station? Let's see. Sternfield went down

there in 1972.

It was during fiscal year '72. I think it was

in early 1973. It vas a gradual reduction.

And have those operations been terminated entirely

of are they now run out of the washington area?

All Cuban operations are run out of Washington.

any such discussions?

Well, the first knowledge I had of any discussions,

I was on TDY and this was October, November, 1963, with Fitzgerald

in Paris. And I knew that he was going to meet -- let me put

it another way. I had overheard that discussions were going on

with a member of Castro's military but that he wanted, as

I recall, he wanted some british -- I mean Belgian rifles and

met with him again and

I recall, as the personal representa-

tive of the Attorney General, Bobby Kennedy.

I provided all those

files. There are 19 volumes that

we gave to your people. But I don't know who was reviewing

them.. I think Belin was going to do it himself.

Yes. He is. He

is doing it himself:

And MI. Fitzgerald?

Yes, and I really can't recall some of the other

people. We were -- we had just moved the Station at that time,

in Paris, out of the Embassy into the old Rothschild Palace

and we felt that it was probably bugged, so all conversations

took place - we walked around the garden and tyat type of

Mr. Sanchez -- was he a member of the military?

No. Mx. Sanchez was in the Special Activities Staff.

He was stationed in Washington. And he was in contact with

Cuban military-type.

Was it your understanding that the Agency had received

instructions with respect to this activity from another

component of the Government?

A

ivell, let me put it this way. I don't know whether

they received instructions. I have to assume, and I am pretty

positive, that this was a result of a Special Group decision.

And at this time you have to remember that Bobby Kennedy was

overseeing this deal, presumably for his brother, and he was

that the decision was made not to provide him with

thing that comes to mind, I think he made a leaflet drop

over cuba and this was subsequently reported in the press and

by the Bureau office in Miami.

Do you know who financed his activities?

I have no idea.

Is it possible that Mr. Sturgis' activities were

indirectly financed by the Agency through -

I don't see how.

Frank Sturgis is a soldier of

fortune: has been. He has constantly tried to associate himself

with the Agency. When I went through his file they wanted me

to classify the file and the way I classified it was "don't

destroy it, he is an intelligence nuisance."

2. Have you caused the Agency records with respect to

Mrl.

Sturgis to be assembled in any one location?

Yes. Ihave custody of them.

And what is the volume of that material?

A

As I recail, there are five volumes. Your Committee

called for them the other day after the article in the paper,

I guess it was last Saturday. They called for them Monday and

they returned them Monday afternoon.

Do you know who examined those files?

A

No, I don't.

You indicated

a moment ago that Mr. Sturgis contacts

the DCD office in Miami with some frequency, is that correct?

A

Well, not great frequency but he does with tidbits

of so-called information.

Is this information limited to narcotics, alleged

narcotics traffic?

A

Recently it has been.

Has Mr. Sturgis been encouraged by the DCD office

in Miami?

A

Mr. Sturgis has been told by the DCD office in Miami

to take his information to the Drug Enforcement Agency or the

FBI.

Do you know whether or not they consider him an

A

No manner.

Do they have any - do they periodically seek to

collect information from Mr. Sturgis?

A

I can't speak

to that but the records

that we have

don't reflect anything like that. Before they would contact

somebody in that context,

knowing that there is a 201 file

on Sturgis, they would have to coordinate with the Latin

American Division before they did anything since we do hoid

the file.

Would you briefly explain what a 201 file is?

A

A 201 file is a personnel file. It consists of any

information relating to an individual appearing in the press

as a result of other agency reporting and that type of thing..

Personnel or personality file?

A

Personality file, I should say. Excuse me.

Do you know whether or not there is any connection

or relationship between Eugenio Martinez and Mr. Sturgis?

well, I will say this. Obviously, they do know

each other. They have to know each other from their days

in Cuba.

pated with Martinez in raids against Cuba?

and exfiltrations and perhaps one or two raids, hit and run,

sabotage-type actions against Cuba. Sturgis never engaged in

any of these things. He never did it for us nor did he ever

do it on any of our boats, planes, or -- anything that beiongs !

to the Agency.

When Martinez would run such an operation or captain

a boat on such an operation, would he be charged with putting

together his own crew?

• No. He had

an assigned crew and every boat had a

Case Officer operating either.out of the -- probably out of

the Miami Station.

Sometimes I would assume that we did have

some people in the xey west base. But he, Martinez, would receive

his instructions and briefings from his Case Officer.

So it is likely that he could have brought Sturgis

along on any of these operations?

A

Absolutely unlikely. Oh, the guy whose name I was

trying to think oi, Chief of Station, John Dimmer.

And that would be. for a period of time between

Shackley and Henze?

A

Yes.

1964 to 1966?

Something

like that.

Not to my knowledge.

Well, Cubans who participated in these activities.

We trained them at these places we had in the keys.

Now, there also -- some of them were brought up here and trained

at the Domestic Training Station.

where is that located?

That is down in Virginia.

Were any CIA personnel actually involved in these

Occasionally, I would think that - you have got to

employees, independent contractors and this type of thing.

Most of the paramilitary operations and the training was

conducted by the Special Operations Group which is another

DDO?

A

DDO.

Now, the facilities that we have been talking about,

training facilities, were manned, then, by the Special

Operations Group, or at least supervised by the Special

Operations. Group, is that correct?

vell, supervised, yes, and I would think that probably

some of the training

was given by their people. The Domestic

Training Station is under the Office of Training and -- but I

would think that in the paramilitary field that the SOG would

probably staff the training facility with their people who havei

the expertise in paramilitary operations.

Now, were the people that were being trained at

these facilities basically Cuban refugees?

Yes.

And at the outset i take it not many of those people

were American citizens?

No.

Or had become American citizens.

You spoke about paramilitary operations and covert

action. How do you distinguish between those two categories

of activities?

3

Well, actually one can fall into the other. The

paramilitary could fall into covert action but in those days

we did distinguish somewhat. A lot of the covert action was

media placement. We had a number of operations at - legal-

type operations, harassment operations. For instance, Fidel

seized a great many art treasures and in particular he had a

Napoleonic collection which was supposed to be the finest in

the world that he sold to dealers in Europe. He had paintings

that were immensely valuable that he tried to have auctioned

in London and the london auctioneer would not accept them

because he obviousiy didn't have clear title to them. He was

-- they were stolen, in the eyes of the auctioneer.

He was

forced to auction them in Toronto, Canada.

We ran legal operations, got the owners and had them

hire attorneys and bring them to court and this type of thing.

He seized these race horses. He tried to peddle them

in

Europe and up in Canada. We ran opposition against that

it was called the Special Group, CI, Counterinsurgency. Then

it went to the 302 and then it had another name in between

there and now it is the Forty Committee.

particularly when they were countries that we had treaties

with, NATO countries, Canada, this type of thing.

Let's talk about each of those in turn. You said

you used moral suasion, what kind of activities are you

A. Well, in the moral suasion field we -- actually, we

were the catalyst in this whole thing and we had the legal

activities, the legal - well, I don't know how you would

phrase it, but we operated under the Cuban access control

regulations of the Ireasury Department, the Irading with the

Enemy Act, and we also used the facilities of the Department of!

Commerce, the Export Control people.

I. guess as you are aware, Cuban industry was totally

U.S.-oriented. As parts began wearing out and this type of

thing, Castro had his little people there running around trying!

to place orders with subsidiaries of U.S. companies. Where

we would find this out througn ail-source intelligence, we

their foreign subsidiaries not to provide the spare parts

and the other things that Castro might need. We had the

Department of

Commerce -- we identified 600 of the major U.s.

companies that could provide spare parts for Cuban industry.

We had

the Department of Commerce send letters to those 600

manufacturers

and

ask them to cooperate with them in denying

any spare parts to the Cubans. This was a fairly concentrated

effort to really isolate them.

All right. And that is what you were referring to

as moral suasion?

A

Yes.

Anything else in that category?

Not really. None that I can think of.

Did you make the same kind of efforts with foreign

What kind of purchases were made?

Well, we purchased at one point - we purchased

What?

A

Bright Stock.

What is that?

ileavy, heavy oil, and since Cuba -- 85 percent of

her energy comes from oil, this was considered a critical

commodity. Bright Stock can be -- oh, it is almost like tar,

melted tar, and it can be cut into additives, lubricants, this

type of thing, and this was critical to the Cuban economy. So

we had an oil firm purchase this Bright Stock from a dealer

eventually

soid in Africa.

A

Right.

Let's taik about economic warfare for a couple

of

moments. Could you describe for me briefly the type of

economic activities that were conducted against Castro?

A

Well, first of all, we wanted to denigrate the

regime, his credit vorthiness, and this type of thing. We

worked very closely with the Coordinator of Cuban Affairs in

the State Department and, well, for instance, in those days, I

guess it was back in 1964, the price of sugar had

jumped from

about a penny a pound to 13 cents a pound, something

like

that, and we couldn't understand why. So we kept -- Fidel kept

saying that he had such a poor crop and this type of thing and

we just couldn't figure out why he had such a poor crop because

some of our own island assets told us they were out there cutting

this cane like mad and the mills were working 24 hours a day,

this type of thing. So subsequently, we found out that he was

lying and he was storing the raw cane in the schools, any

place. He had no storage facilities and put it any place he

could.

So in cooperation with a couple of sugar brokers in

New York, we surfaced this fact and the price of sugar took a

real tumble and all of a sudden then Cuba started exporting.

It was this type of thing that obviously he was

trying to build up the worid price because he didn't have any

money, he was so short on his exchange, and obviously we didn't

iant him to get the exchange.

So it was those types of

activities.

Was the assistance of any U.S. businessmen or U.s.

companies enlisted in that effort?

oh, yes.

2

In what manner did you use U.s. companies and

businessmen?

A

Well, we simply used them as the experts. A great

many -- the sugar industry in Cuba was controlled by the

American community, by American bankers, and obviously they

lost everything when they had to pull out. Sugar is the

lifeline of Cuba as far as any exchange, foreign exchange, this!

type of thing, and it was naturally our Number 1 target. So i:

was only natural that we vould go to the American businessmen.

What kind of assistance did you seek or obtain

from

these businessmen?

well, we sinply talked with them about why -- you

know, the market conditions were, why the price was rising,

if

we could find out that fidei has plenty of sugar, what would

happen to the market price. This type of thing.

They were used as consultants, basically.

Indeed, I do and we went to the top level, even

Maritime operations.

Can you think of anything, any other type of para-

No. I really can't, no.

Am I correct that those operations were manned

by CIA contract employees?

A

Right.

Which would include Cuban refugees.

A

Right.

A Right.

Any other branches of the services, Armed Services,

Yes. No, not to my knowledge. You have got to remember

that probably down at our Domestic Training Station we

probably have people on detail from other -- from the military

branches in the Government, but other than that I don't think

that -- of course, during the Bay of Pigs operation we also

had people detailed into the Agency.

Now, the training of persons involved in maritime

operations, I take it, was conducted in part within the

United States and in part outside of the United States.

that correct?

this category of maritime operations?

well, the infiltration operations, infiltrating

agents into Cuba, exfiltrating agents, hit and run sabotage

raids. That is about the extent of it.

Now, when did these operations commence? Was it

shortly after the Bay of. Pigs?

A

I would -- I think these operations were probably

at their height during the period about 1963 through, say,

1967. The program was terminated in 1968, I think in December

1968, something like that.

Why was the program terminated?

First of all, it was too expensive. It wasn't provid-

ing enough intelligence and it simply wasn't -- economically,

it wasn't feasible to continue these things. The agents were

wasn't sufficient for what the investment was.

You say the agents were getting wrapped up.

A

Yes.

A

What do you mean by that?

When we infiltrated an agent, Cubans would identify

him and capture him.

These various types of paramilitary operations that

were conducted by the Agency I trust were approved by the

Forty Committee?

Every operation received a specific approval from

the Forty Committee.

frequently -- they would either approve the operation or say

no. These operations had to be planned well in advance because

the tides had to be right, the moon had to be in the proper

phase for communications and this type of thing. And these

things, all these were coordinated with the Joint Chiefs of

Staff, the Navy, the Coast Guard, the FBI. If we were

agency that had any involvement whatsoever, and the entire

No.

You are not talking about a very big volume of

operations because of the planning that had to go into these

things. I would say that probably at the height of the thing

they may be running three or four a month. No more than that.

You have heard Eugenio Martinez refer to having

of these operations, you know, you would have to have a mother

ship in place and rubber boats and the UDT people to go in to

see if there were mines and this type of thing on the shore

before you go. So he may have considered that all these train-

ing exercises were operations but no way did he ever partici

pate in any three or 400 active operations into Cuba.

a successful operation. By that, I mean they didn't do as

much damage as they wanted to because they had to get out

because the Cuban defense came after them. It was that type

of operation that we did.

As I recall, another time we took a team in to burn

some cane fields. Really, the classical operations that we

did in the maritime activities were the infiltrations and

exfiltrations.

Were any CIA operations run out of Guantanamo?

sugar to dump into gas tanks and metal fragments to put down

crank cases. Things of this nature.

all the oil. We did that with a big operation. We made our

own oil, substandard. Additives, I should say, not oil.

We

contracted with an American firm for that. And we shipped

it in through third countries in Europe. It did hit the target.

The thing we wanted to get at was the oil and the

automotive machinery on the island. We knew it was breaking

down and if we could get a complete breakdown we would have

everything at a standstill because in those days the automotive

equipment wasn't coming in that rapidly from Europe because

Castro didn't hve the money to buy it and they weren't going

to

extend the credit.

The railroad system was in total disaster. The

Soviets had such a long logistics line, supply line, plus

the fact that the Cubans didn't like the Soviet equipment

because they were used to good American equipment. And these

were principal targets that we were trying to get to.

- Q

In your experience at the Agency can you think of

any other analogus or similar paramilitary operations run

from a base in the United States?

No.

I know there has been some paramilitary training

in the United States.

A

Oh, yes.

In connection with other operations.

thing. They were extremely well armed. We had our under-

Well, fishing companies, Geodetic Survey, marine

In all, I think during the period that the station

and these other entities were under commercial cover, of non-

official cover, I think we had 100 so cover companies.

Did any of these companies actually engage in any

legitimate commercial activities?

A

Not to my knowledge, no.

None of them -- were any of them in competition with

firms in that area?

A

These are probably what we would call devised

facilities. They were probably registered with the State of

Florida and they paid taxes and this type of thing, but if one

was. blown or became known, we just crossed that out of

existence and started up a new one.

What did Eugenio Martinez do when he wasn't running

these operations?

Well, he was down -- this is one of the reasons, as

I told you before, we brought him back and put him under that

contract, that retainer, because of the years that he spent

under such strict operational discipline down in the Keys.

Obviously, he didn't stay down there all the time. He

came back -- he might come

back once a month,. or something

like that, to see his family, perhaps once every two weeks

if he got some time off.

to the Soviet Union and I forget exactly now what happened to

it but I know that it got a hole below the waterline, or

15

16

something, and had to put into Puerto Rico for repairs.

In order to repair it, I guess, and get it in the

was, they had to remove the sugar and

put it in the warehouse and at that time I guess somebody came

19

up with a plan to try to widen the rift between -- there was

a rift at that time between the Soviets and Cubans and to

21

22

put a harmless substance into the sugar that would make it

acid, sour tasting, and it wouldn't harm the sugar of the

individual, and some of this was done. And then when it

24

leaked, of course, we had to get rid of it and we had a sugar

25

firm buy it back from the Soviets.

Are there any other operations in which crops were

A

No. No.

In Cuban products?

Yes.

A

No.

Not that I recall. You see, Cuba really - in

those days the only thing, Cuba was exporting sugar and nickel.

The agriculture sector of the economy was in absolutely total

chaos. God, they didn't have any citrus, they didn't have

anything, and the poor people in Cuba were literally starving.

There just wasn't anything to eat. And Fidel was going around

with this big plan -- of course, there were a number of

experimental cattle ranches in Cuba. King Ranch had one there.

I forget -- several other European and American companies that

had experimental cattle ranches there and they were experiment-

ing with the, you know, cross-breeding and this type of thing.

Fidel was preoccupied with this. He went up to

Canada and paid $100,000 for a bull and - so he just put it

When was the Miami Station established?

As a station?

Yes.

I think in September 1961.

And that was several years before you became involved

in Cuban matters?

Yes.

A

Operating stations, no.

This is the only such station in the United States

as far as you know, is that correct?

A

Right.

And was this station established to deal primarily

with Cuban activities?

A

Yes.

Cuban-related matters?

A

With Cuba, period.

Did it have, when it was established, any other

A

Not to my knowledge.

Entirely limited, then, to Cuban activities?

Yes, and in support of Cuban activity and other

attached to that Station?

To that Station? Well, the Station had probably a

Physical facilities.

Well, they were located on the south campus of the

University of Florida, I mean, the University of Miami, at

the old Richmond Naval Air Station. It was a self-contained

unit. It was pretty well off the beaten path, in fact, damn

well off the beaten path. It was about four miles from the

Dixie Highway inland. We had our own guard force.

Official cover?

No. Non-official.

Engaging in any business?

No.

Now, in a community of that type, Cuban community,

how long could a non-official cover last?

Well, obviously it didn't, but it was research

activities. Funded -- it is a giant mechanism when you put

one of these things in for the funding and this type of thing,

• for your ostensible customers, establishing bank accounts.

Yes, I understand.

A

So it was a research activity and the only people that

ever paid any attention to the place were the newspapers. You

know, somebody would make an inquiry, you know, we can't accept

any work, we are loaded with Government contracts and this

type of thing, and it held up reasonably well. And out of

this one thing, of course, then we were running these innumera-

ble other covers with different activities. The guard

force, of course, were like -- well, they wore uniforms, similat

to the Pinkerton people and this type of thing. And I think

that there was -- in the later days at that site I think the

Department of Agriculture had offices in there and some other

Government agencies, in other buildings, of course.

And this particular Station, then, was under the

supervision of the group we have been discussing?

A

Yes. They were staffed within the Cuban Operations.

When did the Western Hemisphere Division resume

responsibilities for the Miami Station?

A

Well, when Des. Fitzgerald left as Chief of the

Special Activities Staff and became Chief of the Western

Hemisphere Division, he brought it back into the Division.

Is there presently a Miami Station?

A

oh, yes.

And how large is it

at the present time?

Well, since we -- I think when we closed down the

Cuban Operations, I don't know how large it is at the present

time because we are in one of these periods where we-are

reassigning people, but I think by the end of this fiscal year

there"are going to be between 11 and 14 people.

When you joined the group in 1963, what functions

were being performed by the Miami Station?

A

Well, all the classical intelligence functions. I

think I have lined them out at one time .. collection of

positive intelligence, counterintelligence, paramilitary, this

type of thing. Covert action.

This is the list of things you gave me earlier in

the deposition?

So the Agency was conducting counterintelligence

activities in the Miami area?

A

Yes, sir.

Can you give me an example of the kinds of counter-

intelligence activities that the Agency would be conducting

in that area of was conducting in the area at that time?

Well, we had a number of joint operations, as I

recall, with the Bureau. We had identified a Castro agent that

came in by small boat and when she was - she came in with a

number of other people. When she hit the — they had a recep-

tion center up in Opa Loca that was

really a HEW operation.

The Domestic Contact Division office had people out there. and.

we did, too. Our people from the DDO were under

cover. When the lEW people did the

preliminary interrogation of these people they had to fill

out forms, where were you born, this type of thing, biographic-

type thing. These forms would be passed to our people who would

look at the forms and based on previous experience or what

they might have been doing, ad they felt that perhaps they

might have some information of intelligence value, they would

reinterrogate them.

It was in this manner that this gal came to our

knowledge. We surveilled her for a long time and determined

that obviously she was receiving messages and she was

sending messages. So along with the Bureau we put a surveillance

on her and we obtained a van with DE equipment in it and

indeed, she went on the air in the morning at 5:00 o'clock

or 4:30 or whatever it was, and the direction finder found

it was being beamed toward Cuba, this type of thing, and that

was oen of the examples of the CI activities we were involved

in.

Not really. You have got to remember that the

Bureau's Cuban squad was fairly small. I mean, it was a large

squad in terms of FBI squads. It had 36 people on it, some-

thing like that, but 36 people trying to follow a couple of

hundred thousand Cubans around, you know, it is pretty nega-

tive. This was one of the reasons that obviously from -

in those days when we had formed these revolutionary fronts

which were being run by the Cuban exiles, they were reporting

to Case Officers and

they would report on things in the

community, of people they thought were suspect and this type

of thing. These leads in turn were then given to the Bureau

and it was to this extent that we got ourselves involved

in CI activity.

Would it be fair to say that the involvement in CI

activities in that area was primarily a function of the over-

whelming number of these people and the Bureau's inability

to properly staff the thing?

Yes, yes. You have got to remember, too, that a lot

of the people on that Cuban squad were in the legal section

of the Embassy in Havana. You know, the FBI overseas is

known as Legal Attaches,

obviously working out of the Embassy

the same as our Station was, and a lot of our Station officers

from Havana were down in Miami at that time. So there was

relationship there that had gone over a period of years

between the Agency and the Bureau.

I wonder if you could describe briefly for the record

what the hors were.

A.

Well, the MOTs were Cuban a Cuban intelligence

organization in exile.

We full intended - this was part of the

overall contingency plan that US Government had. Should Castro

ever be overthrown, these peonle would be the nucleus to go into!

Cuba and form a new Ministry of the Interior.

Now, Ministry of the Interior, is that a euphemism

for Security Agency?

a residence which we rented and the interior was changed into.

small rooms like this where you could bring people in, sit them

down, under controlled conditions, and debrief them without any

interference and this type of thing.

A.

You mean in terms of vears?

A.

well, I would think that I would probably say from

about 1962, and I think the debriefings as such, of course

i we relied principally on the airlift for the people coming out

and when the airlift was cut off, which Castro did - cut off

about, I quess about 1970 or 171, in that timeframe -

I see.

A.

-- that stopped the flow of the refugees, so we just

terminated that part of the activity.

Well, in addition to debriefing refugees that came

in in the airlift, did the smaller group of AMOTS have any other

intelligence gathering functions --

A.

NO.

In the conmunity?

A.

Well, I can't give you a real yes or no to that. I

would suppose that there is an outside possibility they could

have been used to debrief people within the community, within

the Cuban community, but we had in the organization - all these

people were Cuban with the exception of we had what we call an

On-Site Case Officer, who was a fulltime staff employee and he

had a couple of assistants; including a secretary. These people

were directly under his control: Though the organization as it

was set up, they had their own chief and this type of thing,

but the chief took his instructions from the On-Site Case Officer.

if these people went out and did something on

their own, they could do things we were not aware of, obviously.

You can't -- you know what they are doing during their eight of

ten hours that they are going to work everyday but once they

leave, we don't know what they are up to.

Did they have CIA credentials?

A.

No sir, because they were proprietary hires of this

commercial cover.

0.

Did CIA levy any intelligence requirements upon these

people other than in their duties - in their debriefing

capacity, I should say?

A.

No. When -- there were - obviously there was a

standard debriefing form that covered questions of intelligence

interest or a battle, you know, anything - economic questions.

morale, and this type of thing. When these questions -- when.

these people were cebriefed and the debriefer wrote up the

report, it would be sent from the AMOTS over to the Station.

If the debriefing report contained something of positive

intelligence, of that nature, the Case Officer -- well, not the

Case Officer but a staffer in the Station may or may not jot

down some additional requirements and ask that that person be

recontacted and asked

specific questions.

Now, in aridition to debriefing, what else did this

which would be secretaries, translators, strictly administrative

types. I don't think there were more than probably 12 or 15

in that group, if there were that many.

(Off the record discussion)

BY MR. MANEREDI: Back on the record.

Before we move on to further discussion of the AMOTS

could you briefly describe for me what role the CIA plays in

resettling Cuban emigres?

A.

CIA doesn't resettle Cuban emigres.

What Agency is charged with that responsibility?

A.

Health, Education and Welfare.

Does CIA play any role in that process?

A.

We may assist if we are asked but the idea of the whole

airlift was having relatives here. for somebody to claim you when

you came in so you wouldn't become a ward of the State of the

Government, and normally when these refugees came in, they were

processed through the Center and then they had a place down on

Biscayne Boulevard they called. Freedom House and this was, of

course, all run by HEW, and they - if need be and they had to

stay overnight of stay several days, HEW would put them up and

care for them in Freedom House.

Then as soon as they could, of course, they would move them

to the areas where they wanted to resettle them, where the

relatives were, this type of thing, and we had nothing to do

with that whatsoever.

Turning back to the AMOTS, and to the larger of the

two groups, what was

the name of that group again?

A.

We can call them

for short?

A.

Really, they are both - the only reason we separated

the two groups was for security because we had one group housed

over here and the smaller groun was over here. Obviously we

couldn't bring these refugees into the larger establishment, so

that is why we took the smaller establishment to preserve some

cover.

they did do economic and social reporting. They put out a

monthly newsletter based on the information they collected.

The information these people collected as opposed to the

information we collected, ther's was all unclassified. That

Spanish language type things.

Well, they were doing clandestine collections as well,

weren't they?

A.

I don't know if you could call it clandestine. What

did you have in mind?

0.

Well, would they run agents in the community?

A.

Well, yes, there were penetrations of the Cuban

community, yes.

And that is clandestine collection, isn't it?

WE11, I call that human resources.

All right. Where are these files now?

A.

They are in the Headquarters here. A great many of

them were really destroyed. It got to be rather comic. We

went down there several years ago just looking through the files

to see what kind of shape they were in and they had such great

information for intelligence value in there as a picture of a

gal who might be the daughter of a Cuban refugee who just won

a swinming meet. It got rather ridiculous. So we purged those

files and took out that material, you know, which just didn't

have any pertinancy at all.

How. are the files organized?

You indicated before that

there is a card, index card for each Cuban refugee?

A.

Right.

Are there soft cover files as well?

course, we had targets for recruitment. It could range from

anything from a first mate, a captain or chief engineer of a

Cuban maritime vessel to Fidel. When we targeted these people

as possible recruitments, for possible recruitment, we would ask

that all the information on that individual be assembled so that

we could do a complete target study - habits, you know,

everything right down the line. In case of some of the more

important ones, of course, we had psychological studies prepared

where we had enough information. But this is one of the things

these people did. If we said we want everything you have on the

start looking through the papers or anything else to come up

Well, that is right.

I would assume so.

And that so much of them may - some of the subjects

served as safe housekeepers in other countries. They served in

Government allowed a lot of this to go on for awhile but I guessi

about

1965 or 1964 they got a little tired of it and they

I am sure the AMOTS were in part responsible for proposing

alerting us and in turn we alerted the enforcement agencies when

there was going to he a raid against Cuba by one of these

militant groups.

A number of times raids were aborted, picked

Well, originally they were set up to assist with the

As we phased down the maritime activities, they were made

available to intercept Cuban communications. NSA tasks them with

the frequencies they wanted covered and the Cuban Communications

nets they wanted covered, such as the border guards. Another

important one was the sugar network. We had the border guards,

sugar, transportation, maritime. I think there was an interior

network they covered too. But all electronic intercept coverage.

Now, since they belong to us we could levy ceratin require

because the common interests, -- we have a common interest in

what NSA has an interest in and unless there were one particular

operation going that they wanted to cover exactly what the Cubans

were doing, then we would task our people with that.

For instance, we knew a Cuban vessel was taking arms into

Africa and our operators saw the thing leave Havana and then

there was absolute silence.

So nobody knew where the thing was.

But we knew arms were being loaded and we finally located the

boat in an African port, I mean the intercept operators did, when

dutcame back on the air. And this is the type of thing. As

a matter of fact, they were unloading arms in Algiers. And 200

connection with the Cuban operations of the Agency during the

period of 1959 to '51?

A.

To my recollection, Howard Hunt was on the Covert

Action Stais dealing in propaganda.

Was this propaganda cirected to the Cuban people in

this country?

No. Cuban people abroad.

And what-was his connection with the planning for the

Bay of Pigs?

A.

I would have to review the record to really answer

that.

I don't know.

Didn't he spend an awful lot of time in the Miami

area?

He commuted quite a bit.

A.

The Agency subsidized these fronts in an effort to

have unity rather than these split factions, split anti-Castro

12

factions. Obviously the leaders of the fronts knew that the

i CIA was subsidizing. Supposedly the people that joined these

fronts did not know they were being subsidized by the Agency

or the li.S. Government.

But when you say "supposedly," does the fact appear

to be otherwise?

WEll, based on my experience with the Cubans and this

it vouldn't take long for knowledge of any subsidy to surface

itself.

What assistance would you render for members of

A

Well, in the case of the Latin American editor

we would put him in contact with the Chiets of Stations of

areas he periodicaily visited and the Chiets of Stations

would give him background briefings and this type of thing

on the developments

within a given country.

Was that done evenhandedly for various newspapers?

A

Predominantly, I would say probably the Miami

Merald received probably a little more attention than the

other papers, principally because: it was a large paper and

their Latin American editor traveled a great deal throughout

the Hemisphere.

Was he aiso used as a source?

No.

Do newspapermen in Washington, D.C., receive

similar briefings?

Yes.

Is there a CIA station in Puerto Rico?

A

No. There was but there isn't any more. There

hasn't been one there for years.

When was it disbanded?

A

I think the station was established around 1958

and - perhaps it was

established before that. I think it

went out of existence in 1958.

Do you now why it went out of existence?

i1o, i son't.

I don't have any idea.

2

Do you :now what function it was performing?

. A

(Mods in negative.)

2

You mentioned earlier that Bernard Barker worked

in the Cuban community for the CIA?

He worked ith these fronts, too.

Mas he performing any intelligence function in the

community?

A

Intelligence functions. Well --

Was he collecting information?

A

sure. I he got information that he thought was

worthwhile he would pass it on.

Now, would he have been considered one of the three

or 500 persons empioved or assigned to the Miami Station?

Yes. He was à contract employee.

And were intelligence requirements levied on such

contract

employees?

Some of these contract employees were, then, in

the business of soilecting intelligence information in the

Cuban communities in Miami.

A

Right.

Now, I think we Finished with the AMOTS but can

you think of any other functions performed by the AMOTS that

we have not discussed in the course of the afternoon?

A

io, not really.

I think you previously described them for me as the

eyes and ears into the Cuban community.

Right.

And they actually had a physical facility in Miami

which was their headquarters, did they not?

Exactly.

Ind there was a CIA Case Officer who managed to super-

vise that facility.

Now, turning to the Miami Station's involvement for

assistance to the Secret Service in connection with the

political conventions in 1068 and 1972, would you briefly

describe for me the nature of the assistance provided by

the Agency to the Secret Service?

At the raquest of the Secret Service we conducted

name traces on individuals whom the Secret Service wanted

These includedthe employees of all hotels in Miami

was there any check made to determine whether

any of them were American citizens?

We levied on the Secret Service as a requirement

that they have identified these people by nationality before

we would run a name trace. Inadvertently, at one time

they did submit a list, a rather long list of American citizens

which ve promptly sent back to them and toid them we could

not trace.

And this practice was followed both in 1968 and

1972?

more information on the Cubans than we would have back here.

But the names were traced through Agency files?

and I think they were carried

in the Anderson column but ve

made file checks and this type of thing. One particular

activity was supposed to have been carried out in Rockefeller

Center in New York and is surns out it was taken out of

context.

It was a training mission and -- training exersise.

These guys were being trained in surveillance in New York

and they were simply asted to go into a branch of the Manhatta

- Chase Manhattan

and to come back out and then they were

supposed to diagram the layout of the bank. And this to some

of them meant casing the bank when in fact it was just à

memory exercise.

things as surveillance?

and break-ins?

said, in the case of this particular thing, it was misinter-

preted as casing the han':. These exercises were given -- they
