1. ACTION REQUIRED: PLEASE SEE PARA 6.

2. IN SUPPORT OF<JFK ASSASSINATION>REVIEW BOARD EFFORTS,

STATION IS WILLING TO ATTEMPT RECONTACT OF (LITAMIL/9 (T/97 TO OBTAIN

INFORMATION REQUESTED REF A

HOWEVER, PLEASE NOTE THAT, ASSUMING REF

B PARA 3 IS IDENTICAL TO (T/9,

] HE IS AGING AND POSSIBLY EVEN

THE ONLY FEASIBLE LOCATION FOR RECONTACT WILL BE HIS

HOME, WHERE HE APPARENTLY LIVES WITH THE FEMALE WHO ANSWERED THE

PHONE DURING 26 MAR 98 PRETEXT CALL, AND WE CANNOI GUARANTEE THAT WE

WILL BE ABLE TO MEET ALONE WITH HIM.

IN ADDITION, STATION BELIEVES THAT TO THOROUGHLY ANSWER ALL

OF REF A QUESTIONS, THE OFFICER CONDUCTING THE RECONTACT SHOULD

IDENTIFY HIMSELF AS A USG EMPLOYEE AND EXPLAIN THE VERY REAL

POSSIBILITY THAT /O'S NAME WILL BE EXPOSED IN AN UPCOMING

*DECLASSIFICATION OF DOCUMENTS RELATED TO THE<JEK ASSASSINATION. >

ASSUMING THAT CTOROCKAWAY COMMITTED ITSELE TO KEEPING (T/9'S) NAME AND

COROCKAWAY RELATIONSHIP SECRET,

WE BELIEVE THAT THE LEAST WE CAN DO

IS ALLOW CE/TO PREPARE FOR POSSIBLE RELEASE

ENGAGING IN A FRANK EXCHANGE ON CURRENT REVIEW BOARD PROCEEDINGS.

WHILE POSSIBLY UPSETTING TO (T/9> SUCH A DISCUSSION WOULD BEST ALLOW

US TO DETERMINE ANY NEGATIVE REPERCUSSIONS ON LI/9> HIS FAMILY, HIS

PENSTON? AND COMMERCIAL ACTIVITIES, POSSIBLY RESULTING FROM

EXPOSURE.

ALTHOUGH STATION DOES NOT CURRENTLY HAVE ENOUGH INFORMATION

TO RESPOND TO REF A QUESTIONS, WE SUSPECT THAT THE CUBAN GOVERNMENIS

DOES NOT PROVIDE PENSIONSZTO EXPATRIATES. EVEN IF THIS WERE THE

STATTON OFFICERS WHO HAVE SERVED IN HAVANA SEEM TO RECALL

THE STANDARD CUBAN PENSION IS CURRENTLY WORTH LITTLE MORE THAN

SEVERAL DOLLARS PER MONTH.

THEREFORE, ANY SEVERING OF

T9'S CUBAN

PENSION WOULD NOT LIKELY HARM HIS FINANCIAL POSITION.

PER REF A QUERY REGARDING EFFECT OF (T./S EXPOSURE ON OTHER

STATION OPERATIONS, WE DO NOT TOOK FORWARD TO EXPLAINING TO ASSETS

CURRENTLY ON THE BOOKS WHY THE NAME OF A FORMER--AND. STILL

LIVING- TOROCKAWAY ASSET WAS OFFICIALLY DECLASSIFIED BY THE USG, WHEN

MERE DECLASSIFICATION OF INFORMATION ON ACTIVITIES UNDERTAKEN BY THAT

(ASSET ON TOROCKAWAY IS: BEHALF WOULD PERHAPS HAVE BEEN SUFFICIENT.

UNDERSTAND THAT HQS IS SEARCHING FOR ADDITIONAL-P/9-SPECIFIC

INFORMATION ON WHICH TO BASE AN ARGUMENT AGAINST DECLASSIFICATION-OE

/9OS IDENTITY AND-WE HOPELTO ASSIST IN THAT ENDEAVOR. HOWEVER, ON 7

BROADER SCALE, IF (I/2-SJIDENTITY AND ROLE WERE TO PROMINENTLY APPEAR

IN THE MEXICAN PRESS SUBSEQUENTLY TO DECLASSIFICATION, AT THE LEAST

WE WOULD EXPECT A MODERATE EROSION IN OUR ASSETS' CONFIDENCE THAT

TOROCKAWAYY IS ABLE TO PROTECT THEIR IDENTITIES. AS WE EXPECT OUR-

ASSETS TO MAINTAIN THE-CONFIDENTIALITY OF THE RELATIONSHIP® FROM THEFR

SIDE OF THE EQUATION AND HAVE OFTEN MADE THIS A MATTER OF CONTENTIONS

WITH ASSETS, SOME AGENT HANDLING PROBLEMS COULD ENSUE WERE WE TO

APPEAR LESS THAN COMMITTED TO FULL PROTECTION OF THEIR IDENTITIES.

FUTURE AGENT ACQUISITIONS COULD ALSO BE COMPLICATED BY THE

DECLASSIFICATION OF T/9'S NAME, AS C/O'S WOULD PROBABLY HAVE TO WORK

THAT MUCH HARDER TO CONVINCE MEXICANS THAT WE CAN PROTECT THEIR

IDENTITY-FROM THE TYPFCALLY ANTI-AMERICAN-LOCAL PRESS.-

REQUEST HOS COMMENT REGARDING NEED FOR RECONTACT OF <T/93 AND

REQUEST FILE REVIEW SO THAT WE WILL BE IN A FIRM POSITION FROM WHICH

TO ENGAGELI/J.

ALTHOUGH (I./9) MAY NOT RECALL DETAILS OF ANY RECONTACT

PIAN AFTER THE CONSIDERABLE TIME ELAPSED SINCE WORKING AS AN AGENT,

PLEASE PROVIDE ANY DETAILS (I.E. CALIAS OF TAST HANDLING C/OT WHICH

COULD SERVE AS BONA FIDES.
