never answered.

The Cubans are trying to get Sinobas' line moved to the

Embassy.

They have also asked for the telephone company to repair 1+-92-11.

As soun an these lines are working again, coverage of two of the Yugoslar

Embassy linea will be dropped in order to pick up all the Guban lines which

are presumed to have a much higher priority.

The principal functions of this security unit are to:

(1) Provide a plain-clothed security detail for the President,

an extensive telephone tap activity on both

the Rightist and Leftist political opposition forces, and

3) :perform investigations and arrests of primarily political

offenses. The unit's agents are largely poorly trained,

1. Astor taking a good look at LUBNVOY and LIFBAI, I vould agree

with the persons I talked with 1y boxico; they maintain that any vell-

run tap operation should produce substantial Intelligence intomation,

provided the targets are of intolligenco Interest, and provided also

thero are people at the station who louk for 1t mul are able to rocog-

n1z0 1t. The case of LI'EAT 1s interesting in this respects It has

been deprivad of Ita most productive lined in favor of LtENVOX, and

pot 1te Intalligence production compares favorably, viti that of the

the highlighty of the previoua day's take overy morning and marke

cortain stems for action by atation case officers or reporte offlcaro:

The reports officars work on copies of the tako at tho cano time.

3. There are soveral aspecta of LIENVOY that make 1t an excellent

operation and an outatanding producer of intelligence.

I will deacribo

theis in dotall when uy notes cot her fron tho station. The principal

factors in the succes of Lishvoy seem to be the following.

a. The afreement mede with top Maxican officials, unlike

many such agreements elsewbere, ls as much in effect today as 1t

the targeting le not bared on personal pollties;

not well informed on the say the Mexico Station exploits operational leade from

LENVOY. The outside staff agent, Arnold AREHART has instructions to alert

contact any of the target installations. This is done by a telephone call from

Energency neetings are arranged in double talk (meeting for coffee or lunch).

RIGGS meeta AREHART within fifteen minutes at a pre-arranged downtown

recently arrived Counsclor of the Soviet Embassy and former defection target

in Mexico, called his wife at their residence.

The number was not listed but

vas immediately checked by Raymond GERENDE who determined that the

number was the switchboard of themartment house where KAZANISEV and

several other families live. The reason the Station checked out this nuinber

was to put unilateral coverage on it if pousible; however, the switchboard was

The referenced cables describe tvo recent incidents in which the

Mexico City Btution mule use of LIFTIVOY information to take Investigatino or

puritive action against security suspocto.

The first reference reportod the

Identifying and "trapping".. of a PRPHIME eitizen uho vas offering his services

to the Cuban Embassy, and the second reported the deporting of a Cuban IS

agent identified by LIaNVOY mterial.

In both of these cases, there suens to have been departure from the

extreme cautlon with which the Mexico Station has alrays handled the LIENVOY

material. Admitting thnt the cables do not set out enough facts to enabla us

to make a final judgment, ve still feel a little unasay sout this use of

LINVOY material.

In the first casa, the Station sent an agent to the suspoct 's

hotel, poing as a Cuban Embassy official to "trap" him into rovealing his

Intentions.

The scheme, which was adnittedly clever, succeeded, but ve vere

concerned about what would lave happened if the Cubans themselves had decidod

be grunt that the cubans and other bloc personnol in Mexíio

City may suspect LINVOY exists, but they do not know 1t - yet. Incidentally,

we had no traces on the PEPRIER 1avolved.

3. The second case involved the detection, apprehension and deportation

of a cuban Is agent whoe whereaboute vero learned through LIENvoY.

Per facts ve know about this case, ve eannot really judge the possible rias to

LIXNVOY. The lexico Station created LIENVOY and has alvaja guarded its security

with scrupulous care. Has there teen a changoi

4. Floally, pleasente that both these cases should have been raported

to Heedquarters

before nction was taken.

In general, arresto, deportatios,

trapping, or other action arainst security suspects should ke approved by lasd-

quarters, except

where in the opinion of the Chief of Station, the added timo

would seriously Impair ODYOKE security of the security of our operations.

CONTINUATION OF

HMMA -21845

On 5 Jime 1963 Douglas J. FEINGLASS, Siaff Agent, arrived in

Mexico to replace Howard G. SA FARANO, the Station translator for Russian

language conversations appearing on LIENVOY and LIFEAT lines. SAFARANO

• departed PCS on lo June thus freeing an inside slot for use by an operations

FEINGLASS' usefulness io the Station is handicapped by his inability

to transcribe the Spanish portion of the reels from the Soviei coverage. This,

despite Headquarters assurance that he coul do these transcriptions.

he has seitled into outside living condi ions with a ninimum of difficulty.

For the present, a monitor froin the LIENVOY tap center is transcribing te

Spanish portion of the above take. There is a Station backlog of Soviet tapes

numbering about 50 which accumulated during the period when FEINGLASS

was trying unsuccessfully to transcribe the Spanish.

The backlog is being

retained until Orville HORSFALL arrives. In addition to the Russian trans-

crotions, FelNGLAss also elips the iranscripts for individual dossiers thus

relieving the Siation Case Officer for Soviel opcrations of a clerical task.

After the arrival of HORSFALL. the Mexico Station will review requirements

for oliside translators and make recommendations for future use of

FEINGLASS.

In early June to support the AMROD operation, the Station requested

full transcripts of the Cuban Embassy lues. In addition, Thomas G.

URQUART (ps) while on temporary duty in Mexico was given access to the

LIENVOY tap center io review the traffic on a current basis.

4. Exploitation of LIENVOY information.

Coverage of the Cuban, Czech, and Soviet Embassics provided

details of their personnel, their contacts, travel and other useful CE data.

In nost all cases of official travel, LIENVOY gave the Station advance

information when reservations were made. Confirmation of the travel Is,

of course, obtained through the LIFIRE project.

The traffic is reviewed for English speaking persons who might

In the opinion of Thomas G. URQUIART, who has spent some time

inside he iap center, Arnold F. AREHART is doing a commendable job in

B. Material Prosessed

In January, the LIENVOY LP provided the Station

with 47 pages of dally resumes from all lines, 10 pages from the Cuban

lines, 26 pages from the Czech lines and 57 pages from the Soviet lines.

Thirty two pieces of other informatlo: were also recelved.

A total of 285 reels of recording tape were used

during tlie inunth. (Note F, Tecimical).

C. Liaison

The Station continues to provide LITENSOR with

situation reports on the Red Chinese-Indian border dispute.

D. Exploitatlon of Material.

Examples of information provided by LIENVOY

were the beginnings and organization of the Central Campesina In-,

dependiente (CCI) (sec MEXIs 3041 and 3053) and the contact made by

a Hollywood television station with the Cuban Embassy in Mexico City

In order to ser up an interview with Fidel Castro, (see MEXT 321*).

E. Security

There were no known security problems.

F. Technical

The LP was inoperative from 8 January until 18

January. Workmen installing street lights in the nelghborhood of the

LP cut the cable leading fro:n ihe telephone contral to the LP in several

places. Instead of replacing the damaged cable with a new one, tele-

phone coinpany workinen painstakingly repaired It. By the end of the

month there were still seven lines out of operation.

G. Produciion

During January, LIENVOY produced twenty-three

(23) reports listed in the attachment.

In addition the usual quantity

(except for the ten days lost by inoperation - see E above) ot CE and

biographic materials were obtained.

Very often, a sincle

product in the individual Soviet files for transmittal to lleadquarters for

Its information; or possibly more important, for eventual tranamittal to another

The Cuban efforts at propagands in Mexico in maich the Cuban

Ambassador to Mexico conferred with Raul Rod, Cuban Foreign

Minister, and suggested to him thai Fidel Castro write a short

message to the Mexican people in Sicilpre On its ninth anniver-

sary of publication (see HANA 19399).

The negarive treatnient to a Czech commercial representative

by Mexican Immigration authorities (see HMALA 19158).

The refusal by the Pan American Institute of Geography and

History of the Organization of American States to permit Teresa

Proenza Proenza, Third Sccretary and Cultural Attache at the

Cuban Embassy, to attend the meeting held by i: (see HMM 0438).

The embarrassment caused by rie immoral behavior of Mexican

female delegates to the Cuban 20 July celebration held In Havana

in 1901 according to Manuel Marcue Parinas of the periodical

Politica as told io Teresa Proenza Proenza.

D. Liaison

With the approach of the GPIDEAL visit to Mexico 29 June - 1 July,

liaison activities greatly increased. COS visited LITENSOR on 28 june.

LITENSOR assured that there would be no problems in the GPIDEAL visit

and the safety of GPIDEAL was guaranteed and in the haids of LITENSOR.

A: this meeting LIFENSOR indicated his annoyance with the Cubans, (See

NEXT 1253).

LIELEGANT turned over to the Chief of Station a list of persons who

were put under surveillance in connection with the GPIDEAL visit.

The list

also indicated those who were arrested. (See MEXIs 124* and 1264).

At a meeting held on 28 May 1962. the Chief of Station, LIELEGAVT,

and LIENVOY/2 met with LIEVVOY/1 and obrained his agreement to hire

LIEVVOY/14 to work under LIENVOX/3 as a technical inspector in Telefonos

de Mexico.

The purpose in putting LIEVVOX/14 in this capacity is to have a

man who would be more available to the LIENVOY Project and who "would see

Whas others might be tapping relephones" in Telefonos de Mexico. Further-

nore, LIENVOY/1 agreed to see to it thas LIENVOY/14 would have "the

raige and authority" io do the work.

Putting LIENVOY/I+ as a technical inspector within Telefonos, could

create problems for the LIFEAT Project. At the same rime WILSTED is re-

studying the LIFEAT system, improving it, rightening up the security and

alerting the base houses to watch for any abnormal acrivity on present taps.

l: iras been understood by the LIENVOY case officer that this has been done

and it will be reported from time to time in future LIENVOY reports.

E. Security

For a report on security of the LIENVOY site for June 1962, see

puragraph 2 E of HMMA -19319 (RYBAT-1597) dared 10 July 1962.

As was stated at the end of that paragraph, any surveillance or

security threat of the LINVOY basehouse or personnel can eventually be

handled, should this be found necessary, by Chief of Starion in LITENSOR.

FOR GALBOND AND SAYRE FROM ANBASSADOR MANNE

¿ AS YOU KNOW, SONE WEEKS AGO WE BECAME CONVINCED THAT ONLY

CHANCE OF GETTING MEXICO TO BREAX RELATIONS WITH CUBA WOULD BE ON

BASIS CUBAN INTERVENTION MEXICAN INTERNAL AFFAIRS• THIS OF COURSE

WAS ON ASSUMPTION TWO THIRDS RIO TREATY VOTE COULD NOT BE OSTAINED

TURN OVER MATERIALS DESCRIBED IN MEXI

9855 TO APPROPRIATE MEXICAN

OFFICIAL. I CHOSE GUSTAVO DIAZ ORDAZ.

SO DIAZ ORDAZ HAS INFORNED CAS THAT HE DISCUSSED THIS EVIDENCE

WITH LOPEZ MATEOS WHO EXPRESSED CURPRISE AND INTEREST. WE DISO

COUNT LOPEZ MATEOS STATEMENTS BECAUSE AS YOU NNOW HE HAS MUCH

BETTER EVIDENCE OF CUBAN EMBASSY INTERVENTION WHICH HE XEEPS

STRICTLY TO HIMSELE AND HAS NEVER TOLD CABINET ABOUT. THE

EVIDENCE WE TURNED OVER TO DIAZ ORDAZ HAS PSYCHOLOGICAL IMPORTANCE

BECAUSE PRESIDENT IS NOW AWARE THAT DIAZ ORDAZ ALSO KNOWS PART

BETUEEN THE COMMIES AND ANTI-COMMIES SHOULD OCCU? IN MEXICO.

40 • DIAZ ORDAZ HAS ASKED ME THROUGH CAS WHETHER I WOULD HAVE ANY

OBJECTION 15 THE INFORMATION WE FURNISHED HIM WERE MADE PUBLIC

SHOULD AN APPROPRIATE OCCASION ARISE IN THE FUTURE. HE SAID THERE

. WOULD BE NO-MENTION OF THE U.S. GOVT AND THAT GOBERNACION WOULD

PRESE:IT THE EVIDENCE AS COLLECTED BY IT.

So I RECOMMEND THAT CAS AND DEPT AUTHORIZE ME TO INFORM DIAZ

ORDAZ THAT WE HAVE NO OBJECTION ON THE BASIS OUTLINED BY HIM.

REASON FOR MY RECONMENDATION IS THAT ON THE ONE HAND WE LOSE LITTLE

BY BLOWING THE

FICROPHONE OPERATION SINCE BATTERY IS SCHEDULED

TO EXPIRE SOON IN ANY CASE, WE BELIEVE WE ARE IN A POSITION WHERE

WE CAN SAFELY DENY THAT WE HAD ANYTHING TO DO WITH PLACING MICRO-

PHONE, IN THIS CONNECTION DIAZ ORDAZ OBVIOUSLY BELIEVES OUR STORY

THAT WE PICKED UP SIGNAL BY ROUTINE DIALING OF DIFFERENT FREQUENCIES

AND THAT MICROPHONE WAS PRESUMABLY PLACED BY SOVIETS TO CHECK

ON THEIR SATELLITES, ON OTHER HAND AFFIRMATIVE ANSWER TO DIAZ ORDAZ

WILL ALSO IMPLICITLY SUGGEST THE POSSIDILITY THAT THE TIME MAY COME

HIEN WE OURSELVES MIGHT WISH TO MAKE THIS INFORMATION PUDLICO

I CAN THINIS OF NO BETTER INCENTIVE TO LOPEZ MATEOS TO BREAK RELATIONS

WITH CUBA THAN POSSIBILITY MEXICAN PUBLIC MIGHT EVENTUALLY DECOME

AWARE OF EXTENT TO SHICH MEXICO HAS TOLERATED CUBAN INTERVENTION

IN SPITE OF ITS VAUNTED DEVOTION TO THE DOCTRINE O% NON-INTERVENTIONA

GO FINALLY I WISH TO SAY THAT I REALIZE ALL OF THESE MANEUVERS •
