(reguesting all information on Winston Scott) and 93-1040

(requesting re-review of Hinston Scott's unpublished

manuscript).

2. Our records indicate chat CIA processing of POlA

request number 91-1231 is completed, pending referral of two

documents for coordination to the FBI and the Department O1 NWU1S

during the processing of fold requeat 91-1a3d,

Winston Scott's affiliation with the CIA became publicly

acknowledged pursuant to information releases processed by

the Historical Review Group under the Assassination Recorda

Collection Act ("ARCA"). Pursuant to ARCA, certain chaptere

of Minston Scott's manuscript also were released in full.

3. The CIA's response to Scott's outstanding FOIA

reguests should take into consideration the ARCA

disclosures.

Please inform me of the current anticipated

completion date or the processing or Scott's fOlA requeate.

Specifically, would it be possible to release the documents

for which the CIA has completed processing (request number

91-1231) and to request that the other two referrant

To: C/HRG

Subject: Request from Scott's son

The HSCA-orginated material in the CIA JFK Collection

and HSCA documents referred to the CIA by NARA are scheduled

I expect copies of the two

documents mentioned in Mark Zaid's letter to be within this

material.

However, there is no inventory of this materials

and a search could

be very time consuming.

HSCA documents referred to the CIA by NARA are usually

held at NARA for review by an HRG reviewer (John C): NARA

has sent some documents (mainly testimonies) directly to HRG

two documents are not among them.

The HSCA report on Oswald in Mexico city was released

in August 1993. The pages attached to Zaid's letter are

from that report.

We could ask NARA to pull the two documents and send

them over for review. Otherwise, they will be released

later this year.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Fred Wickham

FROM:

SUBJECT:

Barry Harrelson

ARRB Request re Angelton and Scott

Jeremy Gunn, ARRB staff,

has requested (via

telephone)

access to the following files/documents:

Winston Scott documents, including the entire

manuscript It came to little, and personal effects seized on

Winston Scott's death;

b. files of James Angelton housed in the CI

vault.

As Linda Cipriani) handled the recent FOIA

litigation brought by Michael Scott (Win's son) for all

documents on his father, Linda has copies of documents

responsive to Gunn's first request in her office.

I have

spoken with(Linda)and we agree that, with your concurrence,

the best course of

action would be to have Gunn view the

Scott documents and manuscript at OGC.

You should be aware

that during the course of that litigation, searches were

conducted to locate personal effects seized by CIA upon

Scott's death.

Those effects were never located, but a

destruction record that seems to refer to these personal

effects was located and provided to OGC.

Gunn would need

access to that destruction record as well.

3.

The second request of Gunn also was an issue in

the Scott FOIA litigation. At that time the DO told IP&CRD

that all Angelton documents were sorted through in the 1970s

and that a separate CI Angelton holding no longer exist.

Official files were incorporated into DO record system and

material not deemed

to be official records were destroyed.

To the extent that any destruction records exist on

Angelton's records, Jeremy would like to see these as well.

Linda and I suggest that the DO search for any such

destruction records and forward them to OGC.

In this way,

Jeremy can view them at the same time he views the Scott

documents.

4.

Jeremy has agreed that if CIA allows him to view

the above records "informally" and he finds nothing that

relates to the assassination, then he will not make an

"official request" for these records. Of course, any

records he believes to be relevant,

he will have to make an

official request and they will then become part of the JFK

Collection.

of Winston McKinley Scott at CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia. The General Counsel's office

The documents total approximatoly 6 inches, and include:

(.) A manuscript entitled "It Came to Little," by Ian Maxwell (pseud.), which contalns 221

enumerated pages. The foreword to the manuscript states that the events recounted therein contain "no

exaggerations and no deviations from basic truth:" (unpaginated forward). It reveals that some true.

names have been used, and that this has been done without the consent af the persons named. The author

expresses his "most sincere admiration and utmost respect for: Mr. John Edgar Hoover, Director, Federal

Bureau of Investogatlon (sic); Mr. James R. Murphy, wartime director of OSS/X-2; and particularly, the

late Allen Welsh Dules, OSS Chier in Switzerland during World War I, a principal architect in the

creation of CLA for President Harry Truman and the Greatest Director CIA has'had." The author refers to

the blight of communtim, and the courageous people who have worked to fight it, but nevertheless

concludes that "all the effort (to thwart Communism] has come to little." (unpaginated forward)

There is only one chapter that makes any identifiable reference to the assassination of President

Kennedy and to the eventa relatod to Mexico. City at the time Lee Harvey Oswald was alleged, to have

visited. That chapter has been released in full to the public.

(2) A Supplemental Declaration of J. Barry Harrelson from the case Michael Scott v. CIA, CA

No. 1:9SCV00686 with attached documents. The attached documents contain documents released in full

and some that are redacted. According to CLA, all redacted documents are a part of the JFK collection,

This should be confirmed. If they are part of the collection, no further stops need be taken. If not, they

must be fully reviewed to determine whether they are assassination recorde.

(3) Documents that appear to be copies of the personnel file of Win Scott. All of the documents

in this file were reviewed to determine whether any assassination records are included. Our review

disclosed nio "assassination records." Although not assassination records, the following information was

locatod in the personnel file:

"connection with espionage and subversive activities" and in "counterespionage" while based in Havana.

- Document, dated 7/23/69, refers to the possibility that CIA might attempt to recruit Scott far

the "Civilian Reserve Program (HR 20-15) following his retirement from the agency.

- On May 6, 1969, Soott was recommended for a Distinguished Intelligence Medal by William

V. Broe, who was then Chief of WH. The recommendation includes the following statement:

"Mr. Scott built a large and highly effective organization targeted against highest priority

national security targets; namely, the Soviet bloc presence south of the border. Given the nature

of the target, Mr. Scott malded his station with a predominantly CI orientation until it has

become a highly effective counterintelligence mechanism capable of covering soviet Bloc and

Cuban [activitios]."

His Citation for the Distinguished Intelligence Medal includes the following statement:

built a remarkablo counterintelligence machine- a true bulwark helping to guard our souther

classical operations."

- There is no record in the file that suggests, one way of the other, that Mr. Scott was over

DRAFT NOTES BY TIG FOR ASSASSINATION RECORDS REVIEW BOARD

JANUARY 15, 1997

Cleveland Cram

Untitled (History of the old Cl stafi) (beginning to dismissal of Angloton)

11 Volumes (c. 1981)

Albert S. Bonner

The Post -Angleton CL Stall

2 volumes (July, 1993)

The ARRE requested access to any and all internal CIA histories of the CI staff for the purpose of

determining whether they contain any information that would be useful for understanding the

assassination of President Kennedy, Including, for example, the activities of Lee Harvey Orwald, thé

structure of CI with respect to the comporients of the office that had responsibility for handiing Oswald's

file at different times (particularly CI/SIG), and any aspect of HITLINGUAL related to Oswald. Because

the Agency keeps these historios closely held, it was believed that they are rolativoly more likely to be

candid assessments of CI and its activities than one might obtain from more widely circulate documbnts.

I was provided complete aocess to the entire 11 volumes of Cleveland Cram's (untitled) history of the old

Cl staff. The Cram history covers counterintelligence at the CLA from its origins to the departure of

James Jesus Angletön. The historles appear as typed legal-size pages in green, cardboard folders. The.

first volume is hand dated (1981) and signed "Cleveland Cram." There are 1063 pages in the Cram

history, I was also provided complete accees to Al Bonner's history of counterintelligence, which starts

with the departure of Angleton and continues to the present.

By all appearances, the histories appear to be relatively candid assessments of CI. I was able to idantity

information that illuminated some of the lasuos of concert, and those will be outlined below. Ildentified

no information that would lend to any significant reevaluation of the role of CI in issues related to Oswald

or to the assassination. For the purpose of understanding the assassination of the President or the other

Issues that come within the scope of the Review Board's mandate - other than the information identified

below - I do not belleve that the historles themselves, nor coples of any of the pages of the histories,

would provide any significant wseful addittonal information that would enhance the understanding of the

assassination and I see no nood for any further information to be released from the histories. It la may

preliminary judgment that the page numbers highlighted below should be copied and attached to this

memorandum so that they can be made public

The information contained in the histories consists largely of case studies of important counterintelligence

activites. As a rule; the histories do not describe the structure of the Cl offices, the personnel, the filing

system, or operations generally « although discussion of some of these issues arises. The principal

sources used by the authors consisted of documents from Cl and interviews with officers. There are

relatively few footnotes and the citations are, accordingly, quite thin. There are, for example, only 8

footnotes in volume 1, Which themselves are sketchy. The points that enhance the historical

undorstanding of the assassination are:

1. The introduction to Cram's history refers to an carlier CI history that was wrltten by a person

who was provided only limited nocess to Angleton and the files. The author of the first history

was given, for example, no access to any CI/SIG documents. Cram, accordingly, found the

history to be unhelpful for understanding sensitive Cl activities. (Cram, p. I-2). There are

references to two additional documents that should be requested: the Goleniewski study on

Golitsyn (1975) and the John Hart study on Nosenko (called the "Monster Plot" ). (Charles

Battaglis, Staft Director of the SSCI, told me that the ARRB should request the Monster Plot for

revlew under the JFK Act)

P. 5/8

2 SECRET

2. There is a reference to a 1959 IG survey of CI which should be requested for review. (See,

0.G., Cram 47, 5б

3. The 1959 IG analysis stated the within the CI staff, "96 were professionals, 75 clerical and

four staff agents. The Staff also had one Fleadquarters contract agent, and several agents under

projocts." (Cram, 48).

4. There is a discussion of the Special Investigations Unit (circa 1959) and HILINGUAL.

Copies of pages 49-51, and 55, which describe the STU and HTLINGUAL, should be evaluated to

determine whether they contribute to understanding of relevant issues.

5. Angleton was on sick leave from the agency from May, 1960 to 12 January 1961. During

Angleton's absence, S. Herman Horton was Acting Chief and James Hunt was Acting Deputy

Chief. Hunt subsequently became the regular deputy and served until 1969. (Cram, 58).

6. Routine liaison with FBI was conducted by Jane Roman "from the late 1940s onwerd.."

(Cram, 70). Sensitive matters were handled, however, by Angleton or Hunt (Cram, 70) although

this practice "did not develop until the carty 1960s after the defoction of Golitsyn..." (Cram,

71).

7. The activitles of CI/SIG are described on pp. 144-45. Cram's cited sources are the 1955 and

1973 descriptions of its activities. It should be decided whether these two pages should be copied

for attachment to this memo.

I did not find that the references to Nosenko provided additional information that enhances the historical

understanding of the assassination. Mr. Angleton's testimony to the Church Committee is much more

illuminating in that regard.

The Bonner history, although after the perlod of Oswald and the assassination, discusses the issues of the

disposition of the files of James Jesus Angleton and a few other matters. Because of the speculation about

the contents of the files, discussions of their disposition would seem to be relevant The pertinent points

are as follows:

Banner volume I:

1. Bonner describes the CI staff, at the departure of Angleton, as being seriously unorganized

and as being intelléctually detached from the work of the agency. (Bonner, p. I:6-8:)

2. The Angleton affice files were voluminous and in disarray at the time of his departure from

the Agency. It may be appropriate to make copics of pp. 1:8 (ast paragraph) up to the last

paragraph on p. 14, 33257 to illustrate this.

3. "[Fliles were found on the assassinations of President John F. Kennedy and his brother Robert

F. Kennedy. These included autopsy pictures of the remains of Robert Kennedy. Although

Nosenko's account of the KGB's involvement with Lee Harvey Oswald and his denial that the

KGB had anything to do with the murder of John Kennedy might reasonably explain an

Angleton interest in the John Kennedy ascassination, neither Kalaris nor Blee, with whom

Kalaris consulted on this bizarre finding, had any idea why Angleton had the pictures. Neither

could they think of any reason why it was appropriate for CI Staff files to contain them. They

were accordingly destroyed" (Bonner, p. I:11). I subsequently interviewed Bonner, who told me

P. 6/8

CERAFT

that he had spoken to Kalaris and Blee about this, and neither man could remember anything in

the files excopt the Robert Kennedy photographs.

4. The files revealod evidence that Angleton ran "counterintelligence (operations] abroad as

Chief of the CI Staff in the way in which the local station would be effectively cut out and

command channel and communications would run direct to counterintelligence headquarters in

Washington" (Bonner, p. I:22.) (sic), I beliove Bonner is saying the following: Angleton ran

counterintelligence operations abroad as Chief of the CI Staff in such a way that local stations

would be efiectively cut out; command channal and communications would run direct to

counterintelligerica hoadquarters in Washington.

• Bonner cites two examples where Angleton ran lalson ita friendly governments without th

ocal station chias being speciically aware of Angieton's activities, The station chiets found thi

"früstrating." (Bonner, pp. 1:25-26):

6. (Circa 1976) "Jandling [FOLA requests for information concerning Lee Harcy Oswald]

required the creation of a task force of 13 operations officers and analysts, plus clerical personnel,

and their full-time efforts for over a month," (Bonner, p. 1:67.)

7. Discussion of activities of part of Cl stat circa 1976: "Double Agent Branch • was Charged

with the conduct of and coordination on double agent operations abroad. Since the vast majority

of DA cases were run by the US military services, the FBI, or -in some instance? foreign-liaison

services, the branch was very heavily a coordinator rather than active runner of operations."

(Bonner, p. 1:71).

8. Bonner refore to an August 1976 IG report sometmes called the Freer report It analyzes

Angleton's stewardship over CI compared to that of Kalaris, It discusses how Angleton ran CT.

We should review this report. (It is cited in Mangold, Cold Warrior, at 316.]

Bonner volume II:

The only significant reference in Bonner pertains to the final completion of the review of the Angletan

filles. (Bonner, p. I:114.)

DRAFT BY KMHC AND TJG FOR ASSASSINATION RECORDS REVIEW BOARD

REVIEW OF MANGOLD V. CIA FILES

JANUARY 13 and 24, 1997

The Man zold Y, CIA POIA litigation files consist of 7 redwelds, totalling approximately 18 inches, They

are organized by "abs," which can be described as followe:

Tab A: copies of published newspaper and magazine clippings that were released in full. I fee no need to

designate any documents as assassination records from the set.

Tab B: copies of published newspaper articles, the texts of which have been relensed in full. The agency

did redact marginalia, which consisted exclusively of file names and indicators. I see no need to

designate any documents as assassination records from the set.

Tab C: documents about Angleton from the 1940s, including his career with OSS. I see no neod to

designate any documente as assassination records from the set.

Tab D: docs 94-230, AR (aalen already part ol the colliction); Doce 95{24 Nov, 1978.

Memorandum JJA teitimony to HSCA), On December 11, 1978, the D.C.-based law frm of Duncan,

Brown filed a FOIA request on behalf of James Angleton in conjunction with his anticipated testimony

before the HSCA. Presumably all records related to this matter are AR and should be processed under the

JFK. Act. See doc, nos. 109-116, 120, 121.

Includes fitness reports (not designated). All of the fitness reports were reviewed to determine whether

they contained probative information.

Tab E: documents previously released to Edward J. Epstein in response to a request for book reviews from

CIA's internal journal "Studies in Intelligence." These documents are all copies of book revlews from

Studies in Intalligence on issues rélated to intelligence. I see no need to designate any documents as

assassination records from the set.

Tao F contains documents previously ralcased to Henry Hurt in response to a request for documents

concerning Alexander Orlov. Most of the documonts are newspaper articles and reprints of Senate

testimony. I see no need to designate any documents as assassination records from the set.

Tab & contains documents previously released to A. Doppali (on behalf of The Readers Digest in

response to a request for documents conseming Nicholas Shadrin. These documents include a speech by

DCI Turner, tostimony by Capt. Nikolai Fedorovich Artamonov (Shadriz) before the Comittee on Un-

American Activities (Sept 14, 1960), a transcript of a Panorama show on Artamonov, and extensive

correspondence from his wife to various USG officials about Shadrin's disappearance. I see no need to

designate any documents as assassination records from the set,

The Denied Documents File contains no assassination records and probably no EHUs, with the possible

exception of the following records:

From Category VII: nos. 496, 498, 499, 500, 510

Doc, no. 496 is directly relevant for potential future leads. The document is a memorandum

dated February 7, 1974. Docs, 498 is of interest regarding the Mafla, Teamsters, and Elofta.
