a. Vietnamese Communist ef-

forts to discredit the new Saigon

regime stayed in high gear this

week.

The number of armed attacks

was off from the high of the previous

week but still some 50% above the

c. These attacks have been,

for the most part, small-scale efforts

directed against the government's

paramilitary forces in the villages.

They have been designed more for

their psychological impact than for

immediate military gain.

d. A high volume of messages

on Viet Cong military and political

communications nets indicates a prob-

able continuation of this effort.

e.

The new government'is re-

sponding by stepping up its own

military operations.

It is also

setting about the hard job of re-

vamping the Diem government apparatus

nd harnessing broader popular sup

ort for the war effort

I. The generals have been

dealing fairly effectively with

their new responsibilities.

There

are, however, a few signs of dissen-

sion within this croud and between

it and civilian politicians.

g. One of the more ambitious

and troublesome figures is the able

but opportunistic General Ton That

Dinh, the new Minister of Security.

He has been travelling about the

country spreading the idea that the

coup was largely his doing and seems

bent on developing his own independ-

ent base of power. He is a man to

watch.

h, The new regime has also

embarked on a purge of high military

officers who sided with Diem during

the Buddhist crisis and failed to

get on the right side soon enough.

(INTERCEPTS).

a.

The death toll from the

terrorist outburst in Caracas last

Tuesday and Wednesday now stands at

about 30.

b. This is the high water mark

thus far in the campaign of the

Castro-supported Communist extremists

to disrupt the national elections a

week from tomorrow.

(Cont'd)

c. The Betancourt government

has struck back hard.

Its new uni-

fied command over the security forces,

passed this

initial test with flying colors.

d. At least 500 extremists

were arrested and the round-up is

still going on.

Their removal will

hamper the Communist drive against

elections in major cities like Caracas.

e.

We now expect the elections

to be held on schedule, a consider-

able achievement under

the circum-

stances.

The elections will be fol-

lowed, however, by a Communist ef-

fort to prevent the March inaugura-

tion of the victor.

f. The rub here is that none

of the presidential candidates com-

mands President Betancourt's con-

siderable assets for dealing success-

fully with the harsh realities of

Venezuelan politics. The constitu-

tion prevents Betancourt fron suc-

ceeding himself.

g. In the background, as

communism.

that Cuban interpreters are now

posted at several surface-to-air mis-

sile (SAM) sites on the island.

b. We think this means that

on-site training of Cubans has begun

on schedule.

Field training is to

last six months, after which the

SAM system may be turned over to

Castro.

In the past month some

1,500 Soviets arrived in Cuba.

Most

of these were probably SAM experts,

sent to monitor the training.

d. Prior to their coming, we

had detected no more than a few

hundred Soviet military personnel

entering Cuba since the October

crisis last year.

e.

We estimate that at least

18,000, have been withdrawn in the

intervening 13 months, leaving, very

rougaly, 4,000 to 7,000.

f. All Soviet weapons intro-

The only significant excep-

tion is the SAM system.

(Includes INTERCEPTS)

a. We have had an indication

that Soviet harassment of Allied ac-

cess routes to West Berlin will shift

this weekend to the air corridors.

b. The Soviet man at the Ber-

lin air traffic control center told.

the Allied representatives yesterday

that Soviet transports would be using

that sovaet

the air corridors for brief flights

during the next five weekends.

C. Moscow has tried on a num-

ber of past occasions to assert its

right to restrict Allied use of the

air corridors.

In early 1962, the

Soviets attempted to reserve "blocks"

of air space for their own use. They

have since demanded that Western

flights stay between stipulated al-

titudes, that we file flight plans

advance and provide prior notice

of

border-crossing times.

Iraq-Syria-

UAR

This sort of harassment

stopped in the spring of 1962 when

Soviet leaders became

convinced

that the US was interested in a

serious discussion of a Berlin settle-

ment.

Moscow may hope that the

threat of more of this sort of har-

assment will jog the US into talks

on Berlin.

It now appears that Presi-

dent. Arif's role in last Monday's

coup in Baghdad may have been vir-

tually that of a bystander.

b. According to our latest in-

formation, Arif was wakened early

that morning and given five minutes

to join up.

Tahir Yahya, now prime

minister, was reportedly the orga-

nizer.

c. Whatever Arif's role may

have been, the coup was primarily

an effort by the iraq army to cur-

tail the activities of the extreme

wing of the Baath Party. The Baath

is an Arab nationalist political or-

ganization, active throughout the

Arab world, which has been ruling

Irag and Syria.

(Cont'd)

For The President Only - Top Secret

## Page 13

The coup group has not

thrown all Baathists out of the

government; there are party members

in the new cabinet.

e. Syrian Baathists have wel-

comed this retention of their Iragi

brothers.

Their attitude springs

from the recognition that the Baath

in Syria cannot stay afloat without

support from Iraq.

Even so, we hear

talk of coup plotting in Damascus.

f. The reaction of Nasir's

Egypt, which passionately desires

co see the Baath go under, has been

exactly the opposite.

Cairo has been

backing off its all-out support for

the coup ever since the new cabinet

was announced.

NOTES

A.

USSR

New activity involving Soviet range instru-

mentation

ships in the Pacific appears to be forth-

coming.

Three instrumentation ships left Petropav-

lovsk 12 days ago and are apparently headed for the

more distant Pacific impact area, 6,500 miles from

Tyuratam.

We are looking for extended range ICBM

tests but we do not exclude a space event.

There

has so far been no announcement closing the area.

(INTERCEPTS)

B. Congo-USSR. Soviet embassy personnel have not yet

Teit Leopoldville, but their departure is expected

momentarily. They were ordered out of the country

after the Congolese turned up good documentary evi-

dence of their complicity in anti-government plots.

One of the items taken off a Soviet diplomat the

other day was a letter from an anti-Adoula leader

now in Brazzaville asking for funds and arms to ovèr-

throw the Leopoldville government.

C.

Britain The Labor Party scored again in the Dundee

West by-election Thursday, increasing its 1959

majority of 719 to a thumping 4,955.

Heartened by

this, Labor is now pushing for general elections at

once. Prime Minister Home is not likely to accede.

D. Ecuador The military junta which has run Ecuador

since July may be about to come unstuck.

We have a

report that one of the less savory members of the

group, air force Colonel Freiles, will try to take

over full control this weekend.

We are not sure

of the reliability of this report, but Freiles is

known to have been making motions in this direction.

Cosmos 22, launched a week ago, was recovered

yesterday.

It is the eleventh unmanned satellite to

be recovered. All recoverable satellites have been

launched from Tyuratam, the main Soviet missile test

center, and recovered after three to ten days aloft.

A series of non-recoverable satellites has been

fired from Kapustin Yar.
