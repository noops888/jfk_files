MEMORANDUM FOR: General Counsel
SUBJECT
:
Request for Determination of Creditable
Service 'Ir. David A. Phillips
1. This memorandum requests a determination as to
whether service performed for CIA by Mr. David A. Phillips -
as an independent contractor during the period August
1950 until 3 March 1954 and again for the period 19 August
1958 until 13 March 1960 can be considered as creditable
service under CIARDS. Mr. Phillips, currently a GS-13
staff employee assigned as Chief, Latin America Division,
DDO, plans to retire in early May 1975.

2. Mr. Phillips was a resident of Santiago, Chile in
1950 running an English-language newspaper when he was asked
to work with the CIA Station there. Headquarters granted a
Provisional Operational Clearance for his use on 2 May 1950
under Project [FULMINATER. The operational file contains a
project approval for FULMINATER-1 (Mr. Phillips) issued
31 May 1950 in the amount of $65.00 ($50 per month salary
plus $12.50 expenses) for the month of June 1950 and an
amount of $780 for FY 1951. An operational dispatch,
8TCS-A 1064 dated 10 July 1950, from the Chief of Station,
163 Santiago requested that the first payment be made 1 August
1950 for the month of July 1950 in the amount of $50.00 to
Mr. Phillips' bank account in Fort Worth, Texas. A payment
in the amount of $50 was to be made on 'the first of each
month thereafter until further notice".
16-23
3. On 17 November 1950, the Chief of Station, Santiago
advised leadquarters that the Station had acquired a safe
apartment for Mr. Phillips to be used by Mr. Phillips in
having an agent polygraphed by a Headquarters polygraph team.

4. Mr. Phillips states:
"During this period I recall a number of activities
undertaken for the Station, and I travelled to New York for
clandestine training. The file indicates 'lle was originally
approved operationally to handle the complex Soviet espionage
case of FULMINATER-2. His conduct of this case was considered
excellent. Also, 'It will be recalled that Headquarters
was very pleased with the printing job...which he had done.'
The latter was indicative of a number of such chores, when I
stayed behind in my plant after the employees had left for
the night, printing leaflets, booklets, etc. I also handlod
agents and did a number of spotting and assessing jobs for
the Station.
"I signed a new contract on 25 January 1952 for
$500.00 per month which ran until the termination date of
31 August 1953. (Actually this was in the form of a loan
which was paid off at the rate of $500.00. The advance was
used to purchase printing equipment which allowed me to do
certain work for the Station, but which I retained.)
1623
"After termination of the contract on 31 August I
remained in Chile until 4 March 1954. During this period I
recruited a [CP) agent who still works for the Station--and
was a cabinet member under Alfende On 3 February 1954
Headquarters asked that I be made available for another
assignment. The Station pointed out that I was working on
the recruitment, and that I and my family were planning on
a European vacation. Headquarters again requested my assign-
ment. Thus I departed for the Guatemala project in early
March, abandoning my free family trip to Europe (tickets
paid for by advertising in my paper) and leaving my family
behind to pack up. I accepted this assignment without knowing
where it was, or for how long it would last. Indeed I did
not even have a contract.
16-23
"I worked for the Agency in Santiago) then, between
1 August 1950 until departure for PRSUCCESS on 4 March 1954.
I was always available and when I finally did leave it was
for Agency business rather than my own."

5. As indicated in Mr. Phillips' statement above, he
became an Agency contract employee on 4 March 1954 in
connection with Project PBSUCCESS. The following is a

6. On 13 August 1958, Mr. Phillips resigned from the
Agency as a staff agent with the intention of opening a public
rolations firm in Havana, Cuba. In anticipation, however, of
using him operationally in Cuba, WII Division requested that a
contract be prepared for him as an independent contractor with
compensation to be $7200 por annum. The contract information
checklist stated that Mr. Phillips would be engaged in PP
activities "as assigned by the Chiof of Station, Havana
according to Station requirements". On 11 August 1958, the
Chief, WH Division sent a cable to the Chief of Station,
Havana stating that Mr. Phillips was leaving CIA to start
his own firm in Havana and that "Headquarters arranging employ-
ment Mr. Phillips at $7200 per year effective 15 August as
contract agent to carry out such KUGAGE tasks as COS may assign.
Payment details being pouched." On 16 September 1958, the
Chief, Wii Division sent another cable to the COS, Havana
stating that based on talks with Ambassador Walter Donnelly
in New York, Ambassador Donnelly stressed the need to supply
a programming technician to Radio Catacas as soon as possible.
The cable further stated: "Since PCS officer with these
talents due arrive Caracas mid-October, current need is for
Mr. Dave Phillips/TDY (Caracast possibly early as week of
22 September and to remain perhaps one month."

7. The contract for Mr. Phillips, effective 19 August
1958, was amended to reflect additional compensation while
serving outside Cuba. The amendment read, in part: "In full
consideration for the purchase of such information and services
you will be compensated in an amount calculated at the rate of
$7200, per annum except that for those periods of time during
which you are performing services necessitating certain
specialized professional skills on a full time basis outside
the country of your present permanent assignment, you will be
compensated at the rate of $13,000 per annum."
Travel and
operational expenses were authorized as follows: "While
performing those tasks for which you will be compensated at
the rate of $13,000 per annum, as set forth in paragraph
une (1) above, you will be advanced or reimbursed funds for
necessary expenses incurred in connection with such operational
travel as may be directed or authorized by the Government.
This may include per diem in lieu of subsistence in the course
of such travel and while on temporary duty away from your
permanent post of assignment overseas. In addition, you will
be advanced or reimbursed funds for necessary operational
expenses as specifically approved by the Government. Payment
and accounting for the items sot forth herein will be in
conformance with applicable Government regulations."
8. The following information is supplied by Mr. Phillips
concerning his Cuban assignment:
"In the summer of 1958 I resigned from the Agency with
the intention of opening a public relations firm in Havana,
Cuba. In discussing this the then-Chief, then-Wil Division,
Col. King asked me if I would work for the Agency in Cuba.
Understanding that this referred to part-time work which would
allow me to pursue my own endeavor, I agreed and a contract
was drawn up and made effective 15 August 1958. This was in
Washington. The Station in Havana was advised on 11 August
prior to my departure on 13 August.
"After settling in and renting an office in Havana I
was asked if I would travel on full-time Agency work. A
cable on 16 September 1953--about one month after I arrived in
Havana--roquested that I prepare for a TDY to Caracas of
'perhaps one month'. I replied that I would be ready to go
'anytime after 24 September'. My contract was amended to
indicate that I might be called on for future travel outside
Cuba. I did in fact go to Caracas on 28 September.
16-17
"This trip set a pattern which continued during
my eighteen months in Cuba. I travelled several times on
the project which began with the Caracas) trip--an area-wide
television developmental project--remaining outside Cuba
for long periods. This continued through late summer of
1959.
"Fidel Castro toppled Batista the last night of
1958. From that time I was devoting most of my time to the
Agency. I ran, from my office, a country-wide press service.
I handled several agents. In the summer of 1959 I was
instructed by the Station to attend a meeting with a group
of Cubans plotting against Fidel Castro. (See Memorandum
for the Record of 6 August 1959.) The last sentence of my
report on this meeting read: 'With the new death penalty
in Cuba for anti-revolution activity, it is not hard to
imagine that at least one member of this group might inform
to the government. That was prophetic. The Cubans in the
meeting, with two exceptions, went to jail where several of
them remain to this day. There was some indication that
the meeting might have been bugged. I was advised of this
while in the U. S. (still working on the television project)
and the Station suggested there might be danger in my
returning to Havana. I elected to return.
"By this time (late summer of 1959) Fidel Castro
had eliminated 'public relations'. I had no clients, and no
prospect of obtaining them. Despite this I stayed in Havana
until March of 1960 doing nothing but Agency work. When I
did return it was acknowledged that I would be coming back
to staff status (my contract was amended again while I was
still in Havana to pay for shipment of furniture). Immediately
on arriving in the Washington area I began to work as a staffer
on the Bay of Pigs operation.
"In summary: Despite intent on my part to have a
private business, I began working for the Agency when I arrived.
in Havana, often in TDY status which was full-time Agency work.
I never obtained a major client for my public relations firm.
I was always on call and working on instructions from the
Station until recalled for the Headquarters assignment.
was some risk in much of what I was tasked to do by the Station."
There
9. Your determination is requested as to whether
the period from August 1950 until 3 March 1954 and again
for the period 19 August 1958 until 13 March 1960 can be
considered as creditable service for retirement purposes
for Mr. Phillips.
